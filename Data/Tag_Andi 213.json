        "body": "<p>Hi so this is my first fanfic and not very good but I hope you like it. It\u2019s a Tyrus oneshot. They\u2019re aged up to 16 btw.</p><p>___________________________</p><p><br/></p><p>It was a fairly windy day when Cyrus had decided to go to the National Museum of Natural History. Their school had a chance to take a week long trip to DC and after the first day of boring history lessons, they were free to roam in groups of three or more. So, because it was his turn to choose their daily excursion, he had rounded up Andi, Buffy, Marty, Jonah, and TJ and dragged them to the large white building.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious guys, it\u2019s so cool! Theres so many different exhibits and it\u2019s free too,\u201d he explained. </p><p>Andi, who was not too thrilled to be separated from her girlfriend stepped in. \u201cI\u2019m sure it is, but it\u2019s a <i>history museum</i>, we spent <i>all day</i> yesterday learning about history! I\u2019d rather just call Amber.\u201d</p><p>Jonah ignored her comment and instead said, \u201cAfterwards do you want to go to the Air and Space museum? It\u2019s open until 6 today and I hear the planetarium is totally cool.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus, now looking at his friend, now realized none looked too excited at the prospect of spending their day looking at fossils. \u201cActually, I kinda wanted to visit alone, you know, really take my time looking at everything in peace, so you all can go do your own thing and we\u2019ll meet back here at 3. Does that sound good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure, Underdog?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus looked at TJ in the eyes for a moment and smiled. \u201cYeah, totally.\u201d</p><p>And soon enough, he was alone again. TJ joined Buffy and Marty in their race to see all the monuments, Andi went to the Renwick while FaceTiming Amber, and Jonah went to the Air and Space Museum to see the movies in the planetarium. So, checking through security and taking out his camera, Cyrus entered the building with a little bit of sadness but mostly excitement.</p><p>He decided to go from bottom to top so as he walked past the wooly mammoth he descended the stairs to look at the bird exhibit. It made him slightly uncomfortable seeing all the stuffed birds, but nevertheless it was fascinating. As he approached the main floor which he had entered on, he was met with many choices for exploration. Seeing as the dinosaur exhibit was crowded, he decided to save that for last and entered the Mammal exhibit.</p><p>Like the birds, seeing so many stuffed animals was slightly uncomfortable but it was still neat. He even got to watch a short video on the Morganucodon (not minding it was a video aimed at younger audiences) which explained the evolution of modern mammals from that small shrew-like creature. Then he moved to the Ocean exhibit, their was giant skeletons of prehistoric aquatic animals and even the jaw of a megalodon which was an ancient shark that was over two times the size of a great white, and could fit a family of five people whole in it\u2019s mouth.</p><p>Then he was lead to the human exhibit, he walked through this cool light tunnel that showed all previous variations of human that lead up to homosapiens. He saw a cool culture exhibit, looked at different human forms, saw an exhibit on disease, where he played an intriguing game on keeping a civilization alive, and even went into this machine that reverted his face to what he would look like if he was a homogeneous instead of a homosapien.</p><p>By the end of the first couple of hours, he forgot about his disappointment that he wasn\u2019t with his friends. Although, he really thought at least TJ would join him, but maybe that was just wishful thinking. <i>TJ is straight. He\u2019s just your friend. He doesn\u2019t have to have the same interests in you.</i> He sighed and stood back up, starting towards the ice age exhibit.</p><p>Eventually, after skimming through there, he reached a much less crowded Dinosaur exhibit. It had just recently been re-opened in the June of 2019 and had many more dinosaur skeletons added to it. In the center was a Tyrannosaurus rex fighting a Triceratops, which was interesting enough and attracted most of the viewers, but he found himself climbing the stairs to see the hanging exhibit that circled the room. \u00a0At first he enjoyed it because he could see all the new and old dinosaurs on the ground floor such as the brachiosaurus and the ankylosaurus, but then the sight of the hanging pteranodon caught his eye.</p><p>\u201cAlthough it\u2019s not an actual dinosaur it\u2019s quite magnificent isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus jumped at the voice. \u201cUh\u2026 hi?\u201d</p><p>A girl who looked to be about sixteen, the same age as him, smiled. She had long brown hair and bright blue eyes and didn\u2019t seem to have anyone with her either. \u201cSorry, hi! I\u2019m Jo. I just had seen you a couple of times at the other exhibits and because I\u2019m here by myself too I thought we could accompany each other.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 hesitation reduced. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Cyrus. All my friends don\u2019t really like this stuff so I came on my own.\u201d</p><p>Jo laughed. \u201cMe too, usually I would\u2019ve dragged my girlfriend along with me but she gets embarrassed every time I flip off the Whitehouse because Trump\u2019s an asshole.\u201d</p><p>He smiled brightly. \u201cYeah I get what you mean. So actually I\u2019m meeting my friends in about two hours, but if you want to walk around with me I\u2019d love to have someone to talk about dinosaurs with.\u201d</p><p>And with that, they continued on, testing each other\u2019s knowledge on the most obscure facts about dinosaurs.</p><p>\u2014</p><p><i>~3:15~</i></p><p>TJ was undeniably stressed. He paced back and forth in front of the steps where his equally as stressed friends sat.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s 3:15, he was supposed to be here 15 minutes ago. Where is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe <i>know</i> TJ,\u201d Buffy said, slightly irritated. \u201cLet\u2019s go look for him, we can call over the intercom at the lost child center. If he still doesn\u2019t come we\u2019ll split up and search.\u201d</p><p>It was not ten minutes later that TJ was relieved as he saw Cyrus approaching the group with a huge smile. He ran up to him and gave him a hug. \u201cThank god underdog, you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>Each friend then took a turn to embrace Cyrus. In a big city like DC with a innocent person like Cyrus, they immediately assumed the worst.</p><p>Dread soon returned to TJ though, when Cyrus smiled at the girl next to him. She was smiling at him in a way that just didn\u2019t sit right. She then leaned over and whispered into Cyrus\u2019 ear, making him blush, before handing him a paper and walking off, waving over her head.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d Jonah asked.</p><p>\u201cHer name\u2019s Jo. We ran into each other and started talking about dinosaurs. Sorry I\u2019m late.\u201d He said, faint smile on his lips. \u201cSo did you all have fun?\u201d</p><p>They fell into an easy conversation about the day but TJ remained quiet. He thought he was finally getting somewhere with Cyrus but that girl Jo\u2026</p><p>\u2014</p><p><i>~8:30~</i></p><p>Cyrus and TJ sat outside on the hotel balcony while the rest of their friends played poker inside.</p><p>Cyrus broke the silence after a moment, concerned. \u201cSo what\u2019s wrong?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeej\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust I don\u2019t like how that girl Jo was flirting with you.\u201d He quickly snapped his mouth shut, he wasn\u2019t supposed to say that.</p><p>\u201cTJ. She wasn\u2019t flirting. She\u2019s bi and has a girlfriend. Why does it matter anyways?\u201d</p><p>TJ ignored the question. \u201cSo what did she whisper to you? What made you blush? Why- Why were you so focused on her that you couldn\u2019t meet m- us? We were so worried!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what this is about? I swear TJ, I was just excited to have a new friend that loved dinosaurs as much as I do, it\u2019s rare to find them. And well\u2014 what she whispered was\u2014,\u201c his face turned red. \u201cShe said she had a season pass to the zoo that could bring 3 guests. Tomorrow she said she\u2019d bring her girlfriend and asked me to, to come with my boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>His heart dropped. <i>Cyrus. Has. A. Boyfriend.</i> \u201cY-you\u2019re boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>If Cyrus\u2019 face got any redder, TJ was sure he\u2019d pass out. \u201cWell\u2014 you see\u2014 the second part of that was for me to ask the boy I like out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO-oh. Okay. I\u2019ll let you go then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No! TJ\u2014 Er\u2014 SowouldyoupleasegooutwithmeTJbecauseIreallylikeyoubutIunderstandifyoudon\u2019tlikemesodon\u2019tfeelobligated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus inhaled deeply. \u201cI said: So would you please go out with me TJ because I really like you but I understand if you don\u2019t like me so don\u2019t feel obligated?\u201d</p><p>At this point TJ was also deep red in color. \u201cI\u2014 yes? I like you too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026 are we boyfriends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhh. Sure.\u201d</p><p>TJ, shocked at the fact that Cyrus actually said yes to the kiss, leaned in too quickly and mashed their faces together roughly before springing away not a second later.</p><p>Awkward? Yep. Sparks? Definitely.</p><p>And right then, they knew they\u2019d be together for a long, long time.<br/></p>",

In the center was a Tyrannosaurus rex fighting a Triceratops, which was interesting enough and attracted most of the viewers, but he found himself climbing the stairs to see the hanging exhibit that circled the room. \u00a0At first he enjoyed it because he could see all the new and old dinosaurs on the ground floor such as the brachiosaurus and the ankylosaurus, but then the sight of the hanging pteranodon caught his eye.</p><p>\u201cAlthough it\u2019s not an actual dinosaur it\u2019s quite magnificent isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus jumped at the voice. \u201cUh\u2026 hi?\u201d</p><p>A girl who looked to be about sixteen, the same age as him, smiled. She had long brown hair and bright blue eyes and didn\u2019t seem to have anyone with her either. \u201cSorry, hi! I\u2019m Jo. I just had seen you a couple of times at the other exhibits and because I\u2019m here by myself too I thought we could accompany each other.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 hesitation reduced. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Cyrus. All my friends don\u2019t really like this stuff so I came on my own.\u201d</p><p>Jo laughed. \u201cMe too, usually I would\u2019ve dragged my girlfriend along with me but she gets embarrassed every time I flip off the Whitehouse because Trump\u2019s an asshole.\u201d</p><p>He smiled brightly. \u201cYeah I get what you mean. So actually I\u2019m meeting my friends in about two hours, but if you want to walk around with me I\u2019d love to have someone to talk about dinosaurs with.\u201d</p><p>And with that, they continued on, testing each other\u2019s knowledge on the most obscure facts about dinosaurs.</p><p>\u2014</p><p><i>~3:15~</i></p><p>TJ was undeniably stressed. He paced back and forth in front of the steps where his equally as stressed friends sat.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s 3:15, he was supposed to be here 15 minutes ago. Where is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe <i>know</i> TJ,\u201d Buffy said, slightly irritated. \u201cLet\u2019s go look for him, we can call over the intercom at the lost child center. If he still doesn\u2019t come we\u2019ll split up and search.\u201d</p><p>It was not ten minutes later that TJ was relieved as he saw Cyrus approaching the group with a huge smile. He ran up to him and gave him a hug. \u201cThank god underdog, you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>Each friend then took a turn to embrace Cyrus. In a big city like DC with a innocent person like Cyrus, they immediately assumed the worst.</p><p>Dread soon returned to TJ though, when Cyrus smiled at the girl next to him. She was smiling at him in a way that just didn\u2019t sit right. She then leaned over and whispered into Cyrus\u2019 ear, making him blush, before handing him a paper and walking off, waving over her head.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d Jonah asked.</p><p>\u201cHer name\u2019s Jo. We ran into each other and started talking about dinosaurs. Sorry I\u2019m late.\u201d He said, faint smile on his lips. \u201cSo did you all have fun?\u201d</p><p>They fell into an easy conversation about the day but TJ remained quiet. He thought he was finally getting somewhere with Cyrus but that girl Jo\u2026</p><p>\u2014</p><p><i>~8:30~</i></p><p>Cyrus and TJ sat outside on the hotel balcony while the rest of their friends played poker inside.</p><p>Cyrus broke the silence after a moment, concerned. \u201cSo what\u2019s wrong?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeej\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust I don\u2019t like how that girl Jo was flirting with you.\u201d He quickly snapped his mouth shut, he wasn\u2019t supposed to say that.</p><p>\u201cTJ. She wasn\u2019t flirting. She\u2019s bi and has a girlfriend. Why does it matter anyways?\u201d</p><p>TJ ignored the question. \u201cSo what did she whisper to you? What made you blush? Why- Why were you so focused on her that you couldn\u2019t meet m- us? We were so worried!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what this is about? I swear TJ, I was just excited to have a new friend that loved dinosaurs as much as I do, it\u2019s rare to find them. And well\u2014 what she whispered was\u2014,\u201c his face turned red. \u201cShe said she had a season pass to the zoo that could bring 3 guests. Tomorrow she said she\u2019d bring her girlfriend and asked me to, to come with my boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>His heart dropped. <i>Cyrus. Has. A. Boyfriend.</i> \u201cY-you\u2019re boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>If Cyrus\u2019 face got any redder, TJ was sure he\u2019d pass out. \u201cWell\u2014 you see\u2014 the second part of that was for me to ask the boy I like out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO-oh. Okay. I\u2019ll let you go then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No!

They\u2019re aged up to 16 btw.</p><p>___________________________</p><p><br></p><p>It was a fairly windy day when Cyrus had decided to go to the National Museum of Natural History. Their school had a chance to take a week long trip to DC and after the first day of boring history lessons, they were free to roam in groups of three or more. So, because it was his turn to choose their daily excursion, he had rounded up Andi, Buffy, Marty, Jonah, and TJ and dragged them to the large white building.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious guys, it\u2019s so cool! Theres so many different exhibits and it\u2019s free too,\u201d he explained. </p><p>Andi, who was not too thrilled to be separated from her girlfriend stepped in. \u201cI\u2019m sure it is, but it\u2019s a <i>history museum</i>, we spent <i>all day</i> yesterday learning about history! I\u2019d rather just call Amber.\u201d</p><p>Jonah ignored her comment and instead said, \u201cAfterwards do you want to go to the Air and Space museum? It\u2019s open until 6 today and I hear the planetarium is totally cool.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus, now looking at his friend, now realized none looked too excited at the prospect of spending their day looking at fossils. \u201cActually, I kinda wanted to visit alone, you know, really take my time looking at everything in peace, so you all can go do your own thing and we\u2019ll meet back here at 3. Does that sound good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure, Underdog?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus looked at TJ in the eyes for a moment and smiled. \u201cYeah, totally.\u201d</p><p>And soon enough, he was alone again. TJ joined Buffy and Marty in their race to see all the monuments, Andi went to the Renwick while FaceTiming Amber, and Jonah went to the Air and Space Museum to see the movies in the planetarium. So, checking through security and taking out his camera, Cyrus entered the building with a little bit of sadness but mostly excitement.</p><p>He decided to go from bottom to top so as he walked past the wooly mammoth he descended the stairs to look at the bird exhibit. It made him slightly uncomfortable seeing all the stuffed birds, but nevertheless it was fascinating. As he approached the main floor which he had entered on, he was met with many choices for exploration. Seeing as the dinosaur exhibit was crowded, he decided to save that for last and entered the Mammal exhibit.</p><p>Like the birds, seeing so many stuffed animals was slightly uncomfortable but it was still neat. He even got to watch a short video on the Morganucodon (not minding it was a video aimed at younger audiences) which explained the evolution of modern mammals from that small shrew-like creature. Then he moved to the Ocean exhibit, their was giant skeletons of prehistoric aquatic animals and even the jaw of a megalodon which was an ancient shark that was over two times the size of a great white, and could fit a family of five people whole in it\u2019s mouth.</p><p>Then he was lead to the human exhibit, he walked through this cool light tunnel that showed all previous variations of human that lead up to homosapiens. He saw a cool culture exhibit, looked at different human forms, saw an exhibit on disease, where he played an intriguing game on keeping a civilization alive, and even went into this machine that reverted his face to what he would look like if he was a homogeneous instead of a homosapien.</p><p>By the end of the first couple of hours, he forgot about his disappointment that he wasn\u2019t with his friends. Although, he really thought at least TJ would join him, but maybe that was just wishful thinking. <i>TJ is straight. He\u2019s just your friend. He doesn\u2019t have to have the same interests in you.</i> He sighed and stood back up, starting towards the ice age exhibit.</p><p>Eventually, after skimming through there, he reached a much less crowded Dinosaur exhibit. It had just recently been re-opened in the June of 2019 and had many more dinosaur skeletons added to it.

If he still doesn&rsquo;t come we&rsquo;ll split up and search.&rdquo;</p><p>It was not ten minutes later that TJ was relieved as he saw Cyrus approaching the group with a huge smile. He ran up to him and gave him a hug. &ldquo;Thank god underdog, you&rsquo;re safe.&rdquo;</p><p>Each friend then took a turn to embrace Cyrus. In a big city like DC with a innocent person like Cyrus, they immediately assumed the worst.</p><p>Dread soon returned to TJ though, when Cyrus smiled at the girl next to him. She was smiling at him in a way that just didn&rsquo;t sit right. She then leaned over and whispered into Cyrus&rsquo; ear, making him blush, before handing him a paper and walking off, waving over her head.</p><p>&ldquo;Who was that?&rdquo; Jonah asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Her name&rsquo;s Jo. We ran into each other and started talking about dinosaurs. Sorry I&rsquo;m late.&rdquo; He said, faint smile on his lips. &ldquo;So did you all have fun?&rdquo;</p><p>They fell into an easy conversation about the day but TJ remained quiet. He thought he was finally getting somewhere with Cyrus but that girl Jo&hellip;</p><p>&mdash;</p><p><i>~8:30~</i></p><p>Cyrus and TJ sat outside on the hotel balcony while the rest of their friends played poker inside.</p><p>Cyrus broke the silence after a moment, concerned. &ldquo;So what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about. I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Teej&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just I don&rsquo;t like how that girl Jo was flirting with you.&rdquo; He quickly snapped his mouth shut, he wasn&rsquo;t supposed to say that.</p><p>&ldquo;TJ. She wasn&rsquo;t flirting. She&rsquo;s bi and has a girlfriend. Why does it matter anyways?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ ignored the question. &ldquo;So what did she whisper to you? What made you blush? Why- Why were you so focused on her that you couldn&rsquo;t meet m- us? We were so worried!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that what this is about? I swear TJ, I was just excited to have a new friend that loved dinosaurs as much as I do, it&rsquo;s rare to find them. And well&mdash; what she whispered was&mdash;,&ldquo; his face turned red. &ldquo;She said she had a season pass to the zoo that could bring 3 guests. Tomorrow she said she&rsquo;d bring her girlfriend and asked me to, to come with my boyfriend.&rdquo;</p><p>His heart dropped. <i>Cyrus. Has. A. Boyfriend.</i> &ldquo;Y-you&rsquo;re boyfriend?&rdquo;</p><p>If Cyrus&rsquo; face got any redder, TJ was sure he&rsquo;d pass out. &ldquo;Well&mdash; you see&mdash; the second part of that was for me to ask the boy I like out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;O-oh. Okay. I&rsquo;ll let you go then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? No! TJ&mdash; Er&mdash; SowouldyoupleasegooutwithmeTJbecauseIreallylikeyoubutIunderstandifyoudon&rsquo;tlikemesodon&rsquo;tfeelobligated?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus inhaled deeply. &ldquo;I said: So would you please go out with me TJ because I really like you but I understand if you don&rsquo;t like me so don&rsquo;t feel obligated?&rdquo;</p><p>At this point TJ was also deep red in color. &ldquo;I&mdash; yes? I like you too!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cool!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cool.</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip; are we boyfriends?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cool.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Can I kiss you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uhh. Sure.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ, shocked at the fact that Cyrus actually said yes to the kiss, leaned in too quickly and mashed their faces together roughly before springing away not a second later.</p><p>Awkward? Yep. Sparks? Definitely.</p><p>And right then, they knew they&rsquo;d be together for a long, long time.<br /></p>",

But the main question is, will Disney relay on their ratings (which is fairly low, as opposed to other seasons) to keep this show going even after getting backlash for having a gay relationship in a \u201ckid show\u201d?</p>",
                "content": "<p>ok this is the opening for my semester project in english, please give me correction if you can! :)</p><hr /><p>The Walt Disney Corporation is the second biggest network in the world, which holds a big, diverse audience.</p><p>Every couple of years, Disney produces a groundbreaking TV show, for example, &ldquo;Lizzie McGuire&rdquo; (2001) and &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so raven&rdquo; (2003). Moreover, on&nbsp; April 7, 2016, a new series from the creator of &ldquo;Lizzie McGuire&rdquo; was premiered. The series touched on many important topics such as gun control, Asian culture, Jewish culture (more exclusively, bar mitzvah&rsquo;s), teen pregnancy, anxiety, toxic relationships, dress code, military families, a gay storyline and more will be produced. <br />As on November 27th, 2018, Disney holds an opportunity of giving a Jewish, gay teen a boyfriend. However, will Disney take the easy way out and will just leave it as subtext? Alternatively, will they take a leap of faith and go forward with this storyline?<br /> As a person and an activist, I find myself obligated to try to get a good representation for all groups in society. I feel like it is necessary to encourage a change, especially in such big media like Disney channel.
