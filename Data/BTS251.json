As we move closer, we can hear the music and people talking down the hall. The cafeteria isn\u2019t max full but there\u2019s a lot of people. I glance around the room and spot Jackson\u2019s white hair. We maneuver through the crowd until Jeongin spots us and runs up.</p><p>\u201cYou came!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course i did.\u201d I smiled\u00a0\u201cHello everyone! How\u2019s the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was going great until Twice kept bothering them.\u201d Bam Bam looked overly annoyed\u00a0\u201cThey just kept coming. One would get sent away and another would come in her place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m here now. Hopefully they\u2019ll leave you alone.\u201d I sigh and sit next to JB\u00a0\u201cSo meet any new trainees?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, there\u2019s a lot of them here actually. The only actual groups here are Us, DAY6 and Twice.\u201d Jinyoung says\u00a0\u201cJYP probably just wanted some familiar faces around.\u201d</p><p>The group disburst some leaving me, Jimin, Jeongin, Seungmin and Han at the table. Jeongin, Seungmin and Han eventually left when they played\u00a0\u2018If You Do\u2019 by Got7, they long with Got7 did a couple of there dances for the crowd.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI knew we\u2019d eventually end up coming.\u201d Jimin pulls me into his lap\u00a0\u201cYour such a perfect mom to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it is my job basically.\u201d I smile\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re all like my children and it\u2019s my job to protect them.\u201d We say like that and talk until i feel someone watching me. I look around and see Jihyo and Tzuyu giving me the dirtiest of looks. <b>[The hell\u2019s wrong with them.]</b> I bring my attention back to Jimin and run my hands through his hair.\u00a0</p><p>The night goes on really well, me and Jimin stand up and walk around. Fans of BTS saw Jimin and wanted a picture and to talk. I left him to do that and walked around myself until I saw Seungmin and Han over by the food. They were joking with each other until Dahyun and Chaeyoung walked up to them. I stayed back a little just to see what they\u2019s do. The girls were talking and what not, the boys seemed to not mind but Chaeyoung got a little too close to Seungmin for mine and his liking.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh hello Dahyun and Chaeyoung.\u201d I walk over and smile\u00a0\u201cHow\u2019s your night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Dahyun answers\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t know you\u2019d come as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was invited here by JYP since I take care of these lovely boys of mine.\u201d I look at Seungmin and Han\u00a0\u201cAre they bothering you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I\u2019ve never seen Han look anything but happy and to see him look irritated made me sad\u00a0\u201cI just wanted something to drink and here they come. Don\u2019t you two have something to do other than bother us all night? Make you look desperate.\u201d</p><p>I had to hold back my laughter\u00a0\u201cYou heard him, walk away.\u201d</p><p>Dahyun gives me an apologetic look before dragging a red Chaeyoung away,\u00a0\u201cHan omg where did that come from?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs\u00a0\u201cI think I\u2019ve been hanging with Hyunjin to much. Was I a little too harsh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo baby, that was perfect.\u201d I hug him and Seungmin\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m going to go find the rest.\u201d</p><p>The others were on the dance floor, except for Hyunjin who walked off the same floor to sit down. As I made my way, someone grabbed my arm&hellip; it was just Jimin.</p><p>\u201cYou scared me.\u201d I hug him \u201cSorry for wondering off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry,\u201d he slowly rocks me to the beat of the music \u201cI should be sorry for letting them take my attention away from you. Did you manage to find all the boys?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, they\u2019re all out dancing now.\u201d I look back at Hyunjin who\u2019s on his phone \u201cI was going to go talk with Hyunjin.\u201d </p><p>We held hands and walked off the dance floor, that\u2019s when Tzuyu(?) sat next to him. [please control yourself] I slowed our pace a little to watch what happens. She was literally all over him, clearly he was annoyed to the max but I couldn\u2019t but in just yet. I know he can handle himself, but I\u2019m not sure if I can handle what I\u2019m feeling. I lost it when she grabbed his face, I let Jimin\u2019s hand go and stomped over.</p><p>I knocked her hand off his face and she stood up \u201cWhat do you think your doing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh why is your mother here.\u201d Her voice full of sass \u201cGo away grandma, I\u2019m busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare touch him again!\u201d I got in between them \u201cYou and your group have been bothering my boys all night and I\u2019m sick of it. Just like Han said you are all desperate!\u201d </p><p>\u201cReally, says the one who was all in Jimin Oppas lap earlier.\u201d She crosses her arms \u201cIf that\u2019s not desperate then I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d </p><p>\u201cC-Come on Noona!\u201d Hyunjin held my hand \u201cThey aren\u2019t worth it. Me and Jimin will gather everyone, go sit in the car yah.\u201d </p><p>I took a deep breath and agreed, I told their manager that their leaving and to have the car ready. I went to go sit in Jimin\u2019s car, still fuming. Moments later, Jimin brought Jeongin and Hyunjin to the car. He opened my door and pulled me into a hug. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right..right?\u201d I whisper </p><p>\u201cRight about what?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMe being.. d-desperate?\u201d</p><p>He pulls away and looks me in the eyes \u201cNo, she was mad because you protected your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah don\u2019t listen to that she devil.\u201d Hyunjin says from in the car </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get them home.\u201d</p><p>We drive home in silence, everyone waited for us to get out of his car and to our floor. Me and Jimin hug once more before he disappeared into in apartment. They boys and I walked up the stairs, I bid everyone a goodnight and went straight to my room.  Flopped on my bed. <b>[Desprate&hellip;me? No&hellip;never!]  </b>my phone pings and it\u2019s Jimin.</p><p><b><span class=\"npf_color_rachel\">MochiBooty</span></b>\u2764\ufe0f: I know your thinking what Tzuyu said but your far from desprate.

We&rsquo;re hangin with Got7 and Day6 right now.&rdquo; He sounds a little annoyed i think</p><p>&ldquo;Hyunjin, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Twice, they won&rsquo;t leave Jeongin, Han and Felix alone.&rdquo;He lets out a frustrated grunt&nbsp;&ldquo;Its freaking annoying.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Right here. Literally Got7 and Day6 are like our bodyguards, they shoo them away. Oh, Han wants to talk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi Noona I miss you!&rdquo; Han&rsquo;s voice is loud and cheery&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you having fun with Jimin?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I miss you too Han love.&rdquo; I smile&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes I am having fun Han. Are you having fun?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, kind of.&rdquo; His voice quiets down&nbsp;&ldquo;The girls in Twice won&rsquo;t go away. They keep trying to flirt with us. It&rsquo;s a little creepy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Bang Chan?&rdquo; I ask&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Uhh, talking with JYP hyung.&rdquo; Here&rsquo;s a small pause&nbsp;&ldquo;Can you and Jimin hyung come? Maybe they&rsquo;ll go away if you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No you stay there Jenni!&rdquo; I can here Hyunjin in the background&nbsp;&ldquo;Well actually, can you? I want to go mingle with people and I can&rsquo;t because these pesky twigs want to flirt.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hyunjin!&rdquo; Me and Jimin start laughing&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there shortly okay. Bye.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s something isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, would you want to come?&rdquo; I turn my body to face him&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; He stands up&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drive us.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<b>At JYP&mdash;</b></p><p>When we arrive, the receptionist tells us it&rsquo;s in the cafeteria. As we move closer, we can hear the music and people talking down the hall. The cafeteria isn&rsquo;t max full but there&rsquo;s a lot of people. I glance around the room and spot Jackson&rsquo;s white hair. We maneuver through the crowd until Jeongin spots us and runs up.</p><p>&ldquo;You came!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course i did.&rdquo; I smiled&nbsp;&ldquo;Hello everyone! How&rsquo;s the night?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was going great until Twice kept bothering them.&rdquo; Bam Bam looked overly annoyed&nbsp;&ldquo;They just kept coming. One would get sent away and another would come in her place.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m here now. Hopefully they&rsquo;ll leave you alone.&rdquo; I sigh and sit next to JB&nbsp;&ldquo;So meet any new trainees?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of them here actually. The only actual groups here are Us, DAY6 and Twice.&rdquo; Jinyoung says&nbsp;&ldquo;JYP probably just wanted some familiar faces around.&rdquo;</p><p>The group disburst some leaving me, Jimin, Jeongin, Seungmin and Han at the table. Jeongin, Seungmin and Han eventually left when they played&nbsp;&lsquo;If You Do&rsquo; by Got7, they long with Got7 did a couple of there dances for the crowd.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I knew we&rsquo;d eventually end up coming.&rdquo; Jimin pulls me into his lap&nbsp;&ldquo;Your such a perfect mom to them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it is my job basically.&rdquo; I smile&nbsp;&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all like my children and it&rsquo;s my job to protect them.&rdquo; We say like that and talk until i feel someone watching me. I look around and see Jihyo and Tzuyu giving me the dirtiest of looks. <b>[The hell&rsquo;s wrong with them.]</b> I bring my attention back to Jimin and run my hands through his hair.&nbsp;</p><p>The night goes on really well, me and Jimin stand up and walk around. Fans of BTS saw Jimin and wanted a picture and to talk. I left him to do that and walked around myself until I saw Seungmin and Han over by the food. They were joking with each other until Dahyun and Chaeyoung walked up to them. I stayed back a little just to see what they&rsquo;s do. The girls were talking and what not, the boys seemed to not mind but Chaeyoung got a little too close to Seungmin for mine and his liking.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh hello Dahyun and Chaeyoung.&rdquo; I walk over and smile&nbsp;&ldquo;How&rsquo;s your night?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; Dahyun answers&nbsp;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;d come as well?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was invited here by JYP since I take care of these lovely boys of mine.&rdquo; I look at Seungmin and Han&nbsp;&ldquo;Are they bothering you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve never seen Han look anything but happy and to see him look irritated made me sad&nbsp;&ldquo;I just wanted something to drink and here they come. Don&rsquo;t you two have something to do other than bother us all night? Make you look desperate.&rdquo;</p><p>I had to hold back my laughter&nbsp;&ldquo;You heard him, walk away.&rdquo;</p><p>Dahyun gives me an apologetic look before dragging a red Chaeyoung away,&nbsp;&ldquo;Han omg where did that come from?&rdquo;</p><p>He shrugs&nbsp;&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve been hanging with Hyunjin to much. Was I a little too harsh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No baby, that was perfect.&rdquo; I hug him and Seungmin&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go find the rest.&rdquo;</p><p>The others were on the dance floor, except for Hyunjin who walked off the same floor to sit down. As I made my way, someone grabbed my arm&hellip; it was just Jimin.</p><p>&ldquo;You scared me.&rdquo; I hug him &ldquo;Sorry for wondering off.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be sorry,&rdquo; he slowly rocks me to the beat of the music &ldquo;I should be sorry for letting them take my attention away from you. Did you manage to find all the boys?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, they&rsquo;re all out dancing now.&rdquo; I look back at Hyunjin who&rsquo;s on his phone &ldquo;I was going to go talk with Hyunjin.&rdquo; </p><p>We held hands and walked off the dance floor, that&rsquo;s when Tzuyu(?) sat next to him. [please control yourself] I slowed our pace a little to watch what happens. She was literally all over him, clearly he was annoyed to the max but I couldn&rsquo;t but in just yet. I know he can handle himself, but I&rsquo;m not sure if I can handle what I&rsquo;m feeling. I lost it when she grabbed his face, I let Jimin&rsquo;s hand go and stomped over.</p><p>I knocked her hand off his face and she stood up &ldquo;What do you think your doing!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh why is your mother here.&rdquo; Her voice full of sass &ldquo;Go away grandma, I&rsquo;m busy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare touch him again!&rdquo; I got in between them &ldquo;You and your group have been bothering my boys all night and I&rsquo;m sick of it. Just like Han said you are all desperate!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Really, says the one who was all in Jimin Oppas lap earlier.&rdquo; She crosses her arms &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s not desperate then I don&rsquo;t know what is.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;C-Come on Noona!&rdquo; Hyunjin held my hand &ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t worth it. Me and Jimin will gather everyone, go sit in the car yah.&rdquo; </p><p>I took a deep breath and agreed, I told their manager that their leaving and to have the car ready. I went to go sit in Jimin&rsquo;s car, still fuming. Moments later, Jimin brought Jeongin and Hyunjin to the car. He opened my door and pulled me into a hug. </p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s right..right?&rdquo; I whisper </p><p>&ldquo;Right about what?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Me being.. d-desperate?&rdquo;</p><p>He pulls away and looks me in the eyes &ldquo;No, she was mad because you protected your brother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah don&rsquo;t listen to that she devil.&rdquo; Hyunjin says from in the car </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get them home.&rdquo;</p><p>We drive home in silence, everyone waited for us to get out of his car and to our floor. Me and Jimin hug once more before he disappeared into in apartment. They boys and I walked up the stairs, I bid everyone a goodnight and went straight to my room.  Flopped on my bed. <b>[Desprate&hellip;me? No&hellip;never!]  </b>my phone pings and it&rsquo;s Jimin.</p><p><b><span class=\"npf_color_rachel\">MochiBooty</span></b>&#10084;&#65039;: I know your thinking what Tzuyu said but your far from desprate. Your an amazing woman and I&rsquo;m super happy I&rsquo;ve gotten to know you. If anything I&rsquo;m desprate for your attention&#128149; we should hang out again tomorrow when the boys go to practice, we have the day off. Only if you don&rsquo;t mind. </p><p><b><span class=\"npf_color_rachel\">MochiBooty</span></b>&#10084;&#65039;: Have a wonder slumber.

Neither of you truly wanted to allow the truth of your situation to seep in to the fantasy land you had created for yourselves of the rooftop that night, but it seemed foolish to wholly deny it for much longer.</p><p>\u201cThree days.\u201d A pained expression crossed your face as if you had been punched in the stomach and you could see your sadness reflected in Taehyung\u2019s eyes. \u201cDo you want to know why I\u2019m here?\u201d His question sounded strained, forced, as if he were following cue cards that he wasn\u2019t convinced were for him to read, and you felt apprehension begin to creep up from your stomach.</p><p>\u201cBecause you wanted to see me?\u201d Your eyes were full of hope, but your tone was playfully flippant, as you tried to skirt around the significance of the question. You knew all too well he wasn\u2019t talking about the reason for his presence at the bar.</p><p>He dropped his gaze and shook his head, smiling softly. \u201cNot here,\u201d he clarified, cupping the side of your face with his large hand before sweeping it towards the lit up skyline to clarify. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>You had suspected there was something unusual about the situation with Taehyung, none of it had really made sense \u2013 from the luxurious hotel suite to the bemused man you had met in that same room who had threatened to call the police. You had merely pushed it to the back if your mind, simply grateful for his kindness and his company, before becoming completely entranced by his deep voice and perfect face. By the time it had occurred to you to be curious about the reason for his presence, you were already alone on the roof top of your bar, coming down from the high of your second kiss. \u201cDo you want to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered instantly but said nothing else, meeting your eyes with an intense gaze once more, and you knew he meant for you to see the sincerity there. \u201c<i>Chinshim</i>.\u201d He drew his knees up to his chest and dropped his forehead to rest on them, letting out a deep groan.</p><!-- more --><p>You mirrored his posture, clasping your hands around your shins, only vaguely wondering what the word he had breathed out meant as you stared out to the limited view of the skyline. \u201cAre you in some sort of trouble?\u201d In your periphery you saw him turn his face to you, his expression confused, with his cheek still leaning on his knees. \u201cLike&hellip;are you&hellip;on the run? From the police or something?\u201d You knew it was an absurd question as soon as the words left your mouth, and you rolled your eyes at yourself before scrunching them shut tightly as if willing the past thirty seconds out of existence.</p><p>He lifted his head, his deep brown eyes wide as he took in what you had asked. \u201cOn the run&hellip;police?\u201d Your eyes remained firmly closed and it felt like an age passed before you heard him breathe in fully before a throaty laugh, higher pitched than you had expected, burst forth from his lips against the silence of the night that surrounded you. \u201cYou would be okay with it? <i>Chincha</i>!\u201d he stuttered out between spasms of laughter.</p><p>You pouted and nudged him with your shoulder playfully, \u201cNo, I just&hellip;\u201d You didn\u2019t know what on earth made you ask that, but the need to hazard a guess had been too powerful. However your embarrassment dissipated as soon as you realised how enchanted you were by the sound of his laughter, and you found yourself giggling along with him, such was the contagious nature of the sound, and the tension in the air broken even if just momentarily.</p><p>\u201cYou like me that much?\u201d he asked, his laughter slowing as he inhaled deeply to stabilise his breathing, and he turned his body slightly to drape his arm around your shoulder once more, pulling you gently to his side and dropping a kiss to the top of your head. You felt his chest expand beneath your fingers and lifted your gaze to look up at him, watching as his mouth opened to speak but no sound followed the movement. You saw him raise his eyes upwards as if searching the stars for the appropriate words. \u201cI&rsquo;m here for&hellip;ah <i>jeongmal</i>.\u201d he let out another laugh, laced with embarrassment and just a little bitterness. He tried once more, \u201cI\u2019m here&hellip;\u201d</p><p>You lifted your chin, craning your neck so you could meet his eyes, your hand moving to rest against his defined jaw, your thumb stroking just below his cheekbone, stilling his movements. \u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d You repeated, hoping that he understood that that was the only thing that mattered to you right then. His struggle with the words worried you, and you were all of a sudden totally against having him tell you. He met your eyes and unflinchingly stared in to them as if he might find the right words there, their intensity once again knocking the wind from you. You leant upwards a little further to close the gap between your mouths, your eyes fluttering closed as your lips pressed against one another\u2019s in a sweet kiss.</p><p>It would have been a lie to say you weren\u2019t curious about his reasons for coming to your part of the world \u2013 which until the day before you had been entirely certain that no one outside of the county, let alone the country, would ever bother travelling to \u2013 but you didn\u2019t want to ruin the limited time you had together when the subject was clearly so difficult for him to talk about. It would also be dishonest of you to claim that you weren\u2019t a little disappointed that he hadn\u2019t tried to suggest any means of keeping in touch. You pushed that feeling as far away as you could manage, wishing only to savour the moments as they were happening. He would be there for another three days yet, and you had already gotten so close in just over one. There was plenty of time for deciding where this may or may not be heading, right? You opted instead to focus only on the feel of Taehyung\u2019s arms as they tightened around you and his warm lips gently pushing against yours.</p><p>A siren sounded once more and you broke away from the kiss, suddenly aware that the night had grown a little colder, and you pulled up the blanket which had fallen back around your shoulders as you nestled again in to his chest, lifting his arm to drag it back around you, to which he chuckled briefly before humming contentedly. \u201cAh,\u201d you heard him say out of nowhere after a minute or so, and you felt rather than saw him reach for his phone. In the quiet you could hear his fingers tapping against the screen, until you heard soft music begin to play from the small yet effective speakers on his handset.</p><p>You each remained motionless but for the gentle stroking of his fingers through your hair and the soothing pattern of your synchronised breaths for the duration of a number of songs, and you felt your eyelids begin to get heavy. You fought against the fatigue that was threatening to overcome you, reluctant to allow sleep steal time from you both, although you knew it would ultimately be a losing battle.</p><p>You had been surprised to find that you were familiar with most of the music Taehyung had been playing, and you enjoyed listening to him singing along to parts of each song which he knew best. You noted that his singing voice was startlingly impressive, pleasant even in its hushed, breathy tones. Where he didn\u2019t know the words he hummed along to the melody softly and tapped his free hand against his leg, seemingly swept away entirely in the music.</p><p>Finally a song began to play that you did not recognise, and it was the first he had played that was in Korean. It was a beautifully simplistic composition, the subtle plucking and strumming of an acoustic guitar a perfect accompaniment to the lilting melody, and even though you couldn\u2019t understand the meaning of the words \u2013 save for the odd English phrase \u2013 you found yourself completely moved by it. It was almost like a lullaby, and he knew the lyrics well and sang them confidently, occasionally pulling you tighter to him as he did so, and despite your efforts you felt yourself slipping in to slumber. You were vaguely aware of your body leaning in to his more heavily as sleep finally took you, and just before you could no longer open your eyes, you thought you felt a single drop of warm rain fall on to the bare skin of your hand which still rested on his chest.</p><p>~~~</p><p>Before he joined you in sleep, he thought about the bullet he had dodged when you had clearly given him an out as far as the truth of his presence was concerned. He had no inkling as to how he should have approached the situation with you. Whenever he opened his mouth to tell you everything, the absurdity of it had hit him, and he was reminded once again of the implausibility of your relationship \u2013 if it could even be called such a thing \u2013 progressing any further than the time he was here.</p><p>He had never uttered the words &lsquo;I\u2019m in an idol group&rsquo; before, he never had any need to, as the majority of the time people already knew exactly who he was before he even opened his mouth. He tried to work out if it would be preferable for you to be one of those girls who were more than aware of his identity. It certainly would have made things simpler, not needing to try to articulate the actuality of his circumstances in a way that didn\u2019t sound far-fetched or boastful. Would you even know what an idol group was? He was more than aware that the concept of idols could very well be as foreign to you as his language was.</p><p>The fact of the matter was that in all the time he had spent with you, as brief though it may have been in the grand scheme of things, you had made him feel so utterly normal that the truth of his occupation had seemed somewhat preposterous in your presence. The closeness you had been able to cultivate so rapidly, the palpable desire for one another dragging you towards each other almost involuntarily, that was the extraordinary thing he wanted you to dumbfounded by \u2013 as he was \u2013 not his celebrity status. Not that he believed for a second that you would have been swayed either way by such a factor, he just felt as though the time limit had indubitably passed where it could be dropped in to the conversation in anything resembling a natural fashion.</p><p>As your body begin to relax and become heavier against his side, he could feel you trying to jerk yourself awake, succeeding for only a few moments before your head began to droop again, and he smiled as he pressed his lips into the hair at the crown of your head. One of his favourite songs began to play, and he congratulated himself on his playlist selection as he sang along to the lyrics and felt the meaning of the words so strongly it was as if he was hearing them for the first time. He tightened his arm around your shoulders both to keep you warm and to keep you as close to him as possible while he was still able. As the song drew to a close he was surprised to feel hot tears threatening to spill on to his cheeks, and before he could wipe his eyes with his free hand, a single tear rolled down his face and dropped from the sharp line of his jaw.</p><p>~~~</p><p>He finally woke just as the sun was beginning to rise, just at that point of dawn when the sun\u2019s dim light casts the landscape in an otherworldly glow. Somehow in the night you had both shifted slightly lower, although you were still resting in the crook of his arm, your face turned slightly upwards so he could clearly see your eyelashes resting on your cheeks, your lips slightly parted. The air remained mild, but there was a slight morning chill which had rendered the flesh of your face ice-cold against his skin. Taehyung carefully removed his arm from around your frame, lifting your head gingerly before lowering it on to his folded up coat. He rubbed his palms together to heat his fingers before shuffling down to lie on his side to face you, and raised his hands to press them against your cheeks to warm them, trying not to laugh aloud at the way your face scrunched up at the unexpected contact.</p><p>After a few moments, satisfied he had taken the edge away from the cold, he pulled the blankets up to his own chin, then arranged them about your shoulders to keep the warmth in the fleece cocoon he had created for you both. He raised his arm to lean his head against it and found himself amused by the minute changes in your expression as the breeze moved errant strands of hair to tickle against you. He delicately pushed back the offending hair and smiled fondly as you seemed to try and nuzzle your head in to his hand the way a cat might.</p><p>He returned his arm to the confines of the blanket and rested his hand lightly just above the dip of your waist and closed his eyes again, his face a picture of contentment as he closed his eyes and wiggled his way down further in to the covers, opening his eyes again \u2013 just for a second \u2013 almost as if he were checking that you were still there.</p><p>The thought suddenly occurred to him that this was the first time he had seen you in daylight, and he was struck with an urge to kiss you as a means of marking the occasion, even if it were only for his benefit. He moved to press a kiss to your forehead, but as he shifted the blankets to bring his body closer to yours, the fleece corner covering your shoulder slipped to the ground. Taehyung\u2019s attention was abruptly pulled to the bare skin the movement had exposed, and any innocent thoughts he may have been entertaining were instantaneously overcome by an intense want. The satin shirt had shifted in sleep, making it appear as though it had been pushed from your shoulders in some passionate embrace.</p><p>He was all at once dizzy with the urge to graze his teeth open-mouthed along the curve of your shoulder, to have his tongue swipe briefly against it. He wanted to drag the rest of the shirt down, and he could almost envision his trembling fingers grasping the material to present more to his eyes, his lips, his teeth. A brief image flashed in his mind of his one of his hands curled, gripped around that shoulder, the other placed on the small of your naked back as you arched and moaned his name and \u2013</p><p>Your eyes bore in to his. \u201cTaehyung?\u201d You breathed out his name as a question and he could only imagine what he must look like to you. He could feel his mouth was agape as his eyes fixated on your bare skin and dishevelled clothes, and he averted his gaze from you swiftly, suddenly bashful.</p><p>\u201cI&hellip;sorry&hellip; \u201d Still unable to meet your eyes he reached towards you without looking and attempted to adjust the shirt so it covered you again and buried his face in to his arm, groaning in embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung,\u201d you repeated. He could hear you were closer and he opened his eyes to find you leaning over him, your eyes roaming over his face as though you were trying to commit it to memory.</p><p>He watched entranced as you lowered your face to his, pausing briefly as your lips were mere centimetres apart, flicking your eyes upwards to meet his gaze, before closing the distance and pressing your lips together, waves of arousal coursing through his veins like electric currents at the contact. He let you take the lead, still wary that you had caught him brazenly gawking at you and reluctant to approach any lines that you weren\u2019t ready to cross.</p><p>Any concern he may have had about your willingness to progress things further were quickly assuaged as you grabbed the collar of his t-shirt and pulled him forcefully in to a seated position, continuing to kiss him passionately as you did so, gripping his face between your hands as you took his bottom lip between yours and sucked lightly, swinging one of your legs over both of his and seating yourself over his thighs.</p><p>You broke away from the kiss abruptly, and Taehyung found himself chasing your lips with his own as you sat back on your haunches, meeting his eyes again fiercely as you slipped the satin shirt from your shoulders. As you discarded the garment behind you, he stared \u2013 awestruck \u2013 as you reached slowly towards the strap on your left shoulder and hooked your thumb beneath it, dragging the thin material down and biting gently down on your bottom lip.</p><p>Whatever restraint Taehyung was held back by finally snapped, and he lurched forward to crush his chest against yours, stretching upwards to meet your lips, kissing you harder than he had before, muffled grunts spilling forth from his throat against your mouth. A soft whimper escaped you as you gripped his biceps to steady yourself, and he placed his hands on the strip of flesh between your vest and your pyjama bottoms to hold you tighter against his body, feeling goosebumps rise beneath the pads of his fingers. He spread his long digits outwards and upwards so they rested slightly beneath the material of your top, his tongue running along the seam of your lips which you parted instantly to allow him to deepen the kiss further.</p><p>Keeping one hand on your back, he moved the other to your ribcage and ran his thumb along the underside of your breast. He broke the kiss to meet your eyes. \u201cOkay?\u201d he was out of breath and almost out of his mind with desire but your arousal was glaringly obvious to him, and as you ground down mindlessly in to his lap he inhaled in a hiss at the friction.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Your response left you in a breathy moan and Taehyung needed no further encouragement to progress.</p><p>Using the hand on your back to pull you closer still, he buried his head in to the crook of your neck and pressed his open lips to your throat. He ran his tongue teasingly along the soft skin towards the curve of your shoulder and sucked lightly, the hand at your ribcage ascending to palm the supple skin of your breast, swiping his thumb over it&rsquo;s taut peak, feeling it harden further beneath his touch.</p><p>He became only vaguely aware that he was rolling his hips upward to meet the apex of your thighs, his body seemingly acting purely on instinct, desperate to continue eliciting the delicious moans you were gifting him with. He moved his lips away from your neck to gaze up at you with lidded eyes, his teeth biting in to his bottom lip in concentration, keeping his hand splayed across the small of your back and moving the other to grip your hip to guide the back and forth movement of your core over his increasing hardness.</p><p>You lowered your hands to grip the hem of his t-shirt and lifted it over his head, and you dragged your fingernails lightly down his bare chest towards the waist band of his jeans, causing a shiver to travel through Taehyung\u2019s body as his hips reflexively bucked upward at the sensation of your fingers teasingly dipping in to the elastic of his boxers. </p><p>What could only be described as a growl emanated from his chest, and he wrapped one arm around your back and twisted your bodies so your back landed against the fleece blankets on the ground. The sudden jolt and the sheer intensity of Taehyung\u2019s stare caused you to laugh breathlessly, reaching up to drag his face back to yours to kiss him again hotly before pressing your forehead against his. \u201cTaehyung,\u201d you moaned against his lips, \u201cplease.\u201d</p><p>He drew back, his eyes scanning your face for any signs that he had misunderstood your plea. Content that he had not, he pulled you to sit up and lifted your vest top over your head before reaching down to unbuckle his belt and unzip his jeans, his eyes never breaking contact with yours as he did so. You pushed your pyjama bottoms down and kicked them away, leaning back against your elbows, your knees bent and parted in a silent invitation.</p><p>He eagerly complied, climbing his way up your body and leaning on one elbow so as not to crush you beneath him, shifting his weight to lay himself between your thighs, using his spare hand to tangle in to your hair, tilting your head to allow him greater access to the cavern of your mouth as his tongue stroked along yours greedily, swallowing your moans as he ground himself against your heat through the two thin layers of material that acted as the only remaining barrier between you.</p><p>He released his hand from your hair and stroked it down the side of your neck and over your breast, squeezing the flesh there and lowering his head to lick over the peak, sucking it in to his mouth while his hand continued it\u2019s descent, stopping at the waistband of your underwear with the sole purpose of flicking his eyes upwards momentarily to take in the look on your face as his hand dipped beneath the material and stroked tentatively against your heat for the first time.</p><p>His mouth continued it\u2019s ministrations on your breast as he ran his fingers through your wetness, letting the pad of his thumb circle over the bundle of nerves, before his fingers slipped easily inside you. He was fascinated watching you as you tilted your head back and alternated between pulling at your own hair and tugging at the roots of his while involuntarily rolling your hips to meet the pumping of his fingers.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung. I need you, please.\u201d You managed to cry out between moans, and he swore he could feel the blood rush to already hard length at the neediness in your tone.</p><p>He made his way back up your body to kiss your lips chastely and stroke the mussed hair out of your face, before reaching up to somewhere behind your head to retrieve his wallet from his coat and remove a square foil packet from within it. He kicked off his boxers and resumed his position between your thighs. \u201c<i>Dangshineun daedanhaeyo.</i>\u201d He whispered the words before slanting his mouth over yours and kissing you deeply as you lifted your legs to rest at his hips.</p><p>Poised to enter you, he paused - following all the heat, urgency, intensity - a moment of serenity. He wanted to see how your face would change by the intrusion of him. Would your eyes widen or flutter closed as he stretched you open? Would your lips fall open with a moan or would you hold your breath, only exhaling after your warm softness had been filled by his hard length? He felt his face become calm as he looked intently at you through his dark lashes, biting gently down on the left side of his bottom lip in something resembling concentration, before the push and the slick and the give and finally he filled you.</p><p>He held himself still to allow you to adjust to his size, and you could easily see the effort it took for him to resist. You had seen a similar expression of restraint on his face when he\u2019d pinned you against the wall outside his hotel room the night before. His eyes were screwed shut and his breathing was laboured, a barely supressed moan rumbling in the back of his throat.</p><p>You placed your hand on the side of his face to urge him to look at you, willing him to move with your eyes as you tried to shift your own hips beneath him. It didn\u2019t take him long to understand and he drew back his hips, almost leaving your body entirely before pushing forward agonisingly slow so you could feel every inch of him.</p><p>You gasped at the friction of his body rubbing against the apex of your sex as he filled you to the hilt, rolling his hips maddeningly to continue the stimulation, and you began to claw at his shoulders as you quickly felt your orgasm build. He pressed his forehead against yours, murmuring your name as his lips parted and his eyes grew wide in awe as he watched you begin to come undone under his attention.</p><p>The sight of your arching back and the sound of his name falling from your lips in a chant seemed to push him towards his own end, his thrusts becoming erratic as his teeth sunk in to his bottom lip in an effort to muffle his deep groans. He pushed in to you roughly one final time and kissed you hard, his lips moving furiously over yours before his movements finally stilled.</p><p>As his breathing became more stable, Taehyung moved to lay beside you, somehow being able to ignore the bunched up and uneven blankets to nestle beneath your arm, resting his head against your still heaving chest. He tightened his arms around you and sighed happily, any tension or unease he may have felt hours ago the furthest thing from his mind as he hummed contentedly at the feel of your fingertips lazily drawing patterns up and down the smooth skin of his back.</p><p>He inattentively heard the sound if his phone buzzing against the hard concrete surface of the roof and found himself wishing the battery had run down entirely as you slept. He reached behind himself blindly and felt around for the source of the disturbance, finally grasping the device and bringing it begrudgingly in front of his face.</p><p>The display on the screen informed him it was just before 8am. It also alerted him to numerous updates in the group chat with the rest of the members, a couple of messages from Jimin, and - somewhat more worryingly - a multitude of missed calls from Seong-min. At that point feeling too euphoric to be overly concerned, he pushed on the power button until it gave the long buzz of confirmation that the handset was switching off. He never got up earlier than 10am unless they were travelling, so no one would expect him to be awake yet either way, and the only thing on the schedule for that day was much later in the afternoon: a recorded interview for some podcast he&rsquo;d never heard of. </p><p>&ldquo;Everything alright, Taehyung?&rdquo; you murmured, somehow managing to sound even more blissed-out than he felt. </p><p>He linked the fingers of one hand through yours and brought it to his lips, before pressing his cheek in to your open palm. &ldquo;Perfect,&rdquo; he said carefully, and at that moment in time, he really believed that everything could be. </p><p><b>A/N - <i>Hope you all made it to the end! The Korean song which they listen to as they fall asleep is Standing Egg&rsquo;s Little Star, which has been a favourite song of mine for some time.

You had merely pushed it to the back if your mind, simply grateful for his kindness and his company, before becoming completely entranced by his deep voice and perfect face. By the time it had occurred to you to be curious about the reason for his presence, you were already alone on the roof top of your bar, coming down from the high of your second kiss. \u201cDo you want to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered instantly but said nothing else, meeting your eyes with an intense gaze once more, and you knew he meant for you to see the sincerity there. \u201c<i>Chinshim</i>.\u201d He drew his knees up to his chest and dropped his forehead to rest on them, letting out a deep groan.</p>[[MORE]]<p>You mirrored his posture, clasping your hands around your shins, only vaguely wondering what the word he had breathed out meant as you stared out to the limited view of the skyline. \u201cAre you in some sort of trouble?\u201d In your periphery you saw him turn his face to you, his expression confused, with his cheek still leaning on his knees. \u201cLike\u2026are you\u2026on the run? From the police or something?\u201d You knew it was an absurd question as soon as the words left your mouth, and you rolled your eyes at yourself before scrunching them shut tightly as if willing the past thirty seconds out of existence.</p><p>He lifted his head, his deep brown eyes wide as he took in what you had asked. \u201cOn the run\u2026police?\u201d Your eyes remained firmly closed and it felt like an age passed before you heard him breathe in fully before a throaty laugh, higher pitched than you had expected, burst forth from his lips against the silence of the night that surrounded you. \u201cYou would be okay with it? <i>Chincha</i>!\u201d he stuttered out between spasms of laughter.</p><p>You pouted and nudged him with your shoulder playfully, \u201cNo, I just\u2026\u201d You didn\u2019t know what on earth made you ask that, but the need to hazard a guess had been too powerful. However your embarrassment dissipated as soon as you realised how enchanted you were by the sound of his laughter, and you found yourself giggling along with him, such was the contagious nature of the sound, and the tension in the air broken even if just momentarily.</p><p>\u201cYou like me that much?\u201d he asked, his laughter slowing as he inhaled deeply to stabilise his breathing, and he turned his body slightly to drape his arm around your shoulder once more, pulling you gently to his side and dropping a kiss to the top of your head. You felt his chest expand beneath your fingers and lifted your gaze to look up at him, watching as his mouth opened to speak but no sound followed the movement. You saw him raise his eyes upwards as if searching the stars for the appropriate words. \u201cI\u2019m here for\u2026ah <i>jeongmal</i>.\u201d he let out another laugh, laced with embarrassment and just a little bitterness. He tried once more, \u201cI\u2019m here\u2026\u201d</p><p>You lifted your chin, craning your neck so you could meet his eyes, your hand moving to rest against his defined jaw, your thumb stroking just below his cheekbone, stilling his movements. \u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d You repeated, hoping that he understood that that was the only thing that mattered to you right then. His struggle with the words worried you, and you were all of a sudden totally against having him tell you. He met your eyes and unflinchingly stared in to them as if he might find the right words there, their intensity once again knocking the wind from you. You leant upwards a little further to close the gap between your mouths, your eyes fluttering closed as your lips pressed against one another\u2019s in a sweet kiss.</p><p>It would have been a lie to say you weren\u2019t curious about his reasons for coming to your part of the world \u2013 which until the day before you had been entirely certain that no one outside of the county, let alone the country, would ever bother travelling to \u2013 but you didn\u2019t want to ruin the limited time you had together when the subject was clearly so difficult for him to talk about. It would also be dishonest of you to claim that you weren\u2019t a little disappointed that he hadn\u2019t tried to suggest any means of keeping in touch. You pushed that feeling as far away as you could manage, wishing only to savour the moments as they were happening. He would be there for another three days yet, and you had already gotten so close in just over one. There was plenty of time for deciding where this may or may not be heading, right? You opted instead to focus only on the feel of Taehyung\u2019s arms as they tightened around you and his warm lips gently pushing against yours.</p><p>A siren sounded once more and you broke away from the kiss, suddenly aware that the night had grown a little colder, and you pulled up the blanket which had fallen back around your shoulders as you nestled again in to his chest, lifting his arm to drag it back around you, to which he chuckled briefly before humming contentedly. \u201cAh,\u201d you heard him say out of nowhere after a minute or so, and you felt rather than saw him reach for his phone. In the quiet you could hear his fingers tapping against the screen, until you heard soft music begin to play from the small yet effective speakers on his handset.</p><p>You each remained motionless but for the gentle stroking of his fingers through your hair and the soothing pattern of your synchronised breaths for the duration of a number of songs, and you felt your eyelids begin to get heavy. You fought against the fatigue that was threatening to overcome you, reluctant to allow sleep steal time from you both, although you knew it would ultimately be a losing battle.</p><p>You had been surprised to find that you were familiar with most of the music Taehyung had been playing, and you enjoyed listening to him singing along to parts of each song which he knew best. You noted that his singing voice was startlingly impressive, pleasant even in its hushed, breathy tones. Where he didn\u2019t know the words he hummed along to the melody softly and tapped his free hand against his leg, seemingly swept away entirely in the music.</p><p>Finally a song began to play that you did not recognise, and it was the first he had played that was in Korean. It was a beautifully simplistic composition, the subtle plucking and strumming of an acoustic guitar a perfect accompaniment to the lilting melody, and even though you couldn\u2019t understand the meaning of the words \u2013 save for the odd English phrase \u2013 you found yourself completely moved by it. It was almost like a lullaby, and he knew the lyrics well and sang them confidently, occasionally pulling you tighter to him as he did so, and despite your efforts you felt yourself slipping in to slumber. You were vaguely aware of your body leaning in to his more heavily as sleep finally took you, and just before you could no longer open your eyes, you thought you felt a single drop of warm rain fall on to the bare skin of your hand which still rested on his chest.</p><p>~~~</p><p>Before he joined you in sleep, he thought about the bullet he had dodged when you had clearly given him an out as far as the truth of his presence was concerned. He had no inkling as to how he should have approached the situation with you. Whenever he opened his mouth to tell you everything, the absurdity of it had hit him, and he was reminded once again of the implausibility of your relationship \u2013 if it could even be called such a thing \u2013 progressing any further than the time he was here.</p><p>He had never uttered the words \u2018I\u2019m in an idol group\u2019 before, he never had any need to, as the majority of the time people already knew exactly who he was before he even opened his mouth. He tried to work out if it would be preferable for you to be one of those girls who were more than aware of his identity. It certainly would have made things simpler, not needing to try to articulate the actuality of his circumstances in a way that didn\u2019t sound far-fetched or boastful. Would you even know what an idol group was? He was more than aware that the concept of idols could very well be as foreign to you as his language was.</p><p>The fact of the matter was that in all the time he had spent with you, as brief though it may have been in the grand scheme of things, you had made him feel so utterly normal that the truth of his occupation had seemed somewhat preposterous in your presence. The closeness you had been able to cultivate so rapidly, the palpable desire for one another dragging you towards each other almost involuntarily, that was the extraordinary thing he wanted you to dumbfounded by \u2013 as he was \u2013 not his celebrity status. Not that he believed for a second that you would have been swayed either way by such a factor, he just felt as though the time limit had indubitably passed where it could be dropped in to the conversation in anything resembling a natural fashion.</p><p>As your body begin to relax and become heavier against his side, he could feel you trying to jerk yourself awake, succeeding for only a few moments before your head began to droop again, and he smiled as he pressed his lips into the hair at the crown of your head. One of his favourite songs began to play, and he congratulated himself on his playlist selection as he sang along to the lyrics and felt the meaning of the words so strongly it was as if he was hearing them for the first time. He tightened his arm around your shoulders both to keep you warm and to keep you as close to him as possible while he was still able. As the song drew to a close he was surprised to feel hot tears threatening to spill on to his cheeks, and before he could wipe his eyes with his free hand, a single tear rolled down his face and dropped from the sharp line of his jaw.</p><p>~~~</p><p>He finally woke just as the sun was beginning to rise, just at that point of dawn when the sun\u2019s dim light casts the landscape in an otherworldly glow. Somehow in the night you had both shifted slightly lower, although you were still resting in the crook of his arm, your face turned slightly upwards so he could clearly see your eyelashes resting on your cheeks, your lips slightly parted. The air remained mild, but there was a slight morning chill which had rendered the flesh of your face ice-cold against his skin. Taehyung carefully removed his arm from around your frame, lifting your head gingerly before lowering it on to his folded up coat. He rubbed his palms together to heat his fingers before shuffling down to lie on his side to face you, and raised his hands to press them against your cheeks to warm them, trying not to laugh aloud at the way your face scrunched up at the unexpected contact.</p><p>After a few moments, satisfied he had taken the edge away from the cold, he pulled the blankets up to his own chin, then arranged them about your shoulders to keep the warmth in the fleece cocoon he had created for you both. He raised his arm to lean his head against it and found himself amused by the minute changes in your expression as the breeze moved errant strands of hair to tickle against you. He delicately pushed back the offending hair and smiled fondly as you seemed to try and nuzzle your head in to his hand the way a cat might.</p><p>He returned his arm to the confines of the blanket and rested his hand lightly just above the dip of your waist and closed his eyes again, his face a picture of contentment as he closed his eyes and wiggled his way down further in to the covers, opening his eyes again \u2013 just for a second \u2013 almost as if he were checking that you were still there.</p><p>The thought suddenly occurred to him that this was the first time he had seen you in daylight, and he was struck with an urge to kiss you as a means of marking the occasion, even if it were only for his benefit. He moved to press a kiss to your forehead, but as he shifted the blankets to bring his body closer to yours, the fleece corner covering your shoulder slipped to the ground. Taehyung\u2019s attention was abruptly pulled to the bare skin the movement had exposed, and any innocent thoughts he may have been entertaining were instantaneously overcome by an intense want. The satin shirt had shifted in sleep, making it appear as though it had been pushed from your shoulders in some passionate embrace.</p><p>He was all at once dizzy with the urge to graze his teeth open-mouthed along the curve of your shoulder, to have his tongue swipe briefly against it. He wanted to drag the rest of the shirt down, and he could almost envision his trembling fingers grasping the material to present more to his eyes, his lips, his teeth. A brief image flashed in his mind of his one of his hands curled, gripped around that shoulder, the other placed on the small of your naked back as you arched and moaned his name and \u2013</p><p>Your eyes bore in to his. \u201cTaehyung?\u201d You breathed out his name as a question and he could only imagine what he must look like to you. He could feel his mouth was agape as his eyes fixated on your bare skin and dishevelled clothes, and he averted his gaze from you swiftly, suddenly bashful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026sorry\u2026 \u201d Still unable to meet your eyes he reached towards you without looking and attempted to adjust the shirt so it covered you again and buried his face in to his arm, groaning in embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung,\u201d you repeated. He could hear you were closer and he opened his eyes to find you leaning over him, your eyes roaming over his face as though you were trying to commit it to memory.</p><p>He watched entranced as you lowered your face to his, pausing briefly as your lips were mere centimetres apart, flicking your eyes upwards to meet his gaze, before closing the distance and pressing your lips together, waves of arousal coursing through his veins like electric currents at the contact. He let you take the lead, still wary that you had caught him brazenly gawking at you and reluctant to approach any lines that you weren\u2019t ready to cross.</p><p>Any concern he may have had about your willingness to progress things further were quickly assuaged as you grabbed the collar of his t-shirt and pulled him forcefully in to a seated position, continuing to kiss him passionately as you did so, gripping his face between your hands as you took his bottom lip between yours and sucked lightly, swinging one of your legs over both of his and seating yourself over his thighs.</p><p>You broke away from the kiss abruptly, and Taehyung found himself chasing your lips with his own as you sat back on your haunches, meeting his eyes again fiercely as you slipped the satin shirt from your shoulders. As you discarded the garment behind you, he stared \u2013 awestruck \u2013 as you reached slowly towards the strap on your left shoulder and hooked your thumb beneath it, dragging the thin material down and biting gently down on your bottom lip.</p><p>Whatever restraint Taehyung was held back by finally snapped, and he lurched forward to crush his chest against yours, stretching upwards to meet your lips, kissing you harder than he had before, muffled grunts spilling forth from his throat against your mouth. A soft whimper escaped you as you gripped his biceps to steady yourself, and he placed his hands on the strip of flesh between your vest and your pyjama bottoms to hold you tighter against his body, feeling goosebumps rise beneath the pads of his fingers. He spread his long digits outwards and upwards so they rested slightly beneath the material of your top, his tongue running along the seam of your lips which you parted instantly to allow him to deepen the kiss further.</p><p>Keeping one hand on your back, he moved the other to your ribcage and ran his thumb along the underside of your breast. He broke the kiss to meet your eyes. \u201cOkay?\u201d he was out of breath and almost out of his mind with desire but your arousal was glaringly obvious to him, and as you ground down mindlessly in to his lap he inhaled in a hiss at the friction.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Your response left you in a breathy moan and Taehyung needed no further encouragement to progress.</p><p>Using the hand on your back to pull you closer still, he buried his head in to the crook of your neck and pressed his open lips to your throat. He ran his tongue teasingly along the soft skin towards the curve of your shoulder and sucked lightly, the hand at your ribcage ascending to palm the supple skin of your breast, swiping his thumb over it\u2019s taut peak, feeling it harden further beneath his touch.</p><p>He became only vaguely aware that he was rolling his hips upward to meet the apex of your thighs, his body seemingly acting purely on instinct, desperate to continue eliciting the delicious moans you were gifting him with. He moved his lips away from your neck to gaze up at you with lidded eyes, his teeth biting in to his bottom lip in concentration, keeping his hand splayed across the small of your back and moving the other to grip your hip to guide the back and forth movement of your core over his increasing hardness.</p><p>You lowered your hands to grip the hem of his t-shirt and lifted it over his head, and you dragged your fingernails lightly down his bare chest towards the waist band of his jeans, causing a shiver to travel through Taehyung\u2019s body as his hips reflexively bucked upward at the sensation of your fingers teasingly dipping in to the elastic of his boxers. </p><p>What could only be described as a growl emanated from his chest, and he wrapped one arm around your back and twisted your bodies so your back landed against the fleece blankets on the ground. The sudden jolt and the sheer intensity of Taehyung\u2019s stare caused you to laugh breathlessly, reaching up to drag his face back to yours to kiss him again hotly before pressing your forehead against his. \u201cTaehyung,\u201d you moaned against his lips, \u201cplease.\u201d</p><p>He drew back, his eyes scanning your face for any signs that he had misunderstood your plea. Content that he had not, he pulled you to sit up and lifted your vest top over your head before reaching down to unbuckle his belt and unzip his jeans, his eyes never breaking contact with yours as he did so. You pushed your pyjama bottoms down and kicked them away, leaning back against your elbows, your knees bent and parted in a silent invitation.</p><p>He eagerly complied, climbing his way up your body and leaning on one elbow so as not to crush you beneath him, shifting his weight to lay himself between your thighs, using his spare hand to tangle in to your hair, tilting your head to allow him greater access to the cavern of your mouth as his tongue stroked along yours greedily, swallowing your moans as he ground himself against your heat through the two thin layers of material that acted as the only remaining barrier between you.</p><p>He released his hand from your hair and stroked it down the side of your neck and over your breast, squeezing the flesh there and lowering his head to lick over the peak, sucking it in to his mouth while his hand continued it\u2019s descent, stopping at the waistband of your underwear with the sole purpose of flicking his eyes upwards momentarily to take in the look on your face as his hand dipped beneath the material and stroked tentatively against your heat for the first time.</p><p>His mouth continued it\u2019s ministrations on your breast as he ran his fingers through your wetness, letting the pad of his thumb circle over the bundle of nerves, before his fingers slipped easily inside you. He was fascinated watching you as you tilted your head back and alternated between pulling at your own hair and tugging at the roots of his while involuntarily rolling your hips to meet the pumping of his fingers.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung. I need you, please.\u201d You managed to cry out between moans, and he swore he could feel the blood rush to already hard length at the neediness in your tone.</p><p>He made his way back up your body to kiss your lips chastely and stroke the mussed hair out of your face, before reaching up to somewhere behind your head to retrieve his wallet from his coat and remove a square foil packet from within it. He kicked off his boxers and resumed his position between your thighs. \u201c<i>Dangshineun daedanhaeyo.</i>\u201d He whispered the words before slanting his mouth over yours and kissing you deeply as you lifted your legs to rest at his hips.</p><p>Poised to enter you, he paused - following all the heat, urgency, intensity - a moment of serenity. He wanted to see how your face would change by the intrusion of him. Would your eyes widen or flutter closed as he stretched you open? Would your lips fall open with a moan or would you hold your breath, only exhaling after your warm softness had been filled by his hard length? He felt his face become calm as he looked intently at you through his dark lashes, biting gently down on the left side of his bottom lip in something resembling concentration, before the push and the slick and the give and finally he filled you.</p><p>He held himself still to allow you to adjust to his size, and you could easily see the effort it took for him to resist. You had seen a similar expression of restraint on his face when he\u2019d pinned you against the wall outside his hotel room the night before. His eyes were screwed shut and his breathing was laboured, a barely supressed moan rumbling in the back of his throat.</p><p>You placed your hand on the side of his face to urge him to look at you, willing him to move with your eyes as you tried to shift your own hips beneath him. It didn\u2019t take him long to understand and he drew back his hips, almost leaving your body entirely before pushing forward agonisingly slow so you could feel every inch of him.</p><p>You gasped at the friction of his body rubbing against the apex of your sex as he filled you to the hilt, rolling his hips maddeningly to continue the stimulation, and you began to claw at his shoulders as you quickly felt your orgasm build. He pressed his forehead against yours, murmuring your name as his lips parted and his eyes grew wide in awe as he watched you begin to come undone under his attention.</p><p>The sight of your arching back and the sound of his name falling from your lips in a chant seemed to push him towards his own end, his thrusts becoming erratic as his teeth sunk in to his bottom lip in an effort to muffle his deep groans. He pushed in to you roughly one final time and kissed you hard, his lips moving furiously over yours before his movements finally stilled.</p><p>As his breathing became more stable, Taehyung moved to lay beside you, somehow being able to ignore the bunched up and uneven blankets to nestle beneath your arm, resting his head against your still heaving chest. He tightened his arms around you and sighed happily, any tension or unease he may have felt hours ago the furthest thing from his mind as he hummed contentedly at the feel of your fingertips lazily drawing patterns up and down the smooth skin of his back.</p><p>He inattentively heard the sound if his phone buzzing against the hard concrete surface of the roof and found himself wishing the battery had run down entirely as you slept. He reached behind himself blindly and felt around for the source of the disturbance, finally grasping the device and bringing it begrudgingly in front of his face.</p><p>The display on the screen informed him it was just before 8am. It also alerted him to numerous updates in the group chat with the rest of the members, a couple of messages from Jimin, and - somewhat more worryingly - a multitude of missed calls from Seong-min. At that point feeling too euphoric to be overly concerned, he pushed on the power button until it gave the long buzz of confirmation that the handset was switching off. He never got up earlier than 10am unless they were travelling, so no one would expect him to be awake yet either way, and the only thing on the schedule for that day was much later in the afternoon: a recorded interview for some podcast he\u2019d never heard of. </p><p>\u201cEverything alright, Taehyung?\u201d you murmured, somehow managing to sound even more blissed-out than he felt. </p><p>He linked the fingers of one hand through yours and brought it to his lips, before pressing his cheek in to your open palm. \u201cPerfect,\u201d he said carefully, and at that moment in time, he really believed that everything could be. </p><p><b>A/N - <i>Hope you all made it to the end! The Korean song which they listen to as they fall asleep is Standing Egg\u2019s Little Star, which has been a favourite song of mine for some time.

Neither of you truly wanted to allow the truth of your situation to seep in to the fantasy land you had created for yourselves of the rooftop that night, but it seemed foolish to wholly deny it for much longer.</p><p>\u201cThree days.\u201d A pained expression crossed your face as if you had been punched in the stomach and you could see your sadness reflected in Taehyung\u2019s eyes. \u201cDo you want to know why I\u2019m here?\u201d His question sounded strained, forced, as if he were following cue cards that he wasn\u2019t convinced were for him to read, and you felt apprehension begin to creep up from your stomach.</p><p>\u201cBecause you wanted to see me?\u201d Your eyes were full of hope, but your tone was playfully flippant, as you tried to skirt around the significance of the question. You knew all too well he wasn\u2019t talking about the reason for his presence at the bar.</p><p>He dropped his gaze and shook his head, smiling softly. \u201cNot here,\u201d he clarified, cupping the side of your face with his large hand before sweeping it towards the lit up skyline to clarify. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>You had suspected there was something unusual about the situation with Taehyung, none of it had really made sense \u2013 from the luxurious hotel suite to the bemused man you had met in that same room who had threatened to call the police. You had merely pushed it to the back if your mind, simply grateful for his kindness and his company, before becoming completely entranced by his deep voice and perfect face. By the time it had occurred to you to be curious about the reason for his presence, you were already alone on the roof top of your bar, coming down from the high of your second kiss. \u201cDo you want to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered instantly but said nothing else, meeting your eyes with an intense gaze once more, and you knew he meant for you to see the sincerity there. \u201c<i>Chinshim</i>.\u201d He drew his knees up to his chest and dropped his forehead to rest on them, letting out a deep groan.</p>[[MORE]]<p>You mirrored his posture, clasping your hands around your shins, only vaguely wondering what the word he had breathed out meant as you stared out to the limited view of the skyline. \u201cAre you in some sort of trouble?\u201d In your periphery you saw him turn his face to you, his expression confused, with his cheek still leaning on his knees. \u201cLike\u2026are you\u2026on the run? From the police or something?\u201d You knew it was an absurd question as soon as the words left your mouth, and you rolled your eyes at yourself before scrunching them shut tightly as if willing the past thirty seconds out of existence.</p><p>He lifted his head, his deep brown eyes wide as he took in what you had asked. \u201cOn the run\u2026police?\u201d Your eyes remained firmly closed and it felt like an age passed before you heard him breathe in fully before a throaty laugh, higher pitched than you had expected, burst forth from his lips against the silence of the night that surrounded you. \u201cYou would be okay with it? <i>Chincha</i>!\u201d he stuttered out between spasms of laughter.</p><p>You pouted and nudged him with your shoulder playfully, \u201cNo, I just\u2026\u201d You didn\u2019t know what on earth made you ask that, but the need to hazard a guess had been too powerful. However your embarrassment dissipated as soon as you realised how enchanted you were by the sound of his laughter, and you found yourself giggling along with him, such was the contagious nature of the sound, and the tension in the air broken even if just momentarily.</p><p>\u201cYou like me that much?\u201d he asked, his laughter slowing as he inhaled deeply to stabilise his breathing, and he turned his body slightly to drape his arm around your shoulder once more, pulling you gently to his side and dropping a kiss to the top of your head. You felt his chest expand beneath your fingers and lifted your gaze to look up at him, watching as his mouth opened to speak but no sound followed the movement. You saw him raise his eyes upwards as if searching the stars for the appropriate words. \u201cI\u2019m here for\u2026ah <i>jeongmal</i>.\u201d he let out another laugh, laced with embarrassment and just a little bitterness. He tried once more, \u201cI\u2019m here\u2026\u201d</p><p>You lifted your chin, craning your neck so you could meet his eyes, your hand moving to rest against his defined jaw, your thumb stroking just below his cheekbone, stilling his movements. \u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d You repeated, hoping that he understood that that was the only thing that mattered to you right then. His struggle with the words worried you, and you were all of a sudden totally against having him tell you. He met your eyes and unflinchingly stared in to them as if he might find the right words there, their intensity once again knocking the wind from you. You leant upwards a little further to close the gap between your mouths, your eyes fluttering closed as your lips pressed against one another\u2019s in a sweet kiss.</p><p>It would have been a lie to say you weren\u2019t curious about his reasons for coming to your part of the world \u2013 which until the day before you had been entirely certain that no one outside of the county, let alone the country, would ever bother travelling to \u2013 but you didn\u2019t want to ruin the limited time you had together when the subject was clearly so difficult for him to talk about. It would also be dishonest of you to claim that you weren\u2019t a little disappointed that he hadn\u2019t tried to suggest any means of keeping in touch. You pushed that feeling as far away as you could manage, wishing only to savour the moments as they were happening. He would be there for another three days yet, and you had already gotten so close in just over one. There was plenty of time for deciding where this may or may not be heading, right? You opted instead to focus only on the feel of Taehyung\u2019s arms as they tightened around you and his warm lips gently pushing against yours.</p><p>A siren sounded once more and you broke away from the kiss, suddenly aware that the night had grown a little colder, and you pulled up the blanket which had fallen back around your shoulders as you nestled again in to his chest, lifting his arm to drag it back around you, to which he chuckled briefly before humming contentedly. \u201cAh,\u201d you heard him say out of nowhere after a minute or so, and you felt rather than saw him reach for his phone. In the quiet you could hear his fingers tapping against the screen, until you heard soft music begin to play from the small yet effective speakers on his handset.</p><p>You each remained motionless but for the gentle stroking of his fingers through your hair and the soothing pattern of your synchronised breaths for the duration of a number of songs, and you felt your eyelids begin to get heavy. You fought against the fatigue that was threatening to overcome you, reluctant to allow sleep steal time from you both, although you knew it would ultimately be a losing battle.</p><p>You had been surprised to find that you were familiar with most of the music Taehyung had been playing, and you enjoyed listening to him singing along to parts of each song which he knew best. You noted that his singing voice was startlingly impressive, pleasant even in its hushed, breathy tones. Where he didn\u2019t know the words he hummed along to the melody softly and tapped his free hand against his leg, seemingly swept away entirely in the music.</p><p>Finally a song began to play that you did not recognise, and it was the first he had played that was in Korean. It was a beautifully simplistic composition, the subtle plucking and strumming of an acoustic guitar a perfect accompaniment to the lilting melody, and even though you couldn\u2019t understand the meaning of the words \u2013 save for the odd English phrase \u2013 you found yourself completely moved by it. It was almost like a lullaby, and he knew the lyrics well and sang them confidently, occasionally pulling you tighter to him as he did so, and despite your efforts you felt yourself slipping in to slumber. You were vaguely aware of your body leaning in to his more heavily as sleep finally took you, and just before you could no longer open your eyes, you thought you felt a single drop of warm rain fall on to the bare skin of your hand which still rested on his chest.</p><p>~~~</p><p>Before he joined you in sleep, he thought about the bullet he had dodged when you had clearly given him an out as far as the truth of his presence was concerned. He had no inkling as to how he should have approached the situation with you. Whenever he opened his mouth to tell you everything, the absurdity of it had hit him, and he was reminded once again of the implausibility of your relationship \u2013 if it could even be called such a thing \u2013 progressing any further than the time he was here.</p><p>He had never uttered the words \u2018I\u2019m in an idol group\u2019 before, he never had any need to, as the majority of the time people already knew exactly who he was before he even opened his mouth. He tried to work out if it would be preferable for you to be one of those girls who were more than aware of his identity. It certainly would have made things simpler, not needing to try to articulate the actuality of his circumstances in a way that didn\u2019t sound far-fetched or boastful. Would you even know what an idol group was? He was more than aware that the concept of idols could very well be as foreign to you as his language was.</p><p>The fact of the matter was that in all the time he had spent with you, as brief though it may have been in the grand scheme of things, you had made him feel so utterly normal that the truth of his occupation had seemed somewhat preposterous in your presence. The closeness you had been able to cultivate so rapidly, the palpable desire for one another dragging you towards each other almost involuntarily, that was the extraordinary thing he wanted you to dumbfounded by \u2013 as he was \u2013 not his celebrity status. Not that he believed for a second that you would have been swayed either way by such a factor, he just felt as though the time limit had indubitably passed where it could be dropped in to the conversation in anything resembling a natural fashion.</p><p>As your body begin to relax and become heavier against his side, he could feel you trying to jerk yourself awake, succeeding for only a few moments before your head began to droop again, and he smiled as he pressed his lips into the hair at the crown of your head. One of his favourite songs began to play, and he congratulated himself on his playlist selection as he sang along to the lyrics and felt the meaning of the words so strongly it was as if he was hearing them for the first time. He tightened his arm around your shoulders both to keep you warm and to keep you as close to him as possible while he was still able. As the song drew to a close he was surprised to feel hot tears threatening to spill on to his cheeks, and before he could wipe his eyes with his free hand, a single tear rolled down his face and dropped from the sharp line of his jaw.</p><p>~~~</p><p>He finally woke just as the sun was beginning to rise, just at that point of dawn when the sun\u2019s dim light casts the landscape in an otherworldly glow. Somehow in the night you had both shifted slightly lower, although you were still resting in the crook of his arm, your face turned slightly upwards so he could clearly see your eyelashes resting on your cheeks, your lips slightly parted. The air remained mild, but there was a slight morning chill which had rendered the flesh of your face ice-cold against his skin. Taehyung carefully removed his arm from around your frame, lifting your head gingerly before lowering it on to his folded up coat. He rubbed his palms together to heat his fingers before shuffling down to lie on his side to face you, and raised his hands to press them against your cheeks to warm them, trying not to laugh aloud at the way your face scrunched up at the unexpected contact.</p><p>After a few moments, satisfied he had taken the edge away from the cold, he pulled the blankets up to his own chin, then arranged them about your shoulders to keep the warmth in the fleece cocoon he had created for you both. He raised his arm to lean his head against it and found himself amused by the minute changes in your expression as the breeze moved errant strands of hair to tickle against you. He delicately pushed back the offending hair and smiled fondly as you seemed to try and nuzzle your head in to his hand the way a cat might.</p><p>He returned his arm to the confines of the blanket and rested his hand lightly just above the dip of your waist and closed his eyes again, his face a picture of contentment as he closed his eyes and wiggled his way down further in to the covers, opening his eyes again \u2013 just for a second \u2013 almost as if he were checking that you were still there.</p><p>The thought suddenly occurred to him that this was the first time he had seen you in daylight, and he was struck with an urge to kiss you as a means of marking the occasion, even if it were only for his benefit. He moved to press a kiss to your forehead, but as he shifted the blankets to bring his body closer to yours, the fleece corner covering your shoulder slipped to the ground. Taehyung\u2019s attention was abruptly pulled to the bare skin the movement had exposed, and any innocent thoughts he may have been entertaining were instantaneously overcome by an intense want. The satin shirt had shifted in sleep, making it appear as though it had been pushed from your shoulders in some passionate embrace.</p><p>He was all at once dizzy with the urge to graze his teeth open-mouthed along the curve of your shoulder, to have his tongue swipe briefly against it. He wanted to drag the rest of the shirt down, and he could almost envision his trembling fingers grasping the material to present more to his eyes, his lips, his teeth. A brief image flashed in his mind of his one of his hands curled, gripped around that shoulder, the other placed on the small of your naked back as you arched and moaned his name and \u2013</p><p>Your eyes bore in to his. \u201cTaehyung?\u201d You breathed out his name as a question and he could only imagine what he must look like to you. He could feel his mouth was agape as his eyes fixated on your bare skin and dishevelled clothes, and he averted his gaze from you swiftly, suddenly bashful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026sorry\u2026 \u201d Still unable to meet your eyes he reached towards you without looking and attempted to adjust the shirt so it covered you again and buried his face in to his arm, groaning in embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung,\u201d you repeated. He could hear you were closer and he opened his eyes to find you leaning over him, your eyes roaming over his face as though you were trying to commit it to memory.</p><p>He watched entranced as you lowered your face to his, pausing briefly as your lips were mere centimetres apart, flicking your eyes upwards to meet his gaze, before closing the distance and pressing your lips together, waves of arousal coursing through his veins like electric currents at the contact. He let you take the lead, still wary that you had caught him brazenly gawking at you and reluctant to approach any lines that you weren\u2019t ready to cross.</p><p>Any concern he may have had about your willingness to progress things further were quickly assuaged as you grabbed the collar of his t-shirt and pulled him forcefully in to a seated position, continuing to kiss him passionately as you did so, gripping his face between your hands as you took his bottom lip between yours and sucked lightly, swinging one of your legs over both of his and seating yourself over his thighs.</p><p>You broke away from the kiss abruptly, and Taehyung found himself chasing your lips with his own as you sat back on your haunches, meeting his eyes again fiercely as you slipped the satin shirt from your shoulders. As you discarded the garment behind you, he stared \u2013 awestruck \u2013 as you reached slowly towards the strap on your left shoulder and hooked your thumb beneath it, dragging the thin material down and biting gently down on your bottom lip.</p><p>Whatever restraint Taehyung was held back by finally snapped, and he lurched forward to crush his chest against yours, stretching upwards to meet your lips, kissing you harder than he had before, muffled grunts spilling forth from his throat against your mouth. A soft whimper escaped you as you gripped his biceps to steady yourself, and he placed his hands on the strip of flesh between your vest and your pyjama bottoms to hold you tighter against his body, feeling goosebumps rise beneath the pads of his fingers. He spread his long digits outwards and upwards so they rested slightly beneath the material of your top, his tongue running along the seam of your lips which you parted instantly to allow him to deepen the kiss further.</p><p>Keeping one hand on your back, he moved the other to your ribcage and ran his thumb along the underside of your breast. He broke the kiss to meet your eyes. \u201cOkay?\u201d he was out of breath and almost out of his mind with desire but your arousal was glaringly obvious to him, and as you ground down mindlessly in to his lap he inhaled in a hiss at the friction.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Your response left you in a breathy moan and Taehyung needed no further encouragement to progress.</p><p>Using the hand on your back to pull you closer still, he buried his head in to the crook of your neck and pressed his open lips to your throat. He ran his tongue teasingly along the soft skin towards the curve of your shoulder and sucked lightly, the hand at your ribcage ascending to palm the supple skin of your breast, swiping his thumb over it\u2019s taut peak, feeling it harden further beneath his touch.</p><p>He became only vaguely aware that he was rolling his hips upward to meet the apex of your thighs, his body seemingly acting purely on instinct, desperate to continue eliciting the delicious moans you were gifting him with. He moved his lips away from your neck to gaze up at you with lidded eyes, his teeth biting in to his bottom lip in concentration, keeping his hand splayed across the small of your back and moving the other to grip your hip to guide the back and forth movement of your core over his increasing hardness.</p><p>You lowered your hands to grip the hem of his t-shirt and lifted it over his head, and you dragged your fingernails lightly down his bare chest towards the waist band of his jeans, causing a shiver to travel through Taehyung\u2019s body as his hips reflexively bucked upward at the sensation of your fingers teasingly dipping in to the elastic of his boxers. </p><p>What could only be described as a growl emanated from his chest, and he wrapped one arm around your back and twisted your bodies so your back landed against the fleece blankets on the ground. The sudden jolt and the sheer intensity of Taehyung\u2019s stare caused you to laugh breathlessly, reaching up to drag his face back to yours to kiss him again hotly before pressing your forehead against his. \u201cTaehyung,\u201d you moaned against his lips, \u201cplease.\u201d</p><p>He drew back, his eyes scanning your face for any signs that he had misunderstood your plea. Content that he had not, he pulled you to sit up and lifted your vest top over your head before reaching down to unbuckle his belt and unzip his jeans, his eyes never breaking contact with yours as he did so. You pushed your pyjama bottoms down and kicked them away, leaning back against your elbows, your knees bent and parted in a silent invitation.</p><p>He eagerly complied, climbing his way up your body and leaning on one elbow so as not to crush you beneath him, shifting his weight to lay himself between your thighs, using his spare hand to tangle in to your hair, tilting your head to allow him greater access to the cavern of your mouth as his tongue stroked along yours greedily, swallowing your moans as he ground himself against your heat through the two thin layers of material that acted as the only remaining barrier between you.</p><p>He released his hand from your hair and stroked it down the side of your neck and over your breast, squeezing the flesh there and lowering his head to lick over the peak, sucking it in to his mouth while his hand continued it\u2019s descent, stopping at the waistband of your underwear with the sole purpose of flicking his eyes upwards momentarily to take in the look on your face as his hand dipped beneath the material and stroked tentatively against your heat for the first time.</p><p>His mouth continued it\u2019s ministrations on your breast as he ran his fingers through your wetness, letting the pad of his thumb circle over the bundle of nerves, before his fingers slipped easily inside you. He was fascinated watching you as you tilted your head back and alternated between pulling at your own hair and tugging at the roots of his while involuntarily rolling your hips to meet the pumping of his fingers.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung. I need you, please.\u201d You managed to cry out between moans, and he swore he could feel the blood rush to already hard length at the neediness in your tone.</p><p>He made his way back up your body to kiss your lips chastely and stroke the mussed hair out of your face, before reaching up to somewhere behind your head to retrieve his wallet from his coat and remove a square foil packet from within it. He kicked off his boxers and resumed his position between your thighs. \u201c<i>Dangshineun daedanhaeyo.</i>\u201d He whispered the words before slanting his mouth over yours and kissing you deeply as you lifted your legs to rest at his hips.</p><p>Poised to enter you, he paused - following all the heat, urgency, intensity - a moment of serenity. He wanted to see how your face would change by the intrusion of him. Would your eyes widen or flutter closed as he stretched you open? Would your lips fall open with a moan or would you hold your breath, only exhaling after your warm softness had been filled by his hard length? He felt his face become calm as he looked intently at you through his dark lashes, biting gently down on the left side of his bottom lip in something resembling concentration, before the push and the slick and the give and finally he filled you.</p><p>He held himself still to allow you to adjust to his size, and you could easily see the effort it took for him to resist. You had seen a similar expression of restraint on his face when he\u2019d pinned you against the wall outside his hotel room the night before. His eyes were screwed shut and his breathing was laboured, a barely supressed moan rumbling in the back of his throat.</p><p>You placed your hand on the side of his face to urge him to look at you, willing him to move with your eyes as you tried to shift your own hips beneath him. It didn\u2019t take him long to understand and he drew back his hips, almost leaving your body entirely before pushing forward agonisingly slow so you could feel every inch of him.</p><p>You gasped at the friction of his body rubbing against the apex of your sex as he filled you to the hilt, rolling his hips maddeningly to continue the stimulation, and you began to claw at his shoulders as you quickly felt your orgasm build. He pressed his forehead against yours, murmuring your name as his lips parted and his eyes grew wide in awe as he watched you begin to come undone under his attention.</p><p>The sight of your arching back and the sound of his name falling from your lips in a chant seemed to push him towards his own end, his thrusts becoming erratic as his teeth sunk in to his bottom lip in an effort to muffle his deep groans. He pushed in to you roughly one final time and kissed you hard, his lips moving furiously over yours before his movements finally stilled.</p><p>As his breathing became more stable, Taehyung moved to lay beside you, somehow being able to ignore the bunched up and uneven blankets to nestle beneath your arm, resting his head against your still heaving chest. He tightened his arms around you and sighed happily, any tension or unease he may have felt hours ago the furthest thing from his mind as he hummed contentedly at the feel of your fingertips lazily drawing patterns up and down the smooth skin of his back.</p><p>He inattentively heard the sound if his phone buzzing against the hard concrete surface of the roof and found himself wishing the battery had run down entirely as you slept. He reached behind himself blindly and felt around for the source of the disturbance, finally grasping the device and bringing it begrudgingly in front of his face.</p><p>The display on the screen informed him it was just before 8am. It also alerted him to numerous updates in the group chat with the rest of the members, a couple of messages from Jimin, and - somewhat more worryingly - a multitude of missed calls from Seong-min. At that point feeling too euphoric to be overly concerned, he pushed on the power button until it gave the long buzz of confirmation that the handset was switching off. He never got up earlier than 10am unless they were travelling, so no one would expect him to be awake yet either way, and the only thing on the schedule for that day was much later in the afternoon: a recorded interview for some podcast he\u2019d never heard of. </p><p>\u201cEverything alright, Taehyung?\u201d you murmured, somehow managing to sound even more blissed-out than he felt. </p><p>He linked the fingers of one hand through yours and brought it to his lips, before pressing his cheek in to your open palm. \u201cPerfect,\u201d he said carefully, and at that moment in time, he really believed that everything could be. </p><p><b>A/N - <i>Hope you all made it to the end!

Neither of you truly wanted to allow the truth of your situation to seep in to the fantasy land you had created for yourselves of the rooftop that night, but it seemed foolish to wholly deny it for much longer.</p><p>&ldquo;Three days.&rdquo; A pained expression crossed your face as if you had been punched in the stomach and you could see your sadness reflected in Taehyung&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Do you want to know why I&rsquo;m here?&rdquo; His question sounded strained, forced, as if he were following cue cards that he wasn&rsquo;t convinced were for him to read, and you felt apprehension begin to creep up from your stomach.</p><p>&ldquo;Because you wanted to see me?&rdquo; Your eyes were full of hope, but your tone was playfully flippant, as you tried to skirt around the significance of the question. You knew all too well he wasn&rsquo;t talking about the reason for his presence at the bar.</p><p>He dropped his gaze and shook his head, smiling softly. &ldquo;Not here,&rdquo; he clarified, cupping the side of your face with his large hand before sweeping it towards the lit up skyline to clarify. &ldquo;Here.&rdquo;</p><p>You had suspected there was something unusual about the situation with Taehyung, none of it had really made sense &ndash; from the luxurious hotel suite to the bemused man you had met in that same room who had threatened to call the police. You had merely pushed it to the back if your mind, simply grateful for his kindness and his company, before becoming completely entranced by his deep voice and perfect face. By the time it had occurred to you to be curious about the reason for his presence, you were already alone on the roof top of your bar, coming down from the high of your second kiss. &ldquo;Do you want to tell me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered instantly but said nothing else, meeting your eyes with an intense gaze once more, and you knew he meant for you to see the sincerity there. &ldquo;<i>Chinshim</i>.&rdquo; He drew his knees up to his chest and dropped his forehead to rest on them, letting out a deep groan.</p><p>You mirrored his posture, clasping your hands around your shins, only vaguely wondering what the word he had breathed out meant as you stared out to the limited view of the skyline. &ldquo;Are you in some sort of trouble?&rdquo; In your periphery you saw him turn his face to you, his expression confused, with his cheek still leaning on his knees. &ldquo;Like&hellip;are you&hellip;on the run? From the police or something?&rdquo; You knew it was an absurd question as soon as the words left your mouth, and you rolled your eyes at yourself before scrunching them shut tightly as if willing the past thirty seconds out of existence.</p><p>He lifted his head, his deep brown eyes wide as he took in what you had asked. &ldquo;On the run&hellip;police?&rdquo; Your eyes remained firmly closed and it felt like an age passed before you heard him breathe in fully before a throaty laugh, higher pitched than you had expected, burst forth from his lips against the silence of the night that surrounded you. &ldquo;You would be okay with it? <i>Chincha</i>!&rdquo; he stuttered out between spasms of laughter.</p><p>You pouted and nudged him with your shoulder playfully, &ldquo;No, I just&hellip;&rdquo; You didn&rsquo;t know what on earth made you ask that, but the need to hazard a guess had been too powerful. However your embarrassment dissipated as soon as you realised how enchanted you were by the sound of his laughter, and you found yourself giggling along with him, such was the contagious nature of the sound, and the tension in the air broken even if just momentarily.</p><p>&ldquo;You like me that much?&rdquo; he asked, his laughter slowing as he inhaled deeply to stabilise his breathing, and he turned his body slightly to drape his arm around your shoulder once more, pulling you gently to his side and dropping a kiss to the top of your head. You felt his chest expand beneath your fingers and lifted your gaze to look up at him, watching as his mouth opened to speak but no sound followed the movement. You saw him raise his eyes upwards as if searching the stars for the appropriate words. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here for&hellip;ah <i>jeongmal</i>.&rdquo; he let out another laugh, laced with embarrassment and just a little bitterness. He tried once more, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You lifted your chin, craning your neck so you could meet his eyes, your hand moving to rest against his defined jaw, your thumb stroking just below his cheekbone, stilling his movements. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re here.&rdquo; You repeated, hoping that he understood that that was the only thing that mattered to you right then. His struggle with the words worried you, and you were all of a sudden totally against having him tell you. He met your eyes and unflinchingly stared in to them as if he might find the right words there, their intensity once again knocking the wind from you. You leant upwards a little further to close the gap between your mouths, your eyes fluttering closed as your lips pressed against one another&rsquo;s in a sweet kiss.</p><p>It would have been a lie to say you weren&rsquo;t curious about his reasons for coming to your part of the world &ndash; which until the day before you had been entirely certain that no one outside of the county, let alone the country, would ever bother travelling to &ndash; but you didn&rsquo;t want to ruin the limited time you had together when the subject was clearly so difficult for him to talk about. It would also be dishonest of you to claim that you weren&rsquo;t a little disappointed that he hadn&rsquo;t tried to suggest any means of keeping in touch. You pushed that feeling as far away as you could manage, wishing only to savour the moments as they were happening. He would be there for another three days yet, and you had already gotten so close in just over one. There was plenty of time for deciding where this may or may not be heading, right? You opted instead to focus only on the feel of Taehyung&rsquo;s arms as they tightened around you and his warm lips gently pushing against yours.</p><p>A siren sounded once more and you broke away from the kiss, suddenly aware that the night had grown a little colder, and you pulled up the blanket which had fallen back around your shoulders as you nestled again in to his chest, lifting his arm to drag it back around you, to which he chuckled briefly before humming contentedly. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; you heard him say out of nowhere after a minute or so, and you felt rather than saw him reach for his phone. In the quiet you could hear his fingers tapping against the screen, until you heard soft music begin to play from the small yet effective speakers on his handset.</p><p>You each remained motionless but for the gentle stroking of his fingers through your hair and the soothing pattern of your synchronised breaths for the duration of a number of songs, and you felt your eyelids begin to get heavy. You fought against the fatigue that was threatening to overcome you, reluctant to allow sleep steal time from you both, although you knew it would ultimately be a losing battle.</p><p>You had been surprised to find that you were familiar with most of the music Taehyung had been playing, and you enjoyed listening to him singing along to parts of each song which he knew best. You noted that his singing voice was startlingly impressive, pleasant even in its hushed, breathy tones. Where he didn&rsquo;t know the words he hummed along to the melody softly and tapped his free hand against his leg, seemingly swept away entirely in the music.</p><p>Finally a song began to play that you did not recognise, and it was the first he had played that was in Korean. It was a beautifully simplistic composition, the subtle plucking and strumming of an acoustic guitar a perfect accompaniment to the lilting melody, and even though you couldn&rsquo;t understand the meaning of the words &ndash; save for the odd English phrase &ndash; you found yourself completely moved by it. It was almost like a lullaby, and he knew the lyrics well and sang them confidently, occasionally pulling you tighter to him as he did so, and despite your efforts you felt yourself slipping in to slumber. You were vaguely aware of your body leaning in to his more heavily as sleep finally took you, and just before you could no longer open your eyes, you thought you felt a single drop of warm rain fall on to the bare skin of your hand which still rested on his chest.</p><p>~~~</p><p>Before he joined you in sleep, he thought about the bullet he had dodged when you had clearly given him an out as far as the truth of his presence was concerned. He had no inkling as to how he should have approached the situation with you. Whenever he opened his mouth to tell you everything, the absurdity of it had hit him, and he was reminded once again of the implausibility of your relationship &ndash; if it could even be called such a thing &ndash; progressing any further than the time he was here.</p><p>He had never uttered the words &lsquo;I&rsquo;m in an idol group&rsquo; before, he never had any need to, as the majority of the time people already knew exactly who he was before he even opened his mouth. He tried to work out if it would be preferable for you to be one of those girls who were more than aware of his identity. It certainly would have made things simpler, not needing to try to articulate the actuality of his circumstances in a way that didn&rsquo;t sound far-fetched or boastful. Would you even know what an idol group was? He was more than aware that the concept of idols could very well be as foreign to you as his language was.</p><p>The fact of the matter was that in all the time he had spent with you, as brief though it may have been in the grand scheme of things, you had made him feel so utterly normal that the truth of his occupation had seemed somewhat preposterous in your presence. The closeness you had been able to cultivate so rapidly, the palpable desire for one another dragging you towards each other almost involuntarily, that was the extraordinary thing he wanted you to dumbfounded by &ndash; as he was &ndash; not his celebrity status. Not that he believed for a second that you would have been swayed either way by such a factor, he just felt as though the time limit had indubitably passed where it could be dropped in to the conversation in anything resembling a natural fashion.</p><p>As your body begin to relax and become heavier against his side, he could feel you trying to jerk yourself awake, succeeding for only a few moments before your head began to droop again, and he smiled as he pressed his lips into the hair at the crown of your head. One of his favourite songs began to play, and he congratulated himself on his playlist selection as he sang along to the lyrics and felt the meaning of the words so strongly it was as if he was hearing them for the first time. He tightened his arm around your shoulders both to keep you warm and to keep you as close to him as possible while he was still able. As the song drew to a close he was surprised to feel hot tears threatening to spill on to his cheeks, and before he could wipe his eyes with his free hand, a single tear rolled down his face and dropped from the sharp line of his jaw.</p><p>~~~</p><p>He finally woke just as the sun was beginning to rise, just at that point of dawn when the sun&rsquo;s dim light casts the landscape in an otherworldly glow. Somehow in the night you had both shifted slightly lower, although you were still resting in the crook of his arm, your face turned slightly upwards so he could clearly see your eyelashes resting on your cheeks, your lips slightly parted. The air remained mild, but there was a slight morning chill which had rendered the flesh of your face ice-cold against his skin. Taehyung carefully removed his arm from around your frame, lifting your head gingerly before lowering it on to his folded up coat. He rubbed his palms together to heat his fingers before shuffling down to lie on his side to face you, and raised his hands to press them against your cheeks to warm them, trying not to laugh aloud at the way your face scrunched up at the unexpected contact.</p><p>After a few moments, satisfied he had taken the edge away from the cold, he pulled the blankets up to his own chin, then arranged them about your shoulders to keep the warmth in the fleece cocoon he had created for you both. He raised his arm to lean his head against it and found himself amused by the minute changes in your expression as the breeze moved errant strands of hair to tickle against you. He delicately pushed back the offending hair and smiled fondly as you seemed to try and nuzzle your head in to his hand the way a cat might.</p><p>He returned his arm to the confines of the blanket and rested his hand lightly just above the dip of your waist and closed his eyes again, his face a picture of contentment as he closed his eyes and wiggled his way down further in to the covers, opening his eyes again &ndash; just for a second &ndash; almost as if he were checking that you were still there.</p><p>The thought suddenly occurred to him that this was the first time he had seen you in daylight, and he was struck with an urge to kiss you as a means of marking the occasion, even if it were only for his benefit. He moved to press a kiss to your forehead, but as he shifted the blankets to bring his body closer to yours, the fleece corner covering your shoulder slipped to the ground. Taehyung&rsquo;s attention was abruptly pulled to the bare skin the movement had exposed, and any innocent thoughts he may have been entertaining were instantaneously overcome by an intense want. The satin shirt had shifted in sleep, making it appear as though it had been pushed from your shoulders in some passionate embrace.</p><p>He was all at once dizzy with the urge to graze his teeth open-mouthed along the curve of your shoulder, to have his tongue swipe briefly against it. He wanted to drag the rest of the shirt down, and he could almost envision his trembling fingers grasping the material to present more to his eyes, his lips, his teeth. A brief image flashed in his mind of his one of his hands curled, gripped around that shoulder, the other placed on the small of your naked back as you arched and moaned his name and &ndash;</p><p>Your eyes bore in to his. &ldquo;Taehyung?&rdquo; You breathed out his name as a question and he could only imagine what he must look like to you. He could feel his mouth was agape as his eyes fixated on your bare skin and dishevelled clothes, and he averted his gaze from you swiftly, suddenly bashful.</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;sorry&hellip; &rdquo; Still unable to meet your eyes he reached towards you without looking and attempted to adjust the shirt so it covered you again and buried his face in to his arm, groaning in embarrassment.</p><p>&ldquo;Taehyung,&rdquo; you repeated. He could hear you were closer and he opened his eyes to find you leaning over him, your eyes roaming over his face as though you were trying to commit it to memory.</p><p>He watched entranced as you lowered your face to his, pausing briefly as your lips were mere centimetres apart, flicking your eyes upwards to meet his gaze, before closing the distance and pressing your lips together, waves of arousal coursing through his veins like electric currents at the contact. He let you take the lead, still wary that you had caught him brazenly gawking at you and reluctant to approach any lines that you weren&rsquo;t ready to cross.</p><p>Any concern he may have had about your willingness to progress things further were quickly assuaged as you grabbed the collar of his t-shirt and pulled him forcefully in to a seated position, continuing to kiss him passionately as you did so, gripping his face between your hands as you took his bottom lip between yours and sucked lightly, swinging one of your legs over both of his and seating yourself over his thighs.</p><p>You broke away from the kiss abruptly, and Taehyung found himself chasing your lips with his own as you sat back on your haunches, meeting his eyes again fiercely as you slipped the satin shirt from your shoulders. As you discarded the garment behind you, he stared &ndash; awestruck &ndash; as you reached slowly towards the strap on your left shoulder and hooked your thumb beneath it, dragging the thin material down and biting gently down on your bottom lip.</p><p>Whatever restraint Taehyung was held back by finally snapped, and he lurched forward to crush his chest against yours, stretching upwards to meet your lips, kissing you harder than he had before, muffled grunts spilling forth from his throat against your mouth. A soft whimper escaped you as you gripped his biceps to steady yourself, and he placed his hands on the strip of flesh between your vest and your pyjama bottoms to hold you tighter against his body, feeling goosebumps rise beneath the pads of his fingers. He spread his long digits outwards and upwards so they rested slightly beneath the material of your top, his tongue running along the seam of your lips which you parted instantly to allow him to deepen the kiss further.</p><p>Keeping one hand on your back, he moved the other to your ribcage and ran his thumb along the underside of your breast. He broke the kiss to meet your eyes. &ldquo;Okay?&rdquo; he was out of breath and almost out of his mind with desire but your arousal was glaringly obvious to him, and as you ground down mindlessly in to his lap he inhaled in a hiss at the friction.</p><p>&ldquo;Please.&rdquo; Your response left you in a breathy moan and Taehyung needed no further encouragement to progress.</p><p>Using the hand on your back to pull you closer still, he buried his head in to the crook of your neck and pressed his open lips to your throat. He ran his tongue teasingly along the soft skin towards the curve of your shoulder and sucked lightly, the hand at your ribcage ascending to palm the supple skin of your breast, swiping his thumb over it&rsquo;s taut peak, feeling it harden further beneath his touch.</p><p>He became only vaguely aware that he was rolling his hips upward to meet the apex of your thighs, his body seemingly acting purely on instinct, desperate to continue eliciting the delicious moans you were gifting him with. He moved his lips away from your neck to gaze up at you with lidded eyes, his teeth biting in to his bottom lip in concentration, keeping his hand splayed across the small of your back and moving the other to grip your hip to guide the back and forth movement of your core over his increasing hardness.</p><p>You lowered your hands to grip the hem of his t-shirt and lifted it over his head, and you dragged your fingernails lightly down his bare chest towards the waist band of his jeans, causing a shiver to travel through Taehyung&rsquo;s body as his hips reflexively bucked upward at the sensation of your fingers teasingly dipping in to the elastic of his boxers. </p><p>What could only be described as a growl emanated from his chest, and he wrapped one arm around your back and twisted your bodies so your back landed against the fleece blankets on the ground. The sudden jolt and the sheer intensity of Taehyung&rsquo;s stare caused you to laugh breathlessly, reaching up to drag his face back to yours to kiss him again hotly before pressing your forehead against his. &ldquo;Taehyung,&rdquo; you moaned against his lips, &ldquo;please.&rdquo;</p><p>He drew back, his eyes scanning your face for any signs that he had misunderstood your plea. Content that he had not, he pulled you to sit up and lifted your vest top over your head before reaching down to unbuckle his belt and unzip his jeans, his eyes never breaking contact with yours as he did so. You pushed your pyjama bottoms down and kicked them away, leaning back against your elbows, your knees bent and parted in a silent invitation.</p><p>He eagerly complied, climbing his way up your body and leaning on one elbow so as not to crush you beneath him, shifting his weight to lay himself between your thighs, using his spare hand to tangle in to your hair, tilting your head to allow him greater access to the cavern of your mouth as his tongue stroked along yours greedily, swallowing your moans as he ground himself against your heat through the two thin layers of material that acted as the only remaining barrier between you.</p><p>He released his hand from your hair and stroked it down the side of your neck and over your breast, squeezing the flesh there and lowering his head to lick over the peak, sucking it in to his mouth while his hand continued it&rsquo;s descent, stopping at the waistband of your underwear with the sole purpose of flicking his eyes upwards momentarily to take in the look on your face as his hand dipped beneath the material and stroked tentatively against your heat for the first time.</p><p>His mouth continued it&rsquo;s ministrations on your breast as he ran his fingers through your wetness, letting the pad of his thumb circle over the bundle of nerves, before his fingers slipped easily inside you. He was fascinated watching you as you tilted your head back and alternated between pulling at your own hair and tugging at the roots of his while involuntarily rolling your hips to meet the pumping of his fingers.</p><p>&ldquo;Taehyung. I need you, please.&rdquo; You managed to cry out between moans, and he swore he could feel the blood rush to already hard length at the neediness in your tone.</p><p>He made his way back up your body to kiss your lips chastely and stroke the mussed hair out of your face, before reaching up to somewhere behind your head to retrieve his wallet from his coat and remove a square foil packet from within it. He kicked off his boxers and resumed his position between your thighs. &ldquo;<i>Dangshineun daedanhaeyo.</i>&rdquo; He whispered the words before slanting his mouth over yours and kissing you deeply as you lifted your legs to rest at his hips.</p><p>Poised to enter you, he paused - following all the heat, urgency, intensity - a moment of serenity. He wanted to see how your face would change by the intrusion of him. Would your eyes widen or flutter closed as he stretched you open? Would your lips fall open with a moan or would you hold your breath, only exhaling after your warm softness had been filled by his hard length? He felt his face become calm as he looked intently at you through his dark lashes, biting gently down on the left side of his bottom lip in something resembling concentration, before the push and the slick and the give and finally he filled you.</p><p>He held himself still to allow you to adjust to his size, and you could easily see the effort it took for him to resist. You had seen a similar expression of restraint on his face when he&rsquo;d pinned you against the wall outside his hotel room the night before. His eyes were screwed shut and his breathing was laboured, a barely supressed moan rumbling in the back of his throat.</p><p>You placed your hand on the side of his face to urge him to look at you, willing him to move with your eyes as you tried to shift your own hips beneath him. It didn&rsquo;t take him long to understand and he drew back his hips, almost leaving your body entirely before pushing forward agonisingly slow so you could feel every inch of him.</p><p>You gasped at the friction of his body rubbing against the apex of your sex as he filled you to the hilt, rolling his hips maddeningly to continue the stimulation, and you began to claw at his shoulders as you quickly felt your orgasm build. He pressed his forehead against yours, murmuring your name as his lips parted and his eyes grew wide in awe as he watched you begin to come undone under his attention.</p><p>The sight of your arching back and the sound of his name falling from your lips in a chant seemed to push him towards his own end, his thrusts becoming erratic as his teeth sunk in to his bottom lip in an effort to muffle his deep groans. He pushed in to you roughly one final time and kissed you hard, his lips moving furiously over yours before his movements finally stilled.</p><p>As his breathing became more stable, Taehyung moved to lay beside you, somehow being able to ignore the bunched up and uneven blankets to nestle beneath your arm, resting his head against your still heaving chest. He tightened his arms around you and sighed happily, any tension or unease he may have felt hours ago the furthest thing from his mind as he hummed contentedly at the feel of your fingertips lazily drawing patterns up and down the smooth skin of his back.</p><p>He inattentively heard the sound if his phone buzzing against the hard concrete surface of the roof and found himself wishing the battery had run down entirely as you slept. He reached behind himself blindly and felt around for the source of the disturbance, finally grasping the device and bringing it begrudgingly in front of his face.</p><p>The display on the screen informed him it was just before 8am. It also alerted him to numerous updates in the group chat with the rest of the members, a couple of messages from Jimin, and - somewhat more worryingly - a multitude of missed calls from Seong-min. At that point feeling too euphoric to be overly concerned, he pushed on the power button until it gave the long buzz of confirmation that the handset was switching off. He never got up earlier than 10am unless they were travelling, so no one would expect him to be awake yet either way, and the only thing on the schedule for that day was much later in the afternoon: a recorded interview for some podcast he&rsquo;d never heard of. </p><p>&ldquo;Everything alright, Taehyung?&rdquo; you murmured, somehow managing to sound even more blissed-out than he felt. </p><p>He linked the fingers of one hand through yours and brought it to his lips, before pressing his cheek in to your open palm. &ldquo;Perfect,&rdquo; he said carefully, and at that moment in time, he really believed that everything could be. </p><p><b>A/N - <i>Hope you all made it to the end!

Neither of you truly wanted to allow the truth of your situation to seep in to the fantasy land you had created for yourselves of the rooftop that night, but it seemed foolish to wholly deny it for much longer.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Three days.&rdquo; A pained expression crossed your face as if you had been punched in the stomach and you could see your sadness reflected in Taehyung&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Do you want to know why I&rsquo;m here?&rdquo; His question sounded strained, forced, as if he were following cue cards that he wasn&rsquo;t convinced were for him to read, and you felt apprehension begin to creep up from your stomach.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Because you wanted to see me?&rdquo; Your eyes were full of hope, but your tone was playfully flippant, as you tried to skirt around the significance of the question. You knew all too well he wasn&rsquo;t talking about the reason for his presence at the bar.</p>\n<p>He dropped his gaze and shook his head, smiling softly. &ldquo;Not here,&rdquo; he clarified, cupping the side of your face with his large hand before sweeping it towards the lit up skyline to clarify. &ldquo;Here.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>You had suspected there was something unusual about the situation with Taehyung, none of it had really made sense &ndash; from the luxurious hotel suite to the bemused man you had met in that same room who had threatened to call the police. You had merely pushed it to the back if your mind, simply grateful for his kindness and his company, before becoming completely entranced by his deep voice and perfect face. By the time it had occurred to you to be curious about the reason for his presence, you were already alone on the roof top of your bar, coming down from the high of your second kiss. &ldquo;Do you want to tell me?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered instantly but said nothing else, meeting your eyes with an intense gaze once more, and you knew he meant for you to see the sincerity there. &ldquo;<i>Chinshim</i>.&rdquo; He drew his knees up to his chest and dropped his forehead to rest on them, letting out a deep groan.</p>\n</p>",
