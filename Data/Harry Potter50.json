Her face was wet from sweat and tears.</p><p>&lt;&lt;I\nsaid don\u2019t\u2026&gt;&gt; </p><p>&lt;&lt;Stop\nit Weasley&gt;&gt; Snape said.</p><p>He looked\nher right arm which had a wound.</p><p>&lt;&lt;What\ndid you had in your pockets?&gt;&gt;</p><p>Ginny\nlooked at him.</p><p>&lt;&lt;Don\u2019t\ntell me that you suddenly care? A moment ago you were about to punish me for\nsomething that I never did.&gt;&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt;I\njust need to know what cause this wound&gt;&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt;I\nhad a little jar. It obviously broke. Now can I get back to my dormitory?\n&gt;&gt;</p><p>Snape noticed\nin her eyes abhorrence. But there was something else too. Something like\nweakness. No, he knew that Ginny Weasley was one of the bravest and strongest\nstudents in Hogwarts. But right now, in his eyes she was fragile.</p><p>He took her\narm, he pulled his wand and he whispered a spell. Suddenly the wound\ndisappeared like it never existed.</p><p>He squeezed\nher for a little, and he caress her long red hair. Ginny was hearing his heart\nbeating and a warmth enfold her. A warmth that scared her.</p><p>&lt;&lt;All\nright thank you. I will get back to my dormitory now.&gt;&gt;</p><p>Snape\nstopped caressing her hair and he left her from his arms. Then he stood up and\nhe gave his hand to Ginny. Ginny ignored him and she stood up on her own, but\nshe stumbled and she was about to fell again if Snape hadn\u2019t pull her towards\nhim with a result to fell in his arms again. </p><p>She looked\nat him and without knowing why she approached her face to his.</p><p>&lt;&lt;Well\nI will accompany you to your dormitory.&gt;&gt; Said Snape calmly.</p><p>&lt;&lt;Yes&gt;&gt;\nSaid Ginny dazed.</p><p>They were\nwalking without hurry to the Gryffindor Common Room.</p><p>&lt;&lt;What\nis wrong with me? &gt;&gt; Ginny thought.</p><p>At the\nlight of her wand she was able to see a sardonic smile upon Snape\u2019s face.</p><p>&lt;&lt;Potter\ntaught all of you well how to \u00a0saunter\nduring the night. Such a same, I thought that the Weasleys were smarter than\nthat but I guess I was wrong.&gt;&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt;Shut\nit&gt;&gt; </p><p>&lt;&lt;Excuse\nme what did you said?&gt;&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt;nothing&gt;&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt;I\ncan hear him even in the way you talk.&gt;&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt;He\nnever told us to do anything. If you want to speak in a bad way about someone\nspeak for me not for someone who is trying to save us from Voldemort. Two years\nago when you were in the Order I thought that I can trust you but I can see\nthat I was wrong. And I\u2019ve never been so wrong in my whole life except for when\nI trusted Riddle on my first year. &gt;&gt; She said in anger.</p><p>She passed\nhim by and she run away. Once more her eyes were filled with tears. She turned\nto a corner but there was Amycus waiting for her. </p><p>&lt;&lt;Well,\nwhat do we have here?&gt;&gt; Amycus said and he grabbed her from her wrist.\n&lt;&lt;Miss Weasley&gt;&gt; he continued and he pushed her against the wall.\n&lt;&lt;What are we going to do with you Now that the mouse got caught? What\ndid you did this time?&gt;&gt; He said while he was approaching his face to\nhers close enough so Ginny was able to smell his filthy breath.</p><p>&lt;&lt;I\nhaven\u2019t done anything&gt;&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt;You\ndare lie to me? &gt;&gt; He said and he slapped her with force.</p><p>Ginny fell\non the ground. </p><p>&lt;&lt;Crucio&gt;&gt;\nAmycus screamed.</p><p>&lt;&lt;Please\u2026\nplease stop it&gt;&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt;But\nyou have to consider yourself lucky. \u00a0If\nGreyback was here you would have been his dinner. &gt;&gt; </p><p>&lt;&lt;Amycus&gt;&gt;\n</p><p>Amycus\nturned. </p><p>&lt;&lt;Severus,\nI caught her wandering&gt;&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt;Amycus\nI would prefer to inform me before you punish a student. &gt;&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt;I\njust wanted to give her a lesson&gt;&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt;I\nknow and I don\u2019t disagree, but now I take over. Thank you&gt;&gt;</p><p>He\napproached Ginny and he forced her to stand up while he was grabbing her from\nher shoulders. She wasn\u2019t able to stand.</p><p>&lt;&lt;Hold\non just for a little bit&gt;&gt; She heard Snape\u2019s voice in her head. </p><p>Ginny was\nsurprised. </p><p>&lt;&lt;Well\nAmycus you can go now. Be certain that she is going to get punished.&gt;&gt; </p><p>&lt;&lt;Very\nwell! Goodnight.&gt;&gt;</p><p>Amycus left\nand Snape relaxed his handles. Ginny leaned on him. She was feeling safe. </p><p>&lt;&lt;Weasley\ncan you walk?&gt;&gt;</p><p>Ginny shook\nher head negatively. She leaned on the wall behind her and then she inflected\nher knees and she shitted down.</p><p>Snape was\nlooking at her with a sad look in his eyes.</p><p>&lt;&lt;Don\u2019t\ntell me now that you are feeling bad for what happened to me tonight.&gt;&gt;</p><p>Snape\nsmiled. He approached her and he shitted beside her.</p><p>&lt;&lt;Who\nelse is out tonight?&gt;</p><p>Ginny\nwasn\u2019t sure if she had to tell him or not. In the end she decided to tell him.</p><p>&lt;&lt;\nLuna and Neville.&gt;&gt; </p><p>&lt;&lt;Let\u2019s\nfind them before the Carrows&gt;&gt; Snape said hastily.</p><p>Ginny\ncouldn\u2019t believe her ears. </p><p>Snape help her to stand. Then they start running in\nthe corridors. They saw Neville ready to through a stinky bomb out of Snape\u2019s\noffice.</p><p>&lt;&lt;Neville\nno&gt;&gt; \u00a0</p><p>Neville\nturned and looked at them. He hastily hide the stinky bomb away when he saw\nSnape.</p><p>&lt;&lt;What\nis it? What happened?&gt;&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt;Well!\nYour plan failed and we decided to find you before the Carrows if that\u2019s ok\nwith you Longbottom&gt;&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt;And\nwhy did the headmaster caught you Ginny?&gt;&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt;I\nwas careless tonight Neville.&gt;&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt;That\u2019s\nok. What is going to be our punishment?&gt;&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt;You\nspecifically Longbottom go and find Lovegood. Now&gt;&gt;</p><p>Neville\nleft.</p><p>&lt;&lt;Who\u2019s\nidea was that Weasley?&gt;&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt;Mine&gt;&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt;Well,\nyou shouldn\u2019t be proud of it. Firstly it failed and secondly we are not going\nto leave sooner from Hogwarts in that way. &gt;&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt;I\u2019ll\nnever stop fighting you. You have never been in our place. We are getting\npunished because we choose not to punish first year students. Even if you\nhadn\u2019t kill Dumbledore I am sure that you would care more to save yourself\nfirst. You wouldn\u2019t even try to go against them and to put your life in danger.\nAm I wrong? I wonder why I keep talking to you. And why I trusted you again.\n&gt;&gt; </p><p>Snape\ngrabbed her from her arm, he pulled her against the wall behind her and he\napproached his face to hers.

If you want to speak in a bad way about someone\nspeak for me not for someone who is trying to save us from Voldemort. Two years\nago when you were in the Order I thought that I can trust you but I can see\nthat I was wrong. And I\u2019ve never been so wrong in my whole life except for when\nI trusted Riddle on my first year. &gt;&gt; She said in anger.</p><p>She passed\nhim by and she run away. Once more her eyes were filled with tears.

We are getting\npunished because we choose not to punish first year students. Even if you\nhadn\u2019t kill Dumbledore I am sure that you would care more to save yourself\nfirst. You wouldn\u2019t even try to go against them and to put your life in danger.\nAm I wrong? I wonder why I keep talking to you. And why I trusted you again.\n&gt;&gt; </p><p>Snape\ngrabbed her from her arm, he pulled her against the wall behind her and he\napproached his face to hers.

I have done things that I regret and that you\ncannot even imagine.&gt;&gt; Said Snape with anger.</p><p>He drawled\nback. Ginny was feeling bad for what she said. It was true that she knew almost\nnothing for that man. She looked at him.

I was far from Amycus\u2019s office&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt;Well\ngoodnight.&gt;&gt; Luna said</p><p>&lt;&lt;Goodnight&gt;&gt;\nSaid Neville and Ginny at the same time.</p><p>Ginny was\nthinking. He saved me twice tonight and I was awful to him. I shouldn\u2019t spoke\nto him that way. I shouldn\u2019t have lost my temper. And what if he isn\u2019t that\nbad?

He protected you. But\ndon\u2019t you see? I am pretty sure that he is trying to take us with his side. He\njust doesn\u2019t want to have problems with You- Know-Who. It is obvious. He is\njust trying to save himself. He doesn\u2019t care for us at all.
