Those were the moments you found yourself sitting on the porch with a cup of coffee in your head, watching the clouds painted in familiar purple colors.</p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mine. Forever.&rdquo; </i></p><p>Tears welled up in your eyes. His voice was still so clear in your head; his purple eyes still present in your dreams every night. </p><p>&ldquo;Mom?! Come and find me!&rdquo; </p><p>The voice of your daughter woke you up from your thoughts. Smiling, you got up on your feet and dried the tears away. </p><p>&ldquo;I will never find you, Sola. You&rsquo;re too good at this game,&rdquo; you said with a soft laugh as you began searching for her. Squinting your eyes, you scanned the front yard and the area around the barn but saw nothing out of the ordinary. Walking over to the barn, you went inside and started to look around. You spotted two zink buckets which you knew there was only one of. </p><p>Crossing your arms, you smiled. &ldquo;Found you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Mom\u2026,&rdquo; Sola whined and transformed back to her own green form, giving you a grumpy look. </p><p>You laughed heartily and crouched down in front of her. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting the hang of it, but remember next time; make sure you&rsquo;re hiding the thing you&rsquo;re shapeshifting into first.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, mom,&rdquo; she replied, her grumpy look turning sad. &ldquo;Will he ever come for us, mommy?&rdquo; </p><p>Your heart ached at her words, ached seeing the sadness in the purple eyes she shared with her father. She was way too smart for her age, understood far more than human children. Sometimes it was just like talking to an adult trapped in a child&rsquo;s body. </p><p>You took her in your arms, hugged her tight while stroking her shoulder-length hair. A human trait she got from you. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Sola. I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; It was the truth; you couldn&rsquo;t lie to her. The one thing you hadn&rsquo;t told her was that Talos didn&rsquo;t know about her. He had left the day after she had been conceived. </p><p>You sat her down on the ground again, grasping her shoulders as you gave her an encouraging smile. &ldquo;But we manage fine on our own, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; </p><p>Sola smiled back and nodded, but she was just as bad as you were hiding the sadness in her eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you and me forever, kid,&rdquo; you said, raising your fist. Sola giggled and bumped her fist against yours. Yes, it was you and her forever. </p><p>***</p><p>Talos paced back and forth on the bridge of the ship, shouting orders to his soldiers. War hadn&rsquo;t plagued the Skrulls for two decades, but now the Kree had caught up with them. Their bombs had destroyed the surface of the planet that the Skrulls had lived on ever since Carol ended the wars. But, she couldn&rsquo;t be everywhere, and now the Skrulls had to survive on their own. With their light-speed engines, those who survived could escape to another Galaxy, hoping that this time the Kree wouldn&rsquo;t find them. </p><p>With one last look at the planet they called home for two decades, Talos ordered the ship around. The rest of the Skrull ships followed in his path. Talos walked up to the window, gazing out on space swishing by him, and came to think about you. After all this time, he could still feel you in his arms, hear your voice in his dreams. For so long, he had wanted to go back to earth to see you again, but his bravery always faltered, his mind tormenting him with doubts. What if you had found someone else, forgot about him? But deep down, he knew you. Knew you would never forget him just as he would never forget you. </p><p>So, perhaps\u2026perhaps now was the perfect time for him to take a little side trip to earth? He trusted his closest commander to search for a new home while he was away and for his army to protect his people. And maybe\u2026hopefully, you would go with him. When he left earth all those years ago, he had asked you to go with him. But you couldn&rsquo;t, for the same reason he couldn&rsquo;t stay. You both felt obligated and took honor in protecting your people. But maybe things had changed now? A lot could happen in five years\u2026</p><p>***</p><p>It was late in the afternoon, and you were preparing dinner when there was a knock on the door. Frowning, you wiped your hands off on a towel. Who could that be? You didn&rsquo;t get many visitors out here; you had made sure of that. Not all humans met your daughter&rsquo;s appearance with kindness, and she was still learning to control her shapeshifting. That was the reason you left S.H.I.E.L.D and moved to the middle of nowhere. To keep her safe was your main priority.</p><p>Putting the towel down on the counter, you walked out to the hallway and cautiously opened the front door. Outside stood a middle-aged aged man with grey hair and bright, blue eyes behind a pair of glasses. You eyed him up and down suspiciously, the suit telling you he wasn&rsquo;t from around here. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; The man was staring at you without a word, and a heavy silence settled in the atmosphere. Squirming, you gave the man a nervous smile. &ldquo;Can I help you?&rdquo;</p><p>The man smiled, tears glittering in his blue eyes. &ldquo;Y/N -&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Mommy, can you help me with my hair? I want a braid!&rdquo; Sola came running up behind you, and the man silenced, staring at her in shock. Sola hid behind you, hugging your leg tightly and fluttered her gaze down as the man kept staring at her. You placed a protective hand on her head, eyeing the man again with a suspicious look.</p><p>&ldquo;How do you know my name?&rdquo; </p><p>The man&rsquo;s gaze went back to you; tears now wetting his eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N\u2026It&rsquo;s me.&rdquo; </p><p>The man transformed before your widening eyes, shapeshifting into the Skrull you never stopped loving, those purple eyes in your dreams you&rsquo;d never forgotten now gazing back at you with love and warmth and hope. Your breath caught in your throat as tears welled up in your eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Talos!&rdquo; You threw yourself into his arms, tears flowing down your face as you sobbed out of pure joy of seeing your beloved again. Your daughter was still clinging to your leg, staring up at you and this stranger who looked so much like her. </p><p>&ldquo;I never thought I would see you again,&rdquo; Talos mumbled as he pressed his forehead against yours and purred, his tear-filled eyes catching the sight of the little girl behind you. Big, purple eyes looked up at him with wonder and fright, and Talos felt his heart ache with love. </p><p>Pulling away from the embrace, you caught your daughter&rsquo;s and Talos stare and smiled, warmth filling your heart. </p><p>&ldquo;Talos. This is your daughter, Sola,&rdquo; you said softly and lifted up the four-year-old. &ldquo;Sola, this is your father, Talos.&rdquo; </p><p>The two of them continued staring at each other; Sola&rsquo;s widened eyes looking at him like a deer caught in headlights. For the first time in Talos life, he felt unable to speak. Smiling softly, he pressed his forehead gently against his daughter&rsquo;s and purred. Like a reflex, she did the same, both of them closing their eyes. Your heart burst with joy and love, tears never drying. Never had you seen such a beautiful sight. </p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;Will you come with me?&rdquo; Talos stood by the railing on the porch, looking over the fading sunset. You sat on the hammock, studying Talos tense figure, his jaw flexing as he watched the sky. The last hour you&rsquo;d spent listening to his story; about the reason he and Fury knew each other and why the Skrulls were fleeing again. You couldn&rsquo;t imagine what is what like, spending your life constantly looking over your shoulder? Was that a life for your daughter? Was it a better life than the one she would have here? Always hiding who she was? </p><p>&ldquo;I would never let anything happen to the two of you,&rdquo; he said as if he felt your doubts. </p><p>&ldquo;I know, Talos,&rdquo; you replied, then paused as your gaze caught the last ray of sunlight disappear behind the forest. &ldquo;I must talk with Sola first. Ask her was she wants. She might be young, but she&rsquo;s wise for her age. And I can&rsquo;t force her into doing something she doesn&rsquo;t want to do.&rdquo; </p><p>Talos nodded, his gaze still lingering on the sky. &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; </p><p>As expected, you knew Sola&rsquo;s answer before she gave it. For so long she had talked about her father; wondered who he was and when he would come for her. Her answer was no surprise to you and there was no hesitation in her voice nor on her happy face as she asked when it was time to leave. </p><p>&ldquo;Every day since I found out I was pregnant, my entire purpose in life has been to protect her,&rdquo; you said to Talos as you both stood at the foot of Sola&rsquo;s bed watching her sleep. </p><p>Talos took your face in his hands, leaning his forehead against yours. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you had to go through this all alone, but I&rsquo;m here now. And I&rsquo;m never letting go of either one of you ever again. </p><p>Closing your eyes, you melted into his warmth and smiled, feeling the happiest you&rsquo;d ever felt in your entire life. As long as your family was together, nothing in this universe could take your happiness away.</p><p>~THE END~</p><hr><p>***</p><p><i><b>Notes:</b> I know Humans and Skrulls can probably not conceive a child together because the Skrulls are not a carbon-based lifeform.

For so long, he had wanted to go back to earth to see you again, but his bravery always faltered, his mind tormenting him with doubts. What if you had found someone else, forgot about him?

Not all humans met your daughter\u2019s appearance with kindness, and she was still learning to control her shapeshifting. That was the reason you left S.H.I.E.L.D and moved to the middle of nowhere. To keep her safe was your main priority.</p><p>Putting the towel down on the counter, you walked out to the hallway and cautiously opened the front door. Outside stood a middle-aged aged man with grey hair and bright, blue eyes behind a pair of glasses.

I want a braid!\u201d Sola came running up behind you, and the man silenced, staring at her in shock. Sola hid behind you, hugging your leg tightly and fluttered her gaze down as the man kept staring at her. You placed a protective hand on her head, eyeing the man again with a suspicious look.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d </p><p>The man\u2019s gaze went back to you; tears now wetting his eyes. </p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026It\u2019s me.\u201d </p><p>The man transformed before your widening eyes, shapeshifting into the Skrull you never stopped loving, those purple eyes in your dreams you\u2019d never forgotten now gazing back at you with love and warmth and hope. Your breath caught in your throat as tears welled up in your eyes.</p><p>\u201cTalos!\u201d You threw yourself into his arms, tears flowing down your face as you sobbed out of pure joy of seeing your beloved again. Your daughter was still clinging to your leg, staring up at you and this stranger who looked so much like her. </p><p>\u201cI never thought I would see you again,\u201d Talos mumbled as he pressed his forehead against yours and purred, his tear-filled eyes catching the sight of the little girl behind you. Big, purple eyes looked up at him with wonder and fright, and Talos felt his heart ache with love. </p><p>Pulling away from the embrace, you caught your daughter\u2019s and Talos stare and smiled, warmth filling your heart. </p><p>\u201cTalos. This is your daughter, Sola,\u201d you said softly and lifted up the four-year-old. \u201cSola, this is your father, Talos.\u201d </p><p>The two of them continued staring at each other; Sola\u2019s widened eyes looking at him like a deer caught in headlights. For the first time in Talos life, he felt unable to speak. Smiling softly, he pressed his forehead gently against his daughter\u2019s and purred. Like a reflex, she did the same, both of them closing their eyes. Your heart burst with joy and love, tears never drying. Never had you seen such a beautiful sight. </p><p>***</p><p>\u201cWill you come with me?\u201d Talos stood by the railing on the porch, looking over the fading sunset. You sat on the hammock, studying Talos tense figure, his jaw flexing as he watched the sky. The last hour you\u2019d spent listening to his story; about the reason he and Fury knew each other and why the Skrulls were fleeing again. You couldn\u2019t imagine what is what like, spending your life constantly looking over your shoulder? Was that a life for your daughter? Was it a better life than the one she would have here? Always hiding who she was? </p><p>\u201cI would never let anything happen to the two of you,\u201d he said as if he felt your doubts. </p><p>\u201cI know, Talos,\u201d you replied, then paused as your gaze caught the last ray of sunlight disappear behind the forest. \u201cI must talk with Sola first. Ask her was she wants. She might be young, but she\u2019s wise for her age. And I can\u2019t force her into doing something she doesn\u2019t want to do.\u201d </p><p>Talos nodded, his gaze still lingering on the sky. \u201cOf course.\u201d </p><p>As expected, you knew Sola\u2019s answer before she gave it. For so long she had talked about her father; wondered who he was and when he would come for her. Her answer was no surprise to you and there was no hesitation in her voice nor on her happy face as she asked when it was time to leave. </p><p>\u201cEvery day since I found out I was pregnant, my entire purpose in life has been to protect her,\u201d you said to Talos as you both stood at the foot of Sola\u2019s bed watching her sleep. </p><p>Talos took your face in his hands, leaning his forehead against yours. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to go through this all alone, but I\u2019m here now. And I\u2019m never letting go of either one of you ever again. </p><p>Closing your eyes, you melted into his warmth and smiled, feeling the happiest you\u2019d ever felt in your entire life.

The rest of the Skrull ships followed in his path. Talos walked up to the window, gazing out on space swishing by him, and came to think about you. After all this time, he could still feel you in his arms, hear your voice in his dreams. For so long, he had wanted to go back to earth to see you again, but his bravery always faltered, his mind tormenting him with doubts. What if you had found someone else, forgot about him? But deep down, he knew you. Knew you would never forget him just as he would never forget you. </p><p>So, perhaps&hellip;perhaps now was the perfect time for him to take a little side trip to earth? He trusted his closest commander to search for a new home while he was away and for his army to protect his people. And maybe&hellip;hopefully, you would go with him. When he left earth all those years ago, he had asked you to go with him. But you couldn&rsquo;t, for the same reason he couldn&rsquo;t stay. You both felt obligated and took honor in protecting your people. But maybe things had changed now? A lot could happen in five years&hellip;</p><p>***</p><p>It was late in the afternoon, and you were preparing dinner when there was a knock on the door. Frowning, you wiped your hands off on a towel. Who could that be? You didn&rsquo;t get many visitors out here; you had made sure of that. Not all humans met your daughter&rsquo;s appearance with kindness, and she was still learning to control her shapeshifting. That was the reason you left S.H.I.E.L.D and moved to the middle of nowhere. To keep her safe was your main priority.</p><p>Putting the towel down on the counter, you walked out to the hallway and cautiously opened the front door. Outside stood a middle-aged aged man with grey hair and bright, blue eyes behind a pair of glasses. You eyed him up and down suspiciously, the suit telling you he wasn&rsquo;t from around here. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; The man was staring at you without a word, and a heavy silence settled in the atmosphere. Squirming, you gave the man a nervous smile. &ldquo;Can I help you?&rdquo;</p><p>The man smiled, tears glittering in his blue eyes. &ldquo;Y/N -&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Mommy, can you help me with my hair? I want a braid!&rdquo; Sola came running up behind you, and the man silenced, staring at her in shock. Sola hid behind you, hugging your leg tightly and fluttered her gaze down as the man kept staring at her. You placed a protective hand on her head, eyeing the man again with a suspicious look.</p><p>&ldquo;How do you know my name?&rdquo; </p><p>The man&rsquo;s gaze went back to you; tears now wetting his eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&hellip;It&rsquo;s me.&rdquo; </p><p>The man transformed before your widening eyes, shapeshifting into the Skrull you never stopped loving, those purple eyes in your dreams you&rsquo;d never forgotten now gazing back at you with love and warmth and hope. Your breath caught in your throat as tears welled up in your eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Talos!&rdquo; You threw yourself into his arms, tears flowing down your face as you sobbed out of pure joy of seeing your beloved again. Your daughter was still clinging to your leg, staring up at you and this stranger who looked so much like her. </p><p>&ldquo;I never thought I would see you again,&rdquo; Talos mumbled as he pressed his forehead against yours and purred, his tear-filled eyes catching the sight of the little girl behind you. Big, purple eyes looked up at him with wonder and fright, and Talos felt his heart ache with love. </p><p>Pulling away from the embrace, you caught your daughter&rsquo;s and Talos stare and smiled, warmth filling your heart. </p><p>&ldquo;Talos. This is your daughter, Sola,&rdquo; you said softly and lifted up the four-year-old. &ldquo;Sola, this is your father, Talos.&rdquo; </p><p>The two of them continued staring at each other; Sola&rsquo;s widened eyes looking at him like a deer caught in headlights. For the first time in Talos life, he felt unable to speak. Smiling softly, he pressed his forehead gently against his daughter&rsquo;s and purred. Like a reflex, she did the same, both of them closing their eyes. Your heart burst with joy and love, tears never drying. Never had you seen such a beautiful sight. </p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;Will you come with me?&rdquo; Talos stood by the railing on the porch, looking over the fading sunset. You sat on the hammock, studying Talos tense figure, his jaw flexing as he watched the sky. The last hour you&rsquo;d spent listening to his story; about the reason he and Fury knew each other and why the Skrulls were fleeing again. You couldn&rsquo;t imagine what is what like, spending your life constantly looking over your shoulder? Was that a life for your daughter? Was it a better life than the one she would have here? Always hiding who she was? </p><p>&ldquo;I would never let anything happen to the two of you,&rdquo; he said as if he felt your doubts. </p><p>&ldquo;I know, Talos,&rdquo; you replied, then paused as your gaze caught the last ray of sunlight disappear behind the forest. &ldquo;I must talk with Sola first. Ask her was she wants. She might be young, but she&rsquo;s wise for her age. And I can&rsquo;t force her into doing something she doesn&rsquo;t want to do.&rdquo; </p><p>Talos nodded, his gaze still lingering on the sky. &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; </p><p>As expected, you knew Sola&rsquo;s answer before she gave it. For so long she had talked about her father; wondered who he was and when he would come for her. Her answer was no surprise to you and there was no hesitation in her voice nor on her happy face as she asked when it was time to leave. </p><p>&ldquo;Every day since I found out I was pregnant, my entire purpose in life has been to protect her,&rdquo; you said to Talos as you both stood at the foot of Sola&rsquo;s bed watching her sleep. </p><p>Talos took your face in his hands, leaning his forehead against yours. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you had to go through this all alone, but I&rsquo;m here now. And I&rsquo;m never letting go of either one of you ever again. </p><p>Closing your eyes, you melted into his warmth and smiled, feeling the happiest you&rsquo;d ever felt in your entire life. As long as your family was together, nothing in this universe could take your happiness away.</p><p>~THE END~</p><hr /><p>***</p><p><i><b>Notes:</b> I know Humans and Skrulls can probably not conceive a child together because the Skrulls are not a carbon-based lifeform.

        "body": "<p><i>(Anna Boden &amp; Ryan Fleck, 2019)</i></p><p>Lacking the bombast of last years progressive Marvel super blockbuster, Black Panther, Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck\u2019s follow up to Mississippi Grind, Captain Marvel, is a comparatively much smaller film, more in line maybe with the early origin stories of the MCU, lacking as much creative flavour as a Thor or a First Avenger, but what it has, what probably puts it a step up on the DC stables own trail blazing Wonder Woman from a few years back, is that while it lacks that movies high points, the more imaginative inventiveness of its tone and classic Hollywood leanings, what it has on its side is more narrative innovation.</p><p>Not only is Captain Marvel the first of Marvel\u2019s 21 movies to be lead by a female, but unlike Wonder Woman, there is no love interest. Let\u2019s not get carried away, Brie Larson is certainly aided in keeping proceedings lively by not one but two of the better character actors of the past 25+ years in Samuel L. Jackson and Ben Mendelsohn, but the movies focus on her as an individual, and on female friendship and relationships is more refreshing still than just making a movie with a woman at the heart of it to pay some kind of lip service.</p><p>As mentioned, Jackson and Mendelsohn are as tremendous as they so often are, Jackson is just a flamethrower of charisma, here aided by entirely unobtrusive CGI you never question for a second, he is playing thirty years his junior, and that too is never really questioned for a second. With Larson (as he does with just about anyone he ever forms one with) he is part of a tremendous double team (triple team if you include Mendelsohn, quadruple team if you include the cat) and he helps make his Oscar winning co-stars first foray into blockbuster lead territory (discounting Kong: Skull Island, in which she was too vacant to remember) a successful one.\u00a0</p><p>Mendelsohn\u2019s mysterious rogue is maybe the movies highlight for me, the casualness of that Australian accent adding bags of charm to his intergalactic wanderer. At the heart of it all Larson is better than I had expected. She\u2019s been a strong dramatic actress for a long time, but roles like this require something more, a movie star charm that can hold centre stage in such a grand production. As noted, her one previous attempt (in albeit a completely different kind of role) went terribly, but here she proves herself. We all know she can nail the dramatic stuff, and she does, but she proves a dab hand at the comic stuff, the lighter stuff too. Jude Law features, but doesn\u2019t do anything he couldn\u2019t do in his sleep, Annette Bening in a small but vital role probably turns in some of her best recent work.</p><p>Still, for the quality of the cast who keep the movie an enjoyable experience, and for the aforementioned rare approach to narrative, the movie is nowhere near the strongest Marvel efforts. For what is essentially a period piece there is nowhere near the flavour in the world building you get out of things like Wonder Woman, The First Avenger, even the earth bound moments from the Guardians of the Galaxy movies, nor the iconic feel lent the character that the first Captain America got so right. There is a lack of scope, a smallness, pretty amazing for a movie spanning time and space that leaves the whole thing feeling slight and inconsequential in spite of all that it does right.\u00a0</p><p>Indeed, the writing is commendable in the way it doesn\u2019t hammer you too much with exposition, letting information pass relatively slowly to the viewer as things progress.\u00a0To some that could probably prove a frustrating quality, and indeed the movies opening stages until the arrival on earth take some getting used to (would surely improve on a rewatch) and kind of take you aback, but its a quality to be admired, and certainly one that rewards revisits to the movie.\u00a0It\u2019s just a shame all the admirable qualities in the writing are sort of let down by the unremarkable moviemaking, the relatively small scale feel of the introduction of a character clearly intended for major things in this grander universe can\u2019t help but feel a little anticlimactic. Not enough to marvel at, Captain.</p>",

Let\u2019s not get carried away, Brie Larson is certainly aided in keeping proceedings lively by not one but two of the better character actors of the past 25+ years in Samuel L. Jackson and Ben Mendelsohn, but the movies focus on her as an individual, and on female friendship and relationships is more refreshing still than just making a movie with a woman at the heart of it to pay some kind of lip service.</p><p>As mentioned, Jackson and Mendelsohn are as tremendous as they so often are, Jackson is just a flamethrower of charisma, here aided by entirely unobtrusive CGI you never question for a second, he is playing thirty years his junior, and that too is never really questioned for a second. With Larson (as he does with just about anyone he ever forms one with) he is part of a tremendous double team (triple team if you include Mendelsohn, quadruple team if you include the cat) and he helps make his Oscar winning co-stars first foray into blockbuster lead territory (discounting Kong: Skull Island, in which she was too vacant to remember) a successful one.\u00a0</p><p>Mendelsohn\u2019s mysterious rogue is maybe the movies highlight for me, the casualness of that Australian accent adding bags of charm to his intergalactic wanderer.
