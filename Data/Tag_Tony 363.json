You were a mess, it was difficult to\nconcentrate at work. The choice had been to take break, your mindset was too\nbad to take care of your patients. Anytime the phone rang, there was the hope\nthat you\u2019d hear Tony\u2019s voice mixed with the dread of Rhodey telling you he\u2019d\nnever come home.\u00a0<br/></p><!-- more --><p><i>He\u2019s\ncoming home. He might not be home now. Later, who knows? He\u2019s coming home one\nday soon.\u00a0</i><br/></p><p>The stress\nof Tony missing and Ro constantly, tearfully asking for him were too much to\nhandle. Ro wasn\u2019t accustomed to not being able to talk or see Tony when she\nwanted. It had been his one of his biggest rules. Tony had never felt he was\nallowed to talk to Howard at anytime unless Howard directly acknowledged him.\nHe didn\u2019t want that with Ro. So anytime Ro said she wanted to speak to her\nfather she did. Now she didn\u2019t understand why whenever she asked you said \u2018no\u2019\nor \u2018he\u2019s doing something, he can\u2019t talk right now.\u2019 She didn\u2019t like these new\nchanges.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cMommy,\ndaddy no lo\u2019 us,\u201d she said, after you told her he couldn\u2019t talk for seemingly\nthe millionth time since he went missing.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You rubbed\nyour face in frustration, \u201cBaby, your daddy loves you a lot. He just can\u2019t talk\nfor a while.\u201d<br/></p><p>She looked\nat you angrily, god that looked so much like Alex. \u201cYes, he can!\u201d Ro yelled and\nthus began another tantrum. \u201cI want my daddy! I want my daddy!\u201d<br/></p><p>Honestly,\nyou didn\u2019t blame her. You\u2019d throw a tantrum too if you could.\u00a0<br/></p><p>The days\nbled into a month and you tried to move life on as always. Business as usual.\nThough business was a hell of a lot harder without Tony at your side helping\nout. You repressed the pain and through yourself into your work. Maybe, if you\nhelped enough people, whatever force there was would give you back your best\nfriend.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Rhodey was\nworking as hard as he could to find Tony. It weighed on you, but it had to be\nworse for Rhodey. He was supposed to protect him. He\u2019d been taking care of Tony\nsince he was that young naive kid people thought they could take advantage of\nin parties at MIT. Resources to look for Tony were restricted. Everyone kept\nsaying that Rhodey\u2019s searches were a lost cause, but he\u2019d gain enough respect\nfor them to humor him. Hoping as the second month rolled past he\u2019d give\nup.\u00a0<br/></p><p>As if\nJames Rhodes would ever give up on Tony Stark.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Company\nwise, the man you had seen at the Stark\u2019s funeral was doing press. He seemed to\nbe taking over in Tony\u2019s absence. Something about him seemed off, but you knew\nbetter than to judge by public appearances. Besides, if he was to take over\nwhen Tony wasn\u2019t around, that meant Tony trusted him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Some\nmorning news show was playing as background noise.<br/></p><p>\u201cSo,\nStane, it\u2019s been close to three months. How is the company doing without Stark\nat the head?\u201d the host asked.<br/></p><p>\u201cThe company\nkeeps going the way it always does,\u201d he answered, \u201cI only hope to run it the\nway Tony would want.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cLong\nvacations, clubs, alcohol, and girls,\u201d the host joked.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Obadiah\nlaughed, \u201cExactly.\u201d<br/></p><p>Was Tony\nreally just a cheap joke to them when he\u2019d been missing so long now? You turned\noff the TV. Tony Stark was more than people made him out to be and you didn\u2019t\nneed to hear what they thought. He was more than the party scene. He was\nloving, caring, hardworking, held his emotions to his chest, and used\nsunglasses as a way to hide himself. Someone that was a genius by every\nmeasure, striving to push the world into a better future. A man that would\nraise someone else\u2019s child as his own, oddly enough something he had jokingly\npromised the day you met, and try with all his might to not repeat the sins of\nhis father. But all they saw was the alcoholic partier. A flat 2D image. Maybe\none day he\u2019d get to prove them all wrong.\u00a0<br/></p><p>The phone\nrang.<br/></p><p>-</p><p>An explosion,\nthat\u2019s all it took to change it all.\u00a0<br/></p><p>A second\nago he was cracking cheap jokes and posing for a picture, the next there\u2019s\nscreaming, gunfire, and death. That soldier wasn\u2019t much more than a\nkid&hellip;\u00a0<br/></p><p>It takes a\nmoment to recover from the shock and fear. His brain finally kicking into\nflight mode. They\u2019re aiming at the Humvee, taking out all of the soldiers is\ntheir mission, he needs to get away from here. He runs out, there\u2019s no where to\ngo in the rainfall of bullets and explosives, but he manages to find a rock to\ntake cover behind.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Pulling\nout his phone, he frantically starts to shoot out a text. A whistle blows\nthrough the air and something crash lands not to far from where he is. He\nglances over to see death with his name on it.\u00a0<br/></p><p><i>Fuck, fuck,\nfuck.\u00a0</i><br/></p><p>He doesn\u2019t\nhave time to get away. He didn\u2019t design it to give anyone time to get away. The\nshock and adrenaline blocking the pain for now. Almost in disbelief he pulls\nopen his button down, blood flowing from wounds where the shrapnel pierced through\nhis vest. There\u2019s not much time to think of anything else before he passes out.\nBriefly, Tony is conscious enough to know he\u2019s being transported. He doesn\u2019t\nhave enough brain power to judge it as a good or bad thing, the pain being\ncenter focus. Tony loses consciousness again.<i>\u00a0<br/></i></p><p>Later a\nbag is pulled off of his head and he sluggishly put everything together. The\nbright lights, a camera, and a man talking as if making negotiations, all\nhighlighted with him being tied up. Something at the back of his head bit at\nhim, saying he should have spent his time with Ro instead of some reporter he\ncouldn\u2019t remember the name of. His chest was killing him. After the group makes\nwhatever message they wanted to they drag him somewhere else, his consciousness\ncoming in and out in waves.\u00a0<br/></p><p>That\u2019s\nwhen the nightmare really starts. Someone is digging into his chest, causing\nthe worst pain he\u2019s ever felt. He can\u2019t hold in his screams. Cloth is shoved\ninto his mouth and who knows how many people are holding him down when he\nattempts to thrash away. There\u2019s not even the freedom of being unconscious\nuntil the torture is done. He didn\u2019t even let go on his own, someone dragged\nhim down with chloroform.\u00a0<br/></p><p>He finally\ncame around a final time. There was a man, Tony didn\u2019t know if he was a friend\nor foe. When he tries to move, he\u2019s stopped abruptly by something&hellip;connected\nto him? Following the chords frantically, he rips off his bandages. The flesh\nraw and haggard around a machine. Tony studies the thing in his chest. It\nweighs on him, each breath bringing a new bout of pain. It wasn\u2019t any use being\na baby about pain now, he had things to figure out. Not like anyone here would\ngive him any pain medication anytime soon. He\u2019d be lucky if it didn\u2019t get\ninfected somehow.\u00a0<br/></p><p>The first\nthing that spills from his mouth is an accusatory, \u201cWhat the hell did you do to\nme?\u201d<br/></p><p>Quickly\nconnecting the dots that the man was also a prisoner. The man had taken some of\nThe shrapnel out, the pieces still inside of his chest were working to kill\nhim. All that was keeping him alive was a car battery and electromagnet.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Tony took\nin his surroundings. Dimly lit, cold, with a dank smell topping everything off.\nA camera was in place, watching him and the man. Speaking of which this man\nmust have been dying for company. He was rambling about having met himself\nbefore.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nremember&hellip;\u201d he answered gruffly, partially listening as his mind raced for\nsome kind of solution.\u00a0<br/></p><p>His roommate\nstarted recounting one of his drunken speeches. Something that happened more\nthan not. But he was a functional alcoholic so what did it matter if he could\nstill get the job done. He paid little mind to the conversation. Banging on the\ndoor caused the man to stand hurriedly commanding him to be quiet and mimic\nhim.\u00a0<br/></p><p>A group\nwalks in, as dim as it was Tony could recognize his work anywhere. \u201cThose are\nmy guns. How did they get my guns?\u201d The words leave his mouth, he doesn\u2019t\nrealize it but they do.\u00a0<br/></p><p>His\npartner reprimands him, as one of their new guest starts talking. There\u2019s not\nmuch for him to catch beside his own name. When signaled his roommate starts to\ntranslate.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe says, \u2018Welcome Tony Stark, the most famous mass murderer in\nthe history of America&hellip;.he\u2019s honored&hellip;he wants you to build a missile&hellip;the\nJericho middle the one you demonstrated,\u201d his roommate is handed a photo and he\nshowed it to Tony, \u201cThis one.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>In a span of less than two days he had been called a Merchant of\nDeath and the most famous mass murderer. Something in him was changing, a day\nago he probably would have agreed, topping it off with a lame joke. Now? Now he\nsaw things first hand. People he wanted to fight against seemingly respected\nhim. Looking at the man defiantly, Tony responded, \u201cI refuse.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Their choice had been made. Torture into compliance. They ducked\nhis head in the water for as long as they wanted, letting him back up for the\nsmallest of gasp. He knew they wouldn\u2019t kill him. They needed him to make the\nweapon. Once the group finally got tired, they put a sack over his head and\nwalked him out of the cave. He was already counting his steps and committing\nthe directions to memory.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Blinded by\nthe sun, his eyes finally came back to focus. All around his weapons were\nscattered and thrown about. His name glaring at him from all angles. Was he\ndirectly responsible? No. But he made this all, without him they\u2019d have\nnothing. Without him those soldiers would be alive.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>He shook his captors hand, knowing well that making the Jericho\nwould get him killed. That was okay, he could work on pretenses. They didn\u2019t\nknow what went into making the weapon. Just that alone would give him some\nleeway, but they\u2019d catch on quickly. All he needed to do was be quicker. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re looking for you, Stark. But they&rsquo;d never\nfind you here in these mountains. Look, out there, what you saw? That is your\nlegacy. Your weapons in the hands of those murderers! Is that how you want to\ngo out? Is this the last act of defiance of the great Tony Stark? Or are you\ngoing to do something about it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0&quot;Why should I do anything? Either way, they&rsquo;re gonna kill\nyou and me, and if not, then I&rsquo;ll likely be dead by the end of the week&quot;\u00a0</p><p>&quot;Well then, this will be a very important week for you,\nwon&rsquo;t it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>It was the push he needed.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>First things first, to stop lugging around that car battery. The\nupgrade to an arc reactor would be the golden ticket. He did the calculations,\nalready working on how to minimize the reactor to something functional that can\nwork as fuel. Next would be a suit, something that he could use to clear the\npath.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Tony\nworked by himself, much to his roommate\u2019s annoyance. So, Tony had him scavenge\nfor the palladium. After gathering the 1.6 grams, they melted it now and poured\nit into the mold Tony had constructed. Everything was hanging on this, it was a\nlimited resource.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCareful. Careful, we only get one shot at this,\u201d Tony\nwarned.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cRelax. I have steady hands. Why do you think you\u2019re still\nalive?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Maybe knowing the name of his new lab partner would be good.\n\u201cWhat do I call you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy name is Yinsen,\u201d he answered.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYinsen, nice to meet you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony ignored the annoyed glance he was given. Sure they met before,\nbut did it really count if he was drunk off his ass? Yinsen turned into his\nright hand, it would have been impossible to form some kind of bond. They were\nall the other had.\u00a0</p><p>Once the arc reactor was completed, he showed Yinsen the suit he\nhad made a blueprint. Fifteen minutes, that\u2019s all they got for fuel. At least\nhe didn\u2019t have to worry about the shrapnel in his chest being kept at bay with\na dying battery.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGot a family?\u201d Tony asked during a game of backgammon.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes and I will see them when I leave here,\u201d Yinsen answered,\nalways so sure, \u201cAnd you Stark?\u201d<br/></p><p>Tony\nstayed quiet, trying to decide what would be the best answer. Honestly, he\ndidn\u2019t try to think of anything except the escape. If he did he got distracted,\nsad, something that couldn\u2019t sidetrack him right now. There was also the fact\nthat there could always be someone listening in. He couldn\u2019t risk it. \u201c&hellip;No.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re a man that has everything and nothing.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019d tell Yinsen about his little girl when they were\nfreed.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The days bled and blended into one another. No clue how long he\nhad been captive. Did he really want to know? Tony worked restlessly. He needed\nout. He needed to go home. All he wanted was to see his daughter and see that\nsmile of hers that looked so much like yours. That\u2019s why he worked tirelessly\nto build this suit. It was close to finished but not quite.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>His and Yinsen\u2019s captors barged in. The leader saying whatever\nabout Genghis Khan and soon it would be his turn to rule. How Stark weapons are\nthe way to secure that in this land. Only, Stark wasn\u2019t building his weapon,\nwas he? Yinsen was pushed on to his knees, a burning piece of coal was being\npushed closer and closer to his face, as he argued with the leader. Tony\nmanaged to get them to back off yelling that he needed him as an\nassistant.\u00a0<br/></p><p>When they\nleave he starts to work harder. There\u2019s no more time. Before he knew it Yinsen\nwas helping it suit up, their homemade bomb ready to go off the second someone\nopens the door. The clock is ticking, everything needs to work. Nothing can go\nwrong or malfunction right now. As he\u2019s readying up, Yinsen makes him recite\nthe directions out of the cave. There are guards yelling at them from the door.\nYinsen frantically moves faster. The bomb goes if and they both realize now\nwhatever time they had is up.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Tony talks him through on the computer. Then Yinsen goes to do\nthe finishing touches of the suit. Tony tried to remain calm, noticing how\npanicked Yinsen had become.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGet to your cover. Make sure the check points are clear before\nyou follow me out, okay?\u201d Tony spoke, while Yinsen checked the progress\nbar.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe need more time,\u201d Yensin realized, the bar creeping up too\nslowly, he turned to look at Tony, \u201cHey, I\u2019m going to buy you some time.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cStick to the plan! Stick to the plan!\u201d Tony pleads as dread\nfills him, he\u2019s restricted into the suit, he can\u2019t do anything until the system\nis loaded. Gunshots filled the air, \u201cYinsen!\u201d He glared at the laptop, willing\nfor it to go faster.\u00a0<br/></p><p>The power\ncut off as the suit, finished. Some of the men peered into the cave. Tony\nthrough himself into the mission. He needed to get out of here and find Yinsen.\nHis anger boiled over with each and everyone of his captors he met. They kept\nhim from his daughter, downed him, beat him, and made his life a living hell.\nNot to mention everything they had done to Yinsen. Now it was his turn to hurt\nthem.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>He finally made it toward the front of the cave. \u201cYinsen!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWatch out!\u201d Yinsen responded in a weak voice.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Tony narrowly missed a missile, shooting off one of his own\nquickly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cStark..\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony pushed off the package that had the man pinned down. Yinsen\nlooked weak but they couldn\u2019t stay here, \u201cC\u2019mon we gotta go. Move with me. Come\non we have a plan, we\u2019re gonna stick to it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis was always the plan, Stark,\u201d he spoke slowly, breathless.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon you\u2019re gonna go see your family, get up,\u201d he urged,\nhoping that the idea of seeing his family again would give Yinsen the spur of\nenergy that he needed.<br/></p><p>\u201cMy family\nis dead. I\u2019m going to see them now, Stark. It\u2019s okay&hellip;it\u2019s oka&hellip;\u201d he took a\nhaggard breath, \u201cI want this&hellip;.I want this.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what to do, except accept Yensin\u2019s choice. \u201cThank\nyou for saving me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDont waste it&hellip;Don\u2019t waste your life,\u201d he took one last\nlabored breath before sagging into himself.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t waste his time. He could mourn later. Right now he\nhad to destroy all of his weapons and get as far as he could. Once he made his\nway out of the cave, he met hell fire of bullets. When they ran out it was his\nturn. Everyone in his way, everything with his name on it was destroyed in\nfire. Someone obviously hit something good, because his suit started\nmalfunctioning. Taking the chance, he set fire to the rest of the weapons. With\na click or a button, he went flying off. Something there caused a chain\nreaction of explosions, just barely missing him.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Suddenly, hundreds of feet in the air, the boosters are spent.\nAll that Tony can see is the ground coming at him quickly. There\u2019s no way he\ncould make it this far for this to be the end.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The crash land caused the suit to dismantle and partially bury\nhim in the sand.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNot bad&hellip;\u201d he spoke, letting his head fall back.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>An explosion in the distance brought him out of his dazed state.\nThere was no time for rest. He pulled himself out of the wreck and sand before\npicking a direction hoping it would bring something, anything good.\u00a0<br/></p><p>It had\nbeen so long, Tony had managed a weak jog every so often. Each breath caused a\nsurge of pain to his chest, his stomach was begging for anything, and his mouth\nfelt drier than the desert around him. The thoughts keeping him going were his\nfamily, Yinsen, and every change he was going to make the second he\ncould.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>His whole life he avoided responsibility. He made the toys and\ndidn\u2019t give a hell what anyone did with them the second they were out of his\nsight. Never had he meant for this to happen. All he had wanted was to help\nprotect people on the front line. Now, he experienced, first hand, what he\ncaused. He didn\u2019t like it. There were big changes to make.\u00a0</p><p>The sound of black hawks pulled him out of his thoughts.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d He screamed, his voice rough and gritty. He fell to his\nknees, throwing up a peace sign.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Rhodey ran over to him, \u201cHow was the funvee?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Tony couldn\u2019t help much more than a laugh.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNext time you ride with me, okay?\u201d Rhodey pulled him into a\nhug.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>To hell with dad\u2019s, \u2018Stark men are made of iron.\u2019 He leaned into\nRhodey\u2019s hug, feeling safer than he ever had in his life. Tony could finally\nthink about home and know he\u2019d get there.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Hours later, Rhodey left Tony\u2019s room for a second. Tony was\nsleeping he\u2019d be okay for now. He pulled out his phone.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>He didn\u2019t go through formalities. \u201cYN, he\u2019s coming home.\u201d<br/></p><p>-</p><p>Tony was\nsafe. He was finally coming home. You could finally breathe. The stress had\nrolled off of you almost instantly the second Rhodey said it. He ended the call\nwhen he said some doctors wanted to do a check up on Tony.\u00a0</p><p>The following afternoon you were making a snack for Ro while she\nplayed with some of her toys in the kitchen. Since Tony\u2019s kidnapping, Ro had\ngrown more clingy. Not that she wasn\u2019t a cuddly kid, but sometimes she\u2019d cry as\nif you weren\u2019t going to come back when you left her with a her babysitter.\nLeaving her on those days hurt. One day, you had caught her just staring at a\npicture of Tony, sadly holding the frame. The whole situation was really\naffecting her in a way you didn\u2019t know understand. All you could do was go\nthrough some picture books with her and stay with her at all times unless it\nwas strictly necessary for you to go.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Some random news channel was playing as background noise. Ro\ndidn\u2019t know that Tony was going to come by later, a small surprise for her.\nEverything felt like it was back to normal. God, you were just happy Tony was\nsafe.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI never got to say goodbye to dad. I never got to say goodbye\nto my father,\u201d Tony\u2019s voice came from the speakers.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Ro looked at you, before running into the living room. \u201cDaddy!\nDaddy! Daddy!\u201d She stopped close to the TV, watching closely.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>This was a well worked cycle. Surprisingly the news channels\nwould recycle an old interview now and then for the Tony Stark is still missing\nfiller. Ro would run over expecting her father only to be met by a couple of\npixels. Which would be followed by a usual conversation.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You walked\nover and picked her up, \u201cAre you okay, sweetheart?\u201d\u00a0\u201cMaybe we go there and see daddy?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMaybe soon.\u201d At least this time it was something you knew for\ncertain and not something you said hopefully.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she walked back to her toys, the bear she refused to let\ngo of dragging on the floor beside her.\u00a0</p><p>Your heart clenched, but he\u2019d be here for her soon enough. She\nwouldn\u2019t be given anymore laters. Turning your attention back to the TV, more\nfocused on his appearance rather than what he was saying. He looked as okay as\nyou could expect from someone that had been captive for three months. You\ncaught Tony saying something about shutting down the weapons manufacturing\ndivision and the outburst of the press. Stane was pushing him of the stage as\nTony spoke his piece.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>That was a surprising choice, but who were you to question\neverything he had experienced and seen. Having Tony back was your primary\nconcern. Going back to the kitchen, you finished chopping up Ro\u2019s fruit.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The two of you had a quiet day. She played on her set for a\nbetter part of it and asked you to read her a couple of books outside in the\ngrass. Around sunset, you decided it would be good to get Ro bathed and settled\ndown for the night.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>While you were in the bathroom with Ro, you heard the front door\nopen and close. It had to be Tony, he was the only person that had a key to\nyour home. Quickly, you rinsed her off and took her out of the bath.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cMommy,\np\u2019eas play more in the bath,\u201d she pouted at you.\u00a0</p><p>You shook your head, \u201cSorry, Ro Bear, not today.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She started to cry as you helped her into a Buzz\nLightyear pajama set.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, c\u2019mon we don\u2019t need tears today. Tomorrow, I promise\nyou can play as long as you want in the water. Deal?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She nodded wiping her face, her lip still trembling,\u00a0\u201cAnd maybe\nbubbles?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe biggest bubbles.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Tony Bear?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201c\u2018Ony Bear is&hellip;.\u2019Ony Bear in.. I take you,\u201d She grab your hand\nand led you over towards the living room. Ro stopped short in the hallway when\nshe saw him. \u201cDaddy? Daddy!\u201d Letting go of your hand, she ran to Tony, who was\ncrouched down ready to catch her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI missed you, Rugrat,\u201d he hugged her close, pressing a kiss to\nher head. Finally, he felt like he was home.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c\u2018Issed you too. Lots a lot,\u201d she pressed kisses to his cheek,\n\u201cStay with me forever, daddy. No more work ever ever.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\nall I want is to stay with you forever,\u201d He picked up Ro, not willing to let\nher go so soon. \u201cHey, you. What happened to \u2018we don\u2019t need tears today\u2019? You\u2019re\ngetting soft on me,\u201d Tony joked, walking over to pull you into a hug, \u201cRo, I\nthink your mommy loves me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you mostest.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t insult me like that,\u201d you joked pressing a kiss to his\ncheek, \u201cYou know I love you, Tones.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love the both of you,\u201d he pulled away, from you, \u201cRo, I have\nthis cup of ice cream with rainbow sprinkles. I don\u2019t think I can eat it\nmyself, help me out?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Tony walked over to the kitchen to grab the ice cream, Ro\u2019s arms\naround his neck keeping him in a hug. You let the two of them have their time\ntogether, soon enough you\u2019d get to talk to Tony.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cKnow my abc\u2019s now,\u201d Ro said, opening her mouth for another spoonful.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo way. Do it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA, b, c, d, m, n, o, w, now I know my abc\u2019s,\u201d she sang.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI like this remix. You really just took the meat of that song\nand threw out all of the annoying bits. What do you say your mommy and I teach\nyou the old people version sometime?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWith \u2018Ony Bear.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou got\nit.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The two of them had a conversation over ice cream. Happily\nignoring everything in the world together. Ro stayed on Tony\u2019s lap the entire\ntime, neither one of them wanted to be apart from each other. It was cute, sad\nwhen you thought of why, but they needed to be close.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know Ro, you and your mommy are two of the most beautiful\npeople I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he said, patting her back while she laid against him.\u00a0</p><p>She yawned resting her head against his shoulder, \u201cDaddy\u2019s\npretty too. Mommy says so.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYour mommy always thought I was pretty, but I think it\u2019s time\nfor you to get some sleep, Ro.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan I sleep with you daddy?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He stood and took her to your room. Ro was curled up against him\nas soon as he laid down beside her. Quietly he sang her, Here Comes the Sun,\nslowly lulling her to sleep. Tony laid there with her for a while,\ncontemplating. A small part of him, thought he wouldn\u2019t have made it back home.\nNow, he was going to throw that away and start a mission. He always promised Ro\nhe\u2019d be the best he could to even be worthy of being her father, maybe this was\nthe way to go.\u00a0<br/></p><p>He pressed\na kiss to her head before he slid out from under Ro. As comfortable as he was\nhe wanted to talk to you.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Tony hugged you while you were washing the dishes.\n\u201cStroke my ego and tell me how much you missed me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou were gone?\u201d You teased, feeling something hard wedged\nagainst his chest and your back. Grabbing a towel, you dried off your hands,\n\u201cLemme see that?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He nodded, your hands went from his chest to his tie. \u201cThe least\nyou can do is buy me dinner,\u201d he winked at you as you unbuttoned his\nshirt.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you whatever dinner you want. Take that shirt off,\u201d\nyou spoke before you could think, seeing a light that was blocked out by thick\nfabric.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAny other time I\u2019d jump if you\u2019d say that, but I\u2019m going to\nneed a little help here.\u201d He nodded to his arm in the sling.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry, sorry.\u201d You helped him out. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat is keeping me alive,\u201d he sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s keeping pieces of\nshrapnel from digging in deeper. What do you think?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHonest?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCompletely.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cScientifically?\nThis is so cool. Don\u2019t you have a giant version of this running the company?\nHow did you miniaturize it?\u201d You paused, catching each and every scar and\nbruise that littered his body, \u201cAs a doctor, I think we need to get you running\nwithout a battery. When are you going to get it done?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNot anytime soon,\u201d he responded, \u201cI have bigger things on my\nmind than me. There are things I need to do. Before I make any of my moves, I\nneed to update my arc reactor. As nice as this hunk of scrap is, its running\nlow. Besides new things are always more fun. Shiner.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d You asked, grabbing his hand in yours.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhen aren\u2019t I okay?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re being tough,\u201d you pressed a kiss to his cheek, \u201cYou\ndon\u2019t have to talk to me, but come on Tony&hellip;You were taken away for a long\ntime, I can\u2019t fathom what happened to you, and now you have a machine to keep\nyou up and running. You also just shut down the main export of your company.\nThat\u2019s a lot.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI&hellip;I- there was so much happening. Okay? The things I saw, I\ndon\u2019t want to be the cause of that anymore. My whole life I\u2019ve been reaping the\nbenefits of death and destruction.\u00a0 That\u2019s not a legacy I want. So, I\u2019m\ngoing to do something about it. You\u2019re going to have to trust me. Do you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course, I do. Still, you need to get this out.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cMaybe,\none day, probably not. I\u2019m not getting your hopes up,\u201d he shook his head, \u201cYou\nknow as well as me that it\u2019s high risk. I have a daughter and I came back with\na mission. I won\u2019t risk it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You studied the small machine. \u201cWhat\u2019s this mission?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to make things right, YN. There are weapons of mine\nout there. I need to do whatever it takes.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You bit your lip. This was a new side of Tony. He was driven,\nyeah, but this was new. There was something different to his core.\n\u201cOkay&hellip;.okay. Whatever you need, Tony. I got your back.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank you, YN.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d Ro ran in from the hallway, crying.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Tony pulled on his shirt. \u201cHey, Rugrat, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThink daddy left again.\u201d She cried into his shirt.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t happen again, okay? Come on you two, we should get\nsome sleep. YN, my sketchbook still in the drawer next to your bed?\u201d<br/></p><p>Everything Tag:<strike>@sophiatomlinson23</strike>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muI5pmOUaX6wvmS3rzWyaFg\" target=\"_blank\">@cannonindeez</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/my7g8KcFN6EbHEEQNgdmeoQ\" target=\"_blank\">@memyselfandmaddox</a></p><p>Marvel Tag: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMV35nTj6jDdZK3AKJ-9Now\" target=\"_blank\">@asguardiansoftheavengers</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLqLl0ejJDMoaJw31Etn_-g\" target=\"_blank\">@letsgetfuckingsuperwholocked</a></p><p>Tony Stark Tag: <strike>@Mrunmayi</strike> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYuWf_sRi7ogVm-JTdgXcbQ\" target=\"_blank\">@bit-bot0711</a><br/></p><p>Strikes didn\u2019t work.</p>",

You were a mess, it was difficult to\nconcentrate at work. The choice had been to take break, your mindset was too\nbad to take care of your patients. Anytime the phone rang, there was the hope\nthat you\u2019d hear Tony\u2019s voice mixed with the dread of Rhodey telling you he\u2019d\nnever come home.\u00a0<br></p>[[MORE]]<p><i>He\u2019s\ncoming home. He might not be home now. Later, who knows? He\u2019s coming home one\nday soon.\u00a0</i><br></p><p>The stress\nof Tony missing and Ro constantly, tearfully asking for him were too much to\nhandle. Ro wasn\u2019t accustomed to not being able to talk or see Tony when she\nwanted. It had been his one of his biggest rules. Tony had never felt he was\nallowed to talk to Howard at anytime unless Howard directly acknowledged him.\nHe didn\u2019t want that with Ro. So anytime Ro said she wanted to speak to her\nfather she did. Now she didn\u2019t understand why whenever she asked you said \u2018no\u2019\nor \u2018he\u2019s doing something, he can\u2019t talk right now.\u2019 She didn\u2019t like these new\nchanges.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMommy,\ndaddy no lo\u2019 us,\u201d she said, after you told her he couldn\u2019t talk for seemingly\nthe millionth time since he went missing.\u00a0<br></p><p>You rubbed\nyour face in frustration, \u201cBaby, your daddy loves you a lot. He just can\u2019t talk\nfor a while.\u201d<br></p><p>She looked\nat you angrily, god that looked so much like Alex. \u201cYes, he can!\u201d Ro yelled and\nthus began another tantrum. \u201cI want my daddy! I want my daddy!\u201d<br></p><p>Honestly,\nyou didn\u2019t blame her. You\u2019d throw a tantrum too if you could.\u00a0<br></p><p>The days\nbled into a month and you tried to move life on as always. Business as usual.\nThough business was a hell of a lot harder without Tony at your side helping\nout. You repressed the pain and through yourself into your work. Maybe, if you\nhelped enough people, whatever force there was would give you back your best\nfriend.\u00a0<br></p><p>Rhodey was\nworking as hard as he could to find Tony. It weighed on you, but it had to be\nworse for Rhodey. He was supposed to protect him. He\u2019d been taking care of Tony\nsince he was that young naive kid people thought they could take advantage of\nin parties at MIT. Resources to look for Tony were restricted. Everyone kept\nsaying that Rhodey\u2019s searches were a lost cause, but he\u2019d gain enough respect\nfor them to humor him. Hoping as the second month rolled past he\u2019d give\nup.\u00a0<br></p><p>As if\nJames Rhodes would ever give up on Tony Stark.\u00a0<br></p><p>Company\nwise, the man you had seen at the Stark\u2019s funeral was doing press. He seemed to\nbe taking over in Tony\u2019s absence. Something about him seemed off, but you knew\nbetter than to judge by public appearances. Besides, if he was to take over\nwhen Tony wasn\u2019t around, that meant Tony trusted him.\u00a0<br></p><p>Some\nmorning news show was playing as background noise.<br></p><p>\u201cSo,\nStane, it\u2019s been close to three months. How is the company doing without Stark\nat the head?\u201d the host asked.<br></p><p>\u201cThe company\nkeeps going the way it always does,\u201d he answered, \u201cI only hope to run it the\nway Tony would want.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLong\nvacations, clubs, alcohol, and girls,\u201d the host joked.\u00a0<br></p><p>Obadiah\nlaughed, \u201cExactly.\u201d<br></p><p>Was Tony\nreally just a cheap joke to them when he\u2019d been missing so long now? You turned\noff the TV. Tony Stark was more than people made him out to be and you didn\u2019t\nneed to hear what they thought. He was more than the party scene. He was\nloving, caring, hardworking, held his emotions to his chest, and used\nsunglasses as a way to hide himself. Someone that was a genius by every\nmeasure, striving to push the world into a better future. A man that would\nraise someone else\u2019s child as his own, oddly enough something he had jokingly\npromised the day you met, and try with all his might to not repeat the sins of\nhis father. But all they saw was the alcoholic partier. A flat 2D image. Maybe\none day he\u2019d get to prove them all wrong.\u00a0<br></p><p>The phone\nrang.<br></p><p>-</p><p>An explosion,\nthat\u2019s all it took to change it all.\u00a0<br></p><p>A second\nago he was cracking cheap jokes and posing for a picture, the next there\u2019s\nscreaming, gunfire, and death. That soldier wasn\u2019t much more than a\nkid\u2026\u00a0<br></p><p>It takes a\nmoment to recover from the shock and fear. His brain finally kicking into\nflight mode. They\u2019re aiming at the Humvee, taking out all of the soldiers is\ntheir mission, he needs to get away from here. He runs out, there\u2019s no where to\ngo in the rainfall of bullets and explosives, but he manages to find a rock to\ntake cover behind.\u00a0<br></p><p>Pulling\nout his phone, he frantically starts to shoot out a text. A whistle blows\nthrough the air and something crash lands not to far from where he is. He\nglances over to see death with his name on it.\u00a0<br></p><p><i>Fuck, fuck,\nfuck.\u00a0</i><br></p><p>He doesn\u2019t\nhave time to get away. He didn\u2019t design it to give anyone time to get away. The\nshock and adrenaline blocking the pain for now. Almost in disbelief he pulls\nopen his button down, blood flowing from wounds where the shrapnel pierced through\nhis vest. There\u2019s not much time to think of anything else before he passes out.\nBriefly, Tony is conscious enough to know he\u2019s being transported. He doesn\u2019t\nhave enough brain power to judge it as a good or bad thing, the pain being\ncenter focus. Tony loses consciousness again.<i>\u00a0<br></i></p><p>Later a\nbag is pulled off of his head and he sluggishly put everything together. The\nbright lights, a camera, and a man talking as if making negotiations, all\nhighlighted with him being tied up. Something at the back of his head bit at\nhim, saying he should have spent his time with Ro instead of some reporter he\ncouldn\u2019t remember the name of. His chest was killing him. After the group makes\nwhatever message they wanted to they drag him somewhere else, his consciousness\ncoming in and out in waves.\u00a0<br></p><p>That\u2019s\nwhen the nightmare really starts. Someone is digging into his chest, causing\nthe worst pain he\u2019s ever felt. He can\u2019t hold in his screams. Cloth is shoved\ninto his mouth and who knows how many people are holding him down when he\nattempts to thrash away. There\u2019s not even the freedom of being unconscious\nuntil the torture is done. He didn\u2019t even let go on his own, someone dragged\nhim down with chloroform.\u00a0<br></p><p>He finally\ncame around a final time. There was a man, Tony didn\u2019t know if he was a friend\nor foe. When he tries to move, he\u2019s stopped abruptly by something\u2026connected\nto him? Following the chords frantically, he rips off his bandages. The flesh\nraw and haggard around a machine. Tony studies the thing in his chest. It\nweighs on him, each breath bringing a new bout of pain. It wasn\u2019t any use being\na baby about pain now, he had things to figure out. Not like anyone here would\ngive him any pain medication anytime soon. He\u2019d be lucky if it didn\u2019t get\ninfected somehow.\u00a0<br></p><p>The first\nthing that spills from his mouth is an accusatory, \u201cWhat the hell did you do to\nme?\u201d<br></p><p>Quickly\nconnecting the dots that the man was also a prisoner. The man had taken some of\nThe shrapnel out, the pieces still inside of his chest were working to kill\nhim. All that was keeping him alive was a car battery and electromagnet.\u00a0<br></p><p>Tony took\nin his surroundings. Dimly lit, cold, with a dank smell topping everything off.\nA camera was in place, watching him and the man. Speaking of which this man\nmust have been dying for company. He was rambling about having met himself\nbefore.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nremember\u2026\u201d he answered gruffly, partially listening as his mind raced for\nsome kind of solution.\u00a0<br></p><p>His roommate\nstarted recounting one of his drunken speeches. Something that happened more\nthan not. But he was a functional alcoholic so what did it matter if he could\nstill get the job done. He paid little mind to the conversation. Banging on the\ndoor caused the man to stand hurriedly commanding him to be quiet and mimic\nhim.\u00a0<br></p><p>A group\nwalks in, as dim as it was Tony could recognize his work anywhere. \u201cThose are\nmy guns. How did they get my guns?\u201d The words leave his mouth, he doesn\u2019t\nrealize it but they do.\u00a0<br></p><p>His\npartner reprimands him, as one of their new guest starts talking. There\u2019s not\nmuch for him to catch beside his own name. When signaled his roommate starts to\ntranslate.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe says, \u2018Welcome Tony Stark, the most famous mass murderer in\nthe history of America\u2026.he\u2019s honored\u2026he wants you to build a missile\u2026the\nJericho middle the one you demonstrated,\u201d his roommate is handed a photo and he\nshowed it to Tony, \u201cThis one.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>In a span of less than two days he had been called a Merchant of\nDeath and the most famous mass murderer. Something in him was changing, a day\nago he probably would have agreed, topping it off with a lame joke. Now? Now he\nsaw things first hand. People he wanted to fight against seemingly respected\nhim. Looking at the man defiantly, Tony responded, \u201cI refuse.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Their choice had been made. Torture into compliance. They ducked\nhis head in the water for as long as they wanted, letting him back up for the\nsmallest of gasp. He knew they wouldn\u2019t kill him. They needed him to make the\nweapon. Once the group finally got tired, they put a sack over his head and\nwalked him out of the cave. He was already counting his steps and committing\nthe directions to memory.\u00a0<br></p><p>Blinded by\nthe sun, his eyes finally came back to focus. All around his weapons were\nscattered and thrown about. His name glaring at him from all angles. Was he\ndirectly responsible? No. But he made this all, without him they\u2019d have\nnothing. Without him those soldiers would be alive.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>He shook his captors hand, knowing well that making the Jericho\nwould get him killed. That was okay, he could work on pretenses. They didn\u2019t\nknow what went into making the weapon. Just that alone would give him some\nleeway, but they\u2019d catch on quickly. All he needed to do was be quicker. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re looking for you, Stark. But they\u2019d never\nfind you here in these mountains. Look, out there, what you saw? That is your\nlegacy. Your weapons in the hands of those murderers! Is that how you want to\ngo out? Is this the last act of defiance of the great Tony Stark? Or are you\ngoing to do something about it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\"Why should I do anything? Either way, they\u2019re gonna kill\nyou and me, and if not, then I\u2019ll likely be dead by the end of the week\"\u00a0</p><p>\"Well then, this will be a very important week for you,\nwon\u2019t it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>It was the push he needed.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>First things first, to stop lugging around that car battery. The\nupgrade to an arc reactor would be the golden ticket. He did the calculations,\nalready working on how to minimize the reactor to something functional that can\nwork as fuel. Next would be a suit, something that he could use to clear the\npath.\u00a0<br></p><p>Tony\nworked by himself, much to his roommate\u2019s annoyance. So, Tony had him scavenge\nfor the palladium. After gathering the 1.6 grams, they melted it now and poured\nit into the mold Tony had constructed. Everything was hanging on this, it was a\nlimited resource.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCareful. Careful, we only get one shot at this,\u201d Tony\nwarned.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cRelax. I have steady hands. Why do you think you\u2019re still\nalive?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Maybe knowing the name of his new lab partner would be good.\n\u201cWhat do I call you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy name is Yinsen,\u201d he answered.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYinsen, nice to meet you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony ignored the annoyed glance he was given. Sure they met before,\nbut did it really count if he was drunk off his ass? Yinsen turned into his\nright hand, it would have been impossible to form some kind of bond. They were\nall the other had.\u00a0</p><p>Once the arc reactor was completed, he showed Yinsen the suit he\nhad made a blueprint. Fifteen minutes, that\u2019s all they got for fuel. At least\nhe didn\u2019t have to worry about the shrapnel in his chest being kept at bay with\na dying battery.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGot a family?\u201d Tony asked during a game of backgammon.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes and I will see them when I leave here,\u201d Yinsen answered,\nalways so sure, \u201cAnd you Stark?\u201d<br></p><p>Tony\nstayed quiet, trying to decide what would be the best answer. Honestly, he\ndidn\u2019t try to think of anything except the escape. If he did he got distracted,\nsad, something that couldn\u2019t sidetrack him right now. There was also the fact\nthat there could always be someone listening in. He couldn\u2019t risk it. \u201c\u2026No.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re a man that has everything and nothing.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019d tell Yinsen about his little girl when they were\nfreed.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The days bled and blended into one another. No clue how long he\nhad been captive. Did he really want to know? Tony worked restlessly. He needed\nout. He needed to go home. All he wanted was to see his daughter and see that\nsmile of hers that looked so much like yours. That\u2019s why he worked tirelessly\nto build this suit. It was close to finished but not quite.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>His and Yinsen\u2019s captors barged in. The leader saying whatever\nabout Genghis Khan and soon it would be his turn to rule. How Stark weapons are\nthe way to secure that in this land. Only, Stark wasn\u2019t building his weapon,\nwas he? Yinsen was pushed on to his knees, a burning piece of coal was being\npushed closer and closer to his face, as he argued with the leader. Tony\nmanaged to get them to back off yelling that he needed him as an\nassistant.\u00a0<br></p><p>When they\nleave he starts to work harder. There\u2019s no more time. Before he knew it Yinsen\nwas helping it suit up, their homemade bomb ready to go off the second someone\nopens the door. The clock is ticking, everything needs to work. Nothing can go\nwrong or malfunction right now. As he\u2019s readying up, Yinsen makes him recite\nthe directions out of the cave. There are guards yelling at them from the door.\nYinsen frantically moves faster. The bomb goes if and they both realize now\nwhatever time they had is up.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Tony talks him through on the computer. Then Yinsen goes to do\nthe finishing touches of the suit. Tony tried to remain calm, noticing how\npanicked Yinsen had become.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGet to your cover. Make sure the check points are clear before\nyou follow me out, okay?\u201d Tony spoke, while Yinsen checked the progress\nbar.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe need more time,\u201d Yensin realized, the bar creeping up too\nslowly, he turned to look at Tony, \u201cHey, I\u2019m going to buy you some time.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cStick to the plan! Stick to the plan!\u201d Tony pleads as dread\nfills him, he\u2019s restricted into the suit, he can\u2019t do anything until the system\nis loaded. Gunshots filled the air, \u201cYinsen!\u201d He glared at the laptop, willing\nfor it to go faster.\u00a0<br></p><p>The power\ncut off as the suit, finished. Some of the men peered into the cave. Tony\nthrough himself into the mission. He needed to get out of here and find Yinsen.\nHis anger boiled over with each and everyone of his captors he met. They kept\nhim from his daughter, downed him, beat him, and made his life a living hell.\nNot to mention everything they had done to Yinsen. Now it was his turn to hurt\nthem.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>He finally made it toward the front of the cave. \u201cYinsen!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWatch out!\u201d Yinsen responded in a weak voice.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Tony narrowly missed a missile, shooting off one of his own\nquickly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cStark..\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony pushed off the package that had the man pinned down. Yinsen\nlooked weak but they couldn\u2019t stay here, \u201cC\u2019mon we gotta go. Move with me. Come\non we have a plan, we\u2019re gonna stick to it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis was always the plan, Stark,\u201d he spoke slowly, breathless.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon you\u2019re gonna go see your family, get up,\u201d he urged,\nhoping that the idea of seeing his family again would give Yinsen the spur of\nenergy that he needed.<br></p><p>\u201cMy family\nis dead. I\u2019m going to see them now, Stark. It\u2019s okay\u2026it\u2019s oka\u2026\u201d he took a\nhaggard breath, \u201cI want this\u2026.I want this.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what to do, except accept Yensin\u2019s choice. \u201cThank\nyou for saving me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDont waste it\u2026Don\u2019t waste your life,\u201d he took one last\nlabored breath before sagging into himself.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t waste his time. He could mourn later. Right now he\nhad to destroy all of his weapons and get as far as he could. Once he made his\nway out of the cave, he met hell fire of bullets. When they ran out it was his\nturn. Everyone in his way, everything with his name on it was destroyed in\nfire. Someone obviously hit something good, because his suit started\nmalfunctioning. Taking the chance, he set fire to the rest of the weapons. With\na click or a button, he went flying off. Something there caused a chain\nreaction of explosions, just barely missing him.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Suddenly, hundreds of feet in the air, the boosters are spent.\nAll that Tony can see is the ground coming at him quickly. There\u2019s no way he\ncould make it this far for this to be the end.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The crash land caused the suit to dismantle and partially bury\nhim in the sand.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNot bad\u2026\u201d he spoke, letting his head fall back.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>An explosion in the distance brought him out of his dazed state.\nThere was no time for rest. He pulled himself out of the wreck and sand before\npicking a direction hoping it would bring something, anything good.\u00a0<br></p><p>It had\nbeen so long, Tony had managed a weak jog every so often. Each breath caused a\nsurge of pain to his chest, his stomach was begging for anything, and his mouth\nfelt drier than the desert around him. The thoughts keeping him going were his\nfamily, Yinsen, and every change he was going to make the second he\ncould.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>His whole life he avoided responsibility. He made the toys and\ndidn\u2019t give a hell what anyone did with them the second they were out of his\nsight. Never had he meant for this to happen. All he had wanted was to help\nprotect people on the front line. Now, he experienced, first hand, what he\ncaused. He didn\u2019t like it. There were big changes to make.\u00a0</p><p>The sound of black hawks pulled him out of his thoughts.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d He screamed, his voice rough and gritty. He fell to his\nknees, throwing up a peace sign.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Rhodey ran over to him, \u201cHow was the funvee?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Tony couldn\u2019t help much more than a laugh.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNext time you ride with me, okay?\u201d Rhodey pulled him into a\nhug.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>To hell with dad\u2019s, \u2018Stark men are made of iron.\u2019 He leaned into\nRhodey\u2019s hug, feeling safer than he ever had in his life. Tony could finally\nthink about home and know he\u2019d get there.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Hours later, Rhodey left Tony\u2019s room for a second. Tony was\nsleeping he\u2019d be okay for now. He pulled out his phone.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>He didn\u2019t go through formalities. \u201cYN, he\u2019s coming home.\u201d<br></p><p>-</p><p>Tony was\nsafe. He was finally coming home. You could finally breathe. The stress had\nrolled off of you almost instantly the second Rhodey said it. He ended the call\nwhen he said some doctors wanted to do a check up on Tony.\u00a0</p><p>The following afternoon you were making a snack for Ro while she\nplayed with some of her toys in the kitchen. Since Tony\u2019s kidnapping, Ro had\ngrown more clingy. Not that she wasn\u2019t a cuddly kid, but sometimes she\u2019d cry as\nif you weren\u2019t going to come back when you left her with a her babysitter.\nLeaving her on those days hurt. One day, you had caught her just staring at a\npicture of Tony, sadly holding the frame. The whole situation was really\naffecting her in a way you didn\u2019t know understand. All you could do was go\nthrough some picture books with her and stay with her at all times unless it\nwas strictly necessary for you to go.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Some random news channel was playing as background noise. Ro\ndidn\u2019t know that Tony was going to come by later, a small surprise for her.\nEverything felt like it was back to normal. God, you were just happy Tony was\nsafe.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI never got to say goodbye to dad. I never got to say goodbye\nto my father,\u201d Tony\u2019s voice came from the speakers.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Ro looked at you, before running into the living room. \u201cDaddy!\nDaddy! Daddy!\u201d She stopped close to the TV, watching closely.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>This was a well worked cycle. Surprisingly the news channels\nwould recycle an old interview now and then for the Tony Stark is still missing\nfiller. Ro would run over expecting her father only to be met by a couple of\npixels. Which would be followed by a usual conversation.\u00a0<br></p><p>You walked\nover and picked her up, \u201cAre you okay, sweetheart?\u201d\u00a0\u201cMaybe we go there and see daddy?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMaybe soon.\u201d At least this time it was something you knew for\ncertain and not something you said hopefully.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she walked back to her toys, the bear she refused to let\ngo of dragging on the floor beside her.\u00a0</p><p>Your heart clenched, but he\u2019d be here for her soon enough. She\nwouldn\u2019t be given anymore laters. Turning your attention back to the TV, more\nfocused on his appearance rather than what he was saying. He looked as okay as\nyou could expect from someone that had been captive for three months. You\ncaught Tony saying something about shutting down the weapons manufacturing\ndivision and the outburst of the press. Stane was pushing him of the stage as\nTony spoke his piece.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>That was a surprising choice, but who were you to question\neverything he had experienced and seen. Having Tony back was your primary\nconcern. Going back to the kitchen, you finished chopping up Ro\u2019s fruit.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The two of you had a quiet day. She played on her set for a\nbetter part of it and asked you to read her a couple of books outside in the\ngrass. Around sunset, you decided it would be good to get Ro bathed and settled\ndown for the night.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>While you were in the bathroom with Ro, you heard the front door\nopen and close. It had to be Tony, he was the only person that had a key to\nyour home. Quickly, you rinsed her off and took her out of the bath.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMommy,\np\u2019eas play more in the bath,\u201d she pouted at you.\u00a0</p><p>You shook your head, \u201cSorry, Ro Bear, not today.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She started to cry as you helped her into a Buzz\nLightyear pajama set.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, c\u2019mon we don\u2019t need tears today. Tomorrow, I promise\nyou can play as long as you want in the water. Deal?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She nodded wiping her face, her lip still trembling,\u00a0\u201cAnd maybe\nbubbles?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe biggest bubbles.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Tony Bear?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201c\u2018Ony Bear is\u2026.\u2019Ony Bear in.. I take you,\u201d She grab your hand\nand led you over towards the living room. Ro stopped short in the hallway when\nshe saw him. \u201cDaddy? Daddy!\u201d Letting go of your hand, she ran to Tony, who was\ncrouched down ready to catch her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI missed you, Rugrat,\u201d he hugged her close, pressing a kiss to\nher head. Finally, he felt like he was home.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c\u2018Issed you too. Lots a lot,\u201d she pressed kisses to his cheek,\n\u201cStay with me forever, daddy. No more work ever ever.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\nall I want is to stay with you forever,\u201d He picked up Ro, not willing to let\nher go so soon. \u201cHey, you. What happened to \u2018we don\u2019t need tears today\u2019? You\u2019re\ngetting soft on me,\u201d Tony joked, walking over to pull you into a hug, \u201cRo, I\nthink your mommy loves me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you mostest.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t insult me like that,\u201d you joked pressing a kiss to his\ncheek, \u201cYou know I love you, Tones.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love the both of you,\u201d he pulled away, from you, \u201cRo, I have\nthis cup of ice cream with rainbow sprinkles. I don\u2019t think I can eat it\nmyself, help me out?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Tony walked over to the kitchen to grab the ice cream, Ro\u2019s arms\naround his neck keeping him in a hug. You let the two of them have their time\ntogether, soon enough you\u2019d get to talk to Tony.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cKnow my abc\u2019s now,\u201d Ro said, opening her mouth for another spoonful.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo way. Do it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA, b, c, d, m, n, o, w, now I know my abc\u2019s,\u201d she sang.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI like this remix. You really just took the meat of that song\nand threw out all of the annoying bits. What do you say your mommy and I teach\nyou the old people version sometime?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWith \u2018Ony Bear.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou got\nit.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The two of them had a conversation over ice cream. Happily\nignoring everything in the world together. Ro stayed on Tony\u2019s lap the entire\ntime, neither one of them wanted to be apart from each other. It was cute, sad\nwhen you thought of why, but they needed to be close.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know Ro, you and your mommy are two of the most beautiful\npeople I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he said, patting her back while she laid against him.\u00a0</p><p>She yawned resting her head against his shoulder, \u201cDaddy\u2019s\npretty too. Mommy says so.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYour mommy always thought I was pretty, but I think it\u2019s time\nfor you to get some sleep, Ro.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan I sleep with you daddy?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He stood and took her to your room. Ro was curled up against him\nas soon as he laid down beside her. Quietly he sang her, Here Comes the Sun,\nslowly lulling her to sleep. Tony laid there with her for a while,\ncontemplating. A small part of him, thought he wouldn\u2019t have made it back home.\nNow, he was going to throw that away and start a mission. He always promised Ro\nhe\u2019d be the best he could to even be worthy of being her father, maybe this was\nthe way to go.\u00a0<br></p><p>He pressed\na kiss to her head before he slid out from under Ro. As comfortable as he was\nhe wanted to talk to you.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Tony hugged you while you were washing the dishes.\n\u201cStroke my ego and tell me how much you missed me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou were gone?\u201d You teased, feeling something hard wedged\nagainst his chest and your back. Grabbing a towel, you dried off your hands,\n\u201cLemme see that?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He nodded, your hands went from his chest to his tie. \u201cThe least\nyou can do is buy me dinner,\u201d he winked at you as you unbuttoned his\nshirt.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you whatever dinner you want. Take that shirt off,\u201d\nyou spoke before you could think, seeing a light that was blocked out by thick\nfabric.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAny other time I\u2019d jump if you\u2019d say that, but I\u2019m going to\nneed a little help here.\u201d He nodded to his arm in the sling.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry, sorry.\u201d You helped him out. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat is keeping me alive,\u201d he sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s keeping pieces of\nshrapnel from digging in deeper. What do you think?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHonest?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCompletely.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cScientifically?\nThis is so cool. Don\u2019t you have a giant version of this running the company?\nHow did you miniaturize it?\u201d You paused, catching each and every scar and\nbruise that littered his body, \u201cAs a doctor, I think we need to get you running\nwithout a battery. When are you going to get it done?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNot anytime soon,\u201d he responded, \u201cI have bigger things on my\nmind than me. There are things I need to do. Before I make any of my moves, I\nneed to update my arc reactor. As nice as this hunk of scrap is, its running\nlow. Besides new things are always more fun. Shiner.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d You asked, grabbing his hand in yours.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhen aren\u2019t I okay?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re being tough,\u201d you pressed a kiss to his cheek, \u201cYou\ndon\u2019t have to talk to me, but come on Tony\u2026You were taken away for a long\ntime, I can\u2019t fathom what happened to you, and now you have a machine to keep\nyou up and running. You also just shut down the main export of your company.\nThat\u2019s a lot.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2026I- there was so much happening. Okay? The things I saw, I\ndon\u2019t want to be the cause of that anymore. My whole life I\u2019ve been reaping the\nbenefits of death and destruction.\u00a0 That\u2019s not a legacy I want. So, I\u2019m\ngoing to do something about it. You\u2019re going to have to trust me. Do you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course, I do. Still, you need to get this out.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMaybe,\none day, probably not. I\u2019m not getting your hopes up,\u201d he shook his head, \u201cYou\nknow as well as me that it\u2019s high risk. I have a daughter and I came back with\na mission. I won\u2019t risk it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You studied the small machine. \u201cWhat\u2019s this mission?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to make things right, YN. There are weapons of mine\nout there. I need to do whatever it takes.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You bit your lip. This was a new side of Tony. He was driven,\nyeah, but this was new. There was something different to his core.\n\u201cOkay\u2026.okay. Whatever you need, Tony. I got your back.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank you, YN.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d Ro ran in from the hallway, crying.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Tony pulled on his shirt. \u201cHey, Rugrat, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThink daddy left again.\u201d She cried into his shirt.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t happen again, okay? Come on you two, we should get\nsome sleep. YN, my sketchbook still in the drawer next to your bed?\u201d<br></p><p>Everything Tag:<strike>@sophiatomlinson23</strike>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muI5pmOUaX6wvmS3rzWyaFg\" target=\"_blank\">@cannonindeez</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/my7g8KcFN6EbHEEQNgdmeoQ\" target=\"_blank\">@memyselfandmaddox</a></p><p>Marvel Tag: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMV35nTj6jDdZK3AKJ-9Now\" target=\"_blank\">@asguardiansoftheavengers</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLqLl0ejJDMoaJw31Etn_-g\" target=\"_blank\">@letsgetfuckingsuperwholocked</a></p><p>Tony Stark Tag: <strike>@Mrunmayi</strike> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYuWf_sRi7ogVm-JTdgXcbQ\" target=\"_blank\">@bit-bot0711</a><br></p><p>Strikes didn\u2019t work.</p>",

You were a mess, it was difficult to\nconcentrate at work. The choice had been to take break, your mindset was too\nbad to take care of your patients. Anytime the phone rang, there was the hope\nthat you\u2019d hear Tony\u2019s voice mixed with the dread of Rhodey telling you he\u2019d\nnever come home.\u00a0<br></p>[[MORE]]<p><i>He\u2019s\ncoming home. He might not be home now. Later, who knows? He\u2019s coming home one\nday soon.\u00a0</i><br></p><p>The stress\nof Tony missing and Ro constantly, tearfully asking for him were too much to\nhandle. Ro wasn\u2019t accustomed to not being able to talk or see Tony when she\nwanted. It had been his one of his biggest rules. Tony had never felt he was\nallowed to talk to Howard at anytime unless Howard directly acknowledged him.\nHe didn\u2019t want that with Ro. So anytime Ro said she wanted to speak to her\nfather she did. Now she didn\u2019t understand why whenever she asked you said \u2018no\u2019\nor \u2018he\u2019s doing something, he can\u2019t talk right now.\u2019 She didn\u2019t like these new\nchanges.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMommy,\ndaddy no lo\u2019 us,\u201d she said, after you told her he couldn\u2019t talk for seemingly\nthe millionth time since he went missing.\u00a0<br></p><p>You rubbed\nyour face in frustration, \u201cBaby, your daddy loves you a lot. He just can\u2019t talk\nfor a while.\u201d<br></p><p>She looked\nat you angrily, god that looked so much like Alex. \u201cYes, he can!\u201d Ro yelled and\nthus began another tantrum. \u201cI want my daddy! I want my daddy!\u201d<br></p><p>Honestly,\nyou didn\u2019t blame her. You\u2019d throw a tantrum too if you could.\u00a0<br></p><p>The days\nbled into a month and you tried to move life on as always. Business as usual.\nThough business was a hell of a lot harder without Tony at your side helping\nout. You repressed the pain and through yourself into your work. Maybe, if you\nhelped enough people, whatever force there was would give you back your best\nfriend.\u00a0<br></p><p>Rhodey was\nworking as hard as he could to find Tony. It weighed on you, but it had to be\nworse for Rhodey. He was supposed to protect him. He\u2019d been taking care of Tony\nsince he was that young naive kid people thought they could take advantage of\nin parties at MIT. Resources to look for Tony were restricted. Everyone kept\nsaying that Rhodey\u2019s searches were a lost cause, but he\u2019d gain enough respect\nfor them to humor him. Hoping as the second month rolled past he\u2019d give\nup.\u00a0<br></p><p>As if\nJames Rhodes would ever give up on Tony Stark.\u00a0<br></p><p>Company\nwise, the man you had seen at the Stark\u2019s funeral was doing press. He seemed to\nbe taking over in Tony\u2019s absence. Something about him seemed off, but you knew\nbetter than to judge by public appearances. Besides, if he was to take over\nwhen Tony wasn\u2019t around, that meant Tony trusted him.\u00a0<br></p><p>Some\nmorning news show was playing as background noise.<br></p><p>\u201cSo,\nStane, it\u2019s been close to three months. How is the company doing without Stark\nat the head?\u201d the host asked.<br></p><p>\u201cThe company\nkeeps going the way it always does,\u201d he answered, \u201cI only hope to run it the\nway Tony would want.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLong\nvacations, clubs, alcohol, and girls,\u201d the host joked.\u00a0<br></p><p>Obadiah\nlaughed, \u201cExactly.\u201d<br></p><p>Was Tony\nreally just a cheap joke to them when he\u2019d been missing so long now? You turned\noff the TV. Tony Stark was more than people made him out to be and you didn\u2019t\nneed to hear what they thought. He was more than the party scene. He was\nloving, caring, hardworking, held his emotions to his chest, and used\nsunglasses as a way to hide himself. Someone that was a genius by every\nmeasure, striving to push the world into a better future. A man that would\nraise someone else\u2019s child as his own, oddly enough something he had jokingly\npromised the day you met, and try with all his might to not repeat the sins of\nhis father. But all they saw was the alcoholic partier. A flat 2D image. Maybe\none day he\u2019d get to prove them all wrong.\u00a0<br></p><p>The phone\nrang.<br></p><p>-</p><p>An explosion,\nthat\u2019s all it took to change it all.\u00a0<br></p><p>A second\nago he was cracking cheap jokes and posing for a picture, the next there\u2019s\nscreaming, gunfire, and death. That soldier wasn\u2019t much more than a\nkid\u2026\u00a0<br></p><p>It takes a\nmoment to recover from the shock and fear. His brain finally kicking into\nflight mode. They\u2019re aiming at the Humvee, taking out all of the soldiers is\ntheir mission, he needs to get away from here. He runs out, there\u2019s no where to\ngo in the rainfall of bullets and explosives, but he manages to find a rock to\ntake cover behind.\u00a0<br></p><p>Pulling\nout his phone, he frantically starts to shoot out a text. A whistle blows\nthrough the air and something crash lands not to far from where he is. He\nglances over to see death with his name on it.\u00a0<br></p><p><i>Fuck, fuck,\nfuck.\u00a0</i><br></p><p>He doesn\u2019t\nhave time to get away. He didn\u2019t design it to give anyone time to get away. The\nshock and adrenaline blocking the pain for now. Almost in disbelief he pulls\nopen his button down, blood flowing from wounds where the shrapnel pierced through\nhis vest. There\u2019s not much time to think of anything else before he passes out.\nBriefly, Tony is conscious enough to know he\u2019s being transported. He doesn\u2019t\nhave enough brain power to judge it as a good or bad thing, the pain being\ncenter focus. Tony loses consciousness again.<i>\u00a0<br></i></p><p>Later a\nbag is pulled off of his head and he sluggishly put everything together. The\nbright lights, a camera, and a man talking as if making negotiations, all\nhighlighted with him being tied up. Something at the back of his head bit at\nhim, saying he should have spent his time with Ro instead of some reporter he\ncouldn\u2019t remember the name of. His chest was killing him. After the group makes\nwhatever message they wanted to they drag him somewhere else, his consciousness\ncoming in and out in waves.\u00a0<br></p><p>That\u2019s\nwhen the nightmare really starts. Someone is digging into his chest, causing\nthe worst pain he\u2019s ever felt. He can\u2019t hold in his screams. Cloth is shoved\ninto his mouth and who knows how many people are holding him down when he\nattempts to thrash away. There\u2019s not even the freedom of being unconscious\nuntil the torture is done. He didn\u2019t even let go on his own, someone dragged\nhim down with chloroform.\u00a0<br></p><p>He finally\ncame around a final time. There was a man, Tony didn\u2019t know if he was a friend\nor foe. When he tries to move, he\u2019s stopped abruptly by something\u2026connected\nto him? Following the chords frantically, he rips off his bandages. The flesh\nraw and haggard around a machine. Tony studies the thing in his chest. It\nweighs on him, each breath bringing a new bout of pain. It wasn\u2019t any use being\na baby about pain now, he had things to figure out. Not like anyone here would\ngive him any pain medication anytime soon. He\u2019d be lucky if it didn\u2019t get\ninfected somehow.\u00a0<br></p><p>The first\nthing that spills from his mouth is an accusatory, \u201cWhat the hell did you do to\nme?\u201d<br></p><p>Quickly\nconnecting the dots that the man was also a prisoner. The man had taken some of\nThe shrapnel out, the pieces still inside of his chest were working to kill\nhim. All that was keeping him alive was a car battery and electromagnet.\u00a0<br></p><p>Tony took\nin his surroundings. Dimly lit, cold, with a dank smell topping everything off.\nA camera was in place, watching him and the man. Speaking of which this man\nmust have been dying for company. He was rambling about having met himself\nbefore.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nremember\u2026\u201d he answered gruffly, partially listening as his mind raced for\nsome kind of solution.\u00a0<br></p><p>His roommate\nstarted recounting one of his drunken speeches. Something that happened more\nthan not. But he was a functional alcoholic so what did it matter if he could\nstill get the job done. He paid little mind to the conversation. Banging on the\ndoor caused the man to stand hurriedly commanding him to be quiet and mimic\nhim.\u00a0<br></p><p>A group\nwalks in, as dim as it was Tony could recognize his work anywhere. \u201cThose are\nmy guns. How did they get my guns?\u201d The words leave his mouth, he doesn\u2019t\nrealize it but they do.\u00a0<br></p><p>His\npartner reprimands him, as one of their new guest starts talking. There\u2019s not\nmuch for him to catch beside his own name. When signaled his roommate starts to\ntranslate.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe says, \u2018Welcome Tony Stark, the most famous mass murderer in\nthe history of America\u2026.he\u2019s honored\u2026he wants you to build a missile\u2026the\nJericho middle the one you demonstrated,\u201d his roommate is handed a photo and he\nshowed it to Tony, \u201cThis one.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>In a span of less than two days he had been called a Merchant of\nDeath and the most famous mass murderer. Something in him was changing, a day\nago he probably would have agreed, topping it off with a lame joke. Now? Now he\nsaw things first hand. People he wanted to fight against seemingly respected\nhim. Looking at the man defiantly, Tony responded, \u201cI refuse.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Their choice had been made. Torture into compliance. They ducked\nhis head in the water for as long as they wanted, letting him back up for the\nsmallest of gasp. He knew they wouldn\u2019t kill him. They needed him to make the\nweapon. Once the group finally got tired, they put a sack over his head and\nwalked him out of the cave. He was already counting his steps and committing\nthe directions to memory.\u00a0<br></p><p>Blinded by\nthe sun, his eyes finally came back to focus. All around his weapons were\nscattered and thrown about. His name glaring at him from all angles. Was he\ndirectly responsible? No. But he made this all, without him they\u2019d have\nnothing. Without him those soldiers would be alive.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>He shook his captors hand, knowing well that making the Jericho\nwould get him killed. That was okay, he could work on pretenses. They didn\u2019t\nknow what went into making the weapon. Just that alone would give him some\nleeway, but they\u2019d catch on quickly. All he needed to do was be quicker. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re looking for you, Stark. But they\u2019d never\nfind you here in these mountains. Look, out there, what you saw? That is your\nlegacy. Your weapons in the hands of those murderers! Is that how you want to\ngo out? Is this the last act of defiance of the great Tony Stark? Or are you\ngoing to do something about it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\"Why should I do anything? Either way, they\u2019re gonna kill\nyou and me, and if not, then I\u2019ll likely be dead by the end of the week\"\u00a0</p><p>\"Well then, this will be a very important week for you,\nwon\u2019t it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>It was the push he needed.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>First things first, to stop lugging around that car battery. The\nupgrade to an arc reactor would be the golden ticket. He did the calculations,\nalready working on how to minimize the reactor to something functional that can\nwork as fuel. Next would be a suit, something that he could use to clear the\npath.\u00a0<br></p><p>Tony\nworked by himself, much to his roommate\u2019s annoyance. So, Tony had him scavenge\nfor the palladium. After gathering the 1.6 grams, they melted it now and poured\nit into the mold Tony had constructed. Everything was hanging on this, it was a\nlimited resource.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCareful. Careful, we only get one shot at this,\u201d Tony\nwarned.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cRelax. I have steady hands. Why do you think you\u2019re still\nalive?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Maybe knowing the name of his new lab partner would be good.\n\u201cWhat do I call you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy name is Yinsen,\u201d he answered.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYinsen, nice to meet you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony ignored the annoyed glance he was given. Sure they met before,\nbut did it really count if he was drunk off his ass? Yinsen turned into his\nright hand, it would have been impossible to form some kind of bond. They were\nall the other had.\u00a0</p><p>Once the arc reactor was completed, he showed Yinsen the suit he\nhad made a blueprint. Fifteen minutes, that\u2019s all they got for fuel. At least\nhe didn\u2019t have to worry about the shrapnel in his chest being kept at bay with\na dying battery.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGot a family?\u201d Tony asked during a game of backgammon.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes and I will see them when I leave here,\u201d Yinsen answered,\nalways so sure, \u201cAnd you Stark?\u201d<br></p><p>Tony\nstayed quiet, trying to decide what would be the best answer. Honestly, he\ndidn\u2019t try to think of anything except the escape. If he did he got distracted,\nsad, something that couldn\u2019t sidetrack him right now. There was also the fact\nthat there could always be someone listening in. He couldn\u2019t risk it. \u201c\u2026No.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re a man that has everything and nothing.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019d tell Yinsen about his little girl when they were\nfreed.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The days bled and blended into one another. No clue how long he\nhad been captive. Did he really want to know? Tony worked restlessly. He needed\nout. He needed to go home. All he wanted was to see his daughter and see that\nsmile of hers that looked so much like yours. That\u2019s why he worked tirelessly\nto build this suit. It was close to finished but not quite.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>His and Yinsen\u2019s captors barged in. The leader saying whatever\nabout Genghis Khan and soon it would be his turn to rule. How Stark weapons are\nthe way to secure that in this land. Only, Stark wasn\u2019t building his weapon,\nwas he? Yinsen was pushed on to his knees, a burning piece of coal was being\npushed closer and closer to his face, as he argued with the leader. Tony\nmanaged to get them to back off yelling that he needed him as an\nassistant.\u00a0<br></p><p>When they\nleave he starts to work harder. There\u2019s no more time. Before he knew it Yinsen\nwas helping it suit up, their homemade bomb ready to go off the second someone\nopens the door. The clock is ticking, everything needs to work. Nothing can go\nwrong or malfunction right now. As he\u2019s readying up, Yinsen makes him recite\nthe directions out of the cave. There are guards yelling at them from the door.\nYinsen frantically moves faster. The bomb goes if and they both realize now\nwhatever time they had is up.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Tony talks him through on the computer. Then Yinsen goes to do\nthe finishing touches of the suit. Tony tried to remain calm, noticing how\npanicked Yinsen had become.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGet to your cover. Make sure the check points are clear before\nyou follow me out, okay?\u201d Tony spoke, while Yinsen checked the progress\nbar.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe need more time,\u201d Yensin realized, the bar creeping up too\nslowly, he turned to look at Tony, \u201cHey, I\u2019m going to buy you some time.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cStick to the plan! Stick to the plan!\u201d Tony pleads as dread\nfills him, he\u2019s restricted into the suit, he can\u2019t do anything until the system\nis loaded. Gunshots filled the air, \u201cYinsen!\u201d He glared at the laptop, willing\nfor it to go faster.\u00a0<br></p><p>The power\ncut off as the suit, finished. Some of the men peered into the cave. Tony\nthrough himself into the mission. He needed to get out of here and find Yinsen.\nHis anger boiled over with each and everyone of his captors he met. They kept\nhim from his daughter, downed him, beat him, and made his life a living hell.\nNot to mention everything they had done to Yinsen. Now it was his turn to hurt\nthem.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>He finally made it toward the front of the cave. \u201cYinsen!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWatch out!\u201d Yinsen responded in a weak voice.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Tony narrowly missed a missile, shooting off one of his own\nquickly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cStark..\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony pushed off the package that had the man pinned down. Yinsen\nlooked weak but they couldn\u2019t stay here, \u201cC\u2019mon we gotta go. Move with me. Come\non we have a plan, we\u2019re gonna stick to it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis was always the plan, Stark,\u201d he spoke slowly, breathless.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon you\u2019re gonna go see your family, get up,\u201d he urged,\nhoping that the idea of seeing his family again would give Yinsen the spur of\nenergy that he needed.<br></p><p>\u201cMy family\nis dead. I\u2019m going to see them now, Stark. It\u2019s okay\u2026it\u2019s oka\u2026\u201d he took a\nhaggard breath, \u201cI want this\u2026.I want this.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what to do, except accept Yensin\u2019s choice. \u201cThank\nyou for saving me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDont waste it\u2026Don\u2019t waste your life,\u201d he took one last\nlabored breath before sagging into himself.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t waste his time. He could mourn later. Right now he\nhad to destroy all of his weapons and get as far as he could. Once he made his\nway out of the cave, he met hell fire of bullets. When they ran out it was his\nturn. Everyone in his way, everything with his name on it was destroyed in\nfire. Someone obviously hit something good, because his suit started\nmalfunctioning. Taking the chance, he set fire to the rest of the weapons. With\na click or a button, he went flying off. Something there caused a chain\nreaction of explosions, just barely missing him.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Suddenly, hundreds of feet in the air, the boosters are spent.\nAll that Tony can see is the ground coming at him quickly. There\u2019s no way he\ncould make it this far for this to be the end.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The crash land caused the suit to dismantle and partially bury\nhim in the sand.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNot bad\u2026\u201d he spoke, letting his head fall back.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>An explosion in the distance brought him out of his dazed state.\nThere was no time for rest. He pulled himself out of the wreck and sand before\npicking a direction hoping it would bring something, anything good.\u00a0<br></p><p>It had\nbeen so long, Tony had managed a weak jog every so often. Each breath caused a\nsurge of pain to his chest, his stomach was begging for anything, and his mouth\nfelt drier than the desert around him. The thoughts keeping him going were his\nfamily, Yinsen, and every change he was going to make the second he\ncould.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>His whole life he avoided responsibility. He made the toys and\ndidn\u2019t give a hell what anyone did with them the second they were out of his\nsight. Never had he meant for this to happen. All he had wanted was to help\nprotect people on the front line. Now, he experienced, first hand, what he\ncaused. He didn\u2019t like it. There were big changes to make.\u00a0</p><p>The sound of black hawks pulled him out of his thoughts.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d He screamed, his voice rough and gritty. He fell to his\nknees, throwing up a peace sign.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Rhodey ran over to him, \u201cHow was the funvee?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Tony couldn\u2019t help much more than a laugh.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNext time you ride with me, okay?\u201d Rhodey pulled him into a\nhug.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>To hell with dad\u2019s, \u2018Stark men are made of iron.\u2019 He leaned into\nRhodey\u2019s hug, feeling safer than he ever had in his life. Tony could finally\nthink about home and know he\u2019d get there.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Hours later, Rhodey left Tony\u2019s room for a second. Tony was\nsleeping he\u2019d be okay for now. He pulled out his phone.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>He didn\u2019t go through formalities. \u201cYN, he\u2019s coming home.\u201d<br></p><p>-</p><p>Tony was\nsafe. He was finally coming home. You could finally breathe. The stress had\nrolled off of you almost instantly the second Rhodey said it. He ended the call\nwhen he said some doctors wanted to do a check up on Tony.\u00a0</p><p>The following afternoon you were making a snack for Ro while she\nplayed with some of her toys in the kitchen. Since Tony\u2019s kidnapping, Ro had\ngrown more clingy. Not that she wasn\u2019t a cuddly kid, but sometimes she\u2019d cry as\nif you weren\u2019t going to come back when you left her with a her babysitter.\nLeaving her on those days hurt. One day, you had caught her just staring at a\npicture of Tony, sadly holding the frame. The whole situation was really\naffecting her in a way you didn\u2019t know understand. All you could do was go\nthrough some picture books with her and stay with her at all times unless it\nwas strictly necessary for you to go.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Some random news channel was playing as background noise. Ro\ndidn\u2019t know that Tony was going to come by later, a small surprise for her.\nEverything felt like it was back to normal. God, you were just happy Tony was\nsafe.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI never got to say goodbye to dad. I never got to say goodbye\nto my father,\u201d Tony\u2019s voice came from the speakers.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Ro looked at you, before running into the living room. \u201cDaddy!\nDaddy! Daddy!\u201d She stopped close to the TV, watching closely.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>This was a well worked cycle. Surprisingly the news channels\nwould recycle an old interview now and then for the Tony Stark is still missing\nfiller. Ro would run over expecting her father only to be met by a couple of\npixels. Which would be followed by a usual conversation.\u00a0<br></p><p>You walked\nover and picked her up, \u201cAre you okay, sweetheart?\u201d\u00a0\u201cMaybe we go there and see daddy?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMaybe soon.\u201d At least this time it was something you knew for\ncertain and not something you said hopefully.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she walked back to her toys, the bear she refused to let\ngo of dragging on the floor beside her.\u00a0</p><p>Your heart clenched, but he\u2019d be here for her soon enough. She\nwouldn\u2019t be given anymore laters. Turning your attention back to the TV, more\nfocused on his appearance rather than what he was saying. He looked as okay as\nyou could expect from someone that had been captive for three months. You\ncaught Tony saying something about shutting down the weapons manufacturing\ndivision and the outburst of the press. Stane was pushing him of the stage as\nTony spoke his piece.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>That was a surprising choice, but who were you to question\neverything he had experienced and seen. Having Tony back was your primary\nconcern. Going back to the kitchen, you finished chopping up Ro\u2019s fruit.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The two of you had a quiet day. She played on her set for a\nbetter part of it and asked you to read her a couple of books outside in the\ngrass. Around sunset, you decided it would be good to get Ro bathed and settled\ndown for the night.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>While you were in the bathroom with Ro, you heard the front door\nopen and close. It had to be Tony, he was the only person that had a key to\nyour home. Quickly, you rinsed her off and took her out of the bath.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMommy,\np\u2019eas play more in the bath,\u201d she pouted at you.\u00a0</p><p>You shook your head, \u201cSorry, Ro Bear, not today.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She started to cry as you helped her into a Buzz\nLightyear pajama set.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, c\u2019mon we don\u2019t need tears today. Tomorrow, I promise\nyou can play as long as you want in the water. Deal?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She nodded wiping her face, her lip still trembling,\u00a0\u201cAnd maybe\nbubbles?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe biggest bubbles.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Tony Bear?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201c\u2018Ony Bear is\u2026.\u2019Ony Bear in.. I take you,\u201d She grab your hand\nand led you over towards the living room. Ro stopped short in the hallway when\nshe saw him. \u201cDaddy? Daddy!\u201d Letting go of your hand, she ran to Tony, who was\ncrouched down ready to catch her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI missed you, Rugrat,\u201d he hugged her close, pressing a kiss to\nher head. Finally, he felt like he was home.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c\u2018Issed you too. Lots a lot,\u201d she pressed kisses to his cheek,\n\u201cStay with me forever, daddy. No more work ever ever.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\nall I want is to stay with you forever,\u201d He picked up Ro, not willing to let\nher go so soon. \u201cHey, you. What happened to \u2018we don\u2019t need tears today\u2019? You\u2019re\ngetting soft on me,\u201d Tony joked, walking over to pull you into a hug, \u201cRo, I\nthink your mommy loves me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you mostest.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t insult me like that,\u201d you joked pressing a kiss to his\ncheek, \u201cYou know I love you, Tones.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love the both of you,\u201d he pulled away, from you, \u201cRo, I have\nthis cup of ice cream with rainbow sprinkles. I don\u2019t think I can eat it\nmyself, help me out?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Tony walked over to the kitchen to grab the ice cream, Ro\u2019s arms\naround his neck keeping him in a hug. You let the two of them have their time\ntogether, soon enough you\u2019d get to talk to Tony.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cKnow my abc\u2019s now,\u201d Ro said, opening her mouth for another spoonful.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo way. Do it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA, b, c, d, m, n, o, w, now I know my abc\u2019s,\u201d she sang.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI like this remix. You really just took the meat of that song\nand threw out all of the annoying bits. What do you say your mommy and I teach\nyou the old people version sometime?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWith \u2018Ony Bear.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou got\nit.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The two of them had a conversation over ice cream. Happily\nignoring everything in the world together. Ro stayed on Tony\u2019s lap the entire\ntime, neither one of them wanted to be apart from each other. It was cute, sad\nwhen you thought of why, but they needed to be close.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know Ro, you and your mommy are two of the most beautiful\npeople I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he said, patting her back while she laid against him.\u00a0</p><p>She yawned resting her head against his shoulder, \u201cDaddy\u2019s\npretty too. Mommy says so.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYour mommy always thought I was pretty, but I think it\u2019s time\nfor you to get some sleep, Ro.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan I sleep with you daddy?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He stood and took her to your room. Ro was curled up against him\nas soon as he laid down beside her. Quietly he sang her, Here Comes the Sun,\nslowly lulling her to sleep. Tony laid there with her for a while,\ncontemplating. A small part of him, thought he wouldn\u2019t have made it back home.\nNow, he was going to throw that away and start a mission. He always promised Ro\nhe\u2019d be the best he could to even be worthy of being her father, maybe this was\nthe way to go.\u00a0<br></p><p>He pressed\na kiss to her head before he slid out from under Ro. As comfortable as he was\nhe wanted to talk to you.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Tony hugged you while you were washing the dishes.\n\u201cStroke my ego and tell me how much you missed me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou were gone?\u201d You teased, feeling something hard wedged\nagainst his chest and your back. Grabbing a towel, you dried off your hands,\n\u201cLemme see that?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He nodded, your hands went from his chest to his tie. \u201cThe least\nyou can do is buy me dinner,\u201d he winked at you as you unbuttoned his\nshirt.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you whatever dinner you want. Take that shirt off,\u201d\nyou spoke before you could think, seeing a light that was blocked out by thick\nfabric.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAny other time I\u2019d jump if you\u2019d say that, but I\u2019m going to\nneed a little help here.\u201d He nodded to his arm in the sling.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry, sorry.\u201d You helped him out. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat is keeping me alive,\u201d he sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s keeping pieces of\nshrapnel from digging in deeper. What do you think?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHonest?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCompletely.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cScientifically?\nThis is so cool. Don\u2019t you have a giant version of this running the company?\nHow did you miniaturize it?\u201d You paused, catching each and every scar and\nbruise that littered his body, \u201cAs a doctor, I think we need to get you running\nwithout a battery. When are you going to get it done?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNot anytime soon,\u201d he responded, \u201cI have bigger things on my\nmind than me. There are things I need to do. Before I make any of my moves, I\nneed to update my arc reactor. As nice as this hunk of scrap is, its running\nlow. Besides new things are always more fun. Shiner.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d You asked, grabbing his hand in yours.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhen aren\u2019t I okay?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re being tough,\u201d you pressed a kiss to his cheek, \u201cYou\ndon\u2019t have to talk to me, but come on Tony\u2026You were taken away for a long\ntime, I can\u2019t fathom what happened to you, and now you have a machine to keep\nyou up and running. You also just shut down the main export of your company.\nThat\u2019s a lot.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2026I- there was so much happening. Okay? The things I saw, I\ndon\u2019t want to be the cause of that anymore. My whole life I\u2019ve been reaping the\nbenefits of death and destruction.\u00a0 That\u2019s not a legacy I want. So, I\u2019m\ngoing to do something about it. You\u2019re going to have to trust me. Do you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course, I do. Still, you need to get this out.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMaybe,\none day, probably not. I\u2019m not getting your hopes up,\u201d he shook his head, \u201cYou\nknow as well as me that it\u2019s high risk. I have a daughter and I came back with\na mission. I won\u2019t risk it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You studied the small machine. \u201cWhat\u2019s this mission?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to make things right, YN. There are weapons of mine\nout there. I need to do whatever it takes.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You bit your lip. This was a new side of Tony. He was driven,\nyeah, but this was new. There was something different to his core.\n\u201cOkay\u2026.okay. Whatever you need, Tony. I got your back.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank you, YN.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d Ro ran in from the hallway, crying.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Tony pulled on his shirt. \u201cHey, Rugrat, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThink daddy left again.\u201d She cried into his shirt.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t happen again, okay?

You were a mess, it was difficult to\nconcentrate at work. The choice had been to take break, your mindset was too\nbad to take care of your patients. Anytime the phone rang, there was the hope\nthat you&rsquo;d hear Tony&rsquo;s voice mixed with the dread of Rhodey telling you he&rsquo;d\nnever come home.&nbsp;<br /></p><p><i>He&rsquo;s\ncoming home. He might not be home now. Later, who knows? He&rsquo;s coming home one\nday soon.&nbsp;</i><br /></p><p>The stress\nof Tony missing and Ro constantly, tearfully asking for him were too much to\nhandle. Ro wasn&rsquo;t accustomed to not being able to talk or see Tony when she\nwanted. It had been his one of his biggest rules. Tony had never felt he was\nallowed to talk to Howard at anytime unless Howard directly acknowledged him.\nHe didn&rsquo;t want that with Ro. So anytime Ro said she wanted to speak to her\nfather she did. Now she didn&rsquo;t understand why whenever she asked you said &lsquo;no&rsquo;\nor &lsquo;he&rsquo;s doing something, he can&rsquo;t talk right now.&rsquo; She didn&rsquo;t like these new\nchanges.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Mommy,\ndaddy no lo&rsquo; us,&rdquo; she said, after you told her he couldn&rsquo;t talk for seemingly\nthe millionth time since he went missing.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You rubbed\nyour face in frustration, &ldquo;Baby, your daddy loves you a lot. He just can&rsquo;t talk\nfor a while.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>She looked\nat you angrily, god that looked so much like Alex. &ldquo;Yes, he can!&rdquo; Ro yelled and\nthus began another tantrum. &ldquo;I want my daddy! I want my daddy!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Honestly,\nyou didn&rsquo;t blame her. You&rsquo;d throw a tantrum too if you could.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>The days\nbled into a month and you tried to move life on as always. Business as usual.\nThough business was a hell of a lot harder without Tony at your side helping\nout. You repressed the pain and through yourself into your work. Maybe, if you\nhelped enough people, whatever force there was would give you back your best\nfriend.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Rhodey was\nworking as hard as he could to find Tony. It weighed on you, but it had to be\nworse for Rhodey. He was supposed to protect him. He&rsquo;d been taking care of Tony\nsince he was that young naive kid people thought they could take advantage of\nin parties at MIT. Resources to look for Tony were restricted. Everyone kept\nsaying that Rhodey&rsquo;s searches were a lost cause, but he&rsquo;d gain enough respect\nfor them to humor him. Hoping as the second month rolled past he&rsquo;d give\nup.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>As if\nJames Rhodes would ever give up on Tony Stark.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Company\nwise, the man you had seen at the Stark&rsquo;s funeral was doing press. He seemed to\nbe taking over in Tony&rsquo;s absence. Something about him seemed off, but you knew\nbetter than to judge by public appearances. Besides, if he was to take over\nwhen Tony wasn&rsquo;t around, that meant Tony trusted him.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Some\nmorning news show was playing as background noise.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So,\nStane, it&rsquo;s been close to three months. How is the company doing without Stark\nat the head?&rdquo; the host asked.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;The company\nkeeps going the way it always does,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I only hope to run it the\nway Tony would want.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Long\nvacations, clubs, alcohol, and girls,&rdquo; the host joked.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Obadiah\nlaughed, &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Was Tony\nreally just a cheap joke to them when he&rsquo;d been missing so long now? You turned\noff the TV. Tony Stark was more than people made him out to be and you didn&rsquo;t\nneed to hear what they thought. He was more than the party scene. He was\nloving, caring, hardworking, held his emotions to his chest, and used\nsunglasses as a way to hide himself. Someone that was a genius by every\nmeasure, striving to push the world into a better future. A man that would\nraise someone else&rsquo;s child as his own, oddly enough something he had jokingly\npromised the day you met, and try with all his might to not repeat the sins of\nhis father. But all they saw was the alcoholic partier. A flat 2D image. Maybe\none day he&rsquo;d get to prove them all wrong.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>The phone\nrang.<br /></p><p>-</p><p>An explosion,\nthat&rsquo;s all it took to change it all.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>A second\nago he was cracking cheap jokes and posing for a picture, the next there&rsquo;s\nscreaming, gunfire, and death. That soldier wasn&rsquo;t much more than a\nkid&hellip;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>It takes a\nmoment to recover from the shock and fear. His brain finally kicking into\nflight mode. They&rsquo;re aiming at the Humvee, taking out all of the soldiers is\ntheir mission, he needs to get away from here. He runs out, there&rsquo;s no where to\ngo in the rainfall of bullets and explosives, but he manages to find a rock to\ntake cover behind.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Pulling\nout his phone, he frantically starts to shoot out a text. A whistle blows\nthrough the air and something crash lands not to far from where he is. He\nglances over to see death with his name on it.&nbsp;<br /></p><p><i>Fuck, fuck,\nfuck.&nbsp;</i><br /></p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t\nhave time to get away. He didn&rsquo;t design it to give anyone time to get away. The\nshock and adrenaline blocking the pain for now. Almost in disbelief he pulls\nopen his button down, blood flowing from wounds where the shrapnel pierced through\nhis vest. There&rsquo;s not much time to think of anything else before he passes out.\nBriefly, Tony is conscious enough to know he&rsquo;s being transported. He doesn&rsquo;t\nhave enough brain power to judge it as a good or bad thing, the pain being\ncenter focus. Tony loses consciousness again.<i>&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p>Later a\nbag is pulled off of his head and he sluggishly put everything together. The\nbright lights, a camera, and a man talking as if making negotiations, all\nhighlighted with him being tied up. Something at the back of his head bit at\nhim, saying he should have spent his time with Ro instead of some reporter he\ncouldn&rsquo;t remember the name of. His chest was killing him. After the group makes\nwhatever message they wanted to they drag him somewhere else, his consciousness\ncoming in and out in waves.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>That&rsquo;s\nwhen the nightmare really starts. Someone is digging into his chest, causing\nthe worst pain he&rsquo;s ever felt. He can&rsquo;t hold in his screams. Cloth is shoved\ninto his mouth and who knows how many people are holding him down when he\nattempts to thrash away. There&rsquo;s not even the freedom of being unconscious\nuntil the torture is done. He didn&rsquo;t even let go on his own, someone dragged\nhim down with chloroform.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He finally\ncame around a final time. There was a man, Tony didn&rsquo;t know if he was a friend\nor foe. When he tries to move, he&rsquo;s stopped abruptly by something&hellip;connected\nto him? Following the chords frantically, he rips off his bandages. The flesh\nraw and haggard around a machine. Tony studies the thing in his chest. It\nweighs on him, each breath bringing a new bout of pain. It wasn&rsquo;t any use being\na baby about pain now, he had things to figure out. Not like anyone here would\ngive him any pain medication anytime soon. He&rsquo;d be lucky if it didn&rsquo;t get\ninfected somehow.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>The first\nthing that spills from his mouth is an accusatory, &ldquo;What the hell did you do to\nme?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Quickly\nconnecting the dots that the man was also a prisoner. The man had taken some of\nThe shrapnel out, the pieces still inside of his chest were working to kill\nhim. All that was keeping him alive was a car battery and electromagnet.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Tony took\nin his surroundings. Dimly lit, cold, with a dank smell topping everything off.\nA camera was in place, watching him and the man. Speaking of which this man\nmust have been dying for company. He was rambling about having met himself\nbefore.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t\nremember&hellip;&rdquo; he answered gruffly, partially listening as his mind raced for\nsome kind of solution.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>His roommate\nstarted recounting one of his drunken speeches. Something that happened more\nthan not. But he was a functional alcoholic so what did it matter if he could\nstill get the job done. He paid little mind to the conversation. Banging on the\ndoor caused the man to stand hurriedly commanding him to be quiet and mimic\nhim.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>A group\nwalks in, as dim as it was Tony could recognize his work anywhere. &ldquo;Those are\nmy guns. How did they get my guns?&rdquo; The words leave his mouth, he doesn&rsquo;t\nrealize it but they do.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>His\npartner reprimands him, as one of their new guest starts talking. There&rsquo;s not\nmuch for him to catch beside his own name. When signaled his roommate starts to\ntranslate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;He says, &lsquo;Welcome Tony Stark, the most famous mass murderer in\nthe history of America&hellip;.he&rsquo;s honored&hellip;he wants you to build a missile&hellip;the\nJericho middle the one you demonstrated,&rdquo; his roommate is handed a photo and he\nshowed it to Tony, &ldquo;This one.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>In a span of less than two days he had been called a Merchant of\nDeath and the most famous mass murderer. Something in him was changing, a day\nago he probably would have agreed, topping it off with a lame joke. Now? Now he\nsaw things first hand. People he wanted to fight against seemingly respected\nhim. Looking at the man defiantly, Tony responded, &ldquo;I refuse.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Their choice had been made. Torture into compliance. They ducked\nhis head in the water for as long as they wanted, letting him back up for the\nsmallest of gasp. He knew they wouldn&rsquo;t kill him. They needed him to make the\nweapon. Once the group finally got tired, they put a sack over his head and\nwalked him out of the cave. He was already counting his steps and committing\nthe directions to memory.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Blinded by\nthe sun, his eyes finally came back to focus. All around his weapons were\nscattered and thrown about. His name glaring at him from all angles. Was he\ndirectly responsible? No. But he made this all, without him they&rsquo;d have\nnothing. Without him those soldiers would be alive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>He shook his captors hand, knowing well that making the Jericho\nwould get him killed. That was okay, he could work on pretenses. They didn&rsquo;t\nknow what went into making the weapon. Just that alone would give him some\nleeway, but they&rsquo;d catch on quickly. All he needed to do was be quicker. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re looking for you, Stark. But they&rsquo;d never\nfind you here in these mountains. Look, out there, what you saw? That is your\nlegacy. Your weapons in the hands of those murderers! Is that how you want to\ngo out? Is this the last act of defiance of the great Tony Stark? Or are you\ngoing to do something about it?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;\"Why should I do anything? Either way, they&rsquo;re gonna kill\nyou and me, and if not, then I&rsquo;ll likely be dead by the end of the week\"&nbsp;</p><p>\"Well then, this will be a very important week for you,\nwon&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>It was the push he needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>First things first, to stop lugging around that car battery. The\nupgrade to an arc reactor would be the golden ticket. He did the calculations,\nalready working on how to minimize the reactor to something functional that can\nwork as fuel. Next would be a suit, something that he could use to clear the\npath.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Tony\nworked by himself, much to his roommate&rsquo;s annoyance. So, Tony had him scavenge\nfor the palladium. After gathering the 1.6 grams, they melted it now and poured\nit into the mold Tony had constructed. Everything was hanging on this, it was a\nlimited resource.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Careful. Careful, we only get one shot at this,&rdquo; Tony\nwarned.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Relax. I have steady hands. Why do you think you&rsquo;re still\nalive?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe knowing the name of his new lab partner would be good.\n&ldquo;What do I call you?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;My name is Yinsen,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yinsen, nice to meet you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Tony ignored the annoyed glance he was given. Sure they met before,\nbut did it really count if he was drunk off his ass? Yinsen turned into his\nright hand, it would have been impossible to form some kind of bond. They were\nall the other had.&nbsp;</p><p>Once the arc reactor was completed, he showed Yinsen the suit he\nhad made a blueprint. Fifteen minutes, that&rsquo;s all they got for fuel. At least\nhe didn&rsquo;t have to worry about the shrapnel in his chest being kept at bay with\na dying battery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Got a family?&rdquo; Tony asked during a game of backgammon.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes and I will see them when I leave here,&rdquo; Yinsen answered,\nalways so sure, &ldquo;And you Stark?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Tony\nstayed quiet, trying to decide what would be the best answer. Honestly, he\ndidn&rsquo;t try to think of anything except the escape. If he did he got distracted,\nsad, something that couldn&rsquo;t sidetrack him right now. There was also the fact\nthat there could always be someone listening in. He couldn&rsquo;t risk it. &ldquo;&hellip;No.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re a man that has everything and nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>He&rsquo;d tell Yinsen about his little girl when they were\nfreed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The days bled and blended into one another. No clue how long he\nhad been captive. Did he really want to know? Tony worked restlessly. He needed\nout. He needed to go home. All he wanted was to see his daughter and see that\nsmile of hers that looked so much like yours. That&rsquo;s why he worked tirelessly\nto build this suit. It was close to finished but not quite.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>His and Yinsen&rsquo;s captors barged in. The leader saying whatever\nabout Genghis Khan and soon it would be his turn to rule. How Stark weapons are\nthe way to secure that in this land. Only, Stark wasn&rsquo;t building his weapon,\nwas he? Yinsen was pushed on to his knees, a burning piece of coal was being\npushed closer and closer to his face, as he argued with the leader. Tony\nmanaged to get them to back off yelling that he needed him as an\nassistant.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>When they\nleave he starts to work harder. There&rsquo;s no more time. Before he knew it Yinsen\nwas helping it suit up, their homemade bomb ready to go off the second someone\nopens the door. The clock is ticking, everything needs to work. Nothing can go\nwrong or malfunction right now. As he&rsquo;s readying up, Yinsen makes him recite\nthe directions out of the cave. There are guards yelling at them from the door.\nYinsen frantically moves faster. The bomb goes if and they both realize now\nwhatever time they had is up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Tony talks him through on the computer. Then Yinsen goes to do\nthe finishing touches of the suit. Tony tried to remain calm, noticing how\npanicked Yinsen had become.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Get to your cover. Make sure the check points are clear before\nyou follow me out, okay?&rdquo; Tony spoke, while Yinsen checked the progress\nbar.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We need more time,&rdquo; Yensin realized, the bar creeping up too\nslowly, he turned to look at Tony, &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m going to buy you some time.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Stick to the plan! Stick to the plan!&rdquo; Tony pleads as dread\nfills him, he&rsquo;s restricted into the suit, he can&rsquo;t do anything until the system\nis loaded. Gunshots filled the air, &ldquo;Yinsen!&rdquo; He glared at the laptop, willing\nfor it to go faster.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>The power\ncut off as the suit, finished. Some of the men peered into the cave. Tony\nthrough himself into the mission. He needed to get out of here and find Yinsen.\nHis anger boiled over with each and everyone of his captors he met. They kept\nhim from his daughter, downed him, beat him, and made his life a living hell.\nNot to mention everything they had done to Yinsen. Now it was his turn to hurt\nthem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>He finally made it toward the front of the cave. &ldquo;Yinsen!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Watch out!&rdquo; Yinsen responded in a weak voice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Tony narrowly missed a missile, shooting off one of his own\nquickly.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Stark..&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Tony pushed off the package that had the man pinned down. Yinsen\nlooked weak but they couldn&rsquo;t stay here, &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon we gotta go. Move with me. Come\non we have a plan, we&rsquo;re gonna stick to it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;This was always the plan, Stark,&rdquo; he spoke slowly, breathless.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon you&rsquo;re gonna go see your family, get up,&rdquo; he urged,\nhoping that the idea of seeing his family again would give Yinsen the spur of\nenergy that he needed.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;My family\nis dead. I&rsquo;m going to see them now, Stark. It&rsquo;s okay&hellip;it&rsquo;s oka&hellip;&rdquo; he took a\nhaggard breath, &ldquo;I want this&hellip;.I want this.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t know what to do, except accept Yensin&rsquo;s choice. &ldquo;Thank\nyou for saving me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Dont waste it&hellip;Don&rsquo;t waste your life,&rdquo; he took one last\nlabored breath before sagging into himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Tony didn&rsquo;t waste his time. He could mourn later. Right now he\nhad to destroy all of his weapons and get as far as he could. Once he made his\nway out of the cave, he met hell fire of bullets. When they ran out it was his\nturn. Everyone in his way, everything with his name on it was destroyed in\nfire. Someone obviously hit something good, because his suit started\nmalfunctioning. Taking the chance, he set fire to the rest of the weapons. With\na click or a button, he went flying off. Something there caused a chain\nreaction of explosions, just barely missing him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Suddenly, hundreds of feet in the air, the boosters are spent.\nAll that Tony can see is the ground coming at him quickly. There&rsquo;s no way he\ncould make it this far for this to be the end.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The crash land caused the suit to dismantle and partially bury\nhim in the sand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Not bad&hellip;&rdquo; he spoke, letting his head fall back.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>An explosion in the distance brought him out of his dazed state.\nThere was no time for rest. He pulled himself out of the wreck and sand before\npicking a direction hoping it would bring something, anything good.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>It had\nbeen so long, Tony had managed a weak jog every so often. Each breath caused a\nsurge of pain to his chest, his stomach was begging for anything, and his mouth\nfelt drier than the desert around him. The thoughts keeping him going were his\nfamily, Yinsen, and every change he was going to make the second he\ncould.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>His whole life he avoided responsibility. He made the toys and\ndidn&rsquo;t give a hell what anyone did with them the second they were out of his\nsight. Never had he meant for this to happen. All he had wanted was to help\nprotect people on the front line. Now, he experienced, first hand, what he\ncaused. He didn&rsquo;t like it. There were big changes to make.&nbsp;</p><p>The sound of black hawks pulled him out of his thoughts.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; He screamed, his voice rough and gritty. He fell to his\nknees, throwing up a peace sign.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Rhodey ran over to him, &ldquo;How was the funvee?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tony couldn&rsquo;t help much more than a laugh.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Next time you ride with me, okay?&rdquo; Rhodey pulled him into a\nhug.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To hell with dad&rsquo;s, &lsquo;Stark men are made of iron.&rsquo; He leaned into\nRhodey&rsquo;s hug, feeling safer than he ever had in his life. Tony could finally\nthink about home and know he&rsquo;d get there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Hours later, Rhodey left Tony&rsquo;s room for a second. Tony was\nsleeping he&rsquo;d be okay for now. He pulled out his phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t go through formalities. &ldquo;YN, he&rsquo;s coming home.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>-</p><p>Tony was\nsafe. He was finally coming home. You could finally breathe. The stress had\nrolled off of you almost instantly the second Rhodey said it. He ended the call\nwhen he said some doctors wanted to do a check up on Tony.&nbsp;</p><p>The following afternoon you were making a snack for Ro while she\nplayed with some of her toys in the kitchen. Since Tony&rsquo;s kidnapping, Ro had\ngrown more clingy. Not that she wasn&rsquo;t a cuddly kid, but sometimes she&rsquo;d cry as\nif you weren&rsquo;t going to come back when you left her with a her babysitter.\nLeaving her on those days hurt. One day, you had caught her just staring at a\npicture of Tony, sadly holding the frame. The whole situation was really\naffecting her in a way you didn&rsquo;t know understand. All you could do was go\nthrough some picture books with her and stay with her at all times unless it\nwas strictly necessary for you to go.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Some random news channel was playing as background noise. Ro\ndidn&rsquo;t know that Tony was going to come by later, a small surprise for her.\nEverything felt like it was back to normal. God, you were just happy Tony was\nsafe.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I never got to say goodbye to dad. I never got to say goodbye\nto my father,&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s voice came from the speakers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Ro looked at you, before running into the living room. &ldquo;Daddy!\nDaddy! Daddy!&rdquo; She stopped close to the TV, watching closely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This was a well worked cycle. Surprisingly the news channels\nwould recycle an old interview now and then for the Tony Stark is still missing\nfiller. Ro would run over expecting her father only to be met by a couple of\npixels. Which would be followed by a usual conversation.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You walked\nover and picked her up, &ldquo;Are you okay, sweetheart?&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe we go there and see daddy?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe soon.&rdquo; At least this time it was something you knew for\ncertain and not something you said hopefully.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; she walked back to her toys, the bear she refused to let\ngo of dragging on the floor beside her.&nbsp;</p><p>Your heart clenched, but he&rsquo;d be here for her soon enough. She\nwouldn&rsquo;t be given anymore laters. Turning your attention back to the TV, more\nfocused on his appearance rather than what he was saying. He looked as okay as\nyou could expect from someone that had been captive for three months. You\ncaught Tony saying something about shutting down the weapons manufacturing\ndivision and the outburst of the press. Stane was pushing him of the stage as\nTony spoke his piece.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>That was a surprising choice, but who were you to question\neverything he had experienced and seen. Having Tony back was your primary\nconcern. Going back to the kitchen, you finished chopping up Ro&rsquo;s fruit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The two of you had a quiet day. She played on her set for a\nbetter part of it and asked you to read her a couple of books outside in the\ngrass. Around sunset, you decided it would be good to get Ro bathed and settled\ndown for the night.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>While you were in the bathroom with Ro, you heard the front door\nopen and close. It had to be Tony, he was the only person that had a key to\nyour home. Quickly, you rinsed her off and took her out of the bath.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Mommy,\np&rsquo;eas play more in the bath,&rdquo; she pouted at you.&nbsp;</p><p>You shook your head, &ldquo;Sorry, Ro Bear, not today.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; She started to cry as you helped her into a Buzz\nLightyear pajama set.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, hey, c&rsquo;mon we don&rsquo;t need tears today. Tomorrow, I promise\nyou can play as long as you want in the water. Deal?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>She nodded wiping her face, her lip still trembling,&nbsp;&ldquo;And maybe\nbubbles?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The biggest bubbles.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Deal.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Tony Bear?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ony Bear is&hellip;.&rsquo;Ony Bear in.. I take you,&rdquo; She grab your hand\nand led you over towards the living room. Ro stopped short in the hallway when\nshe saw him. &ldquo;Daddy? Daddy!&rdquo; Letting go of your hand, she ran to Tony, who was\ncrouched down ready to catch her.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I missed you, Rugrat,&rdquo; he hugged her close, pressing a kiss to\nher head. Finally, he felt like he was home.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Issed you too. Lots a lot,&rdquo; she pressed kisses to his cheek,\n&ldquo;Stay with me forever, daddy. No more work ever ever.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sweetheart,\nall I want is to stay with you forever,&rdquo; He picked up Ro, not willing to let\nher go so soon. &ldquo;Hey, you. What happened to &lsquo;we don&rsquo;t need tears today&rsquo;? You&rsquo;re\ngetting soft on me,&rdquo; Tony joked, walking over to pull you into a hug, &ldquo;Ro, I\nthink your mommy loves me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you mostest.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t insult me like that,&rdquo; you joked pressing a kiss to his\ncheek, &ldquo;You know I love you, Tones.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I love the both of you,&rdquo; he pulled away, from you, &ldquo;Ro, I have\nthis cup of ice cream with rainbow sprinkles. I don&rsquo;t think I can eat it\nmyself, help me out?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Tony walked over to the kitchen to grab the ice cream, Ro&rsquo;s arms\naround his neck keeping him in a hug. You let the two of them have their time\ntogether, soon enough you&rsquo;d get to talk to Tony.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Know my abc&rsquo;s now,&rdquo; Ro said, opening her mouth for another spoonful.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;No way. Do it for me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A, b, c, d, m, n, o, w, now I know my abc&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she sang.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I like this remix. You really just took the meat of that song\nand threw out all of the annoying bits. What do you say your mommy and I teach\nyou the old people version sometime?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;With &lsquo;Ony Bear.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You got\nit.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>The two of them had a conversation over ice cream. Happily\nignoring everything in the world together. Ro stayed on Tony&rsquo;s lap the entire\ntime, neither one of them wanted to be apart from each other. It was cute, sad\nwhen you thought of why, but they needed to be close.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You know Ro, you and your mommy are two of the most beautiful\npeople I&rsquo;ve ever seen,&rdquo; he said, patting her back while she laid against him.&nbsp;</p><p>She yawned resting her head against his shoulder, &ldquo;Daddy&rsquo;s\npretty too. Mommy says so.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Your mommy always thought I was pretty, but I think it&rsquo;s time\nfor you to get some sleep, Ro.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Can I sleep with you daddy?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>He stood and took her to your room. Ro was curled up against him\nas soon as he laid down beside her. Quietly he sang her, Here Comes the Sun,\nslowly lulling her to sleep. Tony laid there with her for a while,\ncontemplating. A small part of him, thought he wouldn&rsquo;t have made it back home.\nNow, he was going to throw that away and start a mission. He always promised Ro\nhe&rsquo;d be the best he could to even be worthy of being her father, maybe this was\nthe way to go.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He pressed\na kiss to her head before he slid out from under Ro. As comfortable as he was\nhe wanted to talk to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Tony hugged you while you were washing the dishes.\n&ldquo;Stroke my ego and tell me how much you missed me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You were gone?&rdquo; You teased, feeling something hard wedged\nagainst his chest and your back. Grabbing a towel, you dried off your hands,\n&ldquo;Lemme see that?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>He nodded, your hands went from his chest to his tie. &ldquo;The least\nyou can do is buy me dinner,&rdquo; he winked at you as you unbuttoned his\nshirt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make you whatever dinner you want. Take that shirt off,&rdquo;\nyou spoke before you could think, seeing a light that was blocked out by thick\nfabric.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Any other time I&rsquo;d jump if you&rsquo;d say that, but I&rsquo;m going to\nneed a little help here.&rdquo; He nodded to his arm in the sling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, sorry.&rdquo; You helped him out. &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That is keeping me alive,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s keeping pieces of\nshrapnel from digging in deeper. What do you think?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Honest?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Completely.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Scientifically?\nThis is so cool. Don&rsquo;t you have a giant version of this running the company?\nHow did you miniaturize it?&rdquo; You paused, catching each and every scar and\nbruise that littered his body, &ldquo;As a doctor, I think we need to get you running\nwithout a battery. When are you going to get it done?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Not anytime soon,&rdquo; he responded, &ldquo;I have bigger things on my\nmind than me. There are things I need to do. Before I make any of my moves, I\nneed to update my arc reactor. As nice as this hunk of scrap is, its running\nlow. Besides new things are always more fun. Shiner.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; You asked, grabbing his hand in yours.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;When aren&rsquo;t I okay?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re being tough,&rdquo; you pressed a kiss to his cheek, &ldquo;You\ndon&rsquo;t have to talk to me, but come on Tony&hellip;You were taken away for a long\ntime, I can&rsquo;t fathom what happened to you, and now you have a machine to keep\nyou up and running. You also just shut down the main export of your company.\nThat&rsquo;s a lot.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;I- there was so much happening. Okay? The things I saw, I\ndon&rsquo;t want to be the cause of that anymore. My whole life I&rsquo;ve been reaping the\nbenefits of death and destruction.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s not a legacy I want. So, I&rsquo;m\ngoing to do something about it. You&rsquo;re going to have to trust me. Do you?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, I do. Still, you need to get this out.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Maybe,\none day, probably not. I&rsquo;m not getting your hopes up,&rdquo; he shook his head, &ldquo;You\nknow as well as me that it&rsquo;s high risk. I have a daughter and I came back with\na mission. I won&rsquo;t risk it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You studied the small machine. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this mission?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to make things right, YN. There are weapons of mine\nout there. I need to do whatever it takes.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You bit your lip. This was a new side of Tony. He was driven,\nyeah, but this was new. There was something different to his core.\n&ldquo;Okay&hellip;.okay. Whatever you need, Tony. I got your back.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, YN.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Daddy!&rdquo; Ro ran in from the hallway, crying.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Tony pulled on his shirt. &ldquo;Hey, Rugrat, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Think daddy left again.&rdquo; She cried into his shirt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t happen again, okay? Come on you two, we should get\nsome sleep. YN, my sketchbook still in the drawer next to your bed?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Everything Tag:<strike>@sophiatomlinson23</strike>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muI5pmOUaX6wvmS3rzWyaFg\" target=\"_blank\">@cannonindeez</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/my7g8KcFN6EbHEEQNgdmeoQ\" target=\"_blank\">@memyselfandmaddox</a></p><p>Marvel Tag: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMV35nTj6jDdZK3AKJ-9Now\" target=\"_blank\">@asguardiansoftheavengers</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLqLl0ejJDMoaJw31Etn_-g\" target=\"_blank\">@letsgetfuckingsuperwholocked</a></p><p>Tony Stark Tag: <strike>@Mrunmayi</strike> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYuWf_sRi7ogVm-JTdgXcbQ\" target=\"_blank\">@bit-bot0711</a><br /></p><p>Strikes didn&rsquo;t work.</p>",

        "body": "<p>A/N: SO, I usually don\u2019t post stuff like this, but the wonderful <a>@startrekkingaroundasgard</a>\u200b had a 2K writing challenge about tropes and no one had taken the coffee shop AU yet, which I thought was a shame and a disaster, so here we go. Hope you enjoy :D</p><p>Tony had always thought he would despise working in the service industry. Given the amount everyone around him complained about it, he had expected he would be trying to commit harakiri with a milk frother within the week, since whatever Hades had in store for him would be less bad than dealing with one more person who pronounced cappuccino wrong.</p><p>And yet, now that he&rsquo;s here, he&rsquo;s enjoying himself. The coffee shop, called Impresso Espresso (insert forced laughter here), is across from a college campus, so most of his customers are caffeine-addicted students, hands shaking and eyes wide open from either too much Redbull or too much cocaine (it&rsquo;s a toss up at this age, really) and their professors, with under-eye bags so large they can put all the assignments they still have to mark in them, leaving their hands free for a carton cup with seven shots of espresso. Tony enjoys winking at all of them and trying to make them laugh, every smile a reward better than the free coffee that comes with the job.</p><p>During the classic afternoon lull, when the students are in bed and the professors in class, Tony puts the mechanics degree that put him deep in debt but didn&rsquo;t provide him with a job due to his well-meaning but obnoxious demeanour to good use by upgrading the ancient coffee machines, that were apparently purchased in the late seventies, max- or maybe modern technology just isn&rsquo;t as great as people often make it out to be.</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s manager, Matt, captain of the American football team who likes his coffee like he likes his math problems, simple, watches this thirty-something man become increasingly comfortable in a coffee shop populated mostly by those ten years younger or older than him with a mix between amazement and amusement. Besides, the coffee machines, that previously took ten minutes of gentle conversation with an increasingly impatient customer to create something as simple as a cup of tea, can now whip up a doppio in a record-holding 17.8 seconds, according to Tony. To Matt, it just feels like approximately 20 seconds, but, apparently, the exact time is of great importance to Tony, who, one night during midterms season when the coffee shop is open 24/7 to accommodate all the students pulling all-nighters, calls Matt at 3 am to announce he has shortened this time to 17.7 seconds. Apart from that hiccup, though, Tony is a good employee and Matt is satisfied.</p><!-- more --><p>On a dreary Thursday in February, one of the other baristas asks Matt: &ldquo;Have you seen the professor around, lately? I feel like it&rsquo;s been awhile since we&rsquo;ve had a queue of 20+ people- do you think he&rsquo;s ill?&rdquo;</p><p>Matt smiles. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about him, he&rsquo;s at a conference. He told me about it last time he was here, right before he told me off about not stirring his coffee correctly, or putting too much syrup in it. I&rsquo;m not sure what it was that time, but it was clear he wasn&rsquo;t happy.&rdquo;</p><p>The barista laughs. &ldquo;Is he ever?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony, who is leaning on the counter, watching the students run by, text books over their head, more concerned with protecting their haircut than the $200 the book cost them, hears the comment. &ldquo;Who are you talking about?&rdquo; he asks, intrigued.</p><p>&ldquo;Just this crazy customer who comes here a lot,&rdquo; Matt says. &ldquo;He teaches something very scientific and complicated, and his order is absolutely ridiculous. You should be glad you&rsquo;re first month here has coincided with a four-week conference in Silicon Valley he had to go to. He&rsquo;s a nightmare.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony laughs. &ldquo;Oh come one, he can&rsquo;t be that bad.&rdquo;</p><p>Matt rolls his eyes at the other barista, pulling off her apron now that her shift has ended. She waves at the two men behind the bar before exiting the coffee shop, the door being held open for her by a customer just about the enter the shop.</p><p>The customer enters the cafe, his eyes gliding over the neon Impresso Espresso sign behind the counter like he is disappointed still no one has realised what a horrible idea it was to put it there. Behind Tony, Matt sighs. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll teach me to speak of the devil. That&rsquo;s him, the professor. You take him, you&rsquo;ve never had to suffer through his demands.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony steps up to the register just as the man reaches the counter. He is wearing thick, black glasses that almost completely hide his grey eyes. The top button of his checkered shirt is undone, but it doesn&rsquo;t look on purpose, more like he just forgot there was another button before he finished dressing himself. His large, black cardigan is wrapped around his body like a blanket. He is younger than Tony expected, for a professor being invited to month-long conferences. He also doesn&rsquo;t look like someone who has an order complicated enough to make his colleagues this bitter (pun intended).</p><p>When the man opens his mouth to place his order, Tony expects the other employees to have pulled a prank on him, expects the man to just order a black coffee, and maybe, maybe, make a joke about the colour of his soul. Instead, he hits Tony with this beauty of a coffee order: &ldquo;I would like a latte, but instead of only milk, I would like half milk half hot water. The milk should be equal parts almond and coconut, with an extra dash of soy. Stir that exactly two and a half times clockwise. Then, add in a full glass of skimmed milk, that has been frothed for exactly 12.5 seconds, shake it up with ice, pour half of the drink out, and heat the other half up again, which needs to be stirred twelve times anti-clockwise at a temperature of 63 Celsius or 145.4 Fahrenheit. Take it off the heat at 98.7 Celsius or 209.67 Fahrenheit. I would like three and a quarter pumps of sugar-free vanilla syrup, seven packets of sugar, two pumps of caramel syrup, make sure to add that in after the sugar, otherwise you ruin the taste, and .4 pump of hazelnut. Then, I would like some cocoa powder, pour the coffee in with ice and shake it up again. I would also like whipped cream on top, but then please shave it off again, so there&rsquo;s only a little bit of whipped cream left. Pay with card, please.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s mouth falls open. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding!&rdquo; he exclaims. Behind him, he hears Matt snicker. The man begins to explain the importance of each individual step to the flavour of the beverage, but Tony interrupts him: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my order!&rdquo;</p><p>A smile forms on the man&rsquo;s face, grey eyes sparkling. &ldquo;Finally, someone with good taste around here,&rdquo; he says, giving Matt, whose jaw has slammed through the floor of the coffee shop and is currently making its way to the centre of the earth, a side eye. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know the crucial timing of the stirring, then.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony nods. &ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; he says, with a stern face, fully aware of how important these things are. One of the reasons he had decided to start working in a coffee shop was that he would finally be able to make this order perfectly for himself. He can&rsquo;t believe another person with a brain as small as a human&rsquo;s has been smart enough to realise this order is the only way coffee is anything near drinkable. &ldquo;Name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bruce,&rdquo; the man answers, and Tony hits the buttons on the register to allow the man to pay for his drink, even though he believes that thinking like that should be rewarded with a free coffee, before writing Bruce on the cup in his squiggly handwriting.</p><p>A solid twenty minutes and 27 grumbling people in line behind Bruce later, Tony presents the coffee with a flourish Shakespearean actors would be jealous of, putting a lid on the take-away cup before sliding it across the counter towards Bruce. &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t need a lid,&rdquo; Bruce says, and pulls on the lid. However, in his enthusiasm, Tony has pressed down a bit harder than was fully necessary, and, no matter how much Bruce pulls, the lid is not giving way.</p><p>Tony snickers. &ldquo;Well, someone&rsquo;s got muscles that would give the Hulk a run for his money.&rdquo;</p><p>Bruce laughs, too, and pushes the cup back towards Tony. &ldquo;Can you do it?&rdquo; Tony easily takes of the lid and slides the now lidless cup to Bruce. With a smile and a nod of his head, Bruce exits the coffee shop.</p><p>Over the next week, Bruce comes back twice a day, once in the early morning, and once for a pick-me-up in the middle of the afternoon. Tony learns his schedule quickly enough, and ensures he arrives a bit too early and leaves a bit too late for his shifts, so he can be there to make Bruce&rsquo;s coffee. He doesn&rsquo;t ask for the man&rsquo;s name anymore, instead scribbling Hulk, No Lid on his cup, something that amuses Bruce, which is only indicated by the sparkle in his eyes when he reads it. Most of Bruce&rsquo;s emotions seems to be conveyed through his eyes, and Tony starts making subtle alterations to his order depending on the look in them- an extra shot of coffee if they&rsquo;re especially tired, some more syrup when he&rsquo;s looking down, and some extra milk when Bruce&rsquo;s eyes are dull, in replacement for Tony&rsquo;s wish to put his hand on his stubbled cheek and his lips against his forehead to soften the pain he sees hiding behind the grey clouds in Bruce&rsquo;s irises. He knows Bruce notices, when his eyes regain some of the sparkle Tony had seen that first time they had met after he takes his first sip, thanking Tony with a simple nod of the head and a half-smile, which Tony cherishes more than the few coins Bruce drops in the tip jar whenever he visits the shop.</p><p>They talk every time, sharing jabs and ideas, words and looks, until Matt has had enough of it. One particularly rainy afternoon in March, he punches Tony&rsquo;s arm in a way that&rsquo;s soft for a quarterback such as Matt, but hard for a skinny 5'9 guy like Tony, and he has to take a side step to prevent himself from falling against one of the coffee machines.</p><p>&ldquo;When are you finally gonna do something about that, man?&rdquo; Matt asks. Tony raises an eyebrow, innocence painted on his face. It&rsquo;s as much of a forgery as most of Da Vinci&rsquo;s paintings, though, and Matt knows it. &ldquo;You kids have been flirting under my nose for over a month now,&rdquo; he continues, ignoring the fact that both of the men he&rsquo;s talking about are at least ten years older than he is. &ldquo;You need to make a move, dude. Now!&rdquo;</p><p>Tony gestures at the window, where Bruce can be seen crossing the street to the college campus, coffee in his hand. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone, Matt,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;What do you want me to do? Go after him?&rdquo;</p><p>Matt nods enthusiastically. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what you should do! Run after him, ask him out! Don&rsquo;t be such a wimp!&rdquo; He pulls Tony&rsquo;s apron over his head and pushes him towards the door.</p><p>Tony struggles against Matt&rsquo;s indisputably superior physical strength. &ldquo;I never took you to be such a romantic,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Might harm that cool image you&rsquo;ve got going on.&rdquo;</p><p>Matt snickers. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not talking your way out of this one, Tony,&rdquo; he says, opening the door with one hand and pushing Tony through it with the other. &ldquo;Now, go!&rdquo;</p><p>With not much other choice, Tony runs across the road, waving at the sleek black car that almost hit him, driven by an extremely annoyed-looking red haired woman who seems to have half a mind to simply step on the gas and run him over. He makes it across the street in one piece though, and yells: &ldquo;Bruce!&rdquo;</p><p>The other man is so shocked by someone yelling his name that he promptly drops his coffee cup. He spins around, hands risen next to his head as if showing he has no weapons. His wet hair is plastered to his forehead, and his navy blazer darkens where the rain hits him, since he isn&rsquo;t wearing a coat. Neither is Tony himself, he realizes, now that the rain is making his white T-shirt quickly turn see-through. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just me,&rdquo; Tony says.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. Did I forget something?&rdquo; Bruce pets the pockets of his blazer.</p><p>Tony shakes his head. &ldquo;No, I eh\u2026 I\u2026&rdquo; He has always been a man of words, but now, faced with a nervous, drenched professor whose coffee is spilling all over the pavement between their feet, he doesn&rsquo;t know what to say. &ldquo;Can I buy you a new coffee?&rdquo; he asks, hating the clenched way his voice comes out of his mouth. &ldquo;Maybe we could, you know, talk. Somewhere else than in there.&rdquo; He gestures at Impresso Espresso, where Matt is grinning broadly behind the windows. &ldquo;Somewhere he can&rsquo;t see us.&rdquo;</p><p>Bruce smiles, with both his eyes and his mouth, and Tony has to resist the urge to run back and high-five Matt. &ldquo;That would be nice. There&rsquo;s a decent place just up the road.&rdquo; He gestures in a vague direction, and Tony isn&rsquo;t sure which road he&rsquo;s indicating, but he doesn&rsquo;t care.

Apart from that hiccup, though, Tony is a good employee and Matt is satisfied.</p>[[MORE]]<p>On a dreary Thursday in February, one of the other baristas asks Matt: \u201cHave you seen the professor around, lately? I feel like it\u2019s been awhile since we\u2019ve had a queue of 20+ people- do you think he\u2019s ill?\u201d</p><p>Matt smiles. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about him, he\u2019s at a conference. He told me about it last time he was here, right before he told me off about not stirring his coffee correctly, or putting too much syrup in it. I\u2019m not sure what it was that time, but it was clear he wasn\u2019t happy.\u201d</p><p>The barista laughs. \u201cIs he ever?\u201d</p><p>Tony, who is leaning on the counter, watching the students run by, text books over their head, more concerned with protecting their haircut than the $200 the book cost them, hears the comment. \u201cWho are you talking about?\u201d he asks, intrigued.</p><p>\u201cJust this crazy customer who comes here a lot,\u201d Matt says. \u201cHe teaches something very scientific and complicated, and his order is absolutely ridiculous. You should be glad you\u2019re first month here has coincided with a four-week conference in Silicon Valley he had to go to. He\u2019s a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>Tony laughs. \u201cOh come one, he can\u2019t be that bad.\u201d</p><p>Matt rolls his eyes at the other barista, pulling off her apron now that her shift has ended. She waves at the two men behind the bar before exiting the coffee shop, the door being held open for her by a customer just about the enter the shop.</p><p>The customer enters the cafe, his eyes gliding over the neon Impresso Espresso sign behind the counter like he is disappointed still no one has realised what a horrible idea it was to put it there. Behind Tony, Matt sighs. \u201cThat\u2019ll teach me to speak of the devil. That\u2019s him, the professor. You take him, you\u2019ve never had to suffer through his demands.\u201d</p><p>Tony steps up to the register just as the man reaches the counter. He is wearing thick, black glasses that almost completely hide his grey eyes. The top button of his checkered shirt is undone, but it doesn\u2019t look on purpose, more like he just forgot there was another button before he finished dressing himself. His large, black cardigan is wrapped around his body like a blanket. He is younger than Tony expected, for a professor being invited to month-long conferences. He also doesn\u2019t look like someone who has an order complicated enough to make his colleagues this bitter (pun intended).</p><p>When the man opens his mouth to place his order, Tony expects the other employees to have pulled a prank on him, expects the man to just order a black coffee, and maybe, maybe, make a joke about the colour of his soul. Instead, he hits Tony with this beauty of a coffee order: \u201cI would like a latte, but instead of only milk, I would like half milk half hot water. The milk should be equal parts almond and coconut, with an extra dash of soy. Stir that exactly two and a half times clockwise. Then, add in a full glass of skimmed milk, that has been frothed for exactly 12.5 seconds, shake it up with ice, pour half of the drink out, and heat the other half up again, which needs to be stirred twelve times anti-clockwise at a temperature of 63 Celsius or 145.4 Fahrenheit. Take it off the heat at 98.7 Celsius or 209.67 Fahrenheit. I would like three and a quarter pumps of sugar-free vanilla syrup, seven packets of sugar, two pumps of caramel syrup, make sure to add that in after the sugar, otherwise you ruin the taste, and .4 pump of hazelnut. Then, I would like some cocoa powder, pour the coffee in with ice and shake it up again. I would also like whipped cream on top, but then please shave it off again, so there\u2019s only a little bit of whipped cream left. Pay with card, please.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s mouth falls open. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding!\u201d he exclaims. Behind him, he hears Matt snicker. The man begins to explain the importance of each individual step to the flavour of the beverage, but Tony interrupts him: \u201cThat\u2019s my order!\u201d</p><p>A smile forms on the man\u2019s face, grey eyes sparkling. \u201cFinally, someone with good taste around here,\u201d he says, giving Matt, whose jaw has slammed through the floor of the coffee shop and is currently making its way to the centre of the earth, a side eye. \u201cYou\u2019ll know the crucial timing of the stirring, then.\u201d</p><p>Tony nods. \u201cOf course, of course,\u201d he says, with a stern face, fully aware of how important these things are. One of the reasons he had decided to start working in a coffee shop was that he would finally be able to make this order perfectly for himself. He can\u2019t believe another person with a brain as small as a human\u2019s has been smart enough to realise this order is the only way coffee is anything near drinkable. \u201cName?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBruce,\u201d the man answers, and Tony hits the buttons on the register to allow the man to pay for his drink, even though he believes that thinking like that should be rewarded with a free coffee, before writing Bruce on the cup in his squiggly handwriting.</p><p>A solid twenty minutes and 27 grumbling people in line behind Bruce later, Tony presents the coffee with a flourish Shakespearean actors would be jealous of, putting a lid on the take-away cup before sliding it across the counter towards Bruce. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t need a lid,\u201d Bruce says, and pulls on the lid. However, in his enthusiasm, Tony has pressed down a bit harder than was fully necessary, and, no matter how much Bruce pulls, the lid is not giving way.</p><p>Tony snickers. \u201cWell, someone\u2019s got muscles that would give the Hulk a run for his money.\u201d</p><p>Bruce laughs, too, and pushes the cup back towards Tony. \u201cCan you do it?\u201d Tony easily takes of the lid and slides the now lidless cup to Bruce. With a smile and a nod of his head, Bruce exits the coffee shop.</p><p>Over the next week, Bruce comes back twice a day, once in the early morning, and once for a pick-me-up in the middle of the afternoon. Tony learns his schedule quickly enough, and ensures he arrives a bit too early and leaves a bit too late for his shifts, so he can be there to make Bruce\u2019s coffee. He doesn\u2019t ask for the man\u2019s name anymore, instead scribbling Hulk, No Lid on his cup, something that amuses Bruce, which is only indicated by the sparkle in his eyes when he reads it. Most of Bruce\u2019s emotions seems to be conveyed through his eyes, and Tony starts making subtle alterations to his order depending on the look in them- an extra shot of coffee if they\u2019re especially tired, some more syrup when he\u2019s looking down, and some extra milk when Bruce\u2019s eyes are dull, in replacement for Tony\u2019s wish to put his hand on his stubbled cheek and his lips against his forehead to soften the pain he sees hiding behind the grey clouds in Bruce\u2019s irises. He knows Bruce notices, when his eyes regain some of the sparkle Tony had seen that first time they had met after he takes his first sip, thanking Tony with a simple nod of the head and a half-smile, which Tony cherishes more than the few coins Bruce drops in the tip jar whenever he visits the shop.</p><p>They talk every time, sharing jabs and ideas, words and looks, until Matt has had enough of it. One particularly rainy afternoon in March, he punches Tony\u2019s arm in a way that\u2019s soft for a quarterback such as Matt, but hard for a skinny 5'9 guy like Tony, and he has to take a side step to prevent himself from falling against one of the coffee machines.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you finally gonna do something about that, man?\u201d Matt asks. Tony raises an eyebrow, innocence painted on his face. It\u2019s as much of a forgery as most of Da Vinci\u2019s paintings, though, and Matt knows it. \u201cYou kids have been flirting under my nose for over a month now,\u201d he continues, ignoring the fact that both of the men he\u2019s talking about are at least ten years older than he is. \u201cYou need to make a move, dude. Now!\u201d</p><p>Tony gestures at the window, where Bruce can be seen crossing the street to the college campus, coffee in his hand. \u201cHe\u2019s gone, Matt,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat do you want me to do? Go after him?\u201d</p><p>Matt nods enthusiastically. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what you should do! Run after him, ask him out! Don\u2019t be such a wimp!\u201d He pulls Tony\u2019s apron over his head and pushes him towards the door.</p><p>Tony struggles against Matt\u2019s indisputably superior physical strength. \u201cI never took you to be such a romantic,\u201d he says. \u201cMight harm that cool image you\u2019ve got going on.\u201d</p><p>Matt snickers. \u201cYou\u2019re not talking your way out of this one, Tony,\u201d he says, opening the door with one hand and pushing Tony through it with the other. \u201cNow, go!\u201d</p><p>With not much other choice, Tony runs across the road, waving at the sleek black car that almost hit him, driven by an extremely annoyed-looking red haired woman who seems to have half a mind to simply step on the gas and run him over. He makes it across the street in one piece though, and yells: \u201cBruce!\u201d</p><p>The other man is so shocked by someone yelling his name that he promptly drops his coffee cup. He spins around, hands risen next to his head as if showing he has no weapons. His wet hair is plastered to his forehead, and his navy blazer darkens where the rain hits him, since he isn\u2019t wearing a coat. Neither is Tony himself, he realizes, now that the rain is making his white T-shirt quickly turn see-through. \u201cIt\u2019s just me,\u201d Tony says.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Did I forget something?\u201d Bruce pets the pockets of his blazer.</p><p>Tony shakes his head. \u201cNo, I eh\u2026 I\u2026\u201d He has always been a man of words, but now, faced with a nervous, drenched professor whose coffee is spilling all over the pavement between their feet, he doesn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cCan I buy you a new coffee?\u201d he asks, hating the clenched way his voice comes out of his mouth. \u201cMaybe we could, you know, talk. Somewhere else than in there.\u201d He gestures at Impresso Espresso, where Matt is grinning broadly behind the windows. \u201cSomewhere he can\u2019t see us.\u201d</p><p>Bruce smiles, with both his eyes and his mouth, and Tony has to resist the urge to run back and high-five Matt. \u201cThat would be nice. There\u2019s a decent place just up the road.\u201d He gestures in a vague direction, and Tony isn\u2019t sure which road he\u2019s indicating, but he doesn\u2019t care. He would follow this man to a coffee shop three cities over, if he really had to.</p><p>When they walk into the shop, water forms small pools by their feet, and a single, bored barista is leaning over the counter. The neon sign behind her reads Cool Beans Coffee Bar. Bruce sighs. \u201cDo all coffee shops have those?\u201d</p><p>Tony laughs. \u201cFederal law requires it. That\u2019s top secret, though, don\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>Bruce mimes locking his lips and throwing the key away, and, grinning, the two men step up to the counter. Tony eyes the other man. \u201cThe usual?\u201d</p><p>Bruce nods. \u201cThe usual.\u201d</p>",

The man begins to explain the importance of each individual step to the flavour of the beverage, but Tony interrupts him: \u201cThat\u2019s my order!\u201d</p><p>A smile forms on the man\u2019s face, grey eyes sparkling. \u201cFinally, someone with good taste around here,\u201d he says, giving Matt, whose jaw has slammed through the floor of the coffee shop and is currently making its way to the centre of the earth, a side eye. \u201cYou\u2019ll know the crucial timing of the stirring, then.\u201d</p><p>Tony nods. \u201cOf course, of course,\u201d he says, with a stern face, fully aware of how important these things are. One of the reasons he had decided to start working in a coffee shop was that he would finally be able to make this order perfectly for himself. He can\u2019t believe another person with a brain as small as a human\u2019s has been smart enough to realise this order is the only way coffee is anything near drinkable. \u201cName?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBruce,\u201d the man answers, and Tony hits the buttons on the register to allow the man to pay for his drink, even though he believes that thinking like that should be rewarded with a free coffee, before writing Bruce on the cup in his squiggly handwriting.</p><p>A solid twenty minutes and 27 grumbling people in line behind Bruce later, Tony presents the coffee with a flourish Shakespearean actors would be jealous of, putting a lid on the take-away cup before sliding it across the counter towards Bruce. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t need a lid,\u201d Bruce says, and pulls on the lid. However, in his enthusiasm, Tony has pressed down a bit harder than was fully necessary, and, no matter how much Bruce pulls, the lid is not giving way.</p><p>Tony snickers. \u201cWell, someone\u2019s got muscles that would give the Hulk a run for his money.\u201d</p><p>Bruce laughs, too, and pushes the cup back towards Tony. \u201cCan you do it?\u201d Tony easily takes of the lid and slides the now lidless cup to Bruce. With a smile and a nod of his head, Bruce exits the coffee shop.</p><p>Over the next week, Bruce comes back twice a day, once in the early morning, and once for a pick-me-up in the middle of the afternoon. Tony learns his schedule quickly enough, and ensures he arrives a bit too early and leaves a bit too late for his shifts, so he can be there to make Bruce\u2019s coffee. He doesn\u2019t ask for the man\u2019s name anymore, instead scribbling Hulk, No Lid on his cup, something that amuses Bruce, which is only indicated by the sparkle in his eyes when he reads it. Most of Bruce\u2019s emotions seems to be conveyed through his eyes, and Tony starts making subtle alterations to his order depending on the look in them- an extra shot of coffee if they\u2019re especially tired, some more syrup when he\u2019s looking down, and some extra milk when Bruce\u2019s eyes are dull, in replacement for Tony\u2019s wish to put his hand on his stubbled cheek and his lips against his forehead to soften the pain he sees hiding behind the grey clouds in Bruce\u2019s irises. He knows Bruce notices, when his eyes regain some of the sparkle Tony had seen that first time they had met after he takes his first sip, thanking Tony with a simple nod of the head and a half-smile, which Tony cherishes more than the few coins Bruce drops in the tip jar whenever he visits the shop.</p><p>They talk every time, sharing jabs and ideas, words and looks, until Matt has had enough of it. One particularly rainy afternoon in March, he punches Tony\u2019s arm in a way that\u2019s soft for a quarterback such as Matt, but hard for a skinny 5'9 guy like Tony, and he has to take a side step to prevent himself from falling against one of the coffee machines.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you finally gonna do something about that, man?\u201d Matt asks. Tony raises an eyebrow, innocence painted on his face. It\u2019s as much of a forgery as most of Da Vinci\u2019s paintings, though, and Matt knows it. \u201cYou kids have been flirting under my nose for over a month now,\u201d he continues, ignoring the fact that both of the men he\u2019s talking about are at least ten years older than he is. \u201cYou need to make a move, dude. Now!\u201d</p><p>Tony gestures at the window, where Bruce can be seen crossing the street to the college campus, coffee in his hand. \u201cHe\u2019s gone, Matt,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat do you want me to do? Go after him?\u201d</p><p>Matt nods enthusiastically. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what you should do! Run after him, ask him out! Don\u2019t be such a wimp!\u201d He pulls Tony\u2019s apron over his head and pushes him towards the door.</p><p>Tony struggles against Matt\u2019s indisputably superior physical strength. \u201cI never took you to be such a romantic,\u201d he says. \u201cMight harm that cool image you\u2019ve got going on.\u201d</p><p>Matt snickers. \u201cYou\u2019re not talking your way out of this one, Tony,\u201d he says, opening the door with one hand and pushing Tony through it with the other. \u201cNow, go!\u201d</p><p>With not much other choice, Tony runs across the road, waving at the sleek black car that almost hit him, driven by an extremely annoyed-looking red haired woman who seems to have half a mind to simply step on the gas and run him over. He makes it across the street in one piece though, and yells: \u201cBruce!\u201d</p><p>The other man is so shocked by someone yelling his name that he promptly drops his coffee cup. He spins around, hands risen next to his head as if showing he has no weapons. His wet hair is plastered to his forehead, and his navy blazer darkens where the rain hits him, since he isn\u2019t wearing a coat. Neither is Tony himself, he realizes, now that the rain is making his white T-shirt quickly turn see-through. \u201cIt\u2019s just me,\u201d Tony says.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Did I forget something?\u201d Bruce pets the pockets of his blazer.</p><p>Tony shakes his head. \u201cNo, I eh\u2026 I\u2026\u201d He has always been a man of words, but now, faced with a nervous, drenched professor whose coffee is spilling all over the pavement between their feet, he doesn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cCan I buy you a new coffee?\u201d he asks, hating the clenched way his voice comes out of his mouth. \u201cMaybe we could, you know, talk. Somewhere else than in there.\u201d He gestures at Impresso Espresso, where Matt is grinning broadly behind the windows. \u201cSomewhere he can\u2019t see us.\u201d</p><p>Bruce smiles, with both his eyes and his mouth, and Tony has to resist the urge to run back and high-five Matt. \u201cThat would be nice. There\u2019s a decent place just up the road.\u201d He gestures in a vague direction, and Tony isn\u2019t sure which road he\u2019s indicating, but he doesn\u2019t care. He would follow this man to a coffee shop three cities over, if he really had to.</p><p>When they walk into the shop, water forms small pools by their feet, and a single, bored barista is leaning over the counter. The neon sign behind her reads Cool Beans Coffee Bar. Bruce sighs. \u201cDo all coffee shops have those?\u201d</p><p>Tony laughs. \u201cFederal law requires it. That\u2019s top secret, though, don\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>Bruce mimes locking his lips and throwing the key away, and, grinning, the two men step up to the counter. Tony eyes the other man. \u201cThe usual?\u201d</p><p>Bruce nods. \u201cThe usual.\u201d</p>",
                "content": "<p>A/N: SO, I usually don&rsquo;t post stuff like this, but the wonderful <a>@startrekkingaroundasgard</a>&#8203; had a 2K writing challenge about tropes and no one had taken the coffee shop AU yet, which I thought was a shame and a disaster, so here we go. Hope you enjoy :D</p><p>Tony had always thought he would despise working in the service industry. Given the amount everyone around him complained about it, he had expected he would be trying to commit harakiri with a milk frother within the week, since whatever Hades had in store for him would be less bad than dealing with one more person who pronounced cappuccino wrong.</p><p>And yet, now that he&rsquo;s here, he&rsquo;s enjoying himself. The coffee shop, called Impresso Espresso (insert forced laughter here), is across from a college campus, so most of his customers are caffeine-addicted students, hands shaking and eyes wide open from either too much Redbull or too much cocaine (it&rsquo;s a toss up at this age, really) and their professors, with under-eye bags so large they can put all the assignments they still have to mark in them, leaving their hands free for a carton cup with seven shots of espresso. Tony enjoys winking at all of them and trying to make them laugh, every smile a reward better than the free coffee that comes with the job.</p><p>During the classic afternoon lull, when the students are in bed and the professors in class, Tony puts the mechanics degree that put him deep in debt but didn&rsquo;t provide him with a job due to his well-meaning but obnoxious demeanour to good use by upgrading the ancient coffee machines, that were apparently purchased in the late seventies, max- or maybe modern technology just isn&rsquo;t as great as people often make it out to be.</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s manager, Matt, captain of the American football team who likes his coffee like he likes his math problems, simple, watches this thirty-something man become increasingly comfortable in a coffee shop populated mostly by those ten years younger or older than him with a mix between amazement and amusement. Besides, the coffee machines, that previously took ten minutes of gentle conversation with an increasingly impatient customer to create something as simple as a cup of tea, can now whip up a doppio in a record-holding 17.8 seconds, according to Tony. To Matt, it just feels like approximately 20 seconds, but, apparently, the exact time is of great importance to Tony, who, one night during midterms season when the coffee shop is open 24/7 to accommodate all the students pulling all-nighters, calls Matt at 3 am to announce he has shortened this time to 17.7 seconds. Apart from that hiccup, though, Tony is a good employee and Matt is satisfied.</p><p>On a dreary Thursday in February, one of the other baristas asks Matt: &ldquo;Have you seen the professor around, lately? I feel like it&rsquo;s been awhile since we&rsquo;ve had a queue of 20+ people- do you think he&rsquo;s ill?&rdquo;</p><p>Matt smiles. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about him, he&rsquo;s at a conference. He told me about it last time he was here, right before he told me off about not stirring his coffee correctly, or putting too much syrup in it. I&rsquo;m not sure what it was that time, but it was clear he wasn&rsquo;t happy.&rdquo;</p><p>The barista laughs. &ldquo;Is he ever?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony, who is leaning on the counter, watching the students run by, text books over their head, more concerned with protecting their haircut than the $200 the book cost them, hears the comment. &ldquo;Who are you talking about?&rdquo; he asks, intrigued.</p><p>&ldquo;Just this crazy customer who comes here a lot,&rdquo; Matt says. &ldquo;He teaches something very scientific and complicated, and his order is absolutely ridiculous. You should be glad you&rsquo;re first month here has coincided with a four-week conference in Silicon Valley he had to go to. He&rsquo;s a nightmare.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony laughs. &ldquo;Oh come one, he can&rsquo;t be that bad.&rdquo;</p><p>Matt rolls his eyes at the other barista, pulling off her apron now that her shift has ended. She waves at the two men behind the bar before exiting the coffee shop, the door being held open for her by a customer just about the enter the shop.</p><p>The customer enters the cafe, his eyes gliding over the neon Impresso Espresso sign behind the counter like he is disappointed still no one has realised what a horrible idea it was to put it there. Behind Tony, Matt sighs. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll teach me to speak of the devil. That&rsquo;s him, the professor. You take him, you&rsquo;ve never had to suffer through his demands.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony steps up to the register just as the man reaches the counter. He is wearing thick, black glasses that almost completely hide his grey eyes. The top button of his checkered shirt is undone, but it doesn&rsquo;t look on purpose, more like he just forgot there was another button before he finished dressing himself. His large, black cardigan is wrapped around his body like a blanket. He is younger than Tony expected, for a professor being invited to month-long conferences. He also doesn&rsquo;t look like someone who has an order complicated enough to make his colleagues this bitter (pun intended).</p><p>When the man opens his mouth to place his order, Tony expects the other employees to have pulled a prank on him, expects the man to just order a black coffee, and maybe, maybe, make a joke about the colour of his soul. Instead, he hits Tony with this beauty of a coffee order: &ldquo;I would like a latte, but instead of only milk, I would like half milk half hot water. The milk should be equal parts almond and coconut, with an extra dash of soy. Stir that exactly two and a half times clockwise. Then, add in a full glass of skimmed milk, that has been frothed for exactly 12.5 seconds, shake it up with ice, pour half of the drink out, and heat the other half up again, which needs to be stirred twelve times anti-clockwise at a temperature of 63 Celsius or 145.4 Fahrenheit. Take it off the heat at 98.7 Celsius or 209.67 Fahrenheit. I would like three and a quarter pumps of sugar-free vanilla syrup, seven packets of sugar, two pumps of caramel syrup, make sure to add that in after the sugar, otherwise you ruin the taste, and .4 pump of hazelnut. Then, I would like some cocoa powder, pour the coffee in with ice and shake it up again. I would also like whipped cream on top, but then please shave it off again, so there&rsquo;s only a little bit of whipped cream left. Pay with card, please.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s mouth falls open. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding!&rdquo; he exclaims. Behind him, he hears Matt snicker. The man begins to explain the importance of each individual step to the flavour of the beverage, but Tony interrupts him: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my order!&rdquo;</p><p>A smile forms on the man&rsquo;s face, grey eyes sparkling. &ldquo;Finally, someone with good taste around here,&rdquo; he says, giving Matt, whose jaw has slammed through the floor of the coffee shop and is currently making its way to the centre of the earth, a side eye. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know the crucial timing of the stirring, then.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony nods. &ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; he says, with a stern face, fully aware of how important these things are.

He can&rsquo;t believe another person with a brain as small as a human&rsquo;s has been smart enough to realise this order is the only way coffee is anything near drinkable. &ldquo;Name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bruce,&rdquo; the man answers, and Tony hits the buttons on the register to allow the man to pay for his drink, even though he believes that thinking like that should be rewarded with a free coffee, before writing Bruce on the cup in his squiggly handwriting.</p><p>A solid twenty minutes and 27 grumbling people in line behind Bruce later, Tony presents the coffee with a flourish Shakespearean actors would be jealous of, putting a lid on the take-away cup before sliding it across the counter towards Bruce. &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t need a lid,&rdquo; Bruce says, and pulls on the lid.
