                "content": "<p><b>Part 12</b></p><p>Rob and Y/n decided to announce their pregnancy as soon as they were able, no one thought that their baby was not his but his mother was surprised that she fell pregnant so quickly. She accepted the news before congratulating the pair at becoming parents, since their marriage Y/n and Rob had grown closer and were doing their best at making their arrangement work. They had yet to be intimate but Rob did not want to push her into something that she was not ready for.</p><p>Meanwhile Ned Stark had been escorted to Castle Black after the celebrations, it had been too hard for the family to say goodbye to their father not sure whether they would see him again. It was Lannister soldiers who led him to the wall, much to their disgust. The family that had held their father prisoner and almost taken his head, Rob wanted revenge for how his father was treated for speaking the truth. He wanted to expose the Lannisters for what they truly were, liars.</p><p>Ned was able to ride his own horse to the wall but his every move was watched by guards, he was not sure if his son Jon was aware that he was to take the black. No one would have believed that he had fallen so far, but he was attempting to expose the same secret as Jon Arryn but he was lucky and Arryn was not. He hoped that his eldest son Rob would be able to control his temper and not start a war with the Lannisters, he did not want his son&rsquo;s head on the block. With Sansa safe from Cersei and her son, rumours had circulated that Joffrey was to have a new bride but no one had been named. Since the news had been share that Joffrey may not be the true heir to the Iron Throne Stannis and Renly began to lay claim to the throne.&nbsp;</p><p>Mention of war had began around Westeros and men of the north were curious if Rob Stark would choose a side and if he would go to their aid.

GRRM has brought up how he thinks coming back from death should be a traumatic experience and the character should be affected by it. Just having Jon warging into Ghost to escape the potential consequences, doesn\u2019t seem like GRRM.</p><p>The theory\nby <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAEktKiv9TzIb_PdYpb7-Yg\" target=\"_blank\">@occupyvenus</a>, brings up the fact that while Jon will be better and far\nmore functioning than Drogo, Beric and Stoneheart, he won\u2019t be the old Jon. And definitely\nwill have more than physical scars from the experience.</p><p>After having his soul in Ghost for so long (and being\nmurdered), he will be traumatized and more beast than man. </p><p>So if that is true, than this new Jon might become very\nviolent and aggressive, a wild animal. More wolf than man. Beast!Jon.\u00a0</p><p>This brings in Sansa.</p><p>In the show Jon and Sansa are reunited after Jon is resurrected,\nit seems more than likely that will be the case for the books as well. However,\nthis time Jon will be less \u2018human.\u2019</p><p>I think in many ways Sansa will be the one to bring Jon back\nfrom that darkness, maybe not exactly heal him, but do far more than anyone else\ncan at The Wall.</p><p>We have seen that despite everything Sansa has gone through, she has still retain her kindness. We have also seen that Sansa\u2019s courtesies have an effect on people, from the Hound to Tyrion to Kevan and Lancel Lannister.\u00a0</p><p>We also have the fact that Lady was the kindest and sweetest wolf out of the pack, which might just be a reflection of Sansa\u2019s soul, but also a reflection of Sansa relationship with Lady.\u00a0</p><p>Sansa\u2019s overall gentleness can have a profound effect on people (and \u2018beasts\u2019) and I think Jon will be no different.</p><p>However, Jon won\u2019t instantly be better the second he sees\nSansa. Far from it.\u00a0</p><p>In fact, I think their first interaction will be very bad\nand potentially violent.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>First</b>, Melisandre saw Sansa coming to Jon \u2013 a girl cloaked in\ngrey on a dying horse.</p><p>Many readers and Jon himself believe that vison was of Arya,\nbut it\u2019s not. </p><p>However, Melisandre might not know that. If she tells\nBeast!Jon that his beloved sister Arya has returned to him, but it\u2019s not Arya, that\nonly spells trouble from my perspective. Especially if Beast!Jon is violent, confused\nand lost. </p><p>Or even if someone says\u00a0\u2018your sister\u2019 is here, Jon might just immediately think of Arya (maybe he even forgot Sansa).\u00a0</p><p><b>Secondly</b>, Jon has mistaken a red head for being Ygritte\nbefore. </p><p>Jon thought Melisandre was Ygritte and as soon as he sees a\nred head his mind goes straight to Ygritte. </p><p>So here we have a very beautiful red-head being mistaken by\nBeast!Jon\u2019s lost love, who might not have all his senses or control with him.</p><p>Now, while I said this interaction will be violent and bad \u2013\nI don\u2019t think it will be as bad as some of you might be thinking.</p><p>I can imagine the scene being tense and there being an overall\nelement of the threat of sexual violence, but aside from a forced kiss \u2013 I doubt\nGRRM will go any further than that.</p><p><b>Thirdly</b>, Memory is a tricky thing</p><p>Depending on how the warging + potential blood magic will affect\nJon being reborn with fire, his memory might be greatly damaged to only potentially\nscrapped. </p><p>Beric has been losing himself, piece by piece. And while Lady\nStoneheart might \u201cremember,\u201d she has also forgotten so much. </p><p>Jon not remembering Sansa seems more than likely to me.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>ON one hand, very bad for Sansa who just wants to be\nreunited with her family and be loved. This interaction might be a combination\nof Lysa trying to kill Sansa and Loras forgetting Sansa at the tourney\u2019s hand.\nSo not a great experience\u00a0 for Sansa. &ndash; Which fits with the whole aspect of Sansa thinking it would be so sweet to see Jon again (to clarify Sansa thinking it will be so sweet, makes me think, it will not &ndash; or at the very least be bittersweet).\u00a0</p><p>ON the other hand, past Jon might have never had feelings\nfor his half-sister (cousin) or even thought of it, but if this Jon\u2019s \u201cfirst\nmemory\u201d and \u201cmeeting\u201d with Sansa is her being a very pretty red-head whose\nbeing nice and kind to him and is overall very\nloving.</p><p>Poor Jon is\ngoing to be so screwed, so screwed.\u00a0</p><p>As several Jonsa posts have pointed out, Jon is not oppose to nice and pretty things, far from it.\u00a0</p><p>Many people have said that Jon would want a warrior woman, but I disagree, Jon definitely wants an ideal domestic life. And now that he\u2019s being murdered, I think Jon will want that even more.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p><strike>Now, there is this fantastic Meta post about Beauty and the\nBeast and GRRM on Tumblr that I cannot find.\u00a0</strike></p><p>Update: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkZ7BKEw-Bfu7WL04VIlt5Q\" target=\"_blank\">@timeforvvolves</a> found the Meta BATB Sansa Arc I was talking about by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mToi2Gb5I2BdvTUkmqqh-wg\" target=\"_blank\">@lady-in-a-song</a>. And you can check out her Meta Analysis here - <a href=\"https://lady-in-a-song.tumblr.com/post/173613162675/sansas-beauty-and-the-beast-arc-part-1\" target=\"_blank\">Part I</a>, <a href=\"https://lady-in-a-song.tumblr.com/post/173717552990/sansas-beauty-and-the-beast-arc-part-2-the\" target=\"_blank\">Part 2,</a> <a href=\"https://lady-in-a-song.tumblr.com/post/174917561565/sansas-beauty-and-the-beast-arc-part-3\" target=\"_blank\">Part 3.\u00a0</a></p><p>Now this analysis loosely connects to my own theory and more inspired and made me strongly consider the Beast!Jon aspect. However, you should still check out the meta anyway.\u00a0</p><p>Basically, GRRM is not exactly a fan\nof the well-known story that we all know and generally love and he prefers the\noriginal or the Cocteau\u2019s tale (definitely not Disney). As the original \n\nCocteau tale (and other adaptations) is all about consent and understanding,\nrather than a pretty lady healing an angry and violent beast.\u00a0</p><p>Which is why the Meta continues that Sandor despite the very\ncommon and popular theory, is not the Beast to Sansa\u2019s Beauty, but a foil.

GRRM has brought up how he thinks coming back from death should be a traumatic experience and the character should be affected by it. Just having Jon warging into Ghost to escape the potential consequences, doesn\u2019t seem like GRRM.</p><p>The theory\nby <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAEktKiv9TzIb_PdYpb7-Yg\" target=\"_blank\">@occupyvenus</a>, brings up the fact that while Jon will be better and far\nmore functioning than Drogo, Beric and Stoneheart, he won\u2019t be the old Jon.

More wolf than man. Beast!Jon.\u00a0</p><p>This brings in Sansa.</p><p>In the show Jon and Sansa are reunited after Jon is resurrected,\nit seems more than likely that will be the case for the books as well. However,\nthis time Jon will be less \u2018human.\u2019</p><p>I think in many ways Sansa will be the one to bring Jon back\nfrom that darkness, maybe not exactly heal him, but do far more than anyone else\ncan at The Wall.</p><p>We have seen that despite everything Sansa has gone through, she has still retain her kindness. We have also seen that Sansa\u2019s courtesies have an effect on people, from the Hound to Tyrion to Kevan and Lancel Lannister.\u00a0</p><p>We also have the fact that Lady was the kindest and sweetest wolf out of the pack, which might just be a reflection of Sansa\u2019s soul, but also a reflection of Sansa relationship with Lady.\u00a0</p><p>Sansa\u2019s overall gentleness can have a profound effect on people (and \u2018beasts\u2019) and I think Jon will be no different.</p><p>However, Jon won\u2019t instantly be better the second he sees\nSansa. Far from it.\u00a0</p><p>In fact, I think their first interaction will be very bad\nand potentially violent.</p><p><br></p><p><b>First</b>, Melisandre saw Sansa coming to Jon \u2013 a girl cloaked in\ngrey on a dying horse.</p><p>Many readers and Jon himself believe that vison was of Arya,\nbut it\u2019s not. </p><p>However, Melisandre might not know that. If she tells\nBeast!Jon that his beloved sister Arya has returned to him, but it\u2019s not Arya, that\nonly spells trouble from my perspective. Especially if Beast!Jon is violent, confused\nand lost. </p><p>Or even if someone says\u00a0\u2018your sister\u2019 is here, Jon might just immediately think of Arya (maybe he even forgot Sansa).\u00a0</p><p><b>Secondly</b>, Jon has mistaken a red head for being Ygritte\nbefore. </p><p>Jon thought Melisandre was Ygritte and as soon as he sees a\nred head his mind goes straight to Ygritte. </p><p>So here we have a very beautiful red-head being mistaken by\nBeast!Jon\u2019s lost love, who might not have all his senses or control with him.</p><p>Now, while I said this interaction will be violent and bad \u2013\nI don\u2019t think it will be as bad as some of you might be thinking.</p><p>I can imagine the scene being tense and there being an overall\nelement of the threat of sexual violence, but aside from a forced kiss \u2013 I doubt\nGRRM will go any further than that.</p><p><b>Thirdly</b>, Memory is a tricky thing</p><p>Depending on how the warging + potential blood magic will affect\nJon being reborn with fire, his memory might be greatly damaged to only potentially\nscrapped. </p><p>Beric has been losing himself, piece by piece. And while Lady\nStoneheart might \u201cremember,\u201d she has also forgotten so much. </p><p>Jon not remembering Sansa seems more than likely to me.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>ON one hand, very bad for Sansa who just wants to be\nreunited with her family and be loved.

And definitely\nwill have more than physical scars from the experience.</p><p>After having his soul in Ghost for so long (and being\nmurdered), he will be traumatized and more beast than man. </p><p>So if that is true, than this new Jon might become very\nviolent and aggressive, a wild animal. More wolf than man. Beast!Jon.&nbsp;</p><p>This brings in Sansa.</p><p>In the show Jon and Sansa are reunited after Jon is resurrected,\nit seems more than likely that will be the case for the books as well. However,\nthis time Jon will be less &lsquo;human.&rsquo;</p><p>I think in many ways Sansa will be the one to bring Jon back\nfrom that darkness, maybe not exactly heal him, but do far more than anyone else\ncan at The Wall.</p><p>We have seen that despite everything Sansa has gone through, she has still retain her kindness. We have also seen that Sansa&rsquo;s courtesies have an effect on people, from the Hound to Tyrion to Kevan and Lancel Lannister.&nbsp;</p><p>We also have the fact that Lady was the kindest and sweetest wolf out of the pack, which might just be a reflection of Sansa&rsquo;s soul, but also a reflection of Sansa relationship with Lady.&nbsp;</p><p>Sansa&rsquo;s overall gentleness can have a profound effect on people (and &lsquo;beasts&rsquo;) and I think Jon will be no different.</p><p>However, Jon won&rsquo;t instantly be better the second he sees\nSansa. Far from it.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, I think their first interaction will be very bad\nand potentially violent.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>First</b>, Melisandre saw Sansa coming to Jon &ndash; a girl cloaked in\ngrey on a dying horse.</p><p>Many readers and Jon himself believe that vison was of Arya,\nbut it&rsquo;s not. </p><p>However, Melisandre might not know that. If she tells\nBeast!Jon that his beloved sister Arya has returned to him, but it&rsquo;s not Arya, that\nonly spells trouble from my perspective. Especially if Beast!Jon is violent, confused\nand lost. </p><p>Or even if someone says&nbsp;&lsquo;your sister&rsquo; is here, Jon might just immediately think of Arya (maybe he even forgot Sansa).&nbsp;</p><p><b>Secondly</b>, Jon has mistaken a red head for being Ygritte\nbefore. </p><p>Jon thought Melisandre was Ygritte and as soon as he sees a\nred head his mind goes straight to Ygritte. </p><p>So here we have a very beautiful red-head being mistaken by\nBeast!Jon&rsquo;s lost love, who might not have all his senses or control with him.</p><p>Now, while I said this interaction will be violent and bad &ndash;\nI don&rsquo;t think it will be as bad as some of you might be thinking.</p><p>I can imagine the scene being tense and there being an overall\nelement of the threat of sexual violence, but aside from a forced kiss &ndash; I doubt\nGRRM will go any further than that.</p><p><b>Thirdly</b>, Memory is a tricky thing</p><p>Depending on how the warging + potential blood magic will affect\nJon being reborn with fire, his memory might be greatly damaged to only potentially\nscrapped. </p><p>Beric has been losing himself, piece by piece. And while Lady\nStoneheart might &ldquo;remember,&rdquo; she has also forgotten so much. </p><p>Jon not remembering Sansa seems more than likely to me.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>ON one hand, very bad for Sansa who just wants to be\nreunited with her family and be loved. This interaction might be a combination\nof Lysa trying to kill Sansa and Loras forgetting Sansa at the tourney&rsquo;s hand.\nSo not a great experience&nbsp; for Sansa. &ndash; Which fits with the whole aspect of Sansa thinking it would be so sweet to see Jon again (to clarify Sansa thinking it will be so sweet, makes me think, it will not &ndash; or at the very least be bittersweet).&nbsp;</p><p>ON the other hand, past Jon might have never had feelings\nfor his half-sister (cousin) or even thought of it, but if this Jon&rsquo;s &ldquo;first\nmemory&rdquo; and &ldquo;meeting&rdquo; with Sansa is her being a very pretty red-head whose\nbeing nice and kind to him and is overall very\nloving.</p><p>Poor Jon is\ngoing to be so screwed, so screwed.&nbsp;</p><p>As several Jonsa posts have pointed out, Jon is not oppose to nice and pretty things, far from it.&nbsp;</p><p>Many people have said that Jon would want a warrior woman, but I disagree, Jon definitely wants an ideal domestic life. And now that he&rsquo;s being murdered, I think Jon will want that even more.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><strike>Now, there is this fantastic Meta post about Beauty and the\nBeast and GRRM on Tumblr that I cannot find.&nbsp;</strike></p><p>Update: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkZ7BKEw-Bfu7WL04VIlt5Q\" target=\"_blank\">@timeforvvolves</a> found the Meta BATB Sansa Arc I was talking about by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mToi2Gb5I2BdvTUkmqqh-wg\" target=\"_blank\">@lady-in-a-song</a>. And you can check out her Meta Analysis here - <a href=\"https://lady-in-a-song.tumblr.com/post/173613162675/sansas-beauty-and-the-beast-arc-part-1\" target=\"_blank\">Part I</a>, <a href=\"https://lady-in-a-song.tumblr.com/post/173717552990/sansas-beauty-and-the-beast-arc-part-2-the\" target=\"_blank\">Part 2,</a> <a href=\"https://lady-in-a-song.tumblr.com/post/174917561565/sansas-beauty-and-the-beast-arc-part-3\" target=\"_blank\">Part 3.&nbsp;</a></p><p>Now this analysis loosely connects to my own theory and more inspired and made me strongly consider the Beast!Jon aspect. However, you should still check out the meta anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>Basically, GRRM is not exactly a fan\nof the well-known story that we all know and generally love and he prefers the\noriginal or the Cocteau&rsquo;s tale (definitely not Disney). As the original \n\nCocteau tale (and other adaptations) is all about consent and understanding,\nrather than a pretty lady healing an angry and violent beast.&nbsp;</p><p>Which is why the Meta continues that Sandor despite the very\ncommon and popular theory, is not the Beast to Sansa&rsquo;s Beauty, but a foil. The same goes for Tyrion. Their relationships are not adaptations of BATB but juxapositions for Sansa&rsquo;s real &lsquo;Beast&rsquo; to her &lsquo;Beauty.&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><i><b>Sidenote:</b></i> I imagine that Jon and Sansa&rsquo;s relationship will focus on them talking and sharing everything together, forming a genuinue bond and deep connection. And similar to Beauty in the \n\nCocteau tale, Sansa will have the power of consent in their relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, in my view (which could be wrong), GRRM doesn&rsquo;t so much\nhate the popular Beauty and the Beast tale, but rather doesn&rsquo;t see it as\nromantic as others do.</p><p>So, while I could be wrong about resurrected Jon and Sansa&rsquo;s\nreunion &ndash; GRRM might use their less than great first introduction as a potential\nparallel of BATB, but not so much as a romantic aspect, but a way to make their\nstory more dark and twisted. </p><p><br /></p><p>There are seeds for a very bad and violent first meeting already placed in the books, but also the potential growth for some very complicated and &lsquo;dark&rsquo; romantic beginnings.&nbsp;</p><p>Which to me definitely seems like it fits with GRRM bittersweet ending, while Jon and Sansa reuniting isn&rsquo;t the end to the story, I think it will be the beginning of the end.&nbsp;</p></p>",
