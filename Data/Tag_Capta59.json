After that though, you asked if you could come with her to continue protecting the Skrull from the Kree and watch over the Galaxies that the Avengers couldn\u2019t reach. </p><p>It had taken some convincing but Carol let you come and you\u2019d been inseparable since.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>You silently attended to Carol\u2019s injuries as she slept on the med table. You stripped her of her suit so she was only in her white tank top and black leggings, allowing you better access to apply medicinal cream to her skin. She\u2019d exhausted herself using her powers but she wasn\u2019t actually hurt that badly. It was mostly scrapes and bruises, only the occasional cut that might leave a scar. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWhat would you do without me?\u201d You sighed. </p><p>\u201cProbably be dead,\u201d she chuckled. </p><p>\u201cHow\u2019re you feeling?\u201d </p><p>\u201cFit as a fiddle,\u201d she tried to sit up but you pushed her back down. </p><p>\u201cAs your best friend <i>and </i>only onboard medic, I disagree.\u201d</p><p>\u201c(Y/n)-\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Carol</i>,\u201d you cut her off with a glare.

You could do <i>anything </i>in the universe but you stay on my ship, <i>why?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol,\u201d you couldn\u2019t stop the smile from taking over your face, \u201cI <i>like </i>it here. I <i>like </i>helping you. I <i>like </i>hearing your stories. I <i>like </i>watching movies with you. I like <i>being </i>with you. You make me feel special in a universe that is full of people that are far smarter and stronger than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you <i>are </i>special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot nearly as special as you.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201c&hellip; (Y/n), I, uh-\u201d Carol\u2019s face started to heat up and her eyes scanned everything but your face. </p><p>\u201c<i>Yes?</i>\u201d You leaned in closer.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to tell you that-\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Yes?</i>\u201d You leaned in even closer. <br/></p><p>\u201c<i>I</i>-\u201d She looked from your eyes to your lips. </p><p>\u201c<i>Yes?</i>\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>She suddenly rushed forward, crashing her lips into yours. You were taken by surprise but you were also entirely ready for that. You\u2019d loved Carol for so long, you\u2019d been dreaming of this moment for ages. As she leaned deeper into the kiss, you tangled your fingers in her hair; she smiled into your lips.</p><p>After what felt like an eternity, you pulled away.</p><p>\u201cSorry I need to breathe,\u201d you laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Carol smiled, \u201cyou\u2019re only human.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cUh, Carol?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stuck.\u201d You wiggled the hand that was now trapped in Carol\u2019s hair. </p><p>\u201cGuess I\u2019m overdue for a haircut, huh?\u201d She laughed as she helped you escape her hair trap.</p><p>\u201cMaybe just a little.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOkay, well,\u201d she sat up, \u201cI think I\u2019m going to take a nap before heading back out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t strain yourself too much this time please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything for you,\u201d she winked.</p><p>.</p><p>\u201cHey, uh, Carol?\u201d You stopped her before just she left the med bay.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this mean <i>Captain Marvel </i>is my girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s<i> Mar\u2019vell</i>,\u201d she rolled her eyes, \u201cbut yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Yes</i>,\u201d you pumped your fist.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201c&hellip;<i>Well</i>,\u201d she smiled. \u201cAren\u2019t you coming?\u201d She pointed down the hall with her head.</p><p>\u201c<i>Yes, ma\u2019am</i>.\u201d You jumped to your feet and ran to her side.
