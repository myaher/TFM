He can teach the next generation a couple of things or two.</p><p>Words: 729, Chapters: 1/1, Language: English</p><ul><li>Fandoms: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Iron%20Man%20(Movies)/works\" target=\"_blank\">Iron Man (Movies)</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/The%20Avengers%20(Marvel%20Movies)/works\" target=\"_blank\">The Avengers (Marvel Movies)</a></li><li>Rating: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Not%20Rated/works\" target=\"_blank\">Not Rated</a></li><li>Warnings: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/No%20Archive%20Warnings%20Apply/works\" target=\"_blank\">No Archive Warnings Apply</a></li><li>Categories: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Gen/works\" target=\"_blank\">Gen</a></li><li>Characters: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Tony%20Stark/works\" target=\"_blank\">Tony Stark</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Peter%20Parker/works\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Parker</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Morgan%20Stark%20(Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe)/works\" target=\"_blank\">Morgan Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Pepper%20Potts/works\" target=\"_blank\">Pepper Potts</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Steve%20Rogers/works\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Rogers</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Harley%20Keener/works\" target=\"_blank\">Harley Keener</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Sam%20Wilson%20(Marvel)/works\" target=\"_blank\">Sam Wilson (Marvel)</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/James%20%22Bucky%22%20Barnes/works\" target=\"_blank\">James &ldquo;Bucky&rdquo; Barnes</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Natasha%20Romanov%20(Marvel)/works\" target=\"_blank\">Natasha Romanov (Marvel)</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Bruce%20Banner/works\" target=\"_blank\">Bruce Banner</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Wanda%20Maximoff/works\" target=\"_blank\">Wanda Maximoff</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Vision%20(Marvel)/works\" target=\"_blank\">Vision (Marvel)</a></li><li>Relationships: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Peter%20Parker%20*a*%20Pepper%20Potts%20*a*%20Morgan%20Stark%20(Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe)%20*a*%20Tony%20Stark/works\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Parker &amp; Pepper Potts &amp; Morgan Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe) &amp; Tony Stark</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Tony%20Stark%20*a*%20Avengers%20Team/works\" target=\"_blank\">Tony Stark &amp; Avengers Team</a></li><li>Additional Tags: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/High%20School/works\" target=\"_blank\">High School</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Teacher%20Tony%20Stark/works\" target=\"_blank\">Teacher Tony Stark</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Student%20Peter/works\" target=\"_blank\">Student Peter</a></li></ul><br /><br />\nread it on the AO3 at <strong><a href=\"http://bit.ly/2wVe4lj\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/2wVe4lj</a></strong></p>",

SHIELD wants him as some sort of mega-weapon, the military wants him to be a super soldier again, and the public wants him to be this legendary hero that will save them from every known strife that has happened since he left. It&rsquo;s so overwhelming, he just wants to go back to 1945 where he was in love with Peggy. But now, he can&rsquo;t. Now that she&rsquo;s moved on, he had to come to terms with his troubling sexuality alone. At least that&rsquo;s what he thought, until a Welcome Back Party, is thrown in his honor by one man that was still around back in 1945.<br/>Tony Stark has emotional baggage that could weigh down a private jet. His father is horrible to him, his inventions are used from his father&rsquo;s gain, and his own best friend doesn&rsquo;t even know all of this is going on. Sometimes he just wants to end it all, instead of being the playboy billionaire his father wants him to be in public. At least all the booze and the sex allows him to get away for a while, even if he can&rsquo;t be with the one gender he&rsquo;s actually attracted to. But when he meets a certain blonde haired blue eyes Golden Boy, things might get interesting.</p><p>Words: 951, Chapters: 1/?, Language: English</p><ul><li>Fandoms: <a full_path=\"true\" class=\"tag\" href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/The%20Avengers%20(Marvel)%20-%20All%20Media%20Types/works\" target=\"_blank\">The Avengers (Marvel) - All Media Types</a></li><li>Rating: <a full_path=\"true\" class=\"tag\" href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Explicit/works\" target=\"_blank\">Explicit</a></li><li>Warnings: <a full_path=\"true\" class=\"tag\" href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/No%20Archive%20Warnings%20Apply/works\" target=\"_blank\">No Archive Warnings Apply</a></li><li>Categories: <a full_path=\"true\" class=\"tag\" href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/M*s*M/works\" target=\"_blank\">M/M</a></li><li>Characters: <a full_path=\"true\" class=\"tag\" href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Steve%20Rogers/works\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Rogers</a>, <a full_path=\"true\" class=\"tag\" href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Tony%20Stark/works\" target=\"_blank\">Tony Stark</a>, <a full_path=\"true\" class=\"tag\" href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Nick%20Fury/works\" target=\"_blank\">Nick Fury</a>, <a full_path=\"true\" class=\"tag\" href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Maria%20Hill/works\" target=\"_blank\">Maria Hill</a>, <a full_path=\"true\" class=\"tag\" href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Clint%20Barton/works\" target=\"_blank\">Clint Barton</a>, <a full_path=\"true\" class=\"tag\" href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Natasha%20Romanov%20(Marvel)/works\" target=\"_blank\">Natasha Romanov (Marvel)</a>, <a full_path=\"true\" class=\"tag\" href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Bruce%20Banner/works\" target=\"_blank\">Bruce Banner</a>, <a full_path=\"true\" class=\"tag\" href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Jarvis%20(Iron%20Man%20movies)/works\" target=\"_blank\">Jarvis (Iron Man movies)</a>, <a full_path=\"true\" class=\"tag\" href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Howard%20Stark/works\" target=\"_blank\">Howard Stark</a>, <a full_path=\"true\" class=\"tag\" href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Thor%20(Marvel)/works\" target=\"_blank\">Thor (Marvel)</a>, <a full_path=\"true\" class=\"tag\" href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/T'Challa%20(Marvel)/works\" target=\"_blank\">T'Challa (Marvel)</a>, <a full_path=\"true\" class=\"tag\" href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Shuri%20(Marvel)/works\" target=\"_blank\">Shuri (Marvel)</a>, <a full_path=\"true\" class=\"tag\" href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Peter%20Parker/works\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Parker</a>, <a full_path=\"true\" class=\"tag\" href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/SHIELD%20Agents%20*a*%20Staff/works\" target=\"_blank\">SHIELD Agents &amp;

Steve had hope when he was young, but as the years went by \nthe hope disappeared.</p><p>Enter Tony Stark.</p><p>\n\u2014\u00a0</p><p>Steve used to\ndream about meeting his soulmate. He had been sure he would some day,\nthat even someone like him \u2013 a scrawny kid from a poor home \u2013 had\nsomeone out there for them. When he laid eyes on Bucky the first time\nand instantly fell head over heels in love he thought it was real.\nThey touched, a jolt ran through his body. Then nothing. No magic\nexplosion of colours, no flight, no change in his white wings. Bucky\nlaughed at him, white wings flapping happily behind him. It must have\nbeen so obvious what Steve had been hoping.</p><p>Bucky introduced\nhim to lot of dames over the years, sometimes the occassional bloke,\nbut nothing ever happened. For every person he touched, for every\ntime his wings didn&rsquo;t change colours, he kept losing hope.</p><p>He met Peggy. It\nwas the second time he fell head over heels in love and maybe, just\nmaybe, she would be the one. She was a respectable dame, never let\nher skin touch anyone and Steve kept his distance. Then he ended up\ngetting the serum. Peggy eyed him, looked at his new muscles. She let\nher bare hand trace over his bare chest.</p><p>Nothing. Maybe\nSteve was cursed. He smiled at her, then chaos errupted around him\nand his life got too busy to even think about soulmates. When he\ncrashed into the ice he said a quiet prayer for whoever was his\nsoulmate.</p><p><i>Please, don&rsquo;t\nlet them ever feel lonely.</i></p><!-- more --><p>Steve\nopened his eyes to a completely new world. People looked different,\nsounds were different, the skyline was different, the houses\ndifferent and even smells were different. The first person that\ntouched him was a man named Phil Coulson. Coulson&rsquo;s wings were\nalready coloured, glittering in the lights of the jet they were in.\nSteve wanted to say something, didn&rsquo;t know what, and looked away\nagain. His own soulmate was probably long since dead.</p><p>He\ndidn&rsquo;t touch people after that. Took clues from Peggy \u2013 only shook\npeople&rsquo;s hands when he wore gloves, stood far enough away that they\nwouldn&rsquo;t accidentally touch each other, stuff like that. It was\neasier than he thought, people in the new world were reserved. He was\nintroduced to Natasha, to Bruce, to Thor and to Tony Stark. Only\nBruce&rsquo;s wings had colours \u2013 two shades of brown and some green \u2013\nthe rest of them had white wings just like him, except for Thor who\ndidn&rsquo;t have wings. He observed them, the way they interracted. Tony\ntouched everyone. Occassionally a pat on the shoulder, a pat on the\nback, a firm handshake. Natasha&rsquo;s touches were reserved, careful,\nplanned. Thor&rsquo;s were strong, abundant, friendly. Bruce&rsquo;s were shy,\nquick to disappear, as if he was afraid to hurt them.</p><p>Clint\njoined their group, his wings the same colours as Coulson&rsquo;s and Steve\nsmiled, nodded at him. Clint was almost as touchy as Stark, but in a\ndifferent way, a more natural way.</p><p>Once\nSteve tried to pat Tony&rsquo;s shoulder. Tony flinched, pushed his hand\naway and then patted Steve&rsquo;s shoulder instead. Steve made note of it\nbut didn&rsquo;t know how to take it.</p><p>Tony\nStark fascinated him, but their interactions left a lot of room for\nimprovement. Half of the times it ended in shouting matches, the\nother half in cold shoulders and one of them leaving the room. Tony\ntried to introduce him to the new world&rsquo;s technology, Steve turned\nright around and asked Clint instead. Steve tried to teach Tony to\ndraw, Tony turned right around and designed him a new suit to get him\nto stop.</p><p>\u201dI\ncan draw, I just draw different things than you do\u201d, he had said\nwhen he gave it to Steve.</p><p>They\nall moved into the newly renovated Avengers Tower. Thor on the upper\nfloor, then Steve, Clint, Tony, Bruce and Natasha. One floor for each\nof them. There was a communal floor between Tony and Clint where they\ncould all gather. Most nights they did, all of them except Tony who\nwas in his workshop.</p><p>Occassionally\nthey would sit in the communal floor and take care of each others&rsquo;\nwings. Thor would watch them as they worked, fascinated by the\nmidgardian tradition. Tony never joined for that and yet his wings\nwere always spotless, not a feather out of place. Clint laughed and\njoked about Tony going to professional groomers but the way Tony had\nflinched under Steve&rsquo;s touch made him doubt it.</p><p>\u201dI\ncan&rsquo;t have a soulmate\u201d, Natasha confessed to Steve one day. \u201dIt&rsquo;s\neasier to be a spy when your wings are clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201dBut\nClint and Coulson?\u201d</p><p>\u201dThey\ndon&rsquo;t use Clint for spywork any longer. He&rsquo;s still great when they\nneed an assassin.\u201d</p><p>\u201dMy\nwife hates that though. She&rsquo;d prefer if I retired.\u201d</p><p>Steve\nblinked and looked at the vent Clint&rsquo;s voice was coming from.</p><p>\u201dWife?\u201d</p><p>\u201dYeah,\nman. Coulson&rsquo;s great and all but I&rsquo;m a married man. Plus, I love\nher.\u201d</p><p>\u201dBut&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Steve\nshook his head and decided it wasn&rsquo;t his place to pry. The new world\nhad its own rules and he had tried to learn them, but when you hadn&rsquo;t\nlived them it was hard.</p><p><br/></p><p>Steve\nstarted feeling comfortable about touching his team mates after a few\nmonths. All except Tony, who now that he looked closer was equally\ncareful when touching people as Steve was. Except the occassionally\nfirm handshake of course and Steve just couldn&rsquo;t understand it. He\ncame to understand it when he was going to the workshop after a\nmission to talk with Tony.</p><p>Tony\nstripped out of the armor, stretched. Steve stopped outside and\nwatched him move. He felt a weird warmness in his chest whenever he\nwatched Tony. Tony put a t-shirt and sweatpants on over the undersuit\nhe wore for the suit. He blinked when he saw Steve outside the door,\ngestured for him to come in.</p><p>\u201dHey\u201d,\nSteve smiled. \u201dThat was&hellip; You did good during the mission.\u201d</p><p>Tony\npicked a pair of gloves up from the desk, smiled at Steve.</p><p>\u201dWell,\nwe have a pretty great leader.\u201d</p><p>He\nput the gloves on, pressed a button on them. They formed themselves\nafter his hands, their colour changing to match Tony&rsquo;s skin and Steve\nlet out a small \u201doh\u201d. Tony gestured to Steve&rsquo;s hands.</p><p>\u201dI\ncan make you a pair as well. I&rsquo;ve noticed your habit of wearing\ngloves.\u201d</p><p>\u201dIt&rsquo;s\nfine, thanks anyway.\u201d</p><p>Tony\nnodded, brought up some holograms and started making notes. Steve\ndecided not to risk another shouting match and left him alone.</p><p><br/></p><p>They\nkept working together, kept living together. They became more and\nmore of a family over the eight months they had shared lives. Tony\nwas a little outside, spending more time in the workshop then on the\ncouch with the rest of them, but he came up one afternoon when they\nhad another grooming session. Steve put the finishing touches on\nNatasha&rsquo;s wings, then patted the stool Natasha left and smiled at\nTony.</p><p>\u201dCome\non, let me do you next!\u201d</p><p>Tony\nand Clint both burst out laughing and Steve blushed.</p><p>\u201dNot&hellip;\nnot like that, come on guys.\u201d</p><p>The\nlaughter died out. Tony looked at Steve, sipped a cup of coffee. He\nshifted his weight from one foot to the other. After half a minute he\nheld up a finger, then went to the elevator.</p><p>\u201dJarvis?\u201d\nSteve asked, uncertain about what had happened.</p><p>He\ncould feel the others exchange glances as well, Jarvis stayed\nsuspiciously quiet. Then Tony returned with a bag, placed it next to\nSteve and sat down.</p><p>\u201dUse\nthose. And be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201dI\nknow how to groom.\u201d</p><p>The\nothers sat down around the room, their eyes all locked to the two.\nSteve was nervous. He opened the bag, pulled out the tools. The brush\nwas the softest he had ever held and he placed it against his cheek\njust to feel it.</p><p>\u201dImpressed?\u201d</p><p>\u201dDefinately.\nThese must have cost a fortune.\u201d</p><p>\u201dThey\ndid.\u201d</p><p>Months\nago Steve would have thought Tony was just flaunting his riches in\ntheir faces, but they had grown closer since then. He placed the\nbrush against Tony&rsquo;s wing and Tony pulled away.</p><p>\u201dTony&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201dSorry,\nsorry. Just&hellip; You need to tell me what you&rsquo;re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201dOkay\u201d,\nSteve laughed. \u201dI&rsquo;ll start brushing your left wing now, okay?\u201d</p><p>Tony\nnodded. Steve gently pulled the brush through the feathers, used his\nfingers to make sure they ended up correctly. Tony flinched again.\nThey all had their problems and Steve knew that even if he hadn&rsquo;t\nlearned what Tony&rsquo;s were yet.</p><p>\u201dI&rsquo;m\nusing my fingers as well\u201d, he said. \u201dDoes it feel okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201dMm&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Tony\nsounded relaxed and Steve continued. The others were still staring,\nClint perched on the kitchen table, Natasha in the couch leaning\nagainst the back of it, Bruce on a chair sipping on tea and Thor\nsitting on the floor next to them.</p><p>\u201dI&rsquo;m\nstretching your wing now so I can get to all the feathers.\u201d</p><p>Tony\nflinched, pulled away and fell of the stool as Steve grabbed the\nwing. It slipped out of Steve&rsquo;s hand and Steve stared at Tony.</p><p>\u201dSorry,\nshit, ow. Sorry I flinched. Don&rsquo;t&hellip; ow.\u201d</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s\nwings pulled back and Tony turned around so he was between Steve and\nthem. Steve blinked, stared at his hand and stared at Tony again. Now\nthat he thought about it he had never seen Tony fly like everyone\nelse did, he only flew in his Iron Man-suit. Was there a problem with\nhis wings?</p><p>\u201dDid\nI grip too hard? I tried being gentle.\u201d</p><p>\u201dThey&rsquo;re\njust&hellip;\u201d Tony hung his head. \u201dThey&rsquo;re very sensitive.\u201d</p><p>\u201dI&rsquo;ll\nbe more careful.\u201d</p><p>Steve\npatted the stool again. Tony hesitated, then sat up again. He\nstretched the wings himself and Steve noticed how they didn&rsquo;t quite\nreached their full lenght. He decided not to comment on it.</p><p><br/></p><p>Tony&rsquo;s\narmor broke during one of their battles. That&rsquo;s when Steve learned\nwhat was wrong with Tony&rsquo;s wings. The armor fell off him and he fell\ntowards the ground, stretched his wings to slow his descent. He\ncrashed to the ground, cursed loudly. Steve ran over to him, he was\nlying on his stomach, one of his wings was bent, bone sticking out\nand feathers ripped off and spread over the ground around them. Steve\ncrouched, placed a hand on Tony&rsquo;s shoulder. Tony hid his face in his\narms and groaned.</p><p>\u201dAgain.\nAlways the wings. Shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201dYou\nstay there, I&rsquo;ll protect you and then we&rsquo;ll get you to medical,\nokay?\u201d</p><p>Tony\nturned his head to glance at Steve, a frustrated smile on his face.</p><p>\u201dAt\nleast it wasn&rsquo;t kidnappers that destroyed it this time. Should heal\nbetter now.\u201d</p><p>Steve\nwanted to ask but it was neither the time nor place. He smiled at\nTony, warmth spreading through him when he realized Tony hadn&rsquo;t waved\nhim off, had actually agreed to let him play the knight in shining\narmor. He gripped his shield and went to work.</p><p><br/></p><p>Clint\nhad said he loved his wife even though Coulson was his soulmate.\nSteve hadn&rsquo;t understood it, but maybe soulmates wasn&rsquo;t always about\ngetting married and living happily together ever after. The world was\nfull of people after all, it should be statistically impossible to\nfind one soulmate among all of them. Steve stared at Tony over the\nbreakfast table. Tony was flipping through his tablet, working on new\narrows for Clint. They had touched each other so many times, were\nalways so close. There was no way Tony was his soulmate,\nstatistically their skin must have touched sometime during the year\nthey had worked together.</p><p>Still,\nhe was certain he was in love with Tony. Not as head over heel as he\nhad been with Bucky or Peggy. No, this love had built slower, started\nwith laying a foundation. Friendship. When did friendship turn into\nlove? Steve bit his lip, still staring at Tony. Tony&rsquo;s lips twitched\nand formed a smile but he didn&rsquo;t say anything. Steve kept poking at\nhis breakfast.</p><p>\u201dWhat\nis love?\u201d he asked his cereal, not expecting Tony to listen.</p><p>\u201dBaby\ndon&rsquo;t hurt me, don&rsquo;t hurt me, no more\u201d, Tony answered with a smile\nand Steve raised an eyebrow.</p><p>Maybe\nlove was just stupid jokes shared over the table.</p><p><br/></p><p>Tony\nused to dream about meeting his soulmate. Then Howard took that dream\nfrom him. Stark men are made from iron, they have no need for silly\nthings like soulmates. He didn&rsquo;t need a soulmate, he kept himself\nhappy with one night-stands and alcohol and stupid jokes. Kept\nhimself busy with building weapons. Then Afghanistan had happened and\nhis wings had been destroyed. After that he didn&rsquo;t even want to meet\nhis soulmate. He stopped touching people, kept more to himself. Built\nhimself a suit to be able to fly again.</p><p>Then\nhe had met Steve freaking Rogers. Captain America. Who could in no\nway at all be his soulmate. More like his soul nemesis. They argued,\nfought, argued, helped each other and shared another shouting match.\nBut with each game they played, each time they evaded each other,\nshouted at each other, praised each other, they got closer. Steve&rsquo;s\nwings were white as snow, beautiful, and sometimes Tony tried to\nimagine them with blue and brown feathers. Then he&rsquo;d blush and hurry\naway from Steve.</p><p>They\nhad worked together for eight months when Tony realized he was\ndesperately in love with Steve freaking Rogers. He hid the fact deep\nin his heart.</p><p>Steve\nwas there to help him when his wing broke during battle and Tony&rsquo;s\nwalls crumbled hard. He let the truth slip out, the truth he had\npromised to never let anyone other then Pepper and Rhodey know. Had\ntold Steve all about what happened when he was kidnapped.</p><p>They\nhad worked together for one year when he realized Steve freaking\nRogers was desperately in love with <i>him</i>.</p><p>\u201dWhat\nis love?\u201d Steve blurted out and Tony knew he wasn&rsquo;t supposed to\nreact to it but he couldn&rsquo;t help himself.</p><p>\u201dBaby\ndon&rsquo;t hurt me, don&rsquo;t hurt me, no more.\u201d</p><p>He\nsmiled, but didn&rsquo;t look at Steve. Steve finally returned to eating\nhis breakfast. Tony didn&rsquo;t need a soulmate, didn&rsquo;t need love. He had\nhis inventions, his company, his robots and his found family. But\nwhen Steve got up from the table Tony did as well. He grabbed Steve&rsquo;s\nhand. He never made those gloves for him.</p><p>\u201dSteve\u201d,\nhe whispered.</p><p>His\ncourage was gone, he fell quiet. Steve looked at him, tilted his\nhead. Warmth spread through Tony&rsquo;s body as he met Steve&rsquo;s eyes, made\nhim feel a little more couragous. There was nothing to fear. Steve\nRogers was in love with him. He was in love with Steve Rogers. He\ntook a deep breath.</p><p>\u201dI\nlove you.\u201d</p><p>Steve\ntook a shaky breath. Tony didn&rsquo;t expect an answer. He pressed the\nbutton on his gloves, pulled them off. His hands were shaking. He had\nonly ever allowed Pepper and Rhodey to touch him since then, had only\never touched them this intimately.</p><p>\u201dI\nlove you\u201d, he whispered again.</p><p>The\ngloves fell to the floor. Steve wasn&rsquo;t wearing his, he didn&rsquo;t do so\nin the tower any longer. Nothing was going to happen, there was no\nway Steve Rogers was Tony Stark&rsquo;s soulmate, and Tony grabbed Steve&rsquo;s\nhand.</p><p>The\nworld exploded in colours only for them. A jolt ran through Tony&rsquo;s\nbody, through his wings. His eyes got wet when Steve&rsquo;s white wings\nslowly turned blue and brown and he could see Steve&rsquo;s eyes getting\nequally wet. The colours around them calmed down again, returned to\nnormal. Tony was breathing heavily, hadn&rsquo;t gathered himself, when\nSteve pulled him closer, pressed his lips against Tony&rsquo;s, and they\nwere warm, perfect, soft and Tony melted even though the kiss in\nitself was lacking, panicked and greedy.</p><p>\u201dI\nthought I wouldn&rsquo;t find you\u201d, Steve breathed out as he pulled back.</p><p>\u201dI\ndidn&rsquo;t want to find you\u201d, Tony whispered, \u201dbut I&rsquo;m happy I did.\u201d</p><p>They\nshared another kiss, less panicked, softer, full of promise of a lot\nmore to come. They had both dreamed about finding their soulmates.</p><p>They\ndidn&rsquo;t need to dream any longer.</p>",

Steve had hope when he was young, but as the years went by \nthe hope disappeared.</p><p>Enter Tony Stark.</p><p>\n\u2014\u00a0</p><p>Steve used to\ndream about meeting his soulmate. He had been sure he would some day,\nthat even someone like him \u2013 a scrawny kid from a poor home \u2013 had\nsomeone out there for them. When he laid eyes on Bucky the first time\nand instantly fell head over heels in love he thought it was real.\nThey touched, a jolt ran through his body. Then nothing. No magic\nexplosion of colours, no flight, no change in his white wings. Bucky\nlaughed at him, white wings flapping happily behind him. It must have\nbeen so obvious what Steve had been hoping.</p><p>Bucky introduced\nhim to lot of dames over the years, sometimes the occassional bloke,\nbut nothing ever happened. For every person he touched, for every\ntime his wings didn\u2019t change colours, he kept losing hope.</p><p>He met Peggy. It\nwas the second time he fell head over heels in love and maybe, just\nmaybe, she would be the one. She was a respectable dame, never let\nher skin touch anyone and Steve kept his distance. Then he ended up\ngetting the serum. Peggy eyed him, looked at his new muscles. She let\nher bare hand trace over his bare chest.</p><p>Nothing. Maybe\nSteve was cursed. He smiled at her, then chaos errupted around him\nand his life got too busy to even think about soulmates. When he\ncrashed into the ice he said a quiet prayer for whoever was his\nsoulmate.</p><p><i>Please, don\u2019t\nlet them ever feel lonely.</i></p>[[MORE]]<p>Steve\nopened his eyes to a completely new world. People looked different,\nsounds were different, the skyline was different, the houses\ndifferent and even smells were different. The first person that\ntouched him was a man named Phil Coulson. Coulson\u2019s wings were\nalready coloured, glittering in the lights of the jet they were in.\nSteve wanted to say something, didn\u2019t know what, and looked away\nagain. His own soulmate was probably long since dead.</p><p>He\ndidn\u2019t touch people after that. Took clues from Peggy \u2013 only shook\npeople\u2019s hands when he wore gloves, stood far enough away that they\nwouldn\u2019t accidentally touch each other, stuff like that. It was\neasier than he thought, people in the new world were reserved. He was\nintroduced to Natasha, to Bruce, to Thor and to Tony Stark. Only\nBruce\u2019s wings had colours \u2013 two shades of brown and some green \u2013\nthe rest of them had white wings just like him, except for Thor who\ndidn\u2019t have wings. He observed them, the way they interracted. Tony\ntouched everyone. Occassionally a pat on the shoulder, a pat on the\nback, a firm handshake. Natasha\u2019s touches were reserved, careful,\nplanned. Thor\u2019s were strong, abundant, friendly. Bruce\u2019s were shy,\nquick to disappear, as if he was afraid to hurt them.</p><p>Clint\njoined their group, his wings the same colours as Coulson\u2019s and Steve\nsmiled, nodded at him. Clint was almost as touchy as Stark, but in a\ndifferent way, a more natural way.</p><p>Once\nSteve tried to pat Tony\u2019s shoulder. Tony flinched, pushed his hand\naway and then patted Steve\u2019s shoulder instead. Steve made note of it\nbut didn\u2019t know how to take it.</p><p>Tony\nStark fascinated him, but their interactions left a lot of room for\nimprovement. Half of the times it ended in shouting matches, the\nother half in cold shoulders and one of them leaving the room. Tony\ntried to introduce him to the new world\u2019s technology, Steve turned\nright around and asked Clint instead. Steve tried to teach Tony to\ndraw, Tony turned right around and designed him a new suit to get him\nto stop.</p><p>\u201dI\ncan draw, I just draw different things than you do\u201d, he had said\nwhen he gave it to Steve.</p><p>They\nall moved into the newly renovated Avengers Tower. Thor on the upper\nfloor, then Steve, Clint, Tony, Bruce and Natasha. One floor for each\nof them. There was a communal floor between Tony and Clint where they\ncould all gather. Most nights they did, all of them except Tony who\nwas in his workshop.</p><p>Occassionally\nthey would sit in the communal floor and take care of each others\u2019\nwings. Thor would watch them as they worked, fascinated by the\nmidgardian tradition. Tony never joined for that and yet his wings\nwere always spotless, not a feather out of place. Clint laughed and\njoked about Tony going to professional groomers but the way Tony had\nflinched under Steve\u2019s touch made him doubt it.</p><p>\u201dI\ncan\u2019t have a soulmate\u201d, Natasha confessed to Steve one day. \u201dIt\u2019s\neasier to be a spy when your wings are clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201dBut\nClint and Coulson?\u201d</p><p>\u201dThey\ndon\u2019t use Clint for spywork any longer. He\u2019s still great when they\nneed an assassin.\u201d</p><p>\u201dMy\nwife hates that though. She\u2019d prefer if I retired.\u201d</p><p>Steve\nblinked and looked at the vent Clint\u2019s voice was coming from.</p><p>\u201dWife?\u201d</p><p>\u201dYeah,\nman. Coulson\u2019s great and all but I\u2019m a married man. Plus, I love\nher.\u201d</p><p>\u201dBut\u2026\u201d</p><p>Steve\nshook his head and decided it wasn\u2019t his place to pry. The new world\nhad its own rules and he had tried to learn them, but when you hadn\u2019t\nlived them it was hard.</p><p><br></p><p>Steve\nstarted feeling comfortable about touching his team mates after a few\nmonths. All except Tony, who now that he looked closer was equally\ncareful when touching people as Steve was. Except the occassionally\nfirm handshake of course and Steve just couldn\u2019t understand it. He\ncame to understand it when he was going to the workshop after a\nmission to talk with Tony.</p><p>Tony\nstripped out of the armor, stretched. Steve stopped outside and\nwatched him move. He felt a weird warmness in his chest whenever he\nwatched Tony. Tony put a t-shirt and sweatpants on over the undersuit\nhe wore for the suit. He blinked when he saw Steve outside the door,\ngestured for him to come in.</p><p>\u201dHey\u201d,\nSteve smiled. \u201dThat was\u2026 You did good during the mission.\u201d</p><p>Tony\npicked a pair of gloves up from the desk, smiled at Steve.</p><p>\u201dWell,\nwe have a pretty great leader.\u201d</p><p>He\nput the gloves on, pressed a button on them. They formed themselves\nafter his hands, their colour changing to match Tony\u2019s skin and Steve\nlet out a small \u201doh\u201d. Tony gestured to Steve\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201dI\ncan make you a pair as well. I\u2019ve noticed your habit of wearing\ngloves.\u201d</p><p>\u201dIt\u2019s\nfine, thanks anyway.\u201d</p><p>Tony\nnodded, brought up some holograms and started making notes. Steve\ndecided not to risk another shouting match and left him alone.</p><p><br></p><p>They\nkept working together, kept living together. They became more and\nmore of a family over the eight months they had shared lives. Tony\nwas a little outside, spending more time in the workshop then on the\ncouch with the rest of them, but he came up one afternoon when they\nhad another grooming session. Steve put the finishing touches on\nNatasha\u2019s wings, then patted the stool Natasha left and smiled at\nTony.</p><p>\u201dCome\non, let me do you next!\u201d</p><p>Tony\nand Clint both burst out laughing and Steve blushed.</p><p>\u201dNot\u2026\nnot like that, come on guys.\u201d</p><p>The\nlaughter died out. Tony looked at Steve, sipped a cup of coffee. He\nshifted his weight from one foot to the other. After half a minute he\nheld up a finger, then went to the elevator.</p><p>\u201dJarvis?\u201d\nSteve asked, uncertain about what had happened.</p><p>He\ncould feel the others exchange glances as well, Jarvis stayed\nsuspiciously quiet. Then Tony returned with a bag, placed it next to\nSteve and sat down.</p><p>\u201dUse\nthose. And be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201dI\nknow how to groom.\u201d</p><p>The\nothers sat down around the room, their eyes all locked to the two.\nSteve was nervous. He opened the bag, pulled out the tools. The brush\nwas the softest he had ever held and he placed it against his cheek\njust to feel it.</p><p>\u201dImpressed?\u201d</p><p>\u201dDefinately.\nThese must have cost a fortune.\u201d</p><p>\u201dThey\ndid.\u201d</p><p>Months\nago Steve would have thought Tony was just flaunting his riches in\ntheir faces, but they had grown closer since then. He placed the\nbrush against Tony\u2019s wing and Tony pulled away.</p><p>\u201dTony\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201dSorry,\nsorry. Just\u2026 You need to tell me what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201dOkay\u201d,\nSteve laughed. \u201dI\u2019ll start brushing your left wing now, okay?\u201d</p><p>Tony\nnodded. Steve gently pulled the brush through the feathers, used his\nfingers to make sure they ended up correctly. Tony flinched again.\nThey all had their problems and Steve knew that even if he hadn\u2019t\nlearned what Tony\u2019s were yet.</p><p>\u201dI\u2019m\nusing my fingers as well\u201d, he said. \u201dDoes it feel okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201dMm\u2026\u201d</p><p>Tony\nsounded relaxed and Steve continued. The others were still staring,\nClint perched on the kitchen table, Natasha in the couch leaning\nagainst the back of it, Bruce on a chair sipping on tea and Thor\nsitting on the floor next to them.</p><p>\u201dI\u2019m\nstretching your wing now so I can get to all the feathers.\u201d</p><p>Tony\nflinched, pulled away and fell of the stool as Steve grabbed the\nwing. It slipped out of Steve\u2019s hand and Steve stared at Tony.</p><p>\u201dSorry,\nshit, ow. Sorry I flinched. Don\u2019t\u2026 ow.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s\nwings pulled back and Tony turned around so he was between Steve and\nthem. Steve blinked, stared at his hand and stared at Tony again. Now\nthat he thought about it he had never seen Tony fly like everyone\nelse did, he only flew in his Iron Man-suit. Was there a problem with\nhis wings?</p><p>\u201dDid\nI grip too hard? I tried being gentle.\u201d</p><p>\u201dThey\u2019re\njust\u2026\u201d Tony hung his head. \u201dThey\u2019re very sensitive.\u201d</p><p>\u201dI\u2019ll\nbe more careful.\u201d</p><p>Steve\npatted the stool again. Tony hesitated, then sat up again. He\nstretched the wings himself and Steve noticed how they didn\u2019t quite\nreached their full lenght. He decided not to comment on it.</p><p><br></p><p>Tony\u2019s\narmor broke during one of their battles. That\u2019s when Steve learned\nwhat was wrong with Tony\u2019s wings. The armor fell off him and he fell\ntowards the ground, stretched his wings to slow his descent. He\ncrashed to the ground, cursed loudly. Steve ran over to him, he was\nlying on his stomach, one of his wings was bent, bone sticking out\nand feathers ripped off and spread over the ground around them. Steve\ncrouched, placed a hand on Tony\u2019s shoulder. Tony hid his face in his\narms and groaned.</p><p>\u201dAgain.\nAlways the wings. Shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201dYou\nstay there, I\u2019ll protect you and then we\u2019ll get you to medical,\nokay?\u201d</p><p>Tony\nturned his head to glance at Steve, a frustrated smile on his face.</p><p>\u201dAt\nleast it wasn\u2019t kidnappers that destroyed it this time. Should heal\nbetter now.\u201d</p><p>Steve\nwanted to ask but it was neither the time nor place. He smiled at\nTony, warmth spreading through him when he realized Tony hadn\u2019t waved\nhim off, had actually agreed to let him play the knight in shining\narmor. He gripped his shield and went to work.</p><p><br></p><p>Clint\nhad said he loved his wife even though Coulson was his soulmate.\nSteve hadn\u2019t understood it, but maybe soulmates wasn\u2019t always about\ngetting married and living happily together ever after. The world was\nfull of people after all, it should be statistically impossible to\nfind one soulmate among all of them. Steve stared at Tony over the\nbreakfast table. Tony was flipping through his tablet, working on new\narrows for Clint. They had touched each other so many times, were\nalways so close. There was no way Tony was his soulmate,\nstatistically their skin must have touched sometime during the year\nthey had worked together.</p><p>Still,\nhe was certain he was in love with Tony. Not as head over heel as he\nhad been with Bucky or Peggy. No, this love had built slower, started\nwith laying a foundation. Friendship. When did friendship turn into\nlove? Steve bit his lip, still staring at Tony. Tony\u2019s lips twitched\nand formed a smile but he didn\u2019t say anything. Steve kept poking at\nhis breakfast.</p><p>\u201dWhat\nis love?\u201d he asked his cereal, not expecting Tony to listen.</p><p>\u201dBaby\ndon\u2019t hurt me, don\u2019t hurt me, no more\u201d, Tony answered with a smile\nand Steve raised an eyebrow.</p><p>Maybe\nlove was just stupid jokes shared over the table.</p><p><br></p><p>Tony\nused to dream about meeting his soulmate. Then Howard took that dream\nfrom him. Stark men are made from iron, they have no need for silly\nthings like soulmates. He didn\u2019t need a soulmate, he kept himself\nhappy with one night-stands and alcohol and stupid jokes. Kept\nhimself busy with building weapons. Then Afghanistan had happened and\nhis wings had been destroyed. After that he didn\u2019t even want to meet\nhis soulmate. He stopped touching people, kept more to himself. Built\nhimself a suit to be able to fly again.</p><p>Then\nhe had met Steve freaking Rogers. Captain America. Who could in no\nway at all be his soulmate. More like his soul nemesis. They argued,\nfought, argued, helped each other and shared another shouting match.\nBut with each game they played, each time they evaded each other,\nshouted at each other, praised each other, they got closer. Steve\u2019s\nwings were white as snow, beautiful, and sometimes Tony tried to\nimagine them with blue and brown feathers. Then he\u2019d blush and hurry\naway from Steve.</p><p>They\nhad worked together for eight months when Tony realized he was\ndesperately in love with Steve freaking Rogers. He hid the fact deep\nin his heart.</p><p>Steve\nwas there to help him when his wing broke during battle and Tony\u2019s\nwalls crumbled hard. He let the truth slip out, the truth he had\npromised to never let anyone other then Pepper and Rhodey know. Had\ntold Steve all about what happened when he was kidnapped.</p><p>They\nhad worked together for one year when he realized Steve freaking\nRogers was desperately in love with <i>him</i>.</p><p>\u201dWhat\nis love?\u201d Steve blurted out and Tony knew he wasn\u2019t supposed to\nreact to it but he couldn\u2019t help himself.</p><p>\u201dBaby\ndon\u2019t hurt me, don\u2019t hurt me, no more.\u201d</p><p>He\nsmiled, but didn\u2019t look at Steve. Steve finally returned to eating\nhis breakfast. Tony didn\u2019t need a soulmate, didn\u2019t need love. He had\nhis inventions, his company, his robots and his found family. But\nwhen Steve got up from the table Tony did as well. He grabbed Steve\u2019s\nhand. He never made those gloves for him.</p><p>\u201dSteve\u201d,\nhe whispered.</p><p>His\ncourage was gone, he fell quiet. Steve looked at him, tilted his\nhead. Warmth spread through Tony\u2019s body as he met Steve\u2019s eyes, made\nhim feel a little more couragous. There was nothing to fear. Steve\nRogers was in love with him. He was in love with Steve Rogers. He\ntook a deep breath.</p><p>\u201dI\nlove you.\u201d</p><p>Steve\ntook a shaky breath. Tony didn\u2019t expect an answer. He pressed the\nbutton on his gloves, pulled them off. His hands were shaking. He had\nonly ever allowed Pepper and Rhodey to touch him since then, had only\never touched them this intimately.</p><p>\u201dI\nlove you\u201d, he whispered again.</p><p>The\ngloves fell to the floor. Steve wasn\u2019t wearing his, he didn\u2019t do so\nin the tower any longer. Nothing was going to happen, there was no\nway Steve Rogers was Tony Stark\u2019s soulmate, and Tony grabbed Steve\u2019s\nhand.</p><p>The\nworld exploded in colours only for them. A jolt ran through Tony\u2019s\nbody, through his wings. His eyes got wet when Steve\u2019s white wings\nslowly turned blue and brown and he could see Steve\u2019s eyes getting\nequally wet. The colours around them calmed down again, returned to\nnormal. Tony was breathing heavily, hadn\u2019t gathered himself, when\nSteve pulled him closer, pressed his lips against Tony\u2019s, and they\nwere warm, perfect, soft and Tony melted even though the kiss in\nitself was lacking, panicked and greedy.</p><p>\u201dI\nthought I wouldn\u2019t find you\u201d, Steve breathed out as he pulled back.</p><p>\u201dI\ndidn\u2019t want to find you\u201d, Tony whispered, \u201dbut I\u2019m happy I did.\u201d</p><p>They\nshared another kiss, less panicked, softer, full of promise of a lot\nmore to come. They had both dreamed about finding their soulmates.</p><p>They\ndidn\u2019t need to dream any longer.</p>",

Steve tried to teach Tony to\ndraw, Tony turned right around and designed him a new suit to get him\nto stop.</p><p>\u201dI\ncan draw, I just draw different things than you do\u201d, he had said\nwhen he gave it to Steve.</p><p>They\nall moved into the newly renovated Avengers Tower. Thor on the upper\nfloor, then Steve, Clint, Tony, Bruce and Natasha. One floor for each\nof them. There was a communal floor between Tony and Clint where they\ncould all gather. Most nights they did, all of them except Tony who\nwas in his workshop.</p><p>Occassionally\nthey would sit in the communal floor and take care of each others\u2019\nwings. Thor would watch them as they worked, fascinated by the\nmidgardian tradition. Tony never joined for that and yet his wings\nwere always spotless, not a feather out of place. Clint laughed and\njoked about Tony going to professional groomers but the way Tony had\nflinched under Steve\u2019s touch made him doubt it.</p><p>\u201dI\ncan\u2019t have a soulmate\u201d, Natasha confessed to Steve one day. \u201dIt\u2019s\neasier to be a spy when your wings are clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201dBut\nClint and Coulson?\u201d</p><p>\u201dThey\ndon\u2019t use Clint for spywork any longer. He\u2019s still great when they\nneed an assassin.\u201d</p><p>\u201dMy\nwife hates that though. She\u2019d prefer if I retired.\u201d</p><p>Steve\nblinked and looked at the vent Clint\u2019s voice was coming from.</p><p>\u201dWife?\u201d</p><p>\u201dYeah,\nman. Coulson\u2019s great and all but I\u2019m a married man. Plus, I love\nher.\u201d</p><p>\u201dBut\u2026\u201d</p><p>Steve\nshook his head and decided it wasn\u2019t his place to pry. The new world\nhad its own rules and he had tried to learn them, but when you hadn\u2019t\nlived them it was hard.</p><p><br></p><p>Steve\nstarted feeling comfortable about touching his team mates after a few\nmonths. All except Tony, who now that he looked closer was equally\ncareful when touching people as Steve was. Except the occassionally\nfirm handshake of course and Steve just couldn\u2019t understand it. He\ncame to understand it when he was going to the workshop after a\nmission to talk with Tony.</p><p>Tony\nstripped out of the armor, stretched. Steve stopped outside and\nwatched him move. He felt a weird warmness in his chest whenever he\nwatched Tony. Tony put a t-shirt and sweatpants on over the undersuit\nhe wore for the suit. He blinked when he saw Steve outside the door,\ngestured for him to come in.</p><p>\u201dHey\u201d,\nSteve smiled. \u201dThat was\u2026 You did good during the mission.\u201d</p><p>Tony\npicked a pair of gloves up from the desk, smiled at Steve.</p><p>\u201dWell,\nwe have a pretty great leader.\u201d</p><p>He\nput the gloves on, pressed a button on them. They formed themselves\nafter his hands, their colour changing to match Tony\u2019s skin and Steve\nlet out a small \u201doh\u201d. Tony gestured to Steve\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201dI\ncan make you a pair as well. I\u2019ve noticed your habit of wearing\ngloves.\u201d</p><p>\u201dIt\u2019s\nfine, thanks anyway.\u201d</p><p>Tony\nnodded, brought up some holograms and started making notes. Steve\ndecided not to risk another shouting match and left him alone.</p><p><br></p><p>They\nkept working together, kept living together. They became more and\nmore of a family over the eight months they had shared lives. Tony\nwas a little outside, spending more time in the workshop then on the\ncouch with the rest of them, but he came up one afternoon when they\nhad another grooming session. Steve put the finishing touches on\nNatasha\u2019s wings, then patted the stool Natasha left and smiled at\nTony.</p><p>\u201dCome\non, let me do you next!\u201d</p><p>Tony\nand Clint both burst out laughing and Steve blushed.</p><p>\u201dNot\u2026\nnot like that, come on guys.\u201d</p><p>The\nlaughter died out. Tony looked at Steve, sipped a cup of coffee. He\nshifted his weight from one foot to the other. After half a minute he\nheld up a finger, then went to the elevator.</p><p>\u201dJarvis?\u201d\nSteve asked, uncertain about what had happened.</p><p>He\ncould feel the others exchange glances as well, Jarvis stayed\nsuspiciously quiet. Then Tony returned with a bag, placed it next to\nSteve and sat down.</p><p>\u201dUse\nthose. And be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201dI\nknow how to groom.\u201d</p><p>The\nothers sat down around the room, their eyes all locked to the two.\nSteve was nervous. He opened the bag, pulled out the tools. The brush\nwas the softest he had ever held and he placed it against his cheek\njust to feel it.</p><p>\u201dImpressed?\u201d</p><p>\u201dDefinately.\nThese must have cost a fortune.\u201d</p><p>\u201dThey\ndid.\u201d</p><p>Months\nago Steve would have thought Tony was just flaunting his riches in\ntheir faces, but they had grown closer since then. He placed the\nbrush against Tony\u2019s wing and Tony pulled away.</p><p>\u201dTony\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201dSorry,\nsorry. Just\u2026 You need to tell me what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201dOkay\u201d,\nSteve laughed. \u201dI\u2019ll start brushing your left wing now, okay?\u201d</p><p>Tony\nnodded. Steve gently pulled the brush through the feathers, used his\nfingers to make sure they ended up correctly. Tony flinched again.\nThey all had their problems and Steve knew that even if he hadn\u2019t\nlearned what Tony\u2019s were yet.</p><p>\u201dI\u2019m\nusing my fingers as well\u201d, he said. \u201dDoes it feel okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201dMm\u2026\u201d</p><p>Tony\nsounded relaxed and Steve continued. The others were still staring,\nClint perched on the kitchen table, Natasha in the couch leaning\nagainst the back of it, Bruce on a chair sipping on tea and Thor\nsitting on the floor next to them.</p><p>\u201dI\u2019m\nstretching your wing now so I can get to all the feathers.\u201d</p><p>Tony\nflinched, pulled away and fell of the stool as Steve grabbed the\nwing. It slipped out of Steve\u2019s hand and Steve stared at Tony.</p><p>\u201dSorry,\nshit, ow. Sorry I flinched. Don\u2019t\u2026 ow.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s\nwings pulled back and Tony turned around so he was between Steve and\nthem. Steve blinked, stared at his hand and stared at Tony again. Now\nthat he thought about it he had never seen Tony fly like everyone\nelse did, he only flew in his Iron Man-suit. Was there a problem with\nhis wings?</p><p>\u201dDid\nI grip too hard? I tried being gentle.\u201d</p><p>\u201dThey\u2019re\njust\u2026\u201d Tony hung his head. \u201dThey\u2019re very sensitive.\u201d</p><p>\u201dI\u2019ll\nbe more careful.\u201d</p><p>Steve\npatted the stool again. Tony hesitated, then sat up again. He\nstretched the wings himself and Steve noticed how they didn\u2019t quite\nreached their full lenght. He decided not to comment on it.</p><p><br></p><p>Tony\u2019s\narmor broke during one of their battles. That\u2019s when Steve learned\nwhat was wrong with Tony\u2019s wings. The armor fell off him and he fell\ntowards the ground, stretched his wings to slow his descent. He\ncrashed to the ground, cursed loudly. Steve ran over to him, he was\nlying on his stomach, one of his wings was bent, bone sticking out\nand feathers ripped off and spread over the ground around them. Steve\ncrouched, placed a hand on Tony\u2019s shoulder. Tony hid his face in his\narms and groaned.</p><p>\u201dAgain.\nAlways the wings. Shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201dYou\nstay there, I\u2019ll protect you and then we\u2019ll get you to medical,\nokay?\u201d</p><p>Tony\nturned his head to glance at Steve, a frustrated smile on his face.</p><p>\u201dAt\nleast it wasn\u2019t kidnappers that destroyed it this time. Should heal\nbetter now.\u201d</p><p>Steve\nwanted to ask but it was neither the time nor place. He smiled at\nTony, warmth spreading through him when he realized Tony hadn\u2019t waved\nhim off, had actually agreed to let him play the knight in shining\narmor. He gripped his shield and went to work.</p><p><br></p><p>Clint\nhad said he loved his wife even though Coulson was his soulmate.\nSteve hadn\u2019t understood it, but maybe soulmates wasn\u2019t always about\ngetting married and living happily together ever after. The world was\nfull of people after all, it should be statistically impossible to\nfind one soulmate among all of them. Steve stared at Tony over the\nbreakfast table. Tony was flipping through his tablet, working on new\narrows for Clint. They had touched each other so many times, were\nalways so close. There was no way Tony was his soulmate,\nstatistically their skin must have touched sometime during the year\nthey had worked together.</p><p>Still,\nhe was certain he was in love with Tony. Not as head over heel as he\nhad been with Bucky or Peggy. No, this love had built slower, started\nwith laying a foundation. Friendship. When did friendship turn into\nlove? Steve bit his lip, still staring at Tony. Tony\u2019s lips twitched\nand formed a smile but he didn\u2019t say anything. Steve kept poking at\nhis breakfast.</p><p>\u201dWhat\nis love?\u201d he asked his cereal, not expecting Tony to listen.</p><p>\u201dBaby\ndon\u2019t hurt me, don\u2019t hurt me, no more\u201d, Tony answered with a smile\nand Steve raised an eyebrow.</p><p>Maybe\nlove was just stupid jokes shared over the table.</p><p><br></p><p>Tony\nused to dream about meeting his soulmate. Then Howard took that dream\nfrom him. Stark men are made from iron, they have no need for silly\nthings like soulmates. He didn\u2019t need a soulmate, he kept himself\nhappy with one night-stands and alcohol and stupid jokes. Kept\nhimself busy with building weapons. Then Afghanistan had happened and\nhis wings had been destroyed. After that he didn\u2019t even want to meet\nhis soulmate. He stopped touching people, kept more to himself. Built\nhimself a suit to be able to fly again.</p><p>Then\nhe had met Steve freaking Rogers. Captain America. Who could in no\nway at all be his soulmate. More like his soul nemesis. They argued,\nfought, argued, helped each other and shared another shouting match.\nBut with each game they played, each time they evaded each other,\nshouted at each other, praised each other, they got closer. Steve\u2019s\nwings were white as snow, beautiful, and sometimes Tony tried to\nimagine them with blue and brown feathers. Then he\u2019d blush and hurry\naway from Steve.</p><p>They\nhad worked together for eight months when Tony realized he was\ndesperately in love with Steve freaking Rogers. He hid the fact deep\nin his heart.</p><p>Steve\nwas there to help him when his wing broke during battle and Tony\u2019s\nwalls crumbled hard. He let the truth slip out, the truth he had\npromised to never let anyone other then Pepper and Rhodey know. Had\ntold Steve all about what happened when he was kidnapped.</p><p>They\nhad worked together for one year when he realized Steve freaking\nRogers was desperately in love with <i>him</i>.</p><p>\u201dWhat\nis love?\u201d Steve blurted out and Tony knew he wasn\u2019t supposed to\nreact to it but he couldn\u2019t help himself.</p><p>\u201dBaby\ndon\u2019t hurt me, don\u2019t hurt me, no more.\u201d</p><p>He\nsmiled, but didn\u2019t look at Steve. Steve finally returned to eating\nhis breakfast. Tony didn\u2019t need a soulmate, didn\u2019t need love. He had\nhis inventions, his company, his robots and his found family. But\nwhen Steve got up from the table Tony did as well. He grabbed Steve\u2019s\nhand. He never made those gloves for him.</p><p>\u201dSteve\u201d,\nhe whispered.</p><p>His\ncourage was gone, he fell quiet. Steve looked at him, tilted his\nhead. Warmth spread through Tony\u2019s body as he met Steve\u2019s eyes, made\nhim feel a little more couragous. There was nothing to fear. Steve\nRogers was in love with him. He was in love with Steve Rogers. He\ntook a deep breath.</p><p>\u201dI\nlove you.\u201d</p><p>Steve\ntook a shaky breath. Tony didn\u2019t expect an answer. He pressed the\nbutton on his gloves, pulled them off. His hands were shaking. He had\nonly ever allowed Pepper and Rhodey to touch him since then, had only\never touched them this intimately.</p><p>\u201dI\nlove you\u201d, he whispered again.</p><p>The\ngloves fell to the floor. Steve wasn\u2019t wearing his, he didn\u2019t do so\nin the tower any longer. Nothing was going to happen, there was no\nway Steve Rogers was Tony Stark\u2019s soulmate, and Tony grabbed Steve\u2019s\nhand.</p><p>The\nworld exploded in colours only for them. A jolt ran through Tony\u2019s\nbody, through his wings. His eyes got wet when Steve\u2019s white wings\nslowly turned blue and brown and he could see Steve\u2019s eyes getting\nequally wet. The colours around them calmed down again, returned to\nnormal. Tony was breathing heavily, hadn\u2019t gathered himself, when\nSteve pulled him closer, pressed his lips against Tony\u2019s, and they\nwere warm, perfect, soft and Tony melted even though the kiss in\nitself was lacking, panicked and greedy.</p><p>\u201dI\nthought I wouldn\u2019t find you\u201d, Steve breathed out as he pulled back.</p><p>\u201dI\ndidn\u2019t want to find you\u201d, Tony whispered, \u201dbut I\u2019m happy I did.\u201d</p><p>They\nshared another kiss, less panicked, softer, full of promise of a lot\nmore to come. They had both dreamed about finding their soulmates.</p><p>They\ndidn\u2019t need to dream any longer.</p>",

Steve had hope when he was young, but as the years went by \nthe hope disappeared.</p><p>Enter Tony Stark.</p><p>\n&mdash;&nbsp;</p><p>Steve used to\ndream about meeting his soulmate. He had been sure he would some day,\nthat even someone like him &ndash; a scrawny kid from a poor home &ndash; had\nsomeone out there for them. When he laid eyes on Bucky the first time\nand instantly fell head over heels in love he thought it was real.\nThey touched, a jolt ran through his body. Then nothing. No magic\nexplosion of colours, no flight, no change in his white wings. Bucky\nlaughed at him, white wings flapping happily behind him. It must have\nbeen so obvious what Steve had been hoping.</p><p>Bucky introduced\nhim to lot of dames over the years, sometimes the occassional bloke,\nbut nothing ever happened. For every person he touched, for every\ntime his wings didn&rsquo;t change colours, he kept losing hope.</p><p>He met Peggy. It\nwas the second time he fell head over heels in love and maybe, just\nmaybe, she would be the one. She was a respectable dame, never let\nher skin touch anyone and Steve kept his distance. Then he ended up\ngetting the serum. Peggy eyed him, looked at his new muscles. She let\nher bare hand trace over his bare chest.</p><p>Nothing. Maybe\nSteve was cursed. He smiled at her, then chaos errupted around him\nand his life got too busy to even think about soulmates. When he\ncrashed into the ice he said a quiet prayer for whoever was his\nsoulmate.</p><p><i>Please, don&rsquo;t\nlet them ever feel lonely.</i></p><p>Steve\nopened his eyes to a completely new world. People looked different,\nsounds were different, the skyline was different, the houses\ndifferent and even smells were different. The first person that\ntouched him was a man named Phil Coulson. Coulson&rsquo;s wings were\nalready coloured, glittering in the lights of the jet they were in.\nSteve wanted to say something, didn&rsquo;t know what, and looked away\nagain. His own soulmate was probably long since dead.</p><p>He\ndidn&rsquo;t touch people after that. Took clues from Peggy &ndash; only shook\npeople&rsquo;s hands when he wore gloves, stood far enough away that they\nwouldn&rsquo;t accidentally touch each other, stuff like that. It was\neasier than he thought, people in the new world were reserved. He was\nintroduced to Natasha, to Bruce, to Thor and to Tony Stark. Only\nBruce&rsquo;s wings had colours &ndash; two shades of brown and some green &ndash;\nthe rest of them had white wings just like him, except for Thor who\ndidn&rsquo;t have wings. He observed them, the way they interracted. Tony\ntouched everyone. Occassionally a pat on the shoulder, a pat on the\nback, a firm handshake. Natasha&rsquo;s touches were reserved, careful,\nplanned. Thor&rsquo;s were strong, abundant, friendly. Bruce&rsquo;s were shy,\nquick to disappear, as if he was afraid to hurt them.</p><p>Clint\njoined their group, his wings the same colours as Coulson&rsquo;s and Steve\nsmiled, nodded at him. Clint was almost as touchy as Stark, but in a\ndifferent way, a more natural way.</p><p>Once\nSteve tried to pat Tony&rsquo;s shoulder. Tony flinched, pushed his hand\naway and then patted Steve&rsquo;s shoulder instead. Steve made note of it\nbut didn&rsquo;t know how to take it.</p><p>Tony\nStark fascinated him, but their interactions left a lot of room for\nimprovement. Half of the times it ended in shouting matches, the\nother half in cold shoulders and one of them leaving the room. Tony\ntried to introduce him to the new world&rsquo;s technology, Steve turned\nright around and asked Clint instead. Steve tried to teach Tony to\ndraw, Tony turned right around and designed him a new suit to get him\nto stop.</p><p>&rdquo;I\ncan draw, I just draw different things than you do&rdquo;, he had said\nwhen he gave it to Steve.</p><p>They\nall moved into the newly renovated Avengers Tower. Thor on the upper\nfloor, then Steve, Clint, Tony, Bruce and Natasha. One floor for each\nof them. There was a communal floor between Tony and Clint where they\ncould all gather.

Clint laughed and\njoked about Tony going to professional groomers but the way Tony had\nflinched under Steve&rsquo;s touch made him doubt it.</p><p>&rdquo;I\ncan&rsquo;t have a soulmate&rdquo;, Natasha confessed to Steve one day. &rdquo;It&rsquo;s\neasier to be a spy when your wings are clean.&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;But\nClint and Coulson?&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;They\ndon&rsquo;t use Clint for spywork any longer.

She&rsquo;d prefer if I retired.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve\nblinked and looked at the vent Clint&rsquo;s voice was coming from.</p><p>&rdquo;Wife?&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;Yeah,\nman. Coulson&rsquo;s great and all but I&rsquo;m a married man. Plus, I love\nher.&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;But&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Steve\nshook his head and decided it wasn&rsquo;t his place to pry. The new world\nhad its own rules and he had tried to learn them, but when you hadn&rsquo;t\nlived them it was hard.</p><p><br /></p><p>Steve\nstarted feeling comfortable about touching his team mates after a few\nmonths.

They formed themselves\nafter his hands, their colour changing to match Tony&rsquo;s skin and Steve\nlet out a small &rdquo;oh&rdquo;. Tony gestured to Steve&rsquo;s hands.</p><p>&rdquo;I\ncan make you a pair as well. I&rsquo;ve noticed your habit of wearing\ngloves.&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;It&rsquo;s\nfine, thanks anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony\nnodded, brought up some holograms and started making notes. Steve\ndecided not to risk another shouting match and left him alone.</p><p><br /></p><p>They\nkept working together, kept living together. They became more and\nmore of a family over the eight months they had shared lives.

There was no way Tony was his soulmate,\nstatistically their skin must have touched sometime during the year\nthey had worked together.</p><p>Still,\nhe was certain he was in love with Tony. Not as head over heel as he\nhad been with Bucky or Peggy. No, this love had built slower, started\nwith laying a foundation. Friendship. When did friendship turn into\nlove? Steve bit his lip, still staring at Tony. Tony&rsquo;s lips twitched\nand formed a smile but he didn&rsquo;t say anything. Steve kept poking at\nhis breakfast.</p><p>&rdquo;What\nis love?&rdquo; he asked his cereal, not expecting Tony to listen.</p><p>&rdquo;Baby\ndon&rsquo;t hurt me, don&rsquo;t hurt me, no more&rdquo;, Tony answered with a smile\nand Steve raised an eyebrow.</p><p>Maybe\nlove was just stupid jokes shared over the table.</p><p><br /></p><p>Tony\nused to dream about meeting his soulmate. Then Howard took that dream\nfrom him. Stark men are made from iron, they have no need for silly\nthings like soulmates. He didn&rsquo;t need a soulmate, he kept himself\nhappy with one night-stands and alcohol and stupid jokes. Kept\nhimself busy with building weapons. Then Afghanistan had happened and\nhis wings had been destroyed. After that he didn&rsquo;t even want to meet\nhis soulmate. He stopped touching people, kept more to himself. Built\nhimself a suit to be able to fly again.</p><p>Then\nhe had met Steve freaking Rogers. Captain America. Who could in no\nway at all be his soulmate. More like his soul nemesis. They argued,\nfought, argued, helped each other and shared another shouting match.\nBut with each game they played, each time they evaded each other,\nshouted at each other, praised each other, they got closer. Steve&rsquo;s\nwings were white as snow, beautiful, and sometimes Tony tried to\nimagine them with blue and brown feathers. Then he&rsquo;d blush and hurry\naway from Steve.</p><p>They\nhad worked together for eight months when Tony realized he was\ndesperately in love with Steve freaking Rogers. He hid the fact deep\nin his heart.</p><p>Steve\nwas there to help him when his wing broke during battle and Tony&rsquo;s\nwalls crumbled hard. He let the truth slip out, the truth he had\npromised to never let anyone other then Pepper and Rhodey know. Had\ntold Steve all about what happened when he was kidnapped.</p><p>They\nhad worked together for one year when he realized Steve freaking\nRogers was desperately in love with <i>him</i>.</p><p>&rdquo;What\nis love?&rdquo; Steve blurted out and Tony knew he wasn&rsquo;t supposed to\nreact to it but he couldn&rsquo;t help himself.</p><p>&rdquo;Baby\ndon&rsquo;t hurt me, don&rsquo;t hurt me, no more.&rdquo;</p><p>He\nsmiled, but didn&rsquo;t look at Steve. Steve finally returned to eating\nhis breakfast. Tony didn&rsquo;t need a soulmate, didn&rsquo;t need love. He had\nhis inventions, his company, his robots and his found family. But\nwhen Steve got up from the table Tony did as well. He grabbed Steve&rsquo;s\nhand. He never made those gloves for him.</p><p>&rdquo;Steve&rdquo;,\nhe whispered.</p><p>His\ncourage was gone, he fell quiet. Steve looked at him, tilted his\nhead. Warmth spread through Tony&rsquo;s body as he met Steve&rsquo;s eyes, made\nhim feel a little more couragous. There was nothing to fear. Steve\nRogers was in love with him. He was in love with Steve Rogers. He\ntook a deep breath.</p><p>&rdquo;I\nlove you.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve\ntook a shaky breath. Tony didn&rsquo;t expect an answer. He pressed the\nbutton on his gloves, pulled them off. His hands were shaking. He had\nonly ever allowed Pepper and Rhodey to touch him since then, had only\never touched them this intimately.</p><p>&rdquo;I\nlove you&rdquo;, he whispered again.</p><p>The\ngloves fell to the floor. Steve wasn&rsquo;t wearing his, he didn&rsquo;t do so\nin the tower any longer. Nothing was going to happen, there was no\nway Steve Rogers was Tony Stark&rsquo;s soulmate, and Tony grabbed Steve&rsquo;s\nhand.</p><p>The\nworld exploded in colours only for them. A jolt ran through Tony&rsquo;s\nbody, through his wings. His eyes got wet when Steve&rsquo;s white wings\nslowly turned blue and brown and he could see Steve&rsquo;s eyes getting\nequally wet. The colours around them calmed down again, returned to\nnormal. Tony was breathing heavily, hadn&rsquo;t gathered himself, when\nSteve pulled him closer, pressed his lips against Tony&rsquo;s, and they\nwere warm, perfect, soft and Tony melted even though the kiss in\nitself was lacking, panicked and greedy.</p><p>&rdquo;I\nthought I wouldn&rsquo;t find you&rdquo;, Steve breathed out as he pulled back.</p><p>&rdquo;I\ndidn&rsquo;t want to find you&rdquo;, Tony whispered, &rdquo;but I&rsquo;m happy I did.&rdquo;</p><p>They\nshared another kiss, less panicked, softer, full of promise of a lot\nmore to come. They had both dreamed about finding their soulmates.</p><p>They\ndidn&rsquo;t need to dream any longer.</p>",

Steve had hope when he was young, but as the years went by \nthe hope disappeared.</p>\n<p>Enter Tony Stark.</p>\n<p>\n&mdash;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Steve used to\ndream about meeting his soulmate. He had been sure he would some day,\nthat even someone like him &ndash; a scrawny kid from a poor home &ndash; had\nsomeone out there for them. When he laid eyes on Bucky the first time\nand instantly fell head over heels in love he thought it was real.\nThey touched, a jolt ran through his body. Then nothing. No magic\nexplosion of colours, no flight, no change in his white wings. Bucky\nlaughed at him, white wings flapping happily behind him. It must have\nbeen so obvious what Steve had been hoping.</p>\n<p>Bucky introduced\nhim to lot of dames over the years, sometimes the occassional bloke,\nbut nothing ever happened. For every person he touched, for every\ntime his wings didn&rsquo;t change colours, he kept losing hope.</p>\n<p>He met Peggy. It\nwas the second time he fell head over heels in love and maybe, just\nmaybe, she would be the one. She was a respectable dame, never let\nher skin touch anyone and Steve kept his distance. Then he ended up\ngetting the serum. Peggy eyed him, looked at his new muscles. She let\nher bare hand trace over his bare chest.</p>\n<p>Nothing. Maybe\nSteve was cursed. He smiled at her, then chaos errupted around him\nand his life got too busy to even think about soulmates. When he\ncrashed into the ice he said a quiet prayer for whoever was his\nsoulmate.</p>\n<p><i>Please, don&rsquo;t\nlet them ever feel lonely.</i></p>\n</p>",
