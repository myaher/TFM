As I\u2019ve mentioned, I\u2019m rewatching the series. I just finished watching S0608, \u201cNo One,\u201d and I kept looking for the implausibilities that everyone goes off about it and I just didn\u2019t find them. So I\u2019m gonna break this down.</p><p>In S0607 - <br/></p><p>- The Waif came up from behind and slashed Arya across her stomach. Note, Arya was wearing a jerkin (a thick material) over another shirt. So that was two items of clothing that the Waif had to slice through in a quick motion with a smallish knife. In other words, that was not a deep cut.</p><p>- Then the Waif delivered one quick jab to Arya\u2019s abdomen, enough to leave a puncture, yes, but she didn\u2019t do it in a fatal area. Then she delivered another stab into Arya\u2019s right side, this one she held the knife and twisted before pulling out. That was the worst of the wounds delivered.<br/></p><p>- Arya pulled away and jumped into the water&ndash;and hey, it was likely a cooler season considering everyone was wearing long sleeves, pants, etc. even in a warmer climate, thus meaning it was likely cooler water. She popped up next, wet and shivering, and her wounds had been cleansed with (a) possibly cool water, and (b) most likely salt water at that.</p><p>- Next we saw her hiding in the actor\u2019s backstage area. Lady Crane took her to her lodgings, further cleaned and then stitched her wounds, fed her and then gave her seed of the poppy to heal and sleep. <br/></p><p>In S0608 - <br/></p><p>- Arya woke up, having slept, rested and healed up some. She was a bit sore obviously, but after taking a few steps, she walked and stood normally, not holding her abdomen.</p><p>- The Waif had killed Lady Crane, and was coming after Arya&hellip; so adrenaline kicked in. Adrenaline is an incredible force. Mothers can literally lift a car to save their children because of adrenaline. Adrenaline can power people through illnesses, injuries, fear, etc., past all unbelievable endurance when their life or the lives of those they love is on the line. Arya\u2019s life was literally on the line, plus, she\u2019s been training non-stop for months and knows the streets like the back of her hands right now. Take all of that into account and follow all along with what came next.</p><p>- Arya jumped out of a one-story window. No biggie for someone (a) on a high-adrenaline rush, (b) has been hard-core training, &copy; used to pain on the regular at this point.\u00a0 She ran a bit, again, that adrenaline fueling and disguising any pain she might be feeling from the pull of her wounds. <br/></p><p>- She slid under the cart, rolling against the street. Would it stretch against the stitching. It might, but they made a point of how good Lady Crane was at stitching of wounds and Arya was under that cart for less than 30 seconds. Plus, if it did pull at the stitching a bit, it wouldn\u2019t have done so enough to start bleeding through yet. Anyway, after that, she was just running (again, the fuel of adrenaline, life on the line here, and training, used to the pain) and walking.</p><p>- Then Arya took that big leap, landing on the streets in a crash, rolling, rolling down that marketplace all along. How could nothing happen then? Well&hellip;. something did. She lay there for a good 5-10 seconds, breathing heavily, holding her wounds, and she started bleeding again. The stitches had come undone. She did manage to pull herself up, but she wasn\u2019t able to run anymore. She could barely stand up. Her shirt was stained with blood where the wounds were. Even adrenaline couldn\u2019t sustain her fully any longer. <br/></p><p>It wasn\u2019t until she got to her safe space, Needle, her candle, where she knew she had a chance to take on the Waif that she was able to once more find that final reserve of strength.</p><p>So somewhere tell me where there was anything more implausible in this than any other action sequence than has been normally accepted on this show&hellip; I don\u2019t know; I think the Braavos arc was just such a disappointment overall for book readers (I feel that personally, I totally do) that it became fairly easy to nitpick everything about it as it got closer to the end.<br/></p>",
