The closet door was immediately shut\nbehind you, the click of the knob almost deafening as you found yourself pressed\ninto Shouto\u2019s chest, courtesy of the shove that Kirishima had given you. \u00a0</p><p>You immediately backed up as\nmuch as you could, and luckily it wasn\u2019t exactly the smallest closet in the\nworld, so there was about a foot of distance between you and Shouto. It was\u2026unbearably\nquiet, neither of you saying a word. You were usually so good at hiding your\nemotions, but at that moment, you were struggling, the proximity to your crush\noverbearing as a nervous feeling chewed at your gut. You were grateful for the\ndarkness of the closet, feeling that it at least gave you some small amount of\nprotection from your embarrassment since Shouto couldn\u2019t see you struggling,\nbut then the heterochromatic hero decided to take out his phone. </p><p>The flashlight from Shouto\u2019s\nphone was blinding at first, but he quickly angled it away from both of you so\nit wasn\u2019t shining right in your eyes. You were pointedly less comfortable now,\nthe darkness no longer there to help you conceal your nervousness, and that\ntension was only made worse by Shouto\u2019s unbothered demeanor. It stung to know\nthat he wasn\u2019t as anxious as you were, because you assumed that could only mean\nhe didn\u2019t reciprocate your feelings in the slightest. </p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we\u2026supposed to do\nin here?\u201d</p><p>You\u2019d prefer to just wait\nthe whole seven minutes out in silence and then run off to stew in your misery\nalone, but he didn\u2019t need to know that. Part of you was surprised that he had\nnever heard of Seven Minutes in Heaven, but another part of you chimed in that\nit was Todoroki that you were talking to, so it probably would\u2019ve been more\nsurprising if he actually had heard of it. </p><p>\u201cI believe the point of the\ngame is to shove two people into a closet so they can fool around, but\nobviously that isn\u2019t a necessity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFool around as in\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s only seven\nminutes, so I doubt that anything too\u2026erotic happens. Probably just some\nkissing and whatnot.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI see\u2026Do you want me to\nkiss you?\u201d </p><p>You could certainly put that\non the list of things that you never thought Todoroki would say to you. It took\nyou off guard, and you could feel the heat starting to tinge your cheeks as you\nturned away from Shouto. It was a nice thought, but at this point, you knew\nthat having a taste of something that you would never actually have in full\nwould only lead to more heartache for you. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Todoroki. We\ndon\u2019t have to go along with this silly game, especially if you don\u2019t want.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut I want to kiss you.\u201d </p><p>The series of coughs that\nrang throughout the closet came courtesy of you, because that statement was\nenough to make you literally choke on the air that you were trying to breathe.\nIf your blush hadn\u2019t been noticeable before, it certainly was now, because your\nface felt like it was on fire. Shouto remained unperturbed as usual, or at\nleast you thought he did until you noticed the faint hint of pink trailing\nalong his own cheeks. It was hard to make out with only the light of his\nflashlight brightening the closet, but you were sure that it was real. </p><p>\u201cW-what?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2026want to kiss you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre you ser -why?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to kiss you for\na long time, Y/N, I just didn\u2019t think that you wanted to kiss me.\u201d </p><p>At any other point, you\nwould have found it odd how quickly you switched from being a ball of self-pity\nto practically throwing yourself at Shouto so you could finally kiss him, but\nhonestly, you were feeling a whirlwind of emotions at that point, and it seemed\nlike Shouto was the only person who could calm that storm. As many times as you\nhad pictured this moment, it still exceeded your expectations; Shouto\u2019s lips felt\nso amazing against yours, and the warmth that radiated from them calmed every\nnerve that had been tormenting you throughout this silly game. His hands had\nimmediately gone to your waist, his grip on you firm as he pulled your body\ncloser to his. </p><p>The first kiss didn\u2019t last\nlong, but as brief as it was, it was still perfect in your opinion. Shouto\nslowly opened his eyes, looking into your own to search for any signs of regret\nor hesitation, but when he found none of that, he quickly pulled you in for another\nkiss, this one much more hurried, his lips moving frantically against yours. It\nwas as if he was trying to make up for lost time, and you tried your best to\nkeep up with him, unable to get enough of him now that you had finally gotten a\ntaste of the lips that you had craved for so long. It was a sloppy kiss, as\nwere the ones that followed it, and at some point Shouto had slid down to the\nfloor, pulling you along with him and setting you on his lap. </p><p>The closet was getting\nunbearably hot, your need for Shouto taking on a much more carnal nature as he\nso desperately held onto you. You tried to get even closer to him, needing to\nfeel more of him, and you inadvertently brushed your pelvis down against his,\ncausing Shouto to briefly pull away from you so he could let out a groan. You\nslammed your lips back against his, empowered by his reaction, and you ground\nyour hips against him again, purposefully this time, with much more pressure\nbehind your movement. </p><p>You could feel the gasp\nhitch in Shouto\u2019s throat, and his grip on you got even tighter as he started to\nguide your movements. The party was long forgotten at that point, and it had\nobviously been well over seven minutes since you got pushed into the closet.\nFor whatever reason, no one had interrupted the two of you yet, so you were\ngoing to take the opportunity that you had been given. </p><p>Each rhythmic movement of\nyour hips sent shocks of pleasure running through Shouto\u2019s spine, and it was a\ngood thing that you were preoccupying his lips, because otherwise, he wasn\u2019t\nsure that he would\u2019ve been able to keep quiet. He had waited so long just to be\nable to touch you, so he would gladly take whatever you wanted to give him.\nYour pace steadily kept increasing as Shouto reacted more and more to what you\nwere doing to him, breathing out subtle groans against your lips, his fingers\ndigging into the flesh of your hips, his own hips trying to buck up into you\nfor more friction. </p><p>It all reached its peak soon\nenough, with Shouto letting out a drawn-out groan as he leaned into you, his\nlips stopping in their tracks and his grip finally loosening as he rode out the\nhigh that you had given him. You ran your fingers through his hair, relishing\nin the triumph that you felt for making him feel so good, but before you could\nlinger on that feeling for too long, there was a sudden shift in your\npositioning, and you found yourself staring up at the ceiling as Shouto hovered\nover you. The position was a bit awkward given the small space you that were\nin, and Shouto had to really curl in on himself to make it work, plus your legs\nwere propped up on the wall behind him, but you hardly minded it. </p><p>How could you care about your\npositioning, when Shouto looked at you with so much reverence and lust in his\neyes? To ensure that there wouldn\u2019t be any interruptions, Shouto reached up and\nfroze the doorknob. It would take a while for the ice to melt away, especially\nwithout his fire to assist it, so he was left with plenty of time to repay you\nfor your efforts\u2026</p><p>As for the party outside of\nthe closet, Mina had directed everyone to another closet, continuing on with\nthe game and giving you and Shouto some privacy. Some of the others questioned\nwhat she was doing, but she didn\u2019t pay them any mind; she was trying to play\nwingwoman for you, not them, and if they had an issue with that, then they\ncould get over it. There was another closet close by, so the party could\ncontinue without the two of you having to leave the one you were in. She didn\u2019t\nknow how long you would stay in there without anyone telling you to leave, but\nshe figured that the two of you would need a lot of time to figure things out,\nanyways. </p>",

It was a nice thought, but at this point, you knew\nthat having a taste of something that you would never actually have in full\nwould only lead to more heartache for you. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Todoroki. We\ndon\u2019t have to go along with this silly game, especially if you don\u2019t want.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut I want to kiss you.\u201d </p><p>The series of coughs that\nrang throughout the closet came courtesy of you, because that statement was\nenough to make you literally choke on the air that you were trying to breathe.\nIf your blush hadn\u2019t been noticeable before, it certainly was now, because your\nface felt like it was on fire. Shouto remained unperturbed as usual, or at\nleast you thought he did until you noticed the faint hint of pink trailing\nalong his own cheeks. It was hard to make out with only the light of his\nflashlight brightening the closet, but you were sure that it was real. </p><p>\u201cW-what?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2026want to kiss you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre you ser -why?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to kiss you for\na long time, Y/N, I just didn\u2019t think that you wanted to kiss me.\u201d </p><p>At any other point, you\nwould have found it odd how quickly you switched from being a ball of self-pity\nto practically throwing yourself at Shouto so you could finally kiss him, but\nhonestly, you were feeling a whirlwind of emotions at that point, and it seemed\nlike Shouto was the only person who could calm that storm. As many times as you\nhad pictured this moment, it still exceeded your expectations; Shouto\u2019s lips felt\nso amazing against yours, and the warmth that radiated from them calmed every\nnerve that had been tormenting you throughout this silly game. His hands had\nimmediately gone to your waist, his grip on you firm as he pulled your body\ncloser to his. </p><p>The first kiss didn\u2019t last\nlong, but as brief as it was, it was still perfect in your opinion. Shouto\nslowly opened his eyes, looking into your own to search for any signs of regret\nor hesitation, but when he found none of that, he quickly pulled you in for another\nkiss, this one much more hurried, his lips moving frantically against yours. It\nwas as if he was trying to make up for lost time, and you tried your best to\nkeep up with him, unable to get enough of him now that you had finally gotten a\ntaste of the lips that you had craved for so long. It was a sloppy kiss, as\nwere the ones that followed it, and at some point Shouto had slid down to the\nfloor, pulling you along with him and setting you on his lap. </p><p>The closet was getting\nunbearably hot, your need for Shouto taking on a much more carnal nature as he\nso desperately held onto you. You tried to get even closer to him, needing to\nfeel more of him, and you inadvertently brushed your pelvis down against his,\ncausing Shouto to briefly pull away from you so he could let out a groan. You\nslammed your lips back against his, empowered by his reaction, and you ground\nyour hips against him again, purposefully this time, with much more pressure\nbehind your movement. </p><p>You could feel the gasp\nhitch in Shouto\u2019s throat, and his grip on you got even tighter as he started to\nguide your movements. The party was long forgotten at that point, and it had\nobviously been well over seven minutes since you got pushed into the closet.\nFor whatever reason, no one had interrupted the two of you yet, so you were\ngoing to take the opportunity that you had been given. </p><p>Each rhythmic movement of\nyour hips sent shocks of pleasure running through Shouto\u2019s spine, and it was a\ngood thing that you were preoccupying his lips, because otherwise, he wasn\u2019t\nsure that he would\u2019ve been able to keep quiet. He had waited so long just to be\nable to touch you, so he would gladly take whatever you wanted to give him.\nYour pace steadily kept increasing as Shouto reacted more and more to what you\nwere doing to him, breathing out subtle groans against your lips, his fingers\ndigging into the flesh of your hips, his own hips trying to buck up into you\nfor more friction. </p><p>It all reached its peak soon\nenough, with Shouto letting out a drawn-out groan as he leaned into you, his\nlips stopping in their tracks and his grip finally loosening as he rode out the\nhigh that you had given him. You ran your fingers through his hair, relishing\nin the triumph that you felt for making him feel so good, but before you could\nlinger on that feeling for too long, there was a sudden shift in your\npositioning, and you found yourself staring up at the ceiling as Shouto hovered\nover you. The position was a bit awkward given the small space you that were\nin, and Shouto had to really curl in on himself to make it work, plus your legs\nwere propped up on the wall behind him, but you hardly minded it. </p><p>How could you care about your\npositioning, when Shouto looked at you with so much reverence and lust in his\neyes? To ensure that there wouldn\u2019t be any interruptions, Shouto reached up and\nfroze the doorknob. It would take a while for the ice to melt away, especially\nwithout his fire to assist it, so he was left with plenty of time to repay you\nfor your efforts\u2026</p><p>As for the party outside of\nthe closet, Mina had directed everyone to another closet, continuing on with\nthe game and giving you and Shouto some privacy. Some of the others questioned\nwhat she was doing, but she didn\u2019t pay them any mind; she was trying to play\nwingwoman for you, not them, and if they had an issue with that, then they\ncould get over it. There was another closet close by, so the party could\ncontinue without the two of you having to leave the one you were in. She didn\u2019t\nknow how long you would stay in there without anyone telling you to leave, but\nshe figured that the two of you would need a lot of time to figure things out,\nanyways. </p>",

She was unfazed by\nyour apparent ire, the broad grin on her face unyielding as she pointed towards\nthe nearest closet. </p><p>\u201cYou know the rules, Y/N!\nOff you go.\u201d </p><p>You thought about just\nwalking away, not only from the game, but from the party in its entirety, but\nyou were distracted from that plan by some scuffling behind you. Looking back,\nyou saw Shouto being shoved into the closet by Kirishima, and before you could\nhave any sort of reaction to that, you found yourself being pushed forward,\nonly to be betrayed by the same redhead. The closet door was immediately shut\nbehind you, the click of the knob almost deafening as you found yourself pressed\ninto Shouto\u2019s chest, courtesy of the shove that Kirishima had given you. \u00a0</p><p>You immediately backed up as\nmuch as you could, and luckily it wasn\u2019t exactly the smallest closet in the\nworld, so there was about a foot of distance between you and Shouto. It was\u2026unbearably\nquiet, neither of you saying a word. You were usually so good at hiding your\nemotions, but at that moment, you were struggling, the proximity to your crush\noverbearing as a nervous feeling chewed at your gut. You were grateful for the\ndarkness of the closet, feeling that it at least gave you some small amount of\nprotection from your embarrassment since Shouto couldn\u2019t see you struggling,\nbut then the heterochromatic hero decided to take out his phone. </p><p>The flashlight from Shouto\u2019s\nphone was blinding at first, but he quickly angled it away from both of you so\nit wasn\u2019t shining right in your eyes. You were pointedly less comfortable now,\nthe darkness no longer there to help you conceal your nervousness, and that\ntension was only made worse by Shouto\u2019s unbothered demeanor. It stung to know\nthat he wasn\u2019t as anxious as you were, because you assumed that could only mean\nhe didn\u2019t reciprocate your feelings in the slightest. </p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we\u2026supposed to do\nin here?\u201d</p><p>You\u2019d prefer to just wait\nthe whole seven minutes out in silence and then run off to stew in your misery\nalone, but he didn\u2019t need to know that. Part of you was surprised that he had\nnever heard of Seven Minutes in Heaven, but another part of you chimed in that\nit was Todoroki that you were talking to, so it probably would\u2019ve been more\nsurprising if he actually had heard of it. </p><p>\u201cI believe the point of the\ngame is to shove two people into a closet so they can fool around, but\nobviously that isn\u2019t a necessity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFool around as in\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s only seven\nminutes, so I doubt that anything too\u2026erotic happens.

It would take a while for the ice to melt away, especially\nwithout his fire to assist it, so he was left with plenty of time to repay you\nfor your efforts&hellip;</p><p>As for the party outside of\nthe closet, Mina had directed everyone to another closet, continuing on with\nthe game and giving you and Shouto some privacy. Some of the others questioned\nwhat she was doing, but she didn&rsquo;t pay them any mind; she was trying to play\nwingwoman for you, not them, and if they had an issue with that, then they\ncould get over it. There was another closet close by, so the party could\ncontinue without the two of you having to leave the one you were in. She didn&rsquo;t\nknow how long you would stay in there without anyone telling you to leave, but\nshe figured that the two of you would need a lot of time to figure things out,\nanyways. </p>",
