There\u2019s hardly any fluff here but if you wait, you shall see. (is that vague enough?) I wrote this in a few hours so dont judge me xxxx</i></p></blockquote><p>Lily Evans has not been living her dream. Neither her vision of what constituted a dream and what not. For starters, she still lived with her friend, Marlene and she was reminded of this fact every weekend at night. And there\u2019s the issue with her job. Life would like to say it bit her in the ass when she found out she was working for Severus Snape- the creep who stalked her when they were children. She had taken the job, still because money? In this economy was a rarity.</p><p>Life had kicked and laughed at her but she raised a finger- it was her favorite one-, dusted her skirt and strode away. You could say, she was holding life by the balls when she took matters into her own hands.</p><p>After her parents died, she had spent hours wondering what to do with the money they left for her.</p><p>Petunia had shown up for the funeral and sniffed when she caught sight of Lily\u2019s clothing or rather lack of mourning clothes.</p><p>\u201cA shame, Lily. What would our parents say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think-\u201c \u00a0Lily bit out, furious that even the matter of mourning was a competition to her sister. \u201c-that they would be rather happy that I haven\u2019t got a stick in my ass.\u201d</p><p>True to her nature, Petunia had balked at her in disgust and swept away, adamant not to be seen involved with her freak of a sister.</p><p>She could almost hear the hearty laugh of her father. And suddenly, she knew what she had to do.</p><p>So here she was, dressed in a lousy blouse and tight jeans, in a hall where the auditions for a French play\u2019s cast were being held. Only the residue of courage lingered in her as the prospect of what she was about to face wore her. She fans her face- why was it so bloody hot?</p><p>\u201cJenna Mackenly.\u201d</p><p>The name sends another jolt to her and she shuts her eyes so she doesn\u2019t have to see her clammed up hands and her shivering legs.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>Jumping, she takes a glance at the man next to her and immediately freezes. Sure, its bloody dark and she can barely see him but to the gods, if he wasn\u2019t fit as hell. Brown eyes blinked at her and his jaw- one that could <i>melt</i> hafnium ( sue her, she\u2019s a nerd)- tilts. \u00a0He\u2019s holding a plate of French fries and offers them to her which she declines.</p><p>\u201cYou nervous?\u201d</p><p>She nods.</p><p>He takes her silence in stride. Perhaps, he\u2019s used to girls fawning over him and being <i>shitting </i>messes. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry much. Just look at that- <i>he points to a light behind him</i>- and sing. The judges are a bunch of cranky wankers-\u201c She huffs a laugh here because they indeed were; Several of them looked almost bored as the poor girl sang shrilly- \u201cso don\u2019t bother looking at them, yeah?\u201d</p><p>The advice takes a moment to settle in but once it does, she murmurs out a soft thank you.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d His eyes lit up and their close proximity enables her to see the flecks of gold swimming in them. \u201cShe speaks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is Lily Evans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he is James Potter. Not the judge, I meant me. Ugh, I am <i>so</i> not cool.\u201d</p><p>She lets out a giggle. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. I\u2019m used to boys being stuttering messes around me.\u201d</p><p>Laughter erupts from him and the girl on stage pauses briefly before continuing. \u201cSays the girl who was in awe of me just a few seconds ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me if I didn\u2019t know what to say to a stranger.\u201d</p><p>He smiles like a wolf. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not a stranger anymore, am I?\u201d</p><p>And then, like the wanker he is, he shifts as if he knows she going to gulp when she sees his muscles flex. Chuckling, he deems that the act of teasing her would not go well in his favor and asks, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>She cocks an eyebrow at him. \u201cI\u2019m going to sing.\u201d</p><p>A blush stains his cheek. \u201cI know that. I meant, why are you here?\u201d</p><p>Despite the flow of ridiculous questions, she says, \u201cI always wanted to be a singer. There\u2019s something beautiful about the way you can control your voice and direct it to flow, you know? Music, it\u2019s a piece of art that goes in the ears and straight to your heart, clanging through your blood as it does so. Everyone\u2019s born with a song and ahh, it\u2019s a channel to release your anxiety.\u201d</p><p>He hums. \u201cHave you thought of becoming a writer too?\u201d</p><p>Again, he offers her the plate. She picks one fry and chews it. \u201cDid you know French fries have actually no French origin?\u201d</p><p>Surprised, she says, \u201cI do.\u201d And like the sap she is, she blushes. Quickly getting back on topic: \u201cI work for a magazine, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEchos.\u201d</p><p>James immediately recoils. \u201cYou work for Snape?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUghhh. And here, I thought you were a decent bird.\u201d</p><p>She should have rebuked him. She really should have. That\u2019s what a decent employee would do but she hated Snape as much, if not more than he did. It&rsquo;s not unexpected that the public detests Snape. When Severus was a journalist, several protests were his doing as his articles were usually along the lines of \u2018NO place for immigrants.\u2019 \u2018The possibilities if the blacks are once again oppressed.\u2019 It hurt Lily\u2019s conscience that she had to work for a man like him but her bank account needed it.</p><p>Lily shoves him by the shoulder. \u201cOh shut up. Not all of us are rich, Mr. Posh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Posh?\u201d He barks a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s a new one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShush. It\u2019s because of that perfume you\u2019re wearing.\u201d She remarks, rather reluctantly. His odor was rather intoxicating. It was a mixture of ink and cookies but she interrupted when she saw his mouth form an arrogant grin. \u201cWhat do you work as?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cLily Evans.\u201d</i></p><p>Fudge.</p><p>James pushes her a little. \u201cYou can do this.\u201d</p><p>She can do it. She was Lily Evans according to her birth certificate, not Quitter Evans so, hands sweating alongside wobbly knees, she glided through the silence and assumed her position on stage.</p><p>\u201cWhat song are you going to sing for us?\u2019</p><p>\u201cGreek Tragedy by the Wombats.\u201d</p><p>One of the judges blinked at her and yawned. \u201cWell, go ahead.\u201d</p><p>Wanker.</p><p><i>Stand tall, her mother used to say. Chest open, head back, relax and let your voice flow.</i></p><p>So she sang. The stumbling croak soon dissolved into what she hoped was the lull of a nightingale. She closed her eyes when the judges started talking to one another. She kept singing, reminded herself of a time when Petunia and her ran down to breakfast as soon as the scent of maple danced in the air. She thought of the time when she had didn\u2019t give a damn about money and did things because she liked it. And she lingered on James, the man she\u2019d just met who gave her the confidence to find her voice.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flew open and she stumbled a little.</p><p>\u201cThat was great.\u201d</p><p>Snapping her head towards the familiar voice, her jaw almost drops.</p><p>Of course, of bloody course, James had to be a judge. Internally groaning, she mutters out <i>thanks</i><i> </i>and stalks off stage.</p><p>He catches up with her when she\u2019s about to leave.</p><p>\u201cAlright, Evans?\u201d</p><p>She offers him a reproachful eye. \u201cI suppose it was too difficult to tell me you were a judge.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cIs that what got your knickers in a twist?\u201d</p><p>Scowling, she flushes. \u201cPeople probably think I was trying to&hellip;..seduce you.\u201d</p><p>A beat of silence and then he doubles over laughing. In the light, she can fully appreciate his features. He\u2019s better than fit. Too damn tall but his wavy and messy jet black hair make up for it. And, he\u2019s wearing a <i>carry on</i> shirt. The universe hates her, she\u2019s sure.</p><p>\u201cSeduce?\u201d He chokes out, finally.</p><p>Waving a hand to brush the matter away, she says as a matter of fact, \u201cWe all know I&rsquo;m irresistible.\u201d</p><p>Fondness coats his features. \u201cThat you are. I doubt you\u2019d like to go out on a date with me, now?\u201d</p><p>Cursing whoever bothered to add logic in her vessel, she declines the offer halfheartedly.<br/></p><p>James takes the rejection in stride. Kissing her palm, he purrs, \u201cUntil next time?\u201d</p><p>He smirks as she nods faintly.</p><blockquote><p><i><b>LilyEvans to MarlMc</b>: bring ice cream. </i></p><p><i><b>MarlMc</b>: bring it urself</i></p><p><i><b>LilyEvans</b>: not fair. I just rejected a hot guy.</i></p><p><i><b>MarlMc</b>: strawberry or vanilla?</i></p><p><i><b>LilyEvans</b>: chocolate.</i></p><p><i><b>MarlMc</b>: that\u2019s not an option</i></p><p><i>Also youre a dolt.</i></p><p><i><b>LilyEvans</b>: it is now.</i></p><p><i>I know.</i></p></blockquote><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>Marlene does not bring chocolate ice cream.</p><p>It truly is a sin but nonetheless, a sad Lily needs her ice cream so she sticks her spoon in the salted caramel ice cream. (\u201cIt\u2019s a new flavor,\u201d Marlene explained.) (\u201cI was going to get a new flavor.\u201d) (\u201cStop objectifying the bloke, you sap.\u201d) (\u201cI am not, you cynic.\u201d)</p><p>They share ice cream that night and the following one. Marlene calling Lily a dolt after each spoon.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to get in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sang like a crow, Marls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll still get in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won&rsquo;t. And I don\u2019t care, either.\u201d</p><p>Marlene made a hmph sound but if the outcome was a failure, Lily wasn\u2019t going to wallow in her misery. She had learned something as she poured her heart out on that stage. Sometimes, you\u2019ve gotta do things for fun even if you suck at it. Keep trying until you can proudly say, \u201cI lowkey don\u2019t suck.\u00a0</p><p>Someday, she\u2019d sing in front of people who wanted to listen to her instead of three old men and one fit bloke. Someday.</p><p>And when the call came a few days later and some ass said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t make the cut, sweetheart\u201d and hung up, she was stung but she shrugged it off and posted a cover of her song on youtube.</p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><blockquote><p><i><b>LilyEvans to MarlMc</b>: im going out</i></p><p><i><b>MarlMc</b>: u???</i></p><p><i>On a weekend?</i></p><p><i>Instead of reading??</i></p><p><i>Who are you??</i></p><p><i><b>LilyEvans</b>: shut up</i></p><p><i>I have a boy to find</i></p><p><i>who\u2019s a cute nerd</i></p><p><i><b>MarlMc</b>: ashkashdihsndlksa</i></p></blockquote><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She held the plate of fries in her hand, silently asking herself what the frick she was doing.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she entered the auditorium and looked around. Unlike last time, it was James that made her uneasy and not the stifling heat. His mop of hair was not to be found in the seats and the realization brought a pang to her chest.</p><p>\u201cLooking for me?\u201d</p><p>Spinning around, she\u2019s faced with a very <i>very</i> close James. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cJames.\u201d She breathes.</p><p>\u201cLily.\u201d He responds, quirking an eyebrow. \u201cSorry that you didn\u2019t get the part.\u201d</p><p>She swallows. \u201cIt&rsquo;s okay. I got you\u00a0some ah, fries.\u201d</p><p>He takes the plate from her and inspects the chips, thoughtfully. So much for romantic gestures.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat-\u201c</p><p>\u201cWanna go out with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. You have my number?\u201d</p><p>A frown tugs at her lips. \u201cWait, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have my number?\u201d He repeats, rather slowly, grinning at her confusion.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying yes?\u201d</p><p>He mocks a sigh. \u201cNot a bright one, are you Lily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?

I meant, why are you here?\u201d</p><p>Despite the flow of ridiculous questions, she says, \u201cI always wanted to be a singer. There\u2019s something beautiful about the way you can control your voice and direct it to flow, you know? Music, it\u2019s a piece of art that goes in the ears and straight to your heart, clanging through your blood as it does so. Everyone\u2019s born with a song and ahh, it\u2019s a channel to release your anxiety.\u201d</p><p>He hums. \u201cHave you thought of becoming a writer too?\u201d</p><p>Again, he offers her the plate.

And here, I thought you were a decent bird.\u201d</p><p>She should have rebuked him. She really should have. That\u2019s what a decent employee would do but she hated Snape as much, if not more than he did. It\u2019s not unexpected that the public detests Snape. When Severus was a journalist, several protests were his doing as his articles were usually along the lines of \u2018NO place for immigrants.\u2019 \u2018The possibilities if the blacks are once again oppressed.\u2019 It hurt Lily\u2019s conscience that she had to work for a man like him but her bank account needed it.</p><p>Lily shoves him by the shoulder. \u201cOh shut up.

It\u2019s because of that perfume you\u2019re wearing.\u201d She remarks, rather reluctantly. His odor was rather intoxicating. It was a mixture of ink and cookies but she interrupted when she saw his mouth form an arrogant grin. \u201cWhat do you work as?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cLily Evans.\u201d</i></p><p>Fudge.</p><p>James pushes her a little. \u201cYou can do this.\u201d</p><p>She can do it. She was Lily Evans according to her birth certificate, not Quitter Evans so, hands sweating alongside wobbly knees, she glided through the silence and assumed her position on stage.</p><p>\u201cWhat song are you going to sing for us?\u2019</p><p>\u201cGreek Tragedy by the Wombats.\u201d</p><p>One of the judges blinked at her and yawned. \u201cWell, go ahead.\u201d</p><p>Wanker.</p><p><i>Stand tall, her mother used to say. Chest open, head back, relax and let your voice flow.</i></p><p>So she sang. The stumbling croak soon dissolved into what she hoped was the lull of a nightingale. She closed her eyes when the judges started talking to one another. She kept singing, reminded herself of a time when Petunia and her ran down to breakfast as soon as the scent of maple danced in the air. She thought of the time when she had didn\u2019t give a damn about money and did things because she liked it. And she lingered on James, the man she\u2019d just met who gave her the confidence to find her voice.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flew open and she stumbled a little.</p><p>\u201cThat was great.\u201d</p><p>Snapping her head towards the familiar voice, her jaw almost drops.</p><p>Of course, of bloody course, James had to be a judge. Internally groaning, she mutters out <i>thanks</i><i> </i>and stalks off stage.</p><p>He catches up with her when she\u2019s about to leave.</p><p>\u201cAlright, Evans?\u201d</p><p>She offers him a reproachful eye. \u201cI suppose it was too difficult to tell me you were a judge.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cIs that what got your knickers in a twist?\u201d</p><p>Scowling, she flushes. \u201cPeople probably think I was trying to\u2026..seduce you.\u201d</p><p>A beat of silence and then he doubles over laughing. In the light, she can fully appreciate his features. He\u2019s better than fit. Too damn tall but his wavy and messy jet black hair make up for it. And, he\u2019s wearing a <i>carry on</i> shirt. The universe hates her, she\u2019s sure.</p><p>\u201cSeduce?\u201d He chokes out, finally.</p><p>Waving a hand to brush the matter away, she says as a matter of fact, \u201cWe all know I\u2019m irresistible.\u201d</p><p>Fondness coats his features. \u201cThat you are. I doubt you\u2019d like to go out on a date with me, now?\u201d</p><p>Cursing whoever bothered to add logic in her vessel, she declines the offer halfheartedly.<br></p><p>James takes the rejection in stride. Kissing her palm, he purrs, \u201cUntil next time?\u201d</p><p>He smirks as she nods faintly.</p><blockquote><p><i><b>LilyEvans to MarlMc</b>: bring ice cream. </i></p><p><i><b>MarlMc</b>: bring it urself</i></p><p><i><b>LilyEvans</b>: not fair. I just rejected a hot guy.</i></p><p><i><b>MarlMc</b>: strawberry or vanilla?</i></p><p><i><b>LilyEvans</b>: chocolate.</i></p><p><i><b>MarlMc</b>: that\u2019s not an option</i></p><p><i>Also youre a dolt.</i></p><p><i><b>LilyEvans</b>: it is now.</i></p><p><i>I know.</i></p></blockquote><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>Marlene does not bring chocolate ice cream.</p><p>It truly is a sin but nonetheless, a sad Lily needs her ice cream so she sticks her spoon in the salted caramel ice cream. (\u201cIt\u2019s a new flavor,\u201d Marlene explained.) (\u201cI was going to get a new flavor.\u201d) (\u201cStop objectifying the bloke, you sap.\u201d) (\u201cI am not, you cynic.\u201d)</p><p>They share ice cream that night and the following one. Marlene calling Lily a dolt after each spoon.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to get in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sang like a crow, Marls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll still get in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. And I don\u2019t care, either.\u201d</p><p>Marlene made a hmph sound but if the outcome was a failure, Lily wasn\u2019t going to wallow in her misery. She had learned something as she poured her heart out on that stage. Sometimes, you\u2019ve gotta do things for fun even if you suck at it. Keep trying until you can proudly say, \u201cI lowkey don\u2019t suck.\u00a0</p><p>Someday, she\u2019d sing in front of people who wanted to listen to her instead of three old men and one fit bloke. Someday.</p><p>And when the call came a few days later and some ass said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t make the cut, sweetheart\u201d and hung up, she was stung but she shrugged it off and posted a cover of her song on youtube.</p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><blockquote><p><i><b>LilyEvans to MarlMc</b>: im going out</i></p><p><i><b>MarlMc</b>: u???</i></p><p><i>On a weekend?</i></p><p><i>Instead of reading??</i></p><p><i>Who are you??</i></p><p><i><b>LilyEvans</b>: shut up</i></p><p><i>I have a boy to find</i></p><p><i>who\u2019s a cute nerd</i></p><p><i><b>MarlMc</b>: ashkashdihsndlksa</i></p></blockquote><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She held the plate of fries in her hand, silently asking herself what the frick she was doing.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she entered the auditorium and looked around. Unlike last time, it was James that made her uneasy and not the stifling heat. His mop of hair was not to be found in the seats and the realization brought a pang to her chest.</p><p>\u201cLooking for me?\u201d</p><p>Spinning around, she\u2019s faced with a very <i>very</i> close James. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cJames.\u201d She breathes.</p><p>\u201cLily.\u201d He responds, quirking an eyebrow. \u201cSorry that you didn\u2019t get the part.\u201d</p><p>She swallows. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I got you\u00a0some ah, fries.\u201d</p><p>He takes the plate from her and inspects the chips, thoughtfully. So much for romantic gestures.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat-\u201c</p><p>\u201cWanna go out with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. You have my number?\u201d</p><p>A frown tugs at her lips. \u201cWait, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have my number?\u201d He repeats, rather slowly, grinning at her confusion.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying yes?\u201d</p><p>He mocks a sigh. \u201cNot a bright one, are you Lily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019ll have you know I got a degree in politics and-\u201c</p><p>\u00a0Laughing, he gently pulls her outside and scribbles his number on her arm, his touch sending goosebumps through her blood.</p><p>\u201cCall me?\u201d \u00a0He imitates a phone and she lets out a laugh</p><p>Brimming with euphoria, she says, \u201cI\u2019ll do more if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>And then, <i>he</i> kisses <i>her</i>.</p><hr><p>Maybe the universe didn\u2019t hate her after all, She\u2019ll think months later as she rubs her belly and replies to comments on her youtube channel.\u00a0</p><p style=\"\">\u201cHey, Lils?\u201d<br></p><p style=\"\">\u201cYeah?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThey increased Snivellus\u2019s jail time.\u201d<br></p><p>Its bad of her to laugh but she still does.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDid you call the guy to fix the bed?\u201d<br></p><p>Her boyfriend huffs and kisses her on the cheek.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll do it myself.

I wrote this in a few hours so dont judge me xxxx</i></p></blockquote><p>Lily Evans has not been living her dream. Neither her vision of what constituted a dream and what not. For starters, she still lived with her friend, Marlene and she was reminded of this fact every weekend at night. And there&rsquo;s the issue with her job. Life would like to say it bit her in the ass when she found out she was working for Severus Snape- the creep who stalked her when they were children. She had taken the job, still because money? In this economy was a rarity.</p><p>Life had kicked and laughed at her but she raised a finger- it was her favorite one-, dusted her skirt and strode away. You could say, she was holding life by the balls when she took matters into her own hands.</p><p>After her parents died, she had spent hours wondering what to do with the money they left for her.</p><p>Petunia had shown up for the funeral and sniffed when she caught sight of Lily&rsquo;s clothing or rather lack of mourning clothes.</p><p>&ldquo;A shame, Lily. What would our parents say?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think-&ldquo; &nbsp;Lily bit out, furious that even the matter of mourning was a competition to her sister. &ldquo;-that they would be rather happy that I haven&rsquo;t got a stick in my ass.&rdquo;</p><p>True to her nature, Petunia had balked at her in disgust and swept away, adamant not to be seen involved with her freak of a sister.</p><p>She could almost hear the hearty laugh of her father. And suddenly, she knew what she had to do.</p><p>So here she was, dressed in a lousy blouse and tight jeans, in a hall where the auditions for a French play&rsquo;s cast were being held. Only the residue of courage lingered in her as the prospect of what she was about to face wore her. She fans her face- why was it so bloody hot?</p><p>&ldquo;Jenna Mackenly.&rdquo;</p><p>The name sends another jolt to her and she shuts her eyes so she doesn&rsquo;t have to see her clammed up hands and her shivering legs.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo;</p><p>Jumping, she takes a glance at the man next to her and immediately freezes. Sure, its bloody dark and she can barely see him but to the gods, if he wasn&rsquo;t fit as hell. Brown eyes blinked at her and his jaw- one that could <i>melt</i> hafnium ( sue her, she&rsquo;s a nerd)- tilts. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s holding a plate of French fries and offers them to her which she declines.</p><p>&ldquo;You nervous?&rdquo;</p><p>She nods.</p><p>He takes her silence in stride. Perhaps, he&rsquo;s used to girls fawning over him and being <i>shitting </i>messes. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to worry much. Just look at that- <i>he points to a light behind him</i>- and sing. The judges are a bunch of cranky wankers-&ldquo; She huffs a laugh here because they indeed were; Several of them looked almost bored as the poor girl sang shrilly- &ldquo;so don&rsquo;t bother looking at them, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>The advice takes a moment to settle in but once it does, she murmurs out a soft thank you.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo; His eyes lit up and their close proximity enables her to see the flecks of gold swimming in them. &ldquo;She speaks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She is Lily Evans.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And he is James Potter. Not the judge, I meant me. Ugh, I am <i>so</i> not cool.&rdquo;</p><p>She lets out a giggle. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright. I&rsquo;m used to boys being stuttering messes around me.&rdquo;</p><p>Laughter erupts from him and the girl on stage pauses briefly before continuing. &ldquo;Says the girl who was in awe of me just a few seconds ago.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me if I didn&rsquo;t know what to say to a stranger.&rdquo;</p><p>He smiles like a wolf. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not a stranger anymore, am I?&rdquo;</p><p>And then, like the wanker he is, he shifts as if he knows she going to gulp when she sees his muscles flex. Chuckling, he deems that the act of teasing her would not go well in his favor and asks, &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p><p>She cocks an eyebrow at him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to sing.&rdquo;</p><p>A blush stains his cheek. &ldquo;I know that. I meant, why are you here?&rdquo;</p><p>Despite the flow of ridiculous questions, she says, &ldquo;I always wanted to be a singer. There&rsquo;s something beautiful about the way you can control your voice and direct it to flow, you know? Music, it&rsquo;s a piece of art that goes in the ears and straight to your heart, clanging through your blood as it does so. Everyone&rsquo;s born with a song and ahh, it&rsquo;s a channel to release your anxiety.&rdquo;</p><p>He hums. &ldquo;Have you thought of becoming a writer too?&rdquo;</p><p>Again, he offers her the plate. She picks one fry and chews it. &ldquo;Did you know French fries have actually no French origin?&rdquo;</p><p>Surprised, she says, &ldquo;I do.&rdquo; And like the sap she is, she blushes. Quickly getting back on topic: &ldquo;I work for a magazine, actually.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which one?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Echos.&rdquo;</p><p>James immediately recoils. &ldquo;You work for Snape?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ughhh. And here, I thought you were a decent bird.&rdquo;</p><p>She should have rebuked him. She really should have. That&rsquo;s what a decent employee would do but she hated Snape as much, if not more than he did. It&rsquo;s not unexpected that the public detests Snape. When Severus was a journalist, several protests were his doing as his articles were usually along the lines of &lsquo;NO place for immigrants.&rsquo; &lsquo;The possibilities if the blacks are once again oppressed.&rsquo; It hurt Lily&rsquo;s conscience that she had to work for a man like him but her bank account needed it.</p><p>Lily shoves him by the shoulder. &ldquo;Oh shut up. Not all of us are rich, Mr. Posh.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Posh?&rdquo; He barks a laugh. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a new one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shush. It&rsquo;s because of that perfume you&rsquo;re wearing.&rdquo; She remarks, rather reluctantly. His odor was rather intoxicating. It was a mixture of ink and cookies but she interrupted when she saw his mouth form an arrogant grin. &ldquo;What do you work as?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Lily Evans.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Fudge.</p><p>James pushes her a little. &ldquo;You can do this.&rdquo;</p><p>She can do it.

He wore plain black dress robes and the brown eyes beneath short brown hair met  Peter&rsquo;s.  </p><p>&ldquo;Hell Mr. Pettigrew.&rdquo; The man said in a vice neither quiet nor loud and squatted down to come face to face with the dark wizard.  &ldquo;You are about to die, nothing can change this.  I have plucked you from that moment to ask you a question, no matter the answer your life shall come to an end.  Peter would have begged, pled as he had a thousand times before, but something in the man&rsquo;s eyes or voixe told him that what he said was the unalterable truth, and so instead just nodded.</p><p>\"Good, now tell me, if you could would you trade these years, the rat, servant?  Would you trade them for your friends?  Endured the tortures and met your end at the dark Lord&rsquo;s hand?&rdquo;. Peter thought and looked down it seemed he was doing just that now and for the first time in a very long time he felt the fear melt away and a smile that only James, Sirius and Remus would have recognized split his fat face.</p><p>&ldquo;knowing what I know now?&rdquo; The curious man nodded &ldquo;In a rats heart beat&rdquo; pride in his voice.  The man smiled and nodded. </p><p>&ldquo;Rest well wormtail.&rdquo; The man was gone and time began again, even as the light of the world faded from him mister wormtail leaned back against the wall, and met his end with more dignity than he knew he deserved.</p></p>",
