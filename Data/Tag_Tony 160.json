        "body": "<p>More about Stark\u2019s and Banner\u2019s relationship, this takes place after the memorial service for Tony\u2019s parents after the car crash. Again, I\u2019m messing about with time. Tony is 17 when his parents die in this verse, and Banner is in his twenties. Essentially, this is Tony recalling a bit of his and Banner\u2019s history for Stephen.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cTony, sorry I\u2019m late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBruce.\u201d Tony\u2019s eyes are hard, but as brightly intelligent as they always have been in the past. Bruce offers his hand, and is surprised as Tony hugs him tightly, then lets him go. \u201cSorry. Just couldn\u2019t sit in there any more, listening to people who had no clue - even Peggy - and she knew him. She knew what he was like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe. He - Tony, you know it was -\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, a different time, he was different. Sure. Probably still an ass, even back then. I had to get it from somewhere, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna go back to the homestead, have a drink? I\u2019m not sitting through another three hours of memories of a father I don\u2019t recognize, no one is talking about my mom, all anyone wants to talk about is the \u2018great Howard Stark\u2019.\u201d Bruce gives him a look and puts out his hand. Tony rolls his eyes at him, but drops a set of keys into his hand and allows Bruce to take him by the elbow and walk him over to his car.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHow old are you now, kid?\u201d Bruce asks quietly as he pours them each a double.</p><p>\u201cJust turned\u2026 hmmm\u2026 seventeen. Yeah\u2026 seventeen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do with your life?\u201d</p><p>Tony tosses back half his drink and leans forward as he puts the cut crystal tumbler down carefully on a coaster. \u201cMom and her coasters, she had a fucking cabinet just for her coasters\u2026 what do I want to do? I do know what I don\u2019t want to do, what I don\u2019t want to be. I don\u2019t want spend the next twenty, thirty years building new ways to blow up the world, I don\u2019t want to be the heir apparent to all this. But I don\u2019t have a choice, it\u2019s who I am, Bruce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony. You don\u2019t have to be your dad.\u201d</p><p>Tony snorts at him and picks up his drink again. \u201cRight. And who should I be, then, Mr\u2026 no, Dr. what is it now, three PhDs, now, right? And what are you working on now? Wait, don\u2019t tell me -\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorking on my fourth and I\u2019m working on something big. I haven\u2019t told anyone. But last year I finally found Erskine\u2019s notebooks.\u201d</p><p>Tony shakes his head and finishes his drink, then stares at his friend for a long moment, before getting up to pour himself another drink. \u201cThose were buried. For a reason. Bruce. Even my dad wouldn\u2019t touch that and he loved Cap. At least he was capable of loving someone. Just not me. No. He loved you too. He did. Not only did I have to compete with Cap\u2019n America himself, and he was dead for over twenty-five years before I was even born, then there was you. Sorry, didn\u2019t plan to go there, today, or ever. Bruce. I know, if anyone could do it, redo the work, and actually get it right, it would be you, but the risks involved, the ethics. C\u2019mon, Bruce, they had a reason back then, at least they thought it was a good enough reason, and maybe - maybe it was, maybe without Captain America we wouldn\u2019t have won the war, but Erskine never shared the complete solution with anyone, the notebooks are only a path to what he came up with. You know, just because you can do something, doesn\u2019t mean you should. Didn\u2019t you learn anything from Howard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, I just want to see if I can do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBruce. You know the history better than anyone - night after night, you couldn\u2019t get enough of the stories about the \u2018good ol\u2019 days\u2019, but you know what it cost him. If he hadn\u2019t died in the car crash - the drinking alone -\u201d Tony glares at the glass in his hand and puts it down. \u201cI know I\u2019m just a kid, Bruce, and I\u2019ll always be a kid to you, but listen, just go get yourself some more degrees, or go teach or whatever - just don\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay, kid, okay. I hear you.\u201d</p><p>Tony narrows his eyes at the one person he considers a friend, then shrugs. \u201cJarvis!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d The family butler walks into the room and waits for instructions.</p><p>\u201cDr. Banner will be staying for the next few days, please air out his room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are staying, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, kid, I\u2019ve got a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Dad just had a theater built - I think so he could watch the old newsreels, those films he had of him talking about whatever, damn, he loved listening to himself talk. No, I will miss him, he always gave me something to fight against.

You weren\u2019t even sure I would come home, but when I did, you forgave me, you took me back, and you never stopped loving me. You are a good person, Tony, and yeah, you managed to save Manhattan, too, did your father ever do any of that?

                "content": "<p>More about Stark&rsquo;s and Banner&rsquo;s relationship, this takes place after the memorial service for Tony&rsquo;s parents after the car crash. Again, I&rsquo;m messing about with time. Tony is 17 when his parents die in this verse, and Banner is in his twenties. Essentially, this is Tony recalling a bit of his and Banner&rsquo;s history for Stephen.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Tony, sorry I&rsquo;m late.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bruce.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s eyes are hard, but as brightly intelligent as they always have been in the past. Bruce offers his hand, and is surprised as Tony hugs him tightly, then lets him go. &ldquo;Sorry. Just couldn&rsquo;t sit in there any more, listening to people who had no clue - even Peggy - and she knew him. She knew what he was like.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She. He - Tony, you know it was -&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right, a different time, he was different. Sure. Probably still an ass, even back then. I had to get it from somewhere, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wanna go back to the homestead, have a drink? I&rsquo;m not sitting through another three hours of memories of a father I don&rsquo;t recognize, no one is talking about my mom, all anyone wants to talk about is the &lsquo;great Howard Stark&rsquo;.&rdquo; Bruce gives him a look and puts out his hand. Tony rolls his eyes at him, but drops a set of keys into his hand and allows Bruce to take him by the elbow and walk him over to his car.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;How old are you now, kid?&rdquo; Bruce asks quietly as he pours them each a double.</p><p>&ldquo;Just turned&hellip; hmmm&hellip; seventeen. Yeah&hellip; seventeen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you want to do with your life?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony tosses back half his drink and leans forward as he puts the cut crystal tumbler down carefully on a coaster. &ldquo;Mom and her coasters, she had a fucking cabinet just for her coasters&hellip; what do I want to do? I do know what I don&rsquo;t want to do, what I don&rsquo;t want to be. I don&rsquo;t want spend the next twenty, thirty years building new ways to blow up the world, I don&rsquo;t want to be the heir apparent to all this. But I don&rsquo;t have a choice, it&rsquo;s who I am, Bruce.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony. You don&rsquo;t have to be your dad.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony snorts at him and picks up his drink again. &ldquo;Right. And who should I be, then, Mr&hellip; no, Dr. what is it now, three PhDs, now, right? And what are you working on now? Wait, don&rsquo;t tell me -&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Working on my fourth and I&rsquo;m working on something big. I haven&rsquo;t told anyone. But last year I finally found Erskine&rsquo;s notebooks.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony shakes his head and finishes his drink, then stares at his friend for a long moment, before getting up to pour himself another drink. &ldquo;Those were buried. For a reason. Bruce. Even my dad wouldn&rsquo;t touch that and he loved Cap. At least he was capable of loving someone. Just not me. No. He loved you too. He did. Not only did I have to compete with Cap&rsquo;n America himself, and he was dead for over twenty-five years before I was even born, then there was you. Sorry, didn&rsquo;t plan to go there, today, or ever. Bruce. I know, if anyone could do it, redo the work, and actually get it right, it would be you, but the risks involved, the ethics. C&rsquo;mon, Bruce, they had a reason back then, at least they thought it was a good enough reason, and maybe - maybe it was, maybe without Captain America we wouldn&rsquo;t have won the war, but Erskine never shared the complete solution with anyone, the notebooks are only a path to what he came up with. You know, just because you can do something, doesn&rsquo;t mean you should. Didn&rsquo;t you learn anything from Howard?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony, I just want to see if I can do it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bruce. You know the history better than anyone - night after night, you couldn&rsquo;t get enough of the stories about the &lsquo;good ol&rsquo; days&rsquo;, but you know what it cost him. If he hadn&rsquo;t died in the car crash - the drinking alone -&rdquo; Tony glares at the glass in his hand and puts it down. &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m just a kid, Bruce, and I&rsquo;ll always be a kid to you, but listen, just go get yourself some more degrees, or go teach or whatever - just don&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, okay, kid, okay. I hear you.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony narrows his eyes at the one person he considers a friend, then shrugs. &ldquo;Jarvis!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sir?&rdquo; The family butler walks into the room and waits for instructions.</p><p>&ldquo;Dr. Banner will be staying for the next few days, please air out his room.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, Sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are staying, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, kid, I&rsquo;ve got a few days.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Listen, Dad just had a theater built - I think so he could watch the old newsreels, those films he had of him talking about whatever, damn, he loved listening to himself talk. No, I will miss him, he always gave me something to fight against. Not sure what I&rsquo;ll do without that&hellip; come on, we&rsquo;ll have Jarvis put on something, eat some popcorn, drink ourselves halfway to oblivion?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why not, kid, why not?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Tony.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The great Dr. Banner. What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have a problem.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bruce.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I, uhm - you know that thing we talked about a couple of months ago -&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did. It doesn&rsquo;t matter why, I thought I had it worked out - and -&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You tested it on yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I really need your help.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In your dad&rsquo;s old labs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Damn it, Banner.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony - you&rsquo;re the only person I trust - if anyone could help me, it&rsquo;s you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m on my way.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You tried to help him?&rdquo; Stephen asks Tony quietly, after Banner has said good night, and gone to sleep in the guest room.</p><p>&ldquo;And like with you, I failed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony, you were seventeen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I could have been fifty, it wouldn&rsquo;t have mattered, he messed with things he shouldn&rsquo;t have, I know why, of course I know why, the science, he wanted to know if he could, and he was so close to getting it right.
