You might not be after this.</p><p>Word Count: 4120</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"150\" data-orig-width=\"245\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0c071401252375e70306a282b2735d86/tumblr_pk69633YwN1u32261_250.gif\" data-orig-height=\"150\" data-orig-width=\"245\"/></figure><p><b>Losing him was blue like I&rsquo;d never known; Missing him was dark gray all alone; Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met&hellip;</b></p><p>We walked for a long time, utter silence between us. It was heavy and thick, but not awkward. We left the beach altogether, moving to the street and then past, to the woods. We walked through the green a long while before I started getting nervous. Irrational fears began creeping in, eating away at my edges.</p><p>Was he going to kill me? Was he going to taunt me? Make fun of me? See how far he could push me until I snapped? Maybe he didn\u2019t actually care about me or have his feelings back. Maybe this was a prank. Maybe that gang of his had turned him into a total ass. And a good liar. Maybe he was just seeing how far I would follow him before I realized he was pulling my leg. Maybe he was dragging me out far as I would let him before he took advantage of how vulnerable and exposed I was and took advantage of me and-</p><p>Okay there. I needed to calm down. I watched his arms swing, the steps he took. They seemed heavier, as he was more tired than I\u2019d known him to be. He was never one to have the best sleeping schedule but it was regular and not too bad. Six hours every night, sometimes more. And&hellip; sometimes less. He seemed like he\u2019d been getting a regular three or four these days. His shoulders sagged a bit. He was taller, more muscley. Maybe they\u2019d had him getting up earlier and working out so he would be as fit as they needed for whatever shenanigans they got up to?</p><p>I imagined my Embry in a gang. Getting everybody to pull pranks or rough housing with the other boys. Sharing secrets and making friendships, his smile wide as his eyes found me with a soft smile on his face at the end of the day. I imagined him, without me by his side. Watching me from a distance, wanting me but for some reason never approaching me. I imagined him trying to be lose, good friends with people he didn\u2019t know because for whatever reason he\u2019d left all those close to him behind.</p><p>Yeah. It didn\u2019t fit. He was awkward and often self conscious because he felt like he was really annoying, so though he was social and had quite a few acquaintances, he had two best friends and me. He kept his circle small and he liked it that way. The Four Musketeers. That way he could be as loud and immature and stupid and bothersome as he wanted and he knew that none of us would get genuinely, really bothered without telling him so.</p><p>Nothing made sense, and my curiosity finally became too much for me when I caught Embry\u2019s arm. I immediately pulled back though, hissing as he turned to me with a surprised expression as if he\u2019d forgotten I was there. \u201cEmbry, you\u2019re hot!\u201d He smirked and I glared. For a second we were ourselves again but then we quickly returned to the him and me we were now. \u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, running a hand through his hair. \u201cI guess here\u2019s a good a place as any.\u201d He huffed, nervousness rolling off of him in waves. He reached down and pulled his shirt off.</p><p>Spinning around, I covered my eyes. \u201cWHOA!\u201d My heart began racing wildly. \u201cEmbry put your shirt back on, NOW!\u201d</p><p>Embry chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re acting as if you\u2019ve never seen my shirtless before. I mean, you\u2019ve seen me naked.\u201d</p><p>To my horror, a burning blush was added to my fixation with his chest and how I didn\u2019t truly realized how much muscle he\u2019d gained until I could see every detail for myself. \u201cYeah, well&hellip;\u201d I struggled, but just gave up and blurted, \u201cThat\u2019s when we were having sex. We\u2019re not having sex right now.\u201d</p><p>Another chuckle and I wanted to slap him. \u201cY/n, turn around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I refused.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cY/n, please. I\u2019m not going to hurt you, I promise, but I do have to show you something that you have to see for yourself for you to understand and believe me. Really understand and really believe me. Y/n please.\u201d He was pleading, his voice full of worry and stress, and I couldn\u2019t resist him. I turned, my hands dropping to my sides. The second I was looking, he took several steps back and then tensed.</p><p>And suddenly he was hunching, his body curling and rippling as he bent almost to breaking and then elongated, his bones themselves morphing into a new shape. It was horrible to watch as I worried he must be in an awful amount of pain, but before I could even finish the thought to call out for him or scream or race at him or anything, a wolf was standing where he had been and I had a whole new problem to worry.</p><p>My head was spinning wildly. A wolf? Embry&hellip; he was&hellip; a wolf? Wait what? My face was screwed up in confusion, and all I could think to feel was anger. But then it registered. Embry. Was a wolf. Oh my gosh! \u201cWerewolf,\u201d I whispered. He looked up at me, and the human like eyes of his threw me for a loop. I seemed to be working in slow motion, working through layers of honey to reach the conclusion I already had in my hands. \u201cYou\u2019re a werewolf.\u201d</p><p>Shook took over. Where fear or panic or anger would have taken place in other people\u2019s places, all I felt was exploding curiosity. Energized and ecstatic. My body was itching as I moved closer to him, slowly but nowhere near as slow as I should have or would have approached a regular wolf. My hand moved through his fir after reaching out, my eyes widening as realizing finally hit me and pushed me through that finally string of shock.</p><p>I tackled him to the ground, straddling his side as I looked up him up close. He huffed in surprise, caught completely off guard as my hands wandered, touching his feet and then legs, side and fur and nose and ears. \u201cOh my gosh this is amazing. There are actual werewolves. You&hellip; you\u2019re a werewolf. That is amazing! Absolutely splendid! This is why you left, of course. And.. the heat,\u201d I realized, my hand resting between his ears as I paused, realizing. \u201cBecause you\u2019re a wolf. Wolves, especially your size, radiate so much heat. That\u2019s amazing!\u201d Mindlessly, my hand began to move on his head, my fingers scratching.</p><p>He whined, relaxing under my touch. I realized what I was doing and did it harder, scratching behind his ear. After a second I added my other hand- one had for each of his ears. \u201cDo you like that, boy?\u201d I asked gently.</p><p>He suddenly pulled his head away, grunting annoyedly. I realized that I was analyzing him like he was a scientific discovery and petting him like he was a dog and I lost it. I rolled off of him onto my back and then onto my side, curling my knees into my chest as I busted up into body wracking laughter. \u201cYOU LET ME PET YOU! YOU- YOU ENJOYED ME PETTING YOU!\u201d</p><p>He groaned and I closed my eyes, tears falling down my face. After a second, he reached over and a human hand touched me. He wore only a shirt and shorts, his jeans and shoes from earlier discarded off to the side. I began to calm down as he looked at me, kind of worried. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d  The ghost of a smile tugged at his lips- true to the nature of our relationship, one of us could not laugh so hard and so genuinely without calling a smile at the vert least to the other.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I confirmed, wiping my face of the tears and forcing myself to sit up as I caught my breath. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I&hellip; Tht must have been a weird reaction.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cDefinitely not one we\u2019ve gotten before.\u201d</p><p>After a pause, I looked at him with intrigue. He rose an eyebrow. \u201cDo you turn on the full moon.\u201d And so questions began.</p><p>\u201cOnly when we want to. Just like any other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have an alpha/omega/beta system like in the stories?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s-\u201c I cut off, realizing. \u201cSam\u2019s alpha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow often do you change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsually whenever we get upset or our heart race increases, but we can change whenever we want. Usually when there\u2019s a threat or for practice or routes&hellip; At least once every other day, on average.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat determines your fur color?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have&hellip; no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow fast do you run?\u201d I immediately followed up.</p><p>He smirked. \u201cFaster than vampires.\u201d</p><p>My eyes went wide and he paled as he realized his mistake. \u201cVampires?\u201d I asked weakly. He nodded wordlessly, allowing me space to process and think. I nodded after a second. \u201cIs that what you meant by threats I didn\u2019t know of?\u201d He nodded again. \u201cDo you guys only fight vampires?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s why we were created. Kill the vampires, protect the humans.\u201d</p><p>That put me at ease. I trusted him to protect me, as much as I trusted him not to hurt m earlier when he was a wolf. I&hellip; I trusted him. I trusted Embry, with my life. Literally. Oh my gosh. \u201cWhat are vampires like?\u201d He explained the red versus gold eyes, telling me about the Cullens and then having to explain Bella and Edward. I was surprised to realize that things had gotten so far and once Embry explained the treaty, I was even more surprised that Sam was letting it happen. He told me about what did and didn\u2019t work so far as lure that I knew. Garlic, no. Crosses, not to his knowledge. Rip them apart and burn the bodies; they glitter in the sun. Created to be alluring to humans, like sirens pulling sailors to their death. \u201cLand sirens,\u201d I mused. He smiled, nodding. We\u2019d been going on forever and I thought I was out of questions and knew all there was to know&hellip; until something occurred to me. \u201cEmbry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He asked. He had moved close and was playing with my fingers. I hadn\u2019t pulled away- it felt too good.</p><p>A little nervous, I asked quietly, \u201cDo wolves have mates? Because vampires have true mates and in the wild wolves have packs and mates and all that. Because, actual wolves don\u2019t have caste systems with alpha and all that, they just have families. Did you know that the guy who came up with the Alpha theory actually proved that he was wrong and told people he was wrong but no one listened? Anyway my point is that they\u2019re little families, with mates and cubs and loyalty like none of their. So&hellip; Does that translate over?\u201d</p><p>Embry let me babble and talk on as if he was stalling, but when the time came he looked up at me, that nervousness back in his eyes and posture where he\u2019d been so relaxed and content before. \u201cY/n, I&hellip; I have something to tell you.\u201d</p><p><b>But moving on from him is impossible when I still see it all in my head: burning red! Burning it was red!</b></p><p>My eyes traced lines in the dirt. \u201cSo you imprinted on me.\u201d I hadn\u00b4t asked a question so he didn\u2019t say anything. A moment stretched on and I felt my insides grow heavy inside of me, dragging and pulling and getting all tangled up. \u201cAnd it\u2019s painful for wolves to be away from their imprints, so Sam let you tell me.\u201d Embry still kept quiet. I looked up. \u201cIs there a way for you to undo it?\u201d</p><p>His eyes flared with pain. \u201cDo you want there to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just feels&hellip; against your will. What if you hadn\u2019t imprinted on me? What if you had imprinted on someone else_ Would your feelings for me just have been completely wiped away as if they never mattered? Years of love and familiarity and beating the odds, just&hellip; gone.\u201d My stomach twisted tighter and I felt nauseated so I changed my train of thought. \u201cWhat if your imprint is way younger? Or way older?\u201d</p><p>That struck a cord - Embry flinched. \u201cWhen we\u2019re shifting regularly, we stop aging. Whenever we choose to shop shifting, we grow older. We learn to control our emotions and overtime, it gets harder to shift. And harder to control it once you do again. Like a muscle or a talent. If you don\u2019t use it, you get rusty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you stop aging until they\u2019re old enough?\u201d I asked, trying to understand how people worked out these problems. I mean, it\u00b4s cool that they would do that for their imprint and that there was such a connection but it still didn\u00b4t feel right.</p><p>\u201cPrecisely,\u201d he agreed. \u201cIf they\u2019re older&hellip;\u201d He shrugged, awkwardness evident in his features. \u201cIt sucks.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened as that sunk in. \u201cThat\u2019s horrible! What if I decided to take another path? No future is certain, no decisions are permanent. Love even changes over time and you change with it or it fails. What if we go to different colleges? What if it gets too weird with the age gap that were eventually going to have? What if we change and aren\u2019t compatible anymore? What if- what if I die? That\u2019s so much pressure. I have to stay close and in good condition or you wither away into a depressed morning? Embry&hellip;\u201d</p><p>He looked really upset, and I wondered where we would be if he hadn\u00b4t imprinted on me. I wondered where we would have been if we never met. Did the last years even matter if we would have ended in this same place anyway, twisted by fate and supernatural animalistic instinct and drive? I felt like I was breathing through a straw and he reached out, his hands flattening on my neck and the side of my face, his thumb caressing my jaw to soothe me. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he whispered with a broken voice. \u201cI know you hate being forced into things, and you really don\u2019t HAVE to be with me. Please don\u2019t be with me again if you really don\u2019t want to, I\u2019d rather anything than you forcing yourself to date me when you don\u2019t want to. I\u2019ll make friendship work, I promise.\u201d</p><p>I grew sad. \u201cCan you fall in love with anyone else? Ever?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Pulling my face from his loving hold - unfortunately (I didn\u00b4t want to but I needed a clear mind and Embry\u00b4s touch gave me anything but, especially after so long when he touched me like that) - I sighed. \u201cI do love you, Em. And&hellip; I do trust you. I just-\u201c I was going to forgive him right there and end the tension. In the end, it didn\u00b4t matter how we got here or what brought us together. As always, we prevailed despite everything being thrown at us. It wasn\u2019t worth hurting him if I knew I was fine anyway. But then I thought of the months of his disappearing. Months avoiding me, convincing me that he didn\u2019t care about me at all. And maybe I did want to forgive him, but not quite yet. \u201cI need some time to think about all of this. Process. Okay?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and we both stood. After a second I smiled, opening my arms and he moved into them, hugging me firmly but gently. It was wonderful. I breathed his scent in, listening to his heart beat as my ear pressed to his chest. \u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I smiled. \u201cI know.\u201d I leaned away.  \u201cWalk me back to the beach?\u201d</p><p>Embry stepped away, nodding and smiling sadly. It almost made me want to stop&hellip; We made our way back to where we came from originally, and I snagged my bike from the ground, waving at Embry before taking off toward my house.</p><p>In actuality, I knew I loved and trusted Embry and that\u00b4s all that matters. And maybe it was cruel or petty of me, but I wanted him just to squirm a little bit more. Know what it was like to have someone you love choose to not be with you. To doubt that you\u00b4ll be with the person you would give anything for, go anywhere for, be anyone for. I wanted him to fear, just for a little bit, that he wouldn\u00b4t have his promised happily ever after.</p><p>Laying in my bed, I put my phone face down and silenced. It had been an unspoken thing that I would text Embry I was safe when I got home. While we were together at least. Now, I\u00b4m sure he assumed but I hadn\u00b4t promised or established that I would continue the tradition, even though in any other circumstance I would have.</p><p>I felt a little mean, worrying him, but a part of me was still hurt and angry. If I couldn\u00b4t stand to cut things off permanently but I also couldn\u00b4t simply erase months of deep emotional pain, I saw this as a happy medium. Some classic, well planned, carried through revenge.</p><p>I loved the boy, but this almost felt good.</p><p>Was that cruel of me?</p><p>&hellip;Oops.</p><p><b>Oh losing him was blue like I&rsquo;d never known; Missing him was dark gray all alone. Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met &lsquo;cause loving him was red! Yeah, yeah red! We&rsquo;re burning red!</b></p><p>It took him an entire week to lose his shit.</p><p>After being okay with missing him for so long and knowing I could go back anytime I wanted, it was surprisingly easy for me to be away from Embry. I missed him, my body itching to make up all the time we\u2019d missed over the last few months, and I yearned to answer his texts and hang out with him and kiss him and hug him and UGH, but I had self control. I had learned it when all I\u2019d wanted to do was go to Embry\u2019s house, knock down his door, kiss him, and demand he stop whatever the hell he was doing&hellip; but I couldn\u2019t, because he\u2019d told me to never talk to him ever again.</p><p>After those six days, though, I lay awake at night thinking about Embry and remembering back to when we\u2019d been together when a sharp and inconsistent tapping sounded on my window. Not tapping like fingers against the glad, but&hellip; I looked over, jumping when a pebble the size of my pinkie fingers came in contact with the glass. It was thin but still! I scrambled out of bed, moving to the window. I looked out and immediately saw Embry, who was pacing anxiously as he messed with the rock in his hands, breathing hard as he looked about ready to have a panic attack.</p><p>Because I lived in a one story house, I didn\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t just knock on my window, but maybe he was as much of a romantic as I remembered. I opened my window. \u201cEm?\u201d</p><p>He turned to me, relaxing at the sound of my voice as if it alone had flipped a switch in him. He itched to move to me, I could see it, and I smiled, moving aside too let him crawl in through my window. He didn\u2019t hesitate even a split second, moving to go through before I was even out all of the way. Once he was in, I closed my window again. I turned to him and he looked at me. \u201cHave you decided to avoid me then? Because I mean I definitely understand why but could you have at least told me? I\u2019ve been wondering-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be with you, Embry,\u201d I deadpanned. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you ever again.\u201d I wasn\u2019t looking at him, the exact same a he had treated me when he told me. My voice was hard and rough and he took a step back. \u201cI don\u2019t want to ever see you again.\u201d</p><p>He whimpered. \u201cY/n, please&hellip; it hurts to be away from you. Not just because of the wolf thing, but knowing that I can have you back. I asked Sam. He said it\u2019s different than it was with Emily. Moving faster, affecting more severely. It\u2019s me, Y/n. It\u2019s ME that hurts to be away from you. ME that loves you. Let\u2019s just be friends?\u201d</p><p>Turning to him, I looked him in the eyes. His glasses over, watering, as he prepare for me to totally reject him. I could see the loss in his eyes without me having to the say the words, and I could see his heart break. That was when I dropped it all. I stopped immediately, the softness and warm coming back to my face. He was instantly confused. \u201cHurts, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened and betrayal and a different kind of hurt filled his face. \u201cIs this a joke to you?\u201d He snapped. \u201cIs that why you\u2019ve been avoiding me? For some petty kind of revenge? How old are you?!\u201d I scoffed, crossing my arms over my chest as my own anger exploded. \u201cDon\u2019t get angry at me, you have no right! You hurt me Y/n! For an entire week I suffered until it physically hurt with worry, getting sick to my stomach and having a panic attack! I had a panic attack! Sam finally told me to come here and tell you because he was worried about me. What the hell Y/n you had no right!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no right?\u201d I sneered, venom dripping from my words.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cYou actually hurt me. You left me.\u201d</p><p>My eyes watered. \u201cIt hurts, doesn\u2019t it? Being left behind without an explanation or clue? To go from hot and in love to absolutely nothing? Hurts to worry and strain and hurt with no answers or clue. Sitting there to just WORRY. Bella Swan literally went comatose from it. I barely made it myself. I couldn\u2019t even go to school for an entire week after you too me you never wanted to talk to me again. You didn\u2019t even look at me, you just told me. No emotion, no recognition. Like I was nothing.\u201d</p><p>He scrambled to defend himself but he was struggling as realization began to truly dawn on him. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to imprint on you! They said that I might, since we were like in love and stuff and I didn\u2019t want to drag you into this world. I also didn\u2019t want it to NOT be you. I was terrified, more than I was of imprinting on you, that I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Tears began falling down my face and his anger dissipated in favor of pain, worry, and guilt. \u201cYou promised you would never leave me, Em. That you would never hurt me. And then you left. And THEN you hurt me in every possible fucking way.\u201d He looked away, his face contorting in severe pain. \u201cI forgive you,\u201d I whispered. \u201cAnd my anger and immaturity got the best of me, I just&hellip; I wanted you to understand. Understand how much it hurt. I\u2019m sorry, but&hellip; Em&hellip;\u201d He looked at me again as my words were broken by my cries that had turned to sobs. \u201cPlease don\u2019t do that again. Don\u2019t hurt me again. I couldn\u2019t survive it again.\u201d</p><p>He rushed at me, pulling me into him and holding me tightly. \u201cWe\u2019re even now,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou forgave me, so I can forgive you. We both fucked up, both with very good reasons for doing so.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI won\u2019t ever hurt you again Y/n. Not like that. I promise for real this time. I won\u2019t let anything come between us again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you die?\u201d I ask softly.</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be my fault,\u201d he answers even more softly. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll try my hardest, though.\u201d</p><p>I buried my face in his chest, clinging to his shirt. \u201cI can be okay with that.\u201d</p><p>We had a long way to go, but&hellip; maybe things could be okay now. We had each other, so there was always that.</p><p>-</p><p>Forever Tag List: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlBd-WaK7BasX3MeySuDOzQ\">@bitchyseawitch</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZ-9MTTp-87OMQrs3VnIAdA\">@chipster-21</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0FFm1xHm69D76Lc1wSzv9g\">@alexa-playafricabytoto</a> </p>",

You might not be after this.</p><p>Word Count: 4120</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"150\" data-orig-width=\"245\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0c071401252375e70306a282b2735d86/tumblr_pk69633YwN1u32261_250.gif\" data-orig-height=\"150\" data-orig-width=\"245\"></figure><p><b>Losing him was blue like I\u2019d never known; Missing him was dark gray all alone; Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met\u2026</b></p><p>We walked for a long time, utter silence between us. It was heavy and thick, but not awkward. We left the beach altogether, moving to the street and then past, to the woods. We walked through the green a long while before I started getting nervous. Irrational fears began creeping in, eating away at my edges.</p><p>Was he going to kill me? Was he going to taunt me? Make fun of me? See how far he could push me until I snapped? Maybe he didn\u2019t actually care about me or have his feelings back. Maybe this was a prank. Maybe that gang of his had turned him into a total ass. And a good liar. Maybe he was just seeing how far I would follow him before I realized he was pulling my leg. Maybe he was dragging me out far as I would let him before he took advantage of how vulnerable and exposed I was and took advantage of me and-</p><p>Okay there. I needed to calm down. I watched his arms swing, the steps he took. They seemed heavier, as he was more tired than I\u2019d known him to be. He was never one to have the best sleeping schedule but it was regular and not too bad. Six hours every night, sometimes more. And\u2026 sometimes less. He seemed like he\u2019d been getting a regular three or four these days. His shoulders sagged a bit. He was taller, more muscley. Maybe they\u2019d had him getting up earlier and working out so he would be as fit as they needed for whatever shenanigans they got up to?</p><p>I imagined my Embry in a gang. Getting everybody to pull pranks or rough housing with the other boys. Sharing secrets and making friendships, his smile wide as his eyes found me with a soft smile on his face at the end of the day. I imagined him, without me by his side. Watching me from a distance, wanting me but for some reason never approaching me. I imagined him trying to be lose, good friends with people he didn\u2019t know because for whatever reason he\u2019d left all those close to him behind.</p><p>Yeah. It didn\u2019t fit. He was awkward and often self conscious because he felt like he was really annoying, so though he was social and had quite a few acquaintances, he had two best friends and me. He kept his circle small and he liked it that way. The Four Musketeers. That way he could be as loud and immature and stupid and bothersome as he wanted and he knew that none of us would get genuinely, really bothered without telling him so.</p><p>Nothing made sense, and my curiosity finally became too much for me when I caught Embry\u2019s arm. I immediately pulled back though, hissing as he turned to me with a surprised expression as if he\u2019d forgotten I was there. \u201cEmbry, you\u2019re hot!\u201d He smirked and I glared. For a second we were ourselves again but then we quickly returned to the him and me we were now. \u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, running a hand through his hair. \u201cI guess here\u2019s a good a place as any.\u201d He huffed, nervousness rolling off of him in waves. He reached down and pulled his shirt off.</p><p>Spinning around, I covered my eyes. \u201cWHOA!\u201d My heart began racing wildly. \u201cEmbry put your shirt back on, NOW!\u201d</p><p>Embry chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re acting as if you\u2019ve never seen my shirtless before. I mean, you\u2019ve seen me naked.\u201d</p><p>To my horror, a burning blush was added to my fixation with his chest and how I didn\u2019t truly realized how much muscle he\u2019d gained until I could see every detail for myself. \u201cYeah, well\u2026\u201d I struggled, but just gave up and blurted, \u201cThat\u2019s when we were having sex. We\u2019re not having sex right now.\u201d</p><p>Another chuckle and I wanted to slap him. \u201cY/n, turn around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I refused.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cY/n, please. I\u2019m not going to hurt you, I promise, but I do have to show you something that you have to see for yourself for you to understand and believe me. Really understand and really believe me. Y/n please.\u201d He was pleading, his voice full of worry and stress, and I couldn\u2019t resist him. I turned, my hands dropping to my sides. The second I was looking, he took several steps back and then tensed.</p><p>And suddenly he was hunching, his body curling and rippling as he bent almost to breaking and then elongated, his bones themselves morphing into a new shape. It was horrible to watch as I worried he must be in an awful amount of pain, but before I could even finish the thought to call out for him or scream or race at him or anything, a wolf was standing where he had been and I had a whole new problem to worry.</p><p>My head was spinning wildly. A wolf? Embry\u2026 he was\u2026 a wolf? Wait what? My face was screwed up in confusion, and all I could think to feel was anger. But then it registered. Embry. Was a wolf. Oh my gosh! \u201cWerewolf,\u201d I whispered. He looked up at me, and the human like eyes of his threw me for a loop. I seemed to be working in slow motion, working through layers of honey to reach the conclusion I already had in my hands. \u201cYou\u2019re a werewolf.\u201d</p><p>Shook took over. Where fear or panic or anger would have taken place in other people\u2019s places, all I felt was exploding curiosity. Energized and ecstatic. My body was itching as I moved closer to him, slowly but nowhere near as slow as I should have or would have approached a regular wolf. My hand moved through his fir after reaching out, my eyes widening as realizing finally hit me and pushed me through that finally string of shock.</p><p>I tackled him to the ground, straddling his side as I looked up him up close. He huffed in surprise, caught completely off guard as my hands wandered, touching his feet and then legs, side and fur and nose and ears. \u201cOh my gosh this is amazing. There are actual werewolves. You\u2026 you\u2019re a werewolf. That is amazing! Absolutely splendid! This is why you left, of course. And.. the heat,\u201d I realized, my hand resting between his ears as I paused, realizing. \u201cBecause you\u2019re a wolf. Wolves, especially your size, radiate so much heat. That\u2019s amazing!\u201d Mindlessly, my hand began to move on his head, my fingers scratching.</p><p>He whined, relaxing under my touch. I realized what I was doing and did it harder, scratching behind his ear. After a second I added my other hand- one had for each of his ears. \u201cDo you like that, boy?\u201d I asked gently.</p><p>He suddenly pulled his head away, grunting annoyedly. I realized that I was analyzing him like he was a scientific discovery and petting him like he was a dog and I lost it. I rolled off of him onto my back and then onto my side, curling my knees into my chest as I busted up into body wracking laughter. \u201cYOU LET ME PET YOU! YOU- YOU ENJOYED ME PETTING YOU!\u201d</p><p>He groaned and I closed my eyes, tears falling down my face. After a second, he reached over and a human hand touched me. He wore only a shirt and shorts, his jeans and shoes from earlier discarded off to the side. I began to calm down as he looked at me, kind of worried. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d  The ghost of a smile tugged at his lips- true to the nature of our relationship, one of us could not laugh so hard and so genuinely without calling a smile at the vert least to the other.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I confirmed, wiping my face of the tears and forcing myself to sit up as I caught my breath. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2026 Tht must have been a weird reaction.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cDefinitely not one we\u2019ve gotten before.\u201d</p><p>After a pause, I looked at him with intrigue. He rose an eyebrow. \u201cDo you turn on the full moon.\u201d And so questions began.</p><p>\u201cOnly when we want to. Just like any other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have an alpha/omega/beta system like in the stories?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s-\u201c I cut off, realizing. \u201cSam\u2019s alpha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow often do you change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsually whenever we get upset or our heart race increases, but we can change whenever we want. Usually when there\u2019s a threat or for practice or routes\u2026 At least once every other day, on average.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat determines your fur color?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have\u2026 no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow fast do you run?\u201d I immediately followed up.</p><p>He smirked. \u201cFaster than vampires.\u201d</p><p>My eyes went wide and he paled as he realized his mistake. \u201cVampires?\u201d I asked weakly. He nodded wordlessly, allowing me space to process and think. I nodded after a second. \u201cIs that what you meant by threats I didn\u2019t know of?\u201d He nodded again. \u201cDo you guys only fight vampires?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s why we were created. Kill the vampires, protect the humans.\u201d</p><p>That put me at ease. I trusted him to protect me, as much as I trusted him not to hurt m earlier when he was a wolf. I\u2026 I trusted him. I trusted Embry, with my life. Literally. Oh my gosh. \u201cWhat are vampires like?\u201d He explained the red versus gold eyes, telling me about the Cullens and then having to explain Bella and Edward. I was surprised to realize that things had gotten so far and once Embry explained the treaty, I was even more surprised that Sam was letting it happen. He told me about what did and didn\u2019t work so far as lure that I knew. Garlic, no. Crosses, not to his knowledge. Rip them apart and burn the bodies; they glitter in the sun. Created to be alluring to humans, like sirens pulling sailors to their death. \u201cLand sirens,\u201d I mused. He smiled, nodding. We\u2019d been going on forever and I thought I was out of questions and knew all there was to know\u2026 until something occurred to me. \u201cEmbry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He asked. He had moved close and was playing with my fingers. I hadn\u2019t pulled away- it felt too good.</p><p>A little nervous, I asked quietly, \u201cDo wolves have mates? Because vampires have true mates and in the wild wolves have packs and mates and all that. Because, actual wolves don\u2019t have caste systems with alpha and all that, they just have families. Did you know that the guy who came up with the Alpha theory actually proved that he was wrong and told people he was wrong but no one listened? Anyway my point is that they\u2019re little families, with mates and cubs and loyalty like none of their. So\u2026 Does that translate over?\u201d</p><p>Embry let me babble and talk on as if he was stalling, but when the time came he looked up at me, that nervousness back in his eyes and posture where he\u2019d been so relaxed and content before. \u201cY/n, I\u2026 I have something to tell you.\u201d</p><p><b>But moving on from him is impossible when I still see it all in my head: burning red! Burning it was red!</b></p><p>My eyes traced lines in the dirt. \u201cSo you imprinted on me.\u201d I hadn\u00b4t asked a question so he didn\u2019t say anything. A moment stretched on and I felt my insides grow heavy inside of me, dragging and pulling and getting all tangled up. \u201cAnd it\u2019s painful for wolves to be away from their imprints, so Sam let you tell me.\u201d Embry still kept quiet. I looked up. \u201cIs there a way for you to undo it?\u201d</p><p>His eyes flared with pain. \u201cDo you want there to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just feels\u2026 against your will. What if you hadn\u2019t imprinted on me? What if you had imprinted on someone else_ Would your feelings for me just have been completely wiped away as if they never mattered? Years of love and familiarity and beating the odds, just\u2026 gone.\u201d My stomach twisted tighter and I felt nauseated so I changed my train of thought. \u201cWhat if your imprint is way younger? Or way older?\u201d</p><p>That struck a cord - Embry flinched. \u201cWhen we\u2019re shifting regularly, we stop aging. Whenever we choose to shop shifting, we grow older. We learn to control our emotions and overtime, it gets harder to shift. And harder to control it once you do again. Like a muscle or a talent. If you don\u2019t use it, you get rusty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you stop aging until they\u2019re old enough?\u201d I asked, trying to understand how people worked out these problems. I mean, it\u00b4s cool that they would do that for their imprint and that there was such a connection but it still didn\u00b4t feel right.</p><p>\u201cPrecisely,\u201d he agreed. \u201cIf they\u2019re older\u2026\u201d He shrugged, awkwardness evident in his features. \u201cIt sucks.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened as that sunk in. \u201cThat\u2019s horrible! What if I decided to take another path? No future is certain, no decisions are permanent. Love even changes over time and you change with it or it fails. What if we go to different colleges? What if it gets too weird with the age gap that were eventually going to have? What if we change and aren\u2019t compatible anymore? What if- what if I die? That\u2019s so much pressure. I have to stay close and in good condition or you wither away into a depressed morning? Embry\u2026\u201d</p><p>He looked really upset, and I wondered where we would be if he hadn\u00b4t imprinted on me. I wondered where we would have been if we never met. Did the last years even matter if we would have ended in this same place anyway, twisted by fate and supernatural animalistic instinct and drive? I felt like I was breathing through a straw and he reached out, his hands flattening on my neck and the side of my face, his thumb caressing my jaw to soothe me. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he whispered with a broken voice. \u201cI know you hate being forced into things, and you really don\u2019t HAVE to be with me. Please don\u2019t be with me again if you really don\u2019t want to, I\u2019d rather anything than you forcing yourself to date me when you don\u2019t want to. I\u2019ll make friendship work, I promise.\u201d</p><p>I grew sad. \u201cCan you fall in love with anyone else? Ever?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Pulling my face from his loving hold - unfortunately (I didn\u00b4t want to but I needed a clear mind and Embry\u00b4s touch gave me anything but, especially after so long when he touched me like that) - I sighed. \u201cI do love you, Em. And\u2026 I do trust you. I just-\u201c I was going to forgive him right there and end the tension. In the end, it didn\u00b4t matter how we got here or what brought us together. As always, we prevailed despite everything being thrown at us. It wasn\u2019t worth hurting him if I knew I was fine anyway. But then I thought of the months of his disappearing. Months avoiding me, convincing me that he didn\u2019t care about me at all. And maybe I did want to forgive him, but not quite yet. \u201cI need some time to think about all of this. Process. Okay?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and we both stood. After a second I smiled, opening my arms and he moved into them, hugging me firmly but gently. It was wonderful. I breathed his scent in, listening to his heart beat as my ear pressed to his chest. \u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I smiled. \u201cI know.\u201d I leaned away.  \u201cWalk me back to the beach?\u201d</p><p>Embry stepped away, nodding and smiling sadly. It almost made me want to stop\u2026 We made our way back to where we came from originally, and I snagged my bike from the ground, waving at Embry before taking off toward my house.</p><p>In actuality, I knew I loved and trusted Embry and that\u00b4s all that matters. And maybe it was cruel or petty of me, but I wanted him just to squirm a little bit more. Know what it was like to have someone you love choose to not be with you. To doubt that you\u00b4ll be with the person you would give anything for, go anywhere for, be anyone for. I wanted him to fear, just for a little bit, that he wouldn\u00b4t have his promised happily ever after.</p><p>Laying in my bed, I put my phone face down and silenced. It had been an unspoken thing that I would text Embry I was safe when I got home. While we were together at least. Now, I\u00b4m sure he assumed but I hadn\u00b4t promised or established that I would continue the tradition, even though in any other circumstance I would have.</p><p>I felt a little mean, worrying him, but a part of me was still hurt and angry. If I couldn\u00b4t stand to cut things off permanently but I also couldn\u00b4t simply erase months of deep emotional pain, I saw this as a happy medium. Some classic, well planned, carried through revenge.</p><p>I loved the boy, but this almost felt good.</p><p>Was that cruel of me?</p><p>\u2026Oops.</p><p><b>Oh losing him was blue like I\u2019d never known; Missing him was dark gray all alone. Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met \u2018cause loving him was red! Yeah, yeah red! We\u2019re burning red!</b></p><p>It took him an entire week to lose his shit.</p><p>After being okay with missing him for so long and knowing I could go back anytime I wanted, it was surprisingly easy for me to be away from Embry. I missed him, my body itching to make up all the time we\u2019d missed over the last few months, and I yearned to answer his texts and hang out with him and kiss him and hug him and UGH, but I had self control. I had learned it when all I\u2019d wanted to do was go to Embry\u2019s house, knock down his door, kiss him, and demand he stop whatever the hell he was doing\u2026 but I couldn\u2019t, because he\u2019d told me to never talk to him ever again.</p><p>After those six days, though, I lay awake at night thinking about Embry and remembering back to when we\u2019d been together when a sharp and inconsistent tapping sounded on my window. Not tapping like fingers against the glad, but\u2026 I looked over, jumping when a pebble the size of my pinkie fingers came in contact with the glass. It was thin but still! I scrambled out of bed, moving to the window. I looked out and immediately saw Embry, who was pacing anxiously as he messed with the rock in his hands, breathing hard as he looked about ready to have a panic attack.</p><p>Because I lived in a one story house, I didn\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t just knock on my window, but maybe he was as much of a romantic as I remembered. I opened my window. \u201cEm?\u201d</p><p>He turned to me, relaxing at the sound of my voice as if it alone had flipped a switch in him. He itched to move to me, I could see it, and I smiled, moving aside too let him crawl in through my window. He didn\u2019t hesitate even a split second, moving to go through before I was even out all of the way. Once he was in, I closed my window again. I turned to him and he looked at me. \u201cHave you decided to avoid me then? Because I mean I definitely understand why but could you have at least told me? I\u2019ve been wondering-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be with you, Embry,\u201d I deadpanned. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you ever again.\u201d I wasn\u2019t looking at him, the exact same a he had treated me when he told me. My voice was hard and rough and he took a step back. \u201cI don\u2019t want to ever see you again.\u201d</p><p>He whimpered. \u201cY/n, please\u2026 it hurts to be away from you. Not just because of the wolf thing, but knowing that I can have you back. I asked Sam. He said it\u2019s different than it was with Emily. Moving faster, affecting more severely. It\u2019s me, Y/n. It\u2019s ME that hurts to be away from you. ME that loves you. Let\u2019s just be friends?\u201d</p><p>Turning to him, I looked him in the eyes. His glasses over, watering, as he prepare for me to totally reject him. I could see the loss in his eyes without me having to the say the words, and I could see his heart break. That was when I dropped it all. I stopped immediately, the softness and warm coming back to my face. He was instantly confused. \u201cHurts, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened and betrayal and a different kind of hurt filled his face. \u201cIs this a joke to you?\u201d He snapped. \u201cIs that why you\u2019ve been avoiding me? For some petty kind of revenge? How old are you?!\u201d I scoffed, crossing my arms over my chest as my own anger exploded. \u201cDon\u2019t get angry at me, you have no right! You hurt me Y/n! For an entire week I suffered until it physically hurt with worry, getting sick to my stomach and having a panic attack! I had a panic attack! Sam finally told me to come here and tell you because he was worried about me. What the hell Y/n you had no right!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no right?\u201d I sneered, venom dripping from my words.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cYou actually hurt me. You left me.\u201d</p><p>My eyes watered. \u201cIt hurts, doesn\u2019t it? Being left behind without an explanation or clue? To go from hot and in love to absolutely nothing? Hurts to worry and strain and hurt with no answers or clue. Sitting there to just WORRY. Bella Swan literally went comatose from it. I barely made it myself. I couldn\u2019t even go to school for an entire week after you too me you never wanted to talk to me again. You didn\u2019t even look at me, you just told me. No emotion, no recognition. Like I was nothing.\u201d</p><p>He scrambled to defend himself but he was struggling as realization began to truly dawn on him. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to imprint on you! They said that I might, since we were like in love and stuff and I didn\u2019t want to drag you into this world. I also didn\u2019t want it to NOT be you. I was terrified, more than I was of imprinting on you, that I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Tears began falling down my face and his anger dissipated in favor of pain, worry, and guilt. \u201cYou promised you would never leave me, Em. That you would never hurt me. And then you left. And THEN you hurt me in every possible fucking way.\u201d He looked away, his face contorting in severe pain. \u201cI forgive you,\u201d I whispered. \u201cAnd my anger and immaturity got the best of me, I just\u2026 I wanted you to understand. Understand how much it hurt. I\u2019m sorry, but\u2026 Em\u2026\u201d He looked at me again as my words were broken by my cries that had turned to sobs. \u201cPlease don\u2019t do that again. Don\u2019t hurt me again. I couldn\u2019t survive it again.\u201d</p><p>He rushed at me, pulling me into him and holding me tightly. \u201cWe\u2019re even now,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou forgave me, so I can forgive you. We both fucked up, both with very good reasons for doing so.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI won\u2019t ever hurt you again Y/n. Not like that. I promise for real this time. I won\u2019t let anything come between us again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you die?\u201d I ask softly.</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be my fault,\u201d he answers even more softly. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll try my hardest, though.\u201d</p><p>I buried my face in his chest, clinging to his shirt. \u201cI can be okay with that.\u201d</p><p>We had a long way to go, but\u2026 maybe things could be okay now. We had each other, so there was always that.</p><p>-</p><p>Forever Tag List: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlBd-WaK7BasX3MeySuDOzQ\">@bitchyseawitch</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZ-9MTTp-87OMQrs3VnIAdA\">@chipster-21</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0FFm1xHm69D76Lc1wSzv9g\">@alexa-playafricabytoto</a> </p></p>",

You might not be after this.</p><p>Word Count: 4120</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"150\" data-orig-width=\"245\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0c071401252375e70306a282b2735d86/tumblr_pk69633YwN1u32261_250.gif\" data-orig-height=\"150\" data-orig-width=\"245\"></figure><p><b>Losing him was blue like I\u2019d never known; Missing him was dark gray all alone; Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met\u2026</b></p><p>We walked for a long time, utter silence between us. It was heavy and thick, but not awkward. We left the beach altogether, moving to the street and then past, to the woods. We walked through the green a long while before I started getting nervous. Irrational fears began creeping in, eating away at my edges.</p><p>Was he going to kill me? Was he going to taunt me? Make fun of me? See how far he could push me until I snapped? Maybe he didn\u2019t actually care about me or have his feelings back. Maybe this was a prank. Maybe that gang of his had turned him into a total ass. And a good liar. Maybe he was just seeing how far I would follow him before I realized he was pulling my leg. Maybe he was dragging me out far as I would let him before he took advantage of how vulnerable and exposed I was and took advantage of me and-</p><p>Okay there. I needed to calm down. I watched his arms swing, the steps he took. They seemed heavier, as he was more tired than I\u2019d known him to be. He was never one to have the best sleeping schedule but it was regular and not too bad. Six hours every night, sometimes more. And\u2026 sometimes less. He seemed like he\u2019d been getting a regular three or four these days. His shoulders sagged a bit. He was taller, more muscley. Maybe they\u2019d had him getting up earlier and working out so he would be as fit as they needed for whatever shenanigans they got up to?</p><p>I imagined my Embry in a gang. Getting everybody to pull pranks or rough housing with the other boys. Sharing secrets and making friendships, his smile wide as his eyes found me with a soft smile on his face at the end of the day. I imagined him, without me by his side. Watching me from a distance, wanting me but for some reason never approaching me. I imagined him trying to be lose, good friends with people he didn\u2019t know because for whatever reason he\u2019d left all those close to him behind.</p><p>Yeah. It didn\u2019t fit. He was awkward and often self conscious because he felt like he was really annoying, so though he was social and had quite a few acquaintances, he had two best friends and me. He kept his circle small and he liked it that way. The Four Musketeers. That way he could be as loud and immature and stupid and bothersome as he wanted and he knew that none of us would get genuinely, really bothered without telling him so.</p><p>Nothing made sense, and my curiosity finally became too much for me when I caught Embry\u2019s arm. I immediately pulled back though, hissing as he turned to me with a surprised expression as if he\u2019d forgotten I was there. \u201cEmbry, you\u2019re hot!\u201d He smirked and I glared. For a second we were ourselves again but then we quickly returned to the him and me we were now. \u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, running a hand through his hair. \u201cI guess here\u2019s a good a place as any.\u201d He huffed, nervousness rolling off of him in waves. He reached down and pulled his shirt off.</p><p>Spinning around, I covered my eyes. \u201cWHOA!\u201d My heart began racing wildly. \u201cEmbry put your shirt back on, NOW!\u201d</p><p>Embry chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re acting as if you\u2019ve never seen my shirtless before. I mean, you\u2019ve seen me naked.\u201d</p><p>To my horror, a burning blush was added to my fixation with his chest and how I didn\u2019t truly realized how much muscle he\u2019d gained until I could see every detail for myself. \u201cYeah, well\u2026\u201d I struggled, but just gave up and blurted, \u201cThat\u2019s when we were having sex. We\u2019re not having sex right now.\u201d</p><p>Another chuckle and I wanted to slap him. \u201cY/n, turn around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I refused.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cY/n, please. I\u2019m not going to hurt you, I promise, but I do have to show you something that you have to see for yourself for you to understand and believe me. Really understand and really believe me. Y/n please.\u201d He was pleading, his voice full of worry and stress, and I couldn\u2019t resist him. I turned, my hands dropping to my sides. The second I was looking, he took several steps back and then tensed.</p><p>And suddenly he was hunching, his body curling and rippling as he bent almost to breaking and then elongated, his bones themselves morphing into a new shape. It was horrible to watch as I worried he must be in an awful amount of pain, but before I could even finish the thought to call out for him or scream or race at him or anything, a wolf was standing where he had been and I had a whole new problem to worry.</p><p>My head was spinning wildly. A wolf? Embry\u2026 he was\u2026 a wolf? Wait what? My face was screwed up in confusion, and all I could think to feel was anger. But then it registered. Embry. Was a wolf. Oh my gosh! \u201cWerewolf,\u201d I whispered. He looked up at me, and the human like eyes of his threw me for a loop. I seemed to be working in slow motion, working through layers of honey to reach the conclusion I already had in my hands. \u201cYou\u2019re a werewolf.\u201d</p><p>Shook took over. Where fear or panic or anger would have taken place in other people\u2019s places, all I felt was exploding curiosity. Energized and ecstatic. My body was itching as I moved closer to him, slowly but nowhere near as slow as I should have or would have approached a regular wolf. My hand moved through his fir after reaching out, my eyes widening as realizing finally hit me and pushed me through that finally string of shock.</p><p>I tackled him to the ground, straddling his side as I looked up him up close. He huffed in surprise, caught completely off guard as my hands wandered, touching his feet and then legs, side and fur and nose and ears. \u201cOh my gosh this is amazing. There are actual werewolves. You\u2026 you\u2019re a werewolf. That is amazing! Absolutely splendid! This is why you left, of course. And.. the heat,\u201d I realized, my hand resting between his ears as I paused, realizing. \u201cBecause you\u2019re a wolf. Wolves, especially your size, radiate so much heat. That\u2019s amazing!\u201d Mindlessly, my hand began to move on his head, my fingers scratching.</p><p>He whined, relaxing under my touch. I realized what I was doing and did it harder, scratching behind his ear. After a second I added my other hand- one had for each of his ears. \u201cDo you like that, boy?\u201d I asked gently.</p><p>He suddenly pulled his head away, grunting annoyedly. I realized that I was analyzing him like he was a scientific discovery and petting him like he was a dog and I lost it. I rolled off of him onto my back and then onto my side, curling my knees into my chest as I busted up into body wracking laughter. \u201cYOU LET ME PET YOU! YOU- YOU ENJOYED ME PETTING YOU!\u201d</p><p>He groaned and I closed my eyes, tears falling down my face. After a second, he reached over and a human hand touched me. He wore only a shirt and shorts, his jeans and shoes from earlier discarded off to the side. I began to calm down as he looked at me, kind of worried. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d  The ghost of a smile tugged at his lips- true to the nature of our relationship, one of us could not laugh so hard and so genuinely without calling a smile at the vert least to the other.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I confirmed, wiping my face of the tears and forcing myself to sit up as I caught my breath. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2026 Tht must have been a weird reaction.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cDefinitely not one we\u2019ve gotten before.\u201d</p><p>After a pause, I looked at him with intrigue. He rose an eyebrow. \u201cDo you turn on the full moon.\u201d And so questions began.</p><p>\u201cOnly when we want to. Just like any other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have an alpha/omega/beta system like in the stories?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s-\u201c I cut off, realizing. \u201cSam\u2019s alpha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow often do you change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsually whenever we get upset or our heart race increases, but we can change whenever we want. Usually when there\u2019s a threat or for practice or routes\u2026 At least once every other day, on average.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat determines your fur color?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have\u2026 no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow fast do you run?\u201d I immediately followed up.</p><p>He smirked. \u201cFaster than vampires.\u201d</p><p>My eyes went wide and he paled as he realized his mistake. \u201cVampires?\u201d I asked weakly. He nodded wordlessly, allowing me space to process and think. I nodded after a second. \u201cIs that what you meant by threats I didn\u2019t know of?\u201d He nodded again. \u201cDo you guys only fight vampires?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s why we were created. Kill the vampires, protect the humans.\u201d</p><p>That put me at ease. I trusted him to protect me, as much as I trusted him not to hurt m earlier when he was a wolf. I\u2026 I trusted him. I trusted Embry, with my life. Literally. Oh my gosh. \u201cWhat are vampires like?\u201d He explained the red versus gold eyes, telling me about the Cullens and then having to explain Bella and Edward. I was surprised to realize that things had gotten so far and once Embry explained the treaty, I was even more surprised that Sam was letting it happen. He told me about what did and didn\u2019t work so far as lure that I knew. Garlic, no. Crosses, not to his knowledge. Rip them apart and burn the bodies; they glitter in the sun. Created to be alluring to humans, like sirens pulling sailors to their death. \u201cLand sirens,\u201d I mused. He smiled, nodding. We\u2019d been going on forever and I thought I was out of questions and knew all there was to know\u2026 until something occurred to me. \u201cEmbry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He asked. He had moved close and was playing with my fingers. I hadn\u2019t pulled away- it felt too good.</p><p>A little nervous, I asked quietly, \u201cDo wolves have mates? Because vampires have true mates and in the wild wolves have packs and mates and all that. Because, actual wolves don\u2019t have caste systems with alpha and all that, they just have families. Did you know that the guy who came up with the Alpha theory actually proved that he was wrong and told people he was wrong but no one listened? Anyway my point is that they\u2019re little families, with mates and cubs and loyalty like none of their. So\u2026 Does that translate over?\u201d</p><p>Embry let me babble and talk on as if he was stalling, but when the time came he looked up at me, that nervousness back in his eyes and posture where he\u2019d been so relaxed and content before. \u201cY/n, I\u2026 I have something to tell you.\u201d</p><p><b>But moving on from him is impossible when I still see it all in my head: burning red! Burning it was red!</b></p><p>My eyes traced lines in the dirt. \u201cSo you imprinted on me.\u201d I hadn\u00b4t asked a question so he didn\u2019t say anything. A moment stretched on and I felt my insides grow heavy inside of me, dragging and pulling and getting all tangled up. \u201cAnd it\u2019s painful for wolves to be away from their imprints, so Sam let you tell me.\u201d Embry still kept quiet. I looked up. \u201cIs there a way for you to undo it?\u201d</p><p>His eyes flared with pain. \u201cDo you want there to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just feels\u2026 against your will. What if you hadn\u2019t imprinted on me? What if you had imprinted on someone else_ Would your feelings for me just have been completely wiped away as if they never mattered? Years of love and familiarity and beating the odds, just\u2026 gone.\u201d My stomach twisted tighter and I felt nauseated so I changed my train of thought. \u201cWhat if your imprint is way younger? Or way older?\u201d</p><p>That struck a cord - Embry flinched. \u201cWhen we\u2019re shifting regularly, we stop aging. Whenever we choose to shop shifting, we grow older. We learn to control our emotions and overtime, it gets harder to shift. And harder to control it once you do again. Like a muscle or a talent. If you don\u2019t use it, you get rusty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you stop aging until they\u2019re old enough?\u201d I asked, trying to understand how people worked out these problems. I mean, it\u00b4s cool that they would do that for their imprint and that there was such a connection but it still didn\u00b4t feel right.</p><p>\u201cPrecisely,\u201d he agreed. \u201cIf they\u2019re older\u2026\u201d He shrugged, awkwardness evident in his features. \u201cIt sucks.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened as that sunk in. \u201cThat\u2019s horrible! What if I decided to take another path? No future is certain, no decisions are permanent. Love even changes over time and you change with it or it fails. What if we go to different colleges? What if it gets too weird with the age gap that were eventually going to have? What if we change and aren\u2019t compatible anymore? What if- what if I die? That\u2019s so much pressure. I have to stay close and in good condition or you wither away into a depressed morning? Embry\u2026\u201d</p><p>He looked really upset, and I wondered where we would be if he hadn\u00b4t imprinted on me. I wondered where we would have been if we never met. Did the last years even matter if we would have ended in this same place anyway, twisted by fate and supernatural animalistic instinct and drive? I felt like I was breathing through a straw and he reached out, his hands flattening on my neck and the side of my face, his thumb caressing my jaw to soothe me. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he whispered with a broken voice. \u201cI know you hate being forced into things, and you really don\u2019t HAVE to be with me. Please don\u2019t be with me again if you really don\u2019t want to, I\u2019d rather anything than you forcing yourself to date me when you don\u2019t want to. I\u2019ll make friendship work, I promise.\u201d</p><p>I grew sad. \u201cCan you fall in love with anyone else? Ever?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Pulling my face from his loving hold - unfortunately (I didn\u00b4t want to but I needed a clear mind and Embry\u00b4s touch gave me anything but, especially after so long when he touched me like that) - I sighed. \u201cI do love you, Em. And\u2026 I do trust you. I just-\u201c I was going to forgive him right there and end the tension. In the end, it didn\u00b4t matter how we got here or what brought us together. As always, we prevailed despite everything being thrown at us. It wasn\u2019t worth hurting him if I knew I was fine anyway. But then I thought of the months of his disappearing. Months avoiding me, convincing me that he didn\u2019t care about me at all. And maybe I did want to forgive him, but not quite yet. \u201cI need some time to think about all of this. Process. Okay?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and we both stood. After a second I smiled, opening my arms and he moved into them, hugging me firmly but gently. It was wonderful. I breathed his scent in, listening to his heart beat as my ear pressed to his chest. \u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I smiled. \u201cI know.\u201d I leaned away.  \u201cWalk me back to the beach?\u201d</p><p>Embry stepped away, nodding and smiling sadly. It almost made me want to stop\u2026 We made our way back to where we came from originally, and I snagged my bike from the ground, waving at Embry before taking off toward my house.</p><p>In actuality, I knew I loved and trusted Embry and that\u00b4s all that matters. And maybe it was cruel or petty of me, but I wanted him just to squirm a little bit more. Know what it was like to have someone you love choose to not be with you. To doubt that you\u00b4ll be with the person you would give anything for, go anywhere for, be anyone for. I wanted him to fear, just for a little bit, that he wouldn\u00b4t have his promised happily ever after.</p><p>Laying in my bed, I put my phone face down and silenced. It had been an unspoken thing that I would text Embry I was safe when I got home. While we were together at least. Now, I\u00b4m sure he assumed but I hadn\u00b4t promised or established that I would continue the tradition, even though in any other circumstance I would have.</p><p>I felt a little mean, worrying him, but a part of me was still hurt and angry. If I couldn\u00b4t stand to cut things off permanently but I also couldn\u00b4t simply erase months of deep emotional pain, I saw this as a happy medium. Some classic, well planned, carried through revenge.</p><p>I loved the boy, but this almost felt good.</p><p>Was that cruel of me?</p><p>\u2026Oops.</p><p><b>Oh losing him was blue like I\u2019d never known; Missing him was dark gray all alone. Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met \u2018cause loving him was red! Yeah, yeah red! We\u2019re burning red!</b></p><p>It took him an entire week to lose his shit.</p><p>After being okay with missing him for so long and knowing I could go back anytime I wanted, it was surprisingly easy for me to be away from Embry. I missed him, my body itching to make up all the time we\u2019d missed over the last few months, and I yearned to answer his texts and hang out with him and kiss him and hug him and UGH, but I had self control. I had learned it when all I\u2019d wanted to do was go to Embry\u2019s house, knock down his door, kiss him, and demand he stop whatever the hell he was doing\u2026 but I couldn\u2019t, because he\u2019d told me to never talk to him ever again.</p><p>After those six days, though, I lay awake at night thinking about Embry and remembering back to when we\u2019d been together when a sharp and inconsistent tapping sounded on my window. Not tapping like fingers against the glad, but\u2026 I looked over, jumping when a pebble the size of my pinkie fingers came in contact with the glass. It was thin but still! I scrambled out of bed, moving to the window. I looked out and immediately saw Embry, who was pacing anxiously as he messed with the rock in his hands, breathing hard as he looked about ready to have a panic attack.</p><p>Because I lived in a one story house, I didn\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t just knock on my window, but maybe he was as much of a romantic as I remembered. I opened my window. \u201cEm?\u201d</p><p>He turned to me, relaxing at the sound of my voice as if it alone had flipped a switch in him. He itched to move to me, I could see it, and I smiled, moving aside too let him crawl in through my window. He didn\u2019t hesitate even a split second, moving to go through before I was even out all of the way. Once he was in, I closed my window again. I turned to him and he looked at me. \u201cHave you decided to avoid me then? Because I mean I definitely understand why but could you have at least told me? I\u2019ve been wondering-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be with you, Embry,\u201d I deadpanned. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you ever again.\u201d I wasn\u2019t looking at him, the exact same a he had treated me when he told me. My voice was hard and rough and he took a step back. \u201cI don\u2019t want to ever see you again.\u201d</p><p>He whimpered. \u201cY/n, please\u2026 it hurts to be away from you. Not just because of the wolf thing, but knowing that I can have you back. I asked Sam. He said it\u2019s different than it was with Emily. Moving faster, affecting more severely. It\u2019s me, Y/n. It\u2019s ME that hurts to be away from you. ME that loves you. Let\u2019s just be friends?\u201d</p><p>Turning to him, I looked him in the eyes. His glasses over, watering, as he prepare for me to totally reject him. I could see the loss in his eyes without me having to the say the words, and I could see his heart break. That was when I dropped it all. I stopped immediately, the softness and warm coming back to my face. He was instantly confused. \u201cHurts, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened and betrayal and a different kind of hurt filled his face. \u201cIs this a joke to you?\u201d He snapped. \u201cIs that why you\u2019ve been avoiding me? For some petty kind of revenge? How old are you?!\u201d I scoffed, crossing my arms over my chest as my own anger exploded. \u201cDon\u2019t get angry at me, you have no right! You hurt me Y/n! For an entire week I suffered until it physically hurt with worry, getting sick to my stomach and having a panic attack! I had a panic attack! Sam finally told me to come here and tell you because he was worried about me. What the hell Y/n you had no right!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no right?\u201d I sneered, venom dripping from my words.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cYou actually hurt me. You left me.\u201d</p><p>My eyes watered. \u201cIt hurts, doesn\u2019t it? Being left behind without an explanation or clue? To go from hot and in love to absolutely nothing? Hurts to worry and strain and hurt with no answers or clue. Sitting there to just WORRY. Bella Swan literally went comatose from it. I barely made it myself. I couldn\u2019t even go to school for an entire week after you too me you never wanted to talk to me again. You didn\u2019t even look at me, you just told me. No emotion, no recognition. Like I was nothing.\u201d</p><p>He scrambled to defend himself but he was struggling as realization began to truly dawn on him. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to imprint on you! They said that I might, since we were like in love and stuff and I didn\u2019t want to drag you into this world. I also didn\u2019t want it to NOT be you. I was terrified, more than I was of imprinting on you, that I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Tears began falling down my face and his anger dissipated in favor of pain, worry, and guilt. \u201cYou promised you would never leave me, Em. That you would never hurt me. And then you left. And THEN you hurt me in every possible fucking way.\u201d He looked away, his face contorting in severe pain. \u201cI forgive you,\u201d I whispered. \u201cAnd my anger and immaturity got the best of me, I just\u2026 I wanted you to understand. Understand how much it hurt. I\u2019m sorry, but\u2026 Em\u2026\u201d He looked at me again as my words were broken by my cries that had turned to sobs. \u201cPlease don\u2019t do that again. Don\u2019t hurt me again.

It was heavy and thick, but not awkward. We left the beach altogether, moving to the street and then past, to the woods. We walked through the green a long while before I started getting nervous. Irrational fears began creeping in, eating away at my edges.</p><p>Was he going to kill me? Was he going to taunt me? Make fun of me? See how far he could push me until I snapped? Maybe he didn&rsquo;t actually care about me or have his feelings back. Maybe this was a prank. Maybe that gang of his had turned him into a total ass. And a good liar. Maybe he was just seeing how far I would follow him before I realized he was pulling my leg. Maybe he was dragging me out far as I would let him before he took advantage of how vulnerable and exposed I was and took advantage of me and-</p><p>Okay there. I needed to calm down. I watched his arms swing, the steps he took. They seemed heavier, as he was more tired than I&rsquo;d known him to be. He was never one to have the best sleeping schedule but it was regular and not too bad. Six hours every night, sometimes more. And&hellip; sometimes less. He seemed like he&rsquo;d been getting a regular three or four these days. His shoulders sagged a bit. He was taller, more muscley. Maybe they&rsquo;d had him getting up earlier and working out so he would be as fit as they needed for whatever shenanigans they got up to?</p><p>I imagined my Embry in a gang. Getting everybody to pull pranks or rough housing with the other boys. Sharing secrets and making friendships, his smile wide as his eyes found me with a soft smile on his face at the end of the day. I imagined him, without me by his side. Watching me from a distance, wanting me but for some reason never approaching me. I imagined him trying to be lose, good friends with people he didn&rsquo;t know because for whatever reason he&rsquo;d left all those close to him behind.</p><p>Yeah. It didn&rsquo;t fit. He was awkward and often self conscious because he felt like he was really annoying, so though he was social and had quite a few acquaintances, he had two best friends and me. He kept his circle small and he liked it that way. The Four Musketeers. That way he could be as loud and immature and stupid and bothersome as he wanted and he knew that none of us would get genuinely, really bothered without telling him so.</p><p>Nothing made sense, and my curiosity finally became too much for me when I caught Embry&rsquo;s arm. I immediately pulled back though, hissing as he turned to me with a surprised expression as if he&rsquo;d forgotten I was there. &ldquo;Embry, you&rsquo;re hot!&rdquo; He smirked and I glared. For a second we were ourselves again but then we quickly returned to the him and me we were now. &ldquo;You know what I mean.&rdquo;</p><p>He sighed, running a hand through his hair. &ldquo;I guess here&rsquo;s a good a place as any.&rdquo; He huffed, nervousness rolling off of him in waves. He reached down and pulled his shirt off.</p><p>Spinning around, I covered my eyes. &ldquo;WHOA!&rdquo; My heart began racing wildly. &ldquo;Embry put your shirt back on, NOW!&rdquo;</p><p>Embry chuckled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re acting as if you&rsquo;ve never seen my shirtless before. I mean, you&rsquo;ve seen me naked.&rdquo;</p><p>To my horror, a burning blush was added to my fixation with his chest and how I didn&rsquo;t truly realized how much muscle he&rsquo;d gained until I could see every detail for myself. &ldquo;Yeah, well&hellip;&rdquo; I struggled, but just gave up and blurted, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s when we were having sex. We&rsquo;re not having sex right now.&rdquo;</p><p>Another chuckle and I wanted to slap him. &ldquo;Y/n, turn around.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I refused.</p><p>He sighed. &ldquo;Y/n, please. I&rsquo;m not going to hurt you, I promise, but I do have to show you something that you have to see for yourself for you to understand and believe me. Really understand and really believe me. Y/n please.&rdquo; He was pleading, his voice full of worry and stress, and I couldn&rsquo;t resist him. I turned, my hands dropping to my sides. The second I was looking, he took several steps back and then tensed.</p><p>And suddenly he was hunching, his body curling and rippling as he bent almost to breaking and then elongated, his bones themselves morphing into a new shape. It was horrible to watch as I worried he must be in an awful amount of pain, but before I could even finish the thought to call out for him or scream or race at him or anything, a wolf was standing where he had been and I had a whole new problem to worry.</p><p>My head was spinning wildly. A wolf? Embry&hellip; he was&hellip; a wolf? Wait what? My face was screwed up in confusion, and all I could think to feel was anger. But then it registered. Embry. Was a wolf. Oh my gosh! &ldquo;Werewolf,&rdquo; I whispered. He looked up at me, and the human like eyes of his threw me for a loop. I seemed to be working in slow motion, working through layers of honey to reach the conclusion I already had in my hands. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a werewolf.&rdquo;</p><p>Shook took over. Where fear or panic or anger would have taken place in other people&rsquo;s places, all I felt was exploding curiosity. Energized and ecstatic. My body was itching as I moved closer to him, slowly but nowhere near as slow as I should have or would have approached a regular wolf. My hand moved through his fir after reaching out, my eyes widening as realizing finally hit me and pushed me through that finally string of shock.</p><p>I tackled him to the ground, straddling his side as I looked up him up close. He huffed in surprise, caught completely off guard as my hands wandered, touching his feet and then legs, side and fur and nose and ears. &ldquo;Oh my gosh this is amazing. There are actual werewolves. You&hellip; you&rsquo;re a werewolf. That is amazing! Absolutely splendid! This is why you left, of course. And.. the heat,&rdquo; I realized, my hand resting between his ears as I paused, realizing. &ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re a wolf. Wolves, especially your size, radiate so much heat. That&rsquo;s amazing!&rdquo; Mindlessly, my hand began to move on his head, my fingers scratching.</p><p>He whined, relaxing under my touch. I realized what I was doing and did it harder, scratching behind his ear. After a second I added my other hand- one had for each of his ears. &ldquo;Do you like that, boy?&rdquo; I asked gently.</p><p>He suddenly pulled his head away, grunting annoyedly. I realized that I was analyzing him like he was a scientific discovery and petting him like he was a dog and I lost it. I rolled off of him onto my back and then onto my side, curling my knees into my chest as I busted up into body wracking laughter. &ldquo;YOU LET ME PET YOU! YOU- YOU ENJOYED ME PETTING YOU!&rdquo;</p><p>He groaned and I closed my eyes, tears falling down my face. After a second, he reached over and a human hand touched me. He wore only a shirt and shorts, his jeans and shoes from earlier discarded off to the side. I began to calm down as he looked at me, kind of worried. &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;  The ghost of a smile tugged at his lips- true to the nature of our relationship, one of us could not laugh so hard and so genuinely without calling a smile at the vert least to the other.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay,&rdquo; I confirmed, wiping my face of the tears and forcing myself to sit up as I caught my breath. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&hellip; Tht must have been a weird reaction.&rdquo;</p><p>He grinned. &ldquo;Definitely not one we&rsquo;ve gotten before.&rdquo;</p><p>After a pause, I looked at him with intrigue. He rose an eyebrow. &ldquo;Do you turn on the full moon.&rdquo; And so questions began.</p><p>&ldquo;Only when we want to. Just like any other day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you have an alpha/omega/beta system like in the stories?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s-&ldquo; I cut off, realizing. &ldquo;Sam&rsquo;s alpha?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How often do you change?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Usually whenever we get upset or our heart race increases, but we can change whenever we want. Usually when there&rsquo;s a threat or for practice or routes&hellip; At least once every other day, on average.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What determines your fur color?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have&hellip; no idea.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How fast do you run?&rdquo; I immediately followed up.</p><p>He smirked. &ldquo;Faster than vampires.&rdquo;</p><p>My eyes went wide and he paled as he realized his mistake. &ldquo;Vampires?&rdquo; I asked weakly. He nodded wordlessly, allowing me space to process and think. I nodded after a second. &ldquo;Is that what you meant by threats I didn&rsquo;t know of?&rdquo; He nodded again. &ldquo;Do you guys only fight vampires?&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we were created. Kill the vampires, protect the humans.&rdquo;</p><p>That put me at ease. I trusted him to protect me, as much as I trusted him not to hurt m earlier when he was a wolf. I&hellip; I trusted him. I trusted Embry, with my life. Literally. Oh my gosh. &ldquo;What are vampires like?&rdquo; He explained the red versus gold eyes, telling me about the Cullens and then having to explain Bella and Edward. I was surprised to realize that things had gotten so far and once Embry explained the treaty, I was even more surprised that Sam was letting it happen. He told me about what did and didn&rsquo;t work so far as lure that I knew. Garlic, no. Crosses, not to his knowledge. Rip them apart and burn the bodies; they glitter in the sun. Created to be alluring to humans, like sirens pulling sailors to their death. &ldquo;Land sirens,&rdquo; I mused. He smiled, nodding. We&rsquo;d been going on forever and I thought I was out of questions and knew all there was to know&hellip; until something occurred to me. &ldquo;Embry?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; He asked. He had moved close and was playing with my fingers. I hadn&rsquo;t pulled away- it felt too good.</p><p>A little nervous, I asked quietly, &ldquo;Do wolves have mates? Because vampires have true mates and in the wild wolves have packs and mates and all that. Because, actual wolves don&rsquo;t have caste systems with alpha and all that, they just have families. Did you know that the guy who came up with the Alpha theory actually proved that he was wrong and told people he was wrong but no one listened? Anyway my point is that they&rsquo;re little families, with mates and cubs and loyalty like none of their. So&hellip; Does that translate over?&rdquo;</p><p>Embry let me babble and talk on as if he was stalling, but when the time came he looked up at me, that nervousness back in his eyes and posture where he&rsquo;d been so relaxed and content before. &ldquo;Y/n, I&hellip; I have something to tell you.&rdquo;</p><p><b>But moving on from him is impossible when I still see it all in my head: burning red! Burning it was red!</b></p><p>My eyes traced lines in the dirt. &ldquo;So you imprinted on me.&rdquo; I hadn&acute;t asked a question so he didn&rsquo;t say anything. A moment stretched on and I felt my insides grow heavy inside of me, dragging and pulling and getting all tangled up. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s painful for wolves to be away from their imprints, so Sam let you tell me.&rdquo; Embry still kept quiet. I looked up. &ldquo;Is there a way for you to undo it?&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes flared with pain. &ldquo;Do you want there to be?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It just feels&hellip; against your will. What if you hadn&rsquo;t imprinted on me? What if you had imprinted on someone else_ Would your feelings for me just have been completely wiped away as if they never mattered? Years of love and familiarity and beating the odds, just&hellip; gone.&rdquo; My stomach twisted tighter and I felt nauseated so I changed my train of thought. &ldquo;What if your imprint is way younger? Or way older?&rdquo;</p><p>That struck a cord - Embry flinched. &ldquo;When we&rsquo;re shifting regularly, we stop aging. Whenever we choose to shop shifting, we grow older. We learn to control our emotions and overtime, it gets harder to shift. And harder to control it once you do again. Like a muscle or a talent. If you don&rsquo;t use it, you get rusty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you stop aging until they&rsquo;re old enough?&rdquo; I asked, trying to understand how people worked out these problems. I mean, it&acute;s cool that they would do that for their imprint and that there was such a connection but it still didn&acute;t feel right.</p><p>&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;If they&rsquo;re older&hellip;&rdquo; He shrugged, awkwardness evident in his features. &ldquo;It sucks.&rdquo;</p><p>My eyes widened as that sunk in. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s horrible! What if I decided to take another path? No future is certain, no decisions are permanent. Love even changes over time and you change with it or it fails. What if we go to different colleges? What if it gets too weird with the age gap that were eventually going to have? What if we change and aren&rsquo;t compatible anymore? What if- what if I die? That&rsquo;s so much pressure. I have to stay close and in good condition or you wither away into a depressed morning? Embry&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>He looked really upset, and I wondered where we would be if he hadn&acute;t imprinted on me. I wondered where we would have been if we never met. Did the last years even matter if we would have ended in this same place anyway, twisted by fate and supernatural animalistic instinct and drive? I felt like I was breathing through a straw and he reached out, his hands flattening on my neck and the side of my face, his thumb caressing my jaw to soothe me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; he whispered with a broken voice. &ldquo;I know you hate being forced into things, and you really don&rsquo;t HAVE to be with me. Please don&rsquo;t be with me again if you really don&rsquo;t want to, I&rsquo;d rather anything than you forcing yourself to date me when you don&rsquo;t want to. I&rsquo;ll make friendship work, I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>I grew sad. &ldquo;Can you fall in love with anyone else? Ever?&rdquo;</p><p>He frowned. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>Pulling my face from his loving hold - unfortunately (I didn&acute;t want to but I needed a clear mind and Embry&acute;s touch gave me anything but, especially after so long when he touched me like that) - I sighed. &ldquo;I do love you, Em. And&hellip; I do trust you. I just-&ldquo; I was going to forgive him right there and end the tension. In the end, it didn&acute;t matter how we got here or what brought us together. As always, we prevailed despite everything being thrown at us. It wasn&rsquo;t worth hurting him if I knew I was fine anyway. But then I thought of the months of his disappearing. Months avoiding me, convincing me that he didn&rsquo;t care about me at all. And maybe I did want to forgive him, but not quite yet. &ldquo;I need some time to think about all of this. Process. Okay?&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded and we both stood. After a second I smiled, opening my arms and he moved into them, hugging me firmly but gently. It was wonderful. I breathed his scent in, listening to his heart beat as my ear pressed to his chest. &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he whispered.</p><p>I smiled. &ldquo;I know.&rdquo; I leaned away.  &ldquo;Walk me back to the beach?&rdquo;</p><p>Embry stepped away, nodding and smiling sadly. It almost made me want to stop&hellip; We made our way back to where we came from originally, and I snagged my bike from the ground, waving at Embry before taking off toward my house.</p><p>In actuality, I knew I loved and trusted Embry and that&acute;s all that matters. And maybe it was cruel or petty of me, but I wanted him just to squirm a little bit more. Know what it was like to have someone you love choose to not be with you. To doubt that you&acute;ll be with the person you would give anything for, go anywhere for, be anyone for. I wanted him to fear, just for a little bit, that he wouldn&acute;t have his promised happily ever after.</p><p>Laying in my bed, I put my phone face down and silenced. It had been an unspoken thing that I would text Embry I was safe when I got home. While we were together at least. Now, I&acute;m sure he assumed but I hadn&acute;t promised or established that I would continue the tradition, even though in any other circumstance I would have.</p><p>I felt a little mean, worrying him, but a part of me was still hurt and angry. If I couldn&acute;t stand to cut things off permanently but I also couldn&acute;t simply erase months of deep emotional pain, I saw this as a happy medium. Some classic, well planned, carried through revenge.</p><p>I loved the boy, but this almost felt good.</p><p>Was that cruel of me?</p><p>&hellip;Oops.</p><p><b>Oh losing him was blue like I&rsquo;d never known; Missing him was dark gray all alone. Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met &lsquo;cause loving him was red! Yeah, yeah red! We&rsquo;re burning red!</b></p><p>It took him an entire week to lose his shit.</p><p>After being okay with missing him for so long and knowing I could go back anytime I wanted, it was surprisingly easy for me to be away from Embry. I missed him, my body itching to make up all the time we&rsquo;d missed over the last few months, and I yearned to answer his texts and hang out with him and kiss him and hug him and UGH, but I had self control. I had learned it when all I&rsquo;d wanted to do was go to Embry&rsquo;s house, knock down his door, kiss him, and demand he stop whatever the hell he was doing&hellip; but I couldn&rsquo;t, because he&rsquo;d told me to never talk to him ever again.</p><p>After those six days, though, I lay awake at night thinking about Embry and remembering back to when we&rsquo;d been together when a sharp and inconsistent tapping sounded on my window. Not tapping like fingers against the glad, but&hellip; I looked over, jumping when a pebble the size of my pinkie fingers came in contact with the glass. It was thin but still! I scrambled out of bed, moving to the window. I looked out and immediately saw Embry, who was pacing anxiously as he messed with the rock in his hands, breathing hard as he looked about ready to have a panic attack.</p><p>Because I lived in a one story house, I didn&rsquo;t know why he didn&rsquo;t just knock on my window, but maybe he was as much of a romantic as I remembered. I opened my window. &ldquo;Em?&rdquo;</p><p>He turned to me, relaxing at the sound of my voice as if it alone had flipped a switch in him. He itched to move to me, I could see it, and I smiled, moving aside too let him crawl in through my window. He didn&rsquo;t hesitate even a split second, moving to go through before I was even out all of the way. Once he was in, I closed my window again. I turned to him and he looked at me. &ldquo;Have you decided to avoid me then? Because I mean I definitely understand why but could you have at least told me? I&rsquo;ve been wondering-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be with you, Embry,&rdquo; I deadpanned. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to talk to you ever again.&rdquo; I wasn&rsquo;t looking at him, the exact same a he had treated me when he told me. My voice was hard and rough and he took a step back. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to ever see you again.&rdquo;</p><p>He whimpered. &ldquo;Y/n, please&hellip; it hurts to be away from you. Not just because of the wolf thing, but knowing that I can have you back. I asked Sam. He said it&rsquo;s different than it was with Emily. Moving faster, affecting more severely. It&rsquo;s me, Y/n. It&rsquo;s ME that hurts to be away from you. ME that loves you. Let&rsquo;s just be friends?&rdquo;</p><p>Turning to him, I looked him in the eyes. His glasses over, watering, as he prepare for me to totally reject him. I could see the loss in his eyes without me having to the say the words, and I could see his heart break. That was when I dropped it all. I stopped immediately, the softness and warm coming back to my face. He was instantly confused. &ldquo;Hurts, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes widened and betrayal and a different kind of hurt filled his face. &ldquo;Is this a joke to you?&rdquo; He snapped. &ldquo;Is that why you&rsquo;ve been avoiding me? For some petty kind of revenge? How old are you?!&rdquo; I scoffed, crossing my arms over my chest as my own anger exploded. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get angry at me, you have no right! You hurt me Y/n! For an entire week I suffered until it physically hurt with worry, getting sick to my stomach and having a panic attack! I had a panic attack! Sam finally told me to come here and tell you because he was worried about me. What the hell Y/n you had no right!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I had no right?&rdquo; I sneered, venom dripping from my words.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. &ldquo;You actually hurt me. You left me.&rdquo;</p><p>My eyes watered. &ldquo;It hurts, doesn&rsquo;t it? Being left behind without an explanation or clue? To go from hot and in love to absolutely nothing? Hurts to worry and strain and hurt with no answers or clue. Sitting there to just WORRY. Bella Swan literally went comatose from it. I barely made it myself. I couldn&rsquo;t even go to school for an entire week after you too me you never wanted to talk to me again. You didn&rsquo;t even look at me, you just told me. No emotion, no recognition. Like I was nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>He scrambled to defend himself but he was struggling as realization began to truly dawn on him. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to imprint on you! They said that I might, since we were like in love and stuff and I didn&rsquo;t want to drag you into this world. I also didn&rsquo;t want it to NOT be you. I was terrified, more than I was of imprinting on you, that I wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>Tears began falling down my face and his anger dissipated in favor of pain, worry, and guilt. &ldquo;You promised you would never leave me, Em. That you would never hurt me. And then you left. And THEN you hurt me in every possible fucking way.&rdquo; He looked away, his face contorting in severe pain. &ldquo;I forgive you,&rdquo; I whispered. &ldquo;And my anger and immaturity got the best of me, I just&hellip; I wanted you to understand. Understand how much it hurt. I&rsquo;m sorry, but&hellip; Em&hellip;&rdquo; He looked at me again as my words were broken by my cries that had turned to sobs. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t do that again. Don&rsquo;t hurt me again. I couldn&rsquo;t survive it again.&rdquo;</p><p>He rushed at me, pulling me into him and holding me tightly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re even now,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;You forgave me, so I can forgive you. We both fucked up, both with very good reasons for doing so.&rdquo; He sighed. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t ever hurt you again Y/n. Not like that. I promise for real this time. I won&rsquo;t let anything come between us again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What if you die?&rdquo; I ask softly.</p><p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t be my fault,&rdquo; he answers even more softly. &ldquo;I promise I&rsquo;ll try my hardest, though.&rdquo;</p><p>I buried my face in his chest, clinging to his shirt. &ldquo;I can be okay with that.&rdquo;</p><p>We had a long way to go, but&hellip; maybe things could be okay now. We had each other, so there was always that.</p><p>-</p><p>Forever Tag List: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlBd-WaK7BasX3MeySuDOzQ\">@bitchyseawitch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZ-9MTTp-87OMQrs3VnIAdA\">@chipster-21</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0FFm1xHm69D76Lc1wSzv9g\">@alexa-playafricabytoto</a> </p></p>",
