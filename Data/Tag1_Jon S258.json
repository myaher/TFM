I can acknowledge that he has flaws and at the\nsame time try to see things from his POV. </p><p>As a book reader, my favorite Jon\nrelationship is with Arya. I am a sucker for good big brother/little sister \u00a0relationships and Jon-Arya is one of the best sibling\nrelationships present in the book. In fact I would go ahead and say that Jon-Arya\nis the best and most important relationship in the books, period. They love\neach other unconditionally and it\u2019s healthy and all things good. \u00a0I mean, how can folks read things like this:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>Needle was Jon Snow\u2019s\nsmile.</i></b><i> <b>He used to mess my hair and call me \u201clittle sister,\u201d she\nremembered, and suddenly there were tears in her eyes.</b></i></p><p><b><i>Bring her home, Mance&hellip; You owe\nme this one little girl. </i></b></p><p><b><i>What do you know of my heart,\npriestess? What do you know of my sister?</i></b></p></blockquote><p>and not love them! I wish they would meet up soon and if there\nis one thing I am desperately looking forward to next season, it\u2019s Jon and Arya\nreuniting again. If D&amp;D mess this up, you can expect me to write long\nranting essays on here about it!</p><p>And well, Jon and Ghost are pretty much about a boy and his dog and I love them to bits. Ghost is a part of Jon and I am glad he is around next season. And I love Jon\u2019s bromance with Sam - best friends forever! <br/></p><p>Now, coming to Jonerys, I knew\nthat Jon/Dany would eventually meet and the books had foreshadowed some sort of\nan alliance between them. My favorite characters have always been Jon and Arya\nand while I liked Dany, I was not exactly all that invested in her story. Until\nlast season that is. </p><p>And man, did I like her last\nseason. The Lannisters have heaped untold misery on the Starks and Westeros for\n7 seasons now and seeing Dany on Drogon and her Dothraki army crush them in\nbattle was orgasmic. I was hoping for her to defeat Cersei/Jaime\nand cursing Tyrion for fucking up everything with his stupid plans.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>And well, I liked Jon and Dany\u2019s\nburgeoning relationship. After two seasons of Sansa constantly telling Jon that\nhe knows nothing and questioning his every\ndecision, it was refreshing to have someone ask Jon for advice!\u00a0 As per\nSophie Turner\u2019s comments at Comic Con \u2013 <i>\u201c[Sansa]\ndoesn\u2019t think he [Jon] has the intellect, the knowledge, and the experience\nthat she has, and I concur</i>.\u201d This reflects in Sansa\u2019s behavior towards Jon\nwhere she thinks that Jon should do as she says because she knows better. </p><p>\n\nBut Jon is an intelligent, pragmatic leader. As\nSam Tarly put it, he was elected twice to lead the Night\u2019s Watch and the North.\nHe ended an eight thousand year feud between the NW and the Wildlings, uniting\nthe Free Folk with the North. He tried to make common cause with the enemy\nBoltons in order to unite against the White Walkers. People like Davos and\nLyanna Mormont follow him because they see him as a true leader. Gendry just\nmet the guy and he is immediately loyal. Jon has that effect on people. Theon\npoints out how Jon always does the right thing \u2013 no matter how hard it is to do\nit. Jon understands the sanctity of treaties and deals\nand is pretty much the only leader in Westeros who holds true to his words.</p><p>And I like that Dany recognizes\nthis and respects Jon\u2019s \u2018intellect, knowledge and experience\u2019. She ignores\nTyrion and asks Jon what he thinks she should do. And then takes his advice and\nattacks the Lannister/Tyrell army instead of KL. Towards the end, she\ntakes his advice of sailing together to WF, overruling Jorah\u2019s suggestion. I\nlove it when characters acknowledge that Jon is a smart leader. I liked\nthat she rushed North to save Jon, Jorah and the rest of them against Tyrion\u2019s\nadvice. I liked her telling Jon that though she disagreed with his announcement\nin the dragonpit, she respected his decision to do so. </p><p>I liked that Jon was\ndiplomatic and treated Dany with respect as well \u2013 offering her his advice as a\nsuggestion and leaving it up to her whether to take it or not. </p><p>I just loved the way Emilia\nClarke played Dany falling for Jon. She was like a young girl falling in love for\nthe first time. The way she asked Tyrion \u2013 \u2018And what does the KITN want with\nDragon glass?\u2019 \u2013 it was like she found the KITN to be frustratingly cute and lovable despite having an obsession with the army of the dead!\nOr when she softly said \u2018 you better get to work Jon Snow\u2019 or how she could not\nhide her excitement at sailing together with Jon. I loved season 7 Dany. </p><p>I love that Jon now has the\nsupport of the most powerful leader in Westeros. It was getting a bit tiresome\nto constantly hear about how the Vale army was only there for Sansa. Well, Jon has\nnow come North with the dragon queen, dragons, thousands of Dothraki and\nUnsullied, some great advisers and fighters. If Yohn Royce and the Vale wants\nto support someone else as leader, they are welcome to do so. Jon would be able\nto manage just fine without them. <br/></p><p>And considering all the constant\nhate Dany has got here on Tumblr, I find myself defending her more and more.\nAnd it\u2019s had the effect of making me like Dany all the more. Dany now joins the\nranks of Jon and Arya as one of my favorite characters in the series. And well\nJon loves her and I like the characters who make him happy and appreciate him for\nwho he is. </p><p>So that\u2019s my perspective on why\nas a Jon fan, I like the Jon-Dany relationship. I know folks are going to be\nrolling their eyes at the effusive praise I have heaped on Jon! But hey, he\u2019s\nmy fave and I think he deserves everything good so there it is \ud83d\ude0a</p>",

I can acknowledge that he has flaws and at the\nsame time try to see things from his POV. </p><p>As a book reader, my favorite Jon\nrelationship is with Arya. I am a sucker for good big brother/little sister \u00a0relationships and Jon-Arya is one of the best sibling\nrelationships present in the book. In fact I would go ahead and say that Jon-Arya\nis the best and most important relationship in the books, period. They love\neach other unconditionally and it\u2019s healthy and all things good. \u00a0I mean, how can folks read things like this:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>Needle was Jon Snow\u2019s\nsmile.</i></b><i> <b>He used to mess my hair and call me \u201clittle sister,\u201d she\nremembered, and suddenly there were tears in her eyes.</b></i></p><p><b><i>Bring her home, Mance\u2026 You owe\nme this one little girl. </i></b></p><p><b><i>What do you know of my heart,\npriestess? What do you know of my sister?</i></b></p></blockquote><p>and not love them! I wish they would meet up soon and if there\nis one thing I am desperately looking forward to next season, it\u2019s Jon and Arya\nreuniting again. If D&amp;D mess this up, you can expect me to write long\nranting essays on here about it!</p><p>And well, Jon and Ghost are pretty much about a boy and his dog and I love them to bits. Ghost is a part of Jon and I am glad he is around next season. And I love Jon\u2019s bromance with Sam - best friends forever! <br></p><p>Now, coming to Jonerys, I knew\nthat Jon/Dany would eventually meet and the books had foreshadowed some sort of\nan alliance between them. My favorite characters have always been Jon and Arya\nand while I liked Dany, I was not exactly all that invested in her story. Until\nlast season that is. </p><p>And man, did I like her last\nseason. The Lannisters have heaped untold misery on the Starks and Westeros for\n7 seasons now and seeing Dany on Drogon and her Dothraki army crush them in\nbattle was orgasmic. I was hoping for her to defeat Cersei/Jaime\nand cursing Tyrion for fucking up everything with his stupid plans.\u00a0 <br></p><p>And well, I liked Jon and Dany\u2019s\nburgeoning relationship. After two seasons of Sansa constantly telling Jon that\nhe knows nothing and questioning his every\ndecision, it was refreshing to have someone ask Jon for advice!\u00a0 As per\nSophie Turner\u2019s comments at Comic Con \u2013 <i>\u201c[Sansa]\ndoesn\u2019t think he [Jon] has the intellect, the knowledge, and the experience\nthat she has, and I concur</i>.\u201d This reflects in Sansa\u2019s behavior towards Jon\nwhere she thinks that Jon should do as she says because she knows better. </p><p>\n\nBut Jon is an intelligent, pragmatic leader. As\nSam Tarly put it, he was elected twice to lead the Night\u2019s Watch and the North.\nHe ended an eight thousand year feud between the NW and the Wildlings, uniting\nthe Free Folk with the North. He tried to make common cause with the enemy\nBoltons in order to unite against the White Walkers. People like Davos and\nLyanna Mormont follow him because they see him as a true leader. Gendry just\nmet the guy and he is immediately loyal. Jon has that effect on people. Theon\npoints out how Jon always does the right thing \u2013 no matter how hard it is to do\nit. Jon understands the sanctity of treaties and deals\nand is pretty much the only leader in Westeros who holds true to his words.</p><p>And I like that Dany recognizes\nthis and respects Jon\u2019s \u2018intellect, knowledge and experience\u2019. She ignores\nTyrion and asks Jon what he thinks she should do. And then takes his advice and\nattacks the Lannister/Tyrell army instead of KL. Towards the end, she\ntakes his advice of sailing together to WF, overruling Jorah\u2019s suggestion. I\nlove it when characters acknowledge that Jon is a smart leader. I liked\nthat she rushed North to save Jon, Jorah and the rest of them against Tyrion\u2019s\nadvice. I liked her telling Jon that though she disagreed with his announcement\nin the dragonpit, she respected his decision to do so. </p><p>I liked that Jon was\ndiplomatic and treated Dany with respect as well \u2013 offering her his advice as a\nsuggestion and leaving it up to her whether to take it or not. </p><p>I just loved the way Emilia\nClarke played Dany falling for Jon. She was like a young girl falling in love for\nthe first time. The way she asked Tyrion \u2013 \u2018And what does the KITN want with\nDragon glass?\u2019 \u2013 it was like she found the KITN to be frustratingly cute and lovable despite having an obsession with the army of the dead!\nOr when she softly said \u2018 you better get to work Jon Snow\u2019 or how she could not\nhide her excitement at sailing together with Jon. I loved season 7 Dany. </p><p>I love that Jon now has the\nsupport of the most powerful leader in Westeros. It was getting a bit tiresome\nto constantly hear about how the Vale army was only there for Sansa. Well, Jon has\nnow come North with the dragon queen, dragons, thousands of Dothraki and\nUnsullied, some great advisers and fighters. If Yohn Royce and the Vale wants\nto support someone else as leader, they are welcome to do so. Jon would be able\nto manage just fine without them. <br></p><p>And considering all the constant\nhate Dany has got here on Tumblr, I find myself defending her more and more.\nAnd it\u2019s had the effect of making me like Dany all the more. Dany now joins the\nranks of Jon and Arya as one of my favorite characters in the series. And well\nJon loves her and I like the characters who make him happy and appreciate him for\nwho he is. </p><p>So that\u2019s my perspective on why\nas a Jon fan, I like the Jon-Dany relationship. I know folks are going to be\nrolling their eyes at the effusive praise I have heaped on Jon! But hey, he\u2019s\nmy fave and I think he deserves everything good so there it is \ud83d\ude0a</p>",
