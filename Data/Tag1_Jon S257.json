        "body": "<p>I recently read some speculation that Jon shares some parallels with Cleopatra, and that set me thinking. Cleopatra is an undeniably complex figure, but I think Dany is the one who has far more in common with the infamous Queen of Egypt, and this may play into how she is perceived by the Northern Lords.</p><p>To be clear, I am going to be talking about Cleopatra in terms of how the Romans perceived her as well as the historical record, and the Romans really were not big fans of her. We good? We good. <br/></p><p>Cleopatra was the product of Ptolemy dynasty of Egypt, and who were descended from the Greek general who served under Alexander the Great that they take their name from. They blended Hellenic and native Egyptian customs, particularly the practice of marrying siblings. Cleopatra herself was married to her brother, \n Ptolemy XIII. Immediately, the Valyrian and later Targaryen practice of brothers wedding sisters comes to mind. The Ptolemies had more than fair share of infighting, sabotage, and incompetence. Cleoptatra\u2019s father, Ptolemy XII, had a reputation for debauchery and earned the nickname of Auletes (Flute player) due to his participation in the celebrations of Dionysus, the Greek god of partying hard. He was wildly unpopular due to his licentiousness and, more notably, his heavy taxes.\u00a0 Cleopatra\u2019s older sisters Cleopatra Tryphaena and\u00a0\n\n Berenice would stage a coup against their father and rule as Queens. Auletes fled to exile in Rome, likely with Cleopatra in tow, and much like Viserys, spent time brown nosing for support. Unlike Viserys, Auletes did retake the throne with the support of Rome, but he was dependent on a foreign power to keep his throne. <br/></p><p>The early similarities to Dany really stand out here. Both are from a ruling dynasty that conquered their foreign subjects and practiced incest to maintain power. Both are daughters of unpopular kings who are overthrown and are forced into exile. <br/></p><p>Cleopatra would steadily gain power over her father, and eventually became his co-regent, similar to how Dany gained the ability to stand up to Viserys and recognized the power she had as Khaleesi. Cleopatra would succeed her father with her brother-husband as co-ruler. She and her younger siblings would begin to fight over the throne, and a civil war erupted again. Her brother Ptolemy and her sister Arisnoe IV would both fight against her, and it is highly likely that Cleopatra was involved in their deaths. Again, there are similarities to Dany\u2019s own involvement in her brother\u2019s death. Cleopatra would take sole control of Egypt, in no small part due to her alliance with Julius Caesar. <br/></p><p>Cleopatra was also known to be very charismatic, and inspired loyalty very easily, bringing to mind Dany\u2019s own devoted following. Accounts of Cleopatra\u2019s looks varied wildly but she was purported to be beautiful, just as Dany is often described as the most beautiful women in the world as her own fame grows. <br/></p><p>So, now I want to talk about Cleopatra was viewed by the Romans, especially after her death, and how this may play into the North\u2019s perception of Dany.</p><p>Cleopatra had not one, but two Roman husbands. Both Julius Caesar and Mark Antony were influential Roman statesmen and generals. Her downfall came when after the death of Julius Caesar, she allied herself with Mark Antony against Octavian, Caesar\u2019s great-nephew and adopted son. <br/></p><p>Since Octavian became the first Roman Emperor and renamed himself Augustus, I bet you can guess who won the war. (There\u2019s also a Shakespeare play about it. It\u2019s a tragedy. Shock.)</p><p>But Octavian and the Roman Empire are largely responsible for image of Cleopatra as the beautiful and exotic foreign seductress Queen. Because Mark Antony was still wildly popular in Rome, Cleopatra was smeared as the wicked femme fatale who seduced Antony away from Rome and his lawful wife (by the way, Mark Antony was married to Octavia, Octavian\u2019s sister). Cleopatra was systematically villified and othered. She was also blamed for ruining Julius Caesar, and being the power hungry seductress who convinced him to seize control of the Republic and ultimately got him killed (let\u2019s be honest, JC got himself killed.). The exotic nature of Egypt was played up (Orientalism at it\u2019s finest, folks) and she was painted as the licentious queen of a strange and very un-Roman people. And a woman ruling a kingdom! The madness of it all!<br/></p><p>Everything was the whore Cleopatra\u2019s fault, and poor Mark Antony had fallen into her trap, just as Julius Caesar had. <br/></p><p>Keep in mind that Cleopatra\u2019s enemies are the ones who won and wrote all this stuff down. As Julius Caesar\u2019s heir, Octavian had to clear his adopted father\u2019s name somehow, and he probably personally believed it (He loved his sister Octavia, and was not thrilled that Antony ran off with Cleopatra). He also had to get Rome on board with fighting against Mark Antony.<br/></p><p>So if Dany is Cleopatra, a foreign and formidable queen, and since she has been sleeping with their king who just turned over power to her&hellip;</p><p>The North, a kingdom already highly suspicious of outsiders (for good reason), is not going to be thrilled with her. <br/></p><p>Dany really is an outsider in Westeros. She has spent her entire life in Essos and is from a dynasty that did very unWesterosi things (incest and polygamy). <br/></p><p>It also has to be noted that in the show, Robb falls in love with not Jeyne Westerling, but Talisa Maegyr, a woman from Volantis.

We good? We good. <br></p><p>Cleopatra was the product of Ptolemy dynasty of Egypt, and who were descended from the Greek general who served under Alexander the Great that they take their name from. They blended Hellenic and native Egyptian customs, particularly the practice of marrying siblings. Cleopatra herself was married to her brother, \n Ptolemy XIII. Immediately, the Valyrian and later Targaryen practice of brothers wedding sisters comes to mind. The Ptolemies had more than fair share of infighting, sabotage, and incompetence. Cleoptatra\u2019s father, Ptolemy XII, had a reputation for debauchery and earned the nickname of Auletes (Flute player) due to his participation in the celebrations of Dionysus, the Greek god of partying hard. He was wildly unpopular due to his licentiousness and, more notably, his heavy taxes.\u00a0 Cleopatra\u2019s older sisters Cleopatra Tryphaena and\u00a0\n\n Berenice would stage a coup against their father and rule as Queens. Auletes fled to exile in Rome, likely with Cleopatra in tow, and much like Viserys, spent time brown nosing for support. Unlike Viserys, Auletes did retake the throne with the support of Rome, but he was dependent on a foreign power to keep his throne. <br></p><p>The early similarities to Dany really stand out here. Both are from a ruling dynasty that conquered their foreign subjects and practiced incest to maintain power. Both are daughters of unpopular kings who are overthrown and are forced into exile. <br></p><p>Cleopatra would steadily gain power over her father, and eventually became his co-regent, similar to how Dany gained the ability to stand up to Viserys and recognized the power she had as Khaleesi. Cleopatra would succeed her father with her brother-husband as co-ruler. She and her younger siblings would begin to fight over the throne, and a civil war erupted again. Her brother Ptolemy and her sister Arisnoe IV would both fight against her, and it is highly likely that Cleopatra was involved in their deaths. Again, there are similarities to Dany\u2019s own involvement in her brother\u2019s death. Cleopatra would take sole control of Egypt, in no small part due to her alliance with Julius Caesar. <br></p><p>Cleopatra was also known to be very charismatic, and inspired loyalty very easily, bringing to mind Dany\u2019s own devoted following. Accounts of Cleopatra\u2019s looks varied wildly but she was purported to be beautiful, just as Dany is often described as the most beautiful women in the world as her own fame grows. <br></p><p>So, now I want to talk about Cleopatra was viewed by the Romans, especially after her death, and how this may play into the North\u2019s perception of Dany.</p><p>Cleopatra had not one, but two Roman husbands. Both Julius Caesar and Mark Antony were influential Roman statesmen and generals. Her downfall came when after the death of Julius Caesar, she allied herself with Mark Antony against Octavian, Caesar\u2019s great-nephew and adopted son. <br></p><p>Since Octavian became the first Roman Emperor and renamed himself Augustus, I bet you can guess who won the war. (There\u2019s also a Shakespeare play about it. It\u2019s a tragedy. Shock.)</p><p>But Octavian and the Roman Empire are largely responsible for image of Cleopatra as the beautiful and exotic foreign seductress Queen. Because Mark Antony was still wildly popular in Rome, Cleopatra was smeared as the wicked femme fatale who seduced Antony away from Rome and his lawful wife (by the way, Mark Antony was married to Octavia, Octavian\u2019s sister). Cleopatra was systematically villified and othered. She was also blamed for ruining Julius Caesar, and being the power hungry seductress who convinced him to seize control of the Republic and ultimately got him killed (let\u2019s be honest, JC got himself killed.). The exotic nature of Egypt was played up (Orientalism at it\u2019s finest, folks) and she was painted as the licentious queen of a strange and very un-Roman people. And a woman ruling a kingdom! The madness of it all!<br></p><p>Everything was the whore Cleopatra\u2019s fault, and poor Mark Antony had fallen into her trap, just as Julius Caesar had. <br></p><p>Keep in mind that Cleopatra\u2019s enemies are the ones who won and wrote all this stuff down. As Julius Caesar\u2019s heir, Octavian had to clear his adopted father\u2019s name somehow, and he probably personally believed it (He loved his sister Octavia, and was not thrilled that Antony ran off with Cleopatra).

Meanwhile, Daenerys is recovering from betrayal in Qarth and planning her next move toward the home she longs for.</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6dVcVsFUNiVjAKX8wqv8_Q\">@waking-dreams-of-harmony</a> prompted me forever ago with a similar prompt. I know, I know, I already have several other WIPs, but this one was fun to start! Enjoy!<br/></p><p><br/></p><!-- more --><p><br/></p><p>Jon woke to pain. A pounding pain in the\nback of his head, a throb in his thigh, another in his shoulder. Along with the\npain came grief. <i>Ygritte</i>. As the Free\nFolk approached the Wall, Jon returned to the man he\u2019d always been: a man of\nthe Night\u2019s Watch and son of Eddard Stark. And Ygritte, the wildling girl who\ncajoled and teased and shoved him into loving her &hellip;</p><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s a crow! He\u2019s always been a crow!\u201d \u00a0</i>Noise.\nA woman\u2019s harsh voice. Tormund\u2019s deep bellow.<i> </i></p><p><i>\u201cTake him! Kill him!\u201d</i> </p><p>The wet squelch as he\nshoved Longclaw through Orell. </p><p>Sharp eagle talons\nshredding his face. </p><p>Ygritte\u2019s eagle-sharp\nblue eyes, tears falling as she drew her bow. </p><p>The bay horse\u2019s stride\nfaltered, Jon didn\u2019t even see the blow that felled him. Then &hellip; then there\nwas nothing. Only a red-black darkness, sickening vertigo, a nauseating\nlurching.</p><p><i>\u201cWhere\u2019s the sword? It\u2019s Valyrian steel!\u201d </i>Numb fingers clenched around Longclaw. Another blow\nsmote his face. A sickening crunch and the hot trickle of blood down his mouth.\nJon\u2019s fingers loosened and the sword slipped from his grasp. He mourned the\nloss. Since he\u2019d been gifted the sword, it grew to be a part of him. <i>I\u2019m sorry, Lord Commander.</i> </p><p>Jon cracked open one eyelid. Wooden\nslats greeted him, the familiar rumble of wooden wheels on a gravel road. <i>A cart?</i> Even that proved too exhausting,\nand he slipped back into blood-warm darkness. He reached for Ghost, missing his\nquiet, unassuming company. There was the faintest white glimmer on the edges of\nhis thoughts, but too far away. So far &hellip;</p><p>Rough laughter woke him.</p><p>\u201cNice of you to join\nus, your lordship!\u201d the face of a dirty man Jon didn\u2019t recognize swam before\nhis blurred vision. He blinked, confused. The man wasn\u2019t wearing a wildling\u2019s\nmotley furs, but ragged homespun. His eyelids felt so heavy &hellip; The man\nreached and stuck his finger into the arrow wound in Jon\u2019s shoulder, dirty\nfingernail biting deep. Pain was a hot, sharp jolt. Jon cried out, straining\nagainst the leather cords binding his hands and feet together. </p><p>\u201cI need you to stay\nawake now, bastard. Oh yes, those wildling scum told me all about you. The\npretty bastard with the Valyrian steel sword.\u201d The finger dug deeper, and Jon\nfelt hot blood dampen the grimy furs he wore. His flesh shrieked in pain. He\nclenched his jaw around another cry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m a man of the\nNight\u2019s Watch. If you go to Castle Black, they\u2019ll ransom me,\u201d Jon spat the\nwords around the pain. His voice was dry, reedy. The man removed his finger,\nwiping the blood on Jon\u2019s clothes. He threw his head back to laugh, a shrill,\nharsh sound, revealing several rotted teeth. The man had a pointed chin, a\nlong, pointed nose, like a rat\u2019s. Jon scowled in disgust.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d like that,\nwouldn\u2019t you? \u2018Take me to Castle Black!\u2019 he says. They\u2019ll behead me before I\ncould get a word in. No, we\u2019re headed to Eastwatch, pretty bastard.\u201d</p><p>Jon loathed\nthe cart. Its bed was padded with a thin layer of straw, which jabbed him\nthrough his ragged furs and itched horribly. The cold penetrated his very\nmarrow. Beneath the open sky, the intermittent rains and snow left him soaked\nand chilled. He hated this <i>fucking</i> cart.\nIts wheels caught every stone or pothole and his wounds complained with each\njolt. </p><p>As time passed with Jon blinking away stray flakes of snow, he sought to\nanchor himself from the monotony of travel. Under his breath, he named off the\ngreat houses of Westeros and their house words, hearing Maester Luwin\u2019s voice\nin his inner ear. He rattled off every animal he knew, every herb, every name,\nevery lineage. Jon slept and woke, ate the jerky thrown to him by the Rat, and\nslept again in unending motion and pain. When the cart did stop, he relieved\nhimself as best he could manage. He refused to simply lie in his own filth.\nEach attempt left him trembling and sweating with fatigue. By the fourth day\u2014or\nwas it the third?\u2014he could barely feed himself. \n</p><p>As the cart lurched on, Jon turned his thoughts to sigils. The image of\nthe Targaryen banner rose in his mind\u2019s eye. Black cloth, sinuous and liquid as\nink, stitched with image of a crimson dragon. Muscular, rippling, as if alive. <i>Fire and Blood</i>. Tongues of red,\nflickering at the wind\u2019s touch. The <i>fire</i>!\nHeat assaulted him, as if his marrow had been replaced with the molten blood of\nthe earth. Through cracked lips and with a leaden tongue, he said, \u201cWater. I\nneed water.\u201d The Rat ignored him. </p><p>Jon clawed at the furs, allowing the wind and snow to baptize him in\nsweet relief. He opened his mouth, catching stray flakes on his sticky tongue.\nThe pain in his shoulder and leg were like second heartbeats, louder and more\ninsistent than the one in his chest. His broken nose throbbed, the cuts on his\nface felt raw. He curled onto his side, wracked by chills. Cold. So cold. His\nteeth chattered in his skull. The furs were soaked, freezing. He wormed beneath\nthe straw like a grub trying to escape the harsh sun.</p><p>\u201cHelp me,\u201d Jon whispered. His captor, his brothers, his gods, all far\naway, deaf to him. The wind howling in his ears was his only answer. </p><p>The cart jostled hard, wooden wheels clattering on cobblestones. He\nstruggled to open his eyelids against the sharp cold night, wincing at the\nsudden writhing brilliance of torches. Harsh male voices, rough hands hauling\nhim from the cart. All of it felt far away, as if he were already a shade.</p><p>\u201cWhat a bloody mess! What am I to do with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he dead?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSeven hells, he stinks!\u201d</p><p>The hands grasping him yanked his shoulder and hot pain tore through\nhim, anchoring him to his body. Jon howled, cracked lips bleeding, his voice\nraw and aching. He screamed and fought until darkness took him.</p><p>A low, mellow\nvoice singing woke him. Where was he? Where was the Rat taking him? Could he\nloosen these bonds? The thoughts proved too heavy for him to bear, so he lost\nhimself in the hoarse undulations of the man\u2019s voice. He heard the faint chime\nof poured water. A dry, burning ache flared to life in his throat. He licked\ncracked, bloody lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jon opened his eyes. The small\ntimber room was ablaze with dazzling sunlight, stabbing his eyes. He shut them,\npierced by the clean warmth that surrounded him after so many long days of lack\nand suffering. He must have slept, for when he opened his eyes again, night had\nfallen, a fire casting leaping shadows on the rough-hewn ceiling. Dimly, he\nrealized he was clean. The furs had been replaced by a simple wool tunic, he\nwas still bound, and the pain was better. This time, Jon found strength enough\nto turn his head.</p><p>A long-robed man with a gleaming bald pate stood with his back to Jon,\nstoking the brazier.</p><p>\u201cWater,\u201d Jon croaked. The man turned and Jon narrowed his eyes. He was\ndressed in the black robes of a maester, but wore no chain. His suspicion\namused the other man, for he chuckled.</p><p>\u201cHighhanded for one in your position, aren\u2019t you? What\u2019s your name?\u201d he\nasked. His was the voice he\u2019d heard singing, as mellow as brown ale. Jon\nscowled. The false maester jiggled the water jug in front of Jon\u2019s face,\nwearing a smug grin. A bloody bully, just like Allister Thorne and Rast. </p><p>\u201cIf you want to drink, you\u2019ll have to learn to behave. Now, your name?\u201d </p><p>Jon deliberately lifted his gaze to stare at the ceiling. As he did so,\nhe glimpsed Longclaw leaning against the far wall. The craven chuckled.</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself, but defiance won\u2019t do you any favors when Vogaro lo\nMorrgys arrives.\u201d His sour bulk leaned over Jon, inspecting his nose and the\nwounds to his face. Jon flinched, testing the slack on the bonds. The cords had\nbeen traded for leather cuffs around wrist and ankle tethered by coarse rope to\nthe plank bench he laid on. Thick belts strapped him down across waist and\nchest. Jon swallowed, his burning throat already regretting his petty defiance.\nAt least he could breathe through his nose without pain.</p><p>\u201cThe cuts will scar, but your nose should heal nicely.\u201d </p><p>The man peeled aside the tunic. Jon clenched his jaw hard. How long\nwould he have to endure this man pawing at him? The puncture of Ygritte\u2019s arrow\nwas only two neat stitches, as was the wound to his thigh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen worse. You\u2019re healing nicely.\u201d The false maester\u2019s fingers\ntrailed along Jon\u2019s thigh, making his skin crawl. His hands curled into\nwhite-knuckled fists. At least the Rat had only been negligent.</p><p>\u201cWhen will this man arrive?\u201d Jon asked. </p><p>\u201cDawn. Can\u2019t be caught by patrolling crows, hmm?\u201d the man said, flicking\nthe hem of the tunic back down. Some of the tension bled from Jon, his mind\nwhirring. </p><p>Eastwatch, on the Narrow Sea. Easy enough for a ship to sail north from\nthe Free Cities. There was no reason for his captors to tend him unless &hellip;\nhe shuddered at the thought. <i>Unless they\nwished to </i>sell<i> him</i>. How was it so\neasy? Being the son of a great house, a man of the Night\u2019s Watch, born\nfree\u2014though a bastard\u2014it meant nothing if men like these still existed in the\nworld. </p><p>This Morrgys would wish to inspect him, surely, maybe see if he could\nfight. They would loosen the bonds then. It was his only chance to escape. Jon\ngrasped onto the thought with both hands, mooring his hopes to it. The\nalternative didn\u2019t bear thinking of. Mercifully, the false maester left the\nroom, locking the room with a crank of an iron key. In his solitude, Jon\npondered his options. Longclaw may as well be on the other side of the world\nfor all the help it offered at the moment. </p><p>Jon flexed his right arm, straining against the cuff. It held, obstinate.\n<i>A week in a bloody cart did me no favors</i>.\nJon tested the bonds at his feet. No luck. Then the left arm &hellip; at his third\ndetermined pull, the bond gave just an inch. There was a faint jingle of iron.\nThe cuffs were tied to rings on the plank. Jon sank back, panting. Just that\nmeager effort exhausted him. A glance at the window found it still deep dark,\nlikely the hour of the wolf. He had time enough to try. He had to. He had only\none chance.</p><p>\u201cWake up, pretty bastard! I\u2019ve got a present for you,\u201d the Rat\u2019s whining\nvoice woke him from a thin slumber. Jon\u2019s eyelids snapped open as the key\nturned in the lock. The soft grey of dawn filtered through the window shutters.\n<i>One chance</i>. He lay still as the Rat\nand the false maester filed in the room, followed by a squat man with\namber-brown skin, a great fist of a nose and a cloud of red-black hair. His\nwealth was evident in the silver embroidery of his leathers, the jeweled rings\non each of his fat fingers. The Rat gave a shrill laugh.</p><p>\u201cLook what I have for you, Good Master. A young, pretty crow!\u201d The\n\u2018Master\u2019 scowled down his nose at the Rat, dark eyes scrutinizing. Jon met his\ngaze unflinchingly, he was a free man to the bone, to the marrow. <i>Blood of the North. Blood of the Kings of\nWinter. Now come closer. Closer, now.</i></p><p>\u201cCrow? What is this word?\u201d The words emerged garbled, as if he had\nmarbles in his mouth. He gestured with a whip whose handle gleamed in the\nbrazier\u2019s light, the figure of a grotesque woman with a bat\u2019s wings and\nscorpion\u2019s tail.</p><p>\u201cThat is the name some northmen give members of the Night\u2019s Watch, who\nguard the Wall, Good Master,\u201d the false maester said, with an obsequious little\nbow. <i>Worm</i>.</p><p>\u201cI see. You did not lie, he is pretty. Good enough for the pleasure\nhouses of Lys or Yunkai if trained. But you say he\u2019s a fighter?\u201d Jon\u2019s guts\nfroze. Horrors compounded and multiplied. <i>Pleasure\nhouses?</i></p><p>\u201cYes. The wildlings sold him to us after he killed some of their number.\nAnd he has this,\u201d the Rat said, picking up Longclaw. The master shrank back\nfrom the blade with a hiss.</p><p>\u201cValyrian steel,\u201d The Master spat the words like curses, though his\ntrembling hands closed over the sheath.</p><p>\u201cUnparalleled in its sharpness and durability,\u201d he said, touching the\nsteel with a wondering finger. That fat finger touched the white wolf pommel. \u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Zokla timpa</i>,\u201d he said,\nsheathing Longclaw with a sharp snap. He reached into his coat and dropped\nthree heavy pouches on the table. </p><p>\u201cFor the sword.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the crow?\u201d the Rat asked. The Master glanced at Jon and tossed\nanother pouch on the table. </p><p>\u201cBring him down. I\u2019ll see how he does against my Dothraki. If he loses,\nI can still sell him in Lys, if he wins, he might have potential,\u201d he said,\nleaving the room without another word. </p><p>Jon took a deep breath. The master had taken his weapon, but he was\nconfident he could overpower the other two men if he caught them surprise. </p><p>\u201cToday\u2019s your lucky day, crow!\u201d the Rat said, unbuckling one foot. The\nfalse maester slid the tongues of the belts across his torso free.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be sad to see you go. We had so little time together,\u201d he said,\nleering. Jon waited, summoning every bit of his patience. He only had one\nchance. He couldn\u2019t lunge too early &hellip; The Rat freed his other foot. The\nfalse maester bent to untie his left hand and\u2014Jon surged upright, kicking the\nRat hard in the belly. Before the maester had time to cry out, Jon slammed the\nback of his fist into the man\u2019s face. Jon felt a crunch, and the man fell\ninsensate. Jon untied his right hand as the Rat gasped for air, wheezing for\nhelp.</p><p>\u201cI guess it is my lucky day,\u201d Jon said, darting behind the Rat and\nlooping his arm around his head. He <i>squeezed</i>.\nThe Rat clawed and thrashed beneath him, but as skinny as he was, the blows\nwere ineffectual. Face set in a rictus of effort, Jon squeezed his head until the\nRat lay inert. Then the room echoed with only his own harsh breathing. </p><p>He waited, straining to hear the thump of coming footsteps. None. Good.\nJon snatched the water jug and gulped thirstily. The cold water was sweet\nrelief to his parched throat. He drained it and another jug. Barefoot and\nunarmed, a quick glance at the two men brought up no options. The Rat was too\nsmall and skinny, and the false maester wore sandals. Neither man wore so much\nas an eating knife. <i>Seven hells. </i></p><p>Jon slipped from the room. They were in one of the Watch\u2019s abandoned\noutbuildings, he could tell by the neat builder\u2019s stonework and the air of\nneglect. Not Eastwatch per se, that was one of the castles still patrolled by\nthe Watch, but nearby. All he needed was a horse, then he could ride hell for\nleather north. They were still his sworn brothers, after all. </p><p>Jon crept soft-footed down the hall, tucking close into a lintel at the\nfaint clatter of footsteps. He didn\u2019t have long until either the Rat came to or\nthe slaver\u2019s guards came sniffing about. Measuring his breathing, Jon waited.\nNervous energy sang through his muscles, the stone floor dusty and achingly\ncold beneath his bare feet. The footsteps came no closer, faintly he heard the\nrasp of a foreign language through a nearby shutter. Jon exhaled his breath.\nNot much time now. </p><p>He followed the hall, ran into a dead-end, turned back, took another\nturn, and then another. Another hallway led him to a stairway, curved out of\nsight. He wasted precious moments deliberating. If he barreled down the stair,\nhe could catch whoever might be below by surprise &hellip; or raise the alarm in\nthe process. <i>Might as well chance it,\nthey\u2019re going to find those men any moment</i>. Jon padded down the stairs, two\nat a time. He sniffed through his battered nose. Was that &hellip; ? The room,\nperhaps once a receiving hall, stood converted to a stable. The humble scent of\nhay and horse manure made tears prick his eyes. Thanking the gods for at last a\nstroke of luck, Jon found a shaggy sorrel, tugging hay from a net. Thin and\nrangy, the sorrel looked fast, energetic. </p><p>\u201cCome on now. Let\u2019s go for a ride, yeah?\u201d he whispered, freeing the slip\nknot with a stealthy tug. The horse followed without demur, allowing Jon to\nswing astride. No time to rummage for tack, the halter would have to do for a\nbridle. Jon clicked his tongue, wrapping his legs snug against the horse\u2019s warm\nsides. Jon ducked beneath the rooftree just as a great shout sounded behind\nhim: \u201cThe crow\u2019s escaped! Find him!\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Jon kicked the sorrel\u2019s ribs, laying the halter lead against his neck to\nslew him left. Outside there was a sparse courtyard, once there had been a wall\nencircling the sad ruin of a tower, but now there was only a crumble of mortar.\nA glance cut behind him found a scrum of movement, a hail of cursing. </p><p>A garble of harsh words sounded much closer. From the tail of his eye,\nJon glimpsed a galloping warrior through a screen of his flying hair. <i>Dothraki</i>. With a shrill, undulating\nyell, the Dothraki urged his mount close, his black, curved blade cruel in the\nearly light. On instinct, Jon slid down the side of his mount, clinging with\nall the strength in his legs as the blade parted the air. The blow swung wide\nand the sorrel cantered through a patch of prickling weeds as Jon righted\nhimself.</p><p>A faint\ntwang. </p><p>With a squeal, the sorrel crumpled beneath him. Jon landed hard, white\nbursting behind his eyes. A hard blow on his shoulder and side, then tumbling\nend over end until he landed on his back. Air wheezed from his lungs. Gasping\nfor breath, Jon rolled to his hands and knees, staggering to his feet. The\nsorrel lay dead; the bolt took him square between the eyes. Jon whirled around\nfinding the \u2018master\u2019 holding a crossbow and laughing. Most galling, Longclaw\nwas sheathed at his fat waist. <i>That\u2019s\nmine!</i></p><p>\u201cMorbo, this Westerosi boy makes you look a fool on your horse! Let\u2019s\nsee what you do with him! If you live, boy, you\u2019ll make me rich!\u201d he shouted. </p><p>The Dothraki\u2014Morbo\u2014dismounted his tall dun mount, murder stamped on a\nthin face. Jon found a chunk of stone, coarse against his palm. He hefted it,\ntesting the sting in his shoulder. Morbo marched through the scrubby brush, his\nstrange half-staff, half-scythe blade twisting in whistling circles. Jon cast a\nquick glance around, finding the ground sharply slanted, jagged crumbles of\nmasonry scattered about. A poor place for a fight. The Dothraki snarled\nsomething in his own tongue, the sound harsh and guttural. <i>I have only one chance before he hacks me to bits.</i> </p><p>\u201cCome on then!\u201d Jon shouted. </p><p>With no shield, he had to be faster than the blade. Burning with\nembarrassment, Morbo would want to end the fight quick and decisive. That might\nmake him sloppy. The Dothraki led with a sharp horizontal sweep, with enough\nforce to take his head clean off. Jon ducked, intending to slam the rock into\nthe other man\u2019s ches&mdash;the staff end of his blade smote Jon hard in the ear.\nHead ringing, blood in his mouth, Jon staggered back. He tripped on a rough\nstone, landing hard on his arse. Something like amusement lit Morbo\u2019s black eyes,\na thin contemptuous smile on his lips. Jon sucked blood from his split lip and\nspat it in the direction of the Dothraki\u2019s boot. Confident in victory, Morbo\nraised his blade overhead and\u2014</p><p>Jon struck. He kicked out hard, knocking Morbo to his knees. Scrambling\nfast, Jon reared back and backhanded the Dothraki with his rock. Blood flew in\na thin red arch from Morbo\u2019s mouth as he fell. In the dirt, he spat out the\nbloodied fragment of a molar. The so-called \u2018master\u2019 wheezed with laughter,\nmopping his face with a square of silk. </p><p>\u201cExcellent! You <i>are</i> a fighter.\nYou\u2019ll do well in the pits.\u201d </p><p>He clapped his hands, and half a dozen men approached from all\ndirections armed with clubs. Gods, how had he not noticed them closing in? Jon\ntook up the fallen Dothraki\u2019s staff-sword. It felt foreign in his hand, but he\nhad to try. He lunged, bringing the blade down on the smallest one. The blade\nbit deep, slicing clean through the arm. </p><p>The \u2018master\u2019 laughed as his men bled and died. <i>No, no, gods no</i>! One blow smote his shoulder. Snarling, Jon struck\nout, eviscerating the man who struck him. The sword felt keen and sharp in his\nhand. Another hail of blows fell on his back, his knee, his head. The world\nblurred, pain made him half-blind, but he was caught in a hot, red tide of desperation.\nDenial pounded along with his heartbeat. <i>No,\nno, no!</i> </p><p>The last\nthing he saw was a bloodied Morbo standing over him, looking on with something\nlike pity.</p><p>~</p><p>Daenerys\nbeckoned Drogon with a click of her tongue. The hatchling dragon perched on her\nright shoulder crept down her arm with a prickle of claws. He curled in her\npalm, his tail wrapped around her wrist. He was getting bigger and heavier with\neach passing day. Daenerys petted the frilled spikes along his neck.</p><p>\u201cAny ideas on how to sail south?\u201d she asked with an arched brow. Drogon\nflapped his wings, hissing as if to reply. Her children weren\u2019t strong enough\nto fly yet, so Daenerys tucked Drogon into his enclosure in the cool shadow\nbeneath Qarth\u2019s walls. Dust and sand lay coarse on her tongue. The air smelled\nstrange, like after a lightning strike. Magic left a faint itching prickle on\nher skin. The warlocks had paid dearly for imprisoning her. </p><p>Daenerys smoothed her hands over each of her children, their scales as\nwarm and smooth as sunwarmed river stones, reassuring herself of their solid\nwholeness. Never in all her days did she want to feel that aching emptiness\nwhen they were taken from her. Viserion preened, nestling his head into her\nhand. Rhaegal snorted, smoke curling from the slits of his nostrils.</p><p>\u201c<i>Khaleesi</i>,\u201d Rakharo said,\nswaggering up with his whip coiled over one arm.</p><p>\u201c<i>Qoy Qoyi</i>,\u201d Daenerys said,\n\u201cany word from Jorah the Andal?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Vos, khaleesi</i>,\u201d he said.\nDaenerys exhaled a breath through her nostrils. Ser Jorah had been sent to the\ncoast to secure a ship over a fortnight ago when she Xaro Xohan Daxos\u2019s\nhospitality.</p><p>\u201cWe cannot linger here much longer,\u201d she said, half to herself. Rakharo\ngrunted in reply, swinging astride his black.</p><p>\u201cI see to the herd, khaleesi!\u201d he said. A touch of his heel sent the\nblack cantering around their motley caravan. Mixed Dothraki travois housed the\npeople that remained of her khalasar after the Red Waste and Qarth\u2019s duplicity.\n</p><p>Daenerys heaved a sigh, swinging astride her silver. At least their\nfortunes had improved. True, Doreah\u2019s duplicity with their Qartheen host had\nled to the murder of Jhiqui and many others, but the richest man in Qarth had\nnot exaggerated his wealth. That, in addition to the horses and gifts pressed\nupon them by the remaining merchants\u2014eager to see the back of her and thankful\nfor her dragons ridding them of Pyatt Pree. Her Dothraki insisted on adding\nanother braid, though the victory had been Drogon\u2019s. \u00a0</p><p>When the sun climbed to its zenith and heat rose in colorless ribbons\nfrom the ground and still Ser Jorah had not returned, Daenerys gave to command\nto move out. The shadow of the warlock\u2019s tower gave her a queer feeling in her\nbelly. Piquant and bored, the three of her children cried and scratched at the\ngates of their enclosure. Having them close was as much an anchor to her as\nthem. Daenerys licked her dry lips, grateful for Drogon\u2019s weight on her right\nshoulder. Rheagal and Viserion climbed and slithered over her. </p><p>\u201c<i>Lyks</i>,\u201d she said, stilling her\nsilver\u2019s startled snort with a tug of rein. The gates of Qarth were flown open.\nPale faces and watery eyes watched from the shade of their glorious towers as\nthey rode by.</p><p>\u201cMilk Men hide like cowards,\u201d Kovarro said, hacking a glob of spit onto\nthe neatly manicured street.</p><p>\u201cWould you rather we win free by the skin of our teeth as in the House\nof the Undying, blood of my blood?\u201d Daenerys said dryly, tossing a flyaway\nstrand of hair from her face. Kovarro\u2019s thick shoulders hunched beneath his\nwarm medium brown skin.</p><p>\u201c<i>Vos, khaleesi</i>,\u201d he said,\nchastened. The youngest of her bloodriders, Kovarro was often the most eager to\ntest his mettle. Even his name was derived from the Dothraki word <i>kovarat</i> which meant \u2018to stand.\u2019 As such,\nshe could not fault him too greatly. <i>A\nman cannot deny what it is in his nature.</i> The Sand Road stretched out ahead\nof them, a bleak expanse of crushed reddish gravel. Beyond were endless crags,\nmountains of scorched red sand, stunted trees, scorpions and snakes. The air\ntasted of dust and death, even the water bled red. Was she mad to urge her\npeople to face that again? It was a testament to their faith in her that they\nrode on with scarcely a whimper of protest. \n</p><p>Daenerys\u2019 belly quavered at the baking heat of the Red Waste as Qarth\u2019s\ngates slammed closed behind them. She remembered how the heat leeched the\nstrength from her bones, the starving burning thirst that made her head ache\nand eyes burn. It had been a close thing, before Xaro Xohan Daxos took pity\nupon her. The void waited, so cool and patient.</p><p>\u201cWhich way, khaleesi?\u201d Rakharo asked. Daenerys eased back in the saddle,\nhalting the khalasar with a gesture. She drummed her fingers on the pommel of\nher saddle. The decision held their lives in the balance. Not one made lightly.\n</p><p>\u201cWe ride west.\u201d To the next city, and the next. And beyond that, Westeros\nand home. \u00a0 </p>",

A pounding pain in the\nback of his head, a throb in his thigh, another in his shoulder. Along with the\npain came grief. <i>Ygritte</i>. As the Free\nFolk approached the Wall, Jon returned to the man he\u2019d always been: a man of\nthe Night\u2019s Watch and son of Eddard Stark. And Ygritte, the wildling girl who\ncajoled and teased and shoved him into loving her \u2026</p><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s a crow! He\u2019s always been a crow!\u201d \u00a0</i>Noise.\nA woman\u2019s harsh voice. Tormund\u2019s deep bellow.<i> </i></p><p><i>\u201cTake him! Kill him!\u201d</i> </p><p>The wet squelch as he\nshoved Longclaw through Orell. </p><p>Sharp eagle talons\nshredding his face. </p><p>Ygritte\u2019s eagle-sharp\nblue eyes, tears falling as she drew her bow. </p><p>The bay horse\u2019s stride\nfaltered, Jon didn\u2019t even see the blow that felled him. Then \u2026 then there\nwas nothing. Only a red-black darkness, sickening vertigo, a nauseating\nlurching.</p><p><i>\u201cWhere\u2019s the sword? It\u2019s Valyrian steel!\u201d </i>Numb fingers clenched around Longclaw. Another blow\nsmote his face. A sickening crunch and the hot trickle of blood down his mouth.\nJon\u2019s fingers loosened and the sword slipped from his grasp. He mourned the\nloss. Since he\u2019d been gifted the sword, it grew to be a part of him. <i>I\u2019m sorry, Lord Commander.</i> </p><p>Jon cracked open one eyelid. Wooden\nslats greeted him, the familiar rumble of wooden wheels on a gravel road. <i>A cart?</i> Even that proved too exhausting,\nand he slipped back into blood-warm darkness. He reached for Ghost, missing his\nquiet, unassuming company. There was the faintest white glimmer on the edges of\nhis thoughts, but too far away. So far \u2026</p><p>Rough laughter woke him.</p><p>\u201cNice of you to join\nus, your lordship!\u201d the face of a dirty man Jon didn\u2019t recognize swam before\nhis blurred vision. He blinked, confused. The man wasn\u2019t wearing a wildling\u2019s\nmotley furs, but ragged homespun. His eyelids felt so heavy \u2026 The man\nreached and stuck his finger into the arrow wound in Jon\u2019s shoulder, dirty\nfingernail biting deep. Pain was a hot, sharp jolt. Jon cried out, straining\nagainst the leather cords binding his hands and feet together. </p><p>\u201cI need you to stay\nawake now, bastard. Oh yes, those wildling scum told me all about you. The\npretty bastard with the Valyrian steel sword.\u201d The finger dug deeper, and Jon\nfelt hot blood dampen the grimy furs he wore. His flesh shrieked in pain. He\nclenched his jaw around another cry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m a man of the\nNight\u2019s Watch. If you go to Castle Black, they\u2019ll ransom me,\u201d Jon spat the\nwords around the pain. His voice was dry, reedy. The man removed his finger,\nwiping the blood on Jon\u2019s clothes. He threw his head back to laugh, a shrill,\nharsh sound, revealing several rotted teeth. The man had a pointed chin, a\nlong, pointed nose, like a rat\u2019s. Jon scowled in disgust.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d like that,\nwouldn\u2019t you? \u2018Take me to Castle Black!\u2019 he says. They\u2019ll behead me before I\ncould get a word in. No, we\u2019re headed to Eastwatch, pretty bastard.\u201d</p><p>Jon loathed\nthe cart. Its bed was padded with a thin layer of straw, which jabbed him\nthrough his ragged furs and itched horribly. The cold penetrated his very\nmarrow. Beneath the open sky, the intermittent rains and snow left him soaked\nand chilled. He hated this <i>fucking</i> cart.\nIts wheels caught every stone or pothole and his wounds complained with each\njolt. </p><p>As time passed with Jon blinking away stray flakes of snow, he sought to\nanchor himself from the monotony of travel. Under his breath, he named off the\ngreat houses of Westeros and their house words, hearing Maester Luwin\u2019s voice\nin his inner ear. He rattled off every animal he knew, every herb, every name,\nevery lineage. Jon slept and woke, ate the jerky thrown to him by the Rat, and\nslept again in unending motion and pain. When the cart did stop, he relieved\nhimself as best he could manage. He refused to simply lie in his own filth.\nEach attempt left him trembling and sweating with fatigue. By the fourth day\u2014or\nwas it the third?\u2014he could barely feed himself. \n</p><p>As the cart lurched on, Jon turned his thoughts to sigils. The image of\nthe Targaryen banner rose in his mind\u2019s eye. Black cloth, sinuous and liquid as\nink, stitched with image of a crimson dragon. Muscular, rippling, as if alive. <i>Fire and Blood</i>. Tongues of red,\nflickering at the wind\u2019s touch. The <i>fire</i>!\nHeat assaulted him, as if his marrow had been replaced with the molten blood of\nthe earth. Through cracked lips and with a leaden tongue, he said, \u201cWater. I\nneed water.\u201d The Rat ignored him. </p><p>Jon clawed at the furs, allowing the wind and snow to baptize him in\nsweet relief. He opened his mouth, catching stray flakes on his sticky tongue.\nThe pain in his shoulder and leg were like second heartbeats, louder and more\ninsistent than the one in his chest. His broken nose throbbed, the cuts on his\nface felt raw. He curled onto his side, wracked by chills. Cold. So cold. His\nteeth chattered in his skull. The furs were soaked, freezing. He wormed beneath\nthe straw like a grub trying to escape the harsh sun.</p><p>\u201cHelp me,\u201d Jon whispered. His captor, his brothers, his gods, all far\naway, deaf to him. The wind howling in his ears was his only answer. </p><p>The cart jostled hard, wooden wheels clattering on cobblestones. He\nstruggled to open his eyelids against the sharp cold night, wincing at the\nsudden writhing brilliance of torches. Harsh male voices, rough hands hauling\nhim from the cart. All of it felt far away, as if he were already a shade.</p><p>\u201cWhat a bloody mess! What am I to do with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he dead?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSeven hells, he stinks!\u201d</p><p>The hands grasping him yanked his shoulder and hot pain tore through\nhim, anchoring him to his body. Jon howled, cracked lips bleeding, his voice\nraw and aching. He screamed and fought until darkness took him.</p><p>A low, mellow\nvoice singing woke him. Where was he? Where was the Rat taking him? Could he\nloosen these bonds? The thoughts proved too heavy for him to bear, so he lost\nhimself in the hoarse undulations of the man\u2019s voice. He heard the faint chime\nof poured water. A dry, burning ache flared to life in his throat. He licked\ncracked, bloody lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jon opened his eyes. The small\ntimber room was ablaze with dazzling sunlight, stabbing his eyes. He shut them,\npierced by the clean warmth that surrounded him after so many long days of lack\nand suffering. He must have slept, for when he opened his eyes again, night had\nfallen, a fire casting leaping shadows on the rough-hewn ceiling. Dimly, he\nrealized he was clean. The furs had been replaced by a simple wool tunic, he\nwas still bound, and the pain was better. This time, Jon found strength enough\nto turn his head.</p><p>A long-robed man with a gleaming bald pate stood with his back to Jon,\nstoking the brazier.</p><p>\u201cWater,\u201d Jon croaked. The man turned and Jon narrowed his eyes. He was\ndressed in the black robes of a maester, but wore no chain. His suspicion\namused the other man, for he chuckled.</p><p>\u201cHighhanded for one in your position, aren\u2019t you? What\u2019s your name?\u201d he\nasked. His was the voice he\u2019d heard singing, as mellow as brown ale. Jon\nscowled. The false maester jiggled the water jug in front of Jon\u2019s face,\nwearing a smug grin. A bloody bully, just like Allister Thorne and Rast. </p><p>\u201cIf you want to drink, you\u2019ll have to learn to behave. Now, your name?\u201d </p><p>Jon deliberately lifted his gaze to stare at the ceiling. As he did so,\nhe glimpsed Longclaw leaning against the far wall. The craven chuckled.</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself, but defiance won\u2019t do you any favors when Vogaro lo\nMorrgys arrives.\u201d His sour bulk leaned over Jon, inspecting his nose and the\nwounds to his face. Jon flinched, testing the slack on the bonds. The cords had\nbeen traded for leather cuffs around wrist and ankle tethered by coarse rope to\nthe plank bench he laid on. Thick belts strapped him down across waist and\nchest. Jon swallowed, his burning throat already regretting his petty defiance.\nAt least he could breathe through his nose without pain.</p><p>\u201cThe cuts will scar, but your nose should heal nicely.\u201d </p><p>The man peeled aside the tunic. Jon clenched his jaw hard. How long\nwould he have to endure this man pawing at him? The puncture of Ygritte\u2019s arrow\nwas only two neat stitches, as was the wound to his thigh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen worse. You\u2019re healing nicely.\u201d The false maester\u2019s fingers\ntrailed along Jon\u2019s thigh, making his skin crawl. His hands curled into\nwhite-knuckled fists. At least the Rat had only been negligent.</p><p>\u201cWhen will this man arrive?\u201d Jon asked. </p><p>\u201cDawn. Can\u2019t be caught by patrolling crows, hmm?\u201d the man said, flicking\nthe hem of the tunic back down. Some of the tension bled from Jon, his mind\nwhirring. </p><p>Eastwatch, on the Narrow Sea. Easy enough for a ship to sail north from\nthe Free Cities. There was no reason for his captors to tend him unless \u2026\nhe shuddered at the thought. <i>Unless they\nwished to </i>sell<i> him</i>. How was it so\neasy? Being the son of a great house, a man of the Night\u2019s Watch, born\nfree\u2014though a bastard\u2014it meant nothing if men like these still existed in the\nworld. </p><p>This Morrgys would wish to inspect him, surely, maybe see if he could\nfight. They would loosen the bonds then. It was his only chance to escape. Jon\ngrasped onto the thought with both hands, mooring his hopes to it. The\nalternative didn\u2019t bear thinking of. Mercifully, the false maester left the\nroom, locking the room with a crank of an iron key. In his solitude, Jon\npondered his options. Longclaw may as well be on the other side of the world\nfor all the help it offered at the moment. </p><p>Jon flexed his right arm, straining against the cuff. It held, obstinate.\n<i>A week in a bloody cart did me no favors</i>.\nJon tested the bonds at his feet. No luck. Then the left arm \u2026 at his third\ndetermined pull, the bond gave just an inch. There was a faint jingle of iron.\nThe cuffs were tied to rings on the plank. Jon sank back, panting. Just that\nmeager effort exhausted him. A glance at the window found it still deep dark,\nlikely the hour of the wolf. He had time enough to try. He had to. He had only\none chance.</p><p>\u201cWake up, pretty bastard! I\u2019ve got a present for you,\u201d the Rat\u2019s whining\nvoice woke him from a thin slumber. Jon\u2019s eyelids snapped open as the key\nturned in the lock. The soft grey of dawn filtered through the window shutters.\n<i>One chance</i>. He lay still as the Rat\nand the false maester filed in the room, followed by a squat man with\namber-brown skin, a great fist of a nose and a cloud of red-black hair. His\nwealth was evident in the silver embroidery of his leathers, the jeweled rings\non each of his fat fingers. The Rat gave a shrill laugh.</p><p>\u201cLook what I have for you, Good Master. A young, pretty crow!\u201d The\n\u2018Master\u2019 scowled down his nose at the Rat, dark eyes scrutinizing. Jon met his\ngaze unflinchingly, he was a free man to the bone, to the marrow. <i>Blood of the North. Blood of the Kings of\nWinter. Now come closer. Closer, now.</i></p><p>\u201cCrow? What is this word?\u201d The words emerged garbled, as if he had\nmarbles in his mouth. He gestured with a whip whose handle gleamed in the\nbrazier\u2019s light, the figure of a grotesque woman with a bat\u2019s wings and\nscorpion\u2019s tail.</p><p>\u201cThat is the name some northmen give members of the Night\u2019s Watch, who\nguard the Wall, Good Master,\u201d the false maester said, with an obsequious little\nbow. <i>Worm</i>.</p><p>\u201cI see. You did not lie, he is pretty. Good enough for the pleasure\nhouses of Lys or Yunkai if trained. But you say he\u2019s a fighter?\u201d Jon\u2019s guts\nfroze. Horrors compounded and multiplied. <i>Pleasure\nhouses?</i></p><p>\u201cYes. The wildlings sold him to us after he killed some of their number.\nAnd he has this,\u201d the Rat said, picking up Longclaw. The master shrank back\nfrom the blade with a hiss.</p><p>\u201cValyrian steel,\u201d The Master spat the words like curses, though his\ntrembling hands closed over the sheath.</p><p>\u201cUnparalleled in its sharpness and durability,\u201d he said, touching the\nsteel with a wondering finger. That fat finger touched the white wolf pommel. \u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Zokla timpa</i>,\u201d he said,\nsheathing Longclaw with a sharp snap. He reached into his coat and dropped\nthree heavy pouches on the table. </p><p>\u201cFor the sword.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the crow?\u201d the Rat asked. The Master glanced at Jon and tossed\nanother pouch on the table. </p><p>\u201cBring him down. I\u2019ll see how he does against my Dothraki. If he loses,\nI can still sell him in Lys, if he wins, he might have potential,\u201d he said,\nleaving the room without another word. </p><p>Jon took a deep breath. The master had taken his weapon, but he was\nconfident he could overpower the other two men if he caught them surprise. </p><p>\u201cToday\u2019s your lucky day, crow!\u201d the Rat said, unbuckling one foot. The\nfalse maester slid the tongues of the belts across his torso free.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be sad to see you go. We had so little time together,\u201d he said,\nleering. Jon waited, summoning every bit of his patience. He only had one\nchance. He couldn\u2019t lunge too early \u2026 The Rat freed his other foot. The\nfalse maester bent to untie his left hand and\u2014Jon surged upright, kicking the\nRat hard in the belly. Before the maester had time to cry out, Jon slammed the\nback of his fist into the man\u2019s face. Jon felt a crunch, and the man fell\ninsensate. Jon untied his right hand as the Rat gasped for air, wheezing for\nhelp.</p><p>\u201cI guess it is my lucky day,\u201d Jon said, darting behind the Rat and\nlooping his arm around his head. He <i>squeezed</i>.\nThe Rat clawed and thrashed beneath him, but as skinny as he was, the blows\nwere ineffectual. Face set in a rictus of effort, Jon squeezed his head until the\nRat lay inert. Then the room echoed with only his own harsh breathing. </p><p>He waited, straining to hear the thump of coming footsteps. None. Good.\nJon snatched the water jug and gulped thirstily. The cold water was sweet\nrelief to his parched throat. He drained it and another jug. Barefoot and\nunarmed, a quick glance at the two men brought up no options. The Rat was too\nsmall and skinny, and the false maester wore sandals. Neither man wore so much\nas an eating knife. <i>Seven hells. </i></p><p>Jon slipped from the room. They were in one of the Watch\u2019s abandoned\noutbuildings, he could tell by the neat builder\u2019s stonework and the air of\nneglect. Not Eastwatch per se, that was one of the castles still patrolled by\nthe Watch, but nearby. All he needed was a horse, then he could ride hell for\nleather north. They were still his sworn brothers, after all. </p><p>Jon crept soft-footed down the hall, tucking close into a lintel at the\nfaint clatter of footsteps. He didn\u2019t have long until either the Rat came to or\nthe slaver\u2019s guards came sniffing about. Measuring his breathing, Jon waited.\nNervous energy sang through his muscles, the stone floor dusty and achingly\ncold beneath his bare feet. The footsteps came no closer, faintly he heard the\nrasp of a foreign language through a nearby shutter. Jon exhaled his breath.\nNot much time now. </p><p>He followed the hall, ran into a dead-end, turned back, took another\nturn, and then another. Another hallway led him to a stairway, curved out of\nsight. He wasted precious moments deliberating. If he barreled down the stair,\nhe could catch whoever might be below by surprise \u2026 or raise the alarm in\nthe process. <i>Might as well chance it,\nthey\u2019re going to find those men any moment</i>. Jon padded down the stairs, two\nat a time. He sniffed through his battered nose. Was that \u2026 ? The room,\nperhaps once a receiving hall, stood converted to a stable. The humble scent of\nhay and horse manure made tears prick his eyes. Thanking the gods for at last a\nstroke of luck, Jon found a shaggy sorrel, tugging hay from a net. Thin and\nrangy, the sorrel looked fast, energetic. </p><p>\u201cCome on now. Let\u2019s go for a ride, yeah?\u201d he whispered, freeing the slip\nknot with a stealthy tug. The horse followed without demur, allowing Jon to\nswing astride. No time to rummage for tack, the halter would have to do for a\nbridle. Jon clicked his tongue, wrapping his legs snug against the horse\u2019s warm\nsides. Jon ducked beneath the rooftree just as a great shout sounded behind\nhim: \u201cThe crow\u2019s escaped! Find him!\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Jon kicked the sorrel\u2019s ribs, laying the halter lead against his neck to\nslew him left. Outside there was a sparse courtyard, once there had been a wall\nencircling the sad ruin of a tower, but now there was only a crumble of mortar.\nA glance cut behind him found a scrum of movement, a hail of cursing. </p><p>A garble of harsh words sounded much closer. From the tail of his eye,\nJon glimpsed a galloping warrior through a screen of his flying hair. <i>Dothraki</i>. With a shrill, undulating\nyell, the Dothraki urged his mount close, his black, curved blade cruel in the\nearly light. On instinct, Jon slid down the side of his mount, clinging with\nall the strength in his legs as the blade parted the air. The blow swung wide\nand the sorrel cantered through a patch of prickling weeds as Jon righted\nhimself.</p><p>A faint\ntwang. </p><p>With a squeal, the sorrel crumpled beneath him. Jon landed hard, white\nbursting behind his eyes. A hard blow on his shoulder and side, then tumbling\nend over end until he landed on his back. Air wheezed from his lungs. Gasping\nfor breath, Jon rolled to his hands and knees, staggering to his feet. The\nsorrel lay dead; the bolt took him square between the eyes. Jon whirled around\nfinding the \u2018master\u2019 holding a crossbow and laughing. Most galling, Longclaw\nwas sheathed at his fat waist. <i>That\u2019s\nmine!</i></p><p>\u201cMorbo, this Westerosi boy makes you look a fool on your horse! Let\u2019s\nsee what you do with him! If you live, boy, you\u2019ll make me rich!\u201d he shouted. </p><p>The Dothraki\u2014Morbo\u2014dismounted his tall dun mount, murder stamped on a\nthin face. Jon found a chunk of stone, coarse against his palm. He hefted it,\ntesting the sting in his shoulder. Morbo marched through the scrubby brush, his\nstrange half-staff, half-scythe blade twisting in whistling circles. Jon cast a\nquick glance around, finding the ground sharply slanted, jagged crumbles of\nmasonry scattered about. A poor place for a fight. The Dothraki snarled\nsomething in his own tongue, the sound harsh and guttural. <i>I have only one chance before he hacks me to bits.</i> </p><p>\u201cCome on then!\u201d Jon shouted. </p><p>With no shield, he had to be faster than the blade. Burning with\nembarrassment, Morbo would want to end the fight quick and decisive. That might\nmake him sloppy. The Dothraki led with a sharp horizontal sweep, with enough\nforce to take his head clean off. Jon ducked, intending to slam the rock into\nthe other man\u2019s ches\u2014the staff end of his blade smote Jon hard in the ear.\nHead ringing, blood in his mouth, Jon staggered back. He tripped on a rough\nstone, landing hard on his arse. Something like amusement lit Morbo\u2019s black eyes,\na thin contemptuous smile on his lips. Jon sucked blood from his split lip and\nspat it in the direction of the Dothraki\u2019s boot. Confident in victory, Morbo\nraised his blade overhead and\u2014</p><p>Jon struck. He kicked out hard, knocking Morbo to his knees. Scrambling\nfast, Jon reared back and backhanded the Dothraki with his rock. Blood flew in\na thin red arch from Morbo\u2019s mouth as he fell. In the dirt, he spat out the\nbloodied fragment of a molar. The so-called \u2018master\u2019 wheezed with laughter,\nmopping his face with a square of silk. </p><p>\u201cExcellent! You <i>are</i> a fighter.\nYou\u2019ll do well in the pits.\u201d </p><p>He clapped his hands, and half a dozen men approached from all\ndirections armed with clubs. Gods, how had he not noticed them closing in? Jon\ntook up the fallen Dothraki\u2019s staff-sword. It felt foreign in his hand, but he\nhad to try. He lunged, bringing the blade down on the smallest one. The blade\nbit deep, slicing clean through the arm. </p><p>The \u2018master\u2019 laughed as his men bled and died. <i>No, no, gods no</i>! One blow smote his shoulder. Snarling, Jon struck\nout, eviscerating the man who struck him. The sword felt keen and sharp in his\nhand. Another hail of blows fell on his back, his knee, his head. The world\nblurred, pain made him half-blind, but he was caught in a hot, red tide of desperation.\nDenial pounded along with his heartbeat. <i>No,\nno, no!</i> </p><p>The last\nthing he saw was a bloodied Morbo standing over him, looking on with something\nlike pity.</p><p>~</p><p>Daenerys\nbeckoned Drogon with a click of her tongue. The hatchling dragon perched on her\nright shoulder crept down her arm with a prickle of claws. He curled in her\npalm, his tail wrapped around her wrist. He was getting bigger and heavier with\neach passing day. Daenerys petted the frilled spikes along his neck.</p><p>\u201cAny ideas on how to sail south?\u201d she asked with an arched brow. Drogon\nflapped his wings, hissing as if to reply. Her children weren\u2019t strong enough\nto fly yet, so Daenerys tucked Drogon into his enclosure in the cool shadow\nbeneath Qarth\u2019s walls. Dust and sand lay coarse on her tongue. The air smelled\nstrange, like after a lightning strike. Magic left a faint itching prickle on\nher skin. The warlocks had paid dearly for imprisoning her. </p><p>Daenerys smoothed her hands over each of her children, their scales as\nwarm and smooth as sunwarmed river stones, reassuring herself of their solid\nwholeness. Never in all her days did she want to feel that aching emptiness\nwhen they were taken from her. Viserion preened, nestling his head into her\nhand. Rhaegal snorted, smoke curling from the slits of his nostrils.</p><p>\u201c<i>Khaleesi</i>,\u201d Rakharo said,\nswaggering up with his whip coiled over one arm.</p><p>\u201c<i>Qoy Qoyi</i>,\u201d Daenerys said,\n\u201cany word from Jorah the Andal?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Vos, khaleesi</i>,\u201d he said.\nDaenerys exhaled a breath through her nostrils. Ser Jorah had been sent to the\ncoast to secure a ship over a fortnight ago when she Xaro Xohan Daxos\u2019s\nhospitality.</p><p>\u201cWe cannot linger here much longer,\u201d she said, half to herself. Rakharo\ngrunted in reply, swinging astride his black.</p><p>\u201cI see to the herd, khaleesi!\u201d he said. A touch of his heel sent the\nblack cantering around their motley caravan. Mixed Dothraki travois housed the\npeople that remained of her khalasar after the Red Waste and Qarth\u2019s duplicity.\n</p><p>Daenerys heaved a sigh, swinging astride her silver. At least their\nfortunes had improved. True, Doreah\u2019s duplicity with their Qartheen host had\nled to the murder of Jhiqui and many others, but the richest man in Qarth had\nnot exaggerated his wealth. That, in addition to the horses and gifts pressed\nupon them by the remaining merchants\u2014eager to see the back of her and thankful\nfor her dragons ridding them of Pyatt Pree. Her Dothraki insisted on adding\nanother braid, though the victory had been Drogon\u2019s. \u00a0</p><p>When the sun climbed to its zenith and heat rose in colorless ribbons\nfrom the ground and still Ser Jorah had not returned, Daenerys gave to command\nto move out. The shadow of the warlock\u2019s tower gave her a queer feeling in her\nbelly. Piquant and bored, the three of her children cried and scratched at the\ngates of their enclosure. Having them close was as much an anchor to her as\nthem. Daenerys licked her dry lips, grateful for Drogon\u2019s weight on her right\nshoulder. Rheagal and Viserion climbed and slithered over her. </p><p>\u201c<i>Lyks</i>,\u201d she said, stilling her\nsilver\u2019s startled snort with a tug of rein. The gates of Qarth were flown open.\nPale faces and watery eyes watched from the shade of their glorious towers as\nthey rode by.</p><p>\u201cMilk Men hide like cowards,\u201d Kovarro said, hacking a glob of spit onto\nthe neatly manicured street.</p><p>\u201cWould you rather we win free by the skin of our teeth as in the House\nof the Undying, blood of my blood?\u201d Daenerys said dryly, tossing a flyaway\nstrand of hair from her face. Kovarro\u2019s thick shoulders hunched beneath his\nwarm medium brown skin.</p><p>\u201c<i>Vos, khaleesi</i>,\u201d he said,\nchastened. The youngest of her bloodriders, Kovarro was often the most eager to\ntest his mettle. Even his name was derived from the Dothraki word <i>kovarat</i> which meant \u2018to stand.\u2019 As such,\nshe could not fault him too greatly. <i>A\nman cannot deny what it is in his nature.</i> The Sand Road stretched out ahead\nof them, a bleak expanse of crushed reddish gravel. Beyond were endless crags,\nmountains of scorched red sand, stunted trees, scorpions and snakes. The air\ntasted of dust and death, even the water bled red. Was she mad to urge her\npeople to face that again? It was a testament to their faith in her that they\nrode on with scarcely a whimper of protest. \n</p><p>Daenerys\u2019 belly quavered at the baking heat of the Red Waste as Qarth\u2019s\ngates slammed closed behind them. She remembered how the heat leeched the\nstrength from her bones, the starving burning thirst that made her head ache\nand eyes burn. It had been a close thing, before Xaro Xohan Daxos took pity\nupon her. The void waited, so cool and patient.</p><p>\u201cWhich way, khaleesi?\u201d Rakharo asked. Daenerys eased back in the saddle,\nhalting the khalasar with a gesture. She drummed her fingers on the pommel of\nher saddle. The decision held their lives in the balance. Not one made lightly.\n</p><p>\u201cWe ride west.\u201d To the next city, and the next. And beyond that, Westeros\nand home. \u00a0 </p>",

I know, I know, I already have several other WIPs, but this one was fun to start! Enjoy!<br></p><p><br></p>[[MORE]]<p><br></p><p>Jon woke to pain. A pounding pain in the\nback of his head, a throb in his thigh, another in his shoulder. Along with the\npain came grief. <i>Ygritte</i>. As the Free\nFolk approached the Wall, Jon returned to the man he\u2019d always been: a man of\nthe Night\u2019s Watch and son of Eddard Stark. And Ygritte, the wildling girl who\ncajoled and teased and shoved him into loving her \u2026</p><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s a crow! He\u2019s always been a crow!\u201d \u00a0</i>Noise.\nA woman\u2019s harsh voice. Tormund\u2019s deep bellow.<i> </i></p><p><i>\u201cTake him! Kill him!\u201d</i> </p><p>The wet squelch as he\nshoved Longclaw through Orell. </p><p>Sharp eagle talons\nshredding his face. </p><p>Ygritte\u2019s eagle-sharp\nblue eyes, tears falling as she drew her bow. </p><p>The bay horse\u2019s stride\nfaltered, Jon didn\u2019t even see the blow that felled him. Then \u2026 then there\nwas nothing. Only a red-black darkness, sickening vertigo, a nauseating\nlurching.</p><p><i>\u201cWhere\u2019s the sword? It\u2019s Valyrian steel!\u201d </i>Numb fingers clenched around Longclaw. Another blow\nsmote his face. A sickening crunch and the hot trickle of blood down his mouth.\nJon\u2019s fingers loosened and the sword slipped from his grasp. He mourned the\nloss. Since he\u2019d been gifted the sword, it grew to be a part of him. <i>I\u2019m sorry, Lord Commander.</i> </p><p>Jon cracked open one eyelid. Wooden\nslats greeted him, the familiar rumble of wooden wheels on a gravel road. <i>A cart?</i> Even that proved too exhausting,\nand he slipped back into blood-warm darkness. He reached for Ghost, missing his\nquiet, unassuming company. There was the faintest white glimmer on the edges of\nhis thoughts, but too far away. So far \u2026</p><p>Rough laughter woke him.</p><p>\u201cNice of you to join\nus, your lordship!\u201d the face of a dirty man Jon didn\u2019t recognize swam before\nhis blurred vision. He blinked, confused. The man wasn\u2019t wearing a wildling\u2019s\nmotley furs, but ragged homespun. His eyelids felt so heavy \u2026 The man\nreached and stuck his finger into the arrow wound in Jon\u2019s shoulder, dirty\nfingernail biting deep. Pain was a hot, sharp jolt. Jon cried out, straining\nagainst the leather cords binding his hands and feet together. </p><p>\u201cI need you to stay\nawake now, bastard. Oh yes, those wildling scum told me all about you. The\npretty bastard with the Valyrian steel sword.\u201d The finger dug deeper, and Jon\nfelt hot blood dampen the grimy furs he wore. His flesh shrieked in pain. He\nclenched his jaw around another cry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m a man of the\nNight\u2019s Watch. If you go to Castle Black, they\u2019ll ransom me,\u201d Jon spat the\nwords around the pain. His voice was dry, reedy. The man removed his finger,\nwiping the blood on Jon\u2019s clothes. He threw his head back to laugh, a shrill,\nharsh sound, revealing several rotted teeth. The man had a pointed chin, a\nlong, pointed nose, like a rat\u2019s. Jon scowled in disgust.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d like that,\nwouldn\u2019t you? \u2018Take me to Castle Black!\u2019 he says. They\u2019ll behead me before I\ncould get a word in. No, we\u2019re headed to Eastwatch, pretty bastard.\u201d</p><p>Jon loathed\nthe cart. Its bed was padded with a thin layer of straw, which jabbed him\nthrough his ragged furs and itched horribly. The cold penetrated his very\nmarrow. Beneath the open sky, the intermittent rains and snow left him soaked\nand chilled. He hated this <i>fucking</i> cart.\nIts wheels caught every stone or pothole and his wounds complained with each\njolt. </p><p>As time passed with Jon blinking away stray flakes of snow, he sought to\nanchor himself from the monotony of travel. Under his breath, he named off the\ngreat houses of Westeros and their house words, hearing Maester Luwin\u2019s voice\nin his inner ear. He rattled off every animal he knew, every herb, every name,\nevery lineage. Jon slept and woke, ate the jerky thrown to him by the Rat, and\nslept again in unending motion and pain. When the cart did stop, he relieved\nhimself as best he could manage. He refused to simply lie in his own filth.\nEach attempt left him trembling and sweating with fatigue. By the fourth day\u2014or\nwas it the third?\u2014he could barely feed himself. \n</p><p>As the cart lurched on, Jon turned his thoughts to sigils. The image of\nthe Targaryen banner rose in his mind\u2019s eye. Black cloth, sinuous and liquid as\nink, stitched with image of a crimson dragon. Muscular, rippling, as if alive. <i>Fire and Blood</i>. Tongues of red,\nflickering at the wind\u2019s touch. The <i>fire</i>!\nHeat assaulted him, as if his marrow had been replaced with the molten blood of\nthe earth. Through cracked lips and with a leaden tongue, he said, \u201cWater. I\nneed water.\u201d The Rat ignored him. </p><p>Jon clawed at the furs, allowing the wind and snow to baptize him in\nsweet relief. He opened his mouth, catching stray flakes on his sticky tongue.\nThe pain in his shoulder and leg were like second heartbeats, louder and more\ninsistent than the one in his chest. His broken nose throbbed, the cuts on his\nface felt raw. He curled onto his side, wracked by chills. Cold. So cold. His\nteeth chattered in his skull. The furs were soaked, freezing. He wormed beneath\nthe straw like a grub trying to escape the harsh sun.</p><p>\u201cHelp me,\u201d Jon whispered. His captor, his brothers, his gods, all far\naway, deaf to him. The wind howling in his ears was his only answer. </p><p>The cart jostled hard, wooden wheels clattering on cobblestones. He\nstruggled to open his eyelids against the sharp cold night, wincing at the\nsudden writhing brilliance of torches. Harsh male voices, rough hands hauling\nhim from the cart. All of it felt far away, as if he were already a shade.</p><p>\u201cWhat a bloody mess! What am I to do with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he dead?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSeven hells, he stinks!\u201d</p><p>The hands grasping him yanked his shoulder and hot pain tore through\nhim, anchoring him to his body. Jon howled, cracked lips bleeding, his voice\nraw and aching. He screamed and fought until darkness took him.</p><p>A low, mellow\nvoice singing woke him. Where was he? Where was the Rat taking him? Could he\nloosen these bonds? The thoughts proved too heavy for him to bear, so he lost\nhimself in the hoarse undulations of the man\u2019s voice. He heard the faint chime\nof poured water. A dry, burning ache flared to life in his throat. He licked\ncracked, bloody lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jon opened his eyes. The small\ntimber room was ablaze with dazzling sunlight, stabbing his eyes. He shut them,\npierced by the clean warmth that surrounded him after so many long days of lack\nand suffering. He must have slept, for when he opened his eyes again, night had\nfallen, a fire casting leaping shadows on the rough-hewn ceiling. Dimly, he\nrealized he was clean. The furs had been replaced by a simple wool tunic, he\nwas still bound, and the pain was better. This time, Jon found strength enough\nto turn his head.</p><p>A long-robed man with a gleaming bald pate stood with his back to Jon,\nstoking the brazier.</p><p>\u201cWater,\u201d Jon croaked. The man turned and Jon narrowed his eyes. He was\ndressed in the black robes of a maester, but wore no chain. His suspicion\namused the other man, for he chuckled.</p><p>\u201cHighhanded for one in your position, aren\u2019t you? What\u2019s your name?\u201d he\nasked. His was the voice he\u2019d heard singing, as mellow as brown ale. Jon\nscowled. The false maester jiggled the water jug in front of Jon\u2019s face,\nwearing a smug grin. A bloody bully, just like Allister Thorne and Rast. </p><p>\u201cIf you want to drink, you\u2019ll have to learn to behave. Now, your name?\u201d </p><p>Jon deliberately lifted his gaze to stare at the ceiling. As he did so,\nhe glimpsed Longclaw leaning against the far wall. The craven chuckled.</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself, but defiance won\u2019t do you any favors when Vogaro lo\nMorrgys arrives.\u201d His sour bulk leaned over Jon, inspecting his nose and the\nwounds to his face. Jon flinched, testing the slack on the bonds. The cords had\nbeen traded for leather cuffs around wrist and ankle tethered by coarse rope to\nthe plank bench he laid on. Thick belts strapped him down across waist and\nchest. Jon swallowed, his burning throat already regretting his petty defiance.\nAt least he could breathe through his nose without pain.</p><p>\u201cThe cuts will scar, but your nose should heal nicely.\u201d </p><p>The man peeled aside the tunic. Jon clenched his jaw hard. How long\nwould he have to endure this man pawing at him? The puncture of Ygritte\u2019s arrow\nwas only two neat stitches, as was the wound to his thigh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen worse. You\u2019re healing nicely.\u201d The false maester\u2019s fingers\ntrailed along Jon\u2019s thigh, making his skin crawl. His hands curled into\nwhite-knuckled fists. At least the Rat had only been negligent.</p><p>\u201cWhen will this man arrive?\u201d Jon asked. </p><p>\u201cDawn. Can\u2019t be caught by patrolling crows, hmm?\u201d the man said, flicking\nthe hem of the tunic back down. Some of the tension bled from Jon, his mind\nwhirring. </p><p>Eastwatch, on the Narrow Sea. Easy enough for a ship to sail north from\nthe Free Cities. There was no reason for his captors to tend him unless \u2026\nhe shuddered at the thought. <i>Unless they\nwished to </i>sell<i> him</i>. How was it so\neasy? Being the son of a great house, a man of the Night\u2019s Watch, born\nfree\u2014though a bastard\u2014it meant nothing if men like these still existed in the\nworld. </p><p>This Morrgys would wish to inspect him, surely, maybe see if he could\nfight. They would loosen the bonds then. It was his only chance to escape. Jon\ngrasped onto the thought with both hands, mooring his hopes to it. The\nalternative didn\u2019t bear thinking of. Mercifully, the false maester left the\nroom, locking the room with a crank of an iron key. In his solitude, Jon\npondered his options. Longclaw may as well be on the other side of the world\nfor all the help it offered at the moment. </p><p>Jon flexed his right arm, straining against the cuff. It held, obstinate.\n<i>A week in a bloody cart did me no favors</i>.\nJon tested the bonds at his feet. No luck. Then the left arm \u2026 at his third\ndetermined pull, the bond gave just an inch. There was a faint jingle of iron.\nThe cuffs were tied to rings on the plank. Jon sank back, panting. Just that\nmeager effort exhausted him. A glance at the window found it still deep dark,\nlikely the hour of the wolf. He had time enough to try. He had to. He had only\none chance.</p><p>\u201cWake up, pretty bastard! I\u2019ve got a present for you,\u201d the Rat\u2019s whining\nvoice woke him from a thin slumber. Jon\u2019s eyelids snapped open as the key\nturned in the lock. The soft grey of dawn filtered through the window shutters.\n<i>One chance</i>. He lay still as the Rat\nand the false maester filed in the room, followed by a squat man with\namber-brown skin, a great fist of a nose and a cloud of red-black hair. His\nwealth was evident in the silver embroidery of his leathers, the jeweled rings\non each of his fat fingers. The Rat gave a shrill laugh.</p><p>\u201cLook what I have for you, Good Master. A young, pretty crow!\u201d The\n\u2018Master\u2019 scowled down his nose at the Rat, dark eyes scrutinizing. Jon met his\ngaze unflinchingly, he was a free man to the bone, to the marrow. <i>Blood of the North. Blood of the Kings of\nWinter. Now come closer. Closer, now.</i></p><p>\u201cCrow? What is this word?\u201d The words emerged garbled, as if he had\nmarbles in his mouth. He gestured with a whip whose handle gleamed in the\nbrazier\u2019s light, the figure of a grotesque woman with a bat\u2019s wings and\nscorpion\u2019s tail.</p><p>\u201cThat is the name some northmen give members of the Night\u2019s Watch, who\nguard the Wall, Good Master,\u201d the false maester said, with an obsequious little\nbow. <i>Worm</i>.</p><p>\u201cI see. You did not lie, he is pretty. Good enough for the pleasure\nhouses of Lys or Yunkai if trained. But you say he\u2019s a fighter?\u201d Jon\u2019s guts\nfroze. Horrors compounded and multiplied. <i>Pleasure\nhouses?</i></p><p>\u201cYes. The wildlings sold him to us after he killed some of their number.\nAnd he has this,\u201d the Rat said, picking up Longclaw. The master shrank back\nfrom the blade with a hiss.</p><p>\u201cValyrian steel,\u201d The Master spat the words like curses, though his\ntrembling hands closed over the sheath.</p><p>\u201cUnparalleled in its sharpness and durability,\u201d he said, touching the\nsteel with a wondering finger. That fat finger touched the white wolf pommel. \u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Zokla timpa</i>,\u201d he said,\nsheathing Longclaw with a sharp snap. He reached into his coat and dropped\nthree heavy pouches on the table. </p><p>\u201cFor the sword.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the crow?\u201d the Rat asked. The Master glanced at Jon and tossed\nanother pouch on the table. </p><p>\u201cBring him down. I\u2019ll see how he does against my Dothraki. If he loses,\nI can still sell him in Lys, if he wins, he might have potential,\u201d he said,\nleaving the room without another word. </p><p>Jon took a deep breath. The master had taken his weapon, but he was\nconfident he could overpower the other two men if he caught them surprise. </p><p>\u201cToday\u2019s your lucky day, crow!\u201d the Rat said, unbuckling one foot. The\nfalse maester slid the tongues of the belts across his torso free.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be sad to see you go. We had so little time together,\u201d he said,\nleering. Jon waited, summoning every bit of his patience. He only had one\nchance. He couldn\u2019t lunge too early \u2026 The Rat freed his other foot. The\nfalse maester bent to untie his left hand and\u2014Jon surged upright, kicking the\nRat hard in the belly. Before the maester had time to cry out, Jon slammed the\nback of his fist into the man\u2019s face. Jon felt a crunch, and the man fell\ninsensate. Jon untied his right hand as the Rat gasped for air, wheezing for\nhelp.</p><p>\u201cI guess it is my lucky day,\u201d Jon said, darting behind the Rat and\nlooping his arm around his head. He <i>squeezed</i>.\nThe Rat clawed and thrashed beneath him, but as skinny as he was, the blows\nwere ineffectual. Face set in a rictus of effort, Jon squeezed his head until the\nRat lay inert. Then the room echoed with only his own harsh breathing. </p><p>He waited, straining to hear the thump of coming footsteps. None. Good.\nJon snatched the water jug and gulped thirstily. The cold water was sweet\nrelief to his parched throat. He drained it and another jug. Barefoot and\nunarmed, a quick glance at the two men brought up no options. The Rat was too\nsmall and skinny, and the false maester wore sandals. Neither man wore so much\nas an eating knife. <i>Seven hells. </i></p><p>Jon slipped from the room. They were in one of the Watch\u2019s abandoned\noutbuildings, he could tell by the neat builder\u2019s stonework and the air of\nneglect. Not Eastwatch per se, that was one of the castles still patrolled by\nthe Watch, but nearby. All he needed was a horse, then he could ride hell for\nleather north. They were still his sworn brothers, after all. </p><p>Jon crept soft-footed down the hall, tucking close into a lintel at the\nfaint clatter of footsteps. He didn\u2019t have long until either the Rat came to or\nthe slaver\u2019s guards came sniffing about. Measuring his breathing, Jon waited.\nNervous energy sang through his muscles, the stone floor dusty and achingly\ncold beneath his bare feet. The footsteps came no closer, faintly he heard the\nrasp of a foreign language through a nearby shutter. Jon exhaled his breath.\nNot much time now. </p><p>He followed the hall, ran into a dead-end, turned back, took another\nturn, and then another. Another hallway led him to a stairway, curved out of\nsight. He wasted precious moments deliberating. If he barreled down the stair,\nhe could catch whoever might be below by surprise \u2026 or raise the alarm in\nthe process. <i>Might as well chance it,\nthey\u2019re going to find those men any moment</i>. Jon padded down the stairs, two\nat a time. He sniffed through his battered nose. Was that \u2026 ? The room,\nperhaps once a receiving hall, stood converted to a stable. The humble scent of\nhay and horse manure made tears prick his eyes. Thanking the gods for at last a\nstroke of luck, Jon found a shaggy sorrel, tugging hay from a net. Thin and\nrangy, the sorrel looked fast, energetic. </p><p>\u201cCome on now. Let\u2019s go for a ride, yeah?\u201d he whispered, freeing the slip\nknot with a stealthy tug. The horse followed without demur, allowing Jon to\nswing astride. No time to rummage for tack, the halter would have to do for a\nbridle. Jon clicked his tongue, wrapping his legs snug against the horse\u2019s warm\nsides. Jon ducked beneath the rooftree just as a great shout sounded behind\nhim: \u201cThe crow\u2019s escaped! Find him!\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Jon kicked the sorrel\u2019s ribs, laying the halter lead against his neck to\nslew him left. Outside there was a sparse courtyard, once there had been a wall\nencircling the sad ruin of a tower, but now there was only a crumble of mortar.\nA glance cut behind him found a scrum of movement, a hail of cursing. </p><p>A garble of harsh words sounded much closer. From the tail of his eye,\nJon glimpsed a galloping warrior through a screen of his flying hair. <i>Dothraki</i>. With a shrill, undulating\nyell, the Dothraki urged his mount close, his black, curved blade cruel in the\nearly light. On instinct, Jon slid down the side of his mount, clinging with\nall the strength in his legs as the blade parted the air. The blow swung wide\nand the sorrel cantered through a patch of prickling weeds as Jon righted\nhimself.</p><p>A faint\ntwang. </p><p>With a squeal, the sorrel crumpled beneath him. Jon landed hard, white\nbursting behind his eyes. A hard blow on his shoulder and side, then tumbling\nend over end until he landed on his back. Air wheezed from his lungs. Gasping\nfor breath, Jon rolled to his hands and knees, staggering to his feet. The\nsorrel lay dead; the bolt took him square between the eyes. Jon whirled around\nfinding the \u2018master\u2019 holding a crossbow and laughing. Most galling, Longclaw\nwas sheathed at his fat waist. <i>That\u2019s\nmine!</i></p><p>\u201cMorbo, this Westerosi boy makes you look a fool on your horse! Let\u2019s\nsee what you do with him! If you live, boy, you\u2019ll make me rich!\u201d he shouted. </p><p>The Dothraki\u2014Morbo\u2014dismounted his tall dun mount, murder stamped on a\nthin face. Jon found a chunk of stone, coarse against his palm. He hefted it,\ntesting the sting in his shoulder. Morbo marched through the scrubby brush, his\nstrange half-staff, half-scythe blade twisting in whistling circles. Jon cast a\nquick glance around, finding the ground sharply slanted, jagged crumbles of\nmasonry scattered about. A poor place for a fight. The Dothraki snarled\nsomething in his own tongue, the sound harsh and guttural. <i>I have only one chance before he hacks me to bits.</i> </p><p>\u201cCome on then!\u201d Jon shouted. </p><p>With no shield, he had to be faster than the blade. Burning with\nembarrassment, Morbo would want to end the fight quick and decisive. That might\nmake him sloppy. The Dothraki led with a sharp horizontal sweep, with enough\nforce to take his head clean off. Jon ducked, intending to slam the rock into\nthe other man\u2019s ches\u2014the staff end of his blade smote Jon hard in the ear.\nHead ringing, blood in his mouth, Jon staggered back. He tripped on a rough\nstone, landing hard on his arse. Something like amusement lit Morbo\u2019s black eyes,\na thin contemptuous smile on his lips. Jon sucked blood from his split lip and\nspat it in the direction of the Dothraki\u2019s boot. Confident in victory, Morbo\nraised his blade overhead and\u2014</p><p>Jon struck. He kicked out hard, knocking Morbo to his knees. Scrambling\nfast, Jon reared back and backhanded the Dothraki with his rock. Blood flew in\na thin red arch from Morbo\u2019s mouth as he fell. In the dirt, he spat out the\nbloodied fragment of a molar. The so-called \u2018master\u2019 wheezed with laughter,\nmopping his face with a square of silk. </p><p>\u201cExcellent! You <i>are</i> a fighter.\nYou\u2019ll do well in the pits.\u201d </p><p>He clapped his hands, and half a dozen men approached from all\ndirections armed with clubs. Gods, how had he not noticed them closing in? Jon\ntook up the fallen Dothraki\u2019s staff-sword. It felt foreign in his hand, but he\nhad to try. He lunged, bringing the blade down on the smallest one. The blade\nbit deep, slicing clean through the arm. </p><p>The \u2018master\u2019 laughed as his men bled and died. <i>No, no, gods no</i>! One blow smote his shoulder. Snarling, Jon struck\nout, eviscerating the man who struck him. The sword felt keen and sharp in his\nhand. Another hail of blows fell on his back, his knee, his head. The world\nblurred, pain made him half-blind, but he was caught in a hot, red tide of desperation.\nDenial pounded along with his heartbeat. <i>No,\nno, no!</i> </p><p>The last\nthing he saw was a bloodied Morbo standing over him, looking on with something\nlike pity.</p><p>~</p><p>Daenerys\nbeckoned Drogon with a click of her tongue. The hatchling dragon perched on her\nright shoulder crept down her arm with a prickle of claws. He curled in her\npalm, his tail wrapped around her wrist. He was getting bigger and heavier with\neach passing day. Daenerys petted the frilled spikes along his neck.</p><p>\u201cAny ideas on how to sail south?\u201d she asked with an arched brow. Drogon\nflapped his wings, hissing as if to reply. Her children weren\u2019t strong enough\nto fly yet, so Daenerys tucked Drogon into his enclosure in the cool shadow\nbeneath Qarth\u2019s walls. Dust and sand lay coarse on her tongue. The air smelled\nstrange, like after a lightning strike. Magic left a faint itching prickle on\nher skin. The warlocks had paid dearly for imprisoning her. </p><p>Daenerys smoothed her hands over each of her children, their scales as\nwarm and smooth as sunwarmed river stones, reassuring herself of their solid\nwholeness. Never in all her days did she want to feel that aching emptiness\nwhen they were taken from her. Viserion preened, nestling his head into her\nhand. Rhaegal snorted, smoke curling from the slits of his nostrils.</p><p>\u201c<i>Khaleesi</i>,\u201d Rakharo said,\nswaggering up with his whip coiled over one arm.</p><p>\u201c<i>Qoy Qoyi</i>,\u201d Daenerys said,\n\u201cany word from Jorah the Andal?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Vos, khaleesi</i>,\u201d he said.\nDaenerys exhaled a breath through her nostrils. Ser Jorah had been sent to the\ncoast to secure a ship over a fortnight ago when she Xaro Xohan Daxos\u2019s\nhospitality.</p><p>\u201cWe cannot linger here much longer,\u201d she said, half to herself. Rakharo\ngrunted in reply, swinging astride his black.</p><p>\u201cI see to the herd, khaleesi!\u201d he said. A touch of his heel sent the\nblack cantering around their motley caravan. Mixed Dothraki travois housed the\npeople that remained of her khalasar after the Red Waste and Qarth\u2019s duplicity.\n</p><p>Daenerys heaved a sigh, swinging astride her silver. At least their\nfortunes had improved. True, Doreah\u2019s duplicity with their Qartheen host had\nled to the murder of Jhiqui and many others, but the richest man in Qarth had\nnot exaggerated his wealth. That, in addition to the horses and gifts pressed\nupon them by the remaining merchants\u2014eager to see the back of her and thankful\nfor her dragons ridding them of Pyatt Pree. Her Dothraki insisted on adding\nanother braid, though the victory had been Drogon\u2019s. \u00a0</p><p>When the sun climbed to its zenith and heat rose in colorless ribbons\nfrom the ground and still Ser Jorah had not returned, Daenerys gave to command\nto move out. The shadow of the warlock\u2019s tower gave her a queer feeling in her\nbelly. Piquant and bored, the three of her children cried and scratched at the\ngates of their enclosure.

                "content": "<p>Another WIP!&nbsp;As he tries to return to the Night&rsquo;s Watch, Jon is taken and sold to slavers. A fighter sent to fight to the death in a pit worse than the seven hells. Meanwhile, Daenerys is recovering from betrayal in Qarth and planning her next move toward the home she longs for.</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6dVcVsFUNiVjAKX8wqv8_Q\">@waking-dreams-of-harmony</a> prompted me forever ago with a similar prompt. I know, I know, I already have several other WIPs, but this one was fun to start! Enjoy!<br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Jon woke to pain. A pounding pain in the\nback of his head, a throb in his thigh, another in his shoulder. Along with the\npain came grief. <i>Ygritte</i>. As the Free\nFolk approached the Wall, Jon returned to the man he&rsquo;d always been: a man of\nthe Night&rsquo;s Watch and son of Eddard Stark. And Ygritte, the wildling girl who\ncajoled and teased and shoved him into loving her &hellip;</p><p><i>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a crow! He&rsquo;s always been a crow!&rdquo; &nbsp;</i>Noise.\nA woman&rsquo;s harsh voice. Tormund&rsquo;s deep bellow.<i> </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Take him! Kill him!&rdquo;</i> </p><p>The wet squelch as he\nshoved Longclaw through Orell. </p><p>Sharp eagle talons\nshredding his face. </p><p>Ygritte&rsquo;s eagle-sharp\nblue eyes, tears falling as she drew her bow. </p><p>The bay horse&rsquo;s stride\nfaltered, Jon didn&rsquo;t even see the blow that felled him. Then &hellip; then there\nwas nothing. Only a red-black darkness, sickening vertigo, a nauseating\nlurching.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the sword? It&rsquo;s Valyrian steel!&rdquo; </i>Numb fingers clenched around Longclaw. Another blow\nsmote his face. A sickening crunch and the hot trickle of blood down his mouth.\nJon&rsquo;s fingers loosened and the sword slipped from his grasp. He mourned the\nloss. Since he&rsquo;d been gifted the sword, it grew to be a part of him. <i>I&rsquo;m sorry, Lord Commander.</i> </p><p>Jon cracked open one eyelid. Wooden\nslats greeted him, the familiar rumble of wooden wheels on a gravel road. <i>A cart?</i> Even that proved too exhausting,\nand he slipped back into blood-warm darkness. He reached for Ghost, missing his\nquiet, unassuming company. There was the faintest white glimmer on the edges of\nhis thoughts, but too far away. So far &hellip;</p><p>Rough laughter woke him.</p><p>&ldquo;Nice of you to join\nus, your lordship!&rdquo; the face of a dirty man Jon didn&rsquo;t recognize swam before\nhis blurred vision. He blinked, confused. The man wasn&rsquo;t wearing a wildling&rsquo;s\nmotley furs, but ragged homespun. His eyelids felt so heavy &hellip; The man\nreached and stuck his finger into the arrow wound in Jon&rsquo;s shoulder, dirty\nfingernail biting deep. Pain was a hot, sharp jolt. Jon cried out, straining\nagainst the leather cords binding his hands and feet together. </p><p>&ldquo;I need you to stay\nawake now, bastard. Oh yes, those wildling scum told me all about you. The\npretty bastard with the Valyrian steel sword.&rdquo; The finger dug deeper, and Jon\nfelt hot blood dampen the grimy furs he wore. His flesh shrieked in pain. He\nclenched his jaw around another cry.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m a man of the\nNight&rsquo;s Watch. If you go to Castle Black, they&rsquo;ll ransom me,&rdquo; Jon spat the\nwords around the pain. His voice was dry, reedy. The man removed his finger,\nwiping the blood on Jon&rsquo;s clothes. He threw his head back to laugh, a shrill,\nharsh sound, revealing several rotted teeth. The man had a pointed chin, a\nlong, pointed nose, like a rat&rsquo;s. Jon scowled in disgust.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d like that,\nwouldn&rsquo;t you? &lsquo;Take me to Castle Black!&rsquo; he says. They&rsquo;ll behead me before I\ncould get a word in. No, we&rsquo;re headed to Eastwatch, pretty bastard.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon loathed\nthe cart. Its bed was padded with a thin layer of straw, which jabbed him\nthrough his ragged furs and itched horribly. The cold penetrated his very\nmarrow. Beneath the open sky, the intermittent rains and snow left him soaked\nand chilled. He hated this <i>fucking</i> cart.\nIts wheels caught every stone or pothole and his wounds complained with each\njolt. </p><p>As time passed with Jon blinking away stray flakes of snow, he sought to\nanchor himself from the monotony of travel. Under his breath, he named off the\ngreat houses of Westeros and their house words, hearing Maester Luwin&rsquo;s voice\nin his inner ear. He rattled off every animal he knew, every herb, every name,\nevery lineage. Jon slept and woke, ate the jerky thrown to him by the Rat, and\nslept again in unending motion and pain. When the cart did stop, he relieved\nhimself as best he could manage. He refused to simply lie in his own filth.\nEach attempt left him trembling and sweating with fatigue. By the fourth day&mdash;or\nwas it the third?&mdash;he could barely feed himself. \n</p><p>As the cart lurched on, Jon turned his thoughts to sigils. The image of\nthe Targaryen banner rose in his mind&rsquo;s eye. Black cloth, sinuous and liquid as\nink, stitched with image of a crimson dragon. Muscular, rippling, as if alive. <i>Fire and Blood</i>. Tongues of red,\nflickering at the wind&rsquo;s touch. The <i>fire</i>!\nHeat assaulted him, as if his marrow had been replaced with the molten blood of\nthe earth. Through cracked lips and with a leaden tongue, he said, &ldquo;Water. I\nneed water.&rdquo; The Rat ignored him. </p><p>Jon clawed at the furs, allowing the wind and snow to baptize him in\nsweet relief. He opened his mouth, catching stray flakes on his sticky tongue.\nThe pain in his shoulder and leg were like second heartbeats, louder and more\ninsistent than the one in his chest. His broken nose throbbed, the cuts on his\nface felt raw. He curled onto his side, wracked by chills. Cold. So cold. His\nteeth chattered in his skull. The furs were soaked, freezing. He wormed beneath\nthe straw like a grub trying to escape the harsh sun.</p><p>&ldquo;Help me,&rdquo; Jon whispered. His captor, his brothers, his gods, all far\naway, deaf to him. The wind howling in his ears was his only answer. </p><p>The cart jostled hard, wooden wheels clattering on cobblestones. He\nstruggled to open his eyelids against the sharp cold night, wincing at the\nsudden writhing brilliance of torches. Harsh male voices, rough hands hauling\nhim from the cart. All of it felt far away, as if he were already a shade.</p><p>&ldquo;What a bloody mess! What am I to do with this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is he dead?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Seven hells, he stinks!&rdquo;</p><p>The hands grasping him yanked his shoulder and hot pain tore through\nhim, anchoring him to his body. Jon howled, cracked lips bleeding, his voice\nraw and aching. He screamed and fought until darkness took him.</p><p>A low, mellow\nvoice singing woke him. Where was he? Where was the Rat taking him? Could he\nloosen these bonds? The thoughts proved too heavy for him to bear, so he lost\nhimself in the hoarse undulations of the man&rsquo;s voice. He heard the faint chime\nof poured water. A dry, burning ache flared to life in his throat. He licked\ncracked, bloody lips. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jon opened his eyes. The small\ntimber room was ablaze with dazzling sunlight, stabbing his eyes. He shut them,\npierced by the clean warmth that surrounded him after so many long days of lack\nand suffering. He must have slept, for when he opened his eyes again, night had\nfallen, a fire casting leaping shadows on the rough-hewn ceiling. Dimly, he\nrealized he was clean. The furs had been replaced by a simple wool tunic, he\nwas still bound, and the pain was better. This time, Jon found strength enough\nto turn his head.</p><p>A long-robed man with a gleaming bald pate stood with his back to Jon,\nstoking the brazier.</p><p>&ldquo;Water,&rdquo; Jon croaked. The man turned and Jon narrowed his eyes. He was\ndressed in the black robes of a maester, but wore no chain. His suspicion\namused the other man, for he chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;Highhanded for one in your position, aren&rsquo;t you? What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; he\nasked. His was the voice he&rsquo;d heard singing, as mellow as brown ale. Jon\nscowled. The false maester jiggled the water jug in front of Jon&rsquo;s face,\nwearing a smug grin. A bloody bully, just like Allister Thorne and Rast. </p><p>&ldquo;If you want to drink, you&rsquo;ll have to learn to behave. Now, your name?&rdquo; </p><p>Jon deliberately lifted his gaze to stare at the ceiling. As he did so,\nhe glimpsed Longclaw leaning against the far wall. The craven chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;Suit yourself, but defiance won&rsquo;t do you any favors when Vogaro lo\nMorrgys arrives.&rdquo; His sour bulk leaned over Jon, inspecting his nose and the\nwounds to his face. Jon flinched, testing the slack on the bonds. The cords had\nbeen traded for leather cuffs around wrist and ankle tethered by coarse rope to\nthe plank bench he laid on. Thick belts strapped him down across waist and\nchest. Jon swallowed, his burning throat already regretting his petty defiance.\nAt least he could breathe through his nose without pain.</p><p>&ldquo;The cuts will scar, but your nose should heal nicely.&rdquo; </p><p>The man peeled aside the tunic. Jon clenched his jaw hard. How long\nwould he have to endure this man pawing at him? The puncture of Ygritte&rsquo;s arrow\nwas only two neat stitches, as was the wound to his thigh.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen worse. You&rsquo;re healing nicely.&rdquo; The false maester&rsquo;s fingers\ntrailed along Jon&rsquo;s thigh, making his skin crawl. His hands curled into\nwhite-knuckled fists. At least the Rat had only been negligent.</p><p>&ldquo;When will this man arrive?&rdquo; Jon asked. </p><p>&ldquo;Dawn. Can&rsquo;t be caught by patrolling crows, hmm?&rdquo; the man said, flicking\nthe hem of the tunic back down. Some of the tension bled from Jon, his mind\nwhirring. </p><p>Eastwatch, on the Narrow Sea. Easy enough for a ship to sail north from\nthe Free Cities. There was no reason for his captors to tend him unless &hellip;\nhe shuddered at the thought. <i>Unless they\nwished to </i>sell<i> him</i>. How was it so\neasy? Being the son of a great house, a man of the Night&rsquo;s Watch, born\nfree&mdash;though a bastard&mdash;it meant nothing if men like these still existed in the\nworld. </p><p>This Morrgys would wish to inspect him, surely, maybe see if he could\nfight. They would loosen the bonds then. It was his only chance to escape. Jon\ngrasped onto the thought with both hands, mooring his hopes to it. The\nalternative didn&rsquo;t bear thinking of. Mercifully, the false maester left the\nroom, locking the room with a crank of an iron key. In his solitude, Jon\npondered his options. Longclaw may as well be on the other side of the world\nfor all the help it offered at the moment. </p><p>Jon flexed his right arm, straining against the cuff. It held, obstinate.\n<i>A week in a bloody cart did me no favors</i>.\nJon tested the bonds at his feet. No luck. Then the left arm &hellip; at his third\ndetermined pull, the bond gave just an inch. There was a faint jingle of iron.\nThe cuffs were tied to rings on the plank. Jon sank back, panting. Just that\nmeager effort exhausted him. A glance at the window found it still deep dark,\nlikely the hour of the wolf. He had time enough to try. He had to. He had only\none chance.</p><p>&ldquo;Wake up, pretty bastard! I&rsquo;ve got a present for you,&rdquo; the Rat&rsquo;s whining\nvoice woke him from a thin slumber. Jon&rsquo;s eyelids snapped open as the key\nturned in the lock. The soft grey of dawn filtered through the window shutters.\n<i>One chance</i>. He lay still as the Rat\nand the false maester filed in the room, followed by a squat man with\namber-brown skin, a great fist of a nose and a cloud of red-black hair. His\nwealth was evident in the silver embroidery of his leathers, the jeweled rings\non each of his fat fingers. The Rat gave a shrill laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Look what I have for you, Good Master. A young, pretty crow!&rdquo; The\n&lsquo;Master&rsquo; scowled down his nose at the Rat, dark eyes scrutinizing. Jon met his\ngaze unflinchingly, he was a free man to the bone, to the marrow. <i>Blood of the North. Blood of the Kings of\nWinter. Now come closer. Closer, now.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Crow? What is this word?&rdquo; The words emerged garbled, as if he had\nmarbles in his mouth. He gestured with a whip whose handle gleamed in the\nbrazier&rsquo;s light, the figure of a grotesque woman with a bat&rsquo;s wings and\nscorpion&rsquo;s tail.</p><p>&ldquo;That is the name some northmen give members of the Night&rsquo;s Watch, who\nguard the Wall, Good Master,&rdquo; the false maester said, with an obsequious little\nbow. <i>Worm</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;I see. You did not lie, he is pretty. Good enough for the pleasure\nhouses of Lys or Yunkai if trained. But you say he&rsquo;s a fighter?&rdquo; Jon&rsquo;s guts\nfroze. Horrors compounded and multiplied. <i>Pleasure\nhouses?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Yes. The wildlings sold him to us after he killed some of their number.\nAnd he has this,&rdquo; the Rat said, picking up Longclaw. The master shrank back\nfrom the blade with a hiss.</p><p>&ldquo;Valyrian steel,&rdquo; The Master spat the words like curses, though his\ntrembling hands closed over the sheath.</p><p>&ldquo;Unparalleled in its sharpness and durability,&rdquo; he said, touching the\nsteel with a wondering finger. That fat finger touched the white wolf pommel. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Zokla timpa</i>,&rdquo; he said,\nsheathing Longclaw with a sharp snap. He reached into his coat and dropped\nthree heavy pouches on the table. </p><p>&ldquo;For the sword.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And the crow?&rdquo; the Rat asked. The Master glanced at Jon and tossed\nanother pouch on the table. </p><p>&ldquo;Bring him down. I&rsquo;ll see how he does against my Dothraki. If he loses,\nI can still sell him in Lys, if he wins, he might have potential,&rdquo; he said,\nleaving the room without another word. </p><p>Jon took a deep breath. The master had taken his weapon, but he was\nconfident he could overpower the other two men if he caught them surprise. </p><p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s your lucky day, crow!&rdquo; the Rat said, unbuckling one foot. The\nfalse maester slid the tongues of the belts across his torso free.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be sad to see you go. We had so little time together,&rdquo; he said,\nleering. Jon waited, summoning every bit of his patience. He only had one\nchance. He couldn&rsquo;t lunge too early &hellip; The Rat freed his other foot. The\nfalse maester bent to untie his left hand and&mdash;Jon surged upright, kicking the\nRat hard in the belly. Before the maester had time to cry out, Jon slammed the\nback of his fist into the man&rsquo;s face. Jon felt a crunch, and the man fell\ninsensate. Jon untied his right hand as the Rat gasped for air, wheezing for\nhelp.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess it is my lucky day,&rdquo; Jon said, darting behind the Rat and\nlooping his arm around his head. He <i>squeezed</i>.\nThe Rat clawed and thrashed beneath him, but as skinny as he was, the blows\nwere ineffectual. Face set in a rictus of effort, Jon squeezed his head until the\nRat lay inert. Then the room echoed with only his own harsh breathing. </p><p>He waited, straining to hear the thump of coming footsteps. None. Good.\nJon snatched the water jug and gulped thirstily. The cold water was sweet\nrelief to his parched throat. He drained it and another jug. Barefoot and\nunarmed, a quick glance at the two men brought up no options. The Rat was too\nsmall and skinny, and the false maester wore sandals. Neither man wore so much\nas an eating knife. <i>Seven hells. </i></p><p>Jon slipped from the room. They were in one of the Watch&rsquo;s abandoned\noutbuildings, he could tell by the neat builder&rsquo;s stonework and the air of\nneglect. Not Eastwatch per se, that was one of the castles still patrolled by\nthe Watch, but nearby. All he needed was a horse, then he could ride hell for\nleather north. They were still his sworn brothers, after all. </p><p>Jon crept soft-footed down the hall, tucking close into a lintel at the\nfaint clatter of footsteps. He didn&rsquo;t have long until either the Rat came to or\nthe slaver&rsquo;s guards came sniffing about. Measuring his breathing, Jon waited.\nNervous energy sang through his muscles, the stone floor dusty and achingly\ncold beneath his bare feet. The footsteps came no closer, faintly he heard the\nrasp of a foreign language through a nearby shutter. Jon exhaled his breath.\nNot much time now. </p><p>He followed the hall, ran into a dead-end, turned back, took another\nturn, and then another. Another hallway led him to a stairway, curved out of\nsight. He wasted precious moments deliberating. If he barreled down the stair,\nhe could catch whoever might be below by surprise &hellip; or raise the alarm in\nthe process. <i>Might as well chance it,\nthey&rsquo;re going to find those men any moment</i>. Jon padded down the stairs, two\nat a time. He sniffed through his battered nose. Was that &hellip; ? The room,\nperhaps once a receiving hall, stood converted to a stable. The humble scent of\nhay and horse manure made tears prick his eyes. Thanking the gods for at last a\nstroke of luck, Jon found a shaggy sorrel, tugging hay from a net. Thin and\nrangy, the sorrel looked fast, energetic. </p><p>&ldquo;Come on now. Let&rsquo;s go for a ride, yeah?&rdquo; he whispered, freeing the slip\nknot with a stealthy tug. The horse followed without demur, allowing Jon to\nswing astride. No time to rummage for tack, the halter would have to do for a\nbridle. Jon clicked his tongue, wrapping his legs snug against the horse&rsquo;s warm\nsides. Jon ducked beneath the rooftree just as a great shout sounded behind\nhim: &ldquo;The crow&rsquo;s escaped! Find him!&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>Jon kicked the sorrel&rsquo;s ribs, laying the halter lead against his neck to\nslew him left. Outside there was a sparse courtyard, once there had been a wall\nencircling the sad ruin of a tower, but now there was only a crumble of mortar.\nA glance cut behind him found a scrum of movement, a hail of cursing. </p><p>A garble of harsh words sounded much closer. From the tail of his eye,\nJon glimpsed a galloping warrior through a screen of his flying hair. <i>Dothraki</i>. With a shrill, undulating\nyell, the Dothraki urged his mount close, his black, curved blade cruel in the\nearly light. On instinct, Jon slid down the side of his mount, clinging with\nall the strength in his legs as the blade parted the air. The blow swung wide\nand the sorrel cantered through a patch of prickling weeds as Jon righted\nhimself.</p><p>A faint\ntwang. </p><p>With a squeal, the sorrel crumpled beneath him. Jon landed hard, white\nbursting behind his eyes. A hard blow on his shoulder and side, then tumbling\nend over end until he landed on his back. Air wheezed from his lungs. Gasping\nfor breath, Jon rolled to his hands and knees, staggering to his feet. The\nsorrel lay dead; the bolt took him square between the eyes. Jon whirled around\nfinding the &lsquo;master&rsquo; holding a crossbow and laughing. Most galling, Longclaw\nwas sheathed at his fat waist. <i>That&rsquo;s\nmine!</i></p><p>&ldquo;Morbo, this Westerosi boy makes you look a fool on your horse! Let&rsquo;s\nsee what you do with him! If you live, boy, you&rsquo;ll make me rich!&rdquo; he shouted. </p><p>The Dothraki&mdash;Morbo&mdash;dismounted his tall dun mount, murder stamped on a\nthin face. Jon found a chunk of stone, coarse against his palm. He hefted it,\ntesting the sting in his shoulder. Morbo marched through the scrubby brush, his\nstrange half-staff, half-scythe blade twisting in whistling circles. Jon cast a\nquick glance around, finding the ground sharply slanted, jagged crumbles of\nmasonry scattered about. A poor place for a fight. The Dothraki snarled\nsomething in his own tongue, the sound harsh and guttural. <i>I have only one chance before he hacks me to bits.</i> </p><p>&ldquo;Come on then!&rdquo; Jon shouted. </p><p>With no shield, he had to be faster than the blade. Burning with\nembarrassment, Morbo would want to end the fight quick and decisive. That might\nmake him sloppy. The Dothraki led with a sharp horizontal sweep, with enough\nforce to take his head clean off. Jon ducked, intending to slam the rock into\nthe other man&rsquo;s ches&mdash;the staff end of his blade smote Jon hard in the ear.\nHead ringing, blood in his mouth, Jon staggered back. He tripped on a rough\nstone, landing hard on his arse. Something like amusement lit Morbo&rsquo;s black eyes,\na thin contemptuous smile on his lips. Jon sucked blood from his split lip and\nspat it in the direction of the Dothraki&rsquo;s boot. Confident in victory, Morbo\nraised his blade overhead and&mdash;</p><p>Jon struck. He kicked out hard, knocking Morbo to his knees. Scrambling\nfast, Jon reared back and backhanded the Dothraki with his rock. Blood flew in\na thin red arch from Morbo&rsquo;s mouth as he fell. In the dirt, he spat out the\nbloodied fragment of a molar. The so-called &lsquo;master&rsquo; wheezed with laughter,\nmopping his face with a square of silk. </p><p>&ldquo;Excellent! You <i>are</i> a fighter.\nYou&rsquo;ll do well in the pits.&rdquo; </p><p>He clapped his hands, and half a dozen men approached from all\ndirections armed with clubs. Gods, how had he not noticed them closing in? Jon\ntook up the fallen Dothraki&rsquo;s staff-sword. It felt foreign in his hand, but he\nhad to try. He lunged, bringing the blade down on the smallest one. The blade\nbit deep, slicing clean through the arm. </p><p>The &lsquo;master&rsquo; laughed as his men bled and died. <i>No, no, gods no</i>! One blow smote his shoulder. Snarling, Jon struck\nout, eviscerating the man who struck him. The sword felt keen and sharp in his\nhand. Another hail of blows fell on his back, his knee, his head. The world\nblurred, pain made him half-blind, but he was caught in a hot, red tide of desperation.\nDenial pounded along with his heartbeat. <i>No,\nno, no!</i> </p><p>The last\nthing he saw was a bloodied Morbo standing over him, looking on with something\nlike pity.</p><p>~</p><p>Daenerys\nbeckoned Drogon with a click of her tongue. The hatchling dragon perched on her\nright shoulder crept down her arm with a prickle of claws. He curled in her\npalm, his tail wrapped around her wrist. He was getting bigger and heavier with\neach passing day. Daenerys petted the frilled spikes along his neck.</p><p>&ldquo;Any ideas on how to sail south?&rdquo; she asked with an arched brow. Drogon\nflapped his wings, hissing as if to reply. Her children weren&rsquo;t strong enough\nto fly yet, so Daenerys tucked Drogon into his enclosure in the cool shadow\nbeneath Qarth&rsquo;s walls. Dust and sand lay coarse on her tongue. The air smelled\nstrange, like after a lightning strike. Magic left a faint itching prickle on\nher skin. The warlocks had paid dearly for imprisoning her. </p><p>Daenerys smoothed her hands over each of her children, their scales as\nwarm and smooth as sunwarmed river stones, reassuring herself of their solid\nwholeness. Never in all her days did she want to feel that aching emptiness\nwhen they were taken from her. Viserion preened, nestling his head into her\nhand. Rhaegal snorted, smoke curling from the slits of his nostrils.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Khaleesi</i>,&rdquo; Rakharo said,\nswaggering up with his whip coiled over one arm.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Qoy Qoyi</i>,&rdquo; Daenerys said,\n&ldquo;any word from Jorah the Andal?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Vos, khaleesi</i>,&rdquo; he said.\nDaenerys exhaled a breath through her nostrils. Ser Jorah had been sent to the\ncoast to secure a ship over a fortnight ago when she Xaro Xohan Daxos&rsquo;s\nhospitality.</p><p>&ldquo;We cannot linger here much longer,&rdquo; she said, half to herself. Rakharo\ngrunted in reply, swinging astride his black.</p><p>&ldquo;I see to the herd, khaleesi!&rdquo; he said. A touch of his heel sent the\nblack cantering around their motley caravan. Mixed Dothraki travois housed the\npeople that remained of her khalasar after the Red Waste and Qarth&rsquo;s duplicity.\n</p><p>Daenerys heaved a sigh, swinging astride her silver. At least their\nfortunes had improved. True, Doreah&rsquo;s duplicity with their Qartheen host had\nled to the murder of Jhiqui and many others, but the richest man in Qarth had\nnot exaggerated his wealth. That, in addition to the horses and gifts pressed\nupon them by the remaining merchants&mdash;eager to see the back of her and thankful\nfor her dragons ridding them of Pyatt Pree. Her Dothraki insisted on adding\nanother braid, though the victory had been Drogon&rsquo;s. &nbsp;</p><p>When the sun climbed to its zenith and heat rose in colorless ribbons\nfrom the ground and still Ser Jorah had not returned, Daenerys gave to command\nto move out. The shadow of the warlock&rsquo;s tower gave her a queer feeling in her\nbelly. Piquant and bored, the three of her children cried and scratched at the\ngates of their enclosure. Having them close was as much an anchor to her as\nthem. Daenerys licked her dry lips, grateful for Drogon&rsquo;s weight on her right\nshoulder. Rheagal and Viserion climbed and slithered over her. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Lyks</i>,&rdquo; she said, stilling her\nsilver&rsquo;s startled snort with a tug of rein. The gates of Qarth were flown open.\nPale faces and watery eyes watched from the shade of their glorious towers as\nthey rode by.</p><p>&ldquo;Milk Men hide like cowards,&rdquo; Kovarro said, hacking a glob of spit onto\nthe neatly manicured street.</p><p>&ldquo;Would you rather we win free by the skin of our teeth as in the House\nof the Undying, blood of my blood?&rdquo; Daenerys said dryly, tossing a flyaway\nstrand of hair from her face. Kovarro&rsquo;s thick shoulders hunched beneath his\nwarm medium brown skin.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Vos, khaleesi</i>,&rdquo; he said,\nchastened. The youngest of her bloodriders, Kovarro was often the most eager to\ntest his mettle. Even his name was derived from the Dothraki word <i>kovarat</i> which meant &lsquo;to stand.&rsquo; As such,\nshe could not fault him too greatly. <i>A\nman cannot deny what it is in his nature.</i> The Sand Road stretched out ahead\nof them, a bleak expanse of crushed reddish gravel. Beyond were endless crags,\nmountains of scorched red sand, stunted trees, scorpions and snakes. The air\ntasted of dust and death, even the water bled red. Was she mad to urge her\npeople to face that again? It was a testament to their faith in her that they\nrode on with scarcely a whimper of protest. \n</p><p>Daenerys&rsquo; belly quavered at the baking heat of the Red Waste as Qarth&rsquo;s\ngates slammed closed behind them. She remembered how the heat leeched the\nstrength from her bones, the starving burning thirst that made her head ache\nand eyes burn. It had been a close thing, before Xaro Xohan Daxos took pity\nupon her. The void waited, so cool and patient.</p><p>&ldquo;Which way, khaleesi?&rdquo; Rakharo asked. Daenerys eased back in the saddle,\nhalting the khalasar with a gesture. She drummed her fingers on the pommel of\nher saddle. The decision held their lives in the balance. Not one made lightly.\n</p><p>&ldquo;We ride west.&rdquo; To the next city, and the next. And beyond that, Westeros\nand home. &nbsp; </p>",
