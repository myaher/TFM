                "content": "<p>I stan villains too so the whole purity accusation doesn&rsquo;t make sense. They&rsquo;re acting like we&rsquo;re telling them they can&rsquo;t like him or read AFFC/the other books for him mostly because they have no real argument to counter what we&rsquo;re saying. This isn&rsquo;t like say Stannis/Sansa which I dislike, Littlefinger actually sexually abused Sansa. They literally victim blame Sansa and engage in paedophilia apologism that people use against real human beings. Not only that they find the actual sexual abuse titillating and they call people triggered by their content&nbsp;&lsquo;prudes&rsquo; admitting that they find the paedophilia kinky instead of an actual sexual crime. They can&rsquo;t hide behind&nbsp;&lsquo;we age her up&rsquo; because Sansa in the books is a 13 year old, on the show she&rsquo;s 15/16 and they use what happened to her as ship fodder. It&rsquo;s like shipping Dolores Haze with Humbert, it&rsquo;s fucked up. On top of that they have a deep hatred for Sansa that anyone can see.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nthere is a difference between enjoying the relationship of sansa learning everything about LF so she can later destroy him and enjoy her development through this - but i dont get why people want it to be romantic or sexual.
