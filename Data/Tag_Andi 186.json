They often say funny things, behave strangely and even though it\u2019s a little bit mean, you can\u2019t help but laugh when some of them think their own tongue is falling out. However, when it came to Cyrus himself, he was terrified. He had dreaded the day that he would get his wisdom teeth removed for ages for the simple reason that he might say something stupid or let something slip. </p><p><br/></p><p>The dreaded day came on a frosty winter day when the first snow had just settled on the ground. Cyrus however, was not able to enjoy the snow, as he was going to the doctor to get his wisdom teeth removed. The procedure went just as planned, but after all, that was not what Cyrus was afraid of. In the car ride home, Cyrus\u2019 dad and Sharon had enjoyed a little laugh at the random but funny comments Cyrus was making, but up until now, he had managed to get by without saying something he\u2019d regret afterwards. Not long after they\u2019d gotten home, a knock was heard on the door. Cyrus, who was upstairs in his room, didn\u2019t notice, but Cyrus\u2019 dad and Sharon exchanged a confused look as they weren\u2019t expecting anyone. Cyrus dad went to open the door, only to find Tj standing outside.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cTj! I wasn\u2019t expecting you, but come in. You\u2019re always welcome.\u201d Norman happily greeted as he let the boy in. He had grown quite used to Tj\u2019s presence, as he and Cyrus had been spending a lot of time together recently. Norman explained what Cyrus had gone through during the day, but told him to go to Cyrus\u2019 room as he\u2019d still enjoy the company. Tj, who was completely unaware of the fact that Cyrus had just gotten his wisdom teeth removed, said that he could come back some other time. Norman assured him that no, Cyrus would be happy to see him, he always was. </p><p><br/></p><p>Tj made his way up the stairs and gently knocked on Cyrus\u2019 door. He waited for a few seconds without receiving an answer, but decided to go in anyway. Cyrus was sitting on his bed, and seemed to not have noticed Tj\u2019s knocking at all, as his face fell into shock as he saw the other boy. After just a few seconds though, Cyrus expression changed and he exclaimed:</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cTeej!\u201d He was wearing a huge (and adorable, according to Tj) grin.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHey, Underdog. I heard you got your wisdom teeth taken out today.\u201d Tj replied as he sat down on the bed next to Cyrus.</p><p><br/></p><p>Cyrus face turned into a confused look. \u201cI did?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Tj couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the other boy and his obliviousness, everything he did turned out to be cute. \u201dYeah, I\u2019m pretty sure you did.\u201d Tj chuckled and ruffled Cyrus hair playfully. Apparently, Cyrus didn\u2019t take much convincing, as his face immediately went back to a grin. </p><p>Probably feeling inspired by Tj, Cyrus put both of his hands in Tj\u2019s hair and ruffled it, causing most of the gel his had in his hair to disappear. Cyrus stopped after a few seconds and sat back and looked at Tj, as if he was examining him. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cTj, why do you put gel in your hair all the time? You\u2019re so cute without it.\u201d Cyrus said bluntly, and Tj\u2019s breath hitched. He did not expect that. He felt a blush spread across his cheeks, and faked a cough to not seem too flustered. \u201cI- I uh\u2026. I guess I\u2019ve just never really liked my hair without gel.\u201d Tj explained, to which Cyrus pouted. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI like it. It\u2019s cute. But that\u2019s not really a surprise, everything about you is cute.\u201d Cyrus said, and Tj almost choked. Cyrus, however, didn\u2019t seem to register that he had said something strange and unexpected.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re cute, Teej. Sometimes, actually most of the time, I just want to cup your face in my hands and kiss your cute lips on your cute face.\u201d Cyrus was rambling by this point, going on and on about how cute Tj was, and Tj was completely in shock, his face as red as a tomato. Did Cyrus like him?</p><p><br/></p><p>When Cyrus noticed that Tj didn\u2019t say anything, his smile faded and he looked down in his lap. \u201cDo- do you not want to kiss me back? Cyrus stuttered, pouting. Tj could not believe his ears, and he had to restrain himself from screaming out of excitement. He smiled at the boy sitting next to him.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cCyrus, I do want to kiss you. I want to kiss you so bad, but you\u2019re not really thinking straight right now, and I\u2019m not kissing you while your high.\u201d Tj explained, taking Cyrus\u2019 hand in his. Cyrus pout grew even bigger.</p><p><br/></p><p>Since Cyrus didn\u2019t seem satisfied, Tj continued.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll make you a deal. If you still want to kiss me tomorrow, let me know and I\u2019ll be here in a heartbeat. If you don\u2019t, then that\u2019s fine. But if you do, just know that I\u2019ve been waiting for that moment just as long as you have.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Cyrus face lit up again.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>The following day, Tj felt his phone buzz in his pocket. He took it out to find a text from Cyrus.</p><p><br/></p><p>Hey, Tj. I know I was pretty out of it yesterday, but I stand by my words. Come over? :)</p><p><br/></p><p>As he read those words, Tj was scared that his heart was going to fall out of his chest from beating too hard. Millions of thoughts were running through his head and the biggest one was fuck yes. He quickly put on his coat and headed for Cyrus\u2019 house, after all, he had promised to be there in a heartbeat. Thankfully, Cyrus lived not too far away, and he could easily walk there in 10 minutes. As he got closer to Cyrus\u2019 house, he could see that the boy was already waiting for him on his front porch. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Tj greeted when he got close enough, suddenly feeling nervous. Was this really happening?</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou came.\u201d Cyrus breathed.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI said I would.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI know, I just doubted it. I was afraid I scared you off yesterday.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cScared me off? Not really, I quite liked hearing how cute and cute and cute you think I am.\u201d Tj said, teasing him and giving him a light shove on his left shoulder. Cyrus blushed and looked down at their feet who were only inches apart, one step closer and they\u2019d almost touch.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cTo be fair, you are really cute.\u201d Cyrus managed to get out,not knowing where that bravery suddenly came from. This time, it was Tj\u2019s turn to blush. \u201cHas anyone ever told you that you\u2019re really cute, too?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOnce or twice, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to hear you say it, though.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>Tj took that extra step. They were almost touching now, but just almost.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cCyrus Goodman, you are really cute.\u201d He whispered as he examined every inch of the other boy\u2019s face. He\u2019d done it many times before, in class, at the spoon, when they were hanging out or at the swings, and Cyrus\u2019 beauty would catch Tj\u2019s breath every time. </p><p><br/></p><p>After a few seconds of silence, Cyrus gently placed his hand on Tj\u2019s cheek, and Tj put his arms around Cyrus\u2019 waist. Before Tj could register what happened, his lips were on Cyrus\u2019. They were a lot softer that he expected, and moved perfectly in sync with his own. They parted and all they could do was smile.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cDo it again.\u201d Tj said.</p>",

They often say funny things, behave strangely and even though it\u2019s a little bit mean, you can\u2019t help but laugh when some of them think their own tongue is falling out. However, when it came to Cyrus himself, he was terrified. He had dreaded the day that he would get his wisdom teeth removed for ages for the simple reason that he might say something stupid or let something slip. </p><p><br></p><p>The dreaded day came on a frosty winter day when the first snow had just settled on the ground. Cyrus however, was not able to enjoy the snow, as he was going to the doctor to get his wisdom teeth removed. The procedure went just as planned, but after all, that was not what Cyrus was afraid of. In the car ride home, Cyrus\u2019 dad and Sharon had enjoyed a little laugh at the random but funny comments Cyrus was making, but up until now, he had managed to get by without saying something he\u2019d regret afterwards. Not long after they\u2019d gotten home, a knock was heard on the door. Cyrus, who was upstairs in his room, didn\u2019t notice, but Cyrus\u2019 dad and Sharon exchanged a confused look as they weren\u2019t expecting anyone. Cyrus dad went to open the door, only to find Tj standing outside.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cTj! I wasn\u2019t expecting you, but come in. You\u2019re always welcome.\u201d Norman happily greeted as he let the boy in. He had grown quite used to Tj\u2019s presence, as he and Cyrus had been spending a lot of time together recently. Norman explained what Cyrus had gone through during the day, but told him to go to Cyrus\u2019 room as he\u2019d still enjoy the company. Tj, who was completely unaware of the fact that Cyrus had just gotten his wisdom teeth removed, said that he could come back some other time. Norman assured him that no, Cyrus would be happy to see him, he always was. </p><p><br></p><p>Tj made his way up the stairs and gently knocked on Cyrus\u2019 door. He waited for a few seconds without receiving an answer, but decided to go in anyway. Cyrus was sitting on his bed, and seemed to not have noticed Tj\u2019s knocking at all, as his face fell into shock as he saw the other boy. After just a few seconds though, Cyrus expression changed and he exclaimed:</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cTeej!\u201d He was wearing a huge (and adorable, according to Tj) grin.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHey, Underdog. I heard you got your wisdom teeth taken out today.\u201d Tj replied as he sat down on the bed next to Cyrus.</p><p><br></p><p>Cyrus face turned into a confused look. \u201cI did?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Tj couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the other boy and his obliviousness, everything he did turned out to be cute. \u201dYeah, I\u2019m pretty sure you did.\u201d Tj chuckled and ruffled Cyrus hair playfully. Apparently, Cyrus didn\u2019t take much convincing, as his face immediately went back to a grin. </p><p>Probably feeling inspired by Tj, Cyrus put both of his hands in Tj\u2019s hair and ruffled it, causing most of the gel his had in his hair to disappear. Cyrus stopped after a few seconds and sat back and looked at Tj, as if he was examining him. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cTj, why do you put gel in your hair all the time? You\u2019re so cute without it.\u201d Cyrus said bluntly, and Tj\u2019s breath hitched. He did not expect that. He felt a blush spread across his cheeks, and faked a cough to not seem too flustered. \u201cI- I uh\u2026. I guess I\u2019ve just never really liked my hair without gel.\u201d Tj explained, to which Cyrus pouted. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI like it. It\u2019s cute. But that\u2019s not really a surprise, everything about you is cute.\u201d Cyrus said, and Tj almost choked. Cyrus, however, didn\u2019t seem to register that he had said something strange and unexpected.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re cute, Teej. Sometimes, actually most of the time, I just want to cup your face in my hands and kiss your cute lips on your cute face.\u201d Cyrus was rambling by this point, going on and on about how cute Tj was, and Tj was completely in shock, his face as red as a tomato. Did Cyrus like him?</p><p><br></p><p>When Cyrus noticed that Tj didn\u2019t say anything, his smile faded and he looked down in his lap. \u201cDo- do you not want to kiss me back? Cyrus stuttered, pouting. Tj could not believe his ears, and he had to restrain himself from screaming out of excitement. He smiled at the boy sitting next to him.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cCyrus, I do want to kiss you. I want to kiss you so bad, but you\u2019re not really thinking straight right now, and I\u2019m not kissing you while your high.\u201d Tj explained, taking Cyrus\u2019 hand in his. Cyrus pout grew even bigger.</p><p><br></p><p>Since Cyrus didn\u2019t seem satisfied, Tj continued.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll make you a deal. If you still want to kiss me tomorrow, let me know and I\u2019ll be here in a heartbeat. If you don\u2019t, then that\u2019s fine. But if you do, just know that I\u2019ve been waiting for that moment just as long as you have.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Cyrus face lit up again.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The following day, Tj felt his phone buzz in his pocket. He took it out to find a text from Cyrus.</p><p><br></p><p>Hey, Tj. I know I was pretty out of it yesterday, but I stand by my words. Come over? :)</p><p><br></p><p>As he read those words, Tj was scared that his heart was going to fall out of his chest from beating too hard. Millions of thoughts were running through his head and the biggest one was fuck yes. He quickly put on his coat and headed for Cyrus\u2019 house, after all, he had promised to be there in a heartbeat. Thankfully, Cyrus lived not too far away, and he could easily walk there in 10 minutes. As he got closer to Cyrus\u2019 house, he could see that the boy was already waiting for him on his front porch. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Tj greeted when he got close enough, suddenly feeling nervous.
