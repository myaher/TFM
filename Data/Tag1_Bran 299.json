You then turned to watch your \u2018brothers\u2019 as they followed, basically being carried by the servants. Your gripped tightened around the Hound&rsquo;s hand as he helped you down the uneven dirt street. You were young, only 10 but not stupid. </p><p>You understood that your father was the King but your mother was not the queen, which made you a bastard. </p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d you whispered up toward the hound, your long gown dragging in the street, accumulating slight bits of snow as you moved. </p><p>The large man hummed, keeping his answer sort and sweet as he glanced down at you. He knew how improper it was to address you but he didn&rsquo;t mind. Anyone who cared to question it could burn in hell. </p><p>\u201cThe Stark home\u201d He whispered back, lifting you onto his shoulders, saving your gown from the harsh conditions. The last thing he needed was for your silks to be ruined on top of everything else. </p><p>When you finally got to the square, you saw all of the Starks lined up and waiting for your fathers word.</p><p>Each person in the crowd held their breath as he surveyed each face in turn until, all at once, it was over. </p><p> \u201cMy son for your daughter\u201d He said simply gesturing to a red headed girl and Eddard Stark nods, shaking hands with your father before he sees a small boy from behind the oldest Stark. </p><p>Everyone had been waiting for that. It was only expected that Sansa wed Joffrey and brought together the two kingdoms but something stronger than that, was a son of the north. </p><p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d Robert asks holding a hand out to the boy, who looked around your age, who stepped forward, away from Eddard and toward your father&rsquo;s outstretched hand. </p><p>\u201cMy name is Bran Stark\u201d he mutters nervously causing my father to smile. \u201cThis one shall marry my youngest\u201d Robert bellows, turning quickly to gesture to you. </p><p>You weren&rsquo;t sure how to react, not used to being in the spotlight. Even so, you waved to the little dark haired Lord. You were now betrothed to Brandon Stark, the only trouble was you didn&rsquo;t realize it. </p><p>\u201cHound, put down the girl\u201d My father commands, his voice commanding but kind toward you. Sandor did as his king ordered, setting you down next to the boy, though he could feel your hesitance radiating off of your flesh. </p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t uncommon for curtain collateral to be put in place when deals were made, and this was no exception. You&rsquo;re father wanted to make sure that your wedding would go off without a hitch and it wouldn&rsquo;t work if they just shipped you off to Winterfell on your birthday&hellip;so he made a choice. </p><p>\u201cShe will stay here, in Westeros with you until they come of age\u201d My father requests before turning and walking away.</p><p>That was all that was said, and there was no going back on the deal that had been made in the eyes of the seven. </p><p>You turned to follow your family but was held in place by the Hound. \u201cHound, what is happening, why can&rsquo;t I come with you?\u201d you asked, fear setting in now \u201cYou will stay here, little bird\u201d He says, reluctantly turning and leaving me there as well. </p><p>Your family was gone before you knew what had happened, you were left alone with the Starks now.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cFollow me dear\u201d a lady you recognized as Catelyn Stark suggested, holding a hand out to you, which you politely refused. </p><p>\u201cI will wait here, for the Hound thank you\u201d you informed, earning an earnest smile from the red haired woman. She too had left her home for marriage, and if anyone in this whole frozen land understood what you were going through, it was her. \u201cTake your time\u201d she allowed simply, turning to leave me. </p><p>You sat for hours on end, without moving from your spot. That is until the small boy they called Bran came to sit aside you.</p><p> \u201cAre you coming in for supper?\u201d Bran asks, his voice breaking through the darkness as he searched your face for any cues. You scoffed at his crude suggestion &ldquo;I have to wait for my family&rdquo; You didn&rsquo;t hardly get the words out before Bran laughed at you, &ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t coming you know?&rdquo; he hummed, curious if you understood that they&rsquo;d left you here for real. </p><p>\u201cWhy would they leave me?\u201d you ask but he shrugs \u201call I know is that if you don&rsquo;t come inside you&rsquo;ll freeze\u201d he says wrapping a fur shawl around your soft arms. You weren&rsquo;t going to lie, you were cold but still you shielded away from his touch. </p><p>&ldquo;Come&rdquo; he groaned, not believing your stubbornness. He reached down to take your cold hands in his own which he used to lift you up from the ground. You didn&rsquo;t want to follow his suggestion, but weren&rsquo;t given much of a choice as he lead you inside what you assumed was his home. </p><p>Robb was the first to speak upon seeing you, holding Bran&rsquo;s small hand. \u00a0\u201cYou brought her inside\u201d Robb shouts as your enter the hall, clearly amused. He, unlike you, understood what was going on. \u00a0\u201cI was beginning to think the little one would get frost bite\u201d Jon joked, joining in on the fun. </p><p>\u201cKeep her warm, we wouldn&rsquo;t want your betrothed dead before night fall\u201d Catelyn whispers, careful to keep her voice low enough, and \u00a0just out of range so that you wouldn&rsquo;t hear. Bran nodded, pulling you to the back of the hut by the fire. He held you tightly to his chest, It wasn&rsquo;t necessarily romantic but it kept you warm and you would never forget the kindness you got from Bran on this day. \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>The next morning you sat outside with the gorgeous lady Sansa and her younger sister Arya, who you didn&rsquo;t know to well yet but liked all the same. She didn&rsquo;t carry herself in the way any other woman did, and you enjoyed that spiteful passion. <br/></p><p> You poised the needle into the fabric and outlined a pattern. You weren&rsquo;t too good at it yet but you were trying your best. You continued your tireless work until you heard a simple noise, and turned to see Bran leaning against the wall, his eyes locked on your frame. </p><p>You waved in his direction, and he only smiled at you in reply. &ldquo;He likes you, you know? Bran&rdquo; Sansa asked, instantly catching your attention. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; You ask, still looking at her as if she&rsquo;d sprouted a second head. &ldquo;He fancies you silly&rdquo; Arya groaned, making you brush harshly, looking down at your face. </p><p>At her words, you couldn&rsquo;t help but glance up, hoping to see the little, dark haired boy you had come to have so. You saw only the jarred cobblestone, no Bran to be found. </p><p>After excusing yourself, you headed toward the house. As soon as your small hand fell on the knob, you heard a faint noise and turned your head up. </p><p>Above you was Bran Stark, sitting atop a building, and you nearly fell in surprise. &ldquo;What are you doing Bran?&rdquo; you squealed, but he put his finger to his lips, trying to encourage your silence. Slowly he offered a hand to you which you took hesitantly, allowing him to lift you onto the ledge he was perched on. </p><p>You held to the cobblestone almost as hard as you were holding Bran\u2019s wrist. </p><p> He shifted your weight into him further, gripping your waist before leading your hands to the frigid wall \u201cHold on, I wont let you fall\u201d Bran suggested, not fazing you for a minute. \u201cPromise?\u201dyou wondered, your voice shaking and he nods \u201cPromise\u201d he swears moving a bit away from you.</p><p>Bran took a hand from you and moved up the wall, only stopping a few feet away to look down at you. It was clear he was expecting you to join him but it was hard with so much fear clouding your judgement. If only your father could see you now. </p><p>You hurried to join him, spite driving you now. Once you got there, you were at a loss for words, it was beautiful. &ldquo;Wow&rdquo; was all you could say, taking in the expanse of the north, all dressed in white. Bran looked up at you from where he was resting, curious as to what got such a reaction out of you. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked, instantly earning a gesture from you out into the air. </p><p>&ldquo;All this, every day of your life&rdquo; you urged, not understanding how he was so casual about so much beauty. You were in awe of the snow and large mountains, unlike you ever had before. </p><p>\u201cIt is gorgeous\u201d you added and he smirks \u201cprobably not as gorgeous as Kings Landing though\u201d Bran&rsquo;s tone irritated you, he always talked about Kings Landing as if it was so great, if only he knew. \u201cKings landing is not as great as it seems Bran\u201d you reminded, following him down the scaffolding, until your feet were safely on the ground again. </p>",

You then turned to watch your \u2018brothers\u2019 as they followed, basically being carried by the servants. Your gripped tightened around the Hound\u2019s hand as he helped you down the uneven dirt street. You were young, only 10 but not stupid. </p><p>You understood that your father was the King but your mother was not the queen, which made you a bastard. </p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d you whispered up toward the hound, your long gown dragging in the street, accumulating slight bits of snow as you moved. </p><p>The large man hummed, keeping his answer sort and sweet as he glanced down at you. He knew how improper it was to address you but he didn\u2019t mind. Anyone who cared to question it could burn in hell. </p><p>\u201cThe Stark home\u201d He whispered back, lifting you onto his shoulders, saving your gown from the harsh conditions. The last thing he needed was for your silks to be ruined on top of everything else. </p><p>When you finally got to the square, you saw all of the Starks lined up and waiting for your fathers word.</p><p>Each person in the crowd held their breath as he surveyed each face in turn until, all at once, it was over. </p><p> \u201cMy son for your daughter\u201d He said simply gesturing to a red headed girl and Eddard Stark nods, shaking hands with your father before he sees a small boy from behind the oldest Stark. </p><p>Everyone had been waiting for that. It was only expected that Sansa wed Joffrey and brought together the two kingdoms but something stronger than that, was a son of the north. </p><p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d Robert asks holding a hand out to the boy, who looked around your age, who stepped forward, away from Eddard and toward your father\u2019s outstretched hand. </p><p>\u201cMy name is Bran Stark\u201d he mutters nervously causing my father to smile. \u201cThis one shall marry my youngest\u201d Robert bellows, turning quickly to gesture to you. </p><p>You weren\u2019t sure how to react, not used to being in the spotlight. Even so, you waved to the little dark haired Lord. You were now betrothed to Brandon Stark, the only trouble was you didn\u2019t realize it. </p><p>\u201cHound, put down the girl\u201d My father commands, his voice commanding but kind toward you. Sandor did as his king ordered, setting you down next to the boy, though he could feel your hesitance radiating off of your flesh. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t uncommon for curtain collateral to be put in place when deals were made, and this was no exception. You\u2019re father wanted to make sure that your wedding would go off without a hitch and it wouldn\u2019t work if they just shipped you off to Winterfell on your birthday\u2026so he made a choice. </p><p>\u201cShe will stay here, in Westeros with you until they come of age\u201d My father requests before turning and walking away.</p><p>That was all that was said, and there was no going back on the deal that had been made in the eyes of the seven. </p><p>You turned to follow your family but was held in place by the Hound. \u201cHound, what is happening, why can\u2019t I come with you?\u201d you asked, fear setting in now \u201cYou will stay here, little bird\u201d He says, reluctantly turning and leaving me there as well. </p><p>Your family was gone before you knew what had happened, you were left alone with the Starks now.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cFollow me dear\u201d a lady you recognized as Catelyn Stark suggested, holding a hand out to you, which you politely refused. </p><p>\u201cI will wait here, for the Hound thank you\u201d you informed, earning an earnest smile from the red haired woman. She too had left her home for marriage, and if anyone in this whole frozen land understood what you were going through, it was her. \u201cTake your time\u201d she allowed simply, turning to leave me. </p><p>You sat for hours on end, without moving from your spot. That is until the small boy they called Bran came to sit aside you.</p><p> \u201cAre you coming in for supper?\u201d Bran asks, his voice breaking through the darkness as he searched your face for any cues. You scoffed at his crude suggestion \u201cI have to wait for my family\u201d You didn\u2019t hardly get the words out before Bran laughed at you, \u201cThey aren\u2019t coming you know?\u201d he hummed, curious if you understood that they\u2019d left you here for real. </p><p>\u201cWhy would they leave me?\u201d you ask but he shrugs \u201call I know is that if you don\u2019t come inside you\u2019ll freeze\u201d he says wrapping a fur shawl around your soft arms. You weren\u2019t going to lie, you were cold but still you shielded away from his touch. </p><p>\u201cCome\u201d he groaned, not believing your stubbornness. He reached down to take your cold hands in his own which he used to lift you up from the ground. You didn\u2019t want to follow his suggestion, but weren\u2019t given much of a choice as he lead you inside what you assumed was his home. </p><p>Robb was the first to speak upon seeing you, holding Bran\u2019s small hand. \u00a0\u201cYou brought her inside\u201d Robb shouts as your enter the hall, clearly amused. He, unlike you, understood what was going on. \u00a0\u201cI was beginning to think the little one would get frost bite\u201d Jon joked, joining in on the fun. </p><p>\u201cKeep her warm, we wouldn\u2019t want your betrothed dead before night fall\u201d Catelyn whispers, careful to keep her voice low enough, and \u00a0just out of range so that you wouldn\u2019t hear. Bran nodded, pulling you to the back of the hut by the fire. He held you tightly to his chest, It wasn\u2019t necessarily romantic but it kept you warm and you would never forget the kindness you got from Bran on this day. \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>The next morning you sat outside with the gorgeous lady Sansa and her younger sister Arya, who you didn\u2019t know to well yet but liked all the same. She didn\u2019t carry herself in the way any other woman did, and you enjoyed that spiteful passion. <br></p><p> You poised the needle into the fabric and outlined a pattern. You weren\u2019t too good at it yet but you were trying your best. You continued your tireless work until you heard a simple noise, and turned to see Bran leaning against the wall, his eyes locked on your frame. </p><p>You waved in his direction, and he only smiled at you in reply. \u201cHe likes you, you know? Bran\u201d Sansa asked, instantly catching your attention. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d You ask, still looking at her as if she\u2019d sprouted a second head. \u201cHe fancies you silly\u201d Arya groaned, making you brush harshly, looking down at your face. </p><p>At her words, you couldn\u2019t help but glance up, hoping to see the little, dark haired boy you had come to have so. You saw only the jarred cobblestone, no Bran to be found. </p><p>After excusing yourself, you headed toward the house. As soon as your small hand fell on the knob, you heard a faint noise and turned your head up. </p><p>Above you was Bran Stark, sitting atop a building, and you nearly fell in surprise. \u201cWhat are you doing Bran?\u201d you squealed, but he put his finger to his lips, trying to encourage your silence. Slowly he offered a hand to you which you took hesitantly, allowing him to lift you onto the ledge he was perched on. </p><p>You held to the cobblestone almost as hard as you were holding Bran\u2019s wrist. </p><p> He shifted your weight into him further, gripping your waist before leading your hands to the frigid wall \u201cHold on, I wont let you fall\u201d Bran suggested, not fazing you for a minute. \u201cPromise?\u201dyou wondered, your voice shaking and he nods \u201cPromise\u201d he swears moving a bit away from you.</p><p>Bran took a hand from you and moved up the wall, only stopping a few feet away to look down at you. It was clear he was expecting you to join him but it was hard with so much fear clouding your judgement. If only your father could see you now. </p><p>You hurried to join him, spite driving you now. Once you got there, you were at a loss for words, it was beautiful. \u201cWow\u201d was all you could say, taking in the expanse of the north, all dressed in white. Bran looked up at you from where he was resting, curious as to what got such a reaction out of you. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked, instantly earning a gesture from you out into the air. </p><p>\u201cAll this, every day of your life\u201d you urged, not understanding how he was so casual about so much beauty. You were in awe of the snow and large mountains, unlike you ever had before. </p><p>\u201cIt is gorgeous\u201d you added and he smirks \u201cprobably not as gorgeous as Kings Landing though\u201d Bran\u2019s tone irritated you, he always talked about Kings Landing as if it was so great, if only he knew. \u201cKings landing is not as great as it seems Bran\u201d you reminded, following him down the scaffolding, until your feet were safely on the ground again. </p></p>",
