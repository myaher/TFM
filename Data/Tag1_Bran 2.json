He saw his mother sitting alone in a cabin, looking at a bloodstained knife on a table in front of her, as the rowers pulled at their oars and Ser Rodrik leaned across a rail, shaking and heaving. A storm was gathering ahead of them, a vast dark roaring lashed by lightning, but somehow they could not see it.<br/>\nHe looked south, and saw the great blue-green rush of the Trident. He saw his father pleading with the king, his face etched with grief. He saw Sansa crying herself to sleep at night, and he saw Arya watching in silence and holding her secrets hard in her heart. There were shadows all around them. One shadow was dark as ash, with the terrible face of a hound. Another was armored like the sun, golden and beautiful. Over them both loomed a giant in armor made of stone, but when he opened his visor, there was nothing inside but darkness and thick black blood.",

After season 7, we were joined by Arya fans after Arya got the same shitty writing because she shared scenes with Sansa. <br/></p><p>I remember Dany fans unfollowing me on tumblr for daring to dislike the character and writing big essays on how Dany and Sansa were the same and both characters should be equally liked blah blah etc. <br/></p><p>And now seeing Dany fans\u2019 reaction to Sansa? lol! Welcome to the club guys. <br/></p><!-- more --><p>Sansa is a terrible, terrible Mary Sue character on the show who will ruin any character she shares scenes with. That is a fact. Jon Snow was actually a decent character on the show till season 5 - until they dumped Sansa into his plot and made it all about how awesome she was. <br/></p><p>Bran. Bran has actual ruling experience - he was the prince of WF while Robb was fighting in the south. He has learned from the same teachers as Robb and Jon. In the books he has emotions and feelings and ideas and pro-actively does things. This is a character that is going to be King in the books - either of the 7K or WF. But the minute he gets to WF, they nerf him and reduce him to a monotonous robot with nothing to do. Why? Because they wanted Sansa as lady of WF strutting around looking important and doing shit like instructing armorers how to make armor. The ending of the series made no sense with Bran as king - because instead of spending time on building up Bran as a leader - D&amp;D were busy writing their Sansa fanfiction. <br/></p><p>Arya? She was not even an actual character there at the end. Just a cheerleader for Sansa. They basically gave her entire North/WF plot to Sansa. Which means without her book plot,\u00a0 they gave her the NK plot - which means Jon\u2019s WW plot ended up a bust. As much as I liked Arya and Gendry hooking up , it\u2019s a bit sad to go through the Arya tag or see Arya posts on my dash that\u2019s all about Gendrya. Gendry is more or less a side character in Arya\u2019s story in the books. And that\u2019s what Arya\u2019s character has been reduced to on the show - Gendrya. She had no scenes with Tyrion or Dany, the Jon-Arya relationship was non-existent, the political know how of the North she learned from Ned in the books was not there because she is only good for killing and at the end she gets kicked out of the North. You know who got all this? Sansa. <br/></p><p>I mean towards the end, it was Sansa making decisions about soldiers and defense and war planning and refugees and Jon just standing there looking gormless. Jon, Bran and Arya - the 3 characters most connected to the North - all got shat on so that D&amp;D could write their Sansa fanfiction.</p><p>I don\u2019t even have to say anything about what happened to Dany the moment she started sharing scenes with Sansa. Or Tyrion being called a fool by Sansa. Or Edmure being asked to shut up and sit down. Or Sansa snarking at LF. Other characters constantly telling us how smart Sansa was. Arya supporting Sansa over Jon and telling him that Sansa was family and hinting that he better chose properly.

They tried to make Cersei sympathetic because she\u2019s a mother. Dany\u2019s story was more about benevolent Tyrion - the guy who bitterly rapes a slave because she was repulsed by him and who GRRM has called a\u00a0\u2018good villain\u2019 -\u00a0 and how much of a good guy he was. And so Dany, Jon, Arya, Bran, Jaime etc. got shitty characterization and plot because D&amp;D were really telling Sansa, Cersei and Tyrion\u2019s stories.

Welcome to the club guys. <br></p>[[MORE]]<p>Sansa is a terrible, terrible Mary Sue character on the show who will ruin any character she shares scenes with. That is a fact. Jon Snow was actually a decent character on the show till season 5 - until they dumped Sansa into his plot and made it all about how awesome she was. <br></p><p>Bran. Bran has actual ruling experience - he was the prince of WF while Robb was fighting in the south. He has learned from the same teachers as Robb and Jon. In the books he has emotions and feelings and ideas and pro-actively does things. This is a character that is going to be King in the books - either of the 7K or WF. But the minute he gets to WF, they nerf him and reduce him to a monotonous robot with nothing to do. Why? Because they wanted Sansa as lady of WF strutting around looking important and doing shit like instructing armorers how to make armor. The ending of the series made no sense with Bran as king - because instead of spending time on building up Bran as a leader - D&amp;D were busy writing their Sansa fanfiction. <br></p><p>Arya? She was not even an actual character there at the end. Just a cheerleader for Sansa. They basically gave her entire North/WF plot to Sansa. Which means without her book plot,\u00a0 they gave her the NK plot - which means Jon\u2019s WW plot ended up a bust. As much as I liked Arya and Gendry hooking up , it\u2019s a bit sad to go through the Arya tag or see Arya posts on my dash that\u2019s all about Gendrya. Gendry is more or less a side character in Arya\u2019s story in the books. And that\u2019s what Arya\u2019s character has been reduced to on the show - Gendrya. She had no scenes with Tyrion or Dany, the Jon-Arya relationship was non-existent, the political know how of the North she learned from Ned in the books was not there because she is only good for killing and at the end she gets kicked out of the North. You know who got all this? Sansa. <br></p><p>I mean towards the end, it was Sansa making decisions about soldiers and defense and war planning and refugees and Jon just standing there looking gormless. Jon, Bran and Arya - the 3 characters most connected to the North - all got shat on so that D&amp;D could write their Sansa fanfiction.</p><p>I don\u2019t even have to say anything about what happened to Dany the moment she started sharing scenes with Sansa. Or Tyrion being called a fool by Sansa. Or Edmure being asked to shut up and sit down. Or Sansa snarking at LF. Other characters constantly telling us how smart Sansa was.
