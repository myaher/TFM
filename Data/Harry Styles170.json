Attackers will be blocked.NEW: I will now be cutting off or removing submissions that are just repeating discussions that have already taken place.

As an added note, we are aware that not all Harries are angry people but we sometimes generalize due to character limits, apologies in advance but we know there are many lovely, kind, friendly Harries out there and we don't mean to offend you. <!-- Start of StatCounter Code for Tumblr -->\n \n \n \n<!-- End of StatCounter Code for Tumblr -->",

That had become the first thing I felt when I woke up. For the first few days, it had taken a few seconds before reality would kick in. I\u2019d think everything was okay, and that Layla didn\u2019t hate me, but that hadn\u2019t lasted for very long. Quickly, self-loathing was there before I\u2019d even fully woken up. I\u2019d keep my eyes closed tight and hope that I could fall back to sleep before my brain started its daily routine of telling me what a fucking idiot I was. From the moment I was no longer deep in sleep, I regretted everything.</p><p>The second thing I usually felt was a toss-up between a headache or the need to vomit, and this morning, after a particularly heavy night, it was both.</p><!-- more --><p>Careful not to wake the sleeping body next to me, I got out of bed and stumbled to the bathroom. I managed to lock the door before having to launch myself at the toilet and spewing the contents of my stomach into it. With my hands on either side of the seat, steadying me as my upper-body lurched and convulsed with every stomach contraction, I threw everything up until there was nothing but bile. My head throbbed twice as hard as it had done before, feeling as though I was being repeatedly kicked in the temple, and as I collapsed into a sitting position on the cool, tiled floor, I thought that having my innards try to escape my body through my mouth was still preferable to the ache of missing Layla.</p><p>I sat in a daze, staring at the marble pattern on the tiles, and building up the energy to get up and take something to ease the pounding pain in my head. I hoped the noise I\u2019d probably made hadn\u2019t woken up the girl in my bed, the same girl I\u2019d told Layla I would never see again, if she didn\u2019t want me to. I hadn\u2019t intended to have sex with her, she was just one of the few people who knew about Layla, and one of the only ones who was sympathetic and understanding. I\u2019d left London after finally accepting that I couldn\u2019t stay there, and I wanted comfort from someone who didn\u2019t think Layla was a terrible person, someone who\u2019d even encouraged me to try and make things right, even though I\u2019d lied to her too. I needed a shoulder to cry on, and we ended up in bed together.</p><p>Cringing, I realised that her possibly hearing me being sick was the least of my problems, and it made me clamber to my feet. Shuffling over to the sink, I glanced at the dishevelled reflection in the medicine cabinet and groaned with disgust. Somehow, I managed to look worse than I felt. I yanked the cabinet door open and took out some painkillers - wincing at the sound of the plastic as it crinkled in my fingers noisily - and popped out two pills. Then, cramming them into my mouth, I drank from the cold water tap to help swallow them down, whilst also ridding myself of the horrible taste of vomit in my mouth.</p><p>I considered just climbing back into bed, pulling the covers over my head and just sleeping my hangover away. But, remembering that I wouldn\u2019t be alone if I left the bathroom, I decided to shower, and hoped that the water washed away the previous night\u2019s mistakes, and all my other ones along with it. <br/></p><p>It had been well over a month since Layla kicked me out of her house, and despite all the ways I\u2019d tried to distract myself, still nothing had eased the pain. I felt shattered and broken, my stomach was pained with an emptiness that I couldn\u2019t fill, and I couldn\u2019t focus on anything. For the first time in my life, I truly understood the meaning of heartache because I felt it all of the time.</p><p>I got straight out of London. I left Layla\u2019s house and drove straight up to Holmes-Chapel, to my mum\u2019s. I needed the comfort of her and Robin, and I wanted to lick my wounds in a place that was familiar and safe.</p><p>Mum was surprisingly supportive - not that I expected her to really show how happy she felt that my relationship with Lil was over - but I knew that deep down she was pleased and relieved. It had worried her- the age difference, the messy divorce- and both her and Gemma hadn\u2019t met Layla in particularly great situations. Hindsight told me that I\u2019d let my excitement for them to meet her get the better of me, and it made them dislike our relationship even more.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s over?\u201d Mum asked as we sat together on the sofa and I told her everything. \u00a0\u201cYou thought it was finished before and you still ended up back together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I shook my head and looked down at the sleeping cat on my knee, who was stretched out comfortably, without a single care in the world. I envied her. \u201cI think it\u2019s for real this time, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything I can do to fix what I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you have to accept her decision and try to move on, love. Sometimes, even though we want it so badly, some things just aren\u2019t meant to be. You and Layla just aren\u2019t right for each other, and one day, when you\u2019ve found someone who is right for you, you will see that.\u201d Mum put an arm around my shoulder and kissed my temple tenderly. \u201cIf you can\u2019t fix it, then leave her alone.\u201d</p><p>But, despite knowing I should follow her advice, I couldn\u2019t stop trying to fight Layla\u2019s decision. I\u2019d call and text constantly, begging to be heard and to be given an opportunity to make things better, but I never got anything back. All I got in return was a taste of my own medicine when she was forced to block any way I had of contacting her. But, when I travelled back to London with hopes of drowning my sorrows with friends over the new year, I took to showing up on her doorstep late at night instead of taking the rather obvious hint that she didn\u2019t want anything to do with me.</p><p>Usually drunk, I\u2019d kneel down in front of her door and plead through the letterbox to a wall of dark silence. Layla, of course, never responded. She never told me to leave or threaten to call the police, she just sat at the top of the stairs -cold and unmoving- and listened to my drunken pleas for her to reconsider until I gave up and went home. I couldn\u2019t ever really see her, save from the odd shadowy figure creeping across the hallway, but with that, and all the lights being turned off suddenly, I knew she was listening. And it only frustrated me more. I\u2019d want to bang my fists on the door, to stand in the middle of the street and shout and cause a scene. I wanted to do whatever it took until she let me in. But, even in inebriation, I was aware that it would only make everything worse for both of us. I felt incapable of leaving her alone but I wanted to at least spare her the embarrassment of the police being called, or worse, the press. \u00a0</p><p>Eventually, I would leave. I\u2019d call for a car and I\u2019d head home, or to a friend\u2019s house, where I would pass out. Then, the next morning, I\u2019d wake up and feel a wave of shame crash over me, the morning\u2019s harsh light seeming to make the regret that much more worse as I laid in bed, or on a sofa, and recalled what a mess I kept making of things. I\u2019d tell myself I was an idiot, and I\u2019d vow never to do it again, that this would be the last time. But it never was. Whether it was a day or two later, I\u2019d end up back in front of Lil\u2019s door.</p><p>The night that resulted in me running to LA had started well. I agreed to go out with Nick, and a few other people I knew through him, to belatedly celebrate New Year. He seemed to be aware that I was upset about something (thanks to my mum, no doubt) and he tried to subtly ask what was going on. But, sensing my reluctance to open up about it, he didn\u2019t push any further and just did his best to distract and cheer me up.</p><p>At first, it worked. For the first time in weeks, I found myself genuinely laughing, actually having fun instead of just pretending for the benefit of those around me, and noticing the knot in the pit of my stomach a little less. But the later it got, and the drunker everyone around me became, the more my mood started to drop. I found myself looking around at my friends and wishing I was somewhere else - like the age old cliche - because for all the people in the room, I felt utterly alone.</p><p>So, I left. I made my excuses, jumped in a cab and gave the driver Layla\u2019s address.</p><p>Having passed out almost as soon as the car started moving, I woke up when I realised it had come to a stop outside of Layla\u2019s house. Blearily handing money over, I stumbled out onto the pavement and waited for the taxi to drive off.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t anyone around, the street was quiet, and most of the other houses were in complete darkness apart from the occasional blue glow of a TV flickering in a dimly lit room. Curtains closed, I could see Layla\u2019s bedroom light was on. I grabbed at my stomach as it lurched. It was both comforting to know she was close and agonising knowing that it was highly unlikely she\u2019d acknowledge me. Ignoring the voice in my head telling me I should just go home, I opened the black, metal gate, walked up the tiled path, and rang the doorbell, starting the whole charade once again.</p><p>Ringing the bell a few more times, I peered through the mottled glass and was surprised to see a perfectly clear outline of Layla standing at the top of the stairs. She hadn\u2019t turned all the lights off, and wasn\u2019t pretending that she wasn\u2019t there but, to my dismay, she wasn\u2019t moving either. Crouching down, I opened the letterbox to try see her better, but all I saw was her sitting down in the usual spot.</p><p>Encouraged by her not hiding away, I asked, \u201cLil, please open the door.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to fight, I just want to talk.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cI hate doing this, but baby,\u201d I paused, emotion taking over and my voice cracking, \u201cBaby, I miss you.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Her silhouette made the silence worse, confronting me with the truth that all the times I\u2019d sat crying and begging for audience, she had been able to listen to me, unmoved. I\u2019d always known she was there, but now there was no denying that Layla had heard me and had been able to resist coming to comfort me.</p><p>Resting my head against the red painted door, I started to cry. The frustration of being ignored was overwhelming. I didn\u2019t know what else I could say or do to get her to listen to me. I knew I\u2019d fucked up, and it had haunted me since I saw the look of pain in Layla\u2019s eyes when I\u2019d admitted I\u2019d cheated on her. But I never expected to feel like she hated me, as though I meant nothing, as though we meant nothing. I took a deep breath and tried again, once again ignoring everything in me that told me to just to leave her alone.</p><p>\u201cLayla, Lil, please, can we just talk? I promise, I will leave you alone, but I just want to speak to you.\u201d</p><p>Again - nothing but an agonising wall of silence.</p><p>I watched her silhouette slowly get up, and for a split second I hoped she was about to finally relent, but when the lights went out and everything turned dark again, she shut me out once more.</p><p>My heart broke with a fresh, painful wound. I slumped down heavily onto my backside and leant against the brick wall. I knew I should give up, that I should just get up and go home to save more pain and embarrassment. Layla wasn\u2019t going to let me in, that was clearer to me now more than ever, but I couldn\u2019t move. Frustration was now overruled by defeat, and though I\u2019d gone through the same feeling several times before in the very same spot, it was finally setting in that even if I turned up on her doorstep every night - she was never, ever going to let me in.</p><p>With my head in the crook of my elbow, I sobbed. I sat in the covered doorway - the rough \u2018Welcome\u2019 mat under my palm steadying me from curling up in a ball - and I cried. Wishing for an answer, wishing for sobriety, wishing Layla would feel my pain and find a way to forgive me. I wondered if she was hurting the same way as me. At one point, I would have said yes, but I couldn\u2019t imagine being able to ignore her if I ever saw her going through the amount of aching need I felt. She had held back from telling me how she felt about me, and as I sat outside the locked door of her home, I began to convince myself that maybe she had never really loved me like I did her. <br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"2480\" data-orig-height=\"520\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd9598297e184ee2ddcef4b6406d2bb2/tumblr_inline_pj48z10Mkw1w7xqut_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2480\" data-orig-height=\"520\"/></figure><p><b>Terry</b></p><p>It was already late when Layla\u2019s call came through. I\u2019d had a quiet Friday night at home with Will, and he was fast asleep with his head on my lap, snoring away happily as I ran my fingers through his sandy blonde hair. Staying home, cooking together, and being domestic was still a luxury - something we hadn\u2019t yet grown to take advantage of - so even just the sight of his sleeping face made my heart skip a beat in a way that still took me by surprise.</p><p>He stirred as my phone rang, forehead scrunching together as he looked up at me. Initially, I was going to ignore the call, annoyed I had forgotten to switch it off for the night, but seeing Layla\u2019s name, I remembered why I hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cLil? You okay?\u201d</p><p>Will was fully awake then, his head popping up with confusion and concern on his face at the sound of his wife\u2019s name. I wished Layla could see him, see the amount of guilt and remorse he felt over what he had done to her. I\u2019d seen him battle with it during the majority of our relationship but never to the extent he had since he\u2019d punched Harry, effectively ruining Layla\u2019s already fragile relationship with the guy. Will had been the catalyst to the enormous breakdown she was experiencing, and I wished she could see that he was desperate to do anything to fix what he\u2019d broken.</p><p>On the other end of the phone, Layla was frantic. She wasn\u2019t crying but she was close, and I could hear the panic and fear in her voice as she struggled once more with how to handle the man she loved being so open and unrelenting with his refusal to accept that they were over.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Harry,\u201d she said, \u201che\u2019s here again, and I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m sorry to call you so late-\u201d</p><p>\u201cLayla, it\u2019s fine, I told you to call me if he turned up again.\u201d Will moved so I could get to my feet. I stroked his warm cheek before going out into the hallway. I hated seeing him so worried, and I hated hearing her so broken. \u201cI\u2019ll come over now and take him home. Is he drunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes&hellip; yes, I think so. Oh god, Ted, he sounds so\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m so awful, Terry, I\u2019m so selfish and horrible. I deserve all of this, but he doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She began to cry, a sound I had become heartbreakingly familiar with, and I stopped my rushing to get ready so I could comfort her. Using the same Welsh term of endearment my mother used to use for me when I was upset as a child, the word for love, I said softly, \u201cCariad, you\u2019re none of those things, and you certainly don\u2019t deserve any of this. You\u2019re not a bad person for wanting better than what Harry was giving, I\u2019ve told you this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019ve got it wrong? What if I\u2019ve made a mistake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ve made a mistake? Deep down, would you be happier going back to how things were? If you change your mind, I\u2019m not going to tell you you\u2019re right or wrong, I am just asking you what would make you happier in the long run, and not just as a quick fix.\u201d</p><p>Layla paused, her sobs becoming quiet sniffs and hiccups. We\u2019d talked at great length over what she wanted, and why that hadn\u2019t involved Harry being in her life anymore. I wanted to remind her of those things, and why what she was feeling was because of hearing Harry\u2019s grief.</p><p>Finally, and as I\u2019d expected, she mumbled, \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t made a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I will be over as soon as I can. Sit tight, and don\u2019t answer the door until I get there. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise that this will all get better. I\u2019ll speak to Harry.\u201d</p><p>She was crying again as we both hung up, and I sighed heavily at Will who was hovering nearby in the doorway of the living room, looking concerned.</p><p>\u201cIs she okay?\u201d He asked.</p><p>I shook my head and sat down on the hallway chair to put on my shoes. Coming to stand in front of me, Will put a soothing hand on my head, a gesture that thanked me for looking after a woman we had both wronged.</p><p>&ldquo;I have no idea what state Harry&rsquo;s going to be in, so I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ll be back. Please don&rsquo;t wait up, love.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re going to say, but would you like me to come? Even if it&rsquo;s just\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>Will&rsquo;s thoughts tailed off as he remembered what we both knew. He would be no use to anyone there and only ran the risk of exasperating things. I knew he wanted to help, but Layla was still refusing to having anything to do with him, and I dreaded to think what Harry would do if he saw him.</p><p>I stood up and cupped his head in my hands before kissing his forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be fine, I&rsquo;ll take Harry home and then I&rsquo;ll be back. Maybe you could text Rose for me? Ask her to check on Lil if she can?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. I love you,&rdquo; Will said, stepping back and grabbing my coat from the rack and helping me into it.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, too.&rdquo;</p><p>I kissed him goodbye and left.</p><p style=\"\"><br/></p><p>When I&rsquo;d gone to check on Layla, the morning after Will had punched Harry, Will had been confused why I still cared about her enough to go and apologise on his behalf. He&rsquo;d told me that I no longer had to pretend to love or care about her, that she was his mess to fix. But I\u2019d made it clear that I loved Layla almost as much as I did Mia, that I had never lied when I said I thought of her as a daughter in every sense but blood and name. I went to check on her because I was ashamed of Will\u2019s behaviour, and something had told me that I should go and make sure she was okay.</p><p>I found Layla in a state of drunken hysteria that day she (eventually) opened the door to me, with a glass of vodka in hand, and she didn\u2019t slam the door in my face like she probably would have done on any other occasions. Instead, she just started to sob and leant against the wall, sliding down it until she was flat on her backside, adding a healthy mix of tears to her drink. I had never seen her so broken and unrestrained in her emotions. Even when she\u2019d found Will and I together, she had remained strong, refusing to let the bump in the road get to her, but there had been too many bumps, and Layla had finally reached her limit and blown.</p><p>Helping her up from the floor, I\u2019d taken her into the kitchen and sat her down so I could try to sober her up a little. I made her a strong tea, and when she had drunk half the mug and seemed to have calmed down a little, I finally asked, \u201cWhat happened, cariad? Where\u2019s Harry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone,\u201d she shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019re over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of Will?\u201d</p><p>Shrugging again, she then shook her head and looked at me with swollen, red eyes, \u201cNo, well, he didn\u2019t help. Or maybe he did, but I\u2019m loath to give him credit.\u201d</p><p>She started to cry again, but managed to pull back enough so she could continue to explain that she had kicked Harry out. She then told me all about her childhood, about her mother and sister. I had known that she had come from a difficult past, Will had told me, and then so did she when we grew closer. Verity had wanted to hire a personal investigator when the engagement was announced and she realised that Layla was going to be a part of the the family, but Will and his father convinced her not to. She eventually found out some of the details, but none of us knew to what extent Layla had been neglected, or how she had been found when her mother died.</p><p>I sat and listened while Layla spoke, her heart seemingly breaking more and more with every word, and I understood why she had finally fallen to pieces. She had been carrying a heavy load for so many years. With how Will and I had betrayed her, Harry\u2019s recent scandal, her argument with Rose, and Will punching Harry on top of all of that, it was no wonder she was in such a mess.</p><p>It became my priority then to look after her, to be the parent I\u2019d always claimed to be for her but had screwed up so colossally. I put her to bed with a sick bucket and a glass of water, and then I called Will to say I wasn\u2019t going to be at work, that he\u2019d have to take my meetings and handle my calls. I hadn\u2019t given him an answer when he asked what was wrong. I was so angry with him that I wanted to save it for when I saw him in person. Of all the things that came close to finishing us off, his behaviour to Layla that day, and the things it had resulted in, were at the top of the list. I never saw Will as perfect, I saw his faults clearly, I\u2019d always loved him despite them, but I came close to hating him for what he had done to her. I most certainly didn\u2019t like him.</p><p>I sat with Layla all night while she slept, scared that she\u2019d consumed so much alcohol that something terrible would happen to her. When she woke, I held her hair and stroked her back as she was sick into the blue plastic bucket, her hangover temporarily outweighing the pain she was going through. I then made her some toast, and we talked some more until she needed to sleep again. It was unspoken, but we left our fall out in the past for the moment. I had needed to look after her, and she deeply needed love and affection, so everything else fell by the wayside.</p><p style=\"\"><br/></p><p>There was no sign of Harry when I arrived at Layla&rsquo;s house. Her bedroom light was on and, other than the sound of my engine running, the whole street was silent and still, so I assumed he had already given up and gone home. Wanting to make sure she was okay before I went home, I got out of the car and crossed the road to her house. It wasn\u2019t until I reached the gate, and went to push it open, that I saw Harry slumped by the door, crying into the crook of his elbow and looking a little worse for wear.</p><p>He looked up when heard the squeaking of the gate opening, and though he had the decency to look somewhat ashamed, he didn&rsquo;t make any effort to move.</p><p>&ldquo;Did she call you?&rdquo; He demanded. &ldquo;Does she hate me that much that she had to call the man her husband was sleeping with to get rid of me?\u201d</p><p>&quot;Yes, she called me, she&rsquo;s worried about you.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry scoffed and rolled his eyes. I could smell the alcohol on him as I got closer, and I knew it was what was making him belligerent.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it\u2019s time you went home? Lil isn&rsquo;t going to open the door.&rdquo;</p><p>Sighing heavily, my shoulders dropped when he folded his arms across his chest like a stubborn toddler and refused to move. I pulled out a pack of cigarettes from my jeans pocket, and sat down on the step with my back to him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t smoke, do you?\u201d I asked, realising I should offer him one. He shook his head, and I smiled before lighting the one I&rsquo;d taken out for myself. \u201cGood lad. I keep telling Will I\u2019m going to give up, but it\u2019s really fucking hard when you\u2019ve been smoking as long as I have.\u201d</p><p>Blowing out a puff of smoke into the night, I spoke again with a much heavier tone, one that was considerably less conversational, \u201cYou know you have to leave her alone, don\u2019t you, Harry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut-&ldquo;</p><p>I turned to look at him, and he clamped his mouth shut, knowing that arguing with me wasn&rsquo;t going to work.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being serious. This is becoming too much for her to deal with, and I\u2019ve known that girl long enough to know that the more you push, the less likely she is to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>He ran his fingers through his hair and wiped the tears from his face with his sleeve. Sniffing, he decided to change tactic and tried to reason with me. \u201cCan\u2019t you get her to open the door? I don\u2019t want to keep doing this but I-I don\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d Voice faltering, a fresh wave of tears slid down his cheeks. \u201cI love her, Terry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and she knows too. But it\u2019s over, and you have to accept that.\u201d I took one final drag before stubbing the embers out on the wall. \u201cHarry, Layla is hurting. She\u2019s really, really hurting, and not just from what you did, but from finally dealing with how she grew up, from what Will and I did, and facing the unknown of her new life alone. I know you want to speak to her, that you\u2019re hurting too, but if you really do love her, you need to back off and accept that this is what she wants. I know it doesn\u2019t feel like it, but she wants the best for you, too.\u201d</p><p>Harry turned his head to look up at Layla\u2019s door, and I hoped my words were managing to work their way through the drink and starting to get through to him that enough was enough. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you think she\u2019ll ever forgive me?\u201d He finally muttered, stroking a silver-ringed finger over a solidified drip of red paint on the door Layla had painted. \u201cYou know her so well, do you think she\u2019ll hate me forever?\u201d</p><p>With an involuntary groan, I got to my feet and looked up at the house. Layla was at the window, but I gave no indication that I could see her in case it riled Harry up again. She mouthed an emphatic thank you, then disappeared from view, no doubt to wait anxiously for us to leave.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what answer to give Harry, I didn\u2019t want to give him any false hope that meant he would continue showing up on her doorstep, but I also didn\u2019t want to kick him while he was down. Everything was so delicate, and I felt for both of them, but Layla was my priority, and I had to be honest enough with Harry that he would stop harassing her.</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d I eventually said, my gaze dropping from Layla\u2019s to meet his, \u201cLayla doesn\u2019t hate you, she just hates what you did. As for forgiving you? It\u2019s a clich\u00e9, I know, but she needs to forgive herself first. You\u2019re just one complication that she really doesn\u2019t need right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor her sister? Forgive herself, I mean.\u201d Harry asked as though finally realising for the first time that he was just one part in the puzzle of Layla\u2019s life. Her sister was the missing piece, and she blamed herself for it being lost. She\u2019d tried filling the hole with Harry\u2019s love, but she was coming to terms with the fact that he was just a distraction, no matter how much she loved him. \u201cWill you tell her that I\u2019m sorry, that I\u2019ll never regret anything more than hurting her?\u201d</p><p>Nodding, I extended my hand to help him up from the floor, and he reluctantly accepted it. He dusted himself off before pressing his palm to the door one last time, probably soaking up the last time he\u2019d ever be in front of her home. Sadly, he looked at me, eyes brimming with more tears, and I found myself wishing there could be a way for them to make things work. I recognised that the love he had for her was the same as Will had for me - he obviously felt it deeply but the timing was wrong and everyone had told him he was wrong. I could only hope that Harry and Layla could one day find an equal kind of love with someone else, or find their chance together at another time, like Will and I had.</p><p>\u201cTell her I\u2019ll leave her alone,\u201d Harry said, turning away from the door. \u201cIf it\u2019s what she wants, I won\u2019t bother her anymore.\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2480\" data-orig-height=\"520\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e841586a479005e79589123ddc55960b/tumblr_inline_pj490pMXkh1w7xqut_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2480\" data-orig-height=\"520\"/></figure><p><b>Harry</b></p><p>As Terry led me to his car to drive me home, I turned to give one last look at Layla\u2019s house. She was stood in the upstairs window, arms folded across her chest with a hand over her mouth. I couldn\u2019t really see clearly enough, but it looked to me like she was crying. Everything in me wanted to start shouting and begging for her to come down and talk to me, but I stopped myself. Instead, I turned away and got into the car, accepting that it was finally time to leave her alone.</p><p>I missed her, I missed seeing her name appearing on the screen of my phone when she\u2019d call or send me something silly that had amused her. I missed her voice, the sound of her laughter, her sense of humour, and I missed the way she tasted on my tongue. I knew Terry was right. I had to stop what I was doing, it wasn\u2019t helping me, and it wasn\u2019t helping her. Layla had no interest in what I had to say to her, and all I was doing was making her hate me more than she probably already did.</p><p>I was determined that I would respect Layla\u2019s wishes and leave her alone. I&rsquo;d give her the space she needed, but I knew that she was always going to be on my mind. I\u2019d fucked it up, I\u2019d ruined what we had, and I was going to spend a long time hating myself for it. Driving away from her home, I knew full well I\u2019d never be able to escape my love for Layla - the woman who changed me.</p>",

That had become the first thing I felt when I woke up. For the first few days, it had taken a few seconds before reality would kick in. I\u2019d think everything was okay, and that Layla didn\u2019t hate me, but that hadn\u2019t lasted for very long. Quickly, self-loathing was there before I\u2019d even fully woken up. I\u2019d keep my eyes closed tight and hope that I could fall back to sleep before my brain started its daily routine of telling me what a fucking idiot I was. From the moment I was no longer deep in sleep, I regretted everything.</p><p>The second thing I usually felt was a toss-up between a headache or the need to vomit, and this morning, after a particularly heavy night, it was both.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Careful not to wake the sleeping body next to me, I got out of bed and stumbled to the bathroom. I managed to lock the door before having to launch myself at the toilet and spewing the contents of my stomach into it. With my hands on either side of the seat, steadying me as my upper-body lurched and convulsed with every stomach contraction, I threw everything up until there was nothing but bile. My head throbbed twice as hard as it had done before, feeling as though I was being repeatedly kicked in the temple, and as I collapsed into a sitting position on the cool, tiled floor, I thought that having my innards try to escape my body through my mouth was still preferable to the ache of missing Layla.</p><p>I sat in a daze, staring at the marble pattern on the tiles, and building up the energy to get up and take something to ease the pounding pain in my head. I hoped the noise I\u2019d probably made hadn\u2019t woken up the girl in my bed, the same girl I\u2019d told Layla I would never see again, if she didn\u2019t want me to. I hadn\u2019t intended to have sex with her, she was just one of the few people who knew about Layla, and one of the only ones who was sympathetic and understanding. I\u2019d left London after finally accepting that I couldn\u2019t stay there, and I wanted comfort from someone who didn\u2019t think Layla was a terrible person, someone who\u2019d even encouraged me to try and make things right, even though I\u2019d lied to her too. I needed a shoulder to cry on, and we ended up in bed together.</p><p>Cringing, I realised that her possibly hearing me being sick was the least of my problems, and it made me clamber to my feet. Shuffling over to the sink, I glanced at the dishevelled reflection in the medicine cabinet and groaned with disgust. Somehow, I managed to look worse than I felt. I yanked the cabinet door open and took out some painkillers - wincing at the sound of the plastic as it crinkled in my fingers noisily - and popped out two pills. Then, cramming them into my mouth, I drank from the cold water tap to help swallow them down, whilst also ridding myself of the horrible taste of vomit in my mouth.</p><p>I considered just climbing back into bed, pulling the covers over my head and just sleeping my hangover away. But, remembering that I wouldn\u2019t be alone if I left the bathroom, I decided to shower, and hoped that the water washed away the previous night\u2019s mistakes, and all my other ones along with it. <br></p><p>It had been well over a month since Layla kicked me out of her house, and despite all the ways I\u2019d tried to distract myself, still nothing had eased the pain. I felt shattered and broken, my stomach was pained with an emptiness that I couldn\u2019t fill, and I couldn\u2019t focus on anything. For the first time in my life, I truly understood the meaning of heartache because I felt it all of the time.</p><p>I got straight out of London. I left Layla\u2019s house and drove straight up to Holmes-Chapel, to my mum\u2019s. I needed the comfort of her and Robin, and I wanted to lick my wounds in a place that was familiar and safe.</p><p>Mum was surprisingly supportive - not that I expected her to really show how happy she felt that my relationship with Lil was over - but I knew that deep down she was pleased and relieved. It had worried her- the age difference, the messy divorce- and both her and Gemma hadn\u2019t met Layla in particularly great situations. Hindsight told me that I\u2019d let my excitement for them to meet her get the better of me, and it made them dislike our relationship even more.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s over?\u201d Mum asked as we sat together on the sofa and I told her everything. \u00a0\u201cYou thought it was finished before and you still ended up back together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I shook my head and looked down at the sleeping cat on my knee, who was stretched out comfortably, without a single care in the world. I envied her. \u201cI think it\u2019s for real this time, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything I can do to fix what I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you have to accept her decision and try to move on, love. Sometimes, even though we want it so badly, some things just aren\u2019t meant to be. You and Layla just aren\u2019t right for each other, and one day, when you\u2019ve found someone who is right for you, you will see that.\u201d Mum put an arm around my shoulder and kissed my temple tenderly. \u201cIf you can\u2019t fix it, then leave her alone.\u201d</p><p>But, despite knowing I should follow her advice, I couldn\u2019t stop trying to fight Layla\u2019s decision. I\u2019d call and text constantly, begging to be heard and to be given an opportunity to make things better, but I never got anything back. All I got in return was a taste of my own medicine when she was forced to block any way I had of contacting her. But, when I travelled back to London with hopes of drowning my sorrows with friends over the new year, I took to showing up on her doorstep late at night instead of taking the rather obvious hint that she didn\u2019t want anything to do with me.</p><p>Usually drunk, I\u2019d kneel down in front of her door and plead through the letterbox to a wall of dark silence. Layla, of course, never responded. She never told me to leave or threaten to call the police, she just sat at the top of the stairs -cold and unmoving- and listened to my drunken pleas for her to reconsider until I gave up and went home. I couldn\u2019t ever really see her, save from the odd shadowy figure creeping across the hallway, but with that, and all the lights being turned off suddenly, I knew she was listening. And it only frustrated me more. I\u2019d want to bang my fists on the door, to stand in the middle of the street and shout and cause a scene. I wanted to do whatever it took until she let me in. But, even in inebriation, I was aware that it would only make everything worse for both of us. I felt incapable of leaving her alone but I wanted to at least spare her the embarrassment of the police being called, or worse, the press. \u00a0</p><p>Eventually, I would leave. I\u2019d call for a car and I\u2019d head home, or to a friend\u2019s house, where I would pass out. Then, the next morning, I\u2019d wake up and feel a wave of shame crash over me, the morning\u2019s harsh light seeming to make the regret that much more worse as I laid in bed, or on a sofa, and recalled what a mess I kept making of things. I\u2019d tell myself I was an idiot, and I\u2019d vow never to do it again, that this would be the last time. But it never was. Whether it was a day or two later, I\u2019d end up back in front of Lil\u2019s door.</p><p>The night that resulted in me running to LA had started well. I agreed to go out with Nick, and a few other people I knew through him, to belatedly celebrate New Year. He seemed to be aware that I was upset about something (thanks to my mum, no doubt) and he tried to subtly ask what was going on. But, sensing my reluctance to open up about it, he didn\u2019t push any further and just did his best to distract and cheer me up.</p><p>At first, it worked. For the first time in weeks, I found myself genuinely laughing, actually having fun instead of just pretending for the benefit of those around me, and noticing the knot in the pit of my stomach a little less. But the later it got, and the drunker everyone around me became, the more my mood started to drop. I found myself looking around at my friends and wishing I was somewhere else - like the age old cliche - because for all the people in the room, I felt utterly alone.</p><p>So, I left. I made my excuses, jumped in a cab and gave the driver Layla\u2019s address.</p><p>Having passed out almost as soon as the car started moving, I woke up when I realised it had come to a stop outside of Layla\u2019s house. Blearily handing money over, I stumbled out onto the pavement and waited for the taxi to drive off.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t anyone around, the street was quiet, and most of the other houses were in complete darkness apart from the occasional blue glow of a TV flickering in a dimly lit room. Curtains closed, I could see Layla\u2019s bedroom light was on. I grabbed at my stomach as it lurched. It was both comforting to know she was close and agonising knowing that it was highly unlikely she\u2019d acknowledge me. Ignoring the voice in my head telling me I should just go home, I opened the black, metal gate, walked up the tiled path, and rang the doorbell, starting the whole charade once again.</p><p>Ringing the bell a few more times, I peered through the mottled glass and was surprised to see a perfectly clear outline of Layla standing at the top of the stairs. She hadn\u2019t turned all the lights off, and wasn\u2019t pretending that she wasn\u2019t there but, to my dismay, she wasn\u2019t moving either. Crouching down, I opened the letterbox to try see her better, but all I saw was her sitting down in the usual spot.</p><p>Encouraged by her not hiding away, I asked, \u201cLil, please open the door.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to fight, I just want to talk.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cI hate doing this, but baby,\u201d I paused, emotion taking over and my voice cracking, \u201cBaby, I miss you.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Her silhouette made the silence worse, confronting me with the truth that all the times I\u2019d sat crying and begging for audience, she had been able to listen to me, unmoved. I\u2019d always known she was there, but now there was no denying that Layla had heard me and had been able to resist coming to comfort me.</p><p>Resting my head against the red painted door, I started to cry. The frustration of being ignored was overwhelming. I didn\u2019t know what else I could say or do to get her to listen to me. I knew I\u2019d fucked up, and it had haunted me since I saw the look of pain in Layla\u2019s eyes when I\u2019d admitted I\u2019d cheated on her. But I never expected to feel like she hated me, as though I meant nothing, as though we meant nothing. I took a deep breath and tried again, once again ignoring everything in me that told me to just to leave her alone.</p><p>\u201cLayla, Lil, please, can we just talk? I promise, I will leave you alone, but I just want to speak to you.\u201d</p><p>Again - nothing but an agonising wall of silence.</p><p>I watched her silhouette slowly get up, and for a split second I hoped she was about to finally relent, but when the lights went out and everything turned dark again, she shut me out once more.</p><p>My heart broke with a fresh, painful wound. I slumped down heavily onto my backside and leant against the brick wall. I knew I should give up, that I should just get up and go home to save more pain and embarrassment. Layla wasn\u2019t going to let me in, that was clearer to me now more than ever, but I couldn\u2019t move. Frustration was now overruled by defeat, and though I\u2019d gone through the same feeling several times before in the very same spot, it was finally setting in that even if I turned up on her doorstep every night - she was never, ever going to let me in.</p><p>With my head in the crook of my elbow, I sobbed. I sat in the covered doorway - the rough \u2018Welcome\u2019 mat under my palm steadying me from curling up in a ball - and I cried. Wishing for an answer, wishing for sobriety, wishing Layla would feel my pain and find a way to forgive me. I wondered if she was hurting the same way as me. At one point, I would have said yes, but I couldn\u2019t imagine being able to ignore her if I ever saw her going through the amount of aching need I felt. She had held back from telling me how she felt about me, and as I sat outside the locked door of her home, I began to convince myself that maybe she had never really loved me like I did her. <br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"2480\" data-orig-height=\"520\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd9598297e184ee2ddcef4b6406d2bb2/tumblr_inline_pj48z10Mkw1w7xqut_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2480\" data-orig-height=\"520\"></figure><p><b>Terry</b></p><p>It was already late when Layla\u2019s call came through. I\u2019d had a quiet Friday night at home with Will, and he was fast asleep with his head on my lap, snoring away happily as I ran my fingers through his sandy blonde hair. Staying home, cooking together, and being domestic was still a luxury - something we hadn\u2019t yet grown to take advantage of - so even just the sight of his sleeping face made my heart skip a beat in a way that still took me by surprise.</p><p>He stirred as my phone rang, forehead scrunching together as he looked up at me. Initially, I was going to ignore the call, annoyed I had forgotten to switch it off for the night, but seeing Layla\u2019s name, I remembered why I hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cLil? You okay?\u201d</p><p>Will was fully awake then, his head popping up with confusion and concern on his face at the sound of his wife\u2019s name. I wished Layla could see him, see the amount of guilt and remorse he felt over what he had done to her. I\u2019d seen him battle with it during the majority of our relationship but never to the extent he had since he\u2019d punched Harry, effectively ruining Layla\u2019s already fragile relationship with the guy. Will had been the catalyst to the enormous breakdown she was experiencing, and I wished she could see that he was desperate to do anything to fix what he\u2019d broken.</p><p>On the other end of the phone, Layla was frantic. She wasn\u2019t crying but she was close, and I could hear the panic and fear in her voice as she struggled once more with how to handle the man she loved being so open and unrelenting with his refusal to accept that they were over.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Harry,\u201d she said, \u201che\u2019s here again, and I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m sorry to call you so late-\u201d</p><p>\u201cLayla, it\u2019s fine, I told you to call me if he turned up again.\u201d Will moved so I could get to my feet. I stroked his warm cheek before going out into the hallway. I hated seeing him so worried, and I hated hearing her so broken. \u201cI\u2019ll come over now and take him home. Is he drunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2026 yes, I think so. Oh god, Ted, he sounds so\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m so awful, Terry, I\u2019m so selfish and horrible. I deserve all of this, but he doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She began to cry, a sound I had become heartbreakingly familiar with, and I stopped my rushing to get ready so I could comfort her. Using the same Welsh term of endearment my mother used to use for me when I was upset as a child, the word for love, I said softly, \u201cCariad, you\u2019re none of those things, and you certainly don\u2019t deserve any of this. You\u2019re not a bad person for wanting better than what Harry was giving, I\u2019ve told you this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019ve got it wrong? What if I\u2019ve made a mistake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ve made a mistake? Deep down, would you be happier going back to how things were? If you change your mind, I\u2019m not going to tell you you\u2019re right or wrong, I am just asking you what would make you happier in the long run, and not just as a quick fix.\u201d</p><p>Layla paused, her sobs becoming quiet sniffs and hiccups. We\u2019d talked at great length over what she wanted, and why that hadn\u2019t involved Harry being in her life anymore. I wanted to remind her of those things, and why what she was feeling was because of hearing Harry\u2019s grief.</p><p>Finally, and as I\u2019d expected, she mumbled, \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t made a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I will be over as soon as I can. Sit tight, and don\u2019t answer the door until I get there. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise that this will all get better. I\u2019ll speak to Harry.\u201d</p><p>She was crying again as we both hung up, and I sighed heavily at Will who was hovering nearby in the doorway of the living room, looking concerned.</p><p>\u201cIs she okay?\u201d He asked.</p><p>I shook my head and sat down on the hallway chair to put on my shoes. Coming to stand in front of me, Will put a soothing hand on my head, a gesture that thanked me for looking after a woman we had both wronged.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what state Harry\u2019s going to be in, so I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be back. Please don\u2019t wait up, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re going to say, but would you like me to come? Even if it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s thoughts tailed off as he remembered what we both knew. He would be no use to anyone there and only ran the risk of exasperating things. I knew he wanted to help, but Layla was still refusing to having anything to do with him, and I dreaded to think what Harry would do if he saw him.</p><p>I stood up and cupped his head in my hands before kissing his forehead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, I\u2019ll take Harry home and then I\u2019ll be back. Maybe you could text Rose for me? Ask her to check on Lil if she can?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. I love you,\u201d Will said, stepping back and grabbing my coat from the rack and helping me into it.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>I kissed him goodbye and left.</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>When I\u2019d gone to check on Layla, the morning after Will had punched Harry, Will had been confused why I still cared about her enough to go and apologise on his behalf. He\u2019d told me that I no longer had to pretend to love or care about her, that she was his mess to fix. But I\u2019d made it clear that I loved Layla almost as much as I did Mia, that I had never lied when I said I thought of her as a daughter in every sense but blood and name. I went to check on her because I was ashamed of Will\u2019s behaviour, and something had told me that I should go and make sure she was okay.</p><p>I found Layla in a state of drunken hysteria that day she (eventually) opened the door to me, with a glass of vodka in hand, and she didn\u2019t slam the door in my face like she probably would have done on any other occasions. Instead, she just started to sob and leant against the wall, sliding down it until she was flat on her backside, adding a healthy mix of tears to her drink. I had never seen her so broken and unrestrained in her emotions. Even when she\u2019d found Will and I together, she had remained strong, refusing to let the bump in the road get to her, but there had been too many bumps, and Layla had finally reached her limit and blown.</p><p>Helping her up from the floor, I\u2019d taken her into the kitchen and sat her down so I could try to sober her up a little. I made her a strong tea, and when she had drunk half the mug and seemed to have calmed down a little, I finally asked, \u201cWhat happened, cariad? Where\u2019s Harry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone,\u201d she shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019re over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of Will?\u201d</p><p>Shrugging again, she then shook her head and looked at me with swollen, red eyes, \u201cNo, well, he didn\u2019t help. Or maybe he did, but I\u2019m loath to give him credit.\u201d</p><p>She started to cry again, but managed to pull back enough so she could continue to explain that she had kicked Harry out. She then told me all about her childhood, about her mother and sister. I had known that she had come from a difficult past, Will had told me, and then so did she when we grew closer. Verity had wanted to hire a personal investigator when the engagement was announced and she realised that Layla was going to be a part of the the family, but Will and his father convinced her not to. She eventually found out some of the details, but none of us knew to what extent Layla had been neglected, or how she had been found when her mother died.</p><p>I sat and listened while Layla spoke, her heart seemingly breaking more and more with every word, and I understood why she had finally fallen to pieces. She had been carrying a heavy load for so many years. With how Will and I had betrayed her, Harry\u2019s recent scandal, her argument with Rose, and Will punching Harry on top of all of that, it was no wonder she was in such a mess.</p><p>It became my priority then to look after her, to be the parent I\u2019d always claimed to be for her but had screwed up so colossally. I put her to bed with a sick bucket and a glass of water, and then I called Will to say I wasn\u2019t going to be at work, that he\u2019d have to take my meetings and handle my calls. I hadn\u2019t given him an answer when he asked what was wrong. I was so angry with him that I wanted to save it for when I saw him in person. Of all the things that came close to finishing us off, his behaviour to Layla that day, and the things it had resulted in, were at the top of the list. I never saw Will as perfect, I saw his faults clearly, I\u2019d always loved him despite them, but I came close to hating him for what he had done to her. I most certainly didn\u2019t like him.</p><p>I sat with Layla all night while she slept, scared that she\u2019d consumed so much alcohol that something terrible would happen to her. When she woke, I held her hair and stroked her back as she was sick into the blue plastic bucket, her hangover temporarily outweighing the pain she was going through. I then made her some toast, and we talked some more until she needed to sleep again. It was unspoken, but we left our fall out in the past for the moment. I had needed to look after her, and she deeply needed love and affection, so everything else fell by the wayside.</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>There was no sign of Harry when I arrived at Layla\u2019s house. Her bedroom light was on and, other than the sound of my engine running, the whole street was silent and still, so I assumed he had already given up and gone home. Wanting to make sure she was okay before I went home, I got out of the car and crossed the road to her house. It wasn\u2019t until I reached the gate, and went to push it open, that I saw Harry slumped by the door, crying into the crook of his elbow and looking a little worse for wear.</p><p>He looked up when heard the squeaking of the gate opening, and though he had the decency to look somewhat ashamed, he didn\u2019t make any effort to move.</p><p>\u201cDid she call you?\u201d He demanded. \u201cDoes she hate me that much that she had to call the man her husband was sleeping with to get rid of me?\u201d</p><p>\"Yes, she called me, she\u2019s worried about you.\u201d</p><p>Harry scoffed and rolled his eyes. I could smell the alcohol on him as I got closer, and I knew it was what was making him belligerent.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s time you went home? Lil isn\u2019t going to open the door.\u201d</p><p>Sighing heavily, my shoulders dropped when he folded his arms across his chest like a stubborn toddler and refused to move. I pulled out a pack of cigarettes from my jeans pocket, and sat down on the step with my back to him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t smoke, do you?\u201d I asked, realising I should offer him one. He shook his head, and I smiled before lighting the one I\u2019d taken out for myself. \u201cGood lad. I keep telling Will I\u2019m going to give up, but it\u2019s really fucking hard when you\u2019ve been smoking as long as I have.\u201d</p><p>Blowing out a puff of smoke into the night, I spoke again with a much heavier tone, one that was considerably less conversational, \u201cYou know you have to leave her alone, don\u2019t you, Harry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut-\u201c</p><p>I turned to look at him, and he clamped his mouth shut, knowing that arguing with me wasn\u2019t going to work.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being serious. This is becoming too much for her to deal with, and I\u2019ve known that girl long enough to know that the more you push, the less likely she is to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>He ran his fingers through his hair and wiped the tears from his face with his sleeve. Sniffing, he decided to change tactic and tried to reason with me. \u201cCan\u2019t you get her to open the door? I don\u2019t want to keep doing this but I-I don\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d Voice faltering, a fresh wave of tears slid down his cheeks. \u201cI love her, Terry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and she knows too. But it\u2019s over, and you have to accept that.\u201d I took one final drag before stubbing the embers out on the wall. \u201cHarry, Layla is hurting. She\u2019s really, really hurting, and not just from what you did, but from finally dealing with how she grew up, from what Will and I did, and facing the unknown of her new life alone. I know you want to speak to her, that you\u2019re hurting too, but if you really do love her, you need to back off and accept that this is what she wants. I know it doesn\u2019t feel like it, but she wants the best for you, too.\u201d</p><p>Harry turned his head to look up at Layla\u2019s door, and I hoped my words were managing to work their way through the drink and starting to get through to him that enough was enough. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you think she\u2019ll ever forgive me?\u201d He finally muttered, stroking a silver-ringed finger over a solidified drip of red paint on the door Layla had painted. \u201cYou know her so well, do you think she\u2019ll hate me forever?\u201d</p><p>With an involuntary groan, I got to my feet and looked up at the house. Layla was at the window, but I gave no indication that I could see her in case it riled Harry up again. She mouthed an emphatic thank you, then disappeared from view, no doubt to wait anxiously for us to leave.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what answer to give Harry, I didn\u2019t want to give him any false hope that meant he would continue showing up on her doorstep, but I also didn\u2019t want to kick him while he was down. Everything was so delicate, and I felt for both of them, but Layla was my priority, and I had to be honest enough with Harry that he would stop harassing her.</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d I eventually said, my gaze dropping from Layla\u2019s to meet his, \u201cLayla doesn\u2019t hate you, she just hates what you did. As for forgiving you? It\u2019s a clich\u00e9, I know, but she needs to forgive herself first. You\u2019re just one complication that she really doesn\u2019t need right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor her sister? Forgive herself, I mean.\u201d Harry asked as though finally realising for the first time that he was just one part in the puzzle of Layla\u2019s life. Her sister was the missing piece, and she blamed herself for it being lost. She\u2019d tried filling the hole with Harry\u2019s love, but she was coming to terms with the fact that he was just a distraction, no matter how much she loved him. \u201cWill you tell her that I\u2019m sorry, that I\u2019ll never regret anything more than hurting her?\u201d</p><p>Nodding, I extended my hand to help him up from the floor, and he reluctantly accepted it. He dusted himself off before pressing his palm to the door one last time, probably soaking up the last time he\u2019d ever be in front of her home. Sadly, he looked at me, eyes brimming with more tears, and I found myself wishing there could be a way for them to make things work. I recognised that the love he had for her was the same as Will had for me - he obviously felt it deeply but the timing was wrong and everyone had told him he was wrong. I could only hope that Harry and Layla could one day find an equal kind of love with someone else, or find their chance together at another time, like Will and I had.</p><p>\u201cTell her I\u2019ll leave her alone,\u201d Harry said, turning away from the door. \u201cIf it\u2019s what she wants, I won\u2019t bother her anymore.\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2480\" data-orig-height=\"520\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e841586a479005e79589123ddc55960b/tumblr_inline_pj490pMXkh1w7xqut_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2480\" data-orig-height=\"520\"></figure><p><b>Harry</b></p><p>As Terry led me to his car to drive me home, I turned to give one last look at Layla\u2019s house. She was stood in the upstairs window, arms folded across her chest with a hand over her mouth. I couldn\u2019t really see clearly enough, but it looked to me like she was crying. Everything in me wanted to start shouting and begging for her to come down and talk to me, but I stopped myself. Instead, I turned away and got into the car, accepting that it was finally time to leave her alone.</p><p>I missed her, I missed seeing her name appearing on the screen of my phone when she\u2019d call or send me something silly that had amused her. I missed her voice, the sound of her laughter, her sense of humour, and I missed the way she tasted on my tongue. I knew Terry was right. I had to stop what I was doing, it wasn\u2019t helping me, and it wasn\u2019t helping her. Layla had no interest in what I had to say to her, and all I was doing was making her hate me more than she probably already did.</p><p>I was determined that I would respect Layla\u2019s wishes and leave her alone. I\u2019d give her the space she needed, but I knew that she was always going to be on my mind. I\u2019d fucked it up, I\u2019d ruined what we had, and I was going to spend a long time hating myself for it. Driving away from her home, I knew full well I\u2019d never be able to escape my love for Layla - the woman who changed me.</p>",

That had become the first thing I felt when I woke up. For the first few days, it had taken a few seconds before reality would kick in. I\u2019d think everything was okay, and that Layla didn\u2019t hate me, but that hadn\u2019t lasted for very long. Quickly, self-loathing was there before I\u2019d even fully woken up. I\u2019d keep my eyes closed tight and hope that I could fall back to sleep before my brain started its daily routine of telling me what a fucking idiot I was. From the moment I was no longer deep in sleep, I regretted everything.</p><p>The second thing I usually felt was a toss-up between a headache or the need to vomit, and this morning, after a particularly heavy night, it was both.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Careful not to wake the sleeping body next to me, I got out of bed and stumbled to the bathroom. I managed to lock the door before having to launch myself at the toilet and spewing the contents of my stomach into it. With my hands on either side of the seat, steadying me as my upper-body lurched and convulsed with every stomach contraction, I threw everything up until there was nothing but bile. My head throbbed twice as hard as it had done before, feeling as though I was being repeatedly kicked in the temple, and as I collapsed into a sitting position on the cool, tiled floor, I thought that having my innards try to escape my body through my mouth was still preferable to the ache of missing Layla.</p><p>I sat in a daze, staring at the marble pattern on the tiles, and building up the energy to get up and take something to ease the pounding pain in my head. I hoped the noise I\u2019d probably made hadn\u2019t woken up the girl in my bed, the same girl I\u2019d told Layla I would never see again, if she didn\u2019t want me to. I hadn\u2019t intended to have sex with her, she was just one of the few people who knew about Layla, and one of the only ones who was sympathetic and understanding. I\u2019d left London after finally accepting that I couldn\u2019t stay there, and I wanted comfort from someone who didn\u2019t think Layla was a terrible person, someone who\u2019d even encouraged me to try and make things right, even though I\u2019d lied to her too. I needed a shoulder to cry on, and we ended up in bed together.</p><p>Cringing, I realised that her possibly hearing me being sick was the least of my problems, and it made me clamber to my feet. Shuffling over to the sink, I glanced at the dishevelled reflection in the medicine cabinet and groaned with disgust. Somehow, I managed to look worse than I felt. I yanked the cabinet door open and took out some painkillers - wincing at the sound of the plastic as it crinkled in my fingers noisily - and popped out two pills. Then, cramming them into my mouth, I drank from the cold water tap to help swallow them down, whilst also ridding myself of the horrible taste of vomit in my mouth.</p><p>I considered just climbing back into bed, pulling the covers over my head and just sleeping my hangover away. But, remembering that I wouldn\u2019t be alone if I left the bathroom, I decided to shower, and hoped that the water washed away the previous night\u2019s mistakes, and all my other ones along with it. <br></p><p>It had been well over a month since Layla kicked me out of her house, and despite all the ways I\u2019d tried to distract myself, still nothing had eased the pain. I felt shattered and broken, my stomach was pained with an emptiness that I couldn\u2019t fill, and I couldn\u2019t focus on anything. For the first time in my life, I truly understood the meaning of heartache because I felt it all of the time.</p><p>I got straight out of London. I left Layla\u2019s house and drove straight up to Holmes-Chapel, to my mum\u2019s. I needed the comfort of her and Robin, and I wanted to lick my wounds in a place that was familiar and safe.</p><p>Mum was surprisingly supportive - not that I expected her to really show how happy she felt that my relationship with Lil was over - but I knew that deep down she was pleased and relieved. It had worried her- the age difference, the messy divorce- and both her and Gemma hadn\u2019t met Layla in particularly great situations. Hindsight told me that I\u2019d let my excitement for them to meet her get the better of me, and it made them dislike our relationship even more.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s over?\u201d Mum asked as we sat together on the sofa and I told her everything. \u00a0\u201cYou thought it was finished before and you still ended up back together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I shook my head and looked down at the sleeping cat on my knee, who was stretched out comfortably, without a single care in the world. I envied her. \u201cI think it\u2019s for real this time, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything I can do to fix what I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you have to accept her decision and try to move on, love. Sometimes, even though we want it so badly, some things just aren\u2019t meant to be. You and Layla just aren\u2019t right for each other, and one day, when you\u2019ve found someone who is right for you, you will see that.\u201d Mum put an arm around my shoulder and kissed my temple tenderly. \u201cIf you can\u2019t fix it, then leave her alone.\u201d</p><p>But, despite knowing I should follow her advice, I couldn\u2019t stop trying to fight Layla\u2019s decision. I\u2019d call and text constantly, begging to be heard and to be given an opportunity to make things better, but I never got anything back. All I got in return was a taste of my own medicine when she was forced to block any way I had of contacting her. But, when I travelled back to London with hopes of drowning my sorrows with friends over the new year, I took to showing up on her doorstep late at night instead of taking the rather obvious hint that she didn\u2019t want anything to do with me.</p><p>Usually drunk, I\u2019d kneel down in front of her door and plead through the letterbox to a wall of dark silence. Layla, of course, never responded. She never told me to leave or threaten to call the police, she just sat at the top of the stairs -cold and unmoving- and listened to my drunken pleas for her to reconsider until I gave up and went home. I couldn\u2019t ever really see her, save from the odd shadowy figure creeping across the hallway, but with that, and all the lights being turned off suddenly, I knew she was listening. And it only frustrated me more. I\u2019d want to bang my fists on the door, to stand in the middle of the street and shout and cause a scene. I wanted to do whatever it took until she let me in. But, even in inebriation, I was aware that it would only make everything worse for both of us. I felt incapable of leaving her alone but I wanted to at least spare her the embarrassment of the police being called, or worse, the press. \u00a0</p><p>Eventually, I would leave. I\u2019d call for a car and I\u2019d head home, or to a friend\u2019s house, where I would pass out. Then, the next morning, I\u2019d wake up and feel a wave of shame crash over me, the morning\u2019s harsh light seeming to make the regret that much more worse as I laid in bed, or on a sofa, and recalled what a mess I kept making of things. I\u2019d tell myself I was an idiot, and I\u2019d vow never to do it again, that this would be the last time. But it never was. Whether it was a day or two later, I\u2019d end up back in front of Lil\u2019s door.</p><p>The night that resulted in me running to LA had started well. I agreed to go out with Nick, and a few other people I knew through him, to belatedly celebrate New Year. He seemed to be aware that I was upset about something (thanks to my mum, no doubt) and he tried to subtly ask what was going on. But, sensing my reluctance to open up about it, he didn\u2019t push any further and just did his best to distract and cheer me up.</p><p>At first, it worked. For the first time in weeks, I found myself genuinely laughing, actually having fun instead of just pretending for the benefit of those around me, and noticing the knot in the pit of my stomach a little less. But the later it got, and the drunker everyone around me became, the more my mood started to drop. I found myself looking around at my friends and wishing I was somewhere else - like the age old cliche - because for all the people in the room, I felt utterly alone.</p><p>So, I left. I made my excuses, jumped in a cab and gave the driver Layla\u2019s address.</p><p>Having passed out almost as soon as the car started moving, I woke up when I realised it had come to a stop outside of Layla\u2019s house. Blearily handing money over, I stumbled out onto the pavement and waited for the taxi to drive off.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t anyone around, the street was quiet, and most of the other houses were in complete darkness apart from the occasional blue glow of a TV flickering in a dimly lit room. Curtains closed, I could see Layla\u2019s bedroom light was on. I grabbed at my stomach as it lurched. It was both comforting to know she was close and agonising knowing that it was highly unlikely she\u2019d acknowledge me. Ignoring the voice in my head telling me I should just go home, I opened the black, metal gate, walked up the tiled path, and rang the doorbell, starting the whole charade once again.</p><p>Ringing the bell a few more times, I peered through the mottled glass and was surprised to see a perfectly clear outline of Layla standing at the top of the stairs. She hadn\u2019t turned all the lights off, and wasn\u2019t pretending that she wasn\u2019t there but, to my dismay, she wasn\u2019t moving either. Crouching down, I opened the letterbox to try see her better, but all I saw was her sitting down in the usual spot.</p><p>Encouraged by her not hiding away, I asked, \u201cLil, please open the door.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to fight, I just want to talk.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cI hate doing this, but baby,\u201d I paused, emotion taking over and my voice cracking, \u201cBaby, I miss you.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Her silhouette made the silence worse, confronting me with the truth that all the times I\u2019d sat crying and begging for audience, she had been able to listen to me, unmoved. I\u2019d always known she was there, but now there was no denying that Layla had heard me and had been able to resist coming to comfort me.</p><p>Resting my head against the red painted door, I started to cry. The frustration of being ignored was overwhelming. I didn\u2019t know what else I could say or do to get her to listen to me. I knew I\u2019d fucked up, and it had haunted me since I saw the look of pain in Layla\u2019s eyes when I\u2019d admitted I\u2019d cheated on her. But I never expected to feel like she hated me, as though I meant nothing, as though we meant nothing. I took a deep breath and tried again, once again ignoring everything in me that told me to just to leave her alone.</p><p>\u201cLayla, Lil, please, can we just talk? I promise, I will leave you alone, but I just want to speak to you.\u201d</p><p>Again - nothing but an agonising wall of silence.</p><p>I watched her silhouette slowly get up, and for a split second I hoped she was about to finally relent, but when the lights went out and everything turned dark again, she shut me out once more.</p><p>My heart broke with a fresh, painful wound. I slumped down heavily onto my backside and leant against the brick wall. I knew I should give up, that I should just get up and go home to save more pain and embarrassment. Layla wasn\u2019t going to let me in, that was clearer to me now more than ever, but I couldn\u2019t move. Frustration was now overruled by defeat, and though I\u2019d gone through the same feeling several times before in the very same spot, it was finally setting in that even if I turned up on her doorstep every night - she was never, ever going to let me in.</p><p>With my head in the crook of my elbow, I sobbed. I sat in the covered doorway - the rough \u2018Welcome\u2019 mat under my palm steadying me from curling up in a ball - and I cried. Wishing for an answer, wishing for sobriety, wishing Layla would feel my pain and find a way to forgive me. I wondered if she was hurting the same way as me. At one point, I would have said yes, but I couldn\u2019t imagine being able to ignore her if I ever saw her going through the amount of aching need I felt. She had held back from telling me how she felt about me, and as I sat outside the locked door of her home, I began to convince myself that maybe she had never really loved me like I did her. <br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"2480\" data-orig-height=\"520\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd9598297e184ee2ddcef4b6406d2bb2/tumblr_inline_pj48z10Mkw1w7xqut_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2480\" data-orig-height=\"520\"></figure><p><b>Terry</b></p><p>It was already late when Layla\u2019s call came through. I\u2019d had a quiet Friday night at home with Will, and he was fast asleep with his head on my lap, snoring away happily as I ran my fingers through his sandy blonde hair. Staying home, cooking together, and being domestic was still a luxury - something we hadn\u2019t yet grown to take advantage of - so even just the sight of his sleeping face made my heart skip a beat in a way that still took me by surprise.</p><p>He stirred as my phone rang, forehead scrunching together as he looked up at me. Initially, I was going to ignore the call, annoyed I had forgotten to switch it off for the night, but seeing Layla\u2019s name, I remembered why I hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cLil? You okay?\u201d</p><p>Will was fully awake then, his head popping up with confusion and concern on his face at the sound of his wife\u2019s name. I wished Layla could see him, see the amount of guilt and remorse he felt over what he had done to her. I\u2019d seen him battle with it during the majority of our relationship but never to the extent he had since he\u2019d punched Harry, effectively ruining Layla\u2019s already fragile relationship with the guy. Will had been the catalyst to the enormous breakdown she was experiencing, and I wished she could see that he was desperate to do anything to fix what he\u2019d broken.</p><p>On the other end of the phone, Layla was frantic. She wasn\u2019t crying but she was close, and I could hear the panic and fear in her voice as she struggled once more with how to handle the man she loved being so open and unrelenting with his refusal to accept that they were over.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Harry,\u201d she said, \u201che\u2019s here again, and I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m sorry to call you so late-\u201d</p><p>\u201cLayla, it\u2019s fine, I told you to call me if he turned up again.\u201d Will moved so I could get to my feet. I stroked his warm cheek before going out into the hallway. I hated seeing him so worried, and I hated hearing her so broken. \u201cI\u2019ll come over now and take him home. Is he drunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2026 yes, I think so. Oh god, Ted, he sounds so\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m so awful, Terry, I\u2019m so selfish and horrible. I deserve all of this, but he doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She began to cry, a sound I had become heartbreakingly familiar with, and I stopped my rushing to get ready so I could comfort her. Using the same Welsh term of endearment my mother used to use for me when I was upset as a child, the word for love, I said softly, \u201cCariad, you\u2019re none of those things, and you certainly don\u2019t deserve any of this. You\u2019re not a bad person for wanting better than what Harry was giving, I\u2019ve told you this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019ve got it wrong? What if I\u2019ve made a mistake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ve made a mistake? Deep down, would you be happier going back to how things were? If you change your mind, I\u2019m not going to tell you you\u2019re right or wrong, I am just asking you what would make you happier in the long run, and not just as a quick fix.\u201d</p><p>Layla paused, her sobs becoming quiet sniffs and hiccups. We\u2019d talked at great length over what she wanted, and why that hadn\u2019t involved Harry being in her life anymore. I wanted to remind her of those things, and why what she was feeling was because of hearing Harry\u2019s grief.</p><p>Finally, and as I\u2019d expected, she mumbled, \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t made a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I will be over as soon as I can. Sit tight, and don\u2019t answer the door until I get there. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise that this will all get better. I\u2019ll speak to Harry.\u201d</p><p>She was crying again as we both hung up, and I sighed heavily at Will who was hovering nearby in the doorway of the living room, looking concerned.</p><p>\u201cIs she okay?\u201d He asked.</p><p>I shook my head and sat down on the hallway chair to put on my shoes. Coming to stand in front of me, Will put a soothing hand on my head, a gesture that thanked me for looking after a woman we had both wronged.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what state Harry\u2019s going to be in, so I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be back. Please don\u2019t wait up, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re going to say, but would you like me to come? Even if it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s thoughts tailed off as he remembered what we both knew. He would be no use to anyone there and only ran the risk of exasperating things. I knew he wanted to help, but Layla was still refusing to having anything to do with him, and I dreaded to think what Harry would do if he saw him.</p><p>I stood up and cupped his head in my hands before kissing his forehead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, I\u2019ll take Harry home and then I\u2019ll be back. Maybe you could text Rose for me? Ask her to check on Lil if she can?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. I love you,\u201d Will said, stepping back and grabbing my coat from the rack and helping me into it.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>I kissed him goodbye and left.</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>When I\u2019d gone to check on Layla, the morning after Will had punched Harry, Will had been confused why I still cared about her enough to go and apologise on his behalf. He\u2019d told me that I no longer had to pretend to love or care about her, that she was his mess to fix. But I\u2019d made it clear that I loved Layla almost as much as I did Mia, that I had never lied when I said I thought of her as a daughter in every sense but blood and name. I went to check on her because I was ashamed of Will\u2019s behaviour, and something had told me that I should go and make sure she was okay.</p><p>I found Layla in a state of drunken hysteria that day she (eventually) opened the door to me, with a glass of vodka in hand, and she didn\u2019t slam the door in my face like she probably would have done on any other occasions. Instead, she just started to sob and leant against the wall, sliding down it until she was flat on her backside, adding a healthy mix of tears to her drink. I had never seen her so broken and unrestrained in her emotions. Even when she\u2019d found Will and I together, she had remained strong, refusing to let the bump in the road get to her, but there had been too many bumps, and Layla had finally reached her limit and blown.</p><p>Helping her up from the floor, I\u2019d taken her into the kitchen and sat her down so I could try to sober her up a little. I made her a strong tea, and when she had drunk half the mug and seemed to have calmed down a little, I finally asked, \u201cWhat happened, cariad? Where\u2019s Harry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone,\u201d she shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019re over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of Will?\u201d</p><p>Shrugging again, she then shook her head and looked at me with swollen, red eyes, \u201cNo, well, he didn\u2019t help. Or maybe he did, but I\u2019m loath to give him credit.\u201d</p><p>She started to cry again, but managed to pull back enough so she could continue to explain that she had kicked Harry out. She then told me all about her childhood, about her mother and sister. I had known that she had come from a difficult past, Will had told me, and then so did she when we grew closer. Verity had wanted to hire a personal investigator when the engagement was announced and she realised that Layla was going to be a part of the the family, but Will and his father convinced her not to. She eventually found out some of the details, but none of us knew to what extent Layla had been neglected, or how she had been found when her mother died.</p><p>I sat and listened while Layla spoke, her heart seemingly breaking more and more with every word, and I understood why she had finally fallen to pieces. She had been carrying a heavy load for so many years. With how Will and I had betrayed her, Harry\u2019s recent scandal, her argument with Rose, and Will punching Harry on top of all of that, it was no wonder she was in such a mess.</p><p>It became my priority then to look after her, to be the parent I\u2019d always claimed to be for her but had screwed up so colossally. I put her to bed with a sick bucket and a glass of water, and then I called Will to say I wasn\u2019t going to be at work, that he\u2019d have to take my meetings and handle my calls. I hadn\u2019t given him an answer when he asked what was wrong. I was so angry with him that I wanted to save it for when I saw him in person. Of all the things that came close to finishing us off, his behaviour to Layla that day, and the things it had resulted in, were at the top of the list. I never saw Will as perfect, I saw his faults clearly, I\u2019d always loved him despite them, but I came close to hating him for what he had done to her. I most certainly didn\u2019t like him.</p><p>I sat with Layla all night while she slept, scared that she\u2019d consumed so much alcohol that something terrible would happen to her. When she woke, I held her hair and stroked her back as she was sick into the blue plastic bucket, her hangover temporarily outweighing the pain she was going through. I then made her some toast, and we talked some more until she needed to sleep again. It was unspoken, but we left our fall out in the past for the moment. I had needed to look after her, and she deeply needed love and affection, so everything else fell by the wayside.</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>There was no sign of Harry when I arrived at Layla\u2019s house. Her bedroom light was on and, other than the sound of my engine running, the whole street was silent and still, so I assumed he had already given up and gone home. Wanting to make sure she was okay before I went home, I got out of the car and crossed the road to her house. It wasn\u2019t until I reached the gate, and went to push it open, that I saw Harry slumped by the door, crying into the crook of his elbow and looking a little worse for wear.</p><p>He looked up when heard the squeaking of the gate opening, and though he had the decency to look somewhat ashamed, he didn\u2019t make any effort to move.</p><p>\u201cDid she call you?\u201d He demanded. \u201cDoes she hate me that much that she had to call the man her husband was sleeping with to get rid of me?\u201d</p><p>\"Yes, she called me, she\u2019s worried about you.\u201d</p><p>Harry scoffed and rolled his eyes. I could smell the alcohol on him as I got closer, and I knew it was what was making him belligerent.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s time you went home? Lil isn\u2019t going to open the door.\u201d</p><p>Sighing heavily, my shoulders dropped when he folded his arms across his chest like a stubborn toddler and refused to move. I pulled out a pack of cigarettes from my jeans pocket, and sat down on the step with my back to him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t smoke, do you?\u201d I asked, realising I should offer him one. He shook his head, and I smiled before lighting the one I\u2019d taken out for myself. \u201cGood lad. I keep telling Will I\u2019m going to give up, but it\u2019s really fucking hard when you\u2019ve been smoking as long as I have.\u201d</p><p>Blowing out a puff of smoke into the night, I spoke again with a much heavier tone, one that was considerably less conversational, \u201cYou know you have to leave her alone, don\u2019t you, Harry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut-\u201c</p><p>I turned to look at him, and he clamped his mouth shut, knowing that arguing with me wasn\u2019t going to work.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being serious. This is becoming too much for her to deal with, and I\u2019ve known that girl long enough to know that the more you push, the less likely she is to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>He ran his fingers through his hair and wiped the tears from his face with his sleeve. Sniffing, he decided to change tactic and tried to reason with me. \u201cCan\u2019t you get her to open the door? I don\u2019t want to keep doing this but I-I don\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d Voice faltering, a fresh wave of tears slid down his cheeks. \u201cI love her, Terry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and she knows too. But it\u2019s over, and you have to accept that.\u201d I took one final drag before stubbing the embers out on the wall. \u201cHarry, Layla is hurting. She\u2019s really, really hurting, and not just from what you did, but from finally dealing with how she grew up, from what Will and I did, and facing the unknown of her new life alone. I know you want to speak to her, that you\u2019re hurting too, but if you really do love her, you need to back off and accept that this is what she wants. I know it doesn\u2019t feel like it, but she wants the best for you, too.\u201d</p><p>Harry turned his head to look up at Layla\u2019s door, and I hoped my words were managing to work their way through the drink and starting to get through to him that enough was enough. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you think she\u2019ll ever forgive me?\u201d He finally muttered, stroking a silver-ringed finger over a solidified drip of red paint on the door Layla had painted. \u201cYou know her so well, do you think she\u2019ll hate me forever?\u201d</p><p>With an involuntary groan, I got to my feet and looked up at the house. Layla was at the window, but I gave no indication that I could see her in case it riled Harry up again. She mouthed an emphatic thank you, then disappeared from view, no doubt to wait anxiously for us to leave.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what answer to give Harry, I didn\u2019t want to give him any false hope that meant he would continue showing up on her doorstep, but I also didn\u2019t want to kick him while he was down. Everything was so delicate, and I felt for both of them, but Layla was my priority, and I had to be honest enough with Harry that he would stop harassing her.</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d I eventually said, my gaze dropping from Layla\u2019s to meet his, \u201cLayla doesn\u2019t hate you, she just hates what you did. As for forgiving you? It\u2019s a clich\u00e9, I know, but she needs to forgive herself first. You\u2019re just one complication that she really doesn\u2019t need right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor her sister? Forgive herself, I mean.\u201d Harry asked as though finally realising for the first time that he was just one part in the puzzle of Layla\u2019s life. Her sister was the missing piece, and she blamed herself for it being lost. She\u2019d tried filling the hole with Harry\u2019s love, but she was coming to terms with the fact that he was just a distraction, no matter how much she loved him. \u201cWill you tell her that I\u2019m sorry, that I\u2019ll never regret anything more than hurting her?\u201d</p><p>Nodding, I extended my hand to help him up from the floor, and he reluctantly accepted it. He dusted himself off before pressing his palm to the door one last time, probably soaking up the last time he\u2019d ever be in front of her home. Sadly, he looked at me, eyes brimming with more tears, and I found myself wishing there could be a way for them to make things work. I recognised that the love he had for her was the same as Will had for me - he obviously felt it deeply but the timing was wrong and everyone had told him he was wrong. I could only hope that Harry and Layla could one day find an equal kind of love with someone else, or find their chance together at another time, like Will and I had.</p><p>\u201cTell her I\u2019ll leave her alone,\u201d Harry said, turning away from the door. \u201cIf it\u2019s what she wants, I won\u2019t bother her anymore.\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2480\" data-orig-height=\"520\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e841586a479005e79589123ddc55960b/tumblr_inline_pj490pMXkh1w7xqut_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2480\" data-orig-height=\"520\"></figure><p><b>Harry</b></p><p>As Terry led me to his car to drive me home, I turned to give one last look at Layla\u2019s house. She was stood in the upstairs window, arms folded across her chest with a hand over her mouth. I couldn\u2019t really see clearly enough, but it looked to me like she was crying. Everything in me wanted to start shouting and begging for her to come down and talk to me, but I stopped myself. Instead, I turned away and got into the car, accepting that it was finally time to leave her alone.</p><p>I missed her, I missed seeing her name appearing on the screen of my phone when she\u2019d call or send me something silly that had amused her. I missed her voice, the sound of her laughter, her sense of humour, and I missed the way she tasted on my tongue. I knew Terry was right. I had to stop what I was doing, it wasn\u2019t helping me, and it wasn\u2019t helping her. Layla had no interest in what I had to say to her, and all I was doing was making her hate me more than she probably already did.</p><p>I was determined that I would respect Layla\u2019s wishes and leave her alone. I\u2019d give her the space she needed, but I knew that she was always going to be on my mind. I\u2019d fucked it up, I\u2019d ruined what we had, and I was going to spend a long time hating myself for it. Driving away from her home, I knew full well I\u2019d never be able to escape my love for Layla - the woman who changed me.</p>",

That had become the first thing I felt when I woke up. For the first few days, it had taken a few seconds before reality would kick in. I&rsquo;d think everything was okay, and that Layla didn&rsquo;t hate me, but that hadn&rsquo;t lasted for very long. Quickly, self-loathing was there before I&rsquo;d even fully woken up. I&rsquo;d keep my eyes closed tight and hope that I could fall back to sleep before my brain started its daily routine of telling me what a fucking idiot I was. From the moment I was no longer deep in sleep, I regretted everything.</p><p>The second thing I usually felt was a toss-up between a headache or the need to vomit, and this morning, after a particularly heavy night, it was both.</p><p>Careful not to wake the sleeping body next to me, I got out of bed and stumbled to the bathroom. I managed to lock the door before having to launch myself at the toilet and spewing the contents of my stomach into it. With my hands on either side of the seat, steadying me as my upper-body lurched and convulsed with every stomach contraction, I threw everything up until there was nothing but bile. My head throbbed twice as hard as it had done before, feeling as though I was being repeatedly kicked in the temple, and as I collapsed into a sitting position on the cool, tiled floor, I thought that having my innards try to escape my body through my mouth was still preferable to the ache of missing Layla.</p><p>I sat in a daze, staring at the marble pattern on the tiles, and building up the energy to get up and take something to ease the pounding pain in my head. I hoped the noise I&rsquo;d probably made hadn&rsquo;t woken up the girl in my bed, the same girl I&rsquo;d told Layla I would never see again, if she didn&rsquo;t want me to. I hadn&rsquo;t intended to have sex with her, she was just one of the few people who knew about Layla, and one of the only ones who was sympathetic and understanding. I&rsquo;d left London after finally accepting that I couldn&rsquo;t stay there, and I wanted comfort from someone who didn&rsquo;t think Layla was a terrible person, someone who&rsquo;d even encouraged me to try and make things right, even though I&rsquo;d lied to her too. I needed a shoulder to cry on, and we ended up in bed together.</p><p>Cringing, I realised that her possibly hearing me being sick was the least of my problems, and it made me clamber to my feet. Shuffling over to the sink, I glanced at the dishevelled reflection in the medicine cabinet and groaned with disgust. Somehow, I managed to look worse than I felt. I yanked the cabinet door open and took out some painkillers - wincing at the sound of the plastic as it crinkled in my fingers noisily - and popped out two pills. Then, cramming them into my mouth, I drank from the cold water tap to help swallow them down, whilst also ridding myself of the horrible taste of vomit in my mouth.</p><p>I considered just climbing back into bed, pulling the covers over my head and just sleeping my hangover away. But, remembering that I wouldn&rsquo;t be alone if I left the bathroom, I decided to shower, and hoped that the water washed away the previous night&rsquo;s mistakes, and all my other ones along with it. <br /></p><p>It had been well over a month since Layla kicked me out of her house, and despite all the ways I&rsquo;d tried to distract myself, still nothing had eased the pain. I felt shattered and broken, my stomach was pained with an emptiness that I couldn&rsquo;t fill, and I couldn&rsquo;t focus on anything. For the first time in my life, I truly understood the meaning of heartache because I felt it all of the time.</p><p>I got straight out of London. I left Layla&rsquo;s house and drove straight up to Holmes-Chapel, to my mum&rsquo;s. I needed the comfort of her and Robin, and I wanted to lick my wounds in a place that was familiar and safe.</p><p>Mum was surprisingly supportive - not that I expected her to really show how happy she felt that my relationship with Lil was over - but I knew that deep down she was pleased and relieved. It had worried her- the age difference, the messy divorce- and both her and Gemma hadn&rsquo;t met Layla in particularly great situations. Hindsight told me that I&rsquo;d let my excitement for them to meet her get the better of me, and it made them dislike our relationship even more.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure it&rsquo;s over?&rdquo; Mum asked as we sat together on the sofa and I told her everything. &nbsp;&ldquo;You thought it was finished before and you still ended up back together.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; I shook my head and looked down at the sleeping cat on my knee, who was stretched out comfortably, without a single care in the world. I envied her. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s for real this time, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything I can do to fix what I did.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then you have to accept her decision and try to move on, love. Sometimes, even though we want it so badly, some things just aren&rsquo;t meant to be. You and Layla just aren&rsquo;t right for each other, and one day, when you&rsquo;ve found someone who is right for you, you will see that.&rdquo; Mum put an arm around my shoulder and kissed my temple tenderly. &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t fix it, then leave her alone.&rdquo;</p><p>But, despite knowing I should follow her advice, I couldn&rsquo;t stop trying to fight Layla&rsquo;s decision. I&rsquo;d call and text constantly, begging to be heard and to be given an opportunity to make things better, but I never got anything back. All I got in return was a taste of my own medicine when she was forced to block any way I had of contacting her. But, when I travelled back to London with hopes of drowning my sorrows with friends over the new year, I took to showing up on her doorstep late at night instead of taking the rather obvious hint that she didn&rsquo;t want anything to do with me.</p><p>Usually drunk, I&rsquo;d kneel down in front of her door and plead through the letterbox to a wall of dark silence. Layla, of course, never responded. She never told me to leave or threaten to call the police, she just sat at the top of the stairs -cold and unmoving- and listened to my drunken pleas for her to reconsider until I gave up and went home. I couldn&rsquo;t ever really see her, save from the odd shadowy figure creeping across the hallway, but with that, and all the lights being turned off suddenly, I knew she was listening. And it only frustrated me more. I&rsquo;d want to bang my fists on the door, to stand in the middle of the street and shout and cause a scene. I wanted to do whatever it took until she let me in. But, even in inebriation, I was aware that it would only make everything worse for both of us. I felt incapable of leaving her alone but I wanted to at least spare her the embarrassment of the police being called, or worse, the press. &nbsp;</p><p>Eventually, I would leave. I&rsquo;d call for a car and I&rsquo;d head home, or to a friend&rsquo;s house, where I would pass out. Then, the next morning, I&rsquo;d wake up and feel a wave of shame crash over me, the morning&rsquo;s harsh light seeming to make the regret that much more worse as I laid in bed, or on a sofa, and recalled what a mess I kept making of things. I&rsquo;d tell myself I was an idiot, and I&rsquo;d vow never to do it again, that this would be the last time. But it never was. Whether it was a day or two later, I&rsquo;d end up back in front of Lil&rsquo;s door.</p><p>The night that resulted in me running to LA had started well. I agreed to go out with Nick, and a few other people I knew through him, to belatedly celebrate New Year. He seemed to be aware that I was upset about something (thanks to my mum, no doubt) and he tried to subtly ask what was going on. But, sensing my reluctance to open up about it, he didn&rsquo;t push any further and just did his best to distract and cheer me up.</p><p>At first, it worked. For the first time in weeks, I found myself genuinely laughing, actually having fun instead of just pretending for the benefit of those around me, and noticing the knot in the pit of my stomach a little less. But the later it got, and the drunker everyone around me became, the more my mood started to drop. I found myself looking around at my friends and wishing I was somewhere else - like the age old cliche - because for all the people in the room, I felt utterly alone.</p><p>So, I left. I made my excuses, jumped in a cab and gave the driver Layla&rsquo;s address.</p><p>Having passed out almost as soon as the car started moving, I woke up when I realised it had come to a stop outside of Layla&rsquo;s house. Blearily handing money over, I stumbled out onto the pavement and waited for the taxi to drive off.</p><p>There wasn&rsquo;t anyone around, the street was quiet, and most of the other houses were in complete darkness apart from the occasional blue glow of a TV flickering in a dimly lit room. Curtains closed, I could see Layla&rsquo;s bedroom light was on. I grabbed at my stomach as it lurched. It was both comforting to know she was close and agonising knowing that it was highly unlikely she&rsquo;d acknowledge me. Ignoring the voice in my head telling me I should just go home, I opened the black, metal gate, walked up the tiled path, and rang the doorbell, starting the whole charade once again.</p><p>Ringing the bell a few more times, I peered through the mottled glass and was surprised to see a perfectly clear outline of Layla standing at the top of the stairs. She hadn&rsquo;t turned all the lights off, and wasn&rsquo;t pretending that she wasn&rsquo;t there but, to my dismay, she wasn&rsquo;t moving either. Crouching down, I opened the letterbox to try see her better, but all I saw was her sitting down in the usual spot.</p><p>Encouraged by her not hiding away, I asked, &ldquo;Lil, please open the door.&rdquo;</p><p>Silence.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to fight, I just want to talk.&rdquo;</p><p>Silence.</p><p>&ldquo;I hate doing this, but baby,&rdquo; I paused, emotion taking over and my voice cracking, &ldquo;Baby, I miss you.&rdquo;</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Her silhouette made the silence worse, confronting me with the truth that all the times I&rsquo;d sat crying and begging for audience, she had been able to listen to me, unmoved. I&rsquo;d always known she was there, but now there was no denying that Layla had heard me and had been able to resist coming to comfort me.</p><p>Resting my head against the red painted door, I started to cry. The frustration of being ignored was overwhelming. I didn&rsquo;t know what else I could say or do to get her to listen to me. I knew I&rsquo;d fucked up, and it had haunted me since I saw the look of pain in Layla&rsquo;s eyes when I&rsquo;d admitted I&rsquo;d cheated on her. But I never expected to feel like she hated me, as though I meant nothing, as though we meant nothing. I took a deep breath and tried again, once again ignoring everything in me that told me to just to leave her alone.</p><p>&ldquo;Layla, Lil, please, can we just talk? I promise, I will leave you alone, but I just want to speak to you.&rdquo;</p><p>Again - nothing but an agonising wall of silence.</p><p>I watched her silhouette slowly get up, and for a split second I hoped she was about to finally relent, but when the lights went out and everything turned dark again, she shut me out once more.</p><p>My heart broke with a fresh, painful wound. I slumped down heavily onto my backside and leant against the brick wall. I knew I should give up, that I should just get up and go home to save more pain and embarrassment. Layla wasn&rsquo;t going to let me in, that was clearer to me now more than ever, but I couldn&rsquo;t move. Frustration was now overruled by defeat, and though I&rsquo;d gone through the same feeling several times before in the very same spot, it was finally setting in that even if I turned up on her doorstep every night - she was never, ever going to let me in.</p><p>With my head in the crook of my elbow, I sobbed. I sat in the covered doorway - the rough &lsquo;Welcome&rsquo; mat under my palm steadying me from curling up in a ball - and I cried. Wishing for an answer, wishing for sobriety, wishing Layla would feel my pain and find a way to forgive me. I wondered if she was hurting the same way as me. At one point, I would have said yes, but I couldn&rsquo;t imagine being able to ignore her if I ever saw her going through the amount of aching need I felt. She had held back from telling me how she felt about me, and as I sat outside the locked door of her home, I began to convince myself that maybe she had never really loved me like I did her. <br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd9598297e184ee2ddcef4b6406d2bb2/tumblr_inline_pj48z10Mkw1w7xqut_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>Terry</b></p><p>It was already late when Layla&rsquo;s call came through. I&rsquo;d had a quiet Friday night at home with Will, and he was fast asleep with his head on my lap, snoring away happily as I ran my fingers through his sandy blonde hair. Staying home, cooking together, and being domestic was still a luxury - something we hadn&rsquo;t yet grown to take advantage of - so even just the sight of his sleeping face made my heart skip a beat in a way that still took me by surprise.</p><p>He stirred as my phone rang, forehead scrunching together as he looked up at me. Initially, I was going to ignore the call, annoyed I had forgotten to switch it off for the night, but seeing Layla&rsquo;s name, I remembered why I hadn&rsquo;t.</p><p>&ldquo;Lil? You okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Will was fully awake then, his head popping up with confusion and concern on his face at the sound of his wife&rsquo;s name. I wished Layla could see him, see the amount of guilt and remorse he felt over what he had done to her. I&rsquo;d seen him battle with it during the majority of our relationship but never to the extent he had since he&rsquo;d punched Harry, effectively ruining Layla&rsquo;s already fragile relationship with the guy. Will had been the catalyst to the enormous breakdown she was experiencing, and I wished she could see that he was desperate to do anything to fix what he&rsquo;d broken.</p><p>On the other end of the phone, Layla was frantic. She wasn&rsquo;t crying but she was close, and I could hear the panic and fear in her voice as she struggled once more with how to handle the man she loved being so open and unrelenting with his refusal to accept that they were over.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Harry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s here again, and I don&rsquo;t know what to do. I&rsquo;m sorry to call you so late-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Layla, it&rsquo;s fine, I told you to call me if he turned up again.&rdquo; Will moved so I could get to my feet. I stroked his warm cheek before going out into the hallway. I hated seeing him so worried, and I hated hearing her so broken. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come over now and take him home. Is he drunk?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes&hellip; yes, I think so. Oh god, Ted, he sounds so&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m so awful, Terry, I&rsquo;m so selfish and horrible. I deserve all of this, but he doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>She began to cry, a sound I had become heartbreakingly familiar with, and I stopped my rushing to get ready so I could comfort her. Using the same Welsh term of endearment my mother used to use for me when I was upset as a child, the word for love, I said softly, &ldquo;Cariad, you&rsquo;re none of those things, and you certainly don&rsquo;t deserve any of this. You&rsquo;re not a bad person for wanting better than what Harry was giving, I&rsquo;ve told you this before.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What if I&rsquo;ve got it wrong? What if I&rsquo;ve made a mistake?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think you&rsquo;ve made a mistake? Deep down, would you be happier going back to how things were? If you change your mind, I&rsquo;m not going to tell you you&rsquo;re right or wrong, I am just asking you what would make you happier in the long run, and not just as a quick fix.&rdquo;</p><p>Layla paused, her sobs becoming quiet sniffs and hiccups. We&rsquo;d talked at great length over what she wanted, and why that hadn&rsquo;t involved Harry being in her life anymore. I wanted to remind her of those things, and why what she was feeling was because of hearing Harry&rsquo;s grief.</p><p>Finally, and as I&rsquo;d expected, she mumbled, &ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t made a mistake.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All right, I will be over as soon as I can. Sit tight, and don&rsquo;t answer the door until I get there. Okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lil.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I promise that this will all get better. I&rsquo;ll speak to Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>She was crying again as we both hung up, and I sighed heavily at Will who was hovering nearby in the doorway of the living room, looking concerned.</p><p>&ldquo;Is she okay?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p>I shook my head and sat down on the hallway chair to put on my shoes. Coming to stand in front of me, Will put a soothing hand on my head, a gesture that thanked me for looking after a woman we had both wronged.</p><p>&ldquo;I have no idea what state Harry&rsquo;s going to be in, so I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ll be back. Please don&rsquo;t wait up, love.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re going to say, but would you like me to come? Even if it&rsquo;s just&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Will&rsquo;s thoughts tailed off as he remembered what we both knew. He would be no use to anyone there and only ran the risk of exasperating things. I knew he wanted to help, but Layla was still refusing to having anything to do with him, and I dreaded to think what Harry would do if he saw him.</p><p>I stood up and cupped his head in my hands before kissing his forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be fine, I&rsquo;ll take Harry home and then I&rsquo;ll be back. Maybe you could text Rose for me? Ask her to check on Lil if she can?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. I love you,&rdquo; Will said, stepping back and grabbing my coat from the rack and helping me into it.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, too.&rdquo;</p><p>I kissed him goodbye and left.</p><p><br /></p><p>When I&rsquo;d gone to check on Layla, the morning after Will had punched Harry, Will had been confused why I still cared about her enough to go and apologise on his behalf. He&rsquo;d told me that I no longer had to pretend to love or care about her, that she was his mess to fix. But I&rsquo;d made it clear that I loved Layla almost as much as I did Mia, that I had never lied when I said I thought of her as a daughter in every sense but blood and name. I went to check on her because I was ashamed of Will&rsquo;s behaviour, and something had told me that I should go and make sure she was okay.</p><p>I found Layla in a state of drunken hysteria that day she (eventually) opened the door to me, with a glass of vodka in hand, and she didn&rsquo;t slam the door in my face like she probably would have done on any other occasions. Instead, she just started to sob and leant against the wall, sliding down it until she was flat on her backside, adding a healthy mix of tears to her drink. I had never seen her so broken and unrestrained in her emotions. Even when she&rsquo;d found Will and I together, she had remained strong, refusing to let the bump in the road get to her, but there had been too many bumps, and Layla had finally reached her limit and blown.</p><p>Helping her up from the floor, I&rsquo;d taken her into the kitchen and sat her down so I could try to sober her up a little. I made her a strong tea, and when she had drunk half the mug and seemed to have calmed down a little, I finally asked, &ldquo;What happened, cariad? Where&rsquo;s Harry?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; she shrugged. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re over.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because of Will?&rdquo;</p><p>Shrugging again, she then shook her head and looked at me with swollen, red eyes, &ldquo;No, well, he didn&rsquo;t help. Or maybe he did, but I&rsquo;m loath to give him credit.&rdquo;</p><p>She started to cry again, but managed to pull back enough so she could continue to explain that she had kicked Harry out. She then told me all about her childhood, about her mother and sister. I had known that she had come from a difficult past, Will had told me, and then so did she when we grew closer. Verity had wanted to hire a personal investigator when the engagement was announced and she realised that Layla was going to be a part of the the family, but Will and his father convinced her not to. She eventually found out some of the details, but none of us knew to what extent Layla had been neglected, or how she had been found when her mother died.</p><p>I sat and listened while Layla spoke, her heart seemingly breaking more and more with every word, and I understood why she had finally fallen to pieces. She had been carrying a heavy load for so many years. With how Will and I had betrayed her, Harry&rsquo;s recent scandal, her argument with Rose, and Will punching Harry on top of all of that, it was no wonder she was in such a mess.</p><p>It became my priority then to look after her, to be the parent I&rsquo;d always claimed to be for her but had screwed up so colossally. I put her to bed with a sick bucket and a glass of water, and then I called Will to say I wasn&rsquo;t going to be at work, that he&rsquo;d have to take my meetings and handle my calls. I hadn&rsquo;t given him an answer when he asked what was wrong. I was so angry with him that I wanted to save it for when I saw him in person. Of all the things that came close to finishing us off, his behaviour to Layla that day, and the things it had resulted in, were at the top of the list. I never saw Will as perfect, I saw his faults clearly, I&rsquo;d always loved him despite them, but I came close to hating him for what he had done to her. I most certainly didn&rsquo;t like him.</p><p>I sat with Layla all night while she slept, scared that she&rsquo;d consumed so much alcohol that something terrible would happen to her. When she woke, I held her hair and stroked her back as she was sick into the blue plastic bucket, her hangover temporarily outweighing the pain she was going through. I then made her some toast, and we talked some more until she needed to sleep again. It was unspoken, but we left our fall out in the past for the moment. I had needed to look after her, and she deeply needed love and affection, so everything else fell by the wayside.</p><p><br /></p><p>There was no sign of Harry when I arrived at Layla&rsquo;s house. Her bedroom light was on and, other than the sound of my engine running, the whole street was silent and still, so I assumed he had already given up and gone home. Wanting to make sure she was okay before I went home, I got out of the car and crossed the road to her house. It wasn&rsquo;t until I reached the gate, and went to push it open, that I saw Harry slumped by the door, crying into the crook of his elbow and looking a little worse for wear.</p><p>He looked up when heard the squeaking of the gate opening, and though he had the decency to look somewhat ashamed, he didn&rsquo;t make any effort to move.</p><p>&ldquo;Did she call you?&rdquo; He demanded. &ldquo;Does she hate me that much that she had to call the man her husband was sleeping with to get rid of me?&rdquo;</p><p>\"Yes, she called me, she&rsquo;s worried about you.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry scoffed and rolled his eyes. I could smell the alcohol on him as I got closer, and I knew it was what was making him belligerent.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s time you went home? Lil isn&rsquo;t going to open the door.&rdquo;</p><p>Sighing heavily, my shoulders dropped when he folded his arms across his chest like a stubborn toddler and refused to move. I pulled out a pack of cigarettes from my jeans pocket, and sat down on the step with my back to him.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t smoke, do you?&rdquo; I asked, realising I should offer him one. He shook his head, and I smiled before lighting the one I&rsquo;d taken out for myself. &ldquo;Good lad. I keep telling Will I&rsquo;m going to give up, but it&rsquo;s really fucking hard when you&rsquo;ve been smoking as long as I have.&rdquo;</p><p>Blowing out a puff of smoke into the night, I spoke again with a much heavier tone, one that was considerably less conversational, &ldquo;You know you have to leave her alone, don&rsquo;t you, Harry?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But-&ldquo;</p><p>I turned to look at him, and he clamped his mouth shut, knowing that arguing with me wasn&rsquo;t going to work.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m being serious. This is becoming too much for her to deal with, and I&rsquo;ve known that girl long enough to know that the more you push, the less likely she is to talk to you.&rdquo;</p><p>He ran his fingers through his hair and wiped the tears from his face with his sleeve. Sniffing, he decided to change tactic and tried to reason with me. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you get her to open the door? I don&rsquo;t want to keep doing this but I-I don&rsquo;t know what else to do.&rdquo; Voice faltering, a fresh wave of tears slid down his cheeks. &ldquo;I love her, Terry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, and she knows too. But it&rsquo;s over, and you have to accept that.&rdquo; I took one final drag before stubbing the embers out on the wall. &ldquo;Harry, Layla is hurting. She&rsquo;s really, really hurting, and not just from what you did, but from finally dealing with how she grew up, from what Will and I did, and facing the unknown of her new life alone. I know you want to speak to her, that you&rsquo;re hurting too, but if you really do love her, you need to back off and accept that this is what she wants. I know it doesn&rsquo;t feel like it, but she wants the best for you, too.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry turned his head to look up at Layla&rsquo;s door, and I hoped my words were managing to work their way through the drink and starting to get through to him that enough was enough. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think she&rsquo;ll ever forgive me?&rdquo; He finally muttered, stroking a silver-ringed finger over a solidified drip of red paint on the door Layla had painted. &ldquo;You know her so well, do you think she&rsquo;ll hate me forever?&rdquo;</p><p>With an involuntary groan, I got to my feet and looked up at the house. Layla was at the window, but I gave no indication that I could see her in case it riled Harry up again. She mouthed an emphatic thank you, then disappeared from view, no doubt to wait anxiously for us to leave.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t know what answer to give Harry, I didn&rsquo;t want to give him any false hope that meant he would continue showing up on her doorstep, but I also didn&rsquo;t want to kick him while he was down. Everything was so delicate, and I felt for both of them, but Layla was my priority, and I had to be honest enough with Harry that he would stop harassing her.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; I eventually said, my gaze dropping from Layla&rsquo;s to meet his, &ldquo;Layla doesn&rsquo;t hate you, she just hates what you did. As for forgiving you? It&rsquo;s a clich&eacute;, I know, but she needs to forgive herself first. You&rsquo;re just one complication that she really doesn&rsquo;t need right now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For her sister? Forgive herself, I mean.&rdquo; Harry asked as though finally realising for the first time that he was just one part in the puzzle of Layla&rsquo;s life. Her sister was the missing piece, and she blamed herself for it being lost. She&rsquo;d tried filling the hole with Harry&rsquo;s love, but she was coming to terms with the fact that he was just a distraction, no matter how much she loved him. &ldquo;Will you tell her that I&rsquo;m sorry, that I&rsquo;ll never regret anything more than hurting her?&rdquo;</p><p>Nodding, I extended my hand to help him up from the floor, and he reluctantly accepted it. He dusted himself off before pressing his palm to the door one last time, probably soaking up the last time he&rsquo;d ever be in front of her home. Sadly, he looked at me, eyes brimming with more tears, and I found myself wishing there could be a way for them to make things work. I recognised that the love he had for her was the same as Will had for me - he obviously felt it deeply but the timing was wrong and everyone had told him he was wrong. I could only hope that Harry and Layla could one day find an equal kind of love with someone else, or find their chance together at another time, like Will and I had.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell her I&rsquo;ll leave her alone,&rdquo; Harry said, turning away from the door. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s what she wants, I won&rsquo;t bother her anymore.&rdquo;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e841586a479005e79589123ddc55960b/tumblr_inline_pj490pMXkh1w7xqut_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>Harry</b></p><p>As Terry led me to his car to drive me home, I turned to give one last look at Layla&rsquo;s house. She was stood in the upstairs window, arms folded across her chest with a hand over her mouth. I couldn&rsquo;t really see clearly enough, but it looked to me like she was crying. Everything in me wanted to start shouting and begging for her to come down and talk to me, but I stopped myself. Instead, I turned away and got into the car, accepting that it was finally time to leave her alone.</p><p>I missed her, I missed seeing her name appearing on the screen of my phone when she&rsquo;d call or send me something silly that had amused her. I missed her voice, the sound of her laughter, her sense of humour, and I missed the way she tasted on my tongue. I knew Terry was right. I had to stop what I was doing, it wasn&rsquo;t helping me, and it wasn&rsquo;t helping her. Layla had no interest in what I had to say to her, and all I was doing was making her hate me more than she probably already did.</p><p>I was determined that I would respect Layla&rsquo;s wishes and leave her alone. I&rsquo;d give her the space she needed, but I knew that she was always going to be on my mind. I&rsquo;d fucked it up, I&rsquo;d ruined what we had, and I was going to spend a long time hating myself for it. Driving away from her home, I knew full well I&rsquo;d never be able to escape my love for Layla - the woman who changed me.</p>",

You slowly reach up to take one of your earphones out and glance around as if there is a possibility she\u2019s talking to anyone else but you, and sadly there isn&rsquo;t.\u00a0\u201cReady for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking right?\u201d She asks and steps into the room a bit more; earning a shrug from you as you take in how dressed up she is.\u00a0\u201cThe <i>party</i>, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought formal was next weekend,\u201d you reply, as you look over at the calendar pinned on the wall to see if you had the dates mixed up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo it is,\u201d she explains, and crosses her arms over her chest.\u00a0\u201cTonight is the start of finals party.\u00a0We\u2019ve only been talking about it for the last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrave of you to assume I have time to go to a party with all the homework I\u2019m drowning in <i>because</i> of finals,\u201d you scoff, and earn yourself an eye-roll.\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t go. I have to get these assignments done so I actually can go to formal next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;re so full of shit,\u201d she states as you scowl.\u00a0\u201cWhy didn&rsquo;t you work on any of these this week instead of leaving it to the last minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was busy,\u201d you mumble and continue narrowing your gaze at her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDoing what?\u201d She challenges with a smirk.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d she replies; nodding her head in a knowing manner.\u00a0\u201cAnd was Harry amongst these many <i>things</i> you were busy doing?\u201d</p><p>Your face instantly reddens at the mention of your boyfriends name, and she knows she\u2019s got you now. After developing feelings for Harry and eventually starting a relationship with him during your freshman year of college, simply just the thought of him makes your heart skip a beat and everyone knows it. \u201cShut up.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming tonight, y\u2019know? Gives you all the reason to just listen to your big, and get ready,\u201d she continues and cuts you off when you try to protest.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t even. I\u2019ll give you twenty minutes before I come back and if you don&rsquo;t at least have an outfit picked out by then, I\u2019ll be dragging your sorry ass down there in all your track pants and messy bun glory.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, she blows you a kiss and disappears out the door; leaving you to wallow in self-pity. You bite down on your bottom lip nervously as you take in the stack of books and notes you&rsquo;re surrounded by, and know as much as you don&rsquo;t want to work on these assignments&hellip; You really do need too.\u00a0</p><p>You immediately move to grab your phone so you can text Harry and ask if you can hide in his room in order to get some work done, but decide against it once you remember it\u2019s one of his frat brothers birthday tonight and they were planning on coming here as part of their night out.\u00a0</p><p>With a dramatic huff, you make the executive decision that Harry wouldn&rsquo;t care if you went to his room without him there, and quickly pack up all your books and laptop to make way to his frat house.\u00a0</p><p>As you\u2019re heading out the bedroom, you leave a note taped to your door as you lock it that reads;\u00a0<i>\u2018I\u2019m sorry but I really need to do these papers. Love, Y/N,</i>\u2019 for when your best friend comes looking for you. With a quick glance over your shoulder to see if anyone has noticed you, you quickly head down the hallway and make your escape.\u00a0</p><p>The cool December air nips at your skin, and you can\u2019t help but let out a loud yawn\u00a0as you walk across campus towards Harry\u2019s fraternity house. Normally you\u2019d admire the pretty Christmas decorations that light up your way there, or stop and talk to some of the people you pass that all seem to be heading to your sorority house for the party&hellip; But you don&rsquo;t - tonight you\u2019re on a mission to not fail any classes regardless of how tired and uninterested you are.\u00a0</p><p>When you arrive to the frat house it\u2019s unsurprisingly empty. You knew it\u2019d be this way with it being one of the members birthday and all, but it\u2019s still weird seeing a place that\u2019s usually so loud and rambunctious, be so peaceful and quiet.</p><p>A few of the members greet you as they pass you on their way out, and you just smile and tell them to have fun as you dig the spare key Harry gave you to his room out from the bottom of your bag; before heading upstairs to his cozy bed and getting to work.\u00a0</p><p>Across campus about an hour or so later, Harry and his friends are making way to your house after the large group of them just finished up at a small pub down the road from the university. Liam, Niall and Louis are all plastered out of their minds already, but Harry decided to take it easy on the alcohol tonight; being more focused on how he\u2019ll get to see his loving girlfriend in a few short minutes.\u00a0</p><p>As soon as the group of guys step foot into your sorority house, H can see that the party is in full swing. He immediately separates from his friends to look for you amongst the crowd, and can\u2019t help but frown slightly when he can&rsquo;t seem to find you.\u00a0</p><p>He makes way into the kitchen where Liam hands him a drink, and see\u2019s your best friend. She\u2019s quick ending the conversation she\u2019s having so she can push through the crowd to come over and talk to him.\u00a0\u201cHey, have you seen Y/N?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, isn\u2019t she here?\u201d He asks with confusion written well across his face, as your friend lets out a breath.</p><p>\u201cWell she was,\u201d she explains.\u00a0\u201cShe was working on homework and I guess I may have tried to guilt her into coming downstairs for the party, but when I went back to get her she was gone. Hasn&rsquo;t answered any of my texts or calls since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she tell anyone where she was going?\u201d Your boyfriend continues to press, as he feels a bit of uneasiness start to take over his body as your best friend just shrugs. Before anything else can be said, he\u2019s downing the drink Liam gave him, and zipping up his coat to head back outside into the cold weather.\u00a0\u201cM\u2019gonna go look for her.\u201d</p><p>Despite others offering to help, Harry embarks on his search to find you alone. His first stop is the library, thinking that with it being finals season and there being extended hours that\u2019d be the first place you\u2019d go; but much to his dismay the building is completely dark when he gets to it.\u00a0</p><p>His next stop is your favourite coffee shop on campus, but again his hope is lost when he finds a lone employee sweeping the floor of the completely empty cafe. He\u2019s running out of ideas as he brings your name up on his phone to call you once again, and can\u2019t help the feeling of panic arise when he\u2019s met by your voicemail yet again.\u00a0</p><p>He spends the next hour walking around campus constantly texting his friends and yours to see if anyone has seen you, and has yet to get any news regarding your whereabouts.\u00a0</p><p>He walks down one of the many paths throughout campus, and glances over to his frat house a couple of feet away as people head up the stairs of it to continue partying into the late hours of the night; an idea springing to his mind as he does so&hellip; This is the one place he hasn\u2019t looked for you.\u00a0</p><p>Once he\u2019s in the front door of the house he wastes no time rushing up the stairs towards his bedroom, hoping that he\u2019ll find you there deeply focused on your schoolwork rather than being off hurt somewhere like the anxious thoughts filling his mind are telling him. He pauses for a second outside his bedroom door as he finds it unlocked, before slowly opening it and letting out a sigh of relief.\u00a0</p><p>Inside he finds you passed right out across his bed surrounded by various textbooks and notes, with your laptop still open right beside you. He chuckles a little bit at the sight and moves to tidy up your things as quietly as he can without disturbing your beauty rest.\u00a0</p><p>A small smirk forms on his lips as he notices you&rsquo;ve stolen one of his Green Bay Packers hoodies to wear, but can&rsquo;t even be mad with how comfy and cute you look with it on as you sleep. Once he\u2019s done moving your things he unplugs your headphones from your laptop and into his iPad; turning the music up a little bit so the loud noises coming from downstairs\u00a0don&rsquo;t wake you.\u00a0</p><p>He places a soft peck onto your forehead before ridding himself of the shirt and jeans he wore out, leaving him in just his boxers as he shuts the light off and crawls into bed beside you - smiling like a complete idiot as you unconsciously nuzzle into his chest; and he eventually falls asleep with his arms wrapped securely around you.\u00a0</p>",

You slowly reach up to take one of your earphones out and glance around as if there is a possibility she\u2019s talking to anyone else but you, and sadly there isn\u2019t.\u00a0\u201cReady for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking right?\u201d She asks and steps into the room a bit more; earning a shrug from you as you take in how dressed up she is.\u00a0\u201cThe <i>party</i>, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought formal was next weekend,\u201d you reply, as you look over at the calendar pinned on the wall to see if you had the dates mixed up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo it is,\u201d she explains, and crosses her arms over her chest.\u00a0\u201cTonight is the start of finals party.\u00a0We\u2019ve only been talking about it for the last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrave of you to assume I have time to go to a party with all the homework I\u2019m drowning in <i>because</i> of finals,\u201d you scoff, and earn yourself an eye-roll.\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t go. I have to get these assignments done so I actually can go to formal next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so full of shit,\u201d she states as you scowl.\u00a0\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you work on any of these this week instead of leaving it to the last minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was busy,\u201d you mumble and continue narrowing your gaze at her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDoing what?\u201d She challenges with a smirk.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d she replies; nodding her head in a knowing manner.\u00a0\u201cAnd was Harry amongst these many <i>things</i> you were busy doing?\u201d</p><p>Your face instantly reddens at the mention of your boyfriends name, and she knows she\u2019s got you now. After developing feelings for Harry and eventually starting a relationship with him during your freshman year of college, simply just the thought of him makes your heart skip a beat and everyone knows it. \u201cShut up.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming tonight, y\u2019know? Gives you all the reason to just listen to your big, and get ready,\u201d she continues and cuts you off when you try to protest.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t even. I\u2019ll give you twenty minutes before I come back and if you don\u2019t at least have an outfit picked out by then, I\u2019ll be dragging your sorry ass down there in all your track pants and messy bun glory.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, she blows you a kiss and disappears out the door; leaving you to wallow in self-pity. You bite down on your bottom lip nervously as you take in the stack of books and notes you\u2019re surrounded by, and know as much as you don\u2019t want to work on these assignments\u2026 You really do need too.\u00a0</p><p>You immediately move to grab your phone so you can text Harry and ask if you can hide in his room in order to get some work done, but decide against it once you remember it\u2019s one of his frat brothers birthday tonight and they were planning on coming here as part of their night out.\u00a0</p><p>With a dramatic huff, you make the executive decision that Harry wouldn\u2019t care if you went to his room without him there, and quickly pack up all your books and laptop to make way to his frat house.\u00a0</p><p>As you\u2019re heading out the bedroom, you leave a note taped to your door as you lock it that reads;\u00a0<i>\u2018I\u2019m sorry but I really need to do these papers. Love, Y/N,</i>\u2019 for when your best friend comes looking for you. With a quick glance over your shoulder to see if anyone has noticed you, you quickly head down the hallway and make your escape.\u00a0</p><p>The cool December air nips at your skin, and you can\u2019t help but let out a loud yawn\u00a0as you walk across campus towards Harry\u2019s fraternity house. Normally you\u2019d admire the pretty Christmas decorations that light up your way there, or stop and talk to some of the people you pass that all seem to be heading to your sorority house for the party\u2026 But you don\u2019t - tonight you\u2019re on a mission to not fail any classes regardless of how tired and uninterested you are.\u00a0</p><p>When you arrive to the frat house it\u2019s unsurprisingly empty. You knew it\u2019d be this way with it being one of the members birthday and all, but it\u2019s still weird seeing a place that\u2019s usually so loud and rambunctious, be so peaceful and quiet.</p><p>A few of the members greet you as they pass you on their way out, and you just smile and tell them to have fun as you dig the spare key Harry gave you to his room out from the bottom of your bag; before heading upstairs to his cozy bed and getting to work.\u00a0</p><p>Across campus about an hour or so later, Harry and his friends are making way to your house after the large group of them just finished up at a small pub down the road from the university. Liam, Niall and Louis are all plastered out of their minds already, but Harry decided to take it easy on the alcohol tonight; being more focused on how he\u2019ll get to see his loving girlfriend in a few short minutes.\u00a0</p><p>As soon as the group of guys step foot into your sorority house, H can see that the party is in full swing. He immediately separates from his friends to look for you amongst the crowd, and can\u2019t help but frown slightly when he can\u2019t seem to find you.\u00a0</p><p>He makes way into the kitchen where Liam hands him a drink, and see\u2019s your best friend. She\u2019s quick ending the conversation she\u2019s having so she can push through the crowd to come over and talk to him.\u00a0\u201cHey, have you seen Y/N?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, isn\u2019t she here?\u201d He asks with confusion written well across his face, as your friend lets out a breath.</p><p>\u201cWell she was,\u201d she explains.\u00a0\u201cShe was working on homework and I guess I may have tried to guilt her into coming downstairs for the party, but when I went back to get her she was gone. Hasn\u2019t answered any of my texts or calls since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she tell anyone where she was going?\u201d Your boyfriend continues to press, as he feels a bit of uneasiness start to take over his body as your best friend just shrugs. Before anything else can be said, he\u2019s downing the drink Liam gave him, and zipping up his coat to head back outside into the cold weather.\u00a0\u201cM\u2019gonna go look for her.\u201d</p><p>Despite others offering to help, Harry embarks on his search to find you alone. His first stop is the library, thinking that with it being finals season and there being extended hours that\u2019d be the first place you\u2019d go; but much to his dismay the building is completely dark when he gets to it.\u00a0</p><p>His next stop is your favourite coffee shop on campus, but again his hope is lost when he finds a lone employee sweeping the floor of the completely empty cafe. He\u2019s running out of ideas as he brings your name up on his phone to call you once again, and can\u2019t help the feeling of panic arise when he\u2019s met by your voicemail yet again.\u00a0</p><p>He spends the next hour walking around campus constantly texting his friends and yours to see if anyone has seen you, and has yet to get any news regarding your whereabouts.\u00a0</p><p>He walks down one of the many paths throughout campus, and glances over to his frat house a couple of feet away as people head up the stairs of it to continue partying into the late hours of the night; an idea springing to his mind as he does so\u2026 This is the one place he hasn\u2019t looked for you.\u00a0</p><p>Once he\u2019s in the front door of the house he wastes no time rushing up the stairs towards his bedroom, hoping that he\u2019ll find you there deeply focused on your schoolwork rather than being off hurt somewhere like the anxious thoughts filling his mind are telling him. He pauses for a second outside his bedroom door as he finds it unlocked, before slowly opening it and letting out a sigh of relief.\u00a0</p><p>Inside he finds you passed right out across his bed surrounded by various textbooks and notes, with your laptop still open right beside you. He chuckles a little bit at the sight and moves to tidy up your things as quietly as he can without disturbing your beauty rest.\u00a0</p><p>A small smirk forms on his lips as he notices you\u2019ve stolen one of his Green Bay Packers hoodies to wear, but can\u2019t even be mad with how comfy and cute you look with it on as you sleep. Once he\u2019s done moving your things he unplugs your headphones from your laptop and into his iPad; turning the music up a little bit so the loud noises coming from downstairs\u00a0don\u2019t wake you.\u00a0</p><p>He places a soft peck onto your forehead before ridding himself of the shirt and jeans he wore out, leaving him in just his boxers as he shuts the light off and crawls into bed beside you - smiling like a complete idiot as you unconsciously nuzzle into his chest; and he eventually falls asleep with his arms wrapped securely around you.\u00a0</p></p>",

You bite down on your bottom lip nervously as you take in the stack of books and notes you&rsquo;re surrounded by, and know as much as you don&rsquo;t want to work on these assignments&hellip; You really do need too.&nbsp;</p><p>You immediately move to grab your phone so you can text Harry and ask if you can hide in his room in order to get some work done, but decide against it once you remember it&rsquo;s one of his frat brothers birthday tonight and they were planning on coming here as part of their night out.&nbsp;</p><p>With a dramatic huff, you make the executive decision that Harry wouldn&rsquo;t care if you went to his room without him there, and quickly pack up all your books and laptop to make way to his frat house.&nbsp;</p><p>As you&rsquo;re heading out the bedroom, you leave a note taped to your door as you lock it that reads;&nbsp;<i>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry but I really need to do these papers. Love, Y/N,</i>&rsquo; for when your best friend comes looking for you. With a quick glance over your shoulder to see if anyone has noticed you, you quickly head down the hallway and make your escape.&nbsp;</p><p>The cool December air nips at your skin, and you can&rsquo;t help but let out a loud yawn&nbsp;as you walk across campus towards Harry&rsquo;s fraternity house. Normally you&rsquo;d admire the pretty Christmas decorations that light up your way there, or stop and talk to some of the people you pass that all seem to be heading to your sorority house for the party&hellip; But you don&rsquo;t - tonight you&rsquo;re on a mission to not fail any classes regardless of how tired and uninterested you are.&nbsp;</p><p>When you arrive to the frat house it&rsquo;s unsurprisingly empty. You knew it&rsquo;d be this way with it being one of the members birthday and all, but it&rsquo;s still weird seeing a place that&rsquo;s usually so loud and rambunctious, be so peaceful and quiet.</p><p>A few of the members greet you as they pass you on their way out, and you just smile and tell them to have fun as you dig the spare key Harry gave you to his room out from the bottom of your bag; before heading upstairs to his cozy bed and getting to work.&nbsp;</p><p>Across campus about an hour or so later, Harry and his friends are making way to your house after the large group of them just finished up at a small pub down the road from the university. Liam, Niall and Louis are all plastered out of their minds already, but Harry decided to take it easy on the alcohol tonight; being more focused on how he&rsquo;ll get to see his loving girlfriend in a few short minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>As soon as the group of guys step foot into your sorority house, H can see that the party is in full swing. He immediately separates from his friends to look for you amongst the crowd, and can&rsquo;t help but frown slightly when he can&rsquo;t seem to find you.&nbsp;</p><p>He makes way into the kitchen where Liam hands him a drink, and see&rsquo;s your best friend. She&rsquo;s quick ending the conversation she&rsquo;s having so she can push through the crowd to come over and talk to him.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey, have you seen Y/N?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;No, isn&rsquo;t she here?&rdquo; He asks with confusion written well across his face, as your friend lets out a breath.</p><p>&ldquo;Well she was,&rdquo; she explains.&nbsp;&ldquo;She was working on homework and I guess I may have tried to guilt her into coming downstairs for the party, but when I went back to get her she was gone. Hasn&rsquo;t answered any of my texts or calls since.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did she tell anyone where she was going?&rdquo; Your boyfriend continues to press, as he feels a bit of uneasiness start to take over his body as your best friend just shrugs. Before anything else can be said, he&rsquo;s downing the drink Liam gave him, and zipping up his coat to head back outside into the cold weather.&nbsp;&ldquo;M&rsquo;gonna go look for her.&rdquo;</p><p>Despite others offering to help, Harry embarks on his search to find you alone. His first stop is the library, thinking that with it being finals season and there being extended hours that&rsquo;d be the first place you&rsquo;d go; but much to his dismay the building is completely dark when he gets to it.&nbsp;</p><p>His next stop is your favourite coffee shop on campus, but again his hope is lost when he finds a lone employee sweeping the floor of the completely empty cafe. He&rsquo;s running out of ideas as he brings your name up on his phone to call you once again, and can&rsquo;t help the feeling of panic arise when he&rsquo;s met by your voicemail yet again.&nbsp;</p><p>He spends the next hour walking around campus constantly texting his friends and yours to see if anyone has seen you, and has yet to get any news regarding your whereabouts.&nbsp;</p><p>He walks down one of the many paths throughout campus, and glances over to his frat house a couple of feet away as people head up the stairs of it to continue partying into the late hours of the night; an idea springing to his mind as he does so&hellip; This is the one place he hasn&rsquo;t looked for you.&nbsp;</p><p>Once he&rsquo;s in the front door of the house he wastes no time rushing up the stairs towards his bedroom, hoping that he&rsquo;ll find you there deeply focused on your schoolwork rather than being off hurt somewhere like the anxious thoughts filling his mind are telling him. He pauses for a second outside his bedroom door as he finds it unlocked, before slowly opening it and letting out a sigh of relief.&nbsp;</p><p>Inside he finds you passed right out across his bed surrounded by various textbooks and notes, with your laptop still open right beside you. He chuckles a little bit at the sight and moves to tidy up your things as quietly as he can without disturbing your beauty rest.&nbsp;</p><p>A small smirk forms on his lips as he notices you&rsquo;ve stolen one of his Green Bay Packers hoodies to wear, but can&rsquo;t even be mad with how comfy and cute you look with it on as you sleep. Once he&rsquo;s done moving your things he unplugs your headphones from your laptop and into his iPad; turning the music up a little bit so the loud noises coming from downstairs&nbsp;don&rsquo;t wake you.&nbsp;</p><p>He places a soft peck onto your forehead before ridding himself of the shirt and jeans he wore out, leaving him in just his boxers as he shuts the light off and crawls into bed beside you - smiling like a complete idiot as you unconsciously nuzzle into his chest; and he eventually falls asleep with his arms wrapped securely around you.&nbsp;</p></p>",

Can\u2019t wait until I don\u2019t have to say goodbye you; can\u2019t wait for that, \u2018cause \u2018m happiest whenever you\u2019re with me,\u201d he hums, kissing your temple, his nose nudged into your hair as he breathes in your scent.</p><p>He never wants to leave you. He would take every moment with you he could possibly have \u2013 hugging you, kissing you, touching you, laughing with you, cuddling you; simply<i> </i>having you with him made him happy.</p><p>He would give everything to make you happy and living thousands of miles away wasn\u2019t doing anything of the sort.</p><p>\u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>He picks his duffle up, setting it on his shoulder, his arm wrapping around you, pulling you into his warmth, his lips touching your hair, your fingertips holding his waist as you begin walking towards your car, his sunglasses pulled onto his nose and your hat covering your face as you avoid the flashing lights. He sighs in defeat, his heart broken as he feels your fingers squeeze his hip, your face hiding in his chest, the overwhelming sounds of questions about your relationship and your future being yelled and screamed as you walk your path to your spot in the garage. He hates it.</p><p>Harry breathes in deeply as you click your car\u2019s alarm, the backseat door pulling open to toss his bags on the floor, your figure settling in the driver\u2019s seat as he climbs into the passenger seat. He is <i>tired</i> \u2013 tired of how the media portrays your relationship, how you are burdened with questions about being with him and how you could forgive him. He rubs his palms against his cheeks in frustration, his mind wandering to questions he shouldn\u2019t be thinking about \u2013 because you would only deny what he would be thinking.</p><p>\u201cSweet?\u201d he murmurs, his fingertips toying with his rings as he awaits your response, his heart skipping as you smile at him innocently.</p><p>\u201cBub?\u201d you giggle, lacing your fingertips through his and squeezing lightly.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel like you have to be with me? Don\u2019t have to feel like that, ever. \u2018s not like we\u2019re engaged or somethin\u2019, right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, why on earth would you ask me that?\u201d you huff, shaking your head as you pull into your apartment\u2019s garage, your foot heavy on the break as you shift the gear into park, your torso turning to face your boyfriend, your eyes matching his stare as you trace the features on his face. He does this every so often \u2013 worries about your judgement and decision of dating him \u2013 especially when reporters are surrounding you with questions regarding your relationship. His features are tired and worn, and worry is furrowing his brows together. \u201cWhy would you think I don\u2019t want to be with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d he mutters, his lips pursing as you softly cup his cheeks, his gaze matching yours, his eyes softening as you breathe deeply. \u201cWith everything that reporters and everyone online says, \u2018s jus\u2019 that I get worried that you\u2019ll feel as though you\u2019re bein\u2019 pressured into this, y\u2019a know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry Styles, how many times do I have to tell you how much I love you, hm? I love you and becoming your girlfriend is the very best thing that has ever happened to me, y\u2019a know that? How could I not want you in my life? <i>I</i> <i>love you</i>, always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, always.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>He smiled as you hummed to yourself, his toothbrush hanging limply between his lips as he grabs a towel to wipe his lips and dry his face, his hair pulled into a bun, his chest bare as his boxers cling to his hips, his clothes tossed into your laundry bin once he stepped into your shower when you settled inside your home. He is his happiest with you \u2013 when you\u2019re complaining about your professors while you have a shower and he\u2019s brushing his teeth, or how you brush your fingers through his hair as he lays on your chest when you\u2019re in bed watching your favourite television programme, or how he can feel if you\u2019re not falling asleep and want to talk until early hours in the morning.</p><p>He loved every moment of it.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s coming to dinner tomorrow? \u2018s your brother and Hadley, Phoebe and her boyfriend, and your parents? \u2018s all who\u2019s coming, right?\u201d he wonders, propping his hands against your countertop, his smirk bright as you step outside of your shower, your eyes rolling dramatically as you spot your towel set beside him.</p><p>\u201cGive me <i>back</i> my towel, please and thank you,\u201d you huff, your lips curving into a smile as you reach for your set, your heart beating loudly as he kisses your cheek as you stand in front of his tall figure. \u201cOh, and, yes, <i>sort of</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018<i>sort of</i>\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, my family <i>will</i> be there, but there are a few more people that are coming, as well,\u201d you note, your lips pursing together as you step into your closet, desperately trying to avoid his conversation. He would start to panic \u2013 and the very last thing you would want is for him to have anxiety before having a full day with your family.</p><p>\u201cOkay, how many is a \u2018few\u2019?\u201d he presses, his hands touching the doorframe as he waits on your response. He was beginning to get anxious.</p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d you stutter, pulling a tattered tee shirt of his over your torso, your hair brushed and slicked across your back as you step outside of your wardrobe and begin walking into your bedroom, \u201cWe have to pick up Granny on our way in, Aunt Ella and Uncle Jay, Uncle Dave and Uncle Joe, and our cousins \u2013 but \u2018m not too sure who Mom invited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Christ,\u201d he grumbles, shuffling into your bedroom and laying dramatically on your duvet.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>His anxiety is written across his features, and your heart breaks for him.</p><p>\u201c\u2019m gon\u2019a be hated by everyone there, aren\u2019t I?\u201d he whispers, his palms covering his face as he heaves heavy breaths. He can feel his heart beating through his rib cage.</p><p>\u201cWhy would they hate you?\u201d you wonder, confusion spread across your features, your head shaking as you nudge his figure to sit on his bum, your tiny form settled between his thighs. \u201cHarry, I have never met <i>anyone</i> that has ever hated you with any inkling of their heart. Why would my family dislike you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I did the <i>one</i> <i>thing</i> I promised I would never do to you!\u201d he spits, his chin dipping onto his chest, his fingertips nudging into his eyes as he struggles to hold steady breaths. He doesn\u2019t want to match your stare. \u201cIt was everywhere \u2013 everyone knew, and everyone could see. I hurt you. I don\u2019t deserve to be liked by your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Bubby. C\u2019mon, look at me.\u201d Harry huffs in defeat, his eyes glossed with tears, his lips pursed in a line as he listens to you. \u201cHave I forgiven you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I love you?\u201d you ask, your palms cupping his cheeks, brushing your thumbs alongst his cheeks. His should know you love him - you tell him you love him in every other breath \u2013 especially when he was beginning to doubt or feel bad about what had happened before.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he sighs, blinking slowly, meeting your soft, blue eyes as you calm him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what <i>anyone</i> has to say. Do you understand me? Harry, you are everything to me, despite what anyone could ever have to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, it\u2019s your <i>family</i>. \u2018s reasonable as to why they wouldn\u2019t like me. It\u2019s horrible, too, because whenever an article about it pops up and crosses me, I can\u2019t stop thinking about what I did. I\u2019m sorry about it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, my <i>love</i>,\u201d you comfort, shaking your head as you settle on his thigh, his hands instinctively holding your thigh and waist, squeezing you tight. \u201cWe broke up, yeah, and my heart was broken for a while, I won\u2019t deny that.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019m sorry,\u201d he interrupts, kissing your collarbone as your arms wrap around his shoulders.</p><p>\u201c<i>But</i>, you are the one that makes my heart whole \u2013 that\u2019s why my heart broke, because I wasn\u2019t with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurt me, <i>a lot</i>, when I couldn\u2019t be with you,\u201d he confesses, closing his eyes as you hug him tightly.</p><p>\u201cHarry, you make my heart happy. Do you know that? Bub, you make me so happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019s all I want, always \u2013 to make you happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, baby, you do,\u201d you state confidently, kissing his lips, your smile breaking apart your kiss you. \u201cVery happy. I love you, and \u2018m very happy and feel very loved by you, always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he smiles, squeezing your waist as you stand, holding his hands, laughing loudly as you struggle to pull him off of your mattress.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to do, Sweet?\u201d he chuckles, wrapping his arms around your waist and pulling you onto him, your smile making his heart swell, your nose nudged against his and he holds you close to him.</p><p>\u201c\u2019m trying to have you cuddle me.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019m cuddling you, right now, aren\u2019t I?\u201d he smirks; he knows that he\u2019s pushing your buttons, but he loves to see you playfully flustered, especially when you\u2019re having a good night.</p><p>\u201cPain in my ass, y\u2019know that?\u201d you moan, rolling your eyes as you brush his hair out of his face.</p><p>\u201cHm, but you love me,\u201d he grins, kissing you as you smile, your hearts beating against each other as he holds you close to his chest.</p><p>\u201cI do, I really do.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Harry straightens his top, readjusting the buttons he\u2019s done four times, questioning his decision to leave two slots unbuttoned, worried he would give the wrong impression with his appearance with your family. He runs his fingers through his hair, patting his cheeks, his fingers fumbling with his jeans buttons as he sticks his feet inside his favourite pair of boots. He smiles, a chuckle leaving his lips as he spots you laying on your mattress in defeat, your torso naked from your dress, only clothes in a bralette and lace panties he had a keen liking of.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, you\u2019re gon\u2019a make us late to pick up <i>Granny</i>,\u201d he smirks, coaxing your body off of your comforter, his laugh rumbling his chest as you knock your forehead against his collarbone. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have any clue where my dress is,\u201d you groan, eyelashes fluttering closes as he kisses your temple. \u201cWe have to leave in ten minutes and \u2018m still naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind it,\u201d he shrugs, his laugh echoing around the bedroom, as you smack his arm. \u201cPut your dress up in your washroom. Wanted to iron it for you whilst you were doing your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry Styles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d he grins, his dimple indenting his cheek as he kisses your temple, patting your bum as you begin to walk out of your bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too. Go on, go get dressed so we can leave. \u2018m not picking your grandmother up late. I\u2019ll leave without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, you will,\u201d you smirk, your feet bouncing on your floorboards as you walk into your washroom, your heart warm as you spot your dress hanging up neatly on the door, a note sticking on the wood:</p><p><i>I love you, Sweet. Happy Thanksgiving</i>. <i>x</i></p><p>He walks around your bedroom, stepping in front of your mirror and beginning to grab his wallet and keys from your dresser, his pockets beginning to fill as his phone is slipped into his jeans. He smiles as he feels your arms wrap around his waist, your lips touching his neck as you hug him, your blushed cheeks tight in a smile as he nudges you in front of him, his hands holding you in front of him, his eyes taking in your appearance. \u201cBeautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBub, <i>stop it</i>.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t stop complimenting you \u2013 he wanted you to truly know how beautiful you are, especially to him \u2013 you knew that very well, no matter how many times you told him to.</p><p>\u201c\u2019s this okay? Haven\u2019t been to a Thanksgiving Dinner with my girl\u2019s family, ever. Don\u2019t really know how to dress for the occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay \u2018my girl\u2019 again,\u201d you smile, brushing your palms over his collarbone, your lips touching his jaw softly.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he questions, kissing you sweetly as your arms wrap around his shoulders.</p><p>\u201c<i>Because</i>, \u2018s the sweetest thing; you give me butterflies when you say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope you know you\u2019re <i>my girl</i> always,\u201d Harry smiles, kissing your cheek as he hugs you tight.</p><p>\u201cBetter be,\u201d you wink, squeezing him close, your hands beginning to grab your purse and pop your essentials inside, your eyes traveling around your bedroom to ensure you wouldn\u2019t forget anything.</p><p>\u201cDo I look alright? Will I make a good impression?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBub, you make the <i>best</i> impressions,\u201d you smile widely, lacing your fingertips through his as you begin to walk out of your apartment.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he says softly, holding your hand as you step into your car, your purse and his belongings sitting in the console, his lips pursing as you smile.</p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes meet yours as he begins to close the door, hesitating before walking to his driver\u2019s seat and sliding inside, and you can see the nervousness overwhelming him. He is confident, a strong character, but he was anxious. He wanted his first impression to be perfect, to be liked by everyone and be loved by your parents.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d you emphasise, your lips touching his hand, your thumb rubbing his palm comfortingly, your heart softening as he smiles at you.</p><p>Harry would be loved by everyone. He always is.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cGranny? We\u2019re here!\u201d you shout, stepping inside her home and peeking around her kitchen to spot her kitchen scattered with desserts to bring with her to your parent\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cHi, sweetheart! I\u2019ll be right out!\u201d she calls, her dainty voice echoing off her walls.</p><p>Harry walks deeper into her foyer, his grin aching his cheeks as he carefully admires every picture of you structured on her wall. He envisioned how many pictures your mother and father have, how many he would be able to go through and tease you for, which ones from your adolescent and teenage years that would be his favourites, which school pictures he would point out, which candid he would see of you laughing that make his heart soar.</p><p>\u201cSweet, look at you,\u201d Harry smirks, his fingertip touching your grandmother\u2019s frame. \u201cCute baby, you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut your mouth, \u2019ve seen your naked baby pictures,\u201d you stern, your eyes rolling as he chuckles, your teeth biting your lip in an (awful) attempt to hide your smile. He opens his arms wide, his chest heaving a heavy breath as you wrap your arms around his waist, his lips kissing your hair, your cheek laying against his heart as you stand close to him.</p><p>\u201cHave seen me naked as an adult, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry!\u201d you gasp, stepping backwards, his hands holding yours as he laughs loudly, your jaw agape as you stare at him in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cHow are you, lovey? Oh! You must be Harry,\u201d your grandmother chirps, stepping into the foyer, her smile bright as she kisses your cheek, her attention averting to Harry as he stands shyly behind you.</p><p>\u201cHi, that\u2019s me,\u201d he chuckles, his eyebrows raising in surprise as she embraces him, her tiny figure surrounded by him as he hugs her.</p><p>\u201cHarry, I\u2019m Granny. It\u2019s nice to finally meet you!\u201d she grins, her hands holding his lightly as she steps back, her smirk making you blush as she nods excitedly.</p><p>\u201cSame to you,\u201d he smiles warmly, his anxiety beginning to deflate as he listens to her whispers of approval and praise.</p><p>\u201cVery nice, honey bee,\u201d she winks, squeezing your arm with a smile, pretending to whisper. \u201cHe\u2019s handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGranny, shh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould marry him, you\u2019ll have beautiful babies,\u201d Granny giggles, patting your cheek as she begins gathering her purse and desserts.</p><p>\u201cGranny!\u201d you squeak, shaking your head, your mouth agape as you listen to your <i>boyfriend</i> and your <i>grandmother</i> talk about marriage.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me think about it, Granny.\u201d Harry smiles <i>so </i>widely \u2013 quite possibly the greatest smile you have ever seen on his features \u2013 and your heart swells. He is becoming surer of himself, more <i>Harry</i>.</p><p>\u201c\u2019m waiting for the day I can say, \u2018<i>I told you so</i>\u2019!\u201d she chimes, stepping outside of her home behind you, closing and locking her front door, happily following her paved walkway to get into your car.</p><p>He smiles at you, wrapping his arm around your shoulder and kissing your temple, his voice rasped and low when he whispers, \u201c\u2019m excited for the day she says, \u2018<i>I told you so\u2019</i>, too.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>His heart is warm and his mind soothed as he steps into your parent\u2019s house. He is comfortable there; your family had welcomed him with love every time he stepped foot inside their foyer, and he knew he wouldn\u2019t be expected to be a publicised version of himself; with your family, he was himself \u2013 his natural, funny, confident, loving self \u2013 and he was so appreciative of their acceptance and kindness.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d Harry shouts, his heart warming as you grin, your arms wrapping around and hugging his waist tightly as he kisses your hair.</p><p>\u201cHarry! We are so happy you made it. Come in, come in,\u201d your mother grins, embracing Harry lightly, her hands rubbing against her apron as she kisses your cheek, her full attention drawn to him, \u201cHow was your flight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Y/M/N,\u201d he grins, kissing your mother\u2019s cheek sweetly, following her path as she perks her ears to the cooking timer. She bustles into their kitchen, her attention shifting focus as she holds her oven mitts and pulls the turkey out of the oven. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t too bad, thank you for asking. Originally, I wasn\u2019t set to fly in until next week, but when Y/N called and asked if I wanted to celebrate with you, I booked the first red-eye out of Mexico City from the Press Conference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, please, you can call me \u2018Mom\u2019 like the whole lot of \u2018em do,\u201d she hums, her heart warm as she admires how he <i>smiles</i> at you. She could see how much he loved you. \u201cShe told us! We are <i>so</i> happy you could be with us, today. Y/N told us you were flying in yesterday and to set a place, and the whole family has been talking about you coming \u2013 especially Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Stop</i>,\u201d you blush, hiding your face in your palms as you lean against your mother\u2019s counter.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s fine, sweetheart. Harry must know you talk about him a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Sweet \u2013 tell me how much you talk about me,\u201d he smirks, wrapping his arms around your waist, his lips touching your cheek softly, his heart softening as you turn in his arms, crossing your arms around his shoulders, kissing his lips with a smile.</p><p>Harry laughs loudly, his heart warm and swollen as she listens to your mother talk, revealing how you talk about him and how happy his coming had made you. He smiled, closing his eyes as you squeeze his hips.</p><p>\u201cGod, you are <i>all</i> feeding his ego, right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid someone say <i>whipped</i>,\u201d James snorts, his daughter propped on his hip, his wife talking mindlessly with Phoebe. He chuckles as you smack his arm, his hands placing his daughter in your hold as she reaches for you.</p><p>\u201c<i>Shut up</i>!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I help in any way, <i>Mom</i>?\u201d he smiles, his cheeks aching as he grins at your niece, her laughter making his heart warm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright! Go into the living room. Y/D/N has a game on \u2013 I\u2019m not too sure which one, but he\u2019ll be very happy to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he nods, his smile etched into his features as he kisses your cheek, his heart beating anxiously as he spots your father, his hand propped with a beer, his nervousness spiking, \u201cthank you, again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d your father greets, standing onto his feet and hugging him warmly, \u201chow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019m good, how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright! We have the family together, today. It\u2019s always a great day when that happens,\u201d he smiles brightly, settling in his lounger and turning the television\u2019s volume down.</p><p>\u201c\u2019m grateful you invited me,\u201d Harry stutters, rubbing his sweaty palms against his jeans as he sits on the couch. \u201cUm, I\u2019m really sorry for everything that happened, in the past, y\u2019know? \u2018m sure that left a horrible impression of me, and \u2018m incredibly sorry for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, we understand how hard it all must be \u2013 having your privacy invaded at all times, having a public light shown on your life \u2013 and we understand that mistakes are made, and <i>things happen</i>. Y/M/N and I split apart for six months, in our early dating years \u2013 it doesn\u2019t make you a horrible person. Y/N is a great judge of character, and she has forgiven you, so, we are all okay; alright?\u201d your father reassures, his lips pursing together as he leans forward, his hands set on his thighs as he pays close attention to the young man sitting nervously in front of him.</p><p>\u201cUh, alright, yeah; really appreciate that, more than you know,\u201d he gulps, his nerves beginning to settle in his stomach as he matches his stare with your father\u2019s \u2013 he could tell that your father wasn\u2019t lying with his words, he truly meant that <i>everything</i> was and would be alright \u2013 and he felt comforted and secure. \u201c\u2019m really grateful that you\u2019ve welcomed me as much as you have \u2013 it\u2019s not every day that you have that, and I\u2019m grateful you and Y/M/N have me in your home for occasions, like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, you\u2019re part of the family,\u201d he grins, patting his knee, his figure leaning back in his lounger as he continues their conversation. \u201cOf course, you\u2019re invited \u2013 you\u2019re always welcome, here.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019m happy to be here,\u201d Harry opens, his demeanour shifting from anxious to steady, his comfort and loved welcome making his mind soothe and his personality to shine through his words and behaviours. \u201cHate being away from Y/N for so long. It\u2019s truly the worst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen Y/N so happy, in weeks,\u201d your father confesses, peeking around the walkway to spot you and your sister chatting aimlessly with your mother. \u201cIt\u2019s whenever you\u2019re here \u2013 when you\u2019re here, she\u2019s the happiest she\u2019s even been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHate doing long distance with her,\u201d he whispers, his ears perking as he hears your laughter, the echoed noise bouncing off the walls making his heart flutter \u2013 as clich\u00e9 as he could sound, your laugh gave him butterflies, \u201cbut, I\u2019d fly thousands of miles to be with her if it meant she would be happy and smiling. \u00a0She deserves nothing but the best. She means the world to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe, <i>everyone</i>, can see how much you love her, Harry. We, <i>I</i>, am so grateful that she\u2019s found someone like you. She, like you said, deserves <i>nothing</i> but the best, and I\u2019m happy she\u2019s found that in such a fine, young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I ask you a question?\u201d</p><p>His nerves crawled into his throat and he thought he could be sick. He didn\u2019t have any gauge of how your father\u2019s reaction would be. He could only hope he wouldn\u2019t be shoved out of your parents\u2019 home and told to never come back. He silently prayed that your father would be happy instead of angry, be overjoyed instead of upset.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t wait any longer.</p><p>\u201cMhm,\u201d your father nods, a smile tugging at his lips as he anticipates the question that is about be uttered from your boyfriend\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cI love Y/N, I love her with my whole heart. Want to give her the world, I do.\u201d Harry is sure of this; out of all of the things he could possibly do in his lifetime, he would give everything to be able to give you the world every single day. \u201cUm, I wanted to ask you, if -.\u201d</p><p>Harry coughs, <i>physically</i> chokes on his own words, because of his nerves. His palms are sweating, his mouth is dry, and his feet are tingling; he\u2019s not felt this nervous since his audition five years ago.</p><p>\u201cDo I have your blessing to ask Y/N to marry me?\u201d he slurs, his words meshing together as he rushes his question out of his mouth. His brain has never felt so overwhelmed.</p><p>His heart aches as he carefully observes your father\u2019s features. He would much rather a \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 answer than having to sit and wait on a response, especially with such a heavy question. Harry\u2019s future with you, <i>your</i> future, is dependent on this one response, one word, and he could physically feel his stomach churn.</p><p>\u201cShe deserves everything, and I want to do my absolute best to give that to her. Want to spend my entire life loving her, I really do.\u201d His voice quiets as he hears the quiet humming of the boiling water and oven timers \u2013 dinner must be ready, which means you would be coming at any moment to gather him and your father to the table; he needed your father\u2019s answer <i>soon</i> or he would combust. \u201c\u2018m quite traditional, in this way, and I want to have your blessing. Y/D/N, \u2018m wanting to propose quite soon \u2013 Y/N and I talk about this often, and we\u2019re growing really exhausted of the long distance. We agreed that we wouldn\u2019t make decisions about moving until we\u2019re engaged, but we\u2019re both growing antsy. \u2018m lookin\u2019 at rings, and my father has been helping me choose a jeweller. With all of that, I would like to have your permission, your blessing, before I ask her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, are you ready to eat?\u201d you chirp, your fingertips curled around the doorframe, your lips perked in a soft smile as you admire your father and boyfriend talking perfectly together (your worst nightmare would have been for your father to hate the <i>love of your life</i> \u2013 you couldn\u2019t possibly imagine that scenario). \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe are, sweetheart,\u201d your father smiles, pushing his lounger into the upright position, his head nodding towards the dining room where your family would all be eating that evening. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll set your plates. Bub, do you want me to make yours?\u201d you ask innocently, oblivious to the intensity of the conversation that had been lingering in the lounge only minutes before.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Harry smiles softly, shaking his head with a chuckle as you grin happily, turning on your heel with assurance as you disappear into the kitchen \u2013 he adored that about you; the <i>littlest</i> things made you happy. \u201cThank you, Sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry?\u201d you father calls, standing on his feet, his tall figure standing in front of Harry, his palm facing flat on his shoulder, their eyes matching stare as their heights match.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Harry mutters, his heart overflowing with love and pure joy as your father grins, his features excited and happy as his palm pats his cheek lovingly \u2013 Harry knew his answer, he didn\u2019t need to verbally say it, but he is <i>so</i> happy that he is.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the family, Son.\u201d</p>",

He sighs in defeat, his heart broken as he feels your fingers squeeze his hip, your face hiding in his chest, the overwhelming sounds of questions about your relationship and your future being yelled and screamed as you walk your path to your spot in the garage. He hates it.</p><p>Harry breathes in deeply as you click your car\u2019s alarm, the backseat door pulling open to toss his bags on the floor, your figure settling in the driver\u2019s seat as he climbs into the passenger seat. He is <i>tired</i> \u2013 tired of how the media portrays your relationship, how you are burdened with questions about being with him and how you could forgive him. He rubs his palms against his cheeks in frustration, his mind wandering to questions he shouldn\u2019t be thinking about \u2013 because you would only deny what he would be thinking.</p><p>\u201cSweet?\u201d he murmurs, his fingertips toying with his rings as he awaits your response, his heart skipping as you smile at him innocently.</p><p>\u201cBub?\u201d you giggle, lacing your fingertips through his and squeezing lightly.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel like you have to be with me?

He does this every so often \u2013 worries about your judgement and decision of dating him \u2013 especially when reporters are surrounding you with questions regarding your relationship. His features are tired and worn, and worry is furrowing his brows together. \u201cWhy would you think I don\u2019t want to be with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d he mutters, his lips pursing as you softly cup his cheeks, his gaze matching yours, his eyes softening as you breathe deeply. \u201cWith everything that reporters and everyone online says, \u2018s jus\u2019 that I get worried that you\u2019ll feel as though you\u2019re bein\u2019 pressured into this, y\u2019a know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry Styles, how many times do I have to tell you how much I love you, hm?

He is his happiest with you \u2013 when you\u2019re complaining about your professors while you have a shower and he\u2019s brushing his teeth, or how you brush your fingers through his hair as he lays on your chest when you\u2019re in bed watching your favourite television programme, or how he can feel if you\u2019re not falling asleep and want to talk until early hours in the morning.</p><p>He loved every moment of it.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s coming to dinner tomorrow? \u2018s your brother and Hadley, Phoebe and her boyfriend, and your parents? \u2018s all who\u2019s coming, right?\u201d he wonders, propping his hands against your countertop, his smirk bright as you step outside of your shower, your eyes rolling dramatically as you spot your towel set beside him.</p><p>\u201cGive me <i>back</i> my towel, please and thank you,\u201d you huff, your lips curving into a smile as you reach for your set, your heart beating loudly as he kisses your cheek as you stand in front of his tall figure. \u201cOh, and, yes, <i>sort of</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018<i>sort of</i>\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, my family <i>will</i> be there, but there are a few more people that are coming, as well,\u201d you note, your lips pursing together as you step into your closet, desperately trying to avoid his conversation. He would start to panic \u2013 and the very last thing you would want is for him to have anxiety before having a full day with your family.</p><p>\u201cOkay, how many is a \u2018few\u2019?\u201d he presses, his hands touching the doorframe as he waits on your response. He was beginning to get anxious.</p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d you stutter, pulling a tattered tee shirt of his over your torso, your hair brushed and slicked across your back as you step outside of your wardrobe and begin walking into your bedroom, \u201cWe have to pick up Granny on our way in, Aunt Ella and Uncle Jay, Uncle Dave and Uncle Joe, and our cousins \u2013 but \u2018m not too sure who Mom invited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Christ,\u201d he grumbles, shuffling into your bedroom and laying dramatically on your duvet.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>His anxiety is written across his features, and your heart breaks for him.</p><p>\u201c\u2019m gon\u2019a be hated by everyone there, aren\u2019t I?\u201d he whispers, his palms covering his face as he heaves heavy breaths. He can feel his heart beating through his rib cage.</p><p>\u201cWhy would they hate you?\u201d you wonder, confusion spread across your features, your head shaking as you nudge his figure to sit on his bum, your tiny form settled between his thighs. \u201cHarry, I have never met <i>anyone</i> that has ever hated you with any inkling of their heart. Why would my family dislike you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I did the <i>one</i> <i>thing</i> I promised I would never do to you!\u201d he spits, his chin dipping onto his chest, his fingertips nudging into his eyes as he struggles to hold steady breaths. He doesn\u2019t want to match your stare. \u201cIt was everywhere \u2013 everyone knew, and everyone could see. I hurt you. I don\u2019t deserve to be liked by your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Bubby. C\u2019mon, look at me.\u201d Harry huffs in defeat, his eyes glossed with tears, his lips pursed in a line as he listens to you. \u201cHave I forgiven you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I love you?\u201d you ask, your palms cupping his cheeks, brushing your thumbs alongst his cheeks. His should know you love him - you tell him you love him in every other breath \u2013 especially when he was beginning to doubt or feel bad about what had happened before.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he sighs, blinking slowly, meeting your soft, blue eyes as you calm him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what <i>anyone</i> has to say. Do you understand me? Harry, you are everything to me, despite what anyone could ever have to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, it\u2019s your <i>family</i>. \u2018s reasonable as to why they wouldn\u2019t like me. It\u2019s horrible, too, because whenever an article about it pops up and crosses me, I can\u2019t stop thinking about what I did. I\u2019m sorry about it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, my <i>love</i>,\u201d you comfort, shaking your head as you settle on his thigh, his hands instinctively holding your thigh and waist, squeezing you tight. \u201cWe broke up, yeah, and my heart was broken for a while, I won\u2019t deny that.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019m sorry,\u201d he interrupts, kissing your collarbone as your arms wrap around his shoulders.</p><p>\u201c<i>But</i>, you are the one that makes my heart whole \u2013 that\u2019s why my heart broke, because I wasn\u2019t with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurt me, <i>a lot</i>, when I couldn\u2019t be with you,\u201d he confesses, closing his eyes as you hug him tightly.</p><p>\u201cHarry, you make my heart happy. Do you know that? Bub, you make me so happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019s all I want, always \u2013 to make you happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, baby, you do,\u201d you state confidently, kissing his lips, your smile breaking apart your kiss you. \u201cVery happy. I love you, and \u2018m very happy and feel very loved by you, always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he smiles, squeezing your waist as you stand, holding his hands, laughing loudly as you struggle to pull him off of your mattress.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to do, Sweet?\u201d he chuckles, wrapping his arms around your waist and pulling you onto him, your smile making his heart swell, your nose nudged against his and he holds you close to him.</p><p>\u201c\u2019m trying to have you cuddle me.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019m cuddling you, right now, aren\u2019t I?\u201d he smirks; he knows that he\u2019s pushing your buttons, but he loves to see you playfully flustered, especially when you\u2019re having a good night.</p><p>\u201cPain in my ass, y\u2019know that?\u201d you moan, rolling your eyes as you brush his hair out of his face.</p><p>\u201cHm, but you love me,\u201d he grins, kissing you as you smile, your hearts beating against each other as he holds you close to his chest.</p><p>\u201cI do, I really do.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Harry straightens his top, readjusting the buttons he\u2019s done four times, questioning his decision to leave two slots unbuttoned, worried he would give the wrong impression with his appearance with your family. He runs his fingers through his hair, patting his cheeks, his fingers fumbling with his jeans buttons as he sticks his feet inside his favourite pair of boots. He smiles, a chuckle leaving his lips as he spots you laying on your mattress in defeat, your torso naked from your dress, only clothes in a bralette and lace panties he had a keen liking of.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, you\u2019re gon\u2019a make us late to pick up <i>Granny</i>,\u201d he smirks, coaxing your body off of your comforter, his laugh rumbling his chest as you knock your forehead against his collarbone. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have any clue where my dress is,\u201d you groan, eyelashes fluttering closes as he kisses your temple. \u201cWe have to leave in ten minutes and \u2018m still naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind it,\u201d he shrugs, his laugh echoing around the bedroom, as you smack his arm. \u201cPut your dress up in your washroom. Wanted to iron it for you whilst you were doing your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry Styles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d he grins, his dimple indenting his cheek as he kisses your temple, patting your bum as you begin to walk out of your bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too. Go on, go get dressed so we can leave. \u2018m not picking your grandmother up late. I\u2019ll leave without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, you will,\u201d you smirk, your feet bouncing on your floorboards as you walk into your washroom, your heart warm as you spot your dress hanging up neatly on the door, a note sticking on the wood:</p><p><i>I love you, Sweet. Happy Thanksgiving</i>. <i>x</i></p><p>He walks around your bedroom, stepping in front of your mirror and beginning to grab his wallet and keys from your dresser, his pockets beginning to fill as his phone is slipped into his jeans. He smiles as he feels your arms wrap around his waist, your lips touching his neck as you hug him, your blushed cheeks tight in a smile as he nudges you in front of him, his hands holding you in front of him, his eyes taking in your appearance. \u201cBeautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBub, <i>stop it</i>.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t stop complimenting you \u2013 he wanted you to truly know how beautiful you are, especially to him \u2013 you knew that very well, no matter how many times you told him to.</p><p>\u201c\u2019s this okay? Haven\u2019t been to a Thanksgiving Dinner with my girl\u2019s family, ever. Don\u2019t really know how to dress for the occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay \u2018my girl\u2019 again,\u201d you smile, brushing your palms over his collarbone, your lips touching his jaw softly.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he questions, kissing you sweetly as your arms wrap around his shoulders.</p><p>\u201c<i>Because</i>, \u2018s the sweetest thing; you give me butterflies when you say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope you know you\u2019re <i>my girl</i> always,\u201d Harry smiles, kissing your cheek as he hugs you tight.</p><p>\u201cBetter be,\u201d you wink, squeezing him close, your hands beginning to grab your purse and pop your essentials inside, your eyes traveling around your bedroom to ensure you wouldn\u2019t forget anything.</p><p>\u201cDo I look alright? Will I make a good impression?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBub, you make the <i>best</i> impressions,\u201d you smile widely, lacing your fingertips through his as you begin to walk out of your apartment.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he says softly, holding your hand as you step into your car, your purse and his belongings sitting in the console, his lips pursing as you smile.</p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes meet yours as he begins to close the door, hesitating before walking to his driver\u2019s seat and sliding inside, and you can see the nervousness overwhelming him. He is confident, a strong character, but he was anxious. He wanted his first impression to be perfect, to be liked by everyone and be loved by your parents.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d you emphasise, your lips touching his hand, your thumb rubbing his palm comfortingly, your heart softening as he smiles at you.</p><p>Harry would be loved by everyone. He always is.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cGranny? We\u2019re here!\u201d you shout, stepping inside her home and peeking around her kitchen to spot her kitchen scattered with desserts to bring with her to your parent\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cHi, sweetheart! I\u2019ll be right out!\u201d she calls, her dainty voice echoing off her walls.</p><p>Harry walks deeper into her foyer, his grin aching his cheeks as he carefully admires every picture of you structured on her wall. He envisioned how many pictures your mother and father have, how many he would be able to go through and tease you for, which ones from your adolescent and teenage years that would be his favourites, which school pictures he would point out, which candid he would see of you laughing that make his heart soar.</p><p>\u201cSweet, look at you,\u201d Harry smirks, his fingertip touching your grandmother\u2019s frame. \u201cCute baby, you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut your mouth, \u2019ve seen your naked baby pictures,\u201d you stern, your eyes rolling as he chuckles, your teeth biting your lip in an (awful) attempt to hide your smile. He opens his arms wide, his chest heaving a heavy breath as you wrap your arms around his waist, his lips kissing your hair, your cheek laying against his heart as you stand close to him.</p><p>\u201cHave seen me naked as an adult, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry!\u201d you gasp, stepping backwards, his hands holding yours as he laughs loudly, your jaw agape as you stare at him in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cHow are you, lovey? Oh! You must be Harry,\u201d your grandmother chirps, stepping into the foyer, her smile bright as she kisses your cheek, her attention averting to Harry as he stands shyly behind you.</p><p>\u201cHi, that\u2019s me,\u201d he chuckles, his eyebrows raising in surprise as she embraces him, her tiny figure surrounded by him as he hugs her.</p><p>\u201cHarry, I\u2019m Granny. It\u2019s nice to finally meet you!\u201d she grins, her hands holding his lightly as she steps back, her smirk making you blush as she nods excitedly.</p><p>\u201cSame to you,\u201d he smiles warmly, his anxiety beginning to deflate as he listens to her whispers of approval and praise.</p><p>\u201cVery nice, honey bee,\u201d she winks, squeezing your arm with a smile, pretending to whisper. \u201cHe\u2019s handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGranny, shh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould marry him, you\u2019ll have beautiful babies,\u201d Granny giggles, patting your cheek as she begins gathering her purse and desserts.</p><p>\u201cGranny!\u201d you squeak, shaking your head, your mouth agape as you listen to your <i>boyfriend</i> and your <i>grandmother</i> talk about marriage.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me think about it, Granny.\u201d Harry smiles <i>so </i>widely \u2013 quite possibly the greatest smile you have ever seen on his features \u2013 and your heart swells. He is becoming surer of himself, more <i>Harry</i>.</p><p>\u201c\u2019m waiting for the day I can say, \u2018<i>I told you so</i>\u2019!\u201d she chimes, stepping outside of her home behind you, closing and locking her front door, happily following her paved walkway to get into your car.</p><p>He smiles at you, wrapping his arm around your shoulder and kissing your temple, his voice rasped and low when he whispers, \u201c\u2019m excited for the day she says, \u2018<i>I told you so\u2019</i>, too.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>His heart is warm and his mind soothed as he steps into your parent\u2019s house. He is comfortable there; your family had welcomed him with love every time he stepped foot inside their foyer, and he knew he wouldn\u2019t be expected to be a publicised version of himself; with your family, he was himself \u2013 his natural, funny, confident, loving self \u2013 and he was so appreciative of their acceptance and kindness.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d Harry shouts, his heart warming as you grin, your arms wrapping around and hugging his waist tightly as he kisses your hair.</p><p>\u201cHarry! We are so happy you made it. Come in, come in,\u201d your mother grins, embracing Harry lightly, her hands rubbing against her apron as she kisses your cheek, her full attention drawn to him, \u201cHow was your flight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Y/M/N,\u201d he grins, kissing your mother\u2019s cheek sweetly, following her path as she perks her ears to the cooking timer. She bustles into their kitchen, her attention shifting focus as she holds her oven mitts and pulls the turkey out of the oven. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t too bad, thank you for asking. Originally, I wasn\u2019t set to fly in until next week, but when Y/N called and asked if I wanted to celebrate with you, I booked the first red-eye out of Mexico City from the Press Conference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, please, you can call me \u2018Mom\u2019 like the whole lot of \u2018em do,\u201d she hums, her heart warm as she admires how he <i>smiles</i> at you. She could see how much he loved you. \u201cShe told us! We are <i>so</i> happy you could be with us, today. Y/N told us you were flying in yesterday and to set a place, and the whole family has been talking about you coming \u2013 especially Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Stop</i>,\u201d you blush, hiding your face in your palms as you lean against your mother\u2019s counter.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s fine, sweetheart. Harry must know you talk about him a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Sweet \u2013 tell me how much you talk about me,\u201d he smirks, wrapping his arms around your waist, his lips touching your cheek softly, his heart softening as you turn in his arms, crossing your arms around his shoulders, kissing his lips with a smile.</p><p>Harry laughs loudly, his heart warm and swollen as she listens to your mother talk, revealing how you talk about him and how happy his coming had made you. He smiled, closing his eyes as you squeeze his hips.</p><p>\u201cGod, you are <i>all</i> feeding his ego, right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid someone say <i>whipped</i>,\u201d James snorts, his daughter propped on his hip, his wife talking mindlessly with Phoebe. He chuckles as you smack his arm, his hands placing his daughter in your hold as she reaches for you.</p><p>\u201c<i>Shut up</i>!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I help in any way, <i>Mom</i>?\u201d he smiles, his cheeks aching as he grins at your niece, her laughter making his heart warm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright! Go into the living room. Y/D/N has a game on \u2013 I\u2019m not too sure which one, but he\u2019ll be very happy to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he nods, his smile etched into his features as he kisses your cheek, his heart beating anxiously as he spots your father, his hand propped with a beer, his nervousness spiking, \u201cthank you, again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d your father greets, standing onto his feet and hugging him warmly, \u201chow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019m good, how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright! We have the family together, today. It\u2019s always a great day when that happens,\u201d he smiles brightly, settling in his lounger and turning the television\u2019s volume down.</p><p>\u201c\u2019m grateful you invited me,\u201d Harry stutters, rubbing his sweaty palms against his jeans as he sits on the couch. \u201cUm, I\u2019m really sorry for everything that happened, in the past, y\u2019know? \u2018m sure that left a horrible impression of me, and \u2018m incredibly sorry for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, we understand how hard it all must be \u2013 having your privacy invaded at all times, having a public light shown on your life \u2013 and we understand that mistakes are made, and <i>things happen</i>. Y/M/N and I split apart for six months, in our early dating years \u2013 it doesn\u2019t make you a horrible person. Y/N is a great judge of character, and she has forgiven you, so, we are all okay; alright?\u201d your father reassures, his lips pursing together as he leans forward, his hands set on his thighs as he pays close attention to the young man sitting nervously in front of him.</p><p>\u201cUh, alright, yeah; really appreciate that, more than you know,\u201d he gulps, his nerves beginning to settle in his stomach as he matches his stare with your father\u2019s \u2013 he could tell that your father wasn\u2019t lying with his words, he truly meant that <i>everything</i> was and would be alright \u2013 and he felt comforted and secure. \u201c\u2019m really grateful that you\u2019ve welcomed me as much as you have \u2013 it\u2019s not every day that you have that, and I\u2019m grateful you and Y/M/N have me in your home for occasions, like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, you\u2019re part of the family,\u201d he grins, patting his knee, his figure leaning back in his lounger as he continues their conversation. \u201cOf course, you\u2019re invited \u2013 you\u2019re always welcome, here.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019m happy to be here,\u201d Harry opens, his demeanour shifting from anxious to steady, his comfort and loved welcome making his mind soothe and his personality to shine through his words and behaviours. \u201cHate being away from Y/N for so long. It\u2019s truly the worst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen Y/N so happy, in weeks,\u201d your father confesses, peeking around the walkway to spot you and your sister chatting aimlessly with your mother. \u201cIt\u2019s whenever you\u2019re here \u2013 when you\u2019re here, she\u2019s the happiest she\u2019s even been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHate doing long distance with her,\u201d he whispers, his ears perking as he hears your laughter, the echoed noise bouncing off the walls making his heart flutter \u2013 as clich\u00e9 as he could sound, your laugh gave him butterflies, \u201cbut, I\u2019d fly thousands of miles to be with her if it meant she would be happy and smiling. \u00a0She deserves nothing but the best. She means the world to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe, <i>everyone</i>, can see how much you love her, Harry. We, <i>I</i>, am so grateful that she\u2019s found someone like you. She, like you said, deserves <i>nothing</i> but the best, and I\u2019m happy she\u2019s found that in such a fine, young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I ask you a question?\u201d</p><p>His nerves crawled into his throat and he thought he could be sick. He didn\u2019t have any gauge of how your father\u2019s reaction would be. He could only hope he wouldn\u2019t be shoved out of your parents\u2019 home and told to never come back. He silently prayed that your father would be happy instead of angry, be overjoyed instead of upset.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t wait any longer.</p><p>\u201cMhm,\u201d your father nods, a smile tugging at his lips as he anticipates the question that is about be uttered from your boyfriend\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cI love Y/N, I love her with my whole heart. Want to give her the world, I do.\u201d Harry is sure of this; out of all of the things he could possibly do in his lifetime, he would give everything to be able to give you the world every single day. \u201cUm, I wanted to ask you, if -.\u201d</p><p>Harry coughs, <i>physically</i> chokes on his own words, because of his nerves. His palms are sweating, his mouth is dry, and his feet are tingling; he\u2019s not felt this nervous since his audition five years ago.</p><p>\u201cDo I have your blessing to ask Y/N to marry me?\u201d he slurs, his words meshing together as he rushes his question out of his mouth. His brain has never felt so overwhelmed.</p><p>His heart aches as he carefully observes your father\u2019s features. He would much rather a \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 answer than having to sit and wait on a response, especially with such a heavy question. Harry\u2019s future with you, <i>your</i> future, is dependent on this one response, one word, and he could physically feel his stomach churn.</p><p>\u201cShe deserves everything, and I want to do my absolute best to give that to her. Want to spend my entire life loving her, I really do.\u201d His voice quiets as he hears the quiet humming of the boiling water and oven timers \u2013 dinner must be ready, which means you would be coming at any moment to gather him and your father to the table; he needed your father\u2019s answer <i>soon</i> or he would combust. \u201c\u2018m quite traditional, in this way, and I want to have your blessing. Y/D/N, \u2018m wanting to propose quite soon \u2013 Y/N and I talk about this often, and we\u2019re growing really exhausted of the long distance. We agreed that we wouldn\u2019t make decisions about moving until we\u2019re engaged, but we\u2019re both growing antsy. \u2018m lookin\u2019 at rings, and my father has been helping me choose a jeweller. With all of that, I would like to have your permission, your blessing, before I ask her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, are you ready to eat?\u201d you chirp, your fingertips curled around the doorframe, your lips perked in a soft smile as you admire your father and boyfriend talking perfectly together (your worst nightmare would have been for your father to hate the <i>love of your life</i> \u2013 you couldn\u2019t possibly imagine that scenario). \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe are, sweetheart,\u201d your father smiles, pushing his lounger into the upright position, his head nodding towards the dining room where your family would all be eating that evening. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll set your plates. Bub, do you want me to make yours?\u201d you ask innocently, oblivious to the intensity of the conversation that had been lingering in the lounge only minutes before.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Harry smiles softly, shaking his head with a chuckle as you grin happily, turning on your heel with assurance as you disappear into the kitchen \u2013 he adored that about you; the <i>littlest</i> things made you happy. \u201cThank you, Sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry?\u201d you father calls, standing on his feet, his tall figure standing in front of Harry, his palm facing flat on his shoulder, their eyes matching stare as their heights match.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Harry mutters, his heart overflowing with love and pure joy as your father grins, his features excited and happy as his palm pats his cheek lovingly \u2013 Harry knew his answer, he didn\u2019t need to verbally say it, but he is <i>so</i> happy that he is.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the family, Son.\u201d</p></p>",

He would take every moment with you he could possibly have \u2013 hugging you, kissing you, touching you, laughing with you, cuddling you; simply<i> </i>having you with him made him happy.</p><p>He would give everything to make you happy and living thousands of miles away wasn\u2019t doing anything of the sort.</p><p>\u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>He picks his duffle up, setting it on his shoulder, his arm wrapping around you, pulling you into his warmth, his lips touching your hair, your fingertips holding his waist as you begin walking towards your car, his sunglasses pulled onto his nose and your hat covering your face as you avoid the flashing lights. He sighs in defeat, his heart broken as he feels your fingers squeeze his hip, your face hiding in his chest, the overwhelming sounds of questions about your relationship and your future being yelled and screamed as you walk your path to your spot in the garage. He hates it.</p><p>Harry breathes in deeply as you click your car\u2019s alarm, the backseat door pulling open to toss his bags on the floor, your figure settling in the driver\u2019s seat as he climbs into the passenger seat. He is <i>tired</i> \u2013 tired of how the media portrays your relationship, how you are burdened with questions about being with him and how you could forgive him. He rubs his palms against his cheeks in frustration, his mind wandering to questions he shouldn\u2019t be thinking about \u2013 because you would only deny what he would be thinking.</p><p>\u201cSweet?\u201d he murmurs, his fingertips toying with his rings as he awaits your response, his heart skipping as you smile at him innocently.</p><p>\u201cBub?\u201d you giggle, lacing your fingertips through his and squeezing lightly.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel like you have to be with me? Don\u2019t have to feel like that, ever. \u2018s not like we\u2019re engaged or somethin\u2019, right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, why on earth would you ask me that?\u201d you huff, shaking your head as you pull into your apartment\u2019s garage, your foot heavy on the break as you shift the gear into park, your torso turning to face your boyfriend, your eyes matching his stare as you trace the features on his face. He does this every so often \u2013 worries about your judgement and decision of dating him \u2013 especially when reporters are surrounding you with questions regarding your relationship. His features are tired and worn, and worry is furrowing his brows together. \u201cWhy would you think I don\u2019t want to be with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d he mutters, his lips pursing as you softly cup his cheeks, his gaze matching yours, his eyes softening as you breathe deeply. \u201cWith everything that reporters and everyone online says, \u2018s jus\u2019 that I get worried that you\u2019ll feel as though you\u2019re bein\u2019 pressured into this, y\u2019a know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry Styles, how many times do I have to tell you how much I love you, hm? I love you and becoming your girlfriend is the very best thing that has ever happened to me, y\u2019a know that? How could I not want you in my life? <i>I</i> <i>love you</i>, always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, always.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>He smiled as you hummed to yourself, his toothbrush hanging limply between his lips as he grabs a towel to wipe his lips and dry his face, his hair pulled into a bun, his chest bare as his boxers cling to his hips, his clothes tossed into your laundry bin once he stepped into your shower when you settled inside your home. He is his happiest with you \u2013 when you\u2019re complaining about your professors while you have a shower and he\u2019s brushing his teeth, or how you brush your fingers through his hair as he lays on your chest when you\u2019re in bed watching your favourite television programme, or how he can feel if you\u2019re not falling asleep and want to talk until early hours in the morning.</p><p>He loved every moment of it.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s coming to dinner tomorrow? \u2018s your brother and Hadley, Phoebe and her boyfriend, and your parents? \u2018s all who\u2019s coming, right?\u201d he wonders, propping his hands against your countertop, his smirk bright as you step outside of your shower, your eyes rolling dramatically as you spot your towel set beside him.</p><p>\u201cGive me <i>back</i> my towel, please and thank you,\u201d you huff, your lips curving into a smile as you reach for your set, your heart beating loudly as he kisses your cheek as you stand in front of his tall figure. \u201cOh, and, yes, <i>sort of</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018<i>sort of</i>\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, my family <i>will</i> be there, but there are a few more people that are coming, as well,\u201d you note, your lips pursing together as you step into your closet, desperately trying to avoid his conversation. He would start to panic \u2013 and the very last thing you would want is for him to have anxiety before having a full day with your family.</p><p>\u201cOkay, how many is a \u2018few\u2019?\u201d he presses, his hands touching the doorframe as he waits on your response. He was beginning to get anxious.</p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d you stutter, pulling a tattered tee shirt of his over your torso, your hair brushed and slicked across your back as you step outside of your wardrobe and begin walking into your bedroom, \u201cWe have to pick up Granny on our way in, Aunt Ella and Uncle Jay, Uncle Dave and Uncle Joe, and our cousins \u2013 but \u2018m not too sure who Mom invited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Christ,\u201d he grumbles, shuffling into your bedroom and laying dramatically on your duvet.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>His anxiety is written across his features, and your heart breaks for him.</p><p>\u201c\u2019m gon\u2019a be hated by everyone there, aren\u2019t I?\u201d he whispers, his palms covering his face as he heaves heavy breaths. He can feel his heart beating through his rib cage.</p><p>\u201cWhy would they hate you?\u201d you wonder, confusion spread across your features, your head shaking as you nudge his figure to sit on his bum, your tiny form settled between his thighs. \u201cHarry, I have never met <i>anyone</i> that has ever hated you with any inkling of their heart. Why would my family dislike you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I did the <i>one</i> <i>thing</i> I promised I would never do to you!\u201d he spits, his chin dipping onto his chest, his fingertips nudging into his eyes as he struggles to hold steady breaths. He doesn\u2019t want to match your stare. \u201cIt was everywhere \u2013 everyone knew, and everyone could see. I hurt you. I don\u2019t deserve to be liked by your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Bubby. C\u2019mon, look at me.\u201d Harry huffs in defeat, his eyes glossed with tears, his lips pursed in a line as he listens to you. \u201cHave I forgiven you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I love you?\u201d you ask, your palms cupping his cheeks, brushing your thumbs alongst his cheeks. His should know you love him - you tell him you love him in every other breath \u2013 especially when he was beginning to doubt or feel bad about what had happened before.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he sighs, blinking slowly, meeting your soft, blue eyes as you calm him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what <i>anyone</i> has to say. Do you understand me? Harry, you are everything to me, despite what anyone could ever have to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, it\u2019s your <i>family</i>. \u2018s reasonable as to why they wouldn\u2019t like me. It\u2019s horrible, too, because whenever an article about it pops up and crosses me, I can\u2019t stop thinking about what I did. I\u2019m sorry about it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, my <i>love</i>,\u201d you comfort, shaking your head as you settle on his thigh, his hands instinctively holding your thigh and waist, squeezing you tight. \u201cWe broke up, yeah, and my heart was broken for a while, I won\u2019t deny that.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019m sorry,\u201d he interrupts, kissing your collarbone as your arms wrap around his shoulders.</p><p>\u201c<i>But</i>, you are the one that makes my heart whole \u2013 that\u2019s why my heart broke, because I wasn\u2019t with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurt me, <i>a lot</i>, when I couldn\u2019t be with you,\u201d he confesses, closing his eyes as you hug him tightly.</p><p>\u201cHarry, you make my heart happy. Do you know that? Bub, you make me so happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019s all I want, always \u2013 to make you happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, baby, you do,\u201d you state confidently, kissing his lips, your smile breaking apart your kiss you. \u201cVery happy. I love you, and \u2018m very happy and feel very loved by you, always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he smiles, squeezing your waist as you stand, holding his hands, laughing loudly as you struggle to pull him off of your mattress.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to do, Sweet?\u201d he chuckles, wrapping his arms around your waist and pulling you onto him, your smile making his heart swell, your nose nudged against his and he holds you close to him.</p><p>\u201c\u2019m trying to have you cuddle me.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019m cuddling you, right now, aren\u2019t I?\u201d he smirks; he knows that he\u2019s pushing your buttons, but he loves to see you playfully flustered, especially when you\u2019re having a good night.</p><p>\u201cPain in my ass, y\u2019know that?\u201d you moan, rolling your eyes as you brush his hair out of his face.</p><p>\u201cHm, but you love me,\u201d he grins, kissing you as you smile, your hearts beating against each other as he holds you close to his chest.</p><p>\u201cI do, I really do.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Harry straightens his top, readjusting the buttons he\u2019s done four times, questioning his decision to leave two slots unbuttoned, worried he would give the wrong impression with his appearance with your family. He runs his fingers through his hair, patting his cheeks, his fingers fumbling with his jeans buttons as he sticks his feet inside his favourite pair of boots. He smiles, a chuckle leaving his lips as he spots you laying on your mattress in defeat, your torso naked from your dress, only clothes in a bralette and lace panties he had a keen liking of.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, you\u2019re gon\u2019a make us late to pick up <i>Granny</i>,\u201d he smirks, coaxing your body off of your comforter, his laugh rumbling his chest as you knock your forehead against his collarbone. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have any clue where my dress is,\u201d you groan, eyelashes fluttering closes as he kisses your temple. \u201cWe have to leave in ten minutes and \u2018m still naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind it,\u201d he shrugs, his laugh echoing around the bedroom, as you smack his arm. \u201cPut your dress up in your washroom. Wanted to iron it for you whilst you were doing your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry Styles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d he grins, his dimple indenting his cheek as he kisses your temple, patting your bum as you begin to walk out of your bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too. Go on, go get dressed so we can leave. \u2018m not picking your grandmother up late. I\u2019ll leave without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, you will,\u201d you smirk, your feet bouncing on your floorboards as you walk into your washroom, your heart warm as you spot your dress hanging up neatly on the door, a note sticking on the wood:</p><p><i>I love you, Sweet. Happy Thanksgiving</i>. <i>x</i></p><p>He walks around your bedroom, stepping in front of your mirror and beginning to grab his wallet and keys from your dresser, his pockets beginning to fill as his phone is slipped into his jeans. He smiles as he feels your arms wrap around his waist, your lips touching his neck as you hug him, your blushed cheeks tight in a smile as he nudges you in front of him, his hands holding you in front of him, his eyes taking in your appearance. \u201cBeautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBub, <i>stop it</i>.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t stop complimenting you \u2013 he wanted you to truly know how beautiful you are, especially to him \u2013 you knew that very well, no matter how many times you told him to.</p><p>\u201c\u2019s this okay? Haven\u2019t been to a Thanksgiving Dinner with my girl\u2019s family, ever. Don\u2019t really know how to dress for the occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay \u2018my girl\u2019 again,\u201d you smile, brushing your palms over his collarbone, your lips touching his jaw softly.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he questions, kissing you sweetly as your arms wrap around his shoulders.</p><p>\u201c<i>Because</i>, \u2018s the sweetest thing; you give me butterflies when you say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope you know you\u2019re <i>my girl</i> always,\u201d Harry smiles, kissing your cheek as he hugs you tight.</p><p>\u201cBetter be,\u201d you wink, squeezing him close, your hands beginning to grab your purse and pop your essentials inside, your eyes traveling around your bedroom to ensure you wouldn\u2019t forget anything.</p><p>\u201cDo I look alright? Will I make a good impression?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBub, you make the <i>best</i> impressions,\u201d you smile widely, lacing your fingertips through his as you begin to walk out of your apartment.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he says softly, holding your hand as you step into your car, your purse and his belongings sitting in the console, his lips pursing as you smile.</p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes meet yours as he begins to close the door, hesitating before walking to his driver\u2019s seat and sliding inside, and you can see the nervousness overwhelming him. He is confident, a strong character, but he was anxious. He wanted his first impression to be perfect, to be liked by everyone and be loved by your parents.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d you emphasise, your lips touching his hand, your thumb rubbing his palm comfortingly, your heart softening as he smiles at you.</p><p>Harry would be loved by everyone. He always is.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cGranny? We\u2019re here!\u201d you shout, stepping inside her home and peeking around her kitchen to spot her kitchen scattered with desserts to bring with her to your parent\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cHi, sweetheart! I\u2019ll be right out!\u201d she calls, her dainty voice echoing off her walls.</p><p>Harry walks deeper into her foyer, his grin aching his cheeks as he carefully admires every picture of you structured on her wall. He envisioned how many pictures your mother and father have, how many he would be able to go through and tease you for, which ones from your adolescent and teenage years that would be his favourites, which school pictures he would point out, which candid he would see of you laughing that make his heart soar.</p><p>\u201cSweet, look at you,\u201d Harry smirks, his fingertip touching your grandmother\u2019s frame. \u201cCute baby, you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut your mouth, \u2019ve seen your naked baby pictures,\u201d you stern, your eyes rolling as he chuckles, your teeth biting your lip in an (awful) attempt to hide your smile. He opens his arms wide, his chest heaving a heavy breath as you wrap your arms around his waist, his lips kissing your hair, your cheek laying against his heart as you stand close to him.</p><p>\u201cHave seen me naked as an adult, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry!\u201d you gasp, stepping backwards, his hands holding yours as he laughs loudly, your jaw agape as you stare at him in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cHow are you, lovey? Oh! You must be Harry,\u201d your grandmother chirps, stepping into the foyer, her smile bright as she kisses your cheek, her attention averting to Harry as he stands shyly behind you.</p><p>\u201cHi, that\u2019s me,\u201d he chuckles, his eyebrows raising in surprise as she embraces him, her tiny figure surrounded by him as he hugs her.</p><p>\u201cHarry, I\u2019m Granny. It\u2019s nice to finally meet you!\u201d she grins, her hands holding his lightly as she steps back, her smirk making you blush as she nods excitedly.</p><p>\u201cSame to you,\u201d he smiles warmly, his anxiety beginning to deflate as he listens to her whispers of approval and praise.</p><p>\u201cVery nice, honey bee,\u201d she winks, squeezing your arm with a smile, pretending to whisper. \u201cHe\u2019s handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGranny, shh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould marry him, you\u2019ll have beautiful babies,\u201d Granny giggles, patting your cheek as she begins gathering her purse and desserts.</p><p>\u201cGranny!\u201d you squeak, shaking your head, your mouth agape as you listen to your <i>boyfriend</i> and your <i>grandmother</i> talk about marriage.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me think about it, Granny.\u201d Harry smiles <i>so </i>widely \u2013 quite possibly the greatest smile you have ever seen on his features \u2013 and your heart swells. He is becoming surer of himself, more <i>Harry</i>.</p><p>\u201c\u2019m waiting for the day I can say, \u2018<i>I told you so</i>\u2019!\u201d she chimes, stepping outside of her home behind you, closing and locking her front door, happily following her paved walkway to get into your car.</p><p>He smiles at you, wrapping his arm around your shoulder and kissing your temple, his voice rasped and low when he whispers, \u201c\u2019m excited for the day she says, \u2018<i>I told you so\u2019</i>, too.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>His heart is warm and his mind soothed as he steps into your parent\u2019s house. He is comfortable there; your family had welcomed him with love every time he stepped foot inside their foyer, and he knew he wouldn\u2019t be expected to be a publicised version of himself; with your family, he was himself \u2013 his natural, funny, confident, loving self \u2013 and he was so appreciative of their acceptance and kindness.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d Harry shouts, his heart warming as you grin, your arms wrapping around and hugging his waist tightly as he kisses your hair.</p><p>\u201cHarry! We are so happy you made it. Come in, come in,\u201d your mother grins, embracing Harry lightly, her hands rubbing against her apron as she kisses your cheek, her full attention drawn to him, \u201cHow was your flight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Y/M/N,\u201d he grins, kissing your mother\u2019s cheek sweetly, following her path as she perks her ears to the cooking timer. She bustles into their kitchen, her attention shifting focus as she holds her oven mitts and pulls the turkey out of the oven. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t too bad, thank you for asking. Originally, I wasn\u2019t set to fly in until next week, but when Y/N called and asked if I wanted to celebrate with you, I booked the first red-eye out of Mexico City from the Press Conference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, please, you can call me \u2018Mom\u2019 like the whole lot of \u2018em do,\u201d she hums, her heart warm as she admires how he <i>smiles</i> at you. She could see how much he loved you. \u201cShe told us! We are <i>so</i> happy you could be with us, today. Y/N told us you were flying in yesterday and to set a place, and the whole family has been talking about you coming \u2013 especially Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Stop</i>,\u201d you blush, hiding your face in your palms as you lean against your mother\u2019s counter.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s fine, sweetheart. Harry must know you talk about him a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Sweet \u2013 tell me how much you talk about me,\u201d he smirks, wrapping his arms around your waist, his lips touching your cheek softly, his heart softening as you turn in his arms, crossing your arms around his shoulders, kissing his lips with a smile.</p><p>Harry laughs loudly, his heart warm and swollen as she listens to your mother talk, revealing how you talk about him and how happy his coming had made you. He smiled, closing his eyes as you squeeze his hips.</p><p>\u201cGod, you are <i>all</i> feeding his ego, right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid someone say <i>whipped</i>,\u201d James snorts, his daughter propped on his hip, his wife talking mindlessly with Phoebe. He chuckles as you smack his arm, his hands placing his daughter in your hold as she reaches for you.</p><p>\u201c<i>Shut up</i>!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I help in any way, <i>Mom</i>?\u201d he smiles, his cheeks aching as he grins at your niece, her laughter making his heart warm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright! Go into the living room. Y/D/N has a game on \u2013 I\u2019m not too sure which one, but he\u2019ll be very happy to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he nods, his smile etched into his features as he kisses your cheek, his heart beating anxiously as he spots your father, his hand propped with a beer, his nervousness spiking, \u201cthank you, again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d your father greets, standing onto his feet and hugging him warmly, \u201chow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019m good, how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright! We have the family together, today. It\u2019s always a great day when that happens,\u201d he smiles brightly, settling in his lounger and turning the television\u2019s volume down.</p><p>\u201c\u2019m grateful you invited me,\u201d Harry stutters, rubbing his sweaty palms against his jeans as he sits on the couch. \u201cUm, I\u2019m really sorry for everything that happened, in the past, y\u2019know? \u2018m sure that left a horrible impression of me, and \u2018m incredibly sorry for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, we understand how hard it all must be \u2013 having your privacy invaded at all times, having a public light shown on your life \u2013 and we understand that mistakes are made, and <i>things happen</i>. Y/M/N and I split apart for six months, in our early dating years \u2013 it doesn\u2019t make you a horrible person. Y/N is a great judge of character, and she has forgiven you, so, we are all okay; alright?\u201d your father reassures, his lips pursing together as he leans forward, his hands set on his thighs as he pays close attention to the young man sitting nervously in front of him.</p><p>\u201cUh, alright, yeah; really appreciate that, more than you know,\u201d he gulps, his nerves beginning to settle in his stomach as he matches his stare with your father\u2019s \u2013 he could tell that your father wasn\u2019t lying with his words, he truly meant that <i>everything</i> was and would be alright \u2013 and he felt comforted and secure. \u201c\u2019m really grateful that you\u2019ve welcomed me as much as you have \u2013 it\u2019s not every day that you have that, and I\u2019m grateful you and Y/M/N have me in your home for occasions, like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, you\u2019re part of the family,\u201d he grins, patting his knee, his figure leaning back in his lounger as he continues their conversation. \u201cOf course, you\u2019re invited \u2013 you\u2019re always welcome, here.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019m happy to be here,\u201d Harry opens, his demeanour shifting from anxious to steady, his comfort and loved welcome making his mind soothe and his personality to shine through his words and behaviours. \u201cHate being away from Y/N for so long. It\u2019s truly the worst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen Y/N so happy, in weeks,\u201d your father confesses, peeking around the walkway to spot you and your sister chatting aimlessly with your mother. \u201cIt\u2019s whenever you\u2019re here \u2013 when you\u2019re here, she\u2019s the happiest she\u2019s even been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHate doing long distance with her,\u201d he whispers, his ears perking as he hears your laughter, the echoed noise bouncing off the walls making his heart flutter \u2013 as clich\u00e9 as he could sound, your laugh gave him butterflies, \u201cbut, I\u2019d fly thousands of miles to be with her if it meant she would be happy and smiling. \u00a0She deserves nothing but the best. She means the world to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe, <i>everyone</i>, can see how much you love her, Harry. We, <i>I</i>, am so grateful that she\u2019s found someone like you. She, like you said, deserves <i>nothing</i> but the best, and I\u2019m happy she\u2019s found that in such a fine, young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I ask you a question?\u201d</p><p>His nerves crawled into his throat and he thought he could be sick. He didn\u2019t have any gauge of how your father\u2019s reaction would be. He could only hope he wouldn\u2019t be shoved out of your parents\u2019 home and told to never come back. He silently prayed that your father would be happy instead of angry, be overjoyed instead of upset.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t wait any longer.</p><p>\u201cMhm,\u201d your father nods, a smile tugging at his lips as he anticipates the question that is about be uttered from your boyfriend\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cI love Y/N, I love her with my whole heart. Want to give her the world, I do.\u201d Harry is sure of this; out of all of the things he could possibly do in his lifetime, he would give everything to be able to give you the world every single day. \u201cUm, I wanted to ask you, if -.\u201d</p><p>Harry coughs, <i>physically</i> chokes on his own words, because of his nerves. His palms are sweating, his mouth is dry, and his feet are tingling; he\u2019s not felt this nervous since his audition five years ago.</p><p>\u201cDo I have your blessing to ask Y/N to marry me?\u201d he slurs, his words meshing together as he rushes his question out of his mouth. His brain has never felt so overwhelmed.</p><p>His heart aches as he carefully observes your father\u2019s features. He would much rather a \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 answer than having to sit and wait on a response, especially with such a heavy question. Harry\u2019s future with you, <i>your</i> future, is dependent on this one response, one word, and he could physically feel his stomach churn.</p><p>\u201cShe deserves everything, and I want to do my absolute best to give that to her. Want to spend my entire life loving her, I really do.\u201d His voice quiets as he hears the quiet humming of the boiling water and oven timers \u2013 dinner must be ready, which means you would be coming at any moment to gather him and your father to the table; he needed your father\u2019s answer <i>soon</i> or he would combust. \u201c\u2018m quite traditional, in this way, and I want to have your blessing. Y/D/N, \u2018m wanting to propose quite soon \u2013 Y/N and I talk about this often, and we\u2019re growing really exhausted of the long distance. We agreed that we wouldn\u2019t make decisions about moving until we\u2019re engaged, but we\u2019re both growing antsy. \u2018m lookin\u2019 at rings, and my father has been helping me choose a jeweller. With all of that, I would like to have your permission, your blessing, before I ask her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, are you ready to eat?\u201d you chirp, your fingertips curled around the doorframe, your lips perked in a soft smile as you admire your father and boyfriend talking perfectly together (your worst nightmare would have been for your father to hate the <i>love of your life</i> \u2013 you couldn\u2019t possibly imagine that scenario). \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe are, sweetheart,\u201d your father smiles, pushing his lounger into the upright position, his head nodding towards the dining room where your family would all be eating that evening. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll set your plates. Bub, do you want me to make yours?\u201d you ask innocently, oblivious to the intensity of the conversation that had been lingering in the lounge only minutes before.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Harry smiles softly, shaking his head with a chuckle as you grin happily, turning on your heel with assurance as you disappear into the kitchen \u2013 he adored that about you; the <i>littlest</i> things made you happy. \u201cThank you, Sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry?\u201d you father calls, standing on his feet, his tall figure standing in front of Harry, his palm facing flat on his shoulder, their eyes matching stare as their heights match.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Harry mutters, his heart overflowing with love and pure joy as your father grins, his features excited and happy as his palm pats his cheek lovingly \u2013 Harry knew his answer, he didn\u2019t need to verbally say it, but he is <i>so</i> happy that he is.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the family, Son.\u201d</p></p>",

Can&rsquo;t wait until I don&rsquo;t have to say goodbye you; can&rsquo;t wait for that, &lsquo;cause &lsquo;m happiest whenever you&rsquo;re with me,&rdquo; he hums, kissing your temple, his nose nudged into your hair as he breathes in your scent.</p><p>He never wants to leave you. He would take every moment with you he could possibly have &ndash; hugging you, kissing you, touching you, laughing with you, cuddling you; simply<i> </i>having you with him made him happy.</p><p>He would give everything to make you happy and living thousands of miles away wasn&rsquo;t doing anything of the sort.</p><p>&ldquo;Soon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Soon.&rdquo;</p><p>He picks his duffle up, setting it on his shoulder, his arm wrapping around you, pulling you into his warmth, his lips touching your hair, your fingertips holding his waist as you begin walking towards your car, his sunglasses pulled onto his nose and your hat covering your face as you avoid the flashing lights. He sighs in defeat, his heart broken as he feels your fingers squeeze his hip, your face hiding in his chest, the overwhelming sounds of questions about your relationship and your future being yelled and screamed as you walk your path to your spot in the garage. He hates it.</p><p>Harry breathes in deeply as you click your car&rsquo;s alarm, the backseat door pulling open to toss his bags on the floor, your figure settling in the driver&rsquo;s seat as he climbs into the passenger seat. He is <i>tired</i> &ndash; tired of how the media portrays your relationship, how you are burdened with questions about being with him and how you could forgive him. He rubs his palms against his cheeks in frustration, his mind wandering to questions he shouldn&rsquo;t be thinking about &ndash; because you would only deny what he would be thinking.</p><p>&ldquo;Sweet?&rdquo; he murmurs, his fingertips toying with his rings as he awaits your response, his heart skipping as you smile at him innocently.</p><p>&ldquo;Bub?&rdquo; you giggle, lacing your fingertips through his and squeezing lightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you feel like you have to be with me? Don&rsquo;t have to feel like that, ever. &lsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re engaged or somethin&rsquo;, right now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, why on earth would you ask me that?&rdquo; you huff, shaking your head as you pull into your apartment&rsquo;s garage, your foot heavy on the break as you shift the gear into park, your torso turning to face your boyfriend, your eyes matching his stare as you trace the features on his face. He does this every so often &ndash; worries about your judgement and decision of dating him &ndash; especially when reporters are surrounding you with questions regarding your relationship. His features are tired and worn, and worry is furrowing his brows together. &ldquo;Why would you think I don&rsquo;t want to be with you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he mutters, his lips pursing as you softly cup his cheeks, his gaze matching yours, his eyes softening as you breathe deeply. &ldquo;With everything that reporters and everyone online says, &lsquo;s jus&rsquo; that I get worried that you&rsquo;ll feel as though you&rsquo;re bein&rsquo; pressured into this, y&rsquo;a know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry Styles, how many times do I have to tell you how much I love you, hm?

How could I not want you in my life? <i>I</i> <i>love you</i>, always.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, always.&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>He smiled as you hummed to yourself, his toothbrush hanging limply between his lips as he grabs a towel to wipe his lips and dry his face, his hair pulled into a bun, his chest bare as his boxers cling to his hips, his clothes tossed into your laundry bin once he stepped into your shower when you settled inside your home. He is his happiest with you &ndash; when you&rsquo;re complaining about your professors while you have a shower and he&rsquo;s brushing his teeth, or how you brush your fingers through his hair as he lays on your chest when you&rsquo;re in bed watching your favourite television programme, or how he can feel if you&rsquo;re not falling asleep and want to talk until early hours in the morning.</p><p>He loved every moment of it.</p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s coming to dinner tomorrow? &lsquo;s your brother and Hadley, Phoebe and her boyfriend, and your parents? &lsquo;s all who&rsquo;s coming, right?&rdquo; he wonders, propping his hands against your countertop, his smirk bright as you step outside of your shower, your eyes rolling dramatically as you spot your towel set beside him.</p><p>&ldquo;Give me <i>back</i> my towel, please and thank you,&rdquo; you huff, your lips curving into a smile as you reach for your set, your heart beating loudly as he kisses your cheek as you stand in front of his tall figure. &ldquo;Oh, and, yes, <i>sort of</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean, &lsquo;<i>sort of</i>&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um, my family <i>will</i> be there, but there are a few more people that are coming, as well,&rdquo; you note, your lips pursing together as you step into your closet, desperately trying to avoid his conversation. He would start to panic &ndash; and the very last thing you would want is for him to have anxiety before having a full day with your family.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, how many is a &lsquo;few&rsquo;?&rdquo; he presses, his hands touching the doorframe as he waits on your response. He was beginning to get anxious.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh,&rdquo; you stutter, pulling a tattered tee shirt of his over your torso, your hair brushed and slicked across your back as you step outside of your wardrobe and begin walking into your bedroom, &ldquo;We have to pick up Granny on our way in, Aunt Ella and Uncle Jay, Uncle Dave and Uncle Joe, and our cousins &ndash; but &lsquo;m not too sure who Mom invited.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Christ,&rdquo; he grumbles, shuffling into your bedroom and laying dramatically on your duvet.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>His anxiety is written across his features, and your heart breaks for him.</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;m gon&rsquo;a be hated by everyone there, aren&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; he whispers, his palms covering his face as he heaves heavy breaths. He can feel his heart beating through his rib cage.</p><p>&ldquo;Why would they hate you?&rdquo; you wonder, confusion spread across your features, your head shaking as you nudge his figure to sit on his bum, your tiny form settled between his thighs. &ldquo;Harry, I have never met <i>anyone</i> that has ever hated you with any inkling of their heart. Why would my family dislike you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I did the <i>one</i> <i>thing</i> I promised I would never do to you!&rdquo; he spits, his chin dipping onto his chest, his fingertips nudging into his eyes as he struggles to hold steady breaths. He doesn&rsquo;t want to match your stare. &ldquo;It was everywhere &ndash; everyone knew, and everyone could see. I hurt you. I don&rsquo;t deserve to be liked by your family.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Bubby. C&rsquo;mon, look at me.&rdquo; Harry huffs in defeat, his eyes glossed with tears, his lips pursed in a line as he listens to you. &ldquo;Have I forgiven you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do I love you?&rdquo; you ask, your palms cupping his cheeks, brushing your thumbs alongst his cheeks. His should know you love him - you tell him you love him in every other breath &ndash; especially when he was beginning to doubt or feel bad about what had happened before.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he sighs, blinking slowly, meeting your soft, blue eyes as you calm him.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what <i>anyone</i> has to say. Do you understand me? Harry, you are everything to me, despite what anyone could ever have to say.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, it&rsquo;s your <i>family</i>. &lsquo;s reasonable as to why they wouldn&rsquo;t like me. It&rsquo;s horrible, too, because whenever an article about it pops up and crosses me, I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about what I did. I&rsquo;m sorry about it all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, my <i>love</i>,&rdquo; you comfort, shaking your head as you settle on his thigh, his hands instinctively holding your thigh and waist, squeezing you tight. &ldquo;We broke up, yeah, and my heart was broken for a while, I won&rsquo;t deny that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he interrupts, kissing your collarbone as your arms wrap around his shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>But</i>, you are the one that makes my heart whole &ndash; that&rsquo;s why my heart broke, because I wasn&rsquo;t with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hurt me, <i>a lot</i>, when I couldn&rsquo;t be with you,&rdquo; he confesses, closing his eyes as you hug him tightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, you make my heart happy. Do you know that? Bub, you make me so happy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;s all I want, always &ndash; to make you happy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, baby, you do,&rdquo; you state confidently, kissing his lips, your smile breaking apart your kiss you. &ldquo;Very happy. I love you, and &lsquo;m very happy and feel very loved by you, always.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he smiles, squeezing your waist as you stand, holding his hands, laughing loudly as you struggle to pull him off of your mattress.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you trying to do, Sweet?&rdquo; he chuckles, wrapping his arms around your waist and pulling you onto him, your smile making his heart swell, your nose nudged against his and he holds you close to him.</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;m trying to have you cuddle me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;m cuddling you, right now, aren&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; he smirks; he knows that he&rsquo;s pushing your buttons, but he loves to see you playfully flustered, especially when you&rsquo;re having a good night.</p><p>&ldquo;Pain in my ass, y&rsquo;know that?&rdquo; you moan, rolling your eyes as you brush his hair out of his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Hm, but you love me,&rdquo; he grins, kissing you as you smile, your hearts beating against each other as he holds you close to his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;I do, I really do.&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>Harry straightens his top, readjusting the buttons he&rsquo;s done four times, questioning his decision to leave two slots unbuttoned, worried he would give the wrong impression with his appearance with your family. He runs his fingers through his hair, patting his cheeks, his fingers fumbling with his jeans buttons as he sticks his feet inside his favourite pair of boots. He smiles, a chuckle leaving his lips as he spots you laying on your mattress in defeat, your torso naked from your dress, only clothes in a bralette and lace panties he had a keen liking of.</p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, you&rsquo;re gon&rsquo;a make us late to pick up <i>Granny</i>,&rdquo; he smirks, coaxing your body off of your comforter, his laugh rumbling his chest as you knock your forehead against his collarbone. &ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t have any clue where my dress is,&rdquo; you groan, eyelashes fluttering closes as he kisses your temple. &ldquo;We have to leave in ten minutes and &lsquo;m still naked.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind it,&rdquo; he shrugs, his laugh echoing around the bedroom, as you smack his arm. &ldquo;Put your dress up in your washroom. Wanted to iron it for you whilst you were doing your hair.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry Styles.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo; he grins, his dimple indenting his cheek as he kisses your temple, patting your bum as you begin to walk out of your bedroom door.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, too. Go on, go get dressed so we can leave. &lsquo;m not picking your grandmother up late. I&rsquo;ll leave without you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure, you will,&rdquo; you smirk, your feet bouncing on your floorboards as you walk into your washroom, your heart warm as you spot your dress hanging up neatly on the door, a note sticking on the wood:</p><p><i>I love you, Sweet. Happy Thanksgiving</i>. <i>x</i></p><p>He walks around your bedroom, stepping in front of your mirror and beginning to grab his wallet and keys from your dresser, his pockets beginning to fill as his phone is slipped into his jeans. He smiles as he feels your arms wrap around his waist, your lips touching his neck as you hug him, your blushed cheeks tight in a smile as he nudges you in front of him, his hands holding you in front of him, his eyes taking in your appearance. &ldquo;Beautiful.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bub, <i>stop it</i>.&rdquo; He wouldn&rsquo;t stop complimenting you &ndash; he wanted you to truly know how beautiful you are, especially to him &ndash; you knew that very well, no matter how many times you told him to.</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;s this okay? Haven&rsquo;t been to a Thanksgiving Dinner with my girl&rsquo;s family, ever. Don&rsquo;t really know how to dress for the occasion.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Say &lsquo;my girl&rsquo; again,&rdquo; you smile, brushing your palms over his collarbone, your lips touching his jaw softly.</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he questions, kissing you sweetly as your arms wrap around his shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Because</i>, &lsquo;s the sweetest thing; you give me butterflies when you say that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hope you know you&rsquo;re <i>my girl</i> always,&rdquo; Harry smiles, kissing your cheek as he hugs you tight.</p><p>&ldquo;Better be,&rdquo; you wink, squeezing him close, your hands beginning to grab your purse and pop your essentials inside, your eyes traveling around your bedroom to ensure you wouldn&rsquo;t forget anything.</p><p>&ldquo;Do I look alright? Will I make a good impression?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bub, you make the <i>best</i> impressions,&rdquo; you smile widely, lacing your fingertips through his as you begin to walk out of your apartment.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he says softly, holding your hand as you step into your car, your purse and his belongings sitting in the console, his lips pursing as you smile.</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s eyes meet yours as he begins to close the door, hesitating before walking to his driver&rsquo;s seat and sliding inside, and you can see the nervousness overwhelming him. He is confident, a strong character, but he was anxious. He wanted his first impression to be perfect, to be liked by everyone and be loved by your parents.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; you emphasise, your lips touching his hand, your thumb rubbing his palm comfortingly, your heart softening as he smiles at you.</p><p>Harry would be loved by everyone. He always is.</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;Granny? We&rsquo;re here!&rdquo; you shout, stepping inside her home and peeking around her kitchen to spot her kitchen scattered with desserts to bring with her to your parent&rsquo;s house.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, sweetheart! I&rsquo;ll be right out!&rdquo; she calls, her dainty voice echoing off her walls.</p><p>Harry walks deeper into her foyer, his grin aching his cheeks as he carefully admires every picture of you structured on her wall. He envisioned how many pictures your mother and father have, how many he would be able to go through and tease you for, which ones from your adolescent and teenage years that would be his favourites, which school pictures he would point out, which candid he would see of you laughing that make his heart soar.</p><p>&ldquo;Sweet, look at you,&rdquo; Harry smirks, his fingertip touching your grandmother&rsquo;s frame. &ldquo;Cute baby, you were.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut your mouth, &rsquo;ve seen your naked baby pictures,&rdquo; you stern, your eyes rolling as he chuckles, your teeth biting your lip in an (awful) attempt to hide your smile. He opens his arms wide, his chest heaving a heavy breath as you wrap your arms around his waist, his lips kissing your hair, your cheek laying against his heart as you stand close to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Have seen me naked as an adult, too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry!&rdquo; you gasp, stepping backwards, his hands holding yours as he laughs loudly, your jaw agape as you stare at him in astonishment.</p><p>&ldquo;How are you, lovey? Oh! You must be Harry,&rdquo; your grandmother chirps, stepping into the foyer, her smile bright as she kisses your cheek, her attention averting to Harry as he stands shyly behind you.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, that&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; he chuckles, his eyebrows raising in surprise as she embraces him, her tiny figure surrounded by him as he hugs her.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, I&rsquo;m Granny. It&rsquo;s nice to finally meet you!&rdquo; she grins, her hands holding his lightly as she steps back, her smirk making you blush as she nods excitedly.</p><p>&ldquo;Same to you,&rdquo; he smiles warmly, his anxiety beginning to deflate as he listens to her whispers of approval and praise.</p><p>&ldquo;Very nice, honey bee,&rdquo; she winks, squeezing your arm with a smile, pretending to whisper. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s handsome.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Granny, shh.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Should marry him, you&rsquo;ll have beautiful babies,&rdquo; Granny giggles, patting your cheek as she begins gathering her purse and desserts.</p><p>&ldquo;Granny!&rdquo; you squeak, shaking your head, your mouth agape as you listen to your <i>boyfriend</i> and your <i>grandmother</i> talk about marriage.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me think about it, Granny.&rdquo; Harry smiles <i>so </i>widely &ndash; quite possibly the greatest smile you have ever seen on his features &ndash; and your heart swells. He is becoming surer of himself, more <i>Harry</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;m waiting for the day I can say, &lsquo;<i>I told you so</i>&rsquo;!&rdquo; she chimes, stepping outside of her home behind you, closing and locking her front door, happily following her paved walkway to get into your car.</p><p>He smiles at you, wrapping his arm around your shoulder and kissing your temple, his voice rasped and low when he whispers, &ldquo;&rsquo;m excited for the day she says, &lsquo;<i>I told you so&rsquo;</i>, too.&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>His heart is warm and his mind soothed as he steps into your parent&rsquo;s house. He is comfortable there; your family had welcomed him with love every time he stepped foot inside their foyer, and he knew he wouldn&rsquo;t be expected to be a publicised version of himself; with your family, he was himself &ndash; his natural, funny, confident, loving self &ndash; and he was so appreciative of their acceptance and kindness.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here!&rdquo; Harry shouts, his heart warming as you grin, your arms wrapping around and hugging his waist tightly as he kisses your hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry! We are so happy you made it. Come in, come in,&rdquo; your mother grins, embracing Harry lightly, her hands rubbing against her apron as she kisses your cheek, her full attention drawn to him, &ldquo;How was your flight?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, Y/M/N,&rdquo; he grins, kissing your mother&rsquo;s cheek sweetly, following her path as she perks her ears to the cooking timer. She bustles into their kitchen, her attention shifting focus as she holds her oven mitts and pulls the turkey out of the oven. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t too bad, thank you for asking. Originally, I wasn&rsquo;t set to fly in until next week, but when Y/N called and asked if I wanted to celebrate with you, I booked the first red-eye out of Mexico City from the Press Conference.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, please, you can call me &lsquo;Mom&rsquo; like the whole lot of &lsquo;em do,&rdquo; she hums, her heart warm as she admires how he <i>smiles</i> at you. She could see how much he loved you. &ldquo;She told us! We are <i>so</i> happy you could be with us, today. Y/N told us you were flying in yesterday and to set a place, and the whole family has been talking about you coming &ndash; especially Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Stop</i>,&rdquo; you blush, hiding your face in your palms as you lean against your mother&rsquo;s counter.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s fine, sweetheart. Harry must know you talk about him a lot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure, Sweet &ndash; tell me how much you talk about me,&rdquo; he smirks, wrapping his arms around your waist, his lips touching your cheek softly, his heart softening as you turn in his arms, crossing your arms around his shoulders, kissing his lips with a smile.</p><p>Harry laughs loudly, his heart warm and swollen as she listens to your mother talk, revealing how you talk about him and how happy his coming had made you. He smiled, closing his eyes as you squeeze his hips.</p><p>&ldquo;God, you are <i>all</i> feeding his ego, right now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did someone say <i>whipped</i>,&rdquo; James snorts, his daughter propped on his hip, his wife talking mindlessly with Phoebe. He chuckles as you smack his arm, his hands placing his daughter in your hold as she reaches for you.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Shut up</i>!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Could I help in any way, <i>Mom</i>?&rdquo; he smiles, his cheeks aching as he grins at your niece, her laughter making his heart warm.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m alright! Go into the living room. Y/D/N has a game on &ndash; I&rsquo;m not too sure which one, but he&rsquo;ll be very happy to see you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he nods, his smile etched into his features as he kisses your cheek, his heart beating anxiously as he spots your father, his hand propped with a beer, his nervousness spiking, &ldquo;thank you, again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; your father greets, standing onto his feet and hugging him warmly, &ldquo;how are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;m good, how are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m alright! We have the family together, today. It&rsquo;s always a great day when that happens,&rdquo; he smiles brightly, settling in his lounger and turning the television&rsquo;s volume down.</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;m grateful you invited me,&rdquo; Harry stutters, rubbing his sweaty palms against his jeans as he sits on the couch. &ldquo;Um, I&rsquo;m really sorry for everything that happened, in the past, y&rsquo;know? &lsquo;m sure that left a horrible impression of me, and &lsquo;m incredibly sorry for that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, we understand how hard it all must be &ndash; having your privacy invaded at all times, having a public light shown on your life &ndash; and we understand that mistakes are made, and <i>things happen</i>. Y/M/N and I split apart for six months, in our early dating years &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t make you a horrible person. Y/N is a great judge of character, and she has forgiven you, so, we are all okay; alright?&rdquo; your father reassures, his lips pursing together as he leans forward, his hands set on his thighs as he pays close attention to the young man sitting nervously in front of him.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, alright, yeah; really appreciate that, more than you know,&rdquo; he gulps, his nerves beginning to settle in his stomach as he matches his stare with your father&rsquo;s &ndash; he could tell that your father wasn&rsquo;t lying with his words, he truly meant that <i>everything</i> was and would be alright &ndash; and he felt comforted and secure. &ldquo;&rsquo;m really grateful that you&rsquo;ve welcomed me as much as you have &ndash; it&rsquo;s not every day that you have that, and I&rsquo;m grateful you and Y/M/N have me in your home for occasions, like this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, you&rsquo;re part of the family,&rdquo; he grins, patting his knee, his figure leaning back in his lounger as he continues their conversation. &ldquo;Of course, you&rsquo;re invited &ndash; you&rsquo;re always welcome, here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;m happy to be here,&rdquo; Harry opens, his demeanour shifting from anxious to steady, his comfort and loved welcome making his mind soothe and his personality to shine through his words and behaviours. &ldquo;Hate being away from Y/N for so long. It&rsquo;s truly the worst.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t seen Y/N so happy, in weeks,&rdquo; your father confesses, peeking around the walkway to spot you and your sister chatting aimlessly with your mother. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s whenever you&rsquo;re here &ndash; when you&rsquo;re here, she&rsquo;s the happiest she&rsquo;s even been.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hate doing long distance with her,&rdquo; he whispers, his ears perking as he hears your laughter, the echoed noise bouncing off the walls making his heart flutter &ndash; as clich&eacute; as he could sound, your laugh gave him butterflies, &ldquo;but, I&rsquo;d fly thousands of miles to be with her if it meant she would be happy and smiling. &nbsp;She deserves nothing but the best. She means the world to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We, <i>everyone</i>, can see how much you love her, Harry. We, <i>I</i>, am so grateful that she&rsquo;s found someone like you. She, like you said, deserves <i>nothing</i> but the best, and I&rsquo;m happy she&rsquo;s found that in such a fine, young man.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Could I ask you a question?&rdquo;</p><p>His nerves crawled into his throat and he thought he could be sick. He didn&rsquo;t have any gauge of how your father&rsquo;s reaction would be. He could only hope he wouldn&rsquo;t be shoved out of your parents&rsquo; home and told to never come back. He silently prayed that your father would be happy instead of angry, be overjoyed instead of upset.</p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t wait any longer.</p><p>&ldquo;Mhm,&rdquo; your father nods, a smile tugging at his lips as he anticipates the question that is about be uttered from your boyfriend&rsquo;s lips.</p><p>&ldquo;I love Y/N, I love her with my whole heart. Want to give her the world, I do.&rdquo; Harry is sure of this; out of all of the things he could possibly do in his lifetime, he would give everything to be able to give you the world every single day. &ldquo;Um, I wanted to ask you, if -.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry coughs, <i>physically</i> chokes on his own words, because of his nerves. His palms are sweating, his mouth is dry, and his feet are tingling; he&rsquo;s not felt this nervous since his audition five years ago.</p><p>&ldquo;Do I have your blessing to ask Y/N to marry me?&rdquo; he slurs, his words meshing together as he rushes his question out of his mouth. His brain has never felt so overwhelmed.</p><p>His heart aches as he carefully observes your father&rsquo;s features. He would much rather a &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;no&rsquo; answer than having to sit and wait on a response, especially with such a heavy question. Harry&rsquo;s future with you, <i>your</i> future, is dependent on this one response, one word, and he could physically feel his stomach churn.</p><p>&ldquo;She deserves everything, and I want to do my absolute best to give that to her. Want to spend my entire life loving her, I really do.&rdquo; His voice quiets as he hears the quiet humming of the boiling water and oven timers &ndash; dinner must be ready, which means you would be coming at any moment to gather him and your father to the table; he needed your father&rsquo;s answer <i>soon</i> or he would combust. &ldquo;&lsquo;m quite traditional, in this way, and I want to have your blessing. Y/D/N, &lsquo;m wanting to propose quite soon &ndash; Y/N and I talk about this often, and we&rsquo;re growing really exhausted of the long distance. We agreed that we wouldn&rsquo;t make decisions about moving until we&rsquo;re engaged, but we&rsquo;re both growing antsy. &lsquo;m lookin&rsquo; at rings, and my father has been helping me choose a jeweller. With all of that, I would like to have your permission, your blessing, before I ask her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, are you ready to eat?&rdquo; you chirp, your fingertips curled around the doorframe, your lips perked in a soft smile as you admire your father and boyfriend talking perfectly together (your worst nightmare would have been for your father to hate the <i>love of your life</i> &ndash; you couldn&rsquo;t possibly imagine that scenario). &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We are, sweetheart,&rdquo; your father smiles, pushing his lounger into the upright position, his head nodding towards the dining room where your family would all be eating that evening. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be right in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll set your plates. Bub, do you want me to make yours?&rdquo; you ask innocently, oblivious to the intensity of the conversation that had been lingering in the lounge only minutes before.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Harry smiles softly, shaking his head with a chuckle as you grin happily, turning on your heel with assurance as you disappear into the kitchen &ndash; he adored that about you; the <i>littlest</i> things made you happy. &ldquo;Thank you, Sweet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry?&rdquo; you father calls, standing on his feet, his tall figure standing in front of Harry, his palm facing flat on his shoulder, their eyes matching stare as their heights match.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Harry mutters, his heart overflowing with love and pure joy as your father grins, his features excited and happy as his palm pats his cheek lovingly &ndash; Harry knew his answer, he didn&rsquo;t need to verbally say it, but he is <i>so</i> happy that he is.</p><p>&ldquo;Welcome to the family, Son.&rdquo;</p></p>",

He would take every moment with you he could possibly have &ndash; hugging you, kissing you, touching you, laughing with you, cuddling you; simply<i> </i>having you with him made him happy.</p>\n<p>He would give everything to make you happy and living thousands of miles away wasn&rsquo;t doing anything of the sort.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Soon.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Soon.&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",
