        "question": "ever since the show came out and showed that jon was a legitimate targaryen. the response has always rubbed me the wrong way. \u201cjon snow is not a bastard afterall! he\u2019s the heir to the iron throne\u201d. and for jon just to forget his bastard upbringing and be a targaryen king feels wrong to me? from what i gathered about his character, being a legitimate child isn\u2019t something he wants. it is ultimately to belong and be a stark. i just want to know your thoughts on this?",
        "answer": "<p>There is no forgetting that Jon <b>Snow</b>, regardless of whether his parents were married or not, regardless of how high he rises in life, was raised the Bastard of Winterfell.</p><p>Jon is deeply uncomfortable with his bastardy and I believe he <i>does</i>\u00a0want legitimacy, if only to escape said bastardy.

This is one of the aspects of the book that hasn\u2019t come across so clearly in the show. What resentment Jon feels for Robb <i>is</i>\u00a0inextricably bound up with the position Robb has as Ned\u2019s heir and, later, the King in the North.

Was it expensive? Yes it was. Was it worth the money? I like to think so. The chances that i\u2019ll ever be within feet of him ever again is very low, so why not do it? I shared the picture with a few people, but I\u2019m not planning on posting it on here.

It was an interesting panel talking about about how to build social networks in various industries. It was very encouraging.

I never knew this was a thing, but now that I do I\u2019m VERY seriously thinking about joining the NYC chapter. I mean seriously.. if anyone reading this identifies as female, you might want to consider joining if there is a chapter where you live. It would be kind of meeting up with other fellow nerdy females for some fun activities and hanging out.</p><p>After that, I decided to go back to that vendor I discovered the day before to buy my Jon Snow Pops. The line to buy the Pops was very confusing and long. It was confusing because I had to ask a couple times to figure where the end of the line was. It was so long and the Exhibitors Hall was so crowded, the purchase line had to be cut up into 3 segments to allow crowds to pass through the aisles! I had to wait probably about 15 minutes before I got to the counter and told the people at the counter which ones I wanted. I was so happy I got my Jons.

It\u2019s always fun to sit in on the panel listening in on what interesting manga title they just finished releasing and what stuff is coming out in the next few months that might be of interest. I sat on the panel last year and happily discovered a couple titles that are really great reads that I would recommend.

So as long as I was physically inside the convention center, by around 11am, I was good to go. I just barely made it as I had missed a train and had to wait five minutes for the next train. Then I had to wait a few minutes for the 7 train to get me all the way to the convention center. Anyways I just managed to get inside in time for a SPECIAL thing that I only decided to do about a week before the con\u2026</p><p>Why yes\u2026 I did pay money to take a picture with David Tennant. Was it expensive? Yes it was. Was it worth the money? I like to think so. The chances that i\u2019ll ever be within feet of him ever again is very low, so why not do it? I shared the picture with a few people, but I\u2019m not planning on posting it on here. Anyways, it was a brief moment and I was only around him long enough to take the picture and say good morning to him. Still it was a cool moment that I\u2019ll remember. Taking a picture with my favorite Doctor.</p><p>So the first proper panel of the day was the 1<i>2:15 Building Your Own Themyscira</i>. It was an interesting panel talking about about how to build social networks in various industries. It was very encouraging. I also discovered <b><a href=\"http://www.geekgirlbrunch.com\" target=\"_blank\">Geek Girl Brunch</a></b>. I never knew this was a thing, but now that I do I\u2019m VERY seriously thinking about joining the NYC chapter. I mean seriously.. if anyone reading this identifies as female, you might want to consider joining if there is a chapter where you live. It would be kind of meeting up with other fellow nerdy females for some fun activities and hanging out.</p><p>After that, I decided to go back to that vendor I discovered the day before to buy my Jon Snow Pops. The line to buy the Pops was very confusing and long. It was confusing because I had to ask a couple times to figure where the end of the line was. It was so long and the Exhibitors Hall was so crowded, the purchase line had to be cut up into 3 segments to allow crowds to pass through the aisles! I had to wait probably about 15 minutes before I got to the counter and told the people at the counter which ones I wanted. I was so happy I got my Jons. As I posted the pictures on another post, they have joined their brother and the other Stark pops here at home. Hm\u2026 I should find time and do a family reunion picture of the Pops. Now I just need an Iron Throne\u2026</p><p>My day was ending early as the only other panel of interest to me per schedule was the 4:00pm Kodansha Comics panel. It\u2019s always fun to sit in on the panel listening in on what interesting manga title they just finished releasing and what stuff is coming out in the next few months that might be of interest. I sat on the panel last year and happily discovered a couple titles that are really great reads that I would recommend. There are a couple titles that sounded promising, but if I actually read them I\u2019ll mention them on here in the future as they haven\u2019t been published in English yet.</p><p>At any rate, it was just as well I ended my second day at the con kind of early given the VERY long day ahead of me the next day\u2026</p>",
