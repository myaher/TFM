She tries to kill Joff in episode 10, season 1. She saves a stranger\u2019s life in episode 1, season 2. She survives her torment, not broken. She tells Olenna Tyrell, Joffrey is a monster, so she helps her decide she has to kill him. She runs away, she survives surrounded by monsters, she is sold to the Boltons, brutally raped, beaten, but still not broken. She survives, runs away, accepts Brienne\u2019s trust, reunite with Jon, convince Jon to fight, they take back Winterfell, she saves everyone\u2019s asses, she never takes credit, she let the lords crown Jon King, she stands by him even when she does not agree with him, she cries when Bran comes back, she cries when Arya gets back, she cares for the Northern people, for the food supply, she actually runs the shit, defends Jon in front of the proud Northern lords, while Jon is fucking the dragon queen. She teams up with her siblings, manipulates Littlefinger into a death trap, she passes the sentence, so she kills him, she acknowledges her fathers words about the pack surviving, about the importance of the family. She defends her family and the north when Dany comes, because she doesn\u2019t know her, all she knows is, that her father burned her granddad and uncle alive and that her brother has raped and killed her aunt. She is not afraid to question Dany\u2019s decisions in order to protect the North and her people AND her family, Jon, specifically. She is willing to stay with her people before Arya sends her to the crypts. Yet, terrified, knowing that she is useless when it comes to physical fight, she decides to abandon the hiding spot in order to fight the dead. And she once again, survives.\u00a0</p><p>Everyone:\u00a0\u201cOh gods, she\u2019s such a bitch, she never does anything, just cries how life is unfair, omg, die already, you are useless.\u201d</p><p>OK&hellip;\u00a0</p>",

            "description": "<p>**DO NOT SEND PORN OR DICK PICS. I WILL AUTOMATICALLY BLOCK YOU.** 'Another Bondi Blonde?!! Just what bloody Bondi needs like a hole in the head' are the poetic words barked at me by my boss the day I turned up with newly bleached locks. I'm a travelling seanchaidh of sorts. A ping pong OzScot currently living on the Dark Side. Mummy, Tantrum &amp; Meltdown Negotiator &amp; Playdate Social Secretary to my Irish Twins who are my absolute world, Staffie owner, Wifey, TKD, Nerd, HR professional, charity warrior, Governess of Home Duties, Keeper of the Snacks, spoonie, music lover, avid reader, shoe collector, current redhead but blonde at heart, clothes slave and booze hag to Scottish botanical gins/unofficial taster. This is an eclectic collection of thoughts, lyrics and images that tickle my fancy. I do not have copyright to most things I post so please ask me to remove if needs be. I will still be here after 17.12.18. No dick pics or unsolicited sleazy messages as I'm not here to hook up. Occasional #me posts. My bark is probably just as bad as my bite. Some NSFW postings so bugger off if you are under 18 \ud83d\udd1e PS I don't send nudes or sext so jog on. I won\u2019t follow back porn blogs etc. If you send me a dick pic or an abusive message I will publish it, name and shame then bake cookies and shit.
