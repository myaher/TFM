If you would prefer, you can also read it on AO3 <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/18032402/chapters/43032233#workskin\">here</a>. Hope you enjoy reading it!</p><!-- more --><p>It was obvious that SHIELD\u2019s medical wing was not meant for young patients. Tony mentally scoffed when he saw someone had tried to hastily put up colorful posters and pictures on the walls in a sad attempt to make the usually stoic and sleek hallways appear more warm and cozy. </p><p>It was just Tony and the doctor walking down the corridor to Peter\u2019s room- Fury had left to continue to deal with the aftershocks of finding a still-operating HYDRA base. </p><p>Dr. Helames slowed down to stop in front of a door at the end of the dead end hallway. \u201cAnd here we are,\u201d She smiled, and Tony felt grateful that she didn\u2019t comment on his obviously-nervous appearance. \u201cI\u2019m going to go in with you but I\u2019ll step out once Peter feels comfortable enough with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Tony said, taking a deep breath. Part of him was begging to just bolt and never look back, but Tony locked those feelings up behind steel doors. He refused to be a coward and just abandon his child. He was not Howard Stark. </p><p>\u201cJust as a reminder, he does have enhanced senses so try to keep your voice low. We had to make his door and walls soundproof because he kept hearing noises from even outside of the base.\u201d</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t even know what to say towards that so instead he just nodded tightly. Dr. Helames smiled again, this time more understanding, before gently opening the door. </p><p>Once it was open enough she poked her head inside the room and in a soft voice called out, \u201cPeter? May I come in?\u201d She paused for a moment, obviously waiting for the kid to respond. He must have given a positive reaction because the doctor then asked, \u201cI also brought a friend to visit you, is it ok if he comes in?\u201d</p><p>This time the kid\u2019s response came out much more hesitant, but the doctor waited patiently. It was obvious that Dr. Helames was trying to allow Peter to have the chance to make choices for himself, which made sense; his captors hadn\u2019t most likely allowed the kid to make any decisions on what was happening to him. Tony mentally noted to give the kid choices for simple things in the future. </p><p>Tony shifted his weight as he waited for Peter\u2019s decision. If he was being honest with himself he hadn\u2019t even thought there was a chance that the kid would refuse to meet with him today. If Peter decided to send him away right now Tony wouldn\u2019t hold it against him- he clearly remembered how he barely wanted to meet with random people after returning home from his own kidnapping. Regardless, Tony had promised himself he wouldn\u2019t give up on the kid, and if there was one thing Stark men were good at it was keeping their promises.</p><p>Dr. Helames\u2019s grateful voice brought Tony out of his musings. \u201cPerfect, we\u2019re going to come in then,\u201d She said, opening the door wider to allow herself in. She turned back to look at Tony, who was still rooted in his spot just outside the room. She smiled reassuringly as she gestured with a tip of her head for him to come inside. Before Tony could talk himself out of it he squared his shoulders and joined her inside the room.</p><p>As much as Tony had been trying to prepare himself for this moment it seemed as if it were all in vein as he still felt his hands tremble and the air leave his lungs in a quick release as soon as he spotted the boy on the bed. The kid was absolutely tiny, smaller than what Tony had been expecting. The boy\u2019s hair was longer than in all the pictures Tony had seen previously, and it curled sweetly near the nape of his head. But what Tony couldn\u2019t help but notice most of all was how bright the kid\u2019s eyes were- and how they were the exact shade of Tony\u2019s own. </p><p>Peter had his head cocked to the side in obvious confusion and with a hint of fear. He looked quickly between Dr. Helames and Tony, before deciding to settle his gaze on the stranger in front of him. Tony knew the exact moment that Peter seemed to recognize him when he saw the kid\u2019s eyes widen while he sucked in a quick gasp.</p><p>\u201cPeter, I\u2019d like you to meet a good friend of mine,\u201d Dr. Helames announced but Tony didn\u2019t even spare a glance at her; his gaze was stuck firmly on the little boy in front of him who looked seconds away from bolting. \u201cThis is Tony Stark. Tony, this is Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cH-hey kid,\u201d Tony stuttered out, and part of him was embarrassed at how emotional he sounded in front of the doctor. However, a bigger part of him could care less how he sounded because he was finally meeting his son! Maybe it was creepy but Tony couldn\u2019t stop staring at the kid. He drank in every feature of the boy as if he were about to go blind; he tried to memorize every little detail the kid\u2019s face while he silently realized that holy crap! Tony had somehow helped make this beautiful, perfect creature in front of him. The genius was usually proud of the things he created and invented but he could already tell that the title for his best (greatest) creation would always belong to the tiny boy in front of him.</p><p>Tony watched in trepidation as the boy raised a small hand and waved hesitantly. Tony felt a watery smile on his lips as he waved back. </p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d Dr. Helames said, snapping the boys attention back to her for a moment. \u201cI have to go check on other patients, but is it ok if Mr. Stark here keeps you company until I come back?\u201d</p><p>Tony was expecting more hesitation from Peter but was surprised when the kid nodded eagerly, eyes much brighter if that was even possible. Dr. Helames beamed. \u201cPerfect! Then I\u2019ll be back in a few minutes.\u201d And with that she silently exited the room, but not before shooting Tony a small wink. Tony turned back towards the kid when he heard the door click shut behind him.</p><p>The room lapsed into an awkward silence as the kid nervously fixed his eyes down to his blanketed lap while Tony just continued to gaze at the boy. He saw the kid\u2019s eyes peek up shyly before shooting back down towards his lap when he saw that the man was still staring at him. Tony internally groaned. <i>Great, not even five full minutes and I\u2019m already scaring my kid. Great job, genius</i>, he berated himself.</p><p>He forced himself to stop staring and instead glanced around the room. With a quirk of his lips he commented, \u201cNot exactly a five star hotel, huh?\u201d</p><p>His heart almost came to a stop when the kid gave the most delicate giggle he ever heard. Peter looked up to meet Tony\u2019s eyes as he smiled timidly. He pointed a finger towards a chair next to the bed as he stared imploringly at Tony. </p><p>The billionaire raised an eyebrow as he smiled softly. \u201cDo you want me to sit there?\u201d Peter bobbed his head, clearly glad that the man could easily tell what he wanted. Tony could feel his heart melt as he moved to sit in the chair. \u201cAlright, thanks for the seat, kiddo,\u201d</p><p>Peter bashfully bowed his head as he fidgeted with his blankets. From the closer angle Tony could observe some of the kid\u2019s finer features. He could see how the kid\u2019s eyelashes were long like his own and how slight freckles dotted his nose and cheeks. There was a light scar on the side of his chin and Tony couldn\u2019t help but wonder if it came from before or after his time with HYDRA.</p><p>Tony\u2019s eyes drifted to the bedside table at Peter\u2019s other side of the bed and noticed there was a small model Empire State Building made out of Lego blocks. \u201cYou build that?\u201d Tony asked, making sure to keep his voice warm and quiet. Peter looked up and nodded, a slight blush staining his cheeks as he continued to stare at his lap. \u201cWow, it looks really good! I couldn\u2019t have made a better one even if I tried.\u201d</p><p>It was an obvious lie and Tony internally winced at how forced his exclamation sounded. He wasn\u2019t used to interacting with kids, especially ones as young as Peter, so he didn\u2019t even have a baseline on what to say to the kid. Regardless of how stiff Tony sounded the kid started to uncurl on the bed, turning to face the man next to him. The boy bit his lip and pointed towards a box next to the Lego Empire State Building, looking hopefully up at Tony. The genius melted on the spot. </p><p>\u201cDo you want me to grab it?\u201d Another shy nod from the kid. \u201cAlright, hold on.\u201d Tony reached across the bed and grabbed the box, handing it over to Peter slowly so he wouldn\u2019t scare the kid. Peter took it and opened the box, showing the contents to the billionaire. Tony saw that the box was filled to the brim with various Lego pieces, blocks, and cars. The boy picked up a little orange sports car and started to spin its wheels as he cocked his head at Tony.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you thinking, kiddo?\u201d Tony asked and immediately wanted to smack himself. The doctor had told him the boy was practically mute after the trauma he had faced, why would he suddenly answer Tony of all people? </p><p>Peter blinked at the question before his eyes drifted to Tony\u2019s chest. He reached forwards and tried to touch the Arc Reactor. Reacting on instinct Tony flinched away, causing the boy to stiffen and pull his arm backwards, quickly lowering his head and looking as if he were waiting to get hit. Tony\u2019s heart clenched as he regarded the boy in regret. It seemed that Tony was doomed to continue to make stupid mistakes and keep scaring his kid away </p><p>\u201cSorry kid, you just\u2026 uh surprised me is all,\u201d Tony started. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to scare you. Can you please look at me again?\u201d</p><p>Peter gnawed at his lower lip but ultimately peered up at Tony. His previously bright eyes had dulled slightly as started to spin his car\u2019s wheels faster. Tony tried to offer him a soft and comforting smile. \u201cDo you want to see my Arc Reactor?\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widened but he didn\u2019t offer a nod or shake of his head. Reading the expression on the boy\u2019s face Tony assumed that the kid wanted to see the reactor but didn\u2019t want to admit it in case it made Tony upset. Taking a deep breath Tony decided to lower his shirt so the kid could look at the reactor clearly. </p><p>Tony tried not to squirm as the boy studied the Arc Reactor in silence. He wasn\u2019t exactly a fan of showing people what had basically kept him alive for the past year (and also what had very nearly killed him), but he swallowed the discomfort in order to make his son (still not freaking used to that) less apprehensive. </p><p>Peter lifted his eyes to meet Tony\u2019s gaze before he very slowly lifted the hand that wasn\u2019t holding the toy car. The kid cautiously reached to touch the Arc Reactor while still holding Tony\u2019s gaze. It was obvious that Peter was trying to give Tony a chance to move away again if he needed to, and that made the genius\u2019s previously cold heart flutter as he realized how empathetic his son was.</p><p>Tony allowed Peter to touch the Arc Reactor. He was expecting the child to push hard against it but instead Peter just lightly grazed his finger over the top of it. The kid smiled as he looked over the Arc Reactor before leaning back and away from the billionaire. Tony pulled up his shirt once he was sure the kid didn\u2019t want to continue to study the reactor. Smiling slightly he questioned, \u201cYou\u2019re a fan of Iron Man, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Peter grinned widely and motioned to a shelf on the opposite wall. From here Tony could barely make out a child\u2019s version of the Iron Man helmet, which for some reason looked vaguely familiar but Tony wasn\u2019t sure why. Tony couldn\u2019t stop his own grin from forming on his lips when he realized that his son was actually a fan of his alter ego. The idea made Tony feel warm inside.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess he is the best hero out there,\u201d Tony teased, causing the kid to giggle again as he continued to play with his toy car on the bed. Tony felt the last of the previous tension uncoil from his stomach as he decided that yes, his kid had the most adorable little giggle out there.</p><p>\u201cAnd why are you laughing?\u201d Tony asked in mock offense, making sure it was obvious that he was kidding by widening his smile. Peter looked up at him with starstruck eyes so Tony figured he was doing a good job of it. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe I\u2019m the best superhero, kiddo?\u201d</p><p>Peter rapidly shook his head, giggles growing louder. It was at that moment that Tony knew that he had fallen deeply in love with the boy in front of him, and that without even trying the kid had seamlessly wrapped the billionaire tightly around his finger. If the kid asked for the moon right then and there Tony would have probably called up the head of NASA to ask how to buy the moon just to keep that beautiful smile on his son\u2019s face. </p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes snapped to the door and before Tony could as if something was wrong he heard a soft knock. A second later Dr. Helames poked her head in the room. \u201cEverything ok in here, boys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony confirmed, shooting a small smile with Peter that the boy slowly returned. \u201cEverything\u2019s going great, doc, I think me and Petey here are getting along swimmingly.\u201d</p><p>Peter flushed and and lowered his head, but Tony could see the timid ghost of a smile on that precious little face. God, he was sounding so sappy but Tony didn\u2019t care; he absolutely already adored this kid with his whole heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that,\u201d Dr. Helames replied truthfully. \u201cBut unfortunately it\u2019s time for Peter to take a nap, he\u2019s still healing and the medication we have to give him will make him drowsy.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s expression completely changed at those words and he turned wide eyes towards Tony. The genius\u2019s chest tightened when he saw the honest distress in those doe-brown eyes, but he knew logically that the kid was still healing so he needed all the rest he could have. </p><p>Still, Tony reached a cautious hand to lay on Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t look so sad, kiddie, sleeps important. Or, at least I\u2019ve been told that,\u201d Tony gave an exaggerated eye roll, earning a watery giggle from Peter. \u201cHow about this: You take a nice nap, and I\u2019ll come visit you again really soon?\u201d</p><p>A tear slipped from Peter\u2019s eye and Tony, without even thinking about it, reached up to wipe it away. He froze, and was about to apologize until Peter leaned into Tony\u2019s hand against his cheek. The boy pursed his lips and held up a hand, pinky out.</p><p>Tony blinked and the realized what the kid meant. If possible his chest warmed even more as he asked, \u201cYou want me to pinky promise, kid?\u201d Peter nodded and stared at Tony wordlessly. \u201cFair enough, pinky promises are pretty unbreakable I guess.\u201d Tony moved his hand away from the kids face as he wrapped his pinky around Peter\u2019s much smaller one. The kid beamed up at him and Tony returned the expression. The kid put his little car back into the box and leaned away to put it on the bedside table.</p><p>Tony quietly stood up and watched as the kid got comfortable on the bed. The kid waved at him again so Tony waved back. \u201cSee you later, kiddo, have wonderful dreams.\u201d Peter watched owlishly as Tony went towards the door. The billionaire paused before he turned back to the kid. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really glad I got to meet you, kiddie, and I can\u2019t wait to see you again.\u201d The last thing Tony saw before he closed the door to his son\u2019s room was Peter\u2019s bright eyes. </p><p>Once the door was fully closed Tony leaned his forehead against the door as he closed his eyes, cementing his son\u2019s precious face in his mind.</p>",

But what Tony couldn\u2019t help but notice most of all was how bright the kid\u2019s eyes were- and how they were the exact shade of Tony\u2019s own. </p><p>Peter had his head cocked to the side in obvious confusion and with a hint of fear. He looked quickly between Dr. Helames and Tony, before deciding to settle his gaze on the stranger in front of him. Tony knew the exact moment that Peter seemed to recognize him when he saw the kid\u2019s eyes widen while he sucked in a quick gasp.</p><p>\u201cPeter, I\u2019d like you to meet a good friend of mine,\u201d Dr. Helames announced but Tony didn\u2019t even spare a glance at her; his gaze was stuck firmly on the little boy in front of him who looked seconds away from bolting. \u201cThis is Tony Stark. Tony, this is Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cH-hey kid,\u201d Tony stuttered out, and part of him was embarrassed at how emotional he sounded in front of the doctor. However, a bigger part of him could care less how he sounded because he was finally meeting his son! Maybe it was creepy but Tony couldn\u2019t stop staring at the kid. He drank in every feature of the boy as if he were about to go blind; he tried to memorize every little detail the kid\u2019s face while he silently realized that holy crap! Tony had somehow helped make this beautiful, perfect creature in front of him. The genius was usually proud of the things he created and invented but he could already tell that the title for his best (greatest) creation would always belong to the tiny boy in front of him.</p><p>Tony watched in trepidation as the boy raised a small hand and waved hesitantly. Tony felt a watery smile on his lips as he waved back. </p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d Dr. Helames said, snapping the boys attention back to her for a moment. \u201cI have to go check on other patients, but is it ok if Mr. Stark here keeps you company until I come back?\u201d</p><p>Tony was expecting more hesitation from Peter but was surprised when the kid nodded eagerly, eyes much brighter if that was even possible. Dr. Helames beamed. \u201cPerfect! Then I\u2019ll be back in a few minutes.\u201d And with that she silently exited the room, but not before shooting Tony a small wink. Tony turned back towards the kid when he heard the door click shut behind him.</p><p>The room lapsed into an awkward silence as the kid nervously fixed his eyes down to his blanketed lap while Tony just continued to gaze at the boy. He saw the kid\u2019s eyes peek up shyly before shooting back down towards his lap when he saw that the man was still staring at him. Tony internally groaned. <i>Great, not even five full minutes and I\u2019m already scaring my kid. Great job, genius</i>, he berated himself.</p><p>He forced himself to stop staring and instead glanced around the room. With a quirk of his lips he commented, \u201cNot exactly a five star hotel, huh?\u201d</p><p>His heart almost came to a stop when the kid gave the most delicate giggle he ever heard. Peter looked up to meet Tony\u2019s eyes as he smiled timidly. He pointed a finger towards a chair next to the bed as he stared imploringly at Tony. </p><p>The billionaire raised an eyebrow as he smiled softly. \u201cDo you want me to sit there?\u201d Peter bobbed his head, clearly glad that the man could easily tell what he wanted. Tony could feel his heart melt as he moved to sit in the chair. \u201cAlright, thanks for the seat, kiddo,\u201d</p><p>Peter bashfully bowed his head as he fidgeted with his blankets. From the closer angle Tony could observe some of the kid\u2019s finer features. He could see how the kid\u2019s eyelashes were long like his own and how slight freckles dotted his nose and cheeks. There was a light scar on the side of his chin and Tony couldn\u2019t help but wonder if it came from before or after his time with HYDRA.</p><p>Tony\u2019s eyes drifted to the bedside table at Peter\u2019s other side of the bed and noticed there was a small model Empire State Building made out of Lego blocks. \u201cYou build that?\u201d Tony asked, making sure to keep his voice warm and quiet. Peter looked up and nodded, a slight blush staining his cheeks as he continued to stare at his lap. \u201cWow, it looks really good! I couldn\u2019t have made a better one even if I tried.\u201d</p><p>It was an obvious lie and Tony internally winced at how forced his exclamation sounded. He wasn\u2019t used to interacting with kids, especially ones as young as Peter, so he didn\u2019t even have a baseline on what to say to the kid. Regardless of how stiff Tony sounded the kid started to uncurl on the bed, turning to face the man next to him. The boy bit his lip and pointed towards a box next to the Lego Empire State Building, looking hopefully up at Tony. The genius melted on the spot. </p><p>\u201cDo you want me to grab it?\u201d Another shy nod from the kid. \u201cAlright, hold on.\u201d Tony reached across the bed and grabbed the box, handing it over to Peter slowly so he wouldn\u2019t scare the kid. Peter took it and opened the box, showing the contents to the billionaire. Tony saw that the box was filled to the brim with various Lego pieces, blocks, and cars. The boy picked up a little orange sports car and started to spin its wheels as he cocked his head at Tony.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you thinking, kiddo?\u201d Tony asked and immediately wanted to smack himself. The doctor had told him the boy was practically mute after the trauma he had faced, why would he suddenly answer Tony of all people? </p><p>Peter blinked at the question before his eyes drifted to Tony\u2019s chest. He reached forwards and tried to touch the Arc Reactor. Reacting on instinct Tony flinched away, causing the boy to stiffen and pull his arm backwards, quickly lowering his head and looking as if he were waiting to get hit. Tony\u2019s heart clenched as he regarded the boy in regret. It seemed that Tony was doomed to continue to make stupid mistakes and keep scaring his kid away </p><p>\u201cSorry kid, you just\u2026 uh surprised me is all,\u201d Tony started. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to scare you. Can you please look at me again?\u201d</p><p>Peter gnawed at his lower lip but ultimately peered up at Tony. His previously bright eyes had dulled slightly as started to spin his car\u2019s wheels faster. Tony tried to offer him a soft and comforting smile. \u201cDo you want to see my Arc Reactor?\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widened but he didn\u2019t offer a nod or shake of his head. Reading the expression on the boy\u2019s face Tony assumed that the kid wanted to see the reactor but didn\u2019t want to admit it in case it made Tony upset. Taking a deep breath Tony decided to lower his shirt so the kid could look at the reactor clearly. </p><p>Tony tried not to squirm as the boy studied the Arc Reactor in silence. He wasn\u2019t exactly a fan of showing people what had basically kept him alive for the past year (and also what had very nearly killed him), but he swallowed the discomfort in order to make his son (still not freaking used to that) less apprehensive. </p><p>Peter lifted his eyes to meet Tony\u2019s gaze before he very slowly lifted the hand that wasn\u2019t holding the toy car. The kid cautiously reached to touch the Arc Reactor while still holding Tony\u2019s gaze. It was obvious that Peter was trying to give Tony a chance to move away again if he needed to, and that made the genius\u2019s previously cold heart flutter as he realized how empathetic his son was.</p><p>Tony allowed Peter to touch the Arc Reactor. He was expecting the child to push hard against it but instead Peter just lightly grazed his finger over the top of it. The kid smiled as he looked over the Arc Reactor before leaning back and away from the billionaire. Tony pulled up his shirt once he was sure the kid didn\u2019t want to continue to study the reactor. Smiling slightly he questioned, \u201cYou\u2019re a fan of Iron Man, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Peter grinned widely and motioned to a shelf on the opposite wall. From here Tony could barely make out a child\u2019s version of the Iron Man helmet, which for some reason looked vaguely familiar but Tony wasn\u2019t sure why. Tony couldn\u2019t stop his own grin from forming on his lips when he realized that his son was actually a fan of his alter ego. The idea made Tony feel warm inside.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess he is the best hero out there,\u201d Tony teased, causing the kid to giggle again as he continued to play with his toy car on the bed. Tony felt the last of the previous tension uncoil from his stomach as he decided that yes, his kid had the most adorable little giggle out there.</p><p>\u201cAnd why are you laughing?\u201d Tony asked in mock offense, making sure it was obvious that he was kidding by widening his smile. Peter looked up at him with starstruck eyes so Tony figured he was doing a good job of it. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe I\u2019m the best superhero, kiddo?\u201d</p><p>Peter rapidly shook his head, giggles growing louder. It was at that moment that Tony knew that he had fallen deeply in love with the boy in front of him, and that without even trying the kid had seamlessly wrapped the billionaire tightly around his finger. If the kid asked for the moon right then and there Tony would have probably called up the head of NASA to ask how to buy the moon just to keep that beautiful smile on his son\u2019s face. </p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes snapped to the door and before Tony could as if something was wrong he heard a soft knock. A second later Dr. Helames poked her head in the room. \u201cEverything ok in here, boys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony confirmed, shooting a small smile with Peter that the boy slowly returned. \u201cEverything\u2019s going great, doc, I think me and Petey here are getting along swimmingly.\u201d</p><p>Peter flushed and and lowered his head, but Tony could see the timid ghost of a smile on that precious little face. God, he was sounding so sappy but Tony didn\u2019t care; he absolutely already adored this kid with his whole heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that,\u201d Dr. Helames replied truthfully. \u201cBut unfortunately it\u2019s time for Peter to take a nap, he\u2019s still healing and the medication we have to give him will make him drowsy.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s expression completely changed at those words and he turned wide eyes towards Tony. The genius\u2019s chest tightened when he saw the honest distress in those doe-brown eyes, but he knew logically that the kid was still healing so he needed all the rest he could have. </p><p>Still, Tony reached a cautious hand to lay on Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t look so sad, kiddie, sleeps important. Or, at least I\u2019ve been told that,\u201d Tony gave an exaggerated eye roll, earning a watery giggle from Peter. \u201cHow about this: You take a nice nap, and I\u2019ll come visit you again really soon?\u201d</p><p>A tear slipped from Peter\u2019s eye and Tony, without even thinking about it, reached up to wipe it away. He froze, and was about to apologize until Peter leaned into Tony\u2019s hand against his cheek. The boy pursed his lips and held up a hand, pinky out.</p><p>Tony blinked and the realized what the kid meant. If possible his chest warmed even more as he asked, \u201cYou want me to pinky promise, kid?\u201d Peter nodded and stared at Tony wordlessly. \u201cFair enough, pinky promises are pretty unbreakable I guess.\u201d Tony moved his hand away from the kids face as he wrapped his pinky around Peter\u2019s much smaller one. The kid beamed up at him and Tony returned the expression. The kid put his little car back into the box and leaned away to put it on the bedside table.</p><p>Tony quietly stood up and watched as the kid got comfortable on the bed. The kid waved at him again so Tony waved back. \u201cSee you later, kiddo, have wonderful dreams.\u201d Peter watched owlishly as Tony went towards the door. The billionaire paused before he turned back to the kid. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really glad I got to meet you, kiddie, and I can\u2019t wait to see you again.\u201d The last thing Tony saw before he closed the door to his son\u2019s room was Peter\u2019s bright eyes. </p><p>Once the door was fully closed Tony leaned his forehead against the door as he closed his eyes, cementing his son\u2019s precious face in his mind.</p>",

If you would prefer, you can also read it on AO3 <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/18032402/chapters/43032233#workskin\">here</a>. Hope you enjoy reading it!</p>[[MORE]]<p>It was obvious that SHIELD\u2019s medical wing was not meant for young patients. Tony mentally scoffed when he saw someone had tried to hastily put up colorful posters and pictures on the walls in a sad attempt to make the usually stoic and sleek hallways appear more warm and cozy. </p><p>It was just Tony and the doctor walking down the corridor to Peter\u2019s room- Fury had left to continue to deal with the aftershocks of finding a still-operating HYDRA base. </p><p>Dr. Helames slowed down to stop in front of a door at the end of the dead end hallway. \u201cAnd here we are,\u201d She smiled, and Tony felt grateful that she didn\u2019t comment on his obviously-nervous appearance. \u201cI\u2019m going to go in with you but I\u2019ll step out once Peter feels comfortable enough with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Tony said, taking a deep breath. Part of him was begging to just bolt and never look back, but Tony locked those feelings up behind steel doors. He refused to be a coward and just abandon his child. He was not Howard Stark. </p><p>\u201cJust as a reminder, he does have enhanced senses so try to keep your voice low. We had to make his door and walls soundproof because he kept hearing noises from even outside of the base.\u201d</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t even know what to say towards that so instead he just nodded tightly. Dr. Helames smiled again, this time more understanding, before gently opening the door. </p><p>Once it was open enough she poked her head inside the room and in a soft voice called out, \u201cPeter? May I come in?\u201d She paused for a moment, obviously waiting for the kid to respond. He must have given a positive reaction because the doctor then asked, \u201cI also brought a friend to visit you, is it ok if he comes in?\u201d</p><p>This time the kid\u2019s response came out much more hesitant, but the doctor waited patiently. It was obvious that Dr. Helames was trying to allow Peter to have the chance to make choices for himself, which made sense; his captors hadn\u2019t most likely allowed the kid to make any decisions on what was happening to him. Tony mentally noted to give the kid choices for simple things in the future. </p><p>Tony shifted his weight as he waited for Peter\u2019s decision. If he was being honest with himself he hadn\u2019t even thought there was a chance that the kid would refuse to meet with him today. If Peter decided to send him away right now Tony wouldn\u2019t hold it against him- he clearly remembered how he barely wanted to meet with random people after returning home from his own kidnapping. Regardless, Tony had promised himself he wouldn\u2019t give up on the kid, and if there was one thing Stark men were good at it was keeping their promises.</p><p>Dr. Helames\u2019s grateful voice brought Tony out of his musings. \u201cPerfect, we\u2019re going to come in then,\u201d She said, opening the door wider to allow herself in. She turned back to look at Tony, who was still rooted in his spot just outside the room. She smiled reassuringly as she gestured with a tip of her head for him to come inside. Before Tony could talk himself out of it he squared his shoulders and joined her inside the room.</p><p>As much as Tony had been trying to prepare himself for this moment it seemed as if it were all in vein as he still felt his hands tremble and the air leave his lungs in a quick release as soon as he spotted the boy on the bed. The kid was absolutely tiny, smaller than what Tony had been expecting. The boy\u2019s hair was longer than in all the pictures Tony had seen previously, and it curled sweetly near the nape of his head. But what Tony couldn\u2019t help but notice most of all was how bright the kid\u2019s eyes were- and how they were the exact shade of Tony\u2019s own. </p><p>Peter had his head cocked to the side in obvious confusion and with a hint of fear.

Great job, genius</i>, he berated himself.</p><p>He forced himself to stop staring and instead glanced around the room. With a quirk of his lips he commented, \u201cNot exactly a five star hotel, huh?\u201d</p><p>His heart almost came to a stop when the kid gave the most delicate giggle he ever heard. Peter looked up to meet Tony\u2019s eyes as he smiled timidly.

The idea made Tony feel warm inside.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess he is the best hero out there,\u201d Tony teased, causing the kid to giggle again as he continued to play with his toy car on the bed. Tony felt the last of the previous tension uncoil from his stomach as he decided that yes, his kid had the most adorable little giggle out there.</p><p>\u201cAnd why are you laughing?\u201d Tony asked in mock offense, making sure it was obvious that he was kidding by widening his smile. Peter looked up at him with starstruck eyes so Tony figured he was doing a good job of it. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe I\u2019m the best superhero, kiddo?\u201d</p><p>Peter rapidly shook his head, giggles growing louder. It was at that moment that Tony knew that he had fallen deeply in love with the boy in front of him, and that without even trying the kid had seamlessly wrapped the billionaire tightly around his finger. If the kid asked for the moon right then and there Tony would have probably called up the head of NASA to ask how to buy the moon just to keep that beautiful smile on his son\u2019s face. </p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes snapped to the door and before Tony could as if something was wrong he heard a soft knock. A second later Dr. Helames poked her head in the room. \u201cEverything ok in here, boys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony confirmed, shooting a small smile with Peter that the boy slowly returned. \u201cEverything\u2019s going great, doc, I think me and Petey here are getting along swimmingly.\u201d</p><p>Peter flushed and and lowered his head, but Tony could see the timid ghost of a smile on that precious little face. God, he was sounding so sappy but Tony didn\u2019t care; he absolutely already adored this kid with his whole heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that,\u201d Dr. Helames replied truthfully. \u201cBut unfortunately it\u2019s time for Peter to take a nap, he\u2019s still healing and the medication we have to give him will make him drowsy.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s expression completely changed at those words and he turned wide eyes towards Tony. The genius\u2019s chest tightened when he saw the honest distress in those doe-brown eyes, but he knew logically that the kid was still healing so he needed all the rest he could have. </p><p>Still, Tony reached a cautious hand to lay on Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t look so sad, kiddie, sleeps important. Or, at least I\u2019ve been told that,\u201d Tony gave an exaggerated eye roll, earning a watery giggle from Peter. \u201cHow about this: You take a nice nap, and I\u2019ll come visit you again really soon?\u201d</p><p>A tear slipped from Peter\u2019s eye and Tony, without even thinking about it, reached up to wipe it away. He froze, and was about to apologize until Peter leaned into Tony\u2019s hand against his cheek. The boy pursed his lips and held up a hand, pinky out.</p><p>Tony blinked and the realized what the kid meant. If possible his chest warmed even more as he asked, \u201cYou want me to pinky promise, kid?\u201d Peter nodded and stared at Tony wordlessly. \u201cFair enough, pinky promises are pretty unbreakable I guess.\u201d Tony moved his hand away from the kids face as he wrapped his pinky around Peter\u2019s much smaller one. The kid beamed up at him and Tony returned the expression. The kid put his little car back into the box and leaned away to put it on the bedside table.</p><p>Tony quietly stood up and watched as the kid got comfortable on the bed. The kid waved at him again so Tony waved back. \u201cSee you later, kiddo, have wonderful dreams.\u201d Peter watched owlishly as Tony went towards the door. The billionaire paused before he turned back to the kid. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really glad I got to meet you, kiddie, and I can\u2019t wait to see you again.\u201d The last thing Tony saw before he closed the door to his son\u2019s room was Peter\u2019s bright eyes. </p><p>Once the door was fully closed Tony leaned his forehead against the door as he closed his eyes, cementing his son\u2019s precious face in his mind.</p>",
                "content": "<p>In which we are finally introduced to Peter! If you would prefer, you can also read it on AO3 <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/18032402/chapters/43032233#workskin\">here</a>. Hope you enjoy reading it!</p><p>It was obvious that SHIELD&rsquo;s medical wing was not meant for young patients. Tony mentally scoffed when he saw someone had tried to hastily put up colorful posters and pictures on the walls in a sad attempt to make the usually stoic and sleek hallways appear more warm and cozy. </p><p>It was just Tony and the doctor walking down the corridor to Peter&rsquo;s room- Fury had left to continue to deal with the aftershocks of finding a still-operating HYDRA base. </p><p>Dr. Helames slowed down to stop in front of a door at the end of the dead end hallway. &ldquo;And here we are,&rdquo; She smiled, and Tony felt grateful that she didn&rsquo;t comment on his obviously-nervous appearance. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go in with you but I&rsquo;ll step out once Peter feels comfortable enough with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Tony said, taking a deep breath. Part of him was begging to just bolt and never look back, but Tony locked those feelings up behind steel doors. He refused to be a coward and just abandon his child. He was not Howard Stark. </p><p>&ldquo;Just as a reminder, he does have enhanced senses so try to keep your voice low. We had to make his door and walls soundproof because he kept hearing noises from even outside of the base.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony didn&rsquo;t even know what to say towards that so instead he just nodded tightly. Dr. Helames smiled again, this time more understanding, before gently opening the door. </p><p>Once it was open enough she poked her head inside the room and in a soft voice called out, &ldquo;Peter? May I come in?&rdquo; She paused for a moment, obviously waiting for the kid to respond. He must have given a positive reaction because the doctor then asked, &ldquo;I also brought a friend to visit you, is it ok if he comes in?&rdquo;</p><p>This time the kid&rsquo;s response came out much more hesitant, but the doctor waited patiently. It was obvious that Dr. Helames was trying to allow Peter to have the chance to make choices for himself, which made sense; his captors hadn&rsquo;t most likely allowed the kid to make any decisions on what was happening to him. Tony mentally noted to give the kid choices for simple things in the future. </p><p>Tony shifted his weight as he waited for Peter&rsquo;s decision. If he was being honest with himself he hadn&rsquo;t even thought there was a chance that the kid would refuse to meet with him today. If Peter decided to send him away right now Tony wouldn&rsquo;t hold it against him- he clearly remembered how he barely wanted to meet with random people after returning home from his own kidnapping. Regardless, Tony had promised himself he wouldn&rsquo;t give up on the kid, and if there was one thing Stark men were good at it was keeping their promises.</p><p>Dr. Helames&rsquo;s grateful voice brought Tony out of his musings. &ldquo;Perfect, we&rsquo;re going to come in then,&rdquo; She said, opening the door wider to allow herself in. She turned back to look at Tony, who was still rooted in his spot just outside the room. She smiled reassuringly as she gestured with a tip of her head for him to come inside. Before Tony could talk himself out of it he squared his shoulders and joined her inside the room.</p><p>As much as Tony had been trying to prepare himself for this moment it seemed as if it were all in vein as he still felt his hands tremble and the air leave his lungs in a quick release as soon as he spotted the boy on the bed. The kid was absolutely tiny, smaller than what Tony had been expecting. The boy&rsquo;s hair was longer than in all the pictures Tony had seen previously, and it curled sweetly near the nape of his head. But what Tony couldn&rsquo;t help but notice most of all was how bright the kid&rsquo;s eyes were- and how they were the exact shade of Tony&rsquo;s own. </p><p>Peter had his head cocked to the side in obvious confusion and with a hint of fear. He looked quickly between Dr. Helames and Tony, before deciding to settle his gaze on the stranger in front of him. Tony knew the exact moment that Peter seemed to recognize him when he saw the kid&rsquo;s eyes widen while he sucked in a quick gasp.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, I&rsquo;d like you to meet a good friend of mine,&rdquo; Dr. Helames announced but Tony didn&rsquo;t even spare a glance at her; his gaze was stuck firmly on the little boy in front of him who looked seconds away from bolting. &ldquo;This is Tony Stark. Tony, this is Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;H-hey kid,&rdquo; Tony stuttered out, and part of him was embarrassed at how emotional he sounded in front of the doctor. However, a bigger part of him could care less how he sounded because he was finally meeting his son! Maybe it was creepy but Tony couldn&rsquo;t stop staring at the kid. He drank in every feature of the boy as if he were about to go blind; he tried to memorize every little detail the kid&rsquo;s face while he silently realized that holy crap! Tony had somehow helped make this beautiful, perfect creature in front of him. The genius was usually proud of the things he created and invented but he could already tell that the title for his best (greatest) creation would always belong to the tiny boy in front of him.</p><p>Tony watched in trepidation as the boy raised a small hand and waved hesitantly. Tony felt a watery smile on his lips as he waved back. </p><p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; Dr. Helames said, snapping the boys attention back to her for a moment. &ldquo;I have to go check on other patients, but is it ok if Mr. Stark here keeps you company until I come back?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony was expecting more hesitation from Peter but was surprised when the kid nodded eagerly, eyes much brighter if that was even possible. Dr. Helames beamed. &ldquo;Perfect! Then I&rsquo;ll be back in a few minutes.&rdquo; And with that she silently exited the room, but not before shooting Tony a small wink. Tony turned back towards the kid when he heard the door click shut behind him.</p><p>The room lapsed into an awkward silence as the kid nervously fixed his eyes down to his blanketed lap while Tony just continued to gaze at the boy. He saw the kid&rsquo;s eyes peek up shyly before shooting back down towards his lap when he saw that the man was still staring at him. Tony internally groaned. <i>Great, not even five full minutes and I&rsquo;m already scaring my kid. Great job, genius</i>, he berated himself.</p><p>He forced himself to stop staring and instead glanced around the room. With a quirk of his lips he commented, &ldquo;Not exactly a five star hotel, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>His heart almost came to a stop when the kid gave the most delicate giggle he ever heard. Peter looked up to meet Tony&rsquo;s eyes as he smiled timidly. He pointed a finger towards a chair next to the bed as he stared imploringly at Tony. </p><p>The billionaire raised an eyebrow as he smiled softly. &ldquo;Do you want me to sit there?&rdquo; Peter bobbed his head, clearly glad that the man could easily tell what he wanted. Tony could feel his heart melt as he moved to sit in the chair. &ldquo;Alright, thanks for the seat, kiddo,&rdquo;</p><p>Peter bashfully bowed his head as he fidgeted with his blankets. From the closer angle Tony could observe some of the kid&rsquo;s finer features. He could see how the kid&rsquo;s eyelashes were long like his own and how slight freckles dotted his nose and cheeks. There was a light scar on the side of his chin and Tony couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder if it came from before or after his time with HYDRA.</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s eyes drifted to the bedside table at Peter&rsquo;s other side of the bed and noticed there was a small model Empire State Building made out of Lego blocks. &ldquo;You build that?&rdquo; Tony asked, making sure to keep his voice warm and quiet. Peter looked up and nodded, a slight blush staining his cheeks as he continued to stare at his lap. &ldquo;Wow, it looks really good! I couldn&rsquo;t have made a better one even if I tried.&rdquo;</p><p>It was an obvious lie and Tony internally winced at how forced his exclamation sounded. He wasn&rsquo;t used to interacting with kids, especially ones as young as Peter, so he didn&rsquo;t even have a baseline on what to say to the kid. Regardless of how stiff Tony sounded the kid started to uncurl on the bed, turning to face the man next to him. The boy bit his lip and pointed towards a box next to the Lego Empire State Building, looking hopefully up at Tony. The genius melted on the spot. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you want me to grab it?&rdquo; Another shy nod from the kid. &ldquo;Alright, hold on.&rdquo; Tony reached across the bed and grabbed the box, handing it over to Peter slowly so he wouldn&rsquo;t scare the kid. Peter took it and opened the box, showing the contents to the billionaire. Tony saw that the box was filled to the brim with various Lego pieces, blocks, and cars. The boy picked up a little orange sports car and started to spin its wheels as he cocked his head at Tony.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;re you thinking, kiddo?&rdquo; Tony asked and immediately wanted to smack himself. The doctor had told him the boy was practically mute after the trauma he had faced, why would he suddenly answer Tony of all people? </p><p>Peter blinked at the question before his eyes drifted to Tony&rsquo;s chest. He reached forwards and tried to touch the Arc Reactor. Reacting on instinct Tony flinched away, causing the boy to stiffen and pull his arm backwards, quickly lowering his head and looking as if he were waiting to get hit. Tony&rsquo;s heart clenched as he regarded the boy in regret. It seemed that Tony was doomed to continue to make stupid mistakes and keep scaring his kid away </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry kid, you just&hellip; uh surprised me is all,&rdquo; Tony started. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I didn&rsquo;t mean to scare you. Can you please look at me again?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter gnawed at his lower lip but ultimately peered up at Tony. His previously bright eyes had dulled slightly as started to spin his car&rsquo;s wheels faster. Tony tried to offer him a soft and comforting smile. &ldquo;Do you want to see my Arc Reactor?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes widened but he didn&rsquo;t offer a nod or shake of his head. Reading the expression on the boy&rsquo;s face Tony assumed that the kid wanted to see the reactor but didn&rsquo;t want to admit it in case it made Tony upset. Taking a deep breath Tony decided to lower his shirt so the kid could look at the reactor clearly. </p><p>Tony tried not to squirm as the boy studied the Arc Reactor in silence. He wasn&rsquo;t exactly a fan of showing people what had basically kept him alive for the past year (and also what had very nearly killed him), but he swallowed the discomfort in order to make his son (still not freaking used to that) less apprehensive. </p><p>Peter lifted his eyes to meet Tony&rsquo;s gaze before he very slowly lifted the hand that wasn&rsquo;t holding the toy car. The kid cautiously reached to touch the Arc Reactor while still holding Tony&rsquo;s gaze. It was obvious that Peter was trying to give Tony a chance to move away again if he needed to, and that made the genius&rsquo;s previously cold heart flutter as he realized how empathetic his son was.</p><p>Tony allowed Peter to touch the Arc Reactor. He was expecting the child to push hard against it but instead Peter just lightly grazed his finger over the top of it. The kid smiled as he looked over the Arc Reactor before leaning back and away from the billionaire. Tony pulled up his shirt once he was sure the kid didn&rsquo;t want to continue to study the reactor. Smiling slightly he questioned, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fan of Iron Man, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter grinned widely and motioned to a shelf on the opposite wall. From here Tony could barely make out a child&rsquo;s version of the Iron Man helmet, which for some reason looked vaguely familiar but Tony wasn&rsquo;t sure why. Tony couldn&rsquo;t stop his own grin from forming on his lips when he realized that his son was actually a fan of his alter ego. The idea made Tony feel warm inside.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I guess he is the best hero out there,&rdquo; Tony teased, causing the kid to giggle again as he continued to play with his toy car on the bed.

It was at that moment that Tony knew that he had fallen deeply in love with the boy in front of him, and that without even trying the kid had seamlessly wrapped the billionaire tightly around his finger.
