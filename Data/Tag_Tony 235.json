Treads watchfully along glassy corridors and\ncrosses deadly silences, climbs stairs and unnecessarily recognises elements designed\nfor specific Avengers he&rsquo;s encountered before. Meets no resistance from the moment\nof entering the building. Explores systematically, from the lowest underground floors\nlined with motionless or disinterested robotics. Heading upwards, he pockets a few\npeculiar items, none of those found in Midgard among natural circumstances. Stops\non Floor +6, marked with the general symbolic &lsquo;A&rsquo; on the elevator&rsquo;s number plate.\nHe stands in a dim, window-lit hall with crystal-smooth floor, leather sofas and\na bar at the other end. Abandons the last bits of aloofness based on former experience\nat a very similar place. His steps don&rsquo;t stir the prince awake. If he&rsquo;s dead, as\nthe stench indicates, it can&rsquo;t have been for a long time because blood is still\nvivid under his skin on the cheeks, nose, closed eyes. He&rsquo;s lying spread on the\nfloor, jeans and T-shirt sweated through, hair inches longer than last seen, but\ncheeks perfectly shaved. It seems like that&rsquo;s the only thing he still gave a damn\nabout while conscious, and the former content of the countless glass bottles and\ncans scattered on tables, plants, shelves. </p><p>Loki deems the tip of his boot enough to stain,\nso he uses it to turn the man&rsquo;s head to the side experimentally. Just as he thought,\nrigor mortis hasn&rsquo;t set in yet. He makes sure by turning it the other way with his\nheel. </p><p>Stark curses at the assault against his nose and\nmouth. Straightening his neck, he takes time before peeking out into the weak but\nkiller light through a curtain of eyelashes. </p><p>&ldquo;Care for a drink?&rdquo; he inquires already,\nthough he can&rsquo;t see his guest enough yet to identify him. He clambers up to an elbow,\nrepeatedly. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pass, thank you,&rdquo; the sorcerer responds\nwhile pulling up the billionaire by the upper arm, intending to drag him to the\nopen conveniently like this. </p><p>&ldquo;I have great Burgundy back there, y'know,&rdquo;\nStark notes, giving emphasis by an index finger held into the other&rsquo;s face. And\nwhen he stops squinting at that finger, he frowns in recognition. &ldquo;Loki!&rdquo;\nAnd then: &ldquo;F.R.I.D.A.Y?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>The sorcerer, still holding his grip, follows Stark&rsquo;s\nexample of glancing around. But nothing happens, the needed saviour doesn&rsquo;t heed\nthe call. Alcohol enhances the purity of the billionaire&rsquo;s dismay. </p><p>&quot;Drinks,&rdquo; he remembers abruptly and attempts\nto stumble backwards from the captivity.</p><p>&ldquo;None of your drinks are better than\nwater to a god,&rdquo; Loki informs him while he tugs on the arm to keep the man\non his feet. </p><p>&ldquo;God, I&rsquo;ll have a few select words to, once\nI make it there,&rdquo; Tony says. &ldquo;But before that, you&rsquo;ll have to give me\na chance to prove you wrong. As man to man. You&rsquo;ll see how much you&rsquo;ve got to learn\nabout the drinks of Midgard.&rdquo; </p><p>Loki yields and follows him silently, watches the\nclumsy clinking of bottles that cover the entire mirror-wall behind the counter,\nand the fiddling with two laboriously snatched glasses. After Stark drenches both\nglasses and the table top in the chosen liquid, the sorcerer takes the bottle out\nof his hand and puts it to his mouth. </p><p>&ldquo;Show-off,&rdquo; the billionaire observes before\ngulping down the fiery fluid from his glass, then from the other one. &ldquo;Have\nyou also tried drowning your sorrow in booze? Did you notice that bitch is a damn\ngood swimmer? I heard you&rsquo;re also left behind by all your own kin.&rdquo; \u00a0</p><p>The drink really has no greater effect than water,\nLoki learns during the tactless comment. The half empty bottle hits the counter\nwith a loud thud. </p><p>&ldquo;I\u2019m here to take you out of here. Let&rsquo;s go,\ntime&rsquo;s ticking.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony&rsquo;s face darkens at that, but his slurred tone\nremains light. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got plenty of time, exactly a lifetime\nmore than I want. And you are no different, god,&rdquo; he responds, lifting the\nbottle to his lips. </p><p>Loki takes it out of his hand and throws it away;\nit smashes into the ground with a sharp, splintering noise. </p><p>&ldquo;Time to go, babbler,&rdquo; he repeats and\nreaches for the other&rsquo;s arm over the counter. </p><p>The billionaire huffs while reeling away from the\ncaptivity, amused. He turns back to the mirror shelves and blindly lifts off another\nbottle. </p><p>&ldquo;Take me, if you can.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re challenging me?&rdquo; Loki&rsquo;s surprise\nis overwhelming, the notion is quite unconscious as he twists the bottle out of\nthe disoriented fingers and sends it on a short flight. Tony grins with the bottle\nopener left in his hand. \u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Been in a while, if you haven&rsquo;t noticed. It&rsquo;s\nwhat drunkards do.&rdquo; </p><p>And he reaches for another drink. He loses it the\nsame way. Next time he turns, the entire wall collapses into a pool of splinters\nand drinks on the floor. It goes with an ear-splitting noise but no harm is done\nto the billionaire, he merely blinks in surprise and wades ankle-high in the precious\nfluids as he backs away from the sorcerer suddenly next to him. He attacks or defends\nwith the opener in his hand, his wrist is caught and twisted before he&rsquo;d figure\nout which one it is. He yelps and backs up from the pain, but Loki steps after him,\nfingertips of his free hand lie over the glowing triangle on the billionaire&rsquo;s chest.\n</p><p>&ldquo;And what in Heavens is this abomination anyway?\nWhere&rsquo;s your heart?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s none,&rdquo; Tony lies with an empty\nstare at him, but he finds it truer now than ever. </p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there? What&rsquo;s in its place then?&rdquo;\n</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Nothing?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Are you not human?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe not.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;How about here?&rdquo; </p><p>Tony holds his breath from the unnerving sensation\nas cool fingers slide onto his aching forehead and a foreign presence invades his\nmind. Memories gush forth, a coarsely edited film of his life. His freshest pains\nburn the deepest. Unable to think words, he roars inarticulately in a desire to\nget rid of them. </p><p>Loki&rsquo;s face shows confusion against the billionaire&rsquo;s\ntorment. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not artificial anywhere. You&rsquo;re all\nyou.&rdquo; </p><p>He wants to ask why Stark denied that, but the shock\ntook its toll on the alcohol-infused body. As blood rapidly drains from the man&rsquo;s\nface, Loki grabs hold of the shirt, catching up his fall. Held by that one clothing,\nhe drags the semi-conscious corpse around the counter and towards the centre of\nthe room. With a skilful switch of hands, he turns him onto his stomach, and holding\nhim the same way by the back of the shirt, he leans the jaw to a large flower pot\nas considerately as he can. </p><p>Before his neck could twist back and break, Tony&rsquo;s\nhands hold his torso up, and while Loki releases him, he clambers higher over the\nedge of the pot and lets the burning bitter-sour fluid leave through his gutter.\nIt doesn&rsquo;t have much thickness, he&rsquo;s forgotten the last time he ate something. </p><p>Minutes pass while the god walks aimlessly at a\npolite distance and Tony&rsquo;s arm embraces the thin crust of the mango tree, resting\nhis forehead against it, relishing the terrible sensation of sobering out. </p><p>&ldquo;Ready to leave?&rdquo; Loki inquires then.\n</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to die. Give me back my drinks,\nyou stuck-up jerk,\u201d Tony mumbles in a voice way too smooth for his words. &quot;God,\nI miss F.R.I.D.A.Y.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Man&rsquo;s best friend. Fits your moods, helps\nin need, only comes when called. No, the latter&rsquo;s not true, she can be an annoying\nwhore at times. Must have turned her off at some point.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Is she your spouse?&rdquo; </p><p>Tony huffs quietly before answering. </p><p>&ldquo;She should&rsquo;ve been.&rdquo; He clambers up onto\nthe nearest sofa, turning towards the backrest. &ldquo;She should&rsquo;ve been my spouse\ninstead, then all would be fine now.&rdquo; </p><p>Loki frowns at the notion and walks back towards\nhim. </p><p>&ldquo;You\u2019ll get to rest later. Don&rsquo;t make me\ndrag you out by a leg.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Get the fuck out, god of clowns, save the\nothers from me spitting into their faces. They can&rsquo;t leave a man to mourn in peace.&rdquo;\n</p><p>It&rsquo;s getting longer than a quick favour, Loki&rsquo;s\npatience is running out. He stops for one last warning with his best intentions.\n</p><p>&ldquo;Anthony, is it?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Your fat ass mother it is.&rdquo; </p><p>His eyebrows run up. </p><p>&ldquo;In fact, she was a woman of much refined appearance.&rdquo;\n</p><p>That makes Anthony laugh, a semi-willed hiss that\ngrows into a roar of laughter. When it\u2019s over, he says: </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;re as ignorant as your\nbrother. He was quite usable in a fight, but in terms of perception, he wasn&rsquo;t\nthe brightest. He went after his own nose like the world was a single straight\nline. He&rsquo;s the saviour of the Universe and all that shit, and we loved him even\nbefore that, but he was still a dumbass. A Point Break. A big, sturdy ox with restraints\nway worse than the Hulk.&rdquo; </p><p>Loki smiles then, perhaps for the first time since\nhis return without having control over it. Because Thor is always raised on a pedestal,\nadmired as a flawless being, but here, he just realises, this wretched man sees\nhim as he was in truth, as Loki sees him, as the brother he loves him. The Thor\nhe knows exists for this man. And that makes Loki feel less alone, and grateful\nto him. A sensation long missed like air after a dive. </p><p>So he sits down on the other coach to listen, because\nhe feels in debt. </p><p>And as Tony&rsquo;s disorganised, slurred, half-awake\nblabbers go on and retell the memories Loki has just witnessed as an outsider, he\ngrows aware of how similar their pain is. How similar their helpless, senseless, still\nstubbornly scorching rage is against the unalterable. For this moment, he sees that\na being this much measlier than a god harbours passion of the same magnitude as\nhimself. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very broken, Anthony,&rdquo; he\nconcludes. </p><p>&ldquo;Broken? I&rsquo;m shattered. Haven&rsquo;t been in this\nmany pieces since my first crack at high school.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed that falling apart is a\ncommon habit of earthlings. But isn&rsquo;t it time to man up again already? I reckon\nit&rsquo;s been three years.&rdquo; <a></a></p><p>The human bursts out: </p><p>&ldquo;I faced May!&rdquo; he roars, a fist\nhitting the backrest while he sits up, feet landing on the floor. &ldquo;I faced the kid&rsquo;s aunt! I did! I\ndidn&rsquo;t back out! Isn&rsquo;t that enough?&rdquo; </p><p>Loki knows no kid or aunt, but he sees the\nshiver run through the man&rsquo;s body, and he knows that the act he speaks about was something out of his\nboundaries. </p><p>&ldquo;How is that not a shitload more than enough?&rdquo;\nTony weeps. And weeps. And Loki sits over to hold his miserable, stinking\ncarcass, because the shards threaten to fall apart, and because this little human\nhas lost an entire world like Loki did, and he sees Thor the way Loki does, and\nhe used to wield skills enough to be a threat for him, and now nothing that&rsquo;s\ntangible about him is really him, he is nothing to this world, he has lost his ties\nand he belongs nowhere among the hands reaching for him blindly, he is nothing,\nnothing real to anyone, just like Loki. Only Loki has learnt how to be this\nnothing, and this man has yet to brave it. He still talks about the remaining\nhumans like he matters. </p><p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; Loki lets him know. &ldquo;So\nthe toil is over. The next step is to stand up.&rdquo; </p><p>The response is a snarl: </p><p>&ldquo;What for, genius?&rdquo; </p><p>The general denseness of humans keeps\nsurprising the sorcerer. Fifteen hundred years, and he still can&rsquo;t see the qualities\nThor used to praise in them. But he&rsquo;s very adaptive, so his tone doesn&rsquo;t reveal\nhis honest curiosity. </p><p>&ldquo;What else will you spend the rest of your\nlife with? Or do you consider it an option to sit and mope? No chance of looking\naround for something more entertaining you could spend all these years with?&rdquo;\n</p><p>The silence stretches long before Tony answers.\n</p><p>&ldquo;God, you&rsquo;re appalling. I hate you.&rdquo; </p><p>Loki tells the lack of resistance in the answer,\nand he pats the back of the man&rsquo;s neck. </p><p>&ldquo;Time to take on the world.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No, stay a bit. I&rsquo;m&hellip; off-balance. In my\nsitting, too. I&rsquo;ll fall off of here without a prop.&rdquo; </p><p>So they stay like that, motionless. </p><p>&ldquo;How much longer?&rdquo; Loki inquires\nafter a minute. </p><p>&ldquo;Little bit.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you myself,&rdquo; he decides, but\nTony&rsquo;s answer stops his movement. </p><p>&ldquo;Nothing more to lose, so I&rsquo;ll be honest. I\u2019m shitting bricks now. Don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m ready to face anyone who knew me, which practically\nincludes all of humanity.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You never will be,&rdquo; Loki assures him\nfrom personal experience. And he watches the man&rsquo;s profile, until he inhales\ndeeply and stirs into motion under the gaze. </p><p>He walks steadier than he claimed, his head bent.\nLoki holds his shoulders with an arm while they find the way out. Approaching\nthe main entrance, a flick of his free wrist camouflages the smell and unkempt\nappearance of the billionaire. </p><p>&ldquo;Sunglasses too,&rdquo; Tony mumbles. His\nwish is fulfilled. </p><p>Then the door slides aside, and they step out\ninto the blinding sunlight. <br/></p><hr><p><a href=\"https://intensitystoner.tumblr.com/post/184383283775/scribbles-continuing-the-heart-of-anthony-kinda\" target=\"_blank\">Part 2</a> <br/></p>",

After Stark drenches both\nglasses and the table top in the chosen liquid, the sorcerer takes the bottle out\nof his hand and puts it to his mouth. </p><p>\u201cShow-off,\u201d the billionaire observes before\ngulping down the fiery fluid from his glass, then from the other one. \u201cHave\nyou also tried drowning your sorrow in booze? Did you notice that bitch is a damn\ngood swimmer? I heard you\u2019re also left behind by all your own kin.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>The drink really has no greater effect than water,\nLoki learns during the tactless comment. The half empty bottle hits the counter\nwith a loud thud. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to take you out of here. Let\u2019s go,\ntime\u2019s ticking.\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s face darkens at that, but his slurred tone\nremains light. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got plenty of time, exactly a lifetime\nmore than I want. And you are no different, god,\u201d he responds, lifting the\nbottle to his lips. </p><p>Loki takes it out of his hand and throws it away;\nit smashes into the ground with a sharp, splintering noise. </p><p>\u201cTime to go, babbler,\u201d he repeats and\nreaches for the other\u2019s arm over the counter. </p><p>The billionaire huffs while reeling away from the\ncaptivity, amused. He turns back to the mirror shelves and blindly lifts off another\nbottle. </p><p>\u201cTake me, if you can.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re challenging me?\u201d Loki\u2019s surprise\nis overwhelming, the notion is quite unconscious as he twists the bottle out of\nthe disoriented fingers and sends it on a short flight. Tony grins with the bottle\nopener left in his hand. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cBeen in a while, if you haven\u2019t noticed. It\u2019s\nwhat drunkards do.\u201d </p><p>And he reaches for another drink. He loses it the\nsame way. Next time he turns, the entire wall collapses into a pool of splinters\nand drinks on the floor. It goes with an ear-splitting noise but no harm is done\nto the billionaire, he merely blinks in surprise and wades ankle-high in the precious\nfluids as he backs away from the sorcerer suddenly next to him. He attacks or defends\nwith the opener in his hand, his wrist is caught and twisted before he\u2019d figure\nout which one it is. He yelps and backs up from the pain, but Loki steps after him,\nfingertips of his free hand lie over the glowing triangle on the billionaire\u2019s chest.\n</p><p>\u201cAnd what in Heavens is this abomination anyway?\nWhere\u2019s your heart?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s none,\u201d Tony lies with an empty\nstare at him, but he finds it truer now than ever. </p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there? What\u2019s in its place then?\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNothing?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre you not human?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMaybe not.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow about here?\u201d </p><p>Tony holds his breath from the unnerving sensation\nas cool fingers slide onto his aching forehead and a foreign presence invades his\nmind. Memories gush forth, a coarsely edited film of his life. His freshest pains\nburn the deepest. Unable to think words, he roars inarticulately in a desire to\nget rid of them. </p><p>Loki\u2019s face shows confusion against the billionaire\u2019s\ntorment. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not artificial anywhere. You\u2019re all\nyou.\u201d </p><p>He wants to ask why Stark denied that, but the shock\ntook its toll on the alcohol-infused body. As blood rapidly drains from the man\u2019s\nface, Loki grabs hold of the shirt, catching up his fall. Held by that one clothing,\nhe drags the semi-conscious corpse around the counter and towards the centre of\nthe room. With a skilful switch of hands, he turns him onto his stomach, and holding\nhim the same way by the back of the shirt, he leans the jaw to a large flower pot\nas considerately as he can. </p><p>Before his neck could twist back and break, Tony\u2019s\nhands hold his torso up, and while Loki releases him, he clambers higher over the\nedge of the pot and lets the burning bitter-sour fluid leave through his gutter.\nIt doesn\u2019t have much thickness, he\u2019s forgotten the last time he ate something. </p><p>Minutes pass while the god walks aimlessly at a\npolite distance and Tony\u2019s arm embraces the thin crust of the mango tree, resting\nhis forehead against it, relishing the terrible sensation of sobering out. </p><p>\u201cReady to leave?\u201d Loki inquires then.\n</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to die. Give me back my drinks,\nyou stuck-up jerk,\u201d Tony mumbles in a voice way too smooth for his words. \"God,\nI miss F.R.I.D.A.Y.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMan\u2019s best friend. Fits your moods, helps\nin need, only comes when called. No, the latter\u2019s not true, she can be an annoying\nwhore at times. Must have turned her off at some point.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIs she your spouse?\u201d </p><p>Tony huffs quietly before answering. </p><p>\u201cShe should\u2019ve been.\u201d He clambers up onto\nthe nearest sofa, turning towards the backrest. \u201cShe should\u2019ve been my spouse\ninstead, then all would be fine now.\u201d </p><p>Loki frowns at the notion and walks back towards\nhim. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get to rest later. Don\u2019t make me\ndrag you out by a leg.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGet the fuck out, god of clowns, save the\nothers from me spitting into their faces. They can\u2019t leave a man to mourn in peace.\u201d\n</p><p>It\u2019s getting longer than a quick favour, Loki\u2019s\npatience is running out. He stops for one last warning with his best intentions.\n</p><p>\u201cAnthony, is it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYour fat ass mother it is.\u201d </p><p>His eyebrows run up. </p><p>\u201cIn fact, she was a woman of much refined appearance.\u201d\n</p><p>That makes Anthony laugh, a semi-willed hiss that\ngrows into a roar of laughter. When it\u2019s over, he says: </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re as ignorant as your\nbrother. He was quite usable in a fight, but in terms of perception, he wasn\u2019t\nthe brightest. He went after his own nose like the world was a single straight\nline. He\u2019s the saviour of the Universe and all that shit, and we loved him even\nbefore that, but he was still a dumbass. A Point Break. A big, sturdy ox with restraints\nway worse than the Hulk.\u201d </p><p>Loki smiles then, perhaps for the first time since\nhis return without having control over it. Because Thor is always raised on a pedestal,\nadmired as a flawless being, but here, he just realises, this wretched man sees\nhim as he was in truth, as Loki sees him, as the brother he loves him. The Thor\nhe knows exists for this man. And that makes Loki feel less alone, and grateful\nto him. A sensation long missed like air after a dive. </p><p>So he sits down on the other coach to listen, because\nhe feels in debt. </p><p>And as Tony\u2019s disorganised, slurred, half-awake\nblabbers go on and retell the memories Loki has just witnessed as an outsider, he\ngrows aware of how similar their pain is. How similar their helpless, senseless, still\nstubbornly scorching rage is against the unalterable. For this moment, he sees that\na being this much measlier than a god harbours passion of the same magnitude as\nhimself. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very broken, Anthony,\u201d he\nconcludes. </p><p>\u201cBroken? I\u2019m shattered. Haven\u2019t been in this\nmany pieces since my first crack at high school.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve noticed that falling apart is a\ncommon habit of earthlings. But isn\u2019t it time to man up again already? I reckon\nit\u2019s been three years.\u201d <a></a></p><p>The human bursts out: </p><p>\u201cI faced May!\u201d he roars, a fist\nhitting the backrest while he sits up, feet landing on the floor. \u201cI faced the kid\u2019s aunt! I did! I\ndidn\u2019t back out! Isn\u2019t that enough?\u201d </p><p>Loki knows no kid or aunt, but he sees the\nshiver run through the man\u2019s body, and he knows that the act he speaks about was something out of his\nboundaries. </p><p>\u201cHow is that not a shitload more than enough?\u201d\nTony weeps. And weeps. And Loki sits over to hold his miserable, stinking\ncarcass, because the shards threaten to fall apart, and because this little human\nhas lost an entire world like Loki did, and he sees Thor the way Loki does, and\nhe used to wield skills enough to be a threat for him, and now nothing that\u2019s\ntangible about him is really him, he is nothing to this world, he has lost his ties\nand he belongs nowhere among the hands reaching for him blindly, he is nothing,\nnothing real to anyone, just like Loki. Only Loki has learnt how to be this\nnothing, and this man has yet to brave it. He still talks about the remaining\nhumans like he matters. </p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Loki lets him know. \u201cSo\nthe toil is over. The next step is to stand up.\u201d </p><p>The response is a snarl: </p><p>\u201cWhat for, genius?\u201d </p><p>The general denseness of humans keeps\nsurprising the sorcerer. Fifteen hundred years, and he still can\u2019t see the qualities\nThor used to praise in them. But he\u2019s very adaptive, so his tone doesn\u2019t reveal\nhis honest curiosity. </p><p>\u201cWhat else will you spend the rest of your\nlife with? Or do you consider it an option to sit and mope? No chance of looking\naround for something more entertaining you could spend all these years with?\u201d\n</p><p>The silence stretches long before Tony answers.\n</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re appalling. I hate you.\u201d </p><p>Loki tells the lack of resistance in the answer,\nand he pats the back of the man\u2019s neck. </p><p>\u201cTime to take on the world.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, stay a bit. I\u2019m\u2026 off-balance. In my\nsitting, too. I\u2019ll fall off of here without a prop.\u201d </p><p>So they stay like that, motionless. </p><p>\u201cHow much longer?\u201d Loki inquires\nafter a minute. </p><p>\u201cLittle bit.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you myself,\u201d he decides, but\nTony\u2019s answer stops his movement. </p><p>\u201cNothing more to lose, so I\u2019ll be honest. I\u2019m shitting bricks now. Don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to face anyone who knew me, which practically\nincludes all of humanity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never will be,\u201d Loki assures him\nfrom personal experience. And he watches the man\u2019s profile, until he inhales\ndeeply and stirs into motion under the gaze. </p><p>He walks steadier than he claimed, his head bent.\nLoki holds his shoulders with an arm while they find the way out. Approaching\nthe main entrance, a flick of his free wrist camouflages the smell and unkempt\nappearance of the billionaire. </p><p>\u201cSunglasses too,\u201d Tony mumbles. His\nwish is fulfilled. </p><p>Then the door slides aside, and they step out\ninto the blinding sunlight. <br></p><hr><p><a href=\"https://intensitystoner.tumblr.com/post/184383283775/scribbles-continuing-the-heart-of-anthony-kinda\" target=\"_blank\">Part 2</a> <br></p>",

Many in the Universe have perished\nduring the battle against him. T'Challa. Peter. The Guardians of the Galaxy. Pepper.\nThor. </p><p>Loki hasn\u2019t, he tricked Hela into letting him go\nfrom Hel this once. He returned into a world mourning its many losses, and he joined\nin with his own. He hid from the remaining Asgardians who searched for the next-in-line\nto the throne. He said his prayers unseen. He raised some havoc at certain points\nof the universe experimentally, but it didn\u2019t bring fulfilment: it was too easy\nwhere no one knew him. He ended up on Earth. <br></p><p>Earth is an easy target for nations still recovering\nafter the wars; disorganised alien attacks are more frequent than holidays. S.H.I.E.L.D.\nis doing a satisfactory job, the Avengers are partially disbanded, a few available\nmembers get in contact for occasional teamwork. Tony is a drunkard, a sullen prince\nin a sealed-off, ruinous Tower. Friends have been trying to barge into his privatised\nlife for his very much essential contribution, to no avail. Some have given up, others spit\nscornful comments about him or his guts when Loki enters the battle scene for the\nfirst time; in chains, willing hostage to the current alien powers, pretending to\nbe helpless against them until a favourable moment presents itself. During the scarcely\nnostalgic encounter, he\u2019s freed unasked, and his plans are nullified with the perish\nof the alien troops. He can deny his need for help as he wants, his debt is established;\nin return for letting him stay unharmed, he needs to prove his allegiance. His task:\nget through the barrier and bring the self-important prince out of his castle. No\nneed to get into the man\u2019s dishevelled mind or broken soul, physical force is fully\naccepted. Point is, Stark should be whole in the end and the Avengers should get\na chance to talk to him. <br></p>[[MORE]]<p>So Loki, for want of better, or in respect to his\nlate brother, that Midgard-lover oaf, sneaks through a familiarly humane defence\nmechanism with the aid of sorcery. Treads watchfully along glassy corridors and\ncrosses deadly silences, climbs stairs and unnecessarily recognises elements designed\nfor specific Avengers he\u2019s encountered before. Meets no resistance from the moment\nof entering the building. Explores systematically, from the lowest underground floors\nlined with motionless or disinterested robotics. Heading upwards, he pockets a few\npeculiar items, none of those found in Midgard among natural circumstances. Stops\non Floor +6, marked with the general symbolic \u2018A\u2019 on the elevator\u2019s number plate.\nHe stands in a dim, window-lit hall with crystal-smooth floor, leather sofas and\na bar at the other end. Abandons the last bits of aloofness based on former experience\nat a very similar place. His steps don\u2019t stir the prince awake. If he\u2019s dead, as\nthe stench indicates, it can\u2019t have been for a long time because blood is still\nvivid under his skin on the cheeks, nose, closed eyes. He\u2019s lying spread on the\nfloor, jeans and T-shirt sweated through, hair inches longer than last seen, but\ncheeks perfectly shaved. It seems like that\u2019s the only thing he still gave a damn\nabout while conscious, and the former content of the countless glass bottles and\ncans scattered on tables, plants, shelves. </p><p>Loki deems the tip of his boot enough to stain,\nso he uses it to turn the man\u2019s head to the side experimentally. Just as he thought,\nrigor mortis hasn\u2019t set in yet. He makes sure by turning it the other way with his\nheel. </p><p>Stark curses at the assault against his nose and\nmouth. Straightening his neck, he takes time before peeking out into the weak but\nkiller light through a curtain of eyelashes. </p><p>\u201cCare for a drink?\u201d he inquires already,\nthough he can\u2019t see his guest enough yet to identify him. He clambers up to an elbow,\nrepeatedly. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pass, thank you,\u201d the sorcerer responds\nwhile pulling up the billionaire by the upper arm, intending to drag him to the\nopen conveniently like this. </p><p>\u201cI have great Burgundy back there, y'know,\u201d\nStark notes, giving emphasis by an index finger held into the other\u2019s face. And\nwhen he stops squinting at that finger, he frowns in recognition. \u201cLoki!\u201d\nAnd then: \u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>The sorcerer, still holding his grip, follows Stark\u2019s\nexample of glancing around. But nothing happens, the needed saviour doesn\u2019t heed\nthe call. Alcohol enhances the purity of the billionaire\u2019s dismay. </p><p>\"Drinks,\u201d he remembers abruptly and attempts\nto stumble backwards from the captivity.</p><p>\u201cNone of your drinks are better than\nwater to a god,\u201d Loki informs him while he tugs on the arm to keep the man\non his feet. </p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019ll have a few select words to, once\nI make it there,\u201d Tony says. \u201cBut before that, you\u2019ll have to give me\na chance to prove you wrong. As man to man. You\u2019ll see how much you\u2019ve got to learn\nabout the drinks of Midgard.\u201d </p><p>Loki yields and follows him silently, watches the\nclumsy clinking of bottles that cover the entire mirror-wall behind the counter,\nand the fiddling with two laboriously snatched glasses. After Stark drenches both\nglasses and the table top in the chosen liquid, the sorcerer takes the bottle out\nof his hand and puts it to his mouth. </p><p>\u201cShow-off,\u201d the billionaire observes before\ngulping down the fiery fluid from his glass, then from the other one. \u201cHave\nyou also tried drowning your sorrow in booze? Did you notice that bitch is a damn\ngood swimmer? I heard you\u2019re also left behind by all your own kin.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>The drink really has no greater effect than water,\nLoki learns during the tactless comment. The half empty bottle hits the counter\nwith a loud thud. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to take you out of here. Let\u2019s go,\ntime\u2019s ticking.\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s face darkens at that, but his slurred tone\nremains light. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got plenty of time, exactly a lifetime\nmore than I want. And you are no different, god,\u201d he responds, lifting the\nbottle to his lips. </p><p>Loki takes it out of his hand and throws it away;\nit smashes into the ground with a sharp, splintering noise. </p><p>\u201cTime to go, babbler,\u201d he repeats and\nreaches for the other\u2019s arm over the counter. </p><p>The billionaire huffs while reeling away from the\ncaptivity, amused. He turns back to the mirror shelves and blindly lifts off another\nbottle. </p><p>\u201cTake me, if you can.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re challenging me?\u201d Loki\u2019s surprise\nis overwhelming, the notion is quite unconscious as he twists the bottle out of\nthe disoriented fingers and sends it on a short flight. Tony grins with the bottle\nopener left in his hand. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cBeen in a while, if you haven\u2019t noticed. It\u2019s\nwhat drunkards do.\u201d </p><p>And he reaches for another drink. He loses it the\nsame way. Next time he turns, the entire wall collapses into a pool of splinters\nand drinks on the floor. It goes with an ear-splitting noise but no harm is done\nto the billionaire, he merely blinks in surprise and wades ankle-high in the precious\nfluids as he backs away from the sorcerer suddenly next to him. He attacks or defends\nwith the opener in his hand, his wrist is caught and twisted before he\u2019d figure\nout which one it is. He yelps and backs up from the pain, but Loki steps after him,\nfingertips of his free hand lie over the glowing triangle on the billionaire\u2019s chest.\n</p><p>\u201cAnd what in Heavens is this abomination anyway?\nWhere\u2019s your heart?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s none,\u201d Tony lies with an empty\nstare at him, but he finds it truer now than ever. </p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there? What\u2019s in its place then?\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNothing?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre you not human?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMaybe not.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow about here?\u201d </p><p>Tony holds his breath from the unnerving sensation\nas cool fingers slide onto his aching forehead and a foreign presence invades his\nmind.

As blood rapidly drains from the man\u2019s\nface, Loki grabs hold of the shirt, catching up his fall. Held by that one clothing,\nhe drags the semi-conscious corpse around the counter and towards the centre of\nthe room. With a skilful switch of hands, he turns him onto his stomach, and holding\nhim the same way by the back of the shirt, he leans the jaw to a large flower pot\nas considerately as he can. </p><p>Before his neck could twist back and break, Tony\u2019s\nhands hold his torso up, and while Loki releases him, he clambers higher over the\nedge of the pot and lets the burning bitter-sour fluid leave through his gutter.\nIt doesn\u2019t have much thickness, he\u2019s forgotten the last time he ate something. </p><p>Minutes pass while the god walks aimlessly at a\npolite distance and Tony\u2019s arm embraces the thin crust of the mango tree, resting\nhis forehead against it, relishing the terrible sensation of sobering out. </p><p>\u201cReady to leave?\u201d Loki inquires then.\n</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to die. Give me back my drinks,\nyou stuck-up jerk,\u201d Tony mumbles in a voice way too smooth for his words. \"God,\nI miss F.R.I.D.A.Y.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMan\u2019s best friend. Fits your moods, helps\nin need, only comes when called. No, the latter\u2019s not true, she can be an annoying\nwhore at times. Must have turned her off at some point.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIs she your spouse?\u201d </p><p>Tony huffs quietly before answering. </p><p>\u201cShe should\u2019ve been.\u201d He clambers up onto\nthe nearest sofa, turning towards the backrest. \u201cShe should\u2019ve been my spouse\ninstead, then all would be fine now.\u201d </p><p>Loki frowns at the notion and walks back towards\nhim. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get to rest later. Don\u2019t make me\ndrag you out by a leg.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGet the fuck out, god of clowns, save the\nothers from me spitting into their faces. They can\u2019t leave a man to mourn in peace.\u201d\n</p><p>It\u2019s getting longer than a quick favour, Loki\u2019s\npatience is running out. He stops for one last warning with his best intentions.\n</p><p>\u201cAnthony, is it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYour fat ass mother it is.\u201d </p><p>His eyebrows run up. </p><p>\u201cIn fact, she was a woman of much refined appearance.\u201d\n</p><p>That makes Anthony laugh, a semi-willed hiss that\ngrows into a roar of laughter. When it\u2019s over, he says: </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re as ignorant as your\nbrother. He was quite usable in a fight, but in terms of perception, he wasn\u2019t\nthe brightest. He went after his own nose like the world was a single straight\nline. He\u2019s the saviour of the Universe and all that shit, and we loved him even\nbefore that, but he was still a dumbass. A Point Break. A big, sturdy ox with restraints\nway worse than the Hulk.\u201d </p><p>Loki smiles then, perhaps for the first time since\nhis return without having control over it. Because Thor is always raised on a pedestal,\nadmired as a flawless being, but here, he just realises, this wretched man sees\nhim as he was in truth, as Loki sees him, as the brother he loves him. The Thor\nhe knows exists for this man. And that makes Loki feel less alone, and grateful\nto him. A sensation long missed like air after a dive. </p><p>So he sits down on the other coach to listen, because\nhe feels in debt. </p><p>And as Tony\u2019s disorganised, slurred, half-awake\nblabbers go on and retell the memories Loki has just witnessed as an outsider, he\ngrows aware of how similar their pain is. How similar their helpless, senseless, still\nstubbornly scorching rage is against the unalterable. For this moment, he sees that\na being this much measlier than a god harbours passion of the same magnitude as\nhimself. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very broken, Anthony,\u201d he\nconcludes. </p><p>\u201cBroken? I\u2019m shattered. Haven\u2019t been in this\nmany pieces since my first crack at high school.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve noticed that falling apart is a\ncommon habit of earthlings. But isn\u2019t it time to man up again already? I reckon\nit\u2019s been three years.\u201d <a></a></p><p>The human bursts out: </p><p>\u201cI faced May!\u201d he roars, a fist\nhitting the backrest while he sits up, feet landing on the floor. \u201cI faced the kid\u2019s aunt! I did! I\ndidn\u2019t back out! Isn\u2019t that enough?\u201d </p><p>Loki knows no kid or aunt, but he sees the\nshiver run through the man\u2019s body, and he knows that the act he speaks about was something out of his\nboundaries. </p><p>\u201cHow is that not a shitload more than enough?\u201d\nTony weeps. And weeps. And Loki sits over to hold his miserable, stinking\ncarcass, because the shards threaten to fall apart, and because this little human\nhas lost an entire world like Loki did, and he sees Thor the way Loki does, and\nhe used to wield skills enough to be a threat for him, and now nothing that\u2019s\ntangible about him is really him, he is nothing to this world, he has lost his ties\nand he belongs nowhere among the hands reaching for him blindly, he is nothing,\nnothing real to anyone, just like Loki. Only Loki has learnt how to be this\nnothing, and this man has yet to brave it. He still talks about the remaining\nhumans like he matters. </p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Loki lets him know. \u201cSo\nthe toil is over. The next step is to stand up.\u201d </p><p>The response is a snarl: </p><p>\u201cWhat for, genius?\u201d </p><p>The general denseness of humans keeps\nsurprising the sorcerer. Fifteen hundred years, and he still can\u2019t see the qualities\nThor used to praise in them. But he\u2019s very adaptive, so his tone doesn\u2019t reveal\nhis honest curiosity. </p><p>\u201cWhat else will you spend the rest of your\nlife with? Or do you consider it an option to sit and mope? No chance of looking\naround for something more entertaining you could spend all these years with?\u201d\n</p><p>The silence stretches long before Tony answers.\n</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re appalling. I hate you.\u201d </p><p>Loki tells the lack of resistance in the answer,\nand he pats the back of the man\u2019s neck. </p><p>\u201cTime to take on the world.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, stay a bit. I\u2019m\u2026 off-balance. In my\nsitting, too. I\u2019ll fall off of here without a prop.\u201d </p><p>So they stay like that, motionless. </p><p>\u201cHow much longer?\u201d Loki inquires\nafter a minute. </p><p>\u201cLittle bit.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you myself,\u201d he decides, but\nTony\u2019s answer stops his movement. </p><p>\u201cNothing more to lose, so I\u2019ll be honest. I\u2019m shitting bricks now. Don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to face anyone who knew me, which practically\nincludes all of humanity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never will be,\u201d Loki assures him\nfrom personal experience. And he watches the man\u2019s profile, until he inhales\ndeeply and stirs into motion under the gaze. </p><p>He walks steadier than he claimed, his head bent.\nLoki holds his shoulders with an arm while they find the way out. Approaching\nthe main entrance, a flick of his free wrist camouflages the smell and unkempt\nappearance of the billionaire. </p><p>\u201cSunglasses too,\u201d Tony mumbles. His\nwish is fulfilled. </p><p>Then the door slides aside, and they step out\ninto the blinding sunlight. <br></p><hr><p><a href=\"https://intensitystoner.tumblr.com/post/184383283775/scribbles-continuing-the-heart-of-anthony-kinda\" target=\"_blank\">Part 2</a> <br></p>",
                "content": "<p><b>The heart of Anthony </b><i></i></p><p><i>a carelessly worded,\nmildly Frostiron scribble, rated T for drinkin&rsquo; and language<br />~2,500 words<br />(ignores Endgame)<br /></i></p><hr /><p>Thanos is dead. Many in the Universe have perished\nduring the battle against him. T'Challa. Peter. The Guardians of the Galaxy. Pepper.\nThor. </p><p>Loki hasn&rsquo;t, he tricked Hela into letting him go\nfrom Hel this once. He returned into a world mourning its many losses, and he joined\nin with his own. He hid from the remaining Asgardians who searched for the next-in-line\nto the throne. He said his prayers unseen. He raised some havoc at certain points\nof the universe experimentally, but it didn&rsquo;t bring fulfilment: it was too easy\nwhere no one knew him. He ended up on Earth. <br /></p><p>Earth is an easy target for nations still recovering\nafter the wars; disorganised alien attacks are more frequent than holidays. S.H.I.E.L.D.\nis doing a satisfactory job, the Avengers are partially disbanded, a few available\nmembers get in contact for occasional teamwork. Tony is a drunkard, a sullen prince\nin a sealed-off, ruinous Tower. Friends have been trying to barge into his privatised\nlife for his very much essential contribution, to no avail. Some have given up, others spit\nscornful comments about him or his guts when Loki enters the battle scene for the\nfirst time; in chains, willing hostage to the current alien powers, pretending to\nbe helpless against them until a favourable moment presents itself. During the scarcely\nnostalgic encounter, he&rsquo;s freed unasked, and his plans are nullified with the perish\nof the alien troops. He can deny his need for help as he wants, his debt is established;\nin return for letting him stay unharmed, he needs to prove his allegiance. His task:\nget through the barrier and bring the self-important prince out of his castle. No\nneed to get into the man&rsquo;s dishevelled mind or broken soul, physical force is fully\naccepted. Point is, Stark should be whole in the end and the Avengers should get\na chance to talk to him. <br /></p><p>So Loki, for want of better, or in respect to his\nlate brother, that Midgard-lover oaf, sneaks through a familiarly humane defence\nmechanism with the aid of sorcery. Treads watchfully along glassy corridors and\ncrosses deadly silences, climbs stairs and unnecessarily recognises elements designed\nfor specific Avengers he&rsquo;s encountered before. Meets no resistance from the moment\nof entering the building. Explores systematically, from the lowest underground floors\nlined with motionless or disinterested robotics. Heading upwards, he pockets a few\npeculiar items, none of those found in Midgard among natural circumstances. Stops\non Floor +6, marked with the general symbolic &lsquo;A&rsquo; on the elevator&rsquo;s number plate.\nHe stands in a dim, window-lit hall with crystal-smooth floor, leather sofas and\na bar at the other end. Abandons the last bits of aloofness based on former experience\nat a very similar place. His steps don&rsquo;t stir the prince awake. If he&rsquo;s dead, as\nthe stench indicates, it can&rsquo;t have been for a long time because blood is still\nvivid under his skin on the cheeks, nose, closed eyes. He&rsquo;s lying spread on the\nfloor, jeans and T-shirt sweated through, hair inches longer than last seen, but\ncheeks perfectly shaved. It seems like that&rsquo;s the only thing he still gave a damn\nabout while conscious, and the former content of the countless glass bottles and\ncans scattered on tables, plants, shelves. </p><p>Loki deems the tip of his boot enough to stain,\nso he uses it to turn the man&rsquo;s head to the side experimentally. Just as he thought,\nrigor mortis hasn&rsquo;t set in yet. He makes sure by turning it the other way with his\nheel. </p><p>Stark curses at the assault against his nose and\nmouth. Straightening his neck, he takes time before peeking out into the weak but\nkiller light through a curtain of eyelashes. </p><p>&ldquo;Care for a drink?&rdquo; he inquires already,\nthough he can&rsquo;t see his guest enough yet to identify him. He clambers up to an elbow,\nrepeatedly. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pass, thank you,&rdquo; the sorcerer responds\nwhile pulling up the billionaire by the upper arm, intending to drag him to the\nopen conveniently like this. </p><p>&ldquo;I have great Burgundy back there, y'know,&rdquo;\nStark notes, giving emphasis by an index finger held into the other&rsquo;s face. And\nwhen he stops squinting at that finger, he frowns in recognition. &ldquo;Loki!&rdquo;\nAnd then: &ldquo;F.R.I.D.A.Y?&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>The sorcerer, still holding his grip, follows Stark&rsquo;s\nexample of glancing around. But nothing happens, the needed saviour doesn&rsquo;t heed\nthe call. Alcohol enhances the purity of the billionaire&rsquo;s dismay. </p><p>\"Drinks,&rdquo; he remembers abruptly and attempts\nto stumble backwards from the captivity.</p><p>&ldquo;None of your drinks are better than\nwater to a god,&rdquo; Loki informs him while he tugs on the arm to keep the man\non his feet. </p><p>&ldquo;God, I&rsquo;ll have a few select words to, once\nI make it there,&rdquo; Tony says. &ldquo;But before that, you&rsquo;ll have to give me\na chance to prove you wrong. As man to man. You&rsquo;ll see how much you&rsquo;ve got to learn\nabout the drinks of Midgard.&rdquo; </p><p>Loki yields and follows him silently, watches the\nclumsy clinking of bottles that cover the entire mirror-wall behind the counter,\nand the fiddling with two laboriously snatched glasses. After Stark drenches both\nglasses and the table top in the chosen liquid, the sorcerer takes the bottle out\nof his hand and puts it to his mouth. </p><p>&ldquo;Show-off,&rdquo; the billionaire observes before\ngulping down the fiery fluid from his glass, then from the other one. &ldquo;Have\nyou also tried drowning your sorrow in booze? Did you notice that bitch is a damn\ngood swimmer? I heard you&rsquo;re also left behind by all your own kin.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>The drink really has no greater effect than water,\nLoki learns during the tactless comment. The half empty bottle hits the counter\nwith a loud thud. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to take you out of here. Let&rsquo;s go,\ntime&rsquo;s ticking.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony&rsquo;s face darkens at that, but his slurred tone\nremains light. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got plenty of time, exactly a lifetime\nmore than I want. And you are no different, god,&rdquo; he responds, lifting the\nbottle to his lips. </p><p>Loki takes it out of his hand and throws it away;\nit smashes into the ground with a sharp, splintering noise. </p><p>&ldquo;Time to go, babbler,&rdquo; he repeats and\nreaches for the other&rsquo;s arm over the counter. </p><p>The billionaire huffs while reeling away from the\ncaptivity, amused. He turns back to the mirror shelves and blindly lifts off another\nbottle. </p><p>&ldquo;Take me, if you can.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re challenging me?&rdquo; Loki&rsquo;s surprise\nis overwhelming, the notion is quite unconscious as he twists the bottle out of\nthe disoriented fingers and sends it on a short flight. Tony grins with the bottle\nopener left in his hand. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Been in a while, if you haven&rsquo;t noticed. It&rsquo;s\nwhat drunkards do.&rdquo; </p><p>And he reaches for another drink. He loses it the\nsame way. Next time he turns, the entire wall collapses into a pool of splinters\nand drinks on the floor. It goes with an ear-splitting noise but no harm is done\nto the billionaire, he merely blinks in surprise and wades ankle-high in the precious\nfluids as he backs away from the sorcerer suddenly next to him. He attacks or defends\nwith the opener in his hand, his wrist is caught and twisted before he&rsquo;d figure\nout which one it is. He yelps and backs up from the pain, but Loki steps after him,\nfingertips of his free hand lie over the glowing triangle on the billionaire&rsquo;s chest.\n</p><p>&ldquo;And what in Heavens is this abomination anyway?\nWhere&rsquo;s your heart?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s none,&rdquo; Tony lies with an empty\nstare at him, but he finds it truer now than ever. </p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there? What&rsquo;s in its place then?&rdquo;\n</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Nothing?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Are you not human?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe not.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;How about here?&rdquo; </p><p>Tony holds his breath from the unnerving sensation\nas cool fingers slide onto his aching forehead and a foreign presence invades his\nmind. Memories gush forth, a coarsely edited film of his life. His freshest pains\nburn the deepest. Unable to think words, he roars inarticulately in a desire to\nget rid of them. </p><p>Loki&rsquo;s face shows confusion against the billionaire&rsquo;s\ntorment. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not artificial anywhere. You&rsquo;re all\nyou.&rdquo; </p><p>He wants to ask why Stark denied that, but the shock\ntook its toll on the alcohol-infused body. As blood rapidly drains from the man&rsquo;s\nface, Loki grabs hold of the shirt, catching up his fall. Held by that one clothing,\nhe drags the semi-conscious corpse around the counter and towards the centre of\nthe room. With a skilful switch of hands, he turns him onto his stomach, and holding\nhim the same way by the back of the shirt, he leans the jaw to a large flower pot\nas considerately as he can. </p><p>Before his neck could twist back and break, Tony&rsquo;s\nhands hold his torso up, and while Loki releases him, he clambers higher over the\nedge of the pot and lets the burning bitter-sour fluid leave through his gutter.\nIt doesn&rsquo;t have much thickness, he&rsquo;s forgotten the last time he ate something. </p><p>Minutes pass while the god walks aimlessly at a\npolite distance and Tony&rsquo;s arm embraces the thin crust of the mango tree, resting\nhis forehead against it, relishing the terrible sensation of sobering out. </p><p>&ldquo;Ready to leave?&rdquo; Loki inquires then.\n</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to die. Give me back my drinks,\nyou stuck-up jerk,&rdquo; Tony mumbles in a voice way too smooth for his words. \"God,\nI miss F.R.I.D.A.Y.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Man&rsquo;s best friend. Fits your moods, helps\nin need, only comes when called. No, the latter&rsquo;s not true, she can be an annoying\nwhore at times. Must have turned her off at some point.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Is she your spouse?&rdquo; </p><p>Tony huffs quietly before answering. </p><p>&ldquo;She should&rsquo;ve been.&rdquo; He clambers up onto\nthe nearest sofa, turning towards the backrest. &ldquo;She should&rsquo;ve been my spouse\ninstead, then all would be fine now.&rdquo; </p><p>Loki frowns at the notion and walks back towards\nhim. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get to rest later. Don&rsquo;t make me\ndrag you out by a leg.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Get the fuck out, god of clowns, save the\nothers from me spitting into their faces. They can&rsquo;t leave a man to mourn in peace.&rdquo;\n</p><p>It&rsquo;s getting longer than a quick favour, Loki&rsquo;s\npatience is running out. He stops for one last warning with his best intentions.\n</p><p>&ldquo;Anthony, is it?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Your fat ass mother it is.&rdquo; </p><p>His eyebrows run up. </p><p>&ldquo;In fact, she was a woman of much refined appearance.&rdquo;\n</p><p>That makes Anthony laugh, a semi-willed hiss that\ngrows into a roar of laughter.
