        "body": "<p>Standing 20ft from the edge of the black hole disguised as a forest, you nervously eyed the blonde male who stared back at you with a nonchalant look on his face. Never would you have expected that venturing into the enchanted forests of the Kojin Kingdom to be on the to do list. But the flight took an unexpected landing just at the beginning of the woodland, and Bakugou hopped off like it was the most normal thing in the world.</p><p>So here you were staring straight into the dark abyss, unsure of what was happening.</p><p>\u201cWell go on.\u201d the blonde spoke.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018<i>go on</i>\u2019!? What am I supposed to do? You haven\u2019t explained what we were doing?!\u201d you glared at the male, your nerves jittery at the eerie atmosphere radiating off the forest. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going in obviously.\u201d he deadpanned.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell we gotta talk to dunceface somehow.\u201d </p><p>An exasperated expression plastered your face. </p><p><i>In there</i>? The so called \u2018Commander Dunceface\u2019 lived in the enchanted forest of Kojin Kingdom?? Was he crazy??? This man had to be absolutely mad to be living in there. </p><p>\u201cA-are you serious?\u201d </p><p>Bakugou quirked a brow at you, \u201cDid I stutter? Dunceface lives in the middle of this forest, how else is he gonna know about our plans if we don\u2019t tell him.\u201d walking into the shrubbery leading into the forest. \u201cC\u2019mon if you don\u2019t catch up, you\u2019ll get lost.\u201d turning an eye back to you, \u201c<i>and may never come out</i>.\u201d</p><p>You gulped down the large lump that had formed in your throat while your nerves jumbled up uneasiness in your stomach, threatening to resurface your breakfast from that morning. Running to catch up with the male, your hands found purchase in his red cape and your face lingering near his shoulder. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you scared?\u201d a smirk pulling Bakugou\u2019s lips as he teased you. </p><p>\u201cLike hell! Look at this place, it would give anyone the creeps! It\u2019s like a black hole!\u201d </p><p>Bakugou chuckled, mentally gloating to himself about how you were chickening out again. But he saved his retorts back for now. He had to focus at the task at hand and keep at high alert. It was no secret that the enchanted forests of Kojin Kingdom were the most dangerous in all the land. No one would ever dare to enter &ndash; or even think about it. Stories be told that whomever stepped foot into the forests of Kojin Kingdom, were never seen again. Presumingly eaten by the ferocious beasts that resided in the forest or lost with no direction out. It went by various nicknames such as, the Forest of Hell, Black Abyss, Suicide Forest, and a personal favorite; the Heart of Kojin, because it was like a representation of the King\u2019s bottomless, soulless, gaping black hole of a heart.</p><!-- more --><p>Every little noise or even a slight movement caught in your peripheral vision made you jump. It was so dark and foggy within the forest, you were grateful that Bakugou\u2019s red cape stuck out like a burning flame amidst the fog so it wasn\u2019t hard to miss him. The male also held a small lantern to light the way. But other than the small fire lighting just around your bodies, everything else around you was pitch black and hard to make out with even a squint of the eye. </p><p>You kept yourself so close to Bakugou you were practically hugging him the whole way and your legs knocked into each other a few times, earning annoyed remarks from the male. </p><p>\u201cQuit walking so close to me! You\u2019re being too damn clingy!!!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t help it! I can\u2019t see shit! It\u2019s too dark I hate it here!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell suck it up we\u2019re almost there.\u201d</p><p>You took a deep breath. <i>\u2018We\u2019re almost there. Alright, I can do this.\u2019</i></p><p>You two walked for a little more, unbeknownst a figure was quietly sneaking up behind the two. You hadn\u2019t heard it, or sensed it, or even felt it\u2019s slight breath blow against the skin of your neck. Simply brushing it off taking it as the wind. </p><p>That\u2019s when it stuck out it\u2019s long slippery tongue, taking a nice feathery lick to your neck.</p><p>In an instant your eyes widened and your pupils shrunk to dots, and a high pitched ripped through the air. You threw yourself off Bakugou, stumbling back onto the ground flat on your butt. </p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck!?\u201d Bakugou yelled, shining the lantern to unmask the beast from the darkness. It\u2019s form looked like a large black blob of tar, with no eyes and just a large mouth making the features of what you could assume was the head. It\u2019s sharp jagged teeth was stained with blood of past victims and its long tongue was dripping with saliva. It\u2019s claws were long skinny bones but pierced through the ground like drills. Your body was frozen, your mind screamed for you to move but fear weighed you down pinning you in your spot. </p><p>Bakugou drew his sword, charging towards the monster and slashing its legs, immobilizing it momentarily before it could regenerate. It was enough to buy a little time for him to pull you off your feet and start running. \u201cGet off your ass and run idiot!\u201d you were still in shock and Bakugou had to hold onto you to build up your pace. You heard the beast screaming behind you and the growing thuds of footsteps gaining up to the two of you. The ground beneath you was shaking with each of the beasts heavy stomping, and the reverberation was rapidly increasing as it wasn\u2019t now just one monster chasing after you, but 5 more. </p><p>You came to an abrupt halt as your path was blocked by 3 beasts, and 3 others slowly sauntering behind you. \u201cShit!\u201d Bakugou whispered to himself, tightly clutching his sword and bending down into a battle stance. \u201cGet back princess or you might get cut.\u201d he warned. Worry was washing over you, feeling a bit uneasy about letting him take all 6 monsters on his own. It wasn\u2019t that you thought he was weak &ndash; far from it. You didn\u2019t see that it was right for him to shoulder all the work. He took pride in his combat skill and would show it off any opportunity he got, but you didn\u2019t see this was the right moment for a\u00a0\u2018Kingdom\u2019s Got Talent\u2019.</p><p>Bakugou lunged towards the beast once again, swinging his sword and slicing against its thick black skin. Another beast jumped in the air towards you, and you reacted quick enough to dodge out of the way, but you instantly regretted the move as it was heading straight towards the ash blonde. </p><p>\u201cKatuski! Look out behind you!\u201d you screamed. Bakugou turned and quickly sliced his blade through the throat of the beast. It fell to the ground with a loud thud and smoke started oozing out of his open wound and its body shriveled down until to what made it look like a flimsy plastic bag. </p><p><i>\u2018So you have to pierce it\u2019s throat for it to die\u2019</i> you observed. Your thoughts were interrupted when 2 other beasts darted towards Bakugou. He was left defenseless as one took hold of his sword in its mouth and another was able to sink its fangs into his left leg. The blonde let out a loud groan, gritting his teeth enduring the throbbing pain in his leg. </p><p>\u201cKatsuki!!!\u201d</p><p>The fresh scent of blood put the beasts in a frenzy, growing hungrier and hungrier for the flesh of a human. All 5 of the remaining beasts turned their attention to Bakugou\u2019s open wounds, finding it more enticing than you who was standing in the open and easy access. Bakugou set off a few explosions from his palms trying to pry them further away from him to create an opening for himself. But they were regenerating faster than he could blast. As he was busy trying to blow away one beast, another bit Bakugou\u2019s right arm and he let out another a scream as it gnawed at the bone.</p><p>\u201cNo!!! Katsuki!!!\u201d you screamed, tears falling down your face as you watched in horror as the beasts ate at his taut flesh. You had to do something, standing and wailing wasn\u2019t going to do anything. You felt as useless as a silly movie heroine. What were you doing watching let these unknown monsters eat the man you owe your life to. </p><p><i>\u2018No. I had to do something.\u2019 </i></p><p>If you could stand up against the King of Kojin, then why couldn\u2019t you stand up to some measly beasts? Had you only had balls to talk against Bakugou but not to fight off some beasts.</p><p>Scaredy cat. Coward. Crybaby.</p><p>You took a shaky breath focused on summoning your power. You learned from accidents that your power was harder to control when your emotions were unstable. Under tremendous amount of stress, agony, anxiety, sadness, pressure. There were multiple times where you had unintentionally summoned a hell chain during a tantrum or you were denied permission seeing your family when you were younger. Or during the instance when your power had first manifested and had killed your kidnappers. If not under proper control, it could haywire end up hurting someone you cared for. So it took a clear mind and full concentration to do it right.\u00a0</p><p>Successfully you were able to summon a hell beast. This one taking the form of a giant black cat. It\u2019s black fur unruly, and blending in with the blackness of the forest. It\u2019s yellow eyes penetrating the dark, making it seem like it was just a floating pair of eyes if it weren\u2019t for the deafening hiss it let out. </p><p><i>\u2018Protect Katsuki.\u2019</i></p><p>Blades shot all around you, cutting through the air, and piercing through the bodies of the beasts. Chains twisting and wrapping tightly around the limbs and fat bodies of the animals, making blood spilling out of their mouths. The chains squeezed and pulled until their thick bodies exploded into a million pieces. Guts and blood splattered onto you and Bakugou like a red rain, but you could care less about the insides of some monsters littering your hair, as there were more important matters to attend to at the moment.</p><p>\u201cOh my god Katsuki! Are you okay!!\u201d immediately inspecting his wounded arm and leg. He winced in pain when you touched his arm, retracting it back and muttering a quick apology, biting your lip in guilt. \u201cSorry\u2026 I should\u2019ve done something sooner\u2026then you wouldn\u2019t have gotten hurt\u2026\u201d you mumbled, avoiding his gaze. Your chest felt sour, you couldn\u2019t forgive yourself for letting his injuries get so bad. For standing there like an idiot. For not protecting yourself. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, this is nothing. I\u2019ve been through worse.\u201d </p><p>You shifted your gaze back to him. Your eyes brimming with tears and your brows furrowed in frustration, \u201cNo! It\u2019s my fault! You were going to get eaten and it was all because of me!!!\u201d </p><p>Bakugou clicked his tongue, a small smirk on his lips. He used his uninjured hand to place it on top of your head. \u201cLook at you being all apologetic. Don\u2019t sweat it kid. I\u2019m stronger than you think, like those monsters were gonna keep me down.\u201d but you pouted, looking down at your hands that gripped at the fabric of your dress. The tears that flooded your eyes were streaming down your face and falling onto the backs of your hands. You let your hair hang over your face to curtain your tears but Bakugou took notice.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cH-hey! Don\u2019t cry I said this was nothing! So quit worrying alright!!!\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut still..\u201d your voice a worried whisper. A tired sigh escapes his throat, he runs his good hand through his unruly hair. He was never good at comforting and he didn\u2019t see it was the right time to start now. You still had a task at hand and he wasn\u2019t sure if he could even walk, let alone stand up on his own. And you surely weren\u2019t going to get far if you kept crying and sulking.</p><p>\u201cJust- tch, you can make it up to me some other time. Right now we need to get to the dunceface\u2019s place, so help me up.\u201d </p><p>You obliged, and shifted to his left side to pull him up and sling his uninjured arm around your shoulders, being cautious not to bump into his wounded leg. He was still able to walk, with your support, and the pain was bearable as long as you went at a slow pace. </p><p>\u201cSo you gonna put Cheshire cat away or what?\u201d referring to the beast you summoned earlier. Shaking your head and concentrating on keeping your legs a good distance from his own to avoid inflicting pain to his open wounds. \u201cI\u2019ll keep him out just in case any other monsters come.\u201d it was pretty hard to focus on the path in front of you, while simultaneously controlling your power and holding up your strength to support Bakugou.\u00a0</p><p>But you had to do what you can, so complaining was out of the question. You were still feeling ridiculously guilty.</p><p>He hummed in response, and the rest of the walk was pretty silent. You felt more at ease now, with your cat friend looming over you for protection. Soon a small cabin came into view. Walking up to the door you gave it a heavy knock with the hand that wasn\u2019t holding onto Bakugou. Waiting a few moments until it creaked open, displaying a yellow haired man with a black zig-zagged streak across his fringe.</p><p>\u201cWell hello there~\u201d he eyed you with a flirty gaze. \u201cWhat may a little lady like you be doing out here?\u201d he asked, looking you up and down, \u201cOi! Dunceface!\u201d, \u201cOh and Bakugou is here too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust let us in idiot. We gotta discuss the war plan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright alright.\u201d he shrugs, \u201cSeems like you got in a bit of trouble.\u201d pointing to his wounds. </p><p>\u201cShut it drooly, mind your fucking business.\u201d the male moves out of the doorway, inviting you both into his home.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah whatever you say. Want me to get you a first aid kit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need that shi-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes please!\u201d you interrupt the blonde and he shoots you a glare. \u201cLet me do this.\u201d you whisper, giving him a sympathetic look. He is reluctant to you helping him anymore but he gives in. He knew you felt guilty and you still owe him. </p><p>\u201cFine have it your way\u2026\u201d</p><p>The yellow haired male leads you into his bathroom and places the disinfectant and bandages on the counter. </p><p>\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d you bow, \u201cPlease, a beautiful lady like yourself should call me by my name. Kaminari Denki at your service.\u201d he winks at you and the ash blonde groans in annoyance at his flirty fiasco.</p><p>\u201cOh my god just bandage me up already so we can finish this shit and leave.\u201d he grumbles. \u201cOk Mr. Grumpy, I\u2019ll leave you two alone and prepare some tea.\u201d Kaminari excuses himself to leave you and the blonde to your business. You start by pouring some of the disinfectant on a cloth, \u201cThis is going to sting a bit.\u201d you warn, and start patting it against his skin. The ash blonde hisses and flinches away from your touch. \u201cFuck! that shit hurts!\u201d , \u201cI know that\u2019s why I said it was going to sting. Now stay still!\u201d holding his arm and patting at his wound again. After 10 minutes of curses and hissing, you completely disinfected is wounds. Now all that was left was wrapping his arm and leg up in bandages. He tried to push you away and do it himself but you insisted.</p><p>\u201cAgain\u2026 I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d you said in a soft voice. </p><p>\u201cI told you not to worry about it. You made it up to me now so it\u2019s ok.\u201d you finished wrapping him up, looking at him and your (e/c) orbs locked with his crimson ones. You hadn\u2019t noticed this whole time, as you were busy patching him up, but he had been staring at you while you weren\u2019t looking. His face was unusually calm. The furrow that always settled between his brows were instead on yours, and his expression was much softer. Nothing you had expected to ever see on Bakugou. </p><p>You felt a bit of heat rush to your face under his gaze. Your brow furrowed deeper in confusion, but a small yelp escaped your lips when Bakugou flicked a finger at the space right between your eyebrows. </p><p>\u201cOw! What was that for!?\u201d pressing your hands to your forehead, glaring at the male.</p><p>\u201cQuit frowning, you\u2019ll get wrinkles.\u201d you pout, \u201cLike you\u2019re one to talk. You grouch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever let\u2019s finish business here so we can go home.\u201d right as he opens the door, you stop him with a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re in trouble don\u2019t be afraid to ask me for help\u2026 ok? I\u2019m here to help you after all.\u201d You pause, softening your expression a bit, \u201cAnd when you\u2019re hurt I\u2019ll take care of you, so don\u2019t push me away&hellip;\u201d you looked down at your feet. The words that came out of your mouth were\u2026 <i>odd</i>. You found more solace for the hot-headed king, and with the war coming up you deemed it right just to be more cooperative. Toning down the attitude was going to be hard but this was a start.</p><p>Bakugou just stared at you. Your words leaving him a bit speechless. Never had he ever had anyone lend a hand to him. He absolutely resented help. It made him feel weak, helpless, limp and vulnerable. He wanted to do everything on his own and in his own way. He was so used to pushing people away, having people hate him, repel him, curse him. Anyone who ever dared to hold a hand out to him, it only left a scar on him and the other. Thus resulting in his negative social impression.</p><p>And that\u2019s how he liked it, and how he intended to keep it.\u00a0</p><p>But instead of feeling the usual fire he was accustomed to; fire that was born out of rage and hatred. This was a different fire, a more <i>comforting</i> fire. A fire that swelled in his chest and spread throughout his body like a blanket that warmed you up on a cold winter night. In that moment the barbaric king felt irritation. Not irritation from annoyance. But irritation of the new alien feeling in his chest. </p><p>It was something he had never experienced before. He didn\u2019t quite understand it. The unknown was a scary thing, but this was something he knew he shouldn\u2019t &ndash; or even couldn\u2019t &ndash; run away from. </p><p>His face pulled back to the usual scowl. With a click of his tongue he turned back and out of the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cWhatever princess. Don\u2019t get too close, don\u2019t think you\u2019re all that special\u2026\u201d the heat was now spreading dangerously to his face. To his luck you hadn\u2019t noticed. You were just glad he was ok and back to his usual spunk.</p><p><i><b>I updated my masterlist. you can find it if you search up masterlist on my page because the links in my bio dont work as of currently, when will i fix it? idk.</b></i></p><p><i><b>FEEDBACK IS APPRECIATED</b></i></p><p><i><b>taglist: <i><b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8EcHwLzqNVZUrSTrWz62wA\">@lovecakebacon</a> @<a href=\"https://spookyscaryskjei.tumblr.com/\" title=\"hey i\u2019m stephanie!\">spookyscaryskjei</a> @<a href=\"http://sciencethatshit.tumblr.com/\" title=\"I Want To Believe\">sciencethatshit</a> @<a href=\"http://seleniumlovelevi.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\u81ea\u7531\u306e\u7ffc\">seleniumlovelevi</a></b></i></b></i><br/></p>",

It was so dark and foggy within the forest, you were grateful that Bakugou\u2019s red cape stuck out like a burning flame amidst the fog so it wasn\u2019t hard to miss him. The male also held a small lantern to light the way. But other than the small fire lighting just around your bodies, everything else around you was pitch black and hard to make out with even a squint of the eye. </p><p>You kept yourself so close to Bakugou you were practically hugging him the whole way and your legs knocked into each other a few times, earning annoyed remarks from the male. </p><p>\u201cQuit walking so close to me!

Katsuki!!!\u201d you screamed, tears falling down your face as you watched in horror as the beasts ate at his taut flesh. You had to do something, standing and wailing wasn\u2019t going to do anything. You felt as useless as a silly movie heroine. What were you doing watching let these unknown monsters eat the man you owe your life to. </p><p><i>\u2018No. I had to do something.\u2019 </i></p><p>If you could stand up against the King of Kojin, then why couldn\u2019t you stand up to some measly beasts? Had you only had balls to talk against Bakugou but not to fight off some beasts.</p><p>Scaredy cat. Coward. Crybaby.</p><p>You took a shaky breath focused on summoning your power. You learned from accidents that your power was harder to control when your emotions were unstable. Under tremendous amount of stress, agony, anxiety, sadness, pressure. There were multiple times where you had unintentionally summoned a hell chain during a tantrum or you were denied permission seeing your family when you were younger. Or during the instance when your power had first manifested and had killed your kidnappers. If not under proper control, it could haywire end up hurting someone you cared for. So it took a clear mind and full concentration to do it right.\u00a0</p><p>Successfully you were able to summon a hell beast. This one taking the form of a giant black cat. It\u2019s black fur unruly, and blending in with the blackness of the forest. It\u2019s yellow eyes penetrating the dark, making it seem like it was just a floating pair of eyes if it weren\u2019t for the deafening hiss it let out. </p><p><i>\u2018Protect Katsuki.\u2019</i></p><p>Blades shot all around you, cutting through the air, and piercing through the bodies of the beasts. Chains twisting and wrapping tightly around the limbs and fat bodies of the animals, making blood spilling out of their mouths. The chains squeezed and pulled until their thick bodies exploded into a million pieces. Guts and blood splattered onto you and Bakugou like a red rain, but you could care less about the insides of some monsters littering your hair, as there were more important matters to attend to at the moment.</p><p>\u201cOh my god Katsuki! Are you okay!!\u201d immediately inspecting his wounded arm and leg. He winced in pain when you touched his arm, retracting it back and muttering a quick apology, biting your lip in guilt. \u201cSorry\u2026 I should\u2019ve done something sooner\u2026then you wouldn\u2019t have gotten hurt\u2026\u201d you mumbled, avoiding his gaze. Your chest felt sour, you couldn\u2019t forgive yourself for letting his injuries get so bad. For standing there like an idiot. For not protecting yourself. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, this is nothing. I\u2019ve been through worse.\u201d </p><p>You shifted your gaze back to him. Your eyes brimming with tears and your brows furrowed in frustration, \u201cNo! It\u2019s my fault! You were going to get eaten and it was all because of me!!!\u201d </p><p>Bakugou clicked his tongue, a small smirk on his lips. He used his uninjured hand to place it on top of your head. \u201cLook at you being all apologetic. Don\u2019t sweat it kid. I\u2019m stronger than you think, like those monsters were gonna keep me down.\u201d but you pouted, looking down at your hands that gripped at the fabric of your dress. The tears that flooded your eyes were streaming down your face and falling onto the backs of your hands. You let your hair hang over your face to curtain your tears but Bakugou took notice.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cH-hey! Don\u2019t cry I said this was nothing! So quit worrying alright!!!\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut still..\u201d your voice a worried whisper. A tired sigh escapes his throat, he runs his good hand through his unruly hair. He was never good at comforting and he didn\u2019t see it was the right time to start now. You still had a task at hand and he wasn\u2019t sure if he could even walk, let alone stand up on his own. And you surely weren\u2019t going to get far if you kept crying and sulking.</p><p>\u201cJust- tch, you can make it up to me some other time. Right now we need to get to the dunceface\u2019s place, so help me up.\u201d </p><p>You obliged, and shifted to his left side to pull him up and sling his uninjured arm around your shoulders, being cautious not to bump into his wounded leg. He was still able to walk, with your support, and the pain was bearable as long as you went at a slow pace. </p><p>\u201cSo you gonna put Cheshire cat away or what?\u201d referring to the beast you summoned earlier. Shaking your head and concentrating on keeping your legs a good distance from his own to avoid inflicting pain to his open wounds. \u201cI\u2019ll keep him out just in case any other monsters come.\u201d it was pretty hard to focus on the path in front of you, while simultaneously controlling your power and holding up your strength to support Bakugou.\u00a0</p><p>But you had to do what you can, so complaining was out of the question. You were still feeling ridiculously guilty.</p><p>He hummed in response, and the rest of the walk was pretty silent. You felt more at ease now, with your cat friend looming over you for protection. Soon a small cabin came into view. Walking up to the door you gave it a heavy knock with the hand that wasn\u2019t holding onto Bakugou. Waiting a few moments until it creaked open, displaying a yellow haired man with a black zig-zagged streak across his fringe.</p><p>\u201cWell hello there~\u201d he eyed you with a flirty gaze. \u201cWhat may a little lady like you be doing out here?\u201d he asked, looking you up and down, \u201cOi! Dunceface!\u201d, \u201cOh and Bakugou is here too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust let us in idiot. We gotta discuss the war plan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright alright.\u201d he shrugs, \u201cSeems like you got in a bit of trouble.\u201d pointing to his wounds. </p><p>\u201cShut it drooly, mind your fucking business.\u201d the male moves out of the doorway, inviting you both into his home.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah whatever you say. Want me to get you a first aid kit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need that shi-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes please!\u201d you interrupt the blonde and he shoots you a glare. \u201cLet me do this.\u201d you whisper, giving him a sympathetic look. He is reluctant to you helping him anymore but he gives in. He knew you felt guilty and you still owe him. </p><p>\u201cFine have it your way\u2026\u201d</p><p>The yellow haired male leads you into his bathroom and places the disinfectant and bandages on the counter. </p><p>\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d you bow, \u201cPlease, a beautiful lady like yourself should call me by my name. Kaminari Denki at your service.\u201d he winks at you and the ash blonde groans in annoyance at his flirty fiasco.</p><p>\u201cOh my god just bandage me up already so we can finish this shit and leave.\u201d he grumbles. \u201cOk Mr. Grumpy, I\u2019ll leave you two alone and prepare some tea.\u201d Kaminari excuses himself to leave you and the blonde to your business. You start by pouring some of the disinfectant on a cloth, \u201cThis is going to sting a bit.\u201d you warn, and start patting it against his skin. The ash blonde hisses and flinches away from your touch. \u201cFuck! that shit hurts!\u201d , \u201cI know that\u2019s why I said it was going to sting. Now stay still!\u201d holding his arm and patting at his wound again. After 10 minutes of curses and hissing, you completely disinfected is wounds. Now all that was left was wrapping his arm and leg up in bandages. He tried to push you away and do it himself but you insisted.</p><p>\u201cAgain\u2026 I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d you said in a soft voice. </p><p>\u201cI told you not to worry about it. You made it up to me now so it\u2019s ok.\u201d you finished wrapping him up, looking at him and your (e/c) orbs locked with his crimson ones. You hadn\u2019t noticed this whole time, as you were busy patching him up, but he had been staring at you while you weren\u2019t looking. His face was unusually calm. The furrow that always settled between his brows were instead on yours, and his expression was much softer. Nothing you had expected to ever see on Bakugou. </p><p>You felt a bit of heat rush to your face under his gaze. Your brow furrowed deeper in confusion, but a small yelp escaped your lips when Bakugou flicked a finger at the space right between your eyebrows. </p><p>\u201cOw! What was that for!?\u201d pressing your hands to your forehead, glaring at the male.</p><p>\u201cQuit frowning, you\u2019ll get wrinkles.\u201d you pout, \u201cLike you\u2019re one to talk. You grouch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever let\u2019s finish business here so we can go home.\u201d right as he opens the door, you stop him with a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re in trouble don\u2019t be afraid to ask me for help\u2026 ok? I\u2019m here to help you after all.\u201d You pause, softening your expression a bit, \u201cAnd when you\u2019re hurt I\u2019ll take care of you, so don\u2019t push me away\u2026\u201d you looked down at your feet. The words that came out of your mouth were\u2026 <i>odd</i>. You found more solace for the hot-headed king, and with the war coming up you deemed it right just to be more cooperative. Toning down the attitude was going to be hard but this was a start.</p><p>Bakugou just stared at you. Your words leaving him a bit speechless. Never had he ever had anyone lend a hand to him. He absolutely resented help. It made him feel weak, helpless, limp and vulnerable. He wanted to do everything on his own and in his own way. He was so used to pushing people away, having people hate him, repel him, curse him. Anyone who ever dared to hold a hand out to him, it only left a scar on him and the other. Thus resulting in his negative social impression.</p><p>And that\u2019s how he liked it, and how he intended to keep it.\u00a0</p><p>But instead of feeling the usual fire he was accustomed to; fire that was born out of rage and hatred. This was a different fire, a more <i>comforting</i> fire. A fire that swelled in his chest and spread throughout his body like a blanket that warmed you up on a cold winter night. In that moment the barbaric king felt irritation. Not irritation from annoyance. But irritation of the new alien feeling in his chest. </p><p>It was something he had never experienced before. He didn\u2019t quite understand it. The unknown was a scary thing, but this was something he knew he shouldn\u2019t \u2013 or even couldn\u2019t \u2013 run away from. </p><p>His face pulled back to the usual scowl. With a click of his tongue he turned back and out of the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cWhatever princess. Don\u2019t get too close, don\u2019t think you\u2019re all that special\u2026\u201d the heat was now spreading dangerously to his face. To his luck you hadn\u2019t noticed. You were just glad he was ok and back to his usual spunk.</p><p><i><b>I updated my masterlist. you can find it if you search up masterlist on my page because the links in my bio dont work as of currently, when will i fix it? idk.</b></i></p><p><i><b>FEEDBACK IS APPRECIATED</b></i></p><p><i><b>taglist: <i><b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8EcHwLzqNVZUrSTrWz62wA\">@lovecakebacon</a> @<a href=\"https://spookyscaryskjei.tumblr.com/\" title=\"hey i\u2019m stephanie!\">spookyscaryskjei</a> @<a href=\"http://sciencethatshit.tumblr.com/\" title=\"I Want To Believe\">sciencethatshit</a> @<a href=\"http://seleniumlovelevi.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\u81ea\u7531\u306e\u7ffc\">seleniumlovelevi</a></b></i></b></i><br></p>",

                "content_raw": "<p>Standing 20ft from the edge of the black hole disguised as a forest, you nervously eyed the blonde male who stared back at you with a nonchalant look on his face. Never would you have expected that venturing into the enchanted forests of the Kojin Kingdom to be on the to do list. But the flight took an unexpected landing just at the beginning of the woodland, and Bakugou hopped off like it was the most normal thing in the world.</p><p>So here you were staring straight into the dark abyss, unsure of what was happening.</p><p>\u201cWell go on.\u201d the blonde spoke.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018<i>go on</i>\u2019!? What am I supposed to do? You haven\u2019t explained what we were doing?!\u201d you glared at the male, your nerves jittery at the eerie atmosphere radiating off the forest. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going in obviously.\u201d he deadpanned.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell we gotta talk to dunceface somehow.\u201d </p><p>An exasperated expression plastered your face. </p><p><i>In there</i>? The so called \u2018Commander Dunceface\u2019 lived in the enchanted forest of Kojin Kingdom?? Was he crazy??? This man had to be absolutely mad to be living in there. </p><p>\u201cA-are you serious?\u201d </p><p>Bakugou quirked a brow at you, \u201cDid I stutter? Dunceface lives in the middle of this forest, how else is he gonna know about our plans if we don\u2019t tell him.\u201d walking into the shrubbery leading into the forest. \u201cC\u2019mon if you don\u2019t catch up, you\u2019ll get lost.\u201d turning an eye back to you, \u201c<i>and may never come out</i>.\u201d</p><p>You gulped down the large lump that had formed in your throat while your nerves jumbled up uneasiness in your stomach, threatening to resurface your breakfast from that morning. Running to catch up with the male, your hands found purchase in his red cape and your face lingering near his shoulder. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you scared?\u201d a smirk pulling Bakugou\u2019s lips as he teased you. </p><p>\u201cLike hell! Look at this place, it would give anyone the creeps! It\u2019s like a black hole!\u201d </p><p>Bakugou chuckled, mentally gloating to himself about how you were chickening out again. But he saved his retorts back for now. He had to focus at the task at hand and keep at high alert. It was no secret that the enchanted forests of Kojin Kingdom were the most dangerous in all the land. No one would ever dare to enter \u2013 or even think about it. Stories be told that whomever stepped foot into the forests of Kojin Kingdom, were never seen again. Presumingly eaten by the ferocious beasts that resided in the forest or lost with no direction out. It went by various nicknames such as, the Forest of Hell, Black Abyss, Suicide Forest, and a personal favorite; the Heart of Kojin, because it was like a representation of the King\u2019s bottomless, soulless, gaping black hole of a heart.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Every little noise or even a slight movement caught in your peripheral vision made you jump. It was so dark and foggy within the forest, you were grateful that Bakugou\u2019s red cape stuck out like a burning flame amidst the fog so it wasn\u2019t hard to miss him. The male also held a small lantern to light the way. But other than the small fire lighting just around your bodies, everything else around you was pitch black and hard to make out with even a squint of the eye. </p><p>You kept yourself so close to Bakugou you were practically hugging him the whole way and your legs knocked into each other a few times, earning annoyed remarks from the male. </p><p>\u201cQuit walking so close to me! You\u2019re being too damn clingy!!!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t help it! I can\u2019t see shit! It\u2019s too dark I hate it here!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell suck it up we\u2019re almost there.\u201d</p><p>You took a deep breath. <i>\u2018We\u2019re almost there. Alright, I can do this.\u2019</i></p><p>You two walked for a little more, unbeknownst a figure was quietly sneaking up behind the two. You hadn\u2019t heard it, or sensed it, or even felt it\u2019s slight breath blow against the skin of your neck. Simply brushing it off taking it as the wind. </p><p>That\u2019s when it stuck out it\u2019s long slippery tongue, taking a nice feathery lick to your neck.</p><p>In an instant your eyes widened and your pupils shrunk to dots, and a high pitched ripped through the air. You threw yourself off Bakugou, stumbling back onto the ground flat on your butt. </p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck!?\u201d Bakugou yelled, shining the lantern to unmask the beast from the darkness. It\u2019s form looked like a large black blob of tar, with no eyes and just a large mouth making the features of what you could assume was the head. It\u2019s sharp jagged teeth was stained with blood of past victims and its long tongue was dripping with saliva. It\u2019s claws were long skinny bones but pierced through the ground like drills. Your body was frozen, your mind screamed for you to move but fear weighed you down pinning you in your spot. </p><p>Bakugou drew his sword, charging towards the monster and slashing its legs, immobilizing it momentarily before it could regenerate. It was enough to buy a little time for him to pull you off your feet and start running. \u201cGet off your ass and run idiot!\u201d you were still in shock and Bakugou had to hold onto you to build up your pace. You heard the beast screaming behind you and the growing thuds of footsteps gaining up to the two of you. The ground beneath you was shaking with each of the beasts heavy stomping, and the reverberation was rapidly increasing as it wasn\u2019t now just one monster chasing after you, but 5 more. </p><p>You came to an abrupt halt as your path was blocked by 3 beasts, and 3 others slowly sauntering behind you. \u201cShit!\u201d Bakugou whispered to himself, tightly clutching his sword and bending down into a battle stance. \u201cGet back princess or you might get cut.\u201d he warned. Worry was washing over you, feeling a bit uneasy about letting him take all 6 monsters on his own. It wasn\u2019t that you thought he was weak \u2013 far from it. You didn\u2019t see that it was right for him to shoulder all the work. He took pride in his combat skill and would show it off any opportunity he got, but you didn\u2019t see this was the right moment for a\u00a0\u2018Kingdom\u2019s Got Talent\u2019.</p><p>Bakugou lunged towards the beast once again, swinging his sword and slicing against its thick black skin. Another beast jumped in the air towards you, and you reacted quick enough to dodge out of the way, but you instantly regretted the move as it was heading straight towards the ash blonde. </p><p>\u201cKatuski! Look out behind you!\u201d you screamed. Bakugou turned and quickly sliced his blade through the throat of the beast. It fell to the ground with a loud thud and smoke started oozing out of his open wound and its body shriveled down until to what made it look like a flimsy plastic bag. </p><p><i>\u2018So you have to pierce it\u2019s throat for it to die\u2019</i> you observed. Your thoughts were interrupted when 2 other beasts darted towards Bakugou. He was left defenseless as one took hold of his sword in its mouth and another was able to sink its fangs into his left leg. The blonde let out a loud groan, gritting his teeth enduring the throbbing pain in his leg. </p><p>\u201cKatsuki!!!\u201d</p><p>The fresh scent of blood put the beasts in a frenzy, growing hungrier and hungrier for the flesh of a human. All 5 of the remaining beasts turned their attention to Bakugou\u2019s open wounds, finding it more enticing than you who was standing in the open and easy access. Bakugou set off a few explosions from his palms trying to pry them further away from him to create an opening for himself. But they were regenerating faster than he could blast. As he was busy trying to blow away one beast, another bit Bakugou\u2019s right arm and he let out another a scream as it gnawed at the bone.</p><p>\u201cNo!!! Katsuki!!!\u201d you screamed, tears falling down your face as you watched in horror as the beasts ate at his taut flesh. You had to do something, standing and wailing wasn\u2019t going to do anything. You felt as useless as a silly movie heroine. What were you doing watching let these unknown monsters eat the man you owe your life to. </p><p><i>\u2018No. I had to do something.\u2019 </i></p><p>If you could stand up against the King of Kojin, then why couldn\u2019t you stand up to some measly beasts? Had you only had balls to talk against Bakugou but not to fight off some beasts.</p><p>Scaredy cat. Coward. Crybaby.</p><p>You took a shaky breath focused on summoning your power. You learned from accidents that your power was harder to control when your emotions were unstable. Under tremendous amount of stress, agony, anxiety, sadness, pressure. There were multiple times where you had unintentionally summoned a hell chain during a tantrum or you were denied permission seeing your family when you were younger. Or during the instance when your power had first manifested and had killed your kidnappers. If not under proper control, it could haywire end up hurting someone you cared for. So it took a clear mind and full concentration to do it right.\u00a0</p><p>Successfully you were able to summon a hell beast. This one taking the form of a giant black cat. It\u2019s black fur unruly, and blending in with the blackness of the forest. It\u2019s yellow eyes penetrating the dark, making it seem like it was just a floating pair of eyes if it weren\u2019t for the deafening hiss it let out. </p><p><i>\u2018Protect Katsuki.\u2019</i></p><p>Blades shot all around you, cutting through the air, and piercing through the bodies of the beasts. Chains twisting and wrapping tightly around the limbs and fat bodies of the animals, making blood spilling out of their mouths. The chains squeezed and pulled until their thick bodies exploded into a million pieces. Guts and blood splattered onto you and Bakugou like a red rain, but you could care less about the insides of some monsters littering your hair, as there were more important matters to attend to at the moment.</p><p>\u201cOh my god Katsuki! Are you okay!!\u201d immediately inspecting his wounded arm and leg. He winced in pain when you touched his arm, retracting it back and muttering a quick apology, biting your lip in guilt. \u201cSorry\u2026 I should\u2019ve done something sooner\u2026then you wouldn\u2019t have gotten hurt\u2026\u201d you mumbled, avoiding his gaze. Your chest felt sour, you couldn\u2019t forgive yourself for letting his injuries get so bad. For standing there like an idiot. For not protecting yourself. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, this is nothing. I\u2019ve been through worse.\u201d </p><p>You shifted your gaze back to him. Your eyes brimming with tears and your brows furrowed in frustration, \u201cNo! It\u2019s my fault! You were going to get eaten and it was all because of me!!!\u201d </p><p>Bakugou clicked his tongue, a small smirk on his lips. He used his uninjured hand to place it on top of your head. \u201cLook at you being all apologetic. Don\u2019t sweat it kid. I\u2019m stronger than you think, like those monsters were gonna keep me down.\u201d but you pouted, looking down at your hands that gripped at the fabric of your dress. The tears that flooded your eyes were streaming down your face and falling onto the backs of your hands. You let your hair hang over your face to curtain your tears but Bakugou took notice.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cH-hey! Don\u2019t cry I said this was nothing! So quit worrying alright!!!\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut still..\u201d your voice a worried whisper. A tired sigh escapes his throat, he runs his good hand through his unruly hair. He was never good at comforting and he didn\u2019t see it was the right time to start now. You still had a task at hand and he wasn\u2019t sure if he could even walk, let alone stand up on his own. And you surely weren\u2019t going to get far if you kept crying and sulking.</p><p>\u201cJust- tch, you can make it up to me some other time. Right now we need to get to the dunceface\u2019s place, so help me up.\u201d </p><p>You obliged, and shifted to his left side to pull him up and sling his uninjured arm around your shoulders, being cautious not to bump into his wounded leg. He was still able to walk, with your support, and the pain was bearable as long as you went at a slow pace. </p><p>\u201cSo you gonna put Cheshire cat away or what?\u201d referring to the beast you summoned earlier. Shaking your head and concentrating on keeping your legs a good distance from his own to avoid inflicting pain to his open wounds. \u201cI\u2019ll keep him out just in case any other monsters come.\u201d it was pretty hard to focus on the path in front of you, while simultaneously controlling your power and holding up your strength to support Bakugou.\u00a0</p><p>But you had to do what you can, so complaining was out of the question. You were still feeling ridiculously guilty.</p><p>He hummed in response, and the rest of the walk was pretty silent. You felt more at ease now, with your cat friend looming over you for protection. Soon a small cabin came into view. Walking up to the door you gave it a heavy knock with the hand that wasn\u2019t holding onto Bakugou. Waiting a few moments until it creaked open, displaying a yellow haired man with a black zig-zagged streak across his fringe.</p><p>\u201cWell hello there~\u201d he eyed you with a flirty gaze. \u201cWhat may a little lady like you be doing out here?\u201d he asked, looking you up and down, \u201cOi! Dunceface!\u201d, \u201cOh and Bakugou is here too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust let us in idiot. We gotta discuss the war plan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright alright.\u201d he shrugs, \u201cSeems like you got in a bit of trouble.\u201d pointing to his wounds. </p><p>\u201cShut it drooly, mind your fucking business.\u201d the male moves out of the doorway, inviting you both into his home.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah whatever you say. Want me to get you a first aid kit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need that shi-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes please!\u201d you interrupt the blonde and he shoots you a glare. \u201cLet me do this.\u201d you whisper, giving him a sympathetic look. He is reluctant to you helping him anymore but he gives in. He knew you felt guilty and you still owe him. </p><p>\u201cFine have it your way\u2026\u201d</p><p>The yellow haired male leads you into his bathroom and places the disinfectant and bandages on the counter. </p><p>\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d you bow, \u201cPlease, a beautiful lady like yourself should call me by my name. Kaminari Denki at your service.\u201d he winks at you and the ash blonde groans in annoyance at his flirty fiasco.</p><p>\u201cOh my god just bandage me up already so we can finish this shit and leave.\u201d he grumbles. \u201cOk Mr. Grumpy, I\u2019ll leave you two alone and prepare some tea.\u201d Kaminari excuses himself to leave you and the blonde to your business. You start by pouring some of the disinfectant on a cloth, \u201cThis is going to sting a bit.\u201d you warn, and start patting it against his skin. The ash blonde hisses and flinches away from your touch. \u201cFuck! that shit hurts!\u201d , \u201cI know that\u2019s why I said it was going to sting. Now stay still!\u201d holding his arm and patting at his wound again. After 10 minutes of curses and hissing, you completely disinfected is wounds. Now all that was left was wrapping his arm and leg up in bandages. He tried to push you away and do it himself but you insisted.</p><p>\u201cAgain\u2026 I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d you said in a soft voice. </p><p>\u201cI told you not to worry about it. You made it up to me now so it\u2019s ok.\u201d you finished wrapping him up, looking at him and your (e/c) orbs locked with his crimson ones. You hadn\u2019t noticed this whole time, as you were busy patching him up, but he had been staring at you while you weren\u2019t looking. His face was unusually calm. The furrow that always settled between his brows were instead on yours, and his expression was much softer. Nothing you had expected to ever see on Bakugou. </p><p>You felt a bit of heat rush to your face under his gaze. Your brow furrowed deeper in confusion, but a small yelp escaped your lips when Bakugou flicked a finger at the space right between your eyebrows. </p><p>\u201cOw! What was that for!?\u201d pressing your hands to your forehead, glaring at the male.</p><p>\u201cQuit frowning, you\u2019ll get wrinkles.\u201d you pout, \u201cLike you\u2019re one to talk. You grouch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever let\u2019s finish business here so we can go home.\u201d right as he opens the door, you stop him with a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re in trouble don\u2019t be afraid to ask me for help\u2026 ok? I\u2019m here to help you after all.\u201d You pause, softening your expression a bit, \u201cAnd when you\u2019re hurt I\u2019ll take care of you, so don\u2019t push me away\u2026\u201d you looked down at your feet. The words that came out of your mouth were\u2026 <i>odd</i>. You found more solace for the hot-headed king, and with the war coming up you deemed it right just to be more cooperative. Toning down the attitude was going to be hard but this was a start.</p><p>Bakugou just stared at you. Your words leaving him a bit speechless. Never had he ever had anyone lend a hand to him. He absolutely resented help. It made him feel weak, helpless, limp and vulnerable. He wanted to do everything on his own and in his own way. He was so used to pushing people away, having people hate him, repel him, curse him. Anyone who ever dared to hold a hand out to him, it only left a scar on him and the other. Thus resulting in his negative social impression.</p><p>And that\u2019s how he liked it, and how he intended to keep it.\u00a0</p><p>But instead of feeling the usual fire he was accustomed to; fire that was born out of rage and hatred. This was a different fire, a more <i>comforting</i> fire. A fire that swelled in his chest and spread throughout his body like a blanket that warmed you up on a cold winter night. In that moment the barbaric king felt irritation. Not irritation from annoyance. But irritation of the new alien feeling in his chest. </p><p>It was something he had never experienced before. He didn\u2019t quite understand it. The unknown was a scary thing, but this was something he knew he shouldn\u2019t \u2013 or even couldn\u2019t \u2013 run away from. </p><p>His face pulled back to the usual scowl. With a click of his tongue he turned back and out of the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cWhatever princess. Don\u2019t get too close, don\u2019t think you\u2019re all that special\u2026\u201d the heat was now spreading dangerously to his face. To his luck you hadn\u2019t noticed. You were just glad he was ok and back to his usual spunk.</p><p><i><b>I updated my masterlist. you can find it if you search up masterlist on my page because the links in my bio dont work as of currently, when will i fix it? idk.</b></i></p><p><i><b>FEEDBACK IS APPRECIATED</b></i></p><p><i><b>taglist: <i><b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8EcHwLzqNVZUrSTrWz62wA\">@lovecakebacon</a> @<a href=\"https://spookyscaryskjei.tumblr.com/\" title=\"hey i\u2019m stephanie!\">spookyscaryskjei</a> @<a href=\"http://sciencethatshit.tumblr.com/\" title=\"I Want To Believe\">sciencethatshit</a> @<a href=\"http://seleniumlovelevi.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\u81ea\u7531\u306e\u7ffc\">seleniumlovelevi</a></b></i></b></i><br></p>",
                "content": "<p>Standing 20ft from the edge of the black hole disguised as a forest, you nervously eyed the blonde male who stared back at you with a nonchalant look on his face. Never would you have expected that venturing into the enchanted forests of the Kojin Kingdom to be on the to do list. But the flight took an unexpected landing just at the beginning of the woodland, and Bakugou hopped off like it was the most normal thing in the world.</p><p>So here you were staring straight into the dark abyss, unsure of what was happening.</p><p>&ldquo;Well go on.&rdquo; the blonde spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean &lsquo;<i>go on</i>&rsquo;!? What am I supposed to do? You haven&rsquo;t explained what we were doing?!&rdquo; you glared at the male, your nerves jittery at the eerie atmosphere radiating off the forest. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going in obviously.&rdquo; he deadpanned.</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well we gotta talk to dunceface somehow.&rdquo; </p><p>An exasperated expression plastered your face. </p><p><i>In there</i>? The so called &lsquo;Commander Dunceface&rsquo; lived in the enchanted forest of Kojin Kingdom?? Was he crazy??? This man had to be absolutely mad to be living in there. </p><p>&ldquo;A-are you serious?&rdquo; </p><p>Bakugou quirked a brow at you, &ldquo;Did I stutter? Dunceface lives in the middle of this forest, how else is he gonna know about our plans if we don&rsquo;t tell him.&rdquo; walking into the shrubbery leading into the forest. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon if you don&rsquo;t catch up, you&rsquo;ll get lost.&rdquo; turning an eye back to you, &ldquo;<i>and may never come out</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>You gulped down the large lump that had formed in your throat while your nerves jumbled up uneasiness in your stomach, threatening to resurface your breakfast from that morning. Running to catch up with the male, your hands found purchase in his red cape and your face lingering near his shoulder. </p><p>&ldquo;What are you scared?&rdquo; a smirk pulling Bakugou&rsquo;s lips as he teased you. </p><p>&ldquo;Like hell! Look at this place, it would give anyone the creeps! It&rsquo;s like a black hole!&rdquo; </p><p>Bakugou chuckled, mentally gloating to himself about how you were chickening out again. But he saved his retorts back for now. He had to focus at the task at hand and keep at high alert. It was no secret that the enchanted forests of Kojin Kingdom were the most dangerous in all the land. No one would ever dare to enter &ndash; or even think about it. Stories be told that whomever stepped foot into the forests of Kojin Kingdom, were never seen again. Presumingly eaten by the ferocious beasts that resided in the forest or lost with no direction out. It went by various nicknames such as, the Forest of Hell, Black Abyss, Suicide Forest, and a personal favorite; the Heart of Kojin, because it was like a representation of the King&rsquo;s bottomless, soulless, gaping black hole of a heart.</p><p>Every little noise or even a slight movement caught in your peripheral vision made you jump. It was so dark and foggy within the forest, you were grateful that Bakugou&rsquo;s red cape stuck out like a burning flame amidst the fog so it wasn&rsquo;t hard to miss him. The male also held a small lantern to light the way. But other than the small fire lighting just around your bodies, everything else around you was pitch black and hard to make out with even a squint of the eye. </p><p>You kept yourself so close to Bakugou you were practically hugging him the whole way and your legs knocked into each other a few times, earning annoyed remarks from the male. </p><p>&ldquo;Quit walking so close to me! You&rsquo;re being too damn clingy!!!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I-I can&rsquo;t help it! I can&rsquo;t see shit! It&rsquo;s too dark I hate it here!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well suck it up we&rsquo;re almost there.&rdquo;</p><p>You took a deep breath. <i>&lsquo;We&rsquo;re almost there. Alright, I can do this.&rsquo;</i></p><p>You two walked for a little more, unbeknownst a figure was quietly sneaking up behind the two. You hadn&rsquo;t heard it, or sensed it, or even felt it&rsquo;s slight breath blow against the skin of your neck. Simply brushing it off taking it as the wind. </p><p>That&rsquo;s when it stuck out it&rsquo;s long slippery tongue, taking a nice feathery lick to your neck.</p><p>In an instant your eyes widened and your pupils shrunk to dots, and a high pitched ripped through the air. You threw yourself off Bakugou, stumbling back onto the ground flat on your butt. </p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck!?&rdquo; Bakugou yelled, shining the lantern to unmask the beast from the darkness. It&rsquo;s form looked like a large black blob of tar, with no eyes and just a large mouth making the features of what you could assume was the head. It&rsquo;s sharp jagged teeth was stained with blood of past victims and its long tongue was dripping with saliva. It&rsquo;s claws were long skinny bones but pierced through the ground like drills. Your body was frozen, your mind screamed for you to move but fear weighed you down pinning you in your spot. </p><p>Bakugou drew his sword, charging towards the monster and slashing its legs, immobilizing it momentarily before it could regenerate. It was enough to buy a little time for him to pull you off your feet and start running. &ldquo;Get off your ass and run idiot!&rdquo; you were still in shock and Bakugou had to hold onto you to build up your pace. You heard the beast screaming behind you and the growing thuds of footsteps gaining up to the two of you. The ground beneath you was shaking with each of the beasts heavy stomping, and the reverberation was rapidly increasing as it wasn&rsquo;t now just one monster chasing after you, but 5 more. </p><p>You came to an abrupt halt as your path was blocked by 3 beasts, and 3 others slowly sauntering behind you. &ldquo;Shit!&rdquo; Bakugou whispered to himself, tightly clutching his sword and bending down into a battle stance. &ldquo;Get back princess or you might get cut.&rdquo; he warned. Worry was washing over you, feeling a bit uneasy about letting him take all 6 monsters on his own. It wasn&rsquo;t that you thought he was weak &ndash; far from it. You didn&rsquo;t see that it was right for him to shoulder all the work. He took pride in his combat skill and would show it off any opportunity he got, but you didn&rsquo;t see this was the right moment for a&nbsp;&lsquo;Kingdom&rsquo;s Got Talent&rsquo;.</p><p>Bakugou lunged towards the beast once again, swinging his sword and slicing against its thick black skin. Another beast jumped in the air towards you, and you reacted quick enough to dodge out of the way, but you instantly regretted the move as it was heading straight towards the ash blonde. </p><p>&ldquo;Katuski! Look out behind you!&rdquo; you screamed. Bakugou turned and quickly sliced his blade through the throat of the beast. It fell to the ground with a loud thud and smoke started oozing out of his open wound and its body shriveled down until to what made it look like a flimsy plastic bag. </p><p><i>&lsquo;So you have to pierce it&rsquo;s throat for it to die&rsquo;</i> you observed. Your thoughts were interrupted when 2 other beasts darted towards Bakugou. He was left defenseless as one took hold of his sword in its mouth and another was able to sink its fangs into his left leg. The blonde let out a loud groan, gritting his teeth enduring the throbbing pain in his leg. </p><p>&ldquo;Katsuki!!!&rdquo;</p><p>The fresh scent of blood put the beasts in a frenzy, growing hungrier and hungrier for the flesh of a human. All 5 of the remaining beasts turned their attention to Bakugou&rsquo;s open wounds, finding it more enticing than you who was standing in the open and easy access. Bakugou set off a few explosions from his palms trying to pry them further away from him to create an opening for himself. But they were regenerating faster than he could blast. As he was busy trying to blow away one beast, another bit Bakugou&rsquo;s right arm and he let out another a scream as it gnawed at the bone.</p><p>&ldquo;No!!! Katsuki!!!&rdquo; you screamed, tears falling down your face as you watched in horror as the beasts ate at his taut flesh. You had to do something, standing and wailing wasn&rsquo;t going to do anything. You felt as useless as a silly movie heroine. What were you doing watching let these unknown monsters eat the man you owe your life to. </p><p><i>&lsquo;No. I had to do something.&rsquo; </i></p><p>If you could stand up against the King of Kojin, then why couldn&rsquo;t you stand up to some measly beasts? Had you only had balls to talk against Bakugou but not to fight off some beasts.</p><p>Scaredy cat. Coward. Crybaby.</p><p>You took a shaky breath focused on summoning your power. You learned from accidents that your power was harder to control when your emotions were unstable. Under tremendous amount of stress, agony, anxiety, sadness, pressure. There were multiple times where you had unintentionally summoned a hell chain during a tantrum or you were denied permission seeing your family when you were younger. Or during the instance when your power had first manifested and had killed your kidnappers. If not under proper control, it could haywire end up hurting someone you cared for. So it took a clear mind and full concentration to do it right.&nbsp;</p><p>Successfully you were able to summon a hell beast. This one taking the form of a giant black cat. It&rsquo;s black fur unruly, and blending in with the blackness of the forest. It&rsquo;s yellow eyes penetrating the dark, making it seem like it was just a floating pair of eyes if it weren&rsquo;t for the deafening hiss it let out. </p><p><i>&lsquo;Protect Katsuki.&rsquo;</i></p><p>Blades shot all around you, cutting through the air, and piercing through the bodies of the beasts. Chains twisting and wrapping tightly around the limbs and fat bodies of the animals, making blood spilling out of their mouths. The chains squeezed and pulled until their thick bodies exploded into a million pieces. Guts and blood splattered onto you and Bakugou like a red rain, but you could care less about the insides of some monsters littering your hair, as there were more important matters to attend to at the moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god Katsuki! Are you okay!!&rdquo; immediately inspecting his wounded arm and leg. He winced in pain when you touched his arm, retracting it back and muttering a quick apology, biting your lip in guilt. &ldquo;Sorry&hellip; I should&rsquo;ve done something sooner&hellip;then you wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten hurt&hellip;&rdquo; you mumbled, avoiding his gaze. Your chest felt sour, you couldn&rsquo;t forgive yourself for letting his injuries get so bad. For standing there like an idiot. For not protecting yourself. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it, this is nothing. I&rsquo;ve been through worse.&rdquo; </p><p>You shifted your gaze back to him. Your eyes brimming with tears and your brows furrowed in frustration, &ldquo;No! It&rsquo;s my fault! You were going to get eaten and it was all because of me!!!&rdquo; </p><p>Bakugou clicked his tongue, a small smirk on his lips. He used his uninjured hand to place it on top of your head. &ldquo;Look at you being all apologetic. Don&rsquo;t sweat it kid. I&rsquo;m stronger than you think, like those monsters were gonna keep me down.&rdquo; but you pouted, looking down at your hands that gripped at the fabric of your dress. The tears that flooded your eyes were streaming down your face and falling onto the backs of your hands. You let your hair hang over your face to curtain your tears but Bakugou took notice.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;H-hey! Don&rsquo;t cry I said this was nothing! So quit worrying alright!!!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;But still..&rdquo; your voice a worried whisper. A tired sigh escapes his throat, he runs his good hand through his unruly hair. He was never good at comforting and he didn&rsquo;t see it was the right time to start now. You still had a task at hand and he wasn&rsquo;t sure if he could even walk, let alone stand up on his own. And you surely weren&rsquo;t going to get far if you kept crying and sulking.</p><p>&ldquo;Just- tch, you can make it up to me some other time. Right now we need to get to the dunceface&rsquo;s place, so help me up.&rdquo; </p><p>You obliged, and shifted to his left side to pull him up and sling his uninjured arm around your shoulders, being cautious not to bump into his wounded leg. He was still able to walk, with your support, and the pain was bearable as long as you went at a slow pace. </p><p>&ldquo;So you gonna put Cheshire cat away or what?&rdquo; referring to the beast you summoned earlier. Shaking your head and concentrating on keeping your legs a good distance from his own to avoid inflicting pain to his open wounds. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep him out just in case any other monsters come.&rdquo; it was pretty hard to focus on the path in front of you, while simultaneously controlling your power and holding up your strength to support Bakugou.&nbsp;</p><p>But you had to do what you can, so complaining was out of the question.

Want me to get you a first aid kit?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need that shi-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes please!&rdquo; you interrupt the blonde and he shoots you a glare. &ldquo;Let me do this.&rdquo; you whisper, giving him a sympathetic look. He is reluctant to you helping him anymore but he gives in. He knew you felt guilty and you still owe him. </p><p>&ldquo;Fine have it your way&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>The yellow haired male leads you into his bathroom and places the disinfectant and bandages on the counter. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo; you bow, &ldquo;Please, a beautiful lady like yourself should call me by my name.

You haven&rsquo;t explained what we were doing?!&rdquo; you glared at the male, your nerves jittery at the eerie atmosphere radiating off the forest. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going in obviously.&rdquo; he deadpanned.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well we gotta talk to dunceface somehow.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>An exasperated expression plastered your face. </p>\n<p><i>In there</i>? The so called &lsquo;Commander Dunceface&rsquo; lived in the enchanted forest of Kojin Kingdom?? Was he crazy??? This man had to be absolutely mad to be living in there. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;A-are you serious?&rdquo; </p>\n<p>Bakugou quirked a brow at you, &ldquo;Did I stutter? Dunceface lives in the middle of this forest, how else is he gonna know about our plans if we don&rsquo;t tell him.&rdquo; walking into the shrubbery leading into the forest. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon if you don&rsquo;t catch up, you&rsquo;ll get lost.&rdquo; turning an eye back to you, &ldquo;<i>and may never come out</i>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>You gulped down the large lump that had formed in your throat while your nerves jumbled up uneasiness in your stomach, threatening to resurface your breakfast from that morning. Running to catch up with the male, your hands found purchase in his red cape and your face lingering near his shoulder. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;What are you scared?&rdquo; a smirk pulling Bakugou&rsquo;s lips as he teased you. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Like hell! Look at this place, it would give anyone the creeps! It&rsquo;s like a black hole!&rdquo; </p>\n<p>Bakugou chuckled, mentally gloating to himself about how you were chickening out again. But he saved his retorts back for now. He had to focus at the task at hand and keep at high alert. It was no secret that the enchanted forests of Kojin Kingdom were the most dangerous in all the land. No one would ever dare to enter &ndash; or even think about it. Stories be told that whomever stepped foot into the forests of Kojin Kingdom, were never seen again. Presumingly eaten by the ferocious beasts that resided in the forest or lost with no direction out. It went by various nicknames such as, the Forest of Hell, Black Abyss, Suicide Forest, and a personal favorite; the Heart of Kojin, because it was like a representation of the King&rsquo;s bottomless, soulless, gaping black hole of a heart.</p>\n</p>",
