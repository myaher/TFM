The truth is that Peter was jealous, and both of them knew that, so instead of replying, rather than arguing over it, Peter sat in silence, standing before Tony with arms laid out across his chest. </p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s not the vibe I\u2019m getting. Really though, <i>your eyes</i>, they speak for you,\u201d Tony continued. </p><p>Rubbing his elbow, Peter shifted his weight from one foot to the other. They both stood in his room, in May\u2019s apartment with May waiting patiently in the living for their return. Malevolent enough, the youngest of the three came home, walked in on a sweet, indulgent conversation between Tony and May, something close and personal, nice and warm, a bit too warm.

Tony let it happen, even pushed, kissing back, gasping into Peter\u2019s mouth. And with May on the other side of the door, approaching and calling out Peter\u2019s name, they could easily be busted any second now. </p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d </p><p>Removing his wet lips from Tony\u2019s, he craned his neck back. \u201cJust a second May-\u201c </p><p>\u201cDear, can\u2019t it just wait till later? Mr. stark doesn\u2019t have a lot of time and I-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI told you-\u201c he stammered, slamming his eyes shut as Tony\u2019s teeth sank down on his neck, swiftly flipping the two of them so that his arms effortlessly isolated Peter, simultaneously pressing his chin upwards too. \u201cIt\u2019s- it\u2019s- important,\u201d he croaked, and feeling tingly inside and warm all over, Peter began to sweat. Sloppily kissing the area beneath Peter\u2019s ear, tasting the salt of skin, licking and biting, Tony marked Peter, painted his body, wrote detailed poems on his skin like he owned him, <i>which made sense</i>. To Peter, Tony was his, and of course Tony knew that, and if he had to say something about it, anything at all, well Peter was his too, and he\u2019d claim and mark what was his, what belonged to him, <i>his property</i>, any day. </p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Tony left Peter\u2019s saturated skin for a second, coming back down to lap at his mouth before pulling away, \u201cyou\u2019re not jealous?\u201d </p>",
                "content": "<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not jealous.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You sure about that, <i>Mr. Parker</i>?&rdquo; Tony chimed, pompous and smug. </p><p>Peter looked at him, full of disgust and spite, wanting nothing more than to take his perfect suit tie in his hands and knock some sense into him. The truth is that Peter was jealous, and both of them knew that, so instead of replying, rather than arguing over it, Peter sat in silence, standing before Tony with arms laid out across his chest. </p><p>&ldquo;Because that&rsquo;s not the vibe I&rsquo;m getting. Really though, <i>your eyes</i>, they speak for you,&rdquo; Tony continued. </p><p>Rubbing his elbow, Peter shifted his weight from one foot to the other. They both stood in his room, in May&rsquo;s apartment with May waiting patiently in the living for their return. Malevolent enough, the youngest of the three came home, walked in on a sweet, indulgent conversation between Tony and May, something close and personal, nice and warm, a bit too warm. Peter hated it, and after dropping his belongings on the floor, merely tossing his backpack down to his feet, he was quick to pull Tony away. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey May-&ldquo; he had said, pausing at the sight of Tony sitting next to her. The two of them had been smiling, laughing, staring into each other&rsquo;s eyes like they were floating, as if Peter hadn&rsquo;t just walked in. It was absolutely <i>disgusting</i>. &ldquo;Oh. Mr. Stark- what are you- hey?&rdquo; </p><p>Neither of them pulled away to acknowledge Peter&rsquo;s presence, and things were getting a bit.. awkward, and if Peter had to sit there any longer while the two of them gushed about the weather, he might have thrown up. &ldquo;Yeah, okay, that&rsquo;s enough of that.&rdquo; Blood boiling and ears dusted red, Peter approached May, cuffed Tony by the back of his jacket and hauled him off of the couch, ultimately out of May&rsquo;s face. Nearly tripping in the rug, Tony stumbled to gather his footing, and it all seemed fake. </p><p>He may have fallen into May&rsquo;s heart, but it wasn&rsquo;t mutual. She didn&rsquo;t have he same effect on him that he had on her, and it was probably because of his extensive history with women, so in actuality, all things said and done, he might have <i>felt her</i>, but he didn&rsquo;t actually<i> feel for her</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Parker-&ldquo; Tony began as Peter pulled him out of the room. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh Peter! Hi hunny-&ldquo; May&rsquo;s voice followed, &ldquo;How was your day?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, good, enough of that though-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you going sweetheart?&rdquo;</p><p>With the roll of his eyes, not that May or Tony could see it, Peter was fuming, &ldquo;Oh y&rsquo;know, just, just gotta talk to Mr. Stark for a second, it&rsquo;s-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t it wait hunny?&rdquo; </p><p>Peter shook his head, voice bouncing, &ldquo;<i>No</i>, if you had let me <i>finish</i>, you would have heard me tell you that it&rsquo;s very important.&rdquo; An attitude began to seep into his tone of voice, &ldquo;So no, it absolutely cannot wait.&rdquo; </p><p>May&rsquo;s protest continued, but Peter certainly didn&rsquo;t listen, and Tony wasn&rsquo;t putting up much of a fight either. With his strength, not taking into account Peter&rsquo;s abilities, Tony could have stopped him dead in his tracks, grabbed onto his wrist and pulled him off the linen of his jacket, but he didn&rsquo;t. Peter didn&rsquo;t have to try because Tony pined after him. Disregarding May&rsquo;s voice, which by the way was now faint and distant, he quickly shoved Tony down the hall and into his room, slamming and locking the door behind him. &nbsp;</p><p>So that&rsquo;s where they were: &ldquo;Jealousy, right?&rdquo; Tony smirked. </p><p>&ldquo;I said it once and I&rsquo;ll say it again, I&rsquo;m not jealous. Why would<i> I</i> ever be jealous of <i>you</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So to speak, its not <i>me</i> who you&rsquo;re jealous of,&rdquo; Tony nodded his head towards the wall, a reference to May whom of which politely sat in the living room&nbsp; awaiting the return of Tony and her nephew whom of which so rudely ruined the moment, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s her.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m. Not. Jealous</i>.&rdquo; Peter vexed, narrowing his eyes. He could have asked what they were doing earlier, why they were so close, practically in each other&rsquo;s personal bubbles, feeling each other&rsquo;s breath through the conversation, but, unable to bring himself to do so, he tapped his foot and fidgeted with his shirt. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright well,&rdquo; Tony smiled, turning around to head out the door, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re not jealous then this conversation is pointless.&rdquo; </p><p>Similar to their first encounter, Peter was quick in stopping Tony from leaving. Of course he couldn&rsquo;t web Tony&rsquo;s outstretched palm to the doorknob, but if he could, he totally would have done it. Instead, with extended arms and hands, he went after Tony, closing the slightly opened door, pinning him against the wall, voice quietly uttering out a muffled and simple <i>don&rsquo;t</i>.</p><p>Tony straightened against the framework behind him and intently looked down into Peter&rsquo;s greedy yet soft eyes. He tilted his head to the side, &ldquo;<i>Or what</i>?&rdquo; he growled. </p><p>Peter hadn&rsquo;t suspected Tony to retaliate, he didn&rsquo;t anticipate for he cockiness in his voice, but it was <i>oh so goddamn intimidating</i> // but me too Peter, me too. Choked up, Peter didn&rsquo;t know what to say, he honestly didn&rsquo;t think that he&rsquo;d make it that far, he half-heartedly expected his knees to give out, but there he was, pushing Tony Stark against the bedroom door with his aunt passively waiting on the other side. </p><p>Her footsteps had become more apparent, and she undoubtedly heard the door jump in its hinges, &ldquo;Peter?&rdquo; </p><p>Back arched, butt sticking out just right, Peter shuddered, sucking up any apparent nervousness in his body. Truly he was jealous. He was, there was no denying it. The only person who, in his book, was allowed to be that close to Tony was Peter himself, and he was upset about it. Holding the door shut, his free hand tangled itself into Tony&rsquo;s tie, and he pulled him in real close, just centimeters from brushing lips before he lowly groaned: &ldquo;Shut up.&rdquo; </p><p>And then, forcing his face into Tony&rsquo;s, he kissed him. It was invigorating. Peter was so mad, so angry at him, but so in love at the same time. He couldn&rsquo;t get enough, his scent, the up close smell of his cologne, the taste of his lips, the feel of his hot breath. Tony let it happen, even pushed, kissing back, gasping into Peter&rsquo;s mouth. And with May on the other side of the door, approaching and calling out Peter&rsquo;s name, they could easily be busted any second now. </p><p>&ldquo;Peter?&rdquo; </p><p>Removing his wet lips from Tony&rsquo;s, he craned his neck back. &ldquo;Just a second May-&ldquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Dear, can&rsquo;t it just wait till later? Mr. stark doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of time and I-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I told you-&ldquo; he stammered, slamming his eyes shut as Tony&rsquo;s teeth sank down on his neck, swiftly flipping the two of them so that his arms effortlessly isolated Peter, simultaneously pressing his chin upwards too. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s- it&rsquo;s- important,&rdquo; he croaked, and feeling tingly inside and warm all over, Peter began to sweat.

        "body": "<h1>Friday the 13th Avengers Request</h1><p>Tony was tired. </p><p>He&rsquo;d spent the last couple of days down in his lab, bent over a design he&rsquo;d been working on for weeks. If not for Pepper, he&rsquo;d have slept in there. Or, more accurately, he wouldn&rsquo;t have slept at all. </p><p>He was exhausted, though he didn&rsquo;t want to admit it. Tony crept his way to the kitchen, making a beeline for the coffee pot. Artificial energy was better than none. </p><p><br/></p><p>He sat down at the table, almost comfortable with his coffee in hand and a projection of his plans in front of his eyes, when a loud crash was heard from down the hall.</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, shit! I mean, shoot! I&rsquo;m so sorry!&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>Tony sighed, rubbing his temples. &ldquo;Peter?&rdquo; He&rsquo;d recognised the voice without having to see the teen. &ldquo;You okay in there?&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Shit, Mr. Stark!&rdquo; Peter ran into the kitchen, already energized. &ldquo;Sorry! I didn&rsquo;t mean to break it! You see, there was this ladder. Mr. Rogers was trying to reach something earlier, I think. And I was trying to avoid walking underneath it but it was in the middle of the hall, right? And so, like, I kinda bumped into your lamp.&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>Tony went silent for a second, causing Peter to start speaking again, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, Mr. Stark! I&rsquo;ll pay for it! Promise!&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>Tony waved it away, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. It was an accident, so it doesn&rsquo;t matter. But why were you avoiding the ladder, kid?&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>Peter started to open his mouth when Clint turned around on the couch, his arm across the back of it, &ldquo;Everyone knows you don&rsquo;t walk under ladders, man. It&rsquo;s common knowledge.&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>Tony ran a hand over his face, &ldquo;Barton, don&rsquo;t add on to this, would you?&rdquo; He stood, pouring himself another cup of coffee after deciding that one would not be enough for the day.</p><p><br/></p><p>Clint raised his hands in mock surrender, &ldquo;Whatever you say, Stark.&rdquo; He grinned, using Tony&rsquo;s last name since Tony had done the same to him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just saying, that today of all days, you need to be extra careful.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>Peter nodded, &ldquo;Yeah, Mr. Stark! You know what today is, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;The thirteenth of July?&rdquo; Tony responded, his question almost sounding like a statement. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Not just any July 13th! It&rsquo;s a Friday, too!&rdquo; Peter smiled happily, as if the answer was obvious and he was just glad that the was the one to tell Tony.</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s Friday the 13th.&rdquo; Tony affirmed.</p><p><br/></p><p>Clint nodded, &ldquo;Took him some time, but he got there.&rdquo; The archer crossed his legs. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t see why the hell today is any different than today.&rdquo; Tony suppressed a yawn, not wanting to show how tired he was. </p><p><br/></p><p>Clint answered before Peter could, &ldquo;Well today, my dear Watson-&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you are not Sherlock,&rdquo; Tony interjected.</p><p><br/></p><p>Clint rolled his eyes, &ldquo;Let me talk. Anyway, my dear Watson, today is the day that all bad luck is at a high. So you have to avoid all the things that normally bring bad luck, since it&rsquo;ll just be even worse today.&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s telling some good stories to you, Tony.&rdquo; Steve came walking in with Bucky, &ldquo;But they&rsquo;re not true.&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>Clint scoffed, &ldquo;Cap, come on, with that attitude, you&rsquo;re going to get the worst luck out of all of us.&rdquo; He then grinned, &ldquo;Which wouldn&rsquo;t be boring to watch.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>Peter looked genuinely worried, &ldquo;Mr. Barton, don&rsquo;t say that. You don&rsquo;t actually want Mr. Rogers to have bad luck, right?&rdquo; He looked from Clint to Steve, a wide-eyed expression staining his features.</p><p><br/></p><p>Steve set a hand on Peter&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll be fine, kid. No need to worry.&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>Bucky looked confused, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this about?&rdquo; He looked to Peter, who quickly explained what they had been talking about.</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s your opinion on it, Mr. Barnes?&rdquo; Peter asked, a light smile on his face. </p><p><br/></p><p>Bucky only shrugged, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I guess it could be real, but I&rsquo;d need some evidence to prove it.&rdquo;</p><p>Clint snapped his fingers, pointing at Bucky. He then stood, retreating to his room, &ldquo;I bet that by the end of today, you&rsquo;ll believe, Bucket. Not only that, you&rsquo;ll all believe.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve set his hands on his hips, &ldquo;Did that sound mildly threatening to anyone else?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony sighed, crossing over to take the coffee pot and head down to his lab, &ldquo;Tell me if anything else gets broken.&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>                                 ~~~</p><p><br/></p><p>Clint grinned mischievously, finally sitting back on the couch after hours had passed. The conversation had long since died down and, with the exception of Peter, no one expected anything remotely odd to happen.</p><p>As was the plan. </p><p>It was all a matter of time now.</p><p>&ldquo;Steve, are you okay?!&rdquo;</p><p>Ah. There it is.</p><p>Steve left his room, holding up several broken mirrors. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not mad. I just want to know who put all of the hand mirrors in my floor.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky was rushing out beside him, a concerned look on his face, &ldquo;Steve,&rdquo; he asked again, &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, Bucky. I had shoes on.&rdquo; Steve looked around the room, spotting Clint, Wanda, and Natasha. &ldquo;Was it one of you?&rdquo; He looked directly in Wanda&rsquo;s direction.</p><p>She frowned, &ldquo;What makes you think it was me? I was with Vis all day today.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve let out an accusing hmm. </p><p>Natasha exchanged a look with Clint and immediately knew what had happened. She didn&rsquo;t say anything, much to Clint&rsquo;s relief. </p><p>Steve just shook his head, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going to throw these away and start cleaning up the glass, then.&rdquo; The frown remained on his face, his day having been thoroughly made worse.</p><p> Clint&rsquo;s day, however, was going wonderfully. Each little prank he had set up - the ladder just outside of Peter&rsquo;s room, the black cats in Thor&rsquo;s, (though the god was much more happy to see them than Clint would&rsquo;ve thought) - each one, working smoothly and yet no one other than Nat was able to see that it was him.</p><p>Steve was somewhat dumbfounded. He sat down by Clint, his hands between his legs, &ldquo;I must say, Clinton, I wasn&rsquo;t expecting things to go this wrong today.&rdquo;</p><p>Clint kept his cool, &ldquo;I told you, man, it&rsquo;s the day. Friday the 13th gets weird at times.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve nodded, his hands still clasped together, &ldquo;Mhm. You told me so, I must admit. But you know, I was talking to Tony because you know me, I have to know who did something.&rdquo;</p><p>Clint stiffened, and he forced his shoulders to remain relaxed, &ldquo;And how&rsquo;d that go?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, Tony was busy and he didn&rsquo;t want me to bother him, but he did let me check the surveillance cameras and can you guess who I found putting mirrors in the floor of my room?&rdquo;</p><p>Clint laughed, rubbing the back of his neck, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know, Cap. Wouldn&rsquo;t, uh,&rdquo; he stopped talking, seeing Steve&rsquo;s knowing expression.</p><p>&ldquo;Would you look at that? I have to run.&rdquo; Clint left, speed walking until he turned around to see that Steve wasn&rsquo;t following him. </p><p>Clint let out the breath he&rsquo;d been holding, walking into his room. &ldquo;That could&rsquo;ve gone worse, I guess aaaand there&rsquo;s feathers on me. That&rsquo;s just fantastic.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter waved from above him. He was holding a now empty bag which had once been filled with feathers and maple syrup. &ldquo;Hi, Mr. Barton! Sorry, but you know, gotta balance out all of your new bad luck and stuff!&rdquo;</p>",

Friday the 13th gets weird at times.\u201d</p><p>Steve nodded, his hands still clasped together, \u201cMhm. You told me so, I must admit.

If not for Pepper, he\u2019d have slept in there. Or, more accurately, he wouldn\u2019t have slept at all. </p><p>He was exhausted, though he didn\u2019t want to admit it. Tony crept his way to the kitchen, making a beeline for the coffee pot. Artificial energy was better than none. </p><p><br></p><p>He sat down at the table, almost comfortable with his coffee in hand and a projection of his plans in front of his eyes, when a loud crash was heard from down the hall.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOh, shit! I mean, shoot! I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Tony sighed, rubbing his temples. \u201cPeter?\u201d He\u2019d recognised the voice without having to see the teen. \u201cYou okay in there?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cShit, Mr. Stark!\u201d Peter ran into the kitchen, already energized. \u201cSorry! I didn\u2019t mean to break it! You see, there was this ladder. Mr. Rogers was trying to reach something earlier, I think. And I was trying to avoid walking underneath it but it was in the middle of the hall, right? And so, like, I kinda bumped into your lamp.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Tony went silent for a second, causing Peter to start speaking again, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Mr. Stark! I\u2019ll pay for it! Promise!\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Tony waved it away, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. It was an accident, so it doesn\u2019t matter. But why were you avoiding the ladder, kid?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Peter started to open his mouth when Clint turned around on the couch, his arm across the back of it, \u201cEveryone knows you don\u2019t walk under ladders, man. It\u2019s common knowledge.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Tony ran a hand over his face, \u201cBarton, don\u2019t add on to this, would you?\u201d He stood, pouring himself another cup of coffee after deciding that one would not be enough for the day.</p><p><br></p><p>Clint raised his hands in mock surrender, \u201cWhatever you say, Stark.\u201d He grinned, using Tony\u2019s last name since Tony had done the same to him. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, that today of all days, you need to be extra careful.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Peter nodded, \u201cYeah, Mr. Stark! You know what today is, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThe thirteenth of July?\u201d Tony responded, his question almost sounding like a statement. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNot just any July 13th! It\u2019s a Friday, too!\u201d Peter smiled happily, as if the answer was obvious and he was just glad that the was the one to tell Tony.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s Friday the 13th.\u201d Tony affirmed.</p><p><br></p><p>Clint nodded, \u201cTook him some time, but he got there.\u201d The archer crossed his legs. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t see why the hell today is any different than today.\u201d Tony suppressed a yawn, not wanting to show how tired he was. </p><p><br></p><p>Clint answered before Peter could, \u201cWell today, my dear Watson-\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOh, you are not Sherlock,\u201d Tony interjected.</p><p><br></p><p>Clint rolled his eyes, \u201cLet me talk. Anyway, my dear Watson, today is the day that all bad luck is at a high. So you have to avoid all the things that normally bring bad luck, since it\u2019ll just be even worse today.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s telling some good stories to you, Tony.\u201d Steve came walking in with Bucky, \u201cBut they\u2019re not true.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Clint scoffed, \u201cCap, come on, with that attitude, you\u2019re going to get the worst luck out of all of us.\u201d He then grinned, \u201cWhich wouldn\u2019t be boring to watch.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Peter looked genuinely worried, \u201cMr. Barton, don\u2019t say that. You don\u2019t actually want Mr. Rogers to have bad luck, right?\u201d He looked from Clint to Steve, a wide-eyed expression staining his features.</p><p><br></p><p>Steve set a hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder, \u201cI think I\u2019ll be fine, kid. No need to worry.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Bucky looked confused, \u201cWhat\u2019s all this about?\u201d He looked to Peter, who quickly explained what they had been talking about.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s your opinion on it, Mr. Barnes?\u201d Peter asked, a light smile on his face. </p><p><br></p><p>Bucky only shrugged, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess it could be real, but I\u2019d need some evidence to prove it.\u201d</p><p>Clint snapped his fingers, pointing at Bucky. He then stood, retreating to his room, \u201cI bet that by the end of today, you\u2019ll believe, Bucket. Not only that, you\u2019ll all believe.\u201d</p><p>Steve set his hands on his hips, \u201cDid that sound mildly threatening to anyone else?\u201d</p><p>Tony sighed, crossing over to take the coffee pot and head down to his lab, \u201cTell me if anything else gets broken.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>                                 ~~~</p><p><br></p><p>Clint grinned mischievously, finally sitting back on the couch after hours had passed. The conversation had long since died down and, with the exception of Peter, no one expected anything remotely odd to happen.</p><p>As was the plan. </p><p>It was all a matter of time now.</p><p>\u201cSteve, are you okay?!\u201d</p><p>Ah.
