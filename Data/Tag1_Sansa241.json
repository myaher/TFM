His heartbeat and breathing had a calming effect on her and while she closed her eyes and breathed in and out as deeply and calmly as she could, her hand started wandering again.</p><p>Under her touch all his muscles tensed and he held his breath for a few seconds when she let the tip of her finger circle around his nipple.</p><p>Maybe it was so hard and impossible to draw Jon because his body was art in itself already. It was as if the Gods had allowed their masterpiece to roam the earth, as if they had all contributed their talents and hard work until there was nothing but perfection left.</p><p>\u201cI should hand you in for my exam\u2026\u201d She whispered while she wrapped her hands around his waist to trace the hardened muscles in his back. </p><p>\u201cWouldn&rsquo;t that be copyright infringement?\u201d Jon stroke her long red hair and Sansa\u2019s lips curled up into a smile before he kissed her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t make me.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\u2019s smile brightened and she opened her eyes again so her glance could meet his. \u201cI could make someone with you?\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s laugh echoed all around her like a warm cocoon that could keep the rest of the big bad world out. \u201cI guess you came up with that a little late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a little\u2026\u201d Sansa whispered. \u201cBut good art needs practice.\u201d She pulled her own dress over her head and kicked off her shoes. \u201cI&rsquo;ve got two years of study left. If we start practicing now, I can hand in our master piece to graduate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still have to hand in something else tomorrow\u2026\u201d Jon placed his hands on her shoulders and pushed her away. </p><p>Sansa rolled her eyes. \u201cYou&rsquo;re killing the mood here, Jon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon&rsquo;t artists create their best works when they\u2019re in terrible moods?\u201d Jon left a trace of kisses on her jaw, in her neck and on her naked shoulder.</p><p>Sansa moaned. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s sadness.\u201d She buried her sharp nails in his back and enjoyed Jon\u2019s scream hurting her ears. \u201cI like to believe that every extreme emotion works. The terrible moods and the ecstatic ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want ecstatic?\u201d Jon whispered in her ear and then he sucked on her earlobe. In one smooth movement he lifted her off the floor and carried her towards the bed in the corner. \u201cYour wish is my command, my queen.\u201d He gently placed her down, took off her briefs and spread her legs.</p><p>Yes, Sansa thought while Jon placed his hands on the insides of her thighs. She just had to get in the right mood and then she would be able to finish her art project before the deadline tomorrow.</p><p>A loud scream escaped her lips when Jon let his tongue circle around her clit.</p><p>Or maybe she would just tell her professor that the form of art she used for this project couldn\u2019t be handed in.</p>",
