It was a luxury they had afforded themselves since the flight was so\nlong.</p><p>Phil couldn\u2019t believe that the\nmajority of the tour was over already and in just a month or so it would be\nfinished.</p><p>Hour 2</p><p>Phil was starting to feel a little\nrestless. Dan was already immersed with his in flight screen and Phil was\nmindlessly playing an app on his phone. His brain was too awake and he tried,\nand failed, not to think about how long this flight would take. The flight\nattendant coming by with the wet towel and a snack helped a bit. Just a little.</p><p>Hour 3</p><p>Phil was bored and Dan had finished\nwhatever film he had been watching, so Phil saw that as a window to pester his\npartner.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it nice that we\u2019re in our own\nlittle bubble in here?\u201d Phil asked and placed his hand on the divider so Dan\ndidn\u2019t just slam it back up, which he had considered if his glance was any\nindication.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in a flight with hundreds of\nother people, Phil,\u201d Dan said in that exasperated but fond tone he often used\nwhen he thought Phil was being a bit ridiculous. </p><p>Phil just pouted.</p><p>Hour 4 and 5</p><p>Phil watched The Greatest Showman.\nDan was probably happy with the momentary silence from Phil. He might have\nregretted it a bit when Phil couldn\u2019t stop humming <i>Rewrite the Stars </i>afterwards. </p><p>At some point, Dan tired of Phil\u2019s\nhumming and he started to actually sing the song out loud himself, which\nobviously caused Phil to panic a bit and shush Dan as the eyes of their fellow\npassengers all turned to the two tall Brits.</p><p>Dan knew exactly what he had been\ndoing. He was wearing a smug grin. </p><p>\u201cSpoilsport,\u201d Phil told him but he\ncould never quite make his voice angry with Dan.</p><p>It always came out with fond\nundertones. </p><p>Hour 6</p><p>Airplane food wasn\u2019t Phil\u2019s\nfavourite but he picked at his portion anyway and afterwards dug into his bag\nfrom some of the snacks that he and Dan had bought in the airport as a back-up\nplan. Phil had spotted a jumbo pack of maltesers in the airport and he had\nsneakily bought it for the nostalgia.</p><p>He took this opportunity to throw it\nat Dan, but because of Phil\u2019s aim, it accidentally ended up smacking him in the\nface. Dan was outraged for all about a second before he shot Phil his annoyed\nlook, which looked more fond than angry.</p><p>Hour 7</p><p>Phil decided now would be a good\ntime to film a little video teasing Dan. He had been teasing him and demanding\nhis attention several times already but he knew that their viewers would\nappreciate it.</p><p>\u201cHey Dan, do you want to play I\nSpy?\u201d Phil asked, as he tipped his phone over the edge to film Dan.</p><p>Dan was grinning the moment he saw\nthe phone and Phil couldn\u2019t stop the giggles that escaped out of his throat.</p><p>\u201cGod, release me from this hell,\u201d\nDan said and lightly smacked Phil\u2019s phone.</p><p>Phil played the video over again and\nsmiled at how Dan\u2019s face changed and his voice dropped. <i>I Spy</i> was more of a joke than anything but it perfectly encompassed\nhow needy Phil could be for Dan\u2019s attention when they were travelling together.\n</p><p>Hour 8-12</p><p>As they turned the lights down, Phil\ndecided that he might try to get some sleep. He had a feeling that Dan would\nget caught up in watching something and simply forgot to sleep. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to sleep,\u201d Phil told Dan\nand rolled down the divider.</p><p>Dan paused his screen, took out one\nof his ear bud and nodded. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wake you if there\u2019s more\nfood,\u201d Dan promised.</p><p>Hour 13</p><p>Phil was stiff and grumpy when he\nwoke up but he was happy to see that he had managed to sleep almost five hours.\nHe had been stirred awake a couple of times but he had been able to go back to\nsleep.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Dan said, as he rolled\ndown the divider and handed over a glass of water to Phil. He gulped it down\nhappily.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said and then stretched\nout as much as his seat allowed. \u201cReady for I Spy now?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Phil</i>,\u201d\nDan whined.</p><p>\u201cFine, we\u2019ll do something else but\nyou will entertain me.\u201d</p><p>Dan let out a snort-laugh but\nrelented, like Phil knew he would.</p><p>Hour 14 and 15</p><p>On impulse, Phil had bought a little\nplane version of a game called Ludo with magnet pieces. It was quite hilarious trying\nto balance the tiny board between their two seats and they kept losing the\npieces, as the magnets weren\u2019t strong enough. Eventually, they gave up and got\nout their Switch and played Snipperclips. They were getting better at it and\nPhil suggested that they should give it another go at the gaming channel.</p><p>Hour 16</p><p>As the plane finally landed and they\ngot up, Phil kept glancing over at Dan.</p><p>Phil was wearing a little private\nsmile as he thought about how lucky he was to have someone to share all of\nthese new experiences with.
