Couldn't Olenna had brought it herself, it's not like guards were going to search her. I understand Littlefinger wanted to implicate Sansa so she would feel isolated but I don't get why the Tyrells went along with this unnecessarily complicated plan involving one person who isn't aware of it and might therefore inadvertently ruin everything (say she is sick and leaves the feast...)",
        "answer": "<p>It\u2019s less about being searched by the guards than it is about being observed by spies. Until the moment Olenna took the poison from Sansa\u2019s hairnet, the Tyrells had done nothing in King\u2019s Landing that would stand up as evidence that they were involved in killing Joffrey. All the actual arrangements were made out of town. Littlefinger handled the procurement of the poison. There was nothing for Varys\u2019 spies to actually <i>observe, </i>much less report on.\u00a0Even that first meeting with Sansa (the content of which Olenna was careful to conceal from Varys) only establishes their motive for murder. And when it came to Joffrey, who <i>didn\u2019t</i>\u00a0have motive?</p><p>Poisoning Joffrey at the wedding also fits Tyrell goals best. Margaery was legally married to Joffrey thanks to the ceremony, but was never alone with him and he never had the opportunity to hurt her.

For starters, Sansa deserves no punishment in the first place for acting her age, and to continue, Sansa has been shown multiple times in later books that she has outgrown her narrow notions of \u2018\u2019beauty=goodness.\u2019\u2019.\u00a0These notions aren&rsquo;t things that indicates that Sansa is a bad person deserving to be punished, but rather shows that she is childish, but children are supposed to be childish in the first place.

To continue, Tyrion and Theon get away with only wanting beautiful women with no criticism and even Jon gets away with not wanting \u2018\u2019some willowy creature who sits up in a tower, brushing her hair and waiting for some knight to rescue her, \u201c. What\u2019s really ironic about the last one is that people use Jon not wanting to be with a traditionally feminine woman as proof that him and Sansa will never be, yet Sansa wanting a handsome knight is proof that she won\u2019t get one at the end.

However, on the other hand, Sansa is a young preteen girl, which is one of the demographics most mocked by adult heterosexual men partly due to their lack of ability to relate to these girls. Therefore what they want isn\u2019t seen as important to them, whereas what characters like Jon or Tyrion wants is. Not to forget that Sansa desiring someone handsome is a problem to them because a lot of them had to deal with situations where they weren\u2019t desired by a girl they liked and wrote it off as her being\u00a0\u2018\u2019superficial\u2019\u2019 and so they want to punish Sansa for wanting someone conventionally attractive, yet the moment they or any of the male POVs do it, it\u2019s perfectly comprehensible.
