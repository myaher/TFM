I forgot I even had this account and I had thought I\u2019d put this on my queue but apparently not&hellip; Hope the people who asked to be tagged still want to be. And once again I am super sorry for not keeping my promise!\u00a0</b><b>And I just reread my sad ending and I really do not want to post it.</b></p><p>It became clear half way through seventh year that Lily had begun to reciprocate the liking that you assumed James still had for her. You had begun to spiral again, though in complete secret. Or so you thought. This time it was not Sirius who helped.</p><p><i>It was Severus Snape.</i></p><!-- more --><p>Ever since he had called Lily a\u00a0\u2018mudblood\u2019 he had been cast aside, somewhat deservedly. But you knew he liked her immensely and you also knew he would be hurting just as much as you, if not more because he had no true friends to speak of.</p><p>You started by sitting next to him in class whenever you could. That was followed by trying to walk with him in the corridors, to which he protested at first but soon warmed up to. You focused\u00a0your kindness on him and his Slytherin\u00a0\u2018friends\u2019, hoping to come across as nice rather than overbearing. You very often slipped onto his table at lunch, sometimes getting in trouble with Dumbledore at first but when he saw what you were doing, he let you be. You were attempting to not only heal from a broken heart, but to aid someone in doing the same. And that was the most selfish and yet simultaneously selfless thing you\u2019d ever done and would ever do.</p><hr><p>Your lack of presence did not go unnoticed by the Marauders. They had a lot of questions as to why you were doing this but you weren\u2019t around them enough to give them answers. Soon, they decided the only way to get your attention was to do what they did best- prank you. Well, James did anyway.</p><p>You ignored it at first. It was simple things like moving objects to trip you or purposefully nudging your ink off of the table. Or in the worst case, onto your work. A ghost would stumble through you in the halls or it would rain only when you were in the courtyard. Other students began evading you as to not get caught in the firing zone.</p><p>Even you didn\u2019t know why you were avoiding them, maybe you just needed a break at first. But they wanted you away from Snape and back to them and their pranks were driving you further away. When it came to the petty jokes, all of them were glad to join in, even Lily every so often, if it meant getting you back. Soon, though, it was just James. And he was desperate. So he came up with his best one yet.</p><p><i>Or, for you, his worst.</i></p><hr><p>The day started with you waking up to wet drizzle and your hair and entire uniform being bright red. You didn\u2019t know how you were in your uniform seen as you had distinctly remembered putting on your pajamas but these facts weren\u2019t the biggest issue. You heard a lot of giggling around you and, as you looked up, you came to the realisation that your bed was in the middle of the courtyard and that was why you were soaking.\u00a0</p><p>Considering crying then and there, you began searching for the culprit. You knew who it was but it didn\u2019t make it any less painful when your eyes found him- James, giggling to himself while looking at you.</p><p>No one that was under the shelter could see the tears streaming down your face as the rain masked it. No one was doing anything. There were no teachers to be seen. You just decided to pull your covers up over your head and stay there until class started and everyone left. Well, that was your plan until you heard the yelling of Severus Snape. You could tell who it was and who he was shouting at without coming out from under your covers. When you assumed everyone was watching their back and forth, which sounded like it was getting pretty close to violence, you snuck out.\u00a0</p><p>As soon as you had gotten to an empty section of what was sweet, sweet shelter, you heard the first utterance of an incantation. You looked to the two boys and saw that James must have used\u00a0<i>Colloshoo </i>to stick Snape\u2019s feet to the ground and halt his charge towards him. In retaliation, Severus shot back\u00a0<i>Anteoculatia</i>, rather ironically making the other male\u2019s head sprout antlers.<br/></p><p>You could not lie, you were chuckling a bit despite your melancholy. Spells were continuously thrown around for a few minutes and, amazingly, there was not a teacher in sight. Most students had stuck around long after the bell had gone. Dumbledore or some other poor adult was bound to come around sooner or later. You averted your gaze and began to treck to Professor McGonagall\u2019s classroom, knowing that she had a free lesson and that she could help you in your current predicament, hopefully without asking questions seen as, clearly, Potter was about to get in enough trouble as it is.</p><p>\n\n<i>\u201cTarantallegra!\u201d</i>\u00a0<br/></p><p><i>\u201cEbublio!\u201d</i><br/></p><p><i>\u201cDucklifors<i>!\u201d</i><br/></i></p><p>That was the final, slightly muffled spell before everything went silent. You were still outside, having not been close to an entrance to the halls. Whipping your head around, you were met with the sight of James encased in a large bubble with his antlers just about grazing the top whilst Snape was nowhere to be seen. In his stead was a duck. You truly hadn\u2019t known that your (ex?) friend/crush had been so good as transfiguration, let alone human transformations! You stood stock still for a few moments, just staring at the boy as he countered the bubble hex. After doing so, he looked slowly around, his eyes settling on you. You stayed like that for what felt like an eternity. His irises seemed to be pleading with you. Now what they were pleading for, you could not figure out.</p><p>A few moments later, you broke eye contact and decided to continue your stroll to McGonagall, only this time with another purpose. You almost forgot to grab the duck that was flapping around but you remembered your friend and saw it best that you bring him. Restraining him under your arm, you set off to your destination. Luckily, no students were in the halls bar the ones who were scurrying away from the courtyard.</p><hr><p>\u201cUm, Professor, may I come in?\u201d You asked through the gap in the door.<br/></p><p>\u201cOf course my de- whatever happened to you? And why do you have a duck?\u201d The kind woman inquired incredulously as you stepped into her classroom.<br/></p><p>\u201cSomething happened&hellip; Can you help me change my hair, my clothes and Severus back?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThis is Severus Snape?! I suppose this is Potter\u2019s doing then.\u201d<br/></p><p>You gave no agreement but your silence confirmed her theory. She took the bird out of your arms, layed it on the ground and muttered a spell, transforming it back into a boy. He seemed dazed and didn\u2019t speak, just stayed sat on the floor. Meanwhile, McGonagall fixed your hair and your uniform, returning them to their original colouring.</p><p>\u201cI suggest you bring the poor child to the hospital wing and then go to class. Tell your professor that you were with me. I\u2019ll have to talk to Mr Potter as his head of house. Goodbye, (Y/N).\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBye, Professor. Thank you so much!\u201d<br/></p><p>And with that, you left for the infirmary.</p><hr><p>\u201c(Y/N), you can\u2019t ignore me forever!\u201d James whined from behind you. You sped up even more.<br/></p><p>\u201cYes I can, asshole.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry! I\u2019ve told you about a hundred times. Forgive me already!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cTry harder, that\u2019s not enough.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You then turned into potions class, your last class of the day (thankfully), and headed towards your new usual seat besides Severus. Unfortuantely, Remus was sat there instead. He shot you an apologetic smile and you immediately realised that this was a set up. There were only two seats left in the farthest corner from Slughorn\u2019s desk and you groaned, glaring at Potter over your shoulder before taking your seat.<br/></p><p>About 10 minutes in, you were told to set about making a Draught of Peace in partners, which would prove a rather daunting task seen as you were utterly distracted by the boy you liked/hated <i>and</i> the instructions needed to be followed to the letter. This was an advanced potion and, being in the Slug Club, there was a lot of pressure on you to get this exactly right.</p><p>Ignoring James, you had managed to sort out all the ingredients that you would need. You had trusted him with organising the cauldron and making sure the temperature was right, stressing the importance of lowering the temperature of the flames before the final addition of hellbore.</p><p>Everything went perfectly despite the snarky comments and groaning on your partner\u2019s end. You did most of the work and all the colour changes, stirring and ingredient adding went to plan. The potion was now pure white, it was James\u2019 time to turn down the flames. Instead, assumably because of his distraction with trying to get your attention, he accidentally highered the temperature and the fire licked at his robes as the cauldron bubbled dangerously.</p><p>Everyone in the room backed away and Slughorn had begun making his way over, slowly. Thinking on your feet, you used a <i>Protego</i> charm to create a barrier between the unstable potion and everyone in the room just as a precaution, keeping this up, you grabbed the flaming boy by the collar of his robes that was untouched by the fire and brought him to the door, gesturing for the other pupils to leave too by pointing her head. Slughorn had moved over to deal with the issue as everyone exited the classroom.\u00a0</p><p>Remus gave you a pat on the back, chuckling a little. You giggled lightly until you remembered James who may have been burning to death for all you knew. Turning to him you sighed in relief upon seeing him grinning up at you, clearly having put out the fire on his clothes. His unperturbed demeaner lasted only a few seconds as he soon winced and looked at his side. There, a fairly large burn could be seen where the flames had melted away the layers of his clothes.</p><p>You held his arm away from the wound and looked at it. It looked far too terrible for you to try to help as healing spells were definitely not your strong suit. Deciding to take him to Madam Pomfrey, you asked Snape to tell Slughorn why you and Potter would be gone.</p><p>Setting out on your little journey, you thought about how this was your second time at the hospital wing that day. The matron might think you were the problem here and not the boy you were escorting. Your arm was draped carefully around him, cautious not to touch his burn. There was no real reason for this, he could stand on his own perfectly well, he had just taken your hand and put it there and you would feel awkward pulling away. You were both silent as you walked down the hall, only occasionally stealing glances at one another.</p><p>When you finally arrived, you told him to lie down on a nearby bed and looked for Madam Pomfrey. You explained what had happened and laughed a little when she told you how many times this exact thing had happened. Apparently, a fifth year called Sybill Trelawney had made the same mistake just a week ago and she wasn\u2019t even supposed to be studying such an advanced potion.</p><p>She made her way over to James and told him to lie still. She then headed towards a cupboard, grabbed a pot of orange paste. When she applied it to the injury, the boy let out a relaxed breath, alleviated from the pain. The matron recommended he stay led down for a while while the medicine did its work and then left to tend to a broken arm. You turned to leave too but your hand was gripped by James\u2019 who was, admittedly, stronger than you, so there was no use in trying to pull away. You turned to him and, to your surprise, he looked saddened.</p><p>\u201cI am actually sorry about the past few weeks. Today especially. I just missed you.\u201d His voice expressed his melancholy.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s- it\u2019s fine, forget it. Let\u2019s just go back to normal, okay? I reckon you\u2019re gonna get enough of a bollocking later anyway.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOh thank the bloody stars. So, what should we talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know, you start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, how are you and Severus doing?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat? What the ever loving hell does that mean?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you dating?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOh my goodness, no! He\u2019s just my friend. <i>Emos aren\u2019t really my type&hellip;</i>\u00a0Wait, is that why you were mad, because you thought I was with your most diabolical enemy?!\u201d You did a dramatic, silly voice for the last part and burst into laughter before regaining your composure.\u00a0\u201cTalking about people who are <i>actually</i> dating, how are you and Lily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re the wrong one. Ha! We aren\u2019t dating.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI thought you liked her, though?\u201d<br/></p><p>James sighed slightly, sitting up, putting his elbow on his knee and leaning his head on his hand whilst looking at you. He seemed to think for a second, as if trying to decipher his thoughts and string them together into a sentence.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, not anymore at least. I think I like someone else, I\u2019m not sure whether to tell her. What do you think?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cUm, well. I guess it depends who she is.

You had begun to spiral again, though in complete secret. Or so you thought. This time it was not Sirius who helped.</p><p><i>It was Severus Snape.</i></p>[[MORE]]<p>Ever since he had called Lily a\u00a0\u2018mudblood\u2019 he had been cast aside, somewhat deservedly. But you knew he liked her immensely and you also knew he would be hurting just as much as you, if not more because he had no true friends to speak of.</p><p>You started by sitting next to him in class whenever you could. That was followed by trying to walk with him in the corridors, to which he protested at first but soon warmed up to. You focused\u00a0your kindness on him and his Slytherin\u00a0\u2018friends\u2019, hoping to come across as nice rather than overbearing. You very often slipped onto his table at lunch, sometimes getting in trouble with Dumbledore at first but when he saw what you were doing, he let you be. You were attempting to not only heal from a broken heart, but to aid someone in doing the same. And that was the most selfish and yet simultaneously selfless thing you\u2019d ever done and would ever do.</p><hr><p>Your lack of presence did not go unnoticed by the Marauders. They had a lot of questions as to why you were doing this but you weren\u2019t around them enough to give them answers. Soon, they decided the only way to get your attention was to do what they did best- prank you. Well, James did anyway.</p><p>You ignored it at first. It was simple things like moving objects to trip you or purposefully nudging your ink off of the table. Or in the worst case, onto your work. A ghost would stumble through you in the halls or it would rain only when you were in the courtyard. Other students began evading you as to not get caught in the firing zone.</p><p>Even you didn\u2019t know why you were avoiding them, maybe you just needed a break at first. But they wanted you away from Snape and back to them and their pranks were driving you further away. When it came to the petty jokes, all of them were glad to join in, even Lily every so often, if it meant getting you back. Soon, though, it was just James. And he was desperate. So he came up with his best one yet.</p><p><i>Or, for you, his worst.</i></p><hr><p>The day started with you waking up to wet drizzle and your hair and entire uniform being bright red. You didn\u2019t know how you were in your uniform seen as you had distinctly remembered putting on your pajamas but these facts weren\u2019t the biggest issue. You heard a lot of giggling around you and, as you looked up, you came to the realisation that your bed was in the middle of the courtyard and that was why you were soaking.\u00a0</p><p>Considering crying then and there, you began searching for the culprit. You knew who it was but it didn\u2019t make it any less painful when your eyes found him- James, giggling to himself while looking at you.</p><p>No one that was under the shelter could see the tears streaming down your face as the rain masked it. No one was doing anything. There were no teachers to be seen. You just decided to pull your covers up over your head and stay there until class started and everyone left. Well, that was your plan until you heard the yelling of Severus Snape. You could tell who it was and who he was shouting at without coming out from under your covers. When you assumed everyone was watching their back and forth, which sounded like it was getting pretty close to violence, you snuck out.\u00a0</p><p>As soon as you had gotten to an empty section of what was sweet, sweet shelter, you heard the first utterance of an incantation. You looked to the two boys and saw that James must have used\u00a0<i>Colloshoo </i>to stick Snape\u2019s feet to the ground and halt his charge towards him. In retaliation, Severus shot back\u00a0<i>Anteoculatia</i>, rather ironically making the other male\u2019s head sprout antlers.<br></p><p>You could not lie, you were chuckling a bit despite your melancholy. Spells were continuously thrown around for a few minutes and, amazingly, there was not a teacher in sight. Most students had stuck around long after the bell had gone. Dumbledore or some other poor adult was bound to come around sooner or later. You averted your gaze and began to treck to Professor McGonagall\u2019s classroom, knowing that she had a free lesson and that she could help you in your current predicament, hopefully without asking questions seen as, clearly, Potter was about to get in enough trouble as it is.</p><p>\n\n<i>\u201cTarantallegra!\u201d</i>\u00a0<br></p><p><i>\u201cEbublio!\u201d</i><br></p><p><i>\u201cDucklifors<i>!\u201d</i><br></i></p><p>That was the final, slightly muffled spell before everything went silent. You were still outside, having not been close to an entrance to the halls. Whipping your head around, you were met with the sight of James encased in a large bubble with his antlers just about grazing the top whilst Snape was nowhere to be seen. In his stead was a duck. You truly hadn\u2019t known that your (ex?) friend/crush had been so good as transfiguration, let alone human transformations! You stood stock still for a few moments, just staring at the boy as he countered the bubble hex. After doing so, he looked slowly around, his eyes settling on you. You stayed like that for what felt like an eternity. His irises seemed to be pleading with you. Now what they were pleading for, you could not figure out.</p><p>A few moments later, you broke eye contact and decided to continue your stroll to McGonagall, only this time with another purpose. You almost forgot to grab the duck that was flapping around but you remembered your friend and saw it best that you bring him. Restraining him under your arm, you set off to your destination. Luckily, no students were in the halls bar the ones who were scurrying away from the courtyard.</p><hr><p>\u201cUm, Professor, may I come in?\u201d You asked through the gap in the door.<br></p><p>\u201cOf course my de- whatever happened to you? And why do you have a duck?\u201d The kind woman inquired incredulously as you stepped into her classroom.<br></p><p>\u201cSomething happened\u2026 Can you help me change my hair, my clothes and Severus back?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThis is Severus Snape?! I suppose this is Potter\u2019s doing then.\u201d<br></p><p>You gave no agreement but your silence confirmed her theory. She took the bird out of your arms, layed it on the ground and muttered a spell, transforming it back into a boy. He seemed dazed and didn\u2019t speak, just stayed sat on the floor. Meanwhile, McGonagall fixed your hair and your uniform, returning them to their original colouring.</p><p>\u201cI suggest you bring the poor child to the hospital wing and then go to class. Tell your professor that you were with me. I\u2019ll have to talk to Mr Potter as his head of house. Goodbye, (Y/N).\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBye, Professor. Thank you so much!\u201d<br></p><p>And with that, you left for the infirmary.</p><hr><p>\u201c(Y/N), you can\u2019t ignore me forever!\u201d James whined from behind you. You sped up even more.<br></p><p>\u201cYes I can, asshole.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry! I\u2019ve told you about a hundred times. Forgive me already!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cTry harder, that\u2019s not enough.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You then turned into potions class, your last class of the day (thankfully), and headed towards your new usual seat besides Severus. Unfortuantely, Remus was sat there instead. He shot you an apologetic smile and you immediately realised that this was a set up. There were only two seats left in the farthest corner from Slughorn\u2019s desk and you groaned, glaring at Potter over your shoulder before taking your seat.<br></p><p>About 10 minutes in, you were told to set about making a Draught of Peace in partners, which would prove a rather daunting task seen as you were utterly distracted by the boy you liked/hated <i>and</i> the instructions needed to be followed to the letter. This was an advanced potion and, being in the Slug Club, there was a lot of pressure on you to get this exactly right.</p><p>Ignoring James, you had managed to sort out all the ingredients that you would need. You had trusted him with organising the cauldron and making sure the temperature was right, stressing the importance of lowering the temperature of the flames before the final addition of hellbore.</p><p>Everything went perfectly despite the snarky comments and groaning on your partner\u2019s end. You did most of the work and all the colour changes, stirring and ingredient adding went to plan. The potion was now pure white, it was James\u2019 time to turn down the flames. Instead, assumably because of his distraction with trying to get your attention, he accidentally highered the temperature and the fire licked at his robes as the cauldron bubbled dangerously.</p><p>Everyone in the room backed away and Slughorn had begun making his way over, slowly. Thinking on your feet, you used a <i>Protego</i> charm to create a barrier between the unstable potion and everyone in the room just as a precaution, keeping this up, you grabbed the flaming boy by the collar of his robes that was untouched by the fire and brought him to the door, gesturing for the other pupils to leave too by pointing her head. Slughorn had moved over to deal with the issue as everyone exited the classroom.\u00a0</p><p>Remus gave you a pat on the back, chuckling a little. You giggled lightly until you remembered James who may have been burning to death for all you knew. Turning to him you sighed in relief upon seeing him grinning up at you, clearly having put out the fire on his clothes. His unperturbed demeaner lasted only a few seconds as he soon winced and looked at his side. There, a fairly large burn could be seen where the flames had melted away the layers of his clothes.</p><p>You held his arm away from the wound and looked at it. It looked far too terrible for you to try to help as healing spells were definitely not your strong suit. Deciding to take him to Madam Pomfrey, you asked Snape to tell Slughorn why you and Potter would be gone.</p><p>Setting out on your little journey, you thought about how this was your second time at the hospital wing that day. The matron might think you were the problem here and not the boy you were escorting. Your arm was draped carefully around him, cautious not to touch his burn. There was no real reason for this, he could stand on his own perfectly well, he had just taken your hand and put it there and you would feel awkward pulling away. You were both silent as you walked down the hall, only occasionally stealing glances at one another.</p><p>When you finally arrived, you told him to lie down on a nearby bed and looked for Madam Pomfrey. You explained what had happened and laughed a little when she told you how many times this exact thing had happened. Apparently, a fifth year called Sybill Trelawney had made the same mistake just a week ago and she wasn\u2019t even supposed to be studying such an advanced potion.</p><p>She made her way over to James and told him to lie still. She then headed towards a cupboard, grabbed a pot of orange paste. When she applied it to the injury, the boy let out a relaxed breath, alleviated from the pain. The matron recommended he stay led down for a while while the medicine did its work and then left to tend to a broken arm. You turned to leave too but your hand was gripped by James\u2019 who was, admittedly, stronger than you, so there was no use in trying to pull away. You turned to him and, to your surprise, he looked saddened.</p><p>\u201cI am actually sorry about the past few weeks. Today especially. I just missed you.\u201d His voice expressed his melancholy.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s- it\u2019s fine, forget it. Let\u2019s just go back to normal, okay? I reckon you\u2019re gonna get enough of a bollocking later anyway.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh thank the bloody stars. So, what should we talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know, you start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, how are you and Severus doing?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat? What the ever loving hell does that mean?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you dating?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh my goodness, no! He\u2019s just my friend. <i>Emos aren\u2019t really my type\u2026</i>\u00a0Wait, is that why you were mad, because you thought I was with your most diabolical enemy?!\u201d You did a dramatic, silly voice for the last part and burst into laughter before regaining your composure.\u00a0\u201cTalking about people who are <i>actually</i> dating, how are you and Lily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re the wrong one. Ha! We aren\u2019t dating.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI thought you liked her, though?\u201d<br></p><p>James sighed slightly, sitting up, putting his elbow on his knee and leaning his head on his hand whilst looking at you. He seemed to think for a second, as if trying to decipher his thoughts and string them together into a sentence.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, not anymore at least. I think I like someone else, I\u2019m not sure whether to tell her. What do you think?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cUm, well. I guess it depends who she is. If it\u2019s Lucinda Talkalot, that probably wouldn\u2019t be the best idea. She\u2019d beat you with her broomstick.\u201d<br></p><p>He chuckled lightly.\u00a0\u201cWhat if it was you?\u201d</p><p>Your breath suddenly hitched and you felt your face heat up.

You focused\u00a0your kindness on him and his Slytherin\u00a0\u2018friends\u2019, hoping to come across as nice rather than overbearing. You very often slipped onto his table at lunch, sometimes getting in trouble with Dumbledore at first but when he saw what you were doing, he let you be. You were attempting to not only heal from a broken heart, but to aid someone in doing the same. And that was the most selfish and yet simultaneously selfless thing you\u2019d ever done and would ever do.</p><hr><p>Your lack of presence did not go unnoticed by the Marauders. They had a lot of questions as to why you were doing this but you weren\u2019t around them enough to give them answers. Soon, they decided the only way to get your attention was to do what they did best- prank you. Well, James did anyway.</p><p>You ignored it at first. It was simple things like moving objects to trip you or purposefully nudging your ink off of the table. Or in the worst case, onto your work. A ghost would stumble through you in the halls or it would rain only when you were in the courtyard. Other students began evading you as to not get caught in the firing zone.</p><p>Even you didn\u2019t know why you were avoiding them, maybe you just needed a break at first. But they wanted you away from Snape and back to them and their pranks were driving you further away. When it came to the petty jokes, all of them were glad to join in, even Lily every so often, if it meant getting you back. Soon, though, it was just James. And he was desperate. So he came up with his best one yet.</p><p><i>Or, for you, his worst.</i></p><hr><p>The day started with you waking up to wet drizzle and your hair and entire uniform being bright red. You didn\u2019t know how you were in your uniform seen as you had distinctly remembered putting on your pajamas but these facts weren\u2019t the biggest issue. You heard a lot of giggling around you and, as you looked up, you came to the realisation that your bed was in the middle of the courtyard and that was why you were soaking.\u00a0</p><p>Considering crying then and there, you began searching for the culprit. You knew who it was but it didn\u2019t make it any less painful when your eyes found him- James, giggling to himself while looking at you.</p><p>No one that was under the shelter could see the tears streaming down your face as the rain masked it. No one was doing anything. There were no teachers to be seen. You just decided to pull your covers up over your head and stay there until class started and everyone left. Well, that was your plan until you heard the yelling of Severus Snape. You could tell who it was and who he was shouting at without coming out from under your covers. When you assumed everyone was watching their back and forth, which sounded like it was getting pretty close to violence, you snuck out.\u00a0</p><p>As soon as you had gotten to an empty section of what was sweet, sweet shelter, you heard the first utterance of an incantation. You looked to the two boys and saw that James must have used\u00a0<i>Colloshoo </i>to stick Snape\u2019s feet to the ground and halt his charge towards him. In retaliation, Severus shot back\u00a0<i>Anteoculatia</i>, rather ironically making the other male\u2019s head sprout antlers.<br></p><p>You could not lie, you were chuckling a bit despite your melancholy. Spells were continuously thrown around for a few minutes and, amazingly, there was not a teacher in sight. Most students had stuck around long after the bell had gone. Dumbledore or some other poor adult was bound to come around sooner or later. You averted your gaze and began to treck to Professor McGonagall\u2019s classroom, knowing that she had a free lesson and that she could help you in your current predicament, hopefully without asking questions seen as, clearly, Potter was about to get in enough trouble as it is.</p><p>\n\n<i>\u201cTarantallegra!\u201d</i>\u00a0<br></p><p><i>\u201cEbublio!\u201d</i><br></p><p><i>\u201cDucklifors<i>!\u201d</i><br></i></p><p>That was the final, slightly muffled spell before everything went silent. You were still outside, having not been close to an entrance to the halls. Whipping your head around, you were met with the sight of James encased in a large bubble with his antlers just about grazing the top whilst Snape was nowhere to be seen. In his stead was a duck. You truly hadn\u2019t known that your (ex?) friend/crush had been so good as transfiguration, let alone human transformations! You stood stock still for a few moments, just staring at the boy as he countered the bubble hex. After doing so, he looked slowly around, his eyes settling on you. You stayed like that for what felt like an eternity. His irises seemed to be pleading with you. Now what they were pleading for, you could not figure out.</p><p>A few moments later, you broke eye contact and decided to continue your stroll to McGonagall, only this time with another purpose. You almost forgot to grab the duck that was flapping around but you remembered your friend and saw it best that you bring him. Restraining him under your arm, you set off to your destination. Luckily, no students were in the halls bar the ones who were scurrying away from the courtyard.</p><hr><p>\u201cUm, Professor, may I come in?\u201d You asked through the gap in the door.<br></p><p>\u201cOf course my de- whatever happened to you? And why do you have a duck?\u201d The kind woman inquired incredulously as you stepped into her classroom.<br></p><p>\u201cSomething happened\u2026 Can you help me change my hair, my clothes and Severus back?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThis is Severus Snape?! I suppose this is Potter\u2019s doing then.\u201d<br></p><p>You gave no agreement but your silence confirmed her theory. She took the bird out of your arms, layed it on the ground and muttered a spell, transforming it back into a boy. He seemed dazed and didn\u2019t speak, just stayed sat on the floor. Meanwhile, McGonagall fixed your hair and your uniform, returning them to their original colouring.</p><p>\u201cI suggest you bring the poor child to the hospital wing and then go to class. Tell your professor that you were with me. I\u2019ll have to talk to Mr Potter as his head of house. Goodbye, (Y/N).\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBye, Professor. Thank you so much!\u201d<br></p><p>And with that, you left for the infirmary.</p><hr><p>\u201c(Y/N), you can\u2019t ignore me forever!\u201d James whined from behind you. You sped up even more.<br></p><p>\u201cYes I can, asshole.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry! I\u2019ve told you about a hundred times. Forgive me already!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cTry harder, that\u2019s not enough.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You then turned into potions class, your last class of the day (thankfully), and headed towards your new usual seat besides Severus. Unfortuantely, Remus was sat there instead. He shot you an apologetic smile and you immediately realised that this was a set up. There were only two seats left in the farthest corner from Slughorn\u2019s desk and you groaned, glaring at Potter over your shoulder before taking your seat.<br></p><p>About 10 minutes in, you were told to set about making a Draught of Peace in partners, which would prove a rather daunting task seen as you were utterly distracted by the boy you liked/hated <i>and</i> the instructions needed to be followed to the letter. This was an advanced potion and, being in the Slug Club, there was a lot of pressure on you to get this exactly right.</p><p>Ignoring James, you had managed to sort out all the ingredients that you would need. You had trusted him with organising the cauldron and making sure the temperature was right, stressing the importance of lowering the temperature of the flames before the final addition of hellbore.</p><p>Everything went perfectly despite the snarky comments and groaning on your partner\u2019s end. You did most of the work and all the colour changes, stirring and ingredient adding went to plan. The potion was now pure white, it was James\u2019 time to turn down the flames. Instead, assumably because of his distraction with trying to get your attention, he accidentally highered the temperature and the fire licked at his robes as the cauldron bubbled dangerously.</p><p>Everyone in the room backed away and Slughorn had begun making his way over, slowly. Thinking on your feet, you used a <i>Protego</i> charm to create a barrier between the unstable potion and everyone in the room just as a precaution, keeping this up, you grabbed the flaming boy by the collar of his robes that was untouched by the fire and brought him to the door, gesturing for the other pupils to leave too by pointing her head. Slughorn had moved over to deal with the issue as everyone exited the classroom.\u00a0</p><p>Remus gave you a pat on the back, chuckling a little. You giggled lightly until you remembered James who may have been burning to death for all you knew. Turning to him you sighed in relief upon seeing him grinning up at you, clearly having put out the fire on his clothes. His unperturbed demeaner lasted only a few seconds as he soon winced and looked at his side. There, a fairly large burn could be seen where the flames had melted away the layers of his clothes.</p><p>You held his arm away from the wound and looked at it. It looked far too terrible for you to try to help as healing spells were definitely not your strong suit. Deciding to take him to Madam Pomfrey, you asked Snape to tell Slughorn why you and Potter would be gone.</p><p>Setting out on your little journey, you thought about how this was your second time at the hospital wing that day. The matron might think you were the problem here and not the boy you were escorting. Your arm was draped carefully around him, cautious not to touch his burn. There was no real reason for this, he could stand on his own perfectly well, he had just taken your hand and put it there and you would feel awkward pulling away. You were both silent as you walked down the hall, only occasionally stealing glances at one another.</p><p>When you finally arrived, you told him to lie down on a nearby bed and looked for Madam Pomfrey. You explained what had happened and laughed a little when she told you how many times this exact thing had happened. Apparently, a fifth year called Sybill Trelawney had made the same mistake just a week ago and she wasn\u2019t even supposed to be studying such an advanced potion.</p><p>She made her way over to James and told him to lie still. She then headed towards a cupboard, grabbed a pot of orange paste. When she applied it to the injury, the boy let out a relaxed breath, alleviated from the pain. The matron recommended he stay led down for a while while the medicine did its work and then left to tend to a broken arm. You turned to leave too but your hand was gripped by James\u2019 who was, admittedly, stronger than you, so there was no use in trying to pull away. You turned to him and, to your surprise, he looked saddened.</p><p>\u201cI am actually sorry about the past few weeks. Today especially. I just missed you.\u201d His voice expressed his melancholy.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s- it\u2019s fine, forget it. Let\u2019s just go back to normal, okay? I reckon you\u2019re gonna get enough of a bollocking later anyway.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh thank the bloody stars. So, what should we talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know, you start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, how are you and Severus doing?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat? What the ever loving hell does that mean?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you dating?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh my goodness, no! He\u2019s just my friend. <i>Emos aren\u2019t really my type\u2026</i>\u00a0Wait, is that why you were mad, because you thought I was with your most diabolical enemy?!\u201d You did a dramatic, silly voice for the last part and burst into laughter before regaining your composure.\u00a0\u201cTalking about people who are <i>actually</i> dating, how are you and Lily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re the wrong one. Ha! We aren\u2019t dating.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI thought you liked her, though?\u201d<br></p><p>James sighed slightly, sitting up, putting his elbow on his knee and leaning his head on his hand whilst looking at you. He seemed to think for a second, as if trying to decipher his thoughts and string them together into a sentence.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, not anymore at least. I think I like someone else, I\u2019m not sure whether to tell her. What do you think?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cUm, well. I guess it depends who she is. If it\u2019s Lucinda Talkalot, that probably wouldn\u2019t be the best idea. She\u2019d beat you with her broomstick.\u201d<br></p><p>He chuckled lightly.\u00a0\u201cWhat if it was you?\u201d</p><p>Your breath suddenly hitched and you felt your face heat up. Just then, you noticed his hand was still holding yours. Everything seemed more obvious now in the awkward silence, you could almost physically feel the tension. Maybe he didn\u2019t mean it the way it sounded to you. Maybe he was joking. Maybe-</p><p>\u201cSorry, that was uncomfortable. I understand if you don\u2019t like me that way anymore. Or at all, really.\u201d He spoke, interrupting your thoughts with his crestfallen mutters.<br></p><p>\u201cNo! I do like you, it\u2019s just\u2026 I don\u2019t even know. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d ever like me back. I was trying to make it so you could spend as much time with Lily as possible rather than deal with me. It felt like I was always a little bit in the way, that\u2019s partially why I started avoiding you. That and because it became clear that she likes you back. I even gave up on being head girl to let you be near her more, I mean-\u201d<br></p><p>And with that, you were cut off. You were pulled down to James and he kissed you softly. His lips were soft and they felt perfect on yours, almost like two pieces of a jigsaw fixing together. Your train of thought just completely halted as you savoured the moment, only just about hearing the clearing of a throat behind you. Separating from him, you turned to see McGonagall and Dumbledore looking at you.</p><p>\u201cI see you made up after this morning.\u201d The woman spoke, obviously amused with the situation.\u00a0\u201cUnfortunately, that does not excuse turning a peer into a duck, Mr Potter. You are dismissed (Y/N), we need to speak with the boy.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOf course, Professor.\u201d You choked out, blushing furiously. Turning to leave, you almost missed the knowing smile and wink from the Headmaster that only fuelled your burning cheeks.<br></p><hr><p><b>Thank you to <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOyCwgfYHs5aEIEk5hk7FVg\" target=\"_blank\">@herdefendortrash</a> and the two anonymous asks for encouraging me a long while ago.

You had begun to spiral again, though in complete secret. Or so you thought. This time it was not Sirius who helped.</p><p><i>It was Severus Snape.</i></p><p>Ever since he had called Lily a&nbsp;&lsquo;mudblood&rsquo; he had been cast aside, somewhat deservedly.

Maybe he didn&rsquo;t mean it the way it sounded to you. Maybe he was joking. Maybe-</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, that was uncomfortable. I understand if you don&rsquo;t like me that way anymore. Or at all, really.&rdquo; He spoke, interrupting your thoughts with his crestfallen mutters.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No! I do like you, it&rsquo;s just&hellip; I don&rsquo;t even know. I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d ever like me back. I was trying to make it so you could spend as much time with Lily as possible rather than deal with me. It felt like I was always a little bit in the way, that&rsquo;s partially why I started avoiding you. That and because it became clear that she likes you back. I even gave up on being head girl to let you be near her more, I mean-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>And with that, you were cut off. You were pulled down to James and he kissed you softly. His lips were soft and they felt perfect on yours, almost like two pieces of a jigsaw fixing together. Your train of thought just completely halted as you savoured the moment, only just about hearing the clearing of a throat behind you. Separating from him, you turned to see McGonagall and Dumbledore looking at you.</p><p>&ldquo;I see you made up after this morning.&rdquo; The woman spoke, obviously amused with the situation.&nbsp;&ldquo;Unfortunately, that does not excuse turning a peer into a duck, Mr Potter. You are dismissed (Y/N), we need to speak with the boy.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Of course, Professor.&rdquo; You choked out, blushing furiously. Turning to leave, you almost missed the knowing smile and wink from the Headmaster that only fuelled your burning cheeks.<br /></p><hr /><p><b>Thank you to <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOyCwgfYHs5aEIEk5hk7FVg\" target=\"_blank\">@herdefendortrash</a> and the two anonymous asks for encouraging me a long while ago.
