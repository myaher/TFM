There are a lot of what look like contradictions to Caduceus and how he interacts with people, ways he shows affection and emotion that really don\u2019t resemble how anyone else approaches the group. We can see, for instance, that he very much views his role as that of an adviser and a caretaker\u2013it\u2019s what he\u2019s good at, the type of social script he learned at the Grove, and it\u2019s also what he likes to do. He only began liking his time on the ocean once he started feeling\u00a0\u201cuseful\u201d to the group, like his skills were Helping Them Achieve Something. His primary form of communication after Confusion is Sage Metaphors, and the sheer strength and stubborness with which he holds to his particular ideas about how the universe works and how it is appropriate to act results in him constantly offering somewhat forceful, somewhat parental/coach-like advice to the others. That\u2019s not to say Caduceus thinks of himself as a parent, but his focus seems to be on Helping Them Become Emotionally Stable and Helping Them Reach Their Potential, (while they help him reach his), while at the same time he holds very <i>specific</i> ideas about good ways vs bad ways for them to reach that potential.\u00a0</p><p>And he cares for them in other ways too\u2013Caduceus, arguably even more so than Caleb and Jester is a compulsive gift-giver, a crafty DIY guy who makes things for the sole purpose of giving them away\u2013fixing a sword for Fjord, making copper door chimes for Caleb, taking a single spare moment in the Barbed Fields to weave a sunhat for Yasha. His projects, even when they\u2019re simple, show a great deal of thoughtfulness and are made for functionality\u2013 showing understanding of Fjord\u2019s need to be useful, Caleb\u2019s ever-present anxiety and paranoia, hell, Yasha being pale and likely to burn! He takes gifts that <i>other people</i> have given him, like the tree, and makes it into a communal area for <b><i>all </i></b>of them, with spaces for all of their gods.\u00a0</p><p>So it\u2019s true that he cares about them, but it\u2019s also true that he holds them at a remove. At a time when Caleb and Jester are calling the M9 a <b>family</b>, Caduceus is drawing lines in the sand\u2013in his religious conversation with Fjord, he talks about \u201chis\u201d <i>family</i>, and \u201cFjord\u2019s\u201d <i>friends. </i>Because Caduceus already has a family, and not one that can be restructured and absorbed into the M9, like Nott\u2019s family and Jester\u2019s mother can. A family that doesn\u2019t actually resemble whatever mess the M9 are to each other. Caduceus keeps to formal address, and while this is a quirk I personally <i><b>nevereverever</b></i> want to go away, it shows not only politeness but a reluctance to engage on a familiar level, to acknowledge a personal and enduring attachment.</p><p>If I were to speculate, I believe Caduceus is viewing his project and his attachments with the M9 as transitory and somewhat professional in nature. Not in the same way Fjord thinks it\u2019s transitory, in that Fjord refuses to decorate his room and fears either they will pack up and leave or he will be personally booted from the group the second he\u2019s not professionally useful so there\u2019s no use getting comfortable. Caduceus\u2019 version is more that he sees a definite End to the M9\u2032s relationship, and believes they are following a Direction, however meandering, towards that End. Once they have helped each other fulfill their destinies, Caduceus imagines himself going back to the Grove and continuing to do what his family has done for generations, what they are Supposed To Do. Just like how you handle a mourner in the Grove by offering them help and guidance, and keeping a professional distance before sending them off to live their life away from you, it looks like Caduceus is treating the M9 in large part as a collection of mourners he can offer mutual aid before they set themselves free of each other.</p><p>The trouble is that the M9 aren\u2019t customers and mourners it\u2019s necessary to keep a professional distance from, they probably wouldn\u2019t want to float out of his life when all is said and done. And Caduceus, who has only ever interacted with The Family He\u2019s Known All His Life and Outsiders/Customers (he didn\u2019t even have a friend like the Traveler) doesn\u2019t yet know how to alter his social scripts to handle these new relationships he is seeing and participating in.</p>",
