One part of me was trapped inside my own body, a prison decorated\nto look like fragile enough to be broken into pieces at the smallest jolt. The\nother part was walking a few steps to the side and watching everything in slow motion.\nDelicate, black and blue lace partly visible under a black silken robe that\nonly covered enough to remind everyone that I wasn\u2019t up for grabs like the\nother girls. I was halfway through the crowded room when I saw a shadow detach\nitself from a corner table in the shadows. <i>The\nboss.</i> There was no easy way to escape him, and so I kept walking instead.\nEach step was in perfect synchronicity to the beat of the music, making my hips\ndip and lift the way the men liked it as I passed them by. <br/></p><!-- more --><p>\u201cGlory.\u201d The part inside me clawed at the\nliving prison at the way his fingers curled around my left wrist and the\nunspoken warning in his feathery voice. \u201cYou look stunning tonight.\u201d</p><p>The detached me reminded me to smile, to\nput on the mask I\u2019d gotten used to wear since I became one of his workers. It\nwas all a part of a creepy, messed up show: the invisible mask, the makeup, the\nlingerie, the boos and drugs and fear that kept us from running when someone\nhurt us, or fucked us, or worse. <i>Hold on,\n</i>my detached mind whispers soothingly, <i>just\na bit longer.</i> </p><p>\u201cOf course, boss, I represent you whenever\nI walk across these floors.\u201d The voice that left my lips was honeyed the way\nwe\u2019ve learned he likes.</p><p>It was too dark to see the colour of his\neyes, but not the sparkle of malice and pride. \u201cGood girl. Make me proud,\nthen.\u201d</p><p>I could feel his fingers sliding over my\nskin and the capped ring that felt foreign and heavy on my hand, but I resumed\nmy parade towards the doors with the intricate pattern painted on in purple,\nred, pink, and gold. Flames and feathers hinting at female figures. I might\nhave found them beautiful in my old life\u2026in this one they made me nauseous. </p><p>But Fabio was right behind me, his presence\nforcing me silently to move on like nothing was wrong, and in a sense, it was a\nrelief to enter the hallway beyond the doors because of the relative silence\nthere. The music reverberated through the wooden floor still, just not enough\nto drown out the muffled sounds from some of the \u201cplay rooms\u201d we were passing\nall the way till the very last at the end. Chernyy won\u2019t be in there yet. The\ncustomer never waits for the ware in this place, ensuring in return that\neverything can be controlled\u2026including the tiny recording devices hidden in\nstrategic places. </p><p>\u2026</p><p>The candles were lit (it was the only \u201cplay\nroom\u201d where we got to use real candles), the champagne was bobbing in the ice\nbucket with the foil and wire off, and the silk sheets were pulled aside on the\nimmense four poster bed. Apart from that, the only other furniture was a chair\nand a low dresser, both made in the same dark and heavy wood. </p><p><i>It\u2019s\ngonna be okay, </i>I kept reminding myself, <i>just breathe! </i>Stopping my pacing across\nthe hard stones of the floor, I closed my eyes and inhaled slowly through my\nnose while counting. After three I began to exhale through my mouth, pushing\nthe spent air out of my lungs for a beat longer. <i>Again.</i> In and out, helping me regain a measure of control over my\nown body. I hadn\u2019t said or done anything that could get me in trouble with the\nboss even if this woman turned out to be nothing but a test of my loyalty, and\nI hadn\u2019t done anything to her, that would get her in trouble\u2026yet. Staring down\nat the ring, it weighed like lead and threatened to pull me to the floor with\nit, it made my hand feel cold. Foreign. Like it wasn\u2019t mine. <i>Maybe, if I pretend to be sick? Then the\nboss won\u2019t let me go through with it \u2018cause it bad for \u2013 </i>The sharp knock on\nthe door interrupted my thoughts, and I barely had time to find a pose with the\ndark silk sliding off my shoulder before the door opened to let in Chernyy. </p><p>She was a vision. The red hair curled\nperfectly to let it bounce at every step she took, framing the angelic face\nwith the intelligent eyes and crooked smile that I\u2019d somehow memorized already.\nShe must have come straight from the street, because she was still wearing a\nlong coat that was wet with rain and tied securely around her waist. Sure, it\nwas buttoned all the way up, and somehow it still didn\u2019t manage to hide the\nshape of her body and, judging by the black leather boots that disappeared up\nunder the coat, neither would whatever she was wearing underneath. </p><p>Tearing my eyes away, I looked to Fabio who\nwas still standing in the door. \u201cThanks, I\u2019ve got it from here.\u201d The man looked\nbummed when he closed the door, but to me it was the first time I felt I could\nbreathe. \u201cChernyy, was it?\u201d <i>Play coy,\neven though we both know the game.</i> Pulling myself up, I gave her time to\nlook me over.</p><p>\u201cFor now.\u201d There were sparkles in the steel\nof her eyes. \u201cStand there for just a bit longer.\u201d</p><p>She began to open the coat while walking to\nthe chair, pulling it off with her back still to me. Not only was she wearing\nleather boots, her entire outfit was a catsuit that hugged her every curve.\nConjuring a phone from somewhere in the tight suit, she tapped efficiently at\nthe screen for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy your boss agreed to let me have\nthis time with you,\u201d her fingertips were still dancing over the smooth screen,\n\u201ceven if it\u2019s just to find out more about me.\u201d I could see the silhouette of\nher cheek rise on a smile. \u201cThere! Shit, I thought Daniel Stein would\u2019ve more\nadvanced tech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just do?\u201d Someone must have\ntaken and dumped me in ice water. </p><p>She was in front of me in two steps,\nholding out her hands for me to take and smiling like an old friend. \u201cIt\u2019s\nokay, [Y/N]. I\u2019ve knocked out the surveillance and they won\u2019t even know for the\nnext 20 minutes because it\u2019s a delayed loop they use. Cheapskates.\u201d </p><p><i>She\nknows my name! </i>Everything felt unreal and it\nwouldn\u2019t have surprised me if I\u2019d woken up in my bed. But I didn\u2019t, and the\nwoman kept talking even though I wasn\u2019t really listening. Her coming here,\ndangling freedom in front of my nose, simply couldn\u2019t be a trick anymore, because\nthe boss wouldn\u2019t have bothered to go that far with it if he suspected anyone\nhad turned against him. This woman was serious. She thought she could get me\nout of the hell hole that was the club. <i>But\nwhy? </i>People didn\u2019t have a habit of showing up unannounced to rescue hookers\nlike me. </p><p>\u201cWho <i>are</i>\nyou?\u201d</p><p>Chernyy\u2019s eyes widened momentarily at my\nquestion before she recomposed herself. Guiding me to sit on the edge of the\nbed, the mysterious woman took my hands in one of hers as she sat down to my\nleft carefully placing the phone on the glistening sheet.</p><p>Her eyes bored into my very soul. \u201cI need\nyou to listen carefully to everything I say, and I need you to trust me if you\nwant to get out of here.\u201d <i>Trust\u2026</i>it\nfelt like a lot, but how could my life get worse than it was? Biting my lip, I\nnod demurely. \u201cGood. My name is not Chernyy, it\u2019s Natasha Romanoff and I\u2019m an\nagent working with the Avengers and formerly SHIELD.\u201d</p><p>These were names I had heard when\npretending to be just a pretty face, so I knew most people in this place would\npay good money to either kill or capture this woman, or agent, and I had heard\nhow the Avengers had saved New York from aliens a year ago. However, other than\nthat there was very little I or the other girls new about the real world out\nthere, because Daniel Stein made sure to keep us in a bubble, cut off from\nreality and laced with fear and guilt and apathy. We didn\u2019t know what to expect\nout there anymore or where to go\u2026and most of us had no one to turn to if we did\nget away.</p><p>\u201c[Y/N].\u201d Chernyy, or rather Natasha,\nsqueezed my hand gently, bring my thoughts back to the moment. \u201cWhat we do, my\nteam and SHIELD, is to keep the world safe and make sure the bad guys are\ncaught before they cause more damage. Terrorists. Some of them are or were\nconnected to an organization called HYDRA, and they have a huge network to\nensure their plans succeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the mafia\u2026\u201d I knew about criminals\nand killers, \u201clike my boss.\u201d</p><p>It made sense. From this place you would\nhave access to everything you\u2019d need to become a real danger to both random\npeople and big organisations or nations, in this world everything was readily\navailable as long as you could pay cash, cash that could also be earned here.</p><p>\u201cLike Daniel Stein, yes. Our intel has\nconfirmed that he\u2019s a cornerstone in HYDRA\u2019s foundations in Euro-Asia. If taken\nout, it\u2019ll take months or maybe even years for them to recover!\u201d</p><p>Dangerous terrorist or not, any of us girls\nwould love to see the boss and his violent goons get their asses kicked\u2026well\nthose of us that were still alive and capable of thinking longer than the next\nscore would. We would have been willing to risk our lives for it. Maybe Natasha\nRomanoff knew that, maybe it was just a lucky guess, but whatever the case she\nbegan explaining what they new of the three buildings that were my boss\u2019s base:\nthe club, his home, and the slum-like building where he kept us. Looking at the\nmaps and blueprints projecting into the air from Natasha\u2019s phone, I could add a\nfew details about doors and tunnels that she and her people didn\u2019t know about. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you need me to do?\u201d I hadn\u2019t\nforgotten what she had said the first time I\u2019d met her, and I was ready to do\nmy part and help even if it scared me. \u201cHow can I\u2026how can I he-elp?\u201d The words\ndidn\u2019t come out strong like I wanted.</p><p>\u201cYou already have.\u201d A crooked smile slid\nover her face as she studied me. \u201cToday and twice before.\u201d</p><p>Careful to keep strange spy-expression out\nof it, the woman explains briefly about what she had done the other times we\u2019ve\nmet, like the very first time, where she\u2019d placed a tracker on my back to help\nthem get a feeling for the extent of the domicile. It had been nothing but a\ntiny sticker, capable of adapting to almost any skin colour but its primary\npurpose was to send a signal to their gear, showing where I was. Maybe I should\nhave been pissed off by that. She had used me without waiting for my consent\u2026<i>and so what? </i>That was my life. At least it\nhad been for something I would have accepted if she\u2019d given me the chance and\nnot knowing had ensured I hadn\u2019t had to lie about that too. Then there had been\nthe napkin. It had surprised me a tiny bit that there hadn\u2019t been some secret\nmessage on it, but my logic took over, telling me that the risk would have been\ntoo great, and I dismissed the idea.</p><p>\u201cIt registered handprints?!\u201d <i>Yeah, right!</i> I knew the Avengers had to\nbe pretty high-tech but that was just ridiculous.</p><p>The smirk was audible, proving how smug she\nfelt about her job and the gear they had. \u201cYeah, we almost lost it when you\nwalked away with it though\u2026thankfully, we have a couple of contacts.\u201d</p><p>Curiosity and hope was flickering like a\ntiny flame in my chest and I instinctively hid it by looking at our entwined\nfingers in my lap. Maybe these other people could help me and the other girls.\nMaybe, just maybe, they would testify against my boss and put an end to his so-called\nbusiness run on slavery and violence. But if that was the case\u2026then why had\nthey never tried to help us already? No, none of the people at the other side\nof the painted double doors were our allies, and why would she, a supposedly\nprofessional agent and hero, tell me these things? She knew my name, but she\ndidn\u2019t know me, and she was running a huge risk, counting on me not to go back and\nsave my hide by telling Daniel Stein everything\u2026and even if I didn\u2019t want to,\nhe had ways of making people talk.

The\nother part was walking a few steps to the side and watching everything in slow motion.\nDelicate, black and blue lace partly visible under a black silken robe that\nonly covered enough to remind everyone that I wasn\u2019t up for grabs like the\nother girls. I was halfway through the crowded room when I saw a shadow detach\nitself from a corner table in the shadows. <i>The\nboss.</i> There was no easy way to escape him, and so I kept walking instead.\nEach step was in perfect synchronicity to the beat of the music, making my hips\ndip and lift the way the men liked it as I passed them by. <br></p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cGlory.\u201d The part inside me clawed at the\nliving prison at the way his fingers curled around my left wrist and the\nunspoken warning in his feathery voice. \u201cYou look stunning tonight.\u201d</p><p>The detached me reminded me to smile, to\nput on the mask I\u2019d gotten used to wear since I became one of his workers. It\nwas all a part of a creepy, messed up show: the invisible mask, the makeup, the\nlingerie, the boos and drugs and fear that kept us from running when someone\nhurt us, or fucked us, or worse. <i>Hold on,\n</i>my detached mind whispers soothingly, <i>just\na bit longer.</i> </p><p>\u201cOf course, boss, I represent you whenever\nI walk across these floors.\u201d The voice that left my lips was honeyed the way\nwe\u2019ve learned he likes.</p><p>It was too dark to see the colour of his\neyes, but not the sparkle of malice and pride. \u201cGood girl. Make me proud,\nthen.\u201d</p><p>I could feel his fingers sliding over my\nskin and the capped ring that felt foreign and heavy on my hand, but I resumed\nmy parade towards the doors with the intricate pattern painted on in purple,\nred, pink, and gold. Flames and feathers hinting at female figures. I might\nhave found them beautiful in my old life\u2026in this one they made me nauseous. </p><p>But Fabio was right behind me, his presence\nforcing me silently to move on like nothing was wrong, and in a sense, it was a\nrelief to enter the hallway beyond the doors because of the relative silence\nthere. The music reverberated through the wooden floor still, just not enough\nto drown out the muffled sounds from some of the \u201cplay rooms\u201d we were passing\nall the way till the very last at the end. Chernyy won\u2019t be in there yet. The\ncustomer never waits for the ware in this place, ensuring in return that\neverything can be controlled\u2026including the tiny recording devices hidden in\nstrategic places. </p><p>\u2026</p><p>The candles were lit (it was the only \u201cplay\nroom\u201d where we got to use real candles), the champagne was bobbing in the ice\nbucket with the foil and wire off, and the silk sheets were pulled aside on the\nimmense four poster bed. Apart from that, the only other furniture was a chair\nand a low dresser, both made in the same dark and heavy wood. </p><p><i>It\u2019s\ngonna be okay, </i>I kept reminding myself, <i>just breathe! </i>Stopping my pacing across\nthe hard stones of the floor, I closed my eyes and inhaled slowly through my\nnose while counting. After three I began to exhale through my mouth, pushing\nthe spent air out of my lungs for a beat longer. <i>Again.</i> In and out, helping me regain a measure of control over my\nown body. I hadn\u2019t said or done anything that could get me in trouble with the\nboss even if this woman turned out to be nothing but a test of my loyalty, and\nI hadn\u2019t done anything to her, that would get her in trouble\u2026yet. Staring down\nat the ring, it weighed like lead and threatened to pull me to the floor with\nit, it made my hand feel cold. Foreign. Like it wasn\u2019t mine. <i>Maybe, if I pretend to be sick? Then the\nboss won\u2019t let me go through with it \u2018cause it bad for \u2013 </i>The sharp knock on\nthe door interrupted my thoughts, and I barely had time to find a pose with the\ndark silk sliding off my shoulder before the door opened to let in Chernyy. </p><p>She was a vision. The red hair curled\nperfectly to let it bounce at every step she took, framing the angelic face\nwith the intelligent eyes and crooked smile that I\u2019d somehow memorized already.\nShe must have come straight from the street, because she was still wearing a\nlong coat that was wet with rain and tied securely around her waist. Sure, it\nwas buttoned all the way up, and somehow it still didn\u2019t manage to hide the\nshape of her body and, judging by the black leather boots that disappeared up\nunder the coat, neither would whatever she was wearing underneath. </p><p>Tearing my eyes away, I looked to Fabio who\nwas still standing in the door. \u201cThanks, I\u2019ve got it from here.\u201d The man looked\nbummed when he closed the door, but to me it was the first time I felt I could\nbreathe. \u201cChernyy, was it?\u201d <i>Play coy,\neven though we both know the game.</i> Pulling myself up, I gave her time to\nlook me over.</p><p>\u201cFor now.\u201d There were sparkles in the steel\nof her eyes. \u201cStand there for just a bit longer.\u201d</p><p>She began to open the coat while walking to\nthe chair, pulling it off with her back still to me. Not only was she wearing\nleather boots, her entire outfit was a catsuit that hugged her every curve.\nConjuring a phone from somewhere in the tight suit, she tapped efficiently at\nthe screen for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy your boss agreed to let me have\nthis time with you,\u201d her fingertips were still dancing over the smooth screen,\n\u201ceven if it\u2019s just to find out more about me.\u201d I could see the silhouette of\nher cheek rise on a smile. \u201cThere! Shit, I thought Daniel Stein would\u2019ve more\nadvanced tech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just do?\u201d Someone must have\ntaken and dumped me in ice water. </p><p>She was in front of me in two steps,\nholding out her hands for me to take and smiling like an old friend. \u201cIt\u2019s\nokay, [Y/N]. I\u2019ve knocked out the surveillance and they won\u2019t even know for the\nnext 20 minutes because it\u2019s a delayed loop they use. Cheapskates.\u201d </p><p><i>She\nknows my name! </i>Everything felt unreal and it\nwouldn\u2019t have surprised me if I\u2019d woken up in my bed. But I didn\u2019t, and the\nwoman kept talking even though I wasn\u2019t really listening. Her coming here,\ndangling freedom in front of my nose, simply couldn\u2019t be a trick anymore, because\nthe boss wouldn\u2019t have bothered to go that far with it if he suspected anyone\nhad turned against him. This woman was serious. She thought she could get me\nout of the hell hole that was the club. <i>But\nwhy? </i>People didn\u2019t have a habit of showing up unannounced to rescue hookers\nlike me. </p><p>\u201cWho <i>are</i>\nyou?\u201d</p><p>Chernyy\u2019s eyes widened momentarily at my\nquestion before she recomposed herself. Guiding me to sit on the edge of the\nbed, the mysterious woman took my hands in one of hers as she sat down to my\nleft carefully placing the phone on the glistening sheet.</p><p>Her eyes bored into my very soul. \u201cI need\nyou to listen carefully to everything I say, and I need you to trust me if you\nwant to get out of here.\u201d <i>Trust\u2026</i>it\nfelt like a lot, but how could my life get worse than it was? Biting my lip, I\nnod demurely. \u201cGood. My name is not Chernyy, it\u2019s Natasha Romanoff and I\u2019m an\nagent working with the Avengers and formerly SHIELD.\u201d</p><p>These were names I had heard when\npretending to be just a pretty face, so I knew most people in this place would\npay good money to either kill or capture this woman, or agent, and I had heard\nhow the Avengers had saved New York from aliens a year ago. However, other than\nthat there was very little I or the other girls new about the real world out\nthere, because Daniel Stein made sure to keep us in a bubble, cut off from\nreality and laced with fear and guilt and apathy. We didn\u2019t know what to expect\nout there anymore or where to go\u2026and most of us had no one to turn to if we did\nget away.</p><p>\u201c[Y/N].\u201d Chernyy, or rather Natasha,\nsqueezed my hand gently, bring my thoughts back to the moment. \u201cWhat we do, my\nteam and SHIELD, is to keep the world safe and make sure the bad guys are\ncaught before they cause more damage. Terrorists. Some of them are or were\nconnected to an organization called HYDRA, and they have a huge network to\nensure their plans succeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the mafia\u2026\u201d I knew about criminals\nand killers, \u201clike my boss.\u201d</p><p>It made sense. From this place you would\nhave access to everything you\u2019d need to become a real danger to both random\npeople and big organisations or nations, in this world everything was readily\navailable as long as you could pay cash, cash that could also be earned here.</p><p>\u201cLike Daniel Stein, yes. Our intel has\nconfirmed that he\u2019s a cornerstone in HYDRA\u2019s foundations in Euro-Asia. If taken\nout, it\u2019ll take months or maybe even years for them to recover!\u201d</p><p>Dangerous terrorist or not, any of us girls\nwould love to see the boss and his violent goons get their asses kicked\u2026well\nthose of us that were still alive and capable of thinking longer than the next\nscore would. We would have been willing to risk our lives for it. Maybe Natasha\nRomanoff knew that, maybe it was just a lucky guess, but whatever the case she\nbegan explaining what they new of the three buildings that were my boss\u2019s base:\nthe club, his home, and the slum-like building where he kept us. Looking at the\nmaps and blueprints projecting into the air from Natasha\u2019s phone, I could add a\nfew details about doors and tunnels that she and her people didn\u2019t know about. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you need me to do?\u201d I hadn\u2019t\nforgotten what she had said the first time I\u2019d met her, and I was ready to do\nmy part and help even if it scared me. \u201cHow can I\u2026how can I he-elp?\u201d The words\ndidn\u2019t come out strong like I wanted.</p><p>\u201cYou already have.\u201d A crooked smile slid\nover her face as she studied me. \u201cToday and twice before.\u201d</p><p>Careful to keep strange spy-expression out\nof it, the woman explains briefly about what she had done the other times we\u2019ve\nmet, like the very first time, where she\u2019d placed a tracker on my back to help\nthem get a feeling for the extent of the domicile. It had been nothing but a\ntiny sticker, capable of adapting to almost any skin colour but its primary\npurpose was to send a signal to their gear, showing where I was. Maybe I should\nhave been pissed off by that. She had used me without waiting for my consent\u2026<i>and so what? </i>That was my life. At least it\nhad been for something I would have accepted if she\u2019d given me the chance and\nnot knowing had ensured I hadn\u2019t had to lie about that too. Then there had been\nthe napkin. It had surprised me a tiny bit that there hadn\u2019t been some secret\nmessage on it, but my logic took over, telling me that the risk would have been\ntoo great, and I dismissed the idea.</p><p>\u201cIt registered handprints?!\u201d <i>Yeah, right!</i> I knew the Avengers had to\nbe pretty high-tech but that was just ridiculous.</p><p>The smirk was audible, proving how smug she\nfelt about her job and the gear they had. \u201cYeah, we almost lost it when you\nwalked away with it though\u2026thankfully, we have a couple of contacts.\u201d</p><p>Curiosity and hope was flickering like a\ntiny flame in my chest and I instinctively hid it by looking at our entwined\nfingers in my lap. Maybe these other people could help me and the other girls.\nMaybe, just maybe, they would testify against my boss and put an end to his so-called\nbusiness run on slavery and violence. But if that was the case\u2026then why had\nthey never tried to help us already? No, none of the people at the other side\nof the painted double doors were our allies, and why would she, a supposedly\nprofessional agent and hero, tell me these things? She knew my name, but she\ndidn\u2019t know me, and she was running a huge risk, counting on me not to go back and\nsave my hide by telling Daniel Stein everything\u2026and even if I didn\u2019t want to,\nhe had ways of making people talk. Natasha couldn\u2019t be sure I wouldn\u2019t rat on\nher. <i>Yes, she can.</i> Suddenly her\nfingers around mine felt like cuffs, her arms like chains. Her touch might have\nbeen light, but I knew all to well that that could change in an instance and I\nwould be gripped in inescapable iron claws at the mercy of the other person. In\nmy past, it had been men who would flip on me and the girls at the smallest\nimagined slight, and I\u2019d suffered their wrath for weeks after, hiding the marks\nunder thick layers of makeup\u2026and I\u2019d been grateful. They hadn\u2019t killed me. They\nhad let me live to beat me or rape me some other time. Glancing at the metallic\nblue eyes before me, a chill ran down my spine and spread as paralyzing\ngoosebumps as I realized she wouldn\u2019t just break me and leave me. <i>She\u2019ll kill me to prevent me from talking.</i>\nShifting awkwardly on the edge of the bed, I ran my chances of using the ring\non her through my head. The odds of getting to Fabio before she got me were considered\nin less than a heartbeat.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d she said, voice\nladen with the same kindness as the first time I\u2019d met her, \u201cbut I won\u2019t hurt\nyou. I\u2019m taking you away from this place.\u201d Somehow, I managed to stay\nstock-still as she cupped my cheek. \u201cTonight.\u201d\n\n\n\n</p>",

One part of me was trapped inside my own body, a prison decorated\nto look like fragile enough to be broken into pieces at the smallest jolt. The\nother part was walking a few steps to the side and watching everything in slow motion.\nDelicate, black and blue lace partly visible under a black silken robe that\nonly covered enough to remind everyone that I wasn\u2019t up for grabs like the\nother girls. I was halfway through the crowded room when I saw a shadow detach\nitself from a corner table in the shadows. <i>The\nboss.</i> There was no easy way to escape him, and so I kept walking instead.\nEach step was in perfect synchronicity to the beat of the music, making my hips\ndip and lift the way the men liked it as I passed them by. <br></p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cGlory.\u201d The part inside me clawed at the\nliving prison at the way his fingers curled around my left wrist and the\nunspoken warning in his feathery voice. \u201cYou look stunning tonight.\u201d</p><p>The detached me reminded me to smile, to\nput on the mask I\u2019d gotten used to wear since I became one of his workers. It\nwas all a part of a creepy, messed up show: the invisible mask, the makeup, the\nlingerie, the boos and drugs and fear that kept us from running when someone\nhurt us, or fucked us, or worse. <i>Hold on,\n</i>my detached mind whispers soothingly, <i>just\na bit longer.</i> </p><p>\u201cOf course, boss, I represent you whenever\nI walk across these floors.\u201d The voice that left my lips was honeyed the way\nwe\u2019ve learned he likes.</p><p>It was too dark to see the colour of his\neyes, but not the sparkle of malice and pride. \u201cGood girl. Make me proud,\nthen.\u201d</p><p>I could feel his fingers sliding over my\nskin and the capped ring that felt foreign and heavy on my hand, but I resumed\nmy parade towards the doors with the intricate pattern painted on in purple,\nred, pink, and gold. Flames and feathers hinting at female figures. I might\nhave found them beautiful in my old life\u2026in this one they made me nauseous. </p><p>But Fabio was right behind me, his presence\nforcing me silently to move on like nothing was wrong, and in a sense, it was a\nrelief to enter the hallway beyond the doors because of the relative silence\nthere. The music reverberated through the wooden floor still, just not enough\nto drown out the muffled sounds from some of the \u201cplay rooms\u201d we were passing\nall the way till the very last at the end. Chernyy won\u2019t be in there yet. The\ncustomer never waits for the ware in this place, ensuring in return that\neverything can be controlled\u2026including the tiny recording devices hidden in\nstrategic places. </p><p>\u2026</p><p>The candles were lit (it was the only \u201cplay\nroom\u201d where we got to use real candles), the champagne was bobbing in the ice\nbucket with the foil and wire off, and the silk sheets were pulled aside on the\nimmense four poster bed. Apart from that, the only other furniture was a chair\nand a low dresser, both made in the same dark and heavy wood. </p><p><i>It\u2019s\ngonna be okay, </i>I kept reminding myself, <i>just breathe! </i>Stopping my pacing across\nthe hard stones of the floor, I closed my eyes and inhaled slowly through my\nnose while counting. After three I began to exhale through my mouth, pushing\nthe spent air out of my lungs for a beat longer. <i>Again.</i> In and out, helping me regain a measure of control over my\nown body. I hadn\u2019t said or done anything that could get me in trouble with the\nboss even if this woman turned out to be nothing but a test of my loyalty, and\nI hadn\u2019t done anything to her, that would get her in trouble\u2026yet. Staring down\nat the ring, it weighed like lead and threatened to pull me to the floor with\nit, it made my hand feel cold. Foreign. Like it wasn\u2019t mine. <i>Maybe, if I pretend to be sick? Then the\nboss won\u2019t let me go through with it \u2018cause it bad for \u2013 </i>The sharp knock on\nthe door interrupted my thoughts, and I barely had time to find a pose with the\ndark silk sliding off my shoulder before the door opened to let in Chernyy. </p><p>She was a vision. The red hair curled\nperfectly to let it bounce at every step she took, framing the angelic face\nwith the intelligent eyes and crooked smile that I\u2019d somehow memorized already.\nShe must have come straight from the street, because she was still wearing a\nlong coat that was wet with rain and tied securely around her waist. Sure, it\nwas buttoned all the way up, and somehow it still didn\u2019t manage to hide the\nshape of her body and, judging by the black leather boots that disappeared up\nunder the coat, neither would whatever she was wearing underneath. </p><p>Tearing my eyes away, I looked to Fabio who\nwas still standing in the door. \u201cThanks, I\u2019ve got it from here.\u201d The man looked\nbummed when he closed the door, but to me it was the first time I felt I could\nbreathe. \u201cChernyy, was it?\u201d <i>Play coy,\neven though we both know the game.</i> Pulling myself up, I gave her time to\nlook me over.</p><p>\u201cFor now.\u201d There were sparkles in the steel\nof her eyes. \u201cStand there for just a bit longer.\u201d</p><p>She began to open the coat while walking to\nthe chair, pulling it off with her back still to me. Not only was she wearing\nleather boots, her entire outfit was a catsuit that hugged her every curve.\nConjuring a phone from somewhere in the tight suit, she tapped efficiently at\nthe screen for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy your boss agreed to let me have\nthis time with you,\u201d her fingertips were still dancing over the smooth screen,\n\u201ceven if it\u2019s just to find out more about me.\u201d I could see the silhouette of\nher cheek rise on a smile. \u201cThere! Shit, I thought Daniel Stein would\u2019ve more\nadvanced tech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just do?\u201d Someone must have\ntaken and dumped me in ice water. </p><p>She was in front of me in two steps,\nholding out her hands for me to take and smiling like an old friend. \u201cIt\u2019s\nokay, [Y/N]. I\u2019ve knocked out the surveillance and they won\u2019t even know for the\nnext 20 minutes because it\u2019s a delayed loop they use. Cheapskates.\u201d </p><p><i>She\nknows my name! </i>Everything felt unreal and it\nwouldn\u2019t have surprised me if I\u2019d woken up in my bed. But I didn\u2019t, and the\nwoman kept talking even though I wasn\u2019t really listening. Her coming here,\ndangling freedom in front of my nose, simply couldn\u2019t be a trick anymore, because\nthe boss wouldn\u2019t have bothered to go that far with it if he suspected anyone\nhad turned against him. This woman was serious. She thought she could get me\nout of the hell hole that was the club. <i>But\nwhy? </i>People didn\u2019t have a habit of showing up unannounced to rescue hookers\nlike me. </p><p>\u201cWho <i>are</i>\nyou?\u201d</p><p>Chernyy\u2019s eyes widened momentarily at my\nquestion before she recomposed herself. Guiding me to sit on the edge of the\nbed, the mysterious woman took my hands in one of hers as she sat down to my\nleft carefully placing the phone on the glistening sheet.</p><p>Her eyes bored into my very soul. \u201cI need\nyou to listen carefully to everything I say, and I need you to trust me if you\nwant to get out of here.\u201d <i>Trust\u2026</i>it\nfelt like a lot, but how could my life get worse than it was? Biting my lip, I\nnod demurely. \u201cGood. My name is not Chernyy, it\u2019s Natasha Romanoff and I\u2019m an\nagent working with the Avengers and formerly SHIELD.\u201d</p><p>These were names I had heard when\npretending to be just a pretty face, so I knew most people in this place would\npay good money to either kill or capture this woman, or agent, and I had heard\nhow the Avengers had saved New York from aliens a year ago. However, other than\nthat there was very little I or the other girls new about the real world out\nthere, because Daniel Stein made sure to keep us in a bubble, cut off from\nreality and laced with fear and guilt and apathy. We didn\u2019t know what to expect\nout there anymore or where to go\u2026and most of us had no one to turn to if we did\nget away.</p><p>\u201c[Y/N].\u201d Chernyy, or rather Natasha,\nsqueezed my hand gently, bring my thoughts back to the moment. \u201cWhat we do, my\nteam and SHIELD, is to keep the world safe and make sure the bad guys are\ncaught before they cause more damage. Terrorists. Some of them are or were\nconnected to an organization called HYDRA, and they have a huge network to\nensure their plans succeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the mafia\u2026\u201d I knew about criminals\nand killers, \u201clike my boss.\u201d</p><p>It made sense. From this place you would\nhave access to everything you\u2019d need to become a real danger to both random\npeople and big organisations or nations, in this world everything was readily\navailable as long as you could pay cash, cash that could also be earned here.</p><p>\u201cLike Daniel Stein, yes. Our intel has\nconfirmed that he\u2019s a cornerstone in HYDRA\u2019s foundations in Euro-Asia. If taken\nout, it\u2019ll take months or maybe even years for them to recover!\u201d</p><p>Dangerous terrorist or not, any of us girls\nwould love to see the boss and his violent goons get their asses kicked\u2026well\nthose of us that were still alive and capable of thinking longer than the next\nscore would. We would have been willing to risk our lives for it. Maybe Natasha\nRomanoff knew that, maybe it was just a lucky guess, but whatever the case she\nbegan explaining what they new of the three buildings that were my boss\u2019s base:\nthe club, his home, and the slum-like building where he kept us. Looking at the\nmaps and blueprints projecting into the air from Natasha\u2019s phone, I could add a\nfew details about doors and tunnels that she and her people didn\u2019t know about. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you need me to do?\u201d I hadn\u2019t\nforgotten what she had said the first time I\u2019d met her, and I was ready to do\nmy part and help even if it scared me. \u201cHow can I\u2026how can I he-elp?\u201d The words\ndidn\u2019t come out strong like I wanted.</p><p>\u201cYou already have.\u201d A crooked smile slid\nover her face as she studied me. \u201cToday and twice before.\u201d</p><p>Careful to keep strange spy-expression out\nof it, the woman explains briefly about what she had done the other times we\u2019ve\nmet, like the very first time, where she\u2019d placed a tracker on my back to help\nthem get a feeling for the extent of the domicile. It had been nothing but a\ntiny sticker, capable of adapting to almost any skin colour but its primary\npurpose was to send a signal to their gear, showing where I was. Maybe I should\nhave been pissed off by that. She had used me without waiting for my consent\u2026<i>and so what? </i>That was my life. At least it\nhad been for something I would have accepted if she\u2019d given me the chance and\nnot knowing had ensured I hadn\u2019t had to lie about that too. Then there had been\nthe napkin. It had surprised me a tiny bit that there hadn\u2019t been some secret\nmessage on it, but my logic took over, telling me that the risk would have been\ntoo great, and I dismissed the idea.</p><p>\u201cIt registered handprints?!\u201d <i>Yeah, right!</i> I knew the Avengers had to\nbe pretty high-tech but that was just ridiculous.</p><p>The smirk was audible, proving how smug she\nfelt about her job and the gear they had. \u201cYeah, we almost lost it when you\nwalked away with it though\u2026thankfully, we have a couple of contacts.\u201d</p><p>Curiosity and hope was flickering like a\ntiny flame in my chest and I instinctively hid it by looking at our entwined\nfingers in my lap. Maybe these other people could help me and the other girls.\nMaybe, just maybe, they would testify against my boss and put an end to his so-called\nbusiness run on slavery and violence. But if that was the case\u2026then why had\nthey never tried to help us already? No, none of the people at the other side\nof the painted double doors were our allies, and why would she, a supposedly\nprofessional agent and hero, tell me these things? She knew my name, but she\ndidn\u2019t know me, and she was running a huge risk, counting on me not to go back and\nsave my hide by telling Daniel Stein everything\u2026and even if I didn\u2019t want to,\nhe had ways of making people talk. Natasha couldn\u2019t be sure I wouldn\u2019t rat on\nher. <i>Yes, she can.</i> Suddenly her\nfingers around mine felt like cuffs, her arms like chains. Her touch might have\nbeen light, but I knew all to well that that could change in an instance and I\nwould be gripped in inescapable iron claws at the mercy of the other person. In\nmy past, it had been men who would flip on me and the girls at the smallest\nimagined slight, and I\u2019d suffered their wrath for weeks after, hiding the marks\nunder thick layers of makeup\u2026and I\u2019d been grateful. They hadn\u2019t killed me. They\nhad let me live to beat me or rape me some other time. Glancing at the metallic\nblue eyes before me, a chill ran down my spine and spread as paralyzing\ngoosebumps as I realized she wouldn\u2019t just break me and leave me. <i>She\u2019ll kill me to prevent me from talking.</i>\nShifting awkwardly on the edge of the bed, I ran my chances of using the ring\non her through my head. The odds of getting to Fabio before she got me were considered\nin less than a heartbeat.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d she said, voice\nladen with the same kindness as the first time I\u2019d met her, \u201cbut I won\u2019t hurt\nyou. I\u2019m taking you away from this place.\u201d Somehow, I managed to stay\nstock-still as she cupped my cheek. \u201cTonight.\u201d\n\n\n\n</p>",

Maybe Natasha\nRomanoff knew that, maybe it was just a lucky guess, but whatever the case she\nbegan explaining what they new of the three buildings that were my boss&rsquo;s base:\nthe club, his home, and the slum-like building where he kept us. Looking at the\nmaps and blueprints projecting into the air from Natasha&rsquo;s phone, I could add a\nfew details about doors and tunnels that she and her people didn&rsquo;t know about. </p><p>&ldquo;What do you need me to do?&rdquo; I hadn&rsquo;t\nforgotten what she had said the first time I&rsquo;d met her, and I was ready to do\nmy part and help even if it scared me. &ldquo;How can I&hellip;how can I he-elp?&rdquo; The words\ndidn&rsquo;t come out strong like I wanted.</p><p>&ldquo;You already have.&rdquo; A crooked smile slid\nover her face as she studied me. &ldquo;Today and twice before.&rdquo;</p><p>Careful to keep strange spy-expression out\nof it, the woman explains briefly about what she had done the other times we&rsquo;ve\nmet, like the very first time, where she&rsquo;d placed a tracker on my back to help\nthem get a feeling for the extent of the domicile. It had been nothing but a\ntiny sticker, capable of adapting to almost any skin colour but its primary\npurpose was to send a signal to their gear, showing where I was. Maybe I should\nhave been pissed off by that. She had used me without waiting for my consent&hellip;<i>and so what? </i>That was my life. At least it\nhad been for something I would have accepted if she&rsquo;d given me the chance and\nnot knowing had ensured I hadn&rsquo;t had to lie about that too. Then there had been\nthe napkin. It had surprised me a tiny bit that there hadn&rsquo;t been some secret\nmessage on it, but my logic took over, telling me that the risk would have been\ntoo great, and I dismissed the idea.</p><p>&ldquo;It registered handprints?!&rdquo; <i>Yeah, right!</i> I knew the Avengers had to\nbe pretty high-tech but that was just ridiculous.</p><p>The smirk was audible, proving how smug she\nfelt about her job and the gear they had. &ldquo;Yeah, we almost lost it when you\nwalked away with it though&hellip;thankfully, we have a couple of contacts.&rdquo;</p><p>Curiosity and hope was flickering like a\ntiny flame in my chest and I instinctively hid it by looking at our entwined\nfingers in my lap. Maybe these other people could help me and the other girls.\nMaybe, just maybe, they would testify against my boss and put an end to his so-called\nbusiness run on slavery and violence. But if that was the case&hellip;then why had\nthey never tried to help us already? No, none of the people at the other side\nof the painted double doors were our allies, and why would she, a supposedly\nprofessional agent and hero, tell me these things? She knew my name, but she\ndidn&rsquo;t know me, and she was running a huge risk, counting on me not to go back and\nsave my hide by telling Daniel Stein everything&hellip;and even if I didn&rsquo;t want to,\nhe had ways of making people talk. Natasha couldn&rsquo;t be sure I wouldn&rsquo;t rat on\nher. <i>Yes, she can.</i> Suddenly her\nfingers around mine felt like cuffs, her arms like chains. Her touch might have\nbeen light, but I knew all to well that that could change in an instance and I\nwould be gripped in inescapable iron claws at the mercy of the other person. In\nmy past, it had been men who would flip on me and the girls at the smallest\nimagined slight, and I&rsquo;d suffered their wrath for weeks after, hiding the marks\nunder thick layers of makeup&hellip;and I&rsquo;d been grateful. They hadn&rsquo;t killed me. They\nhad let me live to beat me or rape me some other time. Glancing at the metallic\nblue eyes before me, a chill ran down my spine and spread as paralyzing\ngoosebumps as I realized she wouldn&rsquo;t just break me and leave me. <i>She&rsquo;ll kill me to prevent me from talking.</i>\nShifting awkwardly on the edge of the bed, I ran my chances of using the ring\non her through my head. The odds of getting to Fabio before she got me were considered\nin less than a heartbeat.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re thinking,&rdquo; she said, voice\nladen with the same kindness as the first time I&rsquo;d met her, &ldquo;but I won&rsquo;t hurt\nyou. I&rsquo;m taking you away from this place.&rdquo; Somehow, I managed to stay\nstock-still as she cupped my cheek. &ldquo;Tonight.&rdquo;\n\n\n\n</p>",

One part of me was trapped inside my own body, a prison decorated\nto look like fragile enough to be broken into pieces at the smallest jolt. The\nother part was walking a few steps to the side and watching everything in slow motion.\nDelicate, black and blue lace partly visible under a black silken robe that\nonly covered enough to remind everyone that I wasn&rsquo;t up for grabs like the\nother girls. I was halfway through the crowded room when I saw a shadow detach\nitself from a corner table in the shadows. <i>The\nboss.</i> There was no easy way to escape him, and so I kept walking instead.\nEach step was in perfect synchronicity to the beat of the music, making my hips\ndip and lift the way the men liked it as I passed them by. <br /></p>\n</p>",
