He could\u2019ve disappeared somewhere while James wasn\u2019t paying attention, and JARVIS hadn\u2019t said anything, so he\u2019s not too concerned.</p><p>The elevator dings, and James turns towards it as the Avengers step through, expressions of varying intensities of irritation all crossing their faces. Did something happen\u2026?</p><p>\u201cRhodes!\u201d calls Barton, irritation in his tone.\u00a0\u201cMan, have you seen Tony around? He missed a meeting today. Jeez, he can\u2019t get away with everything just because he\u2019s rich.\u201d<br/></p><p>There\u2019s a sinking feeling in James\u2019s stomach.\u00a0\u201cI saw him earlier, but\u2026\u201d He breaks off to curse.\u00a0\u201cFuck! That idiot!\u201d It isn\u2019t like Tony to skip out on meetings without rubbing it in everyone\u2019s faces.\u00a0\u201cHe wasn\u2019t looking too great earlier.\u201d</p><p>James immediately heads towards the elevator, urgency in every action.\u00a0\u201cGod, that dumbass,\u201d he mutters, pushing past Barton. Knowing him, he\u2019d muted JARVIS as soon as the AI was going to talk to someone about his condition.</p><p>\u201cWait, he was sick?\u201d There\u2019s a touch of guilt amidst the concern in Rogers\u2019s voice.\u00a0\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he call in?\u201d<br/></p><p>As the Avengers who\u2019d come in crowd into the elevator again, James gives the supersoldier his most unimpressed eyebrow raise.\u00a0\u201cHave you <i>met</i>\u00a0the man?\u201d he asks, and Rogers sighs.</p><p>\u201cStupid question, I know.\u201d<br/></p><p>The elevator dings again and the doors open. James practically races into the workshop, and his heart nearly stops when he sees his best friend collapsed halfway onto the couch; he hadn\u2019t had the energy to even get onto it, evidently.</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d he calls urgently, bending down and dragging him fully onto the couch. He can practically feel the heat radiating off of him, and his heart gives another painful stop.<br/></p><p>Thankfully, Tony stirs, eyes fluttering open tiredly to meet James\u2019s gaze.\u00a0\u201cRh\u2019dey?\u201d he slurs tiredly.\u00a0\u201cWh\u2019re you doing here?\u201d Behind him, James can hear the rest of the Avengers crowding around the couch.\u00a0\u201c\u2026Barton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of us are here,\u201d says Romanoff, voice quiet and pitched soothingly low.\u00a0\u201cThor went off with Bruce, though we\u2019ll call them back if we need to.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cMm,\u201d is all Tony says, voice thick with sleep, exhaustion, and fever. Rogers, bless him, heads over with a glass of water and a wet towel, handing them wordlessly to James.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Tony, drink a little water.\u201d James helps Tony sit up, holding the glass of water to his lips. Tony makes a low noise of protest but with a little more cajoling, he drinks about half of the glass before James sets it on the table.</p><p>\u201cJARVIS, unmute,\u201d James calls.<br/></p><p>The AI gives a disgruntled,\u00a0\u201cThank you, Colonel Rhodes. Sir\u2019s temperature is 102.3, and has been unconscious over the couch for approximately two hours. His temperature has only risen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, take better care of yourself,\u201d Barton grumbles as James sets Tony back down on the couch gently. The archer hands James a pillow he\u2019d snagged from a nearby bench, and he shoves it under Tony\u2019s head before draping the towel over his forehead.<br/></p><p>\u201cAsking the impossible here, Barton,\u201d Romanoff replies dryly, but not without a touch of fondness and exasperation as takes a seat by Tony\u2019s head, carefully carding a hand through his hair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou guys are\u2026\u201d Tony yawns, and James smiles fondly.\u00a0\u201cMean\u2026\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOnly\u00a0\u2018cause we care about you, idiot,\u201d James sighs.\u00a0\u201cGet well soon, Tony.\u201d<br/></p>",
