According to the UPS tracking page based on the link Taylor Nation sent mr it was attempted to be delivered on the week of the 17th December but nothing came. It&rsquo;s been several weeks and it still hasn&rsquo;t come and now I find out it&rsquo;s being sent back to Nashville which makes me really upset and frustrated. I keep getting the same message that my local post office service handles it but I have been told by them that UPS would handle the package which doesn&rsquo;t really help the situation. This merch with exchange rates costs fair amount of money and to have this end result is not great and really makes this a bad customer service experience. I would really like to be contacted by someone as I have sent countless emails to TSMerch customer service and have called countless of times to the Nashville Office and have left several messages but no one has responded to my calls or emails. </p><p>So that is why I&rsquo;m reaching out to you because I need your help so I can get my merch so I can wear my jacket and continuously play your music non stop.</p><p>Kind Regards</p><p>Anthony Farah</p>",

I didn&rsquo;t even know myself that I&rsquo;m going to pass this.</p><p>Then I saw this speech that Taylor told in one of Rep Tour. She said &ldquo; if someone was name calling to bully on social media, and even a lot of people jump onboard with it, that doesn&rsquo;t have to defeat you.&rdquo;</p><p>Taylor said,&ldquo;you shouldn&rsquo;t care so much if you feel misunderstood by a lot of people who doesn&rsquo;t know you as long as you feel understood by the people who do know you- the people who see you as a human being&rdquo;</p><p>Taylor&rsquo;s speech was too much inspiration for me and  my real bestfriends are coming to me and saying that &ldquo;No matter what happens, we believe you. We are with you and we love you&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s feel like the last straw of my life.

This is not as common a reaction for me to Taylor songs as you might think; it\u2019s actually only happened a handful of times. I didn\u2019t cry right at the beginning of the song either. At first I was only holding my breath trying to process all of it and take it all in as best I could. The moment that made me cry was: <i>they fade to nothing when I look at him.</i></p><p>Part of being a Taylor fan is caring about her personal life, and sure, it\u2019s filtered in her art. It\u2019s important to remember that it isn\u2019t 100% autobiographical, that the Taylor we know is probably not exactly the same as the actual girl/woman, but still. Taylor has been telling us how she\u2019s doing for years now. Approximately every two years, very nearly like clockwork, she appears to tell us about the past two years of her life. There\u2019s a theme, an aesthetic, a whole to-do. Most importantly there\u2019s her words and the state of her heart- a fairly faithful transcription of everything big that\u2019s happened to her. She lets us in on what she\u2019s learned, what\u2019s hurt and thrilled her, what\u2019s taken up her time and her tears. She lets us in on her life. Because of this we know her and we love her and she knows and loves us too, for listening, for caring and while it\u2019s in many ways unequal and imbalanced and impossible- there is one of her, there are millions of us- it\u2019s still real. The love between us, both ways, is real.</p><p>The 1989 era was the first era where I contextualized my love for Taylor in the world of the internet and so for the first time her fame was a piece of my love for her. It was a part of the equation and I could not be unaffected by it. And it sounds dramatic but it took its toll on me. Even as I cheered for her, a part of my heart cried about her meteoric, terrifying rise to levels of fame heretofore unreached by her- even though she\u2019d been pretty famous since the beginning. I cried at the endless thinkpieces on her authenticity, her girlsquad, that exploded around her as she stepped fully and completely into the pop world. I cried at the levels of scrutiny, I cried the most at the fact that I couldn\u2019t figure out how much Taylor was actually participating in the game of fame- a game I knew was beneath her because it\u2019s beneath everyone- how much what anyone said about her being a calculated, cunning, image-curating fraud was true. I couldn\u2019t see her anymore and I was unable to do anything about it. And I hated it. I never wanted to be that invested in the life of a celebrity I\u2019d never met- I never wanted to feel so aware of the sickening workings of fame and the way it seems to drag down everyone who moves in it. This wasn\u2019t what I signed up for. But I loved Taylor so I was stuck, unable to rejoice in her highs because I knew they were<i> too</i> high, that a backlash was coming because that\u2019s what always happens, waiting for everyone to pounce when the weaknesses in the image of Taylor The Pop Star appeared and the cracks showed. And then they did.</p><p>Look. For the most part, I don\u2019t want to write about Taylor the Celebrity in this project. Not because she doesn\u2019t matter but because I want to look at Taylor the Artist more closely. They\u2019re both manifestations of Taylor the Person but it\u2019s her work as an artist that will last, not her influence as a celebrity. But this is a moment where the story of her celebrity directly plays into both her art and my reaction to it. So bear with me, as this gets a little long and messy.</p><!-- more --><p>I knew going into <i>reputation</i> that we\u2019d be hearing about Taylor\u2019s scars- look what you made me do told us that much- and I expected them to be deep. There was no way the weights and pressures of her kind of fame coupled with her particular personality would allow her to walk away from what happened in this era unscathed. Her insatiable desire to be loved, her drive to be excellent in all aspects and in all respects in order to earn that love in whatever form it took- applause, success, every successful model in the world as her friend at her fingertips- her very eagerness and desperation for it being the thing that kept driving it out of reach- all of these would combine to crush her, at least temporarily, as soon as the tide turned against her. I knew it. We all knew it.\u00a0</p><p>And we knew it because, despite accusations otherwise, Taylor\u2019s humanity is and always has been out in the open in all its messy, ugly, petty, beautiful glory. She has been accused over and over again of being inhuman because she was successful and rich, because she never had a public meltdown like other teenage pop stars, because she never seemed to stumble, but her iron discipline and the way she has always held herself together are the most human things I can think of and her success the thing that put a target on her back. Her very success- that she worked for so hard and that springs from the same place as her desire to be loved- isolated her from the love she\u2019s always wanted.\u00a0</p><p>Taylor Swift always won. Over and over and over. She won from the beginning. Her very success was her Achilles heel; it was her tragedy. She kept winning but winning never filled the hole. Her army of fans aside- and they are not insubstantial but they are also not everyone- no one liked her more for winning. On average, people liked her less. In the end there <i>was</i> a backlash and no amount of her tremendous effort to take the entire world into her arms and onto the 1989 concert stage with her as she felt it brewing could keep it from coming. The harder she fought to ward off criticism before it began, the harder she tried to keep certain stories or angles under wraps, the harder she tried to twist every story to her advantage the fiercer it became, until it all broke in an ugly scandal involving snapchat, a reality tv star, fragments of a phone call and the venom of thousands of people with internet access. Yes I am referring to the #taylorswiftisoverparty. Snapchat gate. The revelation that Taylor had lied or concealed or purposefully obfuscated what happened between her and Kanye in her grammy speech. I\u2019m not interested in untangling all of that or saying definitively who\u2019s at fault or who isn\u2019t, though I will say at the very least Taylor tried to play something two ways, expressing that she was open to being made fun of in a song and then taking back any of that interest in her grammy winning speech in a girl power move. I don\u2019t fully take her side in this, I think it was hypocritical that she even pretended to be open to Kanye on the phone, which she was doing even without having heard the song, and then used her moment of publicity to slam him. But that isn\u2019t really the point here; the point is that this event signaled a huge shift in Taylor\u2019s life- Taylor the Celebrity, Taylor the Artist, Taylor the girl.\u00a0</p><p>Celebrity games and meltdowns are entertaining from the outside, if you don\u2019t think of them as human beings. They\u2019re ridiculous and dramatic and out of touch with reality. Why should they matter as anything other than sport? Why does their success, image, wealth not make them perfectly fair game for sport, especially considering the fact that they are so willing to play that game? Why does it matter that a bunch of people on the internet (because that\u2019s what this was) were saying mean things about a millionaire pop star who was probably at least a little bit at fault? Who CARES? It\u2019s all ridiculous, it\u2019s all empty, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u00a0</p><p>But it <i>does</i> matter. I can guarantee you it matters. Because celebrities are not monkeys or toys or robots though they are often ridiculous and out of touch, though they often perpetuate the hollowness of the world they move in. They\u2019re human, and I truly believe that Taylor felt the weight of that crushing flood of popular hatred with a heartbreaking intensity. There is no way she didn\u2019t. There is no way she didn\u2019t sit in her room and sob; there\u2019s probably no way she didn\u2019t have a panic attack. Because Taylor has betrayed at every turn that she cares what you think of her, she cares so much, she cares. so. much. And she wants to win, she wants to be on top of the world, she wants to be popular and cool and IT and her desperation never gave it to her. The irony of that, right? Someone with her status, with her power, with her money, with her legion of fans never earning the truly popular adoration she wanted so badly, not really, no success without the backlash simmering underneath. Ironic that she could be crushed by the words of random people with far less power, far less money. It doesn\u2019t seem true- surely it can\u2019t be. But it can. And I believe it was. I think it devastated her. As someone who cares about her and has since I was 14, I know I felt that weight of that horrible night, about the sheer number of people crowing that she\u2019d been caught and exposed and they always knew she was horrible, and I was fairly removed from it. The internet can be a ruthless mob and for those 24 hours, probably less but it doesn\u2019t matter, they united in their hatred of Taylor.\u00a0</p><p>My point with sketching all of this out- whew- is to help you understand where I was at when I heard this line: having undergone what felt like a bruising experience, watching Taylor pack up and leave, not hearing from her for months. Even though the silence was welcome after the noise and the worry abated because, well, I knew that she wasn\u2019t alone, that she did have a family to help her through this and because the pre-releases &hellip;<i>ready for it?</i> and <i>Gorgeous</i> had described her falling in love, lwymmd her biting back (even if it wasn\u2019t how I wanted)- I knew she was okay. But we hadn\u2019t gotten any more than that, I didn\u2019t know any more until <i>Call It What You Want.</i></p><p>The point of all of this is<i>\u00a0they fade to nothing when I look at him</i>\u00a0is the moment that broke me because it so clearly healed her.\u00a0</p><p>(And here I do want to step back and say that I am looking at this relationship, this love, in terms of a story- not claiming to know too much about the\u00a0\u201creal\u201d Joe Alwyn or even every detail of Taylor\u2019s heart.)\u00a0</p><p>But it is clear that we are hearing something <i>real</i> and this was the first time when I really knew Taylor was going to be okay, that she\u2019d made it to the other side.</p><p>The opening lines of the song retain their tension with the upward tilt of the line endings as she recounts the breakdown in a series of images:</p><blockquote><p><i>my castle crumbled overnight<br/>my flowers grew back as thorns\u00a0</i></p></blockquote><p>The chorus is light and sweet marked by one image:</p><blockquote><p><i>walking with his head down, I\u2019m the one he\u2019s walking to</i></p></blockquote><p>-the haunting image of Someone moving through a crowd, against the flow, moving towards her, made all the more haunting by the fact that we know that paparazzi and literal crowds, throngs, hordes of people are a part of Taylor\u2019s life.\u00a0</p><p>But <i>they fade to nothing when I look at him</i> is the line that breaks the song open. Fade to nothing. Taylor, our competitive Taylor with her grudge-holding streak and her pettiness and her very long memory, doesn\u2019t let things fade. It is both her strength and her weakness that she never lets anything go. She never forgets. If there is any semblance of a battle or a competition, and fame is often if not always both, her aim is to win. She has to dominate. She HAS TO.</p><p>But for the first time, that\u2019s not what happens. The noise, the people with their taunts and stones and cruelties, their disapproval, their think-pieces, even the people with their potential approval and applause waiting for her if she just does the right thing- all of these fade away because in this story, in this moment, she has someone who loves her the way she\u2019s been looking for this whole time, like she\u2019s\u00a0\u201cbrand new\u201d. It\u2019s a moment of healing, it\u2019s a moment of grace. They fade to nothing <i>when</i> she looks at him. On her own Taylor is a fighter who would die before she gave in, gave up. But with someone else opposite her she steadies. She stops taking on the crowd, the noise, the abstract weight of popular opinion and she does it in a minute in the meeting of eyes, in the grace of a single moment of connection, love, and trust.</p><blockquote><p><i>They fade to nothing when I look at him</i></p></blockquote><p>The song unfolds from there, its more rigid structure giving way to a flood of admission she could never make before this exact moment.</p><blockquote><p><i>And I know I make the same mistakes, bridges burn, I never learn</i></p></blockquote><p>Her mistakes, her faults, the part SHE played in all of this- even if all that comes down to is a participation in the game of fame that made popularity itself the end goal instead of the things it should have been- comes tumbling out in a rush in a way she could never admit while she tried to face the storm alone, when she held onto her pride and her resistance and even her sins and mistakes with all her might because it was all she had. Because he\u2019s here, because he sees her, because he loves her, the walls come down and she says what she never could before which is only something as simple as \u201cmaybe I was wrong too\u201d. It\u2019s not the whole point of the song, Taylor is still prickly about her wounds and scars, she is still defensive, she is still angry- \u201cwhich is more than they can say\u201d is full of bitterness despite its lightness- and in many ways she\u2019s right to be angry. But this moment, the moment after it all fades away, isn\u2019t about what other people have done, but what she has done. And because of that the way she sings \u201cat least I did one thing right\u201d is full of relief and gratitude. It is as much of a healing thing for her to say as his love is to receive. To admit that she doesn\u2019t do everything right, that she makes mistakes, she needed that. But she needed to be loved before she could do it. Love is the start of healing, love is the beginning of our strength to look at ourselves and face what we\u2019ve done. There is no other way to bear it.\u00a0</p><p>That line is the most important in the song to me and everything else moves around it and in its light.</p><p>The flood of cliches that follows <i>laughing with my lover, making forts under covers, trust him like a brother</i> are grounded in the moment of fading and in the self-realization that follows (<i>I know I\u2019m this way, I know I always have to win, do you think I don\u2019t know I\u2019m this way, do you think I\u2019m not struggling too</i>) and so they take on the sweetness of their original meaning, the cliches serving as the expression of the greater truth of living and loving. <i>Call it what you want</i>- she says. I don\u2019t have a name for this either. I can\u2019t sum it up and so we fall back on cliches.</p><p>And the final moment of the song, of the bridge wraps it all together- tying her past work to her present with the callback to the other time she asked someone to run away with her- in<i> Love Story</i>. There too she got her happy ending but with the innocence of an untried fairy tale underscored by the exuberant joy of the satisfying key change. Here the fairy tale is gone, the castle has crumbled. It\u2019s not a balcony in summer air, it\u2019s late November. And she is hesitant, she has to clarify, she stumbles a little to explain the situation, \u201cyou don\u2019t need to save me\u201d, but it\u2019s real. He\u2019s real. This is real.</p><p>And that\u2019s everything.\u00a0</p>",

Fade to nothing. Taylor, our competitive Taylor with her grudge-holding streak and her pettiness and her very long memory, doesn\u2019t let things fade. It is both her strength and her weakness that she never lets anything go. She never forgets. If there is any semblance of a battle or a competition, and fame is often if not always both, her aim is to win. She has to dominate. She HAS TO.</p><p>But for the first time, that\u2019s not what happens. The noise, the people with their taunts and stones and cruelties, their disapproval, their think-pieces, even the people with their potential approval and applause waiting for her if she just does the right thing- all of these fade away because in this story, in this moment, she has someone who loves her the way she\u2019s been looking for this whole time, like she\u2019s\u00a0\u201cbrand new\u201d. It\u2019s a moment of healing, it\u2019s a moment of grace. They fade to nothing <i>when</i> she looks at him. On her own Taylor is a fighter who would die before she gave in, gave up. But with someone else opposite her she steadies. She stops taking on the crowd, the noise, the abstract weight of popular opinion and she does it in a minute in the meeting of eyes, in the grace of a single moment of connection, love, and trust.</p><blockquote><p><i>They fade to nothing when I look at him</i></p></blockquote><p>The song unfolds from there, its more rigid structure giving way to a flood of admission she could never make before this exact moment.</p><blockquote><p><i>And I know I make the same mistakes, bridges burn, I never learn</i></p></blockquote><p>Her mistakes, her faults, the part SHE played in all of this- even if all that comes down to is a participation in the game of fame that made popularity itself the end goal instead of the things it should have been- comes tumbling out in a rush in a way she could never admit while she tried to face the storm alone, when she held onto her pride and her resistance and even her sins and mistakes with all her might because it was all she had. Because he\u2019s here, because he sees her, because he loves her, the walls come down and she says what she never could before which is only something as simple as \u201cmaybe I was wrong too\u201d. It\u2019s not the whole point of the song, Taylor is still prickly about her wounds and scars, she is still defensive, she is still angry- \u201cwhich is more than they can say\u201d is full of bitterness despite its lightness- and in many ways she\u2019s right to be angry. But this moment, the moment after it all fades away, isn\u2019t about what other people have done, but what she has done. And because of that the way she sings \u201cat least I did one thing right\u201d is full of relief and gratitude. It is as much of a healing thing for her to say as his love is to receive. To admit that she doesn\u2019t do everything right, that she makes mistakes, she needed that. But she needed to be loved before she could do it. Love is the start of healing, love is the beginning of our strength to look at ourselves and face what we\u2019ve done. There is no other way to bear it.\u00a0</p><p>That line is the most important in the song to me and everything else moves around it and in its light.</p><p>The flood of cliches that follows <i>laughing with my lover, making forts under covers, trust him like a brother</i> are grounded in the moment of fading and in the self-realization that follows (<i>I know I\u2019m this way, I know I always have to win, do you think I don\u2019t know I\u2019m this way, do you think I\u2019m not struggling too</i>) and so they take on the sweetness of their original meaning, the cliches serving as the expression of the greater truth of living and loving. <i>Call it what you want</i>- she says. I don\u2019t have a name for this either. I can\u2019t sum it up and so we fall back on cliches.</p><p>And the final moment of the song, of the bridge wraps it all together- tying her past work to her present with the callback to the other time she asked someone to run away with her- in<i> Love Story</i>.

It\u2019s not a balcony in summer air, it\u2019s late November. And she is hesitant, she has to clarify, she stumbles a little to explain the situation, \u201cyou don\u2019t need to save me\u201d, but it\u2019s real. He\u2019s real.

This is not as common a reaction for me to Taylor songs as you might think; it\u2019s actually only happened a handful of times. I didn\u2019t cry right at the beginning of the song either. At first I was only holding my breath trying to process all of it and take it all in as best I could. The moment that made me cry was: <i>they fade to nothing when I look at him.</i></p><p>Part of being a Taylor fan is caring about her personal life, and sure, it\u2019s filtered in her art. It\u2019s important to remember that it isn\u2019t 100% autobiographical, that the Taylor we know is probably not exactly the same as the actual girl/woman, but still. Taylor has been telling us how she\u2019s doing for years now. Approximately every two years, very nearly like clockwork, she appears to tell us about the past two years of her life. There\u2019s a theme, an aesthetic, a whole to-do. Most importantly there\u2019s her words and the state of her heart- a fairly faithful transcription of everything big that\u2019s happened to her. She lets us in on what she\u2019s learned, what\u2019s hurt and thrilled her, what\u2019s taken up her time and her tears. She lets us in on her life. Because of this we know her and we love her and she knows and loves us too, for listening, for caring and while it\u2019s in many ways unequal and imbalanced and impossible- there is one of her, there are millions of us- it\u2019s still real. The love between us, both ways, is real.</p><p>The 1989 era was the first era where I contextualized my love for Taylor in the world of the internet and so for the first time her fame was a piece of my love for her. It was a part of the equation and I could not be unaffected by it. And it sounds dramatic but it took its toll on me. Even as I cheered for her, a part of my heart cried about her meteoric, terrifying rise to levels of fame heretofore unreached by her- even though she\u2019d been pretty famous since the beginning. I cried at the endless thinkpieces on her authenticity, her girlsquad, that exploded around her as she stepped fully and completely into the pop world. I cried at the levels of scrutiny, I cried the most at the fact that I couldn\u2019t figure out how much Taylor was actually participating in the game of fame- a game I knew was beneath her because it\u2019s beneath everyone- how much what anyone said about her being a calculated, cunning, image-curating fraud was true. I couldn\u2019t see her anymore and I was unable to do anything about it. And I hated it. I never wanted to be that invested in the life of a celebrity I\u2019d never met- I never wanted to feel so aware of the sickening workings of fame and the way it seems to drag down everyone who moves in it. This wasn\u2019t what I signed up for. But I loved Taylor so I was stuck, unable to rejoice in her highs because I knew they were<i> too</i> high, that a backlash was coming because that\u2019s what always happens, waiting for everyone to pounce when the weaknesses in the image of Taylor The Pop Star appeared and the cracks showed. And then they did.</p><p>Look. For the most part, I don\u2019t want to write about Taylor the Celebrity in this project. Not because she doesn\u2019t matter but because I want to look at Taylor the Artist more closely. They\u2019re both manifestations of Taylor the Person but it\u2019s her work as an artist that will last, not her influence as a celebrity. But this is a moment where the story of her celebrity directly plays into both her art and my reaction to it. So bear with me, as this gets a little long and messy.</p>[[MORE]]<p>I knew going into <i>reputation</i> that we\u2019d be hearing about Taylor\u2019s scars- look what you made me do told us that much- and I expected them to be deep. There was no way the weights and pressures of her kind of fame coupled with her particular personality would allow her to walk away from what happened in this era unscathed. Her insatiable desire to be loved, her drive to be excellent in all aspects and in all respects in order to earn that love in whatever form it took- applause, success, every successful model in the world as her friend at her fingertips- her very eagerness and desperation for it being the thing that kept driving it out of reach- all of these would combine to crush her, at least temporarily, as soon as the tide turned against her. I knew it. We all knew it.\u00a0</p><p>And we knew it because, despite accusations otherwise, Taylor\u2019s humanity is and always has been out in the open in all its messy, ugly, petty, beautiful glory. She has been accused over and over again of being inhuman because she was successful and rich, because she never had a public meltdown like other teenage pop stars, because she never seemed to stumble, but her iron discipline and the way she has always held herself together are the most human things I can think of and her success the thing that put a target on her back. Her very success- that she worked for so hard and that springs from the same place as her desire to be loved- isolated her from the love she\u2019s always wanted.\u00a0</p><p>Taylor Swift always won. Over and over and over. She won from the beginning. Her very success was her Achilles heel; it was her tragedy. She kept winning but winning never filled the hole. Her army of fans aside- and they are not insubstantial but they are also not everyone- no one liked her more for winning. On average, people liked her less. In the end there <i>was</i> a backlash and no amount of her tremendous effort to take the entire world into her arms and onto the 1989 concert stage with her as she felt it brewing could keep it from coming. The harder she fought to ward off criticism before it began, the harder she tried to keep certain stories or angles under wraps, the harder she tried to twist every story to her advantage the fiercer it became, until it all broke in an ugly scandal involving snapchat, a reality tv star, fragments of a phone call and the venom of thousands of people with internet access. Yes I am referring to the #taylorswiftisoverparty. Snapchat gate. The revelation that Taylor had lied or concealed or purposefully obfuscated what happened between her and Kanye in her grammy speech. I\u2019m not interested in untangling all of that or saying definitively who\u2019s at fault or who isn\u2019t, though I will say at the very least Taylor tried to play something two ways, expressing that she was open to being made fun of in a song and then taking back any of that interest in her grammy winning speech in a girl power move. I don\u2019t fully take her side in this, I think it was hypocritical that she even pretended to be open to Kanye on the phone, which she was doing even without having heard the song, and then used her moment of publicity to slam him. But that isn\u2019t really the point here; the point is that this event signaled a huge shift in Taylor\u2019s life- Taylor the Celebrity, Taylor the Artist, Taylor the girl.\u00a0</p><p>Celebrity games and meltdowns are entertaining from the outside, if you don\u2019t think of them as human beings. They\u2019re ridiculous and dramatic and out of touch with reality. Why should they matter as anything other than sport? Why does their success, image, wealth not make them perfectly fair game for sport, especially considering the fact that they are so willing to play that game? Why does it matter that a bunch of people on the internet (because that\u2019s what this was) were saying mean things about a millionaire pop star who was probably at least a little bit at fault? Who CARES? It\u2019s all ridiculous, it\u2019s all empty, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u00a0</p><p>But it <i>does</i> matter. I can guarantee you it matters. Because celebrities are not monkeys or toys or robots though they are often ridiculous and out of touch, though they often perpetuate the hollowness of the world they move in. They\u2019re human, and I truly believe that Taylor felt the weight of that crushing flood of popular hatred with a heartbreaking intensity. There is no way she didn\u2019t. There is no way she didn\u2019t sit in her room and sob; there\u2019s probably no way she didn\u2019t have a panic attack. Because Taylor has betrayed at every turn that she cares what you think of her, she cares so much, she cares. so. much. And she wants to win, she wants to be on top of the world, she wants to be popular and cool and IT and her desperation never gave it to her. The irony of that, right? Someone with her status, with her power, with her money, with her legion of fans never earning the truly popular adoration she wanted so badly, not really, no success without the backlash simmering underneath. Ironic that she could be crushed by the words of random people with far less power, far less money. It doesn\u2019t seem true- surely it can\u2019t be. But it can. And I believe it was. I think it devastated her. As someone who cares about her and has since I was 14, I know I felt that weight of that horrible night, about the sheer number of people crowing that she\u2019d been caught and exposed and they always knew she was horrible, and I was fairly removed from it. The internet can be a ruthless mob and for those 24 hours, probably less but it doesn\u2019t matter, they united in their hatred of Taylor.\u00a0</p><p>My point with sketching all of this out- whew- is to help you understand where I was at when I heard this line: having undergone what felt like a bruising experience, watching Taylor pack up and leave, not hearing from her for months. Even though the silence was welcome after the noise and the worry abated because, well, I knew that she wasn\u2019t alone, that she did have a family to help her through this and because the pre-releases \u2026<i>ready for it?</i> and <i>Gorgeous</i> had described her falling in love, lwymmd her biting back (even if it wasn\u2019t how I wanted)- I knew she was okay. But we hadn\u2019t gotten any more than that, I didn\u2019t know any more until <i>Call It What You Want.</i></p><p>The point of all of this is<i>\u00a0they fade to nothing when I look at him</i>\u00a0is the moment that broke me because it so clearly healed her.\u00a0</p><p>(And here I do want to step back and say that I am looking at this relationship, this love, in terms of a story- not claiming to know too much about the\u00a0\u201creal\u201d Joe Alwyn or even every detail of Taylor\u2019s heart.)\u00a0</p><p>But it is clear that we are hearing something <i>real</i> and this was the first time when I really knew Taylor was going to be okay, that she\u2019d made it to the other side.</p><p>The opening lines of the song retain their tension with the upward tilt of the line endings as she recounts the breakdown in a series of images:</p><blockquote><p><i>my castle crumbled overnight<br>my flowers grew back as thorns\u00a0</i></p></blockquote><p>The chorus is light and sweet marked by one image:</p><blockquote><p><i>walking with his head down, I\u2019m the one he\u2019s walking to</i></p></blockquote><p>-the haunting image of Someone moving through a crowd, against the flow, moving towards her, made all the more haunting by the fact that we know that paparazzi and literal crowds, throngs, hordes of people are a part of Taylor\u2019s life.\u00a0</p><p>But <i>they fade to nothing when I look at him</i> is the line that breaks the song open.

I cried at the levels of scrutiny, I cried the most at the fact that I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how much Taylor was actually participating in the game of fame- a game I knew was beneath her because it&rsquo;s beneath everyone- how much what anyone said about her being a calculated, cunning, image-curating fraud was true. I couldn&rsquo;t see her anymore and I was unable to do anything about it. And I hated it. I never wanted to be that invested in the life of a celebrity I&rsquo;d never met- I never wanted to feel so aware of the sickening workings of fame and the way it seems to drag down everyone who moves in it. This wasn&rsquo;t what I signed up for. But I loved Taylor so I was stuck, unable to rejoice in her highs because I knew they were<i> too</i> high, that a backlash was coming because that&rsquo;s what always happens, waiting for everyone to pounce when the weaknesses in the image of Taylor The Pop Star appeared and the cracks showed. And then they did.</p><p>Look. For the most part, I don&rsquo;t want to write about Taylor the Celebrity in this project. Not because she doesn&rsquo;t matter but because I want to look at Taylor the Artist more closely. They&rsquo;re both manifestations of Taylor the Person but it&rsquo;s her work as an artist that will last, not her influence as a celebrity. But this is a moment where the story of her celebrity directly plays into both her art and my reaction to it. So bear with me, as this gets a little long and messy.</p><p>I knew going into <i>reputation</i> that we&rsquo;d be hearing about Taylor&rsquo;s scars- look what you made me do told us that much- and I expected them to be deep. There was no way the weights and pressures of her kind of fame coupled with her particular personality would allow her to walk away from what happened in this era unscathed. Her insatiable desire to be loved, her drive to be excellent in all aspects and in all respects in order to earn that love in whatever form it took- applause, success, every successful model in the world as her friend at her fingertips- her very eagerness and desperation for it being the thing that kept driving it out of reach- all of these would combine to crush her, at least temporarily, as soon as the tide turned against her. I knew it. We all knew it.&nbsp;</p><p>And we knew it because, despite accusations otherwise, Taylor&rsquo;s humanity is and always has been out in the open in all its messy, ugly, petty, beautiful glory. She has been accused over and over again of being inhuman because she was successful and rich, because she never had a public meltdown like other teenage pop stars, because she never seemed to stumble, but her iron discipline and the way she has always held herself together are the most human things I can think of and her success the thing that put a target on her back. Her very success- that she worked for so hard and that springs from the same place as her desire to be loved- isolated her from the love she&rsquo;s always wanted.&nbsp;</p><p>Taylor Swift always won. Over and over and over. She won from the beginning. Her very success was her Achilles heel; it was her tragedy. She kept winning but winning never filled the hole. Her army of fans aside- and they are not insubstantial but they are also not everyone- no one liked her more for winning. On average, people liked her less. In the end there <i>was</i> a backlash and no amount of her tremendous effort to take the entire world into her arms and onto the 1989 concert stage with her as she felt it brewing could keep it from coming. The harder she fought to ward off criticism before it began, the harder she tried to keep certain stories or angles under wraps, the harder she tried to twist every story to her advantage the fiercer it became, until it all broke in an ugly scandal involving snapchat, a reality tv star, fragments of a phone call and the venom of thousands of people with internet access. Yes I am referring to the #taylorswiftisoverparty. Snapchat gate. The revelation that Taylor had lied or concealed or purposefully obfuscated what happened between her and Kanye in her grammy speech. I&rsquo;m not interested in untangling all of that or saying definitively who&rsquo;s at fault or who isn&rsquo;t, though I will say at the very least Taylor tried to play something two ways, expressing that she was open to being made fun of in a song and then taking back any of that interest in her grammy winning speech in a girl power move. I don&rsquo;t fully take her side in this, I think it was hypocritical that she even pretended to be open to Kanye on the phone, which she was doing even without having heard the song, and then used her moment of publicity to slam him. But that isn&rsquo;t really the point here; the point is that this event signaled a huge shift in Taylor&rsquo;s life- Taylor the Celebrity, Taylor the Artist, Taylor the girl.&nbsp;</p><p>Celebrity games and meltdowns are entertaining from the outside, if you don&rsquo;t think of them as human beings. They&rsquo;re ridiculous and dramatic and out of touch with reality. Why should they matter as anything other than sport? Why does their success, image, wealth not make them perfectly fair game for sport, especially considering the fact that they are so willing to play that game? Why does it matter that a bunch of people on the internet (because that&rsquo;s what this was) were saying mean things about a millionaire pop star who was probably at least a little bit at fault? Who CARES? It&rsquo;s all ridiculous, it&rsquo;s all empty, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.&nbsp;</p><p>But it <i>does</i> matter. I can guarantee you it matters. Because celebrities are not monkeys or toys or robots though they are often ridiculous and out of touch, though they often perpetuate the hollowness of the world they move in. They&rsquo;re human, and I truly believe that Taylor felt the weight of that crushing flood of popular hatred with a heartbreaking intensity. There is no way she didn&rsquo;t. There is no way she didn&rsquo;t sit in her room and sob; there&rsquo;s probably no way she didn&rsquo;t have a panic attack. Because Taylor has betrayed at every turn that she cares what you think of her, she cares so much, she cares. so. much. And she wants to win, she wants to be on top of the world, she wants to be popular and cool and IT and her desperation never gave it to her. The irony of that, right? Someone with her status, with her power, with her money, with her legion of fans never earning the truly popular adoration she wanted so badly, not really, no success without the backlash simmering underneath. Ironic that she could be crushed by the words of random people with far less power, far less money. It doesn&rsquo;t seem true- surely it can&rsquo;t be. But it can. And I believe it was. I think it devastated her. As someone who cares about her and has since I was 14, I know I felt that weight of that horrible night, about the sheer number of people crowing that she&rsquo;d been caught and exposed and they always knew she was horrible, and I was fairly removed from it. The internet can be a ruthless mob and for those 24 hours, probably less but it doesn&rsquo;t matter, they united in their hatred of Taylor.&nbsp;</p><p>My point with sketching all of this out- whew- is to help you understand where I was at when I heard this line: having undergone what felt like a bruising experience, watching Taylor pack up and leave, not hearing from her for months. Even though the silence was welcome after the noise and the worry abated because, well, I knew that she wasn&rsquo;t alone, that she did have a family to help her through this and because the pre-releases &hellip;<i>ready for it?</i> and <i>Gorgeous</i> had described her falling in love, lwymmd her biting back (even if it wasn&rsquo;t how I wanted)- I knew she was okay. But we hadn&rsquo;t gotten any more than that, I didn&rsquo;t know any more until <i>Call It What You Want.</i></p><p>The point of all of this is<i>&nbsp;they fade to nothing when I look at him</i>&nbsp;is the moment that broke me because it so clearly healed her.&nbsp;</p><p>(And here I do want to step back and say that I am looking at this relationship, this love, in terms of a story- not claiming to know too much about the&nbsp;&ldquo;real&rdquo; Joe Alwyn or even every detail of Taylor&rsquo;s heart.)&nbsp;</p><p>But it is clear that we are hearing something <i>real</i> and this was the first time when I really knew Taylor was going to be okay, that she&rsquo;d made it to the other side.</p><p>The opening lines of the song retain their tension with the upward tilt of the line endings as she recounts the breakdown in a series of images:</p><blockquote><p><i>my castle crumbled overnight<br />my flowers grew back as thorns&nbsp;</i></p></blockquote><p>The chorus is light and sweet marked by one image:</p><blockquote><p><i>walking with his head down, I&rsquo;m the one he&rsquo;s walking to</i></p></blockquote><p>-the haunting image of Someone moving through a crowd, against the flow, moving towards her, made all the more haunting by the fact that we know that paparazzi and literal crowds, throngs, hordes of people are a part of Taylor&rsquo;s life.&nbsp;</p><p>But <i>they fade to nothing when I look at him</i> is the line that breaks the song open. Fade to nothing. Taylor, our competitive Taylor with her grudge-holding streak and her pettiness and her very long memory, doesn&rsquo;t let things fade. It is both her strength and her weakness that she never lets anything go. She never forgets. If there is any semblance of a battle or a competition, and fame is often if not always both, her aim is to win. She has to dominate. She HAS TO.</p><p>But for the first time, that&rsquo;s not what happens. The noise, the people with their taunts and stones and cruelties, their disapproval, their think-pieces, even the people with their potential approval and applause waiting for her if she just does the right thing- all of these fade away because in this story, in this moment, she has someone who loves her the way she&rsquo;s been looking for this whole time, like she&rsquo;s&nbsp;&ldquo;brand new&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a moment of healing, it&rsquo;s a moment of grace. They fade to nothing <i>when</i> she looks at him. On her own Taylor is a fighter who would die before she gave in, gave up. But with someone else opposite her she steadies. She stops taking on the crowd, the noise, the abstract weight of popular opinion and she does it in a minute in the meeting of eyes, in the grace of a single moment of connection, love, and trust.</p><blockquote><p><i>They fade to nothing when I look at him</i></p></blockquote><p>The song unfolds from there, its more rigid structure giving way to a flood of admission she could never make before this exact moment.</p><blockquote><p><i>And I know I make the same mistakes, bridges burn, I never learn</i></p></blockquote><p>Her mistakes, her faults, the part SHE played in all of this- even if all that comes down to is a participation in the game of fame that made popularity itself the end goal instead of the things it should have been- comes tumbling out in a rush in a way she could never admit while she tried to face the storm alone, when she held onto her pride and her resistance and even her sins and mistakes with all her might because it was all she had. Because he&rsquo;s here, because he sees her, because he loves her, the walls come down and she says what she never could before which is only something as simple as &ldquo;maybe I was wrong too&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s not the whole point of the song, Taylor is still prickly about her wounds and scars, she is still defensive, she is still angry- &ldquo;which is more than they can say&rdquo; is full of bitterness despite its lightness- and in many ways she&rsquo;s right to be angry. But this moment, the moment after it all fades away, isn&rsquo;t about what other people have done, but what she has done. And because of that the way she sings &ldquo;at least I did one thing right&rdquo; is full of relief and gratitude. It is as much of a healing thing for her to say as his love is to receive. To admit that she doesn&rsquo;t do everything right, that she makes mistakes, she needed that. But she needed to be loved before she could do it. Love is the start of healing, love is the beginning of our strength to look at ourselves and face what we&rsquo;ve done. There is no other way to bear it.&nbsp;</p><p>That line is the most important in the song to me and everything else moves around it and in its light.</p><p>The flood of cliches that follows <i>laughing with my lover, making forts under covers, trust him like a brother</i> are grounded in the moment of fading and in the self-realization that follows (<i>I know I&rsquo;m this way, I know I always have to win, do you think I don&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m this way, do you think I&rsquo;m not struggling too</i>) and so they take on the sweetness of their original meaning, the cliches serving as the expression of the greater truth of living and loving. <i>Call it what you want</i>- she says. I don&rsquo;t have a name for this either. I can&rsquo;t sum it up and so we fall back on cliches.</p><p>And the final moment of the song, of the bridge wraps it all together- tying her past work to her present with the callback to the other time she asked someone to run away with her- in<i> Love Story</i>. There too she got her happy ending but with the innocence of an untried fairy tale underscored by the exuberant joy of the satisfying key change. Here the fairy tale is gone, the castle has crumbled. It&rsquo;s not a balcony in summer air, it&rsquo;s late November. And she is hesitant, she has to clarify, she stumbles a little to explain the situation, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t need to save me&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s real. He&rsquo;s real. This is real.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s everything.&nbsp;</p></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n\n<h2>Call It What you Want&nbsp;<br />\n</h2>\n<p>[a hundred days of Taylor, day 1]</p>\n<blockquote><p><i>walking with his head down I&rsquo;m the one he&rsquo;s walking to</i><br /></p></blockquote>\n<p>When I first heard <i>Call It What You Want</i> I cried. This is not as common a reaction for me to Taylor songs as you might think; it&rsquo;s actually only happened a handful of times. I didn&rsquo;t cry right at the beginning of the song either. At first I was only holding my breath trying to process all of it and take it all in as best I could. The moment that made me cry was: <i>they fade to nothing when I look at him.</i></p>\n<p>Part of being a Taylor fan is caring about her personal life, and sure, it&rsquo;s filtered in her art. It&rsquo;s important to remember that it isn&rsquo;t 100% autobiographical, that the Taylor we know is probably not exactly the same as the actual girl/woman, but still. Taylor has been telling us how she&rsquo;s doing for years now. Approximately every two years, very nearly like clockwork, she appears to tell us about the past two years of her life. There&rsquo;s a theme, an aesthetic, a whole to-do. Most importantly there&rsquo;s her words and the state of her heart- a fairly faithful transcription of everything big that&rsquo;s happened to her. She lets us in on what she&rsquo;s learned, what&rsquo;s hurt and thrilled her, what&rsquo;s taken up her time and her tears. She lets us in on her life. Because of this we know her and we love her and she knows and loves us too, for listening, for caring and while it&rsquo;s in many ways unequal and imbalanced and impossible- there is one of her, there are millions of us- it&rsquo;s still real. The love between us, both ways, is real.</p>\n<p>The 1989 era was the first era where I contextualized my love for Taylor in the world of the internet and so for the first time her fame was a piece of my love for her. It was a part of the equation and I could not be unaffected by it. And it sounds dramatic but it took its toll on me. Even as I cheered for her, a part of my heart cried about her meteoric, terrifying rise to levels of fame heretofore unreached by her- even though she&rsquo;d been pretty famous since the beginning. I cried at the endless thinkpieces on her authenticity, her girlsquad, that exploded around her as she stepped fully and completely into the pop world.
