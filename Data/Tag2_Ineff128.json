        "answer": "<p><i><b>Sure</b></i><b><i> thing, nonnie! A message to any readers: this is extremely smutty, so you&rsquo;ve been warned. The usual restrictions apply.</i></b></p><p><strike><i>I&rsquo;m obviously tagging this as Good Omens but if Neil Gaiman ever reads this I will shoot myself</i></strike></p><p><i>(Also, if i know you irl maybe don&rsquo;t read this, it&rsquo;d be super awkward. I mean, you can, if you don&rsquo;t mind the awkwardness.)</i></p><p>The black cab containing a heavily drunk angel and demon rumbled through the London night, bright lights blurring as buildings sped past the window. Skyscrapers, bridges, and centuries old monuments went by unseen by the cabbie as he grumbled in the front, only being seperated from the two men (who were singing very loudly and incredibly out of tune) by a sheet of plexiglass. It was strange - he was sure he&rsquo;d been listening to Radio 4, but the usual lineup of depressing news stories and slightly more depressing comedy shows seemed to have been replaced by a constant stream of Queen. </p><p>He adjusted his rear-view mirror to get a better look at the two men in the back. The first was a tall, wirey figure, rakish in mannerism, and dressed from head to snakeskin booted toe in black. Despite the late hour, he was wearing round, wire rimmed sunglasses. </p><p><!-- more --></p><p>The man in black was leaning over the second figure, a small, plump gentleman who appeared to have stepped straight out of the 1950s. His cream shirt - complete with sweater vest - and beige trousers had been rumpled by a night&rsquo;s festivities, but it was clear that he took great care of himself. More care, in the cabbie&rsquo;s opinion, than a real man should. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, you two would like Queen.&rdquo; He thought, as the pair belted out the final chorus of You&rsquo;re My Best Friend.</p><p>The tall man suddenly lunged forwards towards the glass divide.</p><p>&ldquo;Driver! Pull over here! We&rsquo;ve arrived!&rdquo; He slurred into the intercom. </p><p>He pulled over outside a glistening new apartment block and gave the price of the fair.</p><p>Crowley reached into his pocket and pulled out two Scottish bank notes. </p><p>&ldquo;Low grade evil at it&rsquo;s finest.&rdquo; He winked at Aziraphale, after the driver had begrudgingly accepted that it was legal tender (though wondering who in their right mind would accept them from him this far south of the border) and sped off, glad to be rid of the two strange men.</p><p>The pair stumbled through the foyer of the apartment block to the lift, and began to accend the fifty or so floors to the pent house suit belonging to Crowley.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;ve finally accepted my invitation to come round, angel. You despise my apartment.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, yes, quite so,&rdquo; Spluttered Aziraphale defensively. &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t suppose I&rsquo;ll be able to get another taxi at the time of night, so I&rsquo;m left with no option. I don&rsquo;t know why we couldn&rsquo;t have just taken the Bentley.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my night off! I&rsquo;m not sobering myself up just to drive. Besides, you&rsquo;re here now.&rdquo;</p><p>The lift dinged as a robotic female voice announced that they had reached the suite.</p><p>Crowley swaggered into the apartment and made a beeline for the whiskey cabinet. He didn&rsquo;t notice that Aziraphale&rsquo;s glass turned mysteriously into red wine as it was handed to him.</p><p>&ldquo;My dear, where will I be staying? I&rsquo;ll just go and put my coat on the bed.&rdquo; Aziraphale asked as Crowley flopped down on the settee.</p><p>&ldquo;Just through the door on your right.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s your room, darling.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course. Do you have any idea how expensive a two bedroom flat is in central London?&rdquo; Crowley grinned devilishly.</p><p>&ldquo;So where will you be sleeping?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;In my room.&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale froze. What the devil was he playing at?</p><p>&ldquo;If this is a joke, I don&rsquo;t find it very funny, dear.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley stood up and slowly walked towards him. He towered over his small frame, and bent over to lean in close to his ear. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no joke, angel.&rdquo; He whispered, his breath warm on Aziraphale&rsquo;s neck. The angel broke into a hot sweat.</p><p>&ldquo;Really, Crowley, you mustn&rsquo;t - you know how it is! We&rsquo;re on different sides! We couldn&rsquo;t&hellip;I couldn&rsquo;t possibly -&rdquo; he stuttered, his mind racing for an excuse. </p><p>Six thousand years. Six thousand years of being together - of arguing, of laughing, of drinking, of working. Deep conversations in quiet restaurants at midnight. Lightly brushing against each other by accident, hoping the other wouldn&rsquo;t notice or react. Six thousand years of stealing secret\u00a0glances at each other when they thought no one was looking. Six thousands years of pining. Of yearning. Of craving.</p><p>And now that this moment had come, the angel was completely and utterly overwhelmed.</p><p>Though his countenance didn&rsquo;t show it, Crowley, too, was terrified. He hasn&rsquo;t planned to come on this strong. Hell, he hasn&rsquo;t planned to come on at all. His original thought was that he would just sleep on the chaise-lounge and let Aziraphale take his bedroom. But for the past week, Crowley had been troubled. Though demons didn&rsquo;t need to sleep, Crowley had always been one for getting his head down where and when he felt like it. But each night for the past week, the demon had laid awake in his empty king sized bed, crushing loneliness weighing down on his chest. He couldn&rsquo;t get the angel&rsquo;s face out of his mind, and he knew he had to do something about it. It was ridiculous- the two had spent millennia playing the world&rsquo;s most homoerotic game of metaphorical chess to prove to each other that there was nothing between them. </p><p>But there was.</p><p>Oh <strike>god</strike> <i>Hell</i>, there was.</p><p>The two stood there in silence of a few moments, a stand off to see who would act first. Aziraphale could see his own frightened face reflected in Crowley&rsquo;s sunglasses.</p><p>Without thinking, the angel furrowed his brow, grabbed the demon&rsquo;s glasses, and threw them across the room.</p><p>Crowley raised one perfectly sculpted eyebrow.</p><p>&ldquo;My, <i>my</i> angel. Is that a ye-&rdquo; he was cut off by Aziraphale pushing his lips into Crowley&rsquo;s, in an act that surpised him almost as much as it did Aziraphale. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Finally</i>.&rdquo; The demon mumbled against his lips as they staggered backwards towards the wall. </p><p>Crowley pinned him against the wall, using one hand to keep him there and the other to feel at his chest. The kiss deepened, tongues exchanged, and Crowley&rsquo;s hand began to reach for Aziraphale&rsquo;s shirt buttons.</p><p>The angel whimpered.</p><p>Crowley backed off slightly, breaking the kiss between them. </p><p>&ldquo;Angel, are you sure you want to go through with this?&rdquo; He said gently, genuine concern in his serpentine eyes.</p><p>Aziraphale took a deep breath, gathered himself, and looked up from the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Dearest, I want you to fuck me.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley almost let out an audible gasp at the statement. </p><p>He&rsquo;d never heard Aziraphale say fuck before. </p><p>But he wasn&rsquo;t going to say no.</p><p>The intensity in the air grew as Crowley ripped the angel&rsquo;s shirt off, buttons flying in all directions. He knew that he&rsquo;s be able to fix them in the morning if he willed it so.</p><p>Crowley&rsquo;s tongue traced the outline of Aziraphale&rsquo;s neck, sucking on his tender spots, and the angel let out a small moan of pleasure. The noise lit a fire inside Crowley.</p><p>He flung off his own shirt and began quickly unbuckling Aziraphale&rsquo;s trousers, slipping one hand inside his perfectly laundered underwear.</p><p>The angel&rsquo;s fingers knotted themselves into Crowley&rsquo;s long red hair and he began to massage at the package inside. His cock began to grow stiff at his touch, and Crowley&rsquo;s own member began to strain against his tight black jeans.</p><p>Aziraphale&rsquo;s own trembling hands began to fumble at the demon&rsquo;s belt, having seen the reaction he was getting. Before he could, Crowley tore down Zi&rsquo;s trousers, underwear and all, and looked admiringly at the sight before him. He dropped to his knees and began to stroke his length, licking at the slit to taste the precum already gathering on his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh dear God.&rdquo; Aziraphale groaned, his hips bucking slightly into the angel&rsquo;s mouth as his grip on his hair tightened.</p><p>&ldquo;Enjoying yourself?&rdquo; Crowley smirked as he began to pump at his erect shaft.</p><p>An annoyed look passed over the angel&rsquo;s face, quickly melting back into pleasure as the demon took his whole length into his mouth and began to speed himself up in time with the thrusting of the Aziraphale&rsquo;s hips.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Christ-&rdquo; he called out brokenly, and Crowley could tell from the crack in his voice that he was close to his climax.</p><p>Crowley withdrew from around the angel and growled. </p><p>&ldquo;Not here, darling. I&rsquo;m not finished with you yet.&rdquo; </p><p>The pair stumbled quickly towards Crowley&rsquo;s bedroom, and Crowley wiggled his way out of his skin tight skinny jeans and underwear, his raging hard-on free at last. He pushed Aziraphale down onto the bed, and licked his lips at the sight of him there, naked and panting.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you want me to do to you, angel?&rdquo; He purred.</p><p>&ldquo;I want you to take me.&rdquo; Whispered Aziraphale breathlessly. </p><p>&ldquo;What was that? You&rsquo;re very quiet. I can hardly hear you.&rdquo; Smirked the demon as his fingers stroked his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;I want you to take me, Crowley!&rdquo; He groaned louder.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought.&rdquo;</p><p>He planted his lips aginst the angel&rsquo;s neck and sucked, his\u00a0kisses and hickies sauntering vaguely downward towards Aziraphale&rsquo;s crotch.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait dear. I need you.&rdquo; Groaned the angel. </p><p>This was more than enough incentive for Crowley. </p><p>He flipped Aziraphale over, grabbing his lube off out of the drawer by the bedside, that had not existed until Crowley had willed it into being a few seconds beforehand.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take you to heaven and back, angel.&rdquo; He moaned, rubbing his entrance and the tip of his own cock with the thick substance.</p><p>&ldquo;Heaven would never let you inside. <i>I</i>, however, will.&rdquo; Aziraphale smirked.</p><p>His smirk was cut off by the sensation of the demon&rsquo;s throbbing member pushing inside his entrance. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh <i>fuck</i>, angel.&rdquo; Crowley let out a guttural groan and he felt Aziraphale&rsquo;s tight walls close around his shaft. He began to move slowly, each stroke causing the both of them to let out small noises of pleasure. He pounded away into the angel, rhythmically fucking him as Aziraphale groaned and moved his hips in time.</p><p>&ldquo;Faster Crowley, Oh God, I need more, and I need it now.&rdquo; The angel gasped.</p><p>Crowley sped up his thrusts, one hand wrapped around the angel&rsquo;s golden hair, and the other against his back to steady himself.</p><p>The demon could feel the familiar tightness in his stomach and pulses of electricity from his cock, and he knew that he wasn&rsquo;t far from his end. He could feel Aziraphale&rsquo;s whole body shaking in pleasure. </p><p>&ldquo;Angel, I&rsquo;m going to cum.&rdquo; Crowley exclaimed, his breath jerky and irregular.</p><p>&ldquo;I- I am too, oh Crowley, dear God-!&rdquo; He whimpered, and he felt the demon give one final deep thrust inside him, his hips bucking violently against his ass. Crowley saw spots dancing on the edge of his vision as he emptied himself into the angel, a final moan of ecstasy escaping his lips.</p><p>The sensation of Crowley&rsquo;s warm cum filling him, and the noise he made, was enough to send Aziraphale over the edge. The angel gasped as he finished all of the bed sheets, Crowley&rsquo;s cock still pounding into his prostate, allowing him to ride out his orgasm. </p><p>The two collapsed next to each other, staring silently at the ceiling as they tried to comprehend what had just happened.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe we waited six thousand years to do that.&rdquo; Aziraphale panted after a few moments of silence.</p><p>&ldquo;It was worth waiting for.&rdquo; Crowley responded, propping himself up with his elbow to look at the angel.</p><p>&ldquo;Round two?&rdquo; He grinned.</p>",

Despite the late hour, he was wearing round, wire rimmed sunglasses. </p><p>[[MORE]]</p><p>The man in black was leaning over the second figure, a small, plump gentleman who appeared to have stepped straight out of the 1950s. His cream shirt - complete with sweater vest - and beige trousers had been rumpled by a night\u2019s festivities, but it was clear that he took great care of himself. More care, in the cabbie\u2019s opinion, than a real man should. </p><p>\u201cYes, you two would like Queen.\u201d He thought, as the pair belted out the final chorus of You\u2019re My Best Friend.</p><p>The tall man suddenly lunged forwards towards the glass divide.</p><p>\u201cDriver! Pull over here! We\u2019ve arrived!\u201d He slurred into the intercom. </p><p>He pulled over outside a glistening new apartment block and gave the price of the fair.</p><p>Crowley reached into his pocket and pulled out two Scottish bank notes. </p><p>\u201cLow grade evil at it\u2019s finest.\u201d He winked at Aziraphale, after the driver had begrudgingly accepted that it was legal tender (though wondering who in their right mind would accept them from him this far south of the border) and sped off, glad to be rid of the two strange men.</p><p>The pair stumbled through the foyer of the apartment block to the lift, and began to accend the fifty or so floors to the pent house suit belonging to Crowley.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve finally accepted my invitation to come round, angel. You despise my apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, quite so,\u201d Spluttered Aziraphale defensively. \u201cbut I don\u2019t suppose I\u2019ll be able to get another taxi at the time of night, so I\u2019m left with no option. I don\u2019t know why we couldn\u2019t have just taken the Bentley.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my night off! I\u2019m not sobering myself up just to drive. Besides, you\u2019re here now.\u201d</p><p>The lift dinged as a robotic female voice announced that they had reached the suite.</p><p>Crowley swaggered into the apartment and made a beeline for the whiskey cabinet. He didn\u2019t notice that Aziraphale\u2019s glass turned mysteriously into red wine as it was handed to him.</p><p>\u201cMy dear, where will I be staying? I\u2019ll just go and put my coat on the bed.\u201d Aziraphale asked as Crowley flopped down on the settee.</p><p>\u201cJust through the door on your right.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s your room, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Do you have any idea how expensive a two bedroom flat is in central London?\u201d Crowley grinned devilishly.</p><p>\u201cSo where will you be sleeping?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIn my room.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale froze.

His cream shirt - complete with sweater vest - and beige trousers had been rumpled by a night\u2019s festivities, but it was clear that he took great care of himself. More care, in the cabbie\u2019s opinion, than a real man should. </p><p>\u201cYes, you two would like Queen.\u201d He thought, as the pair belted out the final chorus of You\u2019re My Best Friend.</p><p>The tall man suddenly lunged forwards towards the glass divide.</p><p>\u201cDriver! Pull over here! We\u2019ve arrived!\u201d He slurred into the intercom. </p><p>He pulled over outside a glistening new apartment block and gave the price of the fair.</p><p>Crowley reached into his pocket and pulled out two Scottish bank notes. </p><p>\u201cLow grade evil at it\u2019s finest.\u201d He winked at Aziraphale, after the driver had begrudgingly accepted that it was legal tender (though wondering who in their right mind would accept them from him this far south of the border) and sped off, glad to be rid of the two strange men.</p><p>The pair stumbled through the foyer of the apartment block to the lift, and began to accend the fifty or so floors to the pent house suit belonging to Crowley.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve finally accepted my invitation to come round, angel. You despise my apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, quite so,\u201d Spluttered Aziraphale defensively. \u201cbut I don\u2019t suppose I\u2019ll be able to get another taxi at the time of night, so I\u2019m left with no option. I don\u2019t know why we couldn\u2019t have just taken the Bentley.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my night off! I\u2019m not sobering myself up just to drive. Besides, you\u2019re here now.\u201d</p><p>The lift dinged as a robotic female voice announced that they had reached the suite.</p><p>Crowley swaggered into the apartment and made a beeline for the whiskey cabinet. He didn\u2019t notice that Aziraphale\u2019s glass turned mysteriously into red wine as it was handed to him.</p><p>\u201cMy dear, where will I be staying? I\u2019ll just go and put my coat on the bed.\u201d Aziraphale asked as Crowley flopped down on the settee.</p><p>\u201cJust through the door on your right.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s your room, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Do you have any idea how expensive a two bedroom flat is in central London?\u201d Crowley grinned devilishly.</p><p>\u201cSo where will you be sleeping?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIn my room.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale froze. What the devil was he playing at?</p><p>\u201cIf this is a joke, I don\u2019t find it very funny, dear.\u201d</p><p>Crowley stood up and slowly walked towards him. He towered over his small frame, and bent over to lean in close to his ear. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no joke, angel.\u201d He whispered, his breath warm on Aziraphale\u2019s neck. The angel broke into a hot sweat.</p><p>\u201cReally, Crowley, you mustn\u2019t - you know how it is! We\u2019re on different sides! We couldn\u2019t\u2026I couldn\u2019t possibly -\u201d he stuttered, his mind racing for an excuse. </p><p>Six thousand years. Six thousand years of being together - of arguing, of laughing, of drinking, of working. Deep conversations in quiet restaurants at midnight. Lightly brushing against each other by accident, hoping the other wouldn\u2019t notice or react. Six thousand years of stealing secret\u00a0glances at each other when they thought no one was looking. Six thousands years of pining. Of yearning. Of craving.</p><p>And now that this moment had come, the angel was completely and utterly overwhelmed.</p><p>Though his countenance didn\u2019t show it, Crowley, too, was terrified. He hasn\u2019t planned to come on this strong. Hell, he hasn\u2019t planned to come on at all. His original thought was that he would just sleep on the chaise-lounge and let Aziraphale take his bedroom. But for the past week, Crowley had been troubled. Though demons didn\u2019t need to sleep, Crowley had always been one for getting his head down where and when he felt like it. But each night for the past week, the demon had laid awake in his empty king sized bed, crushing loneliness weighing down on his chest. He couldn\u2019t get the angel\u2019s face out of his mind, and he knew he had to do something about it. It was ridiculous- the two had spent millennia playing the world\u2019s most homoerotic game of metaphorical chess to prove to each other that there was nothing between them. </p><p>But there was.</p><p>Oh <strike>god</strike> <i>Hell</i>, there was.</p><p>The two stood there in silence of a few moments, a stand off to see who would act first. Aziraphale could see his own frightened face reflected in Crowley\u2019s sunglasses.</p><p>Without thinking, the angel furrowed his brow, grabbed the demon\u2019s glasses, and threw them across the room.</p><p>Crowley raised one perfectly sculpted eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cMy, <i>my</i> angel. Is that a ye-\u201d he was cut off by Aziraphale pushing his lips into Crowley\u2019s, in an act that surpised him almost as much as it did Aziraphale. </p><p>\u201c<i>Finally</i>.\u201d The demon mumbled against his lips as they staggered backwards towards the wall. </p><p>Crowley pinned him against the wall, using one hand to keep him there and the other to feel at his chest. The kiss deepened, tongues exchanged, and Crowley\u2019s hand began to reach for Aziraphale\u2019s shirt buttons.</p><p>The angel whimpered.</p><p>Crowley backed off slightly, breaking the kiss between them. </p><p>\u201cAngel, are you sure you want to go through with this?\u201d He said gently, genuine concern in his serpentine eyes.</p><p>Aziraphale took a deep breath, gathered himself, and looked up from the floor.</p><p>\u201cDearest, I want you to fuck me.\u201d</p><p>Crowley almost let out an audible gasp at the statement. </p><p>He\u2019d never heard Aziraphale say fuck before. </p><p>But he wasn\u2019t going to say no.</p><p>The intensity in the air grew as Crowley ripped the angel\u2019s shirt off, buttons flying in all directions. He knew that he\u2019s be able to fix them in the morning if he willed it so.</p><p>Crowley\u2019s tongue traced the outline of Aziraphale\u2019s neck, sucking on his tender spots, and the angel let out a small moan of pleasure. The noise lit a fire inside Crowley.</p><p>He flung off his own shirt and began quickly unbuckling Aziraphale\u2019s trousers, slipping one hand inside his perfectly laundered underwear.</p><p>The angel\u2019s fingers knotted themselves into Crowley\u2019s long red hair and he began to massage at the package inside. His cock began to grow stiff at his touch, and Crowley\u2019s own member began to strain against his tight black jeans.</p><p>Aziraphale\u2019s own trembling hands began to fumble at the demon\u2019s belt, having seen the reaction he was getting. Before he could, Crowley tore down Zi\u2019s trousers, underwear and all, and looked admiringly at the sight before him. He dropped to his knees and began to stroke his length, licking at the slit to taste the precum already gathering on his head.</p><p>\u201cOh dear God.\u201d Aziraphale groaned, his hips bucking slightly into the angel\u2019s mouth as his grip on his hair tightened.</p><p>\u201cEnjoying yourself?\u201d Crowley smirked as he began to pump at his erect shaft.</p><p>An annoyed look passed over the angel\u2019s face, quickly melting back into pleasure as the demon took his whole length into his mouth and began to speed himself up in time with the thrusting of the Aziraphale\u2019s hips.</p><p>\u201cOh, Christ-\u201d he called out brokenly, and Crowley could tell from the crack in his voice that he was close to his climax.</p><p>Crowley withdrew from around the angel and growled. </p><p>\u201cNot here, darling. I\u2019m not finished with you yet.\u201d </p><p>The pair stumbled quickly towards Crowley\u2019s bedroom, and Crowley wiggled his way out of his skin tight skinny jeans and underwear, his raging hard-on free at last. He pushed Aziraphale down onto the bed, and licked his lips at the sight of him there, naked and panting.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do to you, angel?\u201d He purred.</p><p>\u201cI want you to take me.\u201d Whispered Aziraphale breathlessly. </p><p>\u201cWhat was that? You\u2019re very quiet. I can hardly hear you.\u201d Smirked the demon as his fingers stroked his chest.</p><p>\u201cI want you to take me, Crowley!\u201d He groaned louder.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p><p>He planted his lips aginst the angel\u2019s neck and sucked, his\u00a0kisses and hickies sauntering vaguely downward towards Aziraphale\u2019s crotch.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait dear. I need you.\u201d Groaned the angel. </p><p>This was more than enough incentive for Crowley. </p><p>He flipped Aziraphale over, grabbing his lube off out of the drawer by the bedside, that had not existed until Crowley had willed it into being a few seconds beforehand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take you to heaven and back, angel.\u201d He moaned, rubbing his entrance and the tip of his own cock with the thick substance.</p><p>\u201cHeaven would never let you inside. <i>I</i>, however, will.\u201d Aziraphale smirked.</p><p>His smirk was cut off by the sensation of the demon\u2019s throbbing member pushing inside his entrance. </p><p>\u201cOh <i>fuck</i>, angel.\u201d Crowley let out a guttural groan and he felt Aziraphale\u2019s tight walls close around his shaft. He began to move slowly, each stroke causing the both of them to let out small noises of pleasure. He pounded away into the angel, rhythmically fucking him as Aziraphale groaned and moved his hips in time.</p><p>\u201cFaster Crowley, Oh God, I need more, and I need it now.\u201d The angel gasped.</p><p>Crowley sped up his thrusts, one hand wrapped around the angel\u2019s golden hair, and the other against his back to steady himself.</p><p>The demon could feel the familiar tightness in his stomach and pulses of electricity from his cock, and he knew that he wasn\u2019t far from his end. He could feel Aziraphale\u2019s whole body shaking in pleasure. </p><p>\u201cAngel, I\u2019m going to cum.\u201d Crowley exclaimed, his breath jerky and irregular.</p><p>\u201cI- I am too, oh Crowley, dear God-!\u201d He whimpered, and he felt the demon give one final deep thrust inside him, his hips bucking violently against his ass. Crowley saw spots dancing on the edge of his vision as he emptied himself into the angel, a final moan of ecstasy escaping his lips.</p><p>The sensation of Crowley\u2019s warm cum filling him, and the noise he made, was enough to send Aziraphale over the edge. The angel gasped as he finished all of the bed sheets, Crowley\u2019s cock still pounding into his prostate, allowing him to ride out his orgasm. </p><p>The two collapsed next to each other, staring silently at the ceiling as they tried to comprehend what had just happened.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we waited six thousand years to do that.\u201d Aziraphale panted after a few moments of silence.</p><p>\u201cIt was worth waiting for.\u201d Crowley responded, propping himself up with his elbow to look at the angel.</p><p>\u201cRound two?\u201d He grinned.</p>",
