The uneven ground held sharp rocks\nbeneath the thin grass and dank moss and the mist was thick enough that Tony\ncould feel it, wet and bitingly fresh in his chest when he breathed. He\nshuddered and staggered on. He didn\u2019t know where he was going and only\ndesperation made him so reckless, forcing him forwards.</p><p>Time didn\u2019t seem to pass in any\nway bar a growing fatigue in his limbs; the landscape didn\u2019t change and the\nintensity of the bleary, milky sun stayed the same.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he muttered. \u201cWhere\nthe hell are you?\u201d <i>This is ridiculous</i>,\nhe thought angrily, but he pressed on and he didn\u2019t voice his doubts. Up here\nit was harder to be scornful, what with the way the mist lay like a veil,\nseeming as if anything at all might emerge from it.</p><p>The witch would only be found if\nhe wanted to be, Tony had been told. All his life, he\u2019d sneered and derided\ntheir superstitions as they tied red ribbons to their doorknobs on Midsummer\u2019s\nand turned their coats inside out when herons passed overhead. But he was\ndesperate and, loathe as he was to admit it, he had to acknowledge that he had\nseen people go up onto these moors fraught with sickness and return cured.\nThere <i>had</i> to be an explanation, there\nhad to be some way he could help Pepper.</p><p>He kept stumbling onwards, his\neyes on the ground in front of his feet, the mist seeming to be closing on him,\nbut he tried to tell himself that it was only his paranoia. A sudden jut of\ngrey rock caught his tired foot and Tony tripped forwards with a sharp cry,\nreaching out his hands, but they touched wet grass only to lose grip on it as\nhe slid sideways and went into freefall with a shocked shout.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t have been long but it\nfelt like he hung in the icy, rushing air for several seconds before the ground\nslammed into him and all the air was knocked out him as surely as if he\u2019d been\nstruck in the stomach with a walking cane.</p><p>His chest feeling crushed, Tony\ngrunted as he tried first to drag cold air into his lungs and then move. Lying\non his stomach, he saw the fingers of his right hand twitch in front of his\nface and he tried to lift himself, to roll over, only to cry out as pain lanced\nall across his chest and down his left arm. There was a throbbing in his head,\ntoo, and a feeling of wetness. Tony lay there, his head turned to the side, and\nchoked back the pain as he tried to pull himself together.</p><p>Closing his eyes in frustration\nand something like the beginnings of despair, he opened them a moment later and\nrecoiled in shock, only to grit his teeth against the wave of pain the slight\nmovement elicited.</p><p>A man was stood in front of him,\nonly his legs in Tony\u2019s line of sight where he was lying on his stomach, but Tony\nrolled his eyes upwards and found the man to be tall, his skin pale as the mist\nand his hands folded behind his back. He looked down at Tony with a slight,\ndispassionate frown. His figure seemed to shimmer in the mist and Tony couldn\u2019t\ntell whether his eyes were deceiving him.</p><p>\u201cWh-where did you come from?\u201d\nTony managed, strained. Speaking worsened the pain in his chest and he felt\nlike there was something beneath his sternum, sticking into him.</p><!-- more --><p>The man smiled slightly, his hair\ndark like a raven\u2019s but for a sliver of silver, not like that of old-age but\nlike thick strands of metal growing directly from the man\u2019s scalp.</p><p>\u201cHere and there,\u201d the man said in\na smooth, pleasant voice, smiling agelessly. \u201cThe more important question is\nhow you came to be bleeding on my heath.\u201d</p><p>Tony blinked and tried to drag his\nthoughts through the haze of pain in his head. Flexing his right hand against\nthe wet moss, he clenched his jaw and dragged himself up to seated with a\nrepressed gasp of pain. The man stood silently, watching, much as a bird prey\nperches on a ledge and studies the landscape.</p><p>\u201cI,\u201d Tony started stiffly as he\npressed a cold hand to his chest and it came away bloody. There was a sharp\nrock sticking out of the ground where he\u2019d fallen and it had stabbed him\nshallowly in the chest, and bruised him all across his ribs where it hadn\u2019t\nbroken skin. Each breath hurt but he made himself focus on the pale man. \u201cAre\nyou the witch?\u201d he asked. The man didn\u2019t look mortal, that was certain, and the\nlonger Tony looked at him, the more he wanted to look away. </p><p>The man tilted his head and\nraised his hands in an elegant gesture. \u201cI am Loki, neither <i>witch</i> by your crude meaning, nor mortal.\u201d</p><p>Tony clenched his jaw. \u201cI need to help my sister,\u201d he said.</p><p> \u201cYou will need a little more faith and a\nlittle less doubt if you\u2019re to reach your goal,\u201d the man, <i>Loki</i>, said cryptically and Tony had to bite back a sharp answer.\nBut Loki was right; Tony\u2019s head was scrambling to find an explanation for Loki\u2019s\nsudden appearance, for the way he didn\u2019t seem quite solid, for the glinting,\nheavy silver in his hair. The Loki smiled like he knew what Tony was thinking,\nand maybe he <i>did</i> know, Tony thought,\nthoroughly unnerved.</p><p>Loki made a small motion past\nTony, pointing with a long finger. \u201cMake your way lightly down into the\nhollow,\u201d he said, \u201cand watch where you place your feet. Do not eat anything; it\nis not what it seems. Don\u2019t take too long. The dark is not your friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat-\u201d Tony started, but Loki\nwas not there and Tony blinked, swallowing, \u201cwill I find?\u201d he finished softly,\nto himself. He hadn\u2019t seen nor heard Loki go; he had simply been there and then\nhe had not. <i>Damnation</i>, he thought as\na shiver crawled up his spine like an insect. </p><p>It took a few minutes but Tony\nforced himself first fully up to seated and then, hissing under his breath as\npain sparked through him, hot and distracting, he came dizzily to his feet. His\nankle complained beneath him but it wasn\u2019t sprained and held his weight well\nenough. His left arm felt achingly bruised but his chest throbbed something\nawful and, when he touched the back of his head, his fingers came away sticky\nwith blood.</p><p>He blinked as he steadied himself\nand then, very slowly, he put one foot forwards, and then another, in the\ndirection the strange, ethereal man had told him to. The mist seemed less\noppressive, revealing more of his way before him, and it lifted further as he\nmoved down a steady incline. The rough moorland grass turned to a strikingly\nlush green and Tony stepped on it with a sense of foreboding, but continued\nforwards. </p><p>He stopped when a perfectly\ncircular cluster of buttercups appeared amongst the grass, glowing a lustrous\nyellow, and, gingerly, he moved carefully around them before carrying on. Dark\nshapes seemed to move beyond the folds of the mist, some of which looked like\ndeer and others that had black eyes and were too tall to be human. Tony\nremembered his mother telling him as a child not to look too hard out of the\nwinter at night lest he offend <i>something</i>\nwith his staring, and he looked quickly away from the ill-defined figures in\nthe mist, directing his gaze at the soft grass instead as he hurried onwards. </p><p>Small bushes and shrubs began to\nappear, and not the harsh scratch of unflowering heather that had been up on\nthe moor, but rich spreads of flora that Tony couldn\u2019t identify, even though\nhe\u2019d lived just off the moor for all of his life. But this place didn\u2019t feel\nlocal or even earthly and Tony felt his unease grow apace with his belief that\nthe stories were <i>true</i>, and the vision\nhe\u2019d seen had really been that of the witch that was supposed to reside here.</p><p>Berries that shouldn\u2019t have been\nthere in November hung in abundance, looking full and exactly like bilberries\nand wild strawberries, except that they were too perfect, too universally the\nsame, and, parched and exhausted as he was, Tony didn\u2019t touch them. </p><p>A faint rustling up ahead made\nhim slow his staggering step and, emotionally and physically drained, he looked\nwarily at a rose bush that bloomed with perfect, red flowers but had thorns\nlonger than Tony\u2019s thumbnail. Tony kept walking, looking sideways at the roses,\nbut he stopped when he saw that it was a small, rangy hare with ragged, bloody\nfur and black eyes that was making the rose plant rustle with its struggling.\nIts back foot was crushed in an evil-looking metal trap and Tony looked away\ndown the hollow, towards where he might, just might, get the cure for Pepper,\nand then back to the hare. </p><p>The light was fading steadily\nfrom the cloudy sky and Loki had said to hurry, but Tony couldn\u2019t leave the\npoor creature in good faith and, wincing and gritting his teeth, he crouched\ndown in front of it. The hare stilled, its skinny sides heaving in panic and\npain, and Tony eyed the trap, which was half-embedded in amongst the rose\nthorns. Tony looked again at the sky, which seemed to be getting dimmer by the\nsecond, and thought, <i>in for a penny, in\nfor a pound</i>.</p><p>He pushed his hand in amongst the\nthorns, releasing a bitten-off cry of pain at the sharp jabs of the thorns, like\nhalf-a-dozen needles. He fumbled at the trap and managed, finally, to free the\nspring, even as the thorns cut his hand to a gouged mess by the time he took\nhold of the hare\u2019s bloody leg and, gently as he could manage, freed it.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he urged, only for the\ncreature to snap around to bite him on the hand. He yelped in shock more than\npain and snatched his hand in close as the hare bounded away. It stopped a few\npaces away in a very un-hare-like manner and turned back to look at him with\nthose black eyes and Tony stared at it as he held his hand to his aching chest.\nThen the hare was gone and Tony went tiredly onwards, staring at the spot where\nthe hare had stopped to look at him and wondering at the lack of blood, even\nthough he had felt it, tacky and warm, under his fingers as he\u2019d freed the\nanimal.</p><p>A minute or so later, a low,\nstone dwelling came into view and he approached it with a mixture of relief and\ntrepidation. </p><p>There was a dark red cloth\nhanging where there ought to have been a door and this was swept aside as Tony\ncame to stand in front of it.</p><p>\u201cDo you wish to come in?\u201d Loki\nasked with a slight, ironic tilt to his pale lips, with silver shifting amongst\nhis dark hair.</p><p>Too tired for any sort of retort,\nTony just nodded. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. </p><p>Loki nodded. \u201cThen do so,\u201d he\nsaid, and disappeared back inside, leaving the cloth rippling in his wake.</p><p>Tony came wearily inside and sat\ndown in a chair the man indicated without even looking around, but when he did,\nhe blinked in shock. The entirety of the ceiling was covered in shells of all\nshapes and colours and none like Tony had ever found on a beach, all of them\nmeticulously arranged in marvellous patterns and assortments, like\nconstellations.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2026we are so far from the sea,\u201d\nTony said, staring.</p><p>Loki laughed quietly. A cup of\ntea came into Loki\u2019s hands without Tony seeing him make it and Tony accepted it\nwhen it was guided into his cold, bloody hands. </p><p>\u201cStrange,\u201d Loki said. \u201cI find\nthem all about the place.\u201d Tony turned to blink at him as he clasped the warm\ntea-cup without drinking it. He looked down at the dark-green tea for a moment.</p><p>\u201cCan you help me?\u201d he asked\nquietly.</p><p>\u201cI hear you met Narfi,\u201d Loki\nsaid, disregarding Tony\u2019s question, and pointed elegantly to where a hare was\nslipping under the heavy red cloth at the doorway. The same hare, Tony was\nsure, that he had freed from the trap, except that this one was entirely\nunharmed and looked sleek with health. \u201cHe is quite pleased with you,\u201d Loki\nsaid.</p><p>Tony nodded blankly before\nputting the tea firmly down on a stout table and gripping the armrest of his\nchair, grounding himself in the sting of the cuts on his palm. \u201cI need to know\nif you can help my sister,\u201d he said.</p><p>Loki looked at him with the same,\nslight smile, but didn\u2019t bypass Tony\u2019s question this time. \u201cI can,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut what can you help <i>me</i> with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need help with?\u201d\nTony said slowly. He felt too tired to be negotiating with a witch, but as long\nas he got a cure for Pepper out of the deal, he didn\u2019t think he cared if Loki\nbested him somehow.</p><p>\u201cMm,\u201d Loki said and brushed his\nshoulder-length black hair from his forehead. He looked at Tony like a\nthoughtful cat considering how best to climb a wall. \u201cPerhaps you might be\nuseful.\u201d He beckoned Tony with his hand and Tony reluctantly stood up and came\ntowards him, although that same sense of unease he got when he looked at Loki\nfor too long intensified the closer Tony came. </p><p>When Tony was in touching\ndistance, Loki hummed, looking at the blood on Tony\u2019s chest like it was edible.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Loki muttered and\nTony frowned nervously. \u201cGive me your permission and I shall brew your sister\u2019s\ncure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy permission to do\u2026what?\u201d Tony\nsaid. Loki raised his eyebrows silently and Tony took a wary step backwards, or\nat least he meant to, but he found abruptly that he couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cNow, don\u2019t flee, little mortal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to be able to give her\nthe cure,\u201d Tony hissed, fighting the invisible constraints on him but failing\nto shift them. \u201cIf you kill me, I cannot give it to her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cClever,\u201d Loki said. \u201cBut I have\nno intention of stopping you giving it to her,\u201d he said and Tony stilled, eying\nhim guardedly. \u201cYou shall return to her in full health of body and mind to give\nher her cure. You\u2019ll have a period of time to close off your affairs and\nthen\u2026you shall return to me as my familiar-spirit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour familiar?\u201d Tony echoed.\nThere was no smile on Loki\u2019s face now and Tony found himself unable to look on\nhim but dropped his eyes quickly. Loki\u2019s bargain was not weighted in Tony\u2019s\nfavour but it would give his sister her life and so he nodded silently,\nexhausted by all that had occurred. \u201cI give my permission,\u201d he said reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d Loki said and Tony\ntook a deep breath as the bounds around him dropped away, but he wasn\u2019t given a\nmoment before Loki spread his fingers and pressed his hand firmly to the raw\nwound on Tony\u2019s chest, making him cry out. He instinctively cringed away, but\nagain, Loki somehow bound him there and Tony could only groan and struggle\nweakly as pain shot through his chest- and then it was gone and Loki took his\nhand away and smiled.</p><p>Tony shuddered and took several\ndeep breaths, taking a step and then another away from Loki, because it was so\nintense, so disorienting being so close to him. He felt immensely better and he\nlooked down in shock at his unbloodied hands and touched his head to find it\nnot only healed but with no evidence of it ever being injured. </p><p>He yelped in shock when he saw a\nblue glow and realised it was<i> coming from\nhim</i>. he scrabbled at his shirt to look down at himself and found that where\nthere had been the wound there was now a glowing circle in the centre of his\nchest and it pulsed like a firefly\u2019s light, except that it was <i>blue</i>, and embedded in his flesh.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d he gasped but\nLoki wasn\u2019t even looking at him, but had crouched to stroke the ears of the\nhare, Narfi.</p><p>\u201cAs I said I would,\u201d Loki said\nsimply and Tony grit his teeth against the absolute panic and forced himself to\nbreathe through it.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he managed. \u201cCan I have\nthe cure?\u201d</p><p>Loki stood gracefully with a\nsigh. \u201cMortals are always so hasty,\u201d he said, but he moved towards what looked\nto a workstation of a kind, with a stretch of honeyed wood cluttered with\nvarious things that Tony couldn\u2019t fathom the use of. \u201cIt is what makes you both\nso curious and so frustrating.\u201d</p><p>Loki began to pick out various\nitems as he spoke and Tony watched silently.</p><p>\u201cTell me of this sister of\nyours,\u201d Loki said, with his broad-shouldered back to Tony, his simple and yet\nstrange black and green outfit shining very slightly with a light that\nshouldn\u2019t have been there inside a windowless stone house. \u201cWhat colour ribbons\ndoes she like to wear, and what do her nightmares consist of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy could you possibly need to\nknow that?\u201d Tony said, baffled and shaken by whatever Loki had done.</p><p>Loki was silent but Tony felt the\ntemperature physically drop and his skin prickled. \u201cAlright,\u201d he breathed, his\nheart pounding, and quickly answered Loki\u2019s questions, and all of his\nsubsequent ones, as best as he was able.</p><p>\u201cMm and what kind of a red is her\nhair?\u201d</p><p>An odd smell had arisen from\nwhatever it was Loki was making using a mixture of physical items and movements\nof his hands, which seemed to fade into a pale blue like the glowing circle in\nTony\u2019s chest. The odour, of something burning, was making Tony dizzy.</p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d he struggled to bring\nPepper\u2019s hair to mind. \u201cNo, more- a soft orange, like- like- leaves in autumn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Loki muttered,\ncupping a faintly green thing in his hands. \u201cThe essence of her\u2026of Pepper\u2026is\nquite sweet, is it not. But with a steel backbone.\u201d Loki hummed, sounding\npleased and Tony frowned as he tried to recall whether he\u2019d told Loki Pepper\u2019s\nname but he was certain he hadn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t question it but just watched\nsilently as Loki transferred the green object into a leather bag.</p><p>\u201cIt is done,\u201d he said. \u201cShe will\nrecover herself.

His figure seemed to shimmer in the mist and Tony couldn\u2019t\ntell whether his eyes were deceiving him.</p><p>\u201cWh-where did you come from?\u201d\nTony managed, strained. Speaking worsened the pain in his chest and he felt\nlike there was something beneath his sternum, sticking into him.</p>[[MORE]]<p>The man smiled slightly, his hair\ndark like a raven\u2019s but for a sliver of silver, not like that of old-age but\nlike thick strands of metal growing directly from the man\u2019s scalp.</p><p>\u201cHere and there,\u201d the man said in\na smooth, pleasant voice, smiling agelessly. \u201cThe more important question is\nhow you came to be bleeding on my heath.\u201d</p><p>Tony blinked and tried to drag his\nthoughts through the haze of pain in his head. Flexing his right hand against\nthe wet moss, he clenched his jaw and dragged himself up to seated with a\nrepressed gasp of pain. The man stood silently, watching, much as a bird prey\nperches on a ledge and studies the landscape.</p><p>\u201cI,\u201d Tony started stiffly as he\npressed a cold hand to his chest and it came away bloody. There was a sharp\nrock sticking out of the ground where he\u2019d fallen and it had stabbed him\nshallowly in the chest, and bruised him all across his ribs where it hadn\u2019t\nbroken skin. Each breath hurt but he made himself focus on the pale man. \u201cAre\nyou the witch?\u201d he asked. The man didn\u2019t look mortal, that was certain, and the\nlonger Tony looked at him, the more he wanted to look away. </p><p>The man tilted his head and\nraised his hands in an elegant gesture. \u201cI am Loki, neither <i>witch</i> by your crude meaning, nor mortal.\u201d</p><p>Tony clenched his jaw. \u201cI need to help my sister,\u201d he said.</p><p> \u201cYou will need a little more faith and a\nlittle less doubt if you\u2019re to reach your goal,\u201d the man, <i>Loki</i>, said cryptically and Tony had to bite back a sharp answer.\nBut Loki was right; Tony\u2019s head was scrambling to find an explanation for Loki\u2019s\nsudden appearance, for the way he didn\u2019t seem quite solid, for the glinting,\nheavy silver in his hair. The Loki smiled like he knew what Tony was thinking,\nand maybe he <i>did</i> know, Tony thought,\nthoroughly unnerved.</p><p>Loki made a small motion past\nTony, pointing with a long finger. \u201cMake your way lightly down into the\nhollow,\u201d he said, \u201cand watch where you place your feet. Do not eat anything; it\nis not what it seems. Don\u2019t take too long. The dark is not your friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat-\u201d Tony started, but Loki\nwas not there and Tony blinked, swallowing, \u201cwill I find?\u201d he finished softly,\nto himself. He hadn\u2019t seen nor heard Loki go; he had simply been there and then\nhe had not. <i>Damnation</i>, he thought as\na shiver crawled up his spine like an insect. </p><p>It took a few minutes but Tony\nforced himself first fully up to seated and then, hissing under his breath as\npain sparked through him, hot and distracting, he came dizzily to his feet. His\nankle complained beneath him but it wasn\u2019t sprained and held his weight well\nenough. His left arm felt achingly bruised but his chest throbbed something\nawful and, when he touched the back of his head, his fingers came away sticky\nwith blood.</p><p>He blinked as he steadied himself\nand then, very slowly, he put one foot forwards, and then another, in the\ndirection the strange, ethereal man had told him to. The mist seemed less\noppressive, revealing more of his way before him, and it lifted further as he\nmoved down a steady incline. The rough moorland grass turned to a strikingly\nlush green and Tony stepped on it with a sense of foreboding, but continued\nforwards. </p><p>He stopped when a perfectly\ncircular cluster of buttercups appeared amongst the grass, glowing a lustrous\nyellow, and, gingerly, he moved carefully around them before carrying on. Dark\nshapes seemed to move beyond the folds of the mist, some of which looked like\ndeer and others that had black eyes and were too tall to be human. Tony\nremembered his mother telling him as a child not to look too hard out of the\nwinter at night lest he offend <i>something</i>\nwith his staring, and he looked quickly away from the ill-defined figures in\nthe mist, directing his gaze at the soft grass instead as he hurried onwards. </p><p>Small bushes and shrubs began to\nappear, and not the harsh scratch of unflowering heather that had been up on\nthe moor, but rich spreads of flora that Tony couldn\u2019t identify, even though\nhe\u2019d lived just off the moor for all of his life. But this place didn\u2019t feel\nlocal or even earthly and Tony felt his unease grow apace with his belief that\nthe stories were <i>true</i>, and the vision\nhe\u2019d seen had really been that of the witch that was supposed to reside here.</p><p>Berries that shouldn\u2019t have been\nthere in November hung in abundance, looking full and exactly like bilberries\nand wild strawberries, except that they were too perfect, too universally the\nsame, and, parched and exhausted as he was, Tony didn\u2019t touch them. </p><p>A faint rustling up ahead made\nhim slow his staggering step and, emotionally and physically drained, he looked\nwarily at a rose bush that bloomed with perfect, red flowers but had thorns\nlonger than Tony\u2019s thumbnail. Tony kept walking, looking sideways at the roses,\nbut he stopped when he saw that it was a small, rangy hare with ragged, bloody\nfur and black eyes that was making the rose plant rustle with its struggling.\nIts back foot was crushed in an evil-looking metal trap and Tony looked away\ndown the hollow, towards where he might, just might, get the cure for Pepper,\nand then back to the hare. </p><p>The light was fading steadily\nfrom the cloudy sky and Loki had said to hurry, but Tony couldn\u2019t leave the\npoor creature in good faith and, wincing and gritting his teeth, he crouched\ndown in front of it. The hare stilled, its skinny sides heaving in panic and\npain, and Tony eyed the trap, which was half-embedded in amongst the rose\nthorns. Tony looked again at the sky, which seemed to be getting dimmer by the\nsecond, and thought, <i>in for a penny, in\nfor a pound</i>.</p><p>He pushed his hand in amongst the\nthorns, releasing a bitten-off cry of pain at the sharp jabs of the thorns, like\nhalf-a-dozen needles. He fumbled at the trap and managed, finally, to free the\nspring, even as the thorns cut his hand to a gouged mess by the time he took\nhold of the hare\u2019s bloody leg and, gently as he could manage, freed it.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he urged, only for the\ncreature to snap around to bite him on the hand. He yelped in shock more than\npain and snatched his hand in close as the hare bounded away. It stopped a few\npaces away in a very un-hare-like manner and turned back to look at him with\nthose black eyes and Tony stared at it as he held his hand to his aching chest.\nThen the hare was gone and Tony went tiredly onwards, staring at the spot where\nthe hare had stopped to look at him and wondering at the lack of blood, even\nthough he had felt it, tacky and warm, under his fingers as he\u2019d freed the\nanimal.</p><p>A minute or so later, a low,\nstone dwelling came into view and he approached it with a mixture of relief and\ntrepidation. </p><p>There was a dark red cloth\nhanging where there ought to have been a door and this was swept aside as Tony\ncame to stand in front of it.</p><p>\u201cDo you wish to come in?\u201d Loki\nasked with a slight, ironic tilt to his pale lips, with silver shifting amongst\nhis dark hair.</p><p>Too tired for any sort of retort,\nTony just nodded. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. </p><p>Loki nodded. \u201cThen do so,\u201d he\nsaid, and disappeared back inside, leaving the cloth rippling in his wake.</p><p>Tony came wearily inside and sat\ndown in a chair the man indicated without even looking around, but when he did,\nhe blinked in shock. The entirety of the ceiling was covered in shells of all\nshapes and colours and none like Tony had ever found on a beach, all of them\nmeticulously arranged in marvellous patterns and assortments, like\nconstellations.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2026we are so far from the sea,\u201d\nTony said, staring.</p><p>Loki laughed quietly. A cup of\ntea came into Loki\u2019s hands without Tony seeing him make it and Tony accepted it\nwhen it was guided into his cold, bloody hands. </p><p>\u201cStrange,\u201d Loki said. \u201cI find\nthem all about the place.\u201d Tony turned to blink at him as he clasped the warm\ntea-cup without drinking it. He looked down at the dark-green tea for a moment.</p><p>\u201cCan you help me?\u201d he asked\nquietly.</p><p>\u201cI hear you met Narfi,\u201d Loki\nsaid, disregarding Tony\u2019s question, and pointed elegantly to where a hare was\nslipping under the heavy red cloth at the doorway. The same hare, Tony was\nsure, that he had freed from the trap, except that this one was entirely\nunharmed and looked sleek with health. \u201cHe is quite pleased with you,\u201d Loki\nsaid.</p><p>Tony nodded blankly before\nputting the tea firmly down on a stout table and gripping the armrest of his\nchair, grounding himself in the sting of the cuts on his palm. \u201cI need to know\nif you can help my sister,\u201d he said.</p><p>Loki looked at him with the same,\nslight smile, but didn\u2019t bypass Tony\u2019s question this time. \u201cI can,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut what can you help <i>me</i> with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need help with?\u201d\nTony said slowly. He felt too tired to be negotiating with a witch, but as long\nas he got a cure for Pepper out of the deal, he didn\u2019t think he cared if Loki\nbested him somehow.</p><p>\u201cMm,\u201d Loki said and brushed his\nshoulder-length black hair from his forehead. He looked at Tony like a\nthoughtful cat considering how best to climb a wall. \u201cPerhaps you might be\nuseful.\u201d He beckoned Tony with his hand and Tony reluctantly stood up and came\ntowards him, although that same sense of unease he got when he looked at Loki\nfor too long intensified the closer Tony came. </p><p>When Tony was in touching\ndistance, Loki hummed, looking at the blood on Tony\u2019s chest like it was edible.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Loki muttered and\nTony frowned nervously. \u201cGive me your permission and I shall brew your sister\u2019s\ncure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy permission to do\u2026what?\u201d Tony\nsaid. Loki raised his eyebrows silently and Tony took a wary step backwards, or\nat least he meant to, but he found abruptly that he couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cNow, don\u2019t flee, little mortal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to be able to give her\nthe cure,\u201d Tony hissed, fighting the invisible constraints on him but failing\nto shift them. \u201cIf you kill me, I cannot give it to her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cClever,\u201d Loki said. \u201cBut I have\nno intention of stopping you giving it to her,\u201d he said and Tony stilled, eying\nhim guardedly. \u201cYou shall return to her in full health of body and mind to give\nher her cure. You\u2019ll have a period of time to close off your affairs and\nthen\u2026you shall return to me as my familiar-spirit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour familiar?\u201d Tony echoed.\nThere was no smile on Loki\u2019s face now and Tony found himself unable to look on\nhim but dropped his eyes quickly. Loki\u2019s bargain was not weighted in Tony\u2019s\nfavour but it would give his sister her life and so he nodded silently,\nexhausted by all that had occurred. \u201cI give my permission,\u201d he said reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d Loki said and Tony\ntook a deep breath as the bounds around him dropped away, but he wasn\u2019t given a\nmoment before Loki spread his fingers and pressed his hand firmly to the raw\nwound on Tony\u2019s chest, making him cry out. He instinctively cringed away, but\nagain, Loki somehow bound him there and Tony could only groan and struggle\nweakly as pain shot through his chest- and then it was gone and Loki took his\nhand away and smiled.</p><p>Tony shuddered and took several\ndeep breaths, taking a step and then another away from Loki, because it was so\nintense, so disorienting being so close to him. He felt immensely better and he\nlooked down in shock at his unbloodied hands and touched his head to find it\nnot only healed but with no evidence of it ever being injured. </p><p>He yelped in shock when he saw a\nblue glow and realised it was<i> coming from\nhim</i>. he scrabbled at his shirt to look down at himself and found that where\nthere had been the wound there was now a glowing circle in the centre of his\nchest and it pulsed like a firefly\u2019s light, except that it was <i>blue</i>, and embedded in his flesh.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d he gasped but\nLoki wasn\u2019t even looking at him, but had crouched to stroke the ears of the\nhare, Narfi.</p><p>\u201cAs I said I would,\u201d Loki said\nsimply and Tony grit his teeth against the absolute panic and forced himself to\nbreathe through it.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he managed. \u201cCan I have\nthe cure?\u201d</p><p>Loki stood gracefully with a\nsigh. \u201cMortals are always so hasty,\u201d he said, but he moved towards what looked\nto a workstation of a kind, with a stretch of honeyed wood cluttered with\nvarious things that Tony couldn\u2019t fathom the use of. \u201cIt is what makes you both\nso curious and so frustrating.\u201d</p><p>Loki began to pick out various\nitems as he spoke and Tony watched silently.</p><p>\u201cTell me of this sister of\nyours,\u201d Loki said, with his broad-shouldered back to Tony, his simple and yet\nstrange black and green outfit shining very slightly with a light that\nshouldn\u2019t have been there inside a windowless stone house. \u201cWhat colour ribbons\ndoes she like to wear, and what do her nightmares consist of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy could you possibly need to\nknow that?\u201d Tony said, baffled and shaken by whatever Loki had done.</p><p>Loki was silent but Tony felt the\ntemperature physically drop and his skin prickled. \u201cAlright,\u201d he breathed, his\nheart pounding, and quickly answered Loki\u2019s questions, and all of his\nsubsequent ones, as best as he was able.</p><p>\u201cMm and what kind of a red is her\nhair?\u201d</p><p>An odd smell had arisen from\nwhatever it was Loki was making using a mixture of physical items and movements\nof his hands, which seemed to fade into a pale blue like the glowing circle in\nTony\u2019s chest. The odour, of something burning, was making Tony dizzy.</p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d he struggled to bring\nPepper\u2019s hair to mind. \u201cNo, more- a soft orange, like- like- leaves in autumn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Loki muttered,\ncupping a faintly green thing in his hands. \u201cThe essence of her\u2026of Pepper\u2026is\nquite sweet, is it not. But with a steel backbone.\u201d Loki hummed, sounding\npleased and Tony frowned as he tried to recall whether he\u2019d told Loki Pepper\u2019s\nname but he was certain he hadn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t question it but just watched\nsilently as Loki transferred the green object into a leather bag.</p><p>\u201cIt is done,\u201d he said. \u201cShe will\nrecover herself. Ensure it is swallowed with tea within the next two days.\u201d </p><p>Tony took the leather bag when\nLoki offered it and looked from it to Loki with a multitude of questions\nhanging heavily on his tongue, but he didn\u2019t ask them.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said finally. \u201cI\nwill- return, then.\u201d</p><p>Loki inclined his head with a\nknowing smile. It was both friendly and unsettling. \u201cI know you will,\u201d Loki\nsaid and Tony nodded silently before moving on unstable legs towards the\ndoorway. \u201cFarewell, Tony Stark,\u201d Loki said, his voice smooth.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye,\u201d Tony said, turning to\nlook over his shoulder at the dark-haired man before he turned away and shifted\nthe heavy fabric away to slip out into soft dusk, the leather bag clutched in\nhis hand.</p><p>But he was not in a hollow\namongst too-green grass, but back on the moor and shocked, he looked back at\nthe dwelling he had come from only to find it gone. Turning away, he put a hand\nto his glowing chest and, shivering, he made for the town to deliver Loki\u2019s\ncure to his sister. </p><p>He knew he would find Loki again\nwhen the time came to return, whether he wished to or not.</p><p>[Author notes: I hope people liked the different style, do let me know!]</p><p>Links to:</p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F16157117&amp;t=ZGRjYTk1ZDQ2Nzg3ZjRjYTZjNzlhMmM3MmJiZDc1MzAzYTExMWMzNyxWY0ZzMmd1ZQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AgBbSr9o6D-BObkgPFRq2aA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fsauvage-loup.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178669562584%2Fwhumptober&amp;m=1\">Day 1 - Stabbed</a>, <i>Detroit Become Human</i></p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F16168115&amp;t=OWEyNDc5ZWVlZjQwNDhiMzdiN2Q2N2JkNzUxMTI1OTI4Y2EwZWU0NCxjWFJSUVZkSA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AgBbSr9o6D-BObkgPFRq2aA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fsauvage-loup.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178706303839%2Fwhumptober&amp;m=1\">Day 2 - Bloody hand</a>s, <i>Marvel Cinematic Universe</i></p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F16181498&amp;t=ZDVjNTgzMTgwMTU2ZDdlNzA1NTk5MGNlNDM3MWQxOGQ5MzMwNTM5NSw5bG5nOFBRdQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AgBbSr9o6D-BObkgPFRq2aA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fsauvage-loup.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178733887114%2Fwhumptober&amp;m=1\">Day 3 - Insomnia</a>, <i>Harry Potter</i></p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F16190984&amp;t=MGJiODYzYTBkMTcwMzI3ZTc1MzdmMGUwMTFhYjVhYTc4NjJlMjE1NCxxNndLNVF5RQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AgBbSr9o6D-BObkgPFRq2aA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fsauvage-loup.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178769020239%2Fwhumptober&amp;m=1\">Day 4 -\u00a0\u201cNo, stop!\u201d,</a> <i>Altered Carbon</i></p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F16202669&amp;t=NjM5OGQxYzQwYTViMGYwZjJlNzZmNzFlOGI3ZjMwNTkxOWFhMjJjYyw5T2NVamZJNQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AgBbSr9o6D-BObkgPFRq2aA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fsauvage-loup.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178795300014%2Fwhumptober&amp;m=1\">Day 5 - Poisone</a>d,<i> Supernatural</i></p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F16212224&amp;t=NmZiMWU5NzcwNGIwZmFkMjZjYTVlNTRkZGZjMGM0NWQ5ZjY1MTIwOSxyb2lBSTBleg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AgBbSr9o6D-BObkgPFRq2aA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fsauvage-loup.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178825405744%2Fwhumptober&amp;m=1\">Day 6 -\u00a0 Betrayed</a>, <i>Detroit Become Human</i></p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F16223531&amp;t=ZTY3OGZhZjE3ZGM4ZWI5YTUwZGFkOTZlYWRlOTVjZjE2MWUyMjgxOCx2SVRsNGlPdQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AgBbSr9o6D-BObkgPFRq2aA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fsauvage-loup.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178861162579%2Fwhumptober&amp;m=1\">Day 7 - Kidnapped</a>, <i>Supernatural</i></p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F16235708&amp;t=YjE5ZjY4NzRiMmMzNDg5YTc0MTA2MDJlMGVhMmZlNGIzOWI3OTAxNSwyNDJ3ZWdoNg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AgBbSr9o6D-BObkgPFRq2aA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fsauvage-loup.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178892649594%2Fwhumptober&amp;m=1\">Day 8 - Fever</a>, <i>Yuuri!! on ice</i></p><p>D<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16246364\">ay 9 - Stranded</a>,<i> Detroit Become Human</i></p></p>",

The uneven ground held sharp rocks\nbeneath the thin grass and dank moss and the mist was thick enough that Tony\ncould feel it, wet and bitingly fresh in his chest when he breathed. He\nshuddered and staggered on. He didn\u2019t know where he was going and only\ndesperation made him so reckless, forcing him forwards.</p><p>Time didn\u2019t seem to pass in any\nway bar a growing fatigue in his limbs; the landscape didn\u2019t change and the\nintensity of the bleary, milky sun stayed the same.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he muttered. \u201cWhere\nthe hell are you?\u201d <i>This is ridiculous</i>,\nhe thought angrily, but he pressed on and he didn\u2019t voice his doubts. Up here\nit was harder to be scornful, what with the way the mist lay like a veil,\nseeming as if anything at all might emerge from it.</p><p>The witch would only be found if\nhe wanted to be, Tony had been told. All his life, he\u2019d sneered and derided\ntheir superstitions as they tied red ribbons to their doorknobs on Midsummer\u2019s\nand turned their coats inside out when herons passed overhead. But he was\ndesperate and, loathe as he was to admit it, he had to acknowledge that he had\nseen people go up onto these moors fraught with sickness and return cured.\nThere <i>had</i> to be an explanation, there\nhad to be some way he could help Pepper.</p><p>He kept stumbling onwards, his\neyes on the ground in front of his feet, the mist seeming to be closing on him,\nbut he tried to tell himself that it was only his paranoia. A sudden jut of\ngrey rock caught his tired foot and Tony tripped forwards with a sharp cry,\nreaching out his hands, but they touched wet grass only to lose grip on it as\nhe slid sideways and went into freefall with a shocked shout.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t have been long but it\nfelt like he hung in the icy, rushing air for several seconds before the ground\nslammed into him and all the air was knocked out him as surely as if he\u2019d been\nstruck in the stomach with a walking cane.</p><p>His chest feeling crushed, Tony\ngrunted as he tried first to drag cold air into his lungs and then move. Lying\non his stomach, he saw the fingers of his right hand twitch in front of his\nface and he tried to lift himself, to roll over, only to cry out as pain lanced\nall across his chest and down his left arm. There was a throbbing in his head,\ntoo, and a feeling of wetness. Tony lay there, his head turned to the side, and\nchoked back the pain as he tried to pull himself together.</p><p>Closing his eyes in frustration\nand something like the beginnings of despair, he opened them a moment later and\nrecoiled in shock, only to grit his teeth against the wave of pain the slight\nmovement elicited.</p><p>A man was stood in front of him,\nonly his legs in Tony\u2019s line of sight where he was lying on his stomach, but Tony\nrolled his eyes upwards and found the man to be tall, his skin pale as the mist\nand his hands folded behind his back. He looked down at Tony with a slight,\ndispassionate frown. His figure seemed to shimmer in the mist and Tony couldn\u2019t\ntell whether his eyes were deceiving him.</p><p>\u201cWh-where did you come from?\u201d\nTony managed, strained. Speaking worsened the pain in his chest and he felt\nlike there was something beneath his sternum, sticking into him.</p>[[MORE]]<p>The man smiled slightly, his hair\ndark like a raven\u2019s but for a sliver of silver, not like that of old-age but\nlike thick strands of metal growing directly from the man\u2019s scalp.</p><p>\u201cHere and there,\u201d the man said in\na smooth, pleasant voice, smiling agelessly. \u201cThe more important question is\nhow you came to be bleeding on my heath.\u201d</p><p>Tony blinked and tried to drag his\nthoughts through the haze of pain in his head. Flexing his right hand against\nthe wet moss, he clenched his jaw and dragged himself up to seated with a\nrepressed gasp of pain. The man stood silently, watching, much as a bird prey\nperches on a ledge and studies the landscape.</p><p>\u201cI,\u201d Tony started stiffly as he\npressed a cold hand to his chest and it came away bloody. There was a sharp\nrock sticking out of the ground where he\u2019d fallen and it had stabbed him\nshallowly in the chest, and bruised him all across his ribs where it hadn\u2019t\nbroken skin. Each breath hurt but he made himself focus on the pale man. \u201cAre\nyou the witch?\u201d he asked. The man didn\u2019t look mortal, that was certain, and the\nlonger Tony looked at him, the more he wanted to look away. </p><p>The man tilted his head and\nraised his hands in an elegant gesture. \u201cI am Loki, neither <i>witch</i> by your crude meaning, nor mortal.\u201d</p><p>Tony clenched his jaw. \u201cI need to help my sister,\u201d he said.</p><p> \u201cYou will need a little more faith and a\nlittle less doubt if you\u2019re to reach your goal,\u201d the man, <i>Loki</i>, said cryptically and Tony had to bite back a sharp answer.\nBut Loki was right; Tony\u2019s head was scrambling to find an explanation for Loki\u2019s\nsudden appearance, for the way he didn\u2019t seem quite solid, for the glinting,\nheavy silver in his hair. The Loki smiled like he knew what Tony was thinking,\nand maybe he <i>did</i> know, Tony thought,\nthoroughly unnerved.</p><p>Loki made a small motion past\nTony, pointing with a long finger. \u201cMake your way lightly down into the\nhollow,\u201d he said, \u201cand watch where you place your feet. Do not eat anything; it\nis not what it seems. Don\u2019t take too long. The dark is not your friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat-\u201d Tony started, but Loki\nwas not there and Tony blinked, swallowing, \u201cwill I find?\u201d he finished softly,\nto himself. He hadn\u2019t seen nor heard Loki go; he had simply been there and then\nhe had not. <i>Damnation</i>, he thought as\na shiver crawled up his spine like an insect. </p><p>It took a few minutes but Tony\nforced himself first fully up to seated and then, hissing under his breath as\npain sparked through him, hot and distracting, he came dizzily to his feet. His\nankle complained beneath him but it wasn\u2019t sprained and held his weight well\nenough. His left arm felt achingly bruised but his chest throbbed something\nawful and, when he touched the back of his head, his fingers came away sticky\nwith blood.</p><p>He blinked as he steadied himself\nand then, very slowly, he put one foot forwards, and then another, in the\ndirection the strange, ethereal man had told him to. The mist seemed less\noppressive, revealing more of his way before him, and it lifted further as he\nmoved down a steady incline. The rough moorland grass turned to a strikingly\nlush green and Tony stepped on it with a sense of foreboding, but continued\nforwards. </p><p>He stopped when a perfectly\ncircular cluster of buttercups appeared amongst the grass, glowing a lustrous\nyellow, and, gingerly, he moved carefully around them before carrying on. Dark\nshapes seemed to move beyond the folds of the mist, some of which looked like\ndeer and others that had black eyes and were too tall to be human. Tony\nremembered his mother telling him as a child not to look too hard out of the\nwinter at night lest he offend <i>something</i>\nwith his staring, and he looked quickly away from the ill-defined figures in\nthe mist, directing his gaze at the soft grass instead as he hurried onwards. </p><p>Small bushes and shrubs began to\nappear, and not the harsh scratch of unflowering heather that had been up on\nthe moor, but rich spreads of flora that Tony couldn\u2019t identify, even though\nhe\u2019d lived just off the moor for all of his life. But this place didn\u2019t feel\nlocal or even earthly and Tony felt his unease grow apace with his belief that\nthe stories were <i>true</i>, and the vision\nhe\u2019d seen had really been that of the witch that was supposed to reside here.</p><p>Berries that shouldn\u2019t have been\nthere in November hung in abundance, looking full and exactly like bilberries\nand wild strawberries, except that they were too perfect, too universally the\nsame, and, parched and exhausted as he was, Tony didn\u2019t touch them. </p><p>A faint rustling up ahead made\nhim slow his staggering step and, emotionally and physically drained, he looked\nwarily at a rose bush that bloomed with perfect, red flowers but had thorns\nlonger than Tony\u2019s thumbnail. Tony kept walking, looking sideways at the roses,\nbut he stopped when he saw that it was a small, rangy hare with ragged, bloody\nfur and black eyes that was making the rose plant rustle with its struggling.\nIts back foot was crushed in an evil-looking metal trap and Tony looked away\ndown the hollow, towards where he might, just might, get the cure for Pepper,\nand then back to the hare. </p><p>The light was fading steadily\nfrom the cloudy sky and Loki had said to hurry, but Tony couldn\u2019t leave the\npoor creature in good faith and, wincing and gritting his teeth, he crouched\ndown in front of it. The hare stilled, its skinny sides heaving in panic and\npain, and Tony eyed the trap, which was half-embedded in amongst the rose\nthorns. Tony looked again at the sky, which seemed to be getting dimmer by the\nsecond, and thought, <i>in for a penny, in\nfor a pound</i>.</p><p>He pushed his hand in amongst the\nthorns, releasing a bitten-off cry of pain at the sharp jabs of the thorns, like\nhalf-a-dozen needles. He fumbled at the trap and managed, finally, to free the\nspring, even as the thorns cut his hand to a gouged mess by the time he took\nhold of the hare\u2019s bloody leg and, gently as he could manage, freed it.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he urged, only for the\ncreature to snap around to bite him on the hand. He yelped in shock more than\npain and snatched his hand in close as the hare bounded away. It stopped a few\npaces away in a very un-hare-like manner and turned back to look at him with\nthose black eyes and Tony stared at it as he held his hand to his aching chest.\nThen the hare was gone and Tony went tiredly onwards, staring at the spot where\nthe hare had stopped to look at him and wondering at the lack of blood, even\nthough he had felt it, tacky and warm, under his fingers as he\u2019d freed the\nanimal.</p><p>A minute or so later, a low,\nstone dwelling came into view and he approached it with a mixture of relief and\ntrepidation. </p><p>There was a dark red cloth\nhanging where there ought to have been a door and this was swept aside as Tony\ncame to stand in front of it.</p><p>\u201cDo you wish to come in?\u201d Loki\nasked with a slight, ironic tilt to his pale lips, with silver shifting amongst\nhis dark hair.</p><p>Too tired for any sort of retort,\nTony just nodded. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. </p><p>Loki nodded. \u201cThen do so,\u201d he\nsaid, and disappeared back inside, leaving the cloth rippling in his wake.</p><p>Tony came wearily inside and sat\ndown in a chair the man indicated without even looking around, but when he did,\nhe blinked in shock. The entirety of the ceiling was covered in shells of all\nshapes and colours and none like Tony had ever found on a beach, all of them\nmeticulously arranged in marvellous patterns and assortments, like\nconstellations.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2026we are so far from the sea,\u201d\nTony said, staring.</p><p>Loki laughed quietly. A cup of\ntea came into Loki\u2019s hands without Tony seeing him make it and Tony accepted it\nwhen it was guided into his cold, bloody hands. </p><p>\u201cStrange,\u201d Loki said. \u201cI find\nthem all about the place.\u201d Tony turned to blink at him as he clasped the warm\ntea-cup without drinking it. He looked down at the dark-green tea for a moment.</p><p>\u201cCan you help me?\u201d he asked\nquietly.</p><p>\u201cI hear you met Narfi,\u201d Loki\nsaid, disregarding Tony\u2019s question, and pointed elegantly to where a hare was\nslipping under the heavy red cloth at the doorway. The same hare, Tony was\nsure, that he had freed from the trap, except that this one was entirely\nunharmed and looked sleek with health. \u201cHe is quite pleased with you,\u201d Loki\nsaid.</p><p>Tony nodded blankly before\nputting the tea firmly down on a stout table and gripping the armrest of his\nchair, grounding himself in the sting of the cuts on his palm. \u201cI need to know\nif you can help my sister,\u201d he said.</p><p>Loki looked at him with the same,\nslight smile, but didn\u2019t bypass Tony\u2019s question this time. \u201cI can,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut what can you help <i>me</i> with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need help with?\u201d\nTony said slowly. He felt too tired to be negotiating with a witch, but as long\nas he got a cure for Pepper out of the deal, he didn\u2019t think he cared if Loki\nbested him somehow.</p><p>\u201cMm,\u201d Loki said and brushed his\nshoulder-length black hair from his forehead. He looked at Tony like a\nthoughtful cat considering how best to climb a wall. \u201cPerhaps you might be\nuseful.\u201d He beckoned Tony with his hand and Tony reluctantly stood up and came\ntowards him, although that same sense of unease he got when he looked at Loki\nfor too long intensified the closer Tony came. </p><p>When Tony was in touching\ndistance, Loki hummed, looking at the blood on Tony\u2019s chest like it was edible.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Loki muttered and\nTony frowned nervously. \u201cGive me your permission and I shall brew your sister\u2019s\ncure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy permission to do\u2026what?\u201d Tony\nsaid. Loki raised his eyebrows silently and Tony took a wary step backwards, or\nat least he meant to, but he found abruptly that he couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cNow, don\u2019t flee, little mortal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to be able to give her\nthe cure,\u201d Tony hissed, fighting the invisible constraints on him but failing\nto shift them. \u201cIf you kill me, I cannot give it to her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cClever,\u201d Loki said. \u201cBut I have\nno intention of stopping you giving it to her,\u201d he said and Tony stilled, eying\nhim guardedly. \u201cYou shall return to her in full health of body and mind to give\nher her cure. You\u2019ll have a period of time to close off your affairs and\nthen\u2026you shall return to me as my familiar-spirit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour familiar?\u201d Tony echoed.\nThere was no smile on Loki\u2019s face now and Tony found himself unable to look on\nhim but dropped his eyes quickly. Loki\u2019s bargain was not weighted in Tony\u2019s\nfavour but it would give his sister her life and so he nodded silently,\nexhausted by all that had occurred. \u201cI give my permission,\u201d he said reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d Loki said and Tony\ntook a deep breath as the bounds around him dropped away, but he wasn\u2019t given a\nmoment before Loki spread his fingers and pressed his hand firmly to the raw\nwound on Tony\u2019s chest, making him cry out. He instinctively cringed away, but\nagain, Loki somehow bound him there and Tony could only groan and struggle\nweakly as pain shot through his chest- and then it was gone and Loki took his\nhand away and smiled.</p><p>Tony shuddered and took several\ndeep breaths, taking a step and then another away from Loki, because it was so\nintense, so disorienting being so close to him. He felt immensely better and he\nlooked down in shock at his unbloodied hands and touched his head to find it\nnot only healed but with no evidence of it ever being injured. </p><p>He yelped in shock when he saw a\nblue glow and realised it was<i> coming from\nhim</i>. he scrabbled at his shirt to look down at himself and found that where\nthere had been the wound there was now a glowing circle in the centre of his\nchest and it pulsed like a firefly\u2019s light, except that it was <i>blue</i>, and embedded in his flesh.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d he gasped but\nLoki wasn\u2019t even looking at him, but had crouched to stroke the ears of the\nhare, Narfi.</p><p>\u201cAs I said I would,\u201d Loki said\nsimply and Tony grit his teeth against the absolute panic and forced himself to\nbreathe through it.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he managed. \u201cCan I have\nthe cure?\u201d</p><p>Loki stood gracefully with a\nsigh. \u201cMortals are always so hasty,\u201d he said, but he moved towards what looked\nto a workstation of a kind, with a stretch of honeyed wood cluttered with\nvarious things that Tony couldn\u2019t fathom the use of. \u201cIt is what makes you both\nso curious and so frustrating.\u201d</p><p>Loki began to pick out various\nitems as he spoke and Tony watched silently.</p><p>\u201cTell me of this sister of\nyours,\u201d Loki said, with his broad-shouldered back to Tony, his simple and yet\nstrange black and green outfit shining very slightly with a light that\nshouldn\u2019t have been there inside a windowless stone house. \u201cWhat colour ribbons\ndoes she like to wear, and what do her nightmares consist of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy could you possibly need to\nknow that?\u201d Tony said, baffled and shaken by whatever Loki had done.</p><p>Loki was silent but Tony felt the\ntemperature physically drop and his skin prickled. \u201cAlright,\u201d he breathed, his\nheart pounding, and quickly answered Loki\u2019s questions, and all of his\nsubsequent ones, as best as he was able.</p><p>\u201cMm and what kind of a red is her\nhair?\u201d</p><p>An odd smell had arisen from\nwhatever it was Loki was making using a mixture of physical items and movements\nof his hands, which seemed to fade into a pale blue like the glowing circle in\nTony\u2019s chest. The odour, of something burning, was making Tony dizzy.</p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d he struggled to bring\nPepper\u2019s hair to mind. \u201cNo, more- a soft orange, like- like- leaves in autumn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Loki muttered,\ncupping a faintly green thing in his hands. \u201cThe essence of her\u2026of Pepper\u2026is\nquite sweet, is it not. But with a steel backbone.\u201d Loki hummed, sounding\npleased and Tony frowned as he tried to recall whether he\u2019d told Loki Pepper\u2019s\nname but he was certain he hadn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t question it but just watched\nsilently as Loki transferred the green object into a leather bag.</p><p>\u201cIt is done,\u201d he said. \u201cShe will\nrecover herself. Ensure it is swallowed with tea within the next two days.\u201d </p><p>Tony took the leather bag when\nLoki offered it and looked from it to Loki with a multitude of questions\nhanging heavily on his tongue, but he didn\u2019t ask them.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said finally. \u201cI\nwill- return, then.\u201d</p><p>Loki inclined his head with a\nknowing smile. It was both friendly and unsettling. \u201cI know you will,\u201d Loki\nsaid and Tony nodded silently before moving on unstable legs towards the\ndoorway. \u201cFarewell, Tony Stark,\u201d Loki said, his voice smooth.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye,\u201d Tony said, turning to\nlook over his shoulder at the dark-haired man before he turned away and shifted\nthe heavy fabric away to slip out into soft dusk, the leather bag clutched in\nhis hand.</p><p>But he was not in a hollow\namongst too-green grass, but back on the moor and shocked, he looked back at\nthe dwelling he had come from only to find it gone. Turning away, he put a hand\nto his glowing chest and, shivering, he made for the town to deliver Loki\u2019s\ncure to his sister. </p><p>He knew he would find Loki again\nwhen the time came to return, whether he wished to or not.</p><p>[Author notes: I hope people liked the different style, do let me know!]</p><p>Links to:</p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F16157117&amp;t=ZGRjYTk1ZDQ2Nzg3ZjRjYTZjNzlhMmM3MmJiZDc1MzAzYTExMWMzNyxWY0ZzMmd1ZQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AgBbSr9o6D-BObkgPFRq2aA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fsauvage-loup.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178669562584%2Fwhumptober&amp;m=1\">Day 1 - Stabbed</a>, <i>Detroit Become Human</i></p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F16168115&amp;t=OWEyNDc5ZWVlZjQwNDhiMzdiN2Q2N2JkNzUxMTI1OTI4Y2EwZWU0NCxjWFJSUVZkSA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AgBbSr9o6D-BObkgPFRq2aA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fsauvage-loup.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178706303839%2Fwhumptober&amp;m=1\">Day 2 - Bloody hand</a>s, <i>Marvel Cinematic Universe</i></p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F16181498&amp;t=ZDVjNTgzMTgwMTU2ZDdlNzA1NTk5MGNlNDM3MWQxOGQ5MzMwNTM5NSw5bG5nOFBRdQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AgBbSr9o6D-BObkgPFRq2aA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fsauvage-loup.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178733887114%2Fwhumptober&amp;m=1\">Day 3 - Insomnia</a>, <i>Harry Potter</i></p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F16190984&amp;t=MGJiODYzYTBkMTcwMzI3ZTc1MzdmMGUwMTFhYjVhYTc4NjJlMjE1NCxxNndLNVF5RQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AgBbSr9o6D-BObkgPFRq2aA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fsauvage-loup.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178769020239%2Fwhumptober&amp;m=1\">Day 4 -\u00a0\u201cNo, stop!\u201d,</a> <i>Altered Carbon</i></p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F16202669&amp;t=NjM5OGQxYzQwYTViMGYwZjJlNzZmNzFlOGI3ZjMwNTkxOWFhMjJjYyw5T2NVamZJNQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AgBbSr9o6D-BObkgPFRq2aA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fsauvage-loup.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178795300014%2Fwhumptober&amp;m=1\">Day 5 - Poisone</a>d,<i> Supernatural</i></p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F16212224&amp;t=NmZiMWU5NzcwNGIwZmFkMjZjYTVlNTRkZGZjMGM0NWQ5ZjY1MTIwOSxyb2lBSTBleg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AgBbSr9o6D-BObkgPFRq2aA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fsauvage-loup.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178825405744%2Fwhumptober&amp;m=1\">Day 6 -\u00a0 Betrayed</a>, <i>Detroit Become Human</i></p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F16223531&amp;t=ZTY3OGZhZjE3ZGM4ZWI5YTUwZGFkOTZlYWRlOTVjZjE2MWUyMjgxOCx2SVRsNGlPdQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AgBbSr9o6D-BObkgPFRq2aA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fsauvage-loup.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178861162579%2Fwhumptober&amp;m=1\">Day 7 - Kidnapped</a>, <i>Supernatural</i></p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F16235708&amp;t=YjE5ZjY4NzRiMmMzNDg5YTc0MTA2MDJlMGVhMmZlNGIzOWI3OTAxNSwyNDJ3ZWdoNg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AgBbSr9o6D-BObkgPFRq2aA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fsauvage-loup.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178892649594%2Fwhumptober&amp;m=1\">Day 8 - Fever</a>, <i>Yuuri!! on ice</i></p><p>D<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16246364\">ay 9 - Stranded</a>,<i> Detroit Become Human</i></p></p>",

The uneven ground held sharp rocks\nbeneath the thin grass and dank moss and the mist was thick enough that Tony\ncould feel it, wet and bitingly fresh in his chest when he breathed. He\nshuddered and staggered on. He didn&rsquo;t know where he was going and only\ndesperation made him so reckless, forcing him forwards.</p><p>Time didn&rsquo;t seem to pass in any\nway bar a growing fatigue in his limbs; the landscape didn&rsquo;t change and the\nintensity of the bleary, milky sun stayed the same.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Where\nthe hell are you?&rdquo; <i>This is ridiculous</i>,\nhe thought angrily, but he pressed on and he didn&rsquo;t voice his doubts. Up here\nit was harder to be scornful, what with the way the mist lay like a veil,\nseeming as if anything at all might emerge from it.</p><p>The witch would only be found if\nhe wanted to be, Tony had been told. All his life, he&rsquo;d sneered and derided\ntheir superstitions as they tied red ribbons to their doorknobs on Midsummer&rsquo;s\nand turned their coats inside out when herons passed overhead. But he was\ndesperate and, loathe as he was to admit it, he had to acknowledge that he had\nseen people go up onto these moors fraught with sickness and return cured.\nThere <i>had</i> to be an explanation, there\nhad to be some way he could help Pepper.</p><p>He kept stumbling onwards, his\neyes on the ground in front of his feet, the mist seeming to be closing on him,\nbut he tried to tell himself that it was only his paranoia. A sudden jut of\ngrey rock caught his tired foot and Tony tripped forwards with a sharp cry,\nreaching out his hands, but they touched wet grass only to lose grip on it as\nhe slid sideways and went into freefall with a shocked shout.</p><p>It couldn&rsquo;t have been long but it\nfelt like he hung in the icy, rushing air for several seconds before the ground\nslammed into him and all the air was knocked out him as surely as if he&rsquo;d been\nstruck in the stomach with a walking cane.</p><p>His chest feeling crushed, Tony\ngrunted as he tried first to drag cold air into his lungs and then move. Lying\non his stomach, he saw the fingers of his right hand twitch in front of his\nface and he tried to lift himself, to roll over, only to cry out as pain lanced\nall across his chest and down his left arm. There was a throbbing in his head,\ntoo, and a feeling of wetness. Tony lay there, his head turned to the side, and\nchoked back the pain as he tried to pull himself together.</p><p>Closing his eyes in frustration\nand something like the beginnings of despair, he opened them a moment later and\nrecoiled in shock, only to grit his teeth against the wave of pain the slight\nmovement elicited.</p><p>A man was stood in front of him,\nonly his legs in Tony&rsquo;s line of sight where he was lying on his stomach, but Tony\nrolled his eyes upwards and found the man to be tall, his skin pale as the mist\nand his hands folded behind his back. He looked down at Tony with a slight,\ndispassionate frown. His figure seemed to shimmer in the mist and Tony couldn&rsquo;t\ntell whether his eyes were deceiving him.</p><p>&ldquo;Wh-where did you come from?&rdquo;\nTony managed, strained. Speaking worsened the pain in his chest and he felt\nlike there was something beneath his sternum, sticking into him.</p><p>The man smiled slightly, his hair\ndark like a raven&rsquo;s but for a sliver of silver, not like that of old-age but\nlike thick strands of metal growing directly from the man&rsquo;s scalp.</p><p>&ldquo;Here and there,&rdquo; the man said in\na smooth, pleasant voice, smiling agelessly. &ldquo;The more important question is\nhow you came to be bleeding on my heath.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony blinked and tried to drag his\nthoughts through the haze of pain in his head. Flexing his right hand against\nthe wet moss, he clenched his jaw and dragged himself up to seated with a\nrepressed gasp of pain. The man stood silently, watching, much as a bird prey\nperches on a ledge and studies the landscape.</p><p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; Tony started stiffly as he\npressed a cold hand to his chest and it came away bloody. There was a sharp\nrock sticking out of the ground where he&rsquo;d fallen and it had stabbed him\nshallowly in the chest, and bruised him all across his ribs where it hadn&rsquo;t\nbroken skin. Each breath hurt but he made himself focus on the pale man. &ldquo;Are\nyou the witch?&rdquo; he asked. The man didn&rsquo;t look mortal, that was certain, and the\nlonger Tony looked at him, the more he wanted to look away. </p><p>The man tilted his head and\nraised his hands in an elegant gesture. &ldquo;I am Loki, neither <i>witch</i> by your crude meaning, nor mortal.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony clenched his jaw. &ldquo;I need to help my sister,&rdquo; he said.</p><p> &ldquo;You will need a little more faith and a\nlittle less doubt if you&rsquo;re to reach your goal,&rdquo; the man, <i>Loki</i>, said cryptically and Tony had to bite back a sharp answer.\nBut Loki was right; Tony&rsquo;s head was scrambling to find an explanation for Loki&rsquo;s\nsudden appearance, for the way he didn&rsquo;t seem quite solid, for the glinting,\nheavy silver in his hair. The Loki smiled like he knew what Tony was thinking,\nand maybe he <i>did</i> know, Tony thought,\nthoroughly unnerved.</p><p>Loki made a small motion past\nTony, pointing with a long finger. &ldquo;Make your way lightly down into the\nhollow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and watch where you place your feet. Do not eat anything; it\nis not what it seems. Don&rsquo;t take too long. The dark is not your friend.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What-&rdquo; Tony started, but Loki\nwas not there and Tony blinked, swallowing, &ldquo;will I find?&rdquo; he finished softly,\nto himself. He hadn&rsquo;t seen nor heard Loki go; he had simply been there and then\nhe had not. <i>Damnation</i>, he thought as\na shiver crawled up his spine like an insect. </p><p>It took a few minutes but Tony\nforced himself first fully up to seated and then, hissing under his breath as\npain sparked through him, hot and distracting, he came dizzily to his feet. His\nankle complained beneath him but it wasn&rsquo;t sprained and held his weight well\nenough. His left arm felt achingly bruised but his chest throbbed something\nawful and, when he touched the back of his head, his fingers came away sticky\nwith blood.</p><p>He blinked as he steadied himself\nand then, very slowly, he put one foot forwards, and then another, in the\ndirection the strange, ethereal man had told him to. The mist seemed less\noppressive, revealing more of his way before him, and it lifted further as he\nmoved down a steady incline. The rough moorland grass turned to a strikingly\nlush green and Tony stepped on it with a sense of foreboding, but continued\nforwards. </p><p>He stopped when a perfectly\ncircular cluster of buttercups appeared amongst the grass, glowing a lustrous\nyellow, and, gingerly, he moved carefully around them before carrying on. Dark\nshapes seemed to move beyond the folds of the mist, some of which looked like\ndeer and others that had black eyes and were too tall to be human. Tony\nremembered his mother telling him as a child not to look too hard out of the\nwinter at night lest he offend <i>something</i>\nwith his staring, and he looked quickly away from the ill-defined figures in\nthe mist, directing his gaze at the soft grass instead as he hurried onwards. </p><p>Small bushes and shrubs began to\nappear, and not the harsh scratch of unflowering heather that had been up on\nthe moor, but rich spreads of flora that Tony couldn&rsquo;t identify, even though\nhe&rsquo;d lived just off the moor for all of his life. But this place didn&rsquo;t feel\nlocal or even earthly and Tony felt his unease grow apace with his belief that\nthe stories were <i>true</i>, and the vision\nhe&rsquo;d seen had really been that of the witch that was supposed to reside here.</p><p>Berries that shouldn&rsquo;t have been\nthere in November hung in abundance, looking full and exactly like bilberries\nand wild strawberries, except that they were too perfect, too universally the\nsame, and, parched and exhausted as he was, Tony didn&rsquo;t touch them. </p><p>A faint rustling up ahead made\nhim slow his staggering step and, emotionally and physically drained, he looked\nwarily at a rose bush that bloomed with perfect, red flowers but had thorns\nlonger than Tony&rsquo;s thumbnail. Tony kept walking, looking sideways at the roses,\nbut he stopped when he saw that it was a small, rangy hare with ragged, bloody\nfur and black eyes that was making the rose plant rustle with its struggling.\nIts back foot was crushed in an evil-looking metal trap and Tony looked away\ndown the hollow, towards where he might, just might, get the cure for Pepper,\nand then back to the hare. </p><p>The light was fading steadily\nfrom the cloudy sky and Loki had said to hurry, but Tony couldn&rsquo;t leave the\npoor creature in good faith and, wincing and gritting his teeth, he crouched\ndown in front of it. The hare stilled, its skinny sides heaving in panic and\npain, and Tony eyed the trap, which was half-embedded in amongst the rose\nthorns. Tony looked again at the sky, which seemed to be getting dimmer by the\nsecond, and thought, <i>in for a penny, in\nfor a pound</i>.</p><p>He pushed his hand in amongst the\nthorns, releasing a bitten-off cry of pain at the sharp jabs of the thorns, like\nhalf-a-dozen needles. He fumbled at the trap and managed, finally, to free the\nspring, even as the thorns cut his hand to a gouged mess by the time he took\nhold of the hare&rsquo;s bloody leg and, gently as he could manage, freed it.</p><p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he urged, only for the\ncreature to snap around to bite him on the hand. He yelped in shock more than\npain and snatched his hand in close as the hare bounded away. It stopped a few\npaces away in a very un-hare-like manner and turned back to look at him with\nthose black eyes and Tony stared at it as he held his hand to his aching chest.\nThen the hare was gone and Tony went tiredly onwards, staring at the spot where\nthe hare had stopped to look at him and wondering at the lack of blood, even\nthough he had felt it, tacky and warm, under his fingers as he&rsquo;d freed the\nanimal.</p><p>A minute or so later, a low,\nstone dwelling came into view and he approached it with a mixture of relief and\ntrepidation. </p><p>There was a dark red cloth\nhanging where there ought to have been a door and this was swept aside as Tony\ncame to stand in front of it.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you wish to come in?&rdquo; Loki\nasked with a slight, ironic tilt to his pale lips, with silver shifting amongst\nhis dark hair.</p><p>Too tired for any sort of retort,\nTony just nodded. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. </p><p>Loki nodded. &ldquo;Then do so,&rdquo; he\nsaid, and disappeared back inside, leaving the cloth rippling in his wake.</p><p>Tony came wearily inside and sat\ndown in a chair the man indicated without even looking around, but when he did,\nhe blinked in shock. The entirety of the ceiling was covered in shells of all\nshapes and colours and none like Tony had ever found on a beach, all of them\nmeticulously arranged in marvellous patterns and assortments, like\nconstellations.</p><p>&ldquo;But&hellip;we are so far from the sea,&rdquo;\nTony said, staring.</p><p>Loki laughed quietly. A cup of\ntea came into Loki&rsquo;s hands without Tony seeing him make it and Tony accepted it\nwhen it was guided into his cold, bloody hands. </p><p>&ldquo;Strange,&rdquo; Loki said. &ldquo;I find\nthem all about the place.&rdquo; Tony turned to blink at him as he clasped the warm\ntea-cup without drinking it. He looked down at the dark-green tea for a moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Can you help me?&rdquo; he asked\nquietly.</p><p>&ldquo;I hear you met Narfi,&rdquo; Loki\nsaid, disregarding Tony&rsquo;s question, and pointed elegantly to where a hare was\nslipping under the heavy red cloth at the doorway. The same hare, Tony was\nsure, that he had freed from the trap, except that this one was entirely\nunharmed and looked sleek with health. &ldquo;He is quite pleased with you,&rdquo; Loki\nsaid.</p><p>Tony nodded blankly before\nputting the tea firmly down on a stout table and gripping the armrest of his\nchair, grounding himself in the sting of the cuts on his palm. &ldquo;I need to know\nif you can help my sister,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Loki looked at him with the same,\nslight smile, but didn&rsquo;t bypass Tony&rsquo;s question this time. &ldquo;I can,&rdquo; he said.\n&ldquo;But what can you help <i>me</i> with?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you need help with?&rdquo;\nTony said slowly. He felt too tired to be negotiating with a witch, but as long\nas he got a cure for Pepper out of the deal, he didn&rsquo;t think he cared if Loki\nbested him somehow.</p><p>&ldquo;Mm,&rdquo; Loki said and brushed his\nshoulder-length black hair from his forehead. He looked at Tony like a\nthoughtful cat considering how best to climb a wall. &ldquo;Perhaps you might be\nuseful.&rdquo; He beckoned Tony with his hand and Tony reluctantly stood up and came\ntowards him, although that same sense of unease he got when he looked at Loki\nfor too long intensified the closer Tony came. </p><p>When Tony was in touching\ndistance, Loki hummed, looking at the blood on Tony&rsquo;s chest like it was edible.</p><p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Loki muttered and\nTony frowned nervously. &ldquo;Give me your permission and I shall brew your sister&rsquo;s\ncure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My permission to do&hellip;what?&rdquo; Tony\nsaid. Loki raised his eyebrows silently and Tony took a wary step backwards, or\nat least he meant to, but he found abruptly that he couldn&rsquo;t move.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t flee, little mortal.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have to be able to give her\nthe cure,&rdquo; Tony hissed, fighting the invisible constraints on him but failing\nto shift them. &ldquo;If you kill me, I cannot give it to her!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Clever,&rdquo; Loki said. &ldquo;But I have\nno intention of stopping you giving it to her,&rdquo; he said and Tony stilled, eying\nhim guardedly. &ldquo;You shall return to her in full health of body and mind to give\nher her cure. You&rsquo;ll have a period of time to close off your affairs and\nthen&hellip;you shall return to me as my familiar-spirit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your familiar?&rdquo; Tony echoed.\nThere was no smile on Loki&rsquo;s face now and Tony found himself unable to look on\nhim but dropped his eyes quickly. Loki&rsquo;s bargain was not weighted in Tony&rsquo;s\nfavour but it would give his sister her life and so he nodded silently,\nexhausted by all that had occurred. &ldquo;I give my permission,&rdquo; he said reluctantly.</p><p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; Loki said and Tony\ntook a deep breath as the bounds around him dropped away, but he wasn&rsquo;t given a\nmoment before Loki spread his fingers and pressed his hand firmly to the raw\nwound on Tony&rsquo;s chest, making him cry out. He instinctively cringed away, but\nagain, Loki somehow bound him there and Tony could only groan and struggle\nweakly as pain shot through his chest- and then it was gone and Loki took his\nhand away and smiled.</p><p>Tony shuddered and took several\ndeep breaths, taking a step and then another away from Loki, because it was so\nintense, so disorienting being so close to him. He felt immensely better and he\nlooked down in shock at his unbloodied hands and touched his head to find it\nnot only healed but with no evidence of it ever being injured. </p><p>He yelped in shock when he saw a\nblue glow and realised it was<i> coming from\nhim</i>. he scrabbled at his shirt to look down at himself and found that where\nthere had been the wound there was now a glowing circle in the centre of his\nchest and it pulsed like a firefly&rsquo;s light, except that it was <i>blue</i>, and embedded in his flesh.</p><p>&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; he gasped but\nLoki wasn&rsquo;t even looking at him, but had crouched to stroke the ears of the\nhare, Narfi.</p><p>&ldquo;As I said I would,&rdquo; Loki said\nsimply and Tony grit his teeth against the absolute panic and forced himself to\nbreathe through it.</p><p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; he managed. &ldquo;Can I have\nthe cure?&rdquo;</p><p>Loki stood gracefully with a\nsigh. &ldquo;Mortals are always so hasty,&rdquo; he said, but he moved towards what looked\nto a workstation of a kind, with a stretch of honeyed wood cluttered with\nvarious things that Tony couldn&rsquo;t fathom the use of. &ldquo;It is what makes you both\nso curious and so frustrating.&rdquo;</p><p>Loki began to pick out various\nitems as he spoke and Tony watched silently.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me of this sister of\nyours,&rdquo; Loki said, with his broad-shouldered back to Tony, his simple and yet\nstrange black and green outfit shining very slightly with a light that\nshouldn&rsquo;t have been there inside a windowless stone house. &ldquo;What colour ribbons\ndoes she like to wear, and what do her nightmares consist of?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why could you possibly need to\nknow that?&rdquo; Tony said, baffled and shaken by whatever Loki had done.</p><p>Loki was silent but Tony felt the\ntemperature physically drop and his skin prickled. &ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; he breathed, his\nheart pounding, and quickly answered Loki&rsquo;s questions, and all of his\nsubsequent ones, as best as he was able.</p><p>&ldquo;Mm and what kind of a red is her\nhair?&rdquo;</p><p>An odd smell had arisen from\nwhatever it was Loki was making using a mixture of physical items and movements\nof his hands, which seemed to fade into a pale blue like the glowing circle in\nTony&rsquo;s chest. The odour, of something burning, was making Tony dizzy.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh,&rdquo; he struggled to bring\nPepper&rsquo;s hair to mind. &ldquo;No, more- a soft orange, like- like- leaves in autumn.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo; Loki muttered,\ncupping a faintly green thing in his hands. &ldquo;The essence of her&hellip;of Pepper&hellip;is\nquite sweet, is it not. But with a steel backbone.&rdquo; Loki hummed, sounding\npleased and Tony frowned as he tried to recall whether he&rsquo;d told Loki Pepper&rsquo;s\nname but he was certain he hadn&rsquo;t. He didn&rsquo;t question it but just watched\nsilently as Loki transferred the green object into a leather bag.</p><p>&ldquo;It is done,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She will\nrecover herself. Ensure it is swallowed with tea within the next two days.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony took the leather bag when\nLoki offered it and looked from it to Loki with a multitude of questions\nhanging heavily on his tongue, but he didn&rsquo;t ask them.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said finally. &ldquo;I\nwill- return, then.&rdquo;</p><p>Loki inclined his head with a\nknowing smile. It was both friendly and unsettling. &ldquo;I know you will,&rdquo; Loki\nsaid and Tony nodded silently before moving on unstable legs towards the\ndoorway. &ldquo;Farewell, Tony Stark,&rdquo; Loki said, his voice smooth.</p><p>&ldquo;Goodbye,&rdquo; Tony said, turning to\nlook over his shoulder at the dark-haired man before he turned away and shifted\nthe heavy fabric away to slip out into soft dusk, the leather bag clutched in\nhis hand.</p><p>But he was not in a hollow\namongst too-green grass, but back on the moor and shocked, he looked back at\nthe dwelling he had come from only to find it gone. Turning away, he put a hand\nto his glowing chest and, shivering, he made for the town to deliver Loki&rsquo;s\ncure to his sister. </p><p>He knew he would find Loki again\nwhen the time came to return, whether he wished to or not.</p><p>[Author notes: I hope people liked the different style, do let me know!]</p><p>Links to:</p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F16157117&amp;t=ZGRjYTk1ZDQ2Nzg3ZjRjYTZjNzlhMmM3MmJiZDc1MzAzYTExMWMzNyxWY0ZzMmd1ZQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AgBbSr9o6D-BObkgPFRq2aA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fsauvage-loup.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178669562584%2Fwhumptober&amp;m=1\">Day 1 - Stabbed</a>, <i>Detroit Become Human</i></p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F16168115&amp;t=OWEyNDc5ZWVlZjQwNDhiMzdiN2Q2N2JkNzUxMTI1OTI4Y2EwZWU0NCxjWFJSUVZkSA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AgBbSr9o6D-BObkgPFRq2aA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fsauvage-loup.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178706303839%2Fwhumptober&amp;m=1\">Day 2 - Bloody hand</a>s, <i>Marvel Cinematic Universe</i></p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F16181498&amp;t=ZDVjNTgzMTgwMTU2ZDdlNzA1NTk5MGNlNDM3MWQxOGQ5MzMwNTM5NSw5bG5nOFBRdQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AgBbSr9o6D-BObkgPFRq2aA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fsauvage-loup.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178733887114%2Fwhumptober&amp;m=1\">Day 3 - Insomnia</a>, <i>Harry Potter</i></p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F16190984&amp;t=MGJiODYzYTBkMTcwMzI3ZTc1MzdmMGUwMTFhYjVhYTc4NjJlMjE1NCxxNndLNVF5RQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AgBbSr9o6D-BObkgPFRq2aA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fsauvage-loup.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178769020239%2Fwhumptober&amp;m=1\">Day 4 -&nbsp;&ldquo;No, stop!&rdquo;,</a> <i>Altered Carbon</i></p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F16202669&amp;t=NjM5OGQxYzQwYTViMGYwZjJlNzZmNzFlOGI3ZjMwNTkxOWFhMjJjYyw5T2NVamZJNQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AgBbSr9o6D-BObkgPFRq2aA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fsauvage-loup.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178795300014%2Fwhumptober&amp;m=1\">Day 5 - Poisone</a>d,<i> Supernatural</i></p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F16212224&amp;t=NmZiMWU5NzcwNGIwZmFkMjZjYTVlNTRkZGZjMGM0NWQ5ZjY1MTIwOSxyb2lBSTBleg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AgBbSr9o6D-BObkgPFRq2aA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fsauvage-loup.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178825405744%2Fwhumptober&amp;m=1\">Day 6 -&nbsp; Betrayed</a>, <i>Detroit Become Human</i></p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F16223531&amp;t=ZTY3OGZhZjE3ZGM4ZWI5YTUwZGFkOTZlYWRlOTVjZjE2MWUyMjgxOCx2SVRsNGlPdQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AgBbSr9o6D-BObkgPFRq2aA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fsauvage-loup.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178861162579%2Fwhumptober&amp;m=1\">Day 7 - Kidnapped</a>, <i>Supernatural</i></p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F16235708&amp;t=YjE5ZjY4NzRiMmMzNDg5YTc0MTA2MDJlMGVhMmZlNGIzOWI3OTAxNSwyNDJ3ZWdoNg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AgBbSr9o6D-BObkgPFRq2aA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fsauvage-loup.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178892649594%2Fwhumptober&amp;m=1\">Day 8 - Fever</a>, <i>Yuuri!! on ice</i></p><p>D<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16246364\">ay 9 - Stranded</a>,<i> Detroit Become Human</i></p></p>",

Tony still gets thoroughly whump but there&rsquo; hope you enjoy!]s some general weirdness along the way :) Also I have nothing written for tomorrow *cue hysterical shrieking* :))))))]<br /></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p><i>Bruises</i></p>\n<p><i><br /></i></p>\n<p>Tony walked over the moor with a\nhaunting sense that he didn&rsquo;t belong here. The uneven ground held sharp rocks\nbeneath the thin grass and dank moss and the mist was thick enough that Tony\ncould feel it, wet and bitingly fresh in his chest when he breathed. He\nshuddered and staggered on. He didn&rsquo;t know where he was going and only\ndesperation made him so reckless, forcing him forwards.</p>\n<p>Time didn&rsquo;t seem to pass in any\nway bar a growing fatigue in his limbs; the landscape didn&rsquo;t change and the\nintensity of the bleary, milky sun stayed the same.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Where\nthe hell are you?&rdquo; <i>This is ridiculous</i>,\nhe thought angrily, but he pressed on and he didn&rsquo;t voice his doubts. Up here\nit was harder to be scornful, what with the way the mist lay like a veil,\nseeming as if anything at all might emerge from it.</p>\n<p>The witch would only be found if\nhe wanted to be, Tony had been told. All his life, he&rsquo;d sneered and derided\ntheir superstitions as they tied red ribbons to their doorknobs on Midsummer&rsquo;s\nand turned their coats inside out when herons passed overhead. But he was\ndesperate and, loathe as he was to admit it, he had to acknowledge that he had\nseen people go up onto these moors fraught with sickness and return cured.\nThere <i>had</i> to be an explanation, there\nhad to be some way he could help Pepper.</p>\n<p>He kept stumbling onwards, his\neyes on the ground in front of his feet, the mist seeming to be closing on him,\nbut he tried to tell himself that it was only his paranoia. A sudden jut of\ngrey rock caught his tired foot and Tony tripped forwards with a sharp cry,\nreaching out his hands, but they touched wet grass only to lose grip on it as\nhe slid sideways and went into freefall with a shocked shout.</p>\n<p>It couldn&rsquo;t have been long but it\nfelt like he hung in the icy, rushing air for several seconds before the ground\nslammed into him and all the air was knocked out him as surely as if he&rsquo;d been\nstruck in the stomach with a walking cane.</p>\n<p>His chest feeling crushed, Tony\ngrunted as he tried first to drag cold air into his lungs and then move. Lying\non his stomach, he saw the fingers of his right hand twitch in front of his\nface and he tried to lift himself, to roll over, only to cry out as pain lanced\nall across his chest and down his left arm. There was a throbbing in his head,\ntoo, and a feeling of wetness. Tony lay there, his head turned to the side, and\nchoked back the pain as he tried to pull himself together.</p>\n<p>Closing his eyes in frustration\nand something like the beginnings of despair, he opened them a moment later and\nrecoiled in shock, only to grit his teeth against the wave of pain the slight\nmovement elicited.</p>\n<p>A man was stood in front of him,\nonly his legs in Tony&rsquo;s line of sight where he was lying on his stomach, but Tony\nrolled his eyes upwards and found the man to be tall, his skin pale as the mist\nand his hands folded behind his back. He looked down at Tony with a slight,\ndispassionate frown. His figure seemed to shimmer in the mist and Tony couldn&rsquo;t\ntell whether his eyes were deceiving him.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Wh-where did you come from?&rdquo;\nTony managed, strained. Speaking worsened the pain in his chest and he felt\nlike there was something beneath his sternum, sticking into him.</p>\n</p>",
