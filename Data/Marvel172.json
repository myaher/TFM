Also I didn&rsquo;t have time to edit this. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>You were tossing and turning in bed, trying with everything you had to fall asleep. Without Steve being home you knew you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get any rest. You hated when he would go on missions without you, not just because you couldn&rsquo;t sleep, but you never knew if he was safe until he contacted you. The two of you hadn&rsquo;t been dating long, but the two of you had been sharing a bed for a while. It had started one night with a nightmare, Steve heard and came to comfort you, and well, the rest was history.</p><p>You knew you had to wait for him to come home before you could get a good night&rsquo;s sleep again. Luckily enough he made sure to call you every night before he went to bed, however it was normally only to say that he was safe, that he loved you and that he wanted you to try to get some sleep. You pouted just thinking about it, but then you had an idea.</p><p>You quickly jumped out of bed knowing that soon enough Steve would be calling you. You shuffled through your dresser desperately trying to find his favorite lingerie set you owned. It was a simple emerald green lacy bra and thong set, but every time you wore it, it would blow Steve&rsquo;s mind. You heard your phone buzz and you hurriedly ran to your bed after letting your hair out of its ponytail. You laid in bed comfortably ready for your game to begin as you excitedly answered the phone. </p><p>Steve&rsquo;s deep voice was music to your ears, &ldquo;Hey Doll! How&rsquo;s my girl?&rdquo; You smiled at your nickname, &ldquo;Not good baby.&rdquo; You heard the concern in his voice, &ldquo;What happened is everything okay?&rdquo; You smirked ready to make your next move, &ldquo;I got a huge bruise from sparing with Wanda today, want to see it?&rdquo; You bit your lip hoping he&rsquo;d take the bait, &ldquo;Let me see it Doll I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not too bad.&rdquo; You adjusted yourself into a sexy pose preparing to snap the picture, &ldquo;okay baby hang on.&rdquo; </p><p>You angled the phone so your body was on full view snapping the picture quickly and sending it to him, &ldquo;There it&rsquo;s sent.&rdquo; You heard him shuffling with his phone as he viewed it before hearing the sharp intake of his breath, &ldquo;Doll, what are you doing.&rdquo; You feigned innocence, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m showing you my bruise.&rdquo; You could practically hear him growl into the phone, &ldquo;You know that set drives me crazy Doll.&rdquo; You giggled, &ldquo;I wanted to look pretty for you.&rdquo; You could hear him groan, &ldquo;Doll keep talkin like that and you&rsquo;re going to drive me crazy.&rdquo; </p><p>This was your time to shine, you put Steve on speaker as you let your hands travel down to your breasts lightly pinching your nipples through the incredibly thin fabric of your bra. You moaned loud enough for him to hear egging him on, &ldquo;What if I want you to go crazy?&rdquo; There was a change in his voice it was deeper  than normal, &ldquo;Doll you better stop.&rdquo; Your hands continued down your body, your fingers slipping under the waistband of your panties. You let two of your fingers dip into your core moaning at the feeling of being filled, &ldquo;Baby I need you.&rdquo; </p><p>You heard him moan, you knew exactly what he was doing, &ldquo;Stevie are you touching yourself?&rdquo; He let out another breathless moan, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in so much trouble when I get home baby girl. Touch yourself for your Captain, I need to hear you.&rdquo; Your fingers continued pumping in and out of your tight core as needy moans escaped your mouth. </p><p>Steve could hear how wet you were through the phone, he closed his eyes picturing your petite frame beneath him as he pounded into your dripping heat. He licked his lips at the thought, his hand quickening it&rsquo;s pace on his shaft, he knew he wasn&rsquo;t going to last much longer and by the pornagraphic moans that were coming out of your mouth he knew you wouldn&rsquo;t either. Your angled your fingers slightly allowing them to brush against your your gspot, your legs were shaking as the coils began to build in your stomach, &ldquo;C-Captain I n-need to..&rdquo; your voice cut out as a loud moan ripped through your throat your orgasm getting closer and closer by the moment. </p><p>Steve was in no better shape, panting heavily as precum dripped down his shaft, &ldquo;Cum Doll, I need to hear you.&rdquo; Your pleasure took over, blinding your vision as your eyes rolled into the back of your skull. Steve&rsquo;s name escaped your mouth like it was the only word you knew how to say, your fingers rocking you through your high. You could hear Steve through the phone, you knew how close he was, &ldquo;Cmon baby cum for me.&rdquo; You cooed into the phone edging him closer, the sound of your voice like sweet music to his ears. Steve finally let go, his head thrown back and curses leaving his sinful mouth.</p><p>You both sat there for a moment catching your breath, Steve finally breaking the silence, &ldquo;We need to do that more often&rdquo; </p><p>Tags:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMauQ5okS7eo-NL_w5uNsLw\">@thebuckboibarnes</a> </p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5QBjEbO5niGUOoQ31qyjKA\">@m-a-t-91</a> </p></p>",
