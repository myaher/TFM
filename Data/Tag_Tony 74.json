Alright, yeah, you can open them.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>So Steve does, removing his hand from his face and blinking his eyes open, gaze immediately falling on&hellip; Tony, standing in the middle of the living room in a red and white hockey jersey, <i>MIT</i> written across the front and his name and number across the back. He grins, stretching his arms out and doing a slow little spin, and this isn\u2019t exactly what Steve had in mind when Tony said he had a surprise for him, but he\u2019s definitely not complaining. <br/></p><p>Tony looks like he\u2019d fit in with any of the big league players, cocky confidence amped up to eleven, hair mussed and eyes bright, shoulders nearly as broad as Steve\u2019s now, under all that padding. <br/></p><p>\u201cI&hellip; Hi,\u201d Steve says intelligently.

It\u2019s open, the contents half-poking out, though some of it is laid out on the table haphazardly: gloves, socks, loose pucks. \u201cWell, you did say you needed to see it to believe it, so, I dug all of this out of storage. Oh! And, the \n<i>pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance</i>&hellip;\u201d Tony plucks the remote off the table, aiming it at the TV. \u201cMy highlight reel.

Imagine if the press caught wind of this. Stock would plummet.\u201d<br/></p><p>Steve just smiles and shakes his head, and when Tony drops onto the couch beside him, presses a kiss to his cheek. \u201cWell, I\u2019m honored that you\u2019d risk your hard-earned reputation to impress little ol\u2019 me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAm I? Impressing you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJury\u2019s still out,\u201d Steve teases. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta let me see you play first.\u201d <br/></p><p>As if on cue, the TV flickers to life, the grainy picture coming up. <br/></p><p>On screen, MIT wins the face-off, and the puck is quickly passed around; it takes half a minute, but it eventually reaches Tony, who glides through the opposing team and, with an effortless flick of his wrist, shoots it right over the goalie\u2019s shoulder. Grinning widely, he pulls his helmet off, and <i>god</i>, he looks so young there, clean-shaven and baby-faced, his hair grown out a little and starting to curl at the ends. He looks so happy, too, and when Steve sneaks a glance at the Tony sitting beside him, he\u2019s wearing the exact same expression, though it\u2019s a little softer, a little more nostalgic. <br/></p><p>As the tape plays on, showcasing all his greatest goals and assists, with the odd fight thrown into the mix, Tony provides his own running commentary: he tells Steve who they were playing against, where, who won. He recounts which moves landed him in the penalty box, or suspended, or with a black eye. <br/></p><p>But when they finally get to the last clip, he just pauses for a moment, blinking in disbelief, and then, suddenly, bursts out laughing. \u201cSo, full disclosure, I\u2019ve never actually watched this tape before,\u201d Tony admits, biting his lip, even though it does nothing to conceal his smile. \u201cAnd I really didn\u2019t think they\u2019d include this on here.\u201d <br/></p><p>Steve just raises a brow. \u201cWhy? What happens?\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cThis was the last game I played before I graduated, and, uh. Let\u2019s just say I wanted to go out with a bang.\u201d A beat of silence, before he adds: \u201cHave you ever seen the movie Slap Shot?\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say I have, no.\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cAh. Well, then, you\u2019re in for a real treat.\u201d <br/></p><p>But before Steve can ask what that has to do with anything, his attention is drawn back to the TV by the crowd counting down the last ten seconds of what seems to be one of the most intense games yet. The tension\u2019s almost palpable, most of the audience on the edge of their seats, and it doesn\u2019t take more than a glance at the corner of the screen to see why: it\u2019s a tie game, already in the third period. <br/></p><p>The center runs the puck down to the blue line, passes it off to the left winger, back to center, and then there\u2019s Tony, waiting by the net, and as soon as the puck reaches him, he slips it into the space between the post and the goalie\u2019s pad, just as the horn goes off to mark the end of the period. The game ends 5-4, and as the audience starts throwing their hats onto the ice, MIT\u2019s goal song \u2014 Shoot to Thrill, because of course it is\n\u2014\n\n starts blasting over the speakers. Tony does a lap around the rink, taking a bow and blowing kisses to the cheering crowd, with the same kind of showmanship that nowadays he reserves mostly for Stark Expos and various press events. He takes off his helmet, setting it down on top of MIT\u2019s net as he passes by; the gloves are next, Tony shaking them off and tossing them to the side; and then\u2014\n\n<br/></p><p>Steve blinks. \u201cAre you\u2014\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cDoing exactly what you think I\u2019m doing?\u201d Tony grins, carefree and self-assured, not even a lick of shame as he watches his younger self start to strip out of his jersey in front of the entire arena. \u201cOh yeah.\u201d <br/></p><p>Back on screen, the shoulder pads come off next, and he chucks them at one of his laughing teammates as he skates past. Everyone on the ice, including the linesmen, stop and stare as Tony, with exaggerated but practiced motions, pulls his suspenders off his shoulders and shimmies out of his pants, hips swaying from side to side. The cheers of the audience turn into whistles and playful goading, and Tony\u2019s smirking as he hoists himself up to take a seat on the opposing team\u2019s net, rolling his socks down and removing his knee pads; he does a couple kicks while he\u2019s at it, reminiscent of the USO girls\u2019 choreography, and when Tony hops back down onto the ice, he tugs off his t-shirt, slow and seductive, and flings it up into the stands. <br/></p><p>By the end of it, Tony\u2019s left in his socks, skates, and jock strap, and he manages to circle the rink one last time, giving everyone a spectacular view of his ass, before a ref finally escorts him off the ice. <br/></p><p>The tape cuts off after his standing ovation. <br/></p><p>Steve\u2019s pretty tempted to give him a standing ovation himself, but all he can really do at this point is try to will his blush away and formulate at least one coherent thought. \u201cHoly shit,\u201d is what he finally settles on. <br/></p><p>Tony laughs. \u201cSo, what\u2019d you think?\u201d he asks, lightly bumping his shoulder against Steve\u2019s. <br/></p><p>\u201cOf the hockey or the striptease?\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cBoth?\u201d <br/></p><p>There\u2019s a fond smile curling at Steve\u2019s lips when he turns to Tony. \u201cWhen you said you could play, I didn\u2019t think you meant like <i>that</i>,\u201d he admits, still a little awestruck. \u201cWatching you skate, it\u2019s like seeing you fly around in the armor. You make it look so easy.\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but add, \u201cSame goes for the strip show.\u201d <br/></p><p>It takes half a second for Tony\u2019s grin to turn into an amused smirk. \u201cOh, you liked that, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. A little.\u201d <br/></p><p>Tony leans in to steal a kiss, hand coming up to settle at the nape of Steve\u2019s neck. When he pulls back after a moment, it\u2019s to offer a wink and murmur, \u201cPlay your cards right and you might get a repeat performance.\u201d <br/></p>",

Grinning widely, he pulls his helmet off, and <i>god</i>, he looks so young there, clean-shaven and baby-faced, his hair grown out a little and starting to curl at the ends. He looks so happy, too, and when Steve sneaks a glance at the Tony sitting beside him, he\u2019s wearing the exact same expression, though it\u2019s a little softer, a little more nostalgic. <br></p><p>As the tape plays on, showcasing all his greatest goals and assists, with the odd fight thrown into the mix, Tony provides his own running commentary: he tells Steve who they were playing against, where, who won. He recounts which moves landed him in the penalty box, or suspended, or with a black eye. <br></p><p>But when they finally get to the last clip, he just pauses for a moment, blinking in disbelief, and then, suddenly, bursts out laughing. \u201cSo, full disclosure, I\u2019ve never actually watched this tape before,\u201d Tony admits, biting his lip, even though it does nothing to conceal his smile. \u201cAnd I really didn\u2019t think they\u2019d include this on here.\u201d <br></p><p>Steve just raises a brow. \u201cWhy? What happens?\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cThis was the last game I played before I graduated, and, uh. Let\u2019s just say I wanted to go out with a bang.\u201d A beat of silence, before he adds: \u201cHave you ever seen the movie Slap Shot?\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say I have, no.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cAh. Well, then, you\u2019re in for a real treat.\u201d <br></p><p>But before Steve can ask what that has to do with anything, his attention is drawn back to the TV by the crowd counting down the last ten seconds of what seems to be one of the most intense games yet. The tension\u2019s almost palpable, most of the audience on the edge of their seats, and it doesn\u2019t take more than a glance at the corner of the screen to see why: it\u2019s a tie game, already in the third period. <br></p><p>The center runs the puck down to the blue line, passes it off to the left winger, back to center, and then there\u2019s Tony, waiting by the net, and as soon as the puck reaches him, he slips it into the space between the post and the goalie\u2019s pad, just as the horn goes off to mark the end of the period. The game ends 5-4, and as the audience starts throwing their hats onto the ice, MIT\u2019s goal song \u2014 Shoot to Thrill, because of course it is\n\u2014\n\n starts blasting over the speakers. Tony does a lap around the rink, taking a bow and blowing kisses to the cheering crowd, with the same kind of showmanship that nowadays he reserves mostly for Stark Expos and various press events. He takes off his helmet, setting it down on top of MIT\u2019s net as he passes by; the gloves are next, Tony shaking them off and tossing them to the side; and then\u2014\n\n<br></p><p>Steve blinks. \u201cAre you\u2014\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cDoing exactly what you think I\u2019m doing?\u201d Tony grins, carefree and self-assured, not even a lick of shame as he watches his younger self start to strip out of his jersey in front of the entire arena. \u201cOh yeah.\u201d <br></p><p>Back on screen, the shoulder pads come off next, and he chucks them at one of his laughing teammates as he skates past. Everyone on the ice, including the linesmen, stop and stare as Tony, with exaggerated but practiced motions, pulls his suspenders off his shoulders and shimmies out of his pants, hips swaying from side to side. The cheers of the audience turn into whistles and playful goading, and Tony\u2019s smirking as he hoists himself up to take a seat on the opposing team\u2019s net, rolling his socks down and removing his knee pads; he does a couple kicks while he\u2019s at it, reminiscent of the USO girls\u2019 choreography, and when Tony hops back down onto the ice, he tugs off his t-shirt, slow and seductive, and flings it up into the stands. <br></p><p>By the end of it, Tony\u2019s left in his socks, skates, and jock strap, and he manages to circle the rink one last time, giving everyone a spectacular view of his ass, before a ref finally escorts him off the ice. <br></p><p>The tape cuts off after his standing ovation. <br></p><p>Steve\u2019s pretty tempted to give him a standing ovation himself, but all he can really do at this point is try to will his blush away and formulate at least one coherent thought. \u201cHoly shit,\u201d is what he finally settles on. <br></p><p>Tony laughs. \u201cSo, what\u2019d you think?\u201d he asks, lightly bumping his shoulder against Steve\u2019s. <br></p><p>\u201cOf the hockey or the striptease?\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cBoth?\u201d <br></p><p>There\u2019s a fond smile curling at Steve\u2019s lips when he turns to Tony. \u201cWhen you said you could play, I didn\u2019t think you meant like <i>that</i>,\u201d he admits, still a little awestruck. \u201cWatching you skate, it\u2019s like seeing you fly around in the armor. You make it look so easy.\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but add, \u201cSame goes for the strip show.\u201d <br></p><p>It takes half a second for Tony\u2019s grin to turn into an amused smirk. \u201cOh, you liked that, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. A little.\u201d <br></p><p>Tony leans in to steal a kiss, hand coming up to settle at the nape of Steve\u2019s neck. When he pulls back after a moment, it\u2019s to offer a wink and murmur, \u201cPlay your cards right and you might get a repeat performance.\u201d <br></p>",

Alright, yeah, you can open them.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>So Steve does, removing his hand from his face and blinking his eyes open, gaze immediately falling on\u2026 Tony, standing in the middle of the living room in a red and white hockey jersey, <i>MIT</i> written across the front and his name and number across the back. He grins, stretching his arms out and doing a slow little spin, and this isn\u2019t exactly what Steve had in mind when Tony said he had a surprise for him, but he\u2019s definitely not complaining. <br></p><p>Tony looks like he\u2019d fit in with any of the big league players, cocky confidence amped up to eleven, hair mussed and eyes bright, shoulders nearly as broad as Steve\u2019s now, under all that padding. <br></p><p>\u201cI\u2026 Hi,\u201d Steve says intelligently.

Oh! And, the \n<i>pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance</i>\u2026\u201d Tony plucks the remote off the table, aiming it at the TV. \u201cMy highlight reel.

He takes off his helmet, setting it down on top of MIT&rsquo;s net as he passes by; the gloves are next, Tony shaking them off and tossing them to the side; and then&mdash;\n\n<br /></p><p>Steve blinks. &ldquo;Are you&mdash;&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Doing exactly what you think I&rsquo;m doing?&rdquo; Tony grins, carefree and self-assured, not even a lick of shame as he watches his younger self start to strip out of his jersey in front of the entire arena. &ldquo;Oh yeah.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>Back on screen, the shoulder pads come off next, and he chucks them at one of his laughing teammates as he skates past. Everyone on the ice, including the linesmen, stop and stare as Tony, with exaggerated but practiced motions, pulls his suspenders off his shoulders and shimmies out of his pants, hips swaying from side to side. The cheers of the audience turn into whistles and playful goading, and Tony&rsquo;s smirking as he hoists himself up to take a seat on the opposing team&rsquo;s net, rolling his socks down and removing his knee pads; he does a couple kicks while he&rsquo;s at it, reminiscent of the USO girls&rsquo; choreography, and when Tony hops back down onto the ice, he tugs off his t-shirt, slow and seductive, and flings it up into the stands. <br /></p><p>By the end of it, Tony&rsquo;s left in his socks, skates, and jock strap, and he manages to circle the rink one last time, giving everyone a spectacular view of his ass, before a ref finally escorts him off the ice. <br /></p><p>The tape cuts off after his standing ovation. <br /></p><p>Steve&rsquo;s pretty tempted to give him a standing ovation himself, but all he can really do at this point is try to will his blush away and formulate at least one coherent thought. &ldquo;Holy shit,&rdquo; is what he finally settles on. <br /></p><p>Tony laughs. &ldquo;So, what&rsquo;d you think?&rdquo; he asks, lightly bumping his shoulder against Steve&rsquo;s. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Of the hockey or the striptease?&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Both?&rdquo; <br /></p><p>There&rsquo;s a fond smile curling at Steve&rsquo;s lips when he turns to Tony. &ldquo;When you said you could play, I didn&rsquo;t think you meant like <i>that</i>,&rdquo; he admits, still a little awestruck. &ldquo;Watching you skate, it&rsquo;s like seeing you fly around in the armor. You make it look so easy.&rdquo; He couldn&rsquo;t help but add, &ldquo;Same goes for the strip show.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>It takes half a second for Tony&rsquo;s grin to turn into an amused smirk. &ldquo;Oh, you liked that, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe. A little.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>Tony leans in to steal a kiss, hand coming up to settle at the nape of Steve&rsquo;s neck. When he pulls back after a moment, it&rsquo;s to offer a wink and murmur, &ldquo;Play your cards right and you might get a repeat performance.&rdquo; <br /></p>",

        "body": "<p>\n<b>Here\u2019s some fun and fluff with Peter, Cap and a worried Irondad, based on this prompt:</b><i> <br/></i></p><p><i>Fighting off the latest alien invasion followed by an attack by Doom Bots was bad enough on the Avengers without two of their main players passing out for no apparent reason AKA when Cap and Spidey go 36 hours without eating while having overly heightened metabolisms. <br/></i></p><p><i>\nThank you to my beta <a></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTH6HMWIcnj5tQYHdqftOLQ\">@whumphoarder</a>\u200b for putting so much effort into this fic!</i></p><hr><p>\u201cI need a cheeseburger,\u201d Tony announces the moment Steve opens the door of the temporary shelter. \u201cA big, greasy cheeseburger, two litres of coffee, and a few months of vacation on the Virgin Islands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you&rsquo;ve come to the wrong place,\u201d Steve replies in a tired voice while following Tony back inside. \u201cThe bots destroyed our food storage. Even the granola bars melted.\u201d The supersoldier grins a little, but his face is gray from exhaustion. He looks even worse than Tony feels. </p><p>\u201cYou good there, old man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, just\u2026\u201d Steve raises his arms in a gesture of defeat, indicating the destruction around them of what was once the parking lot of an amusement park. </p><p>The Doom Bots did their job thoroughly. Being outnumbered as they were, the team was forced to spread out, so Tony took the kid with him to hunt down the Bots at the other end of the district. It didn\u2019t help that the bots chose to enter just after the Avengers had successfully defeated an invasion of relatively dumb but highly explosive frog-like beings from outer space. </p><p>Tony stayed behind to supervise the clean-up while Steve did the same at the other end of town. That was more than a day ago, Tony realises with sudden clarity. No wonder Cap looked tired.</p><p>\u201cAre <i>you</i> okay?\u201d Steve asks, eyeing the scratches and dents in the Iron Man armour.</p><p>Tony is reeling from exertion, every single joint aching. His right wrist is swollen to twice its normal size and there are more scratches and bruises on him than he wants to count (although Friday had counted them, much to his dismay). But truth is, he has seen much worse fights, and 36 hours without sleep is far from his personal record.</p><p>\u201cAlways, always,\u201d he replies reassuringly.</p><p>Tony enters the shelter, just to stop dead upon seeing a familiar figure dressed in a red-and-blue spandex suit. </p><p>The eyes of Peter\u2019s mask go wide upon seeing Tony. \u201cOh, shit,\u201d he mumbles.</p><p>Tony feels his face go tight. \u201c<i>What on earth</i> are you doing here?\u201d he demands.</p><p>\u201cUhm\u2026\u201d The mask retreats, revealing a clearly exhausted Peter looking sheepishly back at his mentor.</p><p>\u201cHe helped with the clean-up,\u201d Steve intervenes. \u201cWithout him, I\u2019d still be stuck in a heap of rubble, trying to excavate a police car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent him home to sleep <i>yesterday</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me that you had asked him to come here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t bother to check with me?\u201d Tony exclaims angrily. \u201cYou know we <i>do </i>have radios now, right? Modern communication, Cap, we\u2019re not in the goddamn 1930s anymore!\u201d </p><p>He knows that it isn\u2019t technically Steve&rsquo;s fault that Peter snuck back to the battlefield, but Tony\u2019s worry and frustration are reaching a breaking point. And Captain Almighty had always been a good target to let off some steam.</p><p>\u201cHow was I to know he wasn\u2019t supposed to be here? Honestly, I was glad for any help I could get -it didn\u2019t occur to me I\u2019d have to double-check!\u201d Steve protests. </p><p>\u201cUhm&hellip;I\u2019m really, really sorry, but, could we maybe argue about this later?\u201d Peter asks in a small voice. \u201cUm, I&rsquo;m not&hellip;feeling so great.\u201d <br/></p><p>Tony spins around. The boy is visibly swaying on his feet, colour draining rapidly from his face.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Tony is at his side in a few steps, grabbing him by the shoulders and guiding him down to sit on the ground. \u201cJust what we need right now. What&rsquo;s wrong? Where did you get hit?\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cPlease don&rsquo;t be mad at me,\u201d Peter whispers, blinking rapidly with unfocused eyes. He actually looks a little bit scared, which only increases Tony\u2019s concern.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s gonna be decided later,\u201d Tony declares. \u201cBut I definitely will be if you don&rsquo;t tell me what&rsquo;s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&hellip;haven\u2019t eaten anything&hellip;for a while, I think.\u201d Peter starts listing to one side, his eyes drooping.</p><p>Tony curses quietly. He keeps Peter upright with one arm and waves at Steve with the other. \u201cCheck the back room for food,\u201d he orders. \u201cBruce always keeps emergency supplies in his locker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Steve replies, his voice strangely off. </p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes have drifted shut. \u201cHey, stay awake with me, kid,\u201d Tony urges, tapping on the boy\u2019s cheek. \u201cSpangles?\u201d he calls to the back room, \u201cYou found anything?\u201d</p><p>The only reply is a loud thump. </p><p>\u201cWhat on earth\u2026\u201d Tony says under his breath. </p><p>\u201cSir, it appears that Captain Rogers has lost consciousness,\u201d FRIDAY\u2019s voice informs him from his suit. Even she sounds beat. \u201cIt appears that he is suffering from hypoglycemia, similar to Mr. Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is this my life?\u201d Tony mutters. \u201cCall medical, I need a babysitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready done, sir. Let me also inform you that the first aid kit located under the chair to your right contains glucose tablets.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAt least that\u2019s something,\u201d Tony mumbles, reaching for the kit. He spies a half-empty bottle of Coke on the ground and reaches for it gratefully.</p><p>\u201cHey, kid. Open up.\u201d He nudges the bottle against Peter\u2019s lips. It takes a few attempts until the boy focuses on Tony with a low moan.</p><p>\u201cDon&rsquo;t wanna\u2026don\u2019t feel good,\u201d Peter slurs.</p><p>\u201cYeah, nausea is normal at this point. But that wasn\u2019t a question. Drink.\u201d He lets Peter take a few sips before pushing one of the glucose tabs into his mouth.</p><p>Peter swallows, then gulps, his sweaty face contorting in obvious discomfort.\u201c&rsquo;M gonna be sick,\u201d he manages.</p><p>\u201cOkay, hold on,\u201d Tony sighs. He locates a plastic bag in the mess inside the shelter and holds it open under Peter\u2019s chin. The kid takes a few shallow breaths before retching weakly. He brings up a mouthful of foul-smelling liquid.</p><p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d Peter moans. He coughs a few more times, spraying watery bile over the bag and both of their suits. </p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s okay. You&rsquo;ll be okay, kid,\u201d Tony reassures. \u201cI know you\u2019re feeling sick, but you need to keep trying to drink something.\u201d He offers the bottle again. </p><p>\u201c&rsquo;M not done yet.\u201d Peter bends over the bag and heaves drily. A trickle of bile runs into the receptacle. </p><p>\u201cThere&rsquo;s nothing left in you,\u201d Tony assures. \u201cYou&rsquo;re just nauseous because your blood sugar is tanking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Oww.\u201d Peter wipes his mouth with a shaky hand and slumps back against the wall, his eyes fluttering shut. </p><p>\u201cDon&rsquo;t you pass out on me,\u201d Tony commands, his tone tinged with worry. He doesn&rsquo;t want to leave Peter, but he knows that he has to look after Steve at some point. </p><p>\u201cHold on, okay?\u201d He picks back up the bottle of Coke and presses it into Peter&rsquo;s hand, making sure the boy is conscious. \u201cKeep sipping, slowly.\u201d</p><p>Peter gives a tiny nod, his eyes following Tony\u2019s movements sluggishly. Tony makes sure that his proteg\u00e8 is stable in the corner and won&rsquo;t hit anything in case he does pass out, then goes to rouse the supersoldier. </p><p>Steve is out cold, but at least he only fell against a leather chair and didn\u2019t hit his head on anything hard. It\u2019s tempting to just let him lie there and focus on the kid until the med team arrives, but Tony knows that the longer his enhanced metabolism stays without food, the more danger he is in. </p><p>When a few attempts of calling his name and lightly shaking his shoulder don\u2019t yield any results, Tony goes for the proverbial cold water approach, splashing handfuls of it onto the supersoldier\u2019s face. Upon the third attempt, Steve rouses with a moan. </p><p>\u201cHey, Sleeping Beauty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUff,\u201d Steve groans, squinting. \u201cI did something embarrassing, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d Tony confirms, popping the p. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know it was possible for you to pass out. Wish I had it on film.\u201d </p><p>He quickly strides over to Bruce\u2019s locker and blows it open it with a small blast from his gauntlet that makes Steve flinch. Not strictly necessary, but Tony\u2019s definitely at the end of his patience for today and blowing things up feels like an appropriate reaction. In the locker, he finds a yoga mat, a yo-yo, and a walkman (<i>seriously,</i> Bruce?), a couple of organic lemonades, and three equally healthy energy bars. Bingo.</p><p>Tony helps Steve sit up enough so that he can swallow some of the drink. He pushes it away after the second sip, clearly nauseous. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare puke on my suit,\u201d Tony warns. </p><p>\u201cWhat, only the kid\u2019s allowed to do that?\u201d Steve chuckles weakly, nodding at the stains of bile on Tony\u2019s armour. He takes a few deep breaths before trying another sip. \u201cHow long was I out?\u201d </p><p>\u201cCouple of minutes. Medics are on their way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Peter okay?\u201d Steve asks, clearly guilty.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026lucky for him, <i>someone</i> was there to look after him instead of making him work harder.\u201d Tony\u2019s anger is slowly ebbing away, but he doesn\u2019t regret when it comes out a little cross.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Steve offers genuinely.

What\u2019s wrong? Where did you get hit?\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t be mad at me,\u201d Peter whispers, blinking rapidly with unfocused eyes. He actually looks a little bit scared, which only increases Tony\u2019s concern.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s gonna be decided later,\u201d Tony declares. \u201cBut I definitely will be if you don\u2019t tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026haven\u2019t eaten anything\u2026for a while, I think.\u201d Peter starts listing to one side, his eyes drooping.</p><p>Tony curses quietly. He keeps Peter upright with one arm and waves at Steve with the other. \u201cCheck the back room for food,\u201d he orders. \u201cBruce always keeps emergency supplies in his locker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Steve replies, his voice strangely off. </p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes have drifted shut. \u201cHey, stay awake with me, kid,\u201d Tony urges, tapping on the boy\u2019s cheek. \u201cSpangles?\u201d he calls to the back room, \u201cYou found anything?\u201d</p><p>The only reply is a loud thump. </p><p>\u201cWhat on earth\u2026\u201d Tony says under his breath. </p><p>\u201cSir, it appears that Captain Rogers has lost consciousness,\u201d FRIDAY\u2019s voice informs him from his suit. Even she sounds beat. \u201cIt appears that he is suffering from hypoglycemia, similar to Mr. Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is this my life?\u201d Tony mutters. \u201cCall medical, I need a babysitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready done, sir. Let me also inform you that the first aid kit located under the chair to your right contains glucose tablets.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAt least that\u2019s something,\u201d Tony mumbles, reaching for the kit. He spies a half-empty bottle of Coke on the ground and reaches for it gratefully.</p><p>\u201cHey, kid. Open up.\u201d He nudges the bottle against Peter\u2019s lips. It takes a few attempts until the boy focuses on Tony with a low moan.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t wanna\u2026don\u2019t feel good,\u201d Peter slurs.</p><p>\u201cYeah, nausea is normal at this point. But that wasn\u2019t a question. Drink.\u201d He lets Peter take a few sips before pushing one of the glucose tabs into his mouth.</p><p>Peter swallows, then gulps, his sweaty face contorting in obvious discomfort.\u201c\u2019M gonna be sick,\u201d he manages.</p><p>\u201cOkay, hold on,\u201d Tony sighs. He locates a plastic bag in the mess inside the shelter and holds it open under Peter\u2019s chin. The kid takes a few shallow breaths before retching weakly. He brings up a mouthful of foul-smelling liquid.</p><p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d Peter moans. He coughs a few more times, spraying watery bile over the bag and both of their suits. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019ll be okay, kid,\u201d Tony reassures. \u201cI know you\u2019re feeling sick, but you need to keep trying to drink something.\u201d He offers the bottle again. </p><p>\u201c\u2019M not done yet.\u201d Peter bends over the bag and heaves drily. A trickle of bile runs into the receptacle. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing left in you,\u201d Tony assures. \u201cYou\u2019re just nauseous because your blood sugar is tanking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Oww.\u201d Peter wipes his mouth with a shaky hand and slumps back against the wall, his eyes fluttering shut. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you pass out on me,\u201d Tony commands, his tone tinged with worry. He doesn\u2019t want to leave Peter, but he knows that he has to look after Steve at some point. </p><p>\u201cHold on, okay?\u201d He picks back up the bottle of Coke and presses it into Peter\u2019s hand, making sure the boy is conscious. \u201cKeep sipping, slowly.\u201d</p><p>Peter gives a tiny nod, his eyes following Tony\u2019s movements sluggishly. Tony makes sure that his proteg\u00e8 is stable in the corner and won\u2019t hit anything in case he does pass out, then goes to rouse the supersoldier. </p><p>Steve is out cold, but at least he only fell against a leather chair and didn\u2019t hit his head on anything hard. It\u2019s tempting to just let him lie there and focus on the kid until the med team arrives, but Tony knows that the longer his enhanced metabolism stays without food, the more danger he is in. </p><p>When a few attempts of calling his name and lightly shaking his shoulder don\u2019t yield any results, Tony goes for the proverbial cold water approach, splashing handfuls of it onto the supersoldier\u2019s face. Upon the third attempt, Steve rouses with a moan. </p><p>\u201cHey, Sleeping Beauty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUff,\u201d Steve groans, squinting. \u201cI did something embarrassing, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d Tony confirms, popping the p. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know it was possible for you to pass out. Wish I had it on film.\u201d </p><p>He quickly strides over to Bruce\u2019s locker and blows it open it with a small blast from his gauntlet that makes Steve flinch. Not strictly necessary, but Tony\u2019s definitely at the end of his patience for today and blowing things up feels like an appropriate reaction. In the locker, he finds a yoga mat, a yo-yo, and a walkman (<i>seriously,</i> Bruce?), a couple of organic lemonades, and three equally healthy energy bars. Bingo.</p><p>Tony helps Steve sit up enough so that he can swallow some of the drink. He pushes it away after the second sip, clearly nauseous. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare puke on my suit,\u201d Tony warns. </p><p>\u201cWhat, only the kid\u2019s allowed to do that?\u201d Steve chuckles weakly, nodding at the stains of bile on Tony\u2019s armour. He takes a few deep breaths before trying another sip. \u201cHow long was I out?\u201d </p><p>\u201cCouple of minutes. Medics are on their way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Peter okay?\u201d Steve asks, clearly guilty.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026lucky for him, <i>someone</i> was there to look after him instead of making him work harder.\u201d Tony\u2019s anger is slowly ebbing away, but he doesn\u2019t regret when it comes out a little cross.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Steve offers genuinely. He tries to sit up, but Tony pushes him back down, wincing when he jostles his injured arm in the process. </p><p>\u201cYou stay put until we get medical assistance. Not gonna wake you up again.\u201d</p><p>He drops one of the energy bars into Steve\u2019s lap and then returns to check on Peter. The boy is still pale as a ghost and seems to have sort of melted into his corner, but at least he has finished the soft drink and is looking a bit more alert than he was before.</p><p>\u201cHey, you back with me?\u201d Tony inquires, letting himself fall down on the floor in a not exactly elegant manner. </p><p>The kid hums in agreement. \u201cHow\u2019s Captain Rogers?\u201d he asks, sounding concerned.</p><p>\u201cStill alive, unfortunately.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey, I heard that!\u201d Steve calls out from the back room. Peter laughs lightly.</p><p>Tony opens one of the energy bars and breaks off a piece to offer to the kid. \u201cSo, care to explain why you disobeyed my direct order - suggestion - and came here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was gonna go home, but then I realised that May would be working overtime at the hospital because of the attack, and I lost my key somewhere in the battle, and then I thought I\u2019d be more useful helping with the clean-up than sitting in front of my own door-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me that Spider-Man needs a key to get into his own apartment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe?\u201d Peter blinks up at him, all innocence and puppy eyes. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think for a minute that you\u2019re getting away with that.

Instead, he shifts his position so that he is leaning against the wall next to Peter.

His right wrist is swollen to twice its normal size and there are more scratches and bruises on him than he wants to count (although Friday had counted them, much to his dismay). But truth is, he has seen much worse fights, and 36 hours without sleep is far from his personal record.</p><p>\u201cAlways, always,\u201d he replies reassuringly.</p><p>Tony enters the shelter, just to stop dead upon seeing a familiar figure dressed in a red-and-blue spandex suit. </p><p>The eyes of Peter\u2019s mask go wide upon seeing Tony. \u201cOh, shit,\u201d he mumbles.</p><p>Tony feels his face go tight. \u201c<i>What on earth</i> are you doing here?\u201d he demands.</p><p>\u201cUhm\u2026\u201d The mask retreats, revealing a clearly exhausted Peter looking sheepishly back at his mentor.</p><p>\u201cHe helped with the clean-up,\u201d Steve intervenes. \u201cWithout him, I\u2019d still be stuck in a heap of rubble, trying to excavate a police car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent him home to sleep <i>yesterday</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me that you had asked him to come here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t bother to check with me?\u201d Tony exclaims angrily. \u201cYou know we <i>do </i>have radios now, right? Modern communication, Cap, we\u2019re not in the goddamn 1930s anymore!\u201d </p><p>He knows that it isn\u2019t technically Steve\u2019s fault that Peter snuck back to the battlefield, but Tony\u2019s worry and frustration are reaching a breaking point. And Captain Almighty had always been a good target to let off some steam.</p><p>\u201cHow was I to know he wasn\u2019t supposed to be here? Honestly, I was glad for any help I could get -it didn\u2019t occur to me I\u2019d have to double-check!\u201d Steve protests. </p><p>\u201cUhm\u2026I\u2019m really, really sorry, but, could we maybe argue about this later?\u201d Peter asks in a small voice. \u201cUm, I\u2019m not\u2026feeling so great.\u201d <br></p><p>Tony spins around. The boy is visibly swaying on his feet, colour draining rapidly from his face.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Tony is at his side in a few steps, grabbing him by the shoulders and guiding him down to sit on the ground. \u201cJust what we need right now. What\u2019s wrong? Where did you get hit?\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t be mad at me,\u201d Peter whispers, blinking rapidly with unfocused eyes. He actually looks a little bit scared, which only increases Tony\u2019s concern.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s gonna be decided later,\u201d Tony declares. \u201cBut I definitely will be if you don\u2019t tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026haven\u2019t eaten anything\u2026for a while, I think.\u201d Peter starts listing to one side, his eyes drooping.</p><p>Tony curses quietly. He keeps Peter upright with one arm and waves at Steve with the other. \u201cCheck the back room for food,\u201d he orders. \u201cBruce always keeps emergency supplies in his locker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Steve replies, his voice strangely off. </p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes have drifted shut. \u201cHey, stay awake with me, kid,\u201d Tony urges, tapping on the boy\u2019s cheek. \u201cSpangles?\u201d he calls to the back room, \u201cYou found anything?\u201d</p><p>The only reply is a loud thump. </p><p>\u201cWhat on earth\u2026\u201d Tony says under his breath. </p><p>\u201cSir, it appears that Captain Rogers has lost consciousness,\u201d FRIDAY\u2019s voice informs him from his suit. Even she sounds beat. \u201cIt appears that he is suffering from hypoglycemia, similar to Mr. Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is this my life?\u201d Tony mutters. \u201cCall medical, I need a babysitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready done, sir. Let me also inform you that the first aid kit located under the chair to your right contains glucose tablets.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAt least that\u2019s something,\u201d Tony mumbles, reaching for the kit. He spies a half-empty bottle of Coke on the ground and reaches for it gratefully.</p><p>\u201cHey, kid. Open up.\u201d He nudges the bottle against Peter\u2019s lips. It takes a few attempts until the boy focuses on Tony with a low moan.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t wanna\u2026don\u2019t feel good,\u201d Peter slurs.</p><p>\u201cYeah, nausea is normal at this point. But that wasn\u2019t a question. Drink.\u201d He lets Peter take a few sips before pushing one of the glucose tabs into his mouth.</p><p>Peter swallows, then gulps, his sweaty face contorting in obvious discomfort.\u201c\u2019M gonna be sick,\u201d he manages.</p><p>\u201cOkay, hold on,\u201d Tony sighs. He locates a plastic bag in the mess inside the shelter and holds it open under Peter\u2019s chin. The kid takes a few shallow breaths before retching weakly. He brings up a mouthful of foul-smelling liquid.</p><p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d Peter moans. He coughs a few more times, spraying watery bile over the bag and both of their suits. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019ll be okay, kid,\u201d Tony reassures. \u201cI know you\u2019re feeling sick, but you need to keep trying to drink something.\u201d He offers the bottle again. </p><p>\u201c\u2019M not done yet.\u201d Peter bends over the bag and heaves drily. A trickle of bile runs into the receptacle. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing left in you,\u201d Tony assures. \u201cYou\u2019re just nauseous because your blood sugar is tanking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Oww.\u201d Peter wipes his mouth with a shaky hand and slumps back against the wall, his eyes fluttering shut. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you pass out on me,\u201d Tony commands, his tone tinged with worry. He doesn\u2019t want to leave Peter, but he knows that he has to look after Steve at some point. </p><p>\u201cHold on, okay?\u201d He picks back up the bottle of Coke and presses it into Peter\u2019s hand, making sure the boy is conscious. \u201cKeep sipping, slowly.\u201d</p><p>Peter gives a tiny nod, his eyes following Tony\u2019s movements sluggishly. Tony makes sure that his proteg\u00e8 is stable in the corner and won\u2019t hit anything in case he does pass out, then goes to rouse the supersoldier. </p><p>Steve is out cold, but at least he only fell against a leather chair and didn\u2019t hit his head on anything hard. It\u2019s tempting to just let him lie there and focus on the kid until the med team arrives, but Tony knows that the longer his enhanced metabolism stays without food, the more danger he is in. </p><p>When a few attempts of calling his name and lightly shaking his shoulder don\u2019t yield any results, Tony goes for the proverbial cold water approach, splashing handfuls of it onto the supersoldier\u2019s face. Upon the third attempt, Steve rouses with a moan. </p><p>\u201cHey, Sleeping Beauty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUff,\u201d Steve groans, squinting. \u201cI did something embarrassing, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d Tony confirms, popping the p. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know it was possible for you to pass out. Wish I had it on film.\u201d </p><p>He quickly strides over to Bruce\u2019s locker and blows it open it with a small blast from his gauntlet that makes Steve flinch. Not strictly necessary, but Tony\u2019s definitely at the end of his patience for today and blowing things up feels like an appropriate reaction. In the locker, he finds a yoga mat, a yo-yo, and a walkman (<i>seriously,</i> Bruce?), a couple of organic lemonades, and three equally healthy energy bars. Bingo.</p><p>Tony helps Steve sit up enough so that he can swallow some of the drink. He pushes it away after the second sip, clearly nauseous. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare puke on my suit,\u201d Tony warns. </p><p>\u201cWhat, only the kid\u2019s allowed to do that?\u201d Steve chuckles weakly, nodding at the stains of bile on Tony\u2019s armour. He takes a few deep breaths before trying another sip. \u201cHow long was I out?\u201d </p><p>\u201cCouple of minutes. Medics are on their way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Peter okay?\u201d Steve asks, clearly guilty.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026lucky for him, <i>someone</i> was there to look after him instead of making him work harder.\u201d Tony\u2019s anger is slowly ebbing away, but he doesn\u2019t regret when it comes out a little cross.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Steve offers genuinely. He tries to sit up, but Tony pushes him back down, wincing when he jostles his injured arm in the process. </p><p>\u201cYou stay put until we get medical assistance. Not gonna wake you up again.\u201d</p><p>He drops one of the energy bars into Steve\u2019s lap and then returns to check on Peter. The boy is still pale as a ghost and seems to have sort of melted into his corner, but at least he has finished the soft drink and is looking a bit more alert than he was before.</p><p>\u201cHey, you back with me?\u201d Tony inquires, letting himself fall down on the floor in a not exactly elegant manner. </p><p>The kid hums in agreement. \u201cHow\u2019s Captain Rogers?\u201d he asks, sounding concerned.</p><p>\u201cStill alive, unfortunately.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey, I heard that!\u201d Steve calls out from the back room. Peter laughs lightly.</p><p>Tony opens one of the energy bars and breaks off a piece to offer to the kid. \u201cSo, care to explain why you disobeyed my direct order - suggestion - and came here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was gonna go home, but then I realised that May would be working overtime at the hospital because of the attack, and I lost my key somewhere in the battle, and then I thought I\u2019d be more useful helping with the clean-up than sitting in front of my own door-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me that Spider-Man needs a key to get into his own apartment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe?\u201d Peter blinks up at him, all innocence and puppy eyes. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think for a minute that you\u2019re getting away with that. We\u2019re gonna have a talk, once you stop looking like you\u2019re gonna faint any minute and I am out of danger of dying from a heart attack.\u201d Tony clutches one hand to his chest dramatically. \u201cFriday, when are the medics coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cETA four minutes and 30 seconds, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Tony should probably check on Steve, but his muscles vehemently protest any attempt to get up again. Instead, he shifts his position so that he is leaning against the wall next to Peter. The boy lets his head sink onto Tony\u2019s metal-clad shoulder with a yawn. </p><p>\u201cDo you know what?\u201d he mumbles. \u201cToday I pulled Captain America out of a rubble pile\u2026Wish I could tell that to my classmates.\u201d </p><p>That, finally, makes Tony grin. <br></p><p><i><a href=\"https://xxx-cat-xxx.tumblr.com/Myfics\">Link to all my fics</a><br></i></p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"370\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/49caed431b0a5f23450611541033d406/tumblr_inline_pq1ot4cCUN1ugw0uj_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"370\"></figure></p>",

                "content_abstract": "<p>\n\n<p>\n<b>Here&rsquo;s some fun and fluff with Peter, Cap and a worried Irondad, based on this prompt:</b><i> <br /></i></p>\n<p><i>Fighting off the latest alien invasion followed by an attack by Doom Bots was bad enough on the Avengers without two of their main players passing out for no apparent reason AKA when Cap and Spidey go 36 hours without eating while having overly heightened metabolisms. <br /></i></p>\n<p><i>\nThank you to my beta <a></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTH6HMWIcnj5tQYHdqftOLQ\">@whumphoarder</a>&#8203; for putting so much effort into this fic!</i></p>\n<hr />\n<p>&ldquo;I need a cheeseburger,&rdquo; Tony announces the moment Steve opens the door of the temporary shelter. &ldquo;A big, greasy cheeseburger, two litres of coffee, and a few months of vacation on the Virgin Islands.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve come to the wrong place,&rdquo; Steve replies in a tired voice while following Tony back inside. &ldquo;The bots destroyed our food storage. Even the granola bars melted.&rdquo; The supersoldier grins a little, but his face is gray from exhaustion. He looks even worse than Tony feels. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;You good there, old man?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah, just&hellip;&rdquo; Steve raises his arms in a gesture of defeat, indicating the destruction around them of what was once the parking lot of an amusement park. </p>\n<p>The Doom Bots did their job thoroughly. Being outnumbered as they were, the team was forced to spread out, so Tony took the kid with him to hunt down the Bots at the other end of the district. It didn&rsquo;t help that the bots chose to enter just after the Avengers had successfully defeated an invasion of relatively dumb but highly explosive frog-like beings from outer space. </p>\n<p>Tony stayed behind to supervise the clean-up while Steve did the same at the other end of town. That was more than a day ago, Tony realises with sudden clarity. No wonder Cap looked tired.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Are <i>you</i> okay?&rdquo; Steve asks, eyeing the scratches and dents in the Iron Man armour.</p>\n<p>Tony is reeling from exertion, every single joint aching. His right wrist is swollen to twice its normal size and there are more scratches and bruises on him than he wants to count (although Friday had counted them, much to his dismay). But truth is, he has seen much worse fights, and 36 hours without sleep is far from his personal record.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Always, always,&rdquo; he replies reassuringly.</p>\n<p>Tony enters the shelter, just to stop dead upon seeing a familiar figure dressed in a red-and-blue spandex suit. </p>\n<p>The eyes of Peter&rsquo;s mask go wide upon seeing Tony. &ldquo;Oh, shit,&rdquo; he mumbles.</p>\n<p>Tony feels his face go tight. &ldquo;<i>What on earth</i> are you doing here?&rdquo; he demands.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Uhm&hellip;&rdquo; The mask retreats, revealing a clearly exhausted Peter looking sheepishly back at his mentor.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He helped with the clean-up,&rdquo; Steve intervenes. &ldquo;Without him, I&rsquo;d still be stuck in a heap of rubble, trying to excavate a police car.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I sent him home to sleep <i>yesterday</i>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He told me that you had asked him to come here!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t bother to check with me?&rdquo; Tony exclaims angrily. &ldquo;You know we <i>do </i>have radios now, right? Modern communication, Cap, we&rsquo;re not in the goddamn 1930s anymore!&rdquo; </p>\n<p>He knows that it isn&rsquo;t technically Steve&rsquo;s fault that Peter snuck back to the battlefield, but Tony&rsquo;s worry and frustration are reaching a breaking point. And Captain Almighty had always been a good target to let off some steam.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;How was I to know he wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be here? Honestly, I was glad for any help I could get -it didn&rsquo;t occur to me I&rsquo;d have to double-check!&rdquo; Steve protests. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Uhm&hellip;I&rsquo;m really, really sorry, but, could we maybe argue about this later?&rdquo; Peter asks in a small voice. &ldquo;Um, I&rsquo;m not&hellip;feeling so great.&rdquo; <br /></p>\n<p>Tony spins around. The boy is visibly swaying on his feet, colour draining rapidly from his face.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Shit.&rdquo; Tony is at his side in a few steps, grabbing him by the shoulders and guiding him down to sit on the ground. &ldquo;Just what we need right now. What&rsquo;s wrong? Where did you get hit?&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",
