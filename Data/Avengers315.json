Things had changed. It was 2 years after the war, the world was still healing&hellip;..the Avengers were still healing. You hadn&rsquo;t known Steve as long as the others, Tony recruited you to the team a few months after Steve had gone rogue. He was how you met the love of your life. The rest pretend like his death didn&rsquo;t faze them as much, Tony drinks a lot more now, you could here Natasha sobs through her rooms thin walls, Thor doesn&rsquo;t like walking by steves door and Sam can&rsquo;t listen to any of the music he used to love without thinking of him. But the one who hurt the most was bucky.</p><p>&ldquo;Till the end of the line.&rdquo;</p><p>They were supposed to go together, steves last moments replay in his head over and over again.\u00a0<i>The Quinn-jet was shot down by an alien enemy and landed hard on the cliff that Steve was standing on, a large piece of the cliff fell into the ravine and Steve fell with it.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>It all started and ended with a fall.</i></p><p>You helped bucky as much as you could. Long nights of drinking tea or cocoa because he was afraid to sleep, random tears would erupt from his eyes when his mind drifted to it. He always called you Ingerul meu (my angel in Romanian) because you somehow saved him, emotionally. You were the light of his darkness, happiness and hope just followed you around. Tony wanted the name <b>Captain America</b> to live on in a way of honoring Steve and everything he believed in. Not that Steve could be replaced, his shield needed to be passed not to someone exactly like Steve but someone who has the same morals. Many names crossed Tony&rsquo;s mind but then he thought; <i>this isn&rsquo;t a matter of what he wants but of what Steve would&rsquo;ve wanted.\u00a0</i>Then it came to him&hellip;when Steve was in his darkest the one thing he was missing was his best friend.</p><p>Bucky.</p><p>You heard the loud creak of the roof&rsquo;s rusty metal doors open and the sounds of boots padding against the gravel. His arms snake around you leather-clad waist as he placed a soft kiss beneath your ear. &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; he let go and sat down on the floor, his back pressed against the edge of the roof. Your gloved finger grazed over the Captain America trading card Colson had given to you. &ldquo;Better than ever.&rdquo; He sighed and looked at the ground. Bucky had on the cap suit that Colson designed, it was similar to steves except the arms had black sleeves/bottoms and red gloves to still resemble bucky. He had the shield attached to the back of his suit, it was the same shield Steve had; they had retrieved it along with his body. &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; you sat next to him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m ready for this Y/n.&rdquo; he shook his head. &ldquo;Hey stop doubting yourself, your gonna be great, okay. I promise.&rdquo; You took his hand in yours and squeezed it.</p><p>\u00a0&quot;There are so many other people I can think of that deserve his place&hellip;Why me? I&rsquo;ve murdered people, I don&rsquo;t deserve to be their hero.&ldquo; His voice cracked slightly. &quot;Because your his best friend James, there is nobody he trusts more or has more faith in than you, he would be so proud of you. All the things you did wasn&rsquo;t you that was the winter soldier.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What if I mess up.&rdquo; his icy eyes looked into yours.</p><p>&ldquo;Just be your self, be James Buchanan Barnes, be the man I fell in love with, be the guy who fought for freedom, be the guy who was strong enough to represent his best friend no matter how much it pains him. Be Bucky.&rdquo; You said in almost a whisper as you hand him the trading card. &ldquo;He still looks better in the uniform.&rdquo; You both laughed. &ldquo;Now come on we have bad guys to fight, buildings to jump off of and other super heroly things to do.&rdquo; You jumped to your feet and thrust your hand out to him. He takes after slipping the card into a small pocket.

I saw her nod slowly, a confused expression coming across her face.</p><p>\u201cHow did we meet?\u201dI asked, a short silence filling the room as she scanned my eyes; the confusion still evident on her face.</p><p>\u201cWe met at Hydra,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cBut where in Hydra did we meet?\u201d I asked,moving closer to her.  The first day that I met Y/N/N was when she was put in cell next to mine&hellip;she was crying; wanting the pain from her injuries to stop. She had to remember that. I looked at her, scanning her yes in a hope to see her remembering. There was a long silence as Y/N/N stared back into my eyes; as if she was trying to work things out in her head.</p><p>\u201cWe-we met\u2026\u201d she stuttered,looking down at her feet. </p><p>\u201cY/N/N, I know you remember where we met&hellip;you just need to think about it,\u201d I said softly,my hand still wrapped around hers. </p><p><i>Y/Ns POV</i></p><p>My head was spinning, Hydra were my family&hellip;they didn\u2019t kidnap me, Tony abandoned me and hydra saved me. That was the truth&hellip;but if that was the truth then why was the Winter Soldier telling me differently..part of me thought that he was lying&hellip;but all I could see in his eyes was pure honesty and it just confused me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re saying all these things&hellip;why does it even matter?\u201d I asked, trying to move my hand out of his grip.</p><p>\u201cY/N/N, the first day we met; it was the first day that Hydra tortured you&hellip;you wanted to go home and be back with your dad; and they wouldn\u2019t let you so you tried to run away, and the guards found you&hellip;they took you to the lab and they tortured you..that\u2019s how you got those scars, from the torture that they put you through.\u201d The Winter Soldier said, tightening his grip on my hand slightly. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying&hellip;they would never\u2026.they wouldn\u2019t do something like that\u2026\u201d I whispered, as my head began pounding. </p><p>\u201cY/N/N, doll, when have I ever lied to you..I know you don\u2019t want to believe it; but this isn\u2019t you, this&hellip;this is the monster Hydra created.\u201d He stated, and as he said that the pain in my head grew&hellip;and my vision went blurry, until I was consumed by darkness. </p><p><i>Stephen Strange POV</i></p><p>Happy and I burst through the door, Y/N/N and Bucky were nowhere to be seen; our eyes darted around until they landed on Peter&hellip;lying on the floor, covered in blood. </p><p>\u201cShit\u201d Happy almost shouted as he ran over to Peter. </p><p>\u201cPeter, c\u2019mon kid, you need to wake up.\u201d he said crouching over his body, as he began cpr. </p><p>\u201cMove,\u201d I said simply, as I walked over to Peters body. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Happy asked, his eyes filled with tears. </p><p>\u201cI used to be a surgeon&hellip; I was the best there was,\u201d I said as I teleported some of my surgical tools from my upstairs office.</p><p>\u201cStrange, are you sure about this&hellip;there was a reason you stopped being a surgeon,\u201d Happy interjected as i grabbed one of the tools. </p><p>\u201cThank you for the immense lack of faith you have in me; he won\u2019t make it to the hospital and teleporting him would just kill him straight away. If I don\u2019t do this, he dies.
