Two very strong and powerful women who have both through all kinds of different hells in both of their lives. Their strength comes from those very traumatic experiences and now they have come together for one common goal. To defeat the Night King and save Westeros. </p><p>Now it is completely understandable as to why there is so much tension between these two. </p><p>Sansa has seen a lot of bullshit from a lot of people who believe that they have a right to that throne and especially those who arrive in Winterfell. I mean the last time a royal who was on the throne came, her family were all still alive and she was just a young girl who didn\u2019t know any better. Well this time it is completely different. She has been through too fucking much to just trust this unknown Queen from across the sea, who goes by the Targaryen name, and name she grew to fear and hate and just willingly trust her. And in her words, that was once said by her father long ago to the man who was King says, \u201c Winterfell is yours, your grace\u201d there is so much to be said as to what Sansa is feeling right now and what she is thinking as she is staring down Daenerys Targaryen. Of course she skeptical and passively aggressive towards her. She grew up believing she was the Mad King\u2019s daughter and seeks to destroy those in her way and claim Westeros/the Seven Kingdoms to herself. And right now they are facing a bigger and greater enemy that is threatening everything that they hold dear.So of course Sansa doesn\u2019t trust her just like Jon did when he first met Dany. Sansa needs to get to see Dany the way Jon has seen her. Not this Mad Queen or ruthless ruler but a woman who can be kind and worth bending the knee for. Sansa doesn\u2019t have to give Dany anything. Sansa deserves the right to protect her home from a queen she has still yet to trust. Sansa just wants what Jon wants to protect their family\u2019s home and keep them safe. Sansa and Dany just need the same opportunity that Dany had with Jon. The time to understand one another. And hopefully they can do that. </p><p>Now with Dany. She too has been through too much to have to be pitted against another strong and powerful potential queen. Dany grew up isolated and alone, running for her entire life. Sold to a war lord for his army by her own fucking brother and has been through just about the same amount of fucked up shit as Sansa has. She has never been to Westeros so she also, right now, doesn\u2019t know a lot about the system she wants to rule. About the certain customs to do in a situation like this one. I mean the threat from the Night King is serious and she has already lost a child, her dragon, to the white walkers. She arrives to Winterfell with Jon and meets his family for the first time. Not as the queen who orders you to bend the knee for her but as an ally willing to help in the present crisis. Who, like Jon sees the impending threat coming from the wall. Even the way she walks towards Sansa says something about her intentions and the way she stands with Jon you can see that Dany is just trying to be sincere. Dany, throughout the show has always been maternal and caring towards all the women around her. I mean with her hand maids when she was Khaleesi, to the women she protected from being raped by Drogo\u2019s blood riders ( a mistake which she paid for by the way - Mirri Mhaz Dihurr) and all the way to Missandei. Dany isn\u2019t trying to steal Winterfell away or threaten anyone especially those who Jon cares about. She knows how deeply loyal and brave he is and she wouldn\u2019t threaten them. And what happens when Sansa learns that this woman saved her brother\u2019s life? And that she too has lost those she has cared about to the Lannister\u2019s? Or the fact that Tyrion, the only Lannister who was kind to her, is her Hand? Sansa does not know who she is yet and I hope that changes in this upcoming season. </p><p>And it\u2019s as if Jon would let them do anything to each other. He cares for both of these women. And he just wants to protect them. </p><p>I really hope that the hostility between them passes and that they become trusting allies. Dany and Sansa should help and support one another and not he pitted against each other. Dany and Sansa can find common ground and learn to trust one another when they share their experiences.</p><p>We\u2019ve literally only seen a few seconds of a final season to an amazing show so this is just what I think so&hellip; call me an optimist. Also can we please get over the strong woman vs strong woman fight? Like can we get past pitting women against each other? Women should support one another not tear each other down.

Two very strong and powerful women who have both through all kinds of different hells in both of their lives. Their strength comes from those very traumatic experiences and now they have come together for one common goal. To defeat the Night King and save Westeros. </p><p>Now it is completely understandable as to why there is so much tension between these two. </p><p>Sansa has seen a lot of bullshit from a lot of people who believe that they have a right to that throne and especially those who arrive in Winterfell. I mean the last time a royal who was on the throne came, her family were all still alive and she was just a young girl who didn\u2019t know any better. Well this time it is completely different. She has been through too fucking much to just trust this unknown Queen from across the sea, who goes by the Targaryen name, and name she grew to fear and hate and just willingly trust her. And in her words, that was once said by her father long ago to the man who was King says, \u201c Winterfell is yours, your grace\u201d there is so much to be said as to what Sansa is feeling right now and what she is thinking as she is staring down Daenerys Targaryen. Of course she skeptical and passively aggressive towards her. She grew up believing she was the Mad King\u2019s daughter and seeks to destroy those in her way and claim Westeros/the Seven Kingdoms to herself. And right now they are facing a bigger and greater enemy that is threatening everything that they hold dear.So of course Sansa doesn\u2019t trust her just like Jon did when he first met Dany. Sansa needs to get to see Dany the way Jon has seen her. Not this Mad Queen or ruthless ruler but a woman who can be kind and worth bending the knee for. Sansa doesn\u2019t have to give Dany anything. Sansa deserves the right to protect her home from a queen she has still yet to trust. Sansa just wants what Jon wants to protect their family\u2019s home and keep them safe. Sansa and Dany just need the same opportunity that Dany had with Jon. The time to understand one another. And hopefully they can do that. </p><p>Now with Dany. She too has been through too much to have to be pitted against another strong and powerful potential queen. Dany grew up isolated and alone, running for her entire life. Sold to a war lord for his army by her own fucking brother and has been through just about the same amount of fucked up shit as Sansa has. She has never been to Westeros so she also, right now, doesn\u2019t know a lot about the system she wants to rule. About the certain customs to do in a situation like this one. I mean the threat from the Night King is serious and she has already lost a child, her dragon, to the white walkers. She arrives to Winterfell with Jon and meets his family for the first time. Not as the queen who orders you to bend the knee for her but as an ally willing to help in the present crisis. Who, like Jon sees the impending threat coming from the wall. Even the way she walks towards Sansa says something about her intentions and the way she stands with Jon you can see that Dany is just trying to be sincere. Dany, throughout the show has always been maternal and caring towards all the women around her. I mean with her hand maids when she was Khaleesi, to the women she protected from being raped by Drogo\u2019s blood riders ( a mistake which she paid for by the way - Mirri Mhaz Dihurr) and all the way to Missandei. Dany isn\u2019t trying to steal Winterfell away or threaten anyone especially those who Jon cares about. She knows how deeply loyal and brave he is and she wouldn\u2019t threaten them. And what happens when Sansa learns that this woman saved her brother\u2019s life? And that she too has lost those she has cared about to the Lannister\u2019s? Or the fact that Tyrion, the only Lannister who was kind to her, is her Hand? Sansa does not know who she is yet and I hope that changes in this upcoming season. </p><p>And it\u2019s as if Jon would let them do anything to each other. He cares for both of these women. And he just wants to protect them. </p><p>I really hope that the hostility between them passes and that they become trusting allies. Dany and Sansa should help and support one another and not he pitted against each other. Dany and Sansa can find common ground and learn to trust one another when they share their experiences.</p><p>We\u2019ve literally only seen a few seconds of a final season to an amazing show so this is just what I think so\u2026 call me an optimist. Also can we please get over the strong woman vs strong woman fight? Like can we get past pitting women against each other? Women should support one another not tear each other down. Especially those who have been through what they both have been through so like please\u2026 seriously. </p></p>",
