What is more: the fact that Jaime saved her only pertained to the romantic-ness of the trope.\u00a0</p><p>3. And while it is a <b>romance trope </b>and could very well support our ship (i.e. if it is Jon who comes to Sansa\u2019s rescue) that<b> is not the main point why I think the\u00a0\u201ckidnap plot\u201d makes sense</b> and is important: it is about <b>Cersei and Sansa, aka the YMBQ.\u00a0</b></p><p><b>The kidnap plot that is supposedly so reactionary and bad for Sansa\u2019s character development is imo going to be her big break.\u00a0</b>Because <b>Sansa was hiding in Winterfell.</b> It is her home and it is her<b> safe zone,</b> but it is not her destiny to hide from her enemies forever.\u00a0\u00a0</p><h2><b>The same way that Cersei has unfinished business with Sansa, Sansa also has unfinished business with Cersei, she just hasn\u2019t realized it yet</b>.\u00a0</h2><p>I know that D and JD stans like to imagine that *everything* is about their queen and their ship, but fact is that <b>the relationship between the Starks and the Lannisters has zero to do with Dani or Jon*erys.</b> It is one of the <b>central conflicts and needs resolution</b>. Arya is the one who wants to kill Cersei for what she did to the Stark. However,<b> Cersei does not want to kill Arya, what she wants is Sansa.\u00a0</b><br/></p><p>The reason why some Jonsa and Sansa stans like me do not see the\u00a0\u201ckidnap plot\u201d as throwing Sansa back into her role from earlier seasons is that while the scenario has not changed and Cersei has not changed, <b>one thing has changed </b>big time:</p><p><b>Sansa.\u00a0</b></p><p>Of course haters and <b>antis imagine that Sansa would be nothing more than a weak, crying damsel again, because that is ALL they will ever see</b> in her. They refuse to acknowledge that even outside of Winterfell\u2019s safe space, <b>Sansa has changed and will be a strong, clever, calculating force to be reckoned with.\u00a0</b></p><h2>IF Cersei has Sansa\u00a0\u201cfetched\u201d and brought back to her, she will have brought her own doom back under her roof.\u00a0</h2><p>My final point is: <b>the\u00a0\u201ckidnap plot\u201d (IF it even happens) and an empowerment of Sansa do not have to be mutually exclusive plot points.</b> If you believe that Sansa will let Cersei walk all over her again, then you have probably not paid a lot of attention to her in the past three to four seasons.</p><h2>Sansa can be both a strong female character who can hold her own against another strong female character and yet be rescued out of her clutches by a male hero without losing her integrity or looking weak.\u00a0</h2><p>Everyone is always focused on the possible\u00a0\u201crescue\u201d from a possible\u00a0\u201ckidnap\u201d but what about what happens in between? <b>What about the awesome possibility of seeing Sansa play Cersei like a fiddle, of Sansa outwitting Cersei who forced her to \u201ccome\u201d to King\u2019s Landing again to\u00a0\u201ccast her down.\u201d</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"336\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"jojensreed:q-RL72V9fld4-WDdkfGm2Q:ZaS5as2ggFi59\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8e862d81262fc3be522b66b33407169c/tumblr_pnwnszo1S71snpr1xo1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"336\"/></figure><h2><b>I\u2019m here for it, kidnap or no kidnap.\u00a0</b></h2>",

But manipulation is a skill she's learned and we've seen her use it against other characters from the beginning e.g. joffrey, baelish, Lords of vale. I think we see this with Jon when she tells him they need to save Rickon knowing they had no chance, when she touches him to get him to listen, especially after the first time, and even when she uses that patronizing tone to compare him to joffrey.",
        "answer": "<p>Hey, nonnie!</p><p>You are certainly entitled to your opinion and I encourage all Jonsa and Sansa fans to express their views, independent of how popular they are. I think discourse and debate are very healthy.\u00a0</p><p>However, I would have to disagree with your interpretation. I can understand what might give you that impression and, in my opinion, it all has to do with the hidden POV technique that the writers employ for Sansa over and over again. It\u2019s one of the main reasons why I hate this narrative choice so much. It leaves far too much room for interpretation in regards to her actions, motivations and decisions and that causes people to disconnect from her.\u00a0</p><p>The main reason why I don\u2019t believe that Sansa is manipulating Jon is that if she is indeed trying to manipulate him, she\u2019s doing a thoroughly terrible job of it. Jon almost never does anything Sansa advises or wants him to do, he disregards her advice time and time again and cuts her out of important decisions. So either Sansa isn\u2019t trying to manipulate him or she\u2019s just a crappy manipulator all together. Considering that, as you say, Sansa has been forced to use manipulation in the past in order to survive, I just can\u2019t believe that she\u2019d be so bad at it with Jon.</p><p>I also don\u2019t really see what her end goal for this manipulation might be?\u00a0</p><p>She wants power? If she wanted that, she wouldn\u2019t have spent the whole of season 7 fighting to keep Jon\u2019s armies intact and she wouldn\u2019t have executed Littlefinger. LF wanted to usurp Jon\u2019s throne and put Sansa in his place. Sansa responded to that by holding a public trial for him.\u00a0</p><p>She doesn\u2019t trust him? I\u2019ll be the first to say that Sansa has trust issues but that\u2019s not limited to Jon. She doesn\u2019t fully trust anyone because of everything that has happened to her. I think that, as far as she can trust anyone, she trusts Jon. If she didn\u2019t, she wouldn\u2019t have continued to support him after he sent her a scroll announcing he bent the knee with no explanation.\u00a0</p><p>She just wants to get her way? Again, she almost never does get her way.\u00a0</p><p>Just to briefly touch on the examples you gave:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\n I think we see this with Jon when she tells him they need to save Rickon knowing they had no chance\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>See? This is a prime example of why cutting us off from Sansa\u2019s POV works against her character. But I do think this is a misinterpretation of Sansa\u2019s state of mind at the time.\u00a0</p><p>I don\u2019t think that during the scene where she convinces Jon to go to war with Ramsay, Sansa believes Rickon is as good as dead. She knows there\u2019s a possibility that Ramsay will kill him but I believe she also hopes that they can in fact save him.\u00a0</p><p>Here\u2019s the thing: Sansa is not a callous person. She loves her family. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s easy for her to admit that Rickon will die. She wants to believe he can be saved, hence the sense of urgency when she grabs Jon\u2019s hand to plead with him to go to war.\u00a0</p><p>If she had truly wanted to manipulate Jon in that scene, she would have really emphasized her own abuse at Ramsay\u2019s hands. She never does. All she does is plead with Jon to fight for something he clearly already wants to fight for but doesn\u2019t believe he can. She empowers him.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s also a similar action to what Jon does with D*ny in the cave scene in season 7. Jon isn\u2019t manipulating D*ny . He\u2019s asking for help, trying to explain the situation to her as best he can and trying to drive home the importance of\u00a0\u201cworking together\u201d. He acts very differently from the Jon on the boat after the wight hunt, when he is very obviously manipulating her by using any means he has at his disposal.</p><p>One more thing that really signals to me that Sansa thinks Rickon can be saved in that scene is the way she reacts to Ramsay during the parlay. She is stoic and stands her ground when Ramsay addresses her directly, she makes it a point to be there but as soon as Ramsay throws Shaggy Dog\u2019s head on the ground and begins to talk about Rickon, you can see Sansa\u2019s whole demeanor change. I think this is the moment she realizes Ramsay will kill Rickon and they have absolutely no chance of getting him back. Hence her saying:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: You\u2019re going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton.

And very importantly, she feels comfortable enough around him to touch him. Also, particularly in season 7, Jon seems to actively try to run away from her, if not physically, at least emotionally. Sansa seems to sense this subconsciously, hence her pulling on his arm to draw him back. She pleads with him over and over again to include her more, to listen to her and to talk to her. That doesn\u2019t feel like manipulation to me. Frustration, certainly and also a desire to be important in his life and be taken into account.

            "comment": "<p>Hey, nonnie!</p><p>You are certainly entitled to your opinion and I encourage all Jonsa and Sansa fans to express their views, independent of how popular they are. I think discourse and debate are very healthy.\u00a0</p><p>However, I would have to disagree with your interpretation. I can understand what might give you that impression and, in my opinion, it all has to do with the hidden POV technique that the writers employ for Sansa over and over again. It\u2019s one of the main reasons why I hate this narrative choice so much. It leaves far too much room for interpretation in regards to her actions, motivations and decisions and that causes people to disconnect from her.\u00a0</p><p>The main reason why I don\u2019t believe that Sansa is manipulating Jon is that if she is indeed trying to manipulate him, she\u2019s doing a thoroughly terrible job of it. Jon almost never does anything Sansa advises or wants him to do, he disregards her advice time and time again and cuts her out of important decisions. So either Sansa isn\u2019t trying to manipulate him or she\u2019s just a crappy manipulator all together. Considering that, as you say, Sansa has been forced to use manipulation in the past in order to survive, I just can\u2019t believe that she\u2019d be so bad at it with Jon.</p><p>I also don\u2019t really see what her end goal for this manipulation might be?\u00a0</p><p>She wants power? If she wanted that, she wouldn\u2019t have spent the whole of season 7 fighting to keep Jon\u2019s armies intact and she wouldn\u2019t have executed Littlefinger. LF wanted to usurp Jon\u2019s throne and put Sansa in his place. Sansa responded to that by holding a public trial for him.\u00a0</p><p>She doesn\u2019t trust him? I\u2019ll be the first to say that Sansa has trust issues but that\u2019s not limited to Jon. She doesn\u2019t fully trust anyone because of everything that has happened to her. I think that, as far as she can trust anyone, she trusts Jon. If she didn\u2019t, she wouldn\u2019t have continued to support him after he sent her a scroll announcing he bent the knee with no explanation.\u00a0</p><p>She just wants to get her way? Again, she almost never does get her way.\u00a0</p><p>Just to briefly touch on the examples you gave:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\n I think we see this with Jon when she tells him they need to save Rickon knowing they had no chance\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>See? This is a prime example of why cutting us off from Sansa\u2019s POV works against her character. But I do think this is a misinterpretation of Sansa\u2019s state of mind at the time.\u00a0</p><p>I don\u2019t think that during the scene where she convinces Jon to go to war with Ramsay, Sansa believes Rickon is as good as dead. She knows there\u2019s a possibility that Ramsay will kill him but I believe she also hopes that they can in fact save him.\u00a0</p><p>Here\u2019s the thing: Sansa is not a callous person. She loves her family. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s easy for her to admit that Rickon will die. She wants to believe he can be saved, hence the sense of urgency when she grabs Jon\u2019s hand to plead with him to go to war.\u00a0</p><p>If she had truly wanted to manipulate Jon in that scene, she would have really emphasized her own abuse at Ramsay\u2019s hands. She never does. All she does is plead with Jon to fight for something he clearly already wants to fight for but doesn\u2019t believe he can. She empowers him.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s also a similar action to what Jon does with D*ny in the cave scene in season 7. Jon isn\u2019t manipulating D*ny . He\u2019s asking for help, trying to explain the situation to her as best he can and trying to drive home the importance of\u00a0\u201cworking together\u201d. He acts very differently from the Jon on the boat after the wight hunt, when he is very obviously manipulating her by using any means he has at his disposal.</p><p>One more thing that really signals to me that Sansa thinks Rickon can be saved in that scene is the way she reacts to Ramsay during the parlay. She is stoic and stands her ground when Ramsay addresses her directly, she makes it a point to be there but as soon as Ramsay throws Shaggy Dog\u2019s head on the ground and begins to talk about Rickon, you can see Sansa\u2019s whole demeanor change. I think this is the moment she realizes Ramsay will kill Rickon and they have absolutely no chance of getting him back. Hence her saying:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: You\u2019re going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton. Sleep well.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>That\u2019s fuled by Rickon as is her abrupt departure from a parlay she insisted she wanted to participate in.

Despite being on a shitload of anaesthetics/painkillers, I needed a distraction from all the pain, hence - this. (And also I may have found out where the name\u00a0\u201cwisdom tooth\u201d comes from.

The Others are closer every day, Bran says, but Jon is either staring at the walls during meetings or he\u2019s disappearing for hours, maybe longer. Even Daenerys Targaryen grows suspicious.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201eLady Sansa, forgive me,\u201d she interrupts her once, smiling kindly. Littlefinger was right, she is the most stunning woman Sansa has ever laid eyes on. The worry suits her, too. Her face becomes softer, almost girly, a shadow of who they all were before the world forced them to grow up. \u201eThere are some final arrangements that we need to consult with your brother, but he is nowhere to be found. Would you please ask him to visit Lord Tyrion\u2019s chambers as soon as you see him?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not even an order, it\u2019s a plea. The Dragon Queen is concerned\u2014and so is Sansa.</p><p>She gives Daenerys a brief nod and gets back to her solar to put on her coat. There is only one place where he would seek solace other than the crypts\u2014and he\u2019s definitely not in the crypts, Arya\u2019s already checked.</p><p>It\u2019s not possible to sneak up on somebody in the godswood, the snow crunching under Sansa\u2019s feet announces her presence long before she reaches a hunched, miserable creature sitting on one of the roots. He knows that he\u2019s no longer alone, she takes it from the way his shoulders tense up under a leather jerkin.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to freeze yourself to death, could you please do it after the Night King is defeated?\u201d Sansa asks, and it\u2019s supposed to sound playful but comes out almost mean. She bites her lip, comes a few steps closer, and then covers him with another fur, the one she\u2019s been carrying through Winterfell\u2019s courtyards, raising curious glances.</p><p>She lingers a while longer with her hand on Jon\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m with you,\u201d she wants to say, but somehow the reassurance refuses to form. They\u2019ve been telling him the same thing for days, why would he decide to listen to her now? He needs to be alone, she knows that, but unfortunately, it\u2019s the last thing they should let him do. They are his family and nothing will change it.</p><p>Jon doesn\u2019t move for another two or three minutes, and Sansa begins to consider releasing his shoulder and retreating to the safety of her solar when suddenly he raises his hand and places it over Sansa\u2019s. She\u2019s got her gloves on, but even through thick leather she can feel the icy touch. She glances down and realises that his hand went almost blue from the cold.</p><p>\u201cJon!\u201d she yells at him\u2014or maybe just whispers, it\u2019s all very quiet around here, she wouldn\u2019t want to disturb the gods\u2014and crunches down in front of Jon to force him to look at her. \u201cYou need to snap out of this,\u201d she says, a tinge of rebuke in her voice. \u201cWe need you. Not in some fight against the dead that we may as well lose even with you leading our armies. We need you as our family. Arya and Bran need you. <i>I need you.</i>\u201d</p><p>Jon finally looks at her\u2014and there\u2019s so much pain in his eyes, it almost physically hurts Sansa to see him like that. She takes both of his hands in hers\u2014partly to make him listen to what she has to say more carefully, the touch always seems to work magic between them, and partly to warm them up\u2014and tugs them under her furs, close to her heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry that it happened, Jon. I truly am. No one should have to find out such things after years of carefully building their identity around some scraps that turned out to be lies. You might think that I have no idea of what I speak, but I too was always proven to be wrong about everything I wanted to be. It\u2019s offensive to compare these two, I know, but please take it from the deepest, most honest part of my soul: you might not be our brother, but you will always be our family. There\u2019s only four of us left, you and I, and Arya, and Bran. We are the pack. We are a family. <i>We are the Starks.</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a Stark,\u201d he says grimly with a hoarse voice. Sansa is certain he\u2019s been crying for the better part of the last few days. She\u2019d do anything to make him understand.</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d she insists. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. As far as I\u2019m concerned this only proves you are more of a Stark than you\u2019ve been thus far.\u201d Jon doesn\u2019t look away for a second, as if searching for something in her eyes that would make him believe her words. He seems so lost, she just wants to lock him in a tight embrace and never let go. \u201cI know my mother was never kind to you. Your identity was a hurtful lie she died believing, and it breaks my heart to imagine how different our lives might have been in different circumstances. I hope you forgive her, and I hope she forgives Father for what he put her through. But Father\u2026 He loved you with all his heart. If you think even for a minute that Ned Stark wasn\u2019t your true parent\u2014\u201d Jon squeezes her hand tight as if he\u2019s clinging to this declaration. \u201cI don\u2019t care whose blood you share. Father risked everything he held dear to give you a good life, to protect you from King Robert\u2019s wrath, from all the enemies who might have come for your head, had they learned the truth. He raised you as his own, and I\u2019m sure he died regretting that the truth was dying with him. You are a Stark on your father\u2019s side, and now you\u2019re a Stark on your mother\u2019s side, too. In fact, you\u2019re more of a Stark than any of us. Arya, Bran, and I are all half-Stark and half-Tully,\u201d she smiles.</p><p>And Jon looks at her for a moment with bright eyes\u2014Sansa thinks there might be tears forming in them but it\u2019s something else entirely, something thrilling, challenging even. And then he smiles back. It\u2019s weak and lasts only a mere second, but it\u2019s undeniably there. Jon pulls her closer and buries his face in her furs.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be kind to me,\u201d he murmurs.</p><p>Sansa rolls her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t <i>have to </i>be kind to you, you dummy. I choose to be kind to you because I love you,\u201d she says angrily, and to make her point stronger places a soft kiss to the top of his head, not unlike the one he once gifted to her.</p><p>They stay like that for a while, hugging tightly, their arms tangled together, Jon breathing into Sansa\u2019s neck and Sansa stroking the top of his head with her nose, until it dawns on them how strange they must look from the outside.</p><p>Well, it certainly dawns on Sansa, because when she suddenly pulls back, Jon seems to have been taken by surprise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says with a mortified expression, \u201cwas I making you uncomfortable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncomfortable?\u201d She blinks at him. \u201cOf course not. Why would you make me uncomfortable?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long, silent moment when Jon studies her face carefully as if it is the first time he ever sees her. Then he lets go of her hands and hides his own under his cloak.</p><p>\u201cIf I asked you a question\u2026 Would you answer truthfully?\u201d</p><p>It should probably offend her that he would think otherwise, but she decides not to comment on that. He\u2019s way too vulnerable to deal with her wounded pride just yet.</p><p>Instead, Sansa simply nods.</p><p>It seems to be as good an encouragement as any, because Jon makes this stupid face which he uses when he\u2019s being stubborn: like when he insisted on going to a fight with just a bunch of men, or when he declared that he would be riding south to convince Daenerys Targaryen to fight for them. Only this time it\u2019s about something much more personal, she can feel it.</p><p>Jon lowers his eyes almost as if he can\u2019t look at Sansa while he asks.</p><p>\u201cAbout what you said earlier.\u201d</p><p>Sansa expects him to continue, but that\u2019s all she seems to be getting.</p><p>\u201cI said many things, Jon,\u201d she sighs.</p><p>\u201cYou said you loved me.\u201d Ah, that. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>His voice is shaking, he sounds almost too afraid to be hopeful. It breaks her heart.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean <i>why</i>? I said it because it is how I feel. You are the most important person in the entire world to me.\u201d</p><p>Although Sansa has never wondered about it before, she knows in her heart that it\u2019s true. She loves Arya and Bran more than she loves herself, but Jon is the first person she ever loved for who he was and what they shared together, not someone whom she was conditioned to love no matter what. Maybe it was lady Catelyn\u2019s doing. <i>Maybe it was for the better.</i></p><p>Jon still refuses to look her in the eye.</p><p>\u201cEven now?\u201d he asks quietly. \u201cEven after it\u2019s been revealed that I\u2019m not your brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Especially now,</i>\u201d she answers without really giving it much thought. Seeing that he finally raises his head and stares at her, she gives him an encouraging smile and stands up. Turning to get back to the castle, she hears him whisper:</p><p>\u201c<i>Sansa.</i>\u201d</p><p>Something about the tone of his voice stops her in her tracks. She doesn\u2019t turn back to him, hit by freezing wind from the North. For a short moment Sansa fears that they\u2019re nearing the end at last, that Winterfell might be under attack, but then she hears Jon\u2019s pleading words:</p><p>\u201c<i>Especially now?</i>\u201d There\u2019s a thunder coming from afar. Or maybe it\u2019s just the beating of Sansa\u2019s heart? \u201cWhy <i>especially</i>?\u201d</p><p>And at this moment, witnessed by the old gods, Sansa finally realises.</p><p>She loves Jon, yes.</p><p>But she\u2019s also <i>in love </i>with Jon.</p><p>A terrifying awakening, and one that is followed by the sound of horns from the gates. \u201cThey\u2019re here,\u201d Sansa thinks, and Jon looks at her for the last time before he grabs her hand and they run together towards the castle. \u201cPlease,\u201d she prays to the gods, \u201cplease let us live, so that I may tell him one day.\u201d</p>",

Maybe it was lady Catelyn\u2019s doing. <i>Maybe it was for the better.</i></p><p>Jon still refuses to look her in the eye.</p><p>\u201cEven now?\u201d he asks quietly. \u201cEven after it\u2019s been revealed that I\u2019m not your brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Especially now,</i>\u201d she answers without really giving it much thought. Seeing that he finally raises his head and stares at her, she gives him an encouraging smile and stands up. Turning to get back to the castle, she hears him whisper:</p><p>\u201c<i>Sansa.</i>\u201d</p><p>Something about the tone of his voice stops her in her tracks. She doesn\u2019t turn back to him, hit by freezing wind from the North. For a short moment Sansa fears that they\u2019re nearing the end at last, that Winterfell might be under attack, but then she hears Jon\u2019s pleading words:</p><p>\u201c<i>Especially now?</i>\u201d There\u2019s a thunder coming from afar. Or maybe it\u2019s just the beating of Sansa\u2019s heart? \u201cWhy <i>especially</i>?\u201d</p><p>And at this moment, witnessed by the old gods, Sansa finally realises.</p><p>She loves Jon, yes.</p><p>But she\u2019s also <i>in love </i>with Jon.</p><p>A terrifying awakening, and one that is followed by the sound of horns from the gates. \u201cThey\u2019re here,\u201d Sansa thinks, and Jon looks at her for the last time before he grabs her hand and they run together towards the castle. \u201cPlease,\u201d she prays to the gods, \u201cplease let us live, so that I may tell him one day.\u201d</p>",

Even Daenerys Targaryen grows suspicious.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201eLady Sansa, forgive me,\u201d she interrupts her once, smiling kindly. Littlefinger was right, she is the most stunning woman Sansa has ever laid eyes on. The worry suits her, too. Her face becomes softer, almost girly, a shadow of who they all were before the world forced them to grow up. \u201eThere are some final arrangements that we need to consult with your brother, but he is nowhere to be found. Would you please ask him to visit Lord Tyrion\u2019s chambers as soon as you see him?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not even an order, it\u2019s a plea. The Dragon Queen is concerned\u2014and so is Sansa.</p><p>She gives Daenerys a brief nod and gets back to her solar to put on her coat. There is only one place where he would seek solace other than the crypts\u2014and he\u2019s definitely not in the crypts, Arya\u2019s already checked.</p><p>It\u2019s not possible to sneak up on somebody in the godswood, the snow crunching under Sansa\u2019s feet announces her presence long before she reaches a hunched, miserable creature sitting on one of the roots. He knows that he\u2019s no longer alone, she takes it from the way his shoulders tense up under a leather jerkin.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to freeze yourself to death, could you please do it after the Night King is defeated?\u201d Sansa asks, and it\u2019s supposed to sound playful but comes out almost mean. She bites her lip, comes a few steps closer, and then covers him with another fur, the one she\u2019s been carrying through Winterfell\u2019s courtyards, raising curious glances.</p><p>She lingers a while longer with her hand on Jon\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m with you,\u201d she wants to say, but somehow the reassurance refuses to form. They\u2019ve been telling him the same thing for days, why would he decide to listen to her now? He needs to be alone, she knows that, but unfortunately, it\u2019s the last thing they should let him do. They are his family and nothing will change it.</p><p>Jon doesn\u2019t move for another two or three minutes, and Sansa begins to consider releasing his shoulder and retreating to the safety of her solar when suddenly he raises his hand and places it over Sansa\u2019s. She\u2019s got her gloves on, but even through thick leather she can feel the icy touch. She glances down and realises that his hand went almost blue from the cold.</p><p>\u201cJon!\u201d she yells at him\u2014or maybe just whispers, it\u2019s all very quiet around here, she wouldn\u2019t want to disturb the gods\u2014and crunches down in front of Jon to force him to look at her. \u201cYou need to snap out of this,\u201d she says, a tinge of rebuke in her voice. \u201cWe need you. Not in some fight against the dead that we may as well lose even with you leading our armies. We need you as our family. Arya and Bran need you. <i>I need you.</i>\u201d</p><p>Jon finally looks at her\u2014and there\u2019s so much pain in his eyes, it almost physically hurts Sansa to see him like that. She takes both of his hands in hers\u2014partly to make him listen to what she has to say more carefully, the touch always seems to work magic between them, and partly to warm them up\u2014and tugs them under her furs, close to her heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry that it happened, Jon. I truly am. No one should have to find out such things after years of carefully building their identity around some scraps that turned out to be lies. You might think that I have no idea of what I speak, but I too was always proven to be wrong about everything I wanted to be. It\u2019s offensive to compare these two, I know, but please take it from the deepest, most honest part of my soul: you might not be our brother, but you will always be our family. There\u2019s only four of us left, you and I, and Arya, and Bran. We are the pack. We are a family. <i>We are the Starks.</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a Stark,\u201d he says grimly with a hoarse voice. Sansa is certain he\u2019s been crying for the better part of the last few days. She\u2019d do anything to make him understand.</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d she insists. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. As far as I\u2019m concerned this only proves you are more of a Stark than you\u2019ve been thus far.\u201d Jon doesn\u2019t look away for a second, as if searching for something in her eyes that would make him believe her words. He seems so lost, she just wants to lock him in a tight embrace and never let go. \u201cI know my mother was never kind to you. Your identity was a hurtful lie she died believing, and it breaks my heart to imagine how different our lives might have been in different circumstances. I hope you forgive her, and I hope she forgives Father for what he put her through. But Father\u2026 He loved you with all his heart. If you think even for a minute that Ned Stark wasn\u2019t your true parent\u2014\u201d Jon squeezes her hand tight as if he\u2019s clinging to this declaration. \u201cI don\u2019t care whose blood you share. Father risked everything he held dear to give you a good life, to protect you from King Robert\u2019s wrath, from all the enemies who might have come for your head, had they learned the truth. He raised you as his own, and I\u2019m sure he died regretting that the truth was dying with him. You are a Stark on your father\u2019s side, and now you\u2019re a Stark on your mother\u2019s side, too. In fact, you\u2019re more of a Stark than any of us. Arya, Bran, and I are all half-Stark and half-Tully,\u201d she smiles.</p><p>And Jon looks at her for a moment with bright eyes\u2014Sansa thinks there might be tears forming in them but it\u2019s something else entirely, something thrilling, challenging even. And then he smiles back. It\u2019s weak and lasts only a mere second, but it\u2019s undeniably there. Jon pulls her closer and buries his face in her furs.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be kind to me,\u201d he murmurs.</p><p>Sansa rolls her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t <i>have to </i>be kind to you, you dummy. I choose to be kind to you because I love you,\u201d she says angrily, and to make her point stronger places a soft kiss to the top of his head, not unlike the one he once gifted to her.</p><p>They stay like that for a while, hugging tightly, their arms tangled together, Jon breathing into Sansa\u2019s neck and Sansa stroking the top of his head with her nose, until it dawns on them how strange they must look from the outside.</p><p>Well, it certainly dawns on Sansa, because when she suddenly pulls back, Jon seems to have been taken by surprise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says with a mortified expression, \u201cwas I making you uncomfortable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncomfortable?\u201d She blinks at him. \u201cOf course not. Why would you make me uncomfortable?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long, silent moment when Jon studies her face carefully as if it is the first time he ever sees her. Then he lets go of her hands and hides his own under his cloak.</p><p>\u201cIf I asked you a question\u2026 Would you answer truthfully?\u201d</p><p>It should probably offend her that he would think otherwise, but she decides not to comment on that. He\u2019s way too vulnerable to deal with her wounded pride just yet.</p><p>Instead, Sansa simply nods.</p><p>It seems to be as good an encouragement as any, because Jon makes this stupid face which he uses when he\u2019s being stubborn: like when he insisted on going to a fight with just a bunch of men, or when he declared that he would be riding south to convince Daenerys Targaryen to fight for them. Only this time it\u2019s about something much more personal, she can feel it.</p><p>Jon lowers his eyes almost as if he can\u2019t look at Sansa while he asks.</p><p>\u201cAbout what you said earlier.\u201d</p><p>Sansa expects him to continue, but that\u2019s all she seems to be getting.</p><p>\u201cI said many things, Jon,\u201d she sighs.</p><p>\u201cYou said you loved me.\u201d Ah, that. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>His voice is shaking, he sounds almost too afraid to be hopeful. It breaks her heart.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean <i>why</i>? I said it because it is how I feel. You are the most important person in the entire world to me.\u201d</p><p>Although Sansa has never wondered about it before, she knows in her heart that it\u2019s true. She loves Arya and Bran more than she loves herself, but Jon is the first person she ever loved for who he was and what they shared together, not someone whom she was conditioned to love no matter what.

Maybe it was lady Catelyn&rsquo;s doing. <i>Maybe it was for the better.</i></p><p>Jon still refuses to look her in the eye.</p><p>&ldquo;Even now?&rdquo; he asks quietly. &ldquo;Even after it&rsquo;s been revealed that I&rsquo;m not your brother?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Especially now,</i>&rdquo; she answers without really giving it much thought. Seeing that he finally raises his head and stares at her, she gives him an encouraging smile and stands up. Turning to get back to the castle, she hears him whisper:</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Sansa.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>Something about the tone of his voice stops her in her tracks. She doesn&rsquo;t turn back to him, hit by freezing wind from the North. For a short moment Sansa fears that they&rsquo;re nearing the end at last, that Winterfell might be under attack, but then she hears Jon&rsquo;s pleading words:</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Especially now?</i>&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a thunder coming from afar. Or maybe it&rsquo;s just the beating of Sansa&rsquo;s heart? &ldquo;Why <i>especially</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>And at this moment, witnessed by the old gods, Sansa finally realises.</p><p>She loves Jon, yes.</p><p>But she&rsquo;s also <i>in love </i>with Jon.</p><p>A terrifying awakening, and one that is followed by the sound of horns from the gates. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; Sansa thinks, and Jon looks at her for the last time before he grabs her hand and they run together towards the castle. &ldquo;Please,&rdquo; she prays to the gods, &ldquo;please let us live, so that I may tell him one day.&rdquo;</p>",
