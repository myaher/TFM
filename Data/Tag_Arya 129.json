</a></p><p>tbh I\u2019m not even sure that \u201con account of Arya\u201d is meant to reflect on Sansa and isn\u2019t just an awkward wording on GRRM\u2019s part, because, *technically* speaking, Lady was killed in place of Arya\u2019s pet.</p><p>She\u2019s basically saying \u201cbecause of Arya\u201d &hellip; behaving so wild and unruly, doing things she shouldn\u2019t have been doing in the first place, etc. that set off the chain of events.\u00a0 She knows deep down that is a stretch of logic and isn\u2019t even remotely true.\u00a0 Lady died because Cersei wanted a scapegoat she could feel triumphant over in retaliation for harm coming to her lying, malicious son.\u00a0 Add to that fact that Cersei was always gunning for those wolves and would never allow them to come to KL, one way or another, which Arya sensed correctly.\u00a0 While Ned\u2019s decision to execute Lady himself came from a misguided sense of mercy, not taking into account how much that would hurt Sansa before he opened his mouth, he did prevent Lady\u2019s skin from becoming Cersei\u2019s trophy.\u00a0 Sansa had told her father the truth about what happened, so she did understand who created the conflict even back then.\u00a0 It was Joffrey\u2019s decision to torment a helpless smallfolk kid for absolutely no reason other than to show off.\u00a0 But after that incident, Sansa reverts back to blaming Arya and her father and changes the narrative to \u201cthe butcher\u2019s boy attacked the prince.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>After it becomes clear to her who Joffrey really is, there\u2019s having to admit she sided with the wrong people.\u00a0 Even basically good human beings will go to great lengths to rationalize their actions and generally resist having to admit they were wrong.\u00a0 There\u2019s also Sansa\u2019s impressionable age and being exposed to Septa Mordane\u2019s constant blaming of Arya\u2019s inability to perform femininity right and her wild, untamable nature for ruining everything she touches.\u00a0 That just got hardwired into Sansa\u2019s programming so blaming Arya is almost an automatic, unthinking response most of the time.\u00a0 Somehow everything is Arya\u2019s fault or related to something Arya did wrong.\u00a0 We can see in Sansa\u2019s positive memories that this was never a defining\u00a0feature of their relationship before the septa\u2019s influence.\u00a0 Unwiring all that takes time, and I think Sansa accomplishes that on her own and she grows in leaps and bounds.\u00a0 Those types of uncharitable thoughts were few and short-lived after she sees Joffrey clearly for what he is.\u00a0 I don\u2019t believe she truly in her heart bears any resentment about Lady toward Ned or Arya even if she regresses a very tiny bit a couple of times.\u00a0 Overall, her love for her family is strong enough to get past the unfortunate incidents that temporarily drove a wedge between them.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p></div>",

very well\u2026but I believe\u2026 </a></p><p>tbh I\u2019m not even sure that \u201con account of Arya\u201d is meant to reflect on Sansa and isn\u2019t just an awkward wording on GRRM\u2019s part, because, *technically* speaking, Lady was killed in place of Arya\u2019s pet.</p><p>She\u2019s basically saying \u201cbecause of Arya\u201d \u2026 behaving so wild and unruly, doing things she shouldn\u2019t have been doing in the first place, etc. that set off the chain of events.\u00a0 She knows deep down that is a stretch of logic and isn\u2019t even remotely true.\u00a0 Lady died because Cersei wanted a scapegoat she could feel triumphant over in retaliation for harm coming to her lying, malicious son.\u00a0 Add to that fact that Cersei was always gunning for those wolves and would never allow them to come to KL, one way or another, which Arya sensed correctly.\u00a0 While Ned\u2019s decision to execute Lady himself came from a misguided sense of mercy, not taking into account how much that would hurt Sansa before he opened his mouth, he did prevent Lady\u2019s skin from becoming Cersei\u2019s trophy.\u00a0 Sansa had told her father the truth about what happened, so she did understand who created the conflict even back then.\u00a0 It was Joffrey\u2019s decision to torment a helpless smallfolk kid for absolutely no reason other than to show off.\u00a0 But after that incident, Sansa reverts back to blaming Arya and her father and changes the narrative to \u201cthe butcher\u2019s boy attacked the prince.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>After it becomes clear to her who Joffrey really is, there\u2019s having to admit she sided with the wrong people.\u00a0 Even basically good human beings will go to great lengths to rationalize their actions and generally resist having to admit they were wrong.\u00a0 There\u2019s also Sansa\u2019s impressionable age and being exposed to Septa Mordane\u2019s constant blaming of Arya\u2019s inability to perform femininity right and her wild, untamable nature for ruining everything she touches.\u00a0 That just got hardwired into Sansa\u2019s programming so blaming Arya is almost an automatic, unthinking response most of the time.\u00a0 Somehow everything is Arya\u2019s fault or related to something Arya did wrong.\u00a0 We can see in Sansa\u2019s positive memories that this was never a defining\u00a0feature of their relationship before the septa\u2019s influence.\u00a0 Unwiring all that takes time, and I think Sansa accomplishes that on her own and she grows in leaps and bounds.\u00a0 Those types of uncharitable thoughts were few and short-lived after she sees Joffrey clearly for what he is.\u00a0 I don\u2019t believe she truly in her heart bears any resentment about Lady toward Ned or Arya even if she regresses a very tiny bit a couple of times.\u00a0 Overall, her love for her family is strong enough to get past the unfortunate incidents that temporarily drove a wedge between them.\u00a0 \u00a0

        "question": "I can't seem to recall very well...but I believe that, after the beheading of her father, Sansa has been thinking more of the Hound than of Arya, her own sister who dissappeared at the same time. I mean, as  her sister, it would be normal to be thinking more often about Arya's whereabouts and wellbeing but, as time goes on, she thinks less or not at all of her. But on the other hand she thinks a lot about Sandor, before and after the BoB.",
        "answer": "<p>Since the moment Sandor tells Sansa his secret, they don\u2019t speak to each other again until the day Joffrey comes to get her out bed and show her the heads of her father and Septa Mordane.\u00a0 Their relationship starts to develop more from that point forward, but its still in its budding stages.\u00a0 So yes, she does think of him a lot; however, we have to remember she is alone and he\u2019s her only tether to an authentic human interaction in the wake of her father\u2019s beheading.\u00a0 Sansa cannot be honest about her feelings and frustrations with her enemies.\u00a0 Her maids are spies, and most of the people at court want nothing to do with a traitor\u2019s daughter anyway.\u00a0 She must wear her lady\u2019s armor and pretend to be loyal and obedient.\u00a0 Sandor is her outlet to an extent, and he helps her survive.\u00a0 Then after he\u2019s gone, she wishes she had his counsel\u00a0before she goes to meet the Tyrells.\u00a0 Sansa has no choice at that point but to navigate these decisions entirely on her own, but his memory has come to represent shrewd judgment in a gauntlet of liars with their own agendas.\u00a0 Of course, there\u2019s the whole other layer of Sansa\u2019s\u00a0sexual maturation process and the development of her feelings for him which become more relevant as she\u2019s having more adult experiences and interactions.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>We also have to remember that Sansa thinks she already knows what happened to Arya before Ned\u2019s execution:</p><p><i> \u201cAnd at the end, near last, came the names Sansa had been dreading. Lady Catelyn Stark. Robb Stark. Brandon Stark, Rickon Stark, Arya Stark. Sansa stifled a gasp. Arya. They wanted Arya to present herself and swear an oath \u2026<b> it must mean her sister had fled on the galley, she must be safe at Winterfell by now</b> \u2026 \u201c &ndash; Sansa V, AGOT.</i><br/></p><p>If they obviously do not have Arya and they want her to swear an oath, it has to mean she is alive and escaped on the ship her father had procured.\u00a0 Sansa then imagines Arya made it to Winterfell.\u00a0 Something she will think about later in Clash:<br/></p><p><i>She missed Septa Mordane, and even more Jeyne Poole, her truest friend. The septa had lost her head with the rest, for the crime of serving House Stark. Sansa did not know what had happened to Jeyne, who had disappeared from her rooms afterward, never to be mentioned again. <b>She tried not to think of them too often, yet sometimes the memories came unbidden, and then it was hard to hold back the tears. Once in a while, Sansa even missed her sister. By now Arya was safe back in Winterfell, dancing and sewing, playing with Bran and baby Rickon, even riding through the winter town if she liked. Sansa was allowed to go riding too, but only in the bailey, and it got boring going round in a circle all day</b>. &ndash; Sansa II, ACOK</i><br/></p><p>This is a belief that keeps Sansa going and gives her some solace after Ned\u2019s execution.\u00a0 Arya is okay.\u00a0 She\u2019s safe and home.\u00a0 Admittedly, it\u2019s a very Sansa-colored fantasy for Arya, but Sansa imagines her sister living a normal, idyllic life before everything went to hell.\u00a0 And she\u2019s free.\u00a0 She can ride anywhere she wants to, unlike herself, but she\u2019s heartened by that.\u00a0 It\u2019s also tinged with sorrow and regret for disobeying her father and not getting on that galley because it recalls the last thing Arya said to her before Sansa lashed out in anger and before she understood who the real bad guys are:</p><p><i> &ldquo;Stop that weeping, child,&rdquo; Septa Mordane said sternly. &ldquo;<b>I am certain your lord father knows what is best for you.</b>&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be so bad, Sansa,&rdquo; Arya said. <b>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to sail on a galley. It will be an adventure, and then we&rsquo;ll be with Bran and Robb again</b>, and Old Nan and Hodor and the rest.&rdquo; She touched her on the arm.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Hodor!&rdquo; Sansa yelled. &ldquo;You ought to marry Hodor, you&rsquo;re just like him, stupid and hairy and ugly!&rdquo; She wrenched away from her sister&rsquo;s hand, stormed into her bedchamber, and barred the door behind her.\u00a0 &ndash; Sansa III, AGOT.</i></p><p>The aforementioned Clash passage also gives us a window into Sansa\u2019s coping strategy.\u00a0 The fact that Sansa cannot afford to crack and lose that self-control is one reason why she doesn\u2019t allow herself to think of her family (and Jeyne Poole) as much as we might think she ought to.\u00a0 It hurts too damn much.\u00a0 Sansa was in a suicidal depression in the days immediately following Ned\u2019s execution.\u00a0 She was staying in bed, not eating, being plagued by nightmares and praying for dead, dreamless sleep.\u00a0 That chapter of raw vulnerability is when the mask came off, and she told Joffrey she hated him to his face, told him she hoped Robb would bring her his head, and thought about murdering him herself.\u00a0 As profound as that moment was for her own character arc&rsquo;s conclusion in AGOT (and Sandor seeing her mettle), it\u2019s not going to be the way she endures, maintains her sanity, and eventually escapes.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>It will continue into her period as Alayne Stone; however, despite her efforts to suppress her Stark identity and the pain associated with it, Sansa cannot help it.\u00a0 She does think of her loved ones often, including Arya, and many times it\u2019s positive rather than negative before and after the BotBW.\u00a0 What Sansa says and thinks she is doing and what she actually does can be two different things.\u00a0 Remember she said \u201cthat day was done and so was Sansa\u201d in regards to Sandor and the unkiss&hellip; then proceeded to think about Sandor a few more times in the same chapter.\u00a0 Rest assured with your concerns.\u00a0 She thinks of Arya and all the people she cares about even though she says she shouldn\u2019t or won\u2019t allow herself to do that.\u00a0 But let me lay out all the positives before discussing the negatives.\u00a0 Lots of quotes under the cut.</p><!-- more --><p><i>He&rsquo;d owned a sword named Lion&rsquo;s Tooth once, Sansa remembered. <b>Arya had taken it from him and thrown it in a river. I hope Stannis does the same with this one</b>. &ldquo;It is beautifully wrought, Your Grace.&quot;\u00a0 &ndash; Sansa V, ACOK</i><br/></p><p><i> She sang for mercy, for the living and the dead alike, for Bran and Rickon and Robb, <b>for her sister Arya</b> and her bastard brother Jon Snow, away off on the Wall. &ndash; Sansa V, ACOK<br/></i></p><p><i> Margaery&rsquo;s kindness had been unfailing, and her presence changed everything. Her ladies welcomed Sansa as well. <b>It had been so long since she had enjoyed the company of other women, she had almost forgotten how pleasant it could be</b>. Lady Leonette gave her lessons on the high harp, and Lady Janna shared all the choice gossip. Merry Crane always had an amusing story, <b>and little Lady Bulwer reminded her of Arya, though not so fierce</b>. &ndash; Sansa II, ASOS.<br/></i></p><p><i> In Sansa&rsquo;s dreams, her children looked just like the brothers she had lost. <b>Sometimes there was even a girl who looked like Arya</b>. &ndash; Sansa II, ASOS.\u00a0\u00a0</i></p><p><i><b> That was such a sweet dream, Sansa thought drowsily. She had been back in Winterfell, running through the godswood with her Lady. Her father had been there, and her brothers, all of them warm and safe. If only dreaming could make it so &hellip; </b>She threw back the coverlets. I must be brave. Her torments would soon be ended, one way or the other. If Lady was here, I would not be afraid. <b>Lady was dead, though; Robb, Bran, Rickon, Arya, her father, her mother, even Septa Mordane. All of them are dead but me.</b> She was alone in the world now. &ndash; Sansa IV, ASOS. </i>[Sansa\u2019s inclusion of Arya here suggests she assumes she must have suffered the same fate as Bran and Rickon]<br/></p><p><i><b> She had dreamt that she was little, still sharing a bedchamber with her sister Arya. </b>But it was her maid she heard tossing in sleep, not her sister, and this was not Winterfell, but the Eyrie. &ndash; Sansa VII, ASOS.</i></p><p><i> She had last seen snow the day she&rsquo;d left Winterfell. That was a lighter fall than this, she remembered. Robb had melting flakes in his hair when he hugged me, <b>and the snowball Arya tried to make kept coming apart in her hands. It hurt to remember how happy she had been that morning</b>. &ndash; Sansa VII, ASOS.<br/></i></p><p><i> She remembered a summer&rsquo;s snow in Winterfell when Arya and Bran had ambushed her as she emerged from the keep one morning. They&rsquo;d each had a dozen snowballs to hand, and she&rsquo;d had none. Bran had been perched on the roof of the covered bridge, out of reach, but Sansa had chased Arya through the stables and around the kitchen until both of them were breathless.

                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>Since the moment Sandor tells Sansa his secret, they don&rsquo;t speak to each other again until the day Joffrey comes to get her out bed and show her the heads of her father and Septa Mordane.&nbsp; Their relationship starts to develop more from that point forward, but its still in its budding stages.&nbsp; So yes, she does think of him a lot; however, we have to remember she is alone and he&rsquo;s her only tether to an authentic human interaction in the wake of her father&rsquo;s beheading.&nbsp; Sansa cannot be honest about her feelings and frustrations with her enemies.&nbsp; Her maids are spies, and most of the people at court want nothing to do with a traitor&rsquo;s daughter anyway.&nbsp; She must wear her lady&rsquo;s armor and pretend to be loyal and obedient.&nbsp; Sandor is her outlet to an extent, and he helps her survive.&nbsp; Then after he&rsquo;s gone, she wishes she had his counsel&nbsp;before she goes to meet the Tyrells.&nbsp; Sansa has no choice at that point but to navigate these decisions entirely on her own, but his memory has come to represent shrewd judgment in a gauntlet of liars with their own agendas.&nbsp; Of course, there&rsquo;s the whole other layer of Sansa&rsquo;s&nbsp;sexual maturation process and the development of her feelings for him which become more relevant as she&rsquo;s having more adult experiences and interactions.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We also have to remember that Sansa thinks she already knows what happened to Arya before Ned&rsquo;s execution:</p>\n<p><i> &ldquo;And at the end, near last, came the names Sansa had been dreading. Lady Catelyn Stark. Robb Stark. Brandon Stark, Rickon Stark, Arya Stark. Sansa stifled a gasp. Arya. They wanted Arya to present herself and swear an oath &hellip;<b> it must mean her sister had fled on the galley, she must be safe at Winterfell by now</b> &hellip; &ldquo; &ndash; Sansa V, AGOT.</i><br /></p>\n<p>If they obviously do not have Arya and they want her to swear an oath, it has to mean she is alive and escaped on the ship her father had procured.&nbsp; Sansa then imagines Arya made it to Winterfell.&nbsp; Something she will think about later in Clash:<br /></p>\n<p><i>She missed Septa Mordane, and even more Jeyne Poole, her truest friend. The septa had lost her head with the rest, for the crime of serving House Stark. Sansa did not know what had happened to Jeyne, who had disappeared from her rooms afterward, never to be mentioned again. <b>She tried not to think of them too often, yet sometimes the memories came unbidden, and then it was hard to hold back the tears. Once in a while, Sansa even missed her sister. By now Arya was safe back in Winterfell, dancing and sewing, playing with Bran and baby Rickon, even riding through the winter town if she liked. Sansa was allowed to go riding too, but only in the bailey, and it got boring going round in a circle all day</b>. &ndash; Sansa II, ACOK</i><br /></p>\n<p>This is a belief that keeps Sansa going and gives her some solace after Ned&rsquo;s execution.&nbsp; Arya is okay.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s safe and home.&nbsp; Admittedly, it&rsquo;s a very Sansa-colored fantasy for Arya, but Sansa imagines her sister living a normal, idyllic life before everything went to hell.&nbsp; And she&rsquo;s free.&nbsp; She can ride anywhere she wants to, unlike herself, but she&rsquo;s heartened by that.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s also tinged with sorrow and regret for disobeying her father and not getting on that galley because it recalls the last thing Arya said to her before Sansa lashed out in anger and before she understood who the real bad guys are:</p>\n<p><i> &ldquo;Stop that weeping, child,&rdquo; Septa Mordane said sternly. &ldquo;<b>I am certain your lord father knows what is best for you.</b>&rdquo;</i></p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be so bad, Sansa,&rdquo; Arya said. <b>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to sail on a galley. It will be an adventure, and then we&rsquo;ll be with Bran and Robb again</b>, and Old Nan and Hodor and the rest.&rdquo; She touched her on the arm.</i></p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;Hodor!&rdquo; Sansa yelled. &ldquo;You ought to marry Hodor, you&rsquo;re just like him, stupid and hairy and ugly!&rdquo; She wrenched away from her sister&rsquo;s hand, stormed into her bedchamber, and barred the door behind her.&nbsp; &ndash; Sansa III, AGOT.</i></p>\n<p>The aforementioned Clash passage also gives us a window into Sansa&rsquo;s coping strategy.&nbsp; The fact that Sansa cannot afford to crack and lose that self-control is one reason why she doesn&rsquo;t allow herself to think of her family (and Jeyne Poole) as much as we might think she ought to.&nbsp; It hurts too damn much.&nbsp; Sansa was in a suicidal depression in the days immediately following Ned&rsquo;s execution.&nbsp; She was staying in bed, not eating, being plagued by nightmares and praying for dead, dreamless sleep.&nbsp; That chapter of raw vulnerability is when the mask came off, and she told Joffrey she hated him to his face, told him she hoped Robb would bring her his head, and thought about murdering him herself.&nbsp; As profound as that moment was for her own character arc&rsquo;s conclusion in AGOT (and Sandor seeing her mettle), it&rsquo;s not going to be the way she endures, maintains her sanity, and eventually escapes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It will continue into her period as Alayne Stone; however, despite her efforts to suppress her Stark identity and the pain associated with it, Sansa cannot help it.&nbsp; She does think of her loved ones often, including Arya, and many times it&rsquo;s positive rather than negative before and after the BotBW.&nbsp; What Sansa says and thinks she is doing and what she actually does can be two different things.&nbsp; Remember she said &ldquo;that day was done and so was Sansa&rdquo; in regards to Sandor and the unkiss&hellip; then proceeded to think about Sandor a few more times in the same chapter.&nbsp; Rest assured with your concerns.&nbsp; She thinks of Arya and all the people she cares about even though she says she shouldn&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t allow herself to do that.&nbsp; But let me lay out all the positives before discussing the negatives.&nbsp; Lots of quotes under the cut.</p>\n</p>",
