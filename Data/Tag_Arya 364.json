I don\u2019t have a date if you\u2019re not coming with me.\u201d Jon pouted, knowing all too well that Arya couldn\u2019t handle that. Most of the time he got what he wanted when he acted like a beaten puppy who\u2019s favorite toy was stolen. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so not cool to go to prom with your half brother.\u201d Arya rolled her eyes. \u201cIt&rsquo;s even less cool to go to prom with your baby half sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you calling yourself a baby now?\u201d Jon chuckled, but even his laugh couldn\u2019t completely mask the pain, clearly visible on his face. </p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go to prom alone?\u201d Arya shrugged. \u201cReally, Jon. I\u2019m not going. I swear. And I\u2019m for sure not going with you.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p><i>Tyrion</i></p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m begging you, lady Arya. Will you please accompany me to the ball next month?\u201d Tyrion leaned casually against one of the lockers with a rose pressed between his hands. He at least had put some effort in his invitation, but it still wouldn\u2019t be enough.</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s nothing personal, really.\u201d Arya let out a deep sigh. \u201cI&rsquo;m not going to the ball. Not with you. Not with anybody.\u201d Arya closed her own locker. \u201cBut, I\u2019ve heard Jon is still looking for a date, maybe the two of you can go together?\u201d</p><p>Tyrion furrowed his eyebrows and shook his head in disbelief. \u201cI would much rather go alone than in the company of your brother.\u201d Tyrion held the rose behind his back. \u201cI&rsquo;m terribly sorry. Jon is an amazing friend and we have much to bond over, but I draw the line at having dinner in the same restaurant with our dates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, good luck finding one.\u201d Arya walked past him to go to her next class.</p><p><i>Yara</i></p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Yara slid into the empty seat next to Arya\u2019s. \u201cI was wondering\u2026\u201d She shove a little closer towards Arya while she held her eyes firmly on the chalkboard filled with years and historical moments. \u201cWhat would you think about going to prom together? As dates?\u201d </p><p>Arya raised her eyebrows and for the first time in almost three years she wrote something down in her notebook. \u201cI&rsquo;m not going to prom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook\u2026\u201d Yara turned towards Arya and placed a hand on Arya\u2019s table. \u201cI understand you\u2019re not really into having a guy around you who doesn\u2019t want anything but getting in your pants after the ball is over, but\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said\u2026\u201d Arya spoke clearly, once again writing something down in her notebook while not even looking at the girl next to her. \u201cI&rsquo;m not going to that stupid prom. I don\u2019t care about it. Prom\u2019s are Sansa\u2019s thing. Not mine. Call me when there is a soccer tournament I can participate in.\u201d</p><p>Yara stood up from her seat again and Arya ripped the page from her notebook.</p><p>How often would she have to say that she was not interested in that stupid ball?</p><p><i>Hot Pie</i></p><p>Arya took a bite from the piece of cake Hot Pie had pushed towards her. She closed her eyes to enjoy the taste, the structure, the perfect pie like only Hot Pie could make it. \u201cThis\u2026is\u2026so\u2026good\u2026\u201d Arya moaned and took another bite, all of a sudden frowning when she tasted something weird, something different.</p><p>A second later she unfolded a tiny piece of paper. She looked at Hot Pie to see what it was all about, but it seemed as if he was busy avoiding her glance. </p><p><i>Would you want to go to prom with me?</i></p><p>Arya let out a deep sigh and placed the tiny piece of paper in front of her. \u201cWhy does everyone want to go to prom with me?\u201d </p><p>Hot Pie swallowed and although he turned his head towards her, he was still not looking at her. \u201cBecause\u2026\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYou&rsquo;re the only one I can imagine going with?\u201d</p><p>Arya let out a deep sigh. \u201cI&rsquo;m sorry, but I\u2019m not going, really.\u201d She stood up from her seat. \u201cBut thanks for the pie. I love the pie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;re welcome\u2026\u201d</p><p><i>Gendry</i></p><p>Arya threw her backpack over her shoulder while she left the girls locker room. Her hair was still wet and she was not sure if the shower had washed away all the sweat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard you\u2019ve been breaking hearts left and right, Stark girl.\u201d Gendry blocked her way, a huge grin on his handsome face. \u201cI assume that\u2019s because you wanted to make sure that if I\u2019d ask you, you could still say yes?\u201d</p><p>Arya rolled her eyes and shook her head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s because I\u2019m not going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone is going, Arya. You can\u2019t be the only one staying at home. And you don\u2019t have the excuse to not have a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what everyone does.\u201d Arya shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in that stupid ball. I don\u2019t want to be picked up by a limousine and having dinner in a fancy restaurant. I don\u2019t want to wear a pretty ball gown and dance all those stupid dances. I don\u2019t want to make pictures with crazy hats and other props. I\u2019m not going.\u201d</p><p>Gendry lifted his hands up and stepped aside. \u201cNo need to get angry, princess.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou could\u2019ve just said no.\u201d</p><p><i>Daenerys</i></p><p>Arya was on her way home. Robb and Jon had both offered her a ride, but she had not really felt like accepting it. She needed time to think, to be alone. It felt like she had been saying no to people the entire day and although she wouldn\u2019t change a thing about it, she still felt exhausted after doing so. </p><p>What made that stupid prom so important? Why was it such a big deal and why did so many people want her to be their date? It wasn\u2019t like she would look good in a dress. Well, maybe she would. She just wouldn\u2019t like wearing one. </p><p>\u201cArya?\u201d </p><p>Arya threw her head in her neck when she heard her name for the who knew how many-th time today. \u201cIf you\u2019re here to ask me to go to prom with you, the answer is no.\u201d </p><p>Daenerys furrowed her eyebrows and stood still. \u201cAsking you to prom? Why do you think I\u2019m interested in going to that prom?\u201d </p><p>Arya let out a relieved sigh and shrugged. \u201cBecause everyone seems to be? I\u2019ve been asked five times today if I wanted to be a date to that prom. I\u2019ve said no five times.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys let out a small chuckle and she wrapped an arm around Arya\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI&rsquo;ve heard about that. Your reputation proceeds you.\u201d She paused for a moment while they fell into step. \u201cI wanted to invite you for an alternative party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn alternative party?\u201d Arya slowed down until she almost stood still. </p><p>\u201cYes, a party without prom dresses, without photographers, without queens and kings and nasty competition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if you wouldn\u2019t win that competition if you\u2019d participate.\u201d Arya interrupted Daenerys. </p><p>\u201cIf being the keyword here.\u201d Daenerys smiled at the younger Stark. \u201cI am not going to that ball. Sansa can have the crown. I don\u2019t care about it. I\u2019d much rather hang out with you at home, wearing nothing but our pajamas, eating loads of chocolate and cookies and watching movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDany\u2026\u201d </p><p>Daenerys\u2019 smile faded. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t call me that. My brother calls me that when he\u2019s about to say something I won\u2019t like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, Daenerys\u2026\u201d Arya paused. \u201cI\u2019m not into girl\u2019s nights either.\u201d Arya shifted her weight from one leg to the other. \u201cI&rsquo;m not gonna braid your hair and discuss guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says I want to discuss guys? And I have a nanny to braid my hair.\u201d Daenerys winked. \u201cI was more thinking about calling this\u2026\u201d She hesitated for a moment. \u201cThe most casual date in history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDate?\u201d Arya widened her eyes and she let the words sink in. She had never really thought about dating. Not about dating guys. Not about dating girls. Not about dating anyone. Dating, that was Sansa\u2019s strongest suit and no matter how often her sister gave her unwanted advice, Arya had still not magically developed an interest in it. </p><p>Until now. </p><p>\u201cYes, a date.\u201d Daenerys dropped her arm. \u201cI know that normally people invite others to fancy restaurants or to the cinema or to prom, but\u2026\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI thought you\u2019d prefer an evening at home, just being ourselves.\u201d</p><p>Arya had to admit that it was surprisingly refreshing and that she wasn&rsquo;t against the idea. In her case, not being against an idea was probably the same as liking the idea. \u201cFine, why not?\u201d She smiled back at the pretty blonde. \u201cI&rsquo;ll go and find the ugliest pajamas I own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect anything else.\u201d</p>",

Will you please accompany me to the ball next month?\u201d Tyrion leaned casually against one of the lockers with a rose pressed between his hands. He at least had put some effort in his invitation, but it still wouldn\u2019t be enough.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing personal, really.\u201d Arya let out a deep sigh. \u201cI\u2019m not going to the ball. Not with you. Not with anybody.\u201d Arya closed her own locker. \u201cBut, I\u2019ve heard Jon is still looking for a date, maybe the two of you can go together?\u201d</p><p>Tyrion furrowed his eyebrows and shook his head in disbelief. \u201cI would much rather go alone than in the company of your brother.\u201d Tyrion held the rose behind his back. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry.

I don\u2019t have a date if you\u2019re not coming with me.\u201d Jon pouted, knowing all too well that Arya couldn\u2019t handle that. Most of the time he got what he wanted when he acted like a beaten puppy who\u2019s favorite toy was stolen. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so not cool to go to prom with your half brother.\u201d Arya rolled her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s even less cool to go to prom with your baby half sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you calling yourself a baby now?\u201d Jon chuckled, but even his laugh couldn\u2019t completely mask the pain, clearly visible on his face. </p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go to prom alone?\u201d Arya shrugged. \u201cReally, Jon. I\u2019m not going. I swear. And I\u2019m for sure not going with you.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p><i>Tyrion</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m begging you, lady Arya. Will you please accompany me to the ball next month?\u201d Tyrion leaned casually against one of the lockers with a rose pressed between his hands. He at least had put some effort in his invitation, but it still wouldn\u2019t be enough.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing personal, really.\u201d Arya let out a deep sigh. \u201cI\u2019m not going to the ball. Not with you. Not with anybody.\u201d Arya closed her own locker. \u201cBut, I\u2019ve heard Jon is still looking for a date, maybe the two of you can go together?\u201d</p><p>Tyrion furrowed his eyebrows and shook his head in disbelief. \u201cI would much rather go alone than in the company of your brother.\u201d Tyrion held the rose behind his back. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry. Jon is an amazing friend and we have much to bond over, but I draw the line at having dinner in the same restaurant with our dates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, good luck finding one.\u201d Arya walked past him to go to her next class.</p><p><i>Yara</i></p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Yara slid into the empty seat next to Arya\u2019s. \u201cI was wondering\u2026\u201d She shove a little closer towards Arya while she held her eyes firmly on the chalkboard filled with years and historical moments. \u201cWhat would you think about going to prom together? As dates?\u201d </p><p>Arya raised her eyebrows and for the first time in almost three years she wrote something down in her notebook. \u201cI\u2019m not going to prom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook\u2026\u201d Yara turned towards Arya and placed a hand on Arya\u2019s table. \u201cI understand you\u2019re not really into having a guy around you who doesn\u2019t want anything but getting in your pants after the ball is over, but\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said\u2026\u201d Arya spoke clearly, once again writing something down in her notebook while not even looking at the girl next to her. \u201cI\u2019m not going to that stupid prom. I don\u2019t care about it. Prom\u2019s are Sansa\u2019s thing. Not mine. Call me when there is a soccer tournament I can participate in.\u201d</p><p>Yara stood up from her seat again and Arya ripped the page from her notebook.</p><p>How often would she have to say that she was not interested in that stupid ball?</p><p><i>Hot Pie</i></p><p>Arya took a bite from the piece of cake Hot Pie had pushed towards her. She closed her eyes to enjoy the taste, the structure, the perfect pie like only Hot Pie could make it. \u201cThis\u2026is\u2026so\u2026good\u2026\u201d Arya moaned and took another bite, all of a sudden frowning when she tasted something weird, something different.</p><p>A second later she unfolded a tiny piece of paper. She looked at Hot Pie to see what it was all about, but it seemed as if he was busy avoiding her glance. </p><p><i>Would you want to go to prom with me?</i></p><p>Arya let out a deep sigh and placed the tiny piece of paper in front of her. \u201cWhy does everyone want to go to prom with me?\u201d </p><p>Hot Pie swallowed and although he turned his head towards her, he was still not looking at her. \u201cBecause\u2026\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one I can imagine going with?\u201d</p><p>Arya let out a deep sigh. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not going, really.\u201d She stood up from her seat. \u201cBut thanks for the pie. I love the pie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome\u2026\u201d</p><p><i>Gendry</i></p><p>Arya threw her backpack over her shoulder while she left the girls locker room. Her hair was still wet and she was not sure if the shower had washed away all the sweat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard you\u2019ve been breaking hearts left and right, Stark girl.\u201d Gendry blocked her way, a huge grin on his handsome face. \u201cI assume that\u2019s because you wanted to make sure that if I\u2019d ask you, you could still say yes?\u201d</p><p>Arya rolled her eyes and shook her head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s because I\u2019m not going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone is going, Arya. You can\u2019t be the only one staying at home. And you don\u2019t have the excuse to not have a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what everyone does.\u201d Arya shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in that stupid ball. I don\u2019t want to be picked up by a limousine and having dinner in a fancy restaurant. I don\u2019t want to wear a pretty ball gown and dance all those stupid dances. I don\u2019t want to make pictures with crazy hats and other props. I\u2019m not going.\u201d</p><p>Gendry lifted his hands up and stepped aside. \u201cNo need to get angry, princess.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou could\u2019ve just said no.\u201d</p><p><i>Daenerys</i></p><p>Arya was on her way home. Robb and Jon had both offered her a ride, but she had not really felt like accepting it. She needed time to think, to be alone. It felt like she had been saying no to people the entire day and although she wouldn\u2019t change a thing about it, she still felt exhausted after doing so. </p><p>What made that stupid prom so important? Why was it such a big deal and why did so many people want her to be their date? It wasn\u2019t like she would look good in a dress. Well, maybe she would. She just wouldn\u2019t like wearing one. </p><p>\u201cArya?\u201d </p><p>Arya threw her head in her neck when she heard her name for the who knew how many-th time today. \u201cIf you\u2019re here to ask me to go to prom with you, the answer is no.\u201d </p><p>Daenerys furrowed her eyebrows and stood still. \u201cAsking you to prom? Why do you think I\u2019m interested in going to that prom?\u201d </p><p>Arya let out a relieved sigh and shrugged. \u201cBecause everyone seems to be? I\u2019ve been asked five times today if I wanted to be a date to that prom. I\u2019ve said no five times.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys let out a small chuckle and she wrapped an arm around Arya\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ve heard about that. Your reputation proceeds you.\u201d She paused for a moment while they fell into step. \u201cI wanted to invite you for an alternative party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn alternative party?\u201d Arya slowed down until she almost stood still. </p><p>\u201cYes, a party without prom dresses, without photographers, without queens and kings and nasty competition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if you wouldn\u2019t win that competition if you\u2019d participate.\u201d Arya interrupted Daenerys. </p><p>\u201cIf being the keyword here.\u201d Daenerys smiled at the younger Stark. \u201cI am not going to that ball. Sansa can have the crown. I don\u2019t care about it. I\u2019d much rather hang out with you at home, wearing nothing but our pajamas, eating loads of chocolate and cookies and watching movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDany\u2026\u201d </p><p>Daenerys\u2019 smile faded. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t call me that. My brother calls me that when he\u2019s about to say something I won\u2019t like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, Daenerys\u2026\u201d Arya paused. \u201cI\u2019m not into girl\u2019s nights either.\u201d Arya shifted her weight from one leg to the other. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna braid your hair and discuss guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says I want to discuss guys? And I have a nanny to braid my hair.\u201d Daenerys winked. \u201cI was more thinking about calling this\u2026\u201d She hesitated for a moment. \u201cThe most casual date in history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDate?\u201d Arya widened her eyes and she let the words sink in. She had never really thought about dating. Not about dating guys. Not about dating girls. Not about dating anyone. Dating, that was Sansa\u2019s strongest suit and no matter how often her sister gave her unwanted advice, Arya had still not magically developed an interest in it. </p><p>Until now. </p><p>\u201cYes, a date.\u201d Daenerys dropped her arm. \u201cI know that normally people invite others to fancy restaurants or to the cinema or to prom, but\u2026\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI thought you\u2019d prefer an evening at home, just being ourselves.\u201d</p><p>Arya had to admit that it was surprisingly refreshing and that she wasn\u2019t against the idea. In her case, not being against an idea was probably the same as liking the idea. \u201cFine, why not?\u201d She smiled back at the pretty blonde. \u201cI\u2019ll go and find the ugliest pajamas I own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect anything else.\u201d</p></p>",
