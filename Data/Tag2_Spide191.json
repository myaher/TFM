My day-to-day challenges include making sure the characters are consistent and helping to ensure the performances match the director\u2019s vision. I\u2019m basically a cheerleader for animation. I\u2019ve been working on the film since 2016 helping to interpret the designs and paintings into animation. We have a bold, different visual style to this movie. It took over a year for us to develop that technology. We wanted to try something fresh. This has been a tough project, but we\u2019re hoping it will be a new frontier.</p><p><b>How big was this project for you?</b></p><p>This has been a pretty all-consuming job for the last two years, but I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. It\u2019s a dream job - the ten year old me is out of his mind with excitement right now.</p><p><b>How do you coordinate a team of that size?</b></p><p>We have an amazing team. They all care and they\u2019re all hard-working. A lot of these folks relocated to be a part of this project. When folks are inspired it makes hard work easier.</p><p><b>What are your favorite elements of animation that have been developed for this movie?</b></p><p>One of the things I really love is that we\u2019re animating on twos [Editor\u2019s note: Ones, twos, and threes refer to how long a single image holds on camera for in relationship to frames per second. Ones mean every single frame is different, so at 24 frames per second you\u2019ll have 24 individual and unique drawings with that second. Twos means that something holds for two frames, rather than one].</p><p>There\u2019s something pretty great about being on twos \u2013 it\u2019s crisper, it\u2019s pop art and every decision made on this project is based on the look of the comic books. Pop art graphic clarity is one of those things that we felt was critical. Getting two to work for more complicated things like hair or cloth simulations as well as camera operation was quite a collaborative feat. Once we got to a process where twos could be a thing we could modulate within a shot it became strictly a creative call for how and when to do it. Every single department in this movie rolled up their sleeves and just took it apart to figure out how to make it all work.</p><p><b>Is there anything new that you get to do with the characters that you wouldn\u2019t have been able to without the new animation technology?</b></p><p>Our new \u201cInkline\u201d tools would be a huge one. To make things feel even more like a comic book we knew we wanted inklines. We built several different ways to make a drawn line exist in 3D space with and around our characters and pandoras box has really opened up to all kinds of expressive possibilities we never had before. The power of the drawn line in incredible. A simple line can exaggerate an emotion, clarify an action, or describe a form. Having this tool in the hands of each animator has proven to be incredibly powerful.</p><p><b>Do you ever piece roughs together with storyboards or even clips from other animated films or shows to give the directors a general idea of what it will look like? </b></p><p>Absolutely. I do not waste time, so we use any technique we can to get ideas out there, to throw those ideas out. We have some people who sketch out ideas and take photos with their phones and submit those so we can look at them in the context of the shots. Other people talk through what they are designing. And some people take primitive balls or blocks and animate those just to give us a sense of how energy passes through the scenes, and what kind of movement we will be doing.</p><p><b>Some of the animators even film themselves acting out scenes as a reference. </b></p><p>There\u2019s some really good ones that I want to put into a second version of the film that is just made up of those! I look at influences from all over the place. It also helps rule out ideas, which is just as helpful as finding the answers.</p><p><b>Are there times when the voice-acting changes and shifts direction for your team?</b></p><p>A lot of performances are workshopped and they improve as we go, but ideally when animation starts it\u2019s with a final version of the reads.
