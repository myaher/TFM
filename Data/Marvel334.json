I had pitched an idea about a fleet of cargo ships getting torn apart in the Atlantic and you found out that they were shuttling mutants as slave labour.<br/>&quot;You found out was that Phoenix was going round the world taking things into her own hands and that she had basically returned as a god, which they did in X3. She had viewed herself as above the conflict, that she was here to end things on her terms, she was sick of the fighting and she was going to take things into her own hands and she did not give a s**t what the X-Men or the Brotherhood had to say about it.\n\n<br/>&quot;And ultimately the way it was going to end, at least the version I was pushing for, would be that Phoenix was kind of like the Starchild at the end of 2001, she didn\u2019t just get stabbed and die again, but she kind of chose to leave.&quot;The one idea that I loved, that I really wanted to do, was that Cyclops would build the Danger Room. He felt guilty that because the X-Men were too weak, they weren\u2019t strong enough or fast enough, that was the reason Jean died. If they were a ittle bit better at fighting, then she might still be alive. It was all about this guilt he had about her death and he built the Danger Room to train them to be better. In the end it really was about him not being able to let go of her and that causes the chaos and disruption in the movie and in the end it\u2019s about him letting her go.&quot;Ultimately she kind of becomes that cosmic force that Phoenix is known to be, she leaves Earth and becomes a god, or at least a higher level of intelligence, and she goes into the cosmos possibly to kick-start life somewhere else. The final scene for me would have been her telling Cyclops or her telling the X-Men \u2018I\u2019ll be watching.\u2019\u201d<br/></li><li>Also, Rogue would not get the cure as\u00a0\n\nMichael Dougherty said it made no sense.\u00a0\n\n &quot;The whole point of Rogue\u2019s character is that she is supposed to come to terms with who she is and also I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good to tell girls &lsquo;Yeah you should change yourselves so you can get a guy.\u2019\u201c\n\n</li></ul><p>Origins:Wolverine<br/></p><ul><li>Focus solely on Wolverine and Sabretooth. The first two thirds would be focused on them fighting in the various wars we saw in the opening credits. Have it be shown that Logan is as much as an animal as Creed. It\u2019s important to show this because Stryker\u2019s words to Logan should be true.\u00a0\u201cIf you knew the kind of person you used to be, the work we did together&hellip; People don&rsquo;t change, Wolverine. You were an animal then and you&rsquo;re an animal now. I just gave you claws.\u201c As both Logan and Creed volunteers for the Weapon X program, have the rest of the movie focus on Logan\u2019s relationship with Team X. The Scenes<br/>The last act would be Logan in the Weapon X program, ending with him escaping from it, not knowing who he is. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkXtmEWB8dw\" target=\"_blank\">The tone of the flashbacks from X-2 remains and would play out like those flashbacks.</a>\u00a0It ends with Logan screaming and escaping\u00a0Alkali Lake like it shows in X-2.\u00a0<br/></li><li>No Barakapool. Keep in that glorious Wade scene and show a Team X montage. But when Logan volunteers for the Weapon X program, have Stryker say\u00a0\u201cWade came to us for help with his cancer and we cured it\u201d that\u2019s it, that\u2019s all we get from Wade and we are left with wanting more and we do get the Deadpool movie.\u00a0</li></ul><p>X-Men:First Class</p><ul><li>Set First Class in the 80\u2032s.\u00a0\u00a0No historical revision. This is about Charles and Erik finding each other and working together to bringing the X-Men and the Brotherhood together.\u00a0\n\nCharles and Erik building Cerebro together. Finding\u00a0\n\nScott, Jean, Mystique, Wanda, Pietro, Hank and \n\nOroro\n\n</li><li>Mystique is not Charles\u2019 adopted sister and Mystique is not a hero. The people who made First Class, DOFP and Apocalypse forgot what made the character great in the first 3 movies. Mystique is proud of who she is and does not care what anyone thinks of her true appearance. She should not have to hide. So focus more on the aspect of her personality that the &quot;People like you were the reason I was afraid to go to school as a child&rdquo; and &ldquo;Because we shouldn&rsquo;t have to&rdquo; lines come from. Have it that humans abused her as a child and she kept on trying to be herself and the only place where Mystique was truly accepted was with Erik and The Brotherhood. Mystique is a villain, not a hero, Mystique is proud of who she is and should not hide who she is because the actress does not want to wear the make up.\u00a0</li><li>The Hellfire Club are the villains as they want to use Jean for the Dark Phoenix.<br/></li><li>It ends with Charles, Erik, The X-Men and The Brotherhood going their separate ways.\u00a0</li></ul><p>The Wolverine</p><ul><li>Only thing I\u2019d change is\u00a0\tWill Yun Lee\u2018s character is The Silver Samurai and The Silver Samurai is not a robot.<br/></li></ul><p>X-Men:Days Of Future Past</p><ul><li>Have it implied that Mystique and Azazel had Kurt and that Mystique had to give him up after Azazel\u2019s death and that everyone in the Brotherhood was being hunted. Mystique tells Erik and Charles\u00a0<br/></li><li>Raven does stop herself from killing Trask, but she is not known as a hero by the mutants.</li></ul><p>X-Men:Apocalypse\u00a0</p><ul><li>Apocalypse is set in the modern day with the original cast. It\u2019s one last adventure with the characters and cast we grew up with.\u00a0 Logan, Scott, Ororo, Angel, Rogue, Kitty, Jubilee, Bobby and Piotr. We also see the original brotherhood cast as well.<br/></li><li>Wolverine has his classic Wolverine suit that was teased in The Wolverine</li></ul><figure data-orig-width=\"318\" data-orig-height=\"159\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6e2872985cf8b9d2cacf14f87304028f/tumblr_inline_pb1jvbtWNH1r3va93_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"318\" data-orig-height=\"159\"/></figure><ul><li>Apocalypse looks like the concept art which is what he\u2019s meant to look like.\u00a0</li></ul><figure data-orig-width=\"1762\" data-orig-height=\"2170\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/58560ed6d3a4844a961434c253325dd5/tumblr_inline_pb1jtxEFAk1r3va93_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1762\" data-orig-height=\"2170\"/></figure><ul><li>The Horsemen Of Apocalypse would be.
