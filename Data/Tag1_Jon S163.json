        "question": "\"Everyone who's crossed her she's found a way to murder.\" I can definitely see this going through Jon's mind if Sansa is kidnapped.  Sansa and Arya were used as baragining chips in S1 for Robb but he chose not to go to KL.  Also, when Jon found out \"they\" were being held there he initially was going to go but was talked out of it and chose to honor his vows.  I think this will come back too.  Conflict of the heart.  \"You'd think of little else if you had too.\"  (tbc...)",
        "answer": "<blockquote><p>\n\nI think Jon will be consumed by this at this pt. So to make the stakes higher I think both the WW and Sansa getting kidnapped (if this does happen) will happen simultaneously. While I think Sansa and Cersei will have another showdown and Sansa being in KL against her will check so many boxes I can\u2019t just can\u2019t figure out why. Why kidnap and not just murder? Why would she think Jon would come when Robb didn\u2019t? Could LF might have told her something about their relationship?\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n\nAlso, if both Cersei and the WW happen at the same time then both of them will be right as far as who to be concerned about. How do you see this plot unfold? What will Jon\u2019s conflict be at this point? What will he decide? What role will Dany play in this? I would love your thoughts on this. Thank you!\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>Hey, nonnie!</p><p>I have to say \u2026 this kidnapping plot is slowly taking over my life. :))))) I\u2019ve been thinking about it a lot actually. And while the more time passes, the more I\u2019m convinced it will happen, the details of it are still a little fuzzy for me.\u00a0</p><p>So I guess I could start by saying why a kidnapping of Sansa by Cersei makes sense and what story boxes it would tick if it were to happen. After all, you don\u2019t make a plot choice if it doesn\u2019t help you achieve certain goals both thematically and in terms of story progression:\u00a0</p><p>1. <b>It would bring Sansa and Cersei face to face again:</b> this is VERY important for a number of reasons. Sansa was Cersei\u2019s\u00a0\u201clittle dove\u201d, the girl she attempted to mold to her will but also despised because she saw her as being weak and naive. Their relationship is rife for dramatic exploration and I don\u2019t know any writer worth his salt that wouldn\u2019t want to tap into that, particularly now that Sansa has grown and developed and they could flip the dynamic on its head, showing what Sansa has learned from all of her tormentors, Cersei included. This is also important because Sansa needs to go back to her:\u00a0\u201cIf I am ever queen, I will make them love me\u201d mentality. Right now she\u2019s vacillating and the question of her admiring Cersei hangs in the air, as per Jon\u2019s observation. The simplest way for Sansa to fully reject Cersei\u2019s worldview is by being faced with her once again, and choosing to the the Queen that people love, not the Queen that people fear. It\u2019s kind of a play on being faced with who you might become if you choose one road instead of another, sort of thing.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>2. <b>The Younger, More Beautiful Queen: </b>this prophecy has tormented Cersei her entire life and it\u2019s bound to conclude in its final act. If Sansa is the younger, more beautiful queen that will cast Cersei down and take all that she holds dear, it makes sense that she would be present for Cersei\u2019s demise, whatever that might be. I say present because while Sansa was involved for most of Cersei\u2019s tragedies, she was never the party responsible, she inadvertently found herself involved and I hope the pattern continues because I like the idea of prophecies not being played straight and that Cersei herself is ultimately responsible for her own downfall.\u00a0</p><p>3. <b>Sansa is the princess in the tower with no prince to save her: </b>for all the complaining that people do that Sansa can\u2019t do anything for herself and she always needs saving, the sad fact of the matter is Sansa has never truly been saved by anyone. As she herself puts it to LF: She\u2019s taken from monsters that murdered her family and given to other monsters that murdered her family. Her\u00a0\u201crescues\u201d are simply an exacerbation of her confinement. No one saves her. The one that comes closest is Theon but it\u2019s Sansa that pushes him to that point and thematically speaking this action is linked more to Theon regaining his identity that Sansa Stark being saved. Also, her reunion with Jon did not truly bring liberation because she was still stuck with LF and also her trauma has made her close herself off and put herself in a sort of emotional cage.\u00a0</p><p>As you mentioned, Robb actually refuses to risk the ire of his men to go and try to save Sansa so she\u2019s never truly a priority for someone, nor is she the goal, as the princess in the tower trope lays out. So to finally see someone make Sansa their priority and come to rescue her, despite all other consideration, would be a fulfilling arc. Particularly since Sansa keeps saying that no one can protect her. People have taken this to mean that Sansa doesn\u2019t want protection because she can take care of herself. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s it at all. Sophie Turner said that when Sansa reunites with Jon, it\u2019s the first moment of happiness Sansa has felt in years because she\u2019s finally with someone who will take care of her and look after her. So I think Sansa is still looking for that prince to protect her and save her. She just doesn\u2019t believe that exists anymore. So maybe it\u2019s time she be proven wrong.\u00a0</p><p>4. <b>Jon has a choice to make: </b>Jon has been teased with a choice between love and duty since season 1 and he\u2019s always chosen duty. But there were always extenuating\u00a0circumstances to his choice. When he wanted to join Robb\u2019s campaign, Joer Mormont pointed out that fighting the WW was more important on the grand scheme of things. Also Jon, at the time, was still the outcast, bastard of Winterfell, looking to forge his new identity. When he chose the NW over Ygritte, he had already made up his mind that he was a brother of the NW and that\u2019s where his life was (he tells Ygritte: I have to go home now) and also justified by the fact that Ygritte violent tendencies pushed him away in any case.\u00a0 However, in the end the loyalty that Jon showed to the NW was betrayed when he was killed by the very people who called themselves his brothers. When he came back from the dead, he was a man without a purpose or a plan (a weird thing for Jon Snow). It was Sansa that gave that to him, pushed him back into action so it would be easy to assume that whatever determination Jon might have now to fight the WW, protect the North and whatever else is inextricably linked to her. So what happens if she\u2019s in danger? Will Jon\u2019s choice between love and duty be as easy to make as it was in the past? I\u2019d argue no. Because Sansa is not only his love, but his duty as well. He\u2019s sworn to protect her time and time again and her safety and well being are paramount to him. So this time we\u2019re going to watch Jon choose love and what a sight that will be!\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>5. <b>Tension must be added to the Jon/D*ny dynamic: </b>And the parentage reveal is not enough. Because D*ny finding out Jon is a rival for the throne she\u2019s been dreaming about since season 1 is a political matter. Her seeing him lose his mind over the possibility of Cersei hurting Sansa is a deeply personal one. I always found it interesting that D*ny wasn\u2019t there to witness Jon\u2019s interaction with Theon on the beach and see his reaction when Theon brought up Sansa. But I\u2019m willing to bet good money she\u2019ll have a front row seat to Jon Snow going berserk because \u201chis sister\u201d is in danger. It will probably be the last nail in the coffin for the already doomed Jon/D*ny alliance. Also, at some point, Jon is going to ride Rhaegar, I\u2019m almost 100% sure of that. No way the writers are passing up the opportunity to have their number 1 hero mount a dragon or have this Dance of Dragons 2.0 end without a Jon/D*ny showdown on dragon back. So what better time for Jon to steal Rhaegal than when he needs to get to KL really, really fast?</p><p>6. <b>Jaime and Cersei need to meet again: </b>For one I believe that Jaime is the younger brother who will choke Cersei to death. For two, Cersei\u2019s storyline is so marked by wildfire that it would be weird not to have the man most traumatized by wildfire be there to stop her from using it (which I believe will be the reason why he ends up killing her, paralleling his killing of the Mad King). Jaime and Cersei\u2019s relationship is so toxic and tragic that it needs to end in the same vein, and\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t believe you\u201d and a quick exist North ain\u2019t gonna cut it. We know Jaime is going North to join the fight against the WW so the kidnapping plot might bring him back to KL, of his own accord or perhaps as Jon\u2019s hostage. (he\u2019s going to need some kind of leverage against Cersei, right? Who better than the only person left in the world Cersei actually cares about?)</p><p>7. <b>The feelings reveal needs to happen somehow: </b>At some point Jon and Sansa will need to confess their love for each other. So \u2026 what better time in terms of full emotional impact than after they\u2019ve been separated and they thought they\u2019d die/never see each other again?\u00a0</p><p>8. <b>The writers need to connect the Winterfell/WW plot to the King\u2019s Landing plot:</b> I mean what is Cersei going to do for at least 3 episodes? Walk around the Red Keep counting the villages she\u2019s taken back from D*ny with the help of the Golden Company? I mean, that would be the smart thing to do. Why march your armies into the North, in the dead of winter, with a zombie apocalypse underfoot? But then again, if characters acted smart and rational all the time, we\u2019d have much more boring plot lines, wouldn\u2019t we? The kidnapping of Sansa can bring the two narrative threads together.\u00a0</p><p>So both in terms of plot expediency as well as arc completion, the kidnapping plot neatly solves all sorts of issues as well as add drama and the all important cliff hangers GOT loves.\u00a0</p><p>As for how it will unfold \u2026 I think what we\u2019re truly missing in order to see the full picture is the: Why? Why does Cersei kidnap Sansa at this juncture in the story? She could have already done it in season 7, when Jon was away on Dragonstone. It would have been a hell of a lot easier to do than now, during the Long Night, with dragons circling Winterfell and huge armies fighting zombies. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have a clear answer to this. Something needs to happen \u2026 some unforeseen plot development that convinces Cersei to send her men to capture Sansa. What that might be, I\u2019m not sure.\u00a0</p><p>But it will probably also be the answer to your question about why kidnap Sansa and not just murder her. In addition to that, one other reason why Cersei wouldn\u2019t just murder Sansa is because of the way that Cersei gets her revenge. If we look at her revenge against Septa Ornella and Ellaria Sand, we can see that Cersei is not content to only murder her enemies, she wants to dish out the same amount and type of torment that was inflicted on her by the parties responsible.

Now imagine the fall out from that decision, the guilt that Jon would feel that he allowed them to walk through the gates, the angst, the torment! That would be great! So? In his desperation, he steals Rhaegal (and possibly Jaime) and goes to KL. The reason why I\u2019m so attached to Jon stealing Rhaegal at this juncture is that atop a dragon, Jon has more of a chance of getting out there alive with Sansa, than if he were to travel by boat.

Thank you!\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>Hey, nonnie!</p><p>I have to say \u2026 this kidnapping plot is slowly taking over my life. :))))) I\u2019ve been thinking about it a lot actually. And while the more time passes, the more I\u2019m convinced it will happen, the details of it are still a little fuzzy for me.\u00a0</p><p>So I guess I could start by saying why a kidnapping of Sansa by Cersei makes sense and what story boxes it would tick if it were to happen. After all, you don\u2019t make a plot choice if it doesn\u2019t help you achieve certain goals both thematically and in terms of story progression:\u00a0</p><p>1. <b>It would bring Sansa and Cersei face to face again:</b> this is VERY important for a number of reasons. Sansa was Cersei\u2019s\u00a0\u201clittle dove\u201d, the girl she attempted to mold to her will but also despised because she saw her as being weak and naive. Their relationship is rife for dramatic exploration and I don\u2019t know any writer worth his salt that wouldn\u2019t want to tap into that, particularly now that Sansa has grown and developed and they could flip the dynamic on its head, showing what Sansa has learned from all of her tormentors, Cersei included. This is also important because Sansa needs to go back to her:\u00a0\u201cIf I am ever queen, I will make them love me\u201d mentality. Right now she\u2019s vacillating and the question of her admiring Cersei hangs in the air, as per Jon\u2019s observation. The simplest way for Sansa to fully reject Cersei\u2019s worldview is by being faced with her once again, and choosing to the the Queen that people love, not the Queen that people fear. It\u2019s kind of a play on being faced with who you might become if you choose one road instead of another, sort of thing.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>2. <b>The Younger, More Beautiful Queen: </b>this prophecy has tormented Cersei her entire life and it\u2019s bound to conclude in its final act. If Sansa is the younger, more beautiful queen that will cast Cersei down and take all that she holds dear, it makes sense that she would be present for Cersei\u2019s demise, whatever that might be. I say present because while Sansa was involved for most of Cersei\u2019s tragedies, she was never the party responsible, she inadvertently found herself involved and I hope the pattern continues because I like the idea of prophecies not being played straight and that Cersei herself is ultimately responsible for her own downfall.\u00a0</p><p>3. <b>Sansa is the princess in the tower with no prince to save her: </b>for all the complaining that people do that Sansa can\u2019t do anything for herself and she always needs saving, the sad fact of the matter is Sansa has never truly been saved by anyone. As she herself puts it to LF: She\u2019s taken from monsters that murdered her family and given to other monsters that murdered her family. Her\u00a0\u201crescues\u201d are simply an exacerbation of her confinement. No one saves her. The one that comes closest is Theon but it\u2019s Sansa that pushes him to that point and thematically speaking this action is linked more to Theon regaining his identity that Sansa Stark being saved. Also, her reunion with Jon did not truly bring liberation because she was still stuck with LF and also her trauma has made her close herself off and put herself in a sort of emotional cage.\u00a0</p><p>As you mentioned, Robb actually refuses to risk the ire of his men to go and try to save Sansa so she\u2019s never truly a priority for someone, nor is she the goal, as the princess in the tower trope lays out. So to finally see someone make Sansa their priority and come to rescue her, despite all other consideration, would be a fulfilling arc. Particularly since Sansa keeps saying that no one can protect her. People have taken this to mean that Sansa doesn\u2019t want protection because she can take care of herself. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s it at all. Sophie Turner said that when Sansa reunites with Jon, it\u2019s the first moment of happiness Sansa has felt in years because she\u2019s finally with someone who will take care of her and look after her. So I think Sansa is still looking for that prince to protect her and save her. She just doesn\u2019t believe that exists anymore. So maybe it\u2019s time she be proven wrong.\u00a0</p><p>4. <b>Jon has a choice to make: </b>Jon has been teased with a choice between love and duty since season 1 and he\u2019s always chosen duty. But there were always extenuating\u00a0circumstances to his choice. When he wanted to join Robb\u2019s campaign, Joer Mormont pointed out that fighting the WW was more important on the grand scheme of things. Also Jon, at the time, was still the outcast, bastard of Winterfell, looking to forge his new identity. When he chose the NW over Ygritte, he had already made up his mind that he was a brother of the NW and that\u2019s where his life was (he tells Ygritte: I have to go home now) and also justified by the fact that Ygritte violent tendencies pushed him away in any case.\u00a0 However, in the end the loyalty that Jon showed to the NW was betrayed when he was killed by the very people who called themselves his brothers. When he came back from the dead, he was a man without a purpose or a plan (a weird thing for Jon Snow). It was Sansa that gave that to him, pushed him back into action so it would be easy to assume that whatever determination Jon might have now to fight the WW, protect the North and whatever else is inextricably linked to her. So what happens if she\u2019s in danger? Will Jon\u2019s choice between love and duty be as easy to make as it was in the past? I\u2019d argue no. Because Sansa is not only his love, but his duty as well. He\u2019s sworn to protect her time and time again and her safety and well being are paramount to him. So this time we\u2019re going to watch Jon choose love and what a sight that will be!\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>5. <b>Tension must be added to the Jon/D*ny dynamic: </b>And the parentage reveal is not enough. Because D*ny finding out Jon is a rival for the throne she\u2019s been dreaming about since season 1 is a political matter. Her seeing him lose his mind over the possibility of Cersei hurting Sansa is a deeply personal one. I always found it interesting that D*ny wasn\u2019t there to witness Jon\u2019s interaction with Theon on the beach and see his reaction when Theon brought up Sansa. But I\u2019m willing to bet good money she\u2019ll have a front row seat to Jon Snow going berserk because \u201chis sister\u201d is in danger. It will probably be the last nail in the coffin for the already doomed Jon/D*ny alliance. Also, at some point, Jon is going to ride Rhaegar, I\u2019m almost 100% sure of that.

Sophie Turner said that when Sansa reunites with Jon, it\u2019s the first moment of happiness Sansa has felt in years because she\u2019s finally with someone who will take care of her and look after her. So I think Sansa is still looking for that prince to protect her and save her. She just doesn\u2019t believe that exists anymore. So maybe it\u2019s time she be proven wrong.\u00a0</p><p>4. <b>Jon has a choice to make: </b>Jon has been teased with a choice between love and duty since season 1 and he\u2019s always chosen duty. But there were always extenuating\u00a0circumstances to his choice. When he wanted to join Robb\u2019s campaign, Joer Mormont pointed out that fighting the WW was more important on the grand scheme of things. Also Jon, at the time, was still the outcast, bastard of Winterfell, looking to forge his new identity. When he chose the NW over Ygritte, he had already made up his mind that he was a brother of the NW and that\u2019s where his life was (he tells Ygritte: I have to go home now) and also justified by the fact that Ygritte violent tendencies pushed him away in any case.\u00a0 However, in the end the loyalty that Jon showed to the NW was betrayed when he was killed by the very people who called themselves his brothers. When he came back from the dead, he was a man without a purpose or a plan (a weird thing for Jon Snow). It was Sansa that gave that to him, pushed him back into action so it would be easy to assume that whatever determination Jon might have now to fight the WW, protect the North and whatever else is inextricably linked to her. So what happens if she\u2019s in danger? Will Jon\u2019s choice between love and duty be as easy to make as it was in the past? I\u2019d argue no. Because Sansa is not only his love, but his duty as well. He\u2019s sworn to protect her time and time again and her safety and well being are paramount to him. So this time we\u2019re going to watch Jon choose love and what a sight that will be!\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>5. <b>Tension must be added to the Jon/D*ny dynamic: </b>And the parentage reveal is not enough. Because D*ny finding out Jon is a rival for the throne she\u2019s been dreaming about since season 1 is a political matter. Her seeing him lose his mind over the possibility of Cersei hurting Sansa is a deeply personal one. I always found it interesting that D*ny wasn\u2019t there to witness Jon\u2019s interaction with Theon on the beach and see his reaction when Theon brought up Sansa. But I\u2019m willing to bet good money she\u2019ll have a front row seat to Jon Snow going berserk because \u201chis sister\u201d is in danger. It will probably be the last nail in the coffin for the already doomed Jon/D*ny alliance. Also, at some point, Jon is going to ride Rhaegar, I\u2019m almost 100% sure of that. No way the writers are passing up the opportunity to have their number 1 hero mount a dragon or have this Dance of Dragons 2.0 end without a Jon/D*ny showdown on dragon back. So what better time for Jon to steal Rhaegal than when he needs to get to KL really, really fast?</p><p>6. <b>Jaime and Cersei need to meet again: </b>For one I believe that Jaime is the younger brother who will choke Cersei to death. For two, Cersei\u2019s storyline is so marked by wildfire that it would be weird not to have the man most traumatized by wildfire be there to stop her from using it (which I believe will be the reason why he ends up killing her, paralleling his killing of the Mad King). Jaime and Cersei\u2019s relationship is so toxic and tragic that it needs to end in the same vein, and\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t believe you\u201d and a quick exist North ain\u2019t gonna cut it. We know Jaime is going North to join the fight against the WW so the kidnapping plot might bring him back to KL, of his own accord or perhaps as Jon\u2019s hostage. (he\u2019s going to need some kind of leverage against Cersei, right? Who better than the only person left in the world Cersei actually cares about?)</p><p>7. <b>The feelings reveal needs to happen somehow: </b>At some point Jon and Sansa will need to confess their love for each other. So \u2026 what better time in terms of full emotional impact than after they\u2019ve been separated and they thought they\u2019d die/never see each other again?\u00a0</p><p>8. <b>The writers need to connect the Winterfell/WW plot to the King\u2019s Landing plot:</b> I mean what is Cersei going to do for at least 3 episodes? Walk around the Red Keep counting the villages she\u2019s taken back from D*ny with the help of the Golden Company? I mean, that would be the smart thing to do. Why march your armies into the North, in the dead of winter, with a zombie apocalypse underfoot? But then again, if characters acted smart and rational all the time, we\u2019d have much more boring plot lines, wouldn\u2019t we? The kidnapping of Sansa can bring the two narrative threads together.\u00a0</p><p>So both in terms of plot expediency as well as arc completion, the kidnapping plot neatly solves all sorts of issues as well as add drama and the all important cliff hangers GOT loves.\u00a0</p><p>As for how it will unfold \u2026 I think what we\u2019re truly missing in order to see the full picture is the: Why? Why does Cersei kidnap Sansa at this juncture in the story? She could have already done it in season 7, when Jon was away on Dragonstone. It would have been a hell of a lot easier to do than now, during the Long Night, with dragons circling Winterfell and huge armies fighting zombies. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have a clear answer to this. Something needs to happen \u2026 some unforeseen plot development that convinces Cersei to send her men to capture Sansa. What that might be, I\u2019m not sure.\u00a0</p><p>But it will probably also be the answer to your question about why kidnap Sansa and not just murder her. In addition to that, one other reason why Cersei wouldn\u2019t just murder Sansa is because of the way that Cersei gets her revenge. If we look at her revenge against Septa Ornella and Ellaria Sand, we can see that Cersei is not content to only murder her enemies, she wants to dish out the same amount and type of torment that was inflicted on her by the parties responsible. I imagine she will want to do the same thing to Sansa.\u00a0</p><p>Could this happen simultaneously with the WW attack? Again, I don\u2019t know. Feels like a lot to juggle but it could \u2026 Maybe the kidnapping happens during the WW final battle and Jon going to KL is the start of the Dance of Dragons part of the story line? Maybe Jon steals Rhaegal to go rescue Sansa and D*ny pursues him on Drogon? Just ideas at this point \u2026</p><p>One theory I do have is that Cersei need not attack Winterfell to get Sansa. After all, Cersei did promise to help against the WW. That would mean that the Winterfell gang, at least in theory, will be waiting for her tropes to arrive. Any day now \u2026 Almost there \u2026 There they are! They show up, Winterfell opens their gates and boom, somewhere during the night, Euron (it would need to be Euron, wouldn\u2019t it? he\u2019s the only one crazy enough to attempt it particularly if Cersei commits to marrying him) and his merry men abduct Sansa. Now imagine the fall out from that decision, the guilt that Jon would feel that he allowed them to walk through the gates, the angst, the torment! That would be great! So? In his desperation, he steals Rhaegal (and possibly Jaime) and goes to KL. The reason why I\u2019m so attached to Jon stealing Rhaegal at this juncture is that atop a dragon, Jon has more of a chance of getting out there alive with Sansa, than if he were to travel by boat. I mean he needs to take precautions, despite whatever Cersei might say/promise. He\u2019s not a moron.\u00a0</p><p>As for what happens in KL,it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess at this point because again we must return to that pesky: why. Although I have to say, that whatever might happen, it won\u2019t be that pretty for Sansa. I don\u2019t see any way it could be. In the end, she will triumph but it will be an angst riddled couple of weeks for all of us.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>If anyone has scenarios to share here, please feel free.\u00a0</p><p>Thank you for the ask, nonnie!</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><blockquote><p>\n\nI think Jon will be consumed by this at this pt. So to make the stakes higher I think both the WW and Sansa getting kidnapped (if this does happen) will happen simultaneously. While I think Sansa and Cersei will have another showdown and Sansa being in KL against her will check so many boxes I can&rsquo;t just can&rsquo;t figure out why. Why kidnap and not just murder? Why would she think Jon would come when Robb didn&rsquo;t? Could LF might have told her something about their relationship?\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n\nAlso, if both Cersei and the WW happen at the same time then both of them will be right as far as who to be concerned about. How do you see this plot unfold? What will Jon&rsquo;s conflict be at this point? What will he decide? What role will Dany play in this? I would love your thoughts on this. Thank you!\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>Hey, nonnie!</p><p>I have to say &hellip; this kidnapping plot is slowly taking over my life. :))))) I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it a lot actually. And while the more time passes, the more I&rsquo;m convinced it will happen, the details of it are still a little fuzzy for me.&nbsp;</p><p>So I guess I could start by saying why a kidnapping of Sansa by Cersei makes sense and what story boxes it would tick if it were to happen. After all, you don&rsquo;t make a plot choice if it doesn&rsquo;t help you achieve certain goals both thematically and in terms of story progression:&nbsp;</p><p>1. <b>It would bring Sansa and Cersei face to face again:</b> this is VERY important for a number of reasons. Sansa was Cersei&rsquo;s&nbsp;&ldquo;little dove&rdquo;, the girl she attempted to mold to her will but also despised because she saw her as being weak and naive. Their relationship is rife for dramatic exploration and I don&rsquo;t know any writer worth his salt that wouldn&rsquo;t want to tap into that, particularly now that Sansa has grown and developed and they could flip the dynamic on its head, showing what Sansa has learned from all of her tormentors, Cersei included. This is also important because Sansa needs to go back to her:&nbsp;&ldquo;If I am ever queen, I will make them love me&rdquo; mentality. Right now she&rsquo;s vacillating and the question of her admiring Cersei hangs in the air, as per Jon&rsquo;s observation. The simplest way for Sansa to fully reject Cersei&rsquo;s worldview is by being faced with her once again, and choosing to the the Queen that people love, not the Queen that people fear. It&rsquo;s kind of a play on being faced with who you might become if you choose one road instead of another, sort of thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>2. <b>The Younger, More Beautiful Queen: </b>this prophecy has tormented Cersei her entire life and it&rsquo;s bound to conclude in its final act. If Sansa is the younger, more beautiful queen that will cast Cersei down and take all that she holds dear, it makes sense that she would be present for Cersei&rsquo;s demise, whatever that might be. I say present because while Sansa was involved for most of Cersei&rsquo;s tragedies, she was never the party responsible, she inadvertently found herself involved and I hope the pattern continues because I like the idea of prophecies not being played straight and that Cersei herself is ultimately responsible for her own downfall.&nbsp;</p><p>3. <b>Sansa is the princess in the tower with no prince to save her: </b>for all the complaining that people do that Sansa can&rsquo;t do anything for herself and she always needs saving, the sad fact of the matter is Sansa has never truly been saved by anyone. As she herself puts it to LF: She&rsquo;s taken from monsters that murdered her family and given to other monsters that murdered her family. Her&nbsp;&ldquo;rescues&rdquo; are simply an exacerbation of her confinement. No one saves her. The one that comes closest is Theon but it&rsquo;s Sansa that pushes him to that point and thematically speaking this action is linked more to Theon regaining his identity that Sansa Stark being saved. Also, her reunion with Jon did not truly bring liberation because she was still stuck with LF and also her trauma has made her close herself off and put herself in a sort of emotional cage.&nbsp;</p><p>As you mentioned, Robb actually refuses to risk the ire of his men to go and try to save Sansa so she&rsquo;s never truly a priority for someone, nor is she the goal, as the princess in the tower trope lays out. So to finally see someone make Sansa their priority and come to rescue her, despite all other consideration, would be a fulfilling arc. Particularly since Sansa keeps saying that no one can protect her. People have taken this to mean that Sansa doesn&rsquo;t want protection because she can take care of herself. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s it at all. Sophie Turner said that when Sansa reunites with Jon, it&rsquo;s the first moment of happiness Sansa has felt in years because she&rsquo;s finally with someone who will take care of her and look after her. So I think Sansa is still looking for that prince to protect her and save her. She just doesn&rsquo;t believe that exists anymore. So maybe it&rsquo;s time she be proven wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>4. <b>Jon has a choice to make: </b>Jon has been teased with a choice between love and duty since season 1 and he&rsquo;s always chosen duty.

        "answer": "<p>Hey, nonnie!</p><p>I both agree and disagree on this. :)</p><p>Honestly I don\u2019t think Jon and Arya were ever alike or that their bond came down to them being similar people. In book canon, Jon and Arya share the Stark look (Jon looks like Ned and Arya looks like Lyanna) and I suppose you could argue Kit Harrington and Maisie Williams look more like each other than either of them looks like Sophie Turner but that\u2019s about it.\u00a0</p><p>What Jon and Arya really are is a Ned x Lyanna 2.0. And just like Ned and Lyanna, Jon and Arya aren\u2019t really similar in personality. Ned is quiet, introverted, even shy. He\u2019s the\u00a0\u201cstill waters run deep\u201d type of man. Whereas Lyanna is the extroverted, impulsive sister with a penchant for over-dramatic theatricality (her dressing up as the Knight of the Laughing Tree at the tourney, for example).\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0I\u2019d say Jon and Sansa have always been more alike in behavior, character and worldview. They\u2019re both introverts where Arya is an extrovert. They both dream of a domestic, quiet life where Arya dreams about adventure and finding out\u00a0\u201cwhat\u2019s West of Westeros\u201d. Jon is a conformist, just like Sansa, who can\u2019t conform to the standards of the time because he\u2019s a bastard while Arya could fit in pretty nicely in her society because she\u2019s the daughter of a great Lord but can\u2019t because her interests and desires push her to buck convention.\u00a0</p><p>Jon and Arya\u2019s bond comes from their acceptance and support for each other, not their similarities. The one thing they share is the feeling that they\u2019re both outcasts in the Stark family and in society. They are different but they acknowledge each other as individuals and give each other the acceptance that they feel others are denying them. It\u2019s no mistake that in the books Arya thinks Jon will recognize her and love her even when her other family members might not. Because the love that Jon and Arya feel for each other is not conditional on what conventional society expects from them.\u00a0That\u2019s a really special, beautiful bond.\u00a0</p><p>I have theorized in the past that Jon and Arya\u2019s relationship might be strained once they\u2019re reunited but I don\u2019t think that would be a permanent issue or that their bond will suffer dramatically. Both Jon and Arya have grown and developed apart for some time now so it would be silly to say that there won\u2019t be any changes to their relationship. Whenever Jon thinks of Arya he thinks of the little sister he remembers, the little girl he said good-bye to in Winterfell. But that little girl has grown now and has gone through harrowing experiences. Arya thinks of Jon as her big brother and her childhood companion but Jon has now been through being a man of the Night\u2019s Watch, Lord Commander and King in the North. He\u2019s not the same kid that left Winterfell either. They\u2019ll both have to get to know each other again and figure out what their relationship now as adults will be like.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019ve already stated that in the absence of the political Jon theory, Arya might have some pretty big bones to pick with Jon over his decision to bend the knee and bring D*ny to Winterfell. On the other hand, I think Jon might take issue with Arya\u2019s revenge quest and her list. We\u2019ve already seen how he reacted to Sansa proposing to take Last Hearth and Karhold from Ned Umber and Alys Karstark.\u00a0</p><p>Wholesale revenge and cruelty are not things Jon prescribes to. He can be ruthless at times (his Wildling plot), use violence when he feels he needs to (the execution of Janos Slynt) but the type of violence that Arya has been engaged in I think will give him pause. That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019ll reject her or stop loving her but I do think these traits will cause him concern and might result in them clashing. However, those strains will be temporary. Arya\u2019s entire journey has been leading her back to Winterfell, and most particularly to Jon. Whereas she might not care whether Sansa might be shocked by the list of people she wants to kill (although her insecure look back at Sansa when Bran mentioned the list is an indication that she does care), she most definitely will care what Jon thinks. I imagine that will lead her to reexamine her actions and her behavior and hopefully find a balance between the brilliant warrior and the empathetic, sweet girl she still is deep down.\u00a0</p><p>As for Sansa and Arya \u2026 I don\u2019t know about them being closer to each other than Jon and Arya but I do think they\u2019ll be closer than what we saw in season 7. That was the promise made at the end of the last season and probably the only saving grace of that whole Winterfell plot line. Also, considering the comments made by both Sophie and Maisie about Sansa and Arya making a good team, I think there\u2019s reason to hope that Arya and Sansa will finally come together as individuals, love and respect each other and fight for one another as a pack.\u00a0</p><p>I was also surprised that in the new teaser, Arya and Sansa share a look but Arya doesn\u2019t share one with Jon. I don\u2019t think we should infer much of anything regarding the Jon/Arya relationship from that because it\u2019s one of the big payoffs of the show so they\u2019d probably want to keep what happens between them pretty close to the vest but that look that Sansa and Arya share does give me hope that we\u2019ll have the healthy, beautiful sister bond we\u2019ve all been dreaming about from season 8 Sansa and Arya.\u00a0</p><p>Thanks for the ask, nonnie!</p>",

In book canon, Jon and Arya share the Stark look (Jon looks like Ned and Arya looks like Lyanna) and I suppose you could argue Kit Harrington and Maisie Williams look more like each other than either of them looks like Sophie Turner but that\u2019s about it.\u00a0</p><p>What Jon and Arya really are is a Ned x Lyanna 2.0. And just like Ned and Lyanna, Jon and Arya aren\u2019t really similar in personality. Ned is quiet, introverted, even shy. He\u2019s the\u00a0\u201cstill waters run deep\u201d type of man. Whereas Lyanna is the extroverted, impulsive sister with a penchant for over-dramatic theatricality (her dressing up as the Knight of the Laughing Tree at the tourney, for example).\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0I\u2019d say Jon and Sansa have always been more alike in behavior, character and worldview. They\u2019re both introverts where Arya is an extrovert. They both dream of a domestic, quiet life where Arya dreams about adventure and finding out\u00a0\u201cwhat\u2019s West of Westeros\u201d. Jon is a conformist, just like Sansa, who can\u2019t conform to the standards of the time because he\u2019s a bastard while Arya could fit in pretty nicely in her society because she\u2019s the daughter of a great Lord but can\u2019t because her interests and desires push her to buck convention.\u00a0</p><p>Jon and Arya\u2019s bond comes from their acceptance and support for each other, not their similarities. The one thing they share is the feeling that they\u2019re both outcasts in the Stark family and in society. They are different but they acknowledge each other as individuals and give each other the acceptance that they feel others are denying them. It\u2019s no mistake that in the books Arya thinks Jon will recognize her and love her even when her other family members might not. Because the love that Jon and Arya feel for each other is not conditional on what conventional society expects from them.\u00a0That\u2019s a really special, beautiful bond.\u00a0</p><p>I have theorized in the past that Jon and Arya\u2019s relationship might be strained once they\u2019re reunited but I don\u2019t think that would be a permanent issue or that their bond will suffer dramatically. Both Jon and Arya have grown and developed apart for some time now so it would be silly to say that there won\u2019t be any changes to their relationship. Whenever Jon thinks of Arya he thinks of the little sister he remembers, the little girl he said good-bye to in Winterfell. But that little girl has grown now and has gone through harrowing experiences. Arya thinks of Jon as her big brother and her childhood companion but Jon has now been through being a man of the Night\u2019s Watch, Lord Commander and King in the North. He\u2019s not the same kid that left Winterfell either. They\u2019ll both have to get to know each other again and figure out what their relationship now as adults will be like.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019ve already stated that in the absence of the political Jon theory, Arya might have some pretty big bones to pick with Jon over his decision to bend the knee and bring D*ny to Winterfell. On the other hand, I think Jon might take issue with Arya\u2019s revenge quest and her list. We\u2019ve already seen how he reacted to Sansa proposing to take Last Hearth and Karhold from Ned Umber and Alys Karstark.\u00a0</p><p>Wholesale revenge and cruelty are not things Jon prescribes to. He can be ruthless at times (his Wildling plot), use violence when he feels he needs to (the execution of Janos Slynt) but the type of violence that Arya has been engaged in I think will give him pause. That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019ll reject her or stop loving her but I do think these traits will cause him concern and might result in them clashing. However, those strains will be temporary. Arya\u2019s entire journey has been leading her back to Winterfell, and most particularly to Jon. Whereas she might not care whether Sansa might be shocked by the list of people she wants to kill (although her insecure look back at Sansa when Bran mentioned the list is an indication that she does care), she most definitely will care what Jon thinks. I imagine that will lead her to reexamine her actions and her behavior and hopefully find a balance between the brilliant warrior and the empathetic, sweet girl she still is deep down.\u00a0</p><p>As for Sansa and Arya \u2026 I don\u2019t know about them being closer to each other than Jon and Arya but I do think they\u2019ll be closer than what we saw in season 7. That was the promise made at the end of the last season and probably the only saving grace of that whole Winterfell plot line. Also, considering the comments made by both Sophie and Maisie about Sansa and Arya making a good team, I think there\u2019s reason to hope that Arya and Sansa will finally come together as individuals, love and respect each other and fight for one another as a pack.\u00a0</p><p>I was also surprised that in the new teaser, Arya and Sansa share a look but Arya doesn\u2019t share one with Jon. I don\u2019t think we should infer much of anything regarding the Jon/Arya relationship from that because it\u2019s one of the big payoffs of the show so they\u2019d probably want to keep what happens between them pretty close to the vest but that look that Sansa and Arya share does give me hope that we\u2019ll have the healthy, beautiful sister bond we\u2019ve all been dreaming about from season 8 Sansa and Arya.\u00a0</p><p>Thanks for the ask, nonnie!</p>",
