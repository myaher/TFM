But you have nothing to worry about, even if things do go wrong it doesn\u2019t matter, you\u2019ve got each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d She replied.</p><p>Soon enough their car pulled up outside the venue; a beautiful lakeside garden Wanda had found.</p><p>Tony stepped out first, coming over to Anna\u2019s side to open the door. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I\u2019ll ever be,\u201d Anna replied, stepping out and taking her brother\u2019s hand, bouquet held in the other.</p><p>From the car park it was a short walk through the gardens to get to the wedding site. On any other day she was sure she would\u2019ve enjoyed this walk, but she couldn\u2019t focus on any of the beautiful details now. Her excitement, and nerves, were building with every step.</p><p>They quickly arrived at the gate in the hedges. The gate was closed, but Wanda and Cassie were waiting for them on their side.</p><p>Cassie gasped when she saw Anna, \u201cOh my gosh, your wedding dress is so pretty!\u201d</p><p>The dress was simple, but very pretty. The slight V neck and thin straps made it look elegant, and the light skirt seemed to float around her.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Anna replied, smiling. \u201cYour dress looks pretty too.\u201d</p><p>Wanda came over to adjust Anna\u2019s flower crown, \u201cEverything\u2019s gone perfectly so far, all that\u2019s left is us.\u201d</p><p>Knowing that there hadn\u2019t been any problems so far helped calm Anna.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she said.</p><p>Wanda\u2019s magic swirled around, slowly easing the gate open as the music started. She stepped out first, walking down the aisle.</p><p>Once she reached the end Cassie went next, sprinkling purple and blue flower petals down the aisle.</p><p>Anna glanced at Tony, who was already smiling at her. </p><p>She didn\u2019t hesitate to step out from behind the hedge and through the gate.</p><p>The scene in front of her was more beautiful than she could have ever imagined (and she had done a lot of imagining). </p><p>All the wedding guests had turned to look at her. Usually she didn\u2019t like to be the centre of attention but she couldn\u2019t care less now.</p><p>The decorations were just as her bridesmaids had described them, all purple and blue, which contrasted perfectly with the colours of the garden. </p><p>When she looked to the altar, a giant flower covered arch, she saw Sharon, the officiant, as well as the bridesmaids, groomsmen, and Clint and Wanda, the best man and maid of honour.</p><p>And her Fianc\u00e9, Pietro, the man she was about to marry.</p><p>He looked extremely handsome in his black suit. Anna was glad Tony was holding her hand, otherwise she might not have been able to resist running up and kissing him.</p><p>The walk down the aisle felt painfully long, yet Anna found herself enjoying every moment of it. She loved the way Pietro was gazing at her as if there was no one else in the whole world. </p><p>She still couldn\u2019t believe this was actually happening. She was about to be married to the man of her dreams.</p><p> When they reached the end of the aisle the music quietened. Anna took her place at the altar, standing by Pietro. Neither of them said anything. The look they shared was worth more than a thousand words.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Sharon spoke up, \u201cWe\u2019re gathered here today to celebrate the relationship of Anna and Pietro, and to be witnesses and supporters of the commitment they share with one another.\u201d</p><p>Anna couldn\u2019t help but smile at her words. Sharon had been Anna\u2019s best friend since childhood and was glad to have a part in the wedding.</p><p>\u201cThey wanted me to thank you all for being here today. And to remind each and every one of you of the part you\u2019ve played in their lives, if it weren\u2019t for you they wouldn&rsquo;t be where they are today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of which,\u201d she added, \u201cnone were more important than their families. That being said, who gives the bride away in marriage to this man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d Tony said, \u201cShe\u2019s her own person, not property to be given away. But she has my blessing.\u201d</p><p>Anna had known that her brother would say something like this. They\u2019d discussed the whole walking down the aisle thing, which was an idea that Anna liked, but the whole giving the bride away thing bothered her. She wasn\u2019t his property. </p><p>But hearing him say it was perfect. This was her own choice, no one was giving her away, but she knew that he still supported her decision.</p><p>Tony pulled her in for one last hug and a kiss on the cheek before moving to stand with the rest of the groomsmen. Anna handed her bouquet to Wanda so she could hold hands with Pietro.</p><p>\u201cLove isn\u2019t always perfect.\u201d Sharon said, \u201cit isn\u2019t a fairytale or a storybook. And it doesn\u2019t always come easy. Love is overcoming obstacles, facing challenges, fighting to be together, holding on and never letting go. It\u2019s a short word, easy to spell, difficult to define, and impossible to live without. Love is work, but most of all, love is realising that every hour, every minute, and every second was worth it, because you did it together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you\u2019ve prepared vows?\u201d</p><p>Anna nodded. She\u2019d written them down, but she\u2019d gone over them in her head so many times that she\u2019d memorised them. \u201cBefore I met you, I thought I knew how love worked. I understood the chemistry, how attraction was created by hormones and neurotrophins. But no amount of understanding could have prepared me for actually experiencing it. And I do think that this is the only time I\u2019ve experienced it, there were times before when I thought that I\u2019d been in love, but it was nothing compared to what I feel for you. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is, falling in love has been the greatest experience of my life, and I\u2019m glad it was with you.\u201d</p><p>Pietro didn\u2019t need to respond with words, his reaction was crystal clear from the way he looked at her with complete adoration. </p><p>After a few moments, he spoke in Sokovian. \u201cI often find myself thinking that it\u2019d be impossible for me to fall any more in love with you, yet every single time you manage to prove me wrong. Words can\u2019t describe how much I care about you. And even if you don\u2019t think you\u2019re perfect, you\u2019re perfect for me.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t surprised that he said it in Sokovian. He wasn\u2019t always the best at showing his affection with words, and she knew he\u2019d be more comfortable saying it if she was one of the only ones who could hear him. In fact, knowing that barely anyone else knew what he said made the words melt her heart even more.</p><p>Sharon motioned to Wanda and Clint, who handed the rings to Anna and Pietro. \u201cThe couple will now exchange rings to symbolise their commitment. Pietro, please take Anna\u2019s hand and repeat these words.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand, and Anna managed to get a look at the ring. It was a thin rose gold band covered in purple and white gemstones.</p><p>\u201cI give you this ring as a symbol of our union,\u201d Sharon said.</p><p>\u201cI give you this ring as a symbol of our union,\u201d Pietro repeated, slipping the ring onto Anna\u2019s finger.</p><p>\u201cAnna, please take Pietro\u2019s hand and repeat these words,\u201d Sharon said. \u201cI give you this ring as a symbol of our union.\u201d</p><p>Anna took his hand, \u201cI give you this ring as a symbol of our union.\u201d</p><p>She slipped the ring onto his finger. To some people the ring Anna had made him may have looked strange, with it\u2019s uneven edge and blue colour, but now that it had connected to its other half, the silver engagement ring, it looked perfect, the uneven edges lining up beautifully.</p><p>\u201cNow, I have one last question for you\u2026\u201d Sharon said. \u201cAnnabeth, do you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband; and promise to love and be faithful to him until the end of your days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPietro, do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife; and promise to love and be faithful to her until the end of your days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the power vested in me I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride.\u201d</p><p>Pietro wrapped his arms around her, pulling her close and kissing her. Anna\u2019s arms snaked around his neck and she pressed herself even closer.</p><p>It was the best kiss she\u2019d ever had, and it ended far too soon.</p><p>Everyone was still clapping and cheering when they broke apart, still staying close with their foreheads touching.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t quite believe it. They were <i>married.</i></p><p>\u201cI love you so much,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d he replied.</p><p>This was the ending of their story, their epilogue. But Anna knew their adventures were just beginning.</p><p><i>We\u2019re in the endgame now.</i></p>",

But you have nothing to worry about, even if things do go wrong it doesn\u2019t matter, you\u2019ve got each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d She replied.</p><p>Soon enough their car pulled up outside the venue; a beautiful lakeside garden Wanda had found.</p><p>Tony stepped out first, coming over to Anna\u2019s side to open the door. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I\u2019ll ever be,\u201d Anna replied, stepping out and taking her brother\u2019s hand, bouquet held in the other.</p><p>From the car park it was a short walk through the gardens to get to the wedding site. On any other day she was sure she would\u2019ve enjoyed this walk, but she couldn\u2019t focus on any of the beautiful details now. Her excitement, and nerves, were building with every step.</p><p>They quickly arrived at the gate in the hedges. The gate was closed, but Wanda and Cassie were waiting for them on their side.</p><p>Cassie gasped when she saw Anna, \u201cOh my gosh, your wedding dress is so pretty!\u201d</p><p>The dress was simple, but very pretty. The slight V neck and thin straps made it look elegant, and the light skirt seemed to float around her.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Anna replied, smiling. \u201cYour dress looks pretty too.\u201d</p><p>Wanda came over to adjust Anna\u2019s flower crown, \u201cEverything\u2019s gone perfectly so far, all that\u2019s left is us.\u201d</p><p>Knowing that there hadn\u2019t been any problems so far helped calm Anna.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she said.</p><p>Wanda\u2019s magic swirled around, slowly easing the gate open as the music started. She stepped out first, walking down the aisle.</p><p>Once she reached the end Cassie went next, sprinkling purple and blue flower petals down the aisle.</p><p>Anna glanced at Tony, who was already smiling at her. </p><p>She didn\u2019t hesitate to step out from behind the hedge and through the gate.</p><p>The scene in front of her was more beautiful than she could have ever imagined (and she had done a lot of imagining). </p><p>All the wedding guests had turned to look at her. Usually she didn\u2019t like to be the centre of attention but she couldn\u2019t care less now.</p><p>The decorations were just as her bridesmaids had described them, all purple and blue, which contrasted perfectly with the colours of the garden. </p><p>When she looked to the altar, a giant flower covered arch, she saw Sharon, the officiant, as well as the bridesmaids, groomsmen, and Clint and Wanda, the best man and maid of honour.</p><p>And her Fianc\u00e9, Pietro, the man she was about to marry.</p><p>He looked extremely handsome in his black suit. Anna was glad Tony was holding her hand, otherwise she might not have been able to resist running up and kissing him.</p><p>The walk down the aisle felt painfully long, yet Anna found herself enjoying every moment of it. She loved the way Pietro was gazing at her as if there was no one else in the whole world. </p><p>She still couldn\u2019t believe this was actually happening. She was about to be married to the man of her dreams.</p><p> When they reached the end of the aisle the music quietened. Anna took her place at the altar, standing by Pietro. Neither of them said anything. The look they shared was worth more than a thousand words.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Sharon spoke up, \u201cWe\u2019re gathered here today to celebrate the relationship of Anna and Pietro, and to be witnesses and supporters of the commitment they share with one another.\u201d</p><p>Anna couldn\u2019t help but smile at her words. Sharon had been Anna\u2019s best friend since childhood and was glad to have a part in the wedding.</p><p>\u201cThey wanted me to thank you all for being here today. And to remind each and every one of you of the part you\u2019ve played in their lives, if it weren\u2019t for you they wouldn\u2019t be where they are today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of which,\u201d she added, \u201cnone were more important than their families. That being said, who gives the bride away in marriage to this man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d Tony said, \u201cShe\u2019s her own person, not property to be given away. But she has my blessing.\u201d</p><p>Anna had known that her brother would say something like this. They\u2019d discussed the whole walking down the aisle thing, which was an idea that Anna liked, but the whole giving the bride away thing bothered her. She wasn\u2019t his property. </p><p>But hearing him say it was perfect. This was her own choice, no one was giving her away, but she knew that he still supported her decision.</p><p>Tony pulled her in for one last hug and a kiss on the cheek before moving to stand with the rest of the groomsmen. Anna handed her bouquet to Wanda so she could hold hands with Pietro.</p><p>\u201cLove isn\u2019t always perfect.\u201d Sharon said, \u201cit isn\u2019t a fairytale or a storybook. And it doesn\u2019t always come easy. Love is overcoming obstacles, facing challenges, fighting to be together, holding on and never letting go. It\u2019s a short word, easy to spell, difficult to define, and impossible to live without. Love is work, but most of all, love is realising that every hour, every minute, and every second was worth it, because you did it together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you\u2019ve prepared vows?\u201d</p><p>Anna nodded. She\u2019d written them down, but she\u2019d gone over them in her head so many times that she\u2019d memorised them. \u201cBefore I met you, I thought I knew how love worked. I understood the chemistry, how attraction was created by hormones and neurotrophins. But no amount of understanding could have prepared me for actually experiencing it. And I do think that this is the only time I\u2019ve experienced it, there were times before when I thought that I\u2019d been in love, but it was nothing compared to what I feel for you. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is, falling in love has been the greatest experience of my life, and I\u2019m glad it was with you.\u201d</p><p>Pietro didn\u2019t need to respond with words, his reaction was crystal clear from the way he looked at her with complete adoration. </p><p>After a few moments, he spoke in Sokovian. \u201cI often find myself thinking that it\u2019d be impossible for me to fall any more in love with you, yet every single time you manage to prove me wrong. Words can\u2019t describe how much I care about you. And even if you don\u2019t think you\u2019re perfect, you\u2019re perfect for me.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t surprised that he said it in Sokovian. He wasn\u2019t always the best at showing his affection with words, and she knew he\u2019d be more comfortable saying it if she was one of the only ones who could hear him. In fact, knowing that barely anyone else knew what he said made the words melt her heart even more.</p><p>Sharon motioned to Wanda and Clint, who handed the rings to Anna and Pietro. \u201cThe couple will now exchange rings to symbolise their commitment. Pietro, please take Anna\u2019s hand and repeat these words.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand, and Anna managed to get a look at the ring. It was a thin rose gold band covered in purple and white gemstones.</p><p>\u201cI give you this ring as a symbol of our union,\u201d Sharon said.</p><p>\u201cI give you this ring as a symbol of our union,\u201d Pietro repeated, slipping the ring onto Anna\u2019s finger.</p><p>\u201cAnna, please take Pietro\u2019s hand and repeat these words,\u201d Sharon said. \u201cI give you this ring as a symbol of our union.\u201d</p><p>Anna took his hand, \u201cI give you this ring as a symbol of our union.\u201d</p><p>She slipped the ring onto his finger. To some people the ring Anna had made him may have looked strange, with it\u2019s uneven edge and blue colour, but now that it had connected to its other half, the silver engagement ring, it looked perfect, the uneven edges lining up beautifully.</p><p>\u201cNow, I have one last question for you\u2026\u201d Sharon said. \u201cAnnabeth, do you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband; and promise to love and be faithful to him until the end of your days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPietro, do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife; and promise to love and be faithful to her until the end of your days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the power vested in me I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride.\u201d</p><p>Pietro wrapped his arms around her, pulling her close and kissing her. Anna\u2019s arms snaked around his neck and she pressed herself even closer.</p><p>It was the best kiss she\u2019d ever had, and it ended far too soon.</p><p>Everyone was still clapping and cheering when they broke apart, still staying close with their foreheads touching.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t quite believe it. They were <i>married.</i></p><p>\u201cI love you so much,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d he replied.</p><p>This was the ending of their story, their epilogue. But Anna knew their adventures were just beginning.</p><p><i>We\u2019re in the endgame now.</i></p></p>",
