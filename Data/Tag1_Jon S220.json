People say Brienne and Jaime are so romantic but they can\u2019t see Jonsa?? They even had a long forhead kiss and serious eye-fucking, lip staring.

But when the snow falls, Sansa just wants to built a snowman</small></p><p><small><i>Canon Divergence // Canon Compliant</i>\u00a0</small></p></blockquote><p>The cold wind screamed when it whirled around the castle. It creeped through each window and door, no matter how firmly shut it was. It filled the hallways, the living room, the bedroom and even the throne room where King Jon Snow welcomed his guests. </p><p>King Jon Snow. Sansa still couldn\u2019t get used to the sound of it, to how the words tasted on her tongue, to everyone screaming the phrase on the top of their longs. </p><p>He deserved the title. He deserved it after what he had done for the North and after what he had done for Westeros. When someone dared to even think that Jon Snow had not worked hard enough to claim the throne, Sansa was the first to protest, to order Arya to take care of the matter before she would do so herself.</p><p>And Arya was always happy to oblige. </p><p>But Sansa also worried about Jon, carrying the weight of ruling on his shoulders and the weight of the crown on his head. The frown on his forehead deepened each day. The smile on his face faded each night. And sometimes Sansa missed the bastard he had once been, long before Ned Stark had lost his head in a dangerous game of chess with the ruling Lannisters, long before Robb Stark had led an army sound to avenge his father and had lost his life in the process, long before Jon lost whatever innocence he had once had. </p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d Sansa reached for Jon\u2019s hand and lead him to the giant window. The courtyard was covered in a thick layer of snow and more and more snowflakes were dangling to the ground to accompany the million others slowly melting there. </p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Jon turned his face towards her. Not too long ago she had been capable of making his worries disappear, of thawing his heart, of relaxing his brain. But now not even looking at her could ease the constant tension he was carrying around.</p><p>\u201cI want to build a snowman.\u201d Sansa curled her lips up into a slight smile. \u201cJust like in all those stories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou read too much, Sansa.\u201d Jon shook his head, but a slight smile spread across his face. \u201cYou will freeze to death.\u201d</p><p>Sansa reached for Jon\u2019s hands and squeezed them firmly. \u201cYou can keep me warm.\u201d She pulled him a little closer towards her. \u201cI know you\u2019re a king now, with responsibilities and boring meetings to attend, but do me this one favor. One favor and I will leave you be for the upcoming months.\u201d</p><p>Jon let out a deep sigh, but then he gestured for the warm cloak Sansa had once made him. \u201cIf your lips turn blue\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust kiss them.\u201d Sansa interrupted him and pulled him towards the door. \u201cWe&rsquo;re Starks. We\u2019re made for this. We\u2019re supposed to carry crowns of melting snowflakes in our hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m glad at least one of us is still dreaming these days.\u201d</p>",

        "body": "<p>After much criticism of incest, I can not see the author ending his story with an incest. Moreover, even though he loves the Targaryen, George has shown enough that their reign and way of thinking was not good, that their dynasty was doomed. He can not finish by restoring the Targaryen. If Jon is one of them, it&rsquo;s because they were not all bad and it would be a shame if their lineage goes out. But their custom and violence must disappear.</p><p>I often see the pro-Jonerys say that the story is about Dany and Jon, that they are soulmates. We can write a story on 2 characters without them necessarily end together. Plus, I think they&rsquo;re more of a mirror for each other. Two Targaryen of the same age but with different culture, different experiences, different traditions. One closer to the Targaryen values \u200b\u200bthat caused the fall of this dynasty and the other having more honorable values. They are a family and intended to be opposed to the other to show which value is the best. <br/></p><p>Yes, the Targaryen were for incest. But the author and the public to whom his books are addressed are against. And the end is supposed to bring a moral, and not revive a vicious circle. Not to mention the fact that Jon did not have a Targaryen education. He would never agree to be with his aunt.</p><p>I do not even speak of the idea of \u200b\u200btheir baby on the throne who seems to me quite creepy (possible but \ncreepy). Jon did not have to be a Targaryen to have a child with Daenerys (the death of Viserions could have been enough). In addition, Game of Thrones shows us people playing and learning the throne game. It is not for this to end with a baby who has not accomplished anything by himself and who risks being crazy because born of incest.</p><p>This is not trivial if the revelation of Jon&rsquo;s identity takes place at the end of season 6. If Jonerys really was the great couple, it would have been better to let us discover it before knowing their family bond. We could have appreciated their meeting, seeing them build a relationship, fall in love and then the revelation will come. The spectators, involved in this romance, would be shocked, disgusted but, at the same time, already attached to this couple. This would have been beneficial in all respects: shock announcement, reversal of situation and credibility of the couple. <br/></p><p>Yet we learn this in Season 6, long before Jon meets Daenerys. This is a marked desire to take the audience a step back. Thus, when Dany and Jon meet and she will degrade Jon by claiming her right to the throne, the viewer will know that Jon is also an heir and her nephew. It becomes more complicated to appreciate and approve this romance. Even more when their love scene is interspersed with the image of Dany&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s wedding and Bran&rsquo;s voiceover announcing that Jon is the rightful heir. <br/></p><p>Everything is done to make us feel uncomfortable and worried about the danger that this coming together and this revelation will have over the rest of the story.</p><p><br/></p><p><strike>P/S : I have nothing against those who do not think like me. We all have different visions. But when these people insult and mock other ship or point of view while their own is questionable, I have a problem.</strike></p>",
