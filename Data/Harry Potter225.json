She\u2019s tough, not in an unpleasant way, but she\u2019s gutsy. He needs to be with someone who can stand the demands of being with Harry Potter because he\u2019s a scary boyfriend in a lot of ways. He\u2019s a marked man. I think she\u2019s funny, and I think that she\u2019s very warm and compassionate. These are all things that Harry requires in his ideal woman. But, I felt \u2014 and I\u2019m talking years ago when all this was planned \u2014 initially, she\u2019s terrified by his image. I mean, he\u2019s a bit of a rock god to her when she sees him first, at 10 or 11, and he\u2019s this famous boy. So Ginny had to go through a journey as well. And rather like with Ron, I didn\u2019t want Ginny to be the first girl that Harry ever kissed. That\u2019s something I meant to say, and it\u2019s kind of tied in. One of the ways in which I tried to show that Harry has done a lot of growing up \u2014 in Phoenix, remember when Cho comes into the compartment, and he thinks, \u2018I wish I could have been discovered sitting with better people,\u2019 basically? He\u2019s with Luna and Neville. So literally the identical thing happens in Prince, and he\u2019s with Luna and Neville again, but this time, he has grown up, and as far as he\u2019s concerned he is with two of the coolest people on the train. They may not look that cool. Harry has really grown. And I feel that Ginny and Harry, in this book, they are total equals. They are worthy of each other. They\u2019ve both gone through a big emotional journey, and they\u2019ve really got over a lot of delusions \u2026 together. So, I enjoyed writing that.

I think she&rsquo;s funny, and I think that she&rsquo;s very warm and compassionate. These are all things that Harry requires in his ideal woman. But, I felt &mdash; and I&rsquo;m talking years ago when all this was planned &mdash; initially, she&rsquo;s terrified by his image. I mean, he&rsquo;s a bit of a rock god to her when she sees him first, at 10 or 11, and he&rsquo;s this famous boy. So Ginny had to go through a journey as well. And rather like with Ron, I didn&rsquo;t want Ginny to be the first girl that Harry ever kissed. That&rsquo;s something I meant to say, and it&rsquo;s kind of tied in. One of the ways in which I tried to show that Harry has done a lot of growing up &mdash; in Phoenix, remember when Cho comes into the compartment, and he thinks, &lsquo;I wish I could have been discovered sitting with better people,&rsquo; basically? He&rsquo;s with Luna and Neville. So literally the identical thing happens in Prince, and he&rsquo;s with Luna and Neville again, but this time, he has grown up, and as far as he&rsquo;s concerned he is with two of the coolest people on the train. They may not look that cool. Harry has really grown. And I feel that Ginny and Harry, in this book, they are total equals. They are worthy of each other. They&rsquo;ve both gone through a big emotional journey, and they&rsquo;ve really got over a lot of delusions &hellip; together. So, I enjoyed writing that. I really like Ginny as a character.&rdquo;</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know if it was planned from the beginning, but <b>(that&rsquo;s now my opinion)</b> it feels like, you know?&nbsp;Maybe JKR had the idea about Harry x Ginny, but in the beginning, she was not quite sure if she should implement the idea.&nbsp;</p>",

Pining ensues, and Harry\u2019s magic is all over the place. You can also read it <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16232024\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> on Ao3! :D</p><hr><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan for these things to happen, you know.\u201d</p><p>He should have stayed home for a while longer. He should have just stayed at his flat and went back on the first day of term, like he has always done for the past three years.</p><p>Harry does not even remember why he accepted Minerva\u2019s invitation to come back to Hogwarts earlier than planned, if not only to get a head start on lesson plans and to gather his wits about him in preparation for the coming term.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s more distressing: that I\u2019m so used to these things happening that it no longer surprises me, or that I know you well enough to believe you.\u201d</p><p>Harry bites back a sigh as he is half-dragged towards the hospital wing with one, lean arm around his waist.</p><p>See, if he had stayed at home then he would not be in this mess in the first place. If he had stayed at home, then he would not have had to spend the remainder of the holidays in such close proximity with Draco and he would not have had to deal with all of these unfortunate circumstances.</p><p>\u201cNormal people wouldn\u2019t find either situation distressing,\u201d Harry answers.</p><p>\u201cNormal people do not attempt to transfigure themselves into part-squid, part-scarhead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t on purpose,\u201d Harry says, with an air of someone who has just admitted defeat. He does not even bother to be worked-up about the all too familiar jibe about his forehead. He doesn\u2019t even think that it counts as an insult anymore, on both ends.</p><p>\u201cAnd that makes it so much better, does it?\u201d the elegant drawl is tinged with exasperation, and Harry doesn\u2019t know whether to make good use of the wiggling things on his head and strangle the git, or to slump against the arm that was keeping him standing. \u201cYou should have listened to Minerva.\u201d</p><p>Or maybe it was all Draco\u2019s fault in the first place.</p><p>Harry could have accepted the invitation from Minerva, and Draco, instead of accepting his own invitation and coming back to Hogwarts two days after Harry arrived, should have just stayed at home with his son and stretched out the remainder of their time together before the term starts.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as it looks, Draco,\u201d Harry sighs.</p><p>\u201cYou have things growing out of your head that are worse than your hair, which is quite a remarkable feat even for you,\u201d he says, in an afterthought, \u201cAnd your legs are useless, slimy, lumps of jelly.\u201d</p><p>Harry tries not to roll his eyes and quip some remark about Draco\u2019s ability of stating the obvious and unnecessary.</p><p>\u201cTentacles,\u201d Harry says as one, grey tentacle wraps itself around Draco\u2019s leg, almost making the both of them fall over.</p><p>\u201cYes, those,\u201d Draco mutters, trying to shake off the one tentacle that was still looping itself around his leg. He raises a pale eyebrow, \u201cYou needn\u2019t have gone through all this trouble just to grope me, you know.\u201d</p><p>Harry tries not to sound too indignant. \u201cI\u2019m not doing it on purpose, you git.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. They are <i>your </i>limbs,\u201d he says with a roll of his eyes.</p><p>But then he looks at Harry and though his tone is all wry amusement and maybe disgust at the little, squiggly bundles on Harry\u2019s head that makes him look like the evil sea witch, Harry thinks that he sees a flash of concern as grey eyes take him in from head to toe.</p><p>They wobble around a corner, and with Draco\u2019s attention otherwise occupied, Harry\u2019s other tentacle almost topples over the suit of armour. \u00a0Draco releases a drawn out sigh. He resumes their trek to the hospital wing, albeit not as steady as before. It appears that for the moment, he has given up trying to dislodge the stubborn thing on his leg.</p><p>Harry eyes his companion. He notes the faint crease on his forehead, and the way his lips are set in a thin line. Harry sighs, practically hearing the admonishing tone seep through that disapproving expression. \u201cJust spit it out, Draco.\u201d</p><p>Draco narrows his eyes but says nothing. He merely tightens his hold around Harry\u2019s waist and then proceeds to half-dragging him through the open doors of the hospital wing.</p><p>To Poppy\u2019s credit, her eyes widen only a fraction of a second before she descends on Harry with that all too familiar stern look on her face. \u201cThree days. Why am I not surprised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI actually gave him two days. He did pretty well, considering,\u201d Draco quips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here, you know,\u201d Harry frowns.</p><p>\u201cYes, very hard to forget what with your jelly thing still attached to my leg, Potter.\u201d</p><p>Harry does not even bother to correct him anymore. And it isn\u2019t as if he wants to have his tentacle all wrapped around Draco\u2019s leg. Well. Not entirely. But he would have removed it by now if he had any idea how.</p><p>\u201cSet him down on the bed, then, Draco.\u201d</p><p>Draco sits him down gingerly atop the hospital bed, and the both of them let out a relieved breath. Harry feels parts embarrassed and parts guilty about the fact that Draco had to half-drag, half-carry him to the Hospital Wing\u2014 he wasn\u2019t exactly feather-light, despite being on the lean, almost thin side\u2014 but he thinks about the disappointment shooting through his veins about how he has to stay on the bed, without Draco\u2019s warm, steady arm around him, now that they were here, and the guilt almost overwhelms whatever embarrassment Harry thinks he should be feeling right about now.</p><p>Of course, thinking about their trip to the Infirmary only triggered Harry\u2019s thoughts to wander down dangerous paths. He could still feel the ghost of Draco\u2019s warm hand on his waist, and the lean arm against his back, and he could still smell the scent of cinnamon and coffee that clung to his side, that was so distinctly <i>Draco</i> that Harry swore he could\u2014</p><p>\u201cHave you noticed anything that sets it off? Anything that aggravates the condition?\u201d</p><p>Harry blinks and tries to refocus. He shrugs.</p><p>\u201cYes or no, Mr. Potter. It\u2019s a simple enough question.\u201d</p><p>He tries not to cringe. There was something with the way that Poppy has said his name that had Harry feeling as though he is still a student, with no business getting injured or sick or getting partly transfigured into a squid.</p><p>He clears his throat. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Poppy narrows her eyes at him, as if she can see through the lie that has just slipped through Harry\u2019s mouth.</p><p>Because there is one thing that aggravates his loss of control.</p><p>Harry has spent nights trying to figure out why some of his spells were regressing to botched up, first year attempts; why all of a sudden his magic was trying to make him spontaneously combust with embarrassment at fucking up even the most basic spells. And the answer has come to him just this morning\u2014 when a certain blonde had been walking up to him as he was transfiguring a rock by the edge of the lake. Only, by the end of it all, the rock had remained a rock, and Harry&hellip; well.</p><p>There is one common factor in all the occurrences of wonky magic that has happened to him over the past few days, and he thinks that Poppy\u2019s question at this point is merely a formality. She has pieced it together as well, maybe even sooner than Harry has. Still, Harry does not care to admit to the assumption in her eyes when the common factor is sitting beside him, leg wrapped up in his jelly thi\u2014 er, tentacle.</p><p>Draco must be uncomfortable enough as it is. Even without the knowledge of him playing a part in Harry\u2019s spell mishaps.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Poppy says in a clipped tone, \u201cI shall transfigure you back to your proper pieces, Harry. But seeing as this is the fourth time this week, I insist that you stay until we work out just what is causing these bouts of&hellip; spell malfunction.\u201d</p><p>Harry knows that he would have to fight her tooth and nail when she uses that tone with him. So despite not being all that ecstatic about a night in the hospital wing, he gives her a weary nod of resignation.</p><p>He feels the shiver of magic running through his head and when he raises his hand to check, he breathes a sigh of relief when he feels that the unruly mess was indeed his own hair, and not a bundle of moving, squiggly things.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say it\u2019s much of an improvement,\u201d Draco mutters beside him, \u201cBut it\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>When he looks at Draco, of course the bloody git is smiling at him, eyes sparkling with something that makes his stomach lurch. And after all this time, he\u2019s still surprised at how warm and open those grey eyes can be\u2014 having only been used to cold, hard glares back in the day.</p><p>Harry cannot help but quirk a smile. \u201cI\u2019m glad you approve.\u201d</p><p>The expression on Draco\u2019s face is so open and inviting that it\u2019s so bloody hard not to just give in to this constant urge to stare at it openly. Harry always has to convince himself that Draco doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing to Harry\u2019s insides, but sometimes it\u2019s so difficult to believe that Draco doesn\u2019t do it on purpose.

Harry follows his gaze and\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Harry feels the heat rush to his cheeks as he quickly disentangles his re-transfigured leg from Draco\u2019s. He didn\u2019t even feel Poppy transfiguring one leg back to normal, \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t\u2014 I wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Harry.\u201d</p><p>Harry thinks he really could do without the very apparent blush on his cheeks, but the sound of his given name rolling off Draco\u2019s tongue stillmakes him feel quite giddy even after three years, and it doesn\u2019t really help his situation any.</p><p>\u201cI mean, if you wanted me to stay so badly all you had to do was ask.\u201d</p><p>It is such a disorienting thing, Harry thinks\u2014 being in the company of someone who makes him hopelessly enamoured one moment, yet irritated as fuck the next. Or both. At the same time. Like what the arse is doing now.</p><p>\u201cGit,\u201d Harry snorts, focusing his attention back to Madame Pomfrey\u2019s fussing about.</p><p>\u201cReally, it\u2019s not your fault that you find my leg, well, any part of me really, irresistible,\u201d Draco smirks with a quick shrug of his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cRemind me again why I don\u2019t hate you anymore?\u201d Harry mutters. He wonders if Draco notices how he doesn\u2019t really refute his statement.</p><p>Draco\u2019s voice is so quiet, Harry\u2019s certain he would not be able to hear it was he not sitting so close. \u201cYou never hated me in the first place.\u201d</p><p>Harry looks at him in surprise. In his mind\u2019s eye he is transported back, and sees a door materializing on the side of an otherwise empty corridor. He remembers mutters of curses and hexes and apologies. He remembers the first shadows of genuine smiles. He remembers outstretched hands, and the sound of that simple sentence on two different tongues:</p><p><i>\u2018I never hated you\u2019.</i></p><p>And with one look at that intense expression on his face, Harry knows that Draco is remembering that same night, three years ago.</p><p>Draco\u2019s leg brushes against Harry\u2019s, and Harry suddenly finds that his is frozen in place.</p><p>\u201cThere we are, Harry. All back to normal,\u201d Poppy&rsquo;s voice is an unwelcome intrusion to the little bubble Harry suddenly finds himself in.</p><p>Harry bites down the urge to inform her that <i>no</i>, he is most definitely not <i>back to normal</i>, and he doesn\u2019t think he will be any time soon. Not with this Draco-<i>sodding</i>-Malfoy-induced-turmoil warring with his good sense. If there is any good sense left in him at all, actually.</p><p>Harry suspects there isn\u2019t much.</p><p>\u201cGet some rest. I\u2019ll check on you later,\u201d he hears Poppy say, and the implied warning to <i>stay put</i> is clear in the way that she gives him a lingering look before she turns away and leaves them to their own devices.</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>Harry looks back at Draco, and forces him to meet his gaze\u2014 which is entirely too close that Harry tenses instinctively just to avoid backing off even slightly. Sometimes he thinks that the git is really hell bent on torturing him just for the heck of it. And he doesn\u2019t even know that he\u2019s doing it.</p><p>\u201cAm I what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack to normal,\u201d Draco mutters.</p><p><i>Close</i>. Harry blinks. Draco\u2019s so close, Harry can count each eyelash, can see how the grey in his eyes are mixed with specks of blue.

Harry&rsquo;s eyes widen and his heart beats wildly against his chest. Harry doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening (not really, he thinks he does) but it feels like someone\u2019s just cast a tripping jinx on him and he doesn\u2019t know which is right-side up any longer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Harry\u2019s hands are trembling, his body is warming up like a gush of fiendfyre has just set it alight.

He does not even bother to be worked-up about the all too familiar jibe about his forehead. He doesn\u2019t even think that it counts as an insult anymore, on both ends.</p><p>\u201cAnd that makes it so much better, does it?\u201d the elegant drawl is tinged with exasperation, and Harry doesn\u2019t know whether to make good use of the wiggling things on his head and strangle the git, or to slump against the arm that was keeping him standing. \u201cYou should have listened to Minerva.\u201d</p><p>Or maybe it was all Draco\u2019s fault in the first place.</p><p>Harry could have accepted the invitation from Minerva, and Draco, instead of accepting his own invitation and coming back to Hogwarts two days after Harry arrived, should have just stayed at home with his son and stretched out the remainder of their time together before the term starts.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as it looks, Draco,\u201d Harry sighs.</p><p>\u201cYou have things growing out of your head that are worse than your hair, which is quite a remarkable feat even for you,\u201d he says, in an afterthought, \u201cAnd your legs are useless, slimy, lumps of jelly.\u201d</p><p>Harry tries not to roll his eyes and quip some remark about Draco\u2019s ability of stating the obvious and unnecessary.</p><p>\u201cTentacles,\u201d Harry says as one, grey tentacle wraps itself around Draco\u2019s leg, almost making the both of them fall over.</p><p>\u201cYes, those,\u201d Draco mutters, trying to shake off the one tentacle that was still looping itself around his leg. He raises a pale eyebrow, \u201cYou needn\u2019t have gone through all this trouble just to grope me, you know.\u201d</p><p>Harry tries not to sound too indignant. \u201cI\u2019m not doing it on purpose, you git.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. They are <i>your </i>limbs,\u201d he says with a roll of his eyes.</p><p>But then he looks at Harry and though his tone is all wry amusement and maybe disgust at the little, squiggly bundles on Harry\u2019s head that makes him look like the evil sea witch, Harry thinks that he sees a flash of concern as grey eyes take him in from head to toe.</p><p>They wobble around a corner, and with Draco\u2019s attention otherwise occupied, Harry\u2019s other tentacle almost topples over the suit of armour. \u00a0Draco releases a drawn out sigh. He resumes their trek to the hospital wing, albeit not as steady as before. It appears that for the moment, he has given up trying to dislodge the stubborn thing on his leg.</p><p>Harry eyes his companion. He notes the faint crease on his forehead, and the way his lips are set in a thin line. Harry sighs, practically hearing the admonishing tone seep through that disapproving expression. \u201cJust spit it out, Draco.\u201d</p><p>Draco narrows his eyes but says nothing. He merely tightens his hold around Harry\u2019s waist and then proceeds to half-dragging him through the open doors of the hospital wing.</p><p>To Poppy\u2019s credit, her eyes widen only a fraction of a second before she descends on Harry with that all too familiar stern look on her face. \u201cThree days. Why am I not surprised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI actually gave him two days. He did pretty well, considering,\u201d Draco quips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here, you know,\u201d Harry frowns.</p><p>\u201cYes, very hard to forget what with your jelly thing still attached to my leg, Potter.\u201d</p><p>Harry does not even bother to correct him anymore. And it isn\u2019t as if he wants to have his tentacle all wrapped around Draco\u2019s leg. Well. Not entirely. But he would have removed it by now if he had any idea how.</p><p>\u201cSet him down on the bed, then, Draco.\u201d</p><p>Draco sits him down gingerly atop the hospital bed, and the both of them let out a relieved breath. Harry feels parts embarrassed and parts guilty about the fact that Draco had to half-drag, half-carry him to the Hospital Wing\u2014 he wasn\u2019t exactly feather-light, despite being on the lean, almost thin side\u2014 but he thinks about the disappointment shooting through his veins about how he has to stay on the bed, without Draco\u2019s warm, steady arm around him, now that they were here, and the guilt almost overwhelms whatever embarrassment Harry thinks he should be feeling right about now.</p><p>Of course, thinking about their trip to the Infirmary only triggered Harry\u2019s thoughts to wander down dangerous paths. He could still feel the ghost of Draco\u2019s warm hand on his waist, and the lean arm against his back, and he could still smell the scent of cinnamon and coffee that clung to his side, that was so distinctly <i>Draco</i> that Harry swore he could\u2014</p><p>\u201cHave you noticed anything that sets it off? Anything that aggravates the condition?\u201d</p><p>Harry blinks and tries to refocus. He shrugs.</p><p>\u201cYes or no, Mr. Potter. It\u2019s a simple enough question.\u201d</p><p>He tries not to cringe. There was something with the way that Poppy has said his name that had Harry feeling as though he is still a student, with no business getting injured or sick or getting partly transfigured into a squid.</p><p>He clears his throat. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Poppy narrows her eyes at him, as if she can see through the lie that has just slipped through Harry\u2019s mouth.</p><p>Because there is one thing that aggravates his loss of control.</p><p>Harry has spent nights trying to figure out why some of his spells were regressing to botched up, first year attempts; why all of a sudden his magic was trying to make him spontaneously combust with embarrassment at fucking up even the most basic spells. And the answer has come to him just this morning\u2014 when a certain blonde had been walking up to him as he was transfiguring a rock by the edge of the lake. Only, by the end of it all, the rock had remained a rock, and Harry\u2026 well.</p><p>There is one common factor in all the occurrences of wonky magic that has happened to him over the past few days, and he thinks that Poppy\u2019s question at this point is merely a formality. She has pieced it together as well, maybe even sooner than Harry has. Still, Harry does not care to admit to the assumption in her eyes when the common factor is sitting beside him, leg wrapped up in his jelly thi\u2014 er, tentacle.</p><p>Draco must be uncomfortable enough as it is. Even without the knowledge of him playing a part in Harry\u2019s spell mishaps.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Poppy says in a clipped tone, \u201cI shall transfigure you back to your proper pieces, Harry. But seeing as this is the fourth time this week, I insist that you stay until we work out just what is causing these bouts of\u2026 spell malfunction.\u201d</p><p>Harry knows that he would have to fight her tooth and nail when she uses that tone with him. So despite not being all that ecstatic about a night in the hospital wing, he gives her a weary nod of resignation.</p><p>He feels the shiver of magic running through his head and when he raises his hand to check, he breathes a sigh of relief when he feels that the unruly mess was indeed his own hair, and not a bundle of moving, squiggly things.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say it\u2019s much of an improvement,\u201d Draco mutters beside him, \u201cBut it\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>When he looks at Draco, of course the bloody git is smiling at him, eyes sparkling with something that makes his stomach lurch. And after all this time, he\u2019s still surprised at how warm and open those grey eyes can be\u2014 having only been used to cold, hard glares back in the day.</p><p>Harry cannot help but quirk a smile. \u201cI\u2019m glad you approve.\u201d</p><p>The expression on Draco\u2019s face is so open and inviting that it\u2019s so bloody hard not to just give in to this constant urge to stare at it openly. Harry always has to convince himself that Draco doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing to Harry\u2019s insides, but sometimes it\u2019s so difficult to believe that Draco doesn\u2019t do it on purpose. Bloody prick.</p><p>\u201cStill not doing it on purpose, Potter?\u201d</p><p>Harry blinks at him, reigning down his panic, suddenly wondering if Draco is using <i>Legilimens</i> on him.</p><p>Draco raises a pale eyebrow and looks down at something between them. Harry follows his gaze and\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Harry feels the heat rush to his cheeks as he quickly disentangles his re-transfigured leg from Draco\u2019s. He didn\u2019t even feel Poppy transfiguring one leg back to normal, \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t\u2014 I wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Harry.\u201d</p><p>Harry thinks he really could do without the very apparent blush on his cheeks, but the sound of his given name rolling off Draco\u2019s tongue stillmakes him feel quite giddy even after three years, and it doesn\u2019t really help his situation any.</p><p>\u201cI mean, if you wanted me to stay so badly all you had to do was ask.\u201d</p><p>It is such a disorienting thing, Harry thinks\u2014 being in the company of someone who makes him hopelessly enamoured one moment, yet irritated as fuck the next.

He doesn\u2019t even think that it counts as an insult anymore, on both ends.</p><p>\u201cAnd that makes it so much better, does it?\u201d the elegant drawl is tinged with exasperation, and Harry doesn\u2019t know whether to make good use of the wiggling things on his head and strangle the git, or to slump against the arm that was keeping him standing. \u201cYou should have listened to Minerva.\u201d</p><p>Or maybe it was all Draco\u2019s fault in the first place.</p><p>Harry could have accepted the invitation from Minerva, and Draco, instead of accepting his own invitation and coming back to Hogwarts two days after Harry arrived, should have just stayed at home with his son and stretched out the remainder of their time together before the term starts.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as it looks, Draco,\u201d Harry sighs.</p><p>\u201cYou have things growing out of your head that are worse than your hair, which is quite a remarkable feat even for you,\u201d he says, in an afterthought, \u201cAnd your legs are useless, slimy, lumps of jelly.\u201d</p><p>Harry tries not to roll his eyes and quip some remark about Draco\u2019s ability of stating the obvious and unnecessary.</p><p>\u201cTentacles,\u201d Harry says as one, grey tentacle wraps itself around Draco\u2019s leg, almost making the both of them fall over.</p><p>\u201cYes, those,\u201d Draco mutters, trying to shake off the one tentacle that was still looping itself around his leg. He raises a pale eyebrow, \u201cYou needn\u2019t have gone through all this trouble just to grope me, you know.\u201d</p><p>Harry tries not to sound too indignant. \u201cI\u2019m not doing it on purpose, you git.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. They are <i>your </i>limbs,\u201d he says with a roll of his eyes.</p><p>But then he looks at Harry and though his tone is all wry amusement and maybe disgust at the little, squiggly bundles on Harry\u2019s head that makes him look like the evil sea witch, Harry thinks that he sees a flash of concern as grey eyes take him in from head to toe.</p><p>They wobble around a corner, and with Draco\u2019s attention otherwise occupied, Harry\u2019s other tentacle almost topples over the suit of armour. \u00a0Draco releases a drawn out sigh. He resumes their trek to the hospital wing, albeit not as steady as before. It appears that for the moment, he has given up trying to dislodge the stubborn thing on his leg.</p><p>Harry eyes his companion. He notes the faint crease on his forehead, and the way his lips are set in a thin line. Harry sighs, practically hearing the admonishing tone seep through that disapproving expression. \u201cJust spit it out, Draco.\u201d</p><p>Draco narrows his eyes but says nothing. He merely tightens his hold around Harry\u2019s waist and then proceeds to half-dragging him through the open doors of the hospital wing.</p><p>To Poppy\u2019s credit, her eyes widen only a fraction of a second before she descends on Harry with that all too familiar stern look on her face. \u201cThree days. Why am I not surprised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI actually gave him two days. He did pretty well, considering,\u201d Draco quips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here, you know,\u201d Harry frowns.</p><p>\u201cYes, very hard to forget what with your jelly thing still attached to my leg, Potter.\u201d</p><p>Harry does not even bother to correct him anymore. And it isn\u2019t as if he wants to have his tentacle all wrapped around Draco\u2019s leg. Well. Not entirely. But he would have removed it by now if he had any idea how.</p><p>\u201cSet him down on the bed, then, Draco.\u201d</p><p>Draco sits him down gingerly atop the hospital bed, and the both of them let out a relieved breath. Harry feels parts embarrassed and parts guilty about the fact that Draco had to half-drag, half-carry him to the Hospital Wing\u2014 he wasn\u2019t exactly feather-light, despite being on the lean, almost thin side\u2014 but he thinks about the disappointment shooting through his veins about how he has to stay on the bed, without Draco\u2019s warm, steady arm around him, now that they were here, and the guilt almost overwhelms whatever embarrassment Harry thinks he should be feeling right about now.</p><p>Of course, thinking about their trip to the Infirmary only triggered Harry\u2019s thoughts to wander down dangerous paths. He could still feel the ghost of Draco\u2019s warm hand on his waist, and the lean arm against his back, and he could still smell the scent of cinnamon and coffee that clung to his side, that was so distinctly <i>Draco</i> that Harry swore he could\u2014</p><p>\u201cHave you noticed anything that sets it off? Anything that aggravates the condition?\u201d</p><p>Harry blinks and tries to refocus. He shrugs.</p><p>\u201cYes or no, Mr. Potter. It\u2019s a simple enough question.\u201d</p><p>He tries not to cringe. There was something with the way that Poppy has said his name that had Harry feeling as though he is still a student, with no business getting injured or sick or getting partly transfigured into a squid.</p><p>He clears his throat. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Poppy narrows her eyes at him, as if she can see through the lie that has just slipped through Harry\u2019s mouth.</p><p>Because there is one thing that aggravates his loss of control.</p><p>Harry has spent nights trying to figure out why some of his spells were regressing to botched up, first year attempts; why all of a sudden his magic was trying to make him spontaneously combust with embarrassment at fucking up even the most basic spells. And the answer has come to him just this morning\u2014 when a certain blonde had been walking up to him as he was transfiguring a rock by the edge of the lake. Only, by the end of it all, the rock had remained a rock, and Harry\u2026 well.</p><p>There is one common factor in all the occurrences of wonky magic that has happened to him over the past few days, and he thinks that Poppy\u2019s question at this point is merely a formality. She has pieced it together as well, maybe even sooner than Harry has. Still, Harry does not care to admit to the assumption in her eyes when the common factor is sitting beside him, leg wrapped up in his jelly thi\u2014 er, tentacle.</p><p>Draco must be uncomfortable enough as it is. Even without the knowledge of him playing a part in Harry\u2019s spell mishaps.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Poppy says in a clipped tone, \u201cI shall transfigure you back to your proper pieces, Harry. But seeing as this is the fourth time this week, I insist that you stay until we work out just what is causing these bouts of\u2026 spell malfunction.\u201d</p><p>Harry knows that he would have to fight her tooth and nail when she uses that tone with him. So despite not being all that ecstatic about a night in the hospital wing, he gives her a weary nod of resignation.</p><p>He feels the shiver of magic running through his head and when he raises his hand to check, he breathes a sigh of relief when he feels that the unruly mess was indeed his own hair, and not a bundle of moving, squiggly things.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say it\u2019s much of an improvement,\u201d Draco mutters beside him, \u201cBut it\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>When he looks at Draco, of course the bloody git is smiling at him, eyes sparkling with something that makes his stomach lurch. And after all this time, he\u2019s still surprised at how warm and open those grey eyes can be\u2014 having only been used to cold, hard glares back in the day.</p><p>Harry cannot help but quirk a smile. \u201cI\u2019m glad you approve.\u201d</p><p>The expression on Draco\u2019s face is so open and inviting that it\u2019s so bloody hard not to just give in to this constant urge to stare at it openly. Harry always has to convince himself that Draco doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing to Harry\u2019s insides, but sometimes it\u2019s so difficult to believe that Draco doesn\u2019t do it on purpose. Bloody prick.</p><p>\u201cStill not doing it on purpose, Potter?\u201d</p><p>Harry blinks at him, reigning down his panic, suddenly wondering if Draco is using <i>Legilimens</i> on him.</p><p>Draco raises a pale eyebrow and looks down at something between them. Harry follows his gaze and\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Harry feels the heat rush to his cheeks as he quickly disentangles his re-transfigured leg from Draco\u2019s. He didn\u2019t even feel Poppy transfiguring one leg back to normal, \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t\u2014 I wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Harry.\u201d</p><p>Harry thinks he really could do without the very apparent blush on his cheeks, but the sound of his given name rolling off Draco\u2019s tongue stillmakes him feel quite giddy even after three years, and it doesn\u2019t really help his situation any.</p><p>\u201cI mean, if you wanted me to stay so badly all you had to do was ask.\u201d</p><p>It is such a disorienting thing, Harry thinks\u2014 being in the company of someone who makes him hopelessly enamoured one moment, yet irritated as fuck the next. Or both. At the same time. Like what the arse is doing now.</p><p>\u201cGit,\u201d Harry snorts, focusing his attention back to Madame Pomfrey\u2019s fussing about.</p><p>\u201cReally, it\u2019s not your fault that you find my leg, well, any part of me really, irresistible,\u201d Draco smirks with a quick shrug of his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cRemind me again why I don\u2019t hate you anymore?\u201d Harry mutters. He wonders if Draco notices how he doesn\u2019t really refute his statement.</p><p>Draco\u2019s voice is so quiet, Harry\u2019s certain he would not be able to hear it was he not sitting so close. \u201cYou never hated me in the first place.\u201d</p><p>Harry looks at him in surprise. In his mind\u2019s eye he is transported back, and sees a door materializing on the side of an otherwise empty corridor. He remembers mutters of curses and hexes and apologies. He remembers the first shadows of genuine smiles. He remembers outstretched hands, and the sound of that simple sentence on two different tongues:</p><p><i>\u2018I never hated you\u2019.</i></p><p>And with one look at that intense expression on his face, Harry knows that Draco is remembering that same night, three years ago.</p><p>Draco\u2019s leg brushes against Harry\u2019s, and Harry suddenly finds that his is frozen in place.</p><p>\u201cThere we are, Harry. All back to normal,\u201d Poppy\u2019s voice is an unwelcome intrusion to the little bubble Harry suddenly finds himself in.</p><p>Harry bites down the urge to inform her that <i>no</i>, he is most definitely not <i>back to normal</i>, and he doesn\u2019t think he will be any time soon. Not with this Draco-<i>sodding</i>-Malfoy-induced-turmoil warring with his good sense. If there is any good sense left in him at all, actually.</p><p>Harry suspects there isn\u2019t much.</p><p>\u201cGet some rest. I\u2019ll check on you later,\u201d he hears Poppy say, and the implied warning to <i>stay put</i> is clear in the way that she gives him a lingering look before she turns away and leaves them to their own devices.</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>Harry looks back at Draco, and forces him to meet his gaze\u2014 which is entirely too close that Harry tenses instinctively just to avoid backing off even slightly. Sometimes he thinks that the git is really hell bent on torturing him just for the heck of it. And he doesn\u2019t even know that he\u2019s doing it.</p><p>\u201cAm I what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack to normal,\u201d Draco mutters.</p><p><i>Close</i>. Harry blinks. Draco\u2019s so close, Harry can count each eyelash, can see how the grey in his eyes are mixed with specks of blue. Harry has to remind himself how to speak. \u201cFor now, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust now?\u201d</p><p><i>Closer</i>. Draco\u2019s breath fans over his lips. A warm hand ghosts over his own. Harry\u2019s eyes widen and his heart beats wildly against his chest. Harry doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening (not really, he thinks he does) but it feels like someone\u2019s just cast a tripping jinx on him and he doesn\u2019t know which is right-side up any longer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Harry\u2019s hands are trembling, his body is warming up like a gush of fiendfyre has just set it alight.

A warm forehead against his.</p><p><i>Too close</i>.</p><p>\u201cWill you ask me to stay?\u201d</p><p><i>Oh</i>.</p><p>Harry breathes against the light pressure on his lips. \"Yes.\u201d</p><p>Draco pushes forward.
