The game was released worldwide on July 13, 2018. In under a month, the game had sold over a million copies, making it one of the best-selling games on the platform.</p>\n\n<p>Octopath Traveler features an aesthetic termed &ldquo;HD-2D&rdquo; by the developers.</p>\n\n<p>Octopath Traveler is a role-playing game that sports a graphical aesthetic known as &ldquo;HD-2D&rdquo;, defined by the developers as combining retro Super NES-style character sprites and textures with polygonal environments and high-definition effects. The game puts players in the role of one of eight adventurers, each of whom begins their journey in different ways. Each character comes from different parts of the world, each of which determines their job or attribute. Each character has a unique Path Ability command that can be used when interacting with NPCs that are divided into two categories: Noble, the ability&rsquo;s effectiveness dependent by the character&rsquo;s level or amount of in-game currency, and Rogue, which has a risk of its user losing credibility upon other NPCs. For example, Olberic and H'aanit can challenge characters, Cyrus and Alfyn can inquire about certain bits of information, Tressa and Therion can acquire items, and Ophilia and Primrose can guide NPCs and use them as guest summons.</p>\n\n<p>The game features turn-based battles, in which the player can attack using different kinds of weapons or elemental attacks, as well as use abilities and items. Playable characters receive a Boost Point at the end of every turn, of which they can store up to five at a time. During their turn, a player can use up to three Boost Points to boost a command, allowing their character to attack multiple times, raise their defense, or increase the potency of an ability. Enemies have a shield counter that lowers whenever they are attacked with a weapon or element they are weak against. When the counter is depleted, they enter a stunned state where they can receive more damage and lose a turn.<br/>\nPlot</p>\n\n<p>Set in the land of Orsterra, the Order of the Sacred Flame believed their world was created by thirteen deities before twelve were forced to seal the fallen god Galdera, who refused to relinquish what they created, within the afterworld that can be accessed through the sealed Gate of Finis. This is a story of eight different protagonists each with their own quest, one being the cleric Ophilia Clement from the Order of the Sacred Flame who embarks on a pilgrimage to renew the flames of the church, unaware that her faith&rsquo;s benefactor Mattias established a cult dedicated to Galdera. The scholar Cyrus Albright seeks an ancient Hornbergian grimoire known as From the Far Reaches of Hell, whose theft was arranged by the current headmaster&rsquo;s aide Lucia. The merchant Tressa Colzione is spurred by the journal of the apothecary Graham Crossford to see the world while contending with the Obsidian bandit Esmeralda. Olberic Eisenberg, a knight from the fallen kingdom of Hornburg, seeks the truth of his homeland&rsquo;s destruction by the mercanary Werner. The dancer Primrose Azelhart, a woman of noble birth who witnessed her father&rsquo;s murder by three crow-tattooed men who make up Osidian&rsquo;s leadership, demeans herself to extract her revenge even after learning the Osidians&rsquo; leader is her childhood love Simeon. An apothecary named Alfyn Greengrass, who was cured during a plague as a child by Graham, seeks to follow in the man&rsquo;s footsteps to help others. The thief Therion is forced into the servitude of house Ravus to retrieve the stolen dragonstones and settles things with his former friend Darius while the hunter H'aanit sets out to find her master and to finish his task of slaying a nightmarish monster called Redeye.</p>\n\n<p>After progressing though all the characters various stories, the heroes&rsquo; quests become intermingled as Mattias, Lucia, the Osidians, and Werner were all under the employ of the immortal witch Lyblac who is seeking a certain man.

David Pottinger, CEO of Stranger Things 3 developer BonusXP, said part of that positive experience is that \u201cthey make it easy to get on the platform,\u201d and the innate perks of the Switch, like mobility and easy couch co-op, continue to draw more third-party devs toward the Switch even if may not have as much raw power as other consoles.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As the Switch eShop grows, Nintendo has miraculously managed to maintain an associated level of quality that comes with being marked a \u201cNindie\u201d \u2013 a label both Pottinger and Rostal likened to Nintendo\u2019s old \u201cSeal of Quality.\u201d Lee explained that \u201cpeople will enter [the eShop] and know that whatever is available there has been filtered and curated,\u201d also pointing out that, for other platforms, \u201cwhen there isn\u2019t that filter discoverability becomes a huge problem.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That\u2019s a sentiment shared by Rostal and Moldenhauer too, and one that seems hyper-relevant at a time where Steam went in the opposite direction with less curation and has been met with scandals and usability issues as a result. Pottinger\u2019s explanation for why Nintendo hasn\u2019t suffered the same fate despite the tidal wave of games coming to Switch is fairly simple: \u201cOne of the ways Nintendo maintains quality when you look at the games they\u2019re bringing to Switch and you look at the games they\u2019re promoting is honest-to-goodness effort.</p>\n<div class=\"quoteBox\">\n<p>\u201cNintendo is the type of company that believes in indie games.\u201d \u2013 Jared Moldenhauer, StudioMDHR</p>\n</div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cIt just takes effort\u201d Pottinger reiterated. \u201cYou can\u2019t get good curation without that.\u201d Scott tells me that the Nindie team at Nintendo will \u201dactively seek out great content and great developers\u201d constantly, and that finding the right stuff to elevate in a Nintendo Direct is a matter of both good timing and \u201ca lot of hard work from our team.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Rostal said she believes that Scott and his team members \u201cgenuinely love\u201d to find and elevate games that might otherwise be overlooked, and that she thinks \u201cthey take as much pride finding the diamond in the rough as they do any more company-wide announcement.\u201d And while past systems like the Xbox 360 or PS Vita have certainly offered indies a large amount of support in the past, both she and Moldenhauer seem to think Nintendo\u2019s passion is different this time.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYou need to have faith in a company that actually looks for and finds a way to get the most interesting games out there and get them in player\u2019s hands,\u201d Moldenhauer said, continuing by emphasizing that \u201cNintendo is the type of company that believes in indie games.\u201d Rostal said that the \u201cindie enthusiasm around the Switch is something that we\u2019ve all rallied behind as an industry,\u201d as well.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Moldenhauer said that the Switch being both a mobile device and a console means gamers don\u2019t have to choose, which gives a \u201cbetter opportunity for small developers to have their games played more and more often.\u201d The hybrid nature of the Switch was mentioned to me by a lot of devs, and it\u2019s not hard to see the delight that explodes online any time a traditionally console-based series like Wolfenstein or Mortal Kombat suddenly becomes playable on the go, making it a system as appealing to developers as it is players.</p>\n<div class=\"quoteBox\">\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a bucket list item to have your game come out on a Nintendo device.\u201d \u2013 David Pottinger, BonusXP</p>\n</div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But it\u2019s not just hardware and Nintendo\u2019s dev support that is making the Switch one of the best places for new games, it\u2019s also the nostalgia of Nintendo at work.

David Pottinger, CEO of Stranger Things 3 developer BonusXP, said part of that positive experience is that \u201cthey make it easy to get on the platform,\u201d and the innate perks of the Switch, like mobility and easy couch co-op, continue to draw more third-party devs toward the Switch even if may not have as much raw power as other consoles.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As the Switch eShop grows, Nintendo has miraculously managed to maintain an associated level of quality that comes with being marked a \u201cNindie\u201d \u2013 a label both Pottinger and Rostal likened to Nintendo\u2019s old \u201cSeal of Quality.\u201d Lee explained that \u201cpeople will enter [the eShop] and know that whatever is available there has been filtered and curated,\u201d also pointing out that, for other platforms, \u201cwhen there isn\u2019t that filter discoverability becomes a huge problem.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That\u2019s a sentiment shared by Rostal and Moldenhauer too, and one that seems hyper-relevant at a time where Steam went in the opposite direction with less curation and has been met with scandals and usability issues as a result. Pottinger\u2019s explanation for why Nintendo hasn\u2019t suffered the same fate despite the tidal wave of games coming to Switch is fairly simple: \u201cOne of the ways Nintendo maintains quality when you look at the games they\u2019re bringing to Switch and you look at the games they\u2019re promoting is honest-to-goodness effort.</p>\n<div class=\"quoteBox\">\n<p>\u201cNintendo is the type of company that believes in indie games.\u201d \u2013 Jared Moldenhauer, StudioMDHR</p>\n</div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cIt just takes effort\u201d Pottinger reiterated. \u201cYou can\u2019t get good curation without that.\u201d Scott tells me that the Nindie team at Nintendo will \u201dactively seek out great content and great developers\u201d constantly, and that finding the right stuff to elevate in a Nintendo Direct is a matter of both good timing and \u201ca lot of hard work from our team.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Rostal said she believes that Scott and his team members \u201cgenuinely love\u201d to find and elevate games that might otherwise be overlooked, and that she thinks \u201cthey take as much pride finding the diamond in the rough as they do any more company-wide announcement.\u201d And while past systems like the Xbox 360 or PS Vita have certainly offered indies a large amount of support in the past, both she and Moldenhauer seem to think Nintendo\u2019s passion is different this time.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYou need to have faith in a company that actually looks for and finds a way to get the most interesting games out there and get them in player\u2019s hands,\u201d Moldenhauer said, continuing by emphasizing that \u201cNintendo is the type of company that believes in indie games.\u201d Rostal said that the \u201cindie enthusiasm around the Switch is something that we\u2019ve all rallied behind as an industry,\u201d as well.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Moldenhauer said that the Switch being both a mobile device and a console means gamers don\u2019t have to choose, which gives a \u201cbetter opportunity for small developers to have their games played more and more often.\u201d The hybrid nature of the Switch was mentioned to me by a lot of devs, and it\u2019s not hard to see the delight that explodes online any time a traditionally console-based series like Wolfenstein or Mortal Kombat suddenly becomes playable on the go, making it a system as appealing to developers as it is players.</p>\n<div class=\"quoteBox\">\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a bucket list item to have your game come out on a Nintendo device.\u201d \u2013 David Pottinger, BonusXP</p>\n</div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But it\u2019s not just hardware and Nintendo\u2019s dev support that is making the Switch one of the best places for new games, it\u2019s also the nostalgia of Nintendo at work. Every single dev I spoke to mentioned this sort of intangible excitement around having their game on a Nintendo system. Scott said that doing things like putting Hollow Knight in their E3 Direct last year \u201cgives the two-man teams hope,\u201d and that hope clearly touches on the deeper idea of those two-man teams having Nintendo vouch for them.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pottinger said that hearing their game would be a Nindie was one of the best moments he\u2019s had with his team. Not only for the seal of approval it represented, but also because \u201cit\u2019s definitely a bucket list item to have your game come out on a Nintendo device.\u201d Likewise, Stosal said finding out \u201cyou\u2019re going to be a Nindie is kind of incredible.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Moldenhauer had the same excitement. \u201cSomething like this is what you dream of,\u201d he explained. \u201cEverything as a kid, knowing the old video game gods of Sega and Nintendo, that you finally got to be on the one that\u2019s still alive, there\u2019s nothing quite like that experience.\u201d Many of the indie devs now were the gamers playing Nintendo systems before PlayStation or Xbox even existed, and that magical nostalgic feeling persists decades later.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Rostal specifically said that \u201ca lot of us grew up playing these games on Nintendo, and it\u2019s always been a dream of us to be a part of that.\u201d She continued by saying that \u201cthere is that feeling like \u2018I want to have my game there because my childhood was there and they\u2019re continuing to build this for new childhoods.\u2019\u201d Getting the Nindie stamp isn\u2019t just marketing power and dev support from Nintendo, its further proof that, as Scott said, there\u2019s hope for even the smallest teams.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Scott told me that the Switch simply \u201ccreates an avenue for indie developers to launch their games,\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s up to the indie developer to decide how that changes the industry.\u201d To his point, little of what Nintendo is doing here is fundamentally new or revelatory within the industry. But the developers we spoke to made it clear that even if it\u2019s up to them to make great new games, the veracity and passion Nintendo has for elevating indie games on Switch is making waves just the same.</p>\n<p><em>Tom Marks is IGN\u2019s Deputy Reviews Editor and resident pie maker, and he is ready for everything on Switch.
