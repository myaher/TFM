The room is uncomfortably warm (Dan remembers Phil feeling slightly chilly the night before, and his own panicked overreaction that made him turn on the heat higher than they usually would, instead of just getting another blanket, despite Phil\u2019s protests).</p><p>In his half asleep state, Dan notices that the light coming in from the window is faint, keeping the quiet room dim, almost dark, but as that doesn\u2019t really mean anything at this time of year he picks up his phone from the nightstand and checks the time, squinting against the sudden bright light. 8:30 AM, he reads. Too early to wake up when they haven\u2019t set an alarm to force them out of bed, he thinks. And definitely too early for Phil to be awake and functioning when he\u2019s on bed rest (doctor\u2019s orders, of course, but it\u2019s not like Phil is one to pass on an opportunity to stay in bed and get babied when he\u2019s under the weather, even without an open invitation).</p><p>Dan\u2019s uncomfortable sick feeling intensifies for a moment, making him close his eyes and take a deep breath to calm himself down. His mind is showing him horrible pictures from yesterday morning. Pictures of a pale, weak looking Phil lying on the floor and calling for him with a panicked voice. The pictures are, truthfully, a lot more dramatic than the reality actually was at that moment, but he\u2019s allowed, he thinks, to be a little dramatic about this. No one, he reasons with himself, can really blame him for that, he\u2019s sure.</p><p>He can feel his body relaxes a bit when he starts hearing the sounds of running water, meaning that Phil is most definitely taking a shower. (He tries to push back the instant, new images that make their way to his mind. Images of the same pale, weak looking Phil, only this time he has a stream of water covering his body while he lies still on the shower floor).</p><p>He pushes himself up from bed all at once at that, a bit too fast, making himself dizzy for a second but not wasting time to compose himself, making his way to the bathroom where he hears the water coming from.</p><p>He\u2019s fine, he tells himself. He\u2019s okay.</p><p>Good enough to get up and go upstairs and start the shower, he keeps reassuring his mind. In addition, before they went to bed, Dan made him swear to wake him up if he feels so much as an uncomfortable tingle on the tip of his nose, so he knows, for sure, that at least for now, Phil is okay.</p><p>That doesn\u2019t stop the overwhelming wave of relief from washing through his body when he hears Phil\u2019s voice say, \u201cyes?\u201d after Dan knocks on the door, probably a little too urgently for 8 am.<br/>Dan is only in his boxers, so it doesn\u2019t take him long to get in the room and chuck them off to the side, getting into the shower and under the stream of warm water.</p><p>Phil welcomes him silently, by turning his back to his front and leaning into him, pressing his head back into Dan\u2019s shoulder and letting out a sigh.</p><p>After 9 years, Dan likes to think that he\u2019s pretty fluent in Phil language. He takes pride in it and gets a strong, possessive kind of satisfaction in knowing that no one can understand that language quite as well as him. He even brags about it from time to time, when he has a glass too many of a nice wine at the Lester house, encouraged by a teasing Martyn and laughed at fondly by the Lester parents, usually while being shushed by a pink looking Phil.</p><p>And this, as far as reading Phil goes, is as easy as it gets. It screams \u2018hold me tight and don\u2019t let me go until we can\u2019t possibly stand under this stream of water anymore,\u2019 and Dan has no intention to refuse.</p><p>He wraps his arms around Phil\u2019s waist, fingers skimming over a soft stomach, head resting on a bony shoulder (gently, careful not to put too much weight on Phil, who suddenly feels more delicate than usual in his arms).</p><p>Phil smells like nothing in particular right now. A little of his fruity soap, a little of Dan\u2019s shampoo, but no distinguish smell like he had the day before. No sanitizers and disinfectants and the nauseating, stale smell of a hospital room. He presses his nose to his wet shoulder and just breathes him in, feeling Phil\u2019s long fingers coming up to rest above his, squeezing his hand.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you get up so early?\u201d Dan asks, and he knows that his voice sounds a little accusing but he\u2019s still tired and he\u2019s still worried and saying \u201cplease don\u2019t ever go anywhere when I\u2019m not right there to follow you,\u201d seems a little too much as a response to a morning shower.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep anymore,\u201d Phil says. His eyes are closed and his mouth is slack and he looks just fine, but Dan\u2019s stomach still does a little unpleasant flip inside his body.</p><p>\u201cIs it your head again?\u201d Dan asks, and he tries to sound casual, because as much as he worries he knows how easily Phil\u2019s hypochondriac mind gets wound up by his reactions, always has. He learned to control himself, over the years. Sometimes, when Phil needs it, he can be the calm one, the grounding one. Sometimes, when Phil needs it, he can to be whatever Phil wants him to be.</p><p>Phil shakes his head against Dan\u2019s shoulder, and he turns his face a little to place a kiss on Dan\u2019s jaw, letting his lips linger. Phil hasn\u2019t shaved yet, so the kiss feels a little scratchy on Dan\u2019s skin. It\u2019s a simple gesture of affection, familiar sensation, but today it makes Dan hold him even tighter against himself. Makes his chest feel even tighter as well.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my dick,\u201d Phil says, and he moves Dan\u2019s hand down on his body, until he gets to Phil\u2019s semi hard on. He didn\u2019t even notice. \u201cHad another Chris Hemsworth dream, but this one was weird even for me,\u201d he turns around in Dan\u2019s arms, wrapping his own around his shoulders, gliding them down Dan\u2019s wet back and burying his head in the crook of Dan\u2019s neck. He kisses him there softly, starting to push his hips slowly against Dan\u2019s thigh. \u201cDidn\u2019t want to wake you so I thought I\u2019ll take care of it myself.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s still tired, and he\u2019s still poorly, Dan can tell. He\u2019s leaning most of his weight on Dan\u2019s body and his lips against his neck are barely there, lacking energy and enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cYou should have woke me up,\u201d Dan reprimands, but he does it softly, kissing the side of Phil\u2019s head right after so that Phil knows it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s fine, he just wants to be with him right now, he just doesn\u2019t want to let him out of his sight.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re here now,\u201d Phil says, and he speeds up his movements a little, pressing closer to Dan\u2019s body.</p><p>Dan\u2019s hands are griping Phil\u2019s sides harder, keeping him steady, keeping him from leaning away. Keeping him safe from falling down ever again. \u201cYes,\u201d he says, kissing Phil\u2019s head again, \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>****************************</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take a lot for Phil to agree to lie down on the couch while Dan makes them breakfast. As Dan suspected, Phil is still not in the best shape, and after one shower and one orgasm he doesn\u2019t have much energy to do much else other than finally get the rest he needs.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to eat?\u201d Dan asks. He\u2019s leaning over Phil\u2019s blanket covered body, pushing his hair back from his face. They both know he\u2019s checking his temperature, but both are willing to pretend it\u2019s just an affectionate gesture. Usually, Phil can get quite stubborn about that, especially when he says he\u2019s fine, but today neither of them has the energy or the desire to bicker and get annoyed, so Phil lets Dan check, and Dan lets Phil nuzzle into his hand even after he\u2019s done checking.</p><p>\u201cToast?\u201d Phil says, and there\u2019s a small, mischievous smirk at the corner of his mouth, but it makes Dan\u2019s stomach feel funny again nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t joke about that,\u201d he says, moving his hand away.</p><p>Phil looks up at him. He looks a little surprised, as if he genuinely thought Dan would find it funny. It makes Dan feel guilty, somehow, because he knows Phil wants the feeling of normalcy right now and he wants to give it to him. But seeing Phil on the floor at 5 AM, feeling lost and not knowing what to do when instead of wanting to go to the hospital Phil started giving him specific food requests, well, that wasn\u2019t a funny reminder to him. At least not yet.</p><p>\u201cWhat, are you the only one allowed to joke about this?\u201d Phil asks, but he doesn\u2019t sound annoyed, he sounds curious and a little worried but mostly he still sounds really, really tired.</p><p>Dan leans down, kissing Phil\u2019s forehead and then his lips. Phil\u2019s lips are pliant under his, not kissing back much but just letting himself be kissed, but Dan isn\u2019t surprised when he\u2019s still trying to chase after him when he pulls away and straightens back up, letting out a small noise of protest. Phil really likes to be kissed like that, sometimes, when he needs to feel taken care of.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you pancakes,\u201d Dan says, matter of fact. \u201cAmerican Pancakes,\u201d he adds, watching the way Phil\u2019s eyes sparkle at his words.</p><p>Phil sneaks his hand from under the blanket, taking hold of Dan\u2019s and pulling it to his face, pressing his lips one, two, three times right to the center of his palm, fingers rubbing circles against his wrist.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he says. And even thought Dan wants to say something sarcastic about Phil loving him only for his willingness to make pancakes, it just doesn\u2019t feel right at that moment.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d he says instead. \u201cSo much,\u201d he adds. Because sometimes, he thinks, it needs to be said.<br/>And judging by the way Phil looks at him after, all soft and warm and happy, sometimes, it needs to be heard as well.</p><p>*****************************</p><p>Dan\u2019s been trapped sitting on the sofa for the last hour, staring absentmindedly at the great British bake off reruns playing on their TV.</p><p>Phil is sleeping on his lap, his face pressed to Dan\u2019s stomach, snoring softly, one hand clenching Dan\u2019s thigh.</p><p>He lost all feeling in his left leg at this point, and he stupidly left his laptop in the bedroom, so really, he can\u2019t complain when his phone suddenly starts vibrating in his pocket, making him carefully shift Phil to a pillow so he could get up to get the call (Phil makes a small protest sound, but a simple \u201cshh,\u201d from Dan and a pet on the head is enough to soothe him back to sleep.)</p><p>He\u2019s not surprised when he sees who\u2019s calling him.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d Dan answers when he\u2019s out if the room, still trying to keep his voice down. Phil is a heavy sleeper, but for some reason it feels more appropriate like this.</p><p>\u201cHello dear,\u201d he hears Kath\u2019s warm voice say, \u201cHow are you boys doing today?\u201d she asks.</p><p>Dan called Phil\u2019s parents the day before, despite Phil\u2019s protests that they should wait until they actually know what\u2019s wrong. \u201cThey are going to see twitter anyway,\u201d Dan reasoned, to which Phil had nothing to say. It\u2019s better to tweet about it, they\u2019ve decided, before someone else beats them to it. \u2018Dan and Phil were spotted at the hospital\u2019 sounds much worse coming from someone else\u2019s mouth than it is from theirs.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re okay, better,\u201d Dan says. \u201cHe\u2019s sleeping now.\u201d</p><p>Dan makes his way to the kitchen, too restless to stay still.</p><p>\u201cDid the hospital call?\u201d she asks. She sounds calm now, collected, but yesterday her voice was worried and tight even though Phil reassured her multiple times he was feeling a lot better.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. They said it could take up to 3 days until they can do an MRI.\u201d He puts the kettle on without even noticing, takes out two mugs from the cupboard automatically.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d she says, and he\u2019s not sure who she\u2019s trying to reassure, him or herself. \u201cHe\u2019s a strong lad, takes after his mother,\u201d she says, and Dan\u2019s lips stretch into a smile.</p><p>\u201cHe sure does,\u201d he says, pouring himself a cup of tea, green, no sugar.</p><p>\u201cBut even so, keep an eye on him, okay?\u201d she says. \u201cI know I don\u2019t need to ask, but a mother never stops worrying about her babies, even when they have someone else to take care of them.\u201d</p><p>Dan stops himself then, noticing that he\u2019s about to make Phil\u2019s usual afternoon coffee for him. Milk and two sugars. He wants to laugh. Taking care of Phil has become such a second nature to him, a habit, he\u2019s doing it even when he really doesn\u2019t intend to. And he hopes, selfishly, that he\u2019ll get to keep doing it for a long long time. (He would have said forever, if he was like Phil. But he\u2019s not, so he\u2019ll settle for another 80 years or so, at least).</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t let my eyes off of him for a second,\u201d he says, and suddenly he really wants to end their conversation and make good on his words.</p><p>\u201cI know you won\u2019t,\u201d she says, and she sounds warm and fond and Dan has a weird feeling like he should thank her. For trusting him. For letting him take care of her son. For taking care of him so well all those years before Dan was in the picture. For taking care of him for some of the years he already was but wasn\u2019t able to do everything that he wish he could at the time.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say it though. He doesn\u2019t want to get all weird and emotional for no good reason, and besides, he knows that she knows. He knows by the way she welcomes him into her family and by the way she hugs him when they see each other and by the way she calls his number instead of Phil\u2019s from time to time to ask after their wellbeing. She knows how grateful he is. Sometimes, things need to be said. But other times, it\u2019s also okay to leave them implied, he thinks.</p><p>They finish their conversation after that, saying their goodbyes, and Dan promises to update her the moment he knows anything.</p><p>He ends up not drinking his tea, making his way back to the lounge and finding it empty.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t feel quite as panicked as he did in the morning, but the feeling of not knowing where Phil is is still an uncomfortable one, and he doesn\u2019t fully relax until he steps into their bedroom, finding Phil curled under the covers, phone in hand.</p><p>Phil turns his head to him for a moment before flopping back down on his pillow, putting his phone aside and taking his glasses off. That\u2019s Phil for \u2018come cuddle me now, please,\u2019 Dan knows quite well, and he wastes no time to oblige.</p><p>\u201cWho were you talking to?\u201d Phil asks while Dan settles on the bed next to him.</p><p>\u201cYour mum,\u201d Dan says, manhandling Phil to his side, back to Dan\u2019s chest, wrapping himself around him.</p><p>\u201cIs that a \u2018your mum\u2019 joke?\u201d Phil asks, and Dan buries his face in the back of Phil\u2019s neck, letting out a loud laugh.</p><p>\u201cNo, it was your actual mother, the woman who gave birth to you and had to raise you even though you were a demon child,\u201d he says, and he feels Phil reach behind him to try and give Dan a slap on the thigh, but it feels more like an affectionate pat and it makes Phil\u2019s body press closer to his front, so he\u2019s really not complaining.</p><p>\u201cWas she worried?\u201d Phil asks. Phil hates making his mum worry, even more than he hates making Dan worry.</p><p>\u201cShe was,\u201d he says, kissing the back of Phil\u2019s head. Phil wiggles a bit, wrapping his own arms around Dan\u2019s. \u201cBut it\u2019s okay,\u201d he adds, squeezing Phil a little harder. \u201cShe knows you\u2019re in good hands.\u201d</p><hr><p>Notes:</p><p>thank you for reading! i didn&rsquo;t have time to write recently, but i had such a good time writing this! hope you liked it ^.^<br/>please let me know what you thought!! &lt;3</p>",

As Dan suspected, Phil is still not in the best shape, and after one shower and one orgasm he doesn\u2019t have much energy to do much else other than finally get the rest he needs.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to eat?\u201d Dan asks. He\u2019s leaning over Phil\u2019s blanket covered body, pushing his hair back from his face. They both know he\u2019s checking his temperature, but both are willing to pretend it\u2019s just an affectionate gesture. Usually, Phil can get quite stubborn about that, especially when he says he\u2019s fine, but today neither of them has the energy or the desire to bicker and get annoyed, so Phil lets Dan check, and Dan lets Phil nuzzle into his hand even after he\u2019s done checking.</p><p>\u201cToast?\u201d Phil says, and there\u2019s a small, mischievous smirk at the corner of his mouth, but it makes Dan\u2019s stomach feel funny again nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t joke about that,\u201d he says, moving his hand away.</p><p>Phil looks up at him. He looks a little surprised, as if he genuinely thought Dan would find it funny. It makes Dan feel guilty, somehow, because he knows Phil wants the feeling of normalcy right now and he wants to give it to him. But seeing Phil on the floor at 5 AM, feeling lost and not knowing what to do when instead of wanting to go to the hospital Phil started giving him specific food requests, well, that wasn\u2019t a funny reminder to him. At least not yet.</p><p>\u201cWhat, are you the only one allowed to joke about this?\u201d Phil asks, but he doesn\u2019t sound annoyed, he sounds curious and a little worried but mostly he still sounds really, really tired.</p><p>Dan leans down, kissing Phil\u2019s forehead and then his lips. Phil\u2019s lips are pliant under his, not kissing back much but just letting himself be kissed, but Dan isn\u2019t surprised when he\u2019s still trying to chase after him when he pulls away and straightens back up, letting out a small noise of protest. Phil really likes to be kissed like that, sometimes, when he needs to feel taken care of.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you pancakes,\u201d Dan says, matter of fact. \u201cAmerican Pancakes,\u201d he adds, watching the way Phil\u2019s eyes sparkle at his words.</p><p>Phil sneaks his hand from under the blanket, taking hold of Dan\u2019s and pulling it to his face, pressing his lips one, two, three times right to the center of his palm, fingers rubbing circles against his wrist.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he says. And even thought Dan wants to say something sarcastic about Phil loving him only for his willingness to make pancakes, it just doesn\u2019t feel right at that moment.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d he says instead. \u201cSo much,\u201d he adds. Because sometimes, he thinks, it needs to be said.<br>And judging by the way Phil looks at him after, all soft and warm and happy, sometimes, it needs to be heard as well.</p><p>*****************************</p><p>Dan\u2019s been trapped sitting on the sofa for the last hour, staring absentmindedly at the great British bake off reruns playing on their TV.</p><p>Phil is sleeping on his lap, his face pressed to Dan\u2019s stomach, snoring softly, one hand clenching Dan\u2019s thigh.</p><p>He lost all feeling in his left leg at this point, and he stupidly left his laptop in the bedroom, so really, he can\u2019t complain when his phone suddenly starts vibrating in his pocket, making him carefully shift Phil to a pillow so he could get up to get the call (Phil makes a small protest sound, but a simple \u201cshh,\u201d from Dan and a pet on the head is enough to soothe him back to sleep.)</p><p>He\u2019s not surprised when he sees who\u2019s calling him.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d Dan answers when he\u2019s out if the room, still trying to keep his voice down. Phil is a heavy sleeper, but for some reason it feels more appropriate like this.</p><p>\u201cHello dear,\u201d he hears Kath\u2019s warm voice say, \u201cHow are you boys doing today?\u201d she asks.</p><p>Dan called Phil\u2019s parents the day before, despite Phil\u2019s protests that they should wait until they actually know what\u2019s wrong. \u201cThey are going to see twitter anyway,\u201d Dan reasoned, to which Phil had nothing to say. It\u2019s better to tweet about it, they\u2019ve decided, before someone else beats them to it. \u2018Dan and Phil were spotted at the hospital\u2019 sounds much worse coming from someone else\u2019s mouth than it is from theirs.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re okay, better,\u201d Dan says. \u201cHe\u2019s sleeping now.\u201d</p><p>Dan makes his way to the kitchen, too restless to stay still.</p><p>\u201cDid the hospital call?\u201d she asks. She sounds calm now, collected, but yesterday her voice was worried and tight even though Phil reassured her multiple times he was feeling a lot better.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. They said it could take up to 3 days until they can do an MRI.\u201d He puts the kettle on without even noticing, takes out two mugs from the cupboard automatically.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d she says, and he\u2019s not sure who she\u2019s trying to reassure, him or herself. \u201cHe\u2019s a strong lad, takes after his mother,\u201d she says, and Dan\u2019s lips stretch into a smile.</p><p>\u201cHe sure does,\u201d he says, pouring himself a cup of tea, green, no sugar.</p><p>\u201cBut even so, keep an eye on him, okay?\u201d she says. \u201cI know I don\u2019t need to ask, but a mother never stops worrying about her babies, even when they have someone else to take care of them.\u201d</p><p>Dan stops himself then, noticing that he\u2019s about to make Phil\u2019s usual afternoon coffee for him. Milk and two sugars. He wants to laugh. Taking care of Phil has become such a second nature to him, a habit, he\u2019s doing it even when he really doesn\u2019t intend to. And he hopes, selfishly, that he\u2019ll get to keep doing it for a long long time. (He would have said forever, if he was like Phil. But he\u2019s not, so he\u2019ll settle for another 80 years or so, at least).</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t let my eyes off of him for a second,\u201d he says, and suddenly he really wants to end their conversation and make good on his words.</p><p>\u201cI know you won\u2019t,\u201d she says, and she sounds warm and fond and Dan has a weird feeling like he should thank her. For trusting him. For letting him take care of her son. For taking care of him so well all those years before Dan was in the picture. For taking care of him for some of the years he already was but wasn\u2019t able to do everything that he wish he could at the time.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say it though. He doesn\u2019t want to get all weird and emotional for no good reason, and besides, he knows that she knows. He knows by the way she welcomes him into her family and by the way she hugs him when they see each other and by the way she calls his number instead of Phil\u2019s from time to time to ask after their wellbeing. She knows how grateful he is. Sometimes, things need to be said. But other times, it\u2019s also okay to leave them implied, he thinks.</p><p>They finish their conversation after that, saying their goodbyes, and Dan promises to update her the moment he knows anything.</p><p>He ends up not drinking his tea, making his way back to the lounge and finding it empty.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t feel quite as panicked as he did in the morning, but the feeling of not knowing where Phil is is still an uncomfortable one, and he doesn\u2019t fully relax until he steps into their bedroom, finding Phil curled under the covers, phone in hand.</p><p>Phil turns his head to him for a moment before flopping back down on his pillow, putting his phone aside and taking his glasses off. That\u2019s Phil for \u2018come cuddle me now, please,\u2019 Dan knows quite well, and he wastes no time to oblige.</p><p>\u201cWho were you talking to?\u201d Phil asks while Dan settles on the bed next to him.</p><p>\u201cYour mum,\u201d Dan says, manhandling Phil to his side, back to Dan\u2019s chest, wrapping himself around him.</p><p>\u201cIs that a \u2018your mum\u2019 joke?\u201d Phil asks, and Dan buries his face in the back of Phil\u2019s neck, letting out a loud laugh.</p><p>\u201cNo, it was your actual mother, the woman who gave birth to you and had to raise you even though you were a demon child,\u201d he says, and he feels Phil reach behind him to try and give Dan a slap on the thigh, but it feels more like an affectionate pat and it makes Phil\u2019s body press closer to his front, so he\u2019s really not complaining.</p><p>\u201cWas she worried?\u201d Phil asks. Phil hates making his mum worry, even more than he hates making Dan worry.</p><p>\u201cShe was,\u201d he says, kissing the back of Phil\u2019s head. Phil wiggles a bit, wrapping his own arms around Dan\u2019s. \u201cBut it\u2019s okay,\u201d he adds, squeezing Phil a little harder. \u201cShe knows you\u2019re in good hands.\u201d</p><hr><p>Notes:</p><p>thank you for reading! i didn\u2019t have time to write recently, but i had such a good time writing this! hope you liked it ^.^<br>please let me know what you thought!! &lt;3</p>",

The room is uncomfortably warm (Dan remembers Phil feeling slightly chilly the night before, and his own panicked overreaction that made him turn on the heat higher than they usually would, instead of just getting another blanket, despite Phil\u2019s protests).</p><p>In his half asleep state, Dan notices that the light coming in from the window is faint, keeping the quiet room dim, almost dark, but as that doesn\u2019t really mean anything at this time of year he picks up his phone from the nightstand and checks the time, squinting against the sudden bright light. 8:30 AM, he reads. Too early to wake up when they haven\u2019t set an alarm to force them out of bed, he thinks. And definitely too early for Phil to be awake and functioning when he\u2019s on bed rest (doctor\u2019s orders, of course, but it\u2019s not like Phil is one to pass on an opportunity to stay in bed and get babied when he\u2019s under the weather, even without an open invitation).</p><p>Dan\u2019s uncomfortable sick feeling intensifies for a moment, making him close his eyes and take a deep breath to calm himself down. His mind is showing him horrible pictures from yesterday morning. Pictures of a pale, weak looking Phil lying on the floor and calling for him with a panicked voice. The pictures are, truthfully, a lot more dramatic than the reality actually was at that moment, but he\u2019s allowed, he thinks, to be a little dramatic about this. No one, he reasons with himself, can really blame him for that, he\u2019s sure.</p><p>He can feel his body relaxes a bit when he starts hearing the sounds of running water, meaning that Phil is most definitely taking a shower. (He tries to push back the instant, new images that make their way to his mind. Images of the same pale, weak looking Phil, only this time he has a stream of water covering his body while he lies still on the shower floor).</p><p>He pushes himself up from bed all at once at that, a bit too fast, making himself dizzy for a second but not wasting time to compose himself, making his way to the bathroom where he hears the water coming from.</p><p>He\u2019s fine, he tells himself. He\u2019s okay.</p><p>Good enough to get up and go upstairs and start the shower, he keeps reassuring his mind. In addition, before they went to bed, Dan made him swear to wake him up if he feels so much as an uncomfortable tingle on the tip of his nose, so he knows, for sure, that at least for now, Phil is okay.</p><p>That doesn\u2019t stop the overwhelming wave of relief from washing through his body when he hears Phil\u2019s voice say, \u201cyes?\u201d after Dan knocks on the door, probably a little too urgently for 8 am.<br>Dan is only in his boxers, so it doesn\u2019t take him long to get in the room and chuck them off to the side, getting into the shower and under the stream of warm water.</p><p>Phil welcomes him silently, by turning his back to his front and leaning into him, pressing his head back into Dan\u2019s shoulder and letting out a sigh.</p><p>After 9 years, Dan likes to think that he\u2019s pretty fluent in Phil language. He takes pride in it and gets a strong, possessive kind of satisfaction in knowing that no one can understand that language quite as well as him. He even brags about it from time to time, when he has a glass too many of a nice wine at the Lester house, encouraged by a teasing Martyn and laughed at fondly by the Lester parents, usually while being shushed by a pink looking Phil.</p><p>And this, as far as reading Phil goes, is as easy as it gets. It screams \u2018hold me tight and don\u2019t let me go until we can\u2019t possibly stand under this stream of water anymore,\u2019 and Dan has no intention to refuse.</p><p>He wraps his arms around Phil\u2019s waist, fingers skimming over a soft stomach, head resting on a bony shoulder (gently, careful not to put too much weight on Phil, who suddenly feels more delicate than usual in his arms).</p><p>Phil smells like nothing in particular right now. A little of his fruity soap, a little of Dan\u2019s shampoo, but no distinguish smell like he had the day before. No sanitizers and disinfectants and the nauseating, stale smell of a hospital room. He presses his nose to his wet shoulder and just breathes him in, feeling Phil\u2019s long fingers coming up to rest above his, squeezing his hand.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you get up so early?\u201d Dan asks, and he knows that his voice sounds a little accusing but he\u2019s still tired and he\u2019s still worried and saying \u201cplease don\u2019t ever go anywhere when I\u2019m not right there to follow you,\u201d seems a little too much as a response to a morning shower.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep anymore,\u201d Phil says. His eyes are closed and his mouth is slack and he looks just fine, but Dan\u2019s stomach still does a little unpleasant flip inside his body.</p><p>\u201cIs it your head again?\u201d Dan asks, and he tries to sound casual, because as much as he worries he knows how easily Phil\u2019s hypochondriac mind gets wound up by his reactions, always has. He learned to control himself, over the years. Sometimes, when Phil needs it, he can be the calm one, the grounding one. Sometimes, when Phil needs it, he can to be whatever Phil wants him to be.</p><p>Phil shakes his head against Dan\u2019s shoulder, and he turns his face a little to place a kiss on Dan\u2019s jaw, letting his lips linger. Phil hasn\u2019t shaved yet, so the kiss feels a little scratchy on Dan\u2019s skin. It\u2019s a simple gesture of affection, familiar sensation, but today it makes Dan hold him even tighter against himself. Makes his chest feel even tighter as well.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my dick,\u201d Phil says, and he moves Dan\u2019s hand down on his body, until he gets to Phil\u2019s semi hard on. He didn\u2019t even notice. \u201cHad another Chris Hemsworth dream, but this one was weird even for me,\u201d he turns around in Dan\u2019s arms, wrapping his own around his shoulders, gliding them down Dan\u2019s wet back and burying his head in the crook of Dan\u2019s neck. He kisses him there softly, starting to push his hips slowly against Dan\u2019s thigh. \u201cDidn\u2019t want to wake you so I thought I\u2019ll take care of it myself.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s still tired, and he\u2019s still poorly, Dan can tell. He\u2019s leaning most of his weight on Dan\u2019s body and his lips against his neck are barely there, lacking energy and enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cYou should have woke me up,\u201d Dan reprimands, but he does it softly, kissing the side of Phil\u2019s head right after so that Phil knows it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s fine, he just wants to be with him right now, he just doesn\u2019t want to let him out of his sight.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re here now,\u201d Phil says, and he speeds up his movements a little, pressing closer to Dan\u2019s body.</p><p>Dan\u2019s hands are griping Phil\u2019s sides harder, keeping him steady, keeping him from leaning away. Keeping him safe from falling down ever again. \u201cYes,\u201d he says, kissing Phil\u2019s head again, \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>****************************</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take a lot for Phil to agree to lie down on the couch while Dan makes them breakfast. As Dan suspected, Phil is still not in the best shape, and after one shower and one orgasm he doesn\u2019t have much energy to do much else other than finally get the rest he needs.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to eat?\u201d Dan asks. He\u2019s leaning over Phil\u2019s blanket covered body, pushing his hair back from his face. They both know he\u2019s checking his temperature, but both are willing to pretend it\u2019s just an affectionate gesture. Usually, Phil can get quite stubborn about that, especially when he says he\u2019s fine, but today neither of them has the energy or the desire to bicker and get annoyed, so Phil lets Dan check, and Dan lets Phil nuzzle into his hand even after he\u2019s done checking.</p><p>\u201cToast?\u201d Phil says, and there\u2019s a small, mischievous smirk at the corner of his mouth, but it makes Dan\u2019s stomach feel funny again nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t joke about that,\u201d he says, moving his hand away.</p><p>Phil looks up at him. He looks a little surprised, as if he genuinely thought Dan would find it funny. It makes Dan feel guilty, somehow, because he knows Phil wants the feeling of normalcy right now and he wants to give it to him. But seeing Phil on the floor at 5 AM, feeling lost and not knowing what to do when instead of wanting to go to the hospital Phil started giving him specific food requests, well, that wasn\u2019t a funny reminder to him. At least not yet.</p><p>\u201cWhat, are you the only one allowed to joke about this?\u201d Phil asks, but he doesn\u2019t sound annoyed, he sounds curious and a little worried but mostly he still sounds really, really tired.</p><p>Dan leans down, kissing Phil\u2019s forehead and then his lips. Phil\u2019s lips are pliant under his, not kissing back much but just letting himself be kissed, but Dan isn\u2019t surprised when he\u2019s still trying to chase after him when he pulls away and straightens back up, letting out a small noise of protest. Phil really likes to be kissed like that, sometimes, when he needs to feel taken care of.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you pancakes,\u201d Dan says, matter of fact. \u201cAmerican Pancakes,\u201d he adds, watching the way Phil\u2019s eyes sparkle at his words.</p><p>Phil sneaks his hand from under the blanket, taking hold of Dan\u2019s and pulling it to his face, pressing his lips one, two, three times right to the center of his palm, fingers rubbing circles against his wrist.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he says. And even thought Dan wants to say something sarcastic about Phil loving him only for his willingness to make pancakes, it just doesn\u2019t feel right at that moment.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d he says instead. \u201cSo much,\u201d he adds. Because sometimes, he thinks, it needs to be said.<br>And judging by the way Phil looks at him after, all soft and warm and happy, sometimes, it needs to be heard as well.</p><p>*****************************</p><p>Dan\u2019s been trapped sitting on the sofa for the last hour, staring absentmindedly at the great British bake off reruns playing on their TV.</p><p>Phil is sleeping on his lap, his face pressed to Dan\u2019s stomach, snoring softly, one hand clenching Dan\u2019s thigh.</p><p>He lost all feeling in his left leg at this point, and he stupidly left his laptop in the bedroom, so really, he can\u2019t complain when his phone suddenly starts vibrating in his pocket, making him carefully shift Phil to a pillow so he could get up to get the call (Phil makes a small protest sound, but a simple \u201cshh,\u201d from Dan and a pet on the head is enough to soothe him back to sleep.)</p><p>He\u2019s not surprised when he sees who\u2019s calling him.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d Dan answers when he\u2019s out if the room, still trying to keep his voice down. Phil is a heavy sleeper, but for some reason it feels more appropriate like this.</p><p>\u201cHello dear,\u201d he hears Kath\u2019s warm voice say, \u201cHow are you boys doing today?\u201d she asks.</p><p>Dan called Phil\u2019s parents the day before, despite Phil\u2019s protests that they should wait until they actually know what\u2019s wrong. \u201cThey are going to see twitter anyway,\u201d Dan reasoned, to which Phil had nothing to say. It\u2019s better to tweet about it, they\u2019ve decided, before someone else beats them to it. \u2018Dan and Phil were spotted at the hospital\u2019 sounds much worse coming from someone else\u2019s mouth than it is from theirs.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re okay, better,\u201d Dan says. \u201cHe\u2019s sleeping now.\u201d</p><p>Dan makes his way to the kitchen, too restless to stay still.</p><p>\u201cDid the hospital call?\u201d she asks. She sounds calm now, collected, but yesterday her voice was worried and tight even though Phil reassured her multiple times he was feeling a lot better.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. They said it could take up to 3 days until they can do an MRI.\u201d He puts the kettle on without even noticing, takes out two mugs from the cupboard automatically.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d she says, and he\u2019s not sure who she\u2019s trying to reassure, him or herself. \u201cHe\u2019s a strong lad, takes after his mother,\u201d she says, and Dan\u2019s lips stretch into a smile.</p><p>\u201cHe sure does,\u201d he says, pouring himself a cup of tea, green, no sugar.</p><p>\u201cBut even so, keep an eye on him, okay?\u201d she says. \u201cI know I don\u2019t need to ask, but a mother never stops worrying about her babies, even when they have someone else to take care of them.\u201d</p><p>Dan stops himself then, noticing that he\u2019s about to make Phil\u2019s usual afternoon coffee for him. Milk and two sugars. He wants to laugh. Taking care of Phil has become such a second nature to him, a habit, he\u2019s doing it even when he really doesn\u2019t intend to. And he hopes, selfishly, that he\u2019ll get to keep doing it for a long long time. (He would have said forever, if he was like Phil. But he\u2019s not, so he\u2019ll settle for another 80 years or so, at least).</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t let my eyes off of him for a second,\u201d he says, and suddenly he really wants to end their conversation and make good on his words.</p><p>\u201cI know you won\u2019t,\u201d she says, and she sounds warm and fond and Dan has a weird feeling like he should thank her. For trusting him. For letting him take care of her son. For taking care of him so well all those years before Dan was in the picture. For taking care of him for some of the years he already was but wasn\u2019t able to do everything that he wish he could at the time.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say it though. He doesn\u2019t want to get all weird and emotional for no good reason, and besides, he knows that she knows. He knows by the way she welcomes him into her family and by the way she hugs him when they see each other and by the way she calls his number instead of Phil\u2019s from time to time to ask after their wellbeing. She knows how grateful he is. Sometimes, things need to be said. But other times, it\u2019s also okay to leave them implied, he thinks.</p><p>They finish their conversation after that, saying their goodbyes, and Dan promises to update her the moment he knows anything.</p><p>He ends up not drinking his tea, making his way back to the lounge and finding it empty.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t feel quite as panicked as he did in the morning, but the feeling of not knowing where Phil is is still an uncomfortable one, and he doesn\u2019t fully relax until he steps into their bedroom, finding Phil curled under the covers, phone in hand.</p><p>Phil turns his head to him for a moment before flopping back down on his pillow, putting his phone aside and taking his glasses off. That\u2019s Phil for \u2018come cuddle me now, please,\u2019 Dan knows quite well, and he wastes no time to oblige.</p><p>\u201cWho were you talking to?\u201d Phil asks while Dan settles on the bed next to him.</p><p>\u201cYour mum,\u201d Dan says, manhandling Phil to his side, back to Dan\u2019s chest, wrapping himself around him.</p><p>\u201cIs that a \u2018your mum\u2019 joke?\u201d Phil asks, and Dan buries his face in the back of Phil\u2019s neck, letting out a loud laugh.</p><p>\u201cNo, it was your actual mother, the woman who gave birth to you and had to raise you even though you were a demon child,\u201d he says, and he feels Phil reach behind him to try and give Dan a slap on the thigh, but it feels more like an affectionate pat and it makes Phil\u2019s body press closer to his front, so he\u2019s really not complaining.</p><p>\u201cWas she worried?\u201d Phil asks. Phil hates making his mum worry, even more than he hates making Dan worry.</p><p>\u201cShe was,\u201d he says, kissing the back of Phil\u2019s head. Phil wiggles a bit, wrapping his own arms around Dan\u2019s. \u201cBut it\u2019s okay,\u201d he adds, squeezing Phil a little harder. \u201cShe knows you\u2019re in good hands.\u201d</p><hr><p>Notes:</p><p>thank you for reading! i didn\u2019t have time to write recently, but i had such a good time writing this! hope you liked it ^.^<br>please let me know what you thought!! &lt;3</p>",

The room is uncomfortably warm (Dan remembers Phil feeling slightly chilly the night before, and his own panicked overreaction that made him turn on the heat higher than they usually would, instead of just getting another blanket, despite Phil&rsquo;s protests).</p><p>In his half asleep state, Dan notices that the light coming in from the window is faint, keeping the quiet room dim, almost dark, but as that doesn&rsquo;t really mean anything at this time of year he picks up his phone from the nightstand and checks the time, squinting against the sudden bright light. 8:30 AM, he reads. Too early to wake up when they haven&rsquo;t set an alarm to force them out of bed, he thinks. And definitely too early for Phil to be awake and functioning when he&rsquo;s on bed rest (doctor&rsquo;s orders, of course, but it&rsquo;s not like Phil is one to pass on an opportunity to stay in bed and get babied when he&rsquo;s under the weather, even without an open invitation).</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s uncomfortable sick feeling intensifies for a moment, making him close his eyes and take a deep breath to calm himself down. His mind is showing him horrible pictures from yesterday morning. Pictures of a pale, weak looking Phil lying on the floor and calling for him with a panicked voice. The pictures are, truthfully, a lot more dramatic than the reality actually was at that moment, but he&rsquo;s allowed, he thinks, to be a little dramatic about this. No one, he reasons with himself, can really blame him for that, he&rsquo;s sure.</p><p>He can feel his body relaxes a bit when he starts hearing the sounds of running water, meaning that Phil is most definitely taking a shower. (He tries to push back the instant, new images that make their way to his mind. Images of the same pale, weak looking Phil, only this time he has a stream of water covering his body while he lies still on the shower floor).</p><p>He pushes himself up from bed all at once at that, a bit too fast, making himself dizzy for a second but not wasting time to compose himself, making his way to the bathroom where he hears the water coming from.</p><p>He&rsquo;s fine, he tells himself. He&rsquo;s okay.</p><p>Good enough to get up and go upstairs and start the shower, he keeps reassuring his mind. In addition, before they went to bed, Dan made him swear to wake him up if he feels so much as an uncomfortable tingle on the tip of his nose, so he knows, for sure, that at least for now, Phil is okay.</p><p>That doesn&rsquo;t stop the overwhelming wave of relief from washing through his body when he hears Phil&rsquo;s voice say, &ldquo;yes?&rdquo; after Dan knocks on the door, probably a little too urgently for 8 am.<br />Dan is only in his boxers, so it doesn&rsquo;t take him long to get in the room and chuck them off to the side, getting into the shower and under the stream of warm water.</p><p>Phil welcomes him silently, by turning his back to his front and leaning into him, pressing his head back into Dan&rsquo;s shoulder and letting out a sigh.</p><p>After 9 years, Dan likes to think that he&rsquo;s pretty fluent in Phil language. He takes pride in it and gets a strong, possessive kind of satisfaction in knowing that no one can understand that language quite as well as him. He even brags about it from time to time, when he has a glass too many of a nice wine at the Lester house, encouraged by a teasing Martyn and laughed at fondly by the Lester parents, usually while being shushed by a pink looking Phil.</p><p>And this, as far as reading Phil goes, is as easy as it gets. It screams &lsquo;hold me tight and don&rsquo;t let me go until we can&rsquo;t possibly stand under this stream of water anymore,&rsquo; and Dan has no intention to refuse.</p><p>He wraps his arms around Phil&rsquo;s waist, fingers skimming over a soft stomach, head resting on a bony shoulder (gently, careful not to put too much weight on Phil, who suddenly feels more delicate than usual in his arms).</p><p>Phil smells like nothing in particular right now. A little of his fruity soap, a little of Dan&rsquo;s shampoo, but no distinguish smell like he had the day before. No sanitizers and disinfectants and the nauseating, stale smell of a hospital room. He presses his nose to his wet shoulder and just breathes him in, feeling Phil&rsquo;s long fingers coming up to rest above his, squeezing his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you get up so early?&rdquo; Dan asks, and he knows that his voice sounds a little accusing but he&rsquo;s still tired and he&rsquo;s still worried and saying &ldquo;please don&rsquo;t ever go anywhere when I&rsquo;m not right there to follow you,&rdquo; seems a little too much as a response to a morning shower.</p><p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t sleep anymore,&rdquo; Phil says. His eyes are closed and his mouth is slack and he looks just fine, but Dan&rsquo;s stomach still does a little unpleasant flip inside his body.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it your head again?&rdquo; Dan asks, and he tries to sound casual, because as much as he worries he knows how easily Phil&rsquo;s hypochondriac mind gets wound up by his reactions, always has. He learned to control himself, over the years. Sometimes, when Phil needs it, he can be the calm one, the grounding one. Sometimes, when Phil needs it, he can to be whatever Phil wants him to be.</p><p>Phil shakes his head against Dan&rsquo;s shoulder, and he turns his face a little to place a kiss on Dan&rsquo;s jaw, letting his lips linger. Phil hasn&rsquo;t shaved yet, so the kiss feels a little scratchy on Dan&rsquo;s skin. It&rsquo;s a simple gesture of affection, familiar sensation, but today it makes Dan hold him even tighter against himself. Makes his chest feel even tighter as well.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my dick,&rdquo; Phil says, and he moves Dan&rsquo;s hand down on his body, until he gets to Phil&rsquo;s semi hard on. He didn&rsquo;t even notice. &ldquo;Had another Chris Hemsworth dream, but this one was weird even for me,&rdquo; he turns around in Dan&rsquo;s arms, wrapping his own around his shoulders, gliding them down Dan&rsquo;s wet back and burying his head in the crook of Dan&rsquo;s neck. He kisses him there softly, starting to push his hips slowly against Dan&rsquo;s thigh. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t want to wake you so I thought I&rsquo;ll take care of it myself.&rdquo;</p><p>He&rsquo;s still tired, and he&rsquo;s still poorly, Dan can tell. He&rsquo;s leaning most of his weight on Dan&rsquo;s body and his lips against his neck are barely there, lacking energy and enthusiasm.</p><p>&ldquo;You should have woke me up,&rdquo; Dan reprimands, but he does it softly, kissing the side of Phil&rsquo;s head right after so that Phil knows it&rsquo;s okay, it&rsquo;s fine, he just wants to be with him right now, he just doesn&rsquo;t want to let him out of his sight.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re here now,&rdquo; Phil says, and he speeds up his movements a little, pressing closer to Dan&rsquo;s body.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s hands are griping Phil&rsquo;s sides harder, keeping him steady, keeping him from leaning away. Keeping him safe from falling down ever again. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he says, kissing Phil&rsquo;s head again, &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p><p>****************************</p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t take a lot for Phil to agree to lie down on the couch while Dan makes them breakfast. As Dan suspected, Phil is still not in the best shape, and after one shower and one orgasm he doesn&rsquo;t have much energy to do much else other than finally get the rest he needs.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you want to eat?&rdquo; Dan asks. He&rsquo;s leaning over Phil&rsquo;s blanket covered body, pushing his hair back from his face. They both know he&rsquo;s checking his temperature, but both are willing to pretend it&rsquo;s just an affectionate gesture. Usually, Phil can get quite stubborn about that, especially when he says he&rsquo;s fine, but today neither of them has the energy or the desire to bicker and get annoyed, so Phil lets Dan check, and Dan lets Phil nuzzle into his hand even after he&rsquo;s done checking.</p><p>&ldquo;Toast?&rdquo; Phil says, and there&rsquo;s a small, mischievous smirk at the corner of his mouth, but it makes Dan&rsquo;s stomach feel funny again nonetheless.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t joke about that,&rdquo; he says, moving his hand away.</p><p>Phil looks up at him. He looks a little surprised, as if he genuinely thought Dan would find it funny. It makes Dan feel guilty, somehow, because he knows Phil wants the feeling of normalcy right now and he wants to give it to him. But seeing Phil on the floor at 5 AM, feeling lost and not knowing what to do when instead of wanting to go to the hospital Phil started giving him specific food requests, well, that wasn&rsquo;t a funny reminder to him. At least not yet.</p><p>&ldquo;What, are you the only one allowed to joke about this?&rdquo; Phil asks, but he doesn&rsquo;t sound annoyed, he sounds curious and a little worried but mostly he still sounds really, really tired.</p><p>Dan leans down, kissing Phil&rsquo;s forehead and then his lips. Phil&rsquo;s lips are pliant under his, not kissing back much but just letting himself be kissed, but Dan isn&rsquo;t surprised when he&rsquo;s still trying to chase after him when he pulls away and straightens back up, letting out a small noise of protest. Phil really likes to be kissed like that, sometimes, when he needs to feel taken care of.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make you pancakes,&rdquo; Dan says, matter of fact. &ldquo;American Pancakes,&rdquo; he adds, watching the way Phil&rsquo;s eyes sparkle at his words.</p><p>Phil sneaks his hand from under the blanket, taking hold of Dan&rsquo;s and pulling it to his face, pressing his lips one, two, three times right to the center of his palm, fingers rubbing circles against his wrist.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he says. And even thought Dan wants to say something sarcastic about Phil loving him only for his willingness to make pancakes, it just doesn&rsquo;t feel right at that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too,&rdquo; he says instead. &ldquo;So much,&rdquo; he adds. Because sometimes, he thinks, it needs to be said.<br />And judging by the way Phil looks at him after, all soft and warm and happy, sometimes, it needs to be heard as well.</p><p>*****************************</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s been trapped sitting on the sofa for the last hour, staring absentmindedly at the great British bake off reruns playing on their TV.</p><p>Phil is sleeping on his lap, his face pressed to Dan&rsquo;s stomach, snoring softly, one hand clenching Dan&rsquo;s thigh.</p><p>He lost all feeling in his left leg at this point, and he stupidly left his laptop in the bedroom, so really, he can&rsquo;t complain when his phone suddenly starts vibrating in his pocket, making him carefully shift Phil to a pillow so he could get up to get the call (Phil makes a small protest sound, but a simple &ldquo;shh,&rdquo; from Dan and a pet on the head is enough to soothe him back to sleep.)</p><p>He&rsquo;s not surprised when he sees who&rsquo;s calling him.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; Dan answers when he&rsquo;s out if the room, still trying to keep his voice down. Phil is a heavy sleeper, but for some reason it feels more appropriate like this.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello dear,&rdquo; he hears Kath&rsquo;s warm voice say, &ldquo;How are you boys doing today?&rdquo; she asks.</p><p>Dan called Phil&rsquo;s parents the day before, despite Phil&rsquo;s protests that they should wait until they actually know what&rsquo;s wrong. &ldquo;They are going to see twitter anyway,&rdquo; Dan reasoned, to which Phil had nothing to say.
