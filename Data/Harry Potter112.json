As the green light blinded him, James Potter hit the floor.</p><p>But then, all of a sudden, he didn\u2019t hit the floor. In fact, he had just walked into a white room, as if made of cloud. He felt calm, at peace.</p><p>James looked around at the white room, and noticed a chair, that had most definitely not been there before. And he knew, instinctively, that he needed to sit in it. </p><p>And so he did. Facing one of the four cloud like walls, the clouds seemed to part, until they were gone.

If it isn&rsquo;t a problem, could you make it a little angsty and fluffy. Thank you so much!<br/></i></p><p><i>(A/N: Of course I can! I hope you like it.)\u00a0</i></p><p>Warnings: None</p><p>Word count: 3,150</p><p>\u00a0The Hufflepuff common room was a comfortable place for all of it&rsquo;s members. Sunlight streamed through circular windows, the air of light chatter and the crackling of logs in the fire made the atmosphere warm and cozy, not to mention the kitchen wasn&rsquo;t far so it was the perfect place to meet up for studies and snacking. The portrait of Helga Hufflepuff above the barrel shaped fireplace smiled at them all as they passed, throwing an occasional wave or concerned &lsquo;are you alright there,&rsquo; when one student was looking particularly stressed or rushed. If you were up too late, seconds away from sleep with your head down in a book, she&rsquo;d wake you and convince you to get to sleep. During the holiday seasons, she would hold her mug of hot butterbeer up to anyone who passed in attempts to get someone to cheers with her.<br/>\u00a0Today was one such holiday or close enough to it (she was currently trying to cheers with a third year that was much too short to reach), there were only three days left of your sixth year and while that terrified you to no end, you knew that you weren&rsquo;t going to be doing your final year at Hogwarts alone.<br/>\u00a0Teddy shifted, attempting to get comfortable on the opposite side of the couch. He had his face down in a book, trying to study for a test that had been sprung on you mere days before your holidays, but he kept eyeing you, something else was on his mind.<br/>\u00a0Strands of turquoise hair fell to block his view and each time it did, he would reach up and move it out of his face. It would stay there for a moment before it would move once again. You watched for a while, finding yourself distracted from your own studies and eventually growing tired of seeing it happen again and again, you reached forward and brushed the hair out of his face for him.<br/>He looked up, slightly startled and nervous before murmuring a thank you when you moved away, but his gaze lingered.</p><!-- more --><p>\u00a0He&rsquo;d been acting kind of strange for a few weeks now so the look he was giving you was nothing new. There was a mix of emotions swarming in his eyes - a kind of fear and melancholy, but he wouldn&rsquo;t tell you what it was about, no matter how many times you tried to pry it out of him.<br/>\u00a0None of your shared friends had managed to get anything out of him either - you even wrote to Harry when he started shutting himself away from everyone but he had no clue as to what could be bothering him either. This was the first time in weeks that he&rsquo;d tried to start a conversation with you.<br/>'What&rsquo;s up,&rsquo; you asked, shifting to sit closer to him. You waited, watching to see if you&rsquo;d pushed it too far, but he didn&rsquo;t move away and didn&rsquo;t leave and rather took in a couple of nervous breaths.<br/>'Well, my godfather - Harry, you know the one you met last summer holidays? Well, he&rsquo;s invited me to Christmas at the Burrow and well you know how big my family is so it&rsquo;s okay if you say no but if you want to, maybe you&rsquo;d like to come over for the holidays too? My uh&hellip; My cousins are dying to meet you, they won&rsquo;t ever stop asking about when they get to meet my boyfriend.&rsquo;<br/>\u00a0Without hesitation, you nodded and smiled softly, reaching your hand out to hold his. He tensed and his eyes met yours at last before he smiled too.<br/>\u00a0When you&rsquo;d owled your parents and received their response, you knew you&rsquo;d have a hell of a ride trying to buy Christmas presents for everyone in his family. He&rsquo;d insisted you didn&rsquo;t need to buy anyone anything but you had to make a good impression. You used the approaching Hogsmede weekend to gather miscellaneous gifts. You knew his godfather Harry was big on Quidditch and managed to snatch him up a set of tiny Quidditch gear to play tiny Quidditch with, Hermione read more often than she breathed so you looked for some new releases at a book shop, Ron was and still is a giant supporter of the Chudley Cannons, so you found him an entire book of collectable cards that displayed each team&rsquo;s member and their best moves and moments. You weren&rsquo;t sure what Teddy&rsquo;s cousin&rsquo;s and other aunts and uncles would like so you played it safe with different types of treats from Hogsmede and vouchers for various stores in Diagon Alley.<br/>\u00a0On the last day of school, there was a giant goodbye feast for everyone who was leaving for the holidays - plump turkeys and golden roast potatoes, just as they did every year, the house elves had out done themselves. It was the perfect way to end the year, along with your outstanding marks in your end of year &ldquo;preparing you for seventh year&rdquo; test. It was finally over, no more exams until after the Christmas holidays, except Teddy hadn&rsquo;t shown up for it.<br/>\u00a0He&rsquo;d spent most of the day hauled up in the dorm and none of the others entered it. One of the boys had approached you to ask if you could make sure the coast was clear before he got his pyjamas, but you were way ahead of him.<br/>\u00a0Teddy looked as if he had been asleep for hours, ruffled turquoise hair glimmering in the moonlight as he flicked through something, sitting on the edge of his four poster yellow bed with his legs dangling off of it. His head snapped up when he saw your face through a crack in the door but made no move to approach you and rather shut what looked like a photo album and slid it under his bed before you could see it.<br/>\u00a0When you had reassured him that you were here for him and asked what was up, he&rsquo;d told you it was nothing and that he just wasn&rsquo;t feeling well but it didn&rsquo;t seem like the Teddy you knew at all, this wasn&rsquo;t just any dinner this was the end of year feast.<br/>\u00a0The ride back to platform nine and three quarters had been alright, especially once the trolley lady came past and you, Teddy and two other Hufflepuff boys stuffed yourselves with cauldron cakes. The weather was clear and sunny, warm enough to leave the house without a jacket but cold enough to wear long sleeved shirts and as the view passed by as blurs of green, you found yourself falling asleep and remaining that way until Teddy reluctantly shook you awake and the two of you left the train together.<br/>\u00a0Teddy&rsquo;s godfather Harry was incredibly noticeable. He stuck out like a sore thumb, even with the thick steam of the Hogwarts Express shrouding the platform. You felt bad for staring considering he got enough unwanted attention as is, but it was too late to feel bad because he noticed you and Teddy, waving and calling you over to join him where he was with his two sons, a daughter and his wife. Teddy smiled, slipping his hand in yours and wheeling his trunk behind him as the two of you approached.<br/>'Nice to see you again Teddy,&rsquo; Harry&rsquo;s hand moved to ruffle Teddy&rsquo;s bright blue hair. He grunted and laughed a little before Harry&rsquo;s attention moved to you. 'Hello again (Y/N), I&rsquo;m glad you could join us.&rsquo;<br/>'So am I.&rsquo;<br/>\u00a0You could feel the nerves creep in as the curious stares of all three Potter children bore into your back. When Hermione, Ron and their children had approached, five pairs of eyes were on you. You squeezed Teddy&rsquo;s hand and felt him squeeze back. Knowing he was there was the most reassuring feeling in the world.<br/>\u00a0Harry signalled for everyone to follow and you all made your way through crowds of reunited families to a very old looking muggle car. You questioned how in Merlin&rsquo;s name the group of you would ever fit in there, but the engorgement charm made it nearly big enough for you to move in and use it as an apartment.<br/>You and Teddy moved to the back of the car beside the Potter&rsquo;s middle child Albus. Albus was the most reserved of all of the Potter siblings, he was the only one who wasn\u2019t still ogling you and instead threw you and Teddy a smile as you moved to sit next to him.<br/>\u00a0When Harry had decided that everyone was &ldquo;ready to rock and roll,&rdquo; you set off on your way to the Burrow where Molly and Arthur Weasley lived. More paddocks filled with cows, horses, sheep and the like passed by - albeit slower than they did during the ride back to King&rsquo;s Cross, but again you felt a familiar type of sleepiness and serenity despite the loud chatter. <br/>\u00a0When you&rsquo;d arrived at the Burrow, you apprehensively grabbed your trunk and caught up to Teddy who was lagging behind Rose, Hugo, Hermione and Ron. The whole house was so&hellip; Homey. It felt more like home than your actual house had. Maybe it was how many lives this house had housed, how much love it had seen or maybe it was the fact that there were so many people inside that it was alive with conversation - the kind of conversation you&rsquo;d expect to hear in a packed theatre.<br/>\u00a0The inside was much bigger than you would&rsquo;ve expected it to have been and when you walked in you were wrapped in the arms of a very excited looking old woman who was moving from person to person with a bright, wide smile that stretched so far beyond her eyes, she looked as if she&rsquo;d just won the lottery. Her embrace wasn&rsquo;t expected but definitely wasn&rsquo;t unappreciated, she was a great hugger.<br/>'You must be Teddy&rsquo;s boyfriend,&rsquo; she stepped back, holding your face between her hands. Your eyes darted to Teddy, who&rsquo;s cheeks had grown red. Molly smiled, observing you before she nodded at Teddy. 'You&rsquo;ve found yourself a real handsome one.&rsquo;<br/>\u00a0Teddy seemed to want to scold her when he noticed the frazzled expression on your face but rather his disapproval was muffled by the material of Molly&rsquo;s shirt. She was too busy hugging him to hear him out.<br/>\u00a0Once everyone had been all hugged out and Molly had finished carrying out everything for lunch, you settled down in the seat next to Teddy&rsquo;s with an unfamiliar girl at your side. She looked the same age as you with bright platinum blonde hair and blue eyes. She seemed very refined and smiled politely at you when she noticed you. You could&rsquo;ve sworn you knew her from somewhere, maybe she was a Hufflepuff too? <br/>\u00a0There were a couple of seconds that passed before she realised she hadn&rsquo;t introduced herself and quickly turned to you, sticking out her hand.<br/>&ldquo;ello, I&rsquo;m sorry, I didn&rsquo;t introduce myself, I&rsquo;m Victorie, Victorie Weasley.&rsquo;<br/>\u00a0You could immediately pin point her slight accent, she must be Bill and Fleur Delacour&rsquo;s eldest daughter. Teddy had made sure to let you know who everyone who was going to be there would be and you seemed to be doing pretty good so far. You introduced yourself too and shook hands with her. She smiled and giggled before she turned back to her plate and started working on the roast chicken in front of her.<br/>\u00a0Molly had done an incredible job with everything she made, the very smell made your mouth water violently and everything down to the roast carrots was cooked so well she could rival the Hogwarts annual Christmas feast, and that was saying a lot. It seemed that everyone was enjoying the meal just as much as you were, everyone except Teddy.<br/>\u00a0Teddy seemed uncomfortable, nudging a roasted potato with the edge of his fork and staring down at it blankly. He was distracted, so much so that when his name was called by Harry who was the head at the opposite end of the table, he didn&rsquo;t notice. To his credit, it was a fairly long table, but nevertheless, Harry tried to get his attention enough times for it to be concerning. You nudged him softly with your elbow, which made his head snap towards you, eyes widening. You tilted your head in the direction of Harry and Harry asked him how his last few days at Hogwarts were again - for the fourth time.<br/>\u00a0Only a few minutes passed of him talking to Harry before he suddenly stood, claiming he wasn&rsquo;t feeling well and making his way up to the room that had been set up for all of the boys to sleep in. It was going to be incredibly awkward now that you thought about it, you barely knew Albus, Hugo, Lewis, Fred or James - you didn&rsquo;t really know them well enough to feel comfortable starting a conversation with them, yet alone sharing a room with them.<br/>\u00a0You thought about the smell of the apple pie coming from the kitchen, the rich scent of apples and cinnamon was enough to fill your dreams for the next one hundred years, but there were more important things than apple pie and one of those things was Teddy. You excused yourself and thanked Molly for dinner, insisting on cleaning up after yourself and rushing up the stairs to the boys room when you were done. You knocked on the door but there was no response. Just when you were about to knock again, a quiet voice broke the silence.<br/>'Who is it?&rsquo;<br/>\u00a0It was enough for you to worry. Teddy sounded upset, more than upset - he sounded the same way he did when he had told you about his parents. The very tone of voice made your stomach lurch. 'It&rsquo;s (Y/N), can I come in?&rsquo;<br/>\u00a0There was shuffling and a pause before the door was unlocked and Teddy opened it just a crack. He&rsquo;d definitely been crying, his eyes were red and puffy, as if in the time it took you to get here, he&rsquo;d sobbed enough for his tear ducts to give up. You felt guilt coarse through you, you should&rsquo;ve been on your feet as soon as he was. 'Are you alright love?&rsquo;<br/>\u00a0He pulled the door open and let it swing on it&rsquo;s hinges, closing it behind you as you moved into the room. He said nothing, moving to the opposite side of the room and staring out of the window and into the street bellow it.\u00a0<br/>'You know you can talk to me about anything right? You&rsquo;ve been off for weeks and I just don&rsquo;t know how much longer I can take it without knowing whats up. I won&rsquo;t judge you for whatever it is, I promise.&rsquo; You coaxed, moving to sit on the end of his bed. Teddy nodded, still avoiding your gaze and watching passing cars go by. A few more minutes passed before he sighed and sat down next to you, head falling onto your shoulder.<br/>'Why did you choose to come with me,&rsquo; Teddy started, voice scratchy and hoarse. 'You know, instead of spending Christmas with your family.&rsquo;<br/>\u00a0You threw an arm around Teddy&rsquo;s shoulder and sighed, pushing your cheek into his thick, messy hair. 'Because I love you and I love your family.&rsquo; Teddy mumbled something under his breath. 'Sorry handsome I didn&rsquo;t catch that.&rsquo;<br/>'They&rsquo;re not my family.&rsquo;<br/>\u00a0You drew away from Teddy to look at him. He didn&rsquo;t meet your eyes, instead facing the wall his bed was pressed up against. You moved your hands to hold his cheeks. 'What do you mean?&rsquo;<br/>'They&rsquo;re not my family - not really. I&rsquo;m just the kid they pity who doesn&rsquo;t have a real family to spend Christmas with.&rsquo;<br/>\u00a0Teddy choked on a sob and you felt your heart twist violently in your chest. You moved his face so that he was forced to look at you and ran your finger over his cheeks where fresh tears had fallen. 'Teddy, they are your family-&rsquo;<br/>'No they&rsquo;re not.&rsquo;<br/>'Teddy-&rsquo;<br/>'They aren&rsquo;t my real family, Harry isn&rsquo;t my dad - not my real dad and-&rsquo;<br/>'Teddy!&rsquo; Teddy paused, eyes darting to yours at your outburst. 'I&rsquo;m sorry, but they don&rsquo;t pity you, you are their family. They may not be your parents or cousins by blood, but they care about you and that&rsquo;s what really matters.&rsquo;<br/>\u00a0You sat in silence. Teddy choked on another sob, tears welling in the corners of his eyes. He stayed like that for a while, crying and leaning into the palm of your hands. It was hard not to cry with him, the whole two years you&rsquo;d been together - he&rsquo;d never talked about his parents like this. You realise now that he wasn&rsquo;t over it, he was just holding it all in.<br/>'I just wish I had of m-met them you know, my mum and dad.&rsquo;<br/>\u00a0You nodded, moving to pull him towards your chest, he didn&rsquo;t fight you, instead nuzzling into you. You moved your hand to sit on the top of his head. 'They were amazing people - you remember, Harry told us about all of the stuff your dad did when he was at Hogwarts? About the map? And your mum, she used to turn into teachers for fun.&rsquo; Teddy nodded, snickering slightly though it came out as more of a sniffle. 'You know, they&rsquo;re proud of you, I&rsquo;m sure of it. I&rsquo;m sure they miss you just as much as you miss them.&rsquo;<br/>\u00a0Teddy nodded, hiccuping again as fresh tears spilled. 'Here&rsquo;s the cheesy part - they&rsquo;re not really gone. As long as you remember them, they&rsquo;re never really gone. They&rsquo;re here in little things like your hair, your eyes and the map. They were brave and strong and you are too Teddy, you are them and they are with you every step of the way - just like I am, just like all of your family is and always will be.&rsquo;<br/>\u00a0Teddy lifted his eyes to meet yours, pulling away from your neck. 'So I guess you&rsquo;re my family too?&rsquo; You nodded, smiling and lifting your hand to brush away tears from his face again. 'That&rsquo;s weird.&rsquo;<br/>\u00a0Your Teddy was finally coming back. You laughed, punching him softly on the arm. Just as he had collected himself again and practically fallen onto you for cuddles, several Potters, Weasleys and a Granger-Weasley burst into the room, laughing and talking between one and other. James winked at the two of you, Albus smiling softly while Hugo, Lewis and Fred were still caught up in their strange chant that you could hear from here since it had started.<br/>\u00a0Teddy smiled fondly at them, they were his family and he hoped that one day you&rsquo;d become a part of it too - for real.</p>",

You knew his godfather Harry was big on Quidditch and managed to snatch him up a set of tiny Quidditch gear to play tiny Quidditch with, Hermione read more often than she breathed so you looked for some new releases at a book shop, Ron was and still is a giant supporter of the Chudley Cannons, so you found him an entire book of collectable cards that displayed each team\u2019s member and their best moves and moments. You weren\u2019t sure what Teddy\u2019s cousin\u2019s and other aunts and uncles would like so you played it safe with different types of treats from Hogsmede and vouchers for various stores in Diagon Alley.<br>\u00a0On the last day of school, there was a giant goodbye feast for everyone who was leaving for the holidays - plump turkeys and golden roast potatoes, just as they did every year, the house elves had out done themselves. It was the perfect way to end the year, along with your outstanding marks in your end of year \u201cpreparing you for seventh year\u201d test. It was finally over, no more exams until after the Christmas holidays, except Teddy hadn\u2019t shown up for it.<br>\u00a0He\u2019d spent most of the day hauled up in the dorm and none of the others entered it. One of the boys had approached you to ask if you could make sure the coast was clear before he got his pyjamas, but you were way ahead of him.<br>\u00a0Teddy looked as if he had been asleep for hours, ruffled turquoise hair glimmering in the moonlight as he flicked through something, sitting on the edge of his four poster yellow bed with his legs dangling off of it. His head snapped up when he saw your face through a crack in the door but made no move to approach you and rather shut what looked like a photo album and slid it under his bed before you could see it.<br>\u00a0When you had reassured him that you were here for him and asked what was up, he\u2019d told you it was nothing and that he just wasn\u2019t feeling well but it didn\u2019t seem like the Teddy you knew at all, this wasn\u2019t just any dinner this was the end of year feast.<br>\u00a0The ride back to platform nine and three quarters had been alright, especially once the trolley lady came past and you, Teddy and two other Hufflepuff boys stuffed yourselves with cauldron cakes. The weather was clear and sunny, warm enough to leave the house without a jacket but cold enough to wear long sleeved shirts and as the view passed by as blurs of green, you found yourself falling asleep and remaining that way until Teddy reluctantly shook you awake and the two of you left the train together.<br>\u00a0Teddy\u2019s godfather Harry was incredibly noticeable. He stuck out like a sore thumb, even with the thick steam of the Hogwarts Express shrouding the platform. You felt bad for staring considering he got enough unwanted attention as is, but it was too late to feel bad because he noticed you and Teddy, waving and calling you over to join him where he was with his two sons, a daughter and his wife. Teddy smiled, slipping his hand in yours and wheeling his trunk behind him as the two of you approached.<br>'Nice to see you again Teddy,\u2019 Harry\u2019s hand moved to ruffle Teddy\u2019s bright blue hair. He grunted and laughed a little before Harry\u2019s attention moved to you. 'Hello again (Y/N), I\u2019m glad you could join us.\u2019<br>'So am I.\u2019<br>\u00a0You could feel the nerves creep in as the curious stares of all three Potter children bore into your back. When Hermione, Ron and their children had approached, five pairs of eyes were on you. You squeezed Teddy\u2019s hand and felt him squeeze back. Knowing he was there was the most reassuring feeling in the world.<br>\u00a0Harry signalled for everyone to follow and you all made your way through crowds of reunited families to a very old looking muggle car. You questioned how in Merlin\u2019s name the group of you would ever fit in there, but the engorgement charm made it nearly big enough for you to move in and use it as an apartment.<br>You and Teddy moved to the back of the car beside the Potter\u2019s middle child Albus. Albus was the most reserved of all of the Potter siblings, he was the only one who wasn\u2019t still ogling you and instead threw you and Teddy a smile as you moved to sit next to him.<br>\u00a0When Harry had decided that everyone was \u201cready to rock and roll,\u201d you set off on your way to the Burrow where Molly and Arthur Weasley lived. More paddocks filled with cows, horses, sheep and the like passed by - albeit slower than they did during the ride back to King\u2019s Cross, but again you felt a familiar type of sleepiness and serenity despite the loud chatter. <br>\u00a0When you\u2019d arrived at the Burrow, you apprehensively grabbed your trunk and caught up to Teddy who was lagging behind Rose, Hugo, Hermione and Ron. The whole house was so\u2026 Homey. It felt more like home than your actual house had. Maybe it was how many lives this house had housed, how much love it had seen or maybe it was the fact that there were so many people inside that it was alive with conversation - the kind of conversation you\u2019d expect to hear in a packed theatre.<br>\u00a0The inside was much bigger than you would\u2019ve expected it to have been and when you walked in you were wrapped in the arms of a very excited looking old woman who was moving from person to person with a bright, wide smile that stretched so far beyond her eyes, she looked as if she\u2019d just won the lottery. Her embrace wasn\u2019t expected but definitely wasn\u2019t unappreciated, she was a great hugger.<br>'You must be Teddy\u2019s boyfriend,\u2019 she stepped back, holding your face between her hands. Your eyes darted to Teddy, who\u2019s cheeks had grown red. Molly smiled, observing you before she nodded at Teddy. 'You\u2019ve found yourself a real handsome one.\u2019<br>\u00a0Teddy seemed to want to scold her when he noticed the frazzled expression on your face but rather his disapproval was muffled by the material of Molly\u2019s shirt. She was too busy hugging him to hear him out.<br>\u00a0Once everyone had been all hugged out and Molly had finished carrying out everything for lunch, you settled down in the seat next to Teddy\u2019s with an unfamiliar girl at your side. She looked the same age as you with bright platinum blonde hair and blue eyes. She seemed very refined and smiled politely at you when she noticed you. You could\u2019ve sworn you knew her from somewhere, maybe she was a Hufflepuff too? <br>\u00a0There were a couple of seconds that passed before she realised she hadn\u2019t introduced herself and quickly turned to you, sticking out her hand.<br>\u201cello, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t introduce myself, I\u2019m Victorie, Victorie Weasley.\u2019<br>\u00a0You could immediately pin point her slight accent, she must be Bill and Fleur Delacour\u2019s eldest daughter. Teddy had made sure to let you know who everyone who was going to be there would be and you seemed to be doing pretty good so far. You introduced yourself too and shook hands with her. She smiled and giggled before she turned back to her plate and started working on the roast chicken in front of her.<br>\u00a0Molly had done an incredible job with everything she made, the very smell made your mouth water violently and everything down to the roast carrots was cooked so well she could rival the Hogwarts annual Christmas feast, and that was saying a lot. It seemed that everyone was enjoying the meal just as much as you were, everyone except Teddy.<br>\u00a0Teddy seemed uncomfortable, nudging a roasted potato with the edge of his fork and staring down at it blankly. He was distracted, so much so that when his name was called by Harry who was the head at the opposite end of the table, he didn\u2019t notice. To his credit, it was a fairly long table, but nevertheless, Harry tried to get his attention enough times for it to be concerning. You nudged him softly with your elbow, which made his head snap towards you, eyes widening. You tilted your head in the direction of Harry and Harry asked him how his last few days at Hogwarts were again - for the fourth time.<br>\u00a0Only a few minutes passed of him talking to Harry before he suddenly stood, claiming he wasn\u2019t feeling well and making his way up to the room that had been set up for all of the boys to sleep in. It was going to be incredibly awkward now that you thought about it, you barely knew Albus, Hugo, Lewis, Fred or James - you didn\u2019t really know them well enough to feel comfortable starting a conversation with them, yet alone sharing a room with them.<br>\u00a0You thought about the smell of the apple pie coming from the kitchen, the rich scent of apples and cinnamon was enough to fill your dreams for the next one hundred years, but there were more important things than apple pie and one of those things was Teddy. You excused yourself and thanked Molly for dinner, insisting on cleaning up after yourself and rushing up the stairs to the boys room when you were done. You knocked on the door but there was no response. Just when you were about to knock again, a quiet voice broke the silence.<br>'Who is it?\u2019<br>\u00a0It was enough for you to worry. Teddy sounded upset, more than upset - he sounded the same way he did when he had told you about his parents. The very tone of voice made your stomach lurch. 'It\u2019s (Y/N), can I come in?\u2019<br>\u00a0There was shuffling and a pause before the door was unlocked and Teddy opened it just a crack. He\u2019d definitely been crying, his eyes were red and puffy, as if in the time it took you to get here, he\u2019d sobbed enough for his tear ducts to give up. You felt guilt coarse through you, you should\u2019ve been on your feet as soon as he was. 'Are you alright love?\u2019<br>\u00a0He pulled the door open and let it swing on it\u2019s hinges, closing it behind you as you moved into the room. He said nothing, moving to the opposite side of the room and staring out of the window and into the street bellow it.\u00a0<br>'You know you can talk to me about anything right? You\u2019ve been off for weeks and I just don\u2019t know how much longer I can take it without knowing whats up. I won\u2019t judge you for whatever it is, I promise.\u2019 You coaxed, moving to sit on the end of his bed. Teddy nodded, still avoiding your gaze and watching passing cars go by. A few more minutes passed before he sighed and sat down next to you, head falling onto your shoulder.<br>'Why did you choose to come with me,\u2019 Teddy started, voice scratchy and hoarse. 'You know, instead of spending Christmas with your family.\u2019<br>\u00a0You threw an arm around Teddy\u2019s shoulder and sighed, pushing your cheek into his thick, messy hair. 'Because I love you and I love your family.\u2019 Teddy mumbled something under his breath. 'Sorry handsome I didn\u2019t catch that.\u2019<br>'They\u2019re not my family.\u2019<br>\u00a0You drew away from Teddy to look at him. He didn\u2019t meet your eyes, instead facing the wall his bed was pressed up against. You moved your hands to hold his cheeks. 'What do you mean?\u2019<br>'They\u2019re not my family - not really. I\u2019m just the kid they pity who doesn\u2019t have a real family to spend Christmas with.\u2019<br>\u00a0Teddy choked on a sob and you felt your heart twist violently in your chest. You moved his face so that he was forced to look at you and ran your finger over his cheeks where fresh tears had fallen. 'Teddy, they are your family-\u2019<br>'No they\u2019re not.\u2019<br>'Teddy-\u2019<br>'They aren\u2019t my real family, Harry isn\u2019t my dad - not my real dad and-\u2019<br>'Teddy!\u2019 Teddy paused, eyes darting to yours at your outburst. 'I\u2019m sorry, but they don\u2019t pity you, you are their family. They may not be your parents or cousins by blood, but they care about you and that\u2019s what really matters.\u2019<br>\u00a0You sat in silence. Teddy choked on another sob, tears welling in the corners of his eyes. He stayed like that for a while, crying and leaning into the palm of your hands. It was hard not to cry with him, the whole two years you\u2019d been together - he\u2019d never talked about his parents like this. You realise now that he wasn\u2019t over it, he was just holding it all in.<br>'I just wish I had of m-met them you know, my mum and dad.\u2019<br>\u00a0You nodded, moving to pull him towards your chest, he didn\u2019t fight you, instead nuzzling into you. You moved your hand to sit on the top of his head. 'They were amazing people - you remember, Harry told us about all of the stuff your dad did when he was at Hogwarts? About the map? And your mum, she used to turn into teachers for fun.\u2019 Teddy nodded, snickering slightly though it came out as more of a sniffle. 'You know, they\u2019re proud of you, I\u2019m sure of it. I\u2019m sure they miss you just as much as you miss them.\u2019<br>\u00a0Teddy nodded, hiccuping again as fresh tears spilled. 'Here\u2019s the cheesy part - they\u2019re not really gone. As long as you remember them, they\u2019re never really gone. They\u2019re here in little things like your hair, your eyes and the map. They were brave and strong and you are too Teddy, you are them and they are with you every step of the way - just like I am, just like all of your family is and always will be.\u2019<br>\u00a0Teddy lifted his eyes to meet yours, pulling away from your neck. 'So I guess you\u2019re my family too?\u2019 You nodded, smiling and lifting your hand to brush away tears from his face again. 'That\u2019s weird.\u2019<br>\u00a0Your Teddy was finally coming back. You laughed, punching him softly on the arm. Just as he had collected himself again and practically fallen onto you for cuddles, several Potters, Weasleys and a Granger-Weasley burst into the room, laughing and talking between one and other. James winked at the two of you, Albus smiling softly while Hugo, Lewis and Fred were still caught up in their strange chant that you could hear from here since it had started.<br>\u00a0Teddy smiled fondly at them, they were his family and he hoped that one day you\u2019d become a part of it too - for real.</p>",

If it isn\u2019t a problem, could you make it a little angsty and fluffy. Thank you so much!<br></i></p><p><i>(A/N: Of course I can! I hope you like it.)\u00a0</i></p><p>Warnings: None</p><p>Word count: 3,150</p><p>\u00a0The Hufflepuff common room was a comfortable place for all of it\u2019s members. Sunlight streamed through circular windows, the air of light chatter and the crackling of logs in the fire made the atmosphere warm and cozy, not to mention the kitchen wasn\u2019t far so it was the perfect place to meet up for studies and snacking. The portrait of Helga Hufflepuff above the barrel shaped fireplace smiled at them all as they passed, throwing an occasional wave or concerned \u2018are you alright there,\u2019 when one student was looking particularly stressed or rushed. If you were up too late, seconds away from sleep with your head down in a book, she\u2019d wake you and convince you to get to sleep. During the holiday seasons, she would hold her mug of hot butterbeer up to anyone who passed in attempts to get someone to cheers with her.<br>\u00a0Today was one such holiday or close enough to it (she was currently trying to cheers with a third year that was much too short to reach), there were only three days left of your sixth year and while that terrified you to no end, you knew that you weren\u2019t going to be doing your final year at Hogwarts alone.<br>\u00a0Teddy shifted, attempting to get comfortable on the opposite side of the couch. He had his face down in a book, trying to study for a test that had been sprung on you mere days before your holidays, but he kept eyeing you, something else was on his mind.<br>\u00a0Strands of turquoise hair fell to block his view and each time it did, he would reach up and move it out of his face. It would stay there for a moment before it would move once again. You watched for a while, finding yourself distracted from your own studies and eventually growing tired of seeing it happen again and again, you reached forward and brushed the hair out of his face for him.<br>He looked up, slightly startled and nervous before murmuring a thank you when you moved away, but his gaze lingered.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u00a0He\u2019d been acting kind of strange for a few weeks now so the look he was giving you was nothing new. There was a mix of emotions swarming in his eyes - a kind of fear and melancholy, but he wouldn\u2019t tell you what it was about, no matter how many times you tried to pry it out of him.<br>\u00a0None of your shared friends had managed to get anything out of him either - you even wrote to Harry when he started shutting himself away from everyone but he had no clue as to what could be bothering him either. This was the first time in weeks that he\u2019d tried to start a conversation with you.<br>'What\u2019s up,\u2019 you asked, shifting to sit closer to him. You waited, watching to see if you\u2019d pushed it too far, but he didn\u2019t move away and didn\u2019t leave and rather took in a couple of nervous breaths.<br>'Well, my godfather - Harry, you know the one you met last summer holidays? Well, he\u2019s invited me to Christmas at the Burrow and well you know how big my family is so it\u2019s okay if you say no but if you want to, maybe you\u2019d like to come over for the holidays too? My uh\u2026 My cousins are dying to meet you, they won\u2019t ever stop asking about when they get to meet my boyfriend.\u2019<br>\u00a0Without hesitation, you nodded and smiled softly, reaching your hand out to hold his. He tensed and his eyes met yours at last before he smiled too.<br>\u00a0When you\u2019d owled your parents and received their response, you knew you\u2019d have a hell of a ride trying to buy Christmas presents for everyone in his family. He\u2019d insisted you didn\u2019t need to buy anyone anything but you had to make a good impression. You used the approaching Hogsmede weekend to gather miscellaneous gifts. You knew his godfather Harry was big on Quidditch and managed to snatch him up a set of tiny Quidditch gear to play tiny Quidditch with, Hermione read more often than she breathed so you looked for some new releases at a book shop, Ron was and still is a giant supporter of the Chudley Cannons, so you found him an entire book of collectable cards that displayed each team\u2019s member and their best moves and moments. You weren\u2019t sure what Teddy\u2019s cousin\u2019s and other aunts and uncles would like so you played it safe with different types of treats from Hogsmede and vouchers for various stores in Diagon Alley.<br>\u00a0On the last day of school, there was a giant goodbye feast for everyone who was leaving for the holidays - plump turkeys and golden roast potatoes, just as they did every year, the house elves had out done themselves. It was the perfect way to end the year, along with your outstanding marks in your end of year \u201cpreparing you for seventh year\u201d test. It was finally over, no more exams until after the Christmas holidays, except Teddy hadn\u2019t shown up for it.<br>\u00a0He\u2019d spent most of the day hauled up in the dorm and none of the others entered it. One of the boys had approached you to ask if you could make sure the coast was clear before he got his pyjamas, but you were way ahead of him.<br>\u00a0Teddy looked as if he had been asleep for hours, ruffled turquoise hair glimmering in the moonlight as he flicked through something, sitting on the edge of his four poster yellow bed with his legs dangling off of it. His head snapped up when he saw your face through a crack in the door but made no move to approach you and rather shut what looked like a photo album and slid it under his bed before you could see it.<br>\u00a0When you had reassured him that you were here for him and asked what was up, he\u2019d told you it was nothing and that he just wasn\u2019t feeling well but it didn\u2019t seem like the Teddy you knew at all, this wasn\u2019t just any dinner this was the end of year feast.<br>\u00a0The ride back to platform nine and three quarters had been alright, especially once the trolley lady came past and you, Teddy and two other Hufflepuff boys stuffed yourselves with cauldron cakes. The weather was clear and sunny, warm enough to leave the house without a jacket but cold enough to wear long sleeved shirts and as the view passed by as blurs of green, you found yourself falling asleep and remaining that way until Teddy reluctantly shook you awake and the two of you left the train together.<br>\u00a0Teddy\u2019s godfather Harry was incredibly noticeable. He stuck out like a sore thumb, even with the thick steam of the Hogwarts Express shrouding the platform. You felt bad for staring considering he got enough unwanted attention as is, but it was too late to feel bad because he noticed you and Teddy, waving and calling you over to join him where he was with his two sons, a daughter and his wife. Teddy smiled, slipping his hand in yours and wheeling his trunk behind him as the two of you approached.<br>'Nice to see you again Teddy,\u2019 Harry\u2019s hand moved to ruffle Teddy\u2019s bright blue hair. He grunted and laughed a little before Harry\u2019s attention moved to you. 'Hello again (Y/N), I\u2019m glad you could join us.\u2019<br>'So am I.\u2019<br>\u00a0You could feel the nerves creep in as the curious stares of all three Potter children bore into your back. When Hermione, Ron and their children had approached, five pairs of eyes were on you. You squeezed Teddy\u2019s hand and felt him squeeze back. Knowing he was there was the most reassuring feeling in the world.<br>\u00a0Harry signalled for everyone to follow and you all made your way through crowds of reunited families to a very old looking muggle car. You questioned how in Merlin\u2019s name the group of you would ever fit in there, but the engorgement charm made it nearly big enough for you to move in and use it as an apartment.<br>You and Teddy moved to the back of the car beside the Potter\u2019s middle child Albus. Albus was the most reserved of all of the Potter siblings, he was the only one who wasn\u2019t still ogling you and instead threw you and Teddy a smile as you moved to sit next to him.<br>\u00a0When Harry had decided that everyone was \u201cready to rock and roll,\u201d you set off on your way to the Burrow where Molly and Arthur Weasley lived. More paddocks filled with cows, horses, sheep and the like passed by - albeit slower than they did during the ride back to King\u2019s Cross, but again you felt a familiar type of sleepiness and serenity despite the loud chatter. <br>\u00a0When you\u2019d arrived at the Burrow, you apprehensively grabbed your trunk and caught up to Teddy who was lagging behind Rose, Hugo, Hermione and Ron. The whole house was so\u2026 Homey. It felt more like home than your actual house had.

She looked the same age as you with bright platinum blonde hair and blue eyes. She seemed very refined and smiled politely at you when she noticed you. You could\u2019ve sworn you knew her from somewhere, maybe she was a Hufflepuff too? <br>\u00a0There were a couple of seconds that passed before she realised she hadn\u2019t introduced herself and quickly turned to you, sticking out her hand.<br>\u201cello, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t introduce myself, I\u2019m Victorie, Victorie Weasley.\u2019<br>\u00a0You could immediately pin point her slight accent, she must be Bill and Fleur Delacour\u2019s eldest daughter. Teddy had made sure to let you know who everyone who was going to be there would be and you seemed to be doing pretty good so far. You introduced yourself too and shook hands with her. She smiled and giggled before she turned back to her plate and started working on the roast chicken in front of her.<br>\u00a0Molly had done an incredible job with everything she made, the very smell made your mouth water violently and everything down to the roast carrots was cooked so well she could rival the Hogwarts annual Christmas feast, and that was saying a lot. It seemed that everyone was enjoying the meal just as much as you were, everyone except Teddy.<br>\u00a0Teddy seemed uncomfortable, nudging a roasted potato with the edge of his fork and staring down at it blankly. He was distracted, so much so that when his name was called by Harry who was the head at the opposite end of the table, he didn\u2019t notice. To his credit, it was a fairly long table, but nevertheless, Harry tried to get his attention enough times for it to be concerning. You nudged him softly with your elbow, which made his head snap towards you, eyes widening. You tilted your head in the direction of Harry and Harry asked him how his last few days at Hogwarts were again - for the fourth time.<br>\u00a0Only a few minutes passed of him talking to Harry before he suddenly stood, claiming he wasn\u2019t feeling well and making his way up to the room that had been set up for all of the boys to sleep in. It was going to be incredibly awkward now that you thought about it, you barely knew Albus, Hugo, Lewis, Fred or James - you didn\u2019t really know them well enough to feel comfortable starting a conversation with them, yet alone sharing a room with them.<br>\u00a0You thought about the smell of the apple pie coming from the kitchen, the rich scent of apples and cinnamon was enough to fill your dreams for the next one hundred years, but there were more important things than apple pie and one of those things was Teddy. You excused yourself and thanked Molly for dinner, insisting on cleaning up after yourself and rushing up the stairs to the boys room when you were done. You knocked on the door but there was no response. Just when you were about to knock again, a quiet voice broke the silence.<br>'Who is it?\u2019<br>\u00a0It was enough for you to worry. Teddy sounded upset, more than upset - he sounded the same way he did when he had told you about his parents. The very tone of voice made your stomach lurch. 'It\u2019s (Y/N), can I come in?\u2019<br>\u00a0There was shuffling and a pause before the door was unlocked and Teddy opened it just a crack. He\u2019d definitely been crying, his eyes were red and puffy, as if in the time it took you to get here, he\u2019d sobbed enough for his tear ducts to give up. You felt guilt coarse through you, you should\u2019ve been on your feet as soon as he was. 'Are you alright love?\u2019<br>\u00a0He pulled the door open and let it swing on it\u2019s hinges, closing it behind you as you moved into the room. He said nothing, moving to the opposite side of the room and staring out of the window and into the street bellow it.\u00a0<br>'You know you can talk to me about anything right? You\u2019ve been off for weeks and I just don\u2019t know how much longer I can take it without knowing whats up. I won\u2019t judge you for whatever it is, I promise.\u2019 You coaxed, moving to sit on the end of his bed. Teddy nodded, still avoiding your gaze and watching passing cars go by. A few more minutes passed before he sighed and sat down next to you, head falling onto your shoulder.<br>'Why did you choose to come with me,\u2019 Teddy started, voice scratchy and hoarse. 'You know, instead of spending Christmas with your family.\u2019<br>\u00a0You threw an arm around Teddy\u2019s shoulder and sighed, pushing your cheek into his thick, messy hair. 'Because I love you and I love your family.\u2019 Teddy mumbled something under his breath. 'Sorry handsome I didn\u2019t catch that.\u2019<br>'They\u2019re not my family.\u2019<br>\u00a0You drew away from Teddy to look at him. He didn\u2019t meet your eyes, instead facing the wall his bed was pressed up against. You moved your hands to hold his cheeks. 'What do you mean?\u2019<br>'They\u2019re not my family - not really. I\u2019m just the kid they pity who doesn\u2019t have a real family to spend Christmas with.\u2019<br>\u00a0Teddy choked on a sob and you felt your heart twist violently in your chest. You moved his face so that he was forced to look at you and ran your finger over his cheeks where fresh tears had fallen. 'Teddy, they are your family-\u2019<br>'No they\u2019re not.\u2019<br>'Teddy-\u2019<br>'They aren\u2019t my real family, Harry isn\u2019t my dad - not my real dad and-\u2019<br>'Teddy!\u2019 Teddy paused, eyes darting to yours at your outburst. 'I\u2019m sorry, but they don\u2019t pity you, you are their family. They may not be your parents or cousins by blood, but they care about you and that\u2019s what really matters.\u2019<br>\u00a0You sat in silence. Teddy choked on another sob, tears welling in the corners of his eyes. He stayed like that for a while, crying and leaning into the palm of your hands. It was hard not to cry with him, the whole two years you\u2019d been together - he\u2019d never talked about his parents like this. You realise now that he wasn\u2019t over it, he was just holding it all in.<br>'I just wish I had of m-met them you know, my mum and dad.\u2019<br>\u00a0You nodded, moving to pull him towards your chest, he didn\u2019t fight you, instead nuzzling into you. You moved your hand to sit on the top of his head. 'They were amazing people - you remember, Harry told us about all of the stuff your dad did when he was at Hogwarts? About the map? And your mum, she used to turn into teachers for fun.\u2019 Teddy nodded, snickering slightly though it came out as more of a sniffle. 'You know, they\u2019re proud of you, I\u2019m sure of it. I\u2019m sure they miss you just as much as you miss them.\u2019<br>\u00a0Teddy nodded, hiccuping again as fresh tears spilled. 'Here\u2019s the cheesy part - they\u2019re not really gone. As long as you remember them, they\u2019re never really gone. They\u2019re here in little things like your hair, your eyes and the map. They were brave and strong and you are too Teddy, you are them and they are with you every step of the way - just like I am, just like all of your family is and always will be.\u2019<br>\u00a0Teddy lifted his eyes to meet yours, pulling away from your neck. 'So I guess you\u2019re my family too?\u2019 You nodded, smiling and lifting your hand to brush away tears from his face again. 'That\u2019s weird.\u2019<br>\u00a0Your Teddy was finally coming back. You laughed, punching him softly on the arm. Just as he had collected himself again and practically fallen onto you for cuddles, several Potters, Weasleys and a Granger-Weasley burst into the room, laughing and talking between one and other. James winked at the two of you, Albus smiling softly while Hugo, Lewis and Fred were still caught up in their strange chant that you could hear from here since it had started.<br>\u00a0Teddy smiled fondly at them, they were his family and he hoped that one day you\u2019d become a part of it too - for real.</p>",

I hope you like it.)&nbsp;</i></p><p>Warnings: None</p><p>Word count: 3,150</p><p>&nbsp;The Hufflepuff common room was a comfortable place for all of it&rsquo;s members. Sunlight streamed through circular windows, the air of light chatter and the crackling of logs in the fire made the atmosphere warm and cozy, not to mention the kitchen wasn&rsquo;t far so it was the perfect place to meet up for studies and snacking. The portrait of Helga Hufflepuff above the barrel shaped fireplace smiled at them all as they passed, throwing an occasional wave or concerned &lsquo;are you alright there,&rsquo; when one student was looking particularly stressed or rushed. If you were up too late, seconds away from sleep with your head down in a book, she&rsquo;d wake you and convince you to get to sleep. During the holiday seasons, she would hold her mug of hot butterbeer up to anyone who passed in attempts to get someone to cheers with her.<br />&nbsp;Today was one such holiday or close enough to it (she was currently trying to cheers with a third year that was much too short to reach), there were only three days left of your sixth year and while that terrified you to no end, you knew that you weren&rsquo;t going to be doing your final year at Hogwarts alone.<br />&nbsp;Teddy shifted, attempting to get comfortable on the opposite side of the couch. He had his face down in a book, trying to study for a test that had been sprung on you mere days before your holidays, but he kept eyeing you, something else was on his mind.<br />&nbsp;Strands of turquoise hair fell to block his view and each time it did, he would reach up and move it out of his face. It would stay there for a moment before it would move once again. You watched for a while, finding yourself distracted from your own studies and eventually growing tired of seeing it happen again and again, you reached forward and brushed the hair out of his face for him.<br />He looked up, slightly startled and nervous before murmuring a thank you when you moved away, but his gaze lingered.</p><p>&nbsp;He&rsquo;d been acting kind of strange for a few weeks now so the look he was giving you was nothing new. There was a mix of emotions swarming in his eyes - a kind of fear and melancholy, but he wouldn&rsquo;t tell you what it was about, no matter how many times you tried to pry it out of him.<br />&nbsp;None of your shared friends had managed to get anything out of him either - you even wrote to Harry when he started shutting himself away from everyone but he had no clue as to what could be bothering him either. This was the first time in weeks that he&rsquo;d tried to start a conversation with you.<br />'What&rsquo;s up,&rsquo; you asked, shifting to sit closer to him. You waited, watching to see if you&rsquo;d pushed it too far, but he didn&rsquo;t move away and didn&rsquo;t leave and rather took in a couple of nervous breaths.<br />'Well, my godfather - Harry, you know the one you met last summer holidays? Well, he&rsquo;s invited me to Christmas at the Burrow and well you know how big my family is so it&rsquo;s okay if you say no but if you want to, maybe you&rsquo;d like to come over for the holidays too? My uh&hellip; My cousins are dying to meet you, they won&rsquo;t ever stop asking about when they get to meet my boyfriend.&rsquo;<br />&nbsp;Without hesitation, you nodded and smiled softly, reaching your hand out to hold his. He tensed and his eyes met yours at last before he smiled too.<br />&nbsp;When you&rsquo;d owled your parents and received their response, you knew you&rsquo;d have a hell of a ride trying to buy Christmas presents for everyone in his family. He&rsquo;d insisted you didn&rsquo;t need to buy anyone anything but you had to make a good impression. You used the approaching Hogsmede weekend to gather miscellaneous gifts. You knew his godfather Harry was big on Quidditch and managed to snatch him up a set of tiny Quidditch gear to play tiny Quidditch with, Hermione read more often than she breathed so you looked for some new releases at a book shop, Ron was and still is a giant supporter of the Chudley Cannons, so you found him an entire book of collectable cards that displayed each team&rsquo;s member and their best moves and moments. You weren&rsquo;t sure what Teddy&rsquo;s cousin&rsquo;s and other aunts and uncles would like so you played it safe with different types of treats from Hogsmede and vouchers for various stores in Diagon Alley.<br />&nbsp;On the last day of school, there was a giant goodbye feast for everyone who was leaving for the holidays - plump turkeys and golden roast potatoes, just as they did every year, the house elves had out done themselves. It was the perfect way to end the year, along with your outstanding marks in your end of year &ldquo;preparing you for seventh year&rdquo; test. It was finally over, no more exams until after the Christmas holidays, except Teddy hadn&rsquo;t shown up for it.<br />&nbsp;He&rsquo;d spent most of the day hauled up in the dorm and none of the others entered it. One of the boys had approached you to ask if you could make sure the coast was clear before he got his pyjamas, but you were way ahead of him.<br />&nbsp;Teddy looked as if he had been asleep for hours, ruffled turquoise hair glimmering in the moonlight as he flicked through something, sitting on the edge of his four poster yellow bed with his legs dangling off of it. His head snapped up when he saw your face through a crack in the door but made no move to approach you and rather shut what looked like a photo album and slid it under his bed before you could see it.<br />&nbsp;When you had reassured him that you were here for him and asked what was up, he&rsquo;d told you it was nothing and that he just wasn&rsquo;t feeling well but it didn&rsquo;t seem like the Teddy you knew at all, this wasn&rsquo;t just any dinner this was the end of year feast.<br />&nbsp;The ride back to platform nine and three quarters had been alright, especially once the trolley lady came past and you, Teddy and two other Hufflepuff boys stuffed yourselves with cauldron cakes. The weather was clear and sunny, warm enough to leave the house without a jacket but cold enough to wear long sleeved shirts and as the view passed by as blurs of green, you found yourself falling asleep and remaining that way until Teddy reluctantly shook you awake and the two of you left the train together.<br />&nbsp;Teddy&rsquo;s godfather Harry was incredibly noticeable. He stuck out like a sore thumb, even with the thick steam of the Hogwarts Express shrouding the platform. You felt bad for staring considering he got enough unwanted attention as is, but it was too late to feel bad because he noticed you and Teddy, waving and calling you over to join him where he was with his two sons, a daughter and his wife. Teddy smiled, slipping his hand in yours and wheeling his trunk behind him as the two of you approached.<br />'Nice to see you again Teddy,&rsquo; Harry&rsquo;s hand moved to ruffle Teddy&rsquo;s bright blue hair. He grunted and laughed a little before Harry&rsquo;s attention moved to you. 'Hello again (Y/N), I&rsquo;m glad you could join us.&rsquo;<br />'So am I.&rsquo;<br />&nbsp;You could feel the nerves creep in as the curious stares of all three Potter children bore into your back. When Hermione, Ron and their children had approached, five pairs of eyes were on you. You squeezed Teddy&rsquo;s hand and felt him squeeze back. Knowing he was there was the most reassuring feeling in the world.<br />&nbsp;Harry signalled for everyone to follow and you all made your way through crowds of reunited families to a very old looking muggle car. You questioned how in Merlin&rsquo;s name the group of you would ever fit in there, but the engorgement charm made it nearly big enough for you to move in and use it as an apartment.<br />You and Teddy moved to the back of the car beside the Potter&rsquo;s middle child Albus. Albus was the most reserved of all of the Potter siblings, he was the only one who wasn&rsquo;t still ogling you and instead threw you and Teddy a smile as you moved to sit next to him.<br />&nbsp;When Harry had decided that everyone was &ldquo;ready to rock and roll,&rdquo; you set off on your way to the Burrow where Molly and Arthur Weasley lived. More paddocks filled with cows, horses, sheep and the like passed by - albeit slower than they did during the ride back to King&rsquo;s Cross, but again you felt a familiar type of sleepiness and serenity despite the loud chatter. <br />&nbsp;When you&rsquo;d arrived at the Burrow, you apprehensively grabbed your trunk and caught up to Teddy who was lagging behind Rose, Hugo, Hermione and Ron. The whole house was so&hellip; Homey. It felt more like home than your actual house had. Maybe it was how many lives this house had housed, how much love it had seen or maybe it was the fact that there were so many people inside that it was alive with conversation - the kind of conversation you&rsquo;d expect to hear in a packed theatre.<br />&nbsp;The inside was much bigger than you would&rsquo;ve expected it to have been and when you walked in you were wrapped in the arms of a very excited looking old woman who was moving from person to person with a bright, wide smile that stretched so far beyond her eyes, she looked as if she&rsquo;d just won the lottery. Her embrace wasn&rsquo;t expected but definitely wasn&rsquo;t unappreciated, she was a great hugger.<br />'You must be Teddy&rsquo;s boyfriend,&rsquo; she stepped back, holding your face between her hands. Your eyes darted to Teddy, who&rsquo;s cheeks had grown red. Molly smiled, observing you before she nodded at Teddy. 'You&rsquo;ve found yourself a real handsome one.&rsquo;<br />&nbsp;Teddy seemed to want to scold her when he noticed the frazzled expression on your face but rather his disapproval was muffled by the material of Molly&rsquo;s shirt. She was too busy hugging him to hear him out.<br />&nbsp;Once everyone had been all hugged out and Molly had finished carrying out everything for lunch, you settled down in the seat next to Teddy&rsquo;s with an unfamiliar girl at your side.

You could&rsquo;ve sworn you knew her from somewhere, maybe she was a Hufflepuff too? <br />&nbsp;There were a couple of seconds that passed before she realised she hadn&rsquo;t introduced herself and quickly turned to you, sticking out her hand.<br />&ldquo;ello, I&rsquo;m sorry, I didn&rsquo;t introduce myself, I&rsquo;m Victorie, Victorie Weasley.&rsquo;<br />&nbsp;You could immediately pin point her slight accent, she must be Bill and Fleur Delacour&rsquo;s eldest daughter.
