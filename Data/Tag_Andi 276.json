He deserves his happy ending with the boyfriend he always wanted and I want him to come out to Jonah and his family, or at least his 4 shrink parents and know how much he\u2019s loved.

It\u2019ll also be nice to see more of her friendship with TJ and her support of his\u2019 and Cyrus\u2019 relationship. I also would like for the audience to meet her dad bc she mentions she has one but we\u2019ve never seen him. </p><p>For Jonah, I think it goes without saying that I want him to tell Andi about his panic attacks/that he suffers from anxiety and seek professional help for it. Same as I said for Andi, I want them to stop the whole \u201cwill they? won\u2019t they\u201d with Jandi. I also want us to get background information on his family and dig deeper on his past and for him to find out Cyrus is gay and support him.
