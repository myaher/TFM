Just a little\u2026 absent minded. That\u2019s what he was going to call it. His water bottle would slide out of his bag without him noticing until he got home, or he would get too caught up in some conversation to remember his pencil case on his desk. Never big things, just useful ones. He hoped his soulmate appreciated it, cause he\u2019d lost a number of really nice pens.</p><p>Cyrus had gotten small hints to his soulmate\u2019s personality, little things that showed up in his room or in his bag that <i>certainly</i> didn\u2019t belong to him. When he was younger, sometime in elementary school, he\u2019d freaked out a little when he thought it was Buffy. He loved her, for sure, but he knew they weren\u2019t meant to be together like <i>that</i>. He\u2019d brought the running shoe to school in a panic, shoving it in Buffy\u2019s face as soon as she got there. \u201cYou didn\u2019t happen to lose this, did you? It was in my closet this morning and I <i>know</i> it\u2019s not mine.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t phased. \u201cNo, mine dont look like that. Besides,\u201d she said, wrinkling her nose a little, \u201cthat looks like a boy\u2019s shoe.\u201d</p><p>So. An athletic boy probably. Cyrus could work with that.</p><!-- more --><p>He had tried to \u201caccidentally\u201d misplace the shoe later that day so his soulmate could have it back, but the universe didn\u2019t work quite like that. He always found the shoe right where he left it, and he eventually just gave up and brought it back home. He put it in the wicker basket where he kept all of his soulmate\u2019s things, tucked in the corner of his room by his desk.</p><p>When Cyrus and Jonah had first met, it was really easy for Cyrus to get a little carried away. For as long as he knew that his soulmate was probably an athletic boy, he didn\u2019t really have any guy friends. But Jonah was a boy, and he played ultimate, and he was really cute and nice and Cyrus would have really loved for Jonah to be his soulmate.</p><p>Andi\u2019s soulmate never lost anything that gave her particularly good clues as to who they might be. So it was a little unfair of Cyrus, but he never put a lot of stock into Andi\u2019s crushes. It didn\u2019t really mean anything that she liked Jonah. Not if Cyrus didn\u2019t want it to.</p><p>Buffy was generally pretty tight lipped about her soulmate and whatever crushes she did or didn&rsquo;t have, which gave Cyrus\u2019s imagination a lot of room to work. Cyrus would never tell her for fear of death, but when they first met TJ he thought for a second that he could have been her soulmate. He had told Andi this one day and she made him swear to keep that thought to himself. \u201cShe would have <i>both</i>your heads on a spike. Besides,\u201d she said, turning her nose up slightly, \u201cBuffy deserves better than that jerk.\u201d Cyrus agreed, mostly, but he hadn\u2019t met TJ yet. Once he met TJ though, things were a little different. Cyrus couldn\u2019t explain it. He just <i>knew</i> there was something about TJ that everyone else was missing. He wanted to figure it out.</p><p>Anyways, Buffy was less pressed about analyzing the clues and finding her soulmate at this age. She was always trying to be the voice of reason for Andi and Cyrus, reminding them that things would just happen when they were meant to. That was a completely reasonable and logical approach and it was also <i>way less fun</i>. Why would the universe even bother with all these clues if not to overanalyze them?</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t even a particularly dramatic moment, in reality, when Cyrus learned for sure that he had been a little off base. Jonah had reached into his pocket for something, probably his phone, and came back out with a tube of chapstick instead. Chapstick that Cyrus had certainly never owned and therefore couldn\u2019t have lost. \u201cSoulmate,\u201d Jonah laughed. \u201cThey lose stuff like this all the time.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus laughed along politely but he felt a little crushed inside. It had been reckless to let himself think it could have been Jonah, really, and in the long run it was probably better to find out sooner rather than later. It still sucked.</p><p>He pretended to get a text from his mom so he could go home. \u201cBye Cy-guy!\u201d Jonah said in his usual chipper way, completely unaware of what Cyrus was feeling.</p><p>\u201cSee ya.\u201d He said back numbly and then went home to lie face down on his bed for the rest of the day. He called up Buffy, later, and admitted the whole situation to her despite his embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cIt really felt like I was meant to meet him, you know? Now I just feel like I got way too attached to the idea of having him in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I think the universe gives us people we\u2019re meant to keep who <i>aren\u2019t</i> our soulmates. Like you, me, and Andi. You guys are still friends, Cy. That doesn&rsquo;t have to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I just thought\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>So. Cyrus was never letting himself do that again.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t even that hard to not do it again, once he got over Jonah. He mostly hung out with the same people all the time and he probably would have noticed if it was one of them, he figured.</p><p>Instead, Cyrus chose to spend his time imagining the moment he and his soulmate finally found each other. In his head he was very suave and he could only hope that all of this practice being dramatic and romantic would pay off in reality. Maybe it was for the best he hadn&rsquo;t found his soulmate yet. He probably would have said something dumb.</p><p>Not to say that he completely stopped thinking about who it might be. Every time they were at one of TJ\u2019s games Cyrus would look at all the boys on both teams and decide if he thought it could be any of them. He was <i>not</i> ogling, despite what Buffy and Andi said.</p><p>(Ok, maybe just a little bit of ogling. All he&rsquo;s saying is if the universe wasn&rsquo;t there to pick an athletic boy for him he probably would&rsquo;ve done it himself.)</p><p>In the end he was really there for TJ though, not his teammates. \u201cUnderdog!\u201d TJ said happily as he bounded over after the game. He moved to give Cyrus a hug, but Cyrus was faster than that.</p><p>\u201cUh, no thanks, sweaty basketball guy.\u201d</p><p>TJ gave him an exaggerated pout. \u201cBut I played so well!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich I will reward you for <i>after</i> you\u2019ve showered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold you to that,\u201d TJ said, then noticed Buffy and Andi standing off to the side. \u201cBuffy, Andi,\u201d he gave them a bro nod, \u201cthanks for coming.\u201d</p><p>Once TJ had made his way back to the locker room and plans for a post-game meal at The Spoon had been settled, Buffy gave Cyrus a look. \u201cCareful,\u201d she said, and Cyrus genuinely had no idea what she was talking about. He said as much, and Buffy just raised her eyebrows and shook her head, getting ready to head out. \u201cNevermind. We\u2019ll meet you guys there, yeah?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus knew there was more to TJ than everyone initially thought, but it still surprised him sometimes when TJ would show off an unexpected new layer. A freshly showered TJ was at The Spoon talking animatedly about this book he\u2019d been reading, and book nerd is not something Cyrus ever would have pegged TJ for. The author of the book he had been talking about sounded familiar, too, but Cyrus couldn&rsquo;t place them. He told TJ this and TJ just shrugged. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve probably talked about them before. I love their work, so.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until he got home that day that he realized where he knew the name from. Cyrus\u2019s soulmate had lost a book by that author before! He thought, a little ridiculously, that he was glad TJ and his soulmate would have stuff in common so they could be friends. TJ had become pretty important to Cyrus, so it would suck if he had to play mediator like he used to have to do with TJ and Buffy.</p><p>The next morning got off to an unfortunate start, which is how Cyrus should have known that the universe had shenanigans in store for him that day.</p><p><i>Rats</i> he thought as he rummaged through his bag, realizing his snack had disappeared somehow. As usual, he hoped his soulmate was grateful. They should really thank him when they finally meet. Cyrus only lost stuff that could be useful to anyone. (Except that time he blessed them with a mud soaked shoe, but he liked to pretend that didn\u2019t happen). His soulmate, on the other hand, managed to lose an entire basketball last week. How does one lose a basketball? What was Cyrus even supposed to do with a basketball? He shook his head and headed towards the vending machine to get a replacement snack before his next class.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d TJ said, sliding into his usual seat next to Cyrus right before the bell rang. Cyrus smiled at him and then turned his attention towards their teacher.</p><p>At the end of the period she explained their homework before dismissing the class. TJ gently kicked Cyrus\u2019s shoes. \u201cWant to work on that together after school?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019s legs were not long enough to kick TJ back from where he was sitting. \u201cSure! My house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect! Later, Underdog.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus knew that he and TJ were always the face of focus when they worked together so he anticipated incredible amounts of productivity from the two of them that afternoon.</p><p>&hellip;Okay, so maybe the homework had gotten slightly derailed.</p><p>TJ was sitting on the floor sifting through the drawers in Cyrus\u2019s desk while Cyrus was trying to make increasingly complicated paper airplanes to throw at TJ\u2019s head. \u201cHey,\u201d TJ said, apparently out of drawers, \u201cWhat\u2019s in here?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus looked up to see TJ peeking into the wicker basket. \u201cThat\u2019s where I keep my soulmate\u2019s stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d TJ sat back. \u201cSorry, I should have asked before I looked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t care. Go ahead.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus focused back on his airplane. He gave it a test throw and it turned and went to the side of the room. He got up to get it from the floor.</p><p>\u201cHey, I used to have a pair of shoes just like this! One of them fell out of my bag though and and I could never find it\u2026\u201d TJ trailed off before looking up at Cyrus in stunned silence.</p><p>Cyrus turned to see TJ holding the shoe from his soulmate basket and froze. <i>TJ? It couldn\u2019t be.</i> But then he thought about it. TJ was athletic. TJ was a boy. TJ was an athletic boy that Cyrus had an unexplainable bond with since the moment they met and suddenly it all made sense. He wanted to kick himself for being so caught up on Jonah when he met TJ that he had forgotten to overanalyze such an <i>obvious</i> candidate.</p><p>TJ was sitting on the floor with the shoe still in hand, frozen in place. He was always cute but the doe eyed look of shock was really, <i>really</i> cute.</p><p>Every coherent thought Cyrus had suddenly chose to vacate his head. \u201cUhhh,\u201d he started and then paused, trying to think of something clever to say. TJ was his <i>soulmate</i>. They would remember this moment <i>forever</i>. \u201cYou&rsquo;re welcome,\u201d is what his mouth settled on without consulting his brain.</p><p>That was enough to shake TJ out of his stupor, his eyes lighting up as Cyrus could feel his face heating. He slowly put the shoe down next to him and leaned forward with delight. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, did you just say \u2018You\u2019re welcome?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, no?\u201d Cyrus said, but it was too late. The damage had been done. Cyrus couldn\u2019t believe himself. All that practice and for what?</p><p>TJ was way too amused by the whole thing. He had a big, stupid grin on his face as he said, \u201cI mean you\u2019re great and all but that\u2019s pretty confident to assume I would thank you for the honour of being your soulmate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant!\u201d Cyrus tried to salvage his dignity even though it was long gone and he could tell TJ was just messing with him. \u201cI just meant&ndash; because I lost some pretty good&ndash;\u201d</p><p>TJ shrugged, cutting him off. \u201cI mean, I would though. I think I got pretty lucky.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus warmed at that a little and let the reality of the situation sink in for the first time since he opened his stupid mouth. Soulmates. <i>Soulmates</i>. \u201cTJ, thats\u2026 I did too. Hold on, I want to say something really sappy but I need a minute to think before I speak, apparently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust come here,\u201d TJ said with a laugh and wrapped his arms around Cyrus after he sulked over. Cyrus rested a hand on TJ\u2019s chest and looked up at him, suddenly shy.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d TJ said softly.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said back.</p><p>Cyrus forgot to indulge in all of his cliche love story fantasies like counting TJ\u2019s freckles and looking for the flecks in TJ\u2019s eyes as TJ leaned in. Instead, he let his eyes slip shut as TJ pressed a soft kiss to his lips.</p><p>At school the next morning Cyrus was excitedly telling Andi and Buffy about how magical it all was when TJ himself came over and threw an arm around Cyrus, handing him a muffin. Cyrus looked up at him happily. <i>Forever</i>. The universe decided he gets to have this forever. Cyrus leaned into his side a little. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>TJ couldn&rsquo;t hold back his grin and Cyrus figured that he was having a similar moment. That is, until he looked Cyrus in the eyes with a wink and very deliberately said, \u201cYou&rsquo;re welcome.\u201d Cyrus groaned and buried his head into TJ\u2019s chest. Yup, he did this to himself. He did this to himself and now he was stuck with it <i>forever</i>.</p><p>He was looking forward to it.</p>",

He thought, a little ridiculously, that he was glad TJ and his soulmate would have stuff in common so they could be friends. TJ had become pretty important to Cyrus, so it would suck if he had to play mediator like he used to have to do with TJ and Buffy.</p><p>The next morning got off to an unfortunate start, which is how Cyrus should have known that the universe had shenanigans in store for him that day.</p><p><i>Rats</i> he thought as he rummaged through his bag, realizing his snack had disappeared somehow. As usual, he hoped his soulmate was grateful. They should really thank him when they finally meet. Cyrus only lost stuff that could be useful to anyone. (Except that time he blessed them with a mud soaked shoe, but he liked to pretend that didn\u2019t happen). His soulmate, on the other hand, managed to lose an entire basketball last week. How does one lose a basketball? What was Cyrus even supposed to do with a basketball? He shook his head and headed towards the vending machine to get a replacement snack before his next class.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d TJ said, sliding into his usual seat next to Cyrus right before the bell rang. Cyrus smiled at him and then turned his attention towards their teacher.</p><p>At the end of the period she explained their homework before dismissing the class. TJ gently kicked Cyrus\u2019s shoes. \u201cWant to work on that together after school?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019s legs were not long enough to kick TJ back from where he was sitting. \u201cSure! My house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect! Later, Underdog.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus knew that he and TJ were always the face of focus when they worked together so he anticipated incredible amounts of productivity from the two of them that afternoon.</p><p>\u2026Okay, so maybe the homework had gotten slightly derailed.</p><p>TJ was sitting on the floor sifting through the drawers in Cyrus\u2019s desk while Cyrus was trying to make increasingly complicated paper airplanes to throw at TJ\u2019s head. \u201cHey,\u201d TJ said, apparently out of drawers, \u201cWhat\u2019s in here?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus looked up to see TJ peeking into the wicker basket. \u201cThat\u2019s where I keep my soulmate\u2019s stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d TJ sat back. \u201cSorry, I should have asked before I looked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t care. Go ahead.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus focused back on his airplane. He gave it a test throw and it turned and went to the side of the room. He got up to get it from the floor.</p><p>\u201cHey, I used to have a pair of shoes just like this! One of them fell out of my bag though and and I could never find it\u2026\u201d TJ trailed off before looking up at Cyrus in stunned silence.</p><p>Cyrus turned to see TJ holding the shoe from his soulmate basket and froze. <i>TJ? It couldn\u2019t be.</i> But then he thought about it. TJ was athletic. TJ was a boy. TJ was an athletic boy that Cyrus had an unexplainable bond with since the moment they met and suddenly it all made sense. He wanted to kick himself for being so caught up on Jonah when he met TJ that he had forgotten to overanalyze such an <i>obvious</i> candidate.</p><p>TJ was sitting on the floor with the shoe still in hand, frozen in place. He was always cute but the doe eyed look of shock was really, <i>really</i> cute.</p><p>Every coherent thought Cyrus had suddenly chose to vacate his head. \u201cUhhh,\u201d he started and then paused, trying to think of something clever to say. TJ was his <i>soulmate</i>. They would remember this moment <i>forever</i>. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d is what his mouth settled on without consulting his brain.</p><p>That was enough to shake TJ out of his stupor, his eyes lighting up as Cyrus could feel his face heating. He slowly put the shoe down next to him and leaned forward with delight. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, did you just say \u2018You\u2019re welcome?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, no?\u201d Cyrus said, but it was too late. The damage had been done. Cyrus couldn\u2019t believe himself. All that practice and for what?</p><p>TJ was way too amused by the whole thing. He had a big, stupid grin on his face as he said, \u201cI mean you\u2019re great and all but that\u2019s pretty confident to assume I would thank you for the honour of being your soulmate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant!\u201d Cyrus tried to salvage his dignity even though it was long gone and he could tell TJ was just messing with him. \u201cI just meant\u2013 because I lost some pretty good\u2013\u201d</p><p>TJ shrugged, cutting him off. \u201cI mean, I would though. I think I got pretty lucky.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus warmed at that a little and let the reality of the situation sink in for the first time since he opened his stupid mouth. Soulmates. <i>Soulmates</i>. \u201cTJ, thats\u2026 I did too. Hold on, I want to say something really sappy but I need a minute to think before I speak, apparently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust come here,\u201d TJ said with a laugh and wrapped his arms around Cyrus after he sulked over. Cyrus rested a hand on TJ\u2019s chest and looked up at him, suddenly shy.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d TJ said softly.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said back.</p><p>Cyrus forgot to indulge in all of his cliche love story fantasies like counting TJ\u2019s freckles and looking for the flecks in TJ\u2019s eyes as TJ leaned in. Instead, he let his eyes slip shut as TJ pressed a soft kiss to his lips.</p><p>At school the next morning Cyrus was excitedly telling Andi and Buffy about how magical it all was when TJ himself came over and threw an arm around Cyrus, handing him a muffin. Cyrus looked up at him happily. <i>Forever</i>. The universe decided he gets to have this forever. Cyrus leaned into his side a little. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>TJ couldn\u2019t hold back his grin and Cyrus figured that he was having a similar moment. That is, until he looked Cyrus in the eyes with a wink and very deliberately said, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Cyrus groaned and buried his head into TJ\u2019s chest. Yup, he did this to himself. He did this to himself and now he was stuck with it <i>forever</i>.</p><p>He was looking forward to it.</p>",

Just a little\u2026 absent minded. That\u2019s what he was going to call it. His water bottle would slide out of his bag without him noticing until he got home, or he would get too caught up in some conversation to remember his pencil case on his desk. Never big things, just useful ones. He hoped his soulmate appreciated it, cause he\u2019d lost a number of really nice pens.</p><p>Cyrus had gotten small hints to his soulmate\u2019s personality, little things that showed up in his room or in his bag that <i>certainly</i> didn\u2019t belong to him. When he was younger, sometime in elementary school, he\u2019d freaked out a little when he thought it was Buffy. He loved her, for sure, but he knew they weren\u2019t meant to be together like <i>that</i>. He\u2019d brought the running shoe to school in a panic, shoving it in Buffy\u2019s face as soon as she got there. \u201cYou didn\u2019t happen to lose this, did you? It was in my closet this morning and I <i>know</i> it\u2019s not mine.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t phased. \u201cNo, mine dont look like that. Besides,\u201d she said, wrinkling her nose a little, \u201cthat looks like a boy\u2019s shoe.\u201d</p><p>So. An athletic boy probably. Cyrus could work with that.</p>[[MORE]]<p>He had tried to \u201caccidentally\u201d misplace the shoe later that day so his soulmate could have it back, but the universe didn\u2019t work quite like that. He always found the shoe right where he left it, and he eventually just gave up and brought it back home. He put it in the wicker basket where he kept all of his soulmate\u2019s things, tucked in the corner of his room by his desk.</p><p>When Cyrus and Jonah had first met, it was really easy for Cyrus to get a little carried away. For as long as he knew that his soulmate was probably an athletic boy, he didn\u2019t really have any guy friends. But Jonah was a boy, and he played ultimate, and he was really cute and nice and Cyrus would have really loved for Jonah to be his soulmate.</p><p>Andi\u2019s soulmate never lost anything that gave her particularly good clues as to who they might be. So it was a little unfair of Cyrus, but he never put a lot of stock into Andi\u2019s crushes. It didn\u2019t really mean anything that she liked Jonah. Not if Cyrus didn\u2019t want it to.</p><p>Buffy was generally pretty tight lipped about her soulmate and whatever crushes she did or didn\u2019t have, which gave Cyrus\u2019s imagination a lot of room to work. Cyrus would never tell her for fear of death, but when they first met TJ he thought for a second that he could have been her soulmate. He had told Andi this one day and she made him swear to keep that thought to himself. \u201cShe would have <i>both</i>your heads on a spike. Besides,\u201d she said, turning her nose up slightly, \u201cBuffy deserves better than that jerk.\u201d Cyrus agreed, mostly, but he hadn\u2019t met TJ yet. Once he met TJ though, things were a little different. Cyrus couldn\u2019t explain it. He just <i>knew</i> there was something about TJ that everyone else was missing. He wanted to figure it out.</p><p>Anyways, Buffy was less pressed about analyzing the clues and finding her soulmate at this age. She was always trying to be the voice of reason for Andi and Cyrus, reminding them that things would just happen when they were meant to. That was a completely reasonable and logical approach and it was also <i>way less fun</i>. Why would the universe even bother with all these clues if not to overanalyze them?</p><p>It wasn\u2019t even a particularly dramatic moment, in reality, when Cyrus learned for sure that he had been a little off base. Jonah had reached into his pocket for something, probably his phone, and came back out with a tube of chapstick instead. Chapstick that Cyrus had certainly never owned and therefore couldn\u2019t have lost. \u201cSoulmate,\u201d Jonah laughed. \u201cThey lose stuff like this all the time.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus laughed along politely but he felt a little crushed inside. It had been reckless to let himself think it could have been Jonah, really, and in the long run it was probably better to find out sooner rather than later. It still sucked.</p><p>He pretended to get a text from his mom so he could go home. \u201cBye Cy-guy!\u201d Jonah said in his usual chipper way, completely unaware of what Cyrus was feeling.</p><p>\u201cSee ya.\u201d He said back numbly and then went home to lie face down on his bed for the rest of the day. He called up Buffy, later, and admitted the whole situation to her despite his embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cIt really felt like I was meant to meet him, you know? Now I just feel like I got way too attached to the idea of having him in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I think the universe gives us people we\u2019re meant to keep who <i>aren\u2019t</i> our soulmates. Like you, me, and Andi. You guys are still friends, Cy. That doesn\u2019t have to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I just thought\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>So. Cyrus was never letting himself do that again.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t even that hard to not do it again, once he got over Jonah. He mostly hung out with the same people all the time and he probably would have noticed if it was one of them, he figured.</p><p>Instead, Cyrus chose to spend his time imagining the moment he and his soulmate finally found each other. In his head he was very suave and he could only hope that all of this practice being dramatic and romantic would pay off in reality. Maybe it was for the best he hadn\u2019t found his soulmate yet. He probably would have said something dumb.</p><p>Not to say that he completely stopped thinking about who it might be. Every time they were at one of TJ\u2019s games Cyrus would look at all the boys on both teams and decide if he thought it could be any of them. He was <i>not</i> ogling, despite what Buffy and Andi said.</p><p>(Ok, maybe just a little bit of ogling. All he\u2019s saying is if the universe wasn\u2019t there to pick an athletic boy for him he probably would\u2019ve done it himself.)</p><p>In the end he was really there for TJ though, not his teammates. \u201cUnderdog!\u201d TJ said happily as he bounded over after the game. He moved to give Cyrus a hug, but Cyrus was faster than that.</p><p>\u201cUh, no thanks, sweaty basketball guy.\u201d</p><p>TJ gave him an exaggerated pout. \u201cBut I played so well!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich I will reward you for <i>after</i> you\u2019ve showered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold you to that,\u201d TJ said, then noticed Buffy and Andi standing off to the side. \u201cBuffy, Andi,\u201d he gave them a bro nod, \u201cthanks for coming.\u201d</p><p>Once TJ had made his way back to the locker room and plans for a post-game meal at The Spoon had been settled, Buffy gave Cyrus a look. \u201cCareful,\u201d she said, and Cyrus genuinely had no idea what she was talking about. He said as much, and Buffy just raised her eyebrows and shook her head, getting ready to head out. \u201cNevermind. We\u2019ll meet you guys there, yeah?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus knew there was more to TJ than everyone initially thought, but it still surprised him sometimes when TJ would show off an unexpected new layer. A freshly showered TJ was at The Spoon talking animatedly about this book he\u2019d been reading, and book nerd is not something Cyrus ever would have pegged TJ for. The author of the book he had been talking about sounded familiar, too, but Cyrus couldn\u2019t place them. He told TJ this and TJ just shrugged. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve probably talked about them before. I love their work, so.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until he got home that day that he realized where he knew the name from. Cyrus\u2019s soulmate had lost a book by that author before! He thought, a little ridiculously, that he was glad TJ and his soulmate would have stuff in common so they could be friends.

So it was a little unfair of Cyrus, but he never put a lot of stock into Andi&rsquo;s crushes. It didn&rsquo;t really mean anything that she liked Jonah. Not if Cyrus didn&rsquo;t want it to.</p><p>Buffy was generally pretty tight lipped about her soulmate and whatever crushes she did or didn&rsquo;t have, which gave Cyrus&rsquo;s imagination a lot of room to work. Cyrus would never tell her for fear of death, but when they first met TJ he thought for a second that he could have been her soulmate. He had told Andi this one day and she made him swear to keep that thought to himself. &ldquo;She would have <i>both</i>your heads on a spike. Besides,&rdquo; she said, turning her nose up slightly, &ldquo;Buffy deserves better than that jerk.&rdquo; Cyrus agreed, mostly, but he hadn&rsquo;t met TJ yet. Once he met TJ though, things were a little different. Cyrus couldn&rsquo;t explain it. He just <i>knew</i> there was something about TJ that everyone else was missing. He wanted to figure it out.</p><p>Anyways, Buffy was less pressed about analyzing the clues and finding her soulmate at this age. She was always trying to be the voice of reason for Andi and Cyrus, reminding them that things would just happen when they were meant to. That was a completely reasonable and logical approach and it was also <i>way less fun</i>. Why would the universe even bother with all these clues if not to overanalyze them?</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t even a particularly dramatic moment, in reality, when Cyrus learned for sure that he had been a little off base. Jonah had reached into his pocket for something, probably his phone, and came back out with a tube of chapstick instead. Chapstick that Cyrus had certainly never owned and therefore couldn&rsquo;t have lost. &ldquo;Soulmate,&rdquo; Jonah laughed. &ldquo;They lose stuff like this all the time.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus laughed along politely but he felt a little crushed inside. It had been reckless to let himself think it could have been Jonah, really, and in the long run it was probably better to find out sooner rather than later. It still sucked.</p><p>He pretended to get a text from his mom so he could go home. &ldquo;Bye Cy-guy!&rdquo; Jonah said in his usual chipper way, completely unaware of what Cyrus was feeling.</p><p>&ldquo;See ya.&rdquo; He said back numbly and then went home to lie face down on his bed for the rest of the day. He called up Buffy, later, and admitted the whole situation to her despite his embarrassment.</p><p>&ldquo;It really felt like I was meant to meet him, you know? Now I just feel like I got way too attached to the idea of having him in my life.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes I think the universe gives us people we&rsquo;re meant to keep who <i>aren&rsquo;t</i> our soulmates. Like you, me, and Andi. You guys are still friends, Cy. That doesn&rsquo;t have to change.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know. I just thought&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><p>So. Cyrus was never letting himself do that again.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t even that hard to not do it again, once he got over Jonah. He mostly hung out with the same people all the time and he probably would have noticed if it was one of them, he figured.</p><p>Instead, Cyrus chose to spend his time imagining the moment he and his soulmate finally found each other. In his head he was very suave and he could only hope that all of this practice being dramatic and romantic would pay off in reality. Maybe it was for the best he hadn&rsquo;t found his soulmate yet. He probably would have said something dumb.</p><p>Not to say that he completely stopped thinking about who it might be. Every time they were at one of TJ&rsquo;s games Cyrus would look at all the boys on both teams and decide if he thought it could be any of them. He was <i>not</i> ogling, despite what Buffy and Andi said.</p><p>(Ok, maybe just a little bit of ogling. All he&rsquo;s saying is if the universe wasn&rsquo;t there to pick an athletic boy for him he probably would&rsquo;ve done it himself.)</p><p>In the end he was really there for TJ though, not his teammates. &ldquo;Underdog!&rdquo; TJ said happily as he bounded over after the game. He moved to give Cyrus a hug, but Cyrus was faster than that.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, no thanks, sweaty basketball guy.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ gave him an exaggerated pout. &ldquo;But I played so well!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which I will reward you for <i>after</i> you&rsquo;ve showered.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold you to that,&rdquo; TJ said, then noticed Buffy and Andi standing off to the side. &ldquo;Buffy, Andi,&rdquo; he gave them a bro nod, &ldquo;thanks for coming.&rdquo;</p><p>Once TJ had made his way back to the locker room and plans for a post-game meal at The Spoon had been settled, Buffy gave Cyrus a look. &ldquo;Careful,&rdquo; she said, and Cyrus genuinely had no idea what she was talking about. He said as much, and Buffy just raised her eyebrows and shook her head, getting ready to head out. &ldquo;Nevermind. We&rsquo;ll meet you guys there, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus knew there was more to TJ than everyone initially thought, but it still surprised him sometimes when TJ would show off an unexpected new layer. A freshly showered TJ was at The Spoon talking animatedly about this book he&rsquo;d been reading, and book nerd is not something Cyrus ever would have pegged TJ for. The author of the book he had been talking about sounded familiar, too, but Cyrus couldn&rsquo;t place them. He told TJ this and TJ just shrugged. &ldquo;I mean, I&rsquo;ve probably talked about them before. I love their work, so.&rdquo;</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t until he got home that day that he realized where he knew the name from. Cyrus&rsquo;s soulmate had lost a book by that author before! He thought, a little ridiculously, that he was glad TJ and his soulmate would have stuff in common so they could be friends. TJ had become pretty important to Cyrus, so it would suck if he had to play mediator like he used to have to do with TJ and Buffy.</p><p>The next morning got off to an unfortunate start, which is how Cyrus should have known that the universe had shenanigans in store for him that day.</p><p><i>Rats</i> he thought as he rummaged through his bag, realizing his snack had disappeared somehow. As usual, he hoped his soulmate was grateful. They should really thank him when they finally meet. Cyrus only lost stuff that could be useful to anyone. (Except that time he blessed them with a mud soaked shoe, but he liked to pretend that didn&rsquo;t happen). His soulmate, on the other hand, managed to lose an entire basketball last week. How does one lose a basketball? What was Cyrus even supposed to do with a basketball? He shook his head and headed towards the vending machine to get a replacement snack before his next class.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; TJ said, sliding into his usual seat next to Cyrus right before the bell rang. Cyrus smiled at him and then turned his attention towards their teacher.</p><p>At the end of the period she explained their homework before dismissing the class. TJ gently kicked Cyrus&rsquo;s shoes. &ldquo;Want to work on that together after school?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus&rsquo;s legs were not long enough to kick TJ back from where he was sitting. &ldquo;Sure! My house?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perfect! Later, Underdog.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus knew that he and TJ were always the face of focus when they worked together so he anticipated incredible amounts of productivity from the two of them that afternoon.</p><p>&hellip;Okay, so maybe the homework had gotten slightly derailed.</p><p>TJ was sitting on the floor sifting through the drawers in Cyrus&rsquo;s desk while Cyrus was trying to make increasingly complicated paper airplanes to throw at TJ&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; TJ said, apparently out of drawers, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in here?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus looked up to see TJ peeking into the wicker basket. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I keep my soulmate&rsquo;s stuff.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; TJ sat back. &ldquo;Sorry, I should have asked before I looked.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t care. Go ahead.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus focused back on his airplane. He gave it a test throw and it turned and went to the side of the room. He got up to get it from the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, I used to have a pair of shoes just like this! One of them fell out of my bag though and and I could never find it&hellip;&rdquo; TJ trailed off before looking up at Cyrus in stunned silence.</p><p>Cyrus turned to see TJ holding the shoe from his soulmate basket and froze. <i>TJ? It couldn&rsquo;t be.</i> But then he thought about it. TJ was athletic. TJ was a boy. TJ was an athletic boy that Cyrus had an unexplainable bond with since the moment they met and suddenly it all made sense. He wanted to kick himself for being so caught up on Jonah when he met TJ that he had forgotten to overanalyze such an <i>obvious</i> candidate.</p><p>TJ was sitting on the floor with the shoe still in hand, frozen in place. He was always cute but the doe eyed look of shock was really, <i>really</i> cute.</p><p>Every coherent thought Cyrus had suddenly chose to vacate his head. &ldquo;Uhhh,&rdquo; he started and then paused, trying to think of something clever to say. TJ was his <i>soulmate</i>. They would remember this moment <i>forever</i>. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome,&rdquo; is what his mouth settled on without consulting his brain.</p><p>That was enough to shake TJ out of his stupor, his eyes lighting up as Cyrus could feel his face heating. He slowly put the shoe down next to him and leaned forward with delight. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, did you just say &lsquo;You&rsquo;re welcome?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um, no?&rdquo; Cyrus said, but it was too late. The damage had been done. Cyrus couldn&rsquo;t believe himself. All that practice and for what?</p><p>TJ was way too amused by the whole thing. He had a big, stupid grin on his face as he said, &ldquo;I mean you&rsquo;re great and all but that&rsquo;s pretty confident to assume I would thank you for the honour of being your soulmate.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I meant!&rdquo; Cyrus tried to salvage his dignity even though it was long gone and he could tell TJ was just messing with him. &ldquo;I just meant&ndash; because I lost some pretty good&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>TJ shrugged, cutting him off. &ldquo;I mean, I would though. I think I got pretty lucky.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus warmed at that a little and let the reality of the situation sink in for the first time since he opened his stupid mouth. Soulmates. <i>Soulmates</i>. &ldquo;TJ, thats&hellip; I did too. Hold on, I want to say something really sappy but I need a minute to think before I speak, apparently.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just come here,&rdquo; TJ said with a laugh and wrapped his arms around Cyrus after he sulked over. Cyrus rested a hand on TJ&rsquo;s chest and looked up at him, suddenly shy.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; TJ said softly.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; he said back.</p><p>Cyrus forgot to indulge in all of his cliche love story fantasies like counting TJ&rsquo;s freckles and looking for the flecks in TJ&rsquo;s eyes as TJ leaned in. Instead, he let his eyes slip shut as TJ pressed a soft kiss to his lips.</p><p>At school the next morning Cyrus was excitedly telling Andi and Buffy about how magical it all was when TJ himself came over and threw an arm around Cyrus, handing him a muffin. Cyrus looked up at him happily. <i>Forever</i>. The universe decided he gets to have this forever. Cyrus leaned into his side a little. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ couldn&rsquo;t hold back his grin and Cyrus figured that he was having a similar moment. That is, until he looked Cyrus in the eyes with a wink and very deliberately said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome.&rdquo; Cyrus groaned and buried his head into TJ&rsquo;s chest. Yup, he did this to himself. He did this to himself and now he was stuck with it <i>forever</i>.</p><p>He was looking forward to it.</p>",

He loved her, for sure, but he knew they weren&rsquo;t meant to be together like <i>that</i>.

in the mirror pivoting around the over cluttered room, the reflection stared back, he ran his fingers through his chestnut brown hair he cut almost all of his hair length it was liberating to have his stupid long hair be cut off to just have hair that didnt make him look feminine so he cut till his bangs barely reached his forehead, he looked in the mirror one more time frustrated with the fact that he used to be flatter than his mom ironing board but it was official the universe hated him after all it decided the one time Marty thought he could pass in the physical aspect after his new haircut, he suddenly sprouted to a C-cup,he hated them, loathed them, because while he could paint over the pink walls in his bedroom, he could chop all his hair till he was bald, but he couldn&rsquo;t paint over his breasts and make them vanish, how he wish he could make them vanish.</p><p>They remind him that as long as he had breasts he be seen as a girl, he wished he could just cut them off, but he knew it was too dangerous to do it without a professional and his mom would probably freak out if there was blood on the carpet.</p><p>\u201cMarissa\u201da knock came from Marty

bedroom before returning with three bras, she shoved them into Marty hands</p><p>\u201cHere\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanks\u201d  Marty waltezd back into his

little better, he wasn&rsquo;t as flat as he wanted to be but it was as close to flat as he could get, he slipped on several tops ranging from different fabrics, to different patterns due to his mom obsessive addiction to shopping for the color pink and dresses he didn&rsquo;t have many T-shirt that were plain and pants but luckily there was online shopping he couldn&rsquo;t buy too obvious boy clothes or his mom would freak so non -gender clothing it was. </p><p>Marty couldn\u2019t wait for the day till his mom finally decided that she wouldn\u2019t care whatever he bought, but that was far away way too far away, he slipped on a oversized yellow hoodie, and his old gym shorts and feeling his stomach rumble he ran downstairs dashing by his sister and grabbing a hot waffle and throwing it on to his plate,he drowned it in syrup before he stuffed it in his mouth, scooping eggs on to his plate.</p><p>He sat down letting his body stopped running, it was complete silence till his mom spoke then came another few seconds of tension that Marty couldnt take so quietly he mumbled </p><p>\u201cBye mom\u201d Marty dashed out of the house letting the cool summer breeze hit him, his brown hair was flying over the place as he ran to wherever letting his heels hit the concrete and his eyes running in circles he didn&rsquo;t know what stopped him, but he suddenly stopped running, he stood out of breath hunched over the gray concrete.</p><p>He looked around, to see an array of blue and pink flowers sprouting out of the cracks in the concrete, cling he whipped his head around to see a giant of a boy with the most luscious blonde hair darkened by beads of sweat, with green eyes staring intensely at the worn out metal rim of the Shadyside basketball court, the boy was throwing shot after shot, missing a few times and every time he missed he tightened his face he probably wouldn\u2019t have noticed Marty if his next throw flew of the rim and almost hit Marty who yelped out of the way and fell to the ground.</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m so sorry, Dude are you alright\u201d the blonde boy rushed to Marty side and offered his hand.</p><p>\u201cI think there three of you\u201d Marty pretend to be dazed gleaming on the inside, the boy looked worried for a minute before Marty bursted out laughing</p><p>\u201cIm fine, just pulling your leg a little\u201d the boy sighed in relief. </p><p>\u201cThank goodness I don&rsquo;t think I could have afforded your hospital bill\u2026\u201d he looked to Marty for confirmation of his name</p><p>\u201cuh im ..\u201d Marty thought for a second realising the boy was talking to him, Marty wasn&rsquo;t used to someone in Shadyside not knowing his name, did he really look that different? He didn&rsquo;t think so, \u201cMarty\u201d he whispered quietly letting the wind carry his voice then the boy smiled again</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you Marty\u201d the boy smiled he pulled Marty up and Marty felt himself wishing he could hold on to the blonde guys hand a little bit more \u201cIm TJ\u201d </p><p>Uh Hi TJ\u201d Marty voiced cracked as he tried to deepen it, TJ gave him a strange look \u201cNext time you throw a basketball at me, can we avoid the face area\u201d Marty chuckled, TJ bellowed in laughter </p><p>\u201cSure Handsome\u201d  TJ shot a wink towards him, Marty face blushed.</p><p>\u201cSo Marty up for a one on one\u201d Marty nodded and smirked as he grabbed the ball from TJ hands. </p><p>AN: Thank You <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0rAyvo5XO6-hTPESIXa8hA\">@citrusgoodman</a> for providing me with correct information about Dysphoria, Binding etc I cant thank you enough</p><p>(If i innacuratly potrayed dyshorphi then i apologising pls send asks or dm me about what i did wrong so i can fix it)</p><p>Tag: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/melLkuv8Q4JOJp2K-vknvQQ\">@3eyyyem</a> sorry for making you wait exams were killing me</p>",

It depends on how Disney decides to promote the final episodes + their summer schedule. I think there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019ll get a \u201cnew episodes of all your favorite shows!\u201d trailer that will include a few seconds of Andi Mack footage (as well as Raven\u2019s Home, Bunk\u2019d, Sydney to the Max, and Just Roll With It). But I also think there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019ll get \u201cthe final episodes\u201d trailer for Andi Mack which would include clips from the next 3 episodes for sure, but maybe even more. But those are just my personal theories so pls don\u2019t take them as fact. They could just drop a normal ass trailer a week before the episode drops and I wouldn\u2019t be shocked at all.\u00a0<br/></p>",
