In order to have a scenario in which Jon was acclaimed king, the rebel coalition would have had to 1) accept that Rhaegar and Lyanna had been legitimately married (which is still not a certainty, and would definitely not be accepted by the southron ambitions alliance which had arranged and supported a Lyanna-Robert betrothal - as well as, more broadly, any noble family not eager to have its affianced daughters seized at a prince\u2019s pleasure) AND 2) accept that Rhaegar had any right to the throne which he could then pass to Jon (which, again, sort of undermines the entire reason the rebel coalition was fighting, particularly at that point). It would be simply ludicrous to believe that the rebel coalition would choose to acclaim Jon over the still-very-much-alive Stannis.</p><p>Of course, the bigger question is whether Lyanna would have even <i>wanted </i>to see Jon made king and herself made his regent. For her sake, I certainly hope that by the time Jon was born, Lyanna had fallen out of love with Rhaegar and realized <a href=\"http://goodqueenaly.tumblr.com/post/172457095163/so-a-big-reason-why-lyanna-didnt-want-to-marry\">how incredibly horrible he had been in forcing this relationship</a>.
