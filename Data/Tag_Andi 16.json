        "body": "<p><b>Summary: \u00a0</b><i>\u201cAll felt like they knew the others were far away, living ideal lives. They kept to their windows and phones for the ride, thinking about the others. They reminisced separately but prayed for the night to go by fast, to get to the places they needed to go.<br/>But the night hadn\u2019t even begun yet.\u201d<br/>High school ended 6 years ago, and with it, so did the friendship between Andi, Buffy, Cyrus, Jonah, TJ and Amber.<br/>But now their flight is delayed and they are stuck in a hotel together for the night. Not much can change in one night, though.<br/>Can it?</i></p><p><i><b>ALL LINKS IN REBLOG</b></i></p><p>~~~~~~~~~</p><!-- more --><p>The bus pulled up to the hotel, the sun well below the horizon by now. Andi pulled out one of her earphones at the sudden halt, peering forward where the conductor was asking them to \u2018exit in an orderly fashion and go to the lobby\u2019. She sighed, moving to get up, throwing her duffel bag over her shoulder. She trudged out of the bus with the other unfortunate people who were stuck there that night. When they entered the hotel, they were all directed to this seating area, charitably called a \u2018lobby\u2019, where they had to wait while rooms were arranged for them.</p><p>Andi huffed, letting the reassurances of \u2018We will have it under control soon,\u2019 and \u2018We will handle everything,\u2019 slide over her. She sank into a chair near a plug point, pushing in her phone charger and breathing a quiet sigh of relief when the screen lit up. As she scrolled through her phone, checking her posts, she landed on a picture of her in high school, scrolling by as fast as she could. She couldn\u2019t afford to look back at that part of her life, to look back and miss the perfect days when her life was in shambles around her. She would much rather forget those days rather than keep living with the fact that if only\u2026</p><p>See, that\u2019s why. Just forget it and scroll ahead.</p><p>Andi sighed and glanced up towards the buffet being laid out for the passengers in the hotel, looking back down. But something made her do a double take. Or rather someone.</p><p>By the tables, a tall girl was pacing and talking on the phone, occasionally rolling her eyes but laughing. Her curly hair was up in a bun on her head, and she was wearing a sports hoodie and sneakers. She looked older than before, obviously, but there was no mistaking who it was.</p><p>Andi felt her throat go dry, her mind racing at the speed of light, trying to process the fact that this was real. That it was really her.</p><p>Buffy Driscoll. One of Andi\u2019s best friends since 2<sup>nd</sup> Grade till High School. A fellow member of the Good Hair Crew. One of her perfect friends.</p><p>Andi didn\u2019t really feel herself get up, didn\u2019t realise she was walking across the lobby until she was just behind Buffy, who was just putting down the phone. Andi shakily drew a deep breath, unexpectedly nervous. Finally, she reached out and tapped Buffy on the shoulder with her finger.</p><p>\u201cFancy seeing you here,\u201d she said, causing Buffy to turn around quickly, her eyes wide. It took a minute for her to take in Andi\u2019s appearance, before her face broke into a huge smile. Buffy squealed and pulled Andi into a bone-crushing hug. Andi felt herself smile too, wrapping her arms around Buffy as tight as she could. They spent what felt like forever just clinging onto each other, the surroundings feeling dull in comparison. Eventually, Buffy pulled herself away from Andi, her eyes filled up slightly.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, it feels like forever!\u201d she said, grabbing Andi\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYou look so different! Good different of course,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd your hair! I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen it this length!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I underwent a real style transformation,\u201d Andi said, flipping her hair forward. \u201cBut look at you, still rocking those sports clothes, I see.\u201d</p><p>Buffy laughed slightly, looking down. \u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t go too much for travel outfits. Comfort over looks any day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a dig at my outfit? I have an aesthetic to keep up, you know.\u201d</p><p>Buffy rolled her eyes. \u201cWhat is that? Badass biker?\u201d</p><p>Andi\u2019s smiled dropped a bit, her walls being pushed against. \u201cClose, but no.\u201d</p><p>After the initial excitement and happiness, the awkward tension grew in between them, Buffy sensing Andi\u2019s change in manner. Both were unsure of what else to say. They glanced back at the other, giving an awkward smile but looking away. This never used to happen to them back in school, but here they were, the silence between them growing. Andi looked down, catching sight of Buffy\u2019s hand, where sat a silver ring. She gasped, grabbing her hand.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, is that what I think it is?\u201d she said, the smile on her face coming back.</p><p>Buffy tried to hide her excited smile but to no avail. She held up her hand, showing the ring. \u201cIt may be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, who is it?\u201d Andi asked teasingly.</p><p>Buffy\u2019s smile softened, her eyes fond. \u201cIt\u2019s Marty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Andi said, her words just louder than a whisper. \u201cAfter all this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe met again last time I was in Shadyside, and it just felt right? With him, it always has,\u201d Buffy said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy for you, Buffy. I really am,\u201d Andi said, clasping her hand.</p><p>Buffy sighed, sniffing a bit. She pushed Andi\u2019s shoulder slightly, an unusual gesture but not unwelcome. \u201cWhat about you? How\u2019s that front of your life?\u201d</p><p>Almost instantly, it felt as if all the air had been sucked out of Andi\u2019s lungs. She just kept looking at Buffy, her mind drawing a blank.</p><p>Actually, there was no blank. There were thoughts circulating, but all of them were\u2026 unpleasant. As her mind kept supplying thoughts, she grew more and more frustrated. She tried desperately to internalise it, to throw it behind the walls she had spent months building. Buffy was staring at her in confusion, as Andi tried to find the words to say, but all that came out was silence.</p><p>Say something, anything. For fuck\u2019s sake, she\u2019s looking at you like you\u2019re insane.</p><p>But thankfully, before she had to say anything or explain herself, a welcome distraction came in the form of a voice calling from behind them.</p><p>\u201cAndi? Buffy?\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Cyrus had just been heading to the buffet to try and find something to eat, seeing that he hadn\u2019t eaten for a good couple hours. He noticed the girl from the airport standing there talking to another girl, the other in a sports hoodie. They had been talking and hugging as if they had been reunited after years. As he caught a glimpse of her, he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that he knew her. Cyrus pinched the bridge of his nose, his headache still not gone, as he wracked his brain trying to figure out who it could be. He looked back at the two girls, hoping that another glance might help him place her. It didn\u2019t help much, he still couldn\u2019t figure out how he knew her. But then he saw the other girl, smiling but her eyebrows furrowed in concern. And that expression made Cyrus feel as if his mind had fallen down a wormhole.</p><p>He had seen that expression before. It had been directed at him before by only one person.</p><p>That meant\u2026</p><p>\u201cAndi? Buffy?\u201d Cyrus called out in utter disbelief. The suitcase he had been dragging along beside him was suddenly forgotten as he walked forward in a daze toward the two girls. They both turned to look at him in shock. And when Cyrus finally got a good look at them he knew he was right.</p><p>Andi Mack and Buffy Driscoll.</p><p>\u201cCyrus?!\u201d the both of them said, with shocked smiles on their faces. That was all Cyrus needed to run forward and envelope the two in a group hug. Or, at least try to. He accidentally collided into Andi\u2019s side, pushing the two and nearly toppling them over. The three laughed awkwardly for a bit, before all going into a hug. Cyrus held his two best friends as tight as he could, a part of him convinced that if he didn\u2019t, he would wake up from what clearly had to be a dream.</p><p>\u201cWhat are the odds of all three of us bumping into each other here?\u201d Buffy said after the three pulled away.</p><p>Cyrus shook his head, still stunned. \u201cOf all the places we could meet,\u201d he said, stepping back.</p><p>\u201cThis is by far the craziest thing to happen to me,\u201d Andi said, her smile wide.</p><p>The three laughed, Cyrus going back for a moment to get his suitcase from where it was about to become a tripping hazard. When he got back, he finally noticed Buffy\u2019s left hand, doing a double take.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d he said, grabbing her hand, eliciting a chuckle from Buffy. \u201cWhen did this happen? Who is it? How??\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike 3 months ago,\u201d Buffy said, shrugging. \u201cFunny thing is Marty and I both asked each other just while we were sitting on the couch watching movies. Just like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course that\u2019s how the proposal went down,\u201d Andi said, facepalming.</p><p>\u201cWait. Marty? From school?\u201d Cyrus asked.</p><p>Buffy nodded, looking down at her shoes. \u201cEveryone else I dated after high school was amazing, but I don\u2019t know. I really liked them all, but for some reason, they never lasted. How ever long we went out. Then, a couple years ago, I met Marty in Shadyside while visiting and we started talking again. And I just knew,\u201d she said softly. Hearing her talk couldn\u2019t help but make Andi and Cyrus give each other a look, knowing exactly what the other one was thinking. God, he had missed this.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re really happy for you Buffy,\u201d Andi said, reaching forward to squeeze Buffy\u2019s shoulder. Cyrus nodded his head with a smile.</p><p>\u201cThanks guys,\u201d Buffy said, going in to hug the two. \u201cGod, I never realised how much I missed you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, it\u2019s been forever,\u201d Cyrus said. \u201cLast I met Andi was 4 years ago and I met Buffy five years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too long, it should be illegal for us to be apart that long,\u201d Andi said, pulling away first. Cyrus sighed in agreement.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess one good thing came out of this flight being delayed,\u201d Cyrus said with a small laugh.</p><p>The three stood in relative silence, unsure of what to say now that the initial high of reuniting had faded, and all three were painfully reminded that none of them were the people who had left high school 6 years ago.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s been up with you guys?\u201d Buffy asked, trying to break the silence.</p><p>Andi shrugged, her face neutral. \u201cNothing really. Since uni ended, I got an offer from Buzzfeed as a content creator. Some DIY stuff, like crafts and writing and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndi, that\u2019s great,\u201d Buffy said with a smile, confused by Andi\u2019s lack of reaction.</p><p>\u201cYeah, still haven\u2019t decided whether I\u2019m gonna take it. I might go down the design route, like interior or product of something,\u201d Andi replied, crossing her hands.</p><p>Buffy nodded slowly, not completely understanding Andi\u2019s thoughts anymore. She turned to Cyrus. \u201cWhat about you, Cy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I still have to study for my PhD if I wanna be a therapist,\u201d Cyrus said. \u201cBut on the other hand, YouTube seems to be going well. So the film-making part is going on too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, Cyrus,\u201d Andi said, flashing a quick smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd? I\u2019m not just talking about studies you know?\u201d Buffy said with a cheeky smile, aware of how cringey she sounded. But something felt off about the conversation, and she didn\u2019t like it. Things had to be the way they used to.</p><p>Cyrus laughed quietly. \u201cWell, don\u2019t look at me about that. Haven\u2019t been in a relationship longer than a couple days for 6 years now.\u201d</p><p>Buffy narrowed her eyes. \u201cSeriously? Why not?\u201d Cyrus just shrugged in response. \u201cYou mean nobody since\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Cyrus interrupted before Buffy could say his name, his heart for some reason beating fast. Why? He was over him. He HAD to be. 6 years for heaven\u2019s sake.</p><p>Andi nodded her head, thankfully drawing Buffy\u2019s attention away from him. \u201cI get it. Same situation with me,\u201d she said, lifting her shoulders slightly.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, you two,\u201d Buffy sighed, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cRelationships aren\u2019t the end all, be all of life Buffy. Not for everyone,\u201d Andi said, her words coming across a bit harsher than she intended, a fact she only realised when she saw Buffy flinch. But she couldn\u2019t take it back, even if she regretted it.</p><p>Cyrus narrowed his eyes, staring at Andi in confusion. \u201cWait, really? Nothing?\u201d Andi nodded. \u201cBut then when I met you 4 years ago, who was that guy?\u201d</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cCuz I remember you introduced him as your boyfri-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about Cyrus, you must be mistaken,\u201d Andi said quickly, cutting off Cyrus as fast as she could, before he said anything. Fuck how could she have forgotten he\u2019s met him, fuck fuck fuck.</p><p>Buffy was now staring at her weirdly, as Cyrus waved his hand, shaking his head. \u201cNo no no. I remember it clearly. What was his name?\u201d he muttered, snapping his fingers. \u201cI think it was Jake or Jame-\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus, I told you you\u2019re mistaken, so you\u2019re fucking mistaken!\u201d Andi hissed loudly, taking Cyrus aback. \u201cGod, you really have to stick your nose in everything, don\u2019t you? Sometimes you need to learn to just drop it,\u201d she said, grabbing her bag and walking away, leaving Buffy and Cyrus standing there dumbfounded. Everyone around them had gone silent when Andi had snapped, but soon the mutterings and assorted conversations resumed.</p><p>Buffy moved closer to Cyrus, both staring in the direction Andi had walked away.</p><p>Cyrus just sighed. \u201cWell, shit.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Andi stalked over to the buffet table in the restaurant, ignoring all the stares and the muttering. Not because she didn\u2019t care. She\u2019d just gotten used to it. Stares, comments, whispers were second nature to her now. She grabbed a plate, walking down the line of cloches, trying to find something vaguely interesting. \u00a0However, she was so engrossed in reading the labels that she collided with someone coming the other way.</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d the voice yelled.</p><p>\u201cWatch where you\u2019re going!\u201d Andi said at the same time, looking up at the person, annoyed. But she froze when she saw his face.</p><p>He was staring at her curiously, eyebrows furrowed as he tried to pinpoint why exactly the person before him looked so familiar. \u201cDo I know you?\u201d he asked, pointing at her.</p><p>Andi gave him a small smile. \u201cWell, you did. Back when I had shorter hair and no leather jacket. At least, not this colour.\u201d</p><p>At first, he just shook his head slightly, but then realisation flooded features, coupled with his characteristic charming smile.</p><p>\u201cAndi?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey Jonah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa you look different,\u201d he said, before immediately holding up his hands. \u201cGood different! I mean, cool!\u201d</p><p>Andi laughed softly, grabbing his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s okay Jonah, I know what you meant.\u201d She set her plate down on the table, going in for a hug that Jonah happily reciprocated. \u00a0\u201cHow have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know. Music and stuff,\u201d Jonah said with a shrug, his eyes moving to the side briefly. He pulled at the hem of his shirt, trying to resist the urge to ball up the fabric. He looked at Andi, trying not to stare but finding it hard. She looked so different. Leather jacket. Studs. Was that a tattoo?</p><p>\u201cWhoa, that\u2019s great! I\u2019m still working with crafts,\u201d Andi said, tilting her head to the side. She couldn\u2019t stop herself from staring at Jonah. Still handsome. But probably still oblivious. But handsome.</p><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t know how I would\u2019ve reacted,\u201d Jonah said with a wink, sending Andi laughing, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. Jonah couldn\u2019t help but smile and laugh along. Maybe not go down that rabbit hole, he chided himself, shifting his expression to a more neutral happy one.</p><p>The two went silent, unsure of what to say. It seemed to be a running theme now, not knowing what to say. But soon, Andi picked up her plate and turned to Jonah with a smile.</p><p>\u201cFried rice?\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>After an awkward goodbye, Cyrus walked over to the restaurant, making sure to steer clear of Andi, who was talking to a person who looked uncannily like Jonah.</p><p>Probably was Jonah. It\u2019s practically a Shadyside reunion. Oh-fucking-great.</p><p>Cyrus just turned away, grabbing a quarter plate of salad and throwing some fries in too, and sitting down at a corner table, hoping to just scroll through his phone in peace and quiet. The night had already drained him out, and it had barely begun.</p><p>A part of him was sad that his friend group no longer felt like it did. But what could he have expected? At the end of the day, all of them had parted ways, growing up in different places, living different lives. Them meeting at this hotel before leaving on another flight was just to show how far they had gone. It hurt, but he would just have to get used to it, wouldn\u2019t he?</p><p>Cyrus had just about unlocked his phone and opened Twitter when he heard a quiet gasp behind him. Or so he thought. He just ignored it and continued to scroll through dog pictures and memes, exhaling slightly at some of the posts. Just then, he felt someone stand in front of him.</p><p>\u201cIs that seat taken?\u201d</p><p>Only one person ever really said that to him in that way. But it couldn\u2019t be him. No. No it couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Could it?</p><p>Unable to believe his ears, Cyrus slowly looked up, mouth slightly open. But when he locked eyes with the person, he knew he was right in what he thought. He gulped, his throat suddenly dry.</p><p>\u201cTJ.\u201d</p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p><b>Hey guys hope you liked this chapter! Let me know what you think.

Andi pulled out one of her earphones at the sudden halt, peering forward where the conductor was asking them to \u2018exit in an orderly fashion and go to the lobby\u2019. She sighed, moving to get up, throwing her duffel bag over her shoulder. She trudged out of the bus with the other unfortunate people who were stuck there that night. When they entered the hotel, they were all directed to this seating area, charitably called a \u2018lobby\u2019, where they had to wait while rooms were arranged for them.</p><p>Andi huffed, letting the reassurances of \u2018We will have it under control soon,\u2019 and \u2018We will handle everything,\u2019 slide over her. She sank into a chair near a plug point, pushing in her phone charger and breathing a quiet sigh of relief when the screen lit up. As she scrolled through her phone, checking her posts, she landed on a picture of her in high school, scrolling by as fast as she could. She couldn\u2019t afford to look back at that part of her life, to look back and miss the perfect days when her life was in shambles around her. She would much rather forget those days rather than keep living with the fact that if only\u2026</p><p>See, that\u2019s why. Just forget it and scroll ahead.</p><p>Andi sighed and glanced up towards the buffet being laid out for the passengers in the hotel, looking back down. But something made her do a double take. Or rather someone.</p><p>By the tables, a tall girl was pacing and talking on the phone, occasionally rolling her eyes but laughing. Her curly hair was up in a bun on her head, and she was wearing a sports hoodie and sneakers. She looked older than before, obviously, but there was no mistaking who it was.</p><p>Andi felt her throat go dry, her mind racing at the speed of light, trying to process the fact that this was real. That it was really her.</p><p>Buffy Driscoll. One of Andi\u2019s best friends since 2<sup>nd</sup> Grade till High School. A fellow member of the Good Hair Crew. One of her perfect friends.</p><p>Andi didn\u2019t really feel herself get up, didn\u2019t realise she was walking across the lobby until she was just behind Buffy, who was just putting down the phone. Andi shakily drew a deep breath, unexpectedly nervous. Finally, she reached out and tapped Buffy on the shoulder with her finger.</p><p>\u201cFancy seeing you here,\u201d she said, causing Buffy to turn around quickly, her eyes wide. It took a minute for her to take in Andi\u2019s appearance, before her face broke into a huge smile. Buffy squealed and pulled Andi into a bone-crushing hug. Andi felt herself smile too, wrapping her arms around Buffy as tight as she could. They spent what felt like forever just clinging onto each other, the surroundings feeling dull in comparison. Eventually, Buffy pulled herself away from Andi, her eyes filled up slightly.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, it feels like forever!\u201d she said, grabbing Andi\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYou look so different! Good different of course,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd your hair! I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen it this length!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I underwent a real style transformation,\u201d Andi said, flipping her hair forward. \u201cBut look at you, still rocking those sports clothes, I see.\u201d</p><p>Buffy laughed slightly, looking down. \u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t go too much for travel outfits. Comfort over looks any day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a dig at my outfit? I have an aesthetic to keep up, you know.\u201d</p><p>Buffy rolled her eyes. \u201cWhat is that? Badass biker?\u201d</p><p>Andi\u2019s smiled dropped a bit, her walls being pushed against. \u201cClose, but no.\u201d</p><p>After the initial excitement and happiness, the awkward tension grew in between them, Buffy sensing Andi\u2019s change in manner.

And I just knew,\u201d she said softly. Hearing her talk couldn\u2019t help but make Andi and Cyrus give each other a look, knowing exactly what the other one was thinking. God, he had missed this.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re really happy for you Buffy,\u201d Andi said, reaching forward to squeeze Buffy\u2019s shoulder. Cyrus nodded his head with a smile.</p><p>\u201cThanks guys,\u201d Buffy said, going in to hug the two. \u201cGod, I never realised how much I missed you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, it\u2019s been forever,\u201d Cyrus said. \u201cLast I met Andi was 4 years ago and I met Buffy five years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too long, it should be illegal for us to be apart that long,\u201d Andi said, pulling away first. Cyrus sighed in agreement.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess one good thing came out of this flight being delayed,\u201d Cyrus said with a small laugh.</p><p>The three stood in relative silence, unsure of what to say now that the initial high of reuniting had faded, and all three were painfully reminded that none of them were the people who had left high school 6 years ago.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s been up with you guys?\u201d Buffy asked, trying to break the silence.</p><p>Andi shrugged, her face neutral. \u201cNothing really. Since uni ended, I got an offer from Buzzfeed as a content creator. Some DIY stuff, like crafts and writing and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndi, that\u2019s great,\u201d Buffy said with a smile, confused by Andi\u2019s lack of reaction.</p><p>\u201cYeah, still haven\u2019t decided whether I\u2019m gonna take it. I might go down the design route, like interior or product of something,\u201d Andi replied, crossing her hands.</p><p>Buffy nodded slowly, not completely understanding Andi\u2019s thoughts anymore. She turned to Cyrus. \u201cWhat about you, Cy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I still have to study for my PhD if I wanna be a therapist,\u201d Cyrus said. \u201cBut on the other hand, YouTube seems to be going well. So the film-making part is going on too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, Cyrus,\u201d Andi said, flashing a quick smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd? I\u2019m not just talking about studies you know?\u201d Buffy said with a cheeky smile, aware of how cringey she sounded. But something felt off about the conversation, and she didn\u2019t like it. Things had to be the way they used to.</p><p>Cyrus laughed quietly. \u201cWell, don\u2019t look at me about that. Haven\u2019t been in a relationship longer than a couple days for 6 years now.\u201d</p><p>Buffy narrowed her eyes. \u201cSeriously? Why not?\u201d Cyrus just shrugged in response. \u201cYou mean nobody since\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Cyrus interrupted before Buffy could say his name, his heart for some reason beating fast. Why? He was over him. He HAD to be. 6 years for heaven\u2019s sake.</p><p>Andi nodded her head, thankfully drawing Buffy\u2019s attention away from him. \u201cI get it. Same situation with me,\u201d she said, lifting her shoulders slightly.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, you two,\u201d Buffy sighed, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cRelationships aren\u2019t the end all, be all of life Buffy. Not for everyone,\u201d Andi said, her words coming across a bit harsher than she intended, a fact she only realised when she saw Buffy flinch. But she couldn\u2019t take it back, even if she regretted it.</p><p>Cyrus narrowed his eyes, staring at Andi in confusion. \u201cWait, really? Nothing?\u201d Andi nodded. \u201cBut then when I met you 4 years ago, who was that guy?\u201d</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cCuz I remember you introduced him as your boyfri-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about Cyrus, you must be mistaken,\u201d Andi said quickly, cutting off Cyrus as fast as she could, before he said anything. Fuck how could she have forgotten he\u2019s met him, fuck fuck fuck.</p><p>Buffy was now staring at her weirdly, as Cyrus waved his hand, shaking his head. \u201cNo no no. I remember it clearly. What was his name?\u201d he muttered, snapping his fingers. \u201cI think it was Jake or Jame-\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus, I told you you\u2019re mistaken, so you\u2019re fucking mistaken!\u201d Andi hissed loudly, taking Cyrus aback. \u201cGod, you really have to stick your nose in everything, don\u2019t you? Sometimes you need to learn to just drop it,\u201d she said, grabbing her bag and walking away, leaving Buffy and Cyrus standing there dumbfounded. Everyone around them had gone silent when Andi had snapped, but soon the mutterings and assorted conversations resumed.</p><p>Buffy moved closer to Cyrus, both staring in the direction Andi had walked away.</p><p>Cyrus just sighed. \u201cWell, shit.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Andi stalked over to the buffet table in the restaurant, ignoring all the stares and the muttering. Not because she didn\u2019t care. She\u2019d just gotten used to it. Stares, comments, whispers were second nature to her now. She grabbed a plate, walking down the line of cloches, trying to find something vaguely interesting. \u00a0However, she was so engrossed in reading the labels that she collided with someone coming the other way.</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d the voice yelled.</p><p>\u201cWatch where you\u2019re going!\u201d Andi said at the same time, looking up at the person, annoyed. But she froze when she saw his face.</p><p>He was staring at her curiously, eyebrows furrowed as he tried to pinpoint why exactly the person before him looked so familiar. \u201cDo I know you?\u201d he asked, pointing at her.</p><p>Andi gave him a small smile. \u201cWell, you did. Back when I had shorter hair and no leather jacket. At least, not this colour.\u201d</p><p>At first, he just shook his head slightly, but then realisation flooded features, coupled with his characteristic charming smile.</p><p>\u201cAndi?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey Jonah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa you look different,\u201d he said, before immediately holding up his hands. \u201cGood different! I mean, cool!\u201d</p><p>Andi laughed softly, grabbing his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s okay Jonah, I know what you meant.\u201d She set her plate down on the table, going in for a hug that Jonah happily reciprocated. \u00a0\u201cHow have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know. Music and stuff,\u201d Jonah said with a shrug, his eyes moving to the side briefly. He pulled at the hem of his shirt, trying to resist the urge to ball up the fabric. He looked at Andi, trying not to stare but finding it hard. She looked so different. Leather jacket. Studs. Was that a tattoo?</p><p>\u201cWhoa, that\u2019s great! I\u2019m still working with crafts,\u201d Andi said, tilting her head to the side. She couldn\u2019t stop herself from staring at Jonah. Still handsome. But probably still oblivious. But handsome.</p><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t know how I would\u2019ve reacted,\u201d Jonah said with a wink, sending Andi laughing, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. Jonah couldn\u2019t help but smile and laugh along. Maybe not go down that rabbit hole, he chided himself, shifting his expression to a more neutral happy one.</p><p>The two went silent, unsure of what to say. It seemed to be a running theme now, not knowing what to say. But soon, Andi picked up her plate and turned to Jonah with a smile.</p><p>\u201cFried rice?\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>After an awkward goodbye, Cyrus walked over to the restaurant, making sure to steer clear of Andi, who was talking to a person who looked uncannily like Jonah.</p><p>Probably was Jonah. It\u2019s practically a Shadyside reunion. Oh-fucking-great.</p><p>Cyrus just turned away, grabbing a quarter plate of salad and throwing some fries in too, and sitting down at a corner table, hoping to just scroll through his phone in peace and quiet. The night had already drained him out, and it had barely begun.</p><p>A part of him was sad that his friend group no longer felt like it did. But what could he have expected? At the end of the day, all of them had parted ways, growing up in different places, living different lives. Them meeting at this hotel before leaving on another flight was just to show how far they had gone. It hurt, but he would just have to get used to it, wouldn\u2019t he?</p><p>Cyrus had just about unlocked his phone and opened Twitter when he heard a quiet gasp behind him. Or so he thought. He just ignored it and continued to scroll through dog pictures and memes, exhaling slightly at some of the posts. Just then, he felt someone stand in front of him.</p><p>\u201cIs that seat taken?\u201d</p><p>Only one person ever really said that to him in that way. But it couldn\u2019t be him. No. No it couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Could it?</p><p>Unable to believe his ears, Cyrus slowly looked up, mouth slightly open. But when he locked eyes with the person, he knew he was right in what he thought. He gulped, his throat suddenly dry.</p><p>\u201cTJ.\u201d</p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p><b>Hey guys hope you liked this chapter! Let me know what you think.

They kept to their windows and phones for the ride, thinking about the others. They reminisced separately but prayed for the night to go by fast, to get to the places they needed to go.<br>But the night hadn\u2019t even begun yet.\u201d<br>High school ended 6 years ago, and with it, so did the friendship between Andi, Buffy, Cyrus, Jonah, TJ and Amber.<br>But now their flight is delayed and they are stuck in a hotel together for the night. Not much can change in one night, though.<br>Can it?</i></p><p><i><b>ALL LINKS IN REBLOG</b></i></p><p>~~~~~~~~~</p>[[MORE]]<p>The bus pulled up to the hotel, the sun well below the horizon by now. Andi pulled out one of her earphones at the sudden halt, peering forward where the conductor was asking them to \u2018exit in an orderly fashion and go to the lobby\u2019. She sighed, moving to get up, throwing her duffel bag over her shoulder. She trudged out of the bus with the other unfortunate people who were stuck there that night. When they entered the hotel, they were all directed to this seating area, charitably called a \u2018lobby\u2019, where they had to wait while rooms were arranged for them.</p><p>Andi huffed, letting the reassurances of \u2018We will have it under control soon,\u2019 and \u2018We will handle everything,\u2019 slide over her. She sank into a chair near a plug point, pushing in her phone charger and breathing a quiet sigh of relief when the screen lit up. As she scrolled through her phone, checking her posts, she landed on a picture of her in high school, scrolling by as fast as she could. She couldn\u2019t afford to look back at that part of her life, to look back and miss the perfect days when her life was in shambles around her. She would much rather forget those days rather than keep living with the fact that if only\u2026</p><p>See, that\u2019s why. Just forget it and scroll ahead.</p><p>Andi sighed and glanced up towards the buffet being laid out for the passengers in the hotel, looking back down. But something made her do a double take. Or rather someone.</p><p>By the tables, a tall girl was pacing and talking on the phone, occasionally rolling her eyes but laughing. Her curly hair was up in a bun on her head, and she was wearing a sports hoodie and sneakers. She looked older than before, obviously, but there was no mistaking who it was.</p><p>Andi felt her throat go dry, her mind racing at the speed of light, trying to process the fact that this was real. That it was really her.</p><p>Buffy Driscoll. One of Andi\u2019s best friends since 2<sup>nd</sup> Grade till High School. A fellow member of the Good Hair Crew. One of her perfect friends.</p><p>Andi didn\u2019t really feel herself get up, didn\u2019t realise she was walking across the lobby until she was just behind Buffy, who was just putting down the phone. Andi shakily drew a deep breath, unexpectedly nervous. Finally, she reached out and tapped Buffy on the shoulder with her finger.</p><p>\u201cFancy seeing you here,\u201d she said, causing Buffy to turn around quickly, her eyes wide. It took a minute for her to take in Andi\u2019s appearance, before her face broke into a huge smile. Buffy squealed and pulled Andi into a bone-crushing hug. Andi felt herself smile too, wrapping her arms around Buffy as tight as she could. They spent what felt like forever just clinging onto each other, the surroundings feeling dull in comparison. Eventually, Buffy pulled herself away from Andi, her eyes filled up slightly.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, it feels like forever!\u201d she said, grabbing Andi\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYou look so different! Good different of course,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd your hair! I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen it this length!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I underwent a real style transformation,\u201d Andi said, flipping her hair forward. \u201cBut look at you, still rocking those sports clothes, I see.\u201d</p><p>Buffy laughed slightly, looking down. \u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t go too much for travel outfits. Comfort over looks any day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a dig at my outfit? I have an aesthetic to keep up, you know.\u201d</p><p>Buffy rolled her eyes. \u201cWhat is that? Badass biker?\u201d</p><p>Andi\u2019s smiled dropped a bit, her walls being pushed against. \u201cClose, but no.\u201d</p><p>After the initial excitement and happiness, the awkward tension grew in between them, Buffy sensing Andi\u2019s change in manner. Both were unsure of what else to say. They glanced back at the other, giving an awkward smile but looking away. This never used to happen to them back in school, but here they were, the silence between them growing. Andi looked down, catching sight of Buffy\u2019s hand, where sat a silver ring. She gasped, grabbing her hand.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, is that what I think it is?\u201d she said, the smile on her face coming back.</p><p>Buffy tried to hide her excited smile but to no avail. She held up her hand, showing the ring. \u201cIt may be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, who is it?\u201d Andi asked teasingly.</p><p>Buffy\u2019s smile softened, her eyes fond. \u201cIt\u2019s Marty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Andi said, her words just louder than a whisper. \u201cAfter all this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe met again last time I was in Shadyside, and it just felt right? With him, it always has,\u201d Buffy said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy for you, Buffy. I really am,\u201d Andi said, clasping her hand.</p><p>Buffy sighed, sniffing a bit. She pushed Andi\u2019s shoulder slightly, an unusual gesture but not unwelcome. \u201cWhat about you? How\u2019s that front of your life?\u201d</p><p>Almost instantly, it felt as if all the air had been sucked out of Andi\u2019s lungs. She just kept looking at Buffy, her mind drawing a blank.</p><p>Actually, there was no blank. There were thoughts circulating, but all of them were\u2026 unpleasant. As her mind kept supplying thoughts, she grew more and more frustrated. She tried desperately to internalise it, to throw it behind the walls she had spent months building. Buffy was staring at her in confusion, as Andi tried to find the words to say, but all that came out was silence.</p><p>Say something, anything. For fuck\u2019s sake, she\u2019s looking at you like you\u2019re insane.</p><p>But thankfully, before she had to say anything or explain herself, a welcome distraction came in the form of a voice calling from behind them.</p><p>\u201cAndi? Buffy?\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Cyrus had just been heading to the buffet to try and find something to eat, seeing that he hadn\u2019t eaten for a good couple hours. He noticed the girl from the airport standing there talking to another girl, the other in a sports hoodie. They had been talking and hugging as if they had been reunited after years. As he caught a glimpse of her, he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that he knew her. Cyrus pinched the bridge of his nose, his headache still not gone, as he wracked his brain trying to figure out who it could be. He looked back at the two girls, hoping that another glance might help him place her. It didn\u2019t help much, he still couldn\u2019t figure out how he knew her. But then he saw the other girl, smiling but her eyebrows furrowed in concern. And that expression made Cyrus feel as if his mind had fallen down a wormhole.</p><p>He had seen that expression before. It had been directed at him before by only one person.</p><p>That meant\u2026</p><p>\u201cAndi? Buffy?\u201d Cyrus called out in utter disbelief. The suitcase he had been dragging along beside him was suddenly forgotten as he walked forward in a daze toward the two girls. They both turned to look at him in shock. And when Cyrus finally got a good look at them he knew he was right.</p><p>Andi Mack and Buffy Driscoll.</p><p>\u201cCyrus?!\u201d the both of them said, with shocked smiles on their faces. That was all Cyrus needed to run forward and envelope the two in a group hug. Or, at least try to. He accidentally collided into Andi\u2019s side, pushing the two and nearly toppling them over. The three laughed awkwardly for a bit, before all going into a hug. Cyrus held his two best friends as tight as he could, a part of him convinced that if he didn\u2019t, he would wake up from what clearly had to be a dream.</p><p>\u201cWhat are the odds of all three of us bumping into each other here?\u201d Buffy said after the three pulled away.</p><p>Cyrus shook his head, still stunned. \u201cOf all the places we could meet,\u201d he said, stepping back.</p><p>\u201cThis is by far the craziest thing to happen to me,\u201d Andi said, her smile wide.</p><p>The three laughed, Cyrus going back for a moment to get his suitcase from where it was about to become a tripping hazard. When he got back, he finally noticed Buffy\u2019s left hand, doing a double take.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d he said, grabbing her hand, eliciting a chuckle from Buffy. \u201cWhen did this happen? Who is it? How??\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike 3 months ago,\u201d Buffy said, shrugging. \u201cFunny thing is Marty and I both asked each other just while we were sitting on the couch watching movies. Just like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course that\u2019s how the proposal went down,\u201d Andi said, facepalming.</p><p>\u201cWait. Marty? From school?\u201d Cyrus asked.</p><p>Buffy nodded, looking down at her shoes. \u201cEveryone else I dated after high school was amazing, but I don\u2019t know. I really liked them all, but for some reason, they never lasted. How ever long we went out. Then, a couple years ago, I met Marty in Shadyside while visiting and we started talking again. And I just knew,\u201d she said softly. Hearing her talk couldn\u2019t help but make Andi and Cyrus give each other a look, knowing exactly what the other one was thinking. God, he had missed this.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re really happy for you Buffy,\u201d Andi said, reaching forward to squeeze Buffy\u2019s shoulder. Cyrus nodded his head with a smile.</p><p>\u201cThanks guys,\u201d Buffy said, going in to hug the two. \u201cGod, I never realised how much I missed you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, it\u2019s been forever,\u201d Cyrus said. \u201cLast I met Andi was 4 years ago and I met Buffy five years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too long, it should be illegal for us to be apart that long,\u201d Andi said, pulling away first. Cyrus sighed in agreement.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess one good thing came out of this flight being delayed,\u201d Cyrus said with a small laugh.</p><p>The three stood in relative silence, unsure of what to say now that the initial high of reuniting had faded, and all three were painfully reminded that none of them were the people who had left high school 6 years ago.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s been up with you guys?\u201d Buffy asked, trying to break the silence.</p><p>Andi shrugged, her face neutral. \u201cNothing really. Since uni ended, I got an offer from Buzzfeed as a content creator. Some DIY stuff, like crafts and writing and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndi, that\u2019s great,\u201d Buffy said with a smile, confused by Andi\u2019s lack of reaction.</p><p>\u201cYeah, still haven\u2019t decided whether I\u2019m gonna take it. I might go down the design route, like interior or product of something,\u201d Andi replied, crossing her hands.</p><p>Buffy nodded slowly, not completely understanding Andi\u2019s thoughts anymore. She turned to Cyrus. \u201cWhat about you, Cy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I still have to study for my PhD if I wanna be a therapist,\u201d Cyrus said. \u201cBut on the other hand, YouTube seems to be going well. So the film-making part is going on too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, Cyrus,\u201d Andi said, flashing a quick smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd? I\u2019m not just talking about studies you know?\u201d Buffy said with a cheeky smile, aware of how cringey she sounded. But something felt off about the conversation, and she didn\u2019t like it. Things had to be the way they used to.</p><p>Cyrus laughed quietly. \u201cWell, don\u2019t look at me about that. Haven\u2019t been in a relationship longer than a couple days for 6 years now.\u201d</p><p>Buffy narrowed her eyes. \u201cSeriously? Why not?\u201d Cyrus just shrugged in response. \u201cYou mean nobody since\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Cyrus interrupted before Buffy could say his name, his heart for some reason beating fast. Why? He was over him. He HAD to be. 6 years for heaven\u2019s sake.</p><p>Andi nodded her head, thankfully drawing Buffy\u2019s attention away from him. \u201cI get it. Same situation with me,\u201d she said, lifting her shoulders slightly.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, you two,\u201d Buffy sighed, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cRelationships aren\u2019t the end all, be all of life Buffy. Not for everyone,\u201d Andi said, her words coming across a bit harsher than she intended, a fact she only realised when she saw Buffy flinch. But she couldn\u2019t take it back, even if she regretted it.</p><p>Cyrus narrowed his eyes, staring at Andi in confusion. \u201cWait, really? Nothing?\u201d Andi nodded. \u201cBut then when I met you 4 years ago, who was that guy?\u201d</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cCuz I remember you introduced him as your boyfri-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about Cyrus, you must be mistaken,\u201d Andi said quickly, cutting off Cyrus as fast as she could, before he said anything. Fuck how could she have forgotten he\u2019s met him, fuck fuck fuck.</p><p>Buffy was now staring at her weirdly, as Cyrus waved his hand, shaking his head. \u201cNo no no. I remember it clearly. What was his name?\u201d he muttered, snapping his fingers. \u201cI think it was Jake or Jame-\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus, I told you you\u2019re mistaken, so you\u2019re fucking mistaken!\u201d Andi hissed loudly, taking Cyrus aback. \u201cGod, you really have to stick your nose in everything, don\u2019t you? Sometimes you need to learn to just drop it,\u201d she said, grabbing her bag and walking away, leaving Buffy and Cyrus standing there dumbfounded. Everyone around them had gone silent when Andi had snapped, but soon the mutterings and assorted conversations resumed.</p><p>Buffy moved closer to Cyrus, both staring in the direction Andi had walked away.</p><p>Cyrus just sighed. \u201cWell, shit.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Andi stalked over to the buffet table in the restaurant, ignoring all the stares and the muttering. Not because she didn\u2019t care. She\u2019d just gotten used to it. Stares, comments, whispers were second nature to her now. She grabbed a plate, walking down the line of cloches, trying to find something vaguely interesting. \u00a0However, she was so engrossed in reading the labels that she collided with someone coming the other way.</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d the voice yelled.</p><p>\u201cWatch where you\u2019re going!\u201d Andi said at the same time, looking up at the person, annoyed. But she froze when she saw his face.</p><p>He was staring at her curiously, eyebrows furrowed as he tried to pinpoint why exactly the person before him looked so familiar. \u201cDo I know you?\u201d he asked, pointing at her.</p><p>Andi gave him a small smile. \u201cWell, you did. Back when I had shorter hair and no leather jacket. At least, not this colour.\u201d</p><p>At first, he just shook his head slightly, but then realisation flooded features, coupled with his characteristic charming smile.</p><p>\u201cAndi?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey Jonah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa you look different,\u201d he said, before immediately holding up his hands. \u201cGood different! I mean, cool!\u201d</p><p>Andi laughed softly, grabbing his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s okay Jonah, I know what you meant.\u201d She set her plate down on the table, going in for a hug that Jonah happily reciprocated. \u00a0\u201cHow have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know. Music and stuff,\u201d Jonah said with a shrug, his eyes moving to the side briefly. He pulled at the hem of his shirt, trying to resist the urge to ball up the fabric. He looked at Andi, trying not to stare but finding it hard. She looked so different. Leather jacket. Studs. Was that a tattoo?</p><p>\u201cWhoa, that\u2019s great! I\u2019m still working with crafts,\u201d Andi said, tilting her head to the side. She couldn\u2019t stop herself from staring at Jonah. Still handsome. But probably still oblivious. But handsome.</p><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t know how I would\u2019ve reacted,\u201d Jonah said with a wink, sending Andi laughing, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. Jonah couldn\u2019t help but smile and laugh along. Maybe not go down that rabbit hole, he chided himself, shifting his expression to a more neutral happy one.</p><p>The two went silent, unsure of what to say. It seemed to be a running theme now, not knowing what to say. But soon, Andi picked up her plate and turned to Jonah with a smile.</p><p>\u201cFried rice?\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>After an awkward goodbye, Cyrus walked over to the restaurant, making sure to steer clear of Andi, who was talking to a person who looked uncannily like Jonah.</p><p>Probably was Jonah. It\u2019s practically a Shadyside reunion. Oh-fucking-great.</p><p>Cyrus just turned away, grabbing a quarter plate of salad and throwing some fries in too, and sitting down at a corner table, hoping to just scroll through his phone in peace and quiet.

He just ignored it and continued to scroll through dog pictures and memes, exhaling slightly at some of the posts. Just then, he felt someone stand in front of him.</p><p>\u201cIs that seat taken?\u201d</p><p>Only one person ever really said that to him in that way. But it couldn\u2019t be him. No. No it couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Could it?</p><p>Unable to believe his ears, Cyrus slowly looked up, mouth slightly open. But when he locked eyes with the person, he knew he was right in what he thought.

                "content": "<p><b>Summary: &nbsp;</b><i>&ldquo;All felt like they knew the others were far away, living ideal lives. They kept to their windows and phones for the ride, thinking about the others. They reminisced separately but prayed for the night to go by fast, to get to the places they needed to go.<br />But the night hadn&rsquo;t even begun yet.&rdquo;<br />High school ended 6 years ago, and with it, so did the friendship between Andi, Buffy, Cyrus, Jonah, TJ and Amber.<br />But now their flight is delayed and they are stuck in a hotel together for the night. Not much can change in one night, though.<br />Can it?</i></p><p><i><b>ALL LINKS IN REBLOG</b></i></p><p>~~~~~~~~~</p><p>The bus pulled up to the hotel, the sun well below the horizon by now. Andi pulled out one of her earphones at the sudden halt, peering forward where the conductor was asking them to &lsquo;exit in an orderly fashion and go to the lobby&rsquo;. She sighed, moving to get up, throwing her duffel bag over her shoulder. She trudged out of the bus with the other unfortunate people who were stuck there that night. When they entered the hotel, they were all directed to this seating area, charitably called a &lsquo;lobby&rsquo;, where they had to wait while rooms were arranged for them.</p><p>Andi huffed, letting the reassurances of &lsquo;We will have it under control soon,&rsquo; and &lsquo;We will handle everything,&rsquo; slide over her. She sank into a chair near a plug point, pushing in her phone charger and breathing a quiet sigh of relief when the screen lit up. As she scrolled through her phone, checking her posts, she landed on a picture of her in high school, scrolling by as fast as she could. She couldn&rsquo;t afford to look back at that part of her life, to look back and miss the perfect days when her life was in shambles around her. She would much rather forget those days rather than keep living with the fact that if only&hellip;</p><p>See, that&rsquo;s why. Just forget it and scroll ahead.</p><p>Andi sighed and glanced up towards the buffet being laid out for the passengers in the hotel, looking back down. But something made her do a double take. Or rather someone.</p><p>By the tables, a tall girl was pacing and talking on the phone, occasionally rolling her eyes but laughing. Her curly hair was up in a bun on her head, and she was wearing a sports hoodie and sneakers. She looked older than before, obviously, but there was no mistaking who it was.</p><p>Andi felt her throat go dry, her mind racing at the speed of light, trying to process the fact that this was real. That it was really her.</p><p>Buffy Driscoll. One of Andi&rsquo;s best friends since 2<sup>nd</sup> Grade till High School. A fellow member of the Good Hair Crew. One of her perfect friends.</p><p>Andi didn&rsquo;t really feel herself get up, didn&rsquo;t realise she was walking across the lobby until she was just behind Buffy, who was just putting down the phone. Andi shakily drew a deep breath, unexpectedly nervous. Finally, she reached out and tapped Buffy on the shoulder with her finger.</p><p>&ldquo;Fancy seeing you here,&rdquo; she said, causing Buffy to turn around quickly, her eyes wide. It took a minute for her to take in Andi&rsquo;s appearance, before her face broke into a huge smile. Buffy squealed and pulled Andi into a bone-crushing hug. Andi felt herself smile too, wrapping her arms around Buffy as tight as she could. They spent what felt like forever just clinging onto each other, the surroundings feeling dull in comparison. Eventually, Buffy pulled herself away from Andi, her eyes filled up slightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god, it feels like forever!&rdquo; she said, grabbing Andi&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;You look so different! Good different of course,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;And your hair! I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever seen it this length!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I underwent a real style transformation,&rdquo; Andi said, flipping her hair forward. &ldquo;But look at you, still rocking those sports clothes, I see.&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy laughed slightly, looking down. &ldquo;Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t go too much for travel outfits. Comfort over looks any day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that a dig at my outfit? I have an aesthetic to keep up, you know.&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy rolled her eyes. &ldquo;What is that? Badass biker?&rdquo;</p><p>Andi&rsquo;s smiled dropped a bit, her walls being pushed against. &ldquo;Close, but no.&rdquo;</p><p>After the initial excitement and happiness, the awkward tension grew in between them, Buffy sensing Andi&rsquo;s change in manner. Both were unsure of what else to say. They glanced back at the other, giving an awkward smile but looking away. This never used to happen to them back in school, but here they were, the silence between them growing. Andi looked down, catching sight of Buffy&rsquo;s hand, where sat a silver ring. She gasped, grabbing her hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god, is that what I think it is?&rdquo; she said, the smile on her face coming back.</p><p>Buffy tried to hide her excited smile but to no avail. She held up her hand, showing the ring. &ldquo;It may be.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So, who is it?&rdquo; Andi asked teasingly.</p><p>Buffy&rsquo;s smile softened, her eyes fond. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Marty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whoa,&rdquo; Andi said, her words just louder than a whisper. &ldquo;After all this time?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We met again last time I was in Shadyside, and it just felt right? With him, it always has,&rdquo; Buffy said.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy for you, Buffy. I really am,&rdquo; Andi said, clasping her hand.</p><p>Buffy sighed, sniffing a bit. She pushed Andi&rsquo;s shoulder slightly, an unusual gesture but not unwelcome. &ldquo;What about you? How&rsquo;s that front of your life?&rdquo;</p><p>Almost instantly, it felt as if all the air had been sucked out of Andi&rsquo;s lungs. She just kept looking at Buffy, her mind drawing a blank.</p><p>Actually, there was no blank. There were thoughts circulating, but all of them were&hellip; unpleasant. As her mind kept supplying thoughts, she grew more and more frustrated. She tried desperately to internalise it, to throw it behind the walls she had spent months building. Buffy was staring at her in confusion, as Andi tried to find the words to say, but all that came out was silence.</p><p>Say something, anything. For fuck&rsquo;s sake, she&rsquo;s looking at you like you&rsquo;re insane.</p><p>But thankfully, before she had to say anything or explain herself, a welcome distraction came in the form of a voice calling from behind them.</p><p>&ldquo;Andi? Buffy?&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>Cyrus had just been heading to the buffet to try and find something to eat, seeing that he hadn&rsquo;t eaten for a good couple hours. He noticed the girl from the airport standing there talking to another girl, the other in a sports hoodie. They had been talking and hugging as if they had been reunited after years. As he caught a glimpse of her, he couldn&rsquo;t shake the feeling that he knew her. Cyrus pinched the bridge of his nose, his headache still not gone, as he wracked his brain trying to figure out who it could be. He looked back at the two girls, hoping that another glance might help him place her. It didn&rsquo;t help much, he still couldn&rsquo;t figure out how he knew her. But then he saw the other girl, smiling but her eyebrows furrowed in concern. And that expression made Cyrus feel as if his mind had fallen down a wormhole.</p><p>He had seen that expression before. It had been directed at him before by only one person.</p><p>That meant&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Andi? Buffy?&rdquo; Cyrus called out in utter disbelief. The suitcase he had been dragging along beside him was suddenly forgotten as he walked forward in a daze toward the two girls. They both turned to look at him in shock. And when Cyrus finally got a good look at them he knew he was right.</p><p>Andi Mack and Buffy Driscoll.</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus?!&rdquo; the both of them said, with shocked smiles on their faces. That was all Cyrus needed to run forward and envelope the two in a group hug. Or, at least try to. He accidentally collided into Andi&rsquo;s side, pushing the two and nearly toppling them over. The three laughed awkwardly for a bit, before all going into a hug. Cyrus held his two best friends as tight as he could, a part of him convinced that if he didn&rsquo;t, he would wake up from what clearly had to be a dream.</p><p>&ldquo;What are the odds of all three of us bumping into each other here?&rdquo; Buffy said after the three pulled away.</p><p>Cyrus shook his head, still stunned. &ldquo;Of all the places we could meet,&rdquo; he said, stepping back.</p><p>&ldquo;This is by far the craziest thing to happen to me,&rdquo; Andi said, her smile wide.</p><p>The three laughed, Cyrus going back for a moment to get his suitcase from where it was about to become a tripping hazard. When he got back, he finally noticed Buffy&rsquo;s left hand, doing a double take.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; he said, grabbing her hand, eliciting a chuckle from Buffy. &ldquo;When did this happen? Who is it? How??&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like 3 months ago,&rdquo; Buffy said, shrugging. &ldquo;Funny thing is Marty and I both asked each other just while we were sitting on the couch watching movies. Just like that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course that&rsquo;s how the proposal went down,&rdquo; Andi said, facepalming.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait. Marty? From school?&rdquo; Cyrus asked.</p><p>Buffy nodded, looking down at her shoes. &ldquo;Everyone else I dated after high school was amazing, but I don&rsquo;t know. I really liked them all, but for some reason, they never lasted. How ever long we went out. Then, a couple years ago, I met Marty in Shadyside while visiting and we started talking again. And I just knew,&rdquo; she said softly. Hearing her talk couldn&rsquo;t help but make Andi and Cyrus give each other a look, knowing exactly what the other one was thinking. God, he had missed this.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re really happy for you Buffy,&rdquo; Andi said, reaching forward to squeeze Buffy&rsquo;s shoulder. Cyrus nodded his head with a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks guys,&rdquo; Buffy said, going in to hug the two. &ldquo;God, I never realised how much I missed you guys.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, it&rsquo;s been forever,&rdquo; Cyrus said. &ldquo;Last I met Andi was 4 years ago and I met Buffy five years ago.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too long, it should be illegal for us to be apart that long,&rdquo; Andi said, pulling away first. Cyrus sighed in agreement.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I guess one good thing came out of this flight being delayed,&rdquo; Cyrus said with a small laugh.</p><p>The three stood in relative silence, unsure of what to say now that the initial high of reuniting had faded, and all three were painfully reminded that none of them were the people who had left high school 6 years ago.</p><p>&ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s been up with you guys?&rdquo; Buffy asked, trying to break the silence.</p><p>Andi shrugged, her face neutral. &ldquo;Nothing really. Since uni ended, I got an offer from Buzzfeed as a content creator. Some DIY stuff, like crafts and writing and stuff.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Andi, that&rsquo;s great,&rdquo; Buffy said with a smile, confused by Andi&rsquo;s lack of reaction.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, still haven&rsquo;t decided whether I&rsquo;m gonna take it. I might go down the design route, like interior or product of something,&rdquo; Andi replied, crossing her hands.</p><p>Buffy nodded slowly, not completely understanding Andi&rsquo;s thoughts anymore. She turned to Cyrus. &ldquo;What about you, Cy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I still have to study for my PhD if I wanna be a therapist,&rdquo; Cyrus said. &ldquo;But on the other hand, YouTube seems to be going well. So the film-making part is going on too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great, Cyrus,&rdquo; Andi said, flashing a quick smile.</p><p>&ldquo;And? I&rsquo;m not just talking about studies you know?&rdquo; Buffy said with a cheeky smile, aware of how cringey she sounded. But something felt off about the conversation, and she didn&rsquo;t like it. Things had to be the way they used to.</p><p>Cyrus laughed quietly. &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t look at me about that. Haven&rsquo;t been in a relationship longer than a couple days for 6 years now.&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy narrowed her eyes. &ldquo;Seriously? Why not?&rdquo; Cyrus just shrugged in response. &ldquo;You mean nobody since&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; Cyrus interrupted before Buffy could say his name, his heart for some reason beating fast. Why? He was over him. He HAD to be. 6 years for heaven&rsquo;s sake.</p><p>Andi nodded her head, thankfully drawing Buffy&rsquo;s attention away from him. &ldquo;I get it. Same situation with me,&rdquo; she said, lifting her shoulders slightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god, you two,&rdquo; Buffy sighed, shaking her head.</p><p>&ldquo;Relationships aren&rsquo;t the end all, be all of life Buffy.
