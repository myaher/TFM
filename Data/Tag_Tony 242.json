He watched his kid\u2019s body tense jerking on the ground as his muscles spasm. Tony was pretty sure that Peter wasn\u2019t even conscious at this point. </p><p>A man dressed in all black laughed fiddling with a syringe in his hand. \u201cWell isn\u2019t that a pretty sight.\u201d The man squatted down to Tony\u2019s level waving the needle on his face. \u201cAnd to think I thought those Hydra scientists couldn\u2019t do shit.\u201d</p><p>Peter continued to convulse on the ground and Tony could take his eyes off of him. \u201cWhat the hell did you just inject in his neck?\u201d </p><p>\u201cJust some little concoction that makes the nerve cells in your brain to misfire causing the victim to have a seizure depending on how high the dosage is,\u201d The man laughed at Tony\u2019s concern. \u201cIsn\u2019t this great? I\u2019m going o be a rich man after this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all got to make our money somehow.\u201d</p><p>Peter gagged loudly as his jerking came to a stop. He didn\u2019t move, he laid on the floor fingers twitching slightly. Tony wanted to scream, to break out of these chains holding him against the wall and comfort his kid. </p><p>The man grabbed Peter\u2019s collar lifting him off the ground. He touched his face smacking it repeatedly until the kid stirred. </p><p>\u201cGet your hands off of him!\u201d</p><p>The man ignored him focusing his attention on his kid. \u201cCome on brat open your eyes, we don\u2019t got all day.\u201d </p><p>Peter opened his eyes startled by the strange man in front of him. His movements were sluggish but he still tried to push him away. The man, however, had a strong grip on Peter and he was quickly shoved against the wall unable to move. </p><p>\u201cT\u2019ny?\u201d Peter slurred trying to reach out to his mentor. </p><p>\u201cJust leave him alone,\u201d Tony pleaded. \u201cHe\u2019s just a kid!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s also my test subjects for the time being.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widen at the man\u2019s comments noticing the syringe coming closer to his neck. Tony could see him panicking trying to get away. But it was no use, the needle went in and he down on the ground. His chains raddled loudly as his body jerked violently this time. </p><p>Muffled gags echoed through the room as the man marvel at the syringe in his hand. Tony was at lost for words, too horrified to take his eyes off of Peter. By the time Peter stopped seizing, the man finally freed Tony allowing him to scramble over to his kid.</p><p>\u201cYou really are pathetic Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in an hour to resume our little experiment. Make sure the brat is awake.\u201d</p><p>The door slammed loudly leaving Tony with an unconscious Peter. He was pale but definitely still breathing. He was quick to put his kid on his lap, combing through his messy curls hoping he would wake up soon. </p><p>\u201cMhm,\u201d Peter groaned. \u201cT\u2019ny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s me kiddo, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t feel so good.\u201d</i></p><p>Tony\u2019s whole body tense remember the events of what happened on Titan. He didn\u2019t need this right now, what he needed was to be home with Peter watching a movie like he promised. But instead, they were trapped God knows where. </p><p>\u201cThe drugs should be out of your system soon bud.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded snuggling closer into Tony\u2019s chest. \u201cI don\u2019t like that man. He\u2019s mean.\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckled slightly knowing that his kid was still pretty out of it. He just hoped he could somehow convince the man to let him take Peter\u2019s place. He didn\u2019t know what was even being injected into his kid but it definitely was affected him. </p><p>The two of them didn\u2019t say anything after that, they instead sat in silence as Tony counted down the minutes until the man returned. </p><p>____</p><p>The door slammed open as a fully aware Peter head jerked up almost hitting Tony. The grip around his kid tightened as the man walked in with multiple needles. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m back with the good stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare touch him,\u201d Tony said placing Peter behind him. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not in control here Stark. I am,\u201d The man sneered before roughly grabbing him from Peter\u2019s own grasp. </p><p>Struggling against his attacker, Tony managed to get a few good hits in until he was shoved into a wall. The man pulls him in a choke hold as black dots filled his vision. When the man finally let go one of his hands were already bound to the wall in chains. </p><p>Tony gasped trying to steady his breathing as he yanked against the chain. Peter himself tried getting free but he was already being pinned by the man. </p><p>\u201cNow hold still I wanna see what this dosage does.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cNo, no!\u201d</i> Peter squirmed. </p><p>His body spasm again the moment the needle hit his neck. He gagged tears falling from his face as the man stood back cheering. Tony was going to him, he already knew that but what he didn\u2019t know if Peter was going to make it out alive. </p><p>Unlike last time Peter\u2019s seizure lasted almost three minutes and he was barely awake when he stopped. The man didn\u2019t even wait, he took another syringe and injected Peter with it. His body jerked chains hitting the floor and Tony could look away. </p><p>The next hour Tony watched his kid be repeatedly subjected to whatever was in those syringes. He knew Peter was strong and he\u2019s added healing factor definitely would help him. But he still didn\u2019t know what would long-term effects. </p><p>When the man finally emptied the last syringe, Peter cried body still trembling. Tony was freed once again and the man left without another word smiling from ear to ear. </p><p>\u201cT\u2019ny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, I\u2019m here!\u201d</p><p>Peter whimpered movements still sluggish. \u201cI-I can\u2019t take a-anymore of that, I can\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe team looking for us, don\u2019t worry Pete. They\u2019ll come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-You promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>Tony bit his lip trying not to panic himself. The team was looking for them, without a doubt but what he didn\u2019t know if they would find them in time. He couldn\u2019t help but picture Peter laying dead on the floor. His kid couldn\u2019t take much more of this, but he couldn\u2019t say that out loud. So he sighed combing through Peter\u2019s hair hoping that the team gets here soon. </p><hr><p>Permanent Tags:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSAoXn7rDKTQ-SDQxNVGeAg\">@winteriscomingidjits</a> | <a

It just became much harder for content creators to spread their work and this would help a lot! <b>You can find my Masterlist on my profile and the Whumptober Masterlist under series!</b></i></p><p><i><b><br /></b></i></p><hr /><p>Horror washed over Tony the moment Peter hit the ground. He watched his kid&rsquo;s body tense jerking on the ground as his muscles spasm. Tony was pretty sure that Peter wasn&rsquo;t even conscious at this point. </p><p>A man dressed in all black laughed fiddling with a syringe in his hand. &ldquo;Well isn&rsquo;t that a pretty sight.&rdquo; The man squatted down to Tony&rsquo;s level waving the needle on his face. &ldquo;And to think I thought those Hydra scientists couldn&rsquo;t do shit.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter continued to convulse on the ground and Tony could take his eyes off of him. &ldquo;What the hell did you just inject in his neck?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Just some little concoction that makes the nerve cells in your brain to misfire causing the victim to have a seizure depending on how high the dosage is,&rdquo; The man laughed at Tony&rsquo;s concern. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this great? I&rsquo;m going o be a rich man after this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sick.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We all got to make our money somehow.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter gagged loudly as his jerking came to a stop. He didn&rsquo;t move, he laid on the floor fingers twitching slightly. Tony wanted to scream, to break out of these chains holding him against the wall and comfort his kid. </p><p>The man grabbed Peter&rsquo;s collar lifting him off the ground. He touched his face smacking it repeatedly until the kid stirred. </p><p>&ldquo;Get your hands off of him!&rdquo;</p><p>The man ignored him focusing his attention on his kid. &ldquo;Come on brat open your eyes, we don&rsquo;t got all day.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter opened his eyes startled by the strange man in front of him. His movements were sluggish but he still tried to push him away. The man, however, had a strong grip on Peter and he was quickly shoved against the wall unable to move. </p><p>&ldquo;T&rsquo;ny?&rdquo; Peter slurred trying to reach out to his mentor. </p><p>&ldquo;Just leave him alone,&rdquo; Tony pleaded. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just a kid!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s also my test subjects for the time being.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes widen at the man&rsquo;s comments noticing the syringe coming closer to his neck. Tony could see him panicking trying to get away. But it was no use, the needle went in and he down on the ground. His chains raddled loudly as his body jerked violently this time. </p><p>Muffled gags echoed through the room as the man marvel at the syringe in his hand. Tony was at lost for words, too horrified to take his eyes off of Peter. By the time Peter stopped seizing, the man finally freed Tony allowing him to scramble over to his kid.</p><p>&ldquo;You really are pathetic Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go to hell.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in an hour to resume our little experiment. Make sure the brat is awake.&rdquo;</p><p>The door slammed loudly leaving Tony with an unconscious Peter. He was pale but definitely still breathing. He was quick to put his kid on his lap, combing through his messy curls hoping he would wake up soon. </p><p>&ldquo;Mhm,&rdquo; Peter groaned. &ldquo;T&rsquo;ny?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s me kiddo, it&rsquo;s me.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel so good.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Tony&rsquo;s whole body tense remember the events of what happened on Titan. He didn&rsquo;t need this right now, what he needed was to be home with Peter watching a movie like he promised. But instead, they were trapped God knows where. </p><p>&ldquo;The drugs should be out of your system soon bud.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nodded snuggling closer into Tony&rsquo;s chest. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that man. He&rsquo;s mean.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony chuckled slightly knowing that his kid was still pretty out of it. He just hoped he could somehow convince the man to let him take Peter&rsquo;s place. He didn&rsquo;t know what was even being injected into his kid but it definitely was affected him. </p><p>The two of them didn&rsquo;t say anything after that, they instead sat in silence as Tony counted down the minutes until the man returned. </p><p>____</p><p>The door slammed open as a fully aware Peter head jerked up almost hitting Tony. The grip around his kid tightened as the man walked in with multiple needles. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m back with the good stuff.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare touch him,&rdquo; Tony said placing Peter behind him. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not in control here Stark. I am,&rdquo; The man sneered before roughly grabbing him from Peter&rsquo;s own grasp. </p><p>Struggling against his attacker, Tony managed to get a few good hits in until he was shoved into a wall. The man pulls him in a choke hold as black dots filled his vision. When the man finally let go one of his hands were already bound to the wall in chains. </p><p>Tony gasped trying to steady his breathing as he yanked against the chain. Peter himself tried getting free but he was already being pinned by the man. </p><p>&ldquo;Now hold still I wanna see what this dosage does.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo;</i> Peter squirmed. </p><p>His body spasm again the moment the needle hit his neck. He gagged tears falling from his face as the man stood back cheering. Tony was going to him, he already knew that but what he didn&rsquo;t know if Peter was going to make it out alive. </p><p>Unlike last time Peter&rsquo;s seizure lasted almost three minutes and he was barely awake when he stopped. The man didn&rsquo;t even wait, he took another syringe and injected Peter with it. His body jerked chains hitting the floor and Tony could look away. </p><p>The next hour Tony watched his kid be repeatedly subjected to whatever was in those syringes. He knew Peter was strong and he&rsquo;s added healing factor definitely would help him. But he still didn&rsquo;t know what would long-term effects. </p><p>When the man finally emptied the last syringe, Peter cried body still trembling. Tony was freed once again and the man left without another word smiling from ear to ear. </p><p>&ldquo;T&rsquo;ny.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here, I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo;</p><p>Peter whimpered movements still sluggish. &ldquo;I-I can&rsquo;t take a-anymore of that, I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;The team looking for us, don&rsquo;t worry Pete. They&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y-You promise?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony bit his lip trying not to panic himself. The team was looking for them, without a doubt but what he didn&rsquo;t know if they would find them in time. He couldn&rsquo;t help but picture Peter laying dead on the floor. His kid couldn&rsquo;t take much more of this, but he couldn&rsquo;t say that out loud. So he sighed combing through Peter&rsquo;s hair hoping that the team gets here soon. </p><hr /><p>Permanent Tags:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSAoXn7rDKTQ-SDQxNVGeAg\">@winteriscomingidjits</a> |

He had been asleep, his body preparing for the mother of all hangovers that would hit with consciousness. \u00a0His hotel room trashed, clothes scattered everywhere, and some naked groupie sprawled over him after some drug fuelled night of epic mistakes. \u00a0The high of being on stage always had one hell of a comedown and Tony tried to fill that void with anything that could temporarily make him feel good. \u00a0Nothing seemed to work as well as being with you. \u00a0</p><p>You\u2019d called him, looking so happy to finally see him as the video chat had kicked in. \u00a0The smile had quickly died on your lips as the blonde asleep behind him came into view and the way your lower lip had trembled would haunt him forever. \u00a0In his semi-conscious state, he hadn\u2019t registered why the change in you, and when you simply told him to \u2018enjoy the rest of his tour\u2019 before hanging up, he had simply frowned in confusion before a hand slid over his chest and realisation sank in. \u00a0</p><p>He\u2019d spent weeks trying to contact you, but all his calls went unanswered. \u00a0He\u2019d even tried getting Steve to talk to you, but after he had, Tony received a very strong lecture about hurting you and to stay away.</p><p>His fingers worked over the keys automatically as he sang. \u00a0The emotion resonating so deeply within him that he wasn\u2019t sure he would be able to finish the song. \u00a0You were the love of his life and he had hurt you, hurt you so badly. \u00a0As the song pleaded for you not to leave him the fear that he had lost you forever washed over him, leaving him hollow, a feeling he had never experienced on stage before. \u00a0This was his happy place. \u00a0This was where the adoration of strangers filled him up, kept him going when he couldn\u2019t love himself. \u00a0</p><p>Tears rolled down his cheeks, much to the confusion of his bandmates who exchanged concerned glances. The last thing they needed was for Tony to have a very public meltdown. \u00a0The song came to an end and with it Tony\u2019s hopes that maybe you would forgive him, that you could find a way through all this together. \u00a0</p><p>Getting to his feet, he straightened up, the show must go on. \u00a0Strutting around the stage and giving the performance of his life he let the cheers wash over him. \u00a0Another perfect show from the legend that was Tony Stark. \u00a0</p><p>Making his way backstage, he brushed past the groupies and the hangers on. \u00a0He felt so lost, so far from everything that was safe and familiar to him. \u00a0He had already written a future for you in his mind. \u00a0Seeing you with someone new, maybe Steve, yeah Steve was a good guy. He would be your shoulder to cry on and then you\u2019d realise he was everything Tony wasn\u2019t and cross that line with him. \u00a0Steve would make you happy. \u00a0You\u2019d get married, have children, live the life Tony could never give you. \u00a0Even through this mental torture he was putting himself through he knew, he knew he would love you until the day he died, which would be sooner rather than later if he kept up his current lifestyle. \u00a0</p><p>Entering his dressing room, he just wanted to clean himself up, get changed and then head to the hotel. He planned on trying to call you one last time, he needed to hear your voice, needed you. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHi Tony.\u201d The familiar voice startled him and he looked up in surprise, hoping this wasn\u2019t some drug fuelled hallucination before realising he hadn\u2019t actually taken anything yet. \u00a0You were really there, here. \u00a0Tentatively he crossed to you, he looked so lost and as he reached out he felt the hot tears stream down his cheeks again, blurring your face. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. \u00a0I\u2019m so so fucking sorry. \u00a0I love you. \u00a0I love you so much,\u201d he whimpered as you pulled him into your arms. \u00a0</p><p>You knew Tony wasn\u2019t an angel and you knew he loved you but that didn\u2019t excuse the stupid shit. \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t make me have to come on every tour with you,\u201d you scolded with the hint of a sigh. \u00a0The band had been calling you almost as much as Tony and when Rhodey had told you, convinced you how bad he really was, you\u2019d flown out, even if only to get some closure. \u00a0Seeing his performance, the way he had sang your song, you knew you\u2019d forgive him this one last time. \u00a0\u201cLast chance, Stark. \u00a0I can\u2019t keep doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he whispered against your shoulder. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll change. I- I can\u2019t lose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d \u00a0Those were the words he had wanted to hear from the one person he needed to hear them from. \u00a0Although things were cracked, a little broken maybe, he felt full in a way that the crowd never really managed. \u00a0They loved the persona, you loved the person and for that he was eternally grateful. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t fuck it up again,\u201d he promised. \u00a0And this time he really meant it.</p><p><b>Forever Tag List:</b></p><p><b>\u00a0</b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9k0sGvP1bj1FqTo228OFCQ\"></a><a

He had been asleep, his body preparing for the mother of all hangovers that would hit with consciousness. \u00a0His hotel room trashed, clothes scattered everywhere, and some naked groupie sprawled over him after some drug fuelled night of epic mistakes. \u00a0The high of being on stage always had one hell of a comedown and Tony tried to fill that void with anything that could temporarily make him feel good. \u00a0Nothing seemed to work as well as being with you. \u00a0</p><p>You\u2019d called him, looking so happy to finally see him as the video chat had kicked in. \u00a0The smile had quickly died on your lips as the blonde asleep behind him came into view and the way your lower lip had trembled would haunt him forever. \u00a0In his semi-conscious state, he hadn\u2019t registered why the change in you, and when you simply told him to \u2018enjoy the rest of his tour\u2019 before hanging up, he had simply frowned in confusion before a hand slid over his chest and realisation sank in. \u00a0</p><p>He\u2019d spent weeks trying to contact you, but all his calls went unanswered. \u00a0He\u2019d even tried getting Steve to talk to you, but after he had, Tony received a very strong lecture about hurting you and to stay away.</p><p>His fingers worked over the keys automatically as he sang. \u00a0The emotion resonating so deeply within him that he wasn\u2019t sure he would be able to finish the song. \u00a0You were the love of his life and he had hurt you, hurt you so badly. \u00a0As the song pleaded for you not to leave him the fear that he had lost you forever washed over him, leaving him hollow, a feeling he had never experienced on stage before. \u00a0This was his happy place. \u00a0This was where the adoration of strangers filled him up, kept him going when he couldn\u2019t love himself. \u00a0</p><p>Tears rolled down his cheeks, much to the confusion of his bandmates who exchanged concerned glances. The last thing they needed was for Tony to have a very public meltdown. \u00a0The song came to an end and with it Tony\u2019s hopes that maybe you would forgive him, that you could find a way through all this together. \u00a0</p><p>Getting to his feet, he straightened up, the show must go on. \u00a0Strutting around the stage and giving the performance of his life he let the cheers wash over him. \u00a0Another perfect show from the legend that was Tony Stark. \u00a0</p><p>Making his way backstage, he brushed past the groupies and the hangers on. \u00a0He felt so lost, so far from everything that was safe and familiar to him. \u00a0He had already written a future for you in his mind. \u00a0Seeing you with someone new, maybe Steve, yeah Steve was a good guy. He would be your shoulder to cry on and then you\u2019d realise he was everything Tony wasn\u2019t and cross that line with him. \u00a0Steve would make you happy. \u00a0You\u2019d get married, have children, live the life Tony could never give you. \u00a0Even through this mental torture he was putting himself through he knew, he knew he would love you until the day he died, which would be sooner rather than later if he kept up his current lifestyle. \u00a0</p><p>Entering his dressing room, he just wanted to clean himself up, get changed and then head to the hotel. He planned on trying to call you one last time, he needed to hear your voice, needed you. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHi Tony.\u201d The familiar voice startled him and he looked up in surprise, hoping this wasn\u2019t some drug fuelled hallucination before realising he hadn\u2019t actually taken anything yet. \u00a0You were really there, here. \u00a0Tentatively he crossed to you, he looked so lost and as he reached out he felt the hot tears stream down his cheeks again, blurring your face. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. \u00a0I\u2019m so so fucking sorry. \u00a0I love you. \u00a0I love you so much,\u201d he whimpered as you pulled him into your arms. \u00a0</p><p>You knew Tony wasn\u2019t an angel and you knew he loved you but that didn\u2019t excuse the stupid shit. \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t make me have to come on every tour with you,\u201d you scolded with the hint of a sigh. \u00a0The band had been calling you almost as much as Tony and when Rhodey had told you, convinced you how bad he really was, you\u2019d flown out, even if only to get some closure. \u00a0Seeing his performance, the way he had sang your song, you knew you\u2019d forgive him this one last time. \u00a0\u201cLast chance, Stark. \u00a0I can\u2019t keep doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he whispered against your shoulder. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll change. I- I can\u2019t lose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d \u00a0Those were the words he had wanted to hear from the one person he needed to hear them from. \u00a0Although things were cracked, a little broken maybe, he felt full in a way that the crowd never really managed. \u00a0They loved the persona, you loved the person and for that he was eternally grateful. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t fuck it up again,\u201d he promised. \u00a0And this time he really meant it.</p><p><b>Forever Tag List:</b></p><p><b>\u00a0</b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9k0sGvP1bj1FqTo228OFCQ\"></a><a

He had been asleep, his body preparing for the mother of all hangovers that would hit with consciousness. \u00a0His hotel room trashed, clothes scattered everywhere, and some naked groupie sprawled over him after some drug fuelled night of epic mistakes. \u00a0The high of being on stage always had one hell of a comedown and Tony tried to fill that void with anything that could temporarily make him feel good. \u00a0Nothing seemed to work as well as being with you. \u00a0</p><p>You\u2019d called him, looking so happy to finally see him as the video chat had kicked in. \u00a0The smile had quickly died on your lips as the blonde asleep behind him came into view and the way your lower lip had trembled would haunt him forever. \u00a0In his semi-conscious state, he hadn\u2019t registered why the change in you, and when you simply told him to \u2018enjoy the rest of his tour\u2019 before hanging up, he had simply frowned in confusion before a hand slid over his chest and realisation sank in. \u00a0</p><p>He\u2019d spent weeks trying to contact you, but all his calls went unanswered. \u00a0He\u2019d even tried getting Steve to talk to you, but after he had, Tony received a very strong lecture about hurting you and to stay away.</p><p>His fingers worked over the keys automatically as he sang. \u00a0The emotion resonating so deeply within him that he wasn\u2019t sure he would be able to finish the song. \u00a0You were the love of his life and he had hurt you, hurt you so badly. \u00a0As the song pleaded for you not to leave him the fear that he had lost you forever washed over him, leaving him hollow, a feeling he had never experienced on stage before. \u00a0This was his happy place. \u00a0This was where the adoration of strangers filled him up, kept him going when he couldn\u2019t love himself. \u00a0</p><p>Tears rolled down his cheeks, much to the confusion of his bandmates who exchanged concerned glances. The last thing they needed was for Tony to have a very public meltdown. \u00a0The song came to an end and with it Tony\u2019s hopes that maybe you would forgive him, that you could find a way through all this together. \u00a0</p><p>Getting to his feet, he straightened up, the show must go on. \u00a0Strutting around the stage and giving the performance of his life he let the cheers wash over him. \u00a0Another perfect show from the legend that was Tony Stark. \u00a0</p><p>Making his way backstage, he brushed past the groupies and the hangers on. \u00a0He felt so lost, so far from everything that was safe and familiar to him. \u00a0He had already written a future for you in his mind. \u00a0Seeing you with someone new, maybe Steve, yeah Steve was a good guy. He would be your shoulder to cry on and then you\u2019d realise he was everything Tony wasn\u2019t and cross that line with him. \u00a0Steve would make you happy. \u00a0You\u2019d get married, have children, live the life Tony could never give you. \u00a0Even through this mental torture he was putting himself through he knew, he knew he would love you until the day he died, which would be sooner rather than later if he kept up his current lifestyle. \u00a0</p><p>Entering his dressing room, he just wanted to clean himself up, get changed and then head to the hotel. He planned on trying to call you one last time, he needed to hear your voice, needed you. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHi Tony.\u201d The familiar voice startled him and he looked up in surprise, hoping this wasn\u2019t some drug fuelled hallucination before realising he hadn\u2019t actually taken anything yet. \u00a0You were really there, here. \u00a0Tentatively he crossed to you, he looked so lost and as he reached out he felt the hot tears stream down his cheeks again, blurring your face. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. \u00a0I\u2019m so so fucking sorry. \u00a0I love you. \u00a0I love you so much,\u201d he whimpered as you pulled him into your arms. \u00a0</p><p>You knew Tony wasn\u2019t an angel and you knew he loved you but that didn\u2019t excuse the stupid shit. \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t make me have to come on every tour with you,\u201d you scolded with the hint of a sigh. \u00a0The band had been calling you almost as much as Tony and when Rhodey had told you, convinced you how bad he really was, you\u2019d flown out, even if only to get some closure. \u00a0Seeing his performance, the way he had sang your song, you knew you\u2019d forgive him this one last time. \u00a0\u201cLast chance, Stark. \u00a0I can\u2019t keep doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he whispered against your shoulder. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll change. I- I can\u2019t lose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d \u00a0Those were the words he had wanted to hear from the one person he needed to hear them from. \u00a0Although things were cracked, a little broken maybe, he felt full in a way that the crowd never really managed. \u00a0They loved the persona, you loved the person and for that he was eternally grateful. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t fuck it up again,\u201d he promised. \u00a0And this time he really meant it.</p><p><b>Forever Tag List:</b></p><p><b>\u00a0</b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9k0sGvP1bj1FqTo228OFCQ\"></a><a

he promised. &nbsp;And this time he really meant it.</p><p><b>Forever Tag List:</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9k0sGvP1bj1FqTo228OFCQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9k0sGvP1bj1FqTo228OFCQ\">@deanxfuckingadorablexwinchester</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQBE9t0d1khSgw3O2jaEc8Q\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQBE9t0d1khSgw3O2jaEc8Q\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQBE9t0d1khSgw3O2jaEc8Q\">@nea90sweetie</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvMiN6Oxg_j8gCfezKzI3RA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvMiN6Oxg_j8gCfezKzI3RA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvMiN6Oxg_j8gCfezKzI3RA\">@knittingknerdy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD5U_u9GKDf0_WMKwI1CjkQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD5U_u9GKDf0_WMKwI1CjkQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD5U_u9GKDf0_WMKwI1CjkQ\">@feelmyroarrrr</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-ldJ0mGeQgRQu3-35PayeQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-ldJ0mGeQgRQu3-35PayeQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-ldJ0mGeQgRQu3-35PayeQ\">@vintagevalentinexx</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0J2DiVi1ZuUGTAV9Raa3SQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0J2DiVi1ZuUGTAV9Raa3SQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0J2DiVi1ZuUGTAV9Raa3SQ\">@cojootromuelle</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpXlRHr4MxgfZ6YKlOISUxQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpXlRHr4MxgfZ6YKlOISUxQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpXlRHr4MxgfZ6YKlOISUxQ\">@palaiasaurus64</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1JcuEvcBKex7bIMcOhkyjA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1JcuEvcBKex7bIMcOhkyjA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1JcuEvcBKex7bIMcOhkyjA\">@littleblue5mcdork</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNWqRXrO5FIzOcrX7HJes-A\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNWqRXrO5FIzOcrX7HJes-A\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNWqRXrO5FIzOcrX7HJes-A\">@littlenerdgirl16</a> @mysteriously-lost <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpquOJZoB3oFxdmNZ4jlh9A\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpquOJZoB3oFxdmNZ4jlh9A\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpquOJZoB3oFxdmNZ4jlh9A\">@luckynumber1213</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw3O4auxrjvmivdWA24VBRQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw3O4auxrjvmivdWA24VBRQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw3O4auxrjvmivdWA24VBRQ\">@sheacrowley</a> &nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUgfAIVQq8Jxtjs4wgO436w\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUgfAIVQq8Jxtjs4wgO436w\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUgfAIVQq8Jxtjs4wgO436w\">@billsxbabyxgirl</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvp3BCrPWMwU2LPiWe4uHPQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvp3BCrPWMwU2LPiWe4uHPQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvp3BCrPWMwU2LPiWe4uHPQ\">@cutelittlepurplesouls</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7CsHBGCX8RYJgYJ4m3WnHQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7CsHBGCX8RYJgYJ4m3WnHQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7CsHBGCX8RYJgYJ4m3WnHQ\">@wildefire</a></p><p><b>Marvel Tag List:</b></p><p> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBEwYdsGn1TDqZw-U3TE2Iw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBEwYdsGn1TDqZw-U3TE2Iw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBEwYdsGn1TDqZw-U3TE2Iw\">@iwillbeinmynest</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFvfn0hPhhbSNvOfB6-asYg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFvfn0hPhhbSNvOfB6-asYg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFvfn0hPhhbSNvOfB6-asYg\">@buckyhawk</a> @almondbuttercup <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUKntgME_gSTx25Eqzqegtg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUKntgME_gSTx25Eqzqegtg\">@lilmissperfectlyimperfect</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2L-oF3X0yqPaRLZAZ6frRA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2L-oF3X0yqPaRLZAZ6frRA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2L-oF3X0yqPaRLZAZ6frRA\">@callamint</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAanDdJ6BwtTaNNM1noqIsQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAanDdJ6BwtTaNNM1noqIsQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAanDdJ6BwtTaNNM1noqIsQ\">@like-a-bag-of-potatoes</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGN-ZH817h6cpAx5_vWytrQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGN-ZH817h6cpAx5_vWytrQ\">@ancoowner</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBnPqVvNbOovPaMh28e7rcg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBnPqVvNbOovPaMh28e7rcg\">@sebstanchrisevanchickforever19</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvxoU-t_wU95BXM3NjfzULA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvxoU-t_wU95BXM3NjfzULA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvxoU-t_wU95BXM3NjfzULA\">@sunskittlex</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMAhup3r1MAytdl99nusiKQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMAhup3r1MAytdl99nusiKQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMAhup3r1MAytdl99nusiKQ\">@littlemisssyreid</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDjuWU1ztmQE7StGSDO3iBA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDjuWU1ztmQE7StGSDO3iBA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDjuWU1ztmQE7StGSDO3iBA\">@delicatecapnerd</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx92Ca0bmTX9IHcJIKCwOQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx92Ca0bmTX9IHcJIKCwOQ\">@patzammit</a></p></p>",

        "body": "<p><b>Summary:</b></p><p>\n\nSteve, Tony, and Peter grab the telescope and head out for a nighttime picnic under the blood moon. They all know the blood moon is just an excuse for the outing, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter. It&rsquo;s a beautiful sight and Peter can have some alone time with his dads. The tower was great, but sometimes it got to be a little overwhelming, and Peter had only been there for a couple years now. It was nothing like growing up with Aunt May and Uncle Ben.\n\n<br/></p><!-- more --><hr><p><b></b></p><p>\t\u201cThen if you turn this knob here,\u201d Tony indicated the knob on the side of the eyepiece, \u201cYou can adjust how focused it is.\u201d He stepped back, and let Peter take a look. The blood moon was plenty visible without the telescope, of course, but this was more fun. Plus Steve had convinced them to make is a nighttime picnic. Tony settled onto the blanket beside Steve while Peter fiddled with the telescope. They held up their wine glasses, \u201cCheers to our little genius.\u201d</p><p>\tWhen Peter seemed satisfied with his understanding of the telescope, he came back to the blanket. \u201cHey dads?\u201d He fidgeted, not sitting down.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Steve asked, Peter was rarely nervous to ask them for things by now. He had been living in the tower for two years now, Aunt May having supported the adoption wholeheartedly. She still got to remain in Peter\u2019s life, and he got to live with parents a little more\u2026 suited to his needs. May was great, but not a superhero. Plus she had never wanted him to see her as his mom anyway. Just a cool aunt.</p><p>\t\u201cCan I try wine?\u201d Peter blushed.</p><p>\tTony burst out laughing, and Peter blushed deeper. Steve punched the man. \u201cOw! Hey!\u201d Steve glared at the man, and Tony met it defiantly, before laughing again. \u201cDefinitely not,\u201d he answered at the same time that Steve said \u2018sure, why not?\u2019</p><p>\tPeter looked between them, confused. He plopped down onto the blanket. \u201cOh-kayyy, I see this needs discussing.\u201d</p><p>\tSteve turned to his partner, surprised. \u201cHe\u2019s nearly eighteen, why don\u2019t you want him to be able to try it?\u201d</p><p>\tTony looked just as surprised. \u201cHe\u2019s a child! Why do you want him drinking already?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s not like he\u2019s asking to start drinking regularly, he wants to try a sip of wine.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take much to get started, believe me.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cPeter is a good kid, he could\u2019ve easily just drank elsewhere but he asked us first.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI know Peter\u2019s a good kid, Steve, that\u2019s not what this is about.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cThen what is it about? Is this about you and Howard?\u201d </p><p>Peter watched his dads argue, looking back and forth between them. This is exactly why he hadn\u2019t wanted to ask. A perfectly nice family picnic had become a small feud. He laid back with a sigh, staring up at the blood moon. Tuning them out was getting easier. Peter loved them so much, all of the avengers family, but boy could they turn the smallest disagreement into the largest fight. He supposed it probably had to do with living in a constant battle-ready state. Maybe he should stark taking notes on them all. The Psychology of Superheroes. It could be a thesis in grad school or something. Even though the plan was still chemistry. Tony had multiple PhDs, why not him?</p><p>\u201cYes, Steve, because everything with me is always about Howard,\u201d Tony bit out sarcastically.</p><p>Steve growled in frustration. \u201cWell? Kind of! What am I supposed to think when a normally reasonable man won\u2019t let his 17 year old son have a taste of wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019m being completely unreasonable. Yep, that must be it, you\u2019re right, what was I thinking? Not, maybe that I wanted to have a longer discussion about alcohol with you and our son before he started drinking. That I\u2019d like there to be some ground rules and maybe give some warnings of my own. Nope, Steve is the level-headed reasonable one, always, and I\u2019m just a neurotic scientist.\u201d</p><p>Peter had had enough. He sat up while Tony ranted, watching his face carefully.

Peter was blushing now, but happy the night had turned around again. They ate and talked, and Tony played catch the grapes with Peter while Steve judged. It was a good night. Tony decided he should look into more astronomy excuses to take his family on night time picnics. Getting away from the tower was good for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p><b>Summary:</b></p>\n<p>\n\nSteve, Tony, and Peter grab the telescope and head out for a nighttime picnic under the blood moon. They all know the blood moon is just an excuse for the outing, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter. It&rsquo;s a beautiful sight and Peter can have some alone time with his dads. The tower was great, but sometimes it got to be a little overwhelming, and Peter had only been there for a couple years now. It was nothing like growing up with Aunt May and Uncle Ben.\n\n<br /></p>\n</p>",
