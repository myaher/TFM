        "answer": "<p>i went looking for a nice detailed post i could hook you up with like i did with gendry but\u2026..apparently i never did that for arya lol. to my own surprise. so lets do it.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Where there is a way in, there is a way out. Fear cuts deeper than swords. Arya would not be afraid. (AGOT)</p></blockquote><p>ive always subscribed to the belief that its our values not our abilities that determines who we are. arya can be extremely cunning (and resourceful for that matter) but is that what she values in her heart? i don\u2019t think so. she values bravery and strength, honesty and loyalty far more. which is why she tends to be a gryffindor/hufflepuff hatstall for me. like its really close. but i think bravery might be the most important trait for arya as far as sorting goes which is why i usually lean gryffindor. its not that arya\u2019s unfailing brave. she\u2019s not. she\u2019s scared a lot but she usually pushes through it so she can act. which is real bravery. but when she cant overcome that fear? it destroys her. it harms her self worth. it makes arya hate herself. which is how we know how much it means to her. bravery is a crucial building block in her identity:</p><!-- more --><blockquote><p>The direwolf was the sigil of the Starks, but Arya felt more a lamb, surrounded by a herd of other sheep. She hated the villagers for their sheepishness, almost as much as she hated herself. The Lannisters had taken everything: father, friends, home, hope, courage. (ACOK)\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>they took her courage from her and it devastates arya. courage and the ability to act on it means everything to her. she hates herself for being \u201csheepish\u201d even though she\u2019s only a little girl, unarmed and scrawny, surrounded by murderers and rapists. like she hates herself\u2026..for not fighting the mountain. she wants to fight the bad guys. because if she doesnt no one will. gryffindor\u2019s words are \u201cfight me\u201d right?\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Arya glanced sidelong at Needle, sheathed at the hip of a black-bearded, balding man-at-arms called Polliver. It\u2019s good that they took it away, she thought. Otherwise she would have tried to stab Ser Gregor, and he would have cut her right in half, and the wolves would eat her too. (ACOK)</p></blockquote><p>after this trauma she prays to the old gods to make her \u201cnot afraid again, ever.\u201d arya cannot stand to feel that way. she cannot watch injustice and do nothing. what arya wants the most - from herself - is to be brave. the old gods give arya her bravery back too. they\u2019re usually silent but they speak to arya and that gives her the courage to plan her (daring) escape.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>She was only ten, a skinny girl on a stolen horse with a dark forest ahead of her and men behind who would gladly cut off her feet.

                "content": "<p>i went looking for a nice detailed post i could hook you up with like i did with gendry but&hellip;..apparently i never did that for arya lol. to my own surprise. so lets do it.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Where there is a way in, there is a way out. Fear cuts deeper than swords. Arya would not be afraid. (AGOT)</p></blockquote><p>ive always subscribed to the belief that its our values not our abilities that determines who we are. arya can be extremely cunning (and resourceful for that matter) but is that what she values in her heart? i don&rsquo;t think so. she values bravery and strength, honesty and loyalty far more. which is why she tends to be a gryffindor/hufflepuff hatstall for me. like its really close. but i think bravery might be the most important trait for arya as far as sorting goes which is why i usually lean gryffindor. its not that arya&rsquo;s unfailing brave. she&rsquo;s not. she&rsquo;s scared a lot but she usually pushes through it so she can act. which is real bravery. but when she cant overcome that fear? it destroys her. it harms her self worth. it makes arya hate herself. which is how we know how much it means to her. bravery is a crucial building block in her identity:</p><blockquote><p>The direwolf was the sigil of the Starks, but Arya felt more a lamb, surrounded by a herd of other sheep. She hated the villagers for their sheepishness, almost as much as she hated herself. The Lannisters had taken everything: father, friends, home, hope, courage. (ACOK)&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>they took her courage from her and it devastates arya. courage and the ability to act on it means everything to her. she hates herself for being &ldquo;sheepish&rdquo; even though she&rsquo;s only a little girl, unarmed and scrawny, surrounded by murderers and rapists. like she hates herself&hellip;..for not fighting the mountain. she wants to fight the bad guys. because if she doesnt no one will. gryffindor&rsquo;s words are &ldquo;fight me&rdquo; right?&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Arya glanced sidelong at Needle, sheathed at the hip of a black-bearded, balding man-at-arms called Polliver. It&rsquo;s good that they took it away, she thought. Otherwise she would have tried to stab Ser Gregor, and he would have cut her right in half, and the wolves would eat her too. (ACOK)</p></blockquote><p>after this trauma she prays to the old gods to make her &ldquo;not afraid again, ever.&rdquo; arya cannot stand to feel that way. she cannot watch injustice and do nothing. what arya wants the most - from herself - is to be brave. the old gods give arya her bravery back too. they&rsquo;re usually silent but they speak to arya and that gives her the courage to plan her (daring) escape.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>She was only ten, a skinny girl on a stolen horse with a dark forest ahead of her and men behind who would gladly cut off her feet. Yet somehow she felt calmer than she ever had in Harrenhal. The rain had washed the guard&rsquo;s blood off her fingers, she wore a sword across her back, wolves were prowling through the dark like lean grey shadows, and Arya Stark was unafraid. (ASOS)<br /></p></blockquote><p>this is arya in her element. this is how she wants to feel: unafraid.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>I am a wolf, and will not be afraid. She patted Needle&rsquo;s hilt for luck and plunged into the shadows, taking the steps two at a time so no one could ever say she&rsquo;d been afraid. (AFFC)<br /></p></blockquote><p>arya doesnt want people ever saying she&rsquo;s not brave either. they can call her ugly or stupid but dont you dare say she&rsquo;s a coward. i mean there&rsquo;s countless quotes here people. arya is obsessed with bravery.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;A boy has more courage than sense,&rdquo; the one who had named himself Jaqen H'ghar observed. (ACOK)&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>it doesnt get more gryffindor than that&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>She tried so hard to be brave, to be fierce as a wolverine and all, but sometimes she felt like she was just a little girl after all. (ACOK)</p></blockquote><p>its seriously character defining. arya doesnt want (cant afford to be) a scared little girl. that would get her killed as she navigates a literal warzone, a haunted castle and foreign city.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&hellip;but Arya could not love a coward. (ASOS)</p></blockquote><p>and bravery is what she expects from others. arya hates when people are craven. she demands the same courage from others as she does herself. if they aren&rsquo;t she looks on them with disappointment and/or scorn. she flips on gendry for being &ldquo;afraid&rdquo; when he won&rsquo;t help her take out the harrenhal guards even though its not necessarily fear but common sense. this is the same thing she tried to do when she wanted to save gendry and she got caught. which gendry points out. her plan was ridiculous but arya doesnt care. she needs to do whats right. she&rsquo;s furious with gendry&rsquo;s for not jumping onto her suicide mission band wagon (its only then that she resorts to tricking jaqen)&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Arya&rsquo;s hands curled into helpless fists. &ldquo;The next helm you make, put mule&rsquo;s ears on it in place of bull&rsquo;s horns!&rdquo; She had to flee, or else she would have started hitting him.(ACOK)&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>and we see how heartbroken she is after the trident when her men do nothing as mycah is murdered. that includes her own father. the man arya loves and looks up to. that hurts the most.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>And no one had raised a voice or drawn a blade or anything, not Harwin who always talked so bold, or Alyn who was going to be a knight, or Jory who was captain of the guard. Not even her father. (AGOT)</p></blockquote><p>but arya did raise her voice and draw her weapon against the prince. she defied the crown. she&rsquo;s that daring. no other character in this scene dared do that. arya tries to surrender to the gold cloaks too because she doesnt want anyone dying for her. she risked her life during the battle to save others including a toddler most others left for dead. she even ran through fire to help a couple degenerates locked in a cage. the actual knights in westeros need to take note because thats what chivalry looks like.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;You are a murderer!&rdquo; she screamed. &ldquo;You killed Mycah, don&rsquo;t say you never did.

Arya is 19, Jaqen is 28, she\u2019s a student, he\u2019s a teacher, attraction in inevitable :) :) First published on AO3 as a gift for one of my lovely readers xoxoxo</p><p><br/></p><p>Arya Stark decided to start the day visiting professor H'ghar. This time she didn&rsquo;t even need an excuse, he said they could expect their papers returned this week. He didn&rsquo;t say it would happen on Monday morning but it didn&rsquo;t hurt to ask.</p><p>No one answered when she knocked on the door but she turned the knob and went in anyway.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>His office was a roomy but cozy place with lots of books, a huge oak desk in the center and a couple of old comfy armchairs in front of it. A leather sofa between the door and the fireplace gave the room a homely look. Arya loved it here, it felt like home.</p><p>His desk was neatly organized, with a laptop and other things but what drew her attention was a large book with a colorful illustration on the cover. Arya reached for it. This could be the theme of their next class ! She gasped when she read the title :</p><p><i>Erotic Art of Essos</i></p><p>The book was visually stunning, with hundreds of beautiful illustrations printed on fine glossy paper. Each page presented a picture of a person or persons engaged in sexual activity, be it pleasuring themselves or making love. Many of these pictures were photographs, others were fine line drawings and paintings. Arya chewed on her lower lip, feeling a blush spreading on her cheeks. It seemed that the temperature in the room raised a couple of degrees.</p><p>The women in these pictures were exposing themselves to the men in ways unimaginable. And the men&hellip;the men were sucking on them, licking, probing, kissing. Their members were swollen and ready, their skin seemed like velvet.</p><p>Arya flipped a couple of pages forward, oh there was so much to see and so little time ! She got to the middle of the book and saw an ancient painting spread across two pages. <i>The King&rsquo;s Passion or the Art of Worship</i> she read. A man was kissing the breasts of his lover, his manhood playing at her entrance about to push inside, his fingers were toying with her petals. The girl&rsquo;s delicate features bore an expression of divine ecstasy.</p><p>She read the description under the picture and she learned that king Jaehaerys was particularly fond of that position because it gave his beloved queen the ultimate pleasure. On the next page she saw a modern photograph mimicking the painting.</p><p>Seven hells ! Were people really doing those things ? Were men really so willing to give ? Why weren&rsquo;t guys in college like king Jaehaerys ?! Was professor H'ghar ?&hellip;Arya curled her toes.</p><p>She turned another page and spotted a small card with a handwritten text in common tongue. </p><p>Pushing the guilt aside, she began to read :</p><p><i>Your tormenting beauty, my lovely one</i></p><p><i>An innocent flower, my cruel one</i></p><p><i>That blossoms under the hungry gaze</i></p><p><i>A goddess born to be worshiped</i></p><p><i>A slave bent to your will</i></p><p><i>My heart, my mind, my sex</i></p><p>Arya sighed. It was&hellip;it was the true thing ! She didn&rsquo;t expect love could be so passionate and shameless yet touching and tender.</p><p>She heard the barely audible sound of the footsteps in the hall and she knew it was him. Professor H'ghar always walked so quietly.</p><p>Arya shut the book quickly and stood by the desk taking, she hoped, a casual pose.</p><p>The door opened and professor H'ghar stepped in with his motorcycle helmet tucked under his arm. He smirked without even looking at her.</p><p>&lsquo;Did you just search through my things, stealthy girl ?&rsquo;</p><p>He put his helmet on the sofa then shrugged his leather jacket off and tossed it on the coat rack.</p><p>'Of course not !&rsquo; She lied. 'Professor H'ghar, I would never do that !&rsquo;</p><p>Jaqen H'ghar walked towards Arya and stood next to her leaning against the desk. He was younger than other professors and beyond handsome with his windswept red hair and quirky mouth. Arya could smell the scent of autumn air, smoke and leaves, mixed with his cologne, ginger and cloves. Good smells.</p><p>He raised his eyebrow questioningly.</p><p>'What brings you here, Arya ?&rsquo;</p><p>Arya relaxed, grateful she could change the subject.</p><p>'I came to ask about my essay. Did you read it ?&rsquo;</p><p>'Lovely girl.&rsquo; He started softly, his voice was warm like melted chocolate. 'All students will be informed about their grades.&rsquo; He flashed a disarming smile. 'When the day comes.&rsquo;</p><p>'But&hellip;&rsquo;</p><p>'A man has said.&rsquo; He cut her off firmly.</p><p>Classic professor H'ghar ! Silk and steel. Some of the students felt intimidated by him, Gendry most of all, but Arya never understood why. She liked his sweet Lorathi accent as much as the iron tones that rang in his voice at times. She enjoyed both faces of Jaqen H'ghar. And the third one she had just discovered. She bit her lip trying hard to suppress a treacherous grin.</p><p>'Did you like it ?&rsquo; He asked casually.</p><p>'Liked what ?&rsquo;</p><p>'The poem.&rsquo;</p><p>'Which one ?&rsquo; Arya blushed but smiled sweetly. 'I&rsquo;ve read all your poems. All published ones.&rsquo; She said, all innocence.</p><p>'Another lie !&rsquo; He sighed in mock sadness. 'You must lie better.&rsquo;</p><p>Arya chewed on her lip. <i>I loved it ! I wish you spoke to me like you speak to her whoever she is. And do those things I&rsquo;ve seen.</i></p><p>'Well ?&rsquo; He pressed.</p><p>'Yes.&rsquo; She answered honestly this time. 'Is it about your wife ?&rsquo;</p><p>Arya wondered what kind of a woman affected Jaqen H'ghar like this.</p><p>'My wife and I are happily divorced.&rsquo;</p><p>'Oh. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rsquo; Three lies in a row. She was on fire !</p><p>His mouth quirked with amusement as if he saw through her lie. Again.</p><p>'I am not.&rsquo;</p><p>'Then who is it about ?&rsquo;</p><p><i>Who is this innocent cruel flower you dream to worship ? </i>Oh, those words alone made her feel like, like&hellip; She didn&rsquo;t know like what.</p><p>'Is this the sort of question you ask your teacher ?&rsquo;</p><p>'You started it !&rsquo;</p><p>'Fair enough !&rsquo; He chuckled. 'It&rsquo;s about someone else entirely.&rsquo;</p><p>Arya understood professor H'ghar was bent on keeping his secret to himself.</p><p>'She is very lucky.&rsquo; She prompted.</p><p>A gleam of interest sparked in his eyes.</p><p>'You think ?&rsquo;</p><p>She could swear she heard something new in his deep voice but she couldn&rsquo;t explain what it was.</p><p>'She must be !&rsquo; She assured. 'To receive such a beautiful gift ! I would like to write poems like this one someday.&rsquo;</p><p>'You are a beautiful poem yourself, Arya.&rsquo; He murmured, his gaze pierced her with its intensity. He walked around her and took a seat behind the desk. A whiff of ginger and cloves lingered in the air.</p><p>Arya turned around to look at him.</p><p>'I&rsquo;m a what ?!&rsquo;</p><p>She had been called many names by him, a greedy girl and evil cat among others, but never a poem.</p><p>Jaqen H'ghar tapped his fingers on the cover of the book which Arya was now dying to inspect further. She was sure the book held more of his secrets and she wanted to steal them all, one by one. And she had a sneaking suspicion professor H'ghar knew about it.</p><p>He opened one of the drawers in his desk, the third from the top on the left, Arya noted. He put the book inside then he ostentatiously locked the drawer and tucked the key into his pocket.</p><p>'Go now, girl.&rsquo; He said, opening his laptop. 'A man has duties.&rsquo; When she didn&rsquo;t make a move to leave he repeated firmly. 'A man has said.&rsquo; </p>",

Arya is 19, Jaqen is 28, she\u2019s a student, he\u2019s a teacher, attraction in inevitable :) :) First published on AO3 as a gift for one of my lovely readers xoxoxo</p><p><br></p><p>Arya Stark decided to start the day visiting professor H'ghar. This time she didn\u2019t even need an excuse, he said they could expect their papers returned this week. He didn\u2019t say it would happen on Monday morning but it didn\u2019t hurt to ask.</p><p>No one answered when she knocked on the door but she turned the knob and went in anyway.\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>His office was a roomy but cozy place with lots of books, a huge oak desk in the center and a couple of old comfy armchairs in front of it. A leather sofa between the door and the fireplace gave the room a homely look. Arya loved it here, it felt like home.</p><p>His desk was neatly organized, with a laptop and other things but what drew her attention was a large book with a colorful illustration on the cover. Arya reached for it. This could be the theme of their next class ! She gasped when she read the title :</p><p><i>Erotic Art of Essos</i></p><p>The book was visually stunning, with hundreds of beautiful illustrations printed on fine glossy paper. Each page presented a picture of a person or persons engaged in sexual activity, be it pleasuring themselves or making love. Many of these pictures were photographs, others were fine line drawings and paintings. Arya chewed on her lower lip, feeling a blush spreading on her cheeks. It seemed that the temperature in the room raised a couple of degrees.</p><p>The women in these pictures were exposing themselves to the men in ways unimaginable. And the men\u2026the men were sucking on them, licking, probing, kissing. Their members were swollen and ready, their skin seemed like velvet.</p><p>Arya flipped a couple of pages forward, oh there was so much to see and so little time ! She got to the middle of the book and saw an ancient painting spread across two pages. <i>The King\u2019s Passion or the Art of Worship</i> she read. A man was kissing the breasts of his lover, his manhood playing at her entrance about to push inside, his fingers were toying with her petals. The girl\u2019s delicate features bore an expression of divine ecstasy.</p><p>She read the description under the picture and she learned that king Jaehaerys was particularly fond of that position because it gave his beloved queen the ultimate pleasure. On the next page she saw a modern photograph mimicking the painting.</p><p>Seven hells ! Were people really doing those things ? Were men really so willing to give ? Why weren\u2019t guys in college like king Jaehaerys ?! Was professor H'ghar ?\u2026Arya curled her toes.</p><p>She turned another page and spotted a small card with a handwritten text in common tongue. </p><p>Pushing the guilt aside, she began to read :</p><p><i>Your tormenting beauty, my lovely one</i></p><p><i>An innocent flower, my cruel one</i></p><p><i>That blossoms under the hungry gaze</i></p><p><i>A goddess born to be worshiped</i></p><p><i>A slave bent to your will</i></p><p><i>My heart, my mind, my sex</i></p><p>Arya sighed. It was\u2026it was the true thing ! She didn\u2019t expect love could be so passionate and shameless yet touching and tender.</p><p>She heard the barely audible sound of the footsteps in the hall and she knew it was him. Professor H'ghar always walked so quietly.</p><p>Arya shut the book quickly and stood by the desk taking, she hoped, a casual pose.</p><p>The door opened and professor H'ghar stepped in with his motorcycle helmet tucked under his arm. He smirked without even looking at her.</p><p>\u2018Did you just search through my things, stealthy girl ?\u2019</p><p>He put his helmet on the sofa then shrugged his leather jacket off and tossed it on the coat rack.</p><p>'Of course not !\u2019 She lied. 'Professor H'ghar, I would never do that !\u2019</p><p>Jaqen H'ghar walked towards Arya and stood next to her leaning against the desk. He was younger than other professors and beyond handsome with his windswept red hair and quirky mouth. Arya could smell the scent of autumn air, smoke and leaves, mixed with his cologne, ginger and cloves. Good smells.</p><p>He raised his eyebrow questioningly.</p><p>'What brings you here, Arya ?\u2019</p><p>Arya relaxed, grateful she could change the subject.</p><p>'I came to ask about my essay. Did you read it ?\u2019</p><p>'Lovely girl.\u2019 He started softly, his voice was warm like melted chocolate. 'All students will be informed about their grades.\u2019 He flashed a disarming smile. 'When the day comes.\u2019</p><p>'But\u2026\u2019</p><p>'A man has said.\u2019 He cut her off firmly.</p><p>Classic professor H'ghar ! Silk and steel. Some of the students felt intimidated by him, Gendry most of all, but Arya never understood why. She liked his sweet Lorathi accent as much as the iron tones that rang in his voice at times. She enjoyed both faces of Jaqen H'ghar. And the third one she had just discovered. She bit her lip trying hard to suppress a treacherous grin.</p><p>'Did you like it ?\u2019 He asked casually.</p><p>'Liked what ?\u2019</p><p>'The poem.\u2019</p><p>'Which one ?\u2019 Arya blushed but smiled sweetly. 'I\u2019ve read all your poems. All published ones.\u2019 She said, all innocence.</p><p>'Another lie !\u2019 He sighed in mock sadness. 'You must lie better.\u2019</p><p>Arya chewed on her lip. <i>I loved it ! I wish you spoke to me like you speak to her whoever she is. And do those things I\u2019ve seen.</i></p><p>'Well ?\u2019 He pressed.</p><p>'Yes.\u2019 She answered honestly this time. 'Is it about your wife ?\u2019</p><p>Arya wondered what kind of a woman affected Jaqen H'ghar like this.</p><p>'My wife and I are happily divorced.\u2019</p><p>'Oh. I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 Three lies in a row. She was on fire !</p><p>His mouth quirked with amusement as if he saw through her lie. Again.</p><p>'I am not.\u2019</p><p>'Then who is it about ?\u2019</p><p><i>Who is this innocent cruel flower you dream to worship ? </i>Oh, those words alone made her feel like, like\u2026 She didn\u2019t know like what.</p><p>'Is this the sort of question you ask your teacher ?\u2019</p><p>'You started it !\u2019</p><p>'Fair enough !\u2019 He chuckled. 'It\u2019s about someone else entirely.\u2019</p><p>Arya understood professor H'ghar was bent on keeping his secret to himself.</p><p>'She is very lucky.\u2019 She prompted.</p><p>A gleam of interest sparked in his eyes.</p><p>'You think ?\u2019</p><p>She could swear she heard something new in his deep voice but she couldn\u2019t explain what it was.</p><p>'She must be !\u2019 She assured. 'To receive such a beautiful gift ! I would like to write poems like this one someday.\u2019</p><p>'You are a beautiful poem yourself, Arya.\u2019 He murmured, his gaze pierced her with its intensity. He walked around her and took a seat behind the desk. A whiff of ginger and cloves lingered in the air.</p><p>Arya turned around to look at him.</p><p>'I\u2019m a what ?!\u2019</p><p>She had been called many names by him, a greedy girl and evil cat among others, but never a poem.</p><p>Jaqen H'ghar tapped his fingers on the cover of the book which Arya was now dying to inspect further. She was sure the book held more of his secrets and she wanted to steal them all, one by one.

He put the book inside then he ostentatiously locked the drawer and tucked the key into his pocket.</p><p>'Go now, girl.\u2019 He said, opening his laptop. 'A man has duties.\u2019 When she didn\u2019t make a move to leave he repeated firmly. 'A man has said.\u2019 </p>",
