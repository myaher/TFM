Watching an equally bright smile spread over her lips. You had been friends with Carol since you were little; You grew up together. After everything that happened between her becoming a pilot and her apparent accident, there was nothing that warmed your heart more than finally getting to see her again. It was almost too hard to believe but you were so happy to see her. You started hanging out a lot since she reappeared. You wanted to remind her of the times you used to spend together when you were little and so you had spent all morning setting this up. Grabbing blankets and sheets from around your house, cushions, and fairy lights.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you remember when we were little and we used to sneak up here-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;and build a fort out of everything we could find- I do.

Bowing your head a little &ldquo;After you, my lady.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How chivalrous.&rdquo; The blonde smiled softly before walking over and ducking inside. You followed her in. You had tried to make it as spacious as possible and for the most part, you were successful. You could fit two grown women inside but it was just a tad cramped. She sat down and you sat down next to her. You grabbed a tray you had stashed away earlier and placed it between you two. On it was two teacups. two teapots. and a biscuit tin.</p><p>&ldquo;You brought me in here to have&hellip; a tea party?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By all means, fly the plane but you gotta take a break sometime.&rdquo; Carol has always been a rough and tumble kind of girl.

You were never allowed to use real tea because it was hot and you had a habit of making a mess so the chances of you burning yourself were pretty high. The tea was just water. The coffee was wine. When you were younger you used juice instead of wine.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you remember what happened the last time we did this?

You had tried to make it as spacious as possible and for the most part, you were successful. You could fit two grown women inside but it was just a tad cramped.

You were never allowed to use real tea because it was hot and you had a habit of making a mess so the chances of you burning yourself were pretty high. The tea was just water. The coffee was wine.

She grabbed onto her in a tight hug and left a wet kiss on her cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;You look so tired sweety,&rdquo; Carol said softly brushing her hand through Y/n&rsquo;s hair. Y/n sighed and rested her forehead on Carol&rsquo;s.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just work.&rdquo;</p><p>As Carol opened her mouth to speak piano notes filled the air.&nbsp;</p><p><i>I can dim the light and sing you songs, full of sad things.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>We can do the tango just for two</i></p><p>Carol looked her girlfriend in the eye and smiled wide.</p><p>&ldquo;Show me how to dance,&rdquo; Carol whispered into Y/n&rsquo;s ear.&nbsp;<br /></p><p><i>I can serenade and gently play on your heart strings,</i></p><p><i>Be your Valentino just for you</i></p><p>Y/n looked at her concerned,&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you sure? To this song?&rdquo;</p><p>Carol nodded eagerly.</p><p>As the drums kicked in Y/n put her arm on Carol&rsquo;s waist and intertwined their fingers with her other hand. Carol got the hint and gently placed her hand on Y/n&rsquo;s shoulder.</p><p><i>Ooh love, ooh lover boy, what&rsquo;re you doing tonight?</i></p><p><i>Hey boy</i></p><p>They began gliding their feet across the kitchen floor to the beat of the music.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;When we&rsquo;re waltzing we move in a square,&rdquo; Y/n stated guiding Carol.<br /></p><p><i>Set my alarm, turn on my charm</i></p><p><i>That&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m a good old fashioned lover boy!</i></p><p>Carol smiled, in awe of her talented girlfriend.&nbsp;</p><p>Y/n grinned back at her and nuzzled their noses together.</p><p><i>Ooh let me feel your heartbeat</i></p><p><i>(grow faster,faster)</i></p><p>Carol put her head on Y/n&rsquo;s chest listening to her heartbeat. Y/n rested her head on top.</p><p>The two swayed around the room for the duration of the song. Y/n hummed along to the tune the whole way through.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to stay like this forever,&rdquo; Carol whispered.<br /></p><p>Y/n kissed her head.&nbsp;&ldquo;I love you so much, do you know that?&rdquo;</p><p>Carol laughed,&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh really? You never told me.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/n giggled.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re my lover boy.&rdquo;</p>",
