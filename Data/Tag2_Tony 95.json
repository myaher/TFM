Listen to me, Stephen Strange. I\u2019m not going anywhere. If terrorists and aliens couldn\u2019t kill me, a little surgery isn\u2019t tough enough to finish me off. I don\u2019t think you understand what it means to me that you love me, that I have you to love. I never thought I\u2019d have someone -\u201d</p><p>Stephen leaned down over him and kissed him lightly, then gazed into the warm brown eyes and mumbled, \u201clove you, Stark. I\u2019ll be right outside, they are the best -\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, gentlemen.\u201d The nurse smiled gently at them and shook her head. \u201cStephen, he\u2019ll be in the best of hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Stephen pressed one last kiss on Tony\u2019s forehead, then gave his hand one more squeeze and left the room. He watched as the nurse placed the mask over Tony\u2019s face, then the blinds were closed and he dropped into the closest chair and looked over at Rhodey.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a tough bastard, Stephen. He\u2019ll be fine, in fact, he\u2019ll just look back at it as the best nap he\u2019s had in years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. I just -\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to know why I know he\u2019ll be okay?\u201d</p><p>Stephen stared at his hands and shrugged, then nodded.</p><p>\u201cBefore, he only had himself to fight for, and now he has you. I\u2019ve seen him change, Stephen, since the two of you met, he\u2019s not as reckless as he was before, he actually sleeps and eats like an almost normal human being\u2026\u201d</p><p>Stephen snorted and shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s not -\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I know, I said, \u2018almost normal.\u2019\u201d Rhodey grinned at Stephen and laid a gentle hand on his shoulder. \u201cHonestly, I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d ever see him truly happy. Well, he is now. He\u2019s having the shrapnel taken out finally because he knows he doesn\u2019t have to be Iron Man all the time now, he knows he has a life outside of the missions, outside of his work, because you will be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter what,\u201d Stephen whispered.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cThey get it all?\u201d Tony mumbled before he opened his eyes, and found Stephen smiling at him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, they got it all, and pieced you back together. It will take you some time to heal, but you won\u2019t be setting off metal detectors on your own anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a relief.\u201d Tony grinned at him and groaned as he tried to sit up.</p><p>Stephen raised an eyebrow and helped him to settle back against his pillows, then gently picked up his hand and held it against his cheek, then let the breath go that he\u2019d been holding and closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cStephen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you, just, can you hold me?\u201d Stephen opened his eyes and looked at Tony, and he realized how small he seemed in the bed, how fragile, and so very human. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>Stephen nodded and slipped out of his shoes, then climbed carefully into the bed next to Tony and let out a sigh of relief as Tony rested his head on his chest, and Stephen let his arms curl carefully around him. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you what?\u201d Stephen asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhatever it is you don\u2019t want to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSunshine.\u201d</p><p>Stephen rolled his eyes and kissed Tony\u2019s matted hair, then whispered, \u201cI was afraid. I didn\u2019t realize how much, I mean I knew how I felt about you, but, I didn\u2019t - really get it until I couldn\u2019t touch you, or even see you for a few hours. I was afraid I wouldn\u2019t get to tell you, how much -\u201d</p><p>He sighed as Stephen pressed another kiss into his hair, and after a moment his breathing changed, letting him know he had fallen asleep. \u201cI love you too, Sunshine.\u201d</p>",
