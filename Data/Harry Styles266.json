A moan of satisfaction Harry made dragging her lips to attach them with the swollen ones of hers. </p>\n\n<p>Their sweaty bodies collided with each other with every deep thrust Harry\u2019s gave, the sound of their skin slapping was nothing but an utter filthy noise, that harry couldn\u2019t deny the fact of loving. The aroma of their sexes, floated around the room mixed with the vanilla\u2014cinnamon candles that harry lit, <i> because it just added to the sexiness </i> he said. </p>\n\n<p>Their throats were giving out moans and grunts and the calling out of their love. The air was carrying the complete sensuality and lust that was escaping their body. </p>\n\n<p>Both of them busy loving each other when all of a sudden a loud noise made Harry stop moving. He lifted his head from the crook of her neck and saw her eyes closed shut\u2014nose scrunched, still recovering from the unexpected sneeze. And harry couldn\u2019t help when he burst out laughing. He knew the moment was supposed to be sexy, but she just looked too cute for him not to give in.</p>\n\n<p>Huffing, y/n punched his chest, rather not hardly but yet hard enough to make him stop. The illuminated candles allowed harry to have a perfect view of her flushed cheeks. He was loving every inch of her, how she could turn from a sex goddess to an angel princess in a blink of an eye. </p>\n\n<p> Embarrassed from the previous incident, she felt blush creeping up her face as she quickly covered her face with hands, too shy to face him. <i>Who the fuck sneezes while having sex!</i>, she though to herself. The more she let herself think over it, the more she felt her cheeks burning. And harry found it adorable when she did that, hide behind her hands\u2014thinking no one was able to look at her now. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a cutie\u201d Harry chuckled removing her hands off her face and pressing a soft kiss to her forehead. His hand caressed her soft cheeks as he stared at her alluring face and dreamy eyes. He swear he never felt this much love for someone the way he did for her. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI know. Now can you just fuck me already?\u201d</p>",
