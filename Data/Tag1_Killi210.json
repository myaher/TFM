        "body": "<p>It seems to me that Eve\u2019s husband was deliberately made to be such a flat character. In their opening argument in episode six, he even rejects his embodiment of the \u201cboring, dick, husband type\u201d, but goes on to lecture her concerning both her professional passion and her obsession with capturing Villanelle. The way he describes Villanelle frames her as a typical psycho/murderer lady, but his argument as a whole targets Eve as the predatory role with an uncontrollable drive to catch Villanelle. While he doesn\u2019t seem to understand the complexities of the case, this scene shows that he also doesn\u2019t quite understand his wife. It only adds to the contrast of her as a strong, dynamic, boss b*tch who is oddly paired with a meek, passive man. To make things worse, I love how he attempts to erase his claims and push their rather serious fight under the rug. The fight is one of the first times viewers are hearing his perspective, and we get to see that he is jealous of Eve\u2019s intrigue and attention towards Villanelle. Eve is consistently bored by the ordinary and intrigued by the exceptional- it almost makes sense for her to be with a personality more similar to Villanelle\u2019s. The elimination of her already platonic relationship with her husband as a love interest would make this dynamic more interesting. In these episodes we also learn of Villanelle\u2019s pattern of castrating male victims. She jealously says that Anna only loved her husband for his penis. This is significant because Villanelle is assumedly jealous of Eve\u2019s husband, while Eve\u2019s husband is also jealous of Villanelle.</p><p>-Katie</p>",

The scene is clearly meant to suggest eroticism and desire between both Eve and Villanelle. The music most clearly reflects this, as it starts off slow and a bit eerie, but slowly builds louder as Eve puts on the whole outfit. The fervor with which Eve strips down to put on the clothing gifted to her shows the desire she has for her romanticized version of Villanelle. Additionally, Villanelle seems to reflect this desire, as all the clothing she has picked out for Eve looks as though it was custom made for her body. Eve realizes this too as shown by the camera panning over Eve\u2019s butt and breasts as she runs her hands slowly over the dress. The way the camera pans over Eve\u2019s body as she dresses gives the scene a voyeuristic feeling, as if the viewer shouldn\u2019t be there, which contribute to the sense viewers get that Eve knows her desires are misplaced, but she cannot help it nonetheless. Overall, the scene strengthens the continuous theme of a fatal attraction between Eve and Villanelle because we know that the two women will never be together in any sort of normal relationship. The fact that it is the dress that is touching Eve, rather than Villanelle herself, reflects this idea that there will always have to be a distance between the two. </p><p>- giselle</p>",

        "body": "<p>In our last class, we heavily discussed the extent to which <i>Killing Eve</i>\u2019s characters follow the \u201cpsycho-lesbian\u201d trope. At the time, I argued that I didn\u2019t think that these characters\u2019 queerness was explicitly attached to their psychopathic tendencies, but watching these last two episodes has altered my perception a bit.</p><p>Firstly, with Villanelle, these episodes further entangle her sexuality with her assassin motives. We see this when we learn of her pattern of castrating male victims as well as her jealousy towards Anna\u2019s husband because she says Anna only loved him for his penis. We also see Eve piecing together that Villanelle may have castrated her first victim because he assaulted her. This also brings in another harmful trope we\u2019ve discussed in class that assumes queer women\u2019s sexuality stems from traumatic experiences with men. </p><p>Secondly, although Eve is undoubtedly the character with better morals, we do see a seemingly out-of-character explosion of violence when she punches her husband in the face and assaults him. She does this in response to Niko accusing her of \u201cgetting off on sniffing out a psycho\u201d, relating back to our attempted characterization of Eve and Villanelle\u2019s mutual obsession.

And I not mean just the main ones, although Villanelle and Eve are amazing, but the others, too. They are so human, charismatic and relatable - Bill, Konstantin, Caroline, Kenny and of course my favorite (right after Villanelle) - Irina. I wish they didn\u2019t kill Bill and Konstantin, though T__T</p><p>- The dynamic is great - honestly, it\u2019s like pure fanfiction (and I mean it in a good sense), only on screen x) It\u2019s the second fanfiction tv-show that I\u2019ve watched (the first is Hannibal, ofc), and I\u2019m all aboard with this. Gay power to the case-shows X)) I love it.</p><p>- The finale! Eve, dear, you took the definition of Gay Panic to the whole next level xD</p><p>- The humor. I love British shows so much x)<br/></p><p>- V I L L A N E L L E. I absolutely adore her. There\u2019s not nearly enough words to explain why she\u2019s so precious and gorgeous, because it\u2019s freaking everything she does and say.

(Think of Inga, Konstantin\u2019s off screen wife) The only member of the main cast that isn\u2019t skinny is Konstantin himself (and possibly Bill, but he doesn\u2019t last long), and he is still portrayed as attractive despite being of a different body type to Carolyn (his former love interest). </p><p>It\u2019s such a shame the show is pointing fun at fat women when it strives so hard in other aspects to portray women as more three dimensional than the roles prescribed to them by the male gaze. </p>",

It\u2019s a minute thing but you can catch the critical and structural advantages of Villanelle\u2019s power over the other woman. It\u2019s like watching her reinvent something again and again but in different and more meaningful ways.</p><p> I feel that Villanelle knows that she <i>can</i> achieve a certain mutuality between herself and the woman she has set her eyes on because of the existent emotional checkbox - which is that she can \u201cgive\u201d her presence to Eve (who we know is highly interested in Villanelle anyway). It\u2019s like an immense demand for visibility, you know? The way Villanelle manages to create a stark contrast to the loss Eve experiences otherwise when she wraps her hand around Eve\u2019s own and squeezes it. It\u2019s interesting that this dredges up a reason for Eve to combat her own feelings too, imo. Because I mean, I don\u2019t want to get into the layers of the \u201cHe was slowing you down\u201d line but it\u2019s <i>such</i> an active push-back that - for a moment - there is nothing but <i>them</i>, because even when Eve grabs the knife to try to hurt Villanelle at the end she also feels the connection.</p><p>And yea.<br/></p><p>I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going with this. I just really like that the The Touch acts as the lynchpin of their confrontation and that Villanelle is dead-set on it.<br/></p>",
