Yes, the next classical music prodigy, or so he\u2019d gathered, had gushed about Eliott\u2019s art on national radio and even admitted to having a crush on him. You know, <i>the usual</i>. But when Eliott reached out to Lucas on Instagram, he honestly hadn\u2019t even expected a reply. At best, he thought it would take Lucas forever to reply, and by then, he probably would have backtracked on his words. Maybe he\u2019d even use some lame excuse about not being in Paris anytime soon, making it impossible to match up their calendars, as a way out of the situation he\u2019d gotten himself into.<br/></p><p>But to Eliott\u2019s surprise, Lucas had replied within the hour. </p><!-- more --><p><i>\u201cOMG HI! </i></p><p><i>I can\u2019t believe you heard that\u2026 I am happy that you did, of course!

Would you be free for some coffee on Tuesday?</i></p><p><i>Can\u2019t wait to actually meet you! </i></p><p><i>Bisous\u201d</i></p><p>Then he expected Lucas to disappear without making any conversation for the next week. That didn\u2019t happen either. Every few days, Lucas would chime in with a <i>\u201cHey. Hope you\u2019re having a great day. What are you up to?\u201d</i> or a <i>\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve gushed about you enough at this point, so I don\u2019t want to embarrass myself any further in the comments. But that last piece you just posted. *sobs*. Is it something you did recently?\u201d </i></p><p>So yeah, he was getting his hopes up. Hoping this will be the one person who\u2019ll get him. Get his passion for art. Who won\u2019t care that Eliott doesn\u2019t really have any friends. Or care about his fucked up brain. </p><p>Still, Eliott kept waiting for the bomb to drop. For Lucas to text him at any point to let him know that he couldn\u2019t make their date. <i>Was it even a date?</i> Or even worse, that he\u2019d changed his mind and didn\u2019t want to see or talk to Eliott again. When Tuesday came around though, neither of those things had happened. </p><p>&mdash;</p><p>That morning, Eliott woke up at 8 am. Him and Lucas had decided to meet up at noon, so Eliott had hoped for a bit of a lie-in. However, when finding himself unable to fall back asleep, Eliott leaned over the edge of his bed and grabbed the sketchbook that had been tossed on the floor the night before. He fluffed the pillows, sat with his back up against the wall and started sketching. A few hours later, he got up. </p><p>While enjoying his morning cup of coffee on the couch, Eliott inspects his sketches. He crosses out a few of them immediately. They hadn\u2019t turned out the way he wanted them to. But one of them, he circles. It has potential. </p><p>After grabbing a quick shower, he sits back down to clean up his drawing. Crossing his legs, he opens the Procreate app on his iPad and starts by outlining the hour glass with a thin black brush. He makes the lines uneven and a bit shaky on purpose. He then chooses a pencil-like brush to draw the sand passing from the top of the hour glass to the bottom, before going back to the original black brush to draw his signature racoon lying on top of the hour glass. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t his best piece, or the most subtle one. But it was a clear representation of his current state of mind. Rough around the edges from past experiences, glass like and transparent. A bystander, waiting for something meaningful to happen. Something worthwhile. </p><p>Or maybe he was simply waiting for the next hour or so to pass until he got to see Lucas. Lucas with his ridiculously blue and expressive eyes. The most beautiful nose and spikiest and most unruly hair he\u2019d ever seen. <i>Yeah, he had looked through Lucas\u2019 Instagram quite a lot over the past week, okay.</i> Lucas even seemed truly comfortable in his own skin and his own sexuality, speaking so openly about it on national radio. Eliott was neither of those two things. </p><p>Although he knew he was pansexual, Eliott had never really come out. His parents more or less knew he wasn\u2019t straight. But he had never brought a partner home, and so he hadn\u2019t felt the need to explain his sexuality to them. And besides his parents, he didn\u2019t really have anyone else to come out to. </p><p>After a few final touches, Eliott is as happy with the drawing as he\u2019ll ever be. Which is accidentally also when he notices the clock on his iPad. </p><p>Once happy with the drawing, Elliot notices the clock on his iPad. It\u2019s still a bit early, but he decides to get ready anyway. He reasons that he can always just walk to where he\u2019s meeting Lucas instead of taking the metro. Before getting up, Eliott posts his drawing on Instagram. He decides against writing a caption for it, leaving the interpretation up to the viewer. </p><p>While it processes, he puts his shoes on and goes to the mirror for one final check before leaving. While grabbing his keys from the little bowl on the shelf below the mirror, his phone pings with a notification from Instagram. It\u2019s Lucas. He\u2019s liked the photo already. How is that even possible? <i>Does Lucas have notifications on his profile turned on!?</i></p><p>Shaking his head in disbelief for what feels like the 100th time in just under a week, Eliott heads out, ready to meet the (in)famous Lucas Lallemant. </p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/19069531/chapters/45369472#workskin\">A3O link</a></p>",
