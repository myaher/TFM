But yeah otherwise, don\u2019t worry about me spoiling any of the Spider-Man movies.

Bullied constantly by most of his peers throughout high school. He is best friends with Harry Osborne, while he has a shared crush on the hot red-haired girl next door named Mary Jane Watson. Things go wrong on a field trip, and he gets bitten by a spider that eventually turned him in Spider-Man literally overnight. Boom. Villains, fighting for the girl he loves, whatever.\u00a0</p><p>If I am to be perfectly honest, I have to say that Tobey Maguire\u2019s representation of Spider-Man is the most true to the comics out of the three. Without a doubt in my mind whatsoever. There are striking inaccuracies, yet it at least includes the same concepts and characters. Stays really consistent.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"236\" data-orig-width=\"500\" style=\"\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0234aac65817272495abb9956960f5aa/tumblr_inline_pij5v6dzDw1wsagmq_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"236\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p>I grew up with the trilogy\u2014the movies were the reason why I became so invested into reading comics and watching other superhero movies.

It is clearly established early on in the film that his parents left, and all he has left is his Aunt May and Uncle Ben. Again, the bullied kid in high school that has a crush on the hot, intelligent girl named Gwen Stacy. Fucking edgy if you ask me, but he gets bitten by a spider again that progressively gives him his powers, and the rest is history. Amazing. Crime-fighting.</p><p>&hellip;&hellip;. yes.\u00a0</p><p>I don\u2019t like Garfield&rsquo;s representation of Peter Parker because he was&hellip;something else. This one was more of an edgelord than a nerd that was invested in science and photography (as far as I can remember), so I dock the points there. I\u2019ll give\u00a0\u2018im credit for having to build his own web slingers and produce his own web with chemicals because that is how the core spider-verse comics portray it\u2014web doesn\u2019t come out naturally.</p><hr><p>Tom Holland is a little better although his overarching plotline is far from the core spider-verse comics, being intertwined with the Avengers and such.
