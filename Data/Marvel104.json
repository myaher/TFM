For coping with everything or to help remember. The\ncenter was kind of a homeless shelter too. She wasn\u2019t exactly homeless, but she\nwouldn\u2019t have been able to afford a therapist. The trauma center therapist was\na lovely Japanese lady. Her dark hair was always pinned up in extravagant styles,\nnot one the same as the last one. She always had her square glasses on and\nready to go.</p><p>While she was a therapist who never got payed, her attitude was\nnever indifferent or mean. Ms. Saito was always warm, inviting and that played\na huge part in why she visited her over and over again. One of the few friends\nshe had made had suggested to visit the center, once they noticed how difficult\nit was for her to interact with people or remember anything about herself. </p><p>Antonia sold little inventions and fixed people\u2019s electronics.\nWhat she asked barely allowed her to survive, let alone build more. But the\npeople on the outskirts of Formosa weren\u2019t that wealthy. She didn\u2019t need extra\nmoney. If she couldn\u2019t pay rent or her next meal, the people always graciously offered\nto help her. It was a close-knit community that helped everyone. </p><p>\u201cAn!\u201d Turning at the voice of her friend, Alicia, Antonia\ngave her a big and real smile. She\u2019d learned that smiling at people when you\nwere in a good mood, would put them in a good mood and they might like you more\nif you don\u2019t glare them to their early grave. Or so Alicia had said.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she greeted the panting blue haired woman. The pastel\nblue color of Alicia\u2019s hair complimented her darkened skin much better than it\nshould\u2019ve. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow am I? I am fucking wonderful, thanks for asking. You\nwill not believe what I just saw.\u201d Antoine\u2019s smile was much more real at her\nfriend\u2019s enthusiastic voice. </p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d she hummed as she returned to the journal she kept\nclose by, in case she\u2019d need to write stuff down. The page was filled with\nthings under her own name, and a few other names on the page next to it. </p><p>\u201cOkay, so. The guy at the hot dog stand, remember him?\u201d\nAntonia glanced up from the page toward her awaiting friend. The girl was\nliterally vibrating with excitement. The headache building in her head was\nenough to make her irritated by Alicia\u2019s antics. She loved the woman to death,\nbut sometimes she drove her up five stories.</p><p>\u201cYeah, the red head, right? The one you\u2019ve been crushing on\nfor, oh I don\u2019t know, six months, but have never actually talked to?\u201d Antonia\nsnickered when the blue haired girl whacked her on the shoulder. \u201cOh, come on,\nMs. I-pine-on-people-I-don\u2019t-dare-to-talk-to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will shove you out of the window, don\u2019t test me,\u201d Antonia\ncouldn\u2019t help but laugh at the adorable threat. She was like a kitten trying to\nfight a lion. They both knew that the brunette would have the shorter girl on\nher face in seconds. \u201cAnyway! He saw me stalking him and naturally I knew this\nwas my moment. SOOO, I went up to him and was like, \u2018hey man, wanna catch a cup\nof coffee sometimes\u2019. I heard that\u2019s an adult thing to do, so I was like okay\nlet\u2019s try it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never even drank coffee, you heathen.\u201d Antonia shoved\nAlicia away as she tried to catch a look of her notebook. The brunette slammed\nthe notebook closed, storing it in her locked cabinet.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, you never let me see what you write!\u201d Alicia whined\nand she threw a look towards the woman who was acting like a three-year-old\ndespite her 28 years of age. It wasn\u2019t new.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a reason for that. If I told you what was in there,\nyou wouldn\u2019t know what to do with the information. My past is not all rainbows\nand sunshine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. You\u2019ve told me like nine million times\nalready.\u201d Alicia scratched behind her ear, \u201cI know you don\u2019t remember anything \u2018cuz\nyou had something horrible happen to you- this is why I need you to tell me, so\nyou don\u2019t make that pissed off face when I talk about it insensitively!\u201d She waved\nat Antonia\u2019s face with her hand. Sure enough, the brunette was scowling at her\nfriend.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t tell you, because I don\u2019t want to lose you,\u201d she\npointed out.</p><p>\u201cBut some horrid tale of your past won\u2019t make me run away,\u201d\nAlicia argued against her. </p><p>With a deep sigh the brunette informed her, \u201cI\u2019m not worried\n<i>you\u2019ll</i> run away.\u201d That made the blue\nhaired girl snap her mouth shut and get an understanding look in her eyes. Her\nfather had worked for the CIA and it\u2019d costed her mother\u2019s life. He did get out\nof the business after that, but it was a bit late to fix anything. \u201cSo, what\ndid the cute hot dog guy say?\u201d</p><p>Alicia\u2019s eyes brightened as she explained the rest of the\nfirst encounter they had had.</p><!-- more --><p>Later that evening Antonia returned to her apartment. The whole\nbuilding was falling apart, and she was quite sure they\u2019d be tearing it apart\nsoon. Which would leave her homeless. Maybe she could room with Alicia. She\nwouldn\u2019t mind the company and rent would be easier for the both of them. </p><p>She stepped inside the lobby and greeted Harold. He was a\ncleaner/host who held the place up. A long time ago the man had invested money\ninto this building and pursued his dream. But then the people had basically\nabandoned this part of the town and he was left to the bares. The apartment\ncomplex had 16 apartments, but only nine were occupied- Harold included. Antonia\nwas quite sure half of them were druggies. Wouldn\u2019t have been surprising around\nthese corners. </p><p>Harold\u2019s frail and weak smile almost broke her heart. He was\nalready in his late sixties, he shouldn\u2019t have been doing so much around the complex.\nHis hands were shaking, mostly due to his never treated addictions. Now he had\nthankfully enough smarts in his head to not go inject himself. Plus, his\ngrandchildren were quite often around the complex helping their grandfather. Harold\u2019s\nwife had died a long time ago due to cancer.</p><p>Antonia\u2019s apartment was onto second floor, right above the\nlobby. It was quiet, well until the druggies would start a party. Her keychain\nheld three keys, the keys to her apartment, her workplace and her bike\u2019s lock.\nNot that a lock would do much around here. A single fluffy ball was hanging\nfrom the keys. She\u2019d taken a liking to soft and fluffy things, which was no\nsurprise considering what she had gone through.</p><p>The apartment was a lost cause on pretty much everything,\nthough she had tried her best in patching it up. The hallway that opened up\nright after the door was quite empty, if you excluded the small rug and shoe\nholder. She couldn\u2019t afford much, most of the stuff in her apartment was used\nor passed down from friends. She didn\u2019t mind it at all. She enjoyed fixing\nthings and finding out how they worked. </p><p>The light that flooded the entry way was dimmed and yellowish.\nShe\u2019d have to fix the circuits again. It was the third time this month alone.\nThe frustrated sigh she let out made her rip her shoes off and hang her purse\nquite aggressively. As she was about to step into the kitchen, the light almost\nunnoticeable breathing caused her to halt. Someone was here.</p><p>She immediately reached in her pocket for the knife she\nalways had on standby. Her left hand reached for the light switch and as soon\nas she made out a form, the knife was flying through the air. The figure- a man\nmost likely- leaned out of the way at the very last second. The knife attached\nitself to the wooden wall behind him.</p><p>The man lifted his head at her, eyes glinting curiously. \u201cHello\nchild,\u201d The Russian accent made her skin crawl and the snarl that left her\nmouth was downright menacing.</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck are you?\u201d She spat out, her hands clenching\nand unclenching in fists. The man smirked, his expressionless and cold grey eyes\nwatching her every move. \u201cWho are you?\u201d she demanded even louder this time.</p><p>\u201cI guess you could call me an old friend,\u201d the words sending\na shiver down her spine. \u201cBut you\u2019ve been a very naughty girl, haven\u2019t you?\nMaking decisions and relationships all on your own accord.\u201d He moved and she\nmoved towards the kitchen isle where a block of knives was situated at. The tsk\nnoise made her flinch. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that. I\u2019d hate to use more painful methods,\nwouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The questioning tone was enough to send her through a loop. \u201cI\nain\u2019t coming with you anywhere. You might\u2019ve missed it, but I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like you truly believe you have a choice.\u201d At the\nwidened eyes and menacing tone, she was sent back to a time where everything\nwas much worse. To the first time this happened. When the first word hit her,\nshe gasped at the pain, \u201c\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435.\u201d\n(tender)</p><p>\u201cAh, stop.\u201d She rasped out.</p><p>\u201c\u0436\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b.\u201d\n(journal) An image of steel blue eyes flashed, and she fell to her knees.</p><p>\u201c\u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c.\u201d\n(six)</p><p>Everything left like it was slipping away. Like someone else\nwas taking control and pushing her to the back of her head, unable to affect anything.</p><p><i>Ash. Evening.\nNineteen. Reign. Order. Fire.</i></p><p>He continued until only one word was left. After a second of\nsilence he whispered the last breaking word, \u201c\u043a\u0440\u0438\u0432\u043e.\u201d (awry)</p><p>The breathing of the figure on its knees evened slowly out,\nand it lifted its head eyes emotionless and focused on the wall. \u201c\u0422\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0449?\u201d The question solidifying\nits presence.</p><p>\u201c\u044f \u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c.\u201d\n(Ready to comply/I am ready to answer.)</p><p>* * *</p><p>The Winter Flower sat at the Chair. Held together by the\nstraps, the scientists and doctors around it were preparing to do something. It\ndidn\u2019t know, it wouldn\u2019t ask. Weapons didn\u2019t have questions.</p><p>Its new handler was rubbing his chin while watching it. He\nwas contemplating on something. His empty eyes were almost unfocused due to the\nintensity of his stare. He wasn\u2019t actually looking at her, but instead was lost\ninside his head.</p><p>\u201cWe are ready,\u201d one of the scientists announced and just\nlike that his attention was back in the present. He walked down from the raised\nplatform towards it. Stopping in front of it, he ran his fingers across its\njaw.</p><p>\u201cGod, after this you\u2019ll be perfect. Absolutely and utterly\nperfect.\u201d His eyes flashed and the grin he gave it was filled with sharp teeth,\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll remember that little thing you were working on back in 1995.\nIt\u2019s finally completely finished. That Hansen chick got it finally to stabilize\nafter fifteen tries. You were great help, my dear.\u201d His tone would\u2019ve almost\nbeen loving, if it wasn\u2019t filled with disgust.</p><p>He walked back up, turning towards the doctor. He\u2019d watched\nthe interaction curiously. \u201cInject her. Three days is far too long, we need her\nto be ready and we needed it yesterday,\u201d the man hissed at him. He scrambled away,\nbarking orders in Russian. The Winter Flower wasn\u2019t listening. The hazed daze it\nwas in was going to cause problems if its handler would find out. He\u2019d already\nmade it shoot itself in the leg twice. If it weren\u2019t bandaged soon, it\u2019d bleed\nout. It wouldn\u2019t dare to inform this to the handler. He knew what\u2019d happen upon\nshooting yourself in the leg, but he didn\u2019t seem to care.</p><p>The sudden burning pain that entered its body caused it to\nscream out in agony. It felt like it was burned alive. The tears that slipped\nfrom its eyes despite its best efforts seemed to please the handler.</p><p>Its body was rebuilding itself.</p><p>Burning a deep fire through all her limbs, focusing on the\nbullet wounds as they closed after liquid metal flowed out. \u201cIncredible,\u201d the\nman whispered out. \u201cTruly remarkable.\u201d</p><p>The doctors and scientists seemed to abscond from the room,\nuntil only one doctor and the man remained.</p><p>And it burned for what seemed like years.</p>",

If she couldn\u2019t pay rent or her next meal, the people always graciously offered\nto help her. It was a close-knit community that helped everyone. </p><p>\u201cAn!\u201d Turning at the voice of her friend, Alicia, Antonia\ngave her a big and real smile. She\u2019d learned that smiling at people when you\nwere in a good mood, would put them in a good mood and they might like you more\nif you don\u2019t glare them to their early grave. Or so Alicia had said.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she greeted the panting blue haired woman. The pastel\nblue color of Alicia\u2019s hair complimented her darkened skin much better than it\nshould\u2019ve. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow am I? I am fucking wonderful, thanks for asking. You\nwill not believe what I just saw.\u201d Antoine\u2019s smile was much more real at her\nfriend\u2019s enthusiastic voice. </p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d she hummed as she returned to the journal she kept\nclose by, in case she\u2019d need to write stuff down. The page was filled with\nthings under her own name, and a few other names on the page next to it. </p><p>\u201cOkay, so. The guy at the hot dog stand, remember him?\u201d\nAntonia glanced up from the page toward her awaiting friend. The girl was\nliterally vibrating with excitement. The headache building in her head was\nenough to make her irritated by Alicia\u2019s antics. She loved the woman to death,\nbut sometimes she drove her up five stories.</p><p>\u201cYeah, the red head, right? The one you\u2019ve been crushing on\nfor, oh I don\u2019t know, six months, but have never actually talked to?\u201d Antonia\nsnickered when the blue haired girl whacked her on the shoulder. \u201cOh, come on,\nMs. I-pine-on-people-I-don\u2019t-dare-to-talk-to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will shove you out of the window, don\u2019t test me,\u201d Antonia\ncouldn\u2019t help but laugh at the adorable threat. She was like a kitten trying to\nfight a lion. They both knew that the brunette would have the shorter girl on\nher face in seconds. \u201cAnyway! He saw me stalking him and naturally I knew this\nwas my moment. SOOO, I went up to him and was like, \u2018hey man, wanna catch a cup\nof coffee sometimes\u2019. I heard that\u2019s an adult thing to do, so I was like okay\nlet\u2019s try it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never even drank coffee, you heathen.\u201d Antonia shoved\nAlicia away as she tried to catch a look of her notebook. The brunette slammed\nthe notebook closed, storing it in her locked cabinet.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, you never let me see what you write!\u201d Alicia whined\nand she threw a look towards the woman who was acting like a three-year-old\ndespite her 28 years of age. It wasn\u2019t new.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a reason for that. If I told you what was in there,\nyou wouldn\u2019t know what to do with the information. My past is not all rainbows\nand sunshine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. You\u2019ve told me like nine million times\nalready.\u201d Alicia scratched behind her ear, \u201cI know you don\u2019t remember anything \u2018cuz\nyou had something horrible happen to you- this is why I need you to tell me, so\nyou don\u2019t make that pissed off face when I talk about it insensitively!\u201d She waved\nat Antonia\u2019s face with her hand. Sure enough, the brunette was scowling at her\nfriend.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t tell you, because I don\u2019t want to lose you,\u201d she\npointed out.</p><p>\u201cBut some horrid tale of your past won\u2019t make me run away,\u201d\nAlicia argued against her. </p><p>With a deep sigh the brunette informed her, \u201cI\u2019m not worried\n<i>you\u2019ll</i> run away.\u201d That made the blue\nhaired girl snap her mouth shut and get an understanding look in her eyes. Her\nfather had worked for the CIA and it\u2019d costed her mother\u2019s life. He did get out\nof the business after that, but it was a bit late to fix anything. \u201cSo, what\ndid the cute hot dog guy say?\u201d</p><p>Alicia\u2019s eyes brightened as she explained the rest of the\nfirst encounter they had had.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Later that evening Antonia returned to her apartment. The whole\nbuilding was falling apart, and she was quite sure they\u2019d be tearing it apart\nsoon. Which would leave her homeless. Maybe she could room with Alicia. She\nwouldn\u2019t mind the company and rent would be easier for the both of them. </p><p>She stepped inside the lobby and greeted Harold. He was a\ncleaner/host who held the place up. A long time ago the man had invested money\ninto this building and pursued his dream. But then the people had basically\nabandoned this part of the town and he was left to the bares. The apartment\ncomplex had 16 apartments, but only nine were occupied- Harold included. Antonia\nwas quite sure half of them were druggies. Wouldn\u2019t have been surprising around\nthese corners. </p><p>Harold\u2019s frail and weak smile almost broke her heart. He was\nalready in his late sixties, he shouldn\u2019t have been doing so much around the complex.\nHis hands were shaking, mostly due to his never treated addictions. Now he had\nthankfully enough smarts in his head to not go inject himself. Plus, his\ngrandchildren were quite often around the complex helping their grandfather. Harold\u2019s\nwife had died a long time ago due to cancer.</p><p>Antonia\u2019s apartment was onto second floor, right above the\nlobby. It was quiet, well until the druggies would start a party. Her keychain\nheld three keys, the keys to her apartment, her workplace and her bike\u2019s lock.\nNot that a lock would do much around here. A single fluffy ball was hanging\nfrom the keys. She\u2019d taken a liking to soft and fluffy things, which was no\nsurprise considering what she had gone through.</p><p>The apartment was a lost cause on pretty much everything,\nthough she had tried her best in patching it up. The hallway that opened up\nright after the door was quite empty, if you excluded the small rug and shoe\nholder. She couldn\u2019t afford much, most of the stuff in her apartment was used\nor passed down from friends. She didn\u2019t mind it at all. She enjoyed fixing\nthings and finding out how they worked. </p><p>The light that flooded the entry way was dimmed and yellowish.\nShe\u2019d have to fix the circuits again. It was the third time this month alone.\nThe frustrated sigh she let out made her rip her shoes off and hang her purse\nquite aggressively. As she was about to step into the kitchen, the light almost\nunnoticeable breathing caused her to halt. Someone was here.</p><p>She immediately reached in her pocket for the knife she\nalways had on standby. Her left hand reached for the light switch and as soon\nas she made out a form, the knife was flying through the air. The figure- a man\nmost likely- leaned out of the way at the very last second. The knife attached\nitself to the wooden wall behind him.</p><p>The man lifted his head at her, eyes glinting curiously. \u201cHello\nchild,\u201d The Russian accent made her skin crawl and the snarl that left her\nmouth was downright menacing.</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck are you?\u201d She spat out, her hands clenching\nand unclenching in fists. The man smirked, his expressionless and cold grey eyes\nwatching her every move. \u201cWho are you?\u201d she demanded even louder this time.</p><p>\u201cI guess you could call me an old friend,\u201d the words sending\na shiver down her spine. \u201cBut you\u2019ve been a very naughty girl, haven\u2019t you?\nMaking decisions and relationships all on your own accord.\u201d He moved and she\nmoved towards the kitchen isle where a block of knives was situated at. The tsk\nnoise made her flinch. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that. I\u2019d hate to use more painful methods,\nwouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The questioning tone was enough to send her through a loop. \u201cI\nain\u2019t coming with you anywhere. You might\u2019ve missed it, but I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like you truly believe you have a choice.\u201d At the\nwidened eyes and menacing tone, she was sent back to a time where everything\nwas much worse. To the first time this happened. When the first word hit her,\nshe gasped at the pain, \u201c\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435.\u201d\n(tender)</p><p>\u201cAh, stop.\u201d She rasped out.</p><p>\u201c\u0436\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b.\u201d\n(journal) An image of steel blue eyes flashed, and she fell to her knees.</p><p>\u201c\u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c.\u201d\n(six)</p><p>Everything left like it was slipping away. Like someone else\nwas taking control and pushing her to the back of her head, unable to affect anything.</p><p><i>Ash. Evening.\nNineteen. Reign. Order. Fire.</i></p><p>He continued until only one word was left. After a second of\nsilence he whispered the last breaking word, \u201c\u043a\u0440\u0438\u0432\u043e.\u201d (awry)</p><p>The breathing of the figure on its knees evened slowly out,\nand it lifted its head eyes emotionless and focused on the wall. \u201c\u0422\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0449?\u201d The question solidifying\nits presence.</p><p>\u201c\u044f \u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c.\u201d\n(Ready to comply/I am ready to answer.)</p><p>* * *</p><p>The Winter Flower sat at the Chair. Held together by the\nstraps, the scientists and doctors around it were preparing to do something. It\ndidn\u2019t know, it wouldn\u2019t ask. Weapons didn\u2019t have questions.</p><p>Its new handler was rubbing his chin while watching it. He\nwas contemplating on something. His empty eyes were almost unfocused due to the\nintensity of his stare. He wasn\u2019t actually looking at her, but instead was lost\ninside his head.</p><p>\u201cWe are ready,\u201d one of the scientists announced and just\nlike that his attention was back in the present. He walked down from the raised\nplatform towards it. Stopping in front of it, he ran his fingers across its\njaw.</p><p>\u201cGod, after this you\u2019ll be perfect. Absolutely and utterly\nperfect.\u201d His eyes flashed and the grin he gave it was filled with sharp teeth,\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll remember that little thing you were working on back in 1995.\nIt\u2019s finally completely finished. That Hansen chick got it finally to stabilize\nafter fifteen tries. You were great help, my dear.\u201d His tone would\u2019ve almost\nbeen loving, if it wasn\u2019t filled with disgust.</p><p>He walked back up, turning towards the doctor. He\u2019d watched\nthe interaction curiously. \u201cInject her. Three days is far too long, we need her\nto be ready and we needed it yesterday,\u201d the man hissed at him. He scrambled away,\nbarking orders in Russian. The Winter Flower wasn\u2019t listening. The hazed daze it\nwas in was going to cause problems if its handler would find out. He\u2019d already\nmade it shoot itself in the leg twice. If it weren\u2019t bandaged soon, it\u2019d bleed\nout. It wouldn\u2019t dare to inform this to the handler. He knew what\u2019d happen upon\nshooting yourself in the leg, but he didn\u2019t seem to care.</p><p>The sudden burning pain that entered its body caused it to\nscream out in agony. It felt like it was burned alive. The tears that slipped\nfrom its eyes despite its best efforts seemed to please the handler.</p><p>Its body was rebuilding itself.</p><p>Burning a deep fire through all her limbs, focusing on the\nbullet wounds as they closed after liquid metal flowed out. \u201cIncredible,\u201d the\nman whispered out. \u201cTruly remarkable.\u201d</p><p>The doctors and scientists seemed to abscond from the room,\nuntil only one doctor and the man remained.</p><p>And it burned for what seemed like years.</p>",

For coping with everything or to help remember. The\ncenter was kind of a homeless shelter too. She wasn\u2019t exactly homeless, but she\nwouldn\u2019t have been able to afford a therapist.

For coping with everything or to help remember. The\ncenter was kind of a homeless shelter too. She wasn&rsquo;t exactly homeless, but she\nwouldn&rsquo;t have been able to afford a therapist. The trauma center therapist was\na lovely Japanese lady. Her dark hair was always pinned up in extravagant styles,\nnot one the same as the last one.

But the\npeople on the outskirts of Formosa weren&rsquo;t that wealthy. She didn&rsquo;t need extra\nmoney.

It was a close-knit community that helped everyone. </p><p>&ldquo;An!&rdquo; Turning at the voice of her friend, Alicia, Antonia\ngave her a big and real smile. She&rsquo;d learned that smiling at people when you\nwere in a good mood, would put them in a good mood and they might like you more\nif you don&rsquo;t glare them to their early grave. Or so Alicia had said.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; she greeted the panting blue haired woman. The pastel\nblue color of Alicia&rsquo;s hair complimented her darkened skin much better than it\nshould&rsquo;ve. &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How am I? I am fucking wonderful, thanks for asking. You\nwill not believe what I just saw.&rdquo; Antoine&rsquo;s smile was much more real at her\nfriend&rsquo;s enthusiastic voice. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; she hummed as she returned to the journal she kept\nclose by, in case she&rsquo;d need to write stuff down. The page was filled with\nthings under her own name, and a few other names on the page next to it. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, so. The guy at the hot dog stand, remember him?&rdquo;\nAntonia glanced up from the page toward her awaiting friend. The girl was\nliterally vibrating with excitement. The headache building in her head was\nenough to make her irritated by Alicia&rsquo;s antics. She loved the woman to death,\nbut sometimes she drove her up five stories.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, the red head, right? The one you&rsquo;ve been crushing on\nfor, oh I don&rsquo;t know, six months, but have never actually talked to?&rdquo; Antonia\nsnickered when the blue haired girl whacked her on the shoulder. &ldquo;Oh, come on,\nMs. I-pine-on-people-I-don&rsquo;t-dare-to-talk-to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will shove you out of the window, don&rsquo;t test me,&rdquo; Antonia\ncouldn&rsquo;t help but laugh at the adorable threat. She was like a kitten trying to\nfight a lion. They both knew that the brunette would have the shorter girl on\nher face in seconds. &ldquo;Anyway! He saw me stalking him and naturally I knew this\nwas my moment. SOOO, I went up to him and was like, &lsquo;hey man, wanna catch a cup\nof coffee sometimes&rsquo;. I heard that&rsquo;s an adult thing to do, so I was like okay\nlet&rsquo;s try it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never even drank coffee, you heathen.&rdquo; Antonia shoved\nAlicia away as she tried to catch a look of her notebook. The brunette slammed\nthe notebook closed, storing it in her locked cabinet.</p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, you never let me see what you write!&rdquo; Alicia whined\nand she threw a look towards the woman who was acting like a three-year-old\ndespite her 28 years of age. It wasn&rsquo;t new.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a reason for that. If I told you what was in there,\nyou wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do with the information. My past is not all rainbows\nand sunshine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I know. You&rsquo;ve told me like nine million times\nalready.&rdquo; Alicia scratched behind her ear, &ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t remember anything &lsquo;cuz\nyou had something horrible happen to you- this is why I need you to tell me, so\nyou don&rsquo;t make that pissed off face when I talk about it insensitively!&rdquo; She waved\nat Antonia&rsquo;s face with her hand. Sure enough, the brunette was scowling at her\nfriend.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t tell you, because I don&rsquo;t want to lose you,&rdquo; she\npointed out.</p><p>&ldquo;But some horrid tale of your past won&rsquo;t make me run away,&rdquo;\nAlicia argued against her. </p><p>With a deep sigh the brunette informed her, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not worried\n<i>you&rsquo;ll</i> run away.&rdquo; That made the blue\nhaired girl snap her mouth shut and get an understanding look in her eyes. Her\nfather had worked for the CIA and it&rsquo;d costed her mother&rsquo;s life. He did get out\nof the business after that, but it was a bit late to fix anything. &ldquo;So, what\ndid the cute hot dog guy say?&rdquo;</p><p>Alicia&rsquo;s eyes brightened as she explained the rest of the\nfirst encounter they had had.</p><p>Later that evening Antonia returned to her apartment. The whole\nbuilding was falling apart, and she was quite sure they&rsquo;d be tearing it apart\nsoon. Which would leave her homeless. Maybe she could room with Alicia. She\nwouldn&rsquo;t mind the company and rent would be easier for the both of them. </p><p>She stepped inside the lobby and greeted Harold. He was a\ncleaner/host who held the place up. A long time ago the man had invested money\ninto this building and pursued his dream. But then the people had basically\nabandoned this part of the town and he was left to the bares. The apartment\ncomplex had 16 apartments, but only nine were occupied- Harold included. Antonia\nwas quite sure half of them were druggies. Wouldn&rsquo;t have been surprising around\nthese corners. </p><p>Harold&rsquo;s frail and weak smile almost broke her heart. He was\nalready in his late sixties, he shouldn&rsquo;t have been doing so much around the complex.\nHis hands were shaking, mostly due to his never treated addictions. Now he had\nthankfully enough smarts in his head to not go inject himself. Plus, his\ngrandchildren were quite often around the complex helping their grandfather. Harold&rsquo;s\nwife had died a long time ago due to cancer.</p><p>Antonia&rsquo;s apartment was onto second floor, right above the\nlobby. It was quiet, well until the druggies would start a party. Her keychain\nheld three keys, the keys to her apartment, her workplace and her bike&rsquo;s lock.\nNot that a lock would do much around here. A single fluffy ball was hanging\nfrom the keys. She&rsquo;d taken a liking to soft and fluffy things, which was no\nsurprise considering what she had gone through.</p><p>The apartment was a lost cause on pretty much everything,\nthough she had tried her best in patching it up. The hallway that opened up\nright after the door was quite empty, if you excluded the small rug and shoe\nholder. She couldn&rsquo;t afford much, most of the stuff in her apartment was used\nor passed down from friends. She didn&rsquo;t mind it at all. She enjoyed fixing\nthings and finding out how they worked. </p><p>The light that flooded the entry way was dimmed and yellowish.\nShe&rsquo;d have to fix the circuits again. It was the third time this month alone.\nThe frustrated sigh she let out made her rip her shoes off and hang her purse\nquite aggressively. As she was about to step into the kitchen, the light almost\nunnoticeable breathing caused her to halt. Someone was here.</p><p>She immediately reached in her pocket for the knife she\nalways had on standby. Her left hand reached for the light switch and as soon\nas she made out a form, the knife was flying through the air. The figure- a man\nmost likely- leaned out of the way at the very last second. The knife attached\nitself to the wooden wall behind him.</p><p>The man lifted his head at her, eyes glinting curiously. &ldquo;Hello\nchild,&rdquo; The Russian accent made her skin crawl and the snarl that left her\nmouth was downright menacing.</p><p>&ldquo;Who the fuck are you?&rdquo; She spat out, her hands clenching\nand unclenching in fists. The man smirked, his expressionless and cold grey eyes\nwatching her every move. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she demanded even louder this time.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess you could call me an old friend,&rdquo; the words sending\na shiver down her spine. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve been a very naughty girl, haven&rsquo;t you?\nMaking decisions and relationships all on your own accord.&rdquo; He moved and she\nmoved towards the kitchen isle where a block of knives was situated at. The tsk\nnoise made her flinch. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t do that. I&rsquo;d hate to use more painful methods,\nwouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>The questioning tone was enough to send her through a loop. &ldquo;I\nain&rsquo;t coming with you anywhere.

Sam tries to ruin what Bucky hasn\u2019t ruined already.</small></i><br/></p><p><i><small>Written for <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbGWF-MRPVY9t7hmmUNrERQ\">@moonstruckhargrove</a>\u2018s valentine\u2019s writing challenge!! thanks for hosting, Meg!</small></i></p><hr><p>Bucky is, for most intents and purposes, devastated.</p><p>Waving a towel listlessly in front of his face, he takes a ragged breath that tastes like acrid smoke. His eyes are burning, from the smoke and surfacing tears of both pain and horrible disappointment. His flesh hand still stings, despite the aloe vera he\u2019d bandaged on with a cold compress; his toes throb from where he\u2019d dropped a cast iron skillet on it (he\u2019s 75% sure nothing\u2019s broken); his ears ring from incessant wail the smoke alarm. The batteries had been thrown across the room in frustration.</p><p>Devastated. Utterly devastated. Just like the kitchen.</p><p>Just like his hopes and dreams.</p><!-- more --><p>Eyes still burning, Bucky coughs a few times as he pulls his phone from his pocket. He ignores the time - he has to, otherwise he\u2019d <i>really </i>panic. His lip curls to even consider what he\u2019s doing. But what other choice does he have?</p><p>Bucky puts the phone to his ear, methodically waving the smoke around. Two rings. Then it picks up.</p><p>\u201cHey, man,\u201d Sam\u2019s voice is far too chipper. \u201cIs this a butt dial or are you in dire need of my unmatchable assistance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny,\u201d Bucky grumbles. \u201cIt\u2019s an emergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>Bucky swallows. His throat itches from the smoke. And his pride smarts. \u201cI ruined dinner,\u201d he mutters, rubbing his eyes with the back of his hand.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Sam asks slyly. \u201cWhat was that? Couldn\u2019t quite hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I ruined dinner!</i>\u201d Having to say it twice is even worse - hearing Sam\u2019s half-smothered laugh on the other end of the line, the cherry on top. Bucky curses under his breath.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, man,\u201d Sam says between cackles. \u201cOrder pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPizza?\u201d Bucky frowns.</p><p>\u201cYeah, or is that too modern for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day, Wilson,\u201d Bucky snaps. \u201cI can\u2019t just order <i>pizza</i> for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right, the whole <i>romance </i>thing,\u201d Sam chortles. \u201cWell, considering how well I know your girl - \u00a0\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Wilson</i>&hellip;\u201d Bucky growls in warning.</p><p>\u201c - I\u2019m just saying, she probably won\u2019t mind,\u201d Sam finishes. \u201cI think anyone would prefer pizza over whatever you messed up, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for that,\u201d Bucky says sardonically. \u201cFor the record, it wasn\u2019t my fault. Gas stoves are dangerous; pots and pans should come with splatter tops, and Stark should have outfitted my new arm with rubber grippers.\u201d</p><p>A split second, and then Sam is roaring with laughter - so loud that Bucky has to pull the phone away from his ear, wincing. It\u2019s several moments before Sam is quiet enough to talk again. During that time, Bucky\u2019s sour irritation ferments.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019ll order a pizza for you guys, okay?\u201d Sam says at last. \u201cI know how much you hate to do the order online thing. But you owe me, Barnes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, I owe you,\u201d Bucky sighs, rubbing his eyes again. \u201cJust - thanks, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get all sappy on me, now,\u201d Sam teases. \u201cSave it for 28. You\u2019ll need it, once she sees whatever mess you\u2019re standing in. Send me a pic, would you? I wanna enjoy that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, screw you, Wilson!\u201d Bucky yanks the phone away, jabbing the end call button - Sam\u2019s hoots are cut off. Not as satisfying as slamming an old-fashioned telephone down. But Bucky takes a deep breath, and gazes around the kitchen.</p><p>He\u2019s screwed.</p><p>Twenty minutes until you\u2019re home.</p><p>Prioritize. Prioritize. Bucky\u2019s good at that. Open windows. Charred food in the trash. Dump all the nasty dishes in the sink. Wipe down counters. Wipe down floor. Trash out to the hall. Spray that air freshner you keep under the sink. Move the vase of flowers he\u2019d picked up earlier to the front room. Maybe that\u2019ll distract you.</p><p>The apartment still stinks - and the air outside is so crisp that Bucky doesn\u2019t dare open any more windows. There are no overhead fans, either.</p><p>Candles it is.</p><p>Bucky nearly jumps out of his skin as he hears a key in the lock - blowing out the match, he rushes to throw it in the trash. Oops. Hadn\u2019t put a new bag in. Cupboards slam, but he hears your voice over it all -</p><p>\u201cAw, Bucky! Are these for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, babe!\u201d he calls back, shoving the bag into the trash can. \u201cUm - happy Valentine\u2019s day!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, they\u2019re lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like you.\u201d Putting on his best charming smile - despite that he\u2019s far too flustered to be feeling charming at all - Bucky strolls back into the front room with his hands tucked in his pockets, casting you a wink as soon as you look up. Bent over the bouquet on the coffee table, you lift your head from smelling the flowers, eyes appraising Bucky in a distracting way. Then you blink, your nostrils flare, and your eyes flit beyond him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s burning?\u201d you ask.</p><p>\u201cEr - nothing.\u201d</p><p>You quirk a brow.</p><p>\u201cFine. I burned dinner,\u201d Bucky admits. As if he could ever lie to you. He wouldn\u2019t dare, anyway. Suppressing a groan of leftover frustration, he runs his hands through his loose hair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I wanted it to be a nice surprise, but\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t need to do that,\u201d you cut him off, bemused. \u201cI don\u2019t like surprises. It\u2019s a secret agent thing.\u201d A step around the coffee table, a beaming smile - and then you\u2019re tucked up in Bucky\u2019s willing embrace. What was he going on about, again? Now that your eyes are sparkling into his, his memories seem to be fleeting\u2026</p><p>Your chin tilts up, and Bucky obliges with a kiss. It\u2019s short lived - you pull away, nose wrinkled.</p><p>\u201cYou taste like smoke,\u201d you comment.</p><p>\u201cWell, not all of us have had a relaxing day like <i>you</i>,\u201d Bucky snarks, hoping he doesn\u2019t look at devastated as he feels. You start to giggle, and he growls, making a nip for the sensitive flesh of your neck before you squirm away.</p><p>\u201cGo shower,\u201d you suggest. \u201cI\u2019ll order pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Bucky grumbles. \u201cAlready on it\u2019s way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally!\u201d your brow quirks again as you shrug off your coat, backing up to hand it on the coat stand. \u201cI thought you swore never to order pizza again. After the <i>last </i>incident.\u201d</p><p>Bucky scrunches his nose. \u201cSam ordered it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww. Sam\u2019s so nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, after he laughed at me for about ten minutes.\u201d With a woeful sigh, Bucky pulls his acrid-smelling shirt over his head, wafting around more stink. But it\u2019s worth the widening of your eyes as you stall in your tracks. He smirks, and flexes his biceps - both sides, and the metal whirrs.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, hello,\u201d you murmur, tongue darting out to lick your bottom lip. \u201cGood to see <i>you</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna help me shower?\u201d Bucky teases, wiggling his brows as he undoes his belt next. Your eyes flit down.</p><p>\u201cUm - \u201d There appears to be a serious moral conundrum going down - Bucky smirks, wiggling his hips, and you sigh softly, shaking your head. \u201cSomeone\u2019s gotta answer the door for the pizza.\u201d</p><p>Bucky groans - exaggerated this time, and then yelps as you land a swat on his backside. \u201cHey!\u201d he protests, making for the bathroom as he shoots a half-hearted glare back at you. \u201cThat\u2019s no way to treat the fellow who bent his back out of shape to give you a romantic evening!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how did that work out?\u201d you call, but he\u2019s already around the corner. Bucky chooses not to respond to that particular taunt.</p><p>The hot showers does wonders for his mood - then again, your appearance had, too. Always does. Who cares about how dinner turned out, anyway? <i>Every </i>evening with you is special, especially now that you aren\u2019t hiding your relationship anymore. So why be grumpy about it?</p><p>Bucky is smiling when he finally saunters back into the front room, hair still wet and only wearing a white t-shirt and a pair of running shorts (he\u2019s hoping they won\u2019t be on for long) - you\u2019re wearing an apron over your work clothes for office days, peering into a cardboard box that smells quite nice. As he enters, you glance up, clearly stifling laughter.</p><p>\u201cFrom Sam, huh?\u201d you ask, voice quivering.</p><p>Bucky\u2019s good mood stalls. \u201cWhat did he do?\u201d A few more strides, and he\u2019s beside you at the dining table. He cusses under his breath as he sees - a plain pepperoni pizza, though the pepperoni are shaped like an ejaculating -</p><p>\u201cSam has quite the sense of humor, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d you say lightly. \u201cWell. I\u2019m about ready to wrap my mouth around this - what do you think?\u201d</p><p>Bucky\u2019s mouth falls open. He blinks into the sparkle in your eyes - but you only laugh, nudging him with an elbow.</p><p>\u201cWow, Bucky, you\u2019re a pervert tonight,\u201d you tease. \u201cI was talking about the pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh - uh huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell - for now. You might have to make up for the mess in the kitchen,\u201d you add. Lips pursed, brows lifted expectantly. Bucky winces.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry - \u201d</p><p>But you take mercy on him. \u201cI know, I know.\u201d Winding your arm through his, you smile up at him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you burned on my pans, but it\u2019s gonna take some real elbow grease to get off. I just spent five minutes just picking up the batteries from the smoke alarm, Mr. Temper Tantrum.\u201d</p><p>Bucky cringes.</p><p><b>\u201cAfter that, you\u2019re lucky I still love you,\u201d</b> you say lightly, but your smile assures him you\u2019re not serious. About not loving him for something like this disaster, that is.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am,\u201d he agrees, and pecks a kiss on the tip of your nose. \u201cLet me make it up to you? After pizza, maybe?\u201d</p><p>Your eyes are shining bright, curious. \u201cAre you thinking like, cleaning the kitchen to its usual spotless splendor, or making sweet love to me until I can\u2019t remember my own name?\u201d</p><p>Bucky grins. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to wait and see, won\u2019t you, babe?\u201d</p><h2>fin</h2>",

But what other choice does he have?</p><p>Bucky puts the phone to his ear, methodically waving the smoke around. Two rings. Then it picks up.</p><p>\u201cHey, man,\u201d Sam\u2019s voice is far too chipper. \u201cIs this a butt dial or are you in dire need of my unmatchable assistance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny,\u201d Bucky grumbles. \u201cIt\u2019s an emergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>Bucky swallows. His throat itches from the smoke. And his pride smarts. \u201cI ruined dinner,\u201d he mutters, rubbing his eyes with the back of his hand.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Sam asks slyly. \u201cWhat was that? Couldn\u2019t quite hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I ruined dinner!</i>\u201d Having to say it twice is even worse - hearing Sam\u2019s half-smothered laugh on the other end of the line, the cherry on top. Bucky curses under his breath.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, man,\u201d Sam says between cackles. \u201cOrder pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPizza?\u201d Bucky frowns.</p><p>\u201cYeah, or is that too modern for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day, Wilson,\u201d Bucky snaps. \u201cI can\u2019t just order <i>pizza</i> for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right, the whole <i>romance </i>thing,\u201d Sam chortles. \u201cWell, considering how well I know your girl - \u00a0\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Wilson</i>\u2026\u201d Bucky growls in warning.</p><p>\u201c - I\u2019m just saying, she probably won\u2019t mind,\u201d Sam finishes. \u201cI think anyone would prefer pizza over whatever you messed up, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for that,\u201d Bucky says sardonically. \u201cFor the record, it wasn\u2019t my fault. Gas stoves are dangerous; pots and pans should come with splatter tops, and Stark should have outfitted my new arm with rubber grippers.\u201d</p><p>A split second, and then Sam is roaring with laughter - so loud that Bucky has to pull the phone away from his ear, wincing. It\u2019s several moments before Sam is quiet enough to talk again. During that time, Bucky\u2019s sour irritation ferments.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019ll order a pizza for you guys, okay?\u201d Sam says at last. \u201cI know how much you hate to do the order online thing. But you owe me, Barnes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, I owe you,\u201d Bucky sighs, rubbing his eyes again. \u201cJust - thanks, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get all sappy on me, now,\u201d Sam teases. \u201cSave it for 28. You\u2019ll need it, once she sees whatever mess you\u2019re standing in. Send me a pic, would you? I wanna enjoy that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, screw you, Wilson!\u201d Bucky yanks the phone away, jabbing the end call button - Sam\u2019s hoots are cut off. Not as satisfying as slamming an old-fashioned telephone down. But Bucky takes a deep breath, and gazes around the kitchen.</p><p>He\u2019s screwed.</p><p>Twenty minutes until you\u2019re home.</p><p>Prioritize. Prioritize. Bucky\u2019s good at that. Open windows. Charred food in the trash. Dump all the nasty dishes in the sink. Wipe down counters. Wipe down floor. Trash out to the hall. Spray that air freshner you keep under the sink. Move the vase of flowers he\u2019d picked up earlier to the front room. Maybe that\u2019ll distract you.</p><p>The apartment still stinks - and the air outside is so crisp that Bucky doesn\u2019t dare open any more windows. There are no overhead fans, either.</p><p>Candles it is.</p><p>Bucky nearly jumps out of his skin as he hears a key in the lock - blowing out the match, he rushes to throw it in the trash. Oops. Hadn\u2019t put a new bag in. Cupboards slam, but he hears your voice over it all -</p><p>\u201cAw, Bucky! Are these for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, babe!\u201d he calls back, shoving the bag into the trash can. \u201cUm - happy Valentine\u2019s day!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, they\u2019re lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like you.\u201d Putting on his best charming smile - despite that he\u2019s far too flustered to be feeling charming at all - Bucky strolls back into the front room with his hands tucked in his pockets, casting you a wink as soon as you look up. Bent over the bouquet on the coffee table, you lift your head from smelling the flowers, eyes appraising Bucky in a distracting way. Then you blink, your nostrils flare, and your eyes flit beyond him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s burning?\u201d you ask.</p><p>\u201cEr - nothing.\u201d</p><p>You quirk a brow.</p><p>\u201cFine. I burned dinner,\u201d Bucky admits. As if he could ever lie to you. He wouldn\u2019t dare, anyway. Suppressing a groan of leftover frustration, he runs his hands through his loose hair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I wanted it to be a nice surprise, but\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t need to do that,\u201d you cut him off, bemused. \u201cI don\u2019t like surprises. It\u2019s a secret agent thing.\u201d A step around the coffee table, a beaming smile - and then you\u2019re tucked up in Bucky\u2019s willing embrace. What was he going on about, again? Now that your eyes are sparkling into his, his memories seem to be fleeting\u2026</p><p>Your chin tilts up, and Bucky obliges with a kiss. It\u2019s short lived - you pull away, nose wrinkled.</p><p>\u201cYou taste like smoke,\u201d you comment.</p><p>\u201cWell, not all of us have had a relaxing day like <i>you</i>,\u201d Bucky snarks, hoping he doesn\u2019t look at devastated as he feels. You start to giggle, and he growls, making a nip for the sensitive flesh of your neck before you squirm away.</p><p>\u201cGo shower,\u201d you suggest. \u201cI\u2019ll order pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Bucky grumbles. \u201cAlready on it\u2019s way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally!\u201d your brow quirks again as you shrug off your coat, backing up to hand it on the coat stand. \u201cI thought you swore never to order pizza again. After the <i>last </i>incident.\u201d</p><p>Bucky scrunches his nose. \u201cSam ordered it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww. Sam\u2019s so nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, after he laughed at me for about ten minutes.\u201d With a woeful sigh, Bucky pulls his acrid-smelling shirt over his head, wafting around more stink. But it\u2019s worth the widening of your eyes as you stall in your tracks. He smirks, and flexes his biceps - both sides, and the metal whirrs.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, hello,\u201d you murmur, tongue darting out to lick your bottom lip. \u201cGood to see <i>you</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna help me shower?\u201d Bucky teases, wiggling his brows as he undoes his belt next.

Couldn\u2019t quite hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I ruined dinner!</i>\u201d Having to say it twice is even worse - hearing Sam\u2019s half-smothered laugh on the other end of the line, the cherry on top. Bucky curses under his breath.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, man,\u201d Sam says between cackles. \u201cOrder pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPizza?\u201d Bucky frowns.</p><p>\u201cYeah, or is that too modern for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day, Wilson,\u201d Bucky snaps. \u201cI can\u2019t just order <i>pizza</i> for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right, the whole <i>romance </i>thing,\u201d Sam chortles. \u201cWell, considering how well I know your girl - \u00a0\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Wilson</i>\u2026\u201d Bucky growls in warning.</p><p>\u201c - I\u2019m just saying, she probably won\u2019t mind,\u201d Sam finishes. \u201cI think anyone would prefer pizza over whatever you messed up, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for that,\u201d Bucky says sardonically. \u201cFor the record, it wasn\u2019t my fault. Gas stoves are dangerous; pots and pans should come with splatter tops, and Stark should have outfitted my new arm with rubber grippers.\u201d</p><p>A split second, and then Sam is roaring with laughter - so loud that Bucky has to pull the phone away from his ear, wincing. It\u2019s several moments before Sam is quiet enough to talk again. During that time, Bucky\u2019s sour irritation ferments.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019ll order a pizza for you guys, okay?\u201d Sam says at last. \u201cI know how much you hate to do the order online thing. But you owe me, Barnes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, I owe you,\u201d Bucky sighs, rubbing his eyes again. \u201cJust - thanks, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get all sappy on me, now,\u201d Sam teases. \u201cSave it for 28. You\u2019ll need it, once she sees whatever mess you\u2019re standing in. Send me a pic, would you? I wanna enjoy that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, screw you, Wilson!\u201d Bucky yanks the phone away, jabbing the end call button - Sam\u2019s hoots are cut off. Not as satisfying as slamming an old-fashioned telephone down. But Bucky takes a deep breath, and gazes around the kitchen.</p><p>He\u2019s screwed.</p><p>Twenty minutes until you\u2019re home.</p><p>Prioritize. Prioritize. Bucky\u2019s good at that. Open windows. Charred food in the trash. Dump all the nasty dishes in the sink. Wipe down counters. Wipe down floor. Trash out to the hall. Spray that air freshner you keep under the sink. Move the vase of flowers he\u2019d picked up earlier to the front room. Maybe that\u2019ll distract you.</p><p>The apartment still stinks - and the air outside is so crisp that Bucky doesn\u2019t dare open any more windows. There are no overhead fans, either.</p><p>Candles it is.</p><p>Bucky nearly jumps out of his skin as he hears a key in the lock - blowing out the match, he rushes to throw it in the trash. Oops. Hadn\u2019t put a new bag in. Cupboards slam, but he hears your voice over it all -</p><p>\u201cAw, Bucky! Are these for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, babe!\u201d he calls back, shoving the bag into the trash can. \u201cUm - happy Valentine\u2019s day!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, they\u2019re lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like you.\u201d Putting on his best charming smile - despite that he\u2019s far too flustered to be feeling charming at all - Bucky strolls back into the front room with his hands tucked in his pockets, casting you a wink as soon as you look up. Bent over the bouquet on the coffee table, you lift your head from smelling the flowers, eyes appraising Bucky in a distracting way. Then you blink, your nostrils flare, and your eyes flit beyond him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s burning?\u201d you ask.</p><p>\u201cEr - nothing.\u201d</p><p>You quirk a brow.</p><p>\u201cFine. I burned dinner,\u201d Bucky admits. As if he could ever lie to you. He wouldn\u2019t dare, anyway. Suppressing a groan of leftover frustration, he runs his hands through his loose hair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I wanted it to be a nice surprise, but\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t need to do that,\u201d you cut him off, bemused. \u201cI don\u2019t like surprises. It\u2019s a secret agent thing.\u201d A step around the coffee table, a beaming smile - and then you\u2019re tucked up in Bucky\u2019s willing embrace. What was he going on about, again? Now that your eyes are sparkling into his, his memories seem to be fleeting\u2026</p><p>Your chin tilts up, and Bucky obliges with a kiss. It\u2019s short lived - you pull away, nose wrinkled.</p><p>\u201cYou taste like smoke,\u201d you comment.</p><p>\u201cWell, not all of us have had a relaxing day like <i>you</i>,\u201d Bucky snarks, hoping he doesn\u2019t look at devastated as he feels. You start to giggle, and he growls, making a nip for the sensitive flesh of your neck before you squirm away.</p><p>\u201cGo shower,\u201d you suggest. \u201cI\u2019ll order pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Bucky grumbles. \u201cAlready on it\u2019s way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally!\u201d your brow quirks again as you shrug off your coat, backing up to hand it on the coat stand. \u201cI thought you swore never to order pizza again. After the <i>last </i>incident.\u201d</p><p>Bucky scrunches his nose. \u201cSam ordered it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww. Sam\u2019s so nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, after he laughed at me for about ten minutes.\u201d With a woeful sigh, Bucky pulls his acrid-smelling shirt over his head, wafting around more stink. But it\u2019s worth the widening of your eyes as you stall in your tracks. He smirks, and flexes his biceps - both sides, and the metal whirrs.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, hello,\u201d you murmur, tongue darting out to lick your bottom lip. \u201cGood to see <i>you</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna help me shower?\u201d Bucky teases, wiggling his brows as he undoes his belt next. Your eyes flit down.</p><p>\u201cUm - \u201d There appears to be a serious moral conundrum going down - Bucky smirks, wiggling his hips, and you sigh softly, shaking your head. \u201cSomeone\u2019s gotta answer the door for the pizza.\u201d</p><p>Bucky groans - exaggerated this time, and then yelps as you land a swat on his backside. \u201cHey!\u201d he protests, making for the bathroom as he shoots a half-hearted glare back at you. \u201cThat\u2019s no way to treat the fellow who bent his back out of shape to give you a romantic evening!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how did that work out?\u201d you call, but he\u2019s already around the corner. Bucky chooses not to respond to that particular taunt.</p><p>The hot showers does wonders for his mood - then again, your appearance had, too. Always does. Who cares about how dinner turned out, anyway? <i>Every </i>evening with you is special, especially now that you aren\u2019t hiding your relationship anymore. So why be grumpy about it?</p><p>Bucky is smiling when he finally saunters back into the front room, hair still wet and only wearing a white t-shirt and a pair of running shorts (he\u2019s hoping they won\u2019t be on for long) - you\u2019re wearing an apron over your work clothes for office days, peering into a cardboard box that smells quite nice. As he enters, you glance up, clearly stifling laughter.</p><p>\u201cFrom Sam, huh?\u201d you ask, voice quivering.</p><p>Bucky\u2019s good mood stalls. \u201cWhat did he do?\u201d A few more strides, and he\u2019s beside you at the dining table. He cusses under his breath as he sees - a plain pepperoni pizza, though the pepperoni are shaped like an ejaculating -</p><p>\u201cSam has quite the sense of humor, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d you say lightly. \u201cWell. I\u2019m about ready to wrap my mouth around this - what do you think?\u201d</p><p>Bucky\u2019s mouth falls open. He blinks into the sparkle in your eyes - but you only laugh, nudging him with an elbow.</p><p>\u201cWow, Bucky, you\u2019re a pervert tonight,\u201d you tease. \u201cI was talking about the pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh - uh huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell - for now. You might have to make up for the mess in the kitchen,\u201d you add. Lips pursed, brows lifted expectantly. Bucky winces.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry - \u201d</p><p>But you take mercy on him. \u201cI know, I know.\u201d Winding your arm through his, you smile up at him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you burned on my pans, but it\u2019s gonna take some real elbow grease to get off. I just spent five minutes just picking up the batteries from the smoke alarm, Mr. Temper Tantrum.\u201d</p><p>Bucky cringes.</p><p><b>\u201cAfter that, you\u2019re lucky I still love you,\u201d</b> you say lightly, but your smile assures him you\u2019re not serious. About not loving him for something like this disaster, that is.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am,\u201d he agrees, and pecks a kiss on the tip of your nose. \u201cLet me make it up to you? After pizza, maybe?\u201d</p><p>Your eyes are shining bright, curious. \u201cAre you thinking like, cleaning the kitchen to its usual spotless splendor, or making sweet love to me until I can\u2019t remember my own name?\u201d</p><p>Bucky grins. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to wait and see, won\u2019t you, babe?\u201d</p><h2>fin</h2></p>",
