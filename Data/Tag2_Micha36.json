I also design cross stitch patterns and do a bit of needle felting.  Basically, I try my hand at everything.  I'm a bit of a geek, love scifi and fantasy, old movies/tv, love to read (just about all topics) and adore ALL animals.",

They made my heart so full. I\u2019ve never met Sir McKellen in person, let alone know him personally\u2014though I\u2019ve always loved the characters he\u2019s portrayed on screens and his childlike smiles that are both adorable and stunning\u2014but after reading this article, I feel like I have known the world renowned actor like an old friend. An essential read for fans. </b></p><p><b>Here are some extracts; read the full article on <i>The Guardian</i> [<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fculture%2F2019%2Fmay%2F22%2Fian-mckellen-patrick-stewart-judi-dench-anthony-hopkins-derek-jacobi-helen-mirren&amp;t=NzE1ZTYxOTJhMWQ3Yjg1MDY2NDQwNzQ2MDQxMjAxNGM4NTgwMjc3Myw2ZmUyYWMxODA1MWU4ZjQ4ZmE2MzFjNzAxYTM1Zjg0NDk2MmE3ZGZm\" target=\"_blank\">Link</a>]:</b></p><p><b>Michael Sheen</b>: \u201cHe\u2019s not a mentor. He would never dare to tell anyone what to do. He has great humility and a very gentle way with people. He\u2019s almost like an Alan Bennett character, though he sort of plays on that a bit because he\u2019s very mischievous. I think it quite suits him at times to be a fairy godmother figure, knowing he\u2019s got this roaring engine inside. He\u2019s extremely sure of what he believes in, so much so he doesn\u2019t need to push it on people. He\u2019s very open and non-dogmatic. His confidence about how good he is gives him a \u201cfuck you\u201d quality. People are clearly not going to take his career away from him because he speaks his mind. He\u2019s one of the greatest actors of all time and has proved he can do anything he wants. He\u2019s an unstoppable force.\u201d</p><p><b>Bill Condon</b>: \u201cIn the flesh, he doesn\u2019t seem anywhere near 80. He\u2019s such a young spirit. On Gods and Monsters, the Whale movie, he\u2019d shoot for 12 hours then ring me at 1am with notes. At the time he was also really embracing the movie star life. He had a wonderful house in the hills with a pool and a jacuzzi, and threw fun parties all the time. He does nothing with reserve or looking down his nose.\u201d </p><figure data-orig-width=\"890\" data-orig-height=\"608\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0ba8725af6689110c420ede3e712c51d/tumblr_prxls7ep8I1vn71y0_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"890\" data-orig-height=\"608\"/></figure><p><b>Judi Dench</b>: \u201cHe\u2019s somebody who\u2019s ever-present; a very good friend to me. I know that if I rang he would always make time to see me or be around or to be there with advice. It was lovely doing Cats [the forthcoming film of the musical] earlier this year. While he did his number, I was in an enormous cat basket. I had on a very big fur coat and nothing else. It was fantastic. I could have dropped off if I wanted. It was wonderful to just watch him working. He plays Gus the theatre cat and that\u2019s perfect casting. He\u2019s like no other animal I know. A rare beast.\u201d </p><p><b>Anthony Hopkins</b>: \u201cHe\u2019s very funny. He made me laugh all the time with little camp in-jokes. I\u2019d be acting my head off and he\u2019d say: \u201cOoh, dear, get her.\u201d In the theatre, it\u2019s impossible to work with such people. I have to walk off the stage because I\u2019m laughing so much.\u201d</p><p><b>Derek Jacobi:</b> \u201cAs an actor, he has an absolute focus on what he wants and how to get it. He is amazing with props. I remember in Richard III, in the wooing scene with Anne, he only had the use of one arm. And he kind of stripped off with that one arm, down to his bare chest, then gradually put his clothes back on. People were fixated on this one-handed striptease. It was very Ian: eye-catching, theatrical, riveting.\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"890\" data-orig-height=\"534\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9061adac08a60529fdc0a2e848dcd3e9/tumblr_prxlgsN8MZ1vn71y0_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"890\" data-orig-height=\"534\"/></figure><p><b>Patrick Stewart:</b> \u201cWe shot the first X-Men film in 2002 and I wasn\u2019t absolutely ready to just fall into his arms. But we had adjoining luxury trailers and took to hanging out. Ian always had nice nibbles \u2013 pastries, nice things he\u2019d made before he came to work.

He&rsquo;s one of the greatest actors of all time and has proved he can do anything he wants. He&rsquo;s an unstoppable force.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Bill Condon</b>: &ldquo;In the flesh, he doesn&rsquo;t seem anywhere near 80. He&rsquo;s such a young spirit. On Gods and Monsters, the Whale movie, he&rsquo;d shoot for 12 hours then ring me at 1am with notes. At the time he was also really embracing the movie star life. He had a wonderful house in the hills with a pool and a jacuzzi, and threw fun parties all the time. He does nothing with reserve or looking down his nose.&rdquo; </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0ba8725af6689110c420ede3e712c51d/tumblr_prxls7ep8I1vn71y0_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>Judi Dench</b>: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s somebody who&rsquo;s ever-present; a very good friend to me. I know that if I rang he would always make time to see me or be around or to be there with advice. It was lovely doing Cats [the forthcoming film of the musical] earlier this year. While he did his number, I was in an enormous cat basket. I had on a very big fur coat and nothing else. It was fantastic. I could have dropped off if I wanted. It was wonderful to just watch him working. He plays Gus the theatre cat and that&rsquo;s perfect casting. He&rsquo;s like no other animal I know. A rare beast.&rdquo; </p><p><b>Anthony Hopkins</b>: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s very funny. He made me laugh all the time with little camp in-jokes. I&rsquo;d be acting my head off and he&rsquo;d say: &ldquo;Ooh, dear, get her.&rdquo; In the theatre, it&rsquo;s impossible to work with such people. I have to walk off the stage because I&rsquo;m laughing so much.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Derek Jacobi:</b> &ldquo;As an actor, he has an absolute focus on what he wants and how to get it. He is amazing with props. I remember in Richard III, in the wooing scene with Anne, he only had the use of one arm. And he kind of stripped off with that one arm, down to his bare chest, then gradually put his clothes back on. People were fixated on this one-handed striptease. It was very Ian: eye-catching, theatrical, riveting.&rdquo;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9061adac08a60529fdc0a2e848dcd3e9/tumblr_prxlgsN8MZ1vn71y0_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>Patrick Stewart:</b> &ldquo;We shot the first X-Men film in 2002 and I wasn&rsquo;t absolutely ready to just fall into his arms. But we had adjoining luxury trailers and took to hanging out. Ian always had nice nibbles &ndash; pastries, nice things he&rsquo;d made before he came to work. And we quickly found we had so much in common. He&rsquo;s a Lancastrian and I&rsquo;m a Yorkshireman; we are a year apart and grew up on opposite sides of the Pennines. We became very good friends. As well as X-Men, we have worked together a lot on stage. Sometimes I feel we&rsquo;re enjoying it too much and the audience don&rsquo;t quite understand why we&rsquo;re having so much fun.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Helen Mirren</b>: &ldquo;Every actor has a slightly different approach. Some reach their performance quickly, others take a long time. Ian likes to really explore all around the edges before he decides on the centre. He likes to leave it quite open and doesn&rsquo;t hone it until quite late. He is absolutely masterful. I would stand in the wings and watch him: an extraordinary technician, so in control of the audience. It&rsquo;s a miracle to see.&rdquo; </p><p><b>Stephen Fry: </b>&ldquo;Incidentally, how great is he at comedy? A glorious panto dame &ndash; and stunningly hilarious in Chekhov&rsquo;s Wild Honey. He&rsquo;s the most delightful and entertaining friend anyone could ever have.&rdquo;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8aaba833a911e288db936a9d705f2070/tumblr_prxlgs3ejw1vn71y0_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>Janet Suzman:</b> &ldquo;He is in the grand tradition, to this foreigner anyway, of that most English of creatures, Mr Mischief: camp, brilliantly talented, clever as paint, well educated. He went to Cambridge and read English as thousands of others have, but he put his degree to Good Use by getting to be an actor, one of those creatures who use the English language at its best practically all the time.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Russell Tovey</b>: &ldquo;I started at the National when I was 19 and I remember the first time I heard about him. I was having vocal coaching with Patsy Rodenburg and we were sat on these chintzy couches. I said they were nice and she said they were donated by Ian. Then I saw him at events for Stonewall and the Terrence Higgins Trust. He has always been at the forefront of activism for gay rights and HIV/Aids. He&rsquo;s a busy man but he finds the time to do it &ndash; then goes off to give an incredible performance in a play.&rdquo;</p><p><b>&mdash; Extracts from &ldquo;&rsquo;<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fculture%2F2019%2Fmay%2F22%2Fian-mckellen-patrick-stewart-judi-dench-anthony-hopkins-derek-jacobi-helen-mirren&amp;t=NzE1ZTYxOTJhMWQ3Yjg1MDY2NDQwNzQ2MDQxMjAxNGM4NTgwMjc3Myw2ZmUyYWMxODA1MWU4ZjQ4ZmE2MzFjNzAxYTM1Zjg0NDk2MmE3ZGZm\" target=\"_blank\">I even loved his Twankey&rsquo;: Dench, Hopkins, Mirren and more on Ian McKellen at 80&rdquo; by Catherine Shoard and Chris Wiegand for <i>The Guardian</i>.</a></b></p></p>",
