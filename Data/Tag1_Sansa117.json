        "question": "Honestly the reason this season\u2019s promos has been Sansa heavy is because she is now another warrior lady that will wear an armor at some point (approved by Sophie Turner). Her unique traits are slowly taken from her and I don\u2019t know how anybody who loves Sansa can be happy with what the show is doing with her.",
        "answer": "<p>I kind of agree and I also disagree. D&amp;D never cared for the more feminine aspects of Sansa which is why her courtesy, knowledge and skills have been reduced down greatly. She\u2019s naive and she knows how to knit, that\u2019s all that\u2019s been retained. Many people still don\u2019t know how many things Sansa was good at. They also reduced the influence of songs and culture so you don\u2019t get why Sansa was raised in that manner. I also don\u2019t like how they remove her many acts of resistance just to develop other characters. I love her relationships with Shae and Margaery but I\u2019d rather they didn\u2019t happen as long as Sansa can be shown to have grown since her father was killed. Sansa was too open and too naive around them. She told Margaery about Joffrey twice in the books and it was brave because it was a risk and it developed both characters in a way that didn\u2019t regress Sansa.\u00a0She never spoke to her maids except to order them because she suspected they\u2019re Cersei\u2019s spies. While Sansa was abused on the show, D&amp;D toned down a lot of the tragedy in her arc. Losing her childhood isn\u2019t great, snarky lines are great but speaking diplomatically and/or kindly is great too. So yeah show Sansa isn\u2019t as complex as book Sansa and D&amp;D have made an effort to distance her from feminine feelings and acts.</p><p>At the same time Sansa has the fourth most screen time in the entire show. She has been steadily building her resume and she has the most connections to other characters (dead or alive). This season will focus on Winterfell and King\u2019s Landing. Sansa is Lady of Winterfell and if we believe Sophie (I do), she\u2019s both self assured, passionate and ready to put everything she\u2019s been taught to practice. She\u2019s prominent in the teasers because she\u2019s likely prominent in the season.\u00a0</p>",
