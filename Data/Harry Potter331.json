Oh and I strongly dislike Rose Tyler, so If you're a fan of hers, don't be surprised to see some anti-Rose sentiment. </p>\n\n\n<center><table cellspacing=\"0\"><tr><td bgcolor=\"#435D36\"

Relieved he could go\nhome with Fred and his family, and of course Y/N, his girlfriend. God- he\ncouldn\u2019t wait to see you! </p><p>As he made his way around the ruins of the battlefield, he\nsaw many faces, and many were familiar. People hugged, chatted, reunited- it\nonly made him more excited. But after a while of searching, he found more\nfamiliar faces\u2026 Harry, Hermione, and they were leaving a crowd. When they saw\nGeorge, instead of smiling, being happy\u2026 they looked so torn up. And seeing\nFred just made it worse\u2026 something\u2019s happened. </p><p>He quickly pushed through the crowd, seeing several familiar\nred heads of his family, until he was in the centre, and he saw him. His\nbrother. His twin. Fred. He was just laid there\u2026 dead. He knew exactly how it\nhad happened, but he was still asking himself how. Could he had stopped it if\nhe was there? </p><p>He couldn\u2019t feel anything more than sadness at that moment.\nJust seeing his best friend since being born, and knowing he wasn\u2019t going to\nwake up. He didn\u2019t try to hide his emotions, he couldn\u2019t. Not even if he tried.\nHe felt his mother\u2019s hand on his shoulder as she tried to reassure him, while\nalso being a mess herself. No one could blame her, she\u2019d just lost her baby\nboy, so she wanted to cling onto the one whose face resembled him almost\nidentically, being afraid he\u2019d fade as well. </p><p>Seeing Fred dead made him think. Made him realise that not\neveryone had made it out alive. Not everyone was as lucky as him. How many were\ndead? How many people that he cared about were dead? He looked around, naming\neach face that he knew, finally being able to see the rest of his family, and\nsome friends\u2026 but one was missing. His heart dropped. </p><p>\u201cW-Where\u2019s Y/N? Where is she?\u201d He asked, looking around\ndesperately. His family looked around for you. You and George had been together\nsince your first year in Hogwarts, and you were one of the few who could tell\nFred and George apart. You were as much trouble as the twins, but when you and\nGeorge were together, everyone could see a more mature side to George. You were\npractically family to the Weasley\u2019s by the time Harry, Hermione and Ron had\nstarted their first year. The younger Weasley\u2019s you as an older sister, and the\nolder as a younger sister, and George\u2019s mother and father were very quick to\ntake you in as family. Why weren\u2019t you here? Had you seen him and walked away\nto be alone, thinking it was him? Or to just mourn? He stood up, looking over\nthe several dozen heads for you. \u201cY/N?\u201d He called. </p><p>He forced himself away from his family and brother,\ndesperate to find you. He needed to find you. He ran through the ruins once\nagain, looking left right and centre for any sign of you. He went down one of\nthe corridors, calling your name. He\u2019d last seen you down there, and he hoped\nthat you\u2019d maybe gotten lost, or got a little injured so had hidden the rest of\nthe fight. </p><p>Then he turned the corner, and there you were. </p><p>He froze. He couldn\u2019t move. You were there, alone. Alone,\nand on the floor. Not moving. \u201cNo\u2026no\u2026\u201d He shook his head, finally forcing his\nlegs to move closer to you. As he came closer, he saw that you had no injury.\nNo sign of it being from a blast, or bleeding out, or anything else. It became\nabundantly clear what you had died from. The Killing Curse. \u201cNo-no-no-no\u2026.\nplease no\u2026 Y/N.\u201d He sobbed, his legs going weak beneath him as he collapsed\nbeside your body.</p><p>Your face was almost peaceful, though your eyes showed no\nlight and didn\u2019t blink. Your face resembled that of you daydreaming back in a\nclass years ago. Back when you were alive. You were on your back, which told\nGeorge you\u2019d seen the face of your killer before they took your life. You had\nseen it coming for a split second before you were murdered. While with Fred he\nonly held his hand, he couldn\u2019t help himself from picking you up and pulling\nyou tightly into his chest, just cradling you. His wailing made the footsteps\nof his family approaching silent to his ears, and told them what he\u2019d found at\nthe end of the hallways. His siblings all remained behind at the end, all\nsobbing at the sight. His mother had to force herself to swallow and hold back\ntears as she approached her son, kneeling beside him and putting an arm around\nhim. He looked up, letting her see your face. Beside a few small marks, you\nwere untouched, telling her how you perished. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay George\u2026 she died quickly, she didn\u2019t have pain\u2026\nIt\u2019s alright.\u201d She tried to assure, even though it tore her up as well.</p><p>\u201cI could have saved her\u2026 I should have been here- I could\nhave protected her- sacrificed myself-\u201c </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare say that George! That would mean she would\nbe alone. She wouldn\u2019t have wanted that.\u201d She tried to assure him more, as he\ncontinued to sob, holding tightly onto you. </p><p>\u201cI was gonna marry her, mum. I was gonna marry her. I-I had\na ring and everything- I was gonna propose to her after all of this was over.\nI\u2019d see her, and I\u2019d just hold her so tightly, and just ask her. We were gonna\nget married, have kids and grow old\u2026\u201d He admitted, loud enough for not only\nher, but for those at the end of the hallways. It wasn\u2019t just his family\nanymore. It was Hermione, Harry, and so many others who had followed after\nthem. No one approached, knowing who was speaking, who he was talking about,\nand it didn\u2019t fail to make everyone\u2019s heart ache for him. \u201cIT\u2019S NOT FAIR!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know son, I know\u2026\u201d Molly\u2019s voice sobbed, just holding her\nson and letting him mourn. He\u2019d not only lost his twin brother, his best\nfriend. He\u2019s also lost a girl who in no doubt was the closest anyone could get\nto a soulmate. </p><hr><p>Hope you like it!

God- he\ncouldn\u2019t wait to see you! </p><p>As he made his way around the ruins of the battlefield, he\nsaw many faces, and many were familiar. People hugged, chatted, reunited- it\nonly made him more excited. But after a while of searching, he found more\nfamiliar faces\u2026 Harry, Hermione, and they were leaving a crowd. When they saw\nGeorge, instead of smiling, being happy\u2026 they looked so torn up. And seeing\nFred just made it worse\u2026 something\u2019s happened. </p><p>He quickly pushed through the crowd, seeing several familiar\nred heads of his family, until he was in the centre, and he saw him. His\nbrother. His twin. Fred. He was just laid there\u2026 dead. He knew exactly how it\nhad happened, but he was still asking himself how. Could he had stopped it if\nhe was there? </p><p>He couldn\u2019t feel anything more than sadness at that moment.\nJust seeing his best friend since being born, and knowing he wasn\u2019t going to\nwake up. He didn\u2019t try to hide his emotions, he couldn\u2019t. Not even if he tried.\nHe felt his mother\u2019s hand on his shoulder as she tried to reassure him, while\nalso being a mess herself. No one could blame her, she\u2019d just lost her baby\nboy, so she wanted to cling onto the one whose face resembled him almost\nidentically, being afraid he\u2019d fade as well. </p><p>Seeing Fred dead made him think. Made him realise that not\neveryone had made it out alive. Not everyone was as lucky as him. How many were\ndead? How many people that he cared about were dead? He looked around, naming\neach face that he knew, finally being able to see the rest of his family, and\nsome friends\u2026 but one was missing. His heart dropped. </p><p>\u201cW-Where\u2019s Y/N? Where is she?\u201d He asked, looking around\ndesperately. His family looked around for you. You and George had been together\nsince your first year in Hogwarts, and you were one of the few who could tell\nFred and George apart. You were as much trouble as the twins, but when you and\nGeorge were together, everyone could see a more mature side to George. You were\npractically family to the Weasley\u2019s by the time Harry, Hermione and Ron had\nstarted their first year. The younger Weasley\u2019s you as an older sister, and the\nolder as a younger sister, and George\u2019s mother and father were very quick to\ntake you in as family. Why weren\u2019t you here? Had you seen him and walked away\nto be alone, thinking it was him? Or to just mourn? He stood up, looking over\nthe several dozen heads for you. \u201cY/N?\u201d He called. </p><p>He forced himself away from his family and brother,\ndesperate to find you. He needed to find you. He ran through the ruins once\nagain, looking left right and centre for any sign of you. He went down one of\nthe corridors, calling your name. He\u2019d last seen you down there, and he hoped\nthat you\u2019d maybe gotten lost, or got a little injured so had hidden the rest of\nthe fight. </p><p>Then he turned the corner, and there you were. </p><p>He froze. He couldn\u2019t move. You were there, alone. Alone,\nand on the floor. Not moving. \u201cNo\u2026no\u2026\u201d He shook his head, finally forcing his\nlegs to move closer to you. As he came closer, he saw that you had no injury.\nNo sign of it being from a blast, or bleeding out, or anything else. It became\nabundantly clear what you had died from. The Killing Curse. \u201cNo-no-no-no\u2026.\nplease no\u2026 Y/N.\u201d He sobbed, his legs going weak beneath him as he collapsed\nbeside your body.</p><p>Your face was almost peaceful, though your eyes showed no\nlight and didn\u2019t blink. Your face resembled that of you daydreaming back in a\nclass years ago. Back when you were alive. You were on your back, which told\nGeorge you\u2019d seen the face of your killer before they took your life. You had\nseen it coming for a split second before you were murdered. While with Fred he\nonly held his hand, he couldn\u2019t help himself from picking you up and pulling\nyou tightly into his chest, just cradling you. His wailing made the footsteps\nof his family approaching silent to his ears, and told them what he\u2019d found at\nthe end of the hallways. His siblings all remained behind at the end, all\nsobbing at the sight. His mother had to force herself to swallow and hold back\ntears as she approached her son, kneeling beside him and putting an arm around\nhim. He looked up, letting her see your face. Beside a few small marks, you\nwere untouched, telling her how you perished. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay George\u2026 she died quickly, she didn\u2019t have pain\u2026\nIt\u2019s alright.\u201d She tried to assure, even though it tore her up as well.</p><p>\u201cI could have saved her\u2026 I should have been here- I could\nhave protected her- sacrificed myself-\u201c </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare say that George! That would mean she would\nbe alone. She wouldn\u2019t have wanted that.\u201d She tried to assure him more, as he\ncontinued to sob, holding tightly onto you. </p><p>\u201cI was gonna marry her, mum. I was gonna marry her. I-I had\na ring and everything- I was gonna propose to her after all of this was over.\nI\u2019d see her, and I\u2019d just hold her so tightly, and just ask her. We were gonna\nget married, have kids and grow old\u2026\u201d He admitted, loud enough for not only\nher, but for those at the end of the hallways. It wasn\u2019t just his family\nanymore. It was Hermione, Harry, and so many others who had followed after\nthem. No one approached, knowing who was speaking, who he was talking about,\nand it didn\u2019t fail to make everyone\u2019s heart ache for him. \u201cIT\u2019S NOT FAIR!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know son, I know\u2026\u201d Molly\u2019s voice sobbed, just holding her\nson and letting him mourn. He\u2019d not only lost his twin brother, his best\nfriend. He\u2019s also lost a girl who in no doubt was the closest anyone could get\nto a soulmate. </p><hr><p>Hope you like it!

You all forgave him for the danger he put Harry in; &rsquo;<i>for the greater good</i>&rsquo;, but I haven&rsquo;t. <b>You can&rsquo;t change my mind and I can&rsquo;t change yours</b>.</p><p>I&rsquo;m sorry for the long post, but I&rsquo;d really like everyone to understand this. I&rsquo;m going to bed now, so you can all argue with each other if you&rsquo;d like.</p>",
