Arya said it herself, they needed her . They\u2019d all be dead without her. Also since when do the northern lords care about northern independence. Robb had to practically force some of them to fight for him. They had no problems bending the knee to the Bolton\u2019s who knelt to Cersei fucking Lannister. And now we\u2019re supposed to buy Daenerys is just too much. They were fine with <i>Cersei. </i>But the woman that risked everything to save them was too much. </p><p>3) also why would they have a problem with a forgein or Southern Queen? They were fine with Cersei and before that was Talisa, born and raised in Essos. Danny was at least born in Westeros. </p><p>4) I\u2019m also getting really sick of this \u201cJon is too honest to keep secrets or lie shit\u201d. He literally lied to the Wildlings for months, the women he loved for months. He has let everyone in the North believe he bent the knee for Danny\u2019s army, never correcting them that she vowed to fight before that. But now when it\u2019s convenient to the plot he just can\u2019t keep a secret. When its Daenerys\u2019 life and future on the line. </p><p>5) Also people need to stop acting like Danny was even kind of a bad guy in that scene. This was her future and her life on the line. All Jon had to do was not tell anyone and she would be fine. If he truley didn\u2019t want the throne there was no reason not to tell anyone. And she was fucking right! People are already turning on her and plotting to kill her bc he opened his godamn mouth. Well at least he made Sam happy.</p><p>6) why the fuck are Sansa and Arya still against Daenerys. At this point this is some Cersei level backstabbing. Danny sacrifices half her army for you and her most loyal advisor, plus her best chance at the throne. And you still mistrust her? For what reason? She\u2019s given them no reason. She has gone out of her way to make peace with Sansa. If they still dislike her at this point it\u2019s for much less pure motives. </p><p>7) GHOST</p><p><br/></p><p>8) that whole war council scene. Jon comes off as whipped and Danny comes of as out of control. All of it was ooc and it was trash. Plus, Danny isn\u2019t wrong. She waited and Cersei doubles her army. If she waits even longer Cersei might triple it, move against them and Sansa will continue to undermine her support. It\u2019s literally no longer safe for her here since Jon spilled the beans. If she doesn\u2019t get the throne now people will start to conspire to put Jon in her place. </p><p>9) Danny wanting to attack KL. While a) out of character (considering she just spent all of season 7 losing the war to avoid doing exactly that and risked her chance at the throne to save the lives of millions of innocent people and now I\u2019m supposed to believe she doesn\u2019t care so long as she can have the thrones. \ud83d\ude44 ) it\u2019s also not a \u2018crazy\u2019 tactic. Literally every single person who has taken King Landing or any city or castle has murdered thousands of innocent people to do so and not a single one of them were called mad for it.</p><p>10) The Starks have married aunts to nephew before or at least niece to uncle. stop talking. Stop Talking SHUT UP. LEARN YOURE GODDMAN SHIT IF YOURE GOING TO MAKE A FUCKING SHOW ON IT</p><p>11) Varys saying dicks matter. <i>Varys. </i>Who has actively ridiculed men for thinking with their dicks. \ud83d\ude42he thinks it would be better to have a man on the throne bc he has a dick. \ud83d\ude43</p><p>12) how the FUCK did no one see Euron? How the fuck did they hit Rhaegal and not Drogon? \ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude43</p><p>13) literally all the rest of the fucking ep.</p><p>14) Fucking Jaime. \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21</p><p>15) MISSANDEI OF FUCKING NAATH\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25</p>",

And she accepts it.<br/></p><p>Was there ever a throne to rightfully take back, considering her father tried to burn the country alive before being cast down, or that her ancestors conquered the continent and forged the throne to force the seven kingdoms into servitude?<br/></p><p>Dany doesn&rsquo;t know these facts because of Viserys&rsquo;s lies, but she learns them during her journey, and still she persists.

This is one of the most shocking pieces of dialogue that the show has ever offered up. I&rsquo;m talking about Dany&rsquo;s willingnes to commit genocide:</p></blockquote><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/889d1d0b4da4d0c1d01c4d359245e1b0/tumblr_inline_pr6m7zk7Rg1rldz3m_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><blockquote><p>I feel I need to preface this thread by saying that I think Dany is probably the best character on GoT. She&rsquo;s not my favourite, but very few of the others are as beautifully realised as she is. The last two seasons have not changed that view. They have just reinforced it.<br /></p><p>She&rsquo;s pretty unique in all the fiction I&rsquo;ve read, and I think she&rsquo;ll be considered GRRM&rsquo;s greatest achievement long after he&rsquo;s gone. Not because she&rsquo;s the hero of the tale but precisely because she isn&rsquo;t. Dany&rsquo;s story has always been destined for a great tragedy.<br /></p><p>There has always been the foreboding feeling that her motivations for wanting the iron throne never quite made sense, but for a long time that worry was secondary to her own survival; something that didn&rsquo;t need to be addressed while assassins and kings were trying to kill her.<br /></p><p>We need to address it now, however. Part of the reason we tended to overlook the darker implication of her ambition was because she was forced rise up against her enemies just to survive, but at some point you need to examine the choices and the allies you&rsquo;ve made along the way.<br /></p><p>Was there really ever any justification for setting the dothraki, a culture of enslavers who acknowledge only power, and rape and pillage their way across the world, onto the path to Westeros just to take the throne?<br /></p><p>There&rsquo;s a scene early on in the books where she sees the dothraki raping a young woman whose family they have just murdered, and she silently thinks to herself through tears that this is the cost of war. And she accepts it.<br /></p><p>Was there ever a throne to rightfully take back, considering her father tried to burn the country alive before being cast down, or that her ancestors conquered the continent and forged the throne to force the seven kingdoms into servitude?<br /></p><p>Dany doesn&rsquo;t know these facts because of Viserys&rsquo;s lies, but she learns them during her journey, and still she persists. The irony is that she had everything in Meereen. She had a people, a man who loved her, a purpose that was purer than her reasons for conquering Westeros.<br /></p><p>Freeing slaves is easy when you have the power to do so, but in Westeros her family were the masters who rode in on their winged warheads and burned people with impunity until they submitted. Invisible chains are still chains.<br /></p><p>Her birthright is no longer valid on account of her father being replaced, and evils committed against innocent children in her family do not justify other evils committed in the name of taking back a throne that is nothing but a tool of oppression.<br /></p><p>If A Song of Ice and Fire is a reference work to Lord of the Rings (and it is) then the throne itself is the ring. It&rsquo;s the absolute power that corrupts absolutely. It&rsquo;s the wheel Aegon built, which Dany once claimed she wanted to break but now wants to put back up on its axis.<br /></p><p>Her comment was taken by Tyrion as a desire to build a better world, but it must be seen by the viewers in light of Dany&rsquo;s motivation to grab and hold power. And it is increasingly clear now that she meant to ensure no one else will ever be powerful enough to rise up against her.<br /></p><p>This is why Jon&rsquo;s parentage has been saved for a final confrontation: it&rsquo;s not because he has a better claim on account of being ahead in the line of succession to a cast down king. It&rsquo;s because it invalidates Dany&rsquo;s pretext for wanting to rule. This season finally unmasked her.<br /></p><p>Without it she is a conqueror who wants to grab power because she can. She prides herself on ending slavery, but her family enslaved Westeros for centuries. You can&rsquo;t on one hand be the breaker of chains and on the other force people into submission under threat of death.<br /></p><p>This is something Cersei, Stannis, Tywin and Roose Bolton would also have done.
