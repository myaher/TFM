It was the first day of another year in this hell hole. It was only seven and I already had my headphones in and my music cranked. I didn&rsquo;t want to attract any attention to my self so I walked with my hood up and head down. As I strolled through the doors I was met with rushing high schoolers. They screamed and pushed through the halls to get to their first class for the day. I stood and looked around at the various halls before being slammed into from behind. As soon as I was hit my books went flying in front of me as I knelt on the ground. A boy I hadn&rsquo;t seen before knelt down in front of me and started gathering my things. I looked at him for a second before seeing his mouth move and realize he was trying to talk to me. I ripped a headphone out of my ear and started taking my things from him.</p><p>&ldquo;-im such a mess.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>He just looked at me for a second as if I had two heads. Then it dawned on him.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh um, I&rsquo;m sorry for running into you, I wasn&rsquo;t paying attention to where I was going. I guess I can&rsquo;t help it sometimes.&rdquo;</p><p>He laughed a little and helped me off the ground, looking between me and another kid</p><p>&ldquo;No it&rsquo;s fine. I mean it&rsquo;s the first day of school, you have reason to be a little giddy.&rdquo;</p><p>He stuck his hand out for me to shake, I shifted me books to one arm and accepted.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n&rdquo;</p><p>His friend piped up.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m ned.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter looked at him weird but returned his attention to me.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to meet you y/n.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Likewise.&rdquo;</p><p>He smiled at me for a second, not saying anything. I looked between the two of them and the warning bell rang.</p><p>&ldquo;Well Peter, ned, I should probably get to class. Don&rsquo;t want to be late the first day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right, of course. Maybe I&rsquo;ll catch you at lunch.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah maybe.&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded at me and I walked away from them, down the hall and into my first hour.</p><p>\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0</p><p>When lunch rolled around I wandered around the cafeteria before deciding on sitting outside where most of the jocks ate. They were normally the only ones in the courtyard so I didn&rsquo;t have much to worry about. Besides I used to date one of the football players so it was a little more familiar than the crowded cafeteria. I got my lunch and made my way outside, sitting at a table alone on the far side of the concrete. I put my headphones in and began eating. Half way through I looked around to see if that Peter kid would actually try to find me. I mean I wasn&rsquo;t hard to find but most people avoid the courtyard. Ten minutes later and the bell rang, signaling the end of lunch. I guess he really didn&rsquo;t want to catch me at lunch.</p><p>I took my time walking to my fifth hour science class. It was environmental science which was my favorite but I didn&rsquo;t really care to much for the teacher. Right when I stepped in the door I was met face to face with Peter. He looked at me for a second before I ducked past him and took a seat. He turned on his heel and followed me to the empty table towards the back of the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you bail at lunch?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I looked for you almost the whole lunch period, but I couldn&rsquo;t find you.&rdquo;</p><p>I just smiled to myself and shook my head.</p><p>&ldquo;I was outside. Ya know, where all the sporty guys sit.&rdquo;</p><p>He looked at me in disbelief.</p><p>&ldquo;Really? Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because no one else ever goes out there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm, do they ever bother you &hellip;. while youre out there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, not that I&rsquo;ve noticed. I normally have my headphones in. Ya know, pretending I don&rsquo;t exist.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why would you-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr Parker, class has started, if your little conversation back there is so important, would you care to share it with the class?</p><p>&quot;Uh no sir, sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>The teacher looked between the two of us and continued his lecture about the study course. I quickly opened my notebook and scribbled something between glances at the teacher. I slid it to peter, who followed suit with the same actions. When he slid it back I just smiled down at it before folding it and tucking it in my jacket pocket.</p><p>\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0</p><p>The final bell rang and I made my way to the track/football field as fast as I could without running. I wanted to finally talk to Peter without any interruptions. I made my way down the stairs and across the plate of concrete that led to the bleachers. I sat and looked around for him before taking the note out of my pocket and scanning it over again. I smiled down at what he had wrote and no more than a second later the note was ripped from my hand. My head snapped up and I yelled at ronnie, the quarterback, standing in front of me.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey give that back!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, who&rsquo;s it from?&rdquo;</p><p>I stood and leaned over the fence separating the two of us but he backed out of my reach.</p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter who it&rsquo;s from, just give it back!&rdquo;</p><p>I stomped my foot on the metal floor and it rang in my ears.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh no, it totally matters who it&rsquo;s from. Ya know I saw you talking to that Parker kid earlier. Is this from him?&rdquo;</p><p>I crossed my arms over my chest and looked at the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;Meet me on the bleachers after last hour, we can get to know each other then. Can&rsquo;t wait. Winky face.&rdquo;</p><p>He mocked before looking directly at me. I glared at him.</p><p>&ldquo;really? A winky face?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just give it back.&rdquo;</p><p>I reached over to grab it again and he pulled away.</p><p>&ldquo;Ya know y/n I have half a brain to beat the shit outta this kid when he gets here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you respected me enough you wouldn&rsquo;t have to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You see this is why it didn&rsquo;t work between us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No it didn&rsquo;t work between us because \u00a0I caught you making out with our bio teacher.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey that&rsquo;s not fair.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s completely fair.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine, whatever, but if he so much as lays I finger on you I&rsquo;m kicking his ass.&rdquo;</p><p>I rolled my eyes and he handed the note back.</p><p>&ldquo;You kick his ass I&rsquo;m getting a restraining order against you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why you little-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey y/n how&rsquo;s it going? Sorry I&rsquo;m a little late, I had to finish something.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter walked up the stairs to meet me just like he said he would.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s no problem.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This guy giving you trouble?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing I&rsquo;m not used to, but it&rsquo;s fine he was just leaving, wouldn&rsquo;t want to be late for practice.&rdquo;</p><p>The last bit was more said to Ronnie than Peter but they both caught on. Ron glared at Peter before addressing me again.</p><p>&ldquo;One finger his ass is mine.&rdquo;</p><p>He turned and walked away earning a sigh from me.</p><p>&ldquo;What was that about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, hes just a little protective of me. You&rsquo;d think after being broken up for almost a year he&rsquo;d be over it by now.&rdquo;</p><p>We both turned and sat.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, broken up? You two dated?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, it was only like three months but we were still together.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter rubbed his hands on his legs and faced the guys running around the field.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow. I guess I just didn&rsquo;t peg you as the &lsquo;date a jock&rsquo; type.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>He just nodded and turned to me again.</p><p>&ldquo;What kind of type are you into, ya know, now?&rdquo;</p><p>I just laughed and shook my head.</p><p>&ldquo;Not jocks I&rsquo;ll tell you that, but I&rsquo;ll let you know when we&rsquo;ve known each other a little longer.&rdquo;</p><p>He rubbed his hands on his pants again and nodded his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</p><p>We spent the next hour talking and getting to know each other. He seemed interesting and by the time we left he had invited me over to hang out. I was glad he ran into me, if he hadn&rsquo;t I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have made a new friend.</p>",

Maybe I\u2019ll catch you at lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah maybe.\u201d</p><p>He nodded at me and I walked away from them, down the hall and into my first hour.</p><p>\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0</p><p>When lunch rolled around I wandered around the cafeteria before deciding on sitting outside where most of the jocks ate. They were normally the only ones in the courtyard so I didn\u2019t have much to worry about. Besides I used to date one of the football players so it was a little more familiar than the crowded cafeteria. I got my lunch and made my way outside, sitting at a table alone on the far side of the concrete. I put my headphones in and began eating. Half way through I looked around to see if that Peter kid would actually try to find me. I mean I wasn\u2019t hard to find but most people avoid the courtyard. Ten minutes later and the bell rang, signaling the end of lunch. I guess he really didn\u2019t want to catch me at lunch.</p><p>I took my time walking to my fifth hour science class. It was environmental science which was my favorite but I didn\u2019t really care to much for the teacher. Right when I stepped in the door I was met face to face with Peter. He looked at me for a second before I ducked past him and took a seat. He turned on his heel and followed me to the empty table towards the back of the room.</p><p>\u201cDid you bail at lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI looked for you almost the whole lunch period, but I couldn\u2019t find you.\u201d</p><p>I just smiled to myself and shook my head.</p><p>\u201cI was outside. Ya know, where all the sporty guys sit.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cReally? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause no one else ever goes out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, do they ever bother you \u2026. while youre out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, not that I\u2019ve noticed. I normally have my headphones in. Ya know, pretending I don\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr Parker, class has started, if your little conversation back there is so important, would you care to share it with the class?</p><p>\"Uh no sir, sorry.\u201d</p><p>The teacher looked between the two of us and continued his lecture about the study course. I quickly opened my notebook and scribbled something between glances at the teacher. I slid it to peter, who followed suit with the same actions. When he slid it back I just smiled down at it before folding it and tucking it in my jacket pocket.</p><p>\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0</p><p>The final bell rang and I made my way to the track/football field as fast as I could without running. I wanted to finally talk to Peter without any interruptions. I made my way down the stairs and across the plate of concrete that led to the bleachers. I sat and looked around for him before taking the note out of my pocket and scanning it over again. I smiled down at what he had wrote and no more than a second later the note was ripped from my hand. My head snapped up and I yelled at ronnie, the quarterback, standing in front of me.</p><p>\u201cHey give that back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, who\u2019s it from?\u201d</p><p>I stood and leaned over the fence separating the two of us but he backed out of my reach.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who it\u2019s from, just give it back!\u201d</p><p>I stomped my foot on the metal floor and it rang in my ears.</p><p>\u201cOh no, it totally matters who it\u2019s from. Ya know I saw you talking to that Parker kid earlier. Is this from him?\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms over my chest and looked at the ground.</p><p>\u201cMeet me on the bleachers after last hour, we can get to know each other then. Can\u2019t wait. Winky face.\u201d</p><p>He mocked before looking directly at me. I glared at him.</p><p>\u201creally? A winky face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust give it back.\u201d</p><p>I reached over to grab it again and he pulled away.</p><p>\u201cYa know y/n I have half a brain to beat the shit outta this kid when he gets here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you respected me enough you wouldn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see this is why it didn\u2019t work between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo it didn\u2019t work between us because \u00a0I caught you making out with our bio teacher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey that\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s completely fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, whatever, but if he so much as lays I finger on you I\u2019m kicking his ass.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and he handed the note back.</p><p>\u201cYou kick his ass I\u2019m getting a restraining order against you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you little-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey y/n how\u2019s it going? Sorry I\u2019m a little late, I had to finish something.\u201d</p><p>Peter walked up the stairs to meet me just like he said he would.</p><p>\u201cOh it\u2019s no problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis guy giving you trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing I\u2019m not used to, but it\u2019s fine he was just leaving, wouldn\u2019t want to be late for practice.\u201d</p><p>The last bit was more said to Ronnie than Peter but they both caught on. Ron glared at Peter before addressing me again.</p><p>\u201cOne finger his ass is mine.\u201d</p><p>He turned and walked away earning a sigh from me.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, hes just a little protective of me. You\u2019d think after being broken up for almost a year he\u2019d be over it by now.\u201d</p><p>We both turned and sat.</p><p>\u201cWait, broken up? You two dated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was only like three months but we were still together.\u201d</p><p>Peter rubbed his hands on his legs and faced the guys running around the field.</p><p>\u201cWow. I guess I just didn\u2019t peg you as the \u2018date a jock\u2019 type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>He just nodded and turned to me again.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of type are you into, ya know, now?\u201d</p><p>I just laughed and shook my head.</p><p>\u201cNot jocks I\u2019ll tell you that, but I\u2019ll let you know when we\u2019ve known each other a little longer.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his hands on his pants again and nodded his head.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>We spent the next hour talking and getting to know each other. He seemed interesting and by the time we left he had invited me over to hang out. I was glad he ran into me, if he hadn\u2019t I probably wouldn\u2019t have made a new friend.</p>",
                "content": "<p>+++++++++<br /></p><p>It took me almost three weeks to finish this so if it sucks deal with it. I am seeing the new movie Tuesday (July 18th) so even if this isn&rsquo;t to character it&rsquo;s because I haven&rsquo;t seen that yet (while writing) to get a full grasp. &nbsp;it&rsquo;s longer than I&rsquo;d hoped and the title doesn&rsquo;t really work with it.</p><p>Edit: I &nbsp;just saw the movie (July 18) and I edited a little bit but not a whole lot. I enjoyed the movie a lot but this doesn&rsquo;t really have spoilers and doesn&rsquo;t really go with the story line. Peter is also still Spiderman in this and it would sort of take place on the first day of junior or senior year. The movie takes place during his sophomore year.</p><p>Song: get me out by falling in reverse</p><p>+++++++++</p><p>I made my way up the steps to midtown high. It was the first day of another year in this hell hole. It was only seven and I already had my headphones in and my music cranked. I didn&rsquo;t want to attract any attention to my self so I walked with my hood up and head down. As I strolled through the doors I was met with rushing high schoolers. They screamed and pushed through the halls to get to their first class for the day. I stood and looked around at the various halls before being slammed into from behind. As soon as I was hit my books went flying in front of me as I knelt on the ground. A boy I hadn&rsquo;t seen before knelt down in front of me and started gathering my things. I looked at him for a second before seeing his mouth move and realize he was trying to talk to me. I ripped a headphone out of my ear and started taking my things from him.</p><p>&ldquo;-im such a mess.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>He just looked at me for a second as if I had two heads. Then it dawned on him.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh um, I&rsquo;m sorry for running into you, I wasn&rsquo;t paying attention to where I was going. I guess I can&rsquo;t help it sometimes.&rdquo;</p><p>He laughed a little and helped me off the ground, looking between me and another kid</p><p>&ldquo;No it&rsquo;s fine. I mean it&rsquo;s the first day of school, you have reason to be a little giddy.&rdquo;</p><p>He stuck his hand out for me to shake, I shifted me books to one arm and accepted.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n&rdquo;</p><p>His friend piped up.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m ned.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter looked at him weird but returned his attention to me.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to meet you y/n.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Likewise.&rdquo;</p><p>He smiled at me for a second, not saying anything.
