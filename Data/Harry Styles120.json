        "body": "<p>I&rsquo;ve been here, in LA for five months and two weeks and in the time I had met up with an old friend, started dating that old friend and then gotten engaged to said old friend. </p><p>Before you jump ahead of yourself you should know a few things about him. </p><p>1st: his name is Harry, and he is 24 years old. I am the same age as he his. Only a couple month younger.</p><p>2nd: I met Harry when I was 7 years old and I moved onto the same street as he and his family and I became fast friends with him and his sister.</p><p>3rd: His older sister is my best friend.</p><p>4th: Harry was in a very big boyband and when he went touring around the world we lost our way, I used to have a huge crush on him and when he left I told me he felt the same but then he got to busy to deal with a relationship so we broke up. It was mutual, we just didn&rsquo;t have time with each other. After that we only spoke when he visited his family and even then we didn&rsquo;t say much. </p><p>Jump to about seven and a half months ago when I found my boyfriend in bed with my mum, which is not surprising she was always a dick and she was never home. She was always out partying, drinking spending the weekend high of her tits with some junkie who was looking to sleep with her. She shacked up with my boyfriend, in my house, then kicked me out. She then began dating my Ex and I moved in with Gemma until a found a new place.</p><p>Not long after that I got an opportunity to spend six months in the states, LA to be exact, working on my Photography. I packed everything I needed, said goodbye to Anne and Gemma and took off to LA. </p><p>Two weeks in and I was happy to be away from my bitch of a mother and Ex, but I missed my family with Gemma and Anne so I did the only thing I could think of at the time. Call Harry. </p><p>We met up for coffee and then became really good friends again until I began feeling things for him again and I began to distance my self. Harry noticed and wouldn&rsquo;t let me go until I told him what was going on. I told him and next thing you know we&rsquo;re dating.</p><p>The last night Harry and I got talking and some how, I don&rsquo;t remember exactly, he asked me to marry him and I said yes, we decided to just do it, without our family because if we did they would talk us out of it and we didn&rsquo;t want to be turn apart by people who didn&rsquo;t quite understand. So here we are, Harry and I, stood out side of the city hall, waiting nervously, for our names to me called.</p><p>I sat there, my hand in his, feeling like I was about to throw up, me knee bouncing up and down and I watched as people walked past. Before we had even woken up properly, Harry and I were out the house and shopping, for everything we would need. I bought a nice white skater dress and a pair of blue converse&hellip;because I swore I wasn&rsquo;t getting married in anything BUT converse. I had on a necklace my dad had bought me when I was 12, before he died and I also had on a bracelet I had borrowed from Gemma a while ago. </p><p>So I had something Old, Something new, something borrowed and something blue. Next stop was a jewellery shop, where we bought a couple silver rings and Harry insisted on buying me an engagement ring that matched.</p><p>We then headed home where we changed and then headed back out, this time to the city hall where Harry had managed to book us and appointment to get married.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, you OK?&rdquo; Harry asked, pulling me out of my thoughts. I looked up into his big green eyes and somehow I felt all my nerves wash away. I smiled and nodded, leaning up and kissing his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m about to marry you, I&rsquo;m so much better than OK.&rdquo; I told him as I pulled away. </p><p>&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re not having second thoughts?&rdquo; He asked. I saw worry and panic flash behind his eyes and I shook my head. </p><p>&ldquo;No, Harry, no second thoughts, no cold feet, nothing but excitement and love for you.&rdquo; I reassured him. </p><p>&ldquo;Is this not what you want?&rdquo; I questioned. He let out a sharp, loud laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;Ha, this is what I&rsquo;ve wanted since I was 7 years old and you moved into the house down my street.&rdquo; he informed me.</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; I asked, feeling a little shocked. He had told me about his crush on me growing up, Like I said before, we dated for a few months after he felt for tour with One Direction.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, my mum used to make fun of me for it.&rdquo; He chuckled. </p><p>&ldquo;Are we doing the right thing, not waiting for our family I mean?&rdquo; I asked when I noticed Harry&rsquo;s smile fade a little at the mention of his mum.</p><p>&ldquo;We are, we love each other and that&rsquo;s all that matters to me.&rdquo; He told me as he kissed the back of my hand. I was about to answer when our names were called. </p><p>&ldquo;Styles/Y/L/N&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s us.&rdquo; I smiled as we stood up. </p><p>We walked towards the woman who called our names and she led us into a big ass room that wall pretty empty. Just a table and a woman stood at the end in a smart black suit and black heeled shoes. </p><p>&ldquo;Hello, my name is Emma Black, I will be marrying you two today. Is there anybody else coming today?&rdquo; She asked as she reached her. </p><p>&ldquo;No, just the two of us.&rdquo; Harry smiled, tightening his grip on my hand just a little. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s get started shall we.&rdquo; She grinned and opened the book in her hands. </p><p>&ldquo;Today, we are gathered to celebrate the love you two share for each other and to allow the eyes of the law and god to see the love you to share as you are bound together in matrimony.&rdquo; She read then looked up at the two of us. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s OK with you, I would like you to read your vows.&rdquo; She gestured to Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;OK, well, as this was a pretty quick decision, I didn&rsquo;t really right anything, so i&rsquo;m just gonna tell you why I want this.&rdquo; He spoke, taking both my hands in his and turning me to face him.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, I have done since I was 7 years old. We drifted apart and I think that was what we needed to because when we found each other again, I got to fall in love with you all over again and remember why you made my heart skip a beat every time you smile.&rdquo; as he spoke my eyes filled with tears and I guess one fell because he wiped it away with his thumb as he continued.</p><p>&ldquo;There have been other people in our time apart and I like to think that the reason it didn&rsquo;t work out with any of them is because we belong together and we were destined to be here. We belong together and when we return home and tell my mum we got married she&rsquo;ll be happy and cry&hellip;and my sister will kill us.&rdquo; He chuckled making me laugh to.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you Y/N so much and I am so grateful that you said yes and after today will be spending our lives together. We will have our ups and downs, we&rsquo;ll fight and make up and I&rsquo;ll make you angry and upset but I will always remind you, everyday, that I love you and I always will.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Y/L/N, your turn.&rdquo; Emma smiled and I nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;OK, well, that&rsquo;s gonna be hard to top.&rdquo; I chuckled &ldquo;But six months ago, I felt my life was over, My boyfriend cheated on my with my mum. My dad was gone and the only people I had to turn to were Gemma and your mum. Then something great happened. I got an offer from my job to spend six months in LA and I took it. I packed my bags, said bye to Gemma and your mum and I took off. I felt lost after I got here, I didn&rsquo;t know anybody and I hated that I had nobody close by to talk to. Then I remember you. My childhood best friend. The boy who moved away to become a big star.</p><p>&quot;When I called you six months ago I just needed a piece of home. Somebody I knew to talk to and for my life to start looking up. But I got so much more. I got my best friend back, I fell in love and now I have a husband who I will love and cherish forever. </p><p>&quot;We have a hell of a journey ahead of us and I can&rsquo;t wait to share it with you. I love you Harry with all my heart and if when we get back to England and Gemma really does kill us, I&rsquo;ll die happy knowing I got to spend these last six months with you and my last days married to you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;OK, Guys, that was beautiful. shall we continue?&rdquo; She asked and we both nodded. </p><p>&ldquo;Ok, Harry do you take Y/N to be your lawful wedded wife? Do you promise to love her when times are tough? Do you promise to keep her safe from harm and make her happy any way you can? Do you swear to always be there for her when she needs you and be honest and truthful for as long as you both shall live?&rdquo; Emma asked. </p><p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo; Harry grinned as he slipped a ring onto my finger. Another tear fell from my eyes and he wiped them away as Emma began again.</p><p>&ldquo;And Y/N do you take Harry to be your lawful wedded Husband? Do you promise to love him when times are tough? Do you promise to keep him safe from harm and make him happy any way you can? Do you swear to always be there for him when he needs you and be honest and truthful for as long as you both shall live? \u00a0</p><p>&quot;I do.&rdquo; I whispered as I slipped the ring on his finger. </p><p>&ldquo;Well then, by the power vested in me, by the State of California and the United States of America, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Congratulations you my now kiss your spouse.&rdquo; She smiled taking a step back.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t even have time to think before Harry had his arms around my waist and had pulled me into a kiss. I chuckled against his lips and I kissed him softly but passionately. We pulled away and smiled at each other and turned to Emma who cleared her throat. </p><p>&ldquo;I just need you to sign these papers and you can leave.&rdquo; She smiled. We smiled and we signed the papers. Harry asked her to take a few photos of the two of us and she did so before congratulating us again and we left after saying our thank you.</p><p>We walked out of the City Hall and we headed home. </p><p>&ldquo;We did it, we got married.&rdquo; I smiled up at Harry as we walked to our apartment, that was a few blocks away.</p><p>&ldquo;We did. Are you happy?&rdquo; He asked me. </p><p>&ldquo;The happiest.&rdquo; I grinned as we entered our apartment building. </p><p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; He smiled. </p><p>&ldquo;What about you, are you happy with the wife you chose?&rdquo; I grinned as I stopped at our door and unlocked it.</p><p>&ldquo;The happiest.&rdquo; he grinned back as he bent down and kissed me, sweeping my legs up and picking we up off the ground. He carried me through the door and kicked it shut. </p><p>&ldquo;Welcome home wife.&rdquo; He smiled as he kissed me. He pulled away and smiled wide. </p><p>&ldquo;God I love saying that, Wife, you&rsquo;re my wife, I love you wife.&rdquo; He smiled as he walked into the apartment and towards the bedroom where he placed me gently in the bed. </p><p>&ldquo;I love you too husband.&rdquo; I chuckled as I lent up as kissed him softly as he lay me down on the bed when we&hellip;well you know what we did.</p><p>*Two Weeks Later*</p><p>It had been two whole weeks since Harry and I said &lsquo;I do&rsquo; and last night we landed back in the UK. We hadn&rsquo;t told anybody about the wedding yet, mainly because we hadn&rsquo;t actually seen anybody and because we were just enjoying ourselves before we came home to tell everyone and have our heads chewed off by Gemma and Anne.</p><p>Last night Harry decided to stay at my place but this morning he left early to go see his mum and sister before we tell them and now I was stood outside his sisters house ready to see everyone.</p><p>I took a deep breath and smiled, this is gonna be the first time I&rsquo;d seen my best friend in six months and a lot has changed. I cut my hair and dyed it, from blonde to a dark Brown but that was just after I left so she&rsquo;d seen it on Skype but not in real life, face to face. I got my nose pierced and I got contacts. OH and let&rsquo;s not forget I got married!</p><p>To her brother.</p><p>&ldquo;Honey, I&rsquo;m home!&rdquo; I called as I entered my best friends house. It was quiet so I dropped my bag by the stairs and kicked my shoes off, the blue converse I had gotten married in to be exact. &ldquo;Gemma, you home?&rdquo; I called when I got no reply. &ldquo;Harry!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;In the kitchen!&rdquo; Gemma called back and as I entered I spotted Harry sitting on the counter, a huge smile on his face. Gemma was starring at him, she looked like she was pissed off.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s up Chuck!&rdquo; I said as I walked in and jumped on the counter next to Harry, smiling softly up at Harry as he watched me.</p><p>&ldquo;You will never guess what happened to my doofus brother while he was in the states!&rdquo; Gemma sighed as she turned to me. I looked up at him and shrugged, he shot me a sly wink and a huge grin and I chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he done this time?&rdquo; I asked, knowing full well what he had done, I&rsquo;d done the same.</p><p>&ldquo;He got married!&rdquo; She yelled. \u00a0&quot;Like he actually said 'I do&rsquo; to some stranger.&ldquo; Gemma told me, Harry rolled his eyes and shook his head.</p><p>&quot;She isn&rsquo;t a stranger Gem, in fact I&rsquo;ve known her for years.&rdquo; He told her. I watched as she shrugged.</p><p>&ldquo;And I know for a fact you will love her&hellip;like a sister.&rdquo; Harry smiled as he jumped off the table and walked over to her, wrapping his arms around his sisters shoulder and moved her until she stood in front of me I grinned at her and waved &ldquo;in fact now she is your sister.&rdquo; he gestured to me and I winked at him. </p><p>&ldquo;What are you talking about Harry?&rdquo; she asked, confused. &ldquo;Why are you winking and him, Y/N?&rdquo; she looked at the two of us as if we were crazy and I laughed.</p><p>I stuck out my left hand and Harry grabbed it and smiled, kissing it softly and walking over so he was stood in between my legs. Still holding my hand he turned so his back was leaning on the counter where I was and pulled his arm around his shoulder, he held it with his left and showing MY wedding ring and his to his sister who was watching.</p><p>&ldquo;OH MY GOD&hellip;YOU MARRIED MY BEST FRIEND!!!&rdquo; She yelled once she finally clicked.</p><p> &ldquo;AND YOU, YOU MARRIED MY BROTHER!&rdquo; she yelled pointing at me.</p><p>&ldquo;Surprise?&rdquo; I said but it came out as more of a question. She stood there in shook, quite for a second.</p><p>&ldquo;How the hell did this happen? You go away for six months and you come back married, to my brother?&rdquo; She asked. &ldquo;what the hell?&rdquo; she didn&rsquo;t look angry, mostly surprised.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I ran into his while I was in L.A. and by 'ran into&rsquo; I told him I was in town and we grabbed coffee. I need someone I knew as I missed home too much and I knew Harry was in town so I called him.&rdquo; I told her.</p><p>&ldquo;I asked her out on a few dates as friends and one night we got drinks afterwards and we drunkenly confessed our love we decided we would start dating.&rdquo; Harry continued. &ldquo;That was what your third or fourth month in LA?&rdquo; He asked and I nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;How did that end in marriage?&rdquo; Gemma asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, we were chilling at my place and got to talking, I figured since we&rsquo;ve known each other of over 17 years we already know most of the stuff other couples usually learn when dating so I kinda just skipped over the whole dating part and asked her to marry me. She said yes and the next day we were stood in the City Hall getting married.&rdquo; I told her.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Gem, I know you&rsquo;re probably pissed at us. But I promise we talked this over so much before it happened. It wasn&rsquo;t just a spare of the moment thing, we really thought about this before we did it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you just wait and get married here, with the family?&rdquo; she asked us. now she looked sad.</p><p>&ldquo;Because we were worried that our families would find a way to talk us out of it and we didn&rsquo;t want that to happen.&rdquo; Harry spoke up.</p><p>&ldquo;Why would we do that, I have always wanted you two together, this is amazing news it just sucks that you got married with out us there.&rdquo; She told us. Before we could say another word there was a knock at the door.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get it!&rdquo; Harry called as he grabbed my legs, wrapped them around his waist and ran towards the door with me on his back.</p><p>&ldquo;HARRY WHAT THE HELL!&rdquo; I yelled gripping tight to him as he took off, scaring the crap out of me.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t answer, he just let out a laugh as we reached the door. He opened the door to find Anne stood there, she looked shocked at first, probably at the sight of her daughters best friend on her sons back.</p><p>&ldquo;Mum!&rdquo; Harry grinned. He finally released my legs and I jumped down as he hugged his mum.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, I thought you were coming home next week?&quot;she asked, pulling out of his hug.</p><p>&quot;I decide to come home with Y/N&rdquo; he told me.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you two together now?&rdquo; She asked pointing between the two of us Harry nodded and she let out a happy cry as she grabbed me and pulled me into a hug.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, they&rsquo;re about as together as two people can be.&rdquo; Gemma told her as she walked passed us.</p><p>&ldquo;And how that?&rdquo; Anne asked, confused .</p><p>&ldquo;Mum, don&rsquo;t kill me, and just remember how much you love Y/N before I tell you this.&rdquo; Harry said as he took his mums hands and guided her into the kitchen where Gemma was. I closed the door and followed behind, nervous about how she&rsquo;s going to react.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me what?&rdquo; She said suspecting the worst.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you see Y/N and I we&rsquo;ve know each other for so long and we know everything about her and I&rsquo;ve been in love with her for so long, remember you used to tease me about it when we went round to her house with her dad?&rdquo; He started.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I used to joke that you were both in love with each other and that you were gonna get married and have a baby. Y/N&rsquo;s dad would join in too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, well it&rsquo;s not so much a joke anymore.&rdquo; He smiled. He moved to stand by me again and wrapped his arms around my waist once more.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; She asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry and Y/N got married while in LA.&rdquo; Gemma spilled. Anne&rsquo;s eyes went wide as she looked at me and her son.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo; She said.</p><p>&ldquo;Mum while in LA Y/N and I met up and we started dating and we got to talking and long story short we ended up in the city hall and we got married.&rdquo; Harry explained.</p><p>&ldquo;OH MY GOSH REALLY?&rdquo; She smiled wide. We both nodded and she dove at us, hugging us tight.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m so happy for you two.&rdquo; She gushed.</p><p>&ldquo;Really, you&rsquo;re not upset at us?&rdquo; I asked surprised.</p><p>&ldquo;God no, why would I be unhappy?&rdquo; She asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Because we got married, without you.&rdquo; Harry guessed.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you happy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well yeah, I married this amazing girl and she agreed to marry me.&rdquo; Harry smiled as he looked down at me and held a little tighter.</p><p>&ldquo;Then is doesn&rsquo;t matter to me that I wasn&rsquo;t there as long as you both are happy.&rdquo; she smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks mum.&rdquo; Harry smiled as he hugged her.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks Anne, and I promise anything big happens ever again I will personally tell you first.&rdquo; I grinned.</p><p>&ldquo;You better, I already missed my sons wedding I don&rsquo;t want to be missing any thing else.&rdquo; She grinned.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna hold that against us forever aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Harry asked.</p><p>&ldquo;No, just until my first grandchild is born.&rdquo; She smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Seriously Anne, we only got married two weeks ago.&rdquo; I told her she just shrugged.</p><p>&ldquo;Well firstly, you&rsquo;re part of the family anyway but now you&rsquo;re married to my son, I think it&rsquo;s OK for you to call me mum.&rdquo; She told me.</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever you want mum.&rdquo; I grinned making her laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Mum, are you being serious about the first grandchild thing?&quot;I asked and she nodded.</p><p>&quot;Yes daughter in law, I am very serious.&rdquo; She winked.</p><p>&ldquo;Well then, we best get working on that wife.&rdquo; Harry grinned wide.</p><p>&ldquo;Later Husband, we are visiting your family and they do not need to hear about your plans for baby making.&rdquo; I joked when I saw Gemma wince a little at the mention of sex.</p><p>&ldquo;Seriously, if you&rsquo;re going to be talking to each other like that, you can leave.&rdquo; She sulked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, if we get kicked out we can get on with the baby making.&rdquo; Harry joked as he stood up.</p><p>&ldquo;gross, how about no, you will not defile my friend like this.&rdquo; Gemma cried as she stood up and dived on me.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s my wife&hellip;I&rsquo;ve already defiled her, many many times.&rdquo; Harry told her. Gemma screamed and held her hands over her ears as she stood up and ran out of the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Seriously what have married into?&quot;I asked as Anne laughed.</p><p>&quot;Welcome to the family Wifey.&rdquo; He smiled as he lent over and kissed me softly.</p><p>&ldquo;You two are cute.&rdquo; Anne gushed as Harry and I pulled out of the kiss.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah we are.&rdquo; I smiled over at her. &ldquo;Mum.&rdquo; </p>",

            "comment": "<p>I\u2019ve been here, in LA for five months and two weeks and in the time I had met up with an old friend, started dating that old friend and then gotten engaged to said old friend. </p><p>Before you jump ahead of yourself you should know a few things about him. </p><p>1st: his name is Harry, and he is 24 years old. I am the same age as he his. Only a couple month younger.</p><p>2nd: I met Harry when I was 7 years old and I moved onto the same street as he and his family and I became fast friends with him and his sister.</p><p>3rd: His older sister is my best friend.</p><p>4th: Harry was in a very big boyband and when he went touring around the world we lost our way, I used to have a huge crush on him and when he left I told me he felt the same but then he got to busy to deal with a relationship so we broke up. It was mutual, we just didn\u2019t have time with each other. After that we only spoke when he visited his family and even then we didn\u2019t say much. </p><p>Jump to about seven and a half months ago when I found my boyfriend in bed with my mum, which is not surprising she was always a dick and she was never home. She was always out partying, drinking spending the weekend high of her tits with some junkie who was looking to sleep with her. She shacked up with my boyfriend, in my house, then kicked me out. She then began dating my Ex and I moved in with Gemma until a found a new place.</p><p>Not long after that I got an opportunity to spend six months in the states, LA to be exact, working on my Photography. I packed everything I needed, said goodbye to Anne and Gemma and took off to LA. </p><p>Two weeks in and I was happy to be away from my bitch of a mother and Ex, but I missed my family with Gemma and Anne so I did the only thing I could think of at the time. Call Harry. </p><p>We met up for coffee and then became really good friends again until I began feeling things for him again and I began to distance my self. Harry noticed and wouldn\u2019t let me go until I told him what was going on. I told him and next thing you know we\u2019re dating.</p><p>The last night Harry and I got talking and some how, I don\u2019t remember exactly, he asked me to marry him and I said yes, we decided to just do it, without our family because if we did they would talk us out of it and we didn\u2019t want to be turn apart by people who didn\u2019t quite understand. So here we are, Harry and I, stood out side of the city hall, waiting nervously, for our names to me called.</p><p>I sat there, my hand in his, feeling like I was about to throw up, me knee bouncing up and down and I watched as people walked past. Before we had even woken up properly, Harry and I were out the house and shopping, for everything we would need. I bought a nice white skater dress and a pair of blue converse\u2026because I swore I wasn\u2019t getting married in anything BUT converse. I had on a necklace my dad had bought me when I was 12, before he died and I also had on a bracelet I had borrowed from Gemma a while ago. </p><p>So I had something Old, Something new, something borrowed and something blue. Next stop was a jewellery shop, where we bought a couple silver rings and Harry insisted on buying me an engagement ring that matched.</p><p>We then headed home where we changed and then headed back out, this time to the city hall where Harry had managed to book us and appointment to get married.</p><p>\u201cHey, you OK?\u201d Harry asked, pulling me out of my thoughts. I looked up into his big green eyes and somehow I felt all my nerves wash away. I smiled and nodded, leaning up and kissing his lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about to marry you, I\u2019m so much better than OK.\u201d I told him as I pulled away. </p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re not having second thoughts?\u201d He asked. I saw worry and panic flash behind his eyes and I shook my head. </p><p>\u201cNo, Harry, no second thoughts, no cold feet, nothing but excitement and love for you.\u201d I reassured him. </p><p>\u201cIs this not what you want?\u201d I questioned. He let out a sharp, loud laughed.</p><p>\u201cHa, this is what I\u2019ve wanted since I was 7 years old and you moved into the house down my street.\u201d he informed me.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I asked, feeling a little shocked. He had told me about his crush on me growing up, Like I said before, we dated for a few months after he felt for tour with One Direction.</p><p>\u201cYeah, my mum used to make fun of me for it.\u201d He chuckled. </p><p>\u201cAre we doing the right thing, not waiting for our family I mean?\u201d I asked when I noticed Harry\u2019s smile fade a little at the mention of his mum.</p><p>\u201cWe are, we love each other and that\u2019s all that matters to me.\u201d He told me as he kissed the back of my hand. I was about to answer when our names were called. </p><p>\u201cStyles/Y/L/N\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s us.\u201d I smiled as we stood up. </p><p>We walked towards the woman who called our names and she led us into a big ass room that wall pretty empty. Just a table and a woman stood at the end in a smart black suit and black heeled shoes. </p><p>\u201cHello, my name is Emma Black, I will be marrying you two today. Is there anybody else coming today?\u201d She asked as she reached her. </p><p>\u201cNo, just the two of us.\u201d Harry smiled, tightening his grip on my hand just a little. </p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s get started shall we.\u201d She grinned and opened the book in her hands. </p><p>\u201cToday, we are gathered to celebrate the love you two share for each other and to allow the eyes of the law and god to see the love you to share as you are bound together in matrimony.\u201d She read then looked up at the two of us. \u201cIf it\u2019s OK with you, I would like you to read your vows.\u201d She gestured to Harry.</p><p>\u201cOK, well, as this was a pretty quick decision, I didn\u2019t really right anything, so i\u2019m just gonna tell you why I want this.\u201d He spoke, taking both my hands in his and turning me to face him.</p><p>\u201cI love you, I have done since I was 7 years old. We drifted apart and I think that was what we needed to because when we found each other again, I got to fall in love with you all over again and remember why you made my heart skip a beat every time you smile.\u201d as he spoke my eyes filled with tears and I guess one fell because he wiped it away with his thumb as he continued.</p><p>\u201cThere have been other people in our time apart and I like to think that the reason it didn\u2019t work out with any of them is because we belong together and we were destined to be here. We belong together and when we return home and tell my mum we got married she\u2019ll be happy and cry\u2026and my sister will kill us.\u201d He chuckled making me laugh to.</p><p>\u201cI love you Y/N so much and I am so grateful that you said yes and after today will be spending our lives together. We will have our ups and downs, we\u2019ll fight and make up and I\u2019ll make you angry and upset but I will always remind you, everyday, that I love you and I always will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Y/L/N, your turn.\u201d Emma smiled and I nodded.</p><p>\u201cOK, well, that\u2019s gonna be hard to top.\u201d I chuckled \u201cBut six months ago, I felt my life was over, My boyfriend cheated on my with my mum. My dad was gone and the only people I had to turn to were Gemma and your mum. Then something great happened. I got an offer from my job to spend six months in LA and I took it.

I cut my hair and dyed it, from blonde to a dark Brown but that was just after I left so she\u2019d seen it on Skype but not in real life, face to face. I got my nose pierced and I got contacts. OH and let\u2019s not forget I got married!</p><p>To her brother.</p><p>\u201cHoney, I\u2019m home!\u201d I called as I entered my best friends house. It was quiet so I dropped my bag by the stairs and kicked my shoes off, the blue converse I had gotten married in to be exact. \u201cGemma, you home?\u201d I called when I got no reply. \u201cHarry!\u201d </p><p>\u201cIn the kitchen!\u201d Gemma called back and as I entered I spotted Harry sitting on the counter, a huge smile on his face. Gemma was starring at him, she looked like she was pissed off.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s up Chuck!\u201d I said as I walked in and jumped on the counter next to Harry, smiling softly up at Harry as he watched me.</p><p>\u201cYou will never guess what happened to my doofus brother while he was in the states!\u201d Gemma sighed as she turned to me. I looked up at him and shrugged, he shot me a sly wink and a huge grin and I chuckled.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he done this time?\u201d I asked, knowing full well what he had done, I\u2019d done the same.</p><p>\u201cHe got married!\u201d She yelled. \u00a0\"Like he actually said 'I do\u2019 to some stranger.\u201c Gemma told me, Harry rolled his eyes and shook his head.</p><p>\"She isn\u2019t a stranger Gem, in fact I\u2019ve known her for years.\u201d He told her. I watched as she shrugged.</p><p>\u201cAnd I know for a fact you will love her\u2026like a sister.\u201d Harry smiled as he jumped off the table and walked over to her, wrapping his arms around his sisters shoulder and moved her until she stood in front of me I grinned at her and waved \u201cin fact now she is your sister.\u201d he gestured to me and I winked at him. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about Harry?\u201d she asked, confused. \u201cWhy are you winking and him, Y/N?\u201d she looked at the two of us as if we were crazy and I laughed.</p><p>I stuck out my left hand and Harry grabbed it and smiled, kissing it softly and walking over so he was stood in between my legs. Still holding my hand he turned so his back was leaning on the counter where I was and pulled his arm around his shoulder, he held it with his left and showing MY wedding ring and his to his sister who was watching.</p><p>\u201cOH MY GOD\u2026YOU MARRIED MY BEST FRIEND!!!\u201d She yelled once she finally clicked.</p><p> \u201cAND YOU, YOU MARRIED MY BROTHER!\u201d she yelled pointing at me.</p><p>\u201cSurprise?\u201d I said but it came out as more of a question. She stood there in shook, quite for a second.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell did this happen? You go away for six months and you come back married, to my brother?\u201d She asked. \u201cwhat the hell?\u201d she didn\u2019t look angry, mostly surprised.</p><p>\u201cWell, I ran into his while I was in L.A. and by 'ran into\u2019 I told him I was in town and we grabbed coffee. I need someone I knew as I missed home too much and I knew Harry was in town so I called him.\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cI asked her out on a few dates as friends and one night we got drinks afterwards and we drunkenly confessed our love we decided we would start dating.\u201d Harry continued. \u201cThat was what your third or fourth month in LA?\u201d He asked and I nodded.</p><p>\u201cHow did that end in marriage?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, we were chilling at my place and got to talking, I figured since we\u2019ve known each other of over 17 years we already know most of the stuff other couples usually learn when dating so I kinda just skipped over the whole dating part and asked her to marry me. She said yes and the next day we were stood in the City Hall getting married.\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Gem, I know you\u2019re probably pissed at us. But I promise we talked this over so much before it happened. It wasn\u2019t just a spare of the moment thing, we really thought about this before we did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just wait and get married here, with the family?\u201d she asked us. now she looked sad.</p><p>\u201cBecause we were worried that our families would find a way to talk us out of it and we didn\u2019t want that to happen.\u201d Harry spoke up.</p><p>\u201cWhy would we do that, I have always wanted you two together, this is amazing news it just sucks that you got married with out us there.\u201d She told us. Before we could say another word there was a knock at the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it!\u201d Harry called as he grabbed my legs, wrapped them around his waist and ran towards the door with me on his back.</p><p>\u201cHARRY WHAT THE HELL!\u201d I yelled gripping tight to him as he took off, scaring the crap out of me.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, he just let out a laugh as we reached the door. He opened the door to find Anne stood there, she looked shocked at first, probably at the sight of her daughters best friend on her sons back.</p><p>\u201cMum!\u201d Harry grinned. He finally released my legs and I jumped down as he hugged his mum.</p><p>\u201cHarry, I thought you were coming home next week?\"she asked, pulling out of his hug.</p><p>\"I decide to come home with Y/N\u201d he told me.</p><p>\u201cAre you two together now?\u201d She asked pointing between the two of us Harry nodded and she let out a happy cry as she grabbed me and pulled me into a hug.</p><p>\u201cYeah, they\u2019re about as together as two people can be.\u201d Gemma told her as she walked passed us.</p><p>\u201cAnd how that?\u201d Anne asked, confused .</p><p>\u201cMum, don\u2019t kill me, and just remember how much you love Y/N before I tell you this.\u201d Harry said as he took his mums hands and guided her into the kitchen where Gemma was. I closed the door and followed behind, nervous about how she\u2019s going to react.</p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d She said suspecting the worst.</p><p>\u201cWell, you see Y/N and I we\u2019ve know each other for so long and we know everything about her and I\u2019ve been in love with her for so long, remember you used to tease me about it when we went round to her house with her dad?\u201d He started.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I used to joke that you were both in love with each other and that you were gonna get married and have a baby. Y/N\u2019s dad would join in too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well it\u2019s not so much a joke anymore.\u201d He smiled. He moved to stand by me again and wrapped his arms around my waist once more.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d She asked.</p><p>\u201cHarry and Y/N got married while in LA.\u201d Gemma spilled. Anne\u2019s eyes went wide as she looked at me and her son.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d She said.</p><p>\u201cMum while in LA Y/N and I met up and we started dating and we got to talking and long story short we ended up in the city hall and we got married.\u201d Harry explained.</p><p>\u201cOH MY GOSH REALLY?\u201d She smiled wide. We both nodded and she dove at us, hugging us tight.</p><p>\u201cOh I\u2019m so happy for you two.\u201d She gushed.</p><p>\u201cReally, you\u2019re not upset at us?\u201d I asked surprised.</p><p>\u201cGod no, why would I be unhappy?\u201d She asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause we got married, without you.\u201d Harry guessed.</p><p>\u201cAre you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell yeah, I married this amazing girl and she agreed to marry me.\u201d Harry smiled as he looked down at me and held a little tighter.</p><p>\u201cThen is doesn\u2019t matter to me that I wasn\u2019t there as long as you both are happy.\u201d she smiled.</p><p>\u201cThanks mum.\u201d Harry smiled as he hugged her.</p><p>\u201cThanks Anne, and I promise anything big happens ever again I will personally tell you first.\u201d I grinned.</p><p>\u201cYou better, I already missed my sons wedding I don\u2019t want to be missing any thing else.\u201d She grinned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna hold that against us forever aren\u2019t you?\u201d Harry asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, just until my first grandchild is born.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cSeriously Anne, we only got married two weeks ago.\u201d I told her she just shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWell firstly, you\u2019re part of the family anyway but now you\u2019re married to my son, I think it\u2019s OK for you to call me mum.\u201d She told me.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want mum.\u201d I grinned making her laugh.</p><p>\u201cMum, are you being serious about the first grandchild thing?\"I asked and she nodded.</p><p>\"Yes daughter in law, I am very serious.\u201d She winked.</p><p>\u201cWell then, we best get working on that wife.\u201d Harry grinned wide.</p><p>\u201cLater Husband, we are visiting your family and they do not need to hear about your plans for baby making.\u201d I joked when I saw Gemma wince a little at the mention of sex.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, if you\u2019re going to be talking to each other like that, you can leave.\u201d She sulked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, if we get kicked out we can get on with the baby making.\u201d Harry joked as he stood up.</p><p>\u201cgross, how about no, you will not defile my friend like this.\u201d Gemma cried as she stood up and dived on me.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my wife\u2026I\u2019ve already defiled her, many many times.\u201d Harry told her. Gemma screamed and held her hands over her ears as she stood up and ran out of the room.</p><p>\u201cSeriously what have married into?\"I asked as Anne laughed.</p><p>\"Welcome to the family Wifey.\u201d He smiled as he lent over and kissed me softly.</p><p>\u201cYou two are cute.\u201d Anne gushed as Harry and I pulled out of the kiss.</p><p>\u201cYeah we are.\u201d I smiled over at her. \u201cMum.\u201d </p>",

                "content_raw": "<p>I\u2019ve been here, in LA for five months and two weeks and in the time I had met up with an old friend, started dating that old friend and then gotten engaged to said old friend. </p><p>Before you jump ahead of yourself you should know a few things about him. </p><p>1st: his name is Harry, and he is 24 years old. I am the same age as he his. Only a couple month younger.</p><p>2nd: I met Harry when I was 7 years old and I moved onto the same street as he and his family and I became fast friends with him and his sister.</p><p>3rd: His older sister is my best friend.</p><p>4th: Harry was in a very big boyband and when he went touring around the world we lost our way, I used to have a huge crush on him and when he left I told me he felt the same but then he got to busy to deal with a relationship so we broke up. It was mutual, we just didn\u2019t have time with each other. After that we only spoke when he visited his family and even then we didn\u2019t say much. </p><p>Jump to about seven and a half months ago when I found my boyfriend in bed with my mum, which is not surprising she was always a dick and she was never home. She was always out partying, drinking spending the weekend high of her tits with some junkie who was looking to sleep with her. She shacked up with my boyfriend, in my house, then kicked me out. She then began dating my Ex and I moved in with Gemma until a found a new place.</p><p>Not long after that I got an opportunity to spend six months in the states, LA to be exact, working on my Photography. I packed everything I needed, said goodbye to Anne and Gemma and took off to LA. </p><p>Two weeks in and I was happy to be away from my bitch of a mother and Ex, but I missed my family with Gemma and Anne so I did the only thing I could think of at the time. Call Harry. </p><p>We met up for coffee and then became really good friends again until I began feeling things for him again and I began to distance my self. Harry noticed and wouldn\u2019t let me go until I told him what was going on. I told him and next thing you know we\u2019re dating.</p><p>The last night Harry and I got talking and some how, I don\u2019t remember exactly, he asked me to marry him and I said yes, we decided to just do it, without our family because if we did they would talk us out of it and we didn\u2019t want to be turn apart by people who didn\u2019t quite understand. So here we are, Harry and I, stood out side of the city hall, waiting nervously, for our names to me called.</p><p>I sat there, my hand in his, feeling like I was about to throw up, me knee bouncing up and down and I watched as people walked past. Before we had even woken up properly, Harry and I were out the house and shopping, for everything we would need. I bought a nice white skater dress and a pair of blue converse\u2026because I swore I wasn\u2019t getting married in anything BUT converse. I had on a necklace my dad had bought me when I was 12, before he died and I also had on a bracelet I had borrowed from Gemma a while ago. </p><p>So I had something Old, Something new, something borrowed and something blue. Next stop was a jewellery shop, where we bought a couple silver rings and Harry insisted on buying me an engagement ring that matched.</p><p>We then headed home where we changed and then headed back out, this time to the city hall where Harry had managed to book us and appointment to get married.</p><p>\u201cHey, you OK?\u201d Harry asked, pulling me out of my thoughts. I looked up into his big green eyes and somehow I felt all my nerves wash away. I smiled and nodded, leaning up and kissing his lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about to marry you, I\u2019m so much better than OK.\u201d I told him as I pulled away. </p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re not having second thoughts?\u201d He asked. I saw worry and panic flash behind his eyes and I shook my head. </p><p>\u201cNo, Harry, no second thoughts, no cold feet, nothing but excitement and love for you.\u201d I reassured him. </p><p>\u201cIs this not what you want?\u201d I questioned. He let out a sharp, loud laughed.</p><p>\u201cHa, this is what I\u2019ve wanted since I was 7 years old and you moved into the house down my street.\u201d he informed me.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I asked, feeling a little shocked. He had told me about his crush on me growing up, Like I said before, we dated for a few months after he felt for tour with One Direction.</p><p>\u201cYeah, my mum used to make fun of me for it.\u201d He chuckled. </p><p>\u201cAre we doing the right thing, not waiting for our family I mean?\u201d I asked when I noticed Harry\u2019s smile fade a little at the mention of his mum.</p><p>\u201cWe are, we love each other and that\u2019s all that matters to me.\u201d He told me as he kissed the back of my hand. I was about to answer when our names were called. </p><p>\u201cStyles/Y/L/N\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s us.\u201d I smiled as we stood up. </p><p>We walked towards the woman who called our names and she led us into a big ass room that wall pretty empty. Just a table and a woman stood at the end in a smart black suit and black heeled shoes. </p><p>\u201cHello, my name is Emma Black, I will be marrying you two today. Is there anybody else coming today?\u201d She asked as she reached her. </p><p>\u201cNo, just the two of us.\u201d Harry smiled, tightening his grip on my hand just a little. </p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s get started shall we.\u201d She grinned and opened the book in her hands. </p><p>\u201cToday, we are gathered to celebrate the love you two share for each other and to allow the eyes of the law and god to see the love you to share as you are bound together in matrimony.\u201d She read then looked up at the two of us. \u201cIf it\u2019s OK with you, I would like you to read your vows.\u201d She gestured to Harry.</p><p>\u201cOK, well, as this was a pretty quick decision, I didn\u2019t really right anything, so i\u2019m just gonna tell you why I want this.\u201d He spoke, taking both my hands in his and turning me to face him.</p><p>\u201cI love you, I have done since I was 7 years old. We drifted apart and I think that was what we needed to because when we found each other again, I got to fall in love with you all over again and remember why you made my heart skip a beat every time you smile.\u201d as he spoke my eyes filled with tears and I guess one fell because he wiped it away with his thumb as he continued.</p><p>\u201cThere have been other people in our time apart and I like to think that the reason it didn\u2019t work out with any of them is because we belong together and we were destined to be here. We belong together and when we return home and tell my mum we got married she\u2019ll be happy and cry\u2026and my sister will kill us.\u201d He chuckled making me laugh to.</p><p>\u201cI love you Y/N so much and I am so grateful that you said yes and after today will be spending our lives together. We will have our ups and downs, we\u2019ll fight and make up and I\u2019ll make you angry and upset but I will always remind you, everyday, that I love you and I always will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Y/L/N, your turn.\u201d Emma smiled and I nodded.</p><p>\u201cOK, well, that\u2019s gonna be hard to top.\u201d I chuckled \u201cBut six months ago, I felt my life was over, My boyfriend cheated on my with my mum. My dad was gone and the only people I had to turn to were Gemma and your mum. Then something great happened. I got an offer from my job to spend six months in LA and I took it. I packed my bags, said bye to Gemma and your mum and I took off. I felt lost after I got here, I didn\u2019t know anybody and I hated that I had nobody close by to talk to. Then I remember you. My childhood best friend. The boy who moved away to become a big star.</p><p>\"When I called you six months ago I just needed a piece of home. Somebody I knew to talk to and for my life to start looking up. But I got so much more. I got my best friend back, I fell in love and now I have a husband who I will love and cherish forever. </p><p>\"We have a hell of a journey ahead of us and I can\u2019t wait to share it with you. I love you Harry with all my heart and if when we get back to England and Gemma really does kill us, I\u2019ll die happy knowing I got to spend these last six months with you and my last days married to you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOK, Guys, that was beautiful. shall we continue?\u201d She asked and we both nodded. </p><p>\u201cOk, Harry do you take Y/N to be your lawful wedded wife? Do you promise to love her when times are tough? Do you promise to keep her safe from harm and make her happy any way you can? Do you swear to always be there for her when she needs you and be honest and truthful for as long as you both shall live?\u201d Emma asked. </p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Harry grinned as he slipped a ring onto my finger. Another tear fell from my eyes and he wiped them away as Emma began again.</p><p>\u201cAnd Y/N do you take Harry to be your lawful wedded Husband? Do you promise to love him when times are tough? Do you promise to keep him safe from harm and make him happy any way you can? Do you swear to always be there for him when he needs you and be honest and truthful for as long as you both shall live? \u00a0</p><p>\"I do.\u201d I whispered as I slipped the ring on his finger. </p><p>\u201cWell then, by the power vested in me, by the State of California and the United States of America, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Congratulations you my now kiss your spouse.\u201d She smiled taking a step back.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even have time to think before Harry had his arms around my waist and had pulled me into a kiss. I chuckled against his lips and I kissed him softly but passionately. We pulled away and smiled at each other and turned to Emma who cleared her throat. </p><p>\u201cI just need you to sign these papers and you can leave.\u201d She smiled. We smiled and we signed the papers. Harry asked her to take a few photos of the two of us and she did so before congratulating us again and we left after saying our thank you.</p><p>We walked out of the City Hall and we headed home. </p><p>\u201cWe did it, we got married.\u201d I smiled up at Harry as we walked to our apartment, that was a few blocks away.</p><p>\u201cWe did. Are you happy?\u201d He asked me. </p><p>\u201cThe happiest.\u201d I grinned as we entered our apartment building. </p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He smiled. </p><p>\u201cWhat about you, are you happy with the wife you chose?\u201d I grinned as I stopped at our door and unlocked it.</p><p>\u201cThe happiest.\u201d he grinned back as he bent down and kissed me, sweeping my legs up and picking we up off the ground. He carried me through the door and kicked it shut. </p><p>\u201cWelcome home wife.\u201d He smiled as he kissed me. He pulled away and smiled wide. </p><p>\u201cGod I love saying that, Wife, you\u2019re my wife, I love you wife.\u201d He smiled as he walked into the apartment and towards the bedroom where he placed me gently in the bed. </p><p>\u201cI love you too husband.\u201d I chuckled as I lent up as kissed him softly as he lay me down on the bed when we\u2026well you know what we did.</p><p>*Two Weeks Later*</p><p>It had been two whole weeks since Harry and I said \u2018I do\u2019 and last night we landed back in the UK. We hadn\u2019t told anybody about the wedding yet, mainly because we hadn\u2019t actually seen anybody and because we were just enjoying ourselves before we came home to tell everyone and have our heads chewed off by Gemma and Anne.</p><p>Last night Harry decided to stay at my place but this morning he left early to go see his mum and sister before we tell them and now I was stood outside his sisters house ready to see everyone.</p><p>I took a deep breath and smiled, this is gonna be the first time I\u2019d seen my best friend in six months and a lot has changed. I cut my hair and dyed it, from blonde to a dark Brown but that was just after I left so she\u2019d seen it on Skype but not in real life, face to face. I got my nose pierced and I got contacts. OH and let\u2019s not forget I got married!</p><p>To her brother.</p><p>\u201cHoney, I\u2019m home!\u201d I called as I entered my best friends house. It was quiet so I dropped my bag by the stairs and kicked my shoes off, the blue converse I had gotten married in to be exact. \u201cGemma, you home?\u201d I called when I got no reply. \u201cHarry!\u201d </p><p>\u201cIn the kitchen!\u201d Gemma called back and as I entered I spotted Harry sitting on the counter, a huge smile on his face. Gemma was starring at him, she looked like she was pissed off.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s up Chuck!\u201d I said as I walked in and jumped on the counter next to Harry, smiling softly up at Harry as he watched me.</p><p>\u201cYou will never guess what happened to my doofus brother while he was in the states!\u201d Gemma sighed as she turned to me. I looked up at him and shrugged, he shot me a sly wink and a huge grin and I chuckled.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he done this time?\u201d I asked, knowing full well what he had done, I\u2019d done the same.</p><p>\u201cHe got married!\u201d She yelled. \u00a0\"Like he actually said 'I do\u2019 to some stranger.\u201c Gemma told me, Harry rolled his eyes and shook his head.</p><p>\"She isn\u2019t a stranger Gem, in fact I\u2019ve known her for years.\u201d He told her. I watched as she shrugged.</p><p>\u201cAnd I know for a fact you will love her\u2026like a sister.\u201d Harry smiled as he jumped off the table and walked over to her, wrapping his arms around his sisters shoulder and moved her until she stood in front of me I grinned at her and waved \u201cin fact now she is your sister.\u201d he gestured to me and I winked at him. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about Harry?\u201d she asked, confused. \u201cWhy are you winking and him, Y/N?\u201d she looked at the two of us as if we were crazy and I laughed.</p><p>I stuck out my left hand and Harry grabbed it and smiled, kissing it softly and walking over so he was stood in between my legs. Still holding my hand he turned so his back was leaning on the counter where I was and pulled his arm around his shoulder, he held it with his left and showing MY wedding ring and his to his sister who was watching.</p><p>\u201cOH MY GOD\u2026YOU MARRIED MY BEST FRIEND!!!\u201d She yelled once she finally clicked.</p><p> \u201cAND YOU, YOU MARRIED MY BROTHER!\u201d she yelled pointing at me.</p><p>\u201cSurprise?\u201d I said but it came out as more of a question. She stood there in shook, quite for a second.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell did this happen? You go away for six months and you come back married, to my brother?\u201d She asked. \u201cwhat the hell?\u201d she didn\u2019t look angry, mostly surprised.</p><p>\u201cWell, I ran into his while I was in L.A. and by 'ran into\u2019 I told him I was in town and we grabbed coffee. I need someone I knew as I missed home too much and I knew Harry was in town so I called him.\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cI asked her out on a few dates as friends and one night we got drinks afterwards and we drunkenly confessed our love we decided we would start dating.\u201d Harry continued. \u201cThat was what your third or fourth month in LA?\u201d He asked and I nodded.</p><p>\u201cHow did that end in marriage?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, we were chilling at my place and got to talking, I figured since we\u2019ve known each other of over 17 years we already know most of the stuff other couples usually learn when dating so I kinda just skipped over the whole dating part and asked her to marry me. She said yes and the next day we were stood in the City Hall getting married.\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Gem, I know you\u2019re probably pissed at us. But I promise we talked this over so much before it happened. It wasn\u2019t just a spare of the moment thing, we really thought about this before we did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just wait and get married here, with the family?\u201d she asked us. now she looked sad.</p><p>\u201cBecause we were worried that our families would find a way to talk us out of it and we didn\u2019t want that to happen.\u201d Harry spoke up.</p><p>\u201cWhy would we do that, I have always wanted you two together, this is amazing news it just sucks that you got married with out us there.\u201d She told us. Before we could say another word there was a knock at the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it!\u201d Harry called as he grabbed my legs, wrapped them around his waist and ran towards the door with me on his back.</p><p>\u201cHARRY WHAT THE HELL!\u201d I yelled gripping tight to him as he took off, scaring the crap out of me.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, he just let out a laugh as we reached the door. He opened the door to find Anne stood there, she looked shocked at first, probably at the sight of her daughters best friend on her sons back.</p><p>\u201cMum!\u201d Harry grinned. He finally released my legs and I jumped down as he hugged his mum.</p><p>\u201cHarry, I thought you were coming home next week?\"she asked, pulling out of his hug.</p><p>\"I decide to come home with Y/N\u201d he told me.</p><p>\u201cAre you two together now?\u201d She asked pointing between the two of us Harry nodded and she let out a happy cry as she grabbed me and pulled me into a hug.</p><p>\u201cYeah, they\u2019re about as together as two people can be.\u201d Gemma told her as she walked passed us.</p><p>\u201cAnd how that?\u201d Anne asked, confused .</p><p>\u201cMum, don\u2019t kill me, and just remember how much you love Y/N before I tell you this.\u201d Harry said as he took his mums hands and guided her into the kitchen where Gemma was. I closed the door and followed behind, nervous about how she\u2019s going to react.</p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d She said suspecting the worst.</p><p>\u201cWell, you see Y/N and I we\u2019ve know each other for so long and we know everything about her and I\u2019ve been in love with her for so long, remember you used to tease me about it when we went round to her house with her dad?\u201d He started.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I used to joke that you were both in love with each other and that you were gonna get married and have a baby. Y/N\u2019s dad would join in too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well it\u2019s not so much a joke anymore.\u201d He smiled. He moved to stand by me again and wrapped his arms around my waist once more.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d She asked.</p><p>\u201cHarry and Y/N got married while in LA.\u201d Gemma spilled. Anne\u2019s eyes went wide as she looked at me and her son.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d She said.</p><p>\u201cMum while in LA Y/N and I met up and we started dating and we got to talking and long story short we ended up in the city hall and we got married.\u201d Harry explained.</p><p>\u201cOH MY GOSH REALLY?\u201d She smiled wide. We both nodded and she dove at us, hugging us tight.</p><p>\u201cOh I\u2019m so happy for you two.\u201d She gushed.</p><p>\u201cReally, you\u2019re not upset at us?\u201d I asked surprised.</p><p>\u201cGod no, why would I be unhappy?\u201d She asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause we got married, without you.\u201d Harry guessed.</p><p>\u201cAre you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell yeah, I married this amazing girl and she agreed to marry me.\u201d Harry smiled as he looked down at me and held a little tighter.</p><p>\u201cThen is doesn\u2019t matter to me that I wasn\u2019t there as long as you both are happy.\u201d she smiled.</p><p>\u201cThanks mum.\u201d Harry smiled as he hugged her.</p><p>\u201cThanks Anne, and I promise anything big happens ever again I will personally tell you first.\u201d I grinned.</p><p>\u201cYou better, I already missed my sons wedding I don\u2019t want to be missing any thing else.\u201d She grinned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna hold that against us forever aren\u2019t you?\u201d Harry asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, just until my first grandchild is born.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cSeriously Anne, we only got married two weeks ago.\u201d I told her she just shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWell firstly, you\u2019re part of the family anyway but now you\u2019re married to my son, I think it\u2019s OK for you to call me mum.\u201d She told me.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want mum.\u201d I grinned making her laugh.</p><p>\u201cMum, are you being serious about the first grandchild thing?\"I asked and she nodded.</p><p>\"Yes daughter in law, I am very serious.\u201d She winked.</p><p>\u201cWell then, we best get working on that wife.\u201d Harry grinned wide.</p><p>\u201cLater Husband, we are visiting your family and they do not need to hear about your plans for baby making.\u201d I joked when I saw Gemma wince a little at the mention of sex.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, if you\u2019re going to be talking to each other like that, you can leave.\u201d She sulked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, if we get kicked out we can get on with the baby making.\u201d Harry joked as he stood up.</p><p>\u201cgross, how about no, you will not defile my friend like this.\u201d Gemma cried as she stood up and dived on me.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my wife\u2026I\u2019ve already defiled her, many many times.\u201d Harry told her.

                "content": "<p>I&rsquo;ve been here, in LA for five months and two weeks and in the time I had met up with an old friend, started dating that old friend and then gotten engaged to said old friend. </p><p>Before you jump ahead of yourself you should know a few things about him. </p><p>1st: his name is Harry, and he is 24 years old. I am the same age as he his. Only a couple month younger.</p><p>2nd: I met Harry when I was 7 years old and I moved onto the same street as he and his family and I became fast friends with him and his sister.</p><p>3rd: His older sister is my best friend.</p><p>4th: Harry was in a very big boyband and when he went touring around the world we lost our way, I used to have a huge crush on him and when he left I told me he felt the same but then he got to busy to deal with a relationship so we broke up. It was mutual, we just didn&rsquo;t have time with each other. After that we only spoke when he visited his family and even then we didn&rsquo;t say much. </p><p>Jump to about seven and a half months ago when I found my boyfriend in bed with my mum, which is not surprising she was always a dick and she was never home. She was always out partying, drinking spending the weekend high of her tits with some junkie who was looking to sleep with her. She shacked up with my boyfriend, in my house, then kicked me out. She then began dating my Ex and I moved in with Gemma until a found a new place.</p><p>Not long after that I got an opportunity to spend six months in the states, LA to be exact, working on my Photography. I packed everything I needed, said goodbye to Anne and Gemma and took off to LA. </p><p>Two weeks in and I was happy to be away from my bitch of a mother and Ex, but I missed my family with Gemma and Anne so I did the only thing I could think of at the time. Call Harry. </p><p>We met up for coffee and then became really good friends again until I began feeling things for him again and I began to distance my self. Harry noticed and wouldn&rsquo;t let me go until I told him what was going on. I told him and next thing you know we&rsquo;re dating.</p><p>The last night Harry and I got talking and some how, I don&rsquo;t remember exactly, he asked me to marry him and I said yes, we decided to just do it, without our family because if we did they would talk us out of it and we didn&rsquo;t want to be turn apart by people who didn&rsquo;t quite understand. So here we are, Harry and I, stood out side of the city hall, waiting nervously, for our names to me called.</p><p>I sat there, my hand in his, feeling like I was about to throw up, me knee bouncing up and down and I watched as people walked past. Before we had even woken up properly, Harry and I were out the house and shopping, for everything we would need. I bought a nice white skater dress and a pair of blue converse&hellip;because I swore I wasn&rsquo;t getting married in anything BUT converse. I had on a necklace my dad had bought me when I was 12, before he died and I also had on a bracelet I had borrowed from Gemma a while ago. </p><p>So I had something Old, Something new, something borrowed and something blue. Next stop was a jewellery shop, where we bought a couple silver rings and Harry insisted on buying me an engagement ring that matched.</p><p>We then headed home where we changed and then headed back out, this time to the city hall where Harry had managed to book us and appointment to get married.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, you OK?&rdquo; Harry asked, pulling me out of my thoughts. I looked up into his big green eyes and somehow I felt all my nerves wash away. I smiled and nodded, leaning up and kissing his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m about to marry you, I&rsquo;m so much better than OK.&rdquo; I told him as I pulled away. </p><p>&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re not having second thoughts?&rdquo; He asked. I saw worry and panic flash behind his eyes and I shook my head. </p><p>&ldquo;No, Harry, no second thoughts, no cold feet, nothing but excitement and love for you.&rdquo; I reassured him. </p><p>&ldquo;Is this not what you want?&rdquo; I questioned. He let out a sharp, loud laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;Ha, this is what I&rsquo;ve wanted since I was 7 years old and you moved into the house down my street.&rdquo; he informed me.</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; I asked, feeling a little shocked. He had told me about his crush on me growing up, Like I said before, we dated for a few months after he felt for tour with One Direction.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, my mum used to make fun of me for it.&rdquo; He chuckled. </p><p>&ldquo;Are we doing the right thing, not waiting for our family I mean?&rdquo; I asked when I noticed Harry&rsquo;s smile fade a little at the mention of his mum.</p><p>&ldquo;We are, we love each other and that&rsquo;s all that matters to me.&rdquo; He told me as he kissed the back of my hand. I was about to answer when our names were called. </p><p>&ldquo;Styles/Y/L/N&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s us.&rdquo; I smiled as we stood up. </p><p>We walked towards the woman who called our names and she led us into a big ass room that wall pretty empty. Just a table and a woman stood at the end in a smart black suit and black heeled shoes. </p><p>&ldquo;Hello, my name is Emma Black, I will be marrying you two today. Is there anybody else coming today?&rdquo; She asked as she reached her. </p><p>&ldquo;No, just the two of us.&rdquo; Harry smiled, tightening his grip on my hand just a little. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s get started shall we.&rdquo; She grinned and opened the book in her hands. </p><p>&ldquo;Today, we are gathered to celebrate the love you two share for each other and to allow the eyes of the law and god to see the love you to share as you are bound together in matrimony.&rdquo; She read then looked up at the two of us. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s OK with you, I would like you to read your vows.&rdquo; She gestured to Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;OK, well, as this was a pretty quick decision, I didn&rsquo;t really right anything, so i&rsquo;m just gonna tell you why I want this.&rdquo; He spoke, taking both my hands in his and turning me to face him.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, I have done since I was 7 years old. We drifted apart and I think that was what we needed to because when we found each other again, I got to fall in love with you all over again and remember why you made my heart skip a beat every time you smile.&rdquo; as he spoke my eyes filled with tears and I guess one fell because he wiped it away with his thumb as he continued.</p><p>&ldquo;There have been other people in our time apart and I like to think that the reason it didn&rsquo;t work out with any of them is because we belong together and we were destined to be here. We belong together and when we return home and tell my mum we got married she&rsquo;ll be happy and cry&hellip;and my sister will kill us.&rdquo; He chuckled making me laugh to.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you Y/N so much and I am so grateful that you said yes and after today will be spending our lives together. We will have our ups and downs, we&rsquo;ll fight and make up and I&rsquo;ll make you angry and upset but I will always remind you, everyday, that I love you and I always will.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Y/L/N, your turn.&rdquo; Emma smiled and I nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;OK, well, that&rsquo;s gonna be hard to top.&rdquo; I chuckled &ldquo;But six months ago, I felt my life was over, My boyfriend cheated on my with my mum. My dad was gone and the only people I had to turn to were Gemma and your mum. Then something great happened. I got an offer from my job to spend six months in LA and I took it. I packed my bags, said bye to Gemma and your mum and I took off. I felt lost after I got here, I didn&rsquo;t know anybody and I hated that I had nobody close by to talk to. Then I remember you. My childhood best friend. The boy who moved away to become a big star.</p><p>\"When I called you six months ago I just needed a piece of home. Somebody I knew to talk to and for my life to start looking up. But I got so much more. I got my best friend back, I fell in love and now I have a husband who I will love and cherish forever. </p><p>\"We have a hell of a journey ahead of us and I can&rsquo;t wait to share it with you. I love you Harry with all my heart and if when we get back to England and Gemma really does kill us, I&rsquo;ll die happy knowing I got to spend these last six months with you and my last days married to you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;OK, Guys, that was beautiful. shall we continue?&rdquo; She asked and we both nodded. </p><p>&ldquo;Ok, Harry do you take Y/N to be your lawful wedded wife? Do you promise to love her when times are tough? Do you promise to keep her safe from harm and make her happy any way you can? Do you swear to always be there for her when she needs you and be honest and truthful for as long as you both shall live?&rdquo; Emma asked. </p><p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo; Harry grinned as he slipped a ring onto my finger. Another tear fell from my eyes and he wiped them away as Emma began again.</p><p>&ldquo;And Y/N do you take Harry to be your lawful wedded Husband? Do you promise to love him when times are tough? Do you promise to keep him safe from harm and make him happy any way you can? Do you swear to always be there for him when he needs you and be honest and truthful for as long as you both shall live? &nbsp;</p><p>\"I do.&rdquo; I whispered as I slipped the ring on his finger. </p><p>&ldquo;Well then, by the power vested in me, by the State of California and the United States of America, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Congratulations you my now kiss your spouse.&rdquo; She smiled taking a step back.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t even have time to think before Harry had his arms around my waist and had pulled me into a kiss. I chuckled against his lips and I kissed him softly but passionately. We pulled away and smiled at each other and turned to Emma who cleared her throat. </p><p>&ldquo;I just need you to sign these papers and you can leave.&rdquo; She smiled. We smiled and we signed the papers. Harry asked her to take a few photos of the two of us and she did so before congratulating us again and we left after saying our thank you.</p><p>We walked out of the City Hall and we headed home. </p><p>&ldquo;We did it, we got married.&rdquo; I smiled up at Harry as we walked to our apartment, that was a few blocks away.</p><p>&ldquo;We did. Are you happy?&rdquo; He asked me. </p><p>&ldquo;The happiest.&rdquo; I grinned as we entered our apartment building. </p><p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; He smiled. </p><p>&ldquo;What about you, are you happy with the wife you chose?&rdquo; I grinned as I stopped at our door and unlocked it.</p><p>&ldquo;The happiest.&rdquo; he grinned back as he bent down and kissed me, sweeping my legs up and picking we up off the ground. He carried me through the door and kicked it shut. </p><p>&ldquo;Welcome home wife.&rdquo; He smiled as he kissed me. He pulled away and smiled wide. </p><p>&ldquo;God I love saying that, Wife, you&rsquo;re my wife, I love you wife.&rdquo; He smiled as he walked into the apartment and towards the bedroom where he placed me gently in the bed. </p><p>&ldquo;I love you too husband.&rdquo; I chuckled as I lent up as kissed him softly as he lay me down on the bed when we&hellip;well you know what we did.</p><p>*Two Weeks Later*</p><p>It had been two whole weeks since Harry and I said &lsquo;I do&rsquo; and last night we landed back in the UK. We hadn&rsquo;t told anybody about the wedding yet, mainly because we hadn&rsquo;t actually seen anybody and because we were just enjoying ourselves before we came home to tell everyone and have our heads chewed off by Gemma and Anne.</p><p>Last night Harry decided to stay at my place but this morning he left early to go see his mum and sister before we tell them and now I was stood outside his sisters house ready to see everyone.</p><p>I took a deep breath and smiled, this is gonna be the first time I&rsquo;d seen my best friend in six months and a lot has changed. I cut my hair and dyed it, from blonde to a dark Brown but that was just after I left so she&rsquo;d seen it on Skype but not in real life, face to face. I got my nose pierced and I got contacts. OH and let&rsquo;s not forget I got married!</p><p>To her brother.</p><p>&ldquo;Honey, I&rsquo;m home!&rdquo; I called as I entered my best friends house. It was quiet so I dropped my bag by the stairs and kicked my shoes off, the blue converse I had gotten married in to be exact. &ldquo;Gemma, you home?&rdquo; I called when I got no reply. &ldquo;Harry!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;In the kitchen!&rdquo; Gemma called back and as I entered I spotted Harry sitting on the counter, a huge smile on his face. Gemma was starring at him, she looked like she was pissed off.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s up Chuck!&rdquo; I said as I walked in and jumped on the counter next to Harry, smiling softly up at Harry as he watched me.</p><p>&ldquo;You will never guess what happened to my doofus brother while he was in the states!&rdquo; Gemma sighed as she turned to me. I looked up at him and shrugged, he shot me a sly wink and a huge grin and I chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he done this time?&rdquo; I asked, knowing full well what he had done, I&rsquo;d done the same.</p><p>&ldquo;He got married!&rdquo; She yelled. &nbsp;\"Like he actually said 'I do&rsquo; to some stranger.&ldquo; Gemma told me, Harry rolled his eyes and shook his head.</p><p>\"She isn&rsquo;t a stranger Gem, in fact I&rsquo;ve known her for years.&rdquo; He told her.

It wasn&rsquo;t just a spare of the moment thing, we really thought about this before we did it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you just wait and get married here, with the family?&rdquo; she asked us. now she looked sad.</p><p>&ldquo;Because we were worried that our families would find a way to talk us out of it and we didn&rsquo;t want that to happen.&rdquo; Harry spoke up.</p><p>&ldquo;Why would we do that, I have always wanted you two together, this is amazing news it just sucks that you got married with out us there.&rdquo; She told us. Before we could say another word there was a knock at the door.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get it!&rdquo; Harry called as he grabbed my legs, wrapped them around his waist and ran towards the door with me on his back.</p><p>&ldquo;HARRY WHAT THE HELL!&rdquo; I yelled gripping tight to him as he took off, scaring the crap out of me.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t answer, he just let out a laugh as we reached the door. He opened the door to find Anne stood there, she looked shocked at first, probably at the sight of her daughters best friend on her sons back.</p><p>&ldquo;Mum!&rdquo; Harry grinned. He finally released my legs and I jumped down as he hugged his mum.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, I thought you were coming home next week?\"she asked, pulling out of his hug.</p><p>\"I decide to come home with Y/N&rdquo; he told me.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you two together now?&rdquo; She asked pointing between the two of us Harry nodded and she let out a happy cry as she grabbed me and pulled me into a hug.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, they&rsquo;re about as together as two people can be.&rdquo; Gemma told her as she walked passed us.</p><p>&ldquo;And how that?&rdquo; Anne asked, confused .</p><p>&ldquo;Mum, don&rsquo;t kill me, and just remember how much you love Y/N before I tell you this.&rdquo; Harry said as he took his mums hands and guided her into the kitchen where Gemma was. I closed the door and followed behind, nervous about how she&rsquo;s going to react.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me what?&rdquo; She said suspecting the worst.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you see Y/N and I we&rsquo;ve know each other for so long and we know everything about her and I&rsquo;ve been in love with her for so long, remember you used to tease me about it when we went round to her house with her dad?&rdquo; He started.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I used to joke that you were both in love with each other and that you were gonna get married and have a baby. Y/N&rsquo;s dad would join in too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, well it&rsquo;s not so much a joke anymore.&rdquo; He smiled. He moved to stand by me again and wrapped his arms around my waist once more.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; She asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry and Y/N got married while in LA.&rdquo; Gemma spilled. Anne&rsquo;s eyes went wide as she looked at me and her son.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo; She said.</p><p>&ldquo;Mum while in LA Y/N and I met up and we started dating and we got to talking and long story short we ended up in the city hall and we got married.&rdquo; Harry explained.</p><p>&ldquo;OH MY GOSH REALLY?&rdquo; She smiled wide. We both nodded and she dove at us, hugging us tight.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m so happy for you two.&rdquo; She gushed.</p><p>&ldquo;Really, you&rsquo;re not upset at us?&rdquo; I asked surprised.</p><p>&ldquo;God no, why would I be unhappy?&rdquo; She asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Because we got married, without you.&rdquo; Harry guessed.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you happy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well yeah, I married this amazing girl and she agreed to marry me.&rdquo; Harry smiled as he looked down at me and held a little tighter.</p><p>&ldquo;Then is doesn&rsquo;t matter to me that I wasn&rsquo;t there as long as you both are happy.&rdquo; she smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks mum.&rdquo; Harry smiled as he hugged her.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks Anne, and I promise anything big happens ever again I will personally tell you first.&rdquo; I grinned.</p><p>&ldquo;You better, I already missed my sons wedding I don&rsquo;t want to be missing any thing else.&rdquo; She grinned.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna hold that against us forever aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Harry asked.</p><p>&ldquo;No, just until my first grandchild is born.&rdquo; She smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Seriously Anne, we only got married two weeks ago.&rdquo; I told her she just shrugged.</p><p>&ldquo;Well firstly, you&rsquo;re part of the family anyway but now you&rsquo;re married to my son, I think it&rsquo;s OK for you to call me mum.&rdquo; She told me.</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever you want mum.&rdquo; I grinned making her laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Mum, are you being serious about the first grandchild thing?\"I asked and she nodded.</p><p>\"Yes daughter in law, I am very serious.&rdquo; She winked.</p><p>&ldquo;Well then, we best get working on that wife.&rdquo; Harry grinned wide.</p><p>&ldquo;Later Husband, we are visiting your family and they do not need to hear about your plans for baby making.&rdquo; I joked when I saw Gemma wince a little at the mention of sex.</p><p>&ldquo;Seriously, if you&rsquo;re going to be talking to each other like that, you can leave.&rdquo; She sulked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, if we get kicked out we can get on with the baby making.&rdquo; Harry joked as he stood up.</p><p>&ldquo;gross, how about no, you will not defile my friend like this.&rdquo; Gemma cried as she stood up and dived on me.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s my wife&hellip;I&rsquo;ve already defiled her, many many times.&rdquo; Harry told her. Gemma screamed and held her hands over her ears as she stood up and ran out of the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Seriously what have married into?\"I asked as Anne laughed.</p><p>\"Welcome to the family Wifey.&rdquo; He smiled as he lent over and kissed me softly.</p><p>&ldquo;You two are cute.&rdquo; Anne gushed as Harry and I pulled out of the kiss.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah we are.&rdquo; I smiled over at her. &ldquo;Mum.&rdquo; </p>",
