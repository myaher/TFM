Long story short, Peter got over it because he actually cares about people, fought him rather publicly and inspired Thor into doing the same.

The thing worked because it kinda followed the formula I mentioned at first: Peter did background stuff, in this case, sneaking into the Black Abbott\u2019s lair to free Thor, and then he could fight the Abbott (or just to free him; I don\u2019t remember what happened). It also worked because what made the Abbott so strong was that he could control other people with the same abilities as him and through that gain their power, so when Spidey had to fight one of them, he wasn\u2019t fighting the Abbott at full power.\u00a0</p><p>tl;dr: teaming up Thor and Spidey could work, against my initial misgivings, without falling back into formulaic nad unoriginal plots and tools.\u00a0</p>",
                "content": "<p>You know, I was gonna write a post about how teaming up Thor and Spider-Man might be a bad idea because of the huge disparity in their power levels, because Spidey won&rsquo;t stand a chance against a Thor villain and Thor would have no challenge against a Spidey villain, and the only way for such a team up to work would be doing what they did with the Giant Monolith - have Thor hold him back while Spidey works to weaken him in the background, which would mean separating them, which, imo, would make the team up go to waste. I mean, the point of teaming up should be to explore the dynamics between the characters, so what&rsquo;s the point if they&rsquo;ll barely interact? Like, that one and their first team up were the only ones I could remember, and not that well - like, Peter predicted danger and Thor saved them thanks to that warning, they had to do something with a crystal, Thor couldn&rsquo;t go to Asgard bc he was banished so Spidey had to go while he went to the home of whoever had inverted energy/frosen everyone up/ whatever, don&rsquo;t even remember how it ended. However, then I remembered that they had two other team ups, which worked because the attacks were mental, so they were equal. In one, an alien shot them with a ray that briught to the surface the worst part of them, or got rid of the best parts, or whatever, making Peter abandon his responsability as Spider-Man and Thor revert into the personality of his alter ego, a doctor, and not remember who he really was, or barely, or maybe he did but the doctor&rsquo;s personality overwhelmed him and he was too scared to act. Long story short, Peter got over it because he actually cares about people, fought him rather publicly and inspired Thor into doing the same. The threat wasn&rsquo;t the alien itself, who just had that weapon, so the fact that Thor was so much powerful than Peter didn&rsquo;t matter. Same the other time, when he became the target of the Black Abbot, who wanted to control him with his psychic powers and had kidnapped him.
