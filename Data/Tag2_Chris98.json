The air was rife with tension. He pushed off the doorframe and came to sit next to her, running his hands through Dodger\u2019s fur.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Frankie. I never meant for this to happen.\u201d</p><p><i>Of course you didn\u2019t. Why would you want to sleep with your fat friend?</i> His rejection burnt deep.</p><p>His eyes searched her face, trying to read her. \u201cI really don\u2019t want to do this,\u201d he continued and Frankie had to fight to breath, \u201cbut I have a breakfast date\u2026\u201d White noise rang through her ears, drowning out his monologue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get out your hair,\u201d she said in a voice so small he barely heard her.</p><p>\u201cPlease Frankie,\u201d he pleaded reaching out to her retreating body.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she said putting on a brave face, betrayed by tears falling down her face, \u201cI hope your date goes well. I can let myself out.\u201d</p><p>Chris wanted to go after her but deep down he knew it would only escalate the situation. <i>Or are you just being a big coward, Chris?</i></p><p>Back in the safety of her own home Frankie broke down and sobbed.</p><p><i>You really are a fuck up Francesca Anne Taylor.</i></p><p>****</p><p>Frankie wallowed in self-pity, Ben and Jerry\u2019s and tequila for a week before picking herself back up and throwing herself into work.

Her plan was to sit at the furthest end of the table away from him so not to raise suspicion. She was sat with Sebastian and Anthony whose constant bantering kept her distracted. Well mostly.</p><p>She dared to sneak a look up at the head of the table. He looked handsome and more at ease than he had looked in months. His plump lips, red from his wine, spread into a smile. The same lips that had explored her body that night.</p><p><i><b>He pulls his lips from her ear lobe and begins to make their descent down her body. He takes her nipple in his mouth as she ruts into him hard, sweet moans escaping her lips. </b></i></p><p>\u201cIf I had known you sounded so pretty I wouldn\u2019t have waited to so long.\u201d </p><p>When she felt heated cobalt eyes meet hers she blushed furiously and looked to Sebastian.</p><p><i>I shouldn\u2019t be here. I don\u2019t belong here.</i></p><p>\u201cIs everything alright, pumpkin?\u201d She turned to look at Robert, who whispered in her ear. \u201cYou look tired.\u201d</p><p><i>You can\u2019t tell him. Chris is his friend. </i>\u201cWork is busy. Sweeney Todd opens in a month and they\u2019re still calling for budget cuts. I\u2019m pretty sure the costume department hate me,\u201d she chuckled and picked up her glass of water.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure it has nothing to do with you and Evans getting chummy at the wedding?\u201d Frankie nearly spat her water and started to cough, drawing attention from their fellow guests.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d her voice hushed. \u201cI was his sympathy date because I had no one else to go with and he didn\u2019t want to look like a loser. Besides, I think he has much better taste in women.\u201d</p><p>Robert knew he was pushing her buttons, but he smirked and pressed on, desperate to get to the bottom of her attitude. \u201cSo there was no hanky panky? You didn\u2019t get to ride the shield?\u201d</p><p>Frankie burnt with embarrassment. \u201cFuck off Robert,\u201d and she stormed off to the bathroom, a few eyes following her.</p><p>Safely away from everyone she splashed cool water onto her face. <i>Fuck Robert Downey Jnr and his stupid powers of perception. </i>She held onto the sink and bowed her head. <i>Just go out there you coward, put on your big girl panties and don\u2019t make this about you.</i></p><p>Before she could enter the private dining room she collided with a large body.</p><p>Chris smiled shyly, helping her catch her balance. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t watching where I was going.\u201d His hands were hot against her bare arms.</p><p><b><i>His hands held her face against his, his tongue battling against hers as he fucked her into the bed. </i></b></p><p>Frankie could barely make eye contact. \u201cNo I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s my fault.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and noted her closed-off body language. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p><i>I slept with my friend and I hate myself for it. </i>\u201cOkay. You?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThank you for the flowers, they were beautiful. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t text\u2026\u201d she sighed, \u201cI\u2019m a coward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have called. I felt terrible for basically kicking you out,\u201d he began but stopped as she stepped back and closed in on herself, tears threatening to escape.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Really. You should go back to your guests. Happy birthday.\u201d He watched her retreat back into the private room and sit next to Robert, pulling him into a tight hug and whisper something in his ear.</p><p>\u201cYou alright buddy?\u201d He turned to see Anthony exiting the bathroom. \u201cYou look a little, I dunno, tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah I\u2019m good, just a lot on my mind with having to go back to Washington,\u201d Chris lied watching Frankie converse with Sebastian. She looked dejected under that mask he knew she wore. Not that he could blame her. <i>You only have yourself to blame, Chris.</i></p>",

Well, trying to. After realizing he can\u2019t sleep without her, Chris decides making up would be better than spending the night alone.</p><p><b>Word Count:</b> 3,355</p><p><b>Warnings:</b> fighting, language, you know the drill</p><p><b>A/N:</b> Thank you so much for this request!

From where I sat in our bed, under the covers, in my pajamas, and not necessarily ready to go to sleep with our issue pressing on my mind, now seemed like the perfect time.<br/></p><p>\tChris was quiet for a moment as I heard the tap water run for a moment before it was replaced with the buzzing of his electric toothbrush. He leaned against the doorframe and I really wished I wasn\u2019t so mad at him. With only his checkered pajama bottoms on, I couldn\u2019t help thinking about how I\u2019d like those off too. Plus, I\u2019d missed him so much while Chris was away filming for the past few months. Especially after such a frustrating day, it was tempting to just say fuck it and cuddle up next to him.</p><p>\tChris raised his eyebrows as if to say, \u201cWell?\u201d as a drop of toothpaste started dribbling down his chin. I rolled my eyes, fluffing my pillow a little too harshly in an attempt to avoid the conversation I\u2019d initiated, but it was obvious to both of us that a hard pillow wasn\u2019t what was making me uncomfortable.</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t like going to bed mad at you,\u201d I huffed quietly. Whether it was because Chris didn\u2019t know what to say or he couldn\u2019t respond amidst all the toothpaste foam, he didn\u2019t acknowledge what I\u2019d said. So I kept talking. \u201cI just don\u2019t think you needed a boys night,\u201d I said, trying to not sound as dejected as I felt. Even I knew that was only the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>\tChris rolled his eyes pointedly before ducking into the bathroom. I heard the water run again as he spit, dreading when the tap turned off. He came out with his arms crossed, accentuating his taught biceps. It really wasn\u2019t fair Chris seemed to be even less resistible when I was angry with him. One of his eyebrows hung a little lower than the other as Chris looked at me with a concentrated irritation and his mouth dangled open just enough to notice. \u201cReally?\u201d he asked in a tone that simply screamed he thought I was being ridiculous to be this upset about such a thing.</p><p>\tAlthough it was rhetorical, I answered anyway. \u201cYes,\u201d I shot back, crossing my own arms to show I was just as capable of sticking to my guns. Chris did this thing where he\u2019d make me feel irrational for being upset about something so trivial every time we argued. I don\u2019t think he meant to be so high and mighty, but being belittled was so frustrating when all I wanted was for him to take my feelings seriously.</p><p>\t\u201cI only went out for a beer with the boys. Sorry, I came home later than I said, sue me,\u201d Chris said with a shrug, puffing out his bottom lip in an attempt to be nonchalant. I wasn\u2019t going to let him brush it off that easy. \u201cIt\u2019s not about that, Chris,\u201d I sighed as my shoulders slumped, so defeated before the battle really began. I wished he could just know how I feel and why without these arguments that boil over into bigger fights so easily.</p><p>I was tired of it. Of all of the days spent without him while Chris was across the country working, all of the arguments we had over Skype, and the fights stemming from unresolved issues when he was finally home. I was tired of explaining myself to someone who made no attempts to understand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just-\u201d I started anyway, my tone a little too shrill. Chris raised his eyebrows with a teasing encouragement as if he couldn\u2019t wait to see what came out of my mouth next. He stayed planted by the bathroom door, like a tree that would stubbornly stand tall in the face of a storm. Like a guy who would rather stand there than climb into bed next to me.</p><p>I cleared my throat and tried again, more conscious of the lump inside of it than ever. \u201cI rarely see you with how often you\u2019ve been working lately. And when you\u2019re here, you\u2019re barely even home,\u201d I concluded when my voice cracked. I wasn\u2019t going to cry- at least that\u2019s what I kept telling myself.</p><p>Chris\u2019s lips turned up in a smirk which felt more like a punch in the stomach. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry that I want to see my friends,\u201d he said sarcastically. I tried to breathe deeply, suppressing my desperate need to snap at him. If I was going to ask him to be more considerate, the least I could do was offer him the same. But he made that a hell of a lot easier said than done sometimes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know that isn\u2019t what I mean,\u201d I spoke through gritted teeth. Chris could tell he was really bothering me now, but that didn\u2019t stop him. \u201cWhat is it then, huh?\u201d he pressed. Chris put his hands on his hips and let his face adopt a look of concern as he feigned curiosity.</p><p>I didn\u2019t respond, which wasn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t have anything to say to something so inane. I just had better things to focus on like holding in my tears, but Chris took it as an opportunity to keep pressing my buttons. \u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t hold my work schedule against me. I told you I wouldn\u2019t be around and you signed up for this anyway,\u201d he reminded me as if that solved our problems. As if the fact that he was already some big famous actor when we met, something our entire relationship was built to cope with, could just casually slip my mind. As if I would laugh it off and say, \u201cOh, yeah. Sorry, my bad.\u201d</p><p>Instead, I stared at him with tears welling up in my eyes. My bottom lip trembled as I tried to hold it together. Angry crying was the most aggravating thing. Chris always came back down to earth to comfort me and I felt guilty for some reason and our problem never got resolved since the fight was put on hold. I refused to let that happen this time. I tried to swallow the lump in my throat, which was growing into more of a boulder now. \u201cThat isn\u2019t what this is about Chris,\u201d I said lowly. I tried to sound stern, but it came out more like a plea.</p><p>Chris buried his face in his hands, his chest rising with each deep breath. \u201cWell, you aren\u2019t exactly telling me,\u201d he huffed with frustration. When he lifted his head, he looked absolutely done. His words hung in the thick air between us for a while, neither of us accepting defeat. I always struggled with finding the right words, especially when I was so upset. As exasperating as it was to feel like Chris didn\u2019t understand me, he was right to say I didn\u2019t explain myself well.</p><p>\u201cLook, if you\u2019re upset because I went out with my friends instead of staying here with you, I\u2019m not going to apologize for that,\u201d Chris finally said indignantly. I just looked at him with my mouth opening and closing like a fish out of water, knowing that if I spoke I would erupt into tears.</p><p>That only seemed to make Chris angrier. \u201cDammit!\u201d he shouted, facing the wall instead of me. He slammed a hand against the wall, causing me to jump while the picture frames shook on their hooks. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair of you to bring up some fucking issue you have without even being able to say shit about it, you know that? I\u2019m not a mind reader,\u201d Chris yelled, whipping around to face me. His blue eyes were wide and full of emotion, trying to convey all of the feelings his words couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Still, I sat on our bed unable to say a word, painfully aware of how small I felt under his angry gaze. Chris ran a hand through his hair, trying to collect himself. He turned to face the wall again as if he couldn\u2019t even stand to look at me, but he spun again to look at me as he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what your problem is.\u201d Chris\u2019s nostrils flared as his voice started to rise again.</p><p>\u201cIs it that seeing other people makes you feel like you aren\u2019t enough for me? Or maybe it\u2019s because I have better things to do than tend to your every beck and call? I hate to break it to you darling, but you aren\u2019t the center of my entire fucking universe.\u201d Chris spoke with a resigned certainty as he spit the kind of words that hit you right where it hurts, the kind of hurt you don\u2019t forget. I knew I\u2019d always have that wildly vexed look in his eye, the way he sounded so dissatisfied with me, and the feeling of my heart dropping burned into my memory. I was my closest to crying then as the tears brimmed my eyes and threatened to fall despite my best efforts, but I refused to give Chris the satisfaction of knowing he\u2019d gotten to me.</p><p>It seemed Chris immediately regretted the words even as they left his lips. The vein bulging on his forehead seemed to fade away again as he took a few deep breaths, grappling to get back the temper he\u2019d lost. Chris averted his eyes to the floor, running a hand through his messy hair. This time, when he turned to the wall because he couldn\u2019t look at me, I knew it wasn\u2019t because he was angry. Chris was guilty. \u201cI just want to go to bed,\u201d he finally said, sounding so ragged I almost wanted to drop it. Still, he didn\u2019t make a move toward our bed.</p><p>But I knew if we did, it would be even more of a fight next time I was bothered enough to bring it up. \u201cI want to fix this,\u201d I challenged, gesturing to the space between us. It was only a few feet, but it felt like he was on Jupiter. I wanted Chris to sit down next to me and crack his knuckles, saying something about how we\u2019d have to get on with that then so we could both just be happy. Instead, he pinched the bridge of his nose again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d Chris sighed, making his choice. I hated wondering if he intended it in the sleepy kind of way or if he meant he was tired of me. Maybe bringing this up when he was tired and toeing the line between tipsy and drunk wasn\u2019t the best idea. Regardless, I couldn\u2019t stand being around him any longer. I stood quickly, snatching my pillow and a throw blanket before Chris could even process the fact that I\u2019d rather sleep on the couch than in the same room as him. \u201cAll yours,\u201d I spit at him as I slammed the door behind me, hating myself for hoping he\u2019d feel half as alone as I did.</p><p>I didn\u2019t allow myself to let out all of my pent up emotion until I was in the living room and even then I prayed it was far enough from our bedroom that Chris couldn\u2019t hear how I screamed into a pillow, suddenly filled with more rage than anything. I was too mad to even cry. Mad at Chris and myself and the situation. I fell back on the couch, hoping I could go to sleep and forget about everything for at least a few hours, but I had no such luck.</p><p>Even as emotionally exhausted as I was, it seemed all I could do was stare at the ceiling. It felt wrong to fall asleep without the familiar feeling of Chris pressed against my back, our legs entwined. I could tell when he fell asleep when his breaths which always tickled my ear grew slower and softer. Knowing Chris was peacefully resting made it easier for me to sleep. How he always smelled, like clean laundry and a fresh shower and something else I could only describe as Chris, didn\u2019t hurt either. I laid there for hours, tossing and turning just like I did every night he was gone.</p><p>My ears perked up when I heard a door creak open from far away. In the quiet night, the feet padding down, slow with hesitation before gaining a sure speed, resonated through the otherwise empty house. My heart dropped as dealing with all of this became even more impending, but I couldn\u2019t ignore the butterflies that exploded in my stomach simultaneously.</p><p>I sat up when I heard the footsteps stop. Chris stood before me, rubbing his bicep nervously. His hair was in disarray like he\u2019d been running his hands through it more times than I could count. He had red, puffy eyes and tear-stained cheeks, which only made him look even more like a little boy who\u2019d stumbled into his parents&rsquo; room after a nightmare. It broke my heart to know I\u2019d had a hand in this.</p><p>Chris started to speak, but his voice cracked so painfully he stopped to compose himself. Before he could try again and I could think about it, I stood and wrapped my arms around him so tightly I thought I\u2019d never be able to untangle myself from him. I didn\u2019t want to, either. Every concern about maintaining my pride or how angry I was fled my mind. I knew none of that mattered. At the end of the day, we just knew we needed each other.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before strong arms enveloped me, pulling my body into a familiar chest as I was wracked with sobs that finally escaped. It was like a dam broke, tears I\u2019d been holding in for so long just poured out of me in a massive wave. Chris took a seat on the couch and guided me with him, shushing me quietly while holding me tight. I sat in his lap, crying so hard I started to hiccup and hyperventilate. Chris only hugged me tighter, telling me to focus on his heartbeat and breathe with him. I tried and failed and finally, he just peppered the top of my head with gentle kisses and whispered apologies until I ran out of tears.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d I said quietly with an unsteady voice, careful not to speak too loudly in the dead of night. I don\u2019t know who I was nervous to disturb, it was just the two of us. The way it was supposed to be. Chris shrugged his strong shoulders, looking up at me through his dark lashes as he slumped into the couch.\u00a0\u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep without you,\u201d he whispered back to me like it was a secret only we could know. A silence stretched between us after that, neither of us too sure of what to say or where to start.<br/></p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said that. I was way out of line,\u201d Chris said before pressing a long kiss to my forehead once I could catch my breath. I couldn\u2019t care about keeping up appearances anymore, we needed to be real with each other and actually talk this out. I tucked my head into the crook of Chris\u2019s neck, allowing myself to melt into his warmth. \u00a0\u201cIt was so wrong,\u201d I reiterated, my voice still shaking. Chris\u2019s chest shook with his chuckle, the deep vibration bringing me a comfort that was almost jarring. \u201cSo wrong,\u201d he repeated, rubbing calming circles on the small of my back.</p><p>\u201cI just have a hard time understanding you sometimes,\u201d he continued slowly, careful to choose the right words before concluding, \u201cthen I get upset with myself for it, but I shouldn\u2019t take that out on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d I reassured him, wiping the tears from under my chin. I re-positioned myself so I was facing Chris now. The pained look on his face made this more difficult, but there was something so entrancing about how the moonlight coming through the window played with the structured lines of his face. Chris looked soft and pretty, a welcomed contrast to the angry red he\u2019d been earlier. He looked like the Chris I knew and loved. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to communicate better instead of shutting down,\u201d I promised. Chris gave me a tight-lipped smile as he caressed my face, wiping my tears.</p><p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s really been on your mind,\u201d Chris whispered like he was testing the waters with more of an invitation than a demand. I swallowed my reservations, knowing that this was a safer space than the argument we\u2019d had before. Chris was genuinely all ears, I could tell by the patience he exuded.</p><p>\u201cYou know I love how much you love your work,\u201d I said as I looked him right in the eye, hoping he understood how honest I was. \u201cAnd I love your friends, too. I love that you have these things that make you so happy\u2026 I don\u2019t have a problem sharing you,\u201d I continued, averting my eyes to where my hands sat wringing in my lap.</p><p>Chris took notice and held my hands in his, rubbing small circles with his thumbs on my palms. I sighed, knowing he was trying to be understanding, but that meant I had to allow him to be. \u201cI just miss you so much when you\u2019re away and even when you\u2019re here it\u2019s like you aren\u2019t really with me.\u201d</p><p>Tears started slipping down my cheeks again. I watched as they dripped down my chin and fell on our hands. \u201cI-I feel like you don\u2019t want to be,\u201d I confessed. Before I finished saying the words, Chris pulled me into another hug. My cheek pressed against his chest, the steady thump of his heart and its movement with each of his breaths bringing me comfort. It reminded me that he was here with me, grounding me back to Earth.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Chris whispered, the conviction still evident in his voice. \u201cCouldn\u2019t be farther from the truth,\u201d he reassured me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I made you feel like that\u2026 I didn\u2019t even know you did.\u201d Chris pulled away from the hug, holding me at arm\u2019s length. He tilted my chin up so I looked at him and with the kind of intensity he had in his eyes it was hard to look away.</p><p>\u201cI love you more than anything,\u201d Chris declared like he was telling me the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, it was a fact of life. \u201cIt makes being away from you a hell of a lot harder than it\u2019s ever been for me before. I guess I was trying to distance myself to make it easier when I\u2019m gone,\u201d Chris sighed, running his fingers through his hair again. \u201cClearly doesn\u2019t work,\u201d he chuckled. I laughed too, for what felt like the first time in way too long.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like when we fight,\u201d I told him, playing with his fingers until they became laced together with mine. \u201cGee, no \u2018I love you too, light of my life?\u2019\u201d Chris poked fun at me. I rolled my eyes, but I wasn\u2019t really annoyed, probably given away by my goofy grin. \u201cYou know I do,\u201d I replied, leaning forward to place a kiss on his cheek, already itchy with stubble. When I pulled away, I saw Chris beaming at me with a smile from ear to ear and a light he\u2019d lost before back in his eye. With a voice that was still raspy from his tiredness, Chris said, \u201cI don\u2019t like it either.\u201d</p><p>He stood, pulling me by our locked-together hands so I\u2019d follow him. Chris swung our arms between us as he looked down at me with a kindness I\u2019d missed. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we get some sleep?\u201d he prompted, tugging us toward the hallway. I walked a little faster so our steps would be in sync, allowing me to cuddle up against his side until we climbed into bed, where we finally fell asleep in each other\u2019s arms.</p>",

From where I sat in our bed, under the covers, in my pajamas, and not necessarily ready to go to sleep with our issue pressing on my mind, now seemed like the perfect time.<br></p><p>\tChris was quiet for a moment as I heard the tap water run for a moment before it was replaced with the buzzing of his electric toothbrush. He leaned against the doorframe and I really wished I wasn\u2019t so mad at him. With only his checkered pajama bottoms on, I couldn\u2019t help thinking about how I\u2019d like those off too. Plus, I\u2019d missed him so much while Chris was away filming for the past few months. Especially after such a frustrating day, it was tempting to just say fuck it and cuddle up next to him.</p><p>\tChris raised his eyebrows as if to say, \u201cWell?\u201d as a drop of toothpaste started dribbling down his chin. I rolled my eyes, fluffing my pillow a little too harshly in an attempt to avoid the conversation I\u2019d initiated, but it was obvious to both of us that a hard pillow wasn\u2019t what was making me uncomfortable.</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t like going to bed mad at you,\u201d I huffed quietly. Whether it was because Chris didn\u2019t know what to say or he couldn\u2019t respond amidst all the toothpaste foam, he didn\u2019t acknowledge what I\u2019d said. So I kept talking. \u201cI just don\u2019t think you needed a boys night,\u201d I said, trying to not sound as dejected as I felt. Even I knew that was only the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>\tChris rolled his eyes pointedly before ducking into the bathroom. I heard the water run again as he spit, dreading when the tap turned off. He came out with his arms crossed, accentuating his taught biceps. It really wasn\u2019t fair Chris seemed to be even less resistible when I was angry with him. One of his eyebrows hung a little lower than the other as Chris looked at me with a concentrated irritation and his mouth dangled open just enough to notice. \u201cReally?\u201d he asked in a tone that simply screamed he thought I was being ridiculous to be this upset about such a thing.</p><p>\tAlthough it was rhetorical, I answered anyway. \u201cYes,\u201d I shot back, crossing my own arms to show I was just as capable of sticking to my guns. Chris did this thing where he\u2019d make me feel irrational for being upset about something so trivial every time we argued. I don\u2019t think he meant to be so high and mighty, but being belittled was so frustrating when all I wanted was for him to take my feelings seriously.</p><p>\t\u201cI only went out for a beer with the boys. Sorry, I came home later than I said, sue me,\u201d Chris said with a shrug, puffing out his bottom lip in an attempt to be nonchalant. I wasn\u2019t going to let him brush it off that easy. \u201cIt\u2019s not about that, Chris,\u201d I sighed as my shoulders slumped, so defeated before the battle really began. I wished he could just know how I feel and why without these arguments that boil over into bigger fights so easily.</p><p>I was tired of it. Of all of the days spent without him while Chris was across the country working, all of the arguments we had over Skype, and the fights stemming from unresolved issues when he was finally home. I was tired of explaining myself to someone who made no attempts to understand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just-\u201d I started anyway, my tone a little too shrill. Chris raised his eyebrows with a teasing encouragement as if he couldn\u2019t wait to see what came out of my mouth next. He stayed planted by the bathroom door, like a tree that would stubbornly stand tall in the face of a storm. Like a guy who would rather stand there than climb into bed next to me.</p><p>I cleared my throat and tried again, more conscious of the lump inside of it than ever. \u201cI rarely see you with how often you\u2019ve been working lately. And when you\u2019re here, you\u2019re barely even home,\u201d I concluded when my voice cracked. I wasn\u2019t going to cry- at least that\u2019s what I kept telling myself.</p><p>Chris\u2019s lips turned up in a smirk which felt more like a punch in the stomach. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry that I want to see my friends,\u201d he said sarcastically. I tried to breathe deeply, suppressing my desperate need to snap at him. If I was going to ask him to be more considerate, the least I could do was offer him the same. But he made that a hell of a lot easier said than done sometimes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know that isn\u2019t what I mean,\u201d I spoke through gritted teeth. Chris could tell he was really bothering me now, but that didn\u2019t stop him. \u201cWhat is it then, huh?\u201d he pressed. Chris put his hands on his hips and let his face adopt a look of concern as he feigned curiosity.</p><p>I didn\u2019t respond, which wasn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t have anything to say to something so inane. I just had better things to focus on like holding in my tears, but Chris took it as an opportunity to keep pressing my buttons. \u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t hold my work schedule against me. I told you I wouldn\u2019t be around and you signed up for this anyway,\u201d he reminded me as if that solved our problems. As if the fact that he was already some big famous actor when we met, something our entire relationship was built to cope with, could just casually slip my mind. As if I would laugh it off and say, \u201cOh, yeah. Sorry, my bad.\u201d</p><p>Instead, I stared at him with tears welling up in my eyes. My bottom lip trembled as I tried to hold it together. Angry crying was the most aggravating thing. Chris always came back down to earth to comfort me and I felt guilty for some reason and our problem never got resolved since the fight was put on hold. I refused to let that happen this time. I tried to swallow the lump in my throat, which was growing into more of a boulder now. \u201cThat isn\u2019t what this is about Chris,\u201d I said lowly. I tried to sound stern, but it came out more like a plea.</p><p>Chris buried his face in his hands, his chest rising with each deep breath. \u201cWell, you aren\u2019t exactly telling me,\u201d he huffed with frustration. When he lifted his head, he looked absolutely done. His words hung in the thick air between us for a while, neither of us accepting defeat. I always struggled with finding the right words, especially when I was so upset. As exasperating as it was to feel like Chris didn\u2019t understand me, he was right to say I didn\u2019t explain myself well.</p><p>\u201cLook, if you\u2019re upset because I went out with my friends instead of staying here with you, I\u2019m not going to apologize for that,\u201d Chris finally said indignantly. I just looked at him with my mouth opening and closing like a fish out of water, knowing that if I spoke I would erupt into tears.</p><p>That only seemed to make Chris angrier. \u201cDammit!\u201d he shouted, facing the wall instead of me. He slammed a hand against the wall, causing me to jump while the picture frames shook on their hooks. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair of you to bring up some fucking issue you have without even being able to say shit about it, you know that? I\u2019m not a mind reader,\u201d Chris yelled, whipping around to face me. His blue eyes were wide and full of emotion, trying to convey all of the feelings his words couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Still, I sat on our bed unable to say a word, painfully aware of how small I felt under his angry gaze. Chris ran a hand through his hair, trying to collect himself. He turned to face the wall again as if he couldn\u2019t even stand to look at me, but he spun again to look at me as he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what your problem is.\u201d Chris\u2019s nostrils flared as his voice started to rise again.</p><p>\u201cIs it that seeing other people makes you feel like you aren\u2019t enough for me? Or maybe it\u2019s because I have better things to do than tend to your every beck and call? I hate to break it to you darling, but you aren\u2019t the center of my entire fucking universe.\u201d Chris spoke with a resigned certainty as he spit the kind of words that hit you right where it hurts, the kind of hurt you don\u2019t forget. I knew I\u2019d always have that wildly vexed look in his eye, the way he sounded so dissatisfied with me, and the feeling of my heart dropping burned into my memory. I was my closest to crying then as the tears brimmed my eyes and threatened to fall despite my best efforts, but I refused to give Chris the satisfaction of knowing he\u2019d gotten to me.</p><p>It seemed Chris immediately regretted the words even as they left his lips. The vein bulging on his forehead seemed to fade away again as he took a few deep breaths, grappling to get back the temper he\u2019d lost. Chris averted his eyes to the floor, running a hand through his messy hair. This time, when he turned to the wall because he couldn\u2019t look at me, I knew it wasn\u2019t because he was angry. Chris was guilty. \u201cI just want to go to bed,\u201d he finally said, sounding so ragged I almost wanted to drop it. Still, he didn\u2019t make a move toward our bed.</p><p>But I knew if we did, it would be even more of a fight next time I was bothered enough to bring it up. \u201cI want to fix this,\u201d I challenged, gesturing to the space between us. It was only a few feet, but it felt like he was on Jupiter. I wanted Chris to sit down next to me and crack his knuckles, saying something about how we\u2019d have to get on with that then so we could both just be happy. Instead, he pinched the bridge of his nose again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d Chris sighed, making his choice. I hated wondering if he intended it in the sleepy kind of way or if he meant he was tired of me. Maybe bringing this up when he was tired and toeing the line between tipsy and drunk wasn\u2019t the best idea. Regardless, I couldn\u2019t stand being around him any longer. I stood quickly, snatching my pillow and a throw blanket before Chris could even process the fact that I\u2019d rather sleep on the couch than in the same room as him. \u201cAll yours,\u201d I spit at him as I slammed the door behind me, hating myself for hoping he\u2019d feel half as alone as I did.</p><p>I didn\u2019t allow myself to let out all of my pent up emotion until I was in the living room and even then I prayed it was far enough from our bedroom that Chris couldn\u2019t hear how I screamed into a pillow, suddenly filled with more rage than anything. I was too mad to even cry. Mad at Chris and myself and the situation. I fell back on the couch, hoping I could go to sleep and forget about everything for at least a few hours, but I had no such luck.</p><p>Even as emotionally exhausted as I was, it seemed all I could do was stare at the ceiling. It felt wrong to fall asleep without the familiar feeling of Chris pressed against my back, our legs entwined. I could tell when he fell asleep when his breaths which always tickled my ear grew slower and softer. Knowing Chris was peacefully resting made it easier for me to sleep. How he always smelled, like clean laundry and a fresh shower and something else I could only describe as Chris, didn\u2019t hurt either. I laid there for hours, tossing and turning just like I did every night he was gone.</p><p>My ears perked up when I heard a door creak open from far away. In the quiet night, the feet padding down, slow with hesitation before gaining a sure speed, resonated through the otherwise empty house. My heart dropped as dealing with all of this became even more impending, but I couldn\u2019t ignore the butterflies that exploded in my stomach simultaneously.</p><p>I sat up when I heard the footsteps stop. Chris stood before me, rubbing his bicep nervously. His hair was in disarray like he\u2019d been running his hands through it more times than I could count. He had red, puffy eyes and tear-stained cheeks, which only made him look even more like a little boy who\u2019d stumbled into his parents\u2019 room after a nightmare. It broke my heart to know I\u2019d had a hand in this.</p><p>Chris started to speak, but his voice cracked so painfully he stopped to compose himself. Before he could try again and I could think about it, I stood and wrapped my arms around him so tightly I thought I\u2019d never be able to untangle myself from him. I didn\u2019t want to, either. Every concern about maintaining my pride or how angry I was fled my mind. I knew none of that mattered. At the end of the day, we just knew we needed each other.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before strong arms enveloped me, pulling my body into a familiar chest as I was wracked with sobs that finally escaped. It was like a dam broke, tears I\u2019d been holding in for so long just poured out of me in a massive wave. Chris took a seat on the couch and guided me with him, shushing me quietly while holding me tight. I sat in his lap, crying so hard I started to hiccup and hyperventilate. Chris only hugged me tighter, telling me to focus on his heartbeat and breathe with him. I tried and failed and finally, he just peppered the top of my head with gentle kisses and whispered apologies until I ran out of tears.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d I said quietly with an unsteady voice, careful not to speak too loudly in the dead of night. I don\u2019t know who I was nervous to disturb, it was just the two of us. The way it was supposed to be. Chris shrugged his strong shoulders, looking up at me through his dark lashes as he slumped into the couch.\u00a0\u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep without you,\u201d he whispered back to me like it was a secret only we could know. A silence stretched between us after that, neither of us too sure of what to say or where to start.<br></p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said that. I was way out of line,\u201d Chris said before pressing a long kiss to my forehead once I could catch my breath. I couldn\u2019t care about keeping up appearances anymore, we needed to be real with each other and actually talk this out. I tucked my head into the crook of Chris\u2019s neck, allowing myself to melt into his warmth. \u00a0\u201cIt was so wrong,\u201d I reiterated, my voice still shaking. Chris\u2019s chest shook with his chuckle, the deep vibration bringing me a comfort that was almost jarring. \u201cSo wrong,\u201d he repeated, rubbing calming circles on the small of my back.</p><p>\u201cI just have a hard time understanding you sometimes,\u201d he continued slowly, careful to choose the right words before concluding, \u201cthen I get upset with myself for it, but I shouldn\u2019t take that out on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d I reassured him, wiping the tears from under my chin. I re-positioned myself so I was facing Chris now. The pained look on his face made this more difficult, but there was something so entrancing about how the moonlight coming through the window played with the structured lines of his face. Chris looked soft and pretty, a welcomed contrast to the angry red he\u2019d been earlier. He looked like the Chris I knew and loved. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to communicate better instead of shutting down,\u201d I promised. Chris gave me a tight-lipped smile as he caressed my face, wiping my tears.</p><p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s really been on your mind,\u201d Chris whispered like he was testing the waters with more of an invitation than a demand. I swallowed my reservations, knowing that this was a safer space than the argument we\u2019d had before. Chris was genuinely all ears, I could tell by the patience he exuded.</p><p>\u201cYou know I love how much you love your work,\u201d I said as I looked him right in the eye, hoping he understood how honest I was. \u201cAnd I love your friends, too. I love that you have these things that make you so happy\u2026 I don\u2019t have a problem sharing you,\u201d I continued, averting my eyes to where my hands sat wringing in my lap.</p><p>Chris took notice and held my hands in his, rubbing small circles with his thumbs on my palms. I sighed, knowing he was trying to be understanding, but that meant I had to allow him to be. \u201cI just miss you so much when you\u2019re away and even when you\u2019re here it\u2019s like you aren\u2019t really with me.\u201d</p><p>Tears started slipping down my cheeks again. I watched as they dripped down my chin and fell on our hands. \u201cI-I feel like you don\u2019t want to be,\u201d I confessed. Before I finished saying the words, Chris pulled me into another hug. My cheek pressed against his chest, the steady thump of his heart and its movement with each of his breaths bringing me comfort. It reminded me that he was here with me, grounding me back to Earth.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Chris whispered, the conviction still evident in his voice. \u201cCouldn\u2019t be farther from the truth,\u201d he reassured me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I made you feel like that\u2026 I didn\u2019t even know you did.\u201d Chris pulled away from the hug, holding me at arm\u2019s length. He tilted my chin up so I looked at him and with the kind of intensity he had in his eyes it was hard to look away.</p><p>\u201cI love you more than anything,\u201d Chris declared like he was telling me the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, it was a fact of life. \u201cIt makes being away from you a hell of a lot harder than it\u2019s ever been for me before. I guess I was trying to distance myself to make it easier when I\u2019m gone,\u201d Chris sighed, running his fingers through his hair again. \u201cClearly doesn\u2019t work,\u201d he chuckled. I laughed too, for what felt like the first time in way too long.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like when we fight,\u201d I told him, playing with his fingers until they became laced together with mine. \u201cGee, no \u2018I love you too, light of my life?\u2019\u201d Chris poked fun at me. I rolled my eyes, but I wasn\u2019t really annoyed, probably given away by my goofy grin. \u201cYou know I do,\u201d I replied, leaning forward to place a kiss on his cheek, already itchy with stubble. When I pulled away, I saw Chris beaming at me with a smile from ear to ear and a light he\u2019d lost before back in his eye. With a voice that was still raspy from his tiredness, Chris said, \u201cI don\u2019t like it either.\u201d</p><p>He stood, pulling me by our locked-together hands so I\u2019d follow him. Chris swung our arms between us as he looked down at me with a kindness I\u2019d missed. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we get some sleep?\u201d he prompted, tugging us toward the hallway. I walked a little faster so our steps would be in sync, allowing me to cuddle up against his side until we climbed into bed, where we finally fell asleep in each other\u2019s arms.</p>",

From where I sat in our bed, under the covers, in my pajamas, and not necessarily ready to go to sleep with our issue pressing on my mind, now seemed like the perfect time.<br></p><p>\tChris was quiet for a moment as I heard the tap water run for a moment before it was replaced with the buzzing of his electric toothbrush. He leaned against the doorframe and I really wished I wasn\u2019t so mad at him. With only his checkered pajama bottoms on, I couldn\u2019t help thinking about how I\u2019d like those off too. Plus, I\u2019d missed him so much while Chris was away filming for the past few months. Especially after such a frustrating day, it was tempting to just say fuck it and cuddle up next to him.</p><p>\tChris raised his eyebrows as if to say, \u201cWell?\u201d as a drop of toothpaste started dribbling down his chin. I rolled my eyes, fluffing my pillow a little too harshly in an attempt to avoid the conversation I\u2019d initiated, but it was obvious to both of us that a hard pillow wasn\u2019t what was making me uncomfortable.</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t like going to bed mad at you,\u201d I huffed quietly. Whether it was because Chris didn\u2019t know what to say or he couldn\u2019t respond amidst all the toothpaste foam, he didn\u2019t acknowledge what I\u2019d said. So I kept talking. \u201cI just don\u2019t think you needed a boys night,\u201d I said, trying to not sound as dejected as I felt. Even I knew that was only the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>\tChris rolled his eyes pointedly before ducking into the bathroom. I heard the water run again as he spit, dreading when the tap turned off. He came out with his arms crossed, accentuating his taught biceps. It really wasn\u2019t fair Chris seemed to be even less resistible when I was angry with him. One of his eyebrows hung a little lower than the other as Chris looked at me with a concentrated irritation and his mouth dangled open just enough to notice. \u201cReally?\u201d he asked in a tone that simply screamed he thought I was being ridiculous to be this upset about such a thing.</p><p>\tAlthough it was rhetorical, I answered anyway. \u201cYes,\u201d I shot back, crossing my own arms to show I was just as capable of sticking to my guns. Chris did this thing where he\u2019d make me feel irrational for being upset about something so trivial every time we argued. I don\u2019t think he meant to be so high and mighty, but being belittled was so frustrating when all I wanted was for him to take my feelings seriously.</p><p>\t\u201cI only went out for a beer with the boys. Sorry, I came home later than I said, sue me,\u201d Chris said with a shrug, puffing out his bottom lip in an attempt to be nonchalant. I wasn\u2019t going to let him brush it off that easy. \u201cIt\u2019s not about that, Chris,\u201d I sighed as my shoulders slumped, so defeated before the battle really began. I wished he could just know how I feel and why without these arguments that boil over into bigger fights so easily.</p><p>I was tired of it. Of all of the days spent without him while Chris was across the country working, all of the arguments we had over Skype, and the fights stemming from unresolved issues when he was finally home. I was tired of explaining myself to someone who made no attempts to understand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just-\u201d I started anyway, my tone a little too shrill. Chris raised his eyebrows with a teasing encouragement as if he couldn\u2019t wait to see what came out of my mouth next. He stayed planted by the bathroom door, like a tree that would stubbornly stand tall in the face of a storm. Like a guy who would rather stand there than climb into bed next to me.</p><p>I cleared my throat and tried again, more conscious of the lump inside of it than ever. \u201cI rarely see you with how often you\u2019ve been working lately. And when you\u2019re here, you\u2019re barely even home,\u201d I concluded when my voice cracked. I wasn\u2019t going to cry- at least that\u2019s what I kept telling myself.</p><p>Chris\u2019s lips turned up in a smirk which felt more like a punch in the stomach. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry that I want to see my friends,\u201d he said sarcastically. I tried to breathe deeply, suppressing my desperate need to snap at him. If I was going to ask him to be more considerate, the least I could do was offer him the same. But he made that a hell of a lot easier said than done sometimes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know that isn\u2019t what I mean,\u201d I spoke through gritted teeth. Chris could tell he was really bothering me now, but that didn\u2019t stop him. \u201cWhat is it then, huh?\u201d he pressed. Chris put his hands on his hips and let his face adopt a look of concern as he feigned curiosity.</p><p>I didn\u2019t respond, which wasn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t have anything to say to something so inane. I just had better things to focus on like holding in my tears, but Chris took it as an opportunity to keep pressing my buttons. \u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t hold my work schedule against me. I told you I wouldn\u2019t be around and you signed up for this anyway,\u201d he reminded me as if that solved our problems. As if the fact that he was already some big famous actor when we met, something our entire relationship was built to cope with, could just casually slip my mind. As if I would laugh it off and say, \u201cOh, yeah. Sorry, my bad.\u201d</p><p>Instead, I stared at him with tears welling up in my eyes. My bottom lip trembled as I tried to hold it together. Angry crying was the most aggravating thing. Chris always came back down to earth to comfort me and I felt guilty for some reason and our problem never got resolved since the fight was put on hold. I refused to let that happen this time. I tried to swallow the lump in my throat, which was growing into more of a boulder now. \u201cThat isn\u2019t what this is about Chris,\u201d I said lowly. I tried to sound stern, but it came out more like a plea.</p><p>Chris buried his face in his hands, his chest rising with each deep breath. \u201cWell, you aren\u2019t exactly telling me,\u201d he huffed with frustration. When he lifted his head, he looked absolutely done. His words hung in the thick air between us for a while, neither of us accepting defeat. I always struggled with finding the right words, especially when I was so upset. As exasperating as it was to feel like Chris didn\u2019t understand me, he was right to say I didn\u2019t explain myself well.</p><p>\u201cLook, if you\u2019re upset because I went out with my friends instead of staying here with you, I\u2019m not going to apologize for that,\u201d Chris finally said indignantly. I just looked at him with my mouth opening and closing like a fish out of water, knowing that if I spoke I would erupt into tears.</p><p>That only seemed to make Chris angrier. \u201cDammit!\u201d he shouted, facing the wall instead of me. He slammed a hand against the wall, causing me to jump while the picture frames shook on their hooks. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair of you to bring up some fucking issue you have without even being able to say shit about it, you know that? I\u2019m not a mind reader,\u201d Chris yelled, whipping around to face me. His blue eyes were wide and full of emotion, trying to convey all of the feelings his words couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Still, I sat on our bed unable to say a word, painfully aware of how small I felt under his angry gaze. Chris ran a hand through his hair, trying to collect himself. He turned to face the wall again as if he couldn\u2019t even stand to look at me, but he spun again to look at me as he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what your problem is.\u201d Chris\u2019s nostrils flared as his voice started to rise again.</p><p>\u201cIs it that seeing other people makes you feel like you aren\u2019t enough for me? Or maybe it\u2019s because I have better things to do than tend to your every beck and call? I hate to break it to you darling, but you aren\u2019t the center of my entire fucking universe.\u201d Chris spoke with a resigned certainty as he spit the kind of words that hit you right where it hurts, the kind of hurt you don\u2019t forget. I knew I\u2019d always have that wildly vexed look in his eye, the way he sounded so dissatisfied with me, and the feeling of my heart dropping burned into my memory. I was my closest to crying then as the tears brimmed my eyes and threatened to fall despite my best efforts, but I refused to give Chris the satisfaction of knowing he\u2019d gotten to me.</p><p>It seemed Chris immediately regretted the words even as they left his lips. The vein bulging on his forehead seemed to fade away again as he took a few deep breaths, grappling to get back the temper he\u2019d lost. Chris averted his eyes to the floor, running a hand through his messy hair. This time, when he turned to the wall because he couldn\u2019t look at me, I knew it wasn\u2019t because he was angry. Chris was guilty. \u201cI just want to go to bed,\u201d he finally said, sounding so ragged I almost wanted to drop it. Still, he didn\u2019t make a move toward our bed.</p><p>But I knew if we did, it would be even more of a fight next time I was bothered enough to bring it up. \u201cI want to fix this,\u201d I challenged, gesturing to the space between us. It was only a few feet, but it felt like he was on Jupiter. I wanted Chris to sit down next to me and crack his knuckles, saying something about how we\u2019d have to get on with that then so we could both just be happy. Instead, he pinched the bridge of his nose again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d Chris sighed, making his choice. I hated wondering if he intended it in the sleepy kind of way or if he meant he was tired of me. Maybe bringing this up when he was tired and toeing the line between tipsy and drunk wasn\u2019t the best idea. Regardless, I couldn\u2019t stand being around him any longer. I stood quickly, snatching my pillow and a throw blanket before Chris could even process the fact that I\u2019d rather sleep on the couch than in the same room as him. \u201cAll yours,\u201d I spit at him as I slammed the door behind me, hating myself for hoping he\u2019d feel half as alone as I did.</p><p>I didn\u2019t allow myself to let out all of my pent up emotion until I was in the living room and even then I prayed it was far enough from our bedroom that Chris couldn\u2019t hear how I screamed into a pillow, suddenly filled with more rage than anything. I was too mad to even cry. Mad at Chris and myself and the situation. I fell back on the couch, hoping I could go to sleep and forget about everything for at least a few hours, but I had no such luck.</p><p>Even as emotionally exhausted as I was, it seemed all I could do was stare at the ceiling. It felt wrong to fall asleep without the familiar feeling of Chris pressed against my back, our legs entwined. I could tell when he fell asleep when his breaths which always tickled my ear grew slower and softer. Knowing Chris was peacefully resting made it easier for me to sleep. How he always smelled, like clean laundry and a fresh shower and something else I could only describe as Chris, didn\u2019t hurt either. I laid there for hours, tossing and turning just like I did every night he was gone.</p><p>My ears perked up when I heard a door creak open from far away. In the quiet night, the feet padding down, slow with hesitation before gaining a sure speed, resonated through the otherwise empty house. My heart dropped as dealing with all of this became even more impending, but I couldn\u2019t ignore the butterflies that exploded in my stomach simultaneously.</p><p>I sat up when I heard the footsteps stop. Chris stood before me, rubbing his bicep nervously. His hair was in disarray like he\u2019d been running his hands through it more times than I could count. He had red, puffy eyes and tear-stained cheeks, which only made him look even more like a little boy who\u2019d stumbled into his parents\u2019 room after a nightmare. It broke my heart to know I\u2019d had a hand in this.</p><p>Chris started to speak, but his voice cracked so painfully he stopped to compose himself. Before he could try again and I could think about it, I stood and wrapped my arms around him so tightly I thought I\u2019d never be able to untangle myself from him. I didn\u2019t want to, either. Every concern about maintaining my pride or how angry I was fled my mind. I knew none of that mattered. At the end of the day, we just knew we needed each other.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before strong arms enveloped me, pulling my body into a familiar chest as I was wracked with sobs that finally escaped. It was like a dam broke, tears I\u2019d been holding in for so long just poured out of me in a massive wave. Chris took a seat on the couch and guided me with him, shushing me quietly while holding me tight. I sat in his lap, crying so hard I started to hiccup and hyperventilate. Chris only hugged me tighter, telling me to focus on his heartbeat and breathe with him. I tried and failed and finally, he just peppered the top of my head with gentle kisses and whispered apologies until I ran out of tears.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d I said quietly with an unsteady voice, careful not to speak too loudly in the dead of night. I don\u2019t know who I was nervous to disturb, it was just the two of us. The way it was supposed to be. Chris shrugged his strong shoulders, looking up at me through his dark lashes as he slumped into the couch.\u00a0\u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep without you,\u201d he whispered back to me like it was a secret only we could know. A silence stretched between us after that, neither of us too sure of what to say or where to start.<br></p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said that. I was way out of line,\u201d Chris said before pressing a long kiss to my forehead once I could catch my breath. I couldn\u2019t care about keeping up appearances anymore, we needed to be real with each other and actually talk this out. I tucked my head into the crook of Chris\u2019s neck, allowing myself to melt into his warmth. \u00a0\u201cIt was so wrong,\u201d I reiterated, my voice still shaking. Chris\u2019s chest shook with his chuckle, the deep vibration bringing me a comfort that was almost jarring. \u201cSo wrong,\u201d he repeated, rubbing calming circles on the small of my back.</p><p>\u201cI just have a hard time understanding you sometimes,\u201d he continued slowly, careful to choose the right words before concluding, \u201cthen I get upset with myself for it, but I shouldn\u2019t take that out on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d I reassured him, wiping the tears from under my chin. I re-positioned myself so I was facing Chris now. The pained look on his face made this more difficult, but there was something so entrancing about how the moonlight coming through the window played with the structured lines of his face. Chris looked soft and pretty, a welcomed contrast to the angry red he\u2019d been earlier. He looked like the Chris I knew and loved. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to communicate better instead of shutting down,\u201d I promised. Chris gave me a tight-lipped smile as he caressed my face, wiping my tears.</p><p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s really been on your mind,\u201d Chris whispered like he was testing the waters with more of an invitation than a demand. I swallowed my reservations, knowing that this was a safer space than the argument we\u2019d had before. Chris was genuinely all ears, I could tell by the patience he exuded.</p><p>\u201cYou know I love how much you love your work,\u201d I said as I looked him right in the eye, hoping he understood how honest I was. \u201cAnd I love your friends, too. I love that you have these things that make you so happy\u2026 I don\u2019t have a problem sharing you,\u201d I continued, averting my eyes to where my hands sat wringing in my lap.</p><p>Chris took notice and held my hands in his, rubbing small circles with his thumbs on my palms. I sighed, knowing he was trying to be understanding, but that meant I had to allow him to be. \u201cI just miss you so much when you\u2019re away and even when you\u2019re here it\u2019s like you aren\u2019t really with me.\u201d</p><p>Tears started slipping down my cheeks again. I watched as they dripped down my chin and fell on our hands. \u201cI-I feel like you don\u2019t want to be,\u201d I confessed. Before I finished saying the words, Chris pulled me into another hug. My cheek pressed against his chest, the steady thump of his heart and its movement with each of his breaths bringing me comfort. It reminded me that he was here with me, grounding me back to Earth.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Chris whispered, the conviction still evident in his voice. \u201cCouldn\u2019t be farther from the truth,\u201d he reassured me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I made you feel like that\u2026 I didn\u2019t even know you did.\u201d Chris pulled away from the hug, holding me at arm\u2019s length. He tilted my chin up so I looked at him and with the kind of intensity he had in his eyes it was hard to look away.</p><p>\u201cI love you more than anything,\u201d Chris declared like he was telling me the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, it was a fact of life. \u201cIt makes being away from you a hell of a lot harder than it\u2019s ever been for me before. I guess I was trying to distance myself to make it easier when I\u2019m gone,\u201d Chris sighed, running his fingers through his hair again. \u201cClearly doesn\u2019t work,\u201d he chuckled. I laughed too, for what felt like the first time in way too long.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like when we fight,\u201d I told him, playing with his fingers until they became laced together with mine. \u201cGee, no \u2018I love you too, light of my life?\u2019\u201d Chris poked fun at me. I rolled my eyes, but I wasn\u2019t really annoyed, probably given away by my goofy grin. \u201cYou know I do,\u201d I replied, leaning forward to place a kiss on his cheek, already itchy with stubble. When I pulled away, I saw Chris beaming at me with a smile from ear to ear and a light he\u2019d lost before back in his eye. With a voice that was still raspy from his tiredness, Chris said, \u201cI don\u2019t like it either.\u201d</p><p>He stood, pulling me by our locked-together hands so I\u2019d follow him. Chris swung our arms between us as he looked down at me with a kindness I\u2019d missed. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we get some sleep?\u201d he prompted, tugging us toward the hallway. I walked a little faster so our steps would be in sync, allowing me to cuddle up against his side until we climbed into bed, where we finally fell asleep in each other\u2019s arms.</p>",

One of his eyebrows hung a little lower than the other as Chris looked at me with a concentrated irritation and his mouth dangled open just enough to notice. &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; he asked in a tone that simply screamed he thought I was being ridiculous to be this upset about such a thing.</p><p>\tAlthough it was rhetorical, I answered anyway. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I shot back, crossing my own arms to show I was just as capable of sticking to my guns. Chris did this thing where he&rsquo;d make me feel irrational for being upset about something so trivial every time we argued. I don&rsquo;t think he meant to be so high and mighty, but being belittled was so frustrating when all I wanted was for him to take my feelings seriously.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I only went out for a beer with the boys. Sorry, I came home later than I said, sue me,&rdquo; Chris said with a shrug, puffing out his bottom lip in an attempt to be nonchalant. I wasn&rsquo;t going to let him brush it off that easy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about that, Chris,&rdquo; I sighed as my shoulders slumped, so defeated before the battle really began. I wished he could just know how I feel and why without these arguments that boil over into bigger fights so easily.</p><p>I was tired of it. Of all of the days spent without him while Chris was across the country working, all of the arguments we had over Skype, and the fights stemming from unresolved issues when he was finally home. I was tired of explaining myself to someone who made no attempts to understand.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just-&rdquo; I started anyway, my tone a little too shrill. Chris raised his eyebrows with a teasing encouragement as if he couldn&rsquo;t wait to see what came out of my mouth next. He stayed planted by the bathroom door, like a tree that would stubbornly stand tall in the face of a storm. Like a guy who would rather stand there than climb into bed next to me.</p><p>I cleared my throat and tried again, more conscious of the lump inside of it than ever. &ldquo;I rarely see you with how often you&rsquo;ve been working lately. And when you&rsquo;re here, you&rsquo;re barely even home,&rdquo; I concluded when my voice cracked. I wasn&rsquo;t going to cry- at least that&rsquo;s what I kept telling myself.</p><p>Chris&rsquo;s lips turned up in a smirk which felt more like a punch in the stomach. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry that I want to see my friends,&rdquo; he said sarcastically. I tried to breathe deeply, suppressing my desperate need to snap at him. If I was going to ask him to be more considerate, the least I could do was offer him the same. But he made that a hell of a lot easier said than done sometimes.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You know that isn&rsquo;t what I mean,&rdquo; I spoke through gritted teeth. Chris could tell he was really bothering me now, but that didn&rsquo;t stop him. &ldquo;What is it then, huh?&rdquo; he pressed. Chris put his hands on his hips and let his face adopt a look of concern as he feigned curiosity.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t respond, which wasn&rsquo;t because I didn&rsquo;t have anything to say to something so inane. I just had better things to focus on like holding in my tears, but Chris took it as an opportunity to keep pressing my buttons. &nbsp;&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t hold my work schedule against me. I told you I wouldn&rsquo;t be around and you signed up for this anyway,&rdquo; he reminded me as if that solved our problems. As if the fact that he was already some big famous actor when we met, something our entire relationship was built to cope with, could just casually slip my mind. As if I would laugh it off and say, &ldquo;Oh, yeah. Sorry, my bad.&rdquo;</p><p>Instead, I stared at him with tears welling up in my eyes. My bottom lip trembled as I tried to hold it together. Angry crying was the most aggravating thing. Chris always came back down to earth to comfort me and I felt guilty for some reason and our problem never got resolved since the fight was put on hold. I refused to let that happen this time. I tried to swallow the lump in my throat, which was growing into more of a boulder now. &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t what this is about Chris,&rdquo; I said lowly. I tried to sound stern, but it came out more like a plea.</p><p>Chris buried his face in his hands, his chest rising with each deep breath. &ldquo;Well, you aren&rsquo;t exactly telling me,&rdquo; he huffed with frustration. When he lifted his head, he looked absolutely done. His words hung in the thick air between us for a while, neither of us accepting defeat. I always struggled with finding the right words, especially when I was so upset. As exasperating as it was to feel like Chris didn&rsquo;t understand me, he was right to say I didn&rsquo;t explain myself well.</p><p>&ldquo;Look, if you&rsquo;re upset because I went out with my friends instead of staying here with you, I&rsquo;m not going to apologize for that,&rdquo; Chris finally said indignantly. I just looked at him with my mouth opening and closing like a fish out of water, knowing that if I spoke I would erupt into tears.</p><p>That only seemed to make Chris angrier. &ldquo;Dammit!&rdquo; he shouted, facing the wall instead of me. He slammed a hand against the wall, causing me to jump while the picture frames shook on their hooks. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair of you to bring up some fucking issue you have without even being able to say shit about it, you know that? I&rsquo;m not a mind reader,&rdquo; Chris yelled, whipping around to face me. His blue eyes were wide and full of emotion, trying to convey all of the feelings his words couldn&rsquo;t.</p><p>Still, I sat on our bed unable to say a word, painfully aware of how small I felt under his angry gaze. Chris ran a hand through his hair, trying to collect himself. He turned to face the wall again as if he couldn&rsquo;t even stand to look at me, but he spun again to look at me as he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what your problem is.&rdquo; Chris&rsquo;s nostrils flared as his voice started to rise again.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it that seeing other people makes you feel like you aren&rsquo;t enough for me? Or maybe it&rsquo;s because I have better things to do than tend to your every beck and call? I hate to break it to you darling, but you aren&rsquo;t the center of my entire fucking universe.&rdquo; Chris spoke with a resigned certainty as he spit the kind of words that hit you right where it hurts, the kind of hurt you don&rsquo;t forget. I knew I&rsquo;d always have that wildly vexed look in his eye, the way he sounded so dissatisfied with me, and the feeling of my heart dropping burned into my memory. I was my closest to crying then as the tears brimmed my eyes and threatened to fall despite my best efforts, but I refused to give Chris the satisfaction of knowing he&rsquo;d gotten to me.</p><p>It seemed Chris immediately regretted the words even as they left his lips. The vein bulging on his forehead seemed to fade away again as he took a few deep breaths, grappling to get back the temper he&rsquo;d lost. Chris averted his eyes to the floor, running a hand through his messy hair. This time, when he turned to the wall because he couldn&rsquo;t look at me, I knew it wasn&rsquo;t because he was angry. Chris was guilty. &ldquo;I just want to go to bed,&rdquo; he finally said, sounding so ragged I almost wanted to drop it. Still, he didn&rsquo;t make a move toward our bed.</p><p>But I knew if we did, it would be even more of a fight next time I was bothered enough to bring it up. &ldquo;I want to fix this,&rdquo; I challenged, gesturing to the space between us. It was only a few feet, but it felt like he was on Jupiter. I wanted Chris to sit down next to me and crack his knuckles, saying something about how we&rsquo;d have to get on with that then so we could both just be happy. Instead, he pinched the bridge of his nose again.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired,&rdquo; Chris sighed, making his choice. I hated wondering if he intended it in the sleepy kind of way or if he meant he was tired of me. Maybe bringing this up when he was tired and toeing the line between tipsy and drunk wasn&rsquo;t the best idea. Regardless, I couldn&rsquo;t stand being around him any longer. I stood quickly, snatching my pillow and a throw blanket before Chris could even process the fact that I&rsquo;d rather sleep on the couch than in the same room as him. &ldquo;All yours,&rdquo; I spit at him as I slammed the door behind me, hating myself for hoping he&rsquo;d feel half as alone as I did.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t allow myself to let out all of my pent up emotion until I was in the living room and even then I prayed it was far enough from our bedroom that Chris couldn&rsquo;t hear how I screamed into a pillow, suddenly filled with more rage than anything. I was too mad to even cry. Mad at Chris and myself and the situation. I fell back on the couch, hoping I could go to sleep and forget about everything for at least a few hours, but I had no such luck.</p><p>Even as emotionally exhausted as I was, it seemed all I could do was stare at the ceiling. It felt wrong to fall asleep without the familiar feeling of Chris pressed against my back, our legs entwined. I could tell when he fell asleep when his breaths which always tickled my ear grew slower and softer. Knowing Chris was peacefully resting made it easier for me to sleep. How he always smelled, like clean laundry and a fresh shower and something else I could only describe as Chris, didn&rsquo;t hurt either. I laid there for hours, tossing and turning just like I did every night he was gone.</p><p>My ears perked up when I heard a door creak open from far away. In the quiet night, the feet padding down, slow with hesitation before gaining a sure speed, resonated through the otherwise empty house. My heart dropped as dealing with all of this became even more impending, but I couldn&rsquo;t ignore the butterflies that exploded in my stomach simultaneously.</p><p>I sat up when I heard the footsteps stop. Chris stood before me, rubbing his bicep nervously. His hair was in disarray like he&rsquo;d been running his hands through it more times than I could count. He had red, puffy eyes and tear-stained cheeks, which only made him look even more like a little boy who&rsquo;d stumbled into his parents&rsquo; room after a nightmare. It broke my heart to know I&rsquo;d had a hand in this.</p><p>Chris started to speak, but his voice cracked so painfully he stopped to compose himself. Before he could try again and I could think about it, I stood and wrapped my arms around him so tightly I thought I&rsquo;d never be able to untangle myself from him. I didn&rsquo;t want to, either. Every concern about maintaining my pride or how angry I was fled my mind. I knew none of that mattered. At the end of the day, we just knew we needed each other.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t long before strong arms enveloped me, pulling my body into a familiar chest as I was wracked with sobs that finally escaped. It was like a dam broke, tears I&rsquo;d been holding in for so long just poured out of me in a massive wave. Chris took a seat on the couch and guided me with him, shushing me quietly while holding me tight. I sat in his lap, crying so hard I started to hiccup and hyperventilate. Chris only hugged me tighter, telling me to focus on his heartbeat and breathe with him. I tried and failed and finally, he just peppered the top of my head with gentle kisses and whispered apologies until I ran out of tears.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo; I said quietly with an unsteady voice, careful not to speak too loudly in the dead of night. I don&rsquo;t know who I was nervous to disturb, it was just the two of us. The way it was supposed to be. Chris shrugged his strong shoulders, looking up at me through his dark lashes as he slumped into the couch.&nbsp;&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t sleep without you,&rdquo; he whispered back to me like it was a secret only we could know. A silence stretched between us after that, neither of us too sure of what to say or where to start.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have said that. I was way out of line,&rdquo; Chris said before pressing a long kiss to my forehead once I could catch my breath. I couldn&rsquo;t care about keeping up appearances anymore, we needed to be real with each other and actually talk this out. I tucked my head into the crook of Chris&rsquo;s neck, allowing myself to melt into his warmth. &nbsp;&ldquo;It was so wrong,&rdquo; I reiterated, my voice still shaking. Chris&rsquo;s chest shook with his chuckle, the deep vibration bringing me a comfort that was almost jarring. &ldquo;So wrong,&rdquo; he repeated, rubbing calming circles on the small of my back.</p><p>&ldquo;I just have a hard time understanding you sometimes,&rdquo; he continued slowly, careful to choose the right words before concluding, &ldquo;then I get upset with myself for it, but I shouldn&rsquo;t take that out on you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault,&rdquo; I reassured him, wiping the tears from under my chin. I re-positioned myself so I was facing Chris now. The pained look on his face made this more difficult, but there was something so entrancing about how the moonlight coming through the window played with the structured lines of his face. Chris looked soft and pretty, a welcomed contrast to the angry red he&rsquo;d been earlier. He looked like the Chris I knew and loved. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to try to communicate better instead of shutting down,&rdquo; I promised. Chris gave me a tight-lipped smile as he caressed my face, wiping my tears.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me what&rsquo;s really been on your mind,&rdquo; Chris whispered like he was testing the waters with more of an invitation than a demand. I swallowed my reservations, knowing that this was a safer space than the argument we&rsquo;d had before. Chris was genuinely all ears, I could tell by the patience he exuded.</p><p>&ldquo;You know I love how much you love your work,&rdquo; I said as I looked him right in the eye, hoping he understood how honest I was. &ldquo;And I love your friends, too. I love that you have these things that make you so happy&hellip; I don&rsquo;t have a problem sharing you,&rdquo; I continued, averting my eyes to where my hands sat wringing in my lap.</p><p>Chris took notice and held my hands in his, rubbing small circles with his thumbs on my palms. I sighed, knowing he was trying to be understanding, but that meant I had to allow him to be. &ldquo;I just miss you so much when you&rsquo;re away and even when you&rsquo;re here it&rsquo;s like you aren&rsquo;t really with me.&rdquo;</p><p>Tears started slipping down my cheeks again. I watched as they dripped down my chin and fell on our hands. &ldquo;I-I feel like you don&rsquo;t want to be,&rdquo; I confessed. Before I finished saying the words, Chris pulled me into another hug. My cheek pressed against his chest, the steady thump of his heart and its movement with each of his breaths bringing me comfort. It reminded me that he was here with me, grounding me back to Earth.</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; Chris whispered, the conviction still evident in his voice. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t be farther from the truth,&rdquo; he reassured me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I made you feel like that&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t even know you did.&rdquo; Chris pulled away from the hug, holding me at arm&rsquo;s length. He tilted my chin up so I looked at him and with the kind of intensity he had in his eyes it was hard to look away.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you more than anything,&rdquo; Chris declared like he was telling me the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, it was a fact of life. &ldquo;It makes being away from you a hell of a lot harder than it&rsquo;s ever been for me before. I guess I was trying to distance myself to make it easier when I&rsquo;m gone,&rdquo; Chris sighed, running his fingers through his hair again. &ldquo;Clearly doesn&rsquo;t work,&rdquo; he chuckled. I laughed too, for what felt like the first time in way too long.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like when we fight,&rdquo; I told him, playing with his fingers until they became laced together with mine. &ldquo;Gee, no &lsquo;I love you too, light of my life?&rsquo;&rdquo; Chris poked fun at me. I rolled my eyes, but I wasn&rsquo;t really annoyed, probably given away by my goofy grin. &ldquo;You know I do,&rdquo; I replied, leaning forward to place a kiss on his cheek, already itchy with stubble. When I pulled away, I saw Chris beaming at me with a smile from ear to ear and a light he&rsquo;d lost before back in his eye. With a voice that was still raspy from his tiredness, Chris said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it either.&rdquo;</p><p>He stood, pulling me by our locked-together hands so I&rsquo;d follow him. Chris swung our arms between us as he looked down at me with a kindness I&rsquo;d missed. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we get some sleep?&rdquo; he prompted, tugging us toward the hallway. I walked a little faster so our steps would be in sync, allowing me to cuddle up against his side until we climbed into bed, where we finally fell asleep in each other&rsquo;s arms.</p>",
