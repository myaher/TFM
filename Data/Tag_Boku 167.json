It\u2019s finally complete and I hope you enjoy!!</p><p><br/></p><p>Todoroki:</p><p><br/></p><p>-Todoroki genuinely didn\u2019t know what to do! He usually was a cool, calm, collected person but seeing his S/O in a tiny child form from a stray quirk, they looked to be at least 5 years old.<b><br/></b></p><p>-\u201dPiggy back ride!\u201d His S/O asked cutely, arms stretching up to him. Todoroki obliged, the child version of S/O slinged happily upon his back, arms strung around his neck but, luckily it wasn\u2019t tight.</p><p>-Though how did one take care of a child? He didn\u2019t exactly have the best frame of reference due to his upbringing. Maybe a few google searches would help out. Though wikihow only helped so much.</p><p>-Todoroki\u2019s next idea was to then head back to the dorms, which he accomplished with a child S/O cheerfully singing atop his back.</p><p>-Next step was to feed them, since the whole walk to the dorms they complained about wanting for food. Though what do children eat? Do they eat special toddler food? Seconds later, S/O had their face full of cereal and Todoroki deemed it would be fine for them to eat since they weren\u2019t currently dying whilst eating.</p><p>-They then insisted on watching t.v. and Todoroki felt forced to comply when they shot his a pair of begging puppy eyes. S/O sweetly thanked him before leaning against him when they sat on the couch, their eyes seemingly getting heavier before they started to snore lightly.</p><p>-An action movie played in the background and Todoroki\u2019s thought that maybe having kids in the distant future may not be as bad as he once though it was.</p><p>-Before Todoroki knew it though, his lover turned back. Apologizing profusely for him having to take care of them. Though Todoroki smiled lightly before kissing them.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Uraraka:<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>-Uraraka prided herself on being good with children, since she used to babysit kids quite a bit. Though looking at a 5 year old version of her s/o was nothing that her babysitting skills could help with.<br/><br/>-Nervously she picked up her s/o in her arms, making sure to them tight since they were currently crying and a warm embrace fixed everything. First thing first was to head back to the dorms since the teachers would have a much better idea on how to take care of this situation then her.<br/><br/></p><p>-Since s/o kept weeping, Uraraka pulled out her wallet ad bought them an ice cream which rather quickly quieted before heading back to the dormitory<br/><br/>-\u201cThank you Urara! I love you!\u201d Their face covered in sticky ice cream, they nuzzled their face against Uraraka covering her in the sticky substance as well.<br/><br/>-Uraraka smiled \u201cLove you too. Now let\u2019s clean up, shall we?\u201d Ochaco ruffle their hair into a mess, giggling at their cute expression.<br/><br/>-To be honest after her initial nerves died down, she started to have fun with her s/o kid version. She took a ton of pictures as well to use to tease her lover when she went back to their normal age.<br/><br/>-Uraraka totally forgot about taking them to the dorms and decided she would go after a few more adventures with the child. The two strolled around the mall, with currently clean faces and happy smiles.<br/><br/>-Uraraka decided she might enjoy becoming a parent though would like her lover to turn back to their normal age and luckily that happened the next day!<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Midoriya:</p><p><br/></p><p>-How many panic attacks can one have when they look at their lover turned into a five year old. Many of them apparently. Midoriya held a tight grasp on their small hand as he felt ready to pass out.</p><p>-Was his lover stuck as a five year old forever? If not how long did the stray quirk last? Did they revert back to the mentality of a five year old or were they still as smart as a fifteen year old that was stuck in a much younger body? </p><p>-\u201dMidi you ramble!\u201d They laughed, and of course Midoriya said all of that out loud and a red blush crept up his freckled cheeks.</p><p>-Midoriya picked up his phone from his pocket and decided to dial Aizawa, since his teacher would most likely have the best course of action though he was just meet with a prerecorded message that went like this. \u201cI\u2019m not responding to any of my students since Ashido decided to prank call me in the dead of the night. Look if it\u2019s an emergency, call All Might or my private phone number. I swear Ashido if you dial my private number, I will consider expelling you and make you write a 100 page essay on why you shouldn\u2019t prank call people. Goodbye.\u201d</p><p>-After that message, Midoriya decided to hold off on calling his teacher since he sounded extremely tired in the message. Picking up S/O in his arms, he forced an awkward smile \u201cI guess it\u2019s just me and you.\u201d</p><p>-Their face lit up and the brightest smile was painted atop their lips \u201cYay, yay! We should get katsu, katsu.\u201d Midoriya was quickly able to translate their sentence and they clearly desired to have katusdon, one of Midoriya\u2019s favorite foods.</p><p>-Nervously they entered a restaurant and ordered their food,their face then proceed to be covered in food and Midoriya quickly wiped it off. Then suddenly poof! A cloud of smoke and they were back to their original form.</p><p>-\u201dYou\u2019ll be a great father, Izuku!\u201d And Midoriya then proceeded to turn as bright as a cherry and used his arms to cover his face.</p><p><br/></p><p>I hope you enjoyed and have a great day!</p><p>Ophelia</p>",

                "content": "<p>Sorry this took so long to post!!! It&rsquo;s finally complete and I hope you enjoy!!</p><p><br /></p><p>Todoroki:</p><p><br /></p><p>-Todoroki genuinely didn&rsquo;t know what to do! He usually was a cool, calm, collected person but seeing his S/O in a tiny child form from a stray quirk, they looked to be at least 5 years old.<b><br /></b></p><p>-&rdquo;Piggy back ride!&rdquo; His S/O asked cutely, arms stretching up to him. Todoroki obliged, the child version of S/O slinged happily upon his back, arms strung around his neck but, luckily it wasn&rsquo;t tight.</p><p>-Though how did one take care of a child? He didn&rsquo;t exactly have the best frame of reference due to his upbringing. Maybe a few google searches would help out. Though wikihow only helped so much.</p><p>-Todoroki&rsquo;s next idea was to then head back to the dorms, which he accomplished with a child S/O cheerfully singing atop his back.</p><p>-Next step was to feed them, since the whole walk to the dorms they complained about wanting for food. Though what do children eat? Do they eat special toddler food? Seconds later, S/O had their face full of cereal and Todoroki deemed it would be fine for them to eat since they weren&rsquo;t currently dying whilst eating.</p><p>-They then insisted on watching t.v. and Todoroki felt forced to comply when they shot his a pair of begging puppy eyes. S/O sweetly thanked him before leaning against him when they sat on the couch, their eyes seemingly getting heavier before they started to snore lightly.</p><p>-An action movie played in the background and Todoroki&rsquo;s thought that maybe having kids in the distant future may not be as bad as he once though it was.</p><p>-Before Todoroki knew it though, his lover turned back. Apologizing profusely for him having to take care of them. Though Todoroki smiled lightly before kissing them.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Uraraka:<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>-Uraraka prided herself on being good with children, since she used to babysit kids quite a bit.
