Ryan and I met our newborn niece, Callie!\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_4351.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83943\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_4351-1024x1018.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"488\" height=\"486\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_4351-1024x1018.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_4351-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_4351-300x298.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_4351-768x764.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_4351.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 488px) 100vw, 488px\"/></a></p>\n<p>Callie is absolutely perfect and meeting my sister and brother-in-law\u2019s daughter filled my heart right up. Callie is a bundle of love with constantly-kicking feet and a full head of soft dark hair. She has perfectly wrinkly newborn skin, pouty pink lips and beautiful eyes that somehow simultaneously seem brown and blue. And there\u2019s no denying that so far she seems to be the spitting image of her father.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_4344.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83942\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_4344-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"566\" height=\"424\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_4344-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_4344-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_4344-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_4344.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px\"/></a></p>\n<p>As you may be able to tell from the photos we have of Callie this weekend, she is currently receiving some extra care in the NICU. She\u2019s a strong little girl with the most loving parents and we know she\u2019s in the very best hands with a wonderful team of nurses and doctors watching over her.</p>\n<p>We spent as much time as possible in the NICU with Callie this weekend and timed a lot of our visits with her feeds so we could see her when she was awake. There\u2019s something about the way Callie looks at you that makes you feel like she\u2019s really trying to soak in her surroundings and she seems like the most observant little girl.</p>\n<p>During one visit, I said something to one of the NICU nurses about Callie being a sweet but feisty little girl and she replied, \u201cOh yes, she\u2019s got some feistyness in her, which is what we like to see in here!\u201d I absolutely cannot wait to watch Callie grow and see her personality come out more and more!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1408.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83938\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1408-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"380\" height=\"507\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1408-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1408-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1408.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px\"/></a></p>\n<p>My parents were so wonderfully helpful with Ryder and Chase this weekend which allowed us the opportunity to spend as much time as possible at the hospital. I also took full advantage of any moment I had to sit with Leslie in the NICU whenever she wanted company (there is a two-person limit at Callie\u2019s bedside) and while I was not permitted to hold Callie yet (the hospital\u2019s policy limits this to parents and grandparents to limit germs around the babies), seeing her in my sister\u2019s arms was almost more special to me because I saw Leslie step perfectly into her new role as Callie\u2019s mother. There is no denying the fact that Callie already knows her mother and responds to her mama\u2019s soothing voice and nurturing touch.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_4329.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83941\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_4329-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"394\" height=\"525\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_4329-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_4329-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_4329.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 394px) 100vw, 394px\"/></a></p>\n<p>Over the course of the weekend, Ryan said that spending time in a hospital is like some weird time warp where you lose all track of time and Leslie and I completely agreed. Our time in Florida passed by in a bit of a blur and I\u2019m already dying for another visit! I\u2019m so glad we were able to make the trip to Jacksonville and spend time with the newest addition to our family. We love you so much, Callie!</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>During our time in Florida, we also managed to celebrate Ryan\u2019s birthday! My mom and Chase made a Funfetti cake for Ryan when we were at the hospital and surprised him with a mini birthday party after dinner on Friday night.</p>\n<p>Chase mentioned the dinosaur socks he picked out for Dad no less than three times before Ryan opened his present from Chase but he was somehow still miraculously surprised with his gift from his T-Rex-loving son.</p>\n<p>The 6+ hour drive to and from Jacksonville went surprisingly well both ways. During the trip down to Florida, Chase slept for all of 15 minutes (we left at 6 p.m. and didn\u2019t arrive until nearly 1 a.m.) but somehow he was in the best mood the whole time. Ryan joked and said <em>of course</em> Chase was in a great mood \u2014 he had 5+hours of undivided Mom attention after I crawled into the backseat and hung out between Chase and Ryder.</p>\n<p>The ride home was a little more restful for both boys. Ryder slept (off and on) for the majority of the drive and Chase kicked off our trip home with a 90-minute nap. Once Chase was awake, we spent a large portion of the drive back to Charlotte playing with a new sticker activity book (he\u2019s obsessed with the animal ones from <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2PjFDw4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Geographic</a>) and watched a few \u201cTop 10\u201d videos on YouTube about sharks and dinosaurs.</p>\n<p>From the front seat, Ryan asked us to turn up the volume on the videos because the facts were oddly interesting! Did you know that one of the top 10 largest dinosaurs (the\u00a0Paralititan) was discovered in 2001!? That\u2019s like\u00a0<em>yesterday</em>! (Okay, maybe not yesterday, but I refuse to believe Y2K was almost 20 years ago.) I don\u2019t know about you, but I thought all of the dinosaurs were discovered much longer ago than 2001.</p>\n<p>And now that I\u2019ve given you a little nugget of dinosaur knowledge that you definitely didn\u2019t need to know, I\u2019m off to tackle this Monday! I have a deadline for an upcoming campaign to work on and need to play catch up a bit since I neglected almost all work over the weekend.</p>\n<p>I hope you guys have a great week!

I don\u2019t know about you, but I thought all of the dinosaurs were discovered much longer ago than 2001.</p>\n<p>And now that I\u2019ve given you a little nugget of dinosaur knowledge that you definitely didn\u2019t need to know, I\u2019m off to tackle this Monday! I have a deadline for an upcoming campaign to work on and need to play catch up a bit since I neglected almost all work over the weekend.</p>\n<p>I hope you guys have a great week!

Callie is a bundle of love with constantly-kicking feet and a full head of soft dark hair. She has perfectly wrinkly newborn skin, pouty pink lips and beautiful eyes that somehow simultaneously seem brown and blue. And there\u2019s no denying that so far she seems to be the spitting image of her father.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_4344.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83942\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_4344-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"566\" height=\"424\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_4344-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_4344-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_4344-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_4344.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px\"></a></p>\n<p>As you may be able to tell from the photos we have of Callie this weekend, she is currently receiving some extra care in the NICU. She\u2019s a strong little girl with the most loving parents and we know she\u2019s in the very best hands with a wonderful team of nurses and doctors watching over her.</p>\n<p>We spent as much time as possible in the NICU with Callie this weekend and timed a lot of our visits with her feeds so we could see her when she was awake. There\u2019s something about the way Callie looks at you that makes you feel like she\u2019s really trying to soak in her surroundings and she seems like the most observant little girl.</p>\n<p>During one visit, I said something to one of the NICU nurses about Callie being a sweet but feisty little girl and she replied, \u201cOh yes, she\u2019s got some feistyness in her, which is what we like to see in here!\u201d I absolutely cannot wait to watch Callie grow and see her personality come out more and more!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1408.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83938\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1408-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"380\" height=\"507\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1408-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1408-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1408.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px\"></a></p>\n<p>My parents were so wonderfully helpful with Ryder and Chase this weekend which allowed us the opportunity to spend as much time as possible at the hospital. I also took full advantage of any moment I had to sit with Leslie in the NICU whenever she wanted company (there is a two-person limit at Callie\u2019s bedside) and while I was not permitted to hold Callie yet (the hospital\u2019s policy limits this to parents and grandparents to limit germs around the babies), seeing her in my sister\u2019s arms was almost more special to me because I saw Leslie step perfectly into her new role as Callie\u2019s mother. There is no denying the fact that Callie already knows her mother and responds to her mama\u2019s soothing voice and nurturing touch.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_4329.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83941\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_4329-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"394\" height=\"525\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_4329-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_4329-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_4329.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 394px) 100vw, 394px\"></a></p>\n<p>Over the course of the weekend, Ryan said that spending time in a hospital is like some weird time warp where you lose all track of time and Leslie and I completely agreed. Our time in Florida passed by in a bit of a blur and I\u2019m already dying for another visit! I\u2019m so glad we were able to make the trip to Jacksonville and spend time with the newest addition to our family. We love you so much, Callie!</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>During our time in Florida, we also managed to celebrate Ryan\u2019s birthday! My mom and Chase made a Funfetti cake for Ryan when we were at the hospital and surprised him with a mini birthday party after dinner on Friday night.</p>\n<p>Chase mentioned the dinosaur socks he picked out for Dad no less than three times before Ryan opened his present from Chase but he was somehow still miraculously surprised with his gift from his T-Rex-loving son.</p>\n<p>The 6+ hour drive to and from Jacksonville went surprisingly well both ways. During the trip down to Florida, Chase slept for all of 15 minutes (we left at 6 p.m. and didn\u2019t arrive until nearly 1 a.m.) but somehow he was in the best mood the whole time. Ryan joked and said <em>of course</em> Chase was in a great mood \u2014 he had 5+hours of undivided Mom attention after I crawled into the backseat and hung out between Chase and Ryder.</p>\n<p>The ride home was a little more restful for both boys. Ryder slept (off and on) for the majority of the drive and Chase kicked off our trip home with a 90-minute nap. Once Chase was awake, we spent a large portion of the drive back to Charlotte playing with a new sticker activity book (he\u2019s obsessed with the animal ones from <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2PjFDw4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Geographic</a>) and watched a few \u201cTop 10\u201d videos on YouTube about sharks and dinosaurs.</p>\n<p>From the front seat, Ryan asked us to turn up the volume on the videos because the facts were oddly interesting!
