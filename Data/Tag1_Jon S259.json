        "body": "<p>October 11, 2018</p><p>This is a brief preview of a section of the \u00a0essay about Florian and Jonquil that I\u2019m currently writing. \u00a0This topic has been on my list of metas to write for a while and there are about 3 - 4 others I had plans to write before this one. However, the release of the <i>Fire and Blood </i>excerpt that dealt with Good Queen Alysanne\u2019s visit to the North was the impetus for me to move this topic to the top of the list. \u00a0This is because of the mention of Jonquil Darke, the <i>Scarlet Shadow</i> provided some clues to the original Jonquil and I decided now was a good time to get to it while things were percolating in my brain..</p><p>I am super excited to read the Alysanne chapter in its entirety when the book comes out next month because I\u2019m sure it will provide many additional clues to the storylines for Sansa and many of the other characters. \u00a0I\u2019m additionally glad George released the excerpt because as I said, it made me start on my Florian and Jonquil essay and it was in doing some research on the subject that I got caught up in reading<i>The Hedge Knight</i> again. \u00a0</p><p>I\u2019ve used quotes from the book here and there in some of my essays but I haven\u2019t read the story itself in a while. \u00a0The Dunk and Egg novellas are some of the most enjoyable stories of the series and I highly recommend reading them. \u00a0And so it \u00a0was as I was sitting on the train last night and reading <i>The Hedge Knight</i> during my commute that a clue to one of my theories jumped out at me from one of the drawings.</p><p>If you have read my <a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/166683154156/of-sansa-stark-the-glass-menagerie-the-rose-of-sharon-jo\" target=\"_blank\">Of Stark and the Glass Menagerie</a> essay, you are aware of my theory that the famous Blue Winter Rose is actually the jonquil flower. \u00a0There are several reasons for this theory not the least being that the modern rose is a cultivated flower that did not exist during the middle ages or more ancient times. \u00a0However, the jonquil flower did and it was considered by many to be a wild rose. \u00a0In fact many scholars believe that the narcissus-jonquilla is actually the Rose of Sharon flower referenced in the famous biblical poem, <i><b><a href=\"https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-song-of-songs/\" target=\"_blank\">Song of Solomon</a></b></i>.\u00a0 Here is the passage in question.</p><blockquote><p>Female</p><p><b><i>I am the rose of Sharon,<br/>\nand the lily of the valleys. </i><br/></b></p><p>Male</p><p><i>As the lily among thorns,<br/>\nso is my love among the daughters. </i></p></blockquote><p>It is my theory that while the blue winter rose Dany saw in the chink in the wall tips to Lyanna as Jon\u2019s mother, in the story proper, it is more indicative of Sansa Stark, her importance to the story; connection to Jon Snow; and their future relationship.</p><p>I think that hints of this relationship is there in many of the ancient tales because just as George uses the story proper to provide clues to the stories of the past, he also \u00a0uses the tales and songs of times past as hints to the current story. \u00a0He also makes heavy use of comparative mythology to tell his story and this is a topic I will cover a bit more in the full essay. \u00a0One such ancient tale that I think Martin uses to strongly denote things to come in the books is the story about Florian and Jonquil. </p><p>Any how, there I was last night sitting on the train, getting lost in the adventures of Dunk and Egg when suddenly a drawing of Florian and Jonquil jump out at me. \u00a0I\u2019ve seen this drawing a million times and yet there is something about the image that I never noticed until last night. \u00a0</p><p>Those of you familiar with the Dunk and Egg stories will know that black and white line drawings are included throughout. \u00a0These drawings showcase various scenes from the books. \u00a0The image of which I speak appears in the chapter where Dunk speaks to Tanselle Too-Tall for the first time. \u00a0It comes up just after Dunk and Egg have watched her perform her puppet show about Florian and Jonquil.</p><p>As I stated, the drawings in the books <b>always</b> showcase the dialogue or description of the scene in which they appear and I am positive that George approved all of them in advance. \u00a0During the puppet show, Florian is described as kneeling to Jonquil and that is the scene shown in the drawing. Here is the image in question.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1080\" data-orig-height=\"867\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dcfae98de22e2e880390985e6affe4f2/tumblr_inline_pggrd967en1scj86c_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1080\" data-orig-height=\"867\"/></figure><p>\u00a0Did you see it?</p><p>Look at what is laying on the ground in the scene. \u00a0A FREAKING ROSE! \u00a0Now believe me when I tell you that at no point during the puppet show and Dunk\u2019s mental voice over of what is happening is a rose mentioned. \u00a0And yet, there is one shown in the drawing. \u00a0Why is it there? \u00a0To me, this absolutely shows that the rose connects to the story of Florian and Jonquil.\u00a0 There are two iconic flowers in the story and how interesting is it that both connect to daughters of House Stark. \u00a0</p><p>When I refer to the jonquil as an iconic flower in the story it is not to say that the actual flower appears in the tale. \u00a0What I mean is that jonquil is the name of a flower and in the story it is associated with one person only and that is Sansa Stark. \u00a0So what do you think the odds are that two flowers strongly associated with the daughters of the most important family in the story are different totally different sweet smelling blooms? \u00a0I say little to none. \u00a0You can look at it as either the jonquil is the blue winter rose or the blue winter rose is the jonquil flower. \u00a0Same difference!</p><p>So we come to the end of my preview chapter. \u00a0In the full essay series, I will be piecing together the many hints in the story that tie Florian to Jon and Jonquil to Sansa and their future story tightly together. \u00a0If you look closely, you will see that George has actually dropped a lot of clues about the story of Florian and Jonquil. \u00a0I will also be discussing Martin\u2019s use of comparative mythology because it\u2019s really interesting and I think a very important part of the story. \u00a0</p>",

However, the release of the <i>Fire and Blood </i>excerpt that dealt with Good Queen Alysanne\u2019s visit to the North was the impetus for me to move this topic to the top of the list. \u00a0This is because of the mention of Jonquil Darke, the <i>Scarlet Shadow</i> provided some clues to the original Jonquil and I decided now was a good time to get to it while things were percolating in my brain..</p><p>I am super excited to read the Alysanne chapter in its entirety when the book comes out next month because I\u2019m sure it will provide many additional clues to the storylines for Sansa and many of the other characters. \u00a0I\u2019m additionally glad George released the excerpt because as I said, it made me start on my Florian and Jonquil essay and it was in doing some research on the subject that I got caught up in reading<i>The Hedge Knight</i> again. \u00a0</p><p>I\u2019ve used quotes from the book here and there in some of my essays but I haven\u2019t read the story itself in a while. \u00a0The Dunk and Egg novellas are some of the most enjoyable stories of the series and I highly recommend reading them. \u00a0And so it \u00a0was as I was sitting on the train last night and reading <i>The Hedge Knight</i> during my commute that a clue to one of my theories jumped out at me from one of the drawings.</p><p>If you have read my <a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/166683154156/of-sansa-stark-the-glass-menagerie-the-rose-of-sharon-jo\" target=\"_blank\">Of Stark and the Glass Menagerie</a> essay, you are aware of my theory that the famous Blue Winter Rose is actually the jonquil flower. \u00a0There are several reasons for this theory not the least being that the modern rose is a cultivated flower that did not exist during the middle ages or more ancient times. \u00a0However, the jonquil flower did and it was considered by many to be a wild rose. \u00a0In fact many scholars believe that the narcissus-jonquilla is actually the Rose of Sharon flower referenced in the famous biblical poem, <i><b><a href=\"https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-song-of-songs/\" target=\"_blank\">Song of Solomon</a></b></i>.\u00a0 Here is the passage in question.</p><blockquote><p>Female</p><p><b><i>I am the rose of Sharon,<br>\nand the lily of the valleys. </i><br></b></p><p>Male</p><p><i>As the lily among thorns,<br>\nso is my love among the daughters. </i></p></blockquote><p>It is my theory that while the blue winter rose Dany saw in the chink in the wall tips to Lyanna as Jon\u2019s mother, in the story proper, it is more indicative of Sansa Stark, her importance to the story; connection to Jon Snow; and their future relationship.</p><p>I think that hints of this relationship is there in many of the ancient tales because just as George uses the story proper to provide clues to the stories of the past, he also \u00a0uses the tales and songs of times past as hints to the current story. \u00a0He also makes heavy use of comparative mythology to tell his story and this is a topic I will cover a bit more in the full essay. \u00a0One such ancient tale that I think Martin uses to strongly denote things to come in the books is the story about Florian and Jonquil. </p><p>Any how, there I was last night sitting on the train, getting lost in the adventures of Dunk and Egg when suddenly a drawing of Florian and Jonquil jump out at me. \u00a0I\u2019ve seen this drawing a million times and yet there is something about the image that I never noticed until last night. \u00a0</p><p>Those of you familiar with the Dunk and Egg stories will know that black and white line drawings are included throughout. \u00a0These drawings showcase various scenes from the books. \u00a0The image of which I speak appears in the chapter where Dunk speaks to Tanselle Too-Tall for the first time. \u00a0It comes up just after Dunk and Egg have watched her perform her puppet show about Florian and Jonquil.</p><p>As I stated, the drawings in the books <b>always</b> showcase the dialogue or description of the scene in which they appear and I am positive that George approved all of them in advance. \u00a0During the puppet show, Florian is described as kneeling to Jonquil and that is the scene shown in the drawing. Here is the image in question.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1080\" data-orig-height=\"867\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dcfae98de22e2e880390985e6affe4f2/tumblr_inline_pggrd967en1scj86c_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1080\" data-orig-height=\"867\"></figure><p>\u00a0Did you see it?</p><p>Look at what is laying on the ground in the scene. \u00a0A FREAKING ROSE! \u00a0Now believe me when I tell you that at no point during the puppet show and Dunk\u2019s mental voice over of what is happening is a rose mentioned. \u00a0And yet, there is one shown in the drawing. \u00a0Why is it there? \u00a0To me, this absolutely shows that the rose connects to the story of Florian and Jonquil.\u00a0 There are two iconic flowers in the story and how interesting is it that both connect to daughters of House Stark. \u00a0</p><p>When I refer to the jonquil as an iconic flower in the story it is not to say that the actual flower appears in the tale. \u00a0What I mean is that jonquil is the name of a flower and in the story it is associated with one person only and that is Sansa Stark. \u00a0So what do you think the odds are that two flowers strongly associated with the daughters of the most important family in the story are different totally different sweet smelling blooms? \u00a0I say little to none. \u00a0You can look at it as either the jonquil is the blue winter rose or the blue winter rose is the jonquil flower. \u00a0Same difference!</p><p>So we come to the end of my preview chapter. \u00a0In the full essay series, I will be piecing together the many hints in the story that tie Florian to Jon and Jonquil to Sansa and their future story tightly together. \u00a0If you look closely, you will see that George has actually dropped a lot of clues about the story of Florian and Jonquil. \u00a0I will also be discussing Martin\u2019s use of comparative mythology because it\u2019s really interesting and I think a very important part of the story. \u00a0</p>",
