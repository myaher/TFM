The people dancing around you looked like they were having a good time, but you weren&amp;rsquo;t having fun. The whole night you were looking at him. Waiting. Waiting for him to make a move on you, but he never did. You danced, making eye contact with him every now and again. Usually, when you sway your hips and make eye contact with a guy, they get the hint that you want to talk to them. But not with him.\u00a0</p><p>You see him around quite often, he&amp;rsquo;s always with his friend who you know slightly better, Niall. He introduced him to you once, but you can&rsquo;t quite remember his name. Henry? Harry?</p><p>As you get tired of dancing, you find yourself sat on the couch. He was sitting across the room with Niall. They were talking to each other, but neither seemed too involved in their conversation. You were sitting there talking to your friend, well she was talking to you, and you just nod your head at what she had to say. </p><p>Your friend then pauses and looks directly behind you,\u00a0\u201cThat cute guy is coming over here\u201d she says while fixing her hair. Finally, you thought, you would be able to talk to this guy, figure out his name. You turn to look at him but get disappointed when you see it is Niall who is walking over. You then look at his friend who is just sitting there tapping his foot, staring at you.\u00a0</p><p>Niall leans in to talk into your ear. \u201cCome with me?\u201d he says over the loud music. </p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d you quiz as you have no idea what this almost stranger wants with you. </p><p>\u201cUpstairs. Wanna talk to you\u201d his puts out his hand and you take it.\u00a0You watch his friend as you follow Niall up the stairs.\u00a0</p><p>He opens a door to a random bedroom and you walk in and sit on the bed. He sits down next to you, and there is a silence. He starts to speak, but before he can say anything, you interrupt him \u201cNiall you seem like a really nice guy and all, but I&amp;rsquo;m just not into you like that\u201d you say before he can say something which will lead to you having to awkwardly turn him down. He stares at you blankly. \u201cWhat?\u201d you say confusedly. </p><p>He giggles a little and says \u201cY/N, I didn&amp;rsquo;t ask you to talk about that, I&amp;rsquo;m not interested in you either, I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re nice and all too. You know my friend Harry? Well, he really likes you\u201d he looks at you anticipating your reaction. </p><p>\u201cHarry! That's\u00a0his name, I knew it started with an H\u201d you laugh, to brush off the awkwardness.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy didn&amp;rsquo;t he just come and tell me himself?\u201d you question. </p><p>\u201cHe just gets really nervous around people he likes, so I thought I would be like his wingman, and ya know to get things moving along.\u201d You nod pretending to seem like that&amp;rsquo;s a normal thing people do.\u00a0</p><p>You follow Niall down the stairs back to the party, Harry isn&amp;rsquo;t where he was when you left. You stop at the end of the stars to look for him, \u201cWhere is he?\u201d you ask into Niall&rsquo;s ear as the music was loud again. </p><p>You spot him, he&amp;rsquo;s over in the kitchen getting another drink. From across the room, you make eye contact with him, but the vibe you get from him is different than before, he seems angry.</p><p>You make your way through the people to him. \u201cHi!\u201d you say friendly to him. He just picks up his cup and leans against the bench with a plain look on his face. He nods up as a way to acknowledge you. Why was he being so standoffish? He liked you right? Maybe this was his way of dealing with his nerves.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d you ask him, walking closer to him. He stiffens and moves backs bit. \u201cI&amp;rsquo;m perfect.\u201d he snaps. \u201cNever been better\u201d his tone is sarcastic. </p><p>\u201cGeese! What&amp;rsquo;s your problem?\u201d you say to him, feeling a hurt that he was acting so rude to you. </p><p>\u201cWhat&amp;rsquo;s my problem? You make eyes at me all night, then follow my best friend upstairs to \u2018fool&amp;rsquo; around, then you come back down looking all smug, and have the nerve to come over and be all flirty with me? Quite a game your playing Y/N.\u201d he pretty much yells at you.</p><p>You just laugh, he totally has the wrong side of the story. \u201cHarry&hellip; Niall took me upstairs to tell me how you feel about me! I don&amp;rsquo;t even like him!! I like yooouuu\u201d you say pushing him playfully, you laugh even more as his face completely changes. \u201cI thought you knew that&amp;rsquo;s what Niall was doing?\u201d you say. \u201cThat&rsquo;s why I was smiling and looking \u2018smug&amp;rsquo; because I was happy you felt the same way\u201d He looks confused.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou- you like me?\u201d he says with doubt in his voice.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs&amp;rsquo;nt that what I just said?

I really like you\u201d he says putting his hand on yours to stop you putting your shirt back on. \u201cWe can still fool around, just not sex,\u201d he says staring deeply into your eyes. \u201cYet.\u201d he adds.\u00a0</p><p>You bite your lip and turn to him, you glance down at his pants that are even tighter than they were before.</p><p>You admire him, any guy would probably not have the self-control to wait, especially when you were so down for it. \u201cOkay, let me help you out with your situation,\u201d you say bring your hand to slowly feel the tight spot in his pants. He just nods. You unbuckle his belt and slowly pull down his fly. He helps by taking his pants off, leaving him in his boxers. His length was able to rise more as his boxers were less tight than his jeans. You pull down his boxers and drop to your knees. His dick springs free. You smile up at him licking your lips.</p>",

He groans as your grinding right on the tight part of his pants.</p><p>\u201cY-y/n,\u201d he says between kisses, \u201c I- I don&amp;rsquo;t usually\u2026 Things don&amp;rsquo;t usually happen this quickly\u201d he says looking shy. </p><p>\u201cWe can take it a bit slower?\u201d you say to him. \u201cAnything you want baby,\u201d you say going to kiss him again, he gets caught up in you again. You pull your shirt off revealing your lacy bra that pushes your boobs up perfectly. He stops and looks at you, you start kissing his neck down to the fabric of his shirt and you go to pull it off him.</p><p>Just as you throw it to the ground. He says \u201cI-I don&amp;rsquo;t really sleep with people after just meeting them\u201d You look at him in confusion. </p><p>\u201cBut we have met before? At your friend\u2019s party in the summer?\u201d you say going back to kiss him. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I know, I mean I don&amp;rsquo;t want to sleep with you right now\u201d He immediately regrets his words, it came out wrong.\u00a0</p><p>You give him a hurt look, and get off him. You sit at the edge of the bed, reaching to pick up your shirt. \u201cNo t-that\u2019s not what I meant, I want to sleep with you, I would love to,\u201d he says moving to sit next to you.</p><p>\u201cWhat I meant was, I would rather take you on a date first, you know? I really like you\u201d he says putting his hand on yours to stop you putting your shirt back on. \u201cWe can still fool around, just not sex,\u201d he says staring deeply into your eyes. \u201cYet.\u201d he adds.\u00a0</p><p>You bite your lip and turn to him, you glance down at his pants that are even tighter than they were before.</p><p>You admire him, any guy would probably not have the self-control to wait, especially when you were so down for it. \u201cOkay, let me help you out with your situation,\u201d you say bring your hand to slowly feel the tight spot in his pants. He just nods. You unbuckle his belt and slowly pull down his fly. He helps by taking his pants off, leaving him in his boxers. His length was able to rise more as his boxers were less tight than his jeans. You pull down his boxers and drop to your knees. His dick springs free. You smile up at him licking your lips.</p></p>",

The people dancing around you looked like they were having a good time, but you weren&amp;rsquo;t having fun. The whole night you were looking at him. Waiting. Waiting for him to make a move on you, but he never did. You danced, making eye contact with him every now and again. Usually, when you sway your hips and make eye contact with a guy, they get the hint that you want to talk to them. But not with him.&nbsp;</p><p>You see him around quite often, he&amp;rsquo;s always with his friend who you know slightly better, Niall. He introduced him to you once, but you can&rsquo;t quite remember his name. Henry? Harry?</p><p>As you get tired of dancing, you find yourself sat on the couch. He was sitting across the room with Niall. They were talking to each other, but neither seemed too involved in their conversation. You were sitting there talking to your friend, well she was talking to you, and you just nod your head at what she had to say. </p><p>Your friend then pauses and looks directly behind you,&nbsp;&ldquo;That cute guy is coming over here&rdquo; she says while fixing her hair. Finally, you thought, you would be able to talk to this guy, figure out his name. You turn to look at him but get disappointed when you see it is Niall who is walking over. You then look at his friend who is just sitting there tapping his foot, staring at you.&nbsp;</p><p>Niall leans in to talk into your ear. &ldquo;Come with me?&rdquo; he says over the loud music. </p><p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; you quiz as you have no idea what this almost stranger wants with you. </p><p>&ldquo;Upstairs. Wanna talk to you&rdquo; his puts out his hand and you take it.&nbsp;You watch his friend as you follow Niall up the stairs.&nbsp;</p><p>He opens a door to a random bedroom and you walk in and sit on the bed. He sits down next to you, and there is a silence. He starts to speak, but before he can say anything, you interrupt him &ldquo;Niall you seem like a really nice guy and all, but I&amp;rsquo;m just not into you like that&rdquo; you say before he can say something which will lead to you having to awkwardly turn him down. He stares at you blankly. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; you say confusedly. </p><p>He giggles a little and says &ldquo;Y/N, I didn&amp;rsquo;t ask you to talk about that, I&amp;rsquo;m not interested in you either, I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re nice and all too. You know my friend Harry? Well, he really likes you&rdquo; he looks at you anticipating your reaction. </p><p>&ldquo;Harry! That's&nbsp;his name, I knew it started with an H&rdquo; you laugh, to brush off the awkwardness.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&amp;rsquo;t he just come and tell me himself?&rdquo; you question. </p><p>&ldquo;He just gets really nervous around people he likes, so I thought I would be like his wingman, and ya know to get things moving along.&rdquo; You nod pretending to seem like that&amp;rsquo;s a normal thing people do.&nbsp;</p><p>You follow Niall down the stairs back to the party, Harry isn&amp;rsquo;t where he was when you left. You stop at the end of the stars to look for him, &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; you ask into Niall&rsquo;s ear as the music was loud again. </p><p>You spot him, he&amp;rsquo;s over in the kitchen getting another drink. From across the room, you make eye contact with him, but the vibe you get from him is different than before, he seems angry.</p><p>You make your way through the people to him. &ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; you say friendly to him. He just picks up his cup and leans against the bench with a plain look on his face. He nods up as a way to acknowledge you. Why was he being so standoffish? He liked you right? Maybe this was his way of dealing with his nerves.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; you ask him, walking closer to him. He stiffens and moves backs bit. &ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m perfect.&rdquo; he snaps. &ldquo;Never been better&rdquo; his tone is sarcastic. </p><p>&ldquo;Geese! What&amp;rsquo;s your problem?&rdquo; you say to him, feeling a hurt that he was acting so rude to you. </p><p>&ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s my problem? You make eyes at me all night, then follow my best friend upstairs to &lsquo;fool&amp;rsquo; around, then you come back down looking all smug, and have the nerve to come over and be all flirty with me? Quite a game your playing Y/N.&rdquo; he pretty much yells at you.</p><p>You just laugh, he totally has the wrong side of the story. &ldquo;Harry&hellip; Niall took me upstairs to tell me how you feel about me! I don&amp;rsquo;t even like him!! I like yooouuu&rdquo; you say pushing him playfully, you laugh even more as his face completely changes. &ldquo;I thought you knew that&amp;rsquo;s what Niall was doing?&rdquo; you say. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I was smiling and looking &lsquo;smug&amp;rsquo; because I was happy you felt the same way&rdquo; He looks confused.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You- you like me?&rdquo; he says with doubt in his voice.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Is&amp;rsquo;nt that what I just said? Why else would I be making eyes at you all night?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&nbsp;I&amp;rsquo;m so sorry for yelling at you, I was just upset that my best friend was &lsquo;hooking&amp;rsquo; up with the girl I liked, sorry for overreacting,&rdquo; he says apologetically. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey it&amp;rsquo;s ok, I probably would have acted the same if I saw someone I liked going upstairs with my best friend&rdquo; You then turn to the stairs and see Niall following your friend up the stairs. You both laugh together, and you scooch closer to him.&nbsp;</p><p>He puts his arm around you, and you start chatting. By the end of the night, you are getting along swimmingly. &ldquo;Want to get out of here?&rdquo; you say to him, to make the move. </p><p>&ldquo;Sure&rdquo; he says. You both hop into a taxi, as your both a bit too intoxicated to drive, Harry gives his address to the driver.</p><p>When you get back to his house, he opens the door. You walk in &ldquo;Nice place&rdquo; you say looking around. You put your bag down and kick off your shoes, you walk up to him and slowly take his coat off. As it drops to the floor, you kiss him slowly and softly. When you pull away from this kiss he stays there with his eyes shut. </p><p>&ldquo;D-do you want something to drink?&rdquo; he asks looking around to everything but you, avoiding eye contact as he tries to casually pull at the fabric of his pants. </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe after&hellip;&rdquo; you say in a sexy voice, you look down at his pants and smirk.&nbsp;</p><p>You grab his hand and pull him down the hallway into what you assume is his bedroom. You push him on to the bed and straddle him. You kiss him passionately, running your hands in his hair, his hands are around your back. You grind into his hips, to release some of the pressure you feel. He groans as your grinding right on the tight part of his pants.</p><p>&ldquo;Y-y/n,&rdquo; he says between kisses, &ldquo; I- I don&amp;rsquo;t usually&hellip; Things don&amp;rsquo;t usually happen this quickly&rdquo; he says looking shy. </p><p>&ldquo;We can take it a bit slower?&rdquo; you say to him. &ldquo;Anything you want baby,&rdquo; you say going to kiss him again, he gets caught up in you again.
