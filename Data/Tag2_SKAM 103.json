He need his mom in his life and want her in his life. he wouldn\u2019t be texting her otherwise.

Let\u2019s\u00a0 just be real for a second it\u2019s not uwu, soft to have mental disorder.. it\u2019s a struggle, it\u2019s something you have to learn to life with and you have to treat it as any other illness.

The reasons Lucas is feeling miserable again.. because he was told he was nothing to Eliott except a symptom..\u00a0 that\u2019s why he says it like that today.. that everything is shit because Eliott is bipolar because he thinks that is the reason they can never be together.. Lucas have had one of the scariest experiences in his life just a two days ago.. he has been scared to death for Eliott and told afterwards he means nothing to that person he has fallen so deeply in love.. It will take time him to clear his mind after that.. we should have mercy on him not to be able to handle it the best cinnamon roll way possible. Lucas has been struggling to handle his feels toward his mom and now he does that same with Eliott..he will read and hopefully be told by several people that MI is not obstacle to have a relationship.. and by time he will learn also that parents with MI can be good parents when they are stable, like my mom whom I love a lot &lt;3 She had her struggles when I was a teenager and she was not the best mom but it was not her fault and I\u2019m happy she\u00a0 did find the things that helped her and that she is in a good place now.\u00a0 And I think that is one of the important points why Isak\u2019s mom accepted him without questions when he came out and hopefully same will go with Lucas..

Lucas has been struggling to handle his feels toward his mom and now he does that same with Eliott..he will read and hopefully be told by several people that MI is not obstacle to have a relationship.. and by time he will learn also that parents with MI can be good parents when they are stable, like my mom whom I love a lot &lt;3 She had her struggles when I was a teenager and she was not the best mom but it was not her fault and I&rsquo;m happy she&nbsp; did find the things that helped her and that she is in a good place now.&nbsp; And I think that is one of the important points why Isak&rsquo;s mom accepted him without questions when he came out and hopefully same will go with Lucas.. Because everyone has held a prejudge against her and it was shown wrong. She is and can be the supportive parent that he needs the most in that moment.&nbsp;</p><p>I know this subject is a sensitive one. I know that it&rsquo;s easy to cancel Lucas or call him out after today but there are this place where he is right now and it&rsquo;s part because of his history we shouldn&rsquo;t forget.. also please don&rsquo;t understate the struggles of the kids whose parents haven&rsquo;t always been the most stable..the struggles Lucas has had.. Because he has been trying to deal a big things all alone for a long time.. and it is a long journey without right kind of support system I would know.. but he will get there I promise. I did too.&nbsp;</p>",

It\u2019s not that his sofa is uncomfortable but <i>he is uncomfortable. </i>Every time he closes his eyes, images of distant worried blue eyes, police cars, ambulances, and concerned parents, flash his mind. Thoughts that run too fast and too loud. Only one word in his thoughts is understandable: <i>Lucas. </i>Thinking about him doesn\u2019t calm him like before, instead, his mind\u00a0gets even faster and the pain grows bigger. What does Lucas think of him now? Does he hate him?</p><p>Maybe drawing\u00a0could calm him down but all his papers are filled with images of sad raccoons and hedgehogs and that didn\u2019t help. Maybe music. Music like the one Lucas played on his piano. The same piano that\u2019s now in his line of vision. He wishes his parents weren\u2019t sleeping in his bed, at least that room doesn\u2019t have a Lucas presence in every bit of it like the living room does.\u00a0</p><p>He thinks about the record player, but that carries too many memories and his body feels too heavy and too tired to get up. His phone becomes the last resort. The phone he has been avoiding ever since Lucas answered\u00a0his text. He opens the playlist of songs that remind him of his love, the same one he was going to show Lucas during the weekend that turned into a hospital bed, parents crying and more medication.\u00a0</p><p>His finger brushes over Alt-j\u2019s Nara and the song starts playing. He places the phone under his pillow and puts it on the lowest setting possible so his parents don\u2019t wake up. The lyrics make him hold his breath\u00a0<i>\u201cComes/Saut dans le vide, my lover/In my youth the greatest tide washed up my prize/You\u201d \u201cI&rsquo;ve discovered a man like no other man/I&rsquo;ve found a love to love like no other can\u201d</i>. It\u2019s like a love letter he would have written to Lucas. The song is no lullaby but is enough to make Eliott\u2019s thoughts slow down, so he puts the song on repeat. After the 10th time, his eyes finally start to feel heavy with only the thought of his lover in mind dozing him off to sleep.\u00a0</p>",
