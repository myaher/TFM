He had just one job, and that was to make sure to pack everything before they left for their trip to Morocco. The girls had been excited about some summer getaway trip to Morocco. And apparently, Yann and the boys were all going too. And so Lucas had no choice but to tag along. Especially when they told him, he could take his boyfriend, Eliott, and he immediately agreed as he realized the fantastic times he could have this summer with Eliott. Getting excited about the mere thought of the warm sunny beaches\u2014 laying there on the sand with Eliott as they would whisper soft romantic nonsense to each other and laugh until their lungs tighten from happiness as they immersed themselves in their bliss. And then eventually, the gang would gather around a massive bonfire with Lucas and Eliott being that couple that snuggles up together while feeding each other toasted s'mores. And when night finally falls, they would look up and stargaze and make-out with each other to their heart&rsquo;s content. </p><p>But now, the dream was shattered when Lucas found out he had forgotten where he had put Eliott&rsquo;s precious ring. No, no, not the skull one he&rsquo;s always wearing but another one. A plain silver looking one. Why was it so special? What was unique about it was the fact that it had Lucas&rsquo; name engraved inside the ring&rsquo;s inner wall. On the engravement reads, &rsquo;<i>Minute par minute. Je t'aime, Lucas</i>.&rsquo;</p><p>When Eliott had surprised him on their first anniversary with it, Lucas could barely stop himself from crying, and it was such a precious gift. And now Lucas has lost it! Lucas was close to having a panic attack when he hears Eliott finally arrives back to their apartment. Eliott worked on the mornings and afternoons, which was why he couldn&rsquo;t help finish packing today as it was his last day of work before he takes his mini vacation. Their flight leaves that night at 20:00, and it was currently 16:40. Lucas was so screwed! </p><p>&ldquo;Hello? Lucas? Are you ready to go yet?&rdquo; Came Eliott&rsquo;s voice from the front door room. Lucas was silent as a mouse. He didn&rsquo;t know what to do! His breathing was labored, and his body shook as he frantically tried to calm down but failed in the process as he slowly begins to spiral. How could I lose it? It&rsquo;s such a precious gift, and now he&rsquo;s probably missed it in the laundry mat they went together yesterday. Too busy kissing on the washing machines and goofing around to thoroughly check\u2014Or it could be in the pockets of\u2014ah fuck. </p><p>&ldquo;\u2014cas, Lucas? Hey, look at me! Are you okay?!&rdquo; Lucas didn&rsquo;t even realize he had stopped breathing until he looked up into those steel eyes that reflected him in their gaze. He lets out a sob that sounded so fragile even to his ears. Eliott immediately pulls him in for a tight embrace. After a few moments of rocking Lucas back and forth as he cooed him with soft, assuring words. Eliott loosened his hold and tried locking eyes with Lucas again. &ldquo;Baby, what&rsquo;s wrong? Please, you gotta tell me, yeah?&rdquo; Eliott proceeds to lean his forehead against Lucas&rsquo;, trying to soothe his trembling body and bring Lucas back to him. </p><p><i>Come back to me.</i></p><p>Lucas swallowed the lump in his throat and hesitantly stammered out, &ldquo;I\u2014I don&rsquo;t know where it is, Eli! That ring of ours! I&rsquo;ve lost it! I&rsquo;m such a\u2014I&rsquo;m so sorry\u2026&rdquo; Lucas&rsquo; voice died when he bravely peers up to look at Eliott and found nothing but relief appearing on Eliott&rsquo;s face and something else. Endearment? But why?</p><p>&ldquo;Putain! Lucas, I thought you had a panic attack. Don&rsquo;t scare me like that\u2026&rdquo; Eliott was trying to lighten up the mood but clears his throat when Lucas still had glassy eyes from crying earlier, looking lost. &ldquo;Wait, you&rsquo;re not mad? Wha\u2014&rdquo; Lucas was beyond confused. Eliott cuts in, &ldquo;Lucas, listen&hellip;I know how much you loved that ring, but honestly, it&rsquo;s fine. It&rsquo;s okay. I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll find it.&rdquo; </p><p>Elliott cradles Lucas&rsquo; face as he looked intensely into the younger boy&rsquo;s ocean eyes. &ldquo;The one I <i><b>cherish</b></i> most is right here.&rdquo; Lucas was pretty sure he stopped breathing altogether, rendering him speechless. His heart rate accelerated. Elliott continued softly, &ldquo;because no matter what happens, you&rsquo;re the one thing I can&rsquo;t lose.&rdquo; Eliott gently caresses his cheeks by wiping away the tears and look into his eyes to make sure his words got to Lucas before bringing his lips upon Lucas&rsquo;. Sealing it and soon, they were both devouring each other&rsquo;s mouths. Swallowing the breath between them and the tongues that explored playfully eventually became hungry and consumed them both.</p><p>Lucas got so caught in the moment that he had almost forgotten what they were talking about as Eliott lifted him by his thighs and proceeded to carry him to the kitchen counter all while they were kissing. Lucas could barely stop himself from moaning as their hips met with such friction as Eliott throws his shirt over his head, making his hair wilder than ever. &rsquo;<i>He can&rsquo;t be real,</i>&rsquo; thought Lucas. Eliott&rsquo;s chest was heaving as he was just as out of breath as Lucas. &rsquo;<i>And he&rsquo;s all mine</i>,&rsquo; Lucas thought possessively. But before he could do something about it, Lucas was the one first to break apart; his anxiety was still nagging him. Panting from Eliott sucking on his bottom lip, he brought his right hand on Eliott&rsquo;s heart to indicate for him to stop. Eliott was quick to react and immediately halted his hands from playing with Lucas&rsquo; waistband and looked into Lucas&rsquo; eyes for signs of discomfort and rejection. &ldquo;Are you okay? I still feel awful about\u2014&rdquo; Lucas murmured sadly but was shunned by Eliott&rsquo;s finger on his lips. &ldquo;Shhh, baby. It&rsquo;s really fine.&rdquo; Eliott reassures Lucas again by kissing him hard before breaking apart, leaving Lucas starstruck. &ldquo;But if you want to stop, I suppose we can start getting read\u2014&rdquo; Lucas shuts Eliott up by pulling him back, and Eliott laughs into their kiss as he continues to pepper kisses on Lucas&rsquo; neck and down to his stomach, going lower and lower&hellip;</p><p>&hellip; </p><p>They were going to be okay. The trip was going to be amazing, even if they were probably going to be late. Besides, who said Eliott couldn&rsquo;t get Lucas another ring. And maybe this time, it was to ask him a question.

But for now, Lucas and Eliott were content with their lives, to be there for each other, to be young and in love.</p><p>//</p><p>(Note: I&rsquo;m so sorry for the late submission but I hope this can make up for it! \u2764)  </p>",

No, no, no! Fuck!</i> Lucas\u2019 head was reeling from trying to recall where it is. </p><p>Lucas knew he was in big trouble now. He had just one job, and that was to make sure to pack everything before they left for their trip to Morocco. The girls had been excited about some summer getaway trip to Morocco. And apparently, Yann and the boys were all going too. And so Lucas had no choice but to tag along. Especially when they told him, he could take his boyfriend, Eliott, and he immediately agreed as he realized the fantastic times he could have this summer with Eliott. Getting excited about the mere thought of the warm sunny beaches\u2014 laying there on the sand with Eliott as they would whisper soft romantic nonsense to each other and laugh until their lungs tighten from happiness as they immersed themselves in their bliss. And then eventually, the gang would gather around a massive bonfire with Lucas and Eliott being that couple that snuggles up together while feeding each other toasted s'mores. And when night finally falls, they would look up and stargaze and make-out with each other to their heart\u2019s content. </p><p>But now, the dream was shattered when Lucas found out he had forgotten where he had put Eliott\u2019s precious ring. No, no, not the skull one he\u2019s always wearing but another one. A plain silver looking one. Why was it so special? What was unique about it was the fact that it had Lucas\u2019 name engraved inside the ring\u2019s inner wall. On the engravement reads, \u2019<i>Minute par minute. Je t'aime, Lucas</i>.\u2019</p><p>When Eliott had surprised him on their first anniversary with it, Lucas could barely stop himself from crying, and it was such a precious gift. And now Lucas has lost it! Lucas was close to having a panic attack when he hears Eliott finally arrives back to their apartment. Eliott worked on the mornings and afternoons, which was why he couldn\u2019t help finish packing today as it was his last day of work before he takes his mini vacation. Their flight leaves that night at 20:00, and it was currently 16:40. Lucas was so screwed! </p><p>\u201cHello? Lucas? Are you ready to go yet?\u201d Came Eliott\u2019s voice from the front door room. Lucas was silent as a mouse. He didn\u2019t know what to do! His breathing was labored, and his body shook as he frantically tried to calm down but failed in the process as he slowly begins to spiral. How could I lose it? It\u2019s such a precious gift, and now he\u2019s probably missed it in the laundry mat they went together yesterday. Too busy kissing on the washing machines and goofing around to thoroughly check\u2014Or it could be in the pockets of\u2014ah fuck. </p><p>\u201c\u2014cas, Lucas? Hey, look at me! Are you okay?!\u201d Lucas didn\u2019t even realize he had stopped breathing until he looked up into those steel eyes that reflected him in their gaze. He lets out a sob that sounded so fragile even to his ears. Eliott immediately pulls him in for a tight embrace. After a few moments of rocking Lucas back and forth as he cooed him with soft, assuring words. Eliott loosened his hold and tried locking eyes with Lucas again. \u201cBaby, what\u2019s wrong? Please, you gotta tell me, yeah?\u201d Eliott proceeds to lean his forehead against Lucas\u2019, trying to soothe his trembling body and bring Lucas back to him. </p><p><i>Come back to me.</i></p><p>Lucas swallowed the lump in his throat and hesitantly stammered out, \u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know where it is, Eli! That ring of ours! I\u2019ve lost it! I\u2019m such a\u2014I\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u201d Lucas\u2019 voice died when he bravely peers up to look at Eliott and found nothing but relief appearing on Eliott\u2019s face and something else. Endearment? But why?</p><p>\u201cPutain! Lucas, I thought you had a panic attack. Don\u2019t scare me like that\u2026\u201d Eliott was trying to lighten up the mood but clears his throat when Lucas still had glassy eyes from crying earlier, looking lost. \u201cWait, you\u2019re not mad? Wha\u2014\u201d Lucas was beyond confused. Eliott cuts in, \u201cLucas, listen\u2026I know how much you loved that ring, but honestly, it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find it.\u201d </p><p>Elliott cradles Lucas\u2019 face as he looked intensely into the younger boy\u2019s ocean eyes. \u201cThe one I <i><b>cherish</b></i> most is right here.\u201d Lucas was pretty sure he stopped breathing altogether, rendering him speechless. His heart rate accelerated. Elliott continued softly, \u201cbecause no matter what happens, you\u2019re the one thing I can\u2019t lose.\u201d Eliott gently caresses his cheeks by wiping away the tears and look into his eyes to make sure his words got to Lucas before bringing his lips upon Lucas\u2019. Sealing it and soon, they were both devouring each other\u2019s mouths. Swallowing the breath between them and the tongues that explored playfully eventually became hungry and consumed them both.</p><p>Lucas got so caught in the moment that he had almost forgotten what they were talking about as Eliott lifted him by his thighs and proceeded to carry him to the kitchen counter all while they were kissing. Lucas could barely stop himself from moaning as their hips met with such friction as Eliott throws his shirt over his head, making his hair wilder than ever. \u2019<i>He can\u2019t be real,</i>\u2019 thought Lucas. Eliott\u2019s chest was heaving as he was just as out of breath as Lucas. \u2019<i>And he\u2019s all mine</i>,\u2019 Lucas thought possessively. But before he could do something about it, Lucas was the one first to break apart; his anxiety was still nagging him. Panting from Eliott sucking on his bottom lip, he brought his right hand on Eliott\u2019s heart to indicate for him to stop. Eliott was quick to react and immediately halted his hands from playing with Lucas\u2019 waistband and looked into Lucas\u2019 eyes for signs of discomfort and rejection. \u201cAre you okay? I still feel awful about\u2014\u201d Lucas murmured sadly but was shunned by Eliott\u2019s finger on his lips. \u201cShhh, baby. It\u2019s really fine.\u201d Eliott reassures Lucas again by kissing him hard before breaking apart, leaving Lucas starstruck. \u201cBut if you want to stop, I suppose we can start getting read\u2014\u201d Lucas shuts Eliott up by pulling him back, and Eliott laughs into their kiss as he continues to pepper kisses on Lucas\u2019 neck and down to his stomach, going lower and lower\u2026</p><p>\u2026 </p><p>They were going to be okay. The trip was going to be amazing, even if they were probably going to be late. Besides, who said Eliott couldn\u2019t get Lucas another ring. And maybe this time, it was to ask him a question. A very crucial question. But for now, Lucas and Eliott were content with their lives, to be there for each other, to be young and in love.</p><p>//</p><p>(Note: I\u2019m so sorry for the late submission but I hope this can make up for it! \u2764)  </p></p>",
