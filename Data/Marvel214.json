The god of thunder is a \nhistorical figure, his name is elemental knowledge. He himself is \nemployed by S.H.I.E.L.D. during times of peace: he gives lectures on the\n Philosophy of War. A tall, bristly old man with sturdy shoulders and a \nconstant frown, both eyes pale blue, one scarred, sight unadmittedly \nweakening; hair trimmed at the bottom and in a pigtail on top, its \ncolour a mix of sandy and grey. Beard still yellow, kept short, missing \nin some subtle patches. Posture showing open disinterest towards the \npotential S.H.I.E.L.D. agents across him, all carefully selected, \npromising, healthy fledglings. <br/></p><!-- more --><p>He always sits on a human-sized chair \nhalf-facing the youngsters amounting to thirty or so, predominantly \nearthen inhabitants; and without using any of the equipment available, \nhe speaks to himself. His job is to speak about his experience. In an \neven, deeply humming voice, at an unsteady pace, he tells stories that \nare already described in textbooks, though not caring to stick to the \nway they&rsquo;ve altered the events during the course of history. For the \numpteenth time, he relates occasions the way he remembers: sometimes \nit&rsquo;s the truth, sometimes just a guess to fill in the holes and avoid \nhaving to admit that his memory is starting to lapse. As required, he \nadds his personal reflection. Thanos was a self-righteous fool, like \nanyone under the age of two thousand, himself included. The Fourth World\n War could have passed as no more than a scam: humanity&rsquo;s gullible, \npetty nature was what triggered the actual chain of events. (He believed\n for a while that the semi-transparent attempt at making a ruckus was in\n fact Loki&rsquo;s initiation, which was proven to be untrue later. Loki is \ndead for real.) Surtur&rsquo;s second reawakening might have been Thor&rsquo;s own \nfault, just as the textbooks say: he sought to find-&hellip;</p><p>He falls \nsilent today in the middle of this sentence because his look strays \ntowards the figure that snuck in a few seconds ago and stood by the back\n wall, apparently not intent to disturb the lecture. Lanky, dark, \nelegant, soundless, motionless, young. The god of thunder is unable to \npick up the thread of his thoughts and stop wondering who the newcomer \nis, even though it&rsquo;s not the first time (not even the hundredth) that he\n sees unignorable resemblance in a random figure passing through his \nlife. His eyes narrow in an attempt to see details better from the \nopposite end of the room, and that looks like he frowns at the visitor.</p><p>The\n young man seems to be most interested in the row of chairs on his left,\n but sensing the intent look, he can&rsquo;t entirely suppress a smile to \nhimself. He still waits patiently in his place.</p><p>However, Thor \ncan&rsquo;t find the way back to his whispering audience, as long as the \nwordless question keeps growing in his mind, pushing out everything \nelse. He stands up slowly, to get a better view, to invite the figure \ncloser. But before he could wave or utter anything, the man sighs \naudibly and walks up to him on his own. It takes a mere six steps, but \nit feels like a thousand lifetimes to Thor, who is eager to detect his \nmistake already, to find the differences, the unfamiliarity in the \nfacial features.</p><p>He finds none of those, and it unnerves him, hope\n and disbelief torment him in unison. His voice is cracked, dry, faint, \nwith some embarrassment mixing in as he asks:</p><p>&ldquo;Am I&hellip; hallucinating?&rdquo;</p><p>The\n man&rsquo;s hand holds his upper arm in encouragement. Thor stares at him \nopenly now; the teal eyes, shining shamefully bright and smiling, are \nthe same as they were back then on the Statesman, telling him the same \nthing.</p><p>Thor&rsquo;s eyes are shining, too, but not resembling a \nmidsummer&rsquo;s morning sky any more: more like a November afternoon. Well, \nhe&rsquo;s kind of at a disadvantage without sorcery to dress him all peachy, \nright? This vain old trickster still has it in himself to make the \neffort, even though he hasn&rsquo;t had the guts to appear sooner-</p><p>&ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; Thor asks then, torn between reproach and plea.</p><p>The steady gaze on him never falters during the answer.</p><p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t be here. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For this long? Why?&rdquo;</p><p>He\n can&rsquo;t help it.

If any post has a link in it, it won\u2019t appear in the search engine. Obviously others are saying it too but please if you see a fic/content you like the reblog it! It just became much harder for content creators to spread their work and this would help a lot! <b>You can find my Masterlist on my profile and the Whumptober Masterlist under series!</b></i></p><p><i><b><br/></b></i></p><hr><p>Peter shifted uncomfortably in his seat watching Tony from afar tinkering away on his latest project. His mentor was in own world, too focused on his task to notice his kid on verge of tears. Peter was fine with that, the last thing he wanted was Tony fretting over him. </p><p>A sharp pain came from his chest as adjusted his position. Hissing quietly Peter bit his tongue hard to keep himself from screaming. What he would give for his enhanced healing to speed up. </p><p>He gripped his jeans making sure not to touch his chest. It was tender, too tender. Any touch wanted to make him fall to the floor in pain. Hell, he could barely sit in a chair without feeling some pain. </p><p>A few broken ribs are what Peter figured he had. Last night he had a run in with the Scorpion and ended up getting his ass handed to him. He practically had to beg Karen not to call Tony. Sure he was in a bit of pain, but he simply figured a sleeping it off would help him. </p><p><i>He was dead wrong. </i></p><p>Scorpion managed to hit his rib cage dead on knocking him back into a building before he could get a hit in. Peter was pretty sure he heard his a few of his ribs crack. The pain in a chest was almost instantaneous, but he had to keep on fighting. </p><p>The next morning he found himself withering in pain unable to get out of bed. It took Peter a good twenty minutes to even stand let alone put a shirt on. He could help but stare at the nasty bruises littering his chest. Sucking it up, he somehow managed to get by May long enough to leave his apartment to head to the tower. </p><p>What surprised him, even more, was Tony not catching him in his act. Granted, he was focused on fixing up his nanosuit. Peter always like watching his mentor work, just not when he\u2019s in dire need of pain meds. </p><p>But Peter Parker wasn\u2019t a baby, Tony has important work to do. He wasn\u2019t about to complain and ruin his mentor\u2019s day. He knew too well that Tony would drop everything just to make sure he was ok. </p><p>AC/DC played through the lab covering a few of Peter\u2019s yelps of pain every time he breathed. He hated this, he just wanted his bones to heal. But clearly, they were damaged more than he realized. </p><p><i>\u201cStop being such a wimp,\u201d </i>He thought to himself. <i>\u201cThe Avengers all experienced worse, you can handle this.\u201d</i></p><p>Minutes ticked by before a few tears escaped his eyes. The pain was getting worse the longer he sat in his chair. A part of him begged him to get Tony\u2019s attention while another told him to suck it up. His mentor was right there in front of him and he was too scared to ask for help.</p><p>Sniffled he tried taking some deep breaths as he hissed in pain again. He could barely breathe without his hold chest hurting. Peter wanted his to end, he just wanted to close his eyes and hope the pain disappeared. </p><p>\u201cPete?\u201d His mentor\u2019s voice snapped him out of his daze. Tony was staring at Peter now concern written on his features. \u201cKiddo what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-Nothing,\u201d He muttered. \u201cUh, just allergies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllergies my ass,\u201d Tony walked over him looking over Peter. \u201cWhat&rsquo;s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-Nothing,\u201d He muttered again unable to stop himself from yelping in pain. </p><p>Tony was quick to pick up on Peter\u2019s lies as press on finger gently onto his chest. As he recoiled in pain, his mentor was quick to make sure he didn\u2019t fall out of his seat. </p><p>\u201cWhat happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad fight, I\u2019m just little bruise up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d</p><p>Peter looked sheepishly into Tony\u2019s eyes. \u201cI think my ribs are broken.\u201d</p><p>His mentor\u2019s eyes widen as Peter showed him the bruise on his chest. He could already tell that Tony was going into panic mode by the way his hands shook. </p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re going to visit Bruce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ok! I swear, it\u2019s honestly nothing they\u2019ll heal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting checked out whether you like it or not,\u201d Tony said helping Peter out of his chair. </p><p>Slowly but surely, they made it down to the Med-bay with Bruce waiting for them. It only took a matter of minutes and a x-ray to confirm Peter\u2019s suspicions. The next thing he knew, Bruce was hooking up an IV for him to deliver pain meds. </p><p>Laying back on the table, he groggily stared at Tony. He blinked a few times trying not to let sleep over Come him just yet. </p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Tony smiled running his fingers through Peter\u2019s curls. \u201cAnytime kiddo. But don\u2019t think you\u2019re off the hook for not telling me about your injuries right away.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded a small smile tugging at his lips. \u201cSpeech later I\u2019m sleepy.\u201d</p><p>His mentor laughed as he yawned. \u201cYou&rsquo;re something else kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><hr><p>Permanent Tags:</p><p><a

It just became much harder for content creators to spread their work and this would help a lot! <b>You can find my Masterlist on my profile and the Whumptober Masterlist under series!</b></i></p><p><i><b><br></b></i></p><hr><p>Peter shifted uncomfortably in his seat watching Tony from afar tinkering away on his latest project. His mentor was in own world, too focused on his task to notice his kid on verge of tears. Peter was fine with that, the last thing he wanted was Tony fretting over him. </p><p>A sharp pain came from his chest as adjusted his position. Hissing quietly Peter bit his tongue hard to keep himself from screaming. What he would give for his enhanced healing to speed up. </p><p>He gripped his jeans making sure not to touch his chest. It was tender, too tender. Any touch wanted to make him fall to the floor in pain. Hell, he could barely sit in a chair without feeling some pain. </p><p>A few broken ribs are what Peter figured he had. Last night he had a run in with the Scorpion and ended up getting his ass handed to him. He practically had to beg Karen not to call Tony. Sure he was in a bit of pain, but he simply figured a sleeping it off would help him. </p><p><i>He was dead wrong. </i></p><p>Scorpion managed to hit his rib cage dead on knocking him back into a building before he could get a hit in. Peter was pretty sure he heard his a few of his ribs crack. The pain in a chest was almost instantaneous, but he had to keep on fighting. </p><p>The next morning he found himself withering in pain unable to get out of bed. It took Peter a good twenty minutes to even stand let alone put a shirt on. He could help but stare at the nasty bruises littering his chest. Sucking it up, he somehow managed to get by May long enough to leave his apartment to head to the tower. </p><p>What surprised him, even more, was Tony not catching him in his act. Granted, he was focused on fixing up his nanosuit. Peter always like watching his mentor work, just not when he\u2019s in dire need of pain meds. </p><p>But Peter Parker wasn\u2019t a baby, Tony has important work to do. He wasn\u2019t about to complain and ruin his mentor\u2019s day. He knew too well that Tony would drop everything just to make sure he was ok. </p><p>AC/DC played through the lab covering a few of Peter\u2019s yelps of pain every time he breathed. He hated this, he just wanted his bones to heal. But clearly, they were damaged more than he realized. </p><p><i>\u201cStop being such a wimp,\u201d </i>He thought to himself. <i>\u201cThe Avengers all experienced worse, you can handle this.\u201d</i></p><p>Minutes ticked by before a few tears escaped his eyes. The pain was getting worse the longer he sat in his chair. A part of him begged him to get Tony\u2019s attention while another told him to suck it up. His mentor was right there in front of him and he was too scared to ask for help.</p><p>Sniffled he tried taking some deep breaths as he hissed in pain again. He could barely breathe without his hold chest hurting. Peter wanted his to end, he just wanted to close his eyes and hope the pain disappeared. </p><p>\u201cPete?\u201d His mentor\u2019s voice snapped him out of his daze. Tony was staring at Peter now concern written on his features. \u201cKiddo what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-Nothing,\u201d He muttered. \u201cUh, just allergies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllergies my ass,\u201d Tony walked over him looking over Peter. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-Nothing,\u201d He muttered again unable to stop himself from yelping in pain. </p><p>Tony was quick to pick up on Peter\u2019s lies as press on finger gently onto his chest. As he recoiled in pain, his mentor was quick to make sure he didn\u2019t fall out of his seat. </p><p>\u201cWhat happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad fight, I\u2019m just little bruise up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d</p><p>Peter looked sheepishly into Tony\u2019s eyes. \u201cI think my ribs are broken.\u201d</p><p>His mentor\u2019s eyes widen as Peter showed him the bruise on his chest. He could already tell that Tony was going into panic mode by the way his hands shook. </p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re going to visit Bruce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ok! I swear, it\u2019s honestly nothing they\u2019ll heal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting checked out whether you like it or not,\u201d Tony said helping Peter out of his chair. </p><p>Slowly but surely, they made it down to the Med-bay with Bruce waiting for them. It only took a matter of minutes and a x-ray to confirm Peter\u2019s suspicions. The next thing he knew, Bruce was hooking up an IV for him to deliver pain meds. </p><p>Laying back on the table, he groggily stared at Tony. He blinked a few times trying not to let sleep over Come him just yet. </p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Tony smiled running his fingers through Peter\u2019s curls. \u201cAnytime kiddo. But don\u2019t think you\u2019re off the hook for not telling me about your injuries right away.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded a small smile tugging at his lips. \u201cSpeech later I\u2019m sleepy.\u201d</p><p>His mentor laughed as he yawned. \u201cYou\u2019re something else kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><hr><p>Permanent Tags:</p><p><a

                "content": "<p><p><b>Word Count:</b>&nbsp;828</p><p><i><b>Update:</b> So apparently tumblr killed links (Idk why, it honestly makes no sense) But if that&rsquo;s the case I won&rsquo;t be linking my masterlists anymore until it&rsquo;s fixed. If any post has a link in it, it won&rsquo;t appear in the search engine. Obviously others are saying it too but please if you see a fic/content you like the reblog it! It just became much harder for content creators to spread their work and this would help a lot! <b>You can find my Masterlist on my profile and the Whumptober Masterlist under series!</b></i></p><p><i><b><br /></b></i></p><hr /><p>Peter shifted uncomfortably in his seat watching Tony from afar tinkering away on his latest project. His mentor was in own world, too focused on his task to notice his kid on verge of tears. Peter was fine with that, the last thing he wanted was Tony fretting over him. </p><p>A sharp pain came from his chest as adjusted his position. Hissing quietly Peter bit his tongue hard to keep himself from screaming. What he would give for his enhanced healing to speed up. </p><p>He gripped his jeans making sure not to touch his chest. It was tender, too tender. Any touch wanted to make him fall to the floor in pain. Hell, he could barely sit in a chair without feeling some pain. </p><p>A few broken ribs are what Peter figured he had. Last night he had a run in with the Scorpion and ended up getting his ass handed to him. He practically had to beg Karen not to call Tony. Sure he was in a bit of pain, but he simply figured a sleeping it off would help him. </p><p><i>He was dead wrong. </i></p><p>Scorpion managed to hit his rib cage dead on knocking him back into a building before he could get a hit in. Peter was pretty sure he heard his a few of his ribs crack. The pain in a chest was almost instantaneous, but he had to keep on fighting. </p><p>The next morning he found himself withering in pain unable to get out of bed. It took Peter a good twenty minutes to even stand let alone put a shirt on. He could help but stare at the nasty bruises littering his chest. Sucking it up, he somehow managed to get by May long enough to leave his apartment to head to the tower. </p><p>What surprised him, even more, was Tony not catching him in his act. Granted, he was focused on fixing up his nanosuit. Peter always like watching his mentor work, just not when he&rsquo;s in dire need of pain meds. </p><p>But Peter Parker wasn&rsquo;t a baby, Tony has important work to do. He wasn&rsquo;t about to complain and ruin his mentor&rsquo;s day. He knew too well that Tony would drop everything just to make sure he was ok. </p><p>AC/DC played through the lab covering a few of Peter&rsquo;s yelps of pain every time he breathed. He hated this, he just wanted his bones to heal. But clearly, they were damaged more than he realized. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Stop being such a wimp,&rdquo; </i>He thought to himself. <i>&ldquo;The Avengers all experienced worse, you can handle this.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Minutes ticked by before a few tears escaped his eyes. The pain was getting worse the longer he sat in his chair. A part of him begged him to get Tony&rsquo;s attention while another told him to suck it up. His mentor was right there in front of him and he was too scared to ask for help.</p><p>Sniffled he tried taking some deep breaths as he hissed in pain again. He could barely breathe without his hold chest hurting. Peter wanted his to end, he just wanted to close his eyes and hope the pain disappeared. </p><p>&ldquo;Pete?&rdquo; His mentor&rsquo;s voice snapped him out of his daze. Tony was staring at Peter now concern written on his features. &ldquo;Kiddo what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;N-Nothing,&rdquo; He muttered. &ldquo;Uh, just allergies.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Allergies my ass,&rdquo; Tony walked over him looking over Peter. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;N-Nothing,&rdquo; He muttered again unable to stop himself from yelping in pain. </p><p>Tony was quick to pick up on Peter&rsquo;s lies as press on finger gently onto his chest. As he recoiled in pain, his mentor was quick to make sure he didn&rsquo;t fall out of his seat. </p><p>&ldquo;What happen?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bad fight, I&rsquo;m just little bruise up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter looked sheepishly into Tony&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;I think my ribs are broken.&rdquo;</p><p>His mentor&rsquo;s eyes widen as Peter showed him the bruise on his chest. He could already tell that Tony was going into panic mode by the way his hands shook. </p><p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re going to visit Bruce.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ok! I swear, it&rsquo;s honestly nothing they&rsquo;ll heal.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting checked out whether you like it or not,&rdquo; Tony said helping Peter out of his chair. </p><p>Slowly but surely, they made it down to the Med-bay with Bruce waiting for them. It only took a matter of minutes and a x-ray to confirm Peter&rsquo;s suspicions. The next thing he knew, Bruce was hooking up an IV for him to deliver pain meds. </p><p>Laying back on the table, he groggily stared at Tony. He blinked a few times trying not to let sleep over Come him just yet. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony smiled running his fingers through Peter&rsquo;s curls. &ldquo;Anytime kiddo. But don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re off the hook for not telling me about your injuries right away.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nodded a small smile tugging at his lips. &ldquo;Speech later I&rsquo;m sleepy.&rdquo;</p><p>His mentor laughed as he yawned. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re something else kid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>Permanent Tags:</p><p><a
