        "body": "<p>there\u2019s many similarities between asoiaf and shakespeare. as you like it is no exception. both contain themes of nature vs society (specifically \u201ccourt\u201d) and heavily feature songs. but its with three characters in particular - arya, ned and gendry - that i see the most similarities</p><blockquote><p>\n\nHere shall he see no enemy <br/>But winter and rough weather.\u00a0<br/></p></blockquote><p>duke senior is like ned stark if he had gotten lucky. the former is banished to the woods after a political coup which he\u2019s actually pretty happy about because court is full of\u00a0\u201cperil\u201d and\u00a0\u201cenvy\u201d. ned reflects that same attitude:</p><blockquote><p>\n\nEddard Stark wanted nothing so much as to return to Winterfell, to the clean simplicity of the north, where the enemies were winter and the wildlings beyond the Wall. (AGOT)<br/></p></blockquote><p>i find that to be a very compelling parallel. those quotes are exactly the same. they hate the court of liars and crave the wild. its dangerous, cold and brutal in its own way but honest. the north in asoiaf is considered one great wilderness since it does not have a traditional court. but while duke senior is eventually reinstated ned stark is executed. both their daughters are caught in the middle of this.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nI do remember in this shepherd boy<br/>Some lively touches of my daughter\u2019s favor.\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>arya is forced to flee to the wilds disguised as a boy called arry (like rosalind who assumes the alias ganymede) as a result of her father\u2019s involvement in these political instabilities. arya and rosalind are both clever, bold, loyal and resourceful. but arya\u2019s relationship with gender is far more complicated than rosalind who does not \u201chave a doublet and hose in [her] disposition\u201d the play really reinforces gender roles in the end where as asoiaf is far more critical and allows for more complexity. but they do have another huge parallel and that is they form close bonds to the sons of the father\u2019s friends</p><blockquote><p>ARYA: Maybe King Robert had drunk a lot, but he&rsquo;d been her father&rsquo;s friend.\u00a0<br/></p><p>ROSALIND: The duke my father loved his father dearly. </p></blockquote><p>and its pretty obvious in both cases who their fathers are</p><blockquote><p>\n\nIf that you were the good Sir Rowland\u2019s son, As you have whispered faithfully you were,<br/>And as mine eye doth his effigies witness<br/>Most truly limned and living in your face, Be truly welcome hither. I am the duke<br/>That loved your father.\u00a0<br/></p></blockquote><p>when duke senior meets orlando he quickly realizes he is his father\u2019s son. ned had the same reaction to gendry:</p><blockquote><p>\n\nThat the armorer&rsquo;s sullen apprentice was the king&rsquo;s son, Ned had no doubt. The Baratheon look was stamped on his face, in his jaw, his eyes, that black hair. [&hellip;] Gendry had to be Robert&rsquo;s. (AGOT)<br/></p></blockquote><p>orlando and gendry have notable strength and are stubborn too. arya/gendry and orlando/rosalind must flee from court/the city or lose their lives and its in the forest where their relationships grow. in the forest, in disguise, they are able to form a bond that is seldom seen between men and women within the confines of court: friendship. they are equals in this environment. theres no rules so its a place of freedom and discovery. that goes doubly so for arya and gendry since unlike orlando he is of a much lower birth than arya</p><blockquote><p>Sir you have wrestled well, and overthrown<br/>more than your enemies.</p></blockquote><p>both pairs also have significant wrestling scenes that are very symbolic. rosalind and orlando first meet after he successfully wrestles an opponent and both compare their instant feelings for each other to being\u00a0\u201coverthrown\u201d the act of falling in love is compared to a wrestling match</p><blockquote><p>Arya shoved him back against the anvil and made to run, but Gendry caught her arm. She stuck a foot between his legs and tripped him, but he yanked her down with him, and they rolled across the floor of the smithy.\u00a0<br/></p></blockquote><p>arya and gendry take it one step further by actually wrestling with each other. which would be considered highly inappropriate. arya is a princess and gendry is a blacksmith. but they don\u2019t care. this scene is all romantic subtext. arya and gendry are just children now - this is playful - but the implications is that when they\u2019re grown they\u2019ll be wrestling in a less innocent way. its directly followed by a love song about a man and a woman who want to be together. he wants to lay her down in a featherbed but shes content to roll around in the grass.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nIt was a lover and his lass,\n<br/>That o\u2019er the green cornfield did pass\n\n\n<br/></p><p>\n\nBut you can be my forest love,<br/>and me your forest lass. (ASOS)<br/></p></blockquote><p>as you like it has more songs than any other shakespeare play (or so i read) asoiaf also features many songs. arya and gendry have their own love theme that revolves around the same major theme in this play which is the contrast between the conventions of society and the freedom nature provides.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nAll the world\u2019s a stage, <br/>And all the men and women merely players;<br/>They have their exits and their entrances, <br/>And one man in his time plays many parts\u00a0<br/></p></blockquote><p>this is probably the plays most famous passage. i find it extremely applicable to arya who assumes numerous personas/aliases throughout her story - even becoming an actress in a very shakespearen like play. the theater is a hugely important element in her mercy chapter. the rest of this speech describes how lives are broken in \u201cseven ages\u201d from infant to lover to solider ect. which reminded me of the faith of the seven in asoiaf that breaks a single entity into several aspects that represent an individual\u2019s layered humanity.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nI could find in my heart to disgrace my man\u2019s apparel and to cry like a woman; but I must comfort<br/>the weaker vessel, as doublet and hose ought to show it- self courageous to petticoat. <br/></p><p>\n\n&ldquo;I wish I was home,&rdquo; she said miserably. She tried so hard to be brave, to be fierce as a wolverine and all, but sometimes she felt like she was just a little girl after all.

(AGOT)<br></p></blockquote><p>i find that to be a very compelling parallel. those quotes are exactly the same. they hate the court of liars and crave the wild. its dangerous, cold and brutal in its own way but honest. the north in asoiaf is considered one great wilderness since it does not have a traditional court. but while duke senior is eventually reinstated ned stark is executed. both their daughters are caught in the middle of this.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nI do remember in this shepherd boy<br>Some lively touches of my daughter\u2019s favor.\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>arya is forced to flee to the wilds disguised as a boy called arry (like rosalind who assumes the alias ganymede) as a result of her father\u2019s involvement in these political instabilities. arya and rosalind are both clever, bold, loyal and resourceful. but arya\u2019s relationship with gender is far more complicated than rosalind who does not \u201chave a doublet and hose in [her] disposition\u201d the play really reinforces gender roles in the end where as asoiaf is far more critical and allows for more complexity. but they do have another huge parallel and that is they form close bonds to the sons of the father\u2019s friends</p><blockquote><p>ARYA: Maybe King Robert had drunk a lot, but he\u2019d been her father\u2019s friend.\u00a0<br></p><p>ROSALIND: The duke my father loved his father dearly. </p></blockquote><p>and its pretty obvious in both cases who their fathers are</p><blockquote><p>\n\nIf that you were the good Sir Rowland\u2019s son, As you have whispered faithfully you were,<br>And as mine eye doth his effigies witness<br>Most truly limned and living in your face, Be truly welcome hither. I am the duke<br>That loved your father.\u00a0<br></p></blockquote><p>when duke senior meets orlando he quickly realizes he is his father\u2019s son. ned had the same reaction to gendry:</p><blockquote><p>\n\nThat the armorer\u2019s sullen apprentice was the king\u2019s son, Ned had no doubt. The Baratheon look was stamped on his face, in his jaw, his eyes, that black hair. [\u2026] Gendry had to be Robert\u2019s. (AGOT)<br></p></blockquote><p>orlando and gendry have notable strength and are stubborn too. arya/gendry and orlando/rosalind must flee from court/the city or lose their lives and its in the forest where their relationships grow. in the forest, in disguise, they are able to form a bond that is seldom seen between men and women within the confines of court: friendship. they are equals in this environment. theres no rules so its a place of freedom and discovery. that goes doubly so for arya and gendry since unlike orlando he is of a much lower birth than arya</p><blockquote><p>Sir you have wrestled well, and overthrown<br>more than your enemies.</p></blockquote><p>both pairs also have significant wrestling scenes that are very symbolic. rosalind and orlando first meet after he successfully wrestles an opponent and both compare their instant feelings for each other to being\u00a0\u201coverthrown\u201d the act of falling in love is compared to a wrestling match</p><blockquote><p>Arya shoved him back against the anvil and made to run, but Gendry caught her arm. She stuck a foot between his legs and tripped him, but he yanked her down with him, and they rolled across the floor of the smithy.\u00a0<br></p></blockquote><p>arya and gendry take it one step further by actually wrestling with each other. which would be considered highly inappropriate. arya is a princess and gendry is a blacksmith. but they don\u2019t care. this scene is all romantic subtext. arya and gendry are just children now - this is playful - but the implications is that when they\u2019re grown they\u2019ll be wrestling in a less innocent way. its directly followed by a love song about a man and a woman who want to be together. he wants to lay her down in a featherbed but shes content to roll around in the grass.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nIt was a lover and his lass,\n<br>That o\u2019er the green cornfield did pass\n\n\n<br></p><p>\n\nBut you can be my forest love,<br>and me your forest lass. (ASOS)<br></p></blockquote><p>as you like it has more songs than any other shakespeare play (or so i read) asoiaf also features many songs. arya and gendry have their own love theme that revolves around the same major theme in this play which is the contrast between the conventions of society and the freedom nature provides.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nAll the world\u2019s a stage, <br>And all the men and women merely players;<br>They have their exits and their entrances, <br>And one man in his time plays many parts\u00a0<br></p></blockquote><p>this is probably the plays most famous passage. i find it extremely applicable to arya who assumes numerous personas/aliases throughout her story - even becoming an actress in a very shakespearen like play. the theater is a hugely important element in her mercy chapter. the rest of this speech describes how lives are broken in \u201cseven ages\u201d from infant to lover to solider ect. which reminded me of the faith of the seven in asoiaf that breaks a single entity into several aspects that represent an individual\u2019s layered humanity.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nI could find in my heart to disgrace my man\u2019s apparel and to cry like a woman; but I must comfort<br>the weaker vessel, as doublet and hose ought to show it- self courageous to petticoat. <br></p><p>\n\n\u201cI wish I was home,\u201d she said miserably.
