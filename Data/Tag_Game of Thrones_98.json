Good. You hadn\u2019t liked him so you were quite relieved you weren\u2019t the one that was going to be married to him. But your sister was which you also didn\u2019t like the idea of. You and Sansa were twins but were completely different. For one you didn\u2019t have the red hair like she had. You had long dark brown curls. And second unlike Sansa and more like Arya you liked swinging a sword and God\u2019s were you good. Thanks to Jon he helped you in secret because he didn\u2019t want your mother finding out. But unlike Arya you also enjoyed sewing. Sometimes.</i></p><p>~ </p><p>\u201c are you okay my lady?\u201d Podrick asked you. That made you snap back from your thoughts. </p><p>\u201c yes Podrick I\u2019m fine I guess I\u2019m just nervous to be going home. And I told you already you can just call me y/n there\u2019s no need for formal titles.\u201d You told him and he just nodded in agreement.</p><p>\u201c you don\u2019t have to be nervous that is your home your brother and sister are there now.\u201d Lady brienne told you. </p><p>You had left with them from Riverrun where you were hiding after your uncle the Blackfish had found you. You ran into him when you were first trying to go home. He didn\u2019t recognize you at first but you did recognize him. Mainly because of his armor. After that he helped you by hiding your identity and helped you escape when the castle was under attack by Lannister men. </p><p>\u201c I know but I can\u2019t help but be nervous I haven\u2019t seen them in years. And I guess I feel a little guilty for leaving my sisters in kings landing.\u201d You said as you were heading on your way again. </p><p>\u201c you shouldn\u2019t you were young you couldn\u2019t have done much.\u201d </p><p>\u201c I guess you\u2019re right.\u201d You still couldn\u2019t but help but wonder if you could\u2019ve at least tried harder to at least find Arya. You knew that Sansa wouldn\u2019t leave with you when you did because she was bethrothed to Joffrey at that time. </p><p>As you were getting closer to the castle you could feel your heart beating faster. Your siblings didn\u2019t know that you were in your way since their was no time to send a raven and you couldn\u2019t send one before. </p><p>~ </p><p>You were waiting in the great hall for your siblings. Lady Brienne and Podrick had left you there alone so you could be alone with your siblings. You were next to fire getting warmed up waiting for them. <i>What\u2019s taking them so long</i>. It seemed like forever but you finally heard the footsteps your heartbeat getting faster as they got closer and then door opened. And that nervous feeling you had disappeared as soon as they walked. You turned around and you saw them Sansa and Jon. Sansa looked older and like a true lady. Her look wasn\u2019t the same as last time this time the way she looked sadder perhaps but it  told a story of went she through making her look more mysterious stronger. And Jon he had scars on his faces but those also told stories.</p><p>\u201c y/n?\u201d </p><p>You couldn\u2019t help but run to your siblings and giving your twin a her tight hug. You two were crying but you didn\u2019t care if they saw you crying . And than after a long time you went to hug Jon. He was stronger his embrace around you was strong like he didn\u2019t want let go. You could feel a sigh of relief when he was hugging you. And you couldn\u2019t help but cry even more. </p><p>~ </p><p>You all were outside watching the snow fall in a comfortable silence enjoying each others presence. </p><p>\u201c I\u2019m sorry Sansa.\u201d You said she turned to look at you she had a confused expression her face.</p><p>\u201c for?\u201d </p><p>\u201c for leaving you there with those people I should\u2019ve went and gotten you when I left.\u201d You told her. You could feel the tears running down your face. </p><p>\u201c you don\u2019t have to apologize for anything it wasn\u2019t your fault and I was a stupid girl then. I would\u2019ve not left with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201c I guess we were all stupid for leaving Winterfell.\u201d</p><p>\u201c I want to scream at myself don\u2019t go you idiot.\u201d </p><p>\u201c how could we know.\u201d Jon said. You three stood and once watched the snow in silence. </p><p>\u201c a raven came from the citadel. A white raven. Winter is here.\u201d Sansa announced. After saying that you all couldn\u2019t help but smile. </p><p>\u201c well, father always promised didn\u2019t he.\u201d Jon said while chuckling a little looking up at the snow that was falling. </p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p>",

She sees these houses\u2019 constant jockeying for power as an evil that needs to be eradicated. How will she do this?

I suspect this is in no small way attributable to insecurity.\u00a0</p><p>In Meereen she managed to alienate the entire ruling class by exacting cruel and random punishment against the Masters. She crucified 163 Masters, not because these 163 were guilty, but to make up the numbers to match child slaves who had been crucified. We know at least one was innocent. She fed a Master, chosen at random and without proof of guilt, to her dragons because she was angry at the death of Barristen Selmy.\u00a0 She gave them no alternative but to rebel because they were always at risk from arbitrary arrest and execution without proof or trial.

Even Tyrion is in the dark.</p><p>All we know for certain is she will probably attempt to rein in the power of the great houses so the crown cannot be challenged.

She sees these houses\u2019 constant jockeying for power as an evil that needs to be eradicated. How will she do this?

The only way to break the wheel is to break those families\u2019 hold on power.</p><p>Her demand that all the families of Westeros bend the knee indicates that she hasn\u2019t given up on the feudal system itself.

I suspect this is in no small way attributable to insecurity.\u00a0</p><p>In Meereen she managed to alienate the entire ruling class by exacting cruel and random punishment against the Masters. She crucified 163 Masters, not because these 163 were guilty, but to make up the numbers to match child slaves who had been crucified. We know at least one was innocent. She fed a Master, chosen at random and without proof of guilt, to her dragons because she was angry at the death of Barristen Selmy.\u00a0 She gave them no alternative but to rebel because they were always at risk from arbitrary arrest and execution without proof or trial.

Only not in the way that you&rsquo;d think. I believe the promise was made between man, and the walkers to make peace. They would provide/sacrifice a prince to the walkers every X thousand years in order for the night king to have an heir and in return they would return to the North. Thats the basic premise of the theory and now for some additional insight while rewatching the show.</p> <p>It has occurred to me that the Night King knows that Jon is the prince that was promised. Why? Isn&rsquo;t it strange how seemingly every time Jon ventures north of the wall, he runs into the walkers? Other rangers seem to come and go as they please without running into them. The wildlings by and large are either ignored or not full out assaulted. Yet when Jon goes to hard home weeks/months after the assault on the wall, the free folk are attacked. It seems like too much of a coincidence that the Night King would choose that very moment to attack. Just food for thought, it seemed to click for me- what do you guys think?</p> </div><br/><br/>\nSource: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2GzBpyV\">http://bit.ly/2GzBpyV</a>",
