Situated in the middle of the notification centre was the dreaded article that Namjoon had asked you not to look at. But you did. You saw the headline. And there was no going back now. You pressed the notification leading to the article, your heart pounding in your chest and tears threatening to spill over. This can&rsquo;t be true. There must be some kind of mistake. Haneul&rsquo;s mum died when he was 15-months, you were sure of it. Namjoon told you so.</p><p>The article told you everything you didn&rsquo;t want to know. Haneul&rsquo;s name was right there in digitally printed letters, along with a photograph of him being held by Namjoon when he was a baby. Namjoon and his partner at the time&hellip; wait&hellip; Minji? This can&rsquo;t be right. Why was Minji there at Haneul&rsquo;s birth? Unless&hellip; no&hellip; it couldn&rsquo;t be. Tears streamed from your eyes as you continued to read the article. Someone you considered to be a friend spouting the biggest bullshit you&rsquo;ve seen in a while all about the two men in your life whom you absolutely adored. She told everyone that she and Haneul and her were incredibly close and that she was about to give love a second try with Namjoon. They were due to split with their current partners to be together. That was when your heart broke. Namjoon had called you to break up with you. He&rsquo;d called you out of courtesy. You weren&rsquo;t supposed to read the article because he wanted to tell you in person. At least he was decent, you couldn&rsquo;t deny that.</p><p>When Yongsik pulled up, everything inside you was screaming to not get into the car. Your brain was telling you to run towards the nearest train station and stay on it until the last stop, which you very nearly did. But your loyalty to the man who hadn&rsquo;t shown the same to you was too strong, and you needed answers that running away wouldn&rsquo;t give you. So you got into Yongsik&rsquo;s car, and watched as Seoul drove by, the nightscape drenched in the rain providing the perfect backdrop for your mood. Everything hurt. Your eyes, your heart. And what didn&rsquo;t hurt felt empty, and numb. Your teeth were tingling with the amount you&rsquo;d cried with an open mouth.</p><p>Yongsik kept looking at you in his rear-view mirror. You could tell he wanted to say something, but it wasn&rsquo;t his job to. He knew exactly why you were crying, and you could see the pity in his eyes. This angered you. You didn&rsquo;t want to be pitied. You didn&rsquo;t want anyone to feel sorry for you because your boyfriend had broken up with you via media so he could get back with his dead ex-partner and play happy families.</p><p>When you pulled up to Namjoon&rsquo;s building, you took your time getting out the car and walking up to the front door. You punched the number into the door, kicked your shoes off and made your way to the living area, your coat remaining on your body to allow you a quicker getaway.</p><p>You could see Namjoon sat there, eyes red raw from crying and his leg bouncing nervously as he waited for you. When he looked up, he saw you, your face mimicking his making him wonder if he was looking into a mirror. He knew as soon as he&rsquo;d seen the makeup running down your face that you&rsquo;d done what he&rsquo;d asked you not to do and read the article.</p><p>&ldquo;You lied to me.&rdquo; Your voice was quieter than you wanted it to be, but loud enough for Namjoon to hear it, and even flinch at the pain present in your voice. &ldquo;You told me she was dead.&rdquo;</p><p>Namjoon shook his head. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t. I just told you she left. You came to the conclusion she died.&rdquo;</p><p>Your anger burst out of you suddenly. &ldquo;So this is <i>my </i>fault? If you knew I thought she&rsquo;d died, Namjoon, then why didn&rsquo;t you correct me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because as far as I was concerned, she was dead. She hadn&rsquo;t bothered with me or Haneul in <i>years</i>! Why would I say to you, &lsquo;oh, by the way, Minji might come back after abandoning her son any day now, so expect that&rsquo;, when as far as I was aware, she was in Busan screwing some fucking English teacher who she later married?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You still should have corrected me, Namjoon! You should have told me that she was still alive and that I was wrong! At least this wouldn&rsquo;t have hurt as much as it does!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sorry for that. I just thought I was doing the right thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well clearly you thought wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>Silence. Namjoon agreed with you. He couldn&rsquo;t say another word. He just watched you take a seat on the couch opposite him. You cleared your throat and broke the silence again.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do this. If you kept her hidden from me, what else have you kept hidden from me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing, I swear.&rdquo;</p><p>You began to sob. &ldquo;How can I believe that, Joon? How do I know that our entire relationship hasn&rsquo;t been built on secrets and mistakes? How can I trust you again? Us? How?&rdquo;</p><p>He was crying too, watching your heart break was ripping him to shreds. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that. We&hellip; we can get through this. Please don&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can we? I don&rsquo;t know who you are. I could cope with the fans and the news articles about me. I could cope with the long days in the studio and you coming home exhausted from dance practise. I could cope with taking care of Haneul like he was my own, in fact, that was one of the things I loved most. Him. And you. I can&rsquo;t cope with this, Joon. You should have told me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know I should have and I&rsquo;m so sorry. There aren&rsquo;t any words to tell you just how sorry I am. I will to anything, <i>anything </i>to make it up to you. You tell me what it is and I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to get back with her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. I have you.&rdquo; He got on his knees and crawled over to you, grabbing hold of your hand and holding it tightly. &ldquo;Why would I want <i>her </i>when I have you? A beautiful,&rdquo; he kissed your hand, &ldquo;kind,&rdquo; his lips travelled upwards, &ldquo;funny,&rdquo; each word he punctuated with a kiss further up your body, &ldquo;sweet, amazing, smart, talented woman? You make me so happy every single day, ___. I wake up each morning with my son one side of me and my stunning girlfriend the other side and I can&rsquo;t believe just how fucking lucky I am. I love you so fucking much I feel like my heart could burst.&rdquo;</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t want to ask this question. You shouldn&rsquo;t have. You knew you wouldn&rsquo;t like the answer so you should have just kept it to yourself, joined him on the floor and kissed him. You should have told him that everything would be okay and that you&rsquo;d stay with him no matter what. But you didn&rsquo;t. You opened your mouth and regretted it immediately. &ldquo;Do you still love her?&rdquo; Namjoon sat back and looked away from you. He didn&rsquo;t say anything. You could tell he was sat there trying to think of a way to answer your question. His non-immediate answer was the final straw. &ldquo;Goodbye, Namjoon.&rdquo;</p><p>You stood and walked towards the door. You heard him stand and run towards you. He ran in front of you and put his hands on either side of the wall to block your path to the front door. &ldquo;No, please don&rsquo;t do this. I&rsquo;m begging you, ___. Don&rsquo;t leave us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Get out of my way, Namjoon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Namjoon, move!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p><p>You tried to push passed him but it was useless. He was too strong for you. His large hands grabbed hold of your shoulders and pushed you against the wall. You didn&rsquo;t have time to fight back as his lips were on yours, pinning you there in a passionate kiss. All teeth and tongues but it was somehow everything you needed at that time. Your brain was telling you to push him away and leave him in the hallway. But your body and your heart was letting him unzip your coat and throw it to the floor. Your body was allowing him to press open mouthed kisses to your neck as he removed your jeans. Allowed him to drop to his knees and put his tongue on you while you were still pressed to the wall, hands in his hair and wet eyes closing in pure pleasure as his plump lips wrapped around your clit and sucked in the way you loved. He&rsquo;d spent so many nights with you, he knew exactly how to push your buttons and make you feel absolutely amazing. And tonight was no exception.</p><p>He slipped two fingers passed your entrance, diving deep into your wetness and making you sing. He started to stroke you in that way that hit your spot, your hips bucking at the sensation and soon enough you were cumming around his mouth, gasping for oxygen and tugging at his hair.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t give you time to come down, he rarely did when he was this worked up. Instead, he kissed you, and dragged you into his bedroom, throwing your clothes and his all over the apartment for a worry at a later time. As soon as you were in, he closed the door and his lips locked onto yours, pushing you towards the bed and falling on top of you.</p><p>Whenever Namjoon was inside you, regardless of the mood or the kind of sex you were having, it always felt right. Tonight, despite saying goodbye, was no exception. As he entered you, he looked into your eyes as he always did, thrusted in and watched your face as you stretched around him, the burn feeling exquisite to both of you. One thrust in, hard, deep, nearly hitting your cervix, earning one loud moan from you and a grunt from him. He could never keep quiet during sex, something you loved about him. Another thrust, then another, until he&rsquo;d got bored of that and started to move faster, his thrusts slower and softer but feeling no less pleasurable.</p><p>No words were exchanged between the two of you like there was usually. It was just the sound of your cunt swallowing him greedily, and his kisses pressing against your skin. He played with your clit to get you to cum a second time, making sure that you got everything you needed before he even started to chase his own orgasm. And, when you came the second time, everything seemed to freeze. Your body, time, the world. All you could feel was him inside you and how good he&rsquo;d made you feel.</p><p>Namjoon came inside you, something you&rsquo;d only ever let him do a handful of times. He didn&rsquo;t pull out immediately either, instead, he collapsed onto you leaving his cock in your cunt and his head in your neck. He breathed in your scent, fingertips traced your skin. It was almost as if he was memorising your body a second time, getting to know you once more.</p><p>Haneul, you&rsquo;d come to learn, had been staying in his uncle Tae&rsquo;s room. You found this out after Namjoon had fallen asleep next to you on the bed and you&rsquo;d rushed around the apartment putting your clothes back on before any of his roommates caught you scampering around in the nude. Taehyung was entering the kitchen just as you were putting your top back on, and gave you a look mixed with pity and sadness.</p><p>&ldquo;You talked it out then?&rdquo; He asked. You simply nodded in reply. &ldquo;What did you decide to do? I know Namjoon was worried you might leave him. Is that&hellip;?&rdquo; Tae didn&rsquo;t finish his question because you&rsquo;d crumbled and started crying in front of him, something you didn&rsquo;t want to do. Tae charged towards you, and wrapped you up in his arms, rocking you gently to try and soothe you. He knew that you&rsquo;d just said goodbye to Namjoon, and he knew how much that would have broken both you and his hyung.</p><p>&ldquo;He still loves her, Tae.&rdquo; You wept.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s always gonna love her. She gave birth to his son. He&rsquo;s not ever going to forget that is he?&rdquo; He pushed you away and held onto your shoulders to look at your face. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s hopelessly in love with you, ___. Fuck, he wouldn&rsquo;t stop talking about you when you&rsquo;d first met. And he still doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He lied to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And he feels like shit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So do I!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not justifying his actions. He should have been clear with you from the start. But don&rsquo;t give up on what you have.&rdquo;</p><p>You looked around the kitchen and found that Haneul&rsquo;s things were still everywhere, meaning he was still here and not with his grandparents. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Haneul?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In my room, asleep. Or he was. I don&rsquo;t know if he still is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can I go see him?&rdquo;</p><p>Tae nodded and gestured to his bedroom door, one of the partitioned rooms built into the living room. You crept inside, and saw the toddler asleep in a bed far too big for him. The sight alone was enough to make you cry again. He was such a gorgeous, innocent little boy, with a cheeky smile and a sense of humour that was far more intelligent than what a four-year-old boy should have. He was cute and cuddly, and completely obsessed with cars. And he loved the bones off you, even you could see it. Which made this tougher.</p><p>Selfishly, you knelt down beside him so your faces were level and gently shook him so he woke up. He was like his father and could fall asleep easily, so you knew he&rsquo;d go back to sleep. His sleepy, big, brown eyes focussed on you and he smiled. &ldquo;Hey, big guy.&rdquo; You said, rubbing his back.</p><p>&ldquo;___, you&rsquo;re back!&rdquo; He said. His voice was quiet and filled with sleep but he was still so excited to see you.</p><p>&ldquo;Not for much longer, sweetie. I have to leave soon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You leave, or daddy leave? Because when Daddy leaves he&rsquo;s away for a long time and I get to see grammy and grandpa.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be away for a long, long time. So I&rsquo;ve,&rdquo; you could feel the lump forming in your throat. You tried to keep it at bay. You couldn&rsquo;t let him see you cry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just come to say goodbye. And tell you that I love you a whole bunch and that I&rsquo;ll miss you so much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll still be in Korea. But I just might not visit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it because Daddy shouted at you? Because I heard it and he shouldn&rsquo;t have raised his voice. He always told me I shouldn&rsquo;t shout at anyone. But you shouted at Daddy too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, big guy. We didn&rsquo;t mean to upset you. I promise you, it won&rsquo;t happen again.&rdquo; Haneul nodded. &ldquo;Right, you&rsquo;ve got playgroup in the morning, haven&rsquo;t you? So, you&rsquo;d better get back to sleep.&rdquo; You tucked him back in and watched him get settled in bed. &ldquo;I love you, big guy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo;</p><p>You placed one final kiss on the top of his head and then left the room, collapsing onto the sofa and crying as quietly as you could. Taehyung was sat on the sofa opposite you, he&rsquo;d heard everything that you&rsquo;d said and was crying himself.</p><p>&ldquo;So this really is goodbye?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Tae. I can&rsquo;t do this anymore. Look after each other, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung nodded and gave you another hug, rubbing your back as he held you tightly. He couldn&rsquo;t understand why you were leaving, but he knew it was something you felt you needed to do, so he couldn&rsquo;t force you to stay. Instead, he helped you into your coat, gave you one last hug and said goodbye to you. Hoping it wasn&rsquo;t for the last time.</p><p>Namjoon&rsquo;s alarm buzzed at 6:30 the next morning. He switched it off, turned over to wrap his arm around you to find you&rsquo;d gone. Your clothes were missing from his apartment which meant you took off some time during the night. His heart shattered for the final time that day.</p><p>Your alarm went off at 8. The bed was cold next to you and your eyes were still stinging from the amount you&rsquo;d cried last night. The tears started up once more when your alarm had switched off from your phone and you saw your lock screen.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"698\" data-orig-height=\"1200\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/374bfda68e278c93b5ef36160158e03c/tumblr_inline_pqzs1lPjNZ1wcljpr_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"698\" data-orig-height=\"1200\"/></figure>",

You could tell he wanted to say something, but it wasn\u2019t his job to. He knew exactly why you were crying, and you could see the pity in his eyes. This angered you. You didn\u2019t want to be pitied. You didn\u2019t want anyone to feel sorry for you because your boyfriend had broken up with you via media so he could get back with his dead ex-partner and play happy families.</p><p>When you pulled up to Namjoon\u2019s building, you took your time getting out the car and walking up to the front door. You punched the number into the door, kicked your shoes off and made your way to the living area, your coat remaining on your body to allow you a quicker getaway.</p><p>You could see Namjoon sat there, eyes red raw from crying and his leg bouncing nervously as he waited for you. When he looked up, he saw you, your face mimicking his making him wonder if he was looking into a mirror. He knew as soon as he\u2019d seen the makeup running down your face that you\u2019d done what he\u2019d asked you not to do and read the article.</p><p>\u201cYou lied to me.\u201d Your voice was quieter than you wanted it to be, but loud enough for Namjoon to hear it, and even flinch at the pain present in your voice. \u201cYou told me she was dead.\u201d</p><p>Namjoon shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t. I just told you she left. You came to the conclusion she died.\u201d</p><p>Your anger burst out of you suddenly. \u201cSo this is <i>my </i>fault? If you knew I thought she\u2019d died, Namjoon, then why didn\u2019t you correct me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause as far as I was concerned, she was dead. She hadn\u2019t bothered with me or Haneul in <i>years</i>! Why would I say to you, \u2018oh, by the way, Minji might come back after abandoning her son any day now, so expect that\u2019, when as far as I was aware, she was in Busan screwing some fucking English teacher who she later married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still should have corrected me, Namjoon! You should have told me that she was still alive and that I was wrong! At least this wouldn\u2019t have hurt as much as it does!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry for that. I just thought I was doing the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell clearly you thought wrong.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Namjoon agreed with you. He couldn\u2019t say another word. He just watched you take a seat on the couch opposite him. You cleared your throat and broke the silence again.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this. If you kept her hidden from me, what else have you kept hidden from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, I swear.\u201d</p><p>You began to sob. \u201cHow can I believe that, Joon? How do I know that our entire relationship hasn\u2019t been built on secrets and mistakes? How can I trust you again? Us? How?\u201d</p><p>He was crying too, watching your heart break was ripping him to shreds. \u201cDon\u2019t say that. We\u2026 we can get through this. Please don\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we? I don\u2019t know who you are. I could cope with the fans and the news articles about me. I could cope with the long days in the studio and you coming home exhausted from dance practise. I could cope with taking care of Haneul like he was my own, in fact, that was one of the things I loved most. Him. And you. I can\u2019t cope with this, Joon. You should have told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I should have and I\u2019m so sorry. There aren\u2019t any words to tell you just how sorry I am. I will to anything, <i>anything </i>to make it up to you. You tell me what it is and I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to get back with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I have you.\u201d He got on his knees and crawled over to you, grabbing hold of your hand and holding it tightly. \u201cWhy would I want <i>her </i>when I have you? A beautiful,\u201d he kissed your hand, \u201ckind,\u201d his lips travelled upwards, \u201cfunny,\u201d each word he punctuated with a kiss further up your body, \u201csweet, amazing, smart, talented woman? You make me so happy every single day, ___. I wake up each morning with my son one side of me and my stunning girlfriend the other side and I can\u2019t believe just how fucking lucky I am. I love you so fucking much I feel like my heart could burst.\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t want to ask this question. You shouldn\u2019t have. You knew you wouldn\u2019t like the answer so you should have just kept it to yourself, joined him on the floor and kissed him. You should have told him that everything would be okay and that you\u2019d stay with him no matter what. But you didn\u2019t. You opened your mouth and regretted it immediately. \u201cDo you still love her?\u201d Namjoon sat back and looked away from you. He didn\u2019t say anything. You could tell he was sat there trying to think of a way to answer your question. His non-immediate answer was the final straw. \u201cGoodbye, Namjoon.\u201d</p><p>You stood and walked towards the door. You heard him stand and run towards you. He ran in front of you and put his hands on either side of the wall to block your path to the front door. \u201cNo, please don\u2019t do this. I\u2019m begging you, ___. Don\u2019t leave us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of my way, Namjoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNamjoon, move!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>You tried to push passed him but it was useless. He was too strong for you. His large hands grabbed hold of your shoulders and pushed you against the wall. You didn\u2019t have time to fight back as his lips were on yours, pinning you there in a passionate kiss. All teeth and tongues but it was somehow everything you needed at that time. Your brain was telling you to push him away and leave him in the hallway. But your body and your heart was letting him unzip your coat and throw it to the floor. Your body was allowing him to press open mouthed kisses to your neck as he removed your jeans. Allowed him to drop to his knees and put his tongue on you while you were still pressed to the wall, hands in his hair and wet eyes closing in pure pleasure as his plump lips wrapped around your clit and sucked in the way you loved. He\u2019d spent so many nights with you, he knew exactly how to push your buttons and make you feel absolutely amazing. And tonight was no exception.</p><p>He slipped two fingers passed your entrance, diving deep into your wetness and making you sing. He started to stroke you in that way that hit your spot, your hips bucking at the sensation and soon enough you were cumming around his mouth, gasping for oxygen and tugging at his hair.</p><p>He didn\u2019t give you time to come down, he rarely did when he was this worked up. Instead, he kissed you, and dragged you into his bedroom, throwing your clothes and his all over the apartment for a worry at a later time. As soon as you were in, he closed the door and his lips locked onto yours, pushing you towards the bed and falling on top of you.</p><p>Whenever Namjoon was inside you, regardless of the mood or the kind of sex you were having, it always felt right. Tonight, despite saying goodbye, was no exception. As he entered you, he looked into your eyes as he always did, thrusted in and watched your face as you stretched around him, the burn feeling exquisite to both of you. One thrust in, hard, deep, nearly hitting your cervix, earning one loud moan from you and a grunt from him. He could never keep quiet during sex, something you loved about him. Another thrust, then another, until he\u2019d got bored of that and started to move faster, his thrusts slower and softer but feeling no less pleasurable.</p><p>No words were exchanged between the two of you like there was usually. It was just the sound of your cunt swallowing him greedily, and his kisses pressing against your skin. He played with your clit to get you to cum a second time, making sure that you got everything you needed before he even started to chase his own orgasm. And, when you came the second time, everything seemed to freeze. Your body, time, the world. All you could feel was him inside you and how good he\u2019d made you feel.</p><p>Namjoon came inside you, something you\u2019d only ever let him do a handful of times. He didn\u2019t pull out immediately either, instead, he collapsed onto you leaving his cock in your cunt and his head in your neck. He breathed in your scent, fingertips traced your skin. It was almost as if he was memorising your body a second time, getting to know you once more.</p><p>Haneul, you\u2019d come to learn, had been staying in his uncle Tae\u2019s room. You found this out after Namjoon had fallen asleep next to you on the bed and you\u2019d rushed around the apartment putting your clothes back on before any of his roommates caught you scampering around in the nude. Taehyung was entering the kitchen just as you were putting your top back on, and gave you a look mixed with pity and sadness.</p><p>\u201cYou talked it out then?\u201d He asked. You simply nodded in reply. \u201cWhat did you decide to do? I know Namjoon was worried you might leave him. Is that\u2026?\u201d Tae didn\u2019t finish his question because you\u2019d crumbled and started crying in front of him, something you didn\u2019t want to do. Tae charged towards you, and wrapped you up in his arms, rocking you gently to try and soothe you. He knew that you\u2019d just said goodbye to Namjoon, and he knew how much that would have broken both you and his hyung.</p><p>\u201cHe still loves her, Tae.\u201d You wept.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s always gonna love her. She gave birth to his son. He\u2019s not ever going to forget that is he?\u201d He pushed you away and held onto your shoulders to look at your face. \u201cBut he\u2019s hopelessly in love with you, ___. Fuck, he wouldn\u2019t stop talking about you when you\u2019d first met. And he still doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lied to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he feels like shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not justifying his actions. He should have been clear with you from the start. But don\u2019t give up on what you have.\u201d</p><p>You looked around the kitchen and found that Haneul\u2019s things were still everywhere, meaning he was still here and not with his grandparents. \u201cWhere\u2019s Haneul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my room, asleep. Or he was. I don\u2019t know if he still is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I go see him?\u201d</p><p>Tae nodded and gestured to his bedroom door, one of the partitioned rooms built into the living room. You crept inside, and saw the toddler asleep in a bed far too big for him. The sight alone was enough to make you cry again. He was such a gorgeous, innocent little boy, with a cheeky smile and a sense of humour that was far more intelligent than what a four-year-old boy should have. He was cute and cuddly, and completely obsessed with cars. And he loved the bones off you, even you could see it. Which made this tougher.</p><p>Selfishly, you knelt down beside him so your faces were level and gently shook him so he woke up. He was like his father and could fall asleep easily, so you knew he\u2019d go back to sleep. His sleepy, big, brown eyes focussed on you and he smiled. \u201cHey, big guy.\u201d You said, rubbing his back.</p><p>\u201c___, you\u2019re back!\u201d He said. His voice was quiet and filled with sleep but he was still so excited to see you.</p><p>\u201cNot for much longer, sweetie. I have to leave soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou leave, or daddy leave? Because when Daddy leaves he\u2019s away for a long time and I get to see grammy and grandpa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be away for a long, long time. So I\u2019ve,\u201d you could feel the lump forming in your throat. You tried to keep it at bay. You couldn\u2019t let him see you cry. \u201cI\u2019ve just come to say goodbye. And tell you that I love you a whole bunch and that I\u2019ll miss you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll still be in Korea. But I just might not visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it because Daddy shouted at you? Because I heard it and he shouldn\u2019t have raised his voice. He always told me I shouldn\u2019t shout at anyone. But you shouted at Daddy too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, big guy. We didn\u2019t mean to upset you. I promise you, it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d Haneul nodded. \u201cRight, you\u2019ve got playgroup in the morning, haven\u2019t you? So, you\u2019d better get back to sleep.\u201d You tucked him back in and watched him get settled in bed. \u201cI love you, big guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>You placed one final kiss on the top of his head and then left the room, collapsing onto the sofa and crying as quietly as you could. Taehyung was sat on the sofa opposite you, he\u2019d heard everything that you\u2019d said and was crying himself.</p><p>\u201cSo this really is goodbye?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Tae. I can\u2019t do this anymore. Look after each other, yeah?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung nodded and gave you another hug, rubbing your back as he held you tightly. He couldn\u2019t understand why you were leaving, but he knew it was something you felt you needed to do, so he couldn\u2019t force you to stay. Instead, he helped you into your coat, gave you one last hug and said goodbye to you. Hoping it wasn\u2019t for the last time.</p><p>Namjoon\u2019s alarm buzzed at 6:30 the next morning. He switched it off, turned over to wrap his arm around you to find you\u2019d gone. Your clothes were missing from his apartment which meant you took off some time during the night. His heart shattered for the final time that day.</p><p>Your alarm went off at 8. The bed was cold next to you and your eyes were still stinging from the amount you\u2019d cried last night. The tears started up once more when your alarm had switched off from your phone and you saw your lock screen.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"698\" data-orig-height=\"1200\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/374bfda68e278c93b5ef36160158e03c/tumblr_inline_pqzs1lPjNZ1wcljpr_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"698\" data-orig-height=\"1200\"></figure></p>",

The next you were falling from the skies, trying to clutch onto everything you\u2019d built within the last year, yet there was nothing.</p><p>You didn\u2019t see Jungkook for the rest of the day. You\u2019d switched your phone off during the photoshoot so that you wouldn\u2019t be disturbed, so at nine o'clock when you turned your phone back on, you were bombarded with notifications, missed calls and text messages from all seven members of Bangtan, not just Namjoon. Everything felt so strange, and you couldn\u2019t quite figure out what was wrong.</p>[[MORE]]<p>You jumped at your phone ringing, not expecting the sudden loud noise and pop up. It was Namjoon. \u201c___?\u201d He asked immediately. His voice was deep and cracking.</p><p>\u201cJoonie, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh thank God. Have you seen the news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you when you come to mine. Please don\u2019t check anywhere online.

Tell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sending Yongsik with the car to come and pick you up. He\u2019s almost there. You know I love you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I love you too.\u201d</p><p>Namjoon didn\u2019t say goodbye. You had suspicions that he was crying so he couldn\u2019t say it. You were terrified to say the least. You had no idea what was going on but all you knew was that something bad had happened and he wasn\u2019t telling you what it was. You could have screamed in frustration. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"622\" data-orig-height=\"1072\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f86f02f9b5c8600712ab087137e1c8e8/tumblr_inline_pqzs0qnCr11wcljpr_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"622\" data-orig-height=\"1072\"></figure><p>50 missed calls from Namjoon, 100 texts. Situated in the middle of the notification centre was the dreaded article that Namjoon had asked you not to look at. But you did. You saw the headline. And there was no going back now. You pressed the notification leading to the article, your heart pounding in your chest and tears threatening to spill over. This can\u2019t be true. There must be some kind of mistake. Haneul\u2019s mum died when he was 15-months, you were sure of it. Namjoon told you so.</p><p>The article told you everything you didn\u2019t want to know. Haneul\u2019s name was right there in digitally printed letters, along with a photograph of him being held by Namjoon when he was a baby. Namjoon and his partner at the time\u2026 wait\u2026 Minji? This can\u2019t be right. Why was Minji there at Haneul\u2019s birth? Unless\u2026 no\u2026 it couldn\u2019t be. Tears streamed from your eyes as you continued to read the article. Someone you considered to be a friend spouting the biggest bullshit you\u2019ve seen in a while all about the two men in your life whom you absolutely adored. She told everyone that she and Haneul and her were incredibly close and that she was about to give love a second try with Namjoon. They were due to split with their current partners to be together. That was when your heart broke. Namjoon had called you to break up with you. He\u2019d called you out of courtesy. You weren\u2019t supposed to read the article because he wanted to tell you in person. At least he was decent, you couldn\u2019t deny that.</p><p>When Yongsik pulled up, everything inside you was screaming to not get into the car. Your brain was telling you to run towards the nearest train station and stay on it until the last stop, which you very nearly did. But your loyalty to the man who hadn\u2019t shown the same to you was too strong, and you needed answers that running away wouldn\u2019t give you. So you got into Yongsik\u2019s car, and watched as Seoul drove by, the nightscape drenched in the rain providing the perfect backdrop for your mood. Everything hurt. Your eyes, your heart. And what didn\u2019t hurt felt empty, and numb. Your teeth were tingling with the amount you\u2019d cried with an open mouth.</p><p>Yongsik kept looking at you in his rear-view mirror. You could tell he wanted to say something, but it wasn\u2019t his job to. He knew exactly why you were crying, and you could see the pity in his eyes. This angered you. You didn\u2019t want to be pitied. You didn\u2019t want anyone to feel sorry for you because your boyfriend had broken up with you via media so he could get back with his dead ex-partner and play happy families.</p><p>When you pulled up to Namjoon\u2019s building, you took your time getting out the car and walking up to the front door. You punched the number into the door, kicked your shoes off and made your way to the living area, your coat remaining on your body to allow you a quicker getaway.</p><p>You could see Namjoon sat there, eyes red raw from crying and his leg bouncing nervously as he waited for you. When he looked up, he saw you, your face mimicking his making him wonder if he was looking into a mirror. He knew as soon as he\u2019d seen the makeup running down your face that you\u2019d done what he\u2019d asked you not to do and read the article.</p><p>\u201cYou lied to me.\u201d Your voice was quieter than you wanted it to be, but loud enough for Namjoon to hear it, and even flinch at the pain present in your voice. \u201cYou told me she was dead.\u201d</p><p>Namjoon shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t. I just told you she left. You came to the conclusion she died.\u201d</p><p>Your anger burst out of you suddenly. \u201cSo this is <i>my </i>fault? If you knew I thought she\u2019d died, Namjoon, then why didn\u2019t you correct me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause as far as I was concerned, she was dead. She hadn\u2019t bothered with me or Haneul in <i>years</i>! Why would I say to you, \u2018oh, by the way, Minji might come back after abandoning her son any day now, so expect that\u2019, when as far as I was aware, she was in Busan screwing some fucking English teacher who she later married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still should have corrected me, Namjoon! You should have told me that she was still alive and that I was wrong! At least this wouldn\u2019t have hurt as much as it does!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry for that. I just thought I was doing the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell clearly you thought wrong.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Namjoon agreed with you. He couldn\u2019t say another word. He just watched you take a seat on the couch opposite him. You cleared your throat and broke the silence again.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this. If you kept her hidden from me, what else have you kept hidden from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, I swear.\u201d</p><p>You began to sob. \u201cHow can I believe that, Joon? How do I know that our entire relationship hasn\u2019t been built on secrets and mistakes? How can I trust you again? Us? How?\u201d</p><p>He was crying too, watching your heart break was ripping him to shreds. \u201cDon\u2019t say that. We\u2026 we can get through this. Please don\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we? I don\u2019t know who you are. I could cope with the fans and the news articles about me. I could cope with the long days in the studio and you coming home exhausted from dance practise. I could cope with taking care of Haneul like he was my own, in fact, that was one of the things I loved most. Him. And you. I can\u2019t cope with this, Joon. You should have told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I should have and I\u2019m so sorry. There aren\u2019t any words to tell you just how sorry I am. I will to anything, <i>anything </i>to make it up to you. You tell me what it is and I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to get back with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I have you.\u201d He got on his knees and crawled over to you, grabbing hold of your hand and holding it tightly. \u201cWhy would I want <i>her </i>when I have you? A beautiful,\u201d he kissed your hand, \u201ckind,\u201d his lips travelled upwards, \u201cfunny,\u201d each word he punctuated with a kiss further up your body, \u201csweet, amazing, smart, talented woman? You make me so happy every single day, ___. I wake up each morning with my son one side of me and my stunning girlfriend the other side and I can\u2019t believe just how fucking lucky I am. I love you so fucking much I feel like my heart could burst.\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t want to ask this question. You shouldn\u2019t have. You knew you wouldn\u2019t like the answer so you should have just kept it to yourself, joined him on the floor and kissed him. You should have told him that everything would be okay and that you\u2019d stay with him no matter what. But you didn\u2019t. You opened your mouth and regretted it immediately. \u201cDo you still love her?\u201d Namjoon sat back and looked away from you. He didn\u2019t say anything. You could tell he was sat there trying to think of a way to answer your question. His non-immediate answer was the final straw. \u201cGoodbye, Namjoon.\u201d</p><p>You stood and walked towards the door. You heard him stand and run towards you. He ran in front of you and put his hands on either side of the wall to block your path to the front door. \u201cNo, please don\u2019t do this. I\u2019m begging you, ___. Don\u2019t leave us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of my way, Namjoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNamjoon, move!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>You tried to push passed him but it was useless. He was too strong for you. His large hands grabbed hold of your shoulders and pushed you against the wall. You didn\u2019t have time to fight back as his lips were on yours, pinning you there in a passionate kiss. All teeth and tongues but it was somehow everything you needed at that time. Your brain was telling you to push him away and leave him in the hallway. But your body and your heart was letting him unzip your coat and throw it to the floor. Your body was allowing him to press open mouthed kisses to your neck as he removed your jeans. Allowed him to drop to his knees and put his tongue on you while you were still pressed to the wall, hands in his hair and wet eyes closing in pure pleasure as his plump lips wrapped around your clit and sucked in the way you loved. He\u2019d spent so many nights with you, he knew exactly how to push your buttons and make you feel absolutely amazing. And tonight was no exception.</p><p>He slipped two fingers passed your entrance, diving deep into your wetness and making you sing. He started to stroke you in that way that hit your spot, your hips bucking at the sensation and soon enough you were cumming around his mouth, gasping for oxygen and tugging at his hair.</p><p>He didn\u2019t give you time to come down, he rarely did when he was this worked up. Instead, he kissed you, and dragged you into his bedroom, throwing your clothes and his all over the apartment for a worry at a later time. As soon as you were in, he closed the door and his lips locked onto yours, pushing you towards the bed and falling on top of you.</p><p>Whenever Namjoon was inside you, regardless of the mood or the kind of sex you were having, it always felt right. Tonight, despite saying goodbye, was no exception. As he entered you, he looked into your eyes as he always did, thrusted in and watched your face as you stretched around him, the burn feeling exquisite to both of you. One thrust in, hard, deep, nearly hitting your cervix, earning one loud moan from you and a grunt from him. He could never keep quiet during sex, something you loved about him. Another thrust, then another, until he\u2019d got bored of that and started to move faster, his thrusts slower and softer but feeling no less pleasurable.</p><p>No words were exchanged between the two of you like there was usually. It was just the sound of your cunt swallowing him greedily, and his kisses pressing against your skin. He played with your clit to get you to cum a second time, making sure that you got everything you needed before he even started to chase his own orgasm. And, when you came the second time, everything seemed to freeze. Your body, time, the world. All you could feel was him inside you and how good he\u2019d made you feel.</p><p>Namjoon came inside you, something you\u2019d only ever let him do a handful of times. He didn\u2019t pull out immediately either, instead, he collapsed onto you leaving his cock in your cunt and his head in your neck. He breathed in your scent, fingertips traced your skin. It was almost as if he was memorising your body a second time, getting to know you once more.</p><p>Haneul, you\u2019d come to learn, had been staying in his uncle Tae\u2019s room. You found this out after Namjoon had fallen asleep next to you on the bed and you\u2019d rushed around the apartment putting your clothes back on before any of his roommates caught you scampering around in the nude. Taehyung was entering the kitchen just as you were putting your top back on, and gave you a look mixed with pity and sadness.</p><p>\u201cYou talked it out then?\u201d He asked. You simply nodded in reply. \u201cWhat did you decide to do? I know Namjoon was worried you might leave him. Is that\u2026?\u201d Tae didn\u2019t finish his question because you\u2019d crumbled and started crying in front of him, something you didn\u2019t want to do. Tae charged towards you, and wrapped you up in his arms, rocking you gently to try and soothe you. He knew that you\u2019d just said goodbye to Namjoon, and he knew how much that would have broken both you and his hyung.</p><p>\u201cHe still loves her, Tae.\u201d You wept.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s always gonna love her. She gave birth to his son. He\u2019s not ever going to forget that is he?\u201d He pushed you away and held onto your shoulders to look at your face. \u201cBut he\u2019s hopelessly in love with you, ___. Fuck, he wouldn\u2019t stop talking about you when you\u2019d first met. And he still doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lied to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he feels like shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not justifying his actions. He should have been clear with you from the start. But don\u2019t give up on what you have.\u201d</p><p>You looked around the kitchen and found that Haneul\u2019s things were still everywhere, meaning he was still here and not with his grandparents. \u201cWhere\u2019s Haneul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my room, asleep. Or he was. I don\u2019t know if he still is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I go see him?\u201d</p><p>Tae nodded and gestured to his bedroom door, one of the partitioned rooms built into the living room. You crept inside, and saw the toddler asleep in a bed far too big for him. The sight alone was enough to make you cry again. He was such a gorgeous, innocent little boy, with a cheeky smile and a sense of humour that was far more intelligent than what a four-year-old boy should have. He was cute and cuddly, and completely obsessed with cars. And he loved the bones off you, even you could see it. Which made this tougher.</p><p>Selfishly, you knelt down beside him so your faces were level and gently shook him so he woke up. He was like his father and could fall asleep easily, so you knew he\u2019d go back to sleep. His sleepy, big, brown eyes focussed on you and he smiled. \u201cHey, big guy.\u201d You said, rubbing his back.</p><p>\u201c___, you\u2019re back!\u201d He said. His voice was quiet and filled with sleep but he was still so excited to see you.</p><p>\u201cNot for much longer, sweetie. I have to leave soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou leave, or daddy leave? Because when Daddy leaves he\u2019s away for a long time and I get to see grammy and grandpa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be away for a long, long time. So I\u2019ve,\u201d you could feel the lump forming in your throat. You tried to keep it at bay. You couldn\u2019t let him see you cry. \u201cI\u2019ve just come to say goodbye. And tell you that I love you a whole bunch and that I\u2019ll miss you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll still be in Korea. But I just might not visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it because Daddy shouted at you? Because I heard it and he shouldn\u2019t have raised his voice. He always told me I shouldn\u2019t shout at anyone. But you shouted at Daddy too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, big guy. We didn\u2019t mean to upset you. I promise you, it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d Haneul nodded. \u201cRight, you\u2019ve got playgroup in the morning, haven\u2019t you? So, you\u2019d better get back to sleep.\u201d You tucked him back in and watched him get settled in bed. \u201cI love you, big guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>You placed one final kiss on the top of his head and then left the room, collapsing onto the sofa and crying as quietly as you could. Taehyung was sat on the sofa opposite you, he\u2019d heard everything that you\u2019d said and was crying himself.</p><p>\u201cSo this really is goodbye?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Tae. I can\u2019t do this anymore. Look after each other, yeah?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung nodded and gave you another hug, rubbing your back as he held you tightly. He couldn\u2019t understand why you were leaving, but he knew it was something you felt you needed to do, so he couldn\u2019t force you to stay. Instead, he helped you into your coat, gave you one last hug and said goodbye to you. Hoping it wasn\u2019t for the last time.</p><p>Namjoon\u2019s alarm buzzed at 6:30 the next morning. He switched it off, turned over to wrap his arm around you to find you\u2019d gone. Your clothes were missing from his apartment which meant you took off some time during the night. His heart shattered for the final time that day.</p><p>Your alarm went off at 8. The bed was cold next to you and your eyes were still stinging from the amount you\u2019d cried last night. The tears started up once more when your alarm had switched off from your phone and you saw your lock screen.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"698\" data-orig-height=\"1200\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/374bfda68e278c93b5ef36160158e03c/tumblr_inline_pqzs1lPjNZ1wcljpr_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"698\" data-orig-height=\"1200\"></figure></p>",

The next you were falling from the skies, trying to clutch onto everything you&rsquo;d built within the last year, yet there was nothing.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t see Jungkook for the rest of the day. You&rsquo;d switched your phone off during the photoshoot so that you wouldn&rsquo;t be disturbed, so at nine o'clock when you turned your phone back on, you were bombarded with notifications, missed calls and text messages from all seven members of Bangtan, not just Namjoon. Everything felt so strange, and you couldn&rsquo;t quite figure out what was wrong.</p><p>You jumped at your phone ringing, not expecting the sudden loud noise and pop up. It was Namjoon. &ldquo;___?&rdquo; He asked immediately. His voice was deep and cracking.</p><p>&ldquo;Joonie, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh thank God. Have you seen the news?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you when you come to mine. Please don&rsquo;t check anywhere online. This is something that needs to come from me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Namjoon, you&rsquo;re scaring me. Tell me what&rsquo;s wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sending Yongsik with the car to come and pick you up. He&rsquo;s almost there. You know I love you, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course. I love you too.&rdquo;</p><p>Namjoon didn&rsquo;t say goodbye. You had suspicions that he was crying so he couldn&rsquo;t say it. You were terrified to say the least. You had no idea what was going on but all you knew was that something bad had happened and he wasn&rsquo;t telling you what it was. You could have screamed in frustration. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f86f02f9b5c8600712ab087137e1c8e8/tumblr_inline_pqzs0qnCr11wcljpr_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>50 missed calls from Namjoon, 100 texts. Situated in the middle of the notification centre was the dreaded article that Namjoon had asked you not to look at. But you did. You saw the headline. And there was no going back now. You pressed the notification leading to the article, your heart pounding in your chest and tears threatening to spill over. This can&rsquo;t be true. There must be some kind of mistake. Haneul&rsquo;s mum died when he was 15-months, you were sure of it. Namjoon told you so.</p><p>The article told you everything you didn&rsquo;t want to know. Haneul&rsquo;s name was right there in digitally printed letters, along with a photograph of him being held by Namjoon when he was a baby. Namjoon and his partner at the time&hellip; wait&hellip; Minji? This can&rsquo;t be right. Why was Minji there at Haneul&rsquo;s birth? Unless&hellip; no&hellip; it couldn&rsquo;t be. Tears streamed from your eyes as you continued to read the article. Someone you considered to be a friend spouting the biggest bullshit you&rsquo;ve seen in a while all about the two men in your life whom you absolutely adored. She told everyone that she and Haneul and her were incredibly close and that she was about to give love a second try with Namjoon. They were due to split with their current partners to be together. That was when your heart broke. Namjoon had called you to break up with you. He&rsquo;d called you out of courtesy. You weren&rsquo;t supposed to read the article because he wanted to tell you in person. At least he was decent, you couldn&rsquo;t deny that.</p><p>When Yongsik pulled up, everything inside you was screaming to not get into the car. Your brain was telling you to run towards the nearest train station and stay on it until the last stop, which you very nearly did. But your loyalty to the man who hadn&rsquo;t shown the same to you was too strong, and you needed answers that running away wouldn&rsquo;t give you. So you got into Yongsik&rsquo;s car, and watched as Seoul drove by, the nightscape drenched in the rain providing the perfect backdrop for your mood. Everything hurt. Your eyes, your heart. And what didn&rsquo;t hurt felt empty, and numb. Your teeth were tingling with the amount you&rsquo;d cried with an open mouth.</p><p>Yongsik kept looking at you in his rear-view mirror. You could tell he wanted to say something, but it wasn&rsquo;t his job to. He knew exactly why you were crying, and you could see the pity in his eyes. This angered you. You didn&rsquo;t want to be pitied. You didn&rsquo;t want anyone to feel sorry for you because your boyfriend had broken up with you via media so he could get back with his dead ex-partner and play happy families.</p><p>When you pulled up to Namjoon&rsquo;s building, you took your time getting out the car and walking up to the front door. You punched the number into the door, kicked your shoes off and made your way to the living area, your coat remaining on your body to allow you a quicker getaway.</p><p>You could see Namjoon sat there, eyes red raw from crying and his leg bouncing nervously as he waited for you. When he looked up, he saw you, your face mimicking his making him wonder if he was looking into a mirror. He knew as soon as he&rsquo;d seen the makeup running down your face that you&rsquo;d done what he&rsquo;d asked you not to do and read the article.</p><p>&ldquo;You lied to me.&rdquo; Your voice was quieter than you wanted it to be, but loud enough for Namjoon to hear it, and even flinch at the pain present in your voice. &ldquo;You told me she was dead.&rdquo;</p><p>Namjoon shook his head. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t. I just told you she left. You came to the conclusion she died.&rdquo;</p><p>Your anger burst out of you suddenly. &ldquo;So this is <i>my </i>fault? If you knew I thought she&rsquo;d died, Namjoon, then why didn&rsquo;t you correct me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because as far as I was concerned, she was dead. She hadn&rsquo;t bothered with me or Haneul in <i>years</i>! Why would I say to you, &lsquo;oh, by the way, Minji might come back after abandoning her son any day now, so expect that&rsquo;, when as far as I was aware, she was in Busan screwing some fucking English teacher who she later married?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You still should have corrected me, Namjoon!

He&rsquo;s not ever going to forget that is he?&rdquo; He pushed you away and held onto your shoulders to look at your face. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s hopelessly in love with you, ___. Fuck, he wouldn&rsquo;t stop talking about you when you&rsquo;d first met. And he still doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He lied to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And he feels like shit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So do I!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not justifying his actions. He should have been clear with you from the start. But don&rsquo;t give up on what you have.&rdquo;</p><p>You looked around the kitchen and found that Haneul&rsquo;s things were still everywhere, meaning he was still here and not with his grandparents. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Haneul?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In my room, asleep. Or he was. I don&rsquo;t know if he still is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can I go see him?&rdquo;</p><p>Tae nodded and gestured to his bedroom door, one of the partitioned rooms built into the living room. You crept inside, and saw the toddler asleep in a bed far too big for him. The sight alone was enough to make you cry again. He was such a gorgeous, innocent little boy, with a cheeky smile and a sense of humour that was far more intelligent than what a four-year-old boy should have. He was cute and cuddly, and completely obsessed with cars. And he loved the bones off you, even you could see it. Which made this tougher.</p><p>Selfishly, you knelt down beside him so your faces were level and gently shook him so he woke up. He was like his father and could fall asleep easily, so you knew he&rsquo;d go back to sleep. His sleepy, big, brown eyes focussed on you and he smiled. &ldquo;Hey, big guy.&rdquo; You said, rubbing his back.</p><p>&ldquo;___, you&rsquo;re back!&rdquo; He said. His voice was quiet and filled with sleep but he was still so excited to see you.</p><p>&ldquo;Not for much longer, sweetie. I have to leave soon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You leave, or daddy leave? Because when Daddy leaves he&rsquo;s away for a long time and I get to see grammy and grandpa.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be away for a long, long time. So I&rsquo;ve,&rdquo; you could feel the lump forming in your throat. You tried to keep it at bay. You couldn&rsquo;t let him see you cry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just come to say goodbye. And tell you that I love you a whole bunch and that I&rsquo;ll miss you so much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll still be in Korea. But I just might not visit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it because Daddy shouted at you? Because I heard it and he shouldn&rsquo;t have raised his voice. He always told me I shouldn&rsquo;t shout at anyone. But you shouted at Daddy too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, big guy. We didn&rsquo;t mean to upset you. I promise you, it won&rsquo;t happen again.&rdquo; Haneul nodded. &ldquo;Right, you&rsquo;ve got playgroup in the morning, haven&rsquo;t you? So, you&rsquo;d better get back to sleep.&rdquo; You tucked him back in and watched him get settled in bed. &ldquo;I love you, big guy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo;</p><p>You placed one final kiss on the top of his head and then left the room, collapsing onto the sofa and crying as quietly as you could. Taehyung was sat on the sofa opposite you, he&rsquo;d heard everything that you&rsquo;d said and was crying himself.</p><p>&ldquo;So this really is goodbye?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Tae. I can&rsquo;t do this anymore. Look after each other, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung nodded and gave you another hug, rubbing your back as he held you tightly. He couldn&rsquo;t understand why you were leaving, but he knew it was something you felt you needed to do, so he couldn&rsquo;t force you to stay. Instead, he helped you into your coat, gave you one last hug and said goodbye to you. Hoping it wasn&rsquo;t for the last time.</p><p>Namjoon&rsquo;s alarm buzzed at 6:30 the next morning. He switched it off, turned over to wrap his arm around you to find you&rsquo;d gone. Your clothes were missing from his apartment which meant you took off some time during the night. His heart shattered for the final time that day.</p><p>Your alarm went off at 8. The bed was cold next to you and your eyes were still stinging from the amount you&rsquo;d cried last night. The tears started up once more when your alarm had switched off from your phone and you saw your lock screen.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/374bfda68e278c93b5ef36160158e03c/tumblr_inline_pqzs1lPjNZ1wcljpr_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure></p>",

You&rsquo;d switched your phone off during the photoshoot so that you wouldn&rsquo;t be disturbed, so at nine o'clock when you turned your phone back on, you were bombarded with notifications, missed calls and text messages from all seven members of Bangtan, not just Namjoon.
