Peter momentarily forgets that the battle of their lives is currently raging around him, that there are three angry monster-alien things trying to eat him. His spidey-senses, which have been screaming danger ever since he woke up on Titan, are dialling down.</p><p>Peter staggers to his feet and spins around in a circle, trying to figure out why his spidey-senses aren\u2019t working and where the alien monsters are. But the monsters he was fighting just a few seconds ago are gone. What happened?</p><p>Then, Peter realizes that it\u2019s quiet. Way too quiet. Quieter than when Flash talked back to Mr. Mac in physics class. His mask suddenly retracts and Peter is breathing in the strong smell of smoke.<br/>Peter sees it. All around him, the monster-alien hybrids are fading. They\u2019re turning dusty just like Peter did on Titan. They\u2019re all fading, and oh, no, it\u2019s happening again. The last he saw, though, the awesome flying lady had the gauntlet. Did Thanos get it back? Did he win again?</p><p>But then Peter realizes that it\u2019s only the aliens that are fading, no one else. Everyone else is fine, solid, and not dusty. It\u2019s only the bad guys that are disappearing. Hope blossoms in Peter\u2019s chest. They did it. They finally won.</p><p>Peter sees everyone grouping together a few yards away and half runs over to them. But all of his hope wilts like a drying rose when he sees what \u2013 or, more accurately, who \u2013 everyone is grouping around.

Peter takes in the Iron Man suit, charred and sparking, and the right arm of the suit half melted away to reveal Tony\u2019s real arm inside.

Peter instinctively grasps it and pulls his mentor to his feet.</p><p>\u201cI \u2013 are you okay?\u201d Peter asks, because he doesn\u2019t know what else to say.

He lets go of Tony and turns around to see everyone looking at them with varying expressions. Peter sees Captain America staring at them with absolutely nothing but relief. Pepper is smiling at them tearfully and Rhodey has an arm around Tony\u2019s shoulders now.

He has to say goodbye.</p><p>There\u2019s a pause. \u201cYeah, kid, I know,\u201d Tony says dryly, and it shocks Peter so much he stumbles a little. Mister Stark\u2019s eyes are focused and his voice is steady. Tears that had welled up in Peter\u2019s wide eyes fall down his cheeks. He stares at Tony. He looks \u2013 he looks fine.</p><p>\u201cWe won, Mister Stark,\u201d Peter says finally. His mind can\u2019t catch up. Just in case this is false hope, or wishful thinking, or something \u2013 Tony has to know that they won, and that it\u2019s okay now. \u201cWe did it. We won.\u201d<br>\u201cYeah, I sure hope we did,\u201d Tony says. \u201cThose stones fried my suit. Now I know what it feels like to get sizzled. Never eating bacon again. I sympathize too much now.\u201d</p><p>Peter blinks at him in pure shock. Tony snorts. \u201cHelp me up, kid, will you?\u201d He reaches his hand up. Peter instinctively grasps it and pulls his mentor to his feet.</p><p>\u201cI \u2013 are you okay?\u201d Peter asks, because he doesn\u2019t know what else to say.

He\u2019s okay. Before Peter\u2019s mind can even realize what his body is doing, he\u2019s wrapping his arms around Tony and hugging him tightly.

This is nice, he thinks, just like their hug from earlier.</p><p>Peter hears a cough from somewhere behind him and remembers that everyone is still there. He lets go of Tony and turns around to see everyone looking at them with varying expressions. Peter sees Captain America staring at them with absolutely nothing but relief. Pepper is smiling at them tearfully and Rhodey has an arm around Tony\u2019s shoulders now. The awesome flying lady is staring at them too, and even though her face is devoid of emotion, Peter can see the spark in her eyes.

        "answer": "<p>\u201cPeter!\u201d You yell at him as he flies through one of the portals, he looks down and sees you waving your arms around like a\u00a0Wacky Waving Inflatable Arm Flailing Tube Man. He laughs at you before coming down and landing beside you.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019ve missed you. I went to space and it\u2019s epic! I wish you came with me, except the whole turning to dust thing and sitting on that planet for five years, that part sucked.\u201d He says excitedly before telling you how boring it was without you.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHey! I turned to ash as well, except in Wakanda. After you and Tony left, Bruce called Steve and then we had this big meet-up saving Vision and Wanda, and then went to Wakanda\u2014which was sick, by the way\u2014and then after Thanos came I turned into ash.\u201d You explain fast and out of breath.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You two hug, something you\u2019ve missed doing for five years. Even though, you two fight all the time about the lamest things, you missed having him around as much as he annoys you.\u00a0\u201cWow! Peter!\u201d You pull away from the hug and look up to see a gauntlet flying over your heads. Peter yells out that he\u2019s got it before returning to the fight. You follow him, taking out as many of Thanos\u2019 army as you can, having Peter\u2019s back.\u00a0</p><p>You finish killing a weird looking creature before looking up and not seeing Peter. <i>Panic</i>, runs through your whole body. You just got him back, you can\u2019t lose him again.\u00a0\u201cNo, no, no, Peter!\u201d You scream out to him but the fight is too loud now to hear anything else.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey! Follow me,\u201d a woman on a flying horse says kindly, giving her hand out to you. <i>She\u2019s beautiful,</i>\u00a0you think before taking her hand. <i>She\u2019s a Valkyrie,</i>\u00a0you piece together in your head. You had heard stories about them from Thor and Loki, they made a huge impact on their lives. According to Thor, he always wanted to be a Valkyrie when he grew up. You always laughed at him when he said that.<br/></p><p>As she flies over thousands on people fighting, you eyes narrow in on a group down below. All women teaming up for what? Then you see him red and blue suit that Tony gave to him. \u201cPeter!\u201d You scream happily.\u00a0</p><p>After the women go, you and Peter keep on fighting for what seems like an eternity, until, they all start to turn to dust, much like you did five years ago.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark?\u201d Peter\u2019s voice almost fails him. You turn around and see Tony leaning up against a piece of rubble, barely hanging onto life.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You stand beside Steve, not wanting to intrude on their moment. Although, you had known Tony personally, you felt more distant from him than ever after you spent five years in some weird realm, with majority of Steve\u2019s team. You became much closer to Sam and Bucky. You felt a nudge on your shoulder pulling you out of your thought. Steve slightly nudges you towards Tony. Slowly, you make you way over to his side next to Peter.</p><p>\u201cHey, Tony,\u201d you say softly.\u00a0\u201cWe won and I just want to thank you for everything you\u2019ve done\u2026 for me and this world. You\u2019re a legend. You did it, Tony, you did it.\u201d you softly cry but manage to get your words to him. He manages to look at you and give you a soft smile.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You gently pull Peter back, letting Pepper have her time with Tony, knowing it will be her last.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be okay, Pete.
