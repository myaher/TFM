Now he could only count on his own judgement that she wasn\u2019t going to kill him once he got out of there.</i></p><p>&hellip;</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Harry asked the doctor once the man walked out of the room but Y/N wasn\u2019t with him.<br/></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d the middle-aged man said with a gentle smile, making Harry feel more at ease.\u00a0\u201cThe girl\u00a0got food poisoning, not very serious so I\u2019ve already given her some pills. Let her stay here for an hour to see if she feels any better then she can go.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThank you, doctor\u201d replied Harry as he shook the doctor\u2019s hand then watched the man walk away. He intended to go into the room to check on his new assistant immediately, but the moment he grabbed the doorknob, the phone in his pocket buzzed to notify him of a new text. It was from his manager Jeffrey.</p><ul><li><i>Hey are you alright?</i></li></ul><p>Harry furrowed his eyebrows as he read the question.</p><ul><li><b>I\u2019m fine, I\u2019m still at the hospital with Y/N. Why?</b><br/></li><li><i>You haven\u2019t seen the pictures?</i><br/></li><li><b>What pictures?</b><br/></li></ul><p>Jeff left Harry\u2019s latest message at seen so Harry had to find out on his own. He immediately went on social media (it\u2019s sad how this was his first guess)\u00a0and the first thing he saw was an article published by an online magazine with all the pictures of his girlfriend making out with another man.</p><h2><i>Lillie Xander caught kissing a new man!!! Yikes! How does Harry Styles feel about this?</i></h2><p>For that one second, Harry almost stopped breathing. He wished those photos hadn\u2019t been real, that they\u2019d been photoshopped and his girlfriend of two years hadn\u2019t cheated on him. However, reality sucked, and he felt like a fool.</p><p>Harry was still staring at his phone when the door flew open all of a sudden and slammed with hard against his left arm! The girl behind it immediately mumbled her apology and she looked more frightened when she recognized who he was.</p><p>\u201cHey, shouldn\u2019t you be lying down?\u201d Harry asked Y/N while rubbing the sore spot on his arm, making his new assistant feel extremely guilty. Not only had she made him drive her all the way to the hospital and thrown up on his expensive jacket, but she also slammed him with the door. She was so in trouble after this.<br/></p><p>\u201cAm I fired?\u201d she stared at him with her sad puppy dog eyes, and it took Harry a moment to take it in before he burst into laughter.</p><p>\u201cYou honestly thought I was going to fire you for being sick on your first day?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd for destroying your Gucci jacket and not being able to buy another one for you even if I sold myself.\u201d She rolled her eyes backward and groaned out loud.\u00a0\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with me? I can\u2019t get anything right.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cHey, hey, hey.\u201d Harry caught her by surprise when he grabbed her arms, holding her firmly place so she would look at his face.\u00a0</p><p>Y/N turned to stone the very moment she made eye-contact with her new boss. Suddenly, everything started playing in slow-motion as she fell into the loop of his intense stare.\u00a0Despite having already seen plenty photos of this man, Y/N\u00a0was certain that wasn\u2019t the reason why she found those green eyes of his so familiar. She had seen them somewhere else before she just couldn\u2019t remember where exactly. It wasn\u2019t just a feeling that\u00a0\u2018<i>I met you once on the street but I remember you because you\u2019re gorgeous</i>\u2019, it was more like\u00a0\u2018<i>we don\u2019t know each other\u00a0but I feel like we have for a really long time.</i>\u2019\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHave we met?\u201d Harry was the one to ask that question, and not Y/N, which shocked her even more when she fell out of the maze that was his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve remembered, trust me,\u201d she said, chuckling dryly as her eyes stayed on his.<br/></p><p>\u201cWeird&hellip;\u201d Harry mumbled to himself, shaking his head then immediately put on a smile. \u201cWell, don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not fired, and I\u2019m not mad at you for anything that\u2019s happened this morning.\u201d</p><p>For some reason she couldn\u2019t explain, Y/N knew that smile wasn\u2019t sincere. There was something bothering this man and he was just so used covering up his emotions that he did it like a pro. He couldn\u2019t fool her though.</p><p>However, she didn\u2019t say anything about that, and just smiled back at him.\u00a0\u201cThank you so much. I can\u2019t lose another job again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d Harry looked at her, quite amused.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve been fired before.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t fired, I quit my last job&hellip;But I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not interested in my boring life stories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am interested,\u201d he told her without pause.\u00a0\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go somewhere later and you tell me about that awful job that you quit? If we\u2019re going to be working close to each other, we should get to know each other, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure? Because in the schedule Jeff sent me\u2014\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s<i> my</i> schedule, I can cancel any plan I want. Jeff\u2019s my manager, not my boss.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s mine.\u201d<br/></p><p>Harry chuckled while shaking his head no.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s not, I am. He can\u2019t fire you unless I tell him too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s powerful.\u201d The words slipped out before Y/N can stop her lips. \u201cShit&hellip;did I just say that?\u201d</p><p>Her face scrunched up in embarrassment when Harry let out a slight laugh.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I like you already. I think we\u2019re gonna be a good team.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cHope so.\u201d Y/N looked up as her eyes sparkled with joy.\u00a0\u201cShall we go now?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, the doctor told me to keep you here for an hour.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine now, just ignore\u00a0the doctor.\u201d She snorted then just walked right past Harry to the nearest exit.\u00a0</p><p>He stayed at the same spot, watching her marching down the hall with his mouth agape, then when she noticed he wasn\u2019t following her she stopped and turned around, looking all confused.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you waiting for? Hurry!\u201d<br/></p><p>Harry snapped back to reality as he heard the sound of her voice. Then he shrugged off the foreign feeling in the pit of his stomach and ran forward to catch up with his new assistant.\u00a0</p>",

She had seen them somewhere else before she just couldn\u2019t remember where exactly. It wasn\u2019t just a feeling that\u00a0\u2018<i>I met you once on the street but I remember you because you\u2019re gorgeous</i>\u2019, it was more like\u00a0\u2018<i>we don\u2019t know each other\u00a0but I feel like we have for a really long time.</i>\u2019\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHave we met?\u201d Harry was the one to ask that question, and not Y/N, which shocked her even more when she fell out of the maze that was his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve remembered, trust me,\u201d she said, chuckling dryly as her eyes stayed on his.<br></p><p>\u201cWeird\u2026\u201d Harry mumbled to himself, shaking his head then immediately put on a smile. \u201cWell, don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not fired, and I\u2019m not mad at you for anything that\u2019s happened this morning.\u201d</p><p>For some reason she couldn\u2019t explain, Y/N knew that smile wasn\u2019t sincere.

It must have been the milk she\u2019d drunk earlier that morning, or maybe the microwaved dinner from last night. But it didn\u2019t matter now, the important thing was that her famous boss, whom she\u2019d never actually met before, was waiting in the recording studio, while she was throwing up in this bathroom stall.</p><p>With her head spinning in circle, however, Y/N could still make out a knock on the door.</p><p>\u201cHey, ya alright?\u201d<br></p><p>She should\u2019ve recognized that British voice because she\u2019d spent the entire night before watching his interviews on Youtube to get to know him better. Nonetheless, in a situation like this her memory was helpless.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine\u2026Thanks.\u201d Y/N groaned as she flushed the toilet before rising up from the floor, feeling a bit better but still quite unsure.</p><p>\u201cSir, I don\u2019t think you should be in the ladies\u2019 room,\u201d she told the man on the other side of the door.</p><p>And to her surprise, he replied with a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m in the men\u2019s room.\u201d</p><p>Y/N\u2019s bloodshot eyes grew wide the moment she heard those words. She pulled the door open in an instant, then almost fell backward when she found Harry Styles standing right in front of her. Harry gave the girl a friendly smile, yet when he opened his mouth to speak, she immediately turned away and got back down on her knees to empty her stomach in the toilet bowl.</p><p>In the haze, Y/N could feel Harry kneeling down by her side, gently holding her hair back so it wouldn\u2019t get in the way. It was a lovely gesture, she supposed, but he still had no idea she was his new assistant. </p><p>And the only thing on Y/N\u2019s mind at this very moment was, her first day of this job could also be her last. </p>[[MORE]]<p>\u2026</p><p><i><br></i></p><p><i>The girl in black carefully followed the path leading through the dark woods, with only the light from her oil lantern guiding the way. She was heading home alone, like a shadow under the moonlight, trying not to make a sound as her heart was pounding like a drum.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>The young maiden could\u2019ve got home early that night as she was so close to her village already. However, it was one of her good habits that became her obstacle \u2014 she never walked away from someone in need.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHello?! Can anyone hear me? I\u2019m trapped!\u201d<br></i></p><p><i>Her feet rooted to the ground when she heard the cry for help. The girl already had her guards up, ready to fight for her life, but there was no one around! At first, she thought it was just her imagination, then the desperate call repeated, louder this time. It took her a moment to realize it was coming from a hole on the ground a few steps away from where she stood.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d she asked, carefully approaching the victim. Holding up her lantern above the hollow to get a better look of whoever was down there. When the light flashed across the person\u2019s face, the girl was so terrified that she backed away from the edge.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHello, thank God! Could you please get me out of here?\u201d begged the hopeless young man as he looked up. But this girl knew for certain he wasn\u2019t </i>just <i>a man.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026You\u2019re the Prince!\u201d<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cYou recognize me?\u201d Prince Edward smiled widely as he put both hands on his hips and heaved out a sigh of relief.\u00a0\u201cGreat! Now could you please help me out?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo.\u201d<br></i></p><p><i>Her answer came as a shock to the heir of the throne.</i></p><p><i>\u201cPardon?\u201d he raised an eyebrow for no one had ever talked to him that way beside his father - the King.<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cI said: No. In fact, I\u2019d let you die down there, so your awful father could learn how it feels to lose someone he loves,\u201d she told him bitterly.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of how he burnt down villages because of those rumors about witches. He murdered my entire family. And now you\u2019ve got the audacity to beg for my help?\u201d<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cHey, hey, hey, lady, I don\u2019t know who you are but I swear I knew nothing about those villages. I\u2019m truly sorry about your family, and if you could help me I\u2019d pay you as much as you\u2019d like.\u201d<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t think you could afford it, unless you knew how to resurrect the dead!\u201d The girl turned to walk away, ignoring the young Prince\u2019s pleading from down below. It was getting late and she\u2019d got no time for a conversation with a dying man. However, something occurred to her when she was finally far enough to not hear his voice anymore.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>If she left him there to die, she\u2019d be just as bad as his father.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cYour Highness.\u201d<br></i></p><p><i>Edward shot his face up and grinned widely when he saw the girl had returned. She rolled her eyes skyward then sighed heavily before laying out her bargain,\u00a0\u201cif I save your life, would you do me a favor?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnything!\u201d Edward spoke too soon, after that he realized how risky this agreement could turn out to be and quickly added,\u00a0\u201cwait, if you want to turn me against my father, then I\u2019m sorry I cannot\u00a0give you my word!\u201d<br></i></p><p><i>What he said made the girl laugh, then she assured him,\u00a0</i><i>\u201cyou don\u2019t have to betray your family or your country, I promise. Do we have a deal?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes.\u201d Edward nodded his head in response to the stranger standing on the edge of the hollow, holding his life in the palm of her hand. Now he could only count on his own judgement that she wasn\u2019t going to kill him once he got out of there.</i></p><p>\u2026</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Harry asked the doctor once the man walked out of the room but Y/N wasn\u2019t with him.<br></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d the middle-aged man said with a gentle smile, making Harry feel more at ease.\u00a0\u201cThe girl\u00a0got food poisoning, not very serious so I\u2019ve already given her some pills.

It must have been the milk she&rsquo;d drunk earlier that morning, or maybe the microwaved dinner from last night.

She pulled the door open in an instant, then almost fell backward when she found Harry Styles standing right in front of her. Harry gave the girl a friendly smile, yet when he opened his mouth to speak, she immediately turned away and got back down on her knees to empty her stomach in the toilet bowl.</p><p>In the haze, Y/N could feel Harry kneeling down by her side, gently holding her hair back so it wouldn&rsquo;t get in the way. It was a lovely gesture, she supposed, but he still had no idea she was his new assistant. </p><p>And the only thing on Y/N&rsquo;s mind at this very moment was, her first day of this job could also be her last. </p><p>&hellip;</p><p><i><br /></i></p><p><i>The girl in black carefully followed the path leading through the dark woods, with only the light from her oil lantern guiding the way. She was heading home alone, like a shadow under the moonlight, trying not to make a sound as her heart was pounding like a drum.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>The young maiden could&rsquo;ve got home early that night as she was so close to her village already. However, it was one of her good habits that became her obstacle &mdash; she never walked away from someone in need.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Hello?! Can anyone hear me? I&rsquo;m trapped!&rdquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>Her feet rooted to the ground when she heard the cry for help. The girl already had her guards up, ready to fight for her life, but there was no one around! At first, she thought it was just her imagination, then the desperate call repeated, louder this time. It took her a moment to realize it was coming from a hole on the ground a few steps away from where she stood.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; she asked, carefully approaching the victim. Holding up her lantern above the hollow to get a better look of whoever was down there. When the light flashed across the person&rsquo;s face, the girl was so terrified that she backed away from the edge.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Hello, thank God! Could you please get me out of here?&rdquo; begged the hopeless young man as he looked up. But this girl knew for certain he wasn&rsquo;t </i>just <i>a man.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re&hellip;You&rsquo;re the Prince!&rdquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You recognize me?&rdquo; Prince Edward smiled widely as he put both hands on his hips and heaved out a sigh of relief.&nbsp;&ldquo;Great! Now could you please help me out?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>Her answer came as a shock to the heir of the throne.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Pardon?&rdquo; he raised an eyebrow for no one had ever talked to him that way beside his father - the King.<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I said: No. In fact, I&rsquo;d let you die down there, so your awful father could learn how it feels to lose someone he loves,&rdquo; she told him bitterly.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve heard of how he burnt down villages because of those rumors about witches. He murdered my entire family. And now you&rsquo;ve got the audacity to beg for my help?&rdquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Hey, hey, hey, lady, I don&rsquo;t know who you are but I swear I knew nothing about those villages. I&rsquo;m truly sorry about your family, and if you could help me I&rsquo;d pay you as much as you&rsquo;d like.&rdquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you could afford it, unless you knew how to resurrect the dead!&rdquo; The girl turned to walk away, ignoring the young Prince&rsquo;s pleading from down below. It was getting late and she&rsquo;d got no time for a conversation with a dying man. However, something occurred to her when she was finally far enough to not hear his voice anymore.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>If she left him there to die, she&rsquo;d be just as bad as his father.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Your Highness.&rdquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>Edward shot his face up and grinned widely when he saw the girl had returned. She rolled her eyes skyward then sighed heavily before laying out her bargain,&nbsp;&ldquo;if I save your life, would you do me a favor?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Anything!&rdquo; Edward spoke too soon, after that he realized how risky this agreement could turn out to be and quickly added,&nbsp;&ldquo;wait, if you want to turn me against my father, then I&rsquo;m sorry I cannot&nbsp;give you my word!&rdquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>What he said made the girl laugh, then she assured him,&nbsp;</i><i>&ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to betray your family or your country, I promise. Do we have a deal?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Edward nodded his head in response to the stranger standing on the edge of the hollow, holding his life in the palm of her hand. Now he could only count on his own judgement that she wasn&rsquo;t going to kill him once he got out of there.</i></p><p>&hellip;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;How is she?&rdquo; Harry asked the doctor once the man walked out of the room but Y/N wasn&rsquo;t with him.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s going to be fine,&rdquo; the middle-aged man said with a gentle smile, making Harry feel more at ease.&nbsp;&ldquo;The girl&nbsp;got food poisoning, not very serious so I&rsquo;ve already given her some pills. Let her stay here for an hour to see if she feels any better then she can go.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, doctor&rdquo; replied Harry as he shook the doctor&rsquo;s hand then watched the man walk away. He intended to go into the room to check on his new assistant immediately, but the moment he grabbed the doorknob, the phone in his pocket buzzed to notify him of a new text. It was from his manager Jeffrey.</p><ul><li><i>Hey are you alright?</i></li></ul><p>Harry furrowed his eyebrows as he read the question.</p><ul><li><b>I&rsquo;m fine, I&rsquo;m still at the hospital with Y/N. Why?</b><br /></li><li><i>You haven&rsquo;t seen the pictures?</i><br /></li><li><b>What pictures?</b><br /></li></ul><p>Jeff left Harry&rsquo;s latest message at seen so Harry had to find out on his own. He immediately went on social media (it&rsquo;s sad how this was his first guess)&nbsp;and the first thing he saw was an article published by an online magazine with all the pictures of his girlfriend making out with another man.</p><h2><i>Lillie Xander caught kissing a new man!!! Yikes! How does Harry Styles feel about this?</i></h2><p>For that one second, Harry almost stopped breathing. He wished those photos hadn&rsquo;t been real, that they&rsquo;d been photoshopped and his girlfriend of two years hadn&rsquo;t cheated on him. However, reality sucked, and he felt like a fool.</p><p>Harry was still staring at his phone when the door flew open all of a sudden and slammed with hard against his left arm! The girl behind it immediately mumbled her apology and she looked more frightened when she recognized who he was.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, shouldn&rsquo;t you be lying down?&rdquo; Harry asked Y/N while rubbing the sore spot on his arm, making his new assistant feel extremely guilty. Not only had she made him drive her all the way to the hospital and thrown up on his expensive jacket, but she also slammed him with the door. She was so in trouble after this.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Am I fired?&rdquo; she stared at him with her sad puppy dog eyes, and it took Harry a moment to take it in before he burst into laughter.</p><p>&ldquo;You honestly thought I was going to fire you for being sick on your first day?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And for destroying your Gucci jacket and not being able to buy another one for you even if I sold myself.&rdquo; She rolled her eyes backward and groaned out loud.&nbsp;&ldquo;What the hell is wrong with me? I can&rsquo;t get anything right.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey, hey, hey.&rdquo; Harry caught her by surprise when he grabbed her arms, holding her firmly place so she would look at his face.&nbsp;</p><p>Y/N turned to stone the very moment she made eye-contact with her new boss. Suddenly, everything started playing in slow-motion as she fell into the loop of his intense stare.&nbsp;Despite having already seen plenty photos of this man, Y/N&nbsp;was certain that wasn&rsquo;t the reason why she found those green eyes of his so familiar. She had seen them somewhere else before she just couldn&rsquo;t remember where exactly. It wasn&rsquo;t just a feeling that&nbsp;&lsquo;<i>I met you once on the street but I remember you because you&rsquo;re gorgeous</i>&rsquo;, it was more like&nbsp;&lsquo;<i>we don&rsquo;t know each other&nbsp;but I feel like we have for a really long time.</i>&rsquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Have we met?&rdquo; Harry was the one to ask that question, and not Y/N, which shocked her even more when she fell out of the maze that was his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I would&rsquo;ve remembered, trust me,&rdquo; she said, chuckling dryly as her eyes stayed on his.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Weird&hellip;&rdquo; Harry mumbled to himself, shaking his head then immediately put on a smile. &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t worry, you&rsquo;re not fired, and I&rsquo;m not mad at you for anything that&rsquo;s happened this morning.&rdquo;</p><p>For some reason she couldn&rsquo;t explain, Y/N knew that smile wasn&rsquo;t sincere. There was something bothering this man and he was just so used covering up his emotions that he did it like a pro. He couldn&rsquo;t fool her though.</p><p>However, she didn&rsquo;t say anything about that, and just smiled back at him.&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you so much. I can&rsquo;t lose another job again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Again?&rdquo; Harry looked at her, quite amused.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been fired before.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t fired, I quit my last job&hellip;But I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re not interested in my boring life stories.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am interested,&rdquo; he told her without pause.&nbsp;&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we go somewhere later and you tell me about that awful job that you quit? If we&rsquo;re going to be working close to each other, we should get to know each other, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You sure? Because in the schedule Jeff sent me&mdash;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s<i> my</i> schedule, I can cancel any plan I want. Jeff&rsquo;s my manager, not my boss.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Harry chuckled while shaking his head no.&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not, I am. He can&rsquo;t fire you unless I tell him too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s powerful.&rdquo; The words slipped out before Y/N can stop her lips. &ldquo;Shit&hellip;did I just say that?&rdquo;</p><p>Her face scrunched up in embarrassment when Harry let out a slight laugh.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, I like you already. I think we&rsquo;re gonna be a good team.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hope so.&rdquo; Y/N looked up as her eyes sparkled with joy.&nbsp;&ldquo;Shall we go now?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, the doctor told me to keep you here for an hour.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine now, just ignore&nbsp;the doctor.&rdquo; She snorted then just walked right past Harry to the nearest exit.&nbsp;</p><p>He stayed at the same spot, watching her marching down the hall with his mouth agape, then when she noticed he wasn&rsquo;t following her she stopped and turned around, looking all confused.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you waiting for? Hurry!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Harry snapped back to reality as he heard the sound of her voice. Then he shrugged off the foreign feeling in the pit of his stomach and ran forward to catch up with his new assistant.&nbsp;</p></p>",
