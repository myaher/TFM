Sighing at the loud noises, you practically crawled to your bathroom - splashing water at your face to try and wake up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHoney, are you awake?\u201d you heard your mom shout from the bottom of your stairs, ready to head to work. You groaned back in response, popping your head out the bathroom door to prove you were getting ready.\u00a0\u201cJust checking! Have a good day sweetheart\u201d she spoke, stepping out of the front door.</p><p>She had stayed over at your apartment last night, purely due to of convenience. Her job forced her to move around the cities quite a lot. You lived in the next town over from your parents, and your mom definitely took advantage of you having a spare bedroom. You happened to live right next to the office building she needed to be in today. Aside from the odd night that your parents stayed over. you were generally quite independent\u00a0</p><p>You loved your parents with all your heart, they\u2019re your best friends and you wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. They trust you wholeheartedly, probably because you\u2019ve always been a good kid - you maintained good grades, avoiding getting into trouble and even landing yourself a job as a personal assistant for a local company.\u00a0It all seems perfect from an outsiders point of view, but it\u2019s not. When you were at school, every one was part of some type of clique, resulting in many friendships becoming bitchy and toxic. You avoided that at at all costs, which is technically a good thing - but it sucked not having any real close friends. No one you could rant to when life tests your patience, no one to cry to when you get knocked down and no one to share inside jokes with.\u00a0</p><p>It also meant that you missed out on a lot of social activities. You were rarely invited to any parties that were thrown, you pretty much never drank and in a weird way, you feel like you have never got to experience what it\u2019s like to be a teenager.\u00a0You spent most of your time studying, trying to keep up your good reputation - mainly for your parents sake. They would love you no matter what, but you knew they took pride in telling their work friends that their daughter was a straight A student, who never gets into trouble - which sometimes ends up with you being described as a\u00a0\u2018goody two-shoes\u2019. But it made your parents happy at least.\u00a0</p><p>When you moved away and got yourself a job as a personal assistant, your life didn\u2019t change much. As much as you liked your job - which allowed you to meet all kinds of people, even including idols - however, your co-workers saw you as nothing more than just a personal assistant. No matter how many times you attempted to befriend them outside of the office, nothing worked. They all just wanted their damn coffee.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"461\" data-orig-height=\"20\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7be81ec5cd6bd820a5682db17440d812/tumblr_inline_p9lz9m1Kz21vh3aoz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"461\" data-orig-height=\"20\"/></figure><p>You jumped out of the shower, freshly showered after a long day of work.

Sighing at the loud noises, you practically crawled to your bathroom - splashing water at your face to try and wake up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHoney, are you awake?\u201d you heard your mom shout from the bottom of your stairs, ready to head to work. You groaned back in response, popping your head out the bathroom door to prove you were getting ready.\u00a0\u201cJust checking! Have a good day sweetheart\u201d she spoke, stepping out of the front door.</p><p>She had stayed over at your apartment last night, purely due to of convenience. Her job forced her to move around the cities quite a lot. You lived in the next town over from your parents, and your mom definitely took advantage of you having a spare bedroom. You happened to live right next to the office building she needed to be in today. Aside from the odd night that your parents stayed over. you were generally quite independent\u00a0</p><p>You loved your parents with all your heart, they\u2019re your best friends and you wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. They trust you wholeheartedly, probably because you\u2019ve always been a good kid - you maintained good grades, avoiding getting into trouble and even landing yourself a job as a personal assistant for a local company.\u00a0It all seems perfect from an outsiders point of view, but it\u2019s not. When you were at school, every one was part of some type of clique, resulting in many friendships becoming bitchy and toxic. You avoided that at at all costs, which is technically a good thing - but it sucked not having any real close friends. No one you could rant to when life tests your patience, no one to cry to when you get knocked down and no one to share inside jokes with.\u00a0</p><p>It also meant that you missed out on a lot of social activities. You were rarely invited to any parties that were thrown, you pretty much never drank and in a weird way, you feel like you have never got to experience what it\u2019s like to be a teenager.\u00a0You spent most of your time studying, trying to keep up your good reputation - mainly for your parents sake. They would love you no matter what, but you knew they took pride in telling their work friends that their daughter was a straight A student, who never gets into trouble - which sometimes ends up with you being described as a\u00a0\u2018goody two-shoes\u2019. But it made your parents happy at least.\u00a0</p><p>When you moved away and got yourself a job as a personal assistant, your life didn\u2019t change much. As much as you liked your job - which allowed you to meet all kinds of people, even including idols - however, your co-workers saw you as nothing more than just a personal assistant. No matter how many times you attempted to befriend them outside of the office, nothing worked. They all just wanted their damn coffee.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"461\" data-orig-height=\"20\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7be81ec5cd6bd820a5682db17440d812/tumblr_inline_p9lz9m1Kz21vh3aoz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"461\" data-orig-height=\"20\"></figure><p>You jumped out of the shower, freshly showered after a long day of work.

Sighing at the loud noises, you practically crawled to your bathroom - splashing water at your face to try and wake up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHoney, are you awake?\u201d you heard your mom shout from the bottom of your stairs, ready to head to work. You groaned back in response, popping your head out the bathroom door to prove you were getting ready.\u00a0\u201cJust checking! Have a good day sweetheart\u201d she spoke, stepping out of the front door.</p><p>She had stayed over at your apartment last night, purely due to of convenience. Her job forced her to move around the cities quite a lot. You lived in the next town over from your parents, and your mom definitely took advantage of you having a spare bedroom. You happened to live right next to the office building she needed to be in today. Aside from the odd night that your parents stayed over. you were generally quite independent\u00a0</p><p>You loved your parents with all your heart, they\u2019re your best friends and you wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. They trust you wholeheartedly, probably because you\u2019ve always been a good kid - you maintained good grades, avoiding getting into trouble and even landing yourself a job as a personal assistant for a local company.\u00a0It all seems perfect from an outsiders point of view, but it\u2019s not. When you were at school, every one was part of some type of clique, resulting in many friendships becoming bitchy and toxic. You avoided that at at all costs, which is technically a good thing - but it sucked not having any real close friends. No one you could rant to when life tests your patience, no one to cry to when you get knocked down and no one to share inside jokes with.\u00a0</p><p>It also meant that you missed out on a lot of social activities. You were rarely invited to any parties that were thrown, you pretty much never drank and in a weird way, you feel like you have never got to experience what it\u2019s like to be a teenager.\u00a0You spent most of your time studying, trying to keep up your good reputation - mainly for your parents sake. They would love you no matter what, but you knew they took pride in telling their work friends that their daughter was a straight A student, who never gets into trouble - which sometimes ends up with you being described as a\u00a0\u2018goody two-shoes\u2019. But it made your parents happy at least.\u00a0</p><p>When you moved away and got yourself a job as a personal assistant, your life didn\u2019t change much. As much as you liked your job - which allowed you to meet all kinds of people, even including idols - however, your co-workers saw you as nothing more than just a personal assistant. No matter how many times you attempted to befriend them outside of the office, nothing worked. They all just wanted their damn coffee.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"461\" data-orig-height=\"20\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7be81ec5cd6bd820a5682db17440d812/tumblr_inline_p9lz9m1Kz21vh3aoz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"461\" data-orig-height=\"20\"></figure><p>You jumped out of the shower, freshly showered after a long day of work. You hummed in contentment as you made your way to your kitchen, opening the fridge to take out the meal your mom has prepared for you. You smiled, thinking about how much she truly cared for you even after many months of living alone.</p><p>You sat down, humming a faint tune as you ate your food. You opened your laptop, preparing to binge-watch some stupid YouTube videos until the early hours of the morning.\u00a0 \u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"461\" data-orig-height=\"20\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7be81ec5cd6bd820a5682db17440d812/tumblr_inline_p9ntd8rTQY1vh3aoz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"461\" data-orig-height=\"20\"></figure><p>Hours later, you were still laying in bed, allowing video after video to play in order to give you some form of entertainment. This was one of things that sucked about being a good student with little to zero friends, you were constantly bored. No matter how many videos you watched or how much music you listened to, you were always in a state of boredom. You often fell into the habit of watching\u00a0<i>\u201cHow I met my boyfriend/girlfriend/best friend\u201d videos, </i>which to be honest made you feel lonelier but you enjoyed them nevertheless.\u00a0You clicked on one, titled\u00a0<i>\u201cBoyfriend tag\u201d, </i>and began watching it. It consisted of the subscribes sending in their questions/curiosities about their relationship. \u2018Slightly intrusive\u2019 you thought to yourself, but yet here you were watching it.\u00a0</p><p>You smiled sweetly at your laptop screen as they spoke about their first date. It took place in a local coffee shop in the girl\u2019s hometown.\u00a0They looked good together, laughing and joking with each other constantly as they were reminiscing over their memories together. You internally cringed at yourself. Is this what your life is now? Watching couples share memories while looking so deeply in love, instead of going out in the real world to try and create your own memories with a significant other? Yes, yes it was.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>They shared a knowing look with one another as they\u00a0were about to answer the typical \u201chow did you meet?\u201d question. The male spoke up, before they began explaining how that they actually met in the weirdest way - an online chatroom.\u00a0</p><p>That intrigued you more. The only chatroom you had heard of was Omegle. You knew that website was sketchy as hell due to the fact that it\u2019s full of middle-aged men wanting to video chat with girls fifteen years younger than them. Unfortunately, you knew that from experience. When you were younger, you visited the website a few times in order to try and make friends. As innocent as that sounds, your younger self was truly scarred for life once greeted with many many many penis\u2019s on your laptop screen. They explained that the website was called\u00a0<i>\u2018AnonChat\u2019, </i>and gave reasons for why it was actually a good website. The reasons were as followed:\u00a0</p><ol><li>You could filter the age of the people you wanted to chat with, which allowed you to actually talk to people your age - avoiding the possibility of creepy older men.\u00a0</li><li>You can state why you\u2019re on the website, whether that be for a casual chat, to find a relationship or for a hook-up and you will only be matched with people with the same desires.\u00a0</li><li>\u00a0The website recognises when you have spent a significant amount of time talking to each other and then gives you the option to press the \u2018reveal your face\u2019 button. This will no longer make your chat with one another anonymous.\u00a0<br></li><li>Finally, you have the option to save chats. This ensures that you will not loose contact with one another.</li></ol><p>You paused the video, looking around your room while debating if you should give the website a try or not. From your point of view, they made it sound pretty good. You liked the idea of talking to someone your age, and being able to save your chats. Despite hardly ever holding an actual conversation with people during your younger years on Omegle, it sucked when you found someone you liked but couldn\u2019t keep in contact with them without exchanging social media - and that just seemed too sketchy.\u00a0</p><p>After a few moments of deliberation, you decided to open up a new tab and type in the web link. Why the hell not? It\u2019s not like you\u2019re expecting to meet anybody special, websites like this usually suck. Besides, it\u2019s just a bit of fun to keep you from dying of boredom.\u00a0</p><p>The page loaded, with\u00a0\u2018AnonChat\u2019 in black, bold font in the top right hand corner. You weren\u2019t really sure how it worked, so you scanned the page for a\u00a0\u2018Start Chatting\u2019 type of button. You located it, at the bottom of the page and clicked it, not sure what to expect. You now had the option to\u00a0<i>\u2018Log in\u2019</i> or\u00a0<i>\u2018Create an account\u2019</i>. Underneath, it explained you could log in as a guest however, you would not be able to save any chats without an account. You decided on creating an account, you know, just in case someone decent actually appeared.\u00a0You created your username - which was only available for you to see - and your password, before clicking continue select your chat filters.\u00a0</p><p>You had set the age that you wanted, an age group that you were comfortable to talk to. You wouldn\u2019t want to talk to someone younger or older, you would struggle to have things in common. You also set your reason for chatting as\u00a0<i>\u2018Casual chat/Seeking friendship\u2019. </i>You selected<i>\u00a0\u2018Start\u2019, </i>and your first conversation popped up. You were unsure about how to start the conversation, do you just say hi?\u00a0</p><p><b><i>Anonymous has entered the chat, start chatting!\u00a0</i></b></p><p>You stared at the screen, you figured it would be better if you just wait for them to talk to you - just to test the waters to see how other people used the website. Moments passed by and neither of you had spoke. You figured that you were both just staring at the screen, hoping that the other person would start the conversation. Why the hell were you being shy? They have no idea who they are talking to.</p><p><b>You:</b> Hey! How are you?</p><p><b><i>\n\n<b><i>Anonymous is typing\u2026</i></b></i></b></p><p><b><i>Anonymous has left the chat.\u00a0</i></b></p><p>Well, that went well. You sighed, even on an online chatroom you seemed unable to be sociable. You sighed again, telling yourself you were being stupid. It was one chat, why did it upset you that a stranger left the chat? You shook your head, telling yourself to remember that these websites suck. You had to remember not to get your hopes up. Nevertheless you decided to join another chat, trying again to meet someone\u00a0</p><p>\n\n<b><i>Anonymous has entered the chat, start chatting! </i></b>\n\n<br></p><p><b><i>\n\n<b><i>Anonymous has left the chat. </i></b>\n\n<br></i></b></p><p>Oh come on, you didn\u2019t even get to say hi! This time you chuckled to yourself, thinking that you must have been cursed as a child and now you just naturally repel people. You closed your laptop, thinking it was just a stupid website.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"461\" data-orig-height=\"20\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7be81ec5cd6bd820a5682db17440d812/tumblr_inline_p9p2vft2Cg1vh3aoz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"461\" data-orig-height=\"20\"></figure><p>You tossed and turned in your bed after hours of being unable to sleep.

So consider this an introduction to y/n and to the plot. Enjoy!</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7be81ec5cd6bd820a5682db17440d812/tumblr_inline_p9lz96obls1vh3aoz_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Your eyes fluttered open at the sound of the small birds chirping outside your window - you usually wouldn&rsquo;t mind the sound but at 6:30am, you wanted nothing more than to crawl back into your comfy, large bed. Sighing at the loud noises, you practically crawled to your bathroom - splashing water at your face to try and wake up.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Honey, are you awake?&rdquo; you heard your mom shout from the bottom of your stairs, ready to head to work. You groaned back in response, popping your head out the bathroom door to prove you were getting ready.&nbsp;&ldquo;Just checking! Have a good day sweetheart&rdquo; she spoke, stepping out of the front door.</p><p>She had stayed over at your apartment last night, purely due to of convenience. Her job forced her to move around the cities quite a lot. You lived in the next town over from your parents, and your mom definitely took advantage of you having a spare bedroom. You happened to live right next to the office building she needed to be in today. Aside from the odd night that your parents stayed over. you were generally quite independent&nbsp;</p><p>You loved your parents with all your heart, they&rsquo;re your best friends and you wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way. They trust you wholeheartedly, probably because you&rsquo;ve always been a good kid - you maintained good grades, avoiding getting into trouble and even landing yourself a job as a personal assistant for a local company.&nbsp;It all seems perfect from an outsiders point of view, but it&rsquo;s not. When you were at school, every one was part of some type of clique, resulting in many friendships becoming bitchy and toxic. You avoided that at at all costs, which is technically a good thing - but it sucked not having any real close friends. No one you could rant to when life tests your patience, no one to cry to when you get knocked down and no one to share inside jokes with.&nbsp;</p><p>It also meant that you missed out on a lot of social activities. You were rarely invited to any parties that were thrown, you pretty much never drank and in a weird way, you feel like you have never got to experience what it&rsquo;s like to be a teenager.&nbsp;You spent most of your time studying, trying to keep up your good reputation - mainly for your parents sake. They would love you no matter what, but you knew they took pride in telling their work friends that their daughter was a straight A student, who never gets into trouble - which sometimes ends up with you being described as a&nbsp;&lsquo;goody two-shoes&rsquo;. But it made your parents happy at least.&nbsp;</p><p>When you moved away and got yourself a job as a personal assistant, your life didn&rsquo;t change much. As much as you liked your job - which allowed you to meet all kinds of people, even including idols - however, your co-workers saw you as nothing more than just a personal assistant. No matter how many times you attempted to befriend them outside of the office, nothing worked. They all just wanted their damn coffee.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7be81ec5cd6bd820a5682db17440d812/tumblr_inline_p9lz9m1Kz21vh3aoz_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>You jumped out of the shower, freshly showered after a long day of work. You hummed in contentment as you made your way to your kitchen, opening the fridge to take out the meal your mom has prepared for you. You smiled, thinking about how much she truly cared for you even after many months of living alone.</p><p>You sat down, humming a faint tune as you ate your food. You opened your laptop, preparing to binge-watch some stupid YouTube videos until the early hours of the morning.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7be81ec5cd6bd820a5682db17440d812/tumblr_inline_p9ntd8rTQY1vh3aoz_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Hours later, you were still laying in bed, allowing video after video to play in order to give you some form of entertainment. This was one of things that sucked about being a good student with little to zero friends, you were constantly bored. No matter how many videos you watched or how much music you listened to, you were always in a state of boredom. You often fell into the habit of watching&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;How I met my boyfriend/girlfriend/best friend&rdquo; videos, </i>which to be honest made you feel lonelier but you enjoyed them nevertheless.&nbsp;You clicked on one, titled&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;Boyfriend tag&rdquo;, </i>and began watching it. It consisted of the subscribes sending in their questions/curiosities about their relationship. &lsquo;Slightly intrusive&rsquo; you thought to yourself, but yet here you were watching it.&nbsp;</p><p>You smiled sweetly at your laptop screen as they spoke about their first date. It took place in a local coffee shop in the girl&rsquo;s hometown.&nbsp;They looked good together, laughing and joking with each other constantly as they were reminiscing over their memories together. You internally cringed at yourself. Is this what your life is now? Watching couples share memories while looking so deeply in love, instead of going out in the real world to try and create your own memories with a significant other? Yes, yes it was.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>They shared a knowing look with one another as they&nbsp;were about to answer the typical &ldquo;how did you meet?&rdquo; question. The male spoke up, before they began explaining how that they actually met in the weirdest way - an online chatroom.&nbsp;</p><p>That intrigued you more. The only chatroom you had heard of was Omegle. You knew that website was sketchy as hell due to the fact that it&rsquo;s full of middle-aged men wanting to video chat with girls fifteen years younger than them. Unfortunately, you knew that from experience. When you were younger, you visited the website a few times in order to try and make friends. As innocent as that sounds, your younger self was truly scarred for life once greeted with many many many penis&rsquo;s on your laptop screen. They explained that the website was called&nbsp;<i>&lsquo;AnonChat&rsquo;, </i>and gave reasons for why it was actually a good website. The reasons were as followed:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>You could filter the age of the people you wanted to chat with, which allowed you to actually talk to people your age - avoiding the possibility of creepy older men.&nbsp;</li><li>You can state why you&rsquo;re on the website, whether that be for a casual chat, to find a relationship or for a hook-up and you will only be matched with people with the same desires.&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;The website recognises when you have spent a significant amount of time talking to each other and then gives you the option to press the &lsquo;reveal your face&rsquo; button. This will no longer make your chat with one another anonymous.&nbsp;<br /></li><li>Finally, you have the option to save chats. This ensures that you will not loose contact with one another.</li></ol><p>You paused the video, looking around your room while debating if you should give the website a try or not. From your point of view, they made it sound pretty good. You liked the idea of talking to someone your age, and being able to save your chats. Despite hardly ever holding an actual conversation with people during your younger years on Omegle, it sucked when you found someone you liked but couldn&rsquo;t keep in contact with them without exchanging social media - and that just seemed too sketchy.&nbsp;</p><p>After a few moments of deliberation, you decided to open up a new tab and type in the web link. Why the hell not? It&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re expecting to meet anybody special, websites like this usually suck. Besides, it&rsquo;s just a bit of fun to keep you from dying of boredom.&nbsp;</p><p>The page loaded, with&nbsp;&lsquo;AnonChat&rsquo; in black, bold font in the top right hand corner. You weren&rsquo;t really sure how it worked, so you scanned the page for a&nbsp;&lsquo;Start Chatting&rsquo; type of button. You located it, at the bottom of the page and clicked it, not sure what to expect. You now had the option to&nbsp;<i>&lsquo;Log in&rsquo;</i> or&nbsp;<i>&lsquo;Create an account&rsquo;</i>. Underneath, it explained you could log in as a guest however, you would not be able to save any chats without an account. You decided on creating an account, you know, just in case someone decent actually appeared.&nbsp;You created your username - which was only available for you to see - and your password, before clicking continue select your chat filters.&nbsp;</p><p>You had set the age that you wanted, an age group that you were comfortable to talk to. You wouldn&rsquo;t want to talk to someone younger or older, you would struggle to have things in common. You also set your reason for chatting as&nbsp;<i>&lsquo;Casual chat/Seeking friendship&rsquo;. </i>You selected<i>&nbsp;&lsquo;Start&rsquo;, </i>and your first conversation popped up. You were unsure about how to start the conversation, do you just say hi?&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>Anonymous has entered the chat, start chatting!&nbsp;</i></b></p><p>You stared at the screen, you figured it would be better if you just wait for them to talk to you - just to test the waters to see how other people used the website. Moments passed by and neither of you had spoke. You figured that you were both just staring at the screen, hoping that the other person would start the conversation. Why the hell were you being shy? They have no idea who they are talking to.</p><p><b>You:</b> Hey! How are you?</p><p><b><i>\n\n<b><i>Anonymous is typing&hellip;</i></b></i></b></p><p><b><i>Anonymous has left the chat.&nbsp;</i></b></p><p>Well, that went well. You sighed, even on an online chatroom you seemed unable to be sociable. You sighed again, telling yourself you were being stupid. It was one chat, why did it upset you that a stranger left the chat? You shook your head, telling yourself to remember that these websites suck. You had to remember not to get your hopes up. Nevertheless you decided to join another chat, trying again to meet someone&nbsp;</p><p>\n\n<b><i>Anonymous has entered the chat, start chatting! </i></b>\n\n<br /></p><p><b><i>\n\n<b><i>Anonymous has left the chat. </i></b>\n\n<br /></i></b></p><p>Oh come on, you didn&rsquo;t even get to say hi! This time you chuckled to yourself, thinking that you must have been cursed as a child and now you just naturally repel people. You closed your laptop, thinking it was just a stupid website.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7be81ec5cd6bd820a5682db17440d812/tumblr_inline_p9p2vft2Cg1vh3aoz_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>You tossed and turned in your bed after hours of being unable to sleep. You lifted your head up in order to see your alarm clock, 3:49am. <i>Great</i>. You sat up in your bed with your back leaning against your headboard as you sighed and looked around your room, deciding what you could do in order to make yourself fall back asleep. You hummed as you saw your laptop on your floor, thinking that you could probably just play a boring movie or something. You picked up your laptop, expecting Google to pop up - but instead you were greeted by the stupid chatroom you had completely forgotten about.&nbsp;</p><p>Without much though you clicked&nbsp;&lsquo;Start Chatting&rsquo; once again, figuring maybe this would be better than watching some crappy movie.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\n<b><i>Anonymous has entered the chat, start chatting! </i></b>\n\n<br /></p><p><b><i>\n\n<b><i>Anonymous is typing&hellip;&nbsp;</i></b><br /></i></b></p><p>Well, at least this was an improvement - they were already typing and you didn&rsquo;t even say hi.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Anonymous: </b>Do you ever wonder why Cinderella's&nbsp;shoe fell off when it fit her perfectly?</p><p><b>Anonymous: </b>Or why our feet smell, but our nose run?&nbsp;</p><p><b>Anonymous: </b>And what about how we&rsquo;re clean when we get out of the shower, but our towels are dirty?</p><p>You giggle as you read the message, although you aren&rsquo;t sure whether this person is trying to be funny or if they have gone delusional from the apparent lack of sleep.</p><p><b>You:</b>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s nearly 4am, please do not give me an existential crisis with your sleepy thoughts.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Anonymous:</b> You can&rsquo;t sleep either?</p><p><b>You: </b>Why else would I be up at 4am?

Plus, whoever they are, they seem to want to know more about you too.</p><p><b>You: </b>I&rsquo;d be able to handle your facts any other time of the day, don&rsquo;t discriminate against us tired people.&nbsp;</p><p><b>You:</b>&nbsp;Well, I think I sing too loud in the shower</p><p><b>You: </b>I enjoy food, like a lot&nbsp;</p><p><b>You:</b>&nbsp;And, I play piano (sometimes but not really).&nbsp;</p><p><b>Anonymous:&nbsp;</b>You seem musical, that&rsquo;s cool.&nbsp;</p><p><b>You: </b>I try to be but my job takes up most of my time.&nbsp;</p><p><b>You:</b> Anyway what about you?&nbsp;</p><p><b>Anonymous:</b> Understandable.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Anonymous:</b> I like food and attention&nbsp;</p><p><b>You:</b> You sound like a cat</p><p><b>Anonymous:</b> Maybe I am&nbsp;</p><p><b>You: </b>This is my queue to leave, I&rsquo;m not into that hybrid shit</p><p><b>Anonymous:</b> Too bad, you&rsquo;re stuck here forever</p><p><b><i>Anonymous has saved the chat</i></b></p><p><b>Anonymous:</b> I&rsquo;ve already saved the chat</p><p><b>You: </b>Dammit, I guess I&rsquo;ll have to learn to deal with chatting to a cat</p><p><b><i>You have saved the chat</i></b></p><p><b>Anonymous:</b> It&rsquo;s super late (well, early) so I&rsquo;m gonna try and sleep again.
