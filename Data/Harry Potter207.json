Then the second episode aired, and I was \nlike, welp.. Maybe I\u2019ll wait until hellatus so I can use some canon in \nthe newer episodes..</p><p>AND THEN FUCKING MICHAEL PARTIALLY STOLE MY \nIDEA!! So no If I write it i will look like I am super un-creative and \njust used part of the story&hellip;</p><p>Please ignore any typos I\u2019m just throwing this together real quick. I\u2019ve been thinking about this non stop for two weeks now..<br/></p><p>Here is a quick, unorganized, mess of what the main events in my fanfic idea are:</p><p>like\n my idea was supposed to take place right after that scene in 14x01 \nwhere *SPOILER ALERT* Sam kills that demon and is all like \u201cThere will \nbe no new King of Hell. Not today. Not ever. And if anyone wants the \njob, you can come through me. Understood? So, What&rsquo;s it gonna be?&ldquo; and \nthe demons hesitated for a few seconds then smoked out and Sam&rsquo;s all \nlike &quot;That&rsquo;s what I thought.\u201c<br/><br/>I was gonna write a story where one\n of those demons is my OC and is so done with Sam\u2019s shit that he decides\n to start his own super army to take back Hell.<br/><br/>He knows he can \nkill Sam pretty easily if he got him alone, but that\u2019s not good enough \nfor him. He doesn\u2019t want to just capture or kill him he wants to \nPULVERIZE him. And Michael is being a pain in the ass killing tons of \nmonsters and any demons that get in the way so it pisses my OC off to \nthe point that he wants to kill Michael. And take over Heaven because \nwhy not.</p><p>My OC was gonna come up with the idea where he wants to \ngive monsters demon strength in addition to their own strength to become\n wickedly strong. At first he tried demon blood, it barely has any \neffect, and the few that it did work on, ended up turning against him.</p><p>Then\n he has the idea to ditch his meat suit and possess different monsters. \nVamps, Shifters, Djinns, etc.. They each had different sets of pros and \ncons.<br/><br/>Eventually he realizes that werewolves are his best option,\n due to their strength and agility. He possesses different werewolves \nand works his way up in packs trying to find the most powerful Alpha.</p><p>There\n are different breeds of wolves some only change on full moon, some can \nchange whenever they want. Some have absolutely no control of their \nchange others have little, some have complete control.</p><p>As he works his way through the ranks, he still isn\u2019t satisfied. He wants to find the STRONGEST Werewolf there is.<br/><br/>Eventually\n he learns of Fenrir Greyback, supposedly the most powerful werewolf \nthat ever lived. He learns of Hogwarts from so many collected memories \nof student werewolves he has possessed. But the more and more he heard \nabout Greyback, the more he learned about how little he was actually \nable to control his powers and that he was a hot-mess and crazy killing \nmachine.</p><p>Disappointed by this, and about to leave Hogwarts and settle for a different wolf, he finds out about Remus Lupin.</p><p>Not\n only was Lupin a werewolf, he was also a WIZARD, and an Defense Against\n the DARK ARTS Professor at Hogwarts. Amazed by this information, my OC \ndecides he HAS to possess Lupin. Lupin didn\u2019t have complete control over\n his inner Moony either, but he was a better organized individual and he\n did have ALL of the knowledge and ability to preform dark spells that \ncan inflict serious damage and easily kill. Greyback had the ability to \nperform magic as well, but he was killed by a couple of students, verses\n Lupin who was killed by a powerful Deathe Eater that took many lives. \nIf he can control Lupin, he would not only has his werewolf strength and\n agility combined with his own Demon strength, but also ALL of that \nmagic, and easier control of his inner wolf, Moony.</p><p>He can take down Sam, Michael, Heaven, Hell, and everything between..</p><p>So\n he finds out as much as he can about Lupin and devises a plan. He \neasily gets himself (as a student) into trouble at Hogwarts so that he \ncan meet with the Headmaster of Hogwarts, Professor Minerva McGonagall.<br/><br/>After\n they\u2019re alone in the office, he jumps her, beats the shit out of her \nand FORCES her to take him back in time to back before Lupin is killed. \nIt just so happens to be around the time the Order of the Phoenix was \nprime and before any serious attacks on Voldemort have occurred. <br/></p><p>My OC isn\u2019t strong enough to time travel without the help.</p><p>Long story short he possesses Lupin, petrifies McGonagall and goes back to the present and begins his rein.<br/></p><p>Throughout\n his story-line, I was going to have cuts to Sam and Cas searching for \nDean. Michael killing everyone he considered liars, trying to weed out \nthe population to only people he could trust, Jack trying to learn how \nto be human and training to become a hunter with Bobby, and Mary working\n with all of the survivors from the alternate Earth taking down any \nmonsters they can and watching for signs of Michael for Sam and Cas.<br/></p><p>After\n Lupin is taken from the past and McGonagall is found by Kingsley \nShacklebolt, she explains everything to him and the rest of The Order. \nThe whole Order is extremely upset but have so much going on with \nVoldemort and the Death Eaters that they can\u2019t do much about it. Plus \nLupin being gone is one less member which doesn\u2019t help their situation, \nso sending more members after him, will only cause harm to them. \nMeanwhile, Sirius Black refuses to not do anything and demands to go \nwith McGonagall back to the future. <br/></p><p>\nMcGonagall and Black, back to the current time, try to meet with the \ncurrent Minister of Magic, Hermione Granger, only to find out the second\n they return to the future that EVERYTHING changes. The plans made by \nThe Order are altered and don\u2019t work out, mostly due to missing two \nmembers and having different ideas for priorities. Greyback never died, \nVoldemort took over the entire Wizarding World and magic is no longer a \nsecret to muggles who are terrified of everything happening.</p><p>Sam \nand Cas hunt Death Eaters in addition to monsters (which has been a \nnormal thing since 1998 when the Battle of Hogwarts failed horribly.) \nShit is chaotic AF. <br/><br/>A few weeks later after a lot of extremely \ntraumatic events. There\u2019s going to be an insanely intense fight between \nMichael and my OC as Remus. McGonagall and Black are there hiding \nplanning on waiting for my OC and Michael to fight each other almost to \ndeath than jump in to intervene.. Meanwhile, \nSam, Castiel, Mary, Bobby and Jack are there hiding out waiting for the \nexact same thing to happen and try to save Dean. They accidentally meet \nat the scene of the fight, almost fight each other then find out they\u2019re\n on the same team and decided to work together to stop the madness. <br/><br/>There\u2019s\n going to be an insanely painful scene where Sirius as Padfoot is \nfighting my OC as Remus/Moony and Sirius is going to be seriously \ninjured by him and Remus will be fighting with Moony internally trying \nto force the demon out and self harming trying to escape to reality. He \nalmost kills his Padfoot. Similar to that parallel in that scene in SPN \nwhere Cas almost kills dean and Dean breaks Naomi\u2019s mind control on Cas,\n Padfoot will eventually get through to Remus enough for Remus and Moony\n to team up for a few seconds for just long enough to overthrown the \ndemon, but the demon escapes. <br/></p><p>No amount of exorcising can \nkick him out of his body, Sam and Castiel have tried relentlessly, but \nhe used Lupin\u2019s magic to hex a make-shift force-field to trap his demon \nsoul into the body. When Lupin overpowered the Demon, there was a second\n where the hex was broken due to lack of concentration and he was able \nto smoke out of there.\n\n<br/></p><p>Meanwhile, Michael isn\u2019t giving up and things get so bad that\n it has come down to, stop trying to save dean, and just kill Michael. \nWith the demon gone, everyone is now trying to kill Michael/Dean and it \nis pure carnage and mayhem. Eventually they succeed by combining \nmultiple killing spells and and being stabbed by both Ruby\u2019s Demon \nkilling blade, Cas\u2019 angel blade, and a shotgun blast to the head, all at\n the same time.. Michael and Dean are both obliterated. It seemed like \nextreme over-kill but it was just barely powerful enough to kill the \nArch Angel.<br/></p><p>The scene is incredibly painful and Cas tries and \ntries and tries to heal the damage but it\u2019s too late. Dean is gone. Cas \ndoesn\u2019t give up, he keeps trying and trying until he is so physically \nexhausted he cannot physically use another ounce of his Angel juice. All\n he was able to really do was patch up most of his scars and mend some \nof his limbs back into place. Sirius and Remus, although extremely weak \nalso tried to help, with their magic but both failed.\n\n<br/></p><p>Minerva felt horrible watching and nobody noticed her slipping away, probably to prepare a potion to go back in time. </p><p>But\n then she comes back, with the Philosopher\u2019s stone. Thought to have been\n destroyed by Dumbledore and Nicolas Flamel years ago. Apparently right \nafter the Battle of Hogwarts, Minerva back in time to stop them from \ndestroying it, so she can use it to talk to Dumbledore and so others can\n use it to talk to their loved ones who had passed away during the war \nin her timeline. She has had this stone in her possession ever since. \nNever once using it\u2019s true power of Resurrection. She knows that the \nstone can only be used toe resurrect one soul before it destroys itself,\n so she\u2019s been keeping it locked away somewhere only she knew the \nlocation for it.<br/></p><p>She didn\u2019t even hesitate, she went to work \nstraight way. She used the stone and with a brilliant flash of green \nlight and a collection of ghostly voices and an almost theatrical scene \nthat took everyone\u2019s breath away, everyone stared on at Dean. Nothing \nhappened. Hours go by, Cas refused to leave Dean\u2019s side and Sam tried to\n force himself to accept the reality of he situation and plan what to do\n with his body. <br/></p><p>McGonagall gives Remus and Sirius ALL the \ninformation they need to actually stop Voldemort. She doesn\u2019t tell them \nanything about their deaths. They asked her about that topic earlier on.\n She said that they didn\u2019t die in her timeline, but that they must be \ndead in the current reality because of Voldemort, which is why they \ncan\u2019t find themselves. She lied to them because she can\u2019t risk having \nmore alterations to the timeline that could have catastrophic results \nagain. She is very much away that she is basically sending them to their\n deaths for the greater good, and she is going to have to live with that\n for the rest of her life. She will never forgiver herself, but it is \nwhat must be done. <br/></p><p>Sam, Cas, Mary, Bobby and Jack, distraught\n take Dean\u2019s remains to Lawrence, Kansas. Planning on burying him \nproperly where their story started.</p><p>Sam and Bobby dug the hole \nwhile Mary and Jack built a casket of sorts for him. They don\u2019t want to \nburn his remains, its not something Dean would&rsquo;ve wanted. They close the\n lid of the casket and carefully lower him into the ground. They say all\n that they can\u2019t think to say and start to bury him. \u00a0They all lingered \nafterwards, not wanting to leave. After about half an hour of staring at\n his grave, Sam starts to walk back to the car. They have a long drive \nback to the Bunker where he can properly mourn.</p><p>Cas, however, \ndoesn\u2019t step away from the grave. He is knelt down with his with his \nhands a few inches deep into the dirt just over the grave. He is still \nin shock and refuses to accept this. After awhile longer, his sadness \nturns into anger. He becomes uncontrollably angry and slams his hand \ndown as hard as he can, disheveling the dirt around him. He looked up to\n the sky and is seconds away from screaming at Chuck for letting such a \nhorrible thing happen. But just as he\u2019s about to leap up to his feet and\n scream, a faint tapping noise catches his attention.</p><p>All of his \nanger suddenly gone, he, kneels forward and presses his ear almost to \nthe ground, listens intently. He doesn\u2019t hear anything, but he waits; \nstill not giving up hope. After a few seconds of silence, he heard the \nsound again.</p><p>tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap&hellip;. <br/></p><p>He \nscreams to Sam. \u201cDo you hear that?\u201d Sam quickly joins him, and listens. \nHe hears nothing. Mary and Bobby and Jack hurry over and also hear \nnothing. They think Cas is making it up because he doesn\u2019t want to \naccept it.</p><p>Cas insists on hearing a tapping noise and grabs the shovel out of the car and starts digging.</p><p>Bobby\n makes a move to try to stop him, saying don\u2019t bother, the boy\u2019s dead. \nCas angrily shoves him away too hard and starts frantically digging. \nWhen he\u2019s about halfway down and has screamed Deans\u2019 name half a dozen \ntimes already, sudden Sam started to hear the tapping. Sam was doubtful \nfor a second but then as Cas started digging deeper the sound started to\n sound like a knocking. Sam and Mary realized in unison that the \nimpossible might have actually occurred. They both started digging with \ntheir hands alongside Cas as fast as they could. Still uncertain, with \ntears blurring their vision.</p><p>Cas still screaming Dean\u2019s name and \ndigging faster and faster. The knocking started sounding like banging, \nand there was another muffled sound accompanying it.</p><p>Almost \nthrough to the casket, the banging was getting louder and louder and the\n muffled voice was Dean\u2019s voice screaming \u201cCas!\u201d over and over again. \nThey thew open the casket and destroyed the door in the process.</p><p>Dean was alive!! The stone worked! It took just over twenty four hours, but it worked! <br/></p><p>\nDean was groggy, and in a lot of pain. He could barely lift himself into a sitting position.\n\n<br/></p><p>Cas hugged him tight then quickly healed his wounds as much \nas he could, before he and Sam lifted him out of the grave and onto \nsolid ground.. Sam, Mary, Jack and Bobby each got a chance to hug him. \nAll of them laughing is disbelief.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let me say yes to another dick with wings&ndash;.\u201d Dean coughed up some blood. \u201c&ndash;Ever again.\u201c</p><p>\u201cYo-ou bet.\u201d Said Sam with a smile, trying to hide the break in his voice.</p>",

But just as he\u2019s about to leap up to his feet and\n scream, a faint tapping noise catches his attention.</p><p>All of his \nanger suddenly gone, he, kneels forward and presses his ear almost to \nthe ground, listens intently.

Sam was doubtful \nfor a second but then as Cas started digging deeper the sound started to\n sound like a knocking. Sam and Mary realized in unison that the \nimpossible might have actually occurred. They both started digging with \ntheir hands alongside Cas as fast as they could. Still uncertain, with \ntears blurring their vision.</p><p>Cas still screaming Dean\u2019s name and \ndigging faster and faster. The knocking started sounding like banging, \nand there was another muffled sound accompanying it.</p><p>Almost \nthrough to the casket, the banging was getting louder and louder and the\n muffled voice was Dean\u2019s voice screaming \u201cCas!\u201d over and over again. \nThey thew open the casket and destroyed the door in the process.</p><p>Dean was alive!!

Then the second episode aired, and I was \nlike, welp.. Maybe I\u2019ll wait until hellatus so I can use some canon in \nthe newer episodes..</p><p>AND THEN FUCKING MICHAEL PARTIALLY STOLE MY \nIDEA!! So no If I write it i will look like I am super un-creative and \njust used part of the story\u2026</p><p>Please ignore any typos I\u2019m just throwing this together real quick. I\u2019ve been thinking about this non stop for two weeks now..<br></p><p>Here is a quick, unorganized, mess of what the main events in my fanfic idea are:</p><p>like\n my idea was supposed to take place right after that scene in 14x01 \nwhere *SPOILER ALERT* Sam kills that demon and is all like \u201cThere will \nbe no new King of Hell. Not today. Not ever. And if anyone wants the \njob, you can come through me. Understood? So, What\u2019s it gonna be?\u201c and \nthe demons hesitated for a few seconds then smoked out and Sam\u2019s all \nlike \"That\u2019s what I thought.\u201c<br><br>I was gonna write a story where one\n of those demons is my OC and is so done with Sam\u2019s shit that he decides\n to start his own super army to take back Hell.<br><br>He knows he can \nkill Sam pretty easily if he got him alone, but that\u2019s not good enough \nfor him. He doesn\u2019t want to just capture or kill him he wants to \nPULVERIZE him. And Michael is being a pain in the ass killing tons of \nmonsters and any demons that get in the way so it pisses my OC off to \nthe point that he wants to kill Michael. And take over Heaven because \nwhy not.</p><p>My OC was gonna come up with the idea where he wants to \ngive monsters demon strength in addition to their own strength to become\n wickedly strong. At first he tried demon blood, it barely has any \neffect, and the few that it did work on, ended up turning against him.</p><p>Then\n he has the idea to ditch his meat suit and possess different monsters. \nVamps, Shifters, Djinns, etc.. They each had different sets of pros and \ncons.<br><br>Eventually he realizes that werewolves are his best option,\n due to their strength and agility. He possesses different werewolves \nand works his way up in packs trying to find the most powerful Alpha.</p><p>There\n are different breeds of wolves some only change on full moon, some can \nchange whenever they want. Some have absolutely no control of their \nchange others have little, some have complete control.</p><p>As he works his way through the ranks, he still isn\u2019t satisfied. He wants to find the STRONGEST Werewolf there is.<br><br>Eventually\n he learns of Fenrir Greyback, supposedly the most powerful werewolf \nthat ever lived. He learns of Hogwarts from so many collected memories \nof student werewolves he has possessed. But the more and more he heard \nabout Greyback, the more he learned about how little he was actually \nable to control his powers and that he was a hot-mess and crazy killing \nmachine.</p><p>Disappointed by this, and about to leave Hogwarts and settle for a different wolf, he finds out about Remus Lupin.</p><p>Not\n only was Lupin a werewolf, he was also a WIZARD, and an Defense Against\n the DARK ARTS Professor at Hogwarts. Amazed by this information, my OC \ndecides he HAS to possess Lupin. Lupin didn\u2019t have complete control over\n his inner Moony either, but he was a better organized individual and he\n did have ALL of the knowledge and ability to preform dark spells that \ncan inflict serious damage and easily kill. Greyback had the ability to \nperform magic as well, but he was killed by a couple of students, verses\n Lupin who was killed by a powerful Deathe Eater that took many lives. \nIf he can control Lupin, he would not only has his werewolf strength and\n agility combined with his own Demon strength, but also ALL of that \nmagic, and easier control of his inner wolf, Moony.</p><p>He can take down Sam, Michael, Heaven, Hell, and everything between..</p><p>So\n he finds out as much as he can about Lupin and devises a plan. He \neasily gets himself (as a student) into trouble at Hogwarts so that he \ncan meet with the Headmaster of Hogwarts, Professor Minerva McGonagall.<br><br>After\n they\u2019re alone in the office, he jumps her, beats the shit out of her \nand FORCES her to take him back in time to back before Lupin is killed. \nIt just so happens to be around the time the Order of the Phoenix was \nprime and before any serious attacks on Voldemort have occurred. <br></p><p>My OC isn\u2019t strong enough to time travel without the help.</p><p>Long story short he possesses Lupin, petrifies McGonagall and goes back to the present and begins his rein.<br></p><p>Throughout\n his story-line, I was going to have cuts to Sam and Cas searching for \nDean. Michael killing everyone he considered liars, trying to weed out \nthe population to only people he could trust, Jack trying to learn how \nto be human and training to become a hunter with Bobby, and Mary working\n with all of the survivors from the alternate Earth taking down any \nmonsters they can and watching for signs of Michael for Sam and Cas.<br></p><p>After\n Lupin is taken from the past and McGonagall is found by Kingsley \nShacklebolt, she explains everything to him and the rest of The Order. \nThe whole Order is extremely upset but have so much going on with \nVoldemort and the Death Eaters that they can\u2019t do much about it. Plus \nLupin being gone is one less member which doesn\u2019t help their situation, \nso sending more members after him, will only cause harm to them. \nMeanwhile, Sirius Black refuses to not do anything and demands to go \nwith McGonagall back to the future. <br></p><p>\nMcGonagall and Black, back to the current time, try to meet with the \ncurrent Minister of Magic, Hermione Granger, only to find out the second\n they return to the future that EVERYTHING changes. The plans made by \nThe Order are altered and don\u2019t work out, mostly due to missing two \nmembers and having different ideas for priorities. Greyback never died, \nVoldemort took over the entire Wizarding World and magic is no longer a \nsecret to muggles who are terrified of everything happening.</p><p>Sam \nand Cas hunt Death Eaters in addition to monsters (which has been a \nnormal thing since 1998 when the Battle of Hogwarts failed horribly.) \nShit is chaotic AF. <br><br>A few weeks later after a lot of extremely \ntraumatic events. There\u2019s going to be an insanely intense fight between \nMichael and my OC as Remus. McGonagall and Black are there hiding \nplanning on waiting for my OC and Michael to fight each other almost to \ndeath than jump in to intervene.. Meanwhile, \nSam, Castiel, Mary, Bobby and Jack are there hiding out waiting for the \nexact same thing to happen and try to save Dean. They accidentally meet \nat the scene of the fight, almost fight each other then find out they\u2019re\n on the same team and decided to work together to stop the madness. <br><br>There\u2019s\n going to be an insanely painful scene where Sirius as Padfoot is \nfighting my OC as Remus/Moony and Sirius is going to be seriously \ninjured by him and Remus will be fighting with Moony internally trying \nto force the demon out and self harming trying to escape to reality. He \nalmost kills his Padfoot. Similar to that parallel in that scene in SPN \nwhere Cas almost kills dean and Dean breaks Naomi\u2019s mind control on Cas,\n Padfoot will eventually get through to Remus enough for Remus and Moony\n to team up for a few seconds for just long enough to overthrown the \ndemon, but the demon escapes. <br></p><p>No amount of exorcising can \nkick him out of his body, Sam and Castiel have tried relentlessly, but \nhe used Lupin\u2019s magic to hex a make-shift force-field to trap his demon \nsoul into the body. When Lupin overpowered the Demon, there was a second\n where the hex was broken due to lack of concentration and he was able \nto smoke out of there.\n\n<br></p><p>Meanwhile, Michael isn\u2019t giving up and things get so bad that\n it has come down to, stop trying to save dean, and just kill Michael. \nWith the demon gone, everyone is now trying to kill Michael/Dean and it \nis pure carnage and mayhem. Eventually they succeed by combining \nmultiple killing spells and and being stabbed by both Ruby\u2019s Demon \nkilling blade, Cas\u2019 angel blade, and a shotgun blast to the head, all at\n the same time.. Michael and Dean are both obliterated. It seemed like \nextreme over-kill but it was just barely powerful enough to kill the \nArch Angel.<br></p><p>The scene is incredibly painful and Cas tries and \ntries and tries to heal the damage but it\u2019s too late. Dean is gone. Cas \ndoesn\u2019t give up, he keeps trying and trying until he is so physically \nexhausted he cannot physically use another ounce of his Angel juice. All\n he was able to really do was patch up most of his scars and mend some \nof his limbs back into place. Sirius and Remus, although extremely weak \nalso tried to help, with their magic but both failed.\n\n<br></p><p>Minerva felt horrible watching and nobody noticed her slipping away, probably to prepare a potion to go back in time. </p><p>But\n then she comes back, with the Philosopher\u2019s stone. Thought to have been\n destroyed by Dumbledore and Nicolas Flamel years ago. Apparently right \nafter the Battle of Hogwarts, Minerva back in time to stop them from \ndestroying it, so she can use it to talk to Dumbledore and so others can\n use it to talk to their loved ones who had passed away during the war \nin her timeline. She has had this stone in her possession ever since. \nNever once using it\u2019s true power of Resurrection. She knows that the \nstone can only be used toe resurrect one soul before it destroys itself,\n so she\u2019s been keeping it locked away somewhere only she knew the \nlocation for it.<br></p><p>She didn\u2019t even hesitate, she went to work \nstraight way. She used the stone and with a brilliant flash of green \nlight and a collection of ghostly voices and an almost theatrical scene \nthat took everyone\u2019s breath away, everyone stared on at Dean. Nothing \nhappened. Hours go by, Cas refused to leave Dean\u2019s side and Sam tried to\n force himself to accept the reality of he situation and plan what to do\n with his body. <br></p><p>McGonagall gives Remus and Sirius ALL the \ninformation they need to actually stop Voldemort. She doesn\u2019t tell them \nanything about their deaths. They asked her about that topic earlier on.\n She said that they didn\u2019t die in her timeline, but that they must be \ndead in the current reality because of Voldemort, which is why they \ncan\u2019t find themselves. She lied to them because she can\u2019t risk having \nmore alterations to the timeline that could have catastrophic results \nagain. She is very much away that she is basically sending them to their\n deaths for the greater good, and she is going to have to live with that\n for the rest of her life. She will never forgiver herself, but it is \nwhat must be done. <br></p><p>Sam, Cas, Mary, Bobby and Jack, distraught\n take Dean\u2019s remains to Lawrence, Kansas. Planning on burying him \nproperly where their story started.</p><p>Sam and Bobby dug the hole \nwhile Mary and Jack built a casket of sorts for him. They don\u2019t want to \nburn his remains, its not something Dean would\u2019ve wanted. They close the\n lid of the casket and carefully lower him into the ground. They say all\n that they can\u2019t think to say and start to bury him. \u00a0They all lingered \nafterwards, not wanting to leave. After about half an hour of staring at\n his grave, Sam starts to walk back to the car. They have a long drive \nback to the Bunker where he can properly mourn.</p><p>Cas, however, \ndoesn\u2019t step away from the grave.

They accidentally meet \nat the scene of the fight, almost fight each other then find out they&rsquo;re\n on the same team and decided to work together to stop the madness. <br /><br />There&rsquo;s\n going to be an insanely painful scene where Sirius as Padfoot is \nfighting my OC as Remus/Moony and Sirius is going to be seriously \ninjured by him and Remus will be fighting with Moony internally trying \nto force the demon out and self harming trying to escape to reality. He \nalmost kills his Padfoot. Similar to that parallel in that scene in SPN \nwhere Cas almost kills dean and Dean breaks Naomi&rsquo;s mind control on Cas,\n Padfoot will eventually get through to Remus enough for Remus and Moony\n to team up for a few seconds for just long enough to overthrown the \ndemon, but the demon escapes. <br /></p><p>No amount of exorcising can \nkick him out of his body, Sam and Castiel have tried relentlessly, but \nhe used Lupin&rsquo;s magic to hex a make-shift force-field to trap his demon \nsoul into the body. When Lupin overpowered the Demon, there was a second\n where the hex was broken due to lack of concentration and he was able \nto smoke out of there.\n\n<br /></p><p>Meanwhile, Michael isn&rsquo;t giving up and things get so bad that\n it has come down to, stop trying to save dean, and just kill Michael. \nWith the demon gone, everyone is now trying to kill Michael/Dean and it \nis pure carnage and mayhem. Eventually they succeed by combining \nmultiple killing spells and and being stabbed by both Ruby&rsquo;s Demon \nkilling blade, Cas&rsquo; angel blade, and a shotgun blast to the head, all at\n the same time.. Michael and Dean are both obliterated. It seemed like \nextreme over-kill but it was just barely powerful enough to kill the \nArch Angel.<br /></p><p>The scene is incredibly painful and Cas tries and \ntries and tries to heal the damage but it&rsquo;s too late. Dean is gone. Cas \ndoesn&rsquo;t give up, he keeps trying and trying until he is so physically \nexhausted he cannot physically use another ounce of his Angel juice. All\n he was able to really do was patch up most of his scars and mend some \nof his limbs back into place. Sirius and Remus, although extremely weak \nalso tried to help, with their magic but both failed.\n\n<br /></p><p>Minerva felt horrible watching and nobody noticed her slipping away, probably to prepare a potion to go back in time. </p><p>But\n then she comes back, with the Philosopher&rsquo;s stone. Thought to have been\n destroyed by Dumbledore and Nicolas Flamel years ago. Apparently right \nafter the Battle of Hogwarts, Minerva back in time to stop them from \ndestroying it, so she can use it to talk to Dumbledore and so others can\n use it to talk to their loved ones who had passed away during the war \nin her timeline. She has had this stone in her possession ever since. \nNever once using it&rsquo;s true power of Resurrection. She knows that the \nstone can only be used toe resurrect one soul before it destroys itself,\n so she&rsquo;s been keeping it locked away somewhere only she knew the \nlocation for it.<br /></p><p>She didn&rsquo;t even hesitate, she went to work \nstraight way. She used the stone and with a brilliant flash of green \nlight and a collection of ghostly voices and an almost theatrical scene \nthat took everyone&rsquo;s breath away, everyone stared on at Dean. Nothing \nhappened. Hours go by, Cas refused to leave Dean&rsquo;s side and Sam tried to\n force himself to accept the reality of he situation and plan what to do\n with his body. <br /></p><p>McGonagall gives Remus and Sirius ALL the \ninformation they need to actually stop Voldemort. She doesn&rsquo;t tell them \nanything about their deaths. They asked her about that topic earlier on.\n She said that they didn&rsquo;t die in her timeline, but that they must be \ndead in the current reality because of Voldemort, which is why they \ncan&rsquo;t find themselves. She lied to them because she can&rsquo;t risk having \nmore alterations to the timeline that could have catastrophic results \nagain. She is very much away that she is basically sending them to their\n deaths for the greater good, and she is going to have to live with that\n for the rest of her life. She will never forgiver herself, but it is \nwhat must be done. <br /></p><p>Sam, Cas, Mary, Bobby and Jack, distraught\n take Dean&rsquo;s remains to Lawrence, Kansas. Planning on burying him \nproperly where their story started.</p><p>Sam and Bobby dug the hole \nwhile Mary and Jack built a casket of sorts for him. They don&rsquo;t want to \nburn his remains, its not something Dean would&rsquo;ve wanted. They close the\n lid of the casket and carefully lower him into the ground. They say all\n that they can&rsquo;t think to say and start to bury him. &nbsp;They all lingered \nafterwards, not wanting to leave. After about half an hour of staring at\n his grave, Sam starts to walk back to the car. They have a long drive \nback to the Bunker where he can properly mourn.</p><p>Cas, however, \ndoesn&rsquo;t step away from the grave. He is knelt down with his with his \nhands a few inches deep into the dirt just over the grave. He is still \nin shock and refuses to accept this. After awhile longer, his sadness \nturns into anger. He becomes uncontrollably angry and slams his hand \ndown as hard as he can, disheveling the dirt around him. He looked up to\n the sky and is seconds away from screaming at Chuck for letting such a \nhorrible thing happen. But just as he&rsquo;s about to leap up to his feet and\n scream, a faint tapping noise catches his attention.</p><p>All of his \nanger suddenly gone, he, kneels forward and presses his ear almost to \nthe ground, listens intently. He doesn&rsquo;t hear anything, but he waits; \nstill not giving up hope. After a few seconds of silence, he heard the \nsound again.</p><p>tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap&hellip;. <br /></p><p>He \nscreams to Sam. &ldquo;Do you hear that?&rdquo; Sam quickly joins him, and listens. \nHe hears nothing. Mary and Bobby and Jack hurry over and also hear \nnothing. They think Cas is making it up because he doesn&rsquo;t want to \naccept it.</p><p>Cas insists on hearing a tapping noise and grabs the shovel out of the car and starts digging.</p><p>Bobby\n makes a move to try to stop him, saying don&rsquo;t bother, the boy&rsquo;s dead. \nCas angrily shoves him away too hard and starts frantically digging. \nWhen he&rsquo;s about halfway down and has screamed Deans&rsquo; name half a dozen \ntimes already, sudden Sam started to hear the tapping. Sam was doubtful \nfor a second but then as Cas started digging deeper the sound started to\n sound like a knocking. Sam and Mary realized in unison that the \nimpossible might have actually occurred. They both started digging with \ntheir hands alongside Cas as fast as they could. Still uncertain, with \ntears blurring their vision.</p><p>Cas still screaming Dean&rsquo;s name and \ndigging faster and faster. The knocking started sounding like banging, \nand there was another muffled sound accompanying it.</p><p>Almost \nthrough to the casket, the banging was getting louder and louder and the\n muffled voice was Dean&rsquo;s voice screaming &ldquo;Cas!&rdquo; over and over again. \nThey thew open the casket and destroyed the door in the process.</p><p>Dean was alive!! The stone worked! It took just over twenty four hours, but it worked! <br /></p><p>\nDean was groggy, and in a lot of pain. He could barely lift himself into a sitting position.\n\n<br /></p><p>Cas hugged him tight then quickly healed his wounds as much \nas he could, before he and Sam lifted him out of the grave and onto \nsolid ground.. Sam, Mary, Jack and Bobby each got a chance to hug him. \nAll of them laughing is disbelief.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me say yes to another dick with wings&ndash;.&rdquo; Dean coughed up some blood. &ldquo;&ndash;Ever again.&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yo-ou bet.&rdquo; Said Sam with a smile, trying to hide the break in his voice.</p>",

When Lyra Lestrange\u2019s old headmaster offers her a position as Defence Against the Dark Arts Teacher she finds herself thrown into an adventure involving a secret affair with a colleague, discovering the cure for a disease and dealing with students cursing themselves.

She obliged and enjoyed the company of her family before returning to Hogwarts. This time around, Draco did not cry. He hugged his cousin and waved goodbye, promising to continue writing letters to her. Her Aunt and Uncle both embraced her as well, reminding her that she was always welcome in their home.</p><p>Lyra took the familiar path back to Hogwarts via Hogsmeade and headed straight down towards the Dungeons. Breakfast had taken more time than she expected so she was quick on her feet, hoping to not be late. She managed to knock on the door precisely as her watch hit 10am. Just as promptly, Severus opened the door of his office and welcomed her in.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the test subjects?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cHow\u2019d you research go?\u201d</p><p>She raised the book in response, \u201cI had to go back to the Manor for this but it\u2019s all here.\u201d She flicked open the book into the relevant page and handed it Severus.</p><p>He read it quickly and looked up at her, \u201cI trust you know your latin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she replied, \u201cUncle made me take several languages over my schooling years. I did Russian and French whilst at Durmstrang then Latin and Ancient Greek.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed, \u201cNo wonder you were so much trouble.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows playfully with a smirk. \u201cIt does help with spell creation which I dabbled in when I was young but I found it extremely helpful for human anatomy.\u201d She smiled sweetly, \u201cShall we get to experimenting.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and revealed the rats that would be the subjects of the experiment. After checking that they were in relatively good health the two quickly brewed the potion that held the lowest concentration of bloodroot. Lyra finished the potion as instructed casting \u201c <i>Ire dura mater cerebri</i> ,\u201d and waving her wand in a circular motion thrice clockwise and once counterclockwise. The potion sparked, indicating the success of the incantation.</p><p>Lyra took hold of one of the feral rats whilst Severus levitated a vial into the cauldron to fill it before emptying it into the mouth of the rat. This process was repeated with 3 other rats which were put in separate cages. Now they had to wait and observe.</p><p>\u201cHow long do you think it\u2019ll take to see a reaction?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDepends,\u201d he shrugged. \u201cIt could be hours to days. I\u2019m still a bit uncertain about the concentration of bloodroot. It\u2019s still rather high, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019ll be safe for human consumption. Should\u2019ve taken me up on the student offer.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled slightly at his joke, \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to wait and see. I\u2019ll take these back to my rooms and I\u2019ll let you know how it goes.\u201d She levitated the cages out the door in front of her and paused for a moment, turning to look at the Potions Master. \u201cThank you, Severus. I really appreciate your help.\u201d</p><p>He nodded curtly and Lyra turned, leaving the office with the rats in tow. It earned a few peculiar looks from students but she simply ignored them, her eyes were more focused on the progress of the rats. They seemed fine but Lyra wanted to make sure that they would stay that way and for some reason she believed that if she watched them nothing bad would happen. There were a few times where Lyra would stumble on the staircase as she moved up it as her focus was on the behaviour of the rats.</p><p>She settled into the comfort of her office, the rats in view of her desk whilst she worked on lesson plans. After about an hour she noticed that the rats were getting rather sick, one had begun to vomit another had diarrhoea. She scratched her head in frustration as all she could do was sit back and observe them, ensuring that they had water and food.</p><p>The first one died at 4pm. It had first fallen asleep but after checking Lyra noticed that it was in a coma, its organs had begun to shut down. She noticed in another its eyes began to look like glass. They were all showing symptoms of toxicity. It was only a matter of hours before they were all dead.</p><p>She dissected them all, one by one, to confirm what had killed them. She sighed as she realised Severus was right, the concentration of bloodroot was too high to be metabolised by rats resulting in low blood pressure, tissue necrosis and eventual death. Audibly, she groaned as she felt like she was so close to the solution yet it just seemed to slip through her hands.</p><p>Lyra attempted to rationalise the results, thinking maybe if they reduced the amount of bloodroot used it may not kill them. Maybe they died because they were rats, she may just have to take the solution herself but she knew it was inadvisable. She debated internally as she went to the staff room to have something to eat. Relief overtook her as she saw Severus sitting there eating and she began to splurge the details on their experiment and work through her thoughts.</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cI told you the concentration of bloodroot is too high for consumption.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if we try the other spell?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He tilted his head slightly, \u201cIt\u2019s worth a try but as soon as those worms die the potion will be absorbed by the host and you\u2019ll face the same problem.\u201d</p><p>She groaned, \u201cThe other option is the Tentacula Venom. At least we know it won\u2019t kill humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be able to test it on a rat though,\u201d he said, \u201cIt\u2019s rather lethal to other animals.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her face in frustration.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d he said. His fingers twitched on the table as though he wanted to reach out and comfort the witch. He wasn\u2019t sure how she\u2019d feel about the affection so he kept to himself. \u201cIf you don\u2019t figure it out someone else will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s encouraging,\u201d she said, pursing her lips.</p><p>His eyebrows raised in a questioning manner, \u201cWhy are you so determined to discover a cure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a puzzle I want to solve. I\u2019ve invested a lot of time into this and I want to be the one to discover the cure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should write about your findings and publish that,\u201d he suggested. \u201cMaybe someone will be able to discover a cure based off of that and it\u2019ll be something to focus on while you still work on it. You never know it might allow you to see it from a different light.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, her head resting in her hands in a dramatic demonstration of her exhaustion. \u201cI guess,\u201d she frowned, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I feel so close to the answer and it\u2019s frustrating.\u201d</p><p>His lips pursed in an expression of sympathy and threw caution to the wind. His hand reached out to hold her free one and held it. He looked into her eyes and encouraged her. \u201cKeep working on it. I\u2019ll be here if you need me.\u201d</p><p>A half smile formed on her lips and she nodded, \u201cThanks, Sev.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her hand before taking his leave. Her eyes lingered where his hand once was and she felt an overwhelming amount of sadness as she was reminded of the relationship she couldn\u2019t pursue. She reminded herself that she should be thankful that at least he was still there as a colleague and a friend but her heart desired more.</p><p>Lyra lingered in the staff room for a few moments, interacting with a few of her peers before resigning to her quarters. She wondered how she was going to get to sleep that night with the thoughts of disappointment from her failed experiment as well as the intense feelings that remained with Severus. She remembered the potion that he had brewed for her and took it but if anything his thoughtfulness made her want him more but those thoughts were soon put to rest when she fell asleep.</p><p>When Lyra woke up the next day there was a moment where she was ok, where she felt at peace and everything was alright in the world but a few minutes passed and her reality came crashing into her. It was like a tidal wave of feelings that engulfed her and spilled from her eyes. Up until then she had been managing to keep her feelings in check but as her research had fell through she felt the walls that she built up crumble down too. She allowed herself to cry and mourn, she acknowledged her feelings and wished to spend all day in bed to weep over her failed experiment and relationship but with a deep breath the crying stopped. Lyra picked herself up and wiped away the tears that stained her cheeks before dressing herself to face the day.</p><p>Classes were uneventful that week, Lyra spent her breaks seclusion where she was working on either class work or her report on her findings. It took a few days until she could gather the nerve to face any of her colleagues again, afraid that they would ask and she\u2019d have nothing to show for it. The dreaded moment occurred during lunch that Thursday.</p><p>\u201cLyra,\u201d the Muggle Studies Professor approached her with her lunch in hand, \u201cHow\u2019ve you been? I haven\u2019t seen you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusy,\u201d Lyra replied. She attempted to flip the question but Charity \u00a0got in before her.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your work on the cure going?\u201d</p><p>Lyra gritted her teeth and forced a smile, \u201cWell.\u201d</p><p>Charity nodded slowly in response and an idea popped into Lyra\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Charity,\u201d the younger Professor urged, \u201cWhat do muggles use to cure disease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean medicine?\u201d the witch\u2019s eyes lit up as she began to ramble. \u201cThey\u2019re really quite bright, they make pills and all sorts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do they administer them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, like us they have medicine you can drink and apply topically,\u201d she explained, \u201cThey have eye drops and ear drops. They also use injections which is where they use a needle to pierce the skin and insert the drug into the muscle, bloodstream sometimes even the spine! Otherwise there are inhalants, some drugs are inserted rectally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, through the rectum,\u201d Charity continued, \u201cThey have patches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo before the rectum,\u201d Lyra said, \u201cInhalants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s common for sedatives for operations. They inhale it through a pump, tube or mask.\u201d</p><p>Lyra\u2019s brain was ticking over, it was so obvious. Why didn\u2019t she think of it earlier? If the drug was inhaled it could travel quicker into the bloodstream than if it was ingested. What if one was to inhale the vapours of tentacula venom rather than ingest it? Would they still experience the same side effects?</p><p>She was itching to test out her hypothesis but she still had two classes for the day. Anxiously, she continued to check her watch for the time awaiting the time for her to run down to the dungeons and test out her new hypothesis. When the clock ticked over she dismissed her class, running up to her room to grab a batch of worms and headed down to Professor Snape\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cLyra,\u201d he acknowledged as she caught him moving between his classroom and his office.</p><p>\u201cSeverus,\u201d she grinned, \u201cI have an idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what might that be?\u201d he asked, his eyebrows raised in intrigue.</p><p>\u201cVapourisation,\u201d she said earning a curious look from the Potions Master. \u201cOf the tentacula venom. I mean we know it has a nasty side effect if you drink it but does it have the same effect if you inhale it\u2019s vapours? Also, would that still kill the worm. I mean we\u2019d have to test it out, I\u2019m not sure whether the toxins will evaporate with the liquid when boiled or whether the heat will just lead to denaturation but it can\u2019t hurt to try.\u201d She had spat out her ideas at a million miles per minute before dramatically saying, \u201cThis could be revolutionary.\u201d</p><p>Severus was amused by her enthusiasm and gestured towards his office. She lead them in and they quickly got to work. They boiled the tentacula venom then Lyra levitated a worm above the vapours and watched closely. She was nervous, watching it closely for any signs that it was working. After a few minutes the worm shrivelled and died.</p><p>She grinned to her partner, \u201cIt works. Now to test it out, would you do the honours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not suicidal enough to inhale pure tentacula venom fumes,\u201d he said, his eyes narrowed at the girl.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a healer, if anything goes wrong-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were a trainee healer, maybe we should dilute it a bit before trying to inhale it?\u201d</p><p>She laughed sheepishly, \u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>Over the next hour the two played with the concentration of the tentacula venom with just water, attempting to find low dose that would still kill the worm. Despite diluting it, the venom still remained rather potent in lower doses. They ended up settling for a 4:1 ratio of water to venom to trial.</p><p>\u201cDo I really have to be the one to test it out?\u201d she asked with apprehension.</p><p>\u201cWe could just borrow a student from the hallway,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cDo you really take joy in torturing students?\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head in a questioning manner which earned a small laugh from the witch.</p><p>\u201cIf I turn purple, I wish for you to kill me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI thought it was your favourite colour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is but I don\u2019t fancy my skin turning that colour,\u201d she replied, amusement heavy in her voice.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to keep stalling?\u201d</p><p>Lyra opened her mouth as though she was about to rebut though she held her tongue and smiled at the wizard. She took a deep breath to calm herself before placing her head over the cauldron and inhaling it. A moan escaped her lips and she screwed up her face holding her nose, stumbling back into her seat.</p><p>\u201cIt burns,\u201d she groaned tears beginning to leak from her eyes. \u201cFrom my nostrils to my head and now just my head. It feels like it\u2019s on fire.\u201d</p><p>The wizard rushed to her side and held her, stroking her back. \u201cJust breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy for you to say,\u201d she replied taking a few more deep breaths through her mouth as breathing through her nose seemed to irritate it further. \u201cAm I purple yet?\u201d</p><p>Severus chuckled, \u201cNot yet.\u201d He began to stroke the witch\u2019s head and she rested it on his stomach.</p><p>\u201cThank heavens,\u201d she said. A few minutes passed before the pain began to subside, \u201cI just feel like I have an awful headache now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not so bad,\u201d he replied. \u201cI think you should stay with me tonight so I can monitor any side effects, I wouldn\u2019t want you dying in your sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow sweet,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cYou call it sweet, I call it not wanting to face the fury of your Uncle.\u201d</p><p>Lyra pulled away from his touch at the mention of her Uncle, remembering their discussion. \u201cI can get Madam Pomfrey to monitor me,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019d hate to keep you up through the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be more comfortable if it was me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have classes in the morning,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep not knowing whether or not you were ok.\u201d</p><p>Her heart lodged itself into her throat and butterflies began to flutter in her stomach. She looked up at the concerned eyes of the Potions Master and nodded.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he said, \u201cLet\u2019s have dinner.\u201d</p><p>Severus extended a hand to her and she took it, her fingers slipping so easily into his almost like his hands were a perfect match for hers. She let go before they left the room, not needing rumours to follow the two as they walked to the staff room together but she wondered if he knew what effect his touch had on her. She had tried to be so careful and to keep her distance but quickly she found herself slipping into old habits, falling back in love with the man.</p><p>The two ate and engaged in conversation with their colleagues, discussing the progress of her experiment as well as gossiping about students. Professor Kettleburn dropped by and gave Lyra his research into the pathogen that caused Psyrot. Her fingers were crossed that their current hypothesis would be correct. They dwelled in the staffroom for a while, continuing to exchange some small talk before the two wandered off to her quarters.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to take your regular potion,\u201d he said as they entered the classroom, \u201cIt would ruin the results.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and paused for a moment to turning to address the Potions Master. \u201cSev, thank you for giving me the draught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needed it,\u201d his brow furrowed unsure as to why she was thanking him. \u201cYou should\u2019ve just asked. I told you, I would I always have it on hand for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I stopped needing it for a while and we weren\u2019t talking so I thought-\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyra,\u201d he said firmly, closing the gap between them. \u201cI still care about you, I don\u2019t think I could ever stop. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been helping you out, it\u2019s not just because you\u2019re my colleague but because I love you.\u201d</p><p>Confessions of love were supposed to be received with happiness but in all honesty, the expression just saddened her. She knew she loved him too but it all just seemed too complicated for a real relationship to be shared between them.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the girl who said she didn\u2019t care about blood purity?\u201d he asked, stroking her face.</p><p>She jerked away from his touch, her feelings of sadness quickly turning to anger. \u201cDon\u2019t mention something I said a month ago and try to twist it into me rejecting you. You\u2019re the one who said pursuing this would be unwise. You can\u2019t be so hot and cold and expect me to still be there waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>Severus gritted his teeth as Lyra\u2019s emotions began to unwind. He took the anger that was seething from her words. He wasn\u2019t sure of what else to do, his eyes looked down in shame knowing that he was responsible for her outburst.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how much you\u2019re fucking with me right now?\u201d she yelled, \u201cI\u2019ve been keeping my distance, trying to get over my feelings for you and now you\u2019re back here again, touching me, telling me you love me and getting me to feel all this shit for you. You got me to confess how I felt about you and then you tell me that you fucking love me, not once but twice, and make me think that maybe we could be good together but then you take that little bit of hope that I have for us and you squash it. You deny it and it fucking hurts.\u201d Tears began to spill from her eyes, \u201cI can\u2019t do this, Sev. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her and whispered, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d and that was enough for her. She allowed herself to continue crying into his arms, the sobs that wracked through her body moved him as well and he felt the pain that he had caused her. Over and over again he whispered \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d and that seemed to calm her along with his fingers that were caressing her back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair, Sev,\u201d she mumbled into his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not?\u201d he asked, pulling himself away slightly so she could peak her head out and speak.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just play with my emotions like that,\u201d she said, \u201cI care about you and I want to be with you and I\u2019m scared too but I\u2019m not leading you on.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his lips pressed against her head. \u201cI never intended to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted us to try,\u201d she muttered, \u201cI wanted to see if it would work, to see if it was real and then go from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to try,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cYou have to be honest,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nodded, \u201cYou can\u2019t walk away if it gets too hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk,\u201d he repeated, kissing the girl on the forehead. In his mind he whispered promises to himself that he would protect her and that this time he would succeed.</p><p>Lyra looked back up at the wizard who was affectionately kissing her and gave him a faint smile. She pulled him close to her, pushing herself up onto her tiptoes to close the gap between their lips. They kissed deeply for a moment before parting.</p><p>\u201cYou need to sleep,\u201d he said.</p><p>She hummed in response, \u201cShower first?\u201d She sucked in her bottom lip as she looked up at him, her eyes laced with desire.</p><p>\u201cI feel as though this is how you always con me into sleeping with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCon you?\u201d she asked playfully.</p><p>He hummed happily as his lips met her neck and began to nip her exposed flesh with his mouth. \u201cIt always seems to be the shower or the bath.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled a small laugh, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a con. This is merely the payback I said I would owe you for mentoring me in potions. Plus if you\u2019re going to stay up all night looking after me I think I should make it worth your while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, really.\u201d Her hands began to undress herself and she discarded her robes on the floor. Left in her underwear, she pulled away from the man and entered the ensuite attached to her bedroom. He followed behind, using his wand to quickly undress himself not having the patience to undo every single one of his buttons.</p><p>Lyra switched the shower on and turned to face him, her fingers unlatching her bra and allowing it to drop. Severus approached, now in only his briefs and began to unleash an onslaught of kisses on her lips, chin and neck. His hands made quick work of their remaining garments and he scooped up Lyra, wrapping her thighs around his waist and carrying her into the shower.</p><p>Lyra giggled as Severus mouth tickled her neck and the water soaked them both, dampening their hair. He pressed her body against the wall as leverage, one hand remaining firm on her thigh whilst the other appreciated her breasts. He groaned as his cock began to stir, \u201cFuck, I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>Her arms remained wrapped around his neck with one of her hands buried loosely in his hair. Severus\u2019 hand reached between them, wrapping around his cock. He shifted her weight up, positioning his member at her entrance before letting her slide down its length. She moaned loudly as he gripped her thighs, lustfully fucking her against the shower wall.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s eyes were squeezed tightly shut as his hips assaulted hers, drawing out sounds of pleasure with every thrust. Severus watched her, his eyes greedily taking in every aspect of her. The way her face was twisted in bliss and how her body looked with water droplets cascading down them. Passionately, his face approached hers and their lips met. Lyra moaned into the kiss, attempting to kiss back but her head would pull away as she audibly expressed her body\u2019s desires.</p><p>Severus\u2019 arms grew tired so he slid out of his lover and lowered her to the ground. Wordlessly, he guided her to turn around, her hands rested on the tiled wall and her back curved perfectly back so her ass was in the air ready for him to enter again. With ease, his member slid back into her pussy and he began to fuck her furiously. His hands were allowed to wander freely and they settled on her breasts, his fingers pulling at her nipples earn loud moans of approval.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s hand slid down between her legs and she began to rub the sensitive bundle of nerves that rested between them. The pleasure she felt from the combined stimulation of her nipples and cunt made her back arch further, pressing herself firmly against the wizard. Severus took this as an offer, one hand abandoned its post relenting on the nipple torture and instead appreciated the curve of her ass.</p><p>He groped it, enjoying the feel of her firm flesh then he slapped it, resulting in a moan of surprise. He felt the walls that surrounded his cock twitch in excitement. Smirking to himself he continued to spank her as he plunged in and out of her. He had an overwhelming desire to turn her skin red but he also wished to come.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s pussy continued to twitch as she neared her orgasm. It was beginning to bear down around him and the sounds that were spilling from her lips were intoxicating. He felt so close and knew she was too but was afraid that he would come before she did. \u201cLyra, I\u2019m not going to last. Sweet Circe, your cunt is so tight.\u201d</p><p>Those words drove Lyra right over the edge, a strained moan escaped her as she came hard. A few more thrusts and Severus joined her in the throws of orgasm, filling her with his seed. He slid out and pulled her body close to his to support her in the unsteadiness of her orgasm afterglow.</p><p>Her head nuzzled into his chest allowing the water of the shower to soak her hair and clean her body. She pulled away and kissed him before reaching for her bottle of shampoo. She lathered his hair, styling it into a mohawk she giggled at her creation before beginning to wash her own hair.</p><p>\u201cAm I allowed to rinse this off?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I think the mohawk suits you,\u201d she replied, \u201cIt\u2019s very muggle punk.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes before dipping his head under the water. Next Lyra reached for the bar of soap. Severus allowed her hands to roam his body, covering him in suds before rinsing them away. He returned the favour, taking particular care in soaping her more intimate areas. His finger lingered on the puckered star between her cheeks and he leaned in to whisper, \u201cI can\u2019t wait until I get to fuck this hole too.\u201d</p><p>She felt heat grow in the pit of her stomach at the suggestion of his words. The sweet baritone of his voice saying something so vulgar seemed to accentuate her reaction, her face flushed and her eyes cast downwards afraid to meet his.</p><p>\u201cHorny again already?\u201d he asked, \u201cSurely this isn\u2019t a side effect of your treatment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a side effect of your words,\u201d she quipped. \u201cI think you\u2019re ruining the results of my experiment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stop then,\u201d he suggested withdrawing his touch and earning a glare from the witch. \u201cHow is your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she shrugged.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you to bed,\u201d he said as he stepped out of the shower.</p><p>Severus reached for his wand and with a few waves he switched the shower off and non-verbally dried their bodies. Lyra slipped into her pyjamas whilst Severus redressed into his robes, claiming that if he got comfortable he would want to sleep too.</p><p>\u201cCould you lay with me until I fall asleep?\u201d she asked as she slid into bed.</p><p>He nodded, \u201cDo you have anything I could read?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few healing books here and there,\u201d she said, \u201cMake yourself at home. You can read my report too and let me know if it sounds alright.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were heavy and she began to slip into sleep before he even joined her. She did fight it briefly, wanting to enjoy his company. She felt his weight shift the bed slightly and she mumbled, \u201cSev, you know I love you too, yeah?\u201d</p><p>He stroked her hair, brushing it out of her face. \u201cNo, but I\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Severus Snape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSide effect of the inhalation of Venomous Tentacula juice includes horniness and confessions of love.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, \u201cI\u2019m serious, Sev.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Lyra Lestrange.\u201d</p>",

Breakfast had taken more time than she expected so she was quick on her feet, hoping to not be late. She managed to knock on the door precisely as her watch hit 10am. Just as promptly, Severus opened the door of his office and welcomed her in.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the test subjects?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cHow\u2019d you research go?\u201d</p><p>She raised the book in response, \u201cI had to go back to the Manor for this but it\u2019s all here.\u201d She flicked open the book into the relevant page and handed it Severus.</p><p>He read it quickly and looked up at her, \u201cI trust you know your latin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she replied, \u201cUncle made me take several languages over my schooling years. I did Russian and French whilst at Durmstrang then Latin and Ancient Greek.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed, \u201cNo wonder you were so much trouble.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows playfully with a smirk. \u201cIt does help with spell creation which I dabbled in when I was young but I found it extremely helpful for human anatomy.\u201d She smiled sweetly, \u201cShall we get to experimenting.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and revealed the rats that would be the subjects of the experiment. After checking that they were in relatively good health the two quickly brewed the potion that held the lowest concentration of bloodroot. Lyra finished the potion as instructed casting \u201c <i>Ire dura mater cerebri</i> ,\u201d and waving her wand in a circular motion thrice clockwise and once counterclockwise. The potion sparked, indicating the success of the incantation.</p><p>Lyra took hold of one of the feral rats whilst Severus levitated a vial into the cauldron to fill it before emptying it into the mouth of the rat. This process was repeated with 3 other rats which were put in separate cages. Now they had to wait and observe.</p><p>\u201cHow long do you think it\u2019ll take to see a reaction?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDepends,\u201d he shrugged. \u201cIt could be hours to days. I\u2019m still a bit uncertain about the concentration of bloodroot. It\u2019s still rather high, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019ll be safe for human consumption. Should\u2019ve taken me up on the student offer.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled slightly at his joke, \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to wait and see. I\u2019ll take these back to my rooms and I\u2019ll let you know how it goes.\u201d She levitated the cages out the door in front of her and paused for a moment, turning to look at the Potions Master. \u201cThank you, Severus. I really appreciate your help.\u201d</p><p>He nodded curtly and Lyra turned, leaving the office with the rats in tow. It earned a few peculiar looks from students but she simply ignored them, her eyes were more focused on the progress of the rats. They seemed fine but Lyra wanted to make sure that they would stay that way and for some reason she believed that if she watched them nothing bad would happen. There were a few times where Lyra would stumble on the staircase as she moved up it as her focus was on the behaviour of the rats.</p><p>She settled into the comfort of her office, the rats in view of her desk whilst she worked on lesson plans. After about an hour she noticed that the rats were getting rather sick, one had begun to vomit another had diarrhoea. She scratched her head in frustration as all she could do was sit back and observe them, ensuring that they had water and food.</p><p>The first one died at 4pm. It had first fallen asleep but after checking Lyra noticed that it was in a coma, its organs had begun to shut down. She noticed in another its eyes began to look like glass. They were all showing symptoms of toxicity. It was only a matter of hours before they were all dead.</p><p>She dissected them all, one by one, to confirm what had killed them. She sighed as she realised Severus was right, the concentration of bloodroot was too high to be metabolised by rats resulting in low blood pressure, tissue necrosis and eventual death. Audibly, she groaned as she felt like she was so close to the solution yet it just seemed to slip through her hands.</p><p>Lyra attempted to rationalise the results, thinking maybe if they reduced the amount of bloodroot used it may not kill them. Maybe they died because they were rats, she may just have to take the solution herself but she knew it was inadvisable. She debated internally as she went to the staff room to have something to eat. Relief overtook her as she saw Severus sitting there eating and she began to splurge the details on their experiment and work through her thoughts.</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cI told you the concentration of bloodroot is too high for consumption.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if we try the other spell?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He tilted his head slightly, \u201cIt\u2019s worth a try but as soon as those worms die the potion will be absorbed by the host and you\u2019ll face the same problem.\u201d</p><p>She groaned, \u201cThe other option is the Tentacula Venom. At least we know it won\u2019t kill humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be able to test it on a rat though,\u201d he said, \u201cIt\u2019s rather lethal to other animals.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her face in frustration.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d he said. His fingers twitched on the table as though he wanted to reach out and comfort the witch. He wasn\u2019t sure how she\u2019d feel about the affection so he kept to himself. \u201cIf you don\u2019t figure it out someone else will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s encouraging,\u201d she said, pursing her lips.</p><p>His eyebrows raised in a questioning manner, \u201cWhy are you so determined to discover a cure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a puzzle I want to solve. I\u2019ve invested a lot of time into this and I want to be the one to discover the cure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should write about your findings and publish that,\u201d he suggested. \u201cMaybe someone will be able to discover a cure based off of that and it\u2019ll be something to focus on while you still work on it. You never know it might allow you to see it from a different light.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, her head resting in her hands in a dramatic demonstration of her exhaustion. \u201cI guess,\u201d she frowned, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I feel so close to the answer and it\u2019s frustrating.\u201d</p><p>His lips pursed in an expression of sympathy and threw caution to the wind. His hand reached out to hold her free one and held it. He looked into her eyes and encouraged her. \u201cKeep working on it. I\u2019ll be here if you need me.\u201d</p><p>A half smile formed on her lips and she nodded, \u201cThanks, Sev.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her hand before taking his leave. Her eyes lingered where his hand once was and she felt an overwhelming amount of sadness as she was reminded of the relationship she couldn\u2019t pursue. She reminded herself that she should be thankful that at least he was still there as a colleague and a friend but her heart desired more.</p><p>Lyra lingered in the staff room for a few moments, interacting with a few of her peers before resigning to her quarters. She wondered how she was going to get to sleep that night with the thoughts of disappointment from her failed experiment as well as the intense feelings that remained with Severus. She remembered the potion that he had brewed for her and took it but if anything his thoughtfulness made her want him more but those thoughts were soon put to rest when she fell asleep.</p><p>When Lyra woke up the next day there was a moment where she was ok, where she felt at peace and everything was alright in the world but a few minutes passed and her reality came crashing into her. It was like a tidal wave of feelings that engulfed her and spilled from her eyes. Up until then she had been managing to keep her feelings in check but as her research had fell through she felt the walls that she built up crumble down too. She allowed herself to cry and mourn, she acknowledged her feelings and wished to spend all day in bed to weep over her failed experiment and relationship but with a deep breath the crying stopped. Lyra picked herself up and wiped away the tears that stained her cheeks before dressing herself to face the day.</p><p>Classes were uneventful that week, Lyra spent her breaks seclusion where she was working on either class work or her report on her findings. It took a few days until she could gather the nerve to face any of her colleagues again, afraid that they would ask and she\u2019d have nothing to show for it. The dreaded moment occurred during lunch that Thursday.</p><p>\u201cLyra,\u201d the Muggle Studies Professor approached her with her lunch in hand, \u201cHow\u2019ve you been? I haven\u2019t seen you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusy,\u201d Lyra replied. She attempted to flip the question but Charity \u00a0got in before her.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your work on the cure going?\u201d</p><p>Lyra gritted her teeth and forced a smile, \u201cWell.\u201d</p><p>Charity nodded slowly in response and an idea popped into Lyra\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Charity,\u201d the younger Professor urged, \u201cWhat do muggles use to cure disease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean medicine?\u201d the witch\u2019s eyes lit up as she began to ramble. \u201cThey\u2019re really quite bright, they make pills and all sorts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do they administer them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, like us they have medicine you can drink and apply topically,\u201d she explained, \u201cThey have eye drops and ear drops. They also use injections which is where they use a needle to pierce the skin and insert the drug into the muscle, bloodstream sometimes even the spine! Otherwise there are inhalants, some drugs are inserted rectally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, through the rectum,\u201d Charity continued, \u201cThey have patches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo before the rectum,\u201d Lyra said, \u201cInhalants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s common for sedatives for operations. They inhale it through a pump, tube or mask.\u201d</p><p>Lyra\u2019s brain was ticking over, it was so obvious. Why didn\u2019t she think of it earlier? If the drug was inhaled it could travel quicker into the bloodstream than if it was ingested. What if one was to inhale the vapours of tentacula venom rather than ingest it? Would they still experience the same side effects?</p><p>She was itching to test out her hypothesis but she still had two classes for the day. Anxiously, she continued to check her watch for the time awaiting the time for her to run down to the dungeons and test out her new hypothesis. When the clock ticked over she dismissed her class, running up to her room to grab a batch of worms and headed down to Professor Snape\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cLyra,\u201d he acknowledged as she caught him moving between his classroom and his office.</p><p>\u201cSeverus,\u201d she grinned, \u201cI have an idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what might that be?\u201d he asked, his eyebrows raised in intrigue.</p><p>\u201cVapourisation,\u201d she said earning a curious look from the Potions Master. \u201cOf the tentacula venom. I mean we know it has a nasty side effect if you drink it but does it have the same effect if you inhale it\u2019s vapours? Also, would that still kill the worm. I mean we\u2019d have to test it out, I\u2019m not sure whether the toxins will evaporate with the liquid when boiled or whether the heat will just lead to denaturation but it can\u2019t hurt to try.\u201d She had spat out her ideas at a million miles per minute before dramatically saying, \u201cThis could be revolutionary.\u201d</p><p>Severus was amused by her enthusiasm and gestured towards his office. She lead them in and they quickly got to work. They boiled the tentacula venom then Lyra levitated a worm above the vapours and watched closely. She was nervous, watching it closely for any signs that it was working. After a few minutes the worm shrivelled and died.</p><p>She grinned to her partner, \u201cIt works. Now to test it out, would you do the honours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not suicidal enough to inhale pure tentacula venom fumes,\u201d he said, his eyes narrowed at the girl.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a healer, if anything goes wrong-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were a trainee healer, maybe we should dilute it a bit before trying to inhale it?\u201d</p><p>She laughed sheepishly, \u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>Over the next hour the two played with the concentration of the tentacula venom with just water, attempting to find low dose that would still kill the worm. Despite diluting it, the venom still remained rather potent in lower doses. They ended up settling for a 4:1 ratio of water to venom to trial.</p><p>\u201cDo I really have to be the one to test it out?\u201d she asked with apprehension.</p><p>\u201cWe could just borrow a student from the hallway,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cDo you really take joy in torturing students?\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head in a questioning manner which earned a small laugh from the witch.</p><p>\u201cIf I turn purple, I wish for you to kill me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI thought it was your favourite colour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is but I don\u2019t fancy my skin turning that colour,\u201d she replied, amusement heavy in her voice.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to keep stalling?\u201d</p><p>Lyra opened her mouth as though she was about to rebut though she held her tongue and smiled at the wizard. She took a deep breath to calm herself before placing her head over the cauldron and inhaling it. A moan escaped her lips and she screwed up her face holding her nose, stumbling back into her seat.</p><p>\u201cIt burns,\u201d she groaned tears beginning to leak from her eyes. \u201cFrom my nostrils to my head and now just my head. It feels like it\u2019s on fire.\u201d</p><p>The wizard rushed to her side and held her, stroking her back. \u201cJust breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy for you to say,\u201d she replied taking a few more deep breaths through her mouth as breathing through her nose seemed to irritate it further. \u201cAm I purple yet?\u201d</p><p>Severus chuckled, \u201cNot yet.\u201d He began to stroke the witch\u2019s head and she rested it on his stomach.</p><p>\u201cThank heavens,\u201d she said. A few minutes passed before the pain began to subside, \u201cI just feel like I have an awful headache now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not so bad,\u201d he replied. \u201cI think you should stay with me tonight so I can monitor any side effects, I wouldn\u2019t want you dying in your sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow sweet,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cYou call it sweet, I call it not wanting to face the fury of your Uncle.\u201d</p><p>Lyra pulled away from his touch at the mention of her Uncle, remembering their discussion. \u201cI can get Madam Pomfrey to monitor me,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019d hate to keep you up through the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be more comfortable if it was me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have classes in the morning,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep not knowing whether or not you were ok.\u201d</p><p>Her heart lodged itself into her throat and butterflies began to flutter in her stomach. She looked up at the concerned eyes of the Potions Master and nodded.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he said, \u201cLet\u2019s have dinner.\u201d</p><p>Severus extended a hand to her and she took it, her fingers slipping so easily into his almost like his hands were a perfect match for hers. She let go before they left the room, not needing rumours to follow the two as they walked to the staff room together but she wondered if he knew what effect his touch had on her. She had tried to be so careful and to keep her distance but quickly she found herself slipping into old habits, falling back in love with the man.</p><p>The two ate and engaged in conversation with their colleagues, discussing the progress of her experiment as well as gossiping about students. Professor Kettleburn dropped by and gave Lyra his research into the pathogen that caused Psyrot. Her fingers were crossed that their current hypothesis would be correct. They dwelled in the staffroom for a while, continuing to exchange some small talk before the two wandered off to her quarters.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to take your regular potion,\u201d he said as they entered the classroom, \u201cIt would ruin the results.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and paused for a moment to turning to address the Potions Master. \u201cSev, thank you for giving me the draught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needed it,\u201d his brow furrowed unsure as to why she was thanking him. \u201cYou should\u2019ve just asked. I told you, I would I always have it on hand for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I stopped needing it for a while and we weren\u2019t talking so I thought-\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyra,\u201d he said firmly, closing the gap between them. \u201cI still care about you, I don\u2019t think I could ever stop. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been helping you out, it\u2019s not just because you\u2019re my colleague but because I love you.\u201d</p><p>Confessions of love were supposed to be received with happiness but in all honesty, the expression just saddened her. She knew she loved him too but it all just seemed too complicated for a real relationship to be shared between them.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the girl who said she didn\u2019t care about blood purity?\u201d he asked, stroking her face.</p><p>She jerked away from his touch, her feelings of sadness quickly turning to anger. \u201cDon\u2019t mention something I said a month ago and try to twist it into me rejecting you. You\u2019re the one who said pursuing this would be unwise. You can\u2019t be so hot and cold and expect me to still be there waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>Severus gritted his teeth as Lyra\u2019s emotions began to unwind. He took the anger that was seething from her words. He wasn\u2019t sure of what else to do, his eyes looked down in shame knowing that he was responsible for her outburst.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how much you\u2019re fucking with me right now?\u201d she yelled, \u201cI\u2019ve been keeping my distance, trying to get over my feelings for you and now you\u2019re back here again, touching me, telling me you love me and getting me to feel all this shit for you. You got me to confess how I felt about you and then you tell me that you fucking love me, not once but twice, and make me think that maybe we could be good together but then you take that little bit of hope that I have for us and you squash it. You deny it and it fucking hurts.\u201d Tears began to spill from her eyes, \u201cI can\u2019t do this, Sev. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her and whispered, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d and that was enough for her. She allowed herself to continue crying into his arms, the sobs that wracked through her body moved him as well and he felt the pain that he had caused her. Over and over again he whispered \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d and that seemed to calm her along with his fingers that were caressing her back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair, Sev,\u201d she mumbled into his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not?\u201d he asked, pulling himself away slightly so she could peak her head out and speak.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just play with my emotions like that,\u201d she said, \u201cI care about you and I want to be with you and I\u2019m scared too but I\u2019m not leading you on.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his lips pressed against her head. \u201cI never intended to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted us to try,\u201d she muttered, \u201cI wanted to see if it would work, to see if it was real and then go from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to try,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cYou have to be honest,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nodded, \u201cYou can\u2019t walk away if it gets too hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk,\u201d he repeated, kissing the girl on the forehead. In his mind he whispered promises to himself that he would protect her and that this time he would succeed.</p><p>Lyra looked back up at the wizard who was affectionately kissing her and gave him a faint smile. She pulled him close to her, pushing herself up onto her tiptoes to close the gap between their lips. They kissed deeply for a moment before parting.</p><p>\u201cYou need to sleep,\u201d he said.</p><p>She hummed in response, \u201cShower first?\u201d She sucked in her bottom lip as she looked up at him, her eyes laced with desire.</p><p>\u201cI feel as though this is how you always con me into sleeping with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCon you?\u201d she asked playfully.</p><p>He hummed happily as his lips met her neck and began to nip her exposed flesh with his mouth. \u201cIt always seems to be the shower or the bath.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled a small laugh, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a con. This is merely the payback I said I would owe you for mentoring me in potions. Plus if you\u2019re going to stay up all night looking after me I think I should make it worth your while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, really.\u201d Her hands began to undress herself and she discarded her robes on the floor. Left in her underwear, she pulled away from the man and entered the ensuite attached to her bedroom. He followed behind, using his wand to quickly undress himself not having the patience to undo every single one of his buttons.</p><p>Lyra switched the shower on and turned to face him, her fingers unlatching her bra and allowing it to drop. Severus approached, now in only his briefs and began to unleash an onslaught of kisses on her lips, chin and neck. His hands made quick work of their remaining garments and he scooped up Lyra, wrapping her thighs around his waist and carrying her into the shower.</p><p>Lyra giggled as Severus mouth tickled her neck and the water soaked them both, dampening their hair. He pressed her body against the wall as leverage, one hand remaining firm on her thigh whilst the other appreciated her breasts. He groaned as his cock began to stir, \u201cFuck, I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>Her arms remained wrapped around his neck with one of her hands buried loosely in his hair. Severus\u2019 hand reached between them, wrapping around his cock. He shifted her weight up, positioning his member at her entrance before letting her slide down its length. She moaned loudly as he gripped her thighs, lustfully fucking her against the shower wall.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s eyes were squeezed tightly shut as his hips assaulted hers, drawing out sounds of pleasure with every thrust. Severus watched her, his eyes greedily taking in every aspect of her. The way her face was twisted in bliss and how her body looked with water droplets cascading down them. Passionately, his face approached hers and their lips met. Lyra moaned into the kiss, attempting to kiss back but her head would pull away as she audibly expressed her body\u2019s desires.</p><p>Severus\u2019 arms grew tired so he slid out of his lover and lowered her to the ground. Wordlessly, he guided her to turn around, her hands rested on the tiled wall and her back curved perfectly back so her ass was in the air ready for him to enter again. With ease, his member slid back into her pussy and he began to fuck her furiously. His hands were allowed to wander freely and they settled on her breasts, his fingers pulling at her nipples earn loud moans of approval.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s hand slid down between her legs and she began to rub the sensitive bundle of nerves that rested between them. The pleasure she felt from the combined stimulation of her nipples and cunt made her back arch further, pressing herself firmly against the wizard. Severus took this as an offer, one hand abandoned its post relenting on the nipple torture and instead appreciated the curve of her ass.</p><p>He groped it, enjoying the feel of her firm flesh then he slapped it, resulting in a moan of surprise. He felt the walls that surrounded his cock twitch in excitement. Smirking to himself he continued to spank her as he plunged in and out of her. He had an overwhelming desire to turn her skin red but he also wished to come.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s pussy continued to twitch as she neared her orgasm. It was beginning to bear down around him and the sounds that were spilling from her lips were intoxicating. He felt so close and knew she was too but was afraid that he would come before she did. \u201cLyra, I\u2019m not going to last. Sweet Circe, your cunt is so tight.\u201d</p><p>Those words drove Lyra right over the edge, a strained moan escaped her as she came hard. A few more thrusts and Severus joined her in the throws of orgasm, filling her with his seed. He slid out and pulled her body close to his to support her in the unsteadiness of her orgasm afterglow.</p><p>Her head nuzzled into his chest allowing the water of the shower to soak her hair and clean her body. She pulled away and kissed him before reaching for her bottle of shampoo. She lathered his hair, styling it into a mohawk she giggled at her creation before beginning to wash her own hair.</p><p>\u201cAm I allowed to rinse this off?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I think the mohawk suits you,\u201d she replied, \u201cIt\u2019s very muggle punk.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes before dipping his head under the water. Next Lyra reached for the bar of soap. Severus allowed her hands to roam his body, covering him in suds before rinsing them away. He returned the favour, taking particular care in soaping her more intimate areas. His finger lingered on the puckered star between her cheeks and he leaned in to whisper, \u201cI can\u2019t wait until I get to fuck this hole too.\u201d</p><p>She felt heat grow in the pit of her stomach at the suggestion of his words. The sweet baritone of his voice saying something so vulgar seemed to accentuate her reaction, her face flushed and her eyes cast downwards afraid to meet his.</p><p>\u201cHorny again already?\u201d he asked, \u201cSurely this isn\u2019t a side effect of your treatment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a side effect of your words,\u201d she quipped. \u201cI think you\u2019re ruining the results of my experiment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stop then,\u201d he suggested withdrawing his touch and earning a glare from the witch. \u201cHow is your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she shrugged.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you to bed,\u201d he said as he stepped out of the shower.</p><p>Severus reached for his wand and with a few waves he switched the shower off and non-verbally dried their bodies. Lyra slipped into her pyjamas whilst Severus redressed into his robes, claiming that if he got comfortable he would want to sleep too.</p><p>\u201cCould you lay with me until I fall asleep?\u201d she asked as she slid into bed.</p><p>He nodded, \u201cDo you have anything I could read?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few healing books here and there,\u201d she said, \u201cMake yourself at home. You can read my report too and let me know if it sounds alright.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were heavy and she began to slip into sleep before he even joined her. She did fight it briefly, wanting to enjoy his company. She felt his weight shift the bed slightly and she mumbled, \u201cSev, you know I love you too, yeah?\u201d</p><p>He stroked her hair, brushing it out of her face. \u201cNo, but I\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Severus Snape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSide effect of the inhalation of Venomous Tentacula juice includes horniness and confessions of love.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, \u201cI\u2019m serious, Sev.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Lyra Lestrange.\u201d</p>",

She obliged and enjoyed the company of her family before returning to Hogwarts. This time around, Draco did not cry. He hugged his cousin and waved goodbye, promising to continue writing letters to her. Her Aunt and Uncle both embraced her as well, reminding her that she was always welcome in their home.</p><p>Lyra took the familiar path back to Hogwarts via Hogsmeade and headed straight down towards the Dungeons. Breakfast had taken more time than she expected so she was quick on her feet, hoping to not be late. She managed to knock on the door precisely as her watch hit 10am. Just as promptly, Severus opened the door of his office and welcomed her in.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the test subjects?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cHow\u2019d you research go?\u201d</p><p>She raised the book in response, \u201cI had to go back to the Manor for this but it\u2019s all here.\u201d She flicked open the book into the relevant page and handed it Severus.</p><p>He read it quickly and looked up at her, \u201cI trust you know your latin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she replied, \u201cUncle made me take several languages over my schooling years. I did Russian and French whilst at Durmstrang then Latin and Ancient Greek.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed, \u201cNo wonder you were so much trouble.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows playfully with a smirk. \u201cIt does help with spell creation which I dabbled in when I was young but I found it extremely helpful for human anatomy.\u201d She smiled sweetly, \u201cShall we get to experimenting.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and revealed the rats that would be the subjects of the experiment. After checking that they were in relatively good health the two quickly brewed the potion that held the lowest concentration of bloodroot. Lyra finished the potion as instructed casting \u201c <i>Ire dura mater cerebri</i> ,\u201d and waving her wand in a circular motion thrice clockwise and once counterclockwise. The potion sparked, indicating the success of the incantation.</p><p>Lyra took hold of one of the feral rats whilst Severus levitated a vial into the cauldron to fill it before emptying it into the mouth of the rat. This process was repeated with 3 other rats which were put in separate cages. Now they had to wait and observe.</p><p>\u201cHow long do you think it\u2019ll take to see a reaction?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDepends,\u201d he shrugged. \u201cIt could be hours to days. I\u2019m still a bit uncertain about the concentration of bloodroot. It\u2019s still rather high, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019ll be safe for human consumption. Should\u2019ve taken me up on the student offer.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled slightly at his joke, \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to wait and see. I\u2019ll take these back to my rooms and I\u2019ll let you know how it goes.\u201d She levitated the cages out the door in front of her and paused for a moment, turning to look at the Potions Master. \u201cThank you, Severus. I really appreciate your help.\u201d</p><p>He nodded curtly and Lyra turned, leaving the office with the rats in tow. It earned a few peculiar looks from students but she simply ignored them, her eyes were more focused on the progress of the rats. They seemed fine but Lyra wanted to make sure that they would stay that way and for some reason she believed that if she watched them nothing bad would happen. There were a few times where Lyra would stumble on the staircase as she moved up it as her focus was on the behaviour of the rats.</p><p>She settled into the comfort of her office, the rats in view of her desk whilst she worked on lesson plans. After about an hour she noticed that the rats were getting rather sick, one had begun to vomit another had diarrhoea. She scratched her head in frustration as all she could do was sit back and observe them, ensuring that they had water and food.</p><p>The first one died at 4pm. It had first fallen asleep but after checking Lyra noticed that it was in a coma, its organs had begun to shut down. She noticed in another its eyes began to look like glass. They were all showing symptoms of toxicity. It was only a matter of hours before they were all dead.</p><p>She dissected them all, one by one, to confirm what had killed them. She sighed as she realised Severus was right, the concentration of bloodroot was too high to be metabolised by rats resulting in low blood pressure, tissue necrosis and eventual death. Audibly, she groaned as she felt like she was so close to the solution yet it just seemed to slip through her hands.</p><p>Lyra attempted to rationalise the results, thinking maybe if they reduced the amount of bloodroot used it may not kill them. Maybe they died because they were rats, she may just have to take the solution herself but she knew it was inadvisable. She debated internally as she went to the staff room to have something to eat. Relief overtook her as she saw Severus sitting there eating and she began to splurge the details on their experiment and work through her thoughts.</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cI told you the concentration of bloodroot is too high for consumption.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if we try the other spell?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He tilted his head slightly, \u201cIt\u2019s worth a try but as soon as those worms die the potion will be absorbed by the host and you\u2019ll face the same problem.\u201d</p><p>She groaned, \u201cThe other option is the Tentacula Venom. At least we know it won\u2019t kill humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be able to test it on a rat though,\u201d he said, \u201cIt\u2019s rather lethal to other animals.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her face in frustration.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d he said. His fingers twitched on the table as though he wanted to reach out and comfort the witch. He wasn\u2019t sure how she\u2019d feel about the affection so he kept to himself. \u201cIf you don\u2019t figure it out someone else will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s encouraging,\u201d she said, pursing her lips.</p><p>His eyebrows raised in a questioning manner, \u201cWhy are you so determined to discover a cure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a puzzle I want to solve. I\u2019ve invested a lot of time into this and I want to be the one to discover the cure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should write about your findings and publish that,\u201d he suggested. \u201cMaybe someone will be able to discover a cure based off of that and it\u2019ll be something to focus on while you still work on it. You never know it might allow you to see it from a different light.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, her head resting in her hands in a dramatic demonstration of her exhaustion. \u201cI guess,\u201d she frowned, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I feel so close to the answer and it\u2019s frustrating.\u201d</p><p>His lips pursed in an expression of sympathy and threw caution to the wind. His hand reached out to hold her free one and held it. He looked into her eyes and encouraged her. \u201cKeep working on it. I\u2019ll be here if you need me.\u201d</p><p>A half smile formed on her lips and she nodded, \u201cThanks, Sev.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her hand before taking his leave. Her eyes lingered where his hand once was and she felt an overwhelming amount of sadness as she was reminded of the relationship she couldn\u2019t pursue. She reminded herself that she should be thankful that at least he was still there as a colleague and a friend but her heart desired more.</p><p>Lyra lingered in the staff room for a few moments, interacting with a few of her peers before resigning to her quarters. She wondered how she was going to get to sleep that night with the thoughts of disappointment from her failed experiment as well as the intense feelings that remained with Severus. She remembered the potion that he had brewed for her and took it but if anything his thoughtfulness made her want him more but those thoughts were soon put to rest when she fell asleep.</p><p>When Lyra woke up the next day there was a moment where she was ok, where she felt at peace and everything was alright in the world but a few minutes passed and her reality came crashing into her. It was like a tidal wave of feelings that engulfed her and spilled from her eyes. Up until then she had been managing to keep her feelings in check but as her research had fell through she felt the walls that she built up crumble down too. She allowed herself to cry and mourn, she acknowledged her feelings and wished to spend all day in bed to weep over her failed experiment and relationship but with a deep breath the crying stopped. Lyra picked herself up and wiped away the tears that stained her cheeks before dressing herself to face the day.</p><p>Classes were uneventful that week, Lyra spent her breaks seclusion where she was working on either class work or her report on her findings. It took a few days until she could gather the nerve to face any of her colleagues again, afraid that they would ask and she\u2019d have nothing to show for it. The dreaded moment occurred during lunch that Thursday.</p><p>\u201cLyra,\u201d the Muggle Studies Professor approached her with her lunch in hand, \u201cHow\u2019ve you been? I haven\u2019t seen you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusy,\u201d Lyra replied. She attempted to flip the question but Charity \u00a0got in before her.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your work on the cure going?\u201d</p><p>Lyra gritted her teeth and forced a smile, \u201cWell.\u201d</p><p>Charity nodded slowly in response and an idea popped into Lyra\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Charity,\u201d the younger Professor urged, \u201cWhat do muggles use to cure disease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean medicine?\u201d the witch\u2019s eyes lit up as she began to ramble. \u201cThey\u2019re really quite bright, they make pills and all sorts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do they administer them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, like us they have medicine you can drink and apply topically,\u201d she explained, \u201cThey have eye drops and ear drops. They also use injections which is where they use a needle to pierce the skin and insert the drug into the muscle, bloodstream sometimes even the spine! Otherwise there are inhalants, some drugs are inserted rectally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, through the rectum,\u201d Charity continued, \u201cThey have patches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo before the rectum,\u201d Lyra said, \u201cInhalants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s common for sedatives for operations. They inhale it through a pump, tube or mask.\u201d</p><p>Lyra\u2019s brain was ticking over, it was so obvious. Why didn\u2019t she think of it earlier? If the drug was inhaled it could travel quicker into the bloodstream than if it was ingested. What if one was to inhale the vapours of tentacula venom rather than ingest it? Would they still experience the same side effects?</p><p>She was itching to test out her hypothesis but she still had two classes for the day. Anxiously, she continued to check her watch for the time awaiting the time for her to run down to the dungeons and test out her new hypothesis. When the clock ticked over she dismissed her class, running up to her room to grab a batch of worms and headed down to Professor Snape\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cLyra,\u201d he acknowledged as she caught him moving between his classroom and his office.</p><p>\u201cSeverus,\u201d she grinned, \u201cI have an idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what might that be?\u201d he asked, his eyebrows raised in intrigue.</p><p>\u201cVapourisation,\u201d she said earning a curious look from the Potions Master. \u201cOf the tentacula venom. I mean we know it has a nasty side effect if you drink it but does it have the same effect if you inhale it\u2019s vapours? Also, would that still kill the worm. I mean we\u2019d have to test it out, I\u2019m not sure whether the toxins will evaporate with the liquid when boiled or whether the heat will just lead to denaturation but it can\u2019t hurt to try.\u201d She had spat out her ideas at a million miles per minute before dramatically saying, \u201cThis could be revolutionary.\u201d</p><p>Severus was amused by her enthusiasm and gestured towards his office. She lead them in and they quickly got to work. They boiled the tentacula venom then Lyra levitated a worm above the vapours and watched closely. She was nervous, watching it closely for any signs that it was working. After a few minutes the worm shrivelled and died.</p><p>She grinned to her partner, \u201cIt works. Now to test it out, would you do the honours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not suicidal enough to inhale pure tentacula venom fumes,\u201d he said, his eyes narrowed at the girl.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a healer, if anything goes wrong-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were a trainee healer, maybe we should dilute it a bit before trying to inhale it?\u201d</p><p>She laughed sheepishly, \u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>Over the next hour the two played with the concentration of the tentacula venom with just water, attempting to find low dose that would still kill the worm. Despite diluting it, the venom still remained rather potent in lower doses. They ended up settling for a 4:1 ratio of water to venom to trial.</p><p>\u201cDo I really have to be the one to test it out?\u201d she asked with apprehension.</p><p>\u201cWe could just borrow a student from the hallway,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cDo you really take joy in torturing students?\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head in a questioning manner which earned a small laugh from the witch.</p><p>\u201cIf I turn purple, I wish for you to kill me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI thought it was your favourite colour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is but I don\u2019t fancy my skin turning that colour,\u201d she replied, amusement heavy in her voice.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to keep stalling?\u201d</p><p>Lyra opened her mouth as though she was about to rebut though she held her tongue and smiled at the wizard. She took a deep breath to calm herself before placing her head over the cauldron and inhaling it. A moan escaped her lips and she screwed up her face holding her nose, stumbling back into her seat.</p><p>\u201cIt burns,\u201d she groaned tears beginning to leak from her eyes. \u201cFrom my nostrils to my head and now just my head. It feels like it\u2019s on fire.\u201d</p><p>The wizard rushed to her side and held her, stroking her back. \u201cJust breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy for you to say,\u201d she replied taking a few more deep breaths through her mouth as breathing through her nose seemed to irritate it further. \u201cAm I purple yet?\u201d</p><p>Severus chuckled, \u201cNot yet.\u201d He began to stroke the witch\u2019s head and she rested it on his stomach.</p><p>\u201cThank heavens,\u201d she said. A few minutes passed before the pain began to subside, \u201cI just feel like I have an awful headache now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not so bad,\u201d he replied. \u201cI think you should stay with me tonight so I can monitor any side effects, I wouldn\u2019t want you dying in your sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow sweet,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cYou call it sweet, I call it not wanting to face the fury of your Uncle.\u201d</p><p>Lyra pulled away from his touch at the mention of her Uncle, remembering their discussion. \u201cI can get Madam Pomfrey to monitor me,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019d hate to keep you up through the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be more comfortable if it was me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have classes in the morning,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep not knowing whether or not you were ok.\u201d</p><p>Her heart lodged itself into her throat and butterflies began to flutter in her stomach. She looked up at the concerned eyes of the Potions Master and nodded.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he said, \u201cLet\u2019s have dinner.\u201d</p><p>Severus extended a hand to her and she took it, her fingers slipping so easily into his almost like his hands were a perfect match for hers. She let go before they left the room, not needing rumours to follow the two as they walked to the staff room together but she wondered if he knew what effect his touch had on her. She had tried to be so careful and to keep her distance but quickly she found herself slipping into old habits, falling back in love with the man.</p><p>The two ate and engaged in conversation with their colleagues, discussing the progress of her experiment as well as gossiping about students. Professor Kettleburn dropped by and gave Lyra his research into the pathogen that caused Psyrot. Her fingers were crossed that their current hypothesis would be correct. They dwelled in the staffroom for a while, continuing to exchange some small talk before the two wandered off to her quarters.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to take your regular potion,\u201d he said as they entered the classroom, \u201cIt would ruin the results.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and paused for a moment to turning to address the Potions Master. \u201cSev, thank you for giving me the draught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needed it,\u201d his brow furrowed unsure as to why she was thanking him. \u201cYou should\u2019ve just asked. I told you, I would I always have it on hand for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I stopped needing it for a while and we weren\u2019t talking so I thought-\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyra,\u201d he said firmly, closing the gap between them. \u201cI still care about you, I don\u2019t think I could ever stop. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been helping you out, it\u2019s not just because you\u2019re my colleague but because I love you.\u201d</p><p>Confessions of love were supposed to be received with happiness but in all honesty, the expression just saddened her. She knew she loved him too but it all just seemed too complicated for a real relationship to be shared between them.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the girl who said she didn\u2019t care about blood purity?\u201d he asked, stroking her face.</p><p>She jerked away from his touch, her feelings of sadness quickly turning to anger. \u201cDon\u2019t mention something I said a month ago and try to twist it into me rejecting you. You\u2019re the one who said pursuing this would be unwise. You can\u2019t be so hot and cold and expect me to still be there waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>Severus gritted his teeth as Lyra\u2019s emotions began to unwind. He took the anger that was seething from her words. He wasn\u2019t sure of what else to do, his eyes looked down in shame knowing that he was responsible for her outburst.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how much you\u2019re fucking with me right now?\u201d she yelled, \u201cI\u2019ve been keeping my distance, trying to get over my feelings for you and now you\u2019re back here again, touching me, telling me you love me and getting me to feel all this shit for you. You got me to confess how I felt about you and then you tell me that you fucking love me, not once but twice, and make me think that maybe we could be good together but then you take that little bit of hope that I have for us and you squash it. You deny it and it fucking hurts.\u201d Tears began to spill from her eyes, \u201cI can\u2019t do this, Sev. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her and whispered, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d and that was enough for her. She allowed herself to continue crying into his arms, the sobs that wracked through her body moved him as well and he felt the pain that he had caused her. Over and over again he whispered \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d and that seemed to calm her along with his fingers that were caressing her back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair, Sev,\u201d she mumbled into his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not?\u201d he asked, pulling himself away slightly so she could peak her head out and speak.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just play with my emotions like that,\u201d she said, \u201cI care about you and I want to be with you and I\u2019m scared too but I\u2019m not leading you on.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his lips pressed against her head. \u201cI never intended to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted us to try,\u201d she muttered, \u201cI wanted to see if it would work, to see if it was real and then go from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to try,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cYou have to be honest,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nodded, \u201cYou can\u2019t walk away if it gets too hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk,\u201d he repeated, kissing the girl on the forehead. In his mind he whispered promises to himself that he would protect her and that this time he would succeed.</p><p>Lyra looked back up at the wizard who was affectionately kissing her and gave him a faint smile. She pulled him close to her, pushing herself up onto her tiptoes to close the gap between their lips. They kissed deeply for a moment before parting.</p><p>\u201cYou need to sleep,\u201d he said.</p><p>She hummed in response, \u201cShower first?\u201d She sucked in her bottom lip as she looked up at him, her eyes laced with desire.</p><p>\u201cI feel as though this is how you always con me into sleeping with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCon you?\u201d she asked playfully.</p><p>He hummed happily as his lips met her neck and began to nip her exposed flesh with his mouth. \u201cIt always seems to be the shower or the bath.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled a small laugh, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a con. This is merely the payback I said I would owe you for mentoring me in potions. Plus if you\u2019re going to stay up all night looking after me I think I should make it worth your while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, really.\u201d Her hands began to undress herself and she discarded her robes on the floor. Left in her underwear, she pulled away from the man and entered the ensuite attached to her bedroom. He followed behind, using his wand to quickly undress himself not having the patience to undo every single one of his buttons.</p><p>Lyra switched the shower on and turned to face him, her fingers unlatching her bra and allowing it to drop. Severus approached, now in only his briefs and began to unleash an onslaught of kisses on her lips, chin and neck. His hands made quick work of their remaining garments and he scooped up Lyra, wrapping her thighs around his waist and carrying her into the shower.</p><p>Lyra giggled as Severus mouth tickled her neck and the water soaked them both, dampening their hair. He pressed her body against the wall as leverage, one hand remaining firm on her thigh whilst the other appreciated her breasts. He groaned as his cock began to stir, \u201cFuck, I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>Her arms remained wrapped around his neck with one of her hands buried loosely in his hair. Severus\u2019 hand reached between them, wrapping around his cock. He shifted her weight up, positioning his member at her entrance before letting her slide down its length. She moaned loudly as he gripped her thighs, lustfully fucking her against the shower wall.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s eyes were squeezed tightly shut as his hips assaulted hers, drawing out sounds of pleasure with every thrust. Severus watched her, his eyes greedily taking in every aspect of her. The way her face was twisted in bliss and how her body looked with water droplets cascading down them. Passionately, his face approached hers and their lips met. Lyra moaned into the kiss, attempting to kiss back but her head would pull away as she audibly expressed her body\u2019s desires.</p><p>Severus\u2019 arms grew tired so he slid out of his lover and lowered her to the ground. Wordlessly, he guided her to turn around, her hands rested on the tiled wall and her back curved perfectly back so her ass was in the air ready for him to enter again. With ease, his member slid back into her pussy and he began to fuck her furiously. His hands were allowed to wander freely and they settled on her breasts, his fingers pulling at her nipples earn loud moans of approval.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s hand slid down between her legs and she began to rub the sensitive bundle of nerves that rested between them. The pleasure she felt from the combined stimulation of her nipples and cunt made her back arch further, pressing herself firmly against the wizard. Severus took this as an offer, one hand abandoned its post relenting on the nipple torture and instead appreciated the curve of her ass.</p><p>He groped it, enjoying the feel of her firm flesh then he slapped it, resulting in a moan of surprise. He felt the walls that surrounded his cock twitch in excitement. Smirking to himself he continued to spank her as he plunged in and out of her. He had an overwhelming desire to turn her skin red but he also wished to come.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s pussy continued to twitch as she neared her orgasm. It was beginning to bear down around him and the sounds that were spilling from her lips were intoxicating. He felt so close and knew she was too but was afraid that he would come before she did. \u201cLyra, I\u2019m not going to last. Sweet Circe, your cunt is so tight.\u201d</p><p>Those words drove Lyra right over the edge, a strained moan escaped her as she came hard. A few more thrusts and Severus joined her in the throws of orgasm, filling her with his seed. He slid out and pulled her body close to his to support her in the unsteadiness of her orgasm afterglow.</p><p>Her head nuzzled into his chest allowing the water of the shower to soak her hair and clean her body. She pulled away and kissed him before reaching for her bottle of shampoo. She lathered his hair, styling it into a mohawk she giggled at her creation before beginning to wash her own hair.</p><p>\u201cAm I allowed to rinse this off?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I think the mohawk suits you,\u201d she replied, \u201cIt\u2019s very muggle punk.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes before dipping his head under the water. Next Lyra reached for the bar of soap. Severus allowed her hands to roam his body, covering him in suds before rinsing them away. He returned the favour, taking particular care in soaping her more intimate areas. His finger lingered on the puckered star between her cheeks and he leaned in to whisper, \u201cI can\u2019t wait until I get to fuck this hole too.\u201d</p><p>She felt heat grow in the pit of her stomach at the suggestion of his words. The sweet baritone of his voice saying something so vulgar seemed to accentuate her reaction, her face flushed and her eyes cast downwards afraid to meet his.</p><p>\u201cHorny again already?\u201d he asked, \u201cSurely this isn\u2019t a side effect of your treatment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a side effect of your words,\u201d she quipped. \u201cI think you\u2019re ruining the results of my experiment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stop then,\u201d he suggested withdrawing his touch and earning a glare from the witch. \u201cHow is your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she shrugged.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you to bed,\u201d he said as he stepped out of the shower.</p><p>Severus reached for his wand and with a few waves he switched the shower off and non-verbally dried their bodies. Lyra slipped into her pyjamas whilst Severus redressed into his robes, claiming that if he got comfortable he would want to sleep too.</p><p>\u201cCould you lay with me until I fall asleep?\u201d she asked as she slid into bed.</p><p>He nodded, \u201cDo you have anything I could read?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few healing books here and there,\u201d she said, \u201cMake yourself at home. You can read my report too and let me know if it sounds alright.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were heavy and she began to slip into sleep before he even joined her. She did fight it briefly, wanting to enjoy his company. She felt his weight shift the bed slightly and she mumbled, \u201cSev, you know I love you too, yeah?\u201d</p><p>He stroked her hair, brushing it out of her face. \u201cNo, but I\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Severus Snape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSide effect of the inhalation of Venomous Tentacula juice includes horniness and confessions of love.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, \u201cI\u2019m serious, Sev.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Lyra Lestrange.\u201d</p>",
                "content": "<p><i>Summary:&nbsp;The daughter of Bellatrix and Rodolphus Lestrange is a Healer who finds herself not only haunted by her past but also questioning her choice in career. When Lyra Lestrange&rsquo;s old headmaster offers her a position as Defence Against the Dark Arts Teacher she finds herself thrown into an adventure involving a secret affair with a colleague, discovering the cure for a disease and dealing with students cursing themselves.

She obliged and enjoyed the company of her family before returning to Hogwarts. This time around, Draco did not cry. He hugged his cousin and waved goodbye, promising to continue writing letters to her. Her Aunt and Uncle both embraced her as well, reminding her that she was always welcome in their home.</p><p>Lyra took the familiar path back to Hogwarts via Hogsmeade and headed straight down towards the Dungeons. Breakfast had taken more time than she expected so she was quick on her feet, hoping to not be late. She managed to knock on the door precisely as her watch hit 10am. Just as promptly, Severus opened the door of his office and welcomed her in.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the test subjects?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you research go?&rdquo;</p><p>She raised the book in response, &ldquo;I had to go back to the Manor for this but it&rsquo;s all here.&rdquo; She flicked open the book into the relevant page and handed it Severus.</p><p>He read it quickly and looked up at her, &ldquo;I trust you know your latin?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;Uncle made me take several languages over my schooling years. I did Russian and French whilst at Durmstrang then Latin and Ancient Greek.&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes narrowed, &ldquo;No wonder you were so much trouble.&rdquo;</p><p>She raised her eyebrows playfully with a smirk. &ldquo;It does help with spell creation which I dabbled in when I was young but I found it extremely helpful for human anatomy.&rdquo; She smiled sweetly, &ldquo;Shall we get to experimenting.&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded and revealed the rats that would be the subjects of the experiment. After checking that they were in relatively good health the two quickly brewed the potion that held the lowest concentration of bloodroot. Lyra finished the potion as instructed casting &ldquo; <i>Ire dura mater cerebri</i> ,&rdquo; and waving her wand in a circular motion thrice clockwise and once counterclockwise. The potion sparked, indicating the success of the incantation.</p><p>Lyra took hold of one of the feral rats whilst Severus levitated a vial into the cauldron to fill it before emptying it into the mouth of the rat. This process was repeated with 3 other rats which were put in separate cages. Now they had to wait and observe.</p><p>&ldquo;How long do you think it&rsquo;ll take to see a reaction?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Depends,&rdquo; he shrugged. &ldquo;It could be hours to days. I&rsquo;m still a bit uncertain about the concentration of bloodroot. It&rsquo;s still rather high, I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;ll be safe for human consumption. Should&rsquo;ve taken me up on the student offer.&rdquo;</p><p>She chuckled slightly at his joke, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just have to wait and see. I&rsquo;ll take these back to my rooms and I&rsquo;ll let you know how it goes.&rdquo; She levitated the cages out the door in front of her and paused for a moment, turning to look at the Potions Master. &ldquo;Thank you, Severus. I really appreciate your help.&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded curtly and Lyra turned, leaving the office with the rats in tow. It earned a few peculiar looks from students but she simply ignored them, her eyes were more focused on the progress of the rats. They seemed fine but Lyra wanted to make sure that they would stay that way and for some reason she believed that if she watched them nothing bad would happen. There were a few times where Lyra would stumble on the staircase as she moved up it as her focus was on the behaviour of the rats.</p><p>She settled into the comfort of her office, the rats in view of her desk whilst she worked on lesson plans. After about an hour she noticed that the rats were getting rather sick, one had begun to vomit another had diarrhoea. She scratched her head in frustration as all she could do was sit back and observe them, ensuring that they had water and food.</p><p>The first one died at 4pm. It had first fallen asleep but after checking Lyra noticed that it was in a coma, its organs had begun to shut down. She noticed in another its eyes began to look like glass. They were all showing symptoms of toxicity. It was only a matter of hours before they were all dead.</p><p>She dissected them all, one by one, to confirm what had killed them. She sighed as she realised Severus was right, the concentration of bloodroot was too high to be metabolised by rats resulting in low blood pressure, tissue necrosis and eventual death. Audibly, she groaned as she felt like she was so close to the solution yet it just seemed to slip through her hands.</p><p>Lyra attempted to rationalise the results, thinking maybe if they reduced the amount of bloodroot used it may not kill them. Maybe they died because they were rats, she may just have to take the solution herself but she knew it was inadvisable. She debated internally as she went to the staff room to have something to eat. Relief overtook her as she saw Severus sitting there eating and she began to splurge the details on their experiment and work through her thoughts.</p><p>He shook his head, &ldquo;I told you the concentration of bloodroot is too high for consumption.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What if we try the other spell?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>He tilted his head slightly, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth a try but as soon as those worms die the potion will be absorbed by the host and you&rsquo;ll face the same problem.&rdquo;</p><p>She groaned, &ldquo;The other option is the Tentacula Venom. At least we know it won&rsquo;t kill humans.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t be able to test it on a rat though,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather lethal to other animals.&rdquo;</p><p>She rubbed her face in frustration.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll figure it out,&rdquo; he said. His fingers twitched on the table as though he wanted to reach out and comfort the witch. He wasn&rsquo;t sure how she&rsquo;d feel about the affection so he kept to himself. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t figure it out someone else will.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s encouraging,&rdquo; she said, pursing her lips.</p><p>His eyebrows raised in a questioning manner, &ldquo;Why are you so determined to discover a cure?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a puzzle I want to solve. I&rsquo;ve invested a lot of time into this and I want to be the one to discover the cure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe you should write about your findings and publish that,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;Maybe someone will be able to discover a cure based off of that and it&rsquo;ll be something to focus on while you still work on it. You never know it might allow you to see it from a different light.&rdquo;</p><p>She sighed, her head resting in her hands in a dramatic demonstration of her exhaustion. &ldquo;I guess,&rdquo; she frowned, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I feel so close to the answer and it&rsquo;s frustrating.&rdquo;</p><p>His lips pursed in an expression of sympathy and threw caution to the wind. His hand reached out to hold her free one and held it. He looked into her eyes and encouraged her. &ldquo;Keep working on it. I&rsquo;ll be here if you need me.&rdquo;</p><p>A half smile formed on her lips and she nodded, &ldquo;Thanks, Sev.&rdquo;</p><p>He squeezed her hand before taking his leave. Her eyes lingered where his hand once was and she felt an overwhelming amount of sadness as she was reminded of the relationship she couldn&rsquo;t pursue. She reminded herself that she should be thankful that at least he was still there as a colleague and a friend but her heart desired more.</p><p>Lyra lingered in the staff room for a few moments, interacting with a few of her peers before resigning to her quarters. She wondered how she was going to get to sleep that night with the thoughts of disappointment from her failed experiment as well as the intense feelings that remained with Severus. She remembered the potion that he had brewed for her and took it but if anything his thoughtfulness made her want him more but those thoughts were soon put to rest when she fell asleep.</p><p>When Lyra woke up the next day there was a moment where she was ok, where she felt at peace and everything was alright in the world but a few minutes passed and her reality came crashing into her. It was like a tidal wave of feelings that engulfed her and spilled from her eyes. Up until then she had been managing to keep her feelings in check but as her research had fell through she felt the walls that she built up crumble down too. She allowed herself to cry and mourn, she acknowledged her feelings and wished to spend all day in bed to weep over her failed experiment and relationship but with a deep breath the crying stopped. Lyra picked herself up and wiped away the tears that stained her cheeks before dressing herself to face the day.</p><p>Classes were uneventful that week, Lyra spent her breaks seclusion where she was working on either class work or her report on her findings. It took a few days until she could gather the nerve to face any of her colleagues again, afraid that they would ask and she&rsquo;d have nothing to show for it. The dreaded moment occurred during lunch that Thursday.</p><p>&ldquo;Lyra,&rdquo; the Muggle Studies Professor approached her with her lunch in hand, &ldquo;How&rsquo;ve you been? I haven&rsquo;t seen you around.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Busy,&rdquo; Lyra replied. She attempted to flip the question but Charity &nbsp;got in before her.</p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s your work on the cure going?&rdquo;</p><p>Lyra gritted her teeth and forced a smile, &ldquo;Well.&rdquo;</p><p>Charity nodded slowly in response and an idea popped into Lyra&rsquo;s head.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me, Charity,&rdquo; the younger Professor urged, &ldquo;What do muggles use to cure disease?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You mean medicine?&rdquo; the witch&rsquo;s eyes lit up as she began to ramble. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re really quite bright, they make pills and all sorts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do they administer them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, like us they have medicine you can drink and apply topically,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;They have eye drops and ear drops. They also use injections which is where they use a needle to pierce the skin and insert the drug into the muscle, bloodstream sometimes even the spine! Otherwise there are inhalants, some drugs are inserted rectally.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, through the rectum,&rdquo; Charity continued, &ldquo;They have patches.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No before the rectum,&rdquo; Lyra said, &ldquo;Inhalants?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s common for sedatives for operations. They inhale it through a pump, tube or mask.&rdquo;</p><p>Lyra&rsquo;s brain was ticking over, it was so obvious. Why didn&rsquo;t she think of it earlier? If the drug was inhaled it could travel quicker into the bloodstream than if it was ingested. What if one was to inhale the vapours of tentacula venom rather than ingest it? Would they still experience the same side effects?</p><p>She was itching to test out her hypothesis but she still had two classes for the day. Anxiously, she continued to check her watch for the time awaiting the time for her to run down to the dungeons and test out her new hypothesis. When the clock ticked over she dismissed her class, running up to her room to grab a batch of worms and headed down to Professor Snape&rsquo;s office.</p><p>&ldquo;Lyra,&rdquo; he acknowledged as she caught him moving between his classroom and his office.</p><p>&ldquo;Severus,&rdquo; she grinned, &ldquo;I have an idea.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what might that be?&rdquo; he asked, his eyebrows raised in intrigue.</p><p>&ldquo;Vapourisation,&rdquo; she said earning a curious look from the Potions Master. &ldquo;Of the tentacula venom. I mean we know it has a nasty side effect if you drink it but does it have the same effect if you inhale it&rsquo;s vapours? Also, would that still kill the worm. I mean we&rsquo;d have to test it out, I&rsquo;m not sure whether the toxins will evaporate with the liquid when boiled or whether the heat will just lead to denaturation but it can&rsquo;t hurt to try.&rdquo; She had spat out her ideas at a million miles per minute before dramatically saying, &ldquo;This could be revolutionary.&rdquo;</p><p>Severus was amused by her enthusiasm and gestured towards his office. She lead them in and they quickly got to work. They boiled the tentacula venom then Lyra levitated a worm above the vapours and watched closely. She was nervous, watching it closely for any signs that it was working. After a few minutes the worm shrivelled and died.</p><p>She grinned to her partner, &ldquo;It works. Now to test it out, would you do the honours?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not suicidal enough to inhale pure tentacula venom fumes,&rdquo; he said, his eyes narrowed at the girl.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a healer, if anything goes wrong-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You were a trainee healer, maybe we should dilute it a bit before trying to inhale it?&rdquo;</p><p>She laughed sheepishly, &ldquo;Good point.&rdquo;</p><p>Over the next hour the two played with the concentration of the tentacula venom with just water, attempting to find low dose that would still kill the worm. Despite diluting it, the venom still remained rather potent in lower doses. They ended up settling for a 4:1 ratio of water to venom to trial.</p><p>&ldquo;Do I really have to be the one to test it out?&rdquo; she asked with apprehension.</p><p>&ldquo;We could just borrow a student from the hallway,&rdquo; he suggested.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you really take joy in torturing students?&rdquo;</p><p>He tilted his head in a questioning manner which earned a small laugh from the witch.</p><p>&ldquo;If I turn purple, I wish for you to kill me,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought it was your favourite colour.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is but I don&rsquo;t fancy my skin turning that colour,&rdquo; she replied, amusement heavy in her voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you going to keep stalling?&rdquo;</p><p>Lyra opened her mouth as though she was about to rebut though she held her tongue and smiled at the wizard. She took a deep breath to calm herself before placing her head over the cauldron and inhaling it. A moan escaped her lips and she screwed up her face holding her nose, stumbling back into her seat.</p><p>&ldquo;It burns,&rdquo; she groaned tears beginning to leak from her eyes. &ldquo;From my nostrils to my head and now just my head. It feels like it&rsquo;s on fire.&rdquo;</p><p>The wizard rushed to her side and held her, stroking her back. &ldquo;Just breathe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Easy for you to say,&rdquo; she replied taking a few more deep breaths through her mouth as breathing through her nose seemed to irritate it further. &ldquo;Am I purple yet?&rdquo;</p><p>Severus chuckled, &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo; He began to stroke the witch&rsquo;s head and she rested it on his stomach.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank heavens,&rdquo; she said. A few minutes passed before the pain began to subside, &ldquo;I just feel like I have an awful headache now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not so bad,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I think you should stay with me tonight so I can monitor any side effects, I wouldn&rsquo;t want you dying in your sleep.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How sweet,&rdquo; she teased.</p><p>&ldquo;You call it sweet, I call it not wanting to face the fury of your Uncle.&rdquo;</p><p>Lyra pulled away from his touch at the mention of her Uncle, remembering their discussion. &ldquo;I can get Madam Pomfrey to monitor me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to keep you up through the night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be more comfortable if it was me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have classes in the morning,&rdquo; she protested.</p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to sleep not knowing whether or not you were ok.&rdquo;</p><p>Her heart lodged itself into her throat and butterflies began to flutter in her stomach. She looked up at the concerned eyes of the Potions Master and nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have dinner.&rdquo;</p><p>Severus extended a hand to her and she took it, her fingers slipping so easily into his almost like his hands were a perfect match for hers. She let go before they left the room, not needing rumours to follow the two as they walked to the staff room together but she wondered if he knew what effect his touch had on her. She had tried to be so careful and to keep her distance but quickly she found herself slipping into old habits, falling back in love with the man.</p><p>The two ate and engaged in conversation with their colleagues, discussing the progress of her experiment as well as gossiping about students. Professor Kettleburn dropped by and gave Lyra his research into the pathogen that caused Psyrot. Her fingers were crossed that their current hypothesis would be correct. They dwelled in the staffroom for a while, continuing to exchange some small talk before the two wandered off to her quarters.</p><p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be able to take your regular potion,&rdquo; he said as they entered the classroom, &ldquo;It would ruin the results.&rdquo;</p><p>She nodded and paused for a moment to turning to address the Potions Master. &ldquo;Sev, thank you for giving me the draught.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You needed it,&rdquo; his brow furrowed unsure as to why she was thanking him. &ldquo;You should&rsquo;ve just asked. I told you, I would I always have it on hand for you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she frowned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that I stopped needing it for a while and we weren&rsquo;t talking so I thought-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lyra,&rdquo; he said firmly, closing the gap between them. &ldquo;I still care about you, I don&rsquo;t think I could ever stop. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve been helping you out, it&rsquo;s not just because you&rsquo;re my colleague but because I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>Confessions of love were supposed to be received with happiness but in all honesty, the expression just saddened her. She knew she loved him too but it all just seemed too complicated for a real relationship to be shared between them.</p><p>&ldquo;What happened to the girl who said she didn&rsquo;t care about blood purity?&rdquo; he asked, stroking her face.</p><p>She jerked away from his touch, her feelings of sadness quickly turning to anger. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention something I said a month ago and try to twist it into me rejecting you. You&rsquo;re the one who said pursuing this would be unwise. You can&rsquo;t be so hot and cold and expect me to still be there waiting for you.&rdquo;</p><p>Severus gritted his teeth as Lyra&rsquo;s emotions began to unwind. He took the anger that was seething from her words. He wasn&rsquo;t sure of what else to do, his eyes looked down in shame knowing that he was responsible for her outburst.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know how much you&rsquo;re fucking with me right now?&rdquo; she yelled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been keeping my distance, trying to get over my feelings for you and now you&rsquo;re back here again, touching me, telling me you love me and getting me to feel all this shit for you. You got me to confess how I felt about you and then you tell me that you fucking love me, not once but twice, and make me think that maybe we could be good together but then you take that little bit of hope that I have for us and you squash it. You deny it and it fucking hurts.&rdquo; Tears began to spill from her eyes, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do this, Sev. I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her and whispered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; and that was enough for her. She allowed herself to continue crying into his arms, the sobs that wracked through her body moved him as well and he felt the pain that he had caused her. Over and over again he whispered &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; and that seemed to calm her along with his fingers that were caressing her back.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair, Sev,&rdquo; she mumbled into his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s not?&rdquo; he asked, pulling himself away slightly so she could peak her head out and speak.</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just play with my emotions like that,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I care about you and I want to be with you and I&rsquo;m scared too but I&rsquo;m not leading you on.&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded, his lips pressed against her head. &ldquo;I never intended to hurt you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wanted us to try,&rdquo; she muttered, &ldquo;I wanted to see if it would work, to see if it was real and then go from there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to try,&rdquo; he replied.</p><p>&ldquo;You have to be honest,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>He nodded, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t walk away if it gets too hard.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok,&rdquo; he repeated, kissing the girl on the forehead. In his mind he whispered promises to himself that he would protect her and that this time he would succeed.</p><p>Lyra looked back up at the wizard who was affectionately kissing her and gave him a faint smile. She pulled him close to her, pushing herself up onto her tiptoes to close the gap between their lips. They kissed deeply for a moment before parting.</p><p>&ldquo;You need to sleep,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>She hummed in response, &ldquo;Shower first?&rdquo; She sucked in her bottom lip as she looked up at him, her eyes laced with desire.</p><p>&ldquo;I feel as though this is how you always con me into sleeping with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Con you?&rdquo; she asked playfully.</p><p>He hummed happily as his lips met her neck and began to nip her exposed flesh with his mouth. &ldquo;It always seems to be the shower or the bath.&rdquo;</p><p>She exhaled a small laugh, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a con. This is merely the payback I said I would owe you for mentoring me in potions. Plus if you&rsquo;re going to stay up all night looking after me I think I should make it worth your while.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh really?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, really.&rdquo; Her hands began to undress herself and she discarded her robes on the floor. Left in her underwear, she pulled away from the man and entered the ensuite attached to her bedroom. He followed behind, using his wand to quickly undress himself not having the patience to undo every single one of his buttons.</p><p>Lyra switched the shower on and turned to face him, her fingers unlatching her bra and allowing it to drop. Severus approached, now in only his briefs and began to unleash an onslaught of kisses on her lips, chin and neck. His hands made quick work of their remaining garments and he scooped up Lyra, wrapping her thighs around his waist and carrying her into the shower.</p><p>Lyra giggled as Severus mouth tickled her neck and the water soaked them both, dampening their hair. He pressed her body against the wall as leverage, one hand remaining firm on her thigh whilst the other appreciated her breasts. He groaned as his cock began to stir, &ldquo;Fuck, I&rsquo;ve missed you.&rdquo;</p><p>Her arms remained wrapped around his neck with one of her hands buried loosely in his hair. Severus&rsquo; hand reached between them, wrapping around his cock. He shifted her weight up, positioning his member at her entrance before letting her slide down its length. She moaned loudly as he gripped her thighs, lustfully fucking her against the shower wall.</p><p>Lyra&rsquo;s eyes were squeezed tightly shut as his hips assaulted hers, drawing out sounds of pleasure with every thrust. Severus watched her, his eyes greedily taking in every aspect of her. The way her face was twisted in bliss and how her body looked with water droplets cascading down them. Passionately, his face approached hers and their lips met. Lyra moaned into the kiss, attempting to kiss back but her head would pull away as she audibly expressed her body&rsquo;s desires.</p><p>Severus&rsquo; arms grew tired so he slid out of his lover and lowered her to the ground. Wordlessly, he guided her to turn around, her hands rested on the tiled wall and her back curved perfectly back so her ass was in the air ready for him to enter again. With ease, his member slid back into her pussy and he began to fuck her furiously. His hands were allowed to wander freely and they settled on her breasts, his fingers pulling at her nipples earn loud moans of approval.</p><p>Lyra&rsquo;s hand slid down between her legs and she began to rub the sensitive bundle of nerves that rested between them. The pleasure she felt from the combined stimulation of her nipples and cunt made her back arch further, pressing herself firmly against the wizard. Severus took this as an offer, one hand abandoned its post relenting on the nipple torture and instead appreciated the curve of her ass.</p><p>He groped it, enjoying the feel of her firm flesh then he slapped it, resulting in a moan of surprise. He felt the walls that surrounded his cock twitch in excitement. Smirking to himself he continued to spank her as he plunged in and out of her. He had an overwhelming desire to turn her skin red but he also wished to come.</p><p>Lyra&rsquo;s pussy continued to twitch as she neared her orgasm. It was beginning to bear down around him and the sounds that were spilling from her lips were intoxicating. He felt so close and knew she was too but was afraid that he would come before she did. &ldquo;Lyra, I&rsquo;m not going to last. Sweet Circe, your cunt is so tight.&rdquo;</p><p>Those words drove Lyra right over the edge, a strained moan escaped her as she came hard. A few more thrusts and Severus joined her in the throws of orgasm, filling her with his seed. He slid out and pulled her body close to his to support her in the unsteadiness of her orgasm afterglow.</p><p>Her head nuzzled into his chest allowing the water of the shower to soak her hair and clean her body. She pulled away and kissed him before reaching for her bottle of shampoo. She lathered his hair, styling it into a mohawk she giggled at her creation before beginning to wash her own hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Am I allowed to rinse this off?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I think the mohawk suits you,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very muggle punk.&rdquo;</p><p>He rolled his eyes before dipping his head under the water. Next Lyra reached for the bar of soap. Severus allowed her hands to roam his body, covering him in suds before rinsing them away. He returned the favour, taking particular care in soaping her more intimate areas. His finger lingered on the puckered star between her cheeks and he leaned in to whisper, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait until I get to fuck this hole too.&rdquo;</p><p>She felt heat grow in the pit of her stomach at the suggestion of his words. The sweet baritone of his voice saying something so vulgar seemed to accentuate her reaction, her face flushed and her eyes cast downwards afraid to meet his.</p><p>&ldquo;Horny again already?&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;Surely this isn&rsquo;t a side effect of your treatment.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a side effect of your words,&rdquo; she quipped. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re ruining the results of my experiment.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stop then,&rdquo; he suggested withdrawing his touch and earning a glare from the witch. &ldquo;How is your head?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; she shrugged.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get you to bed,&rdquo; he said as he stepped out of the shower.</p><p>Severus reached for his wand and with a few waves he switched the shower off and non-verbally dried their bodies. Lyra slipped into her pyjamas whilst Severus redressed into his robes, claiming that if he got comfortable he would want to sleep too.</p><p>&ldquo;Could you lay with me until I fall asleep?&rdquo; she asked as she slid into bed.</p><p>He nodded, &ldquo;Do you have anything I could read?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A few healing books here and there,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Make yourself at home. You can read my report too and let me know if it sounds alright.&rdquo;</p><p>Her eyes were heavy and she began to slip into sleep before he even joined her. She did fight it briefly, wanting to enjoy his company. She felt his weight shift the bed slightly and she mumbled, &ldquo;Sev, you know I love you too, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>He stroked her hair, brushing it out of her face. &ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;m glad.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, Severus Snape.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Side effect of the inhalation of Venomous Tentacula juice includes horniness and confessions of love.&rdquo;</p><p>She laughed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious, Sev.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too, Lyra Lestrange.&rdquo;</p>",

When Lyra Lestrange&rsquo;s old headmaster offers her a position as Defence Against the Dark Arts Teacher she finds herself thrown into an adventure involving a secret affair with a colleague, discovering the cure for a disease and dealing with students cursing themselves.

She obliged and enjoyed the company of her family before returning to Hogwarts. This time around, Draco did not cry.

Draco did not appreciate the condescension Harry, but respected his ability to keep his composure to others.<br/><br/></li>\n <li>For fun, Harry and Draco made fun of Crabbe and Goyle. Once they bewitched them to make them thinner, and put clothes a few sizes smaller, and then in the classroom fabric simply torn. After class, they have long laughed at this, for the first time, noting that they were a pretty good Duo.<br/><br/></li>\n <li>Draco had insisted that Potter wore a black shirt to the prom, because &ldquo;all of the great witches and wizards should look accordingly to their status&rdquo; and not because he just liked Harry in the black shirt.<br/><br/></li>\n <li>After the ball, they started talking seriously about the Dark Lord. Draco knew that made Voldemort with his parents Harry, and instead of pull him to the side of the sorcerer, he allows himself to hug the brunette. Then they both felt a strange but necessary warm craving for each other.<br/><br/></li>\n <li>Malfoy was often his arms around Potter&rsquo;s shoulders when they were out partying with other guys. Sometimes he held his hands on his shoulders a little longer than usual.<br/><br/></li>\n <li>Harry agreed to teach Draco to speak Parseltongue. Nothing, in the end, did not work, but a joint venture brought them closer.</li>\n <li>When Harry disappeared with a dragon in the first test, Draco greatly worried for him. When the fight ended, after the meeting in the living room of Slytherin Malfoy hugged the guy, strain, that he is an idiot and if he tries again to die, he would kill him.<br/><br/></li>\n <li>They understood their feelings only then, when Harry adopted side of the Dark one Lord. Years later he admits he did it only to time to time to protect Draco.<br/><br/></li>\n <li>When Harry returned from the maze with the dead body of Diggory, after returning to school Malfoy calmed guy. Their joint experiences gave rise to the first kiss.<br/><br/></li><li>They secretly go to Owlery, where they surrender to their feelings. And sometimes continue to the urge to mock me over some students.<br/><br/></li><li>They always waited for the moment of privacy, and when the duration of &ldquo;break&rdquo; was up to several months, the long-awaited meeting, they were ready to tear each other apart. As a result, they just kept a soundproof barrier in the pantry for several hours.<br/><br/></li><li>During sex Draco conjured up a snake (Leptophis ahaetulla), which was crawling on their bodies under Imperius. Harry admitted that he had never been aroused by fear.<br/><br/></li><li>Harry wanted Draco to use the Imperius on him. Draco liked it sharply to break the spell, to see the tumult, and after the heat on my face Harry, who with more zeal was engaged in love with him.<br/><br/></li><li>After his wife died, Malfoy, the last is trying to communicate<br/>with Harry, and he succeeds.
