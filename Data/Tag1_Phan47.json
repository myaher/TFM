He tries to pretend that his eyes don\u2019t water and his body doesn\u2019t feel heavy whenever he says them. But the truth was that he felt as if this was something that he would never be able to get over. It\u2019s been nearly a month and he still finds it hard to say those words.\u00a0</p><p>\tHis mum looks at him. \u201cPhil, what do you mean?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shrugs and looks back down. \u201cExactly what I said.\u201d He says with a tinge of edge in his voice. \u201cDan and I broke up\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh, Phil!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tSuddenly his mum is on his side and wrapping a set of arms around him. He feels like this is an acceptable time to let go of a few stray tears. So he lets a few slide down his cheek and drip onto his shirt.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell us?\u201d His mum asks carefully.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shrugs again. \u201cDidn\u2019t really wanna talk about it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHis mum pulled away from him and he turns to face her. Her expression is quite sad, which is another reason why didn\u2019t want to say anything to her. He knew she would be upset. He knew she would be disappointed.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell, are you okay?\u201d She asks carefully.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looks up at her and fakes a smile. \u201cI\u2019m getting there.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAre you sure?\u201d She says, pressing a little bit. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to go through this alone, you know?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nods. \u201cI know, mum.\u201d He says. \u201cBut I\u2019m okay right now. PJ and Sophie helped quite a bit.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHer hand smoothly strokes over Phil\u2019s arm. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re okay, sweetie.\u201d She says. \u201cBut if you want to talk about it, I\u2019ll be here for you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThank you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tAnd Phil means that too.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s so glad he has a supportive family to help him through this difficult time.\u00a0</p><p>\t***</p><p>\t\u201cHow are you doing, bear?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan peaks up over the top of the blankets that he\u2019s been hoarded in for the last few days since he\u2019s been home.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe doesn\u2019t respond. He lets his puffy red eyes talk for him.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe thought coming home would make it so it hurt less than being in the apartment with Phil. But it doesn\u2019t. It hurts more.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt hurts more because he misses Phil. He misses him a lot and the worse part about it is that he doesn\u2019t miss Phil as a person. He misses Phil\u2019s presence and Phil\u2019s attention to him.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut he\u2019s fucked up good and now he won\u2019t have it anymore come the first of the year\u2026Phil\u2019s already been looking for new flats.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe hates how they had to keep this a secret from their fans. He hates that this is the reason why this was the last Phil is not on fire. He hates that this is the reason for their gaming channel hiatus\u2014because they have to decide how to continue the channel without them living together now.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt hurts.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt really <i>fucking </i>hurts.\u00a0</p><p>\tAnd it\u2019s all because of him. All because he was an asshole\u2014a stupid <i>fucking </i>asshole.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe hasn\u2019t realized that he\u2019s not said anything to answer his mum until he opens his eyes and finds her staring at him.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDaniel, please.\u201d She pleads. \u201cIt\u2019s Christmas morning and you haven\u2019t even come down to open your gifts.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m not sure I want them\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDaniel, I know it\u2019s been hard but your father and I would really love for you to come down.\u201d She pauses. \u201cAdrian also has a gift for you that he\u2019s really excited for you to open.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan contemplates her words and lets them comb around in his head. He finally decides that he should do this. Not because he wants to. But because he feels like he should now.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe tosses back his blanket and sits up in bed. His mum moves away so he can get up. He grabs his phone on the way and follows her down, the weight of the world making him feel like he could collapse.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\t\u201cWhat are you going to do with your flat?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looks up over the glass of his drink at Martyn and sighs. \u201cDan\u2019s keeping it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSo what are you going to do?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cProbably move out to somewhere else in London.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDo you already have a flat ready?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd why not?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shrugs. He picks up his glass and takes a sip of the eggnog that his mum had poured for him and Martyn just a few moments before that. <br/>\n\u00a0\tHe avoids the question by grabbing a cookie from the tin and taking a bite, letting the crumbs fall to the counter top.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMartyn, just\u2026don\u2019t.\u201d Phil says, reaching up and squeezing the bridge of his nose between his fingers.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s a solid question.\u201d Martyn pressed harder. \u201cYou can\u2019t avoid this and put it off.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil, you\u2019ve been broken up with Dan for over a month now.\u201d Martyn says, his words blunt. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect to live with him forever.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSays who.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh come off it, Phil! That\u2019s ridiculous and <i>you </i>know it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cCan you just shut up for a second!\u201d Phil snaps.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe room around them is so quiet you could hear a pin drop and the air was so thick he could feel it. When he looks up at Martyn, he can see Martyn is averting his gaze and turning his head away from him.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMartyn,\u201d Phil begins, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m\u2026I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tMartyn nods back at him and stands up, grabbing his own glass. He walks out of the room and Phil is left sitting there with frustrated tears coming to his eyes as he forced himself to hold back.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\t\u201cYou know, I never thought I\u2019d ever experience this.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan is staring across the lake as Adrian sits beside him and Colin runs into the water.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cExperience what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThis break up.\u201d Dan says simply.\u00a0</p><p>\tAdrian turns to him and bites in the corner of his lip. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nodded. \u201cI think I have to.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tAdrian waited and Dan could see he was waiting so he finally spoke again.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI was the one who fucked up.\u201d He says. \u201cAnd I have so much <i>guilt </i>because of it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tAdrian remains sitting quietly.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI literally just\u2026\u201d Dan sighs as he continues. \u201cI just hate what I did. I have to live with seeing Phil every day, looking at me, as he tries to hold back tears. I fucked it up so badly, Adrian. I\u2019m not sure I can ever fix it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThere are tears coming to his eyes and he wipes them away.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDo you want to fix it?\u201d Adrian asks.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nods without hesitation. \u201cI love Phil so much.\u201d He says. \u201cI never wanted to hurt him. I was so <i>stupid </i>and I can\u2019t stop kicking myself over it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Adrian asked, peering out over the lake where Colin was now running through the water again and splashing around.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2026\u201d Dan stops and lets a few tears fall from his eyes as he squeezes them tight. \u201cI slept with a guy that I met online.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s not the fact that he slept with him,\u201d Phil says as he wipes the tears from his cheek, \u201cIt\u2019s the feeling of betrayal.\u201d He tries to hold back a sob in front of his mum, afraid he was upsetting her. But he couldn\u2019t hold back anymore. \u201cWas I not good enough anymore? Did I not give him what he wanted?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh, baby.\u201d His mum cooed, wrapping her arms around him and pulling him to her chest. \u201cSometimes, people do things that hurt.\u201d She said gently. \u201cAnd sometimes you wish and wish and wish you could know why they did what they did. But sometimes, it\u2019s okay to not know. It\u2019s okay to wish and to wonder what happened.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt hurts.\u201d Phil croaked out, letting a sob retch out of his throat as a new fresh dam of tears broke through and soaked his skin. He turned and pressed his face in his mum\u2019s shoulder, hiding it from her view.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know it does.\u201d She says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt for a while. But you\u2019re strong, dear. You\u2019re going to get through this and me, your father, and Martyn will all be standing by you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil sniffled before he let out another pained sob that followed with another round of tears. \u201cI loved him.\u201d Phil manages to get out. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s because I waited so long to propose?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHis mum pulled away and stared into his eyes, her own features going soft. \u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself for the mistakes of others. What Dan did was something he consciously made the decision to do. It has nothing to do with you and there is no reason for you to beat yourself up over it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe sat back on the couch where they were sitting and reached up, wiping the tears from his cheek with the back of his sleeve. When he peers over his mums shoulder, he sees Martyn standing in the doorway, looking down at the floor. He turns his stare away and feels the touch of his mum\u2019s hand on his arm.\u00a0</p><p>\tHis phone buzzes in his pocket and he pulls it out. It\u2019s a text from Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\t<i>Can you talk?\u00a0</i></p><p>****</p><p>\tDan knew it was stupid to text Phil. They\u2019d spoken probably five words to each other in the last week and surely he\u2019s not going to want to speak to him. That\u2019s pretty obvious.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut Phil does answer.\u00a0</p><p>\t<i>Why?\u00a0</i></p><p>\tDan bites his lip to hold back the tears that are already beginning. He\u2019s alone in his childhood room, sitting on the bed like his teenage self used to do, and he\u2019s been hyping himself up to text Phil since he spoke with Adrian.\u00a0</p><p>\t<i>I think we should talk. We haven\u2019t spoken probably.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\t</i>It only takes a few moments for the three bubble to pop up and then disappear or a moment. His heart flips in his chest and then his phone buzzes. <i>Phil Lester would like to Facetime.\u00a0</i></p><p>\tDan quickly reaches for his AirPods and puts them in as he clicks accept and waits for Phil to show up on his screen. When he does, Dan tries to ignore the puffy, clearly bloodshot eyes that Phil has.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHey.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHey.\u201d Phil answers, his voice raspy.\u00a0\t</p><p>\tDan sucks his lips into a straight line. He let\u2019s them go. \u201cHow was your Christmas?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Phil snaps, his voice tight and drawn.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe tone of Phil\u2019s voice catches Dan off guard. He didn\u2019t expect that level of harshness from Phil, but it is warranted. He did fuck up a bunch and Phil has every right to act the way he has been.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil,\u201d Dan begins. \u201cI want you to know that I&hellip;\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNo.\u201d Phil interrupts him, shaking his head. His eyes glisten and Dan feels the overwhelming feeling of his own tears bubbling up and threatening to spill over. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to do that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what I was going to say.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou were going to say that you still loved me.\u201d Phil says, a clear break in his voice.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan feels the tears spill out his skin and he breathes in a shuttering breath. \u201cBecause I do, Phil. I love you so much.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThen why did you sleep with him?\u201d Phil asks.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan looked away from his phone to stare up at the ceiling. He squeezed his eyes shut, letting a few more tears fall out before he tipped his head back down. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh, well that\u2019s a <i>fucking </i>refreshing answer.\u201d Phil bit out. \u201cYou mean to tell me that you don\u2019t even know why you spread your <i>fucking </i>legs like some&hellip;\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil stop!\u201d Dan cried out, feeling the sobs catch in his throat. \u201cPlease don\u2019t say that. You don\u2019t mean that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat else do you want me to say?\u201d Phil asked. \u201cYou went out and fucked some guy. <i>You </i>cheated on me. <i>You\u2019re </i>the one who ruined our relationship.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI&hellip;\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDo you remember what you said to me the night you told me?\u201d Phil continued as Dan struggled to hold back the sobs that were forcing their way out of his mouth as he covered them with his hand. \u201cYou told me that it didn\u2019t mean anything. You said that you never meant to do it. So then why did you? Why did you go out and sleep with him, Dan? Was I not good enough anymore?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil broke at the last word and Dan tried to drown out the sounds of his sobs from his ears. They felt like hundreds of bullets hitting his skin all at the same time. They hurt.\u00a0</p><p>\tBetween them both, they cried until their sobbing drew less and less. By the time Dan got around to answering, his chest hurt and he had a throbbing headache and just wanted to sleep.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWe were just getting back from tour&hellip;I was stressed, you were stressed.\u201d Dan stopped and swallowed back any more sobs he was struggling to hold back. \u201cYou and I both know we weren\u2019t good.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSo you went out and found someone else.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s not what happened.\u201d Dan countered. \u201cI never meant to do that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou don\u2019t accidentally fall onto another mans dick.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant!\u201d Dan cried. \u201cYou know I would never hurt you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou hurt me pretty damn bad.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know, and I\u2019ll never have the words to say how sorry I am.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThere is a silence between them.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhen are you going home to the flat?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan looked down at his lap. \u201cTomorrow.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ll be home Friday.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI\u2019ll be packing my things and leaving to stay with Martyn until I find a flat.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan feels his chin wobble. He barely manages out a simple, \u201cOkay.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWe should try and talk to each other&hellip;face to face&hellip;before I go.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI think we need some closure. It\u2019s clear we\u2019re both in pretty bad shape.\u201d\u00a0\t</p><p>\tDan lets out a chuckle. \u201cWe\u2019re a mess.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil laughs a little bit too.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m gonna go now.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan doesn\u2019t even have time to say anything before Phil hangs up and he\u2019s left staring at a black screen.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe let\u2019s out a sigh and throws his phone on the side of his bed.\u00a0</p><p>\t****</p><p>\tPhil twists his key into the flat, trying to ignore how his heart hurts at how this might be the last time he\u2019ll ever do this.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen he walks in, he notices how everything looks exactly the same\u2014as it should\u2014but also how everything looks so foreign to him as well. This doesn\u2019t look like his flat anymore. It looks like a strange place he\u2019s never been in before.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan is in their lounge. He\u2019s sitting on their couch with his legs crossed and his laptop on his thighs. He doesn\u2019t look up when Phil walks in but Phil knows he needs to talk to him. But the hurt he can feel in his chest as he sees the way Dan\u2019s ignoring any gaze towards him cuts deep.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI packed some of your clothes already.\u201d Dan\u2019s voice says. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t end up doing much.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nods slowly.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe doesn\u2019t want to do this. He doesn\u2019t want to go into their bedroom and pack up his life. He doesn\u2019t want this. This wasn\u2019t how his life was supposed to go. He was supposed to propose to Dan on Christmas. He was supposed to celebrate how happy he was with Dan. They were supposed to be planning a wedding, adopting a dog, and possibly even talking about children.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s not ready to give that all up yet&hellip;but he has to.\u00a0</p><p>\tA part of his mind is telling him to just run, but another part is telling him to talk to Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cCan we talk?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThe later wins out.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan looks up and nods. \u201cYeah, I think we should.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil walks over to the couch and takes a seat next to Dan, but still far away where they aren\u2019t touching.\u00a0\t</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t want to do this.\u201d Phil says, shaking his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to move out. I don\u2019t want to pack up my things.\u201d He pauses. \u201cI don\u2019t want to <i>lose </i>you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan pushed his laptop away and sat up straight. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to lose me.\u201d He says. \u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ve already lost you&hellip;I lost you the day you decided to sleep with that guy.\u201d\u00a0\t</p><p>\t\u201cYou never lost me.\u201d Dan said, his voice soft.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDon\u2019t make this harder than how it has to be.\u201d Phil says.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou don\u2019t know how much it hurts me,\u201d Dan says. \u201cHow much it actually kills me inside that I did what I did. I was such a <i>fucking </i>idiot. I\u2019ll never forgive myself for it. I\u2019ll never forgive myself for being the reason for your pain and for us ending. You gave me the best ten years of my entire life and I\u2019ll never find someone like you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ll never find someone like you either.\u201d Phil croaks. He reaches up and rubs under his eyes to catch the moisture that is beginning. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever stop loving you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ll never stop loving you.\u201d Dan says. \u201cYou were my first love. You gave me everything I could have ever wanted&hellip;and I threw it away.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen Phil finally looks at Dan, he can see Dan\u2019s chin wobbling and his eyes are glassed over, struggling to hold back tears. Without thinking, he reaches out, and places his hand on Dan\u2019s cheek, trying to steady him. Dan leans into the touch as his face scrunches up and tears leak out.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil leans in. He doesn\u2019t know why he does. But he does. And suddenly he\u2019s kissing Dan, feeling the wetness on Dan\u2019s lips from his tears. Dan reciprocates the kiss with no hesitation. They shouldn\u2019t be doing this. They\u2019re meant to be broken up but it happens anyway.\u00a0</p><p>\tAnd before either of them can realize what they\u2019re doing, they\u2019re naked and tangled together on the couch, Dan\u2019s moans filling the room along with the sound of skin against skin. It\u2019s vulgar, and it feels wrong. But at the same time, it feels <i>right.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\t</i>When it\u2019s over, Dan is curled up on their couch, his eyes shut as he falls asleep. Phil takes one look down at him and feels the tears rush down his cheeks again. He gathers his clothing from the floor and re-dresses himself. As Dan\u2019s soft breaths fill into the room, he walks slowly into the bedroom and grabs one of the boxes that Dan has already filled. On the outside in Dan\u2019s chicken-scratch writing, it says \u2018Phils\u2019.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe carries it out of the bedroom and when he walks into the living room, Dan is sitting up on the couch, pulling a shirt on and pulling his pants back on. Phil doesn\u2019t say anything to him, but given the way Dan\u2019s chest is heaving and he\u2019s squeezing his eyes shut says enough.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe opens the door to the flat and walks out, shutting the door behind him. Martyn is stood on the other side, playing on his phone. He looks up at Phil and lets out a sigh. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d He asks gently, putting his arm around Phil\u2019s shoulders.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil just shakes his head, carrying the lone box in his hands. He\u2019s not even sure what clothing of his is packed inside. Martyn gives him a sympathetic look as he removes his arm from around him and takes the box from Phil\u2019s shaking arms.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cLet\u2019s just go sit down for a little bit okay?\u201d Martyn says. \u201cWe can grab the rest later.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil just nods, and wraps his arms around himself as he sniffles and follows Martyn to the elevator.\u00a0</p>",

He tries to pretend that his eyes don\u2019t water and his body doesn\u2019t feel heavy whenever he says them. But the truth was that he felt as if this was something that he would never be able to get over. It\u2019s been nearly a month and he still finds it hard to say those words.\u00a0</p><p>\tHis mum looks at him. \u201cPhil, what do you mean?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shrugs and looks back down. \u201cExactly what I said.\u201d He says with a tinge of edge in his voice. \u201cDan and I broke up\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh, Phil!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tSuddenly his mum is on his side and wrapping a set of arms around him. He feels like this is an acceptable time to let go of a few stray tears. So he lets a few slide down his cheek and drip onto his shirt.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell us?\u201d His mum asks carefully.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shrugs again. \u201cDidn\u2019t really wanna talk about it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHis mum pulled away from him and he turns to face her. Her expression is quite sad, which is another reason why didn\u2019t want to say anything to her. He knew she would be upset. He knew she would be disappointed.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell, are you okay?\u201d She asks carefully.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looks up at her and fakes a smile. \u201cI\u2019m getting there.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAre you sure?\u201d She says, pressing a little bit. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to go through this alone, you know?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nods. \u201cI know, mum.\u201d He says. \u201cBut I\u2019m okay right now. PJ and Sophie helped quite a bit.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHer hand smoothly strokes over Phil\u2019s arm. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re okay, sweetie.\u201d She says. \u201cBut if you want to talk about it, I\u2019ll be here for you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThank you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tAnd Phil means that too.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s so glad he has a supportive family to help him through this difficult time.\u00a0</p><p>\t***</p><p>\t\u201cHow are you doing, bear?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan peaks up over the top of the blankets that he\u2019s been hoarded in for the last few days since he\u2019s been home.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe doesn\u2019t respond. He lets his puffy red eyes talk for him.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe thought coming home would make it so it hurt less than being in the apartment with Phil. But it doesn\u2019t. It hurts more.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt hurts more because he misses Phil. He misses him a lot and the worse part about it is that he doesn\u2019t miss Phil as a person. He misses Phil\u2019s presence and Phil\u2019s attention to him.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut he\u2019s fucked up good and now he won\u2019t have it anymore come the first of the year\u2026Phil\u2019s already been looking for new flats.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe hates how they had to keep this a secret from their fans. He hates that this is the reason why this was the last Phil is not on fire. He hates that this is the reason for their gaming channel hiatus\u2014because they have to decide how to continue the channel without them living together now.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt hurts.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt really <i>fucking </i>hurts.\u00a0</p><p>\tAnd it\u2019s all because of him. All because he was an asshole\u2014a stupid <i>fucking </i>asshole.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe hasn\u2019t realized that he\u2019s not said anything to answer his mum until he opens his eyes and finds her staring at him.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDaniel, please.\u201d She pleads. \u201cIt\u2019s Christmas morning and you haven\u2019t even come down to open your gifts.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m not sure I want them\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDaniel, I know it\u2019s been hard but your father and I would really love for you to come down.\u201d She pauses. \u201cAdrian also has a gift for you that he\u2019s really excited for you to open.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan contemplates her words and lets them comb around in his head. He finally decides that he should do this. Not because he wants to. But because he feels like he should now.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe tosses back his blanket and sits up in bed. His mum moves away so he can get up. He grabs his phone on the way and follows her down, the weight of the world making him feel like he could collapse.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\t\u201cWhat are you going to do with your flat?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looks up over the glass of his drink at Martyn and sighs. \u201cDan\u2019s keeping it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSo what are you going to do?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cProbably move out to somewhere else in London.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDo you already have a flat ready?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd why not?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shrugs. He picks up his glass and takes a sip of the eggnog that his mum had poured for him and Martyn just a few moments before that. <br>\n\u00a0\tHe avoids the question by grabbing a cookie from the tin and taking a bite, letting the crumbs fall to the counter top.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMartyn, just\u2026don\u2019t.\u201d Phil says, reaching up and squeezing the bridge of his nose between his fingers.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s a solid question.\u201d Martyn pressed harder. \u201cYou can\u2019t avoid this and put it off.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil, you\u2019ve been broken up with Dan for over a month now.\u201d Martyn says, his words blunt. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect to live with him forever.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSays who.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh come off it, Phil! That\u2019s ridiculous and <i>you </i>know it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cCan you just shut up for a second!\u201d Phil snaps.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe room around them is so quiet you could hear a pin drop and the air was so thick he could feel it. When he looks up at Martyn, he can see Martyn is averting his gaze and turning his head away from him.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMartyn,\u201d Phil begins, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m\u2026I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tMartyn nods back at him and stands up, grabbing his own glass. He walks out of the room and Phil is left sitting there with frustrated tears coming to his eyes as he forced himself to hold back.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\t\u201cYou know, I never thought I\u2019d ever experience this.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan is staring across the lake as Adrian sits beside him and Colin runs into the water.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cExperience what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThis break up.\u201d Dan says simply.\u00a0</p><p>\tAdrian turns to him and bites in the corner of his lip. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nodded. \u201cI think I have to.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tAdrian waited and Dan could see he was waiting so he finally spoke again.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI was the one who fucked up.\u201d He says. \u201cAnd I have so much <i>guilt </i>because of it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tAdrian remains sitting quietly.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI literally just\u2026\u201d Dan sighs as he continues. \u201cI just hate what I did. I have to live with seeing Phil every day, looking at me, as he tries to hold back tears. I fucked it up so badly, Adrian. I\u2019m not sure I can ever fix it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThere are tears coming to his eyes and he wipes them away.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDo you want to fix it?\u201d Adrian asks.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nods without hesitation. \u201cI love Phil so much.\u201d He says. \u201cI never wanted to hurt him. I was so <i>stupid </i>and I can\u2019t stop kicking myself over it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Adrian asked, peering out over the lake where Colin was now running through the water again and splashing around.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2026\u201d Dan stops and lets a few tears fall from his eyes as he squeezes them tight. \u201cI slept with a guy that I met online.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s not the fact that he slept with him,\u201d Phil says as he wipes the tears from his cheek, \u201cIt\u2019s the feeling of betrayal.\u201d He tries to hold back a sob in front of his mum, afraid he was upsetting her. But he couldn\u2019t hold back anymore. \u201cWas I not good enough anymore? Did I not give him what he wanted?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh, baby.\u201d His mum cooed, wrapping her arms around him and pulling him to her chest. \u201cSometimes, people do things that hurt.\u201d She said gently. \u201cAnd sometimes you wish and wish and wish you could know why they did what they did. But sometimes, it\u2019s okay to not know. It\u2019s okay to wish and to wonder what happened.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt hurts.\u201d Phil croaked out, letting a sob retch out of his throat as a new fresh dam of tears broke through and soaked his skin. He turned and pressed his face in his mum\u2019s shoulder, hiding it from her view.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know it does.\u201d She says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt for a while. But you\u2019re strong, dear. You\u2019re going to get through this and me, your father, and Martyn will all be standing by you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil sniffled before he let out another pained sob that followed with another round of tears. \u201cI loved him.\u201d Phil manages to get out. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s because I waited so long to propose?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHis mum pulled away and stared into his eyes, her own features going soft. \u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself for the mistakes of others. What Dan did was something he consciously made the decision to do. It has nothing to do with you and there is no reason for you to beat yourself up over it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe sat back on the couch where they were sitting and reached up, wiping the tears from his cheek with the back of his sleeve. When he peers over his mums shoulder, he sees Martyn standing in the doorway, looking down at the floor. He turns his stare away and feels the touch of his mum\u2019s hand on his arm.\u00a0</p><p>\tHis phone buzzes in his pocket and he pulls it out. It\u2019s a text from Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\t<i>Can you talk?\u00a0</i></p><p>****</p><p>\tDan knew it was stupid to text Phil. They\u2019d spoken probably five words to each other in the last week and surely he\u2019s not going to want to speak to him. That\u2019s pretty obvious.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut Phil does answer.\u00a0</p><p>\t<i>Why?\u00a0</i></p><p>\tDan bites his lip to hold back the tears that are already beginning. He\u2019s alone in his childhood room, sitting on the bed like his teenage self used to do, and he\u2019s been hyping himself up to text Phil since he spoke with Adrian.\u00a0</p><p>\t<i>I think we should talk. We haven\u2019t spoken probably.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\t</i>It only takes a few moments for the three bubble to pop up and then disappear or a moment. His heart flips in his chest and then his phone buzzes. <i>Phil Lester would like to Facetime.\u00a0</i></p><p>\tDan quickly reaches for his AirPods and puts them in as he clicks accept and waits for Phil to show up on his screen. When he does, Dan tries to ignore the puffy, clearly bloodshot eyes that Phil has.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHey.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHey.\u201d Phil answers, his voice raspy.\u00a0\t</p><p>\tDan sucks his lips into a straight line. He let\u2019s them go. \u201cHow was your Christmas?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Phil snaps, his voice tight and drawn.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe tone of Phil\u2019s voice catches Dan off guard. He didn\u2019t expect that level of harshness from Phil, but it is warranted. He did fuck up a bunch and Phil has every right to act the way he has been.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil,\u201d Dan begins. \u201cI want you to know that I\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNo.\u201d Phil interrupts him, shaking his head. His eyes glisten and Dan feels the overwhelming feeling of his own tears bubbling up and threatening to spill over. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to do that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what I was going to say.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou were going to say that you still loved me.\u201d Phil says, a clear break in his voice.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan feels the tears spill out his skin and he breathes in a shuttering breath. \u201cBecause I do, Phil. I love you so much.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThen why did you sleep with him?\u201d Phil asks.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan looked away from his phone to stare up at the ceiling. He squeezed his eyes shut, letting a few more tears fall out before he tipped his head back down. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh, well that\u2019s a <i>fucking </i>refreshing answer.\u201d Phil bit out. \u201cYou mean to tell me that you don\u2019t even know why you spread your <i>fucking </i>legs like some\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil stop!\u201d Dan cried out, feeling the sobs catch in his throat. \u201cPlease don\u2019t say that. You don\u2019t mean that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat else do you want me to say?\u201d Phil asked. \u201cYou went out and fucked some guy. <i>You </i>cheated on me. <i>You\u2019re </i>the one who ruined our relationship.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDo you remember what you said to me the night you told me?\u201d Phil continued as Dan struggled to hold back the sobs that were forcing their way out of his mouth as he covered them with his hand. \u201cYou told me that it didn\u2019t mean anything. You said that you never meant to do it. So then why did you? Why did you go out and sleep with him, Dan? Was I not good enough anymore?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil broke at the last word and Dan tried to drown out the sounds of his sobs from his ears. They felt like hundreds of bullets hitting his skin all at the same time. They hurt.\u00a0</p><p>\tBetween them both, they cried until their sobbing drew less and less. By the time Dan got around to answering, his chest hurt and he had a throbbing headache and just wanted to sleep.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWe were just getting back from tour\u2026I was stressed, you were stressed.\u201d Dan stopped and swallowed back any more sobs he was struggling to hold back. \u201cYou and I both know we weren\u2019t good.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSo you went out and found someone else.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s not what happened.\u201d Dan countered. \u201cI never meant to do that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou don\u2019t accidentally fall onto another mans dick.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant!\u201d Dan cried. \u201cYou know I would never hurt you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou hurt me pretty damn bad.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know, and I\u2019ll never have the words to say how sorry I am.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThere is a silence between them.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhen are you going home to the flat?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan looked down at his lap. \u201cTomorrow.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ll be home Friday.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI\u2019ll be packing my things and leaving to stay with Martyn until I find a flat.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan feels his chin wobble. He barely manages out a simple, \u201cOkay.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWe should try and talk to each other\u2026face to face\u2026before I go.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI think we need some closure. It\u2019s clear we\u2019re both in pretty bad shape.\u201d\u00a0\t</p><p>\tDan lets out a chuckle. \u201cWe\u2019re a mess.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil laughs a little bit too.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m gonna go now.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan doesn\u2019t even have time to say anything before Phil hangs up and he\u2019s left staring at a black screen.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe let\u2019s out a sigh and throws his phone on the side of his bed.\u00a0</p><p>\t****</p><p>\tPhil twists his key into the flat, trying to ignore how his heart hurts at how this might be the last time he\u2019ll ever do this.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen he walks in, he notices how everything looks exactly the same\u2014as it should\u2014but also how everything looks so foreign to him as well. This doesn\u2019t look like his flat anymore. It looks like a strange place he\u2019s never been in before.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan is in their lounge. He\u2019s sitting on their couch with his legs crossed and his laptop on his thighs. He doesn\u2019t look up when Phil walks in but Phil knows he needs to talk to him. But the hurt he can feel in his chest as he sees the way Dan\u2019s ignoring any gaze towards him cuts deep.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI packed some of your clothes already.\u201d Dan\u2019s voice says. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t end up doing much.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nods slowly.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe doesn\u2019t want to do this. He doesn\u2019t want to go into their bedroom and pack up his life. He doesn\u2019t want this. This wasn\u2019t how his life was supposed to go. He was supposed to propose to Dan on Christmas. He was supposed to celebrate how happy he was with Dan. They were supposed to be planning a wedding, adopting a dog, and possibly even talking about children.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s not ready to give that all up yet\u2026but he has to.\u00a0</p><p>\tA part of his mind is telling him to just run, but another part is telling him to talk to Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cCan we talk?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThe later wins out.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan looks up and nods. \u201cYeah, I think we should.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil walks over to the couch and takes a seat next to Dan, but still far away where they aren\u2019t touching.\u00a0\t</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t want to do this.\u201d Phil says, shaking his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to move out. I don\u2019t want to pack up my things.\u201d He pauses. \u201cI don\u2019t want to <i>lose </i>you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan pushed his laptop away and sat up straight. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to lose me.\u201d He says. \u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ve already lost you\u2026I lost you the day you decided to sleep with that guy.\u201d\u00a0\t</p><p>\t\u201cYou never lost me.\u201d Dan said, his voice soft.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDon\u2019t make this harder than how it has to be.\u201d Phil says.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou don\u2019t know how much it hurts me,\u201d Dan says. \u201cHow much it actually kills me inside that I did what I did. I was such a <i>fucking </i>idiot. I\u2019ll never forgive myself for it. I\u2019ll never forgive myself for being the reason for your pain and for us ending. You gave me the best ten years of my entire life and I\u2019ll never find someone like you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ll never find someone like you either.\u201d Phil croaks. He reaches up and rubs under his eyes to catch the moisture that is beginning. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever stop loving you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ll never stop loving you.\u201d Dan says. \u201cYou were my first love. You gave me everything I could have ever wanted\u2026and I threw it away.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen Phil finally looks at Dan, he can see Dan\u2019s chin wobbling and his eyes are glassed over, struggling to hold back tears. Without thinking, he reaches out, and places his hand on Dan\u2019s cheek, trying to steady him. Dan leans into the touch as his face scrunches up and tears leak out.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil leans in. He doesn\u2019t know why he does. But he does. And suddenly he\u2019s kissing Dan, feeling the wetness on Dan\u2019s lips from his tears. Dan reciprocates the kiss with no hesitation. They shouldn\u2019t be doing this. They\u2019re meant to be broken up but it happens anyway.\u00a0</p><p>\tAnd before either of them can realize what they\u2019re doing, they\u2019re naked and tangled together on the couch, Dan\u2019s moans filling the room along with the sound of skin against skin. It\u2019s vulgar, and it feels wrong. But at the same time, it feels <i>right.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\t</i>When it\u2019s over, Dan is curled up on their couch, his eyes shut as he falls asleep. Phil takes one look down at him and feels the tears rush down his cheeks again. He gathers his clothing from the floor and re-dresses himself. As Dan\u2019s soft breaths fill into the room, he walks slowly into the bedroom and grabs one of the boxes that Dan has already filled. On the outside in Dan\u2019s chicken-scratch writing, it says \u2018Phils\u2019.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe carries it out of the bedroom and when he walks into the living room, Dan is sitting up on the couch, pulling a shirt on and pulling his pants back on. Phil doesn\u2019t say anything to him, but given the way Dan\u2019s chest is heaving and he\u2019s squeezing his eyes shut says enough.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe opens the door to the flat and walks out, shutting the door behind him. Martyn is stood on the other side, playing on his phone. He looks up at Phil and lets out a sigh. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d He asks gently, putting his arm around Phil\u2019s shoulders.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil just shakes his head, carrying the lone box in his hands. He\u2019s not even sure what clothing of his is packed inside. Martyn gives him a sympathetic look as he removes his arm from around him and takes the box from Phil\u2019s shaking arms.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cLet\u2019s just go sit down for a little bit okay?\u201d Martyn says. \u201cWe can grab the rest later.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil just nods, and wraps his arms around himself as he sniffles and follows Martyn to the elevator.\u00a0</p>",

He tries to pretend that his eyes don\u2019t water and his body doesn\u2019t feel heavy whenever he says them. But the truth was that he felt as if this was something that he would never be able to get over. It\u2019s been nearly a month and he still finds it hard to say those words.\u00a0</p><p>\tHis mum looks at him. \u201cPhil, what do you mean?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shrugs and looks back down. \u201cExactly what I said.\u201d He says with a tinge of edge in his voice. \u201cDan and I broke up\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh, Phil!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tSuddenly his mum is on his side and wrapping a set of arms around him.

He lets his puffy red eyes talk for him.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe thought coming home would make it so it hurt less than being in the apartment with Phil. But it doesn\u2019t. It hurts more.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt hurts more because he misses Phil. He misses him a lot and the worse part about it is that he doesn\u2019t miss Phil as a person. He misses Phil\u2019s presence and Phil\u2019s attention to him.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut he\u2019s fucked up good and now he won\u2019t have it anymore come the first of the year\u2026Phil\u2019s already been looking for new flats.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe hates how they had to keep this a secret from their fans.

He hates that this is the reason for their gaming channel hiatus\u2014because they have to decide how to continue the channel without them living together now.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt hurts.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt really <i>fucking </i>hurts.\u00a0</p><p>\tAnd it\u2019s all because of him.

He finally decides that he should do this. Not because he wants to. But because he feels like he should now.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe tosses back his blanket and sits up in bed. His mum moves away so he can get up. He grabs his phone on the way and follows her down, the weight of the world making him feel like he could collapse.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\t\u201cWhat are you going to do with your flat?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looks up over the glass of his drink at Martyn and sighs. \u201cDan\u2019s keeping it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSo what are you going to do?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cProbably move out to somewhere else in London.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDo you already have a flat ready?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd why not?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shrugs. He picks up his glass and takes a sip of the eggnog that his mum had poured for him and Martyn just a few moments before that. <br>\n\u00a0\tHe avoids the question by grabbing a cookie from the tin and taking a bite, letting the crumbs fall to the counter top.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMartyn, just\u2026don\u2019t.\u201d Phil says, reaching up and squeezing the bridge of his nose between his fingers.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s a solid question.\u201d Martyn pressed harder. \u201cYou can\u2019t avoid this and put it off.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil, you\u2019ve been broken up with Dan for over a month now.\u201d Martyn says, his words blunt. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect to live with him forever.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSays who.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh come off it, Phil!

When he looks up at Martyn, he can see Martyn is averting his gaze and turning his head away from him.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMartyn,\u201d Phil begins, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m\u2026I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tMartyn nods back at him and stands up, grabbing his own glass. He walks out of the room and Phil is left sitting there with frustrated tears coming to his eyes as he forced himself to hold back.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\t\u201cYou know, I never thought I\u2019d ever experience this.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan is staring across the lake as Adrian sits beside him and Colin runs into the water.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cExperience what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThis break up.\u201d Dan says simply.\u00a0</p><p>\tAdrian turns to him and bites in the corner of his lip. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nodded. \u201cI think I have to.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tAdrian waited and Dan could see he was waiting so he finally spoke again.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI was the one who fucked up.\u201d He says. \u201cAnd I have so much <i>guilt </i>because of it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tAdrian remains sitting quietly.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI literally just\u2026\u201d Dan sighs as he continues. \u201cI just hate what I did. I have to live with seeing Phil every day, looking at me, as he tries to hold back tears. I fucked it up so badly, Adrian. I\u2019m not sure I can ever fix it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThere are tears coming to his eyes and he wipes them away.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDo you want to fix it?\u201d Adrian asks.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nods without hesitation. \u201cI love Phil so much.\u201d He says. \u201cI never wanted to hurt him. I was so <i>stupid </i>and I can\u2019t stop kicking myself over it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Adrian asked, peering out over the lake where Colin was now running through the water again and splashing around.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2026\u201d Dan stops and lets a few tears fall from his eyes as he squeezes them tight. \u201cI slept with a guy that I met online.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s not the fact that he slept with him,\u201d Phil says as he wipes the tears from his cheek, \u201cIt\u2019s the feeling of betrayal.\u201d He tries to hold back a sob in front of his mum, afraid he was upsetting her. But he couldn\u2019t hold back anymore. \u201cWas I not good enough anymore? Did I not give him what he wanted?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh, baby.\u201d His mum cooed, wrapping her arms around him and pulling him to her chest. \u201cSometimes, people do things that hurt.\u201d She said gently. \u201cAnd sometimes you wish and wish and wish you could know why they did what they did. But sometimes, it\u2019s okay to not know. It\u2019s okay to wish and to wonder what happened.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt hurts.\u201d Phil croaked out, letting a sob retch out of his throat as a new fresh dam of tears broke through and soaked his skin. He turned and pressed his face in his mum\u2019s shoulder, hiding it from her view.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know it does.\u201d She says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt for a while. But you\u2019re strong, dear. You\u2019re going to get through this and me, your father, and Martyn will all be standing by you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil sniffled before he let out another pained sob that followed with another round of tears. \u201cI loved him.\u201d Phil manages to get out. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s because I waited so long to propose?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHis mum pulled away and stared into his eyes, her own features going soft. \u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself for the mistakes of others. What Dan did was something he consciously made the decision to do. It has nothing to do with you and there is no reason for you to beat yourself up over it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe sat back on the couch where they were sitting and reached up, wiping the tears from his cheek with the back of his sleeve. When he peers over his mums shoulder, he sees Martyn standing in the doorway, looking down at the floor. He turns his stare away and feels the touch of his mum\u2019s hand on his arm.\u00a0</p><p>\tHis phone buzzes in his pocket and he pulls it out. It\u2019s a text from Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\t<i>Can you talk?\u00a0</i></p><p>****</p><p>\tDan knew it was stupid to text Phil. They\u2019d spoken probably five words to each other in the last week and surely he\u2019s not going to want to speak to him. That\u2019s pretty obvious.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut Phil does answer.\u00a0</p><p>\t<i>Why?\u00a0</i></p><p>\tDan bites his lip to hold back the tears that are already beginning. He\u2019s alone in his childhood room, sitting on the bed like his teenage self used to do, and he\u2019s been hyping himself up to text Phil since he spoke with Adrian.\u00a0</p><p>\t<i>I think we should talk. We haven\u2019t spoken probably.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\t</i>It only takes a few moments for the three bubble to pop up and then disappear or a moment. His heart flips in his chest and then his phone buzzes. <i>Phil Lester would like to Facetime.\u00a0</i></p><p>\tDan quickly reaches for his AirPods and puts them in as he clicks accept and waits for Phil to show up on his screen. When he does, Dan tries to ignore the puffy, clearly bloodshot eyes that Phil has.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHey.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHey.\u201d Phil answers, his voice raspy.\u00a0\t</p><p>\tDan sucks his lips into a straight line. He let\u2019s them go. \u201cHow was your Christmas?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Phil snaps, his voice tight and drawn.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe tone of Phil\u2019s voice catches Dan off guard. He didn\u2019t expect that level of harshness from Phil, but it is warranted. He did fuck up a bunch and Phil has every right to act the way he has been.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil,\u201d Dan begins. \u201cI want you to know that I\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNo.\u201d Phil interrupts him, shaking his head. His eyes glisten and Dan feels the overwhelming feeling of his own tears bubbling up and threatening to spill over. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to do that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what I was going to say.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou were going to say that you still loved me.\u201d Phil says, a clear break in his voice.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan feels the tears spill out his skin and he breathes in a shuttering breath. \u201cBecause I do, Phil. I love you so much.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThen why did you sleep with him?\u201d Phil asks.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan looked away from his phone to stare up at the ceiling. He squeezed his eyes shut, letting a few more tears fall out before he tipped his head back down. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh, well that\u2019s a <i>fucking </i>refreshing answer.\u201d Phil bit out. \u201cYou mean to tell me that you don\u2019t even know why you spread your <i>fucking </i>legs like some\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil stop!\u201d Dan cried out, feeling the sobs catch in his throat. \u201cPlease don\u2019t say that. You don\u2019t mean that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat else do you want me to say?\u201d Phil asked. \u201cYou went out and fucked some guy. <i>You </i>cheated on me. <i>You\u2019re </i>the one who ruined our relationship.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDo you remember what you said to me the night you told me?\u201d Phil continued as Dan struggled to hold back the sobs that were forcing their way out of his mouth as he covered them with his hand. \u201cYou told me that it didn\u2019t mean anything. You said that you never meant to do it. So then why did you? Why did you go out and sleep with him, Dan? Was I not good enough anymore?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil broke at the last word and Dan tried to drown out the sounds of his sobs from his ears. They felt like hundreds of bullets hitting his skin all at the same time. They hurt.\u00a0</p><p>\tBetween them both, they cried until their sobbing drew less and less. By the time Dan got around to answering, his chest hurt and he had a throbbing headache and just wanted to sleep.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWe were just getting back from tour\u2026I was stressed, you were stressed.\u201d Dan stopped and swallowed back any more sobs he was struggling to hold back. \u201cYou and I both know we weren\u2019t good.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSo you went out and found someone else.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s not what happened.\u201d Dan countered. \u201cI never meant to do that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou don\u2019t accidentally fall onto another mans dick.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant!\u201d Dan cried. \u201cYou know I would never hurt you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou hurt me pretty damn bad.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know, and I\u2019ll never have the words to say how sorry I am.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThere is a silence between them.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhen are you going home to the flat?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan looked down at his lap. \u201cTomorrow.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ll be home Friday.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI\u2019ll be packing my things and leaving to stay with Martyn until I find a flat.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan feels his chin wobble. He barely manages out a simple, \u201cOkay.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWe should try and talk to each other\u2026face to face\u2026before I go.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI think we need some closure. It\u2019s clear we\u2019re both in pretty bad shape.\u201d\u00a0\t</p><p>\tDan lets out a chuckle. \u201cWe\u2019re a mess.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil laughs a little bit too.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m gonna go now.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan doesn\u2019t even have time to say anything before Phil hangs up and he\u2019s left staring at a black screen.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe let\u2019s out a sigh and throws his phone on the side of his bed.\u00a0</p><p>\t****</p><p>\tPhil twists his key into the flat, trying to ignore how his heart hurts at how this might be the last time he\u2019ll ever do this.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen he walks in, he notices how everything looks exactly the same\u2014as it should\u2014but also how everything looks so foreign to him as well. This doesn\u2019t look like his flat anymore. It looks like a strange place he\u2019s never been in before.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan is in their lounge. He\u2019s sitting on their couch with his legs crossed and his laptop on his thighs. He doesn\u2019t look up when Phil walks in but Phil knows he needs to talk to him. But the hurt he can feel in his chest as he sees the way Dan\u2019s ignoring any gaze towards him cuts deep.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI packed some of your clothes already.\u201d Dan\u2019s voice says. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t end up doing much.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nods slowly.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe doesn\u2019t want to do this. He doesn\u2019t want to go into their bedroom and pack up his life. He doesn\u2019t want this. This wasn\u2019t how his life was supposed to go. He was supposed to propose to Dan on Christmas. He was supposed to celebrate how happy he was with Dan. They were supposed to be planning a wedding, adopting a dog, and possibly even talking about children.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s not ready to give that all up yet\u2026but he has to.\u00a0</p><p>\tA part of his mind is telling him to just run, but another part is telling him to talk to Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cCan we talk?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThe later wins out.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan looks up and nods. \u201cYeah, I think we should.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil walks over to the couch and takes a seat next to Dan, but still far away where they aren\u2019t touching.\u00a0\t</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t want to do this.\u201d Phil says, shaking his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to move out. I don\u2019t want to pack up my things.\u201d He pauses. \u201cI don\u2019t want to <i>lose </i>you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan pushed his laptop away and sat up straight. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to lose me.\u201d He says. \u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ve already lost you\u2026I lost you the day you decided to sleep with that guy.\u201d\u00a0\t</p><p>\t\u201cYou never lost me.\u201d Dan said, his voice soft.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDon\u2019t make this harder than how it has to be.\u201d Phil says.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou don\u2019t know how much it hurts me,\u201d Dan says. \u201cHow much it actually kills me inside that I did what I did. I was such a <i>fucking </i>idiot. I\u2019ll never forgive myself for it. I\u2019ll never forgive myself for being the reason for your pain and for us ending. You gave me the best ten years of my entire life and I\u2019ll never find someone like you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ll never find someone like you either.\u201d Phil croaks. He reaches up and rubs under his eyes to catch the moisture that is beginning. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever stop loving you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ll never stop loving you.\u201d Dan says. \u201cYou were my first love. You gave me everything I could have ever wanted\u2026and I threw it away.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen Phil finally looks at Dan, he can see Dan\u2019s chin wobbling and his eyes are glassed over, struggling to hold back tears. Without thinking, he reaches out, and places his hand on Dan\u2019s cheek, trying to steady him. Dan leans into the touch as his face scrunches up and tears leak out.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil leans in. He doesn\u2019t know why he does. But he does. And suddenly he\u2019s kissing Dan, feeling the wetness on Dan\u2019s lips from his tears. Dan reciprocates the kiss with no hesitation. They shouldn\u2019t be doing this. They\u2019re meant to be broken up but it happens anyway.\u00a0</p><p>\tAnd before either of them can realize what they\u2019re doing, they\u2019re naked and tangled together on the couch, Dan\u2019s moans filling the room along with the sound of skin against skin. It\u2019s vulgar, and it feels wrong. But at the same time, it feels <i>right.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\t</i>When it\u2019s over, Dan is curled up on their couch, his eyes shut as he falls asleep. Phil takes one look down at him and feels the tears rush down his cheeks again. He gathers his clothing from the floor and re-dresses himself. As Dan\u2019s soft breaths fill into the room, he walks slowly into the bedroom and grabs one of the boxes that Dan has already filled. On the outside in Dan\u2019s chicken-scratch writing, it says \u2018Phils\u2019.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe carries it out of the bedroom and when he walks into the living room, Dan is sitting up on the couch, pulling a shirt on and pulling his pants back on. Phil doesn\u2019t say anything to him, but given the way Dan\u2019s chest is heaving and he\u2019s squeezing his eyes shut says enough.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe opens the door to the flat and walks out, shutting the door behind him. Martyn is stood on the other side, playing on his phone. He looks up at Phil and lets out a sigh. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d He asks gently, putting his arm around Phil\u2019s shoulders.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil just shakes his head, carrying the lone box in his hands. He\u2019s not even sure what clothing of his is packed inside. Martyn gives him a sympathetic look as he removes his arm from around him and takes the box from Phil\u2019s shaking arms.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cLet\u2019s just go sit down for a little bit okay?\u201d Martyn says. \u201cWe can grab the rest later.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil just nods, and wraps his arms around himself as he sniffles and follows Martyn to the elevator.\u00a0</p>",

He tries to pretend that his eyes don&rsquo;t water and his body doesn&rsquo;t feel heavy whenever he says them. But the truth was that he felt as if this was something that he would never be able to get over. It&rsquo;s been nearly a month and he still finds it hard to say those words.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHis mum looks at him. &ldquo;Phil, what do you mean?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil shrugs and looks back down. &ldquo;Exactly what I said.&rdquo; He says with a tinge of edge in his voice. &ldquo;Dan and I broke up&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh, Phil!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tSuddenly his mum is on his side and wrapping a set of arms around him. He feels like this is an acceptable time to let go of a few stray tears. So he lets a few slide down his cheek and drip onto his shirt.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell us?&rdquo; His mum asks carefully.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil shrugs again. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t really wanna talk about it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tHis mum pulled away from him and he turns to face her. Her expression is quite sad, which is another reason why didn&rsquo;t want to say anything to her. He knew she would be upset. He knew she would be disappointed.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Well, are you okay?&rdquo; She asks carefully.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil looks up at her and fakes a smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting there.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; She says, pressing a little bit. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to go through this alone, you know?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil nods. &ldquo;I know, mum.&rdquo; He says. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m okay right now.

He lets his puffy red eyes talk for him.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe thought coming home would make it so it hurt less than being in the apartment with Phil. But it doesn&rsquo;t. It hurts more.&nbsp;</p><p>\tIt hurts more because he misses Phil. He misses him a lot and the worse part about it is that he doesn&rsquo;t miss Phil as a person. He misses Phil&rsquo;s presence and Phil&rsquo;s attention to him.&nbsp;</p><p>\tBut he&rsquo;s fucked up good and now he won&rsquo;t have it anymore come the first of the year&hellip;Phil&rsquo;s already been looking for new flats.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe hates how they had to keep this a secret from their fans. He hates that this is the reason why this was the last Phil is not on fire. He hates that this is the reason for their gaming channel hiatus&mdash;because they have to decide how to continue the channel without them living together now.&nbsp;</p><p>\tIt hurts.&nbsp;</p><p>\tIt really <i>fucking </i>hurts.&nbsp;</p><p>\tAnd it&rsquo;s all because of him. All because he was an asshole&mdash;a stupid <i>fucking </i>asshole.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe hasn&rsquo;t realized that he&rsquo;s not said anything to answer his mum until he opens his eyes and finds her staring at him.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Daniel, please.&rdquo; She pleads. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Christmas morning and you haven&rsquo;t even come down to open your gifts.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure I want them&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Daniel, I know it&rsquo;s been hard but your father and I would really love for you to come down.&rdquo; She pauses. &ldquo;Adrian also has a gift for you that he&rsquo;s really excited for you to open.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan contemplates her words and lets them comb around in his head. He finally decides that he should do this. Not because he wants to. But because he feels like he should now.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe tosses back his blanket and sits up in bed. His mum moves away so he can get up. He grabs his phone on the way and follows her down, the weight of the world making him feel like he could collapse.&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>\t&ldquo;What are you going to do with your flat?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil looks up over the glass of his drink at Martyn and sighs. &ldquo;Dan&rsquo;s keeping it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;So what are you going to do?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Probably move out to somewhere else in London.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Do you already have a flat ready?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil shook his head. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil shrugs. He picks up his glass and takes a sip of the eggnog that his mum had poured for him and Martyn just a few moments before that. <br />\n&nbsp;\tHe avoids the question by grabbing a cookie from the tin and taking a bite, letting the crumbs fall to the counter top.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Phil&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Martyn, just&hellip;don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Phil says, reaching up and squeezing the bridge of his nose between his fingers.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a solid question.&rdquo; Martyn pressed harder. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t avoid this and put it off.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Phil, you&rsquo;ve been broken up with Dan for over a month now.&rdquo; Martyn says, his words blunt. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t expect to live with him forever.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Says who.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh come off it, Phil! That&rsquo;s ridiculous and <i>you </i>know it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Can you just shut up for a second!&rdquo; Phil snaps.&nbsp;</p><p>\tThe room around them is so quiet you could hear a pin drop and the air was so thick he could feel it. When he looks up at Martyn, he can see Martyn is averting his gaze and turning his head away from him.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Martyn,&rdquo; Phil begins, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry. I&rsquo;m&hellip;I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tMartyn nods back at him and stands up, grabbing his own glass. He walks out of the room and Phil is left sitting there with frustrated tears coming to his eyes as he forced himself to hold back.&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>\t&ldquo;You know, I never thought I&rsquo;d ever experience this.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan is staring across the lake as Adrian sits beside him and Colin runs into the water.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Experience what?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;This break up.&rdquo; Dan says simply.&nbsp;</p><p>\tAdrian turns to him and bites in the corner of his lip. &ldquo;Do you want to talk about it?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan nodded. &ldquo;I think I have to.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tAdrian waited and Dan could see he was waiting so he finally spoke again.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I was the one who fucked up.&rdquo; He says. &ldquo;And I have so much <i>guilt </i>because of it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tAdrian remains sitting quietly.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I literally just&hellip;&rdquo; Dan sighs as he continues. &ldquo;I just hate what I did. I have to live with seeing Phil every day, looking at me, as he tries to hold back tears. I fucked it up so badly, Adrian. I&rsquo;m not sure I can ever fix it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tThere are tears coming to his eyes and he wipes them away.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Do you want to fix it?&rdquo; Adrian asks.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan nods without hesitation. &ldquo;I love Phil so much.&rdquo; He says. &ldquo;I never wanted to hurt him. I was so <i>stupid </i>and I can&rsquo;t stop kicking myself over it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; Adrian asked, peering out over the lake where Colin was now running through the water again and splashing around.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Dan stops and lets a few tears fall from his eyes as he squeezes them tight. &ldquo;I slept with a guy that I met online.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the fact that he slept with him,&rdquo; Phil says as he wipes the tears from his cheek, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the feeling of betrayal.&rdquo; He tries to hold back a sob in front of his mum, afraid he was upsetting her. But he couldn&rsquo;t hold back anymore. &ldquo;Was I not good enough anymore? Did I not give him what he wanted?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh, baby.&rdquo; His mum cooed, wrapping her arms around him and pulling him to her chest. &ldquo;Sometimes, people do things that hurt.&rdquo; She said gently. &ldquo;And sometimes you wish and wish and wish you could know why they did what they did. But sometimes, it&rsquo;s okay to not know. It&rsquo;s okay to wish and to wonder what happened.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;It hurts.&rdquo; Phil croaked out, letting a sob retch out of his throat as a new fresh dam of tears broke through and soaked his skin. He turned and pressed his face in his mum&rsquo;s shoulder, hiding it from her view.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I know it does.&rdquo; She says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to hurt for a while. But you&rsquo;re strong, dear. You&rsquo;re going to get through this and me, your father, and Martyn will all be standing by you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil sniffled before he let out another pained sob that followed with another round of tears. &ldquo;I loved him.&rdquo; Phil manages to get out. &ldquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s because I waited so long to propose?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tHis mum pulled away and stared into his eyes, her own features going soft. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame yourself for the mistakes of others. What Dan did was something he consciously made the decision to do. It has nothing to do with you and there is no reason for you to beat yourself up over it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe sat back on the couch where they were sitting and reached up, wiping the tears from his cheek with the back of his sleeve. When he peers over his mums shoulder, he sees Martyn standing in the doorway, looking down at the floor. He turns his stare away and feels the touch of his mum&rsquo;s hand on his arm.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHis phone buzzes in his pocket and he pulls it out. It&rsquo;s a text from Dan.&nbsp;</p><p>\t<i>Can you talk?&nbsp;</i></p><p>****</p><p>\tDan knew it was stupid to text Phil. They&rsquo;d spoken probably five words to each other in the last week and surely he&rsquo;s not going to want to speak to him. That&rsquo;s pretty obvious.&nbsp;</p><p>\tBut Phil does answer.&nbsp;</p><p>\t<i>Why?&nbsp;</i></p><p>\tDan bites his lip to hold back the tears that are already beginning. He&rsquo;s alone in his childhood room, sitting on the bed like his teenage self used to do, and he&rsquo;s been hyping himself up to text Phil since he spoke with Adrian.&nbsp;</p><p>\t<i>I think we should talk. We haven&rsquo;t spoken probably.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>\t</i>It only takes a few moments for the three bubble to pop up and then disappear or a moment. His heart flips in his chest and then his phone buzzes. <i>Phil Lester would like to Facetime.&nbsp;</i></p><p>\tDan quickly reaches for his AirPods and puts them in as he clicks accept and waits for Phil to show up on his screen. When he does, Dan tries to ignore the puffy, clearly bloodshot eyes that Phil has.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; Phil answers, his voice raspy.&nbsp;\t</p><p>\tDan sucks his lips into a straight line. He let&rsquo;s them go. &ldquo;How was your Christmas?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; Phil snaps, his voice tight and drawn.&nbsp;</p><p>\tThe tone of Phil&rsquo;s voice catches Dan off guard. He didn&rsquo;t expect that level of harshness from Phil, but it is warranted. He did fuck up a bunch and Phil has every right to act the way he has been.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Phil,&rdquo; Dan begins. &ldquo;I want you to know that I&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Phil interrupts him, shaking his head. His eyes glisten and Dan feels the overwhelming feeling of his own tears bubbling up and threatening to spill over. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get to do that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even know what I was going to say.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You were going to say that you still loved me.&rdquo; Phil says, a clear break in his voice.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan feels the tears spill out his skin and he breathes in a shuttering breath. &ldquo;Because I do, Phil. I love you so much.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Then why did you sleep with him?&rdquo; Phil asks.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan looked away from his phone to stare up at the ceiling. He squeezed his eyes shut, letting a few more tears fall out before he tipped his head back down. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh, well that&rsquo;s a <i>fucking </i>refreshing answer.&rdquo; Phil bit out. &ldquo;You mean to tell me that you don&rsquo;t even know why you spread your <i>fucking </i>legs like some&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Phil stop!&rdquo; Dan cried out, feeling the sobs catch in his throat. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t say that. You don&rsquo;t mean that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What else do you want me to say?&rdquo; Phil asked. &ldquo;You went out and fucked some guy. <i>You </i>cheated on me. <i>You&rsquo;re </i>the one who ruined our relationship.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Do you remember what you said to me the night you told me?&rdquo; Phil continued as Dan struggled to hold back the sobs that were forcing their way out of his mouth as he covered them with his hand. &ldquo;You told me that it didn&rsquo;t mean anything. You said that you never meant to do it. So then why did you? Why did you go out and sleep with him, Dan? Was I not good enough anymore?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil broke at the last word and Dan tried to drown out the sounds of his sobs from his ears. They felt like hundreds of bullets hitting his skin all at the same time. They hurt.&nbsp;</p><p>\tBetween them both, they cried until their sobbing drew less and less. By the time Dan got around to answering, his chest hurt and he had a throbbing headache and just wanted to sleep.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;We were just getting back from tour&hellip;I was stressed, you were stressed.&rdquo; Dan stopped and swallowed back any more sobs he was struggling to hold back. &ldquo;You and I both know we weren&rsquo;t good.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;So you went out and found someone else.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what happened.&rdquo; Dan countered. &ldquo;I never meant to do that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t accidentally fall onto another mans dick.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I meant!&rdquo; Dan cried. &ldquo;You know I would never hurt you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You hurt me pretty damn bad.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I know, and I&rsquo;ll never have the words to say how sorry I am.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tThere is a silence between them.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;When are you going home to the flat?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan looked down at his lap. &ldquo;Tomorrow.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be home Friday.&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be packing my things and leaving to stay with Martyn until I find a flat.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan feels his chin wobble. He barely manages out a simple, &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;We should try and talk to each other&hellip;face to face&hellip;before I go.&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;I think we need some closure. It&rsquo;s clear we&rsquo;re both in pretty bad shape.&rdquo;&nbsp;\t</p><p>\tDan lets out a chuckle. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a mess.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil laughs a little bit too.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna go now.&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you later.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan doesn&rsquo;t even have time to say anything before Phil hangs up and he&rsquo;s left staring at a black screen.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe let&rsquo;s out a sigh and throws his phone on the side of his bed.&nbsp;</p><p>\t****</p><p>\tPhil twists his key into the flat, trying to ignore how his heart hurts at how this might be the last time he&rsquo;ll ever do this.&nbsp;</p><p>\tWhen he walks in, he notices how everything looks exactly the same&mdash;as it should&mdash;but also how everything looks so foreign to him as well. This doesn&rsquo;t look like his flat anymore. It looks like a strange place he&rsquo;s never been in before.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan is in their lounge. He&rsquo;s sitting on their couch with his legs crossed and his laptop on his thighs. He doesn&rsquo;t look up when Phil walks in but Phil knows he needs to talk to him. But the hurt he can feel in his chest as he sees the way Dan&rsquo;s ignoring any gaze towards him cuts deep.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I packed some of your clothes already.&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s voice says. &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t end up doing much.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil nods slowly.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe doesn&rsquo;t want to do this. He doesn&rsquo;t want to go into their bedroom and pack up his life. He doesn&rsquo;t want this. This wasn&rsquo;t how his life was supposed to go. He was supposed to propose to Dan on Christmas. He was supposed to celebrate how happy he was with Dan. They were supposed to be planning a wedding, adopting a dog, and possibly even talking about children.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe&rsquo;s not ready to give that all up yet&hellip;but he has to.&nbsp;</p><p>\tA part of his mind is telling him to just run, but another part is telling him to talk to Dan.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Can we talk?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tThe later wins out.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan looks up and nods. &ldquo;Yeah, I think we should.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil walks over to the couch and takes a seat next to Dan, but still far away where they aren&rsquo;t touching.&nbsp;\t</p><p>\t&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to do this.&rdquo; Phil says, shaking his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to move out. I don&rsquo;t want to pack up my things.&rdquo; He pauses. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to <i>lose </i>you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan pushed his laptop away and sat up straight. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to lose me.&rdquo; He says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m right here.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already lost you&hellip;I lost you the day you decided to sleep with that guy.&rdquo;&nbsp;\t</p><p>\t&ldquo;You never lost me.&rdquo; Dan said, his voice soft.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make this harder than how it has to be.&rdquo; Phil says.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how much it hurts me,&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;How much it actually kills me inside that I did what I did. I was such a <i>fucking </i>idiot. I&rsquo;ll never forgive myself for it. I&rsquo;ll never forgive myself for being the reason for your pain and for us ending. You gave me the best ten years of my entire life and I&rsquo;ll never find someone like you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never find someone like you either.&rdquo; Phil croaks. He reaches up and rubs under his eyes to catch the moisture that is beginning. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever stop loving you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never stop loving you.&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;You were my first love. You gave me everything I could have ever wanted&hellip;and I threw it away.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tWhen Phil finally looks at Dan, he can see Dan&rsquo;s chin wobbling and his eyes are glassed over, struggling to hold back tears. Without thinking, he reaches out, and places his hand on Dan&rsquo;s cheek, trying to steady him. Dan leans into the touch as his face scrunches up and tears leak out.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil leans in. He doesn&rsquo;t know why he does. But he does. And suddenly he&rsquo;s kissing Dan, feeling the wetness on Dan&rsquo;s lips from his tears. Dan reciprocates the kiss with no hesitation. They shouldn&rsquo;t be doing this. They&rsquo;re meant to be broken up but it happens anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>\tAnd before either of them can realize what they&rsquo;re doing, they&rsquo;re naked and tangled together on the couch, Dan&rsquo;s moans filling the room along with the sound of skin against skin. It&rsquo;s vulgar, and it feels wrong. But at the same time, it feels <i>right.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>\t</i>When it&rsquo;s over, Dan is curled up on their couch, his eyes shut as he falls asleep. Phil takes one look down at him and feels the tears rush down his cheeks again. He gathers his clothing from the floor and re-dresses himself. As Dan&rsquo;s soft breaths fill into the room, he walks slowly into the bedroom and grabs one of the boxes that Dan has already filled. On the outside in Dan&rsquo;s chicken-scratch writing, it says &lsquo;Phils&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe carries it out of the bedroom and when he walks into the living room, Dan is sitting up on the couch, pulling a shirt on and pulling his pants back on. Phil doesn&rsquo;t say anything to him, but given the way Dan&rsquo;s chest is heaving and he&rsquo;s squeezing his eyes shut says enough.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe opens the door to the flat and walks out, shutting the door behind him. Martyn is stood on the other side, playing on his phone. He looks up at Phil and lets out a sigh. &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; He asks gently, putting his arm around Phil&rsquo;s shoulders.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil just shakes his head, carrying the lone box in his hands. He&rsquo;s not even sure what clothing of his is packed inside. Martyn gives him a sympathetic look as he removes his arm from around him and takes the box from Phil&rsquo;s shaking arms.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just go sit down for a little bit okay?&rdquo; Martyn says. &ldquo;We can grab the rest later.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil just nods, and wraps his arms around himself as he sniffles and follows Martyn to the elevator.&nbsp;</p>",
