Like, why? But then again, we all&nbsp;*know* why.&#128064;</p>\n\n<p>This belies one clear fact: Arya truly trusts Jon and she will judge Dany for herself. Some of you guys really give Arya very little credit in this regard. I think we will see a much closer bond with these two in S8 with Maisie fondly describing Jon/Arya&rsquo;s friendship in a recent interview recapping the whole series that was released last week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This fact is increased evermore so with the news from <b>Maisie that her S8 storyline will be reminiscent of her S1 storyline where we first saw her bond with Jon highlighted so beautifully.</b> S1 also had no Kill List or Faceless Men arcs so we should be prepared to see those elements in her story fall away and no longer matter as much to her. </p><p>After reading the scripts, in a Jan 2018 interview, <b>Maisie said her greatest hope for Arya is to see her let go of her anger and quest for vengeance and find peace</b>. She later said she got to do everything she wanted to do for Arya in S8 and exhausted every aspect of her character. Maisie had to rewatch S1 and she plotted out the beginning, middle and end of Arya&rsquo;s S8 storyline &ndash; so it seems she has much to do! Maisie admitted as much when she was on Jimmy Kimmel and then again in her more recent Guardian interview saying<b> she had more to do in S8 than any prior season of Game of Thrones. That&rsquo;s very telling! </b></p><p>Plus, the more keen observers who noted how closely inline Kit and Maisie&rsquo;s filming schedules were this year, with those two filming the most consistently since Nov 2017 to July 2018, wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if Arya/Jon have an even stronger bond than *some* people are dreading. According to WoTW new article: &nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><b>\n&ldquo;They spent 10 months filming six episodes of television, which would normally take about two months. That&rsquo;s pretty crazy. And a lot of that wasn&rsquo;t the big battle stuff, but the regular scenes of two people talking in a hallway,&rdquo; he clarifies\"</b>.&nbsp;- James Hibberd, Entertainment Weekly writer. He visited the S8 set twice during filming. According to his IG, he was on the S8 set in Belfast: Moneyglass location (The huge Winterfell set) early March. He also saw a very important E6 scene being filmed and he was shocked at who was still there by the end of the season. I&rsquo;ll talk more about this in a new post!\n</p></blockquote><p>Arya avenged the Red Wedding in S6/S7 and I think she would take the threat of the NK and the Army of the Dead far more seriously right now (over some politics) and understand where Jon is coming from. Not once have the writers ever shown Arya doubt Jon leading up to their long awaited reunion. If that was their plan, in S7 at least, the writers would have introduced some hint of Arya questioning Jon&rsquo;s motives or even have her see Sansa&rsquo;s POV with some merit. Arya has never done that and I doubt she&rsquo;ll start in S8. In fact, the opposite has happened with Arya *supporting* Jon while the rest of the Lords/Sansa continued to doubt him.</p><p>Sansa knows for a fact (as all the viewers do) that Arya would always choose Jon.</p></p>",
