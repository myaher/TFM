        "answer": "<p>this is so good and i appreciate you so much right now</p><p>(this is basically vox machina as pirates and percy&rsquo;s story still being pretty much the same tbh)</p><p>~</p><p>It&rsquo;s been about two weeks since they fished the kid out of the water. He would have drowned if they hadn&rsquo;t, and even so, Pike had to use a good portion of her healing for the day to stabilize him.</p><p>Scanlan still feels slightly nauseous at the memory of the wounds he only caught a glimpse of before Pike ordered them all to get the fuck out of the cabin and make themselves useful.</p><p>Whatever happened to the boy must have been a nightmare. It makes sense that he&rsquo;s barely talking now and that even Scanlan hasn&rsquo;t been able to get him to smile.</p><p>The twins, who are the closest to his age, though probably at least a little bit older, have taken it upon themselves to show their new crew member the ropes.</p><p>Despite everything, Percival is eager to make himself useful.</p><p>Except that he&hellip; well, he kinda sucks at this. He admits one night that he&rsquo;s never sailed on a ship before, which they could all tell from a mile away already. And while he does have some impressive muscles, he still looks every inch the sheltered noble kid that Scanlan imagines he used to be.</p><p>&ldquo;I used to be&hellip; somewhat of a tinkerer,&rdquo; Percy tells them after almost an entire Grog-sized mug of ale. &ldquo;I invented things. I&rsquo;m normally very good with my hands, it&rsquo;s just that they&rsquo;re used to working on a much smaller scale.&rdquo;</p><p>That makes a lot more sense. Percy, leaning over a workbench and fiddling with tiny gears and screws&hellip; yeah, that&rsquo;s exactly the kind of vibe he gives off.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get the hang of this soon, darling,&rdquo; Vex'ahlia promises with a smile, &ldquo;It took us all some getting used to.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s practically got stars in her eyes as she winks at Percival, and Scanlan catches Vax&rsquo;s eye and they both roll their eyes. They&rsquo;re used to Vex&rsquo;s flirting by now. The only one on board who used to be of interest to her is Keyleth. But after a couple months of dancing around each other, they suddenly decided to just be friends.</p><p>&ldquo;Was the sex that bad?&rdquo; Scanlan asked Keyleth when he caught her alone.</p><p>Keyleth went beet red and shrugged. &ldquo;No. It wasn&rsquo;t&hellip; it was good&hellip; I mean&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Scanlan interruptee her with a raised hand and patted her shoulder - even though he had to stretch a little to reach it.</p><p>That evening, he played cheesy romantic songs until Vex threatened to throw his lute overboard.</p><p>Now though, there&rsquo;s nothing but friendship between her and Keyleth, and their resident druid watches her try to seduce Percy with the same interest as the rest of the crew.</p><p>Percy looks pretty uncomfortable though. He always kind of does, which is understandable since he&rsquo;s only been here for two weeks, but still.</p><p>Scanlan leans forward. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re a clever kid, then. More brains than brawn?&rdquo;</p><p>Percy gives him a half glare. &ldquo;Not a kid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one not giving us your age,&rdquo; Scanlan replies with a shrug.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re one to talk, Shorthalt,&rdquo; Vax murmurs, but Scanlan skillfully ignores him.</p><p>&ldquo;Anyway. Back to my point. This whole operation needs some more clever people. Right now we&rsquo;ve got me&hellip; and maybe Kiki over there, but she&rsquo;s only smart in non-people related ways.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which is your specialty,&rdquo; Percy adds with a nod.</p><p>Scanlan smirks. &ldquo;I doubt Pike keeps me around solely for my good looks.&rdquo;</p><p>He dodges the half eaten apple Pike throws his way and grins.</p><p>&ldquo;But you know, Percival&hellip; I&rsquo;m kind of the mastermind behind our work.&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s a couple of snorts, but no one actually disagrees. Which, great, Scanlan&rsquo;s ego can&rsquo;t use more of that right now.</p><p>&ldquo;I pick the cities we attack. The trade routes we intercept. I use the information we gather to keep us well fed and out of jail.&rdquo; The pride in his voice isn&rsquo;t played up this time, and he grins when Percy gives him an impressed nod.</p><p>Scanlan leans back on his bench and lets a silver coin dance along his fingers. &ldquo;As you see, not every crew member has to be good at the physical side of things. Maybe you&rsquo;d be better off becoming my&hellip; apprentice.&rdquo; He lets the coin disappear - not with magic, but with a simple trick Dr. Dranzel taught him years ago. </p><p>Percy looks to Pike, who shrugs. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t hurt to try. Honestly, it&rsquo;s better than you getting in the way on deck.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; Percy straightens up. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got yourself a deal.&rdquo;</p><p>Scanlan&rsquo;s grin widens. &ldquo;Tell me, Percival, have you ever forged a signature?&rdquo;</p><p>Percy pauses for a moment, then smiles. &ldquo;Not for anything serious but I&rsquo;m always eager for new opportunities.&rdquo;</p><p>~</p><p>Three years later, their crew is the most feared along the coast of Tal'Dorei and beyond.</p><p>Mostly because Percival, the crazy bastard, equipped the ship with an invention of his - cannons.

But after a couple months of dancing around each other, they suddenly decided to just be friends.</p><p>&ldquo;Was the sex that bad?&rdquo; Scanlan asked Keyleth when he caught her alone.</p><p>Keyleth went beet red and shrugged. &ldquo;No. It wasn&rsquo;t&hellip; it was good&hellip; I mean&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Scanlan interruptee her with a raised hand and patted her shoulder - even though he had to stretch a little to reach it.</p><p>That evening, he played cheesy romantic songs until Vex threatened to throw his lute overboard.</p><p>Now though, there&rsquo;s nothing but friendship between her and Keyleth, and their resident druid watches her try to seduce Percy with the same interest as the rest of the crew.</p><p>Percy looks pretty uncomfortable though. He always kind of does, which is understandable since he&rsquo;s only been here for two weeks, but still.</p><p>Scanlan leans forward. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re a clever kid, then. More brains than brawn?&rdquo;</p><p>Percy gives him a half glare. &ldquo;Not a kid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one not giving us your age,&rdquo; Scanlan replies with a shrug.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re one to talk, Shorthalt,&rdquo; Vax murmurs, but Scanlan skillfully ignores him.</p><p>&ldquo;Anyway. Back to my point. This whole operation needs some more clever people. Right now we&rsquo;ve got me&hellip; and maybe Kiki over there, but she&rsquo;s only smart in non-people related ways.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which is your specialty,&rdquo; Percy adds with a nod.</p><p>Scanlan smirks. &ldquo;I doubt Pike keeps me around solely for my good looks.&rdquo;</p><p>He dodges the half eaten apple Pike throws his way and grins.</p><p>&ldquo;But you know, Percival&hellip; I&rsquo;m kind of the mastermind behind our work.&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s a couple of snorts, but no one actually disagrees. Which, great, Scanlan&rsquo;s ego can&rsquo;t use more of that right now.</p><p>&ldquo;I pick the cities we attack. The trade routes we intercept. I use the information we gather to keep us well fed and out of jail.&rdquo; The pride in his voice isn&rsquo;t played up this time, and he grins when Percy gives him an impressed nod.</p><p>Scanlan leans back on his bench and lets a silver coin dance along his fingers. &ldquo;As you see, not every crew member has to be good at the physical side of things. Maybe you&rsquo;d be better off becoming my&hellip; apprentice.&rdquo; He lets the coin disappear - not with magic, but with a simple trick Dr. Dranzel taught him years ago. </p><p>Percy looks to Pike, who shrugs. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t hurt to try. Honestly, it&rsquo;s better than you getting in the way on deck.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; Percy straightens up. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got yourself a deal.&rdquo;</p><p>Scanlan&rsquo;s grin widens. &ldquo;Tell me, Percival, have you ever forged a signature?&rdquo;</p><p>Percy pauses for a moment, then smiles. &ldquo;Not for anything serious but I&rsquo;m always eager for new opportunities.&rdquo;</p><p>~</p><p>Three years later, their crew is the most feared along the coast of Tal'Dorei and beyond.</p><p>Mostly because Percival, the crazy bastard, equipped the ship with an invention of his - cannons. No one can withstand those hellish weapons for long. They could take down entire fleets if they wished to do so.</p><p>And Scanlan? Scanlan thinks that this whole dangerous side to Percy, the way his passion and focus win them one battle after another, is really fucking hot.</p><p>It takes him a while to decide whether seducing Percy is worth letting his lute be flung to an early, watery grave.</p><p>Vex does get to him first, in the end.</p><p>But this crew has never been much for exclusivity.</p><p>Scanlan looks down at Percy&rsquo;s sleeping face and then leans back in Vex&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;You know we&rsquo;re gonna have to deal with his shit eventually?&rdquo;</p><p>Vex sighs and brushes a strand of white hair out of Percy&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be worth it. Right?&rdquo;</p><p>Scanlan watches as Percy scrunches up his face and nods. He reaches for Vex&rsquo;s hand and presses a kiss to her knuckles. &ldquo;Yeah, I think so.&rdquo;</p>",
