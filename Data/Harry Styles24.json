        "answer": "<p><b>Author\u2019s Note</b> - basically, I\u2019m an idiot who, whilst trying to sort out my Masterlist, accidentally deleted this one and I am gutted because you guys had posted some really lovely comments and now they\u2019re gone - so I am actually really sad! Anyway, without further ado, here it is again!</p><p>So, basically, I received two requests at a similar time \u2014 and I don\u2019t like letting people down and cheating my way out of prompts by only doing one request. Another anon requested Number 18 \u2014 but left it up to me to decide which section to choose from, so I really hope you don\u2019t mind but I have incorporated these two \u2014 <b>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d</b> and <b>\u201cDon\u2019t come yet,\u201d</b> \u2014 but in two different parts, (with part two is still in the process of being written). It\u2019s been a piece that I\u2019ve played in my mind over and over again and these prompts gave me a good enough excuse to write and post it, so I <i>really</i> hope I\u2019ve done it justice for you both! So here\u2019s part one (and 4K of husband!harry)! And of course, stay tuned for part two!</p><p><b>Just a slight warning that this one contains sensitive material surrounding difficulties in falling pregnant and also brief mentions of phantom pregnancies, so please do not read this if you are or will be affected \u2014 and my ask box is always open if you want to talk!</b></p><p><b>Someday.</b></p><p>Spending a Bank Holiday at Anne\u2019s was becoming somewhat of a tradition for you as a couple, and this Spring holiday was no different. Having packed up the car on the previous Friday afternoon, you and Harry had travelled up to Holmes Chapel to spend the long weekend at your husband\u2019s childhood home with his family.</p><p>You had awoken, in his childhood bedroom, to the aromas of food cooking in the kitchen, knowing full well that, despite no longer having to make the effort and impress anyone, Anne would still be providing a breakfast spread.</p><p>As expected, once you were up, ready and headed downstairs, you were met with an array of delicious foods \u2014 a variety of cereals with cold milk, fresh and tinned fruits, croissants, yoghurts, hot toast and butter, quality meats from the local butcher that Harry constantly raved about, eggs, \u2014 scrambled and fried \u2014 and different juices including pineapple, orange and mango. The breakfast buffet before you felt as though you were in a five star hotel as opposed to your husband\u2019s family home, but nonetheless, you always appreciated Anne\u2019s efforts at welcoming guests into her home.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Harry\u2019s raspy voice appears as you pour your orange juice into a glass.</p><p>You turn around to see your husband exiting the lounge through the patio doors. He stops to greet his mother, giving her a kiss on the cheek, before coming to stand behind you. He rests a hand on your hip, dropping a kiss to your jawline from behind, as a low growl leaves the base of his throat.</p><p>\u201cMorning, wifey,\u201d he murmurs.</p><p>\u201cGet a room, you two,\u201d Gemma smirks, as she too, joins you all in the garden, closely followed by Michal. \u201cI mean, you\u2019ve been married, what \u2014 three months,\u201d she shrugs, \u201cThought you\u2019d have got it out of your system by now,\u201d she laughs.</p><p>\u201cFour, actually,\u201d Harry clarifies with a smirk, draping an arm around your shoulder as you pour him a pineapple juice and hand it to him. \u201cFour months, and two days,\u201d he specifies, waggling his ring finger in front of his sister as he takes a sip of the freshly squeezed fruit.</p><p>\u201cYoung love,\u201d Anne beams. \u201cCould\u2019ve at least put a shirt on though, Mister!\u201d she laughs, noticing his half naked body as he seats himself on the black and white checked gingham garden furniture \u2014 a set that Harry had bought his mum for Christmas one year, despite the fact that it wouldn\u2019t come in handy until summertime when the weather would get warmer and the nights would become longer.</p><p>Harry shrugs, \u201c\u2019s why she married, for all this,\u201d he gestures towards his ink covered body.</p><p>You blush at his comment, and although it was no secret that his body art was one of the many reasons you found yourself sexually attracted to him, you had both embarked on a romantic relationship where you love each other, focussing on making each other happy, supporting each other and respecting the others\u2019 boundaries, and working together to become best friends, lovers, soulmates, and equals.</p><p>\u201cJust ignore him,\u201d Gemma smirks. \u201cHe\u2019s all mouth and no trousers,\u201d she adds.</p><p>\u201cExactly my point, that\u2019s why she married me,\u201d he jokes once more.</p><p>Your cheeks continue to flush a deeper shade of red, and Harry rests a hand on your thigh, whispering a quick, \u201c\u2018m sorry, lovie, but we both know it\u2019s true,\u201d with a smirk \u2014 and luckily for you, his comment is out of ear shot from everyone else, which you\u2019re only too grateful for because you\u2019re not sure you could handle any more embarrassment.</p><p>Within seconds, the conversation easily flows and takes a different direction. Anne discusses the weekend weather and her plans for the following week, whilst Gemma talks about her most recent article focusing on feminism, educating everyone on issues for girls around the world, something that everyone listened intently to, and as expected, Harry barely reveals any information regarding the next album.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a minute,\u201d Gemma suddenly says, with a smile as she takes herself back into the house, leaving you and Harry to reminisce over your honeymoon \u2014 which despite the fact that it finished three months ago, you still couldn\u2019t help talking about the amazing adventures you\u2019d experienced together in your newlywed lifestyle.</p><p>\u201cIt was just nice having the pool to ourselves, and the food \u2014\u201d Harry practically drools as he thinks back to the Greek cuisine. \u201cThe food was<i> amazing</i>!\u201d he sighs, eyes rolling as he seriously contemplates packing the car up, driving to the airport and flying you both back to Greece for an extended holiday.</p><p>\u201cThe food was really good,\u201d you agree, \u201cBut the beaches were to die for though,\u201d you smile, adding to the complimentary comments of the country you\u2019d visited together. \u201cThey were so sandy and beautiful, it was just so peaceful,\u201d you tell the other two adults in front of you who listen attentively, before Gemma reappears once again, skipping out of the patio doors.</p><p>\u201cHappy Easter,\u201d she smiles, as she excitedly hands each of you a boxed chocolate egg. She gives Michal a knowing smile, regaining her position on her chair beside him and barely giving any of you the opportunity to express your gratitude, before she states, \u201cIt\u2019s from the three of us,\u201d with a squeal.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cOh thanks, Gem,\u201d Anne\u2019s voice begins.</p><p>Harry\u2019s hand finds your thigh once again, giving you a reassuring squeeze. With his other arm slung around the back of your chair, his fingertips quickly dance on your shoulder, the thin strap to your floral summer dress giving him easy access to your bare skin. You can feel a lump form at the base of your throat as you watch Harry give you a sympathetic look from the corner of your eye as you comprehend your sister-in-law\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Anne begins, the realisation of the conversation only just dawning, \u201cthe three of \u2014 what \u2014 wait, you\u2019re pregnant?\u201d the older woman asks, her smile beaming as she removes her sunglasses from her face, pushing them up into her hair. </p><p>\u201c<b>I\u2019m pregnant</b>,\u201d Gemma confirms, resting a hand on her stomach. \u201cTwelves weeks,\u201d she clarifies.</p><p>\u201cOh my goodness, Gemma! Congratulations!\u201d Anne\u2019s voice chirps as she stands from her chair and shuffles her feet to the other side of the table. Pulling her daughter into her, she gives her a kiss on the cheek. \u201cOh, I\u2019m so happy for you both!\u201d she exclaims, before pressing a peck to Michal\u2019s cheek, too.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Harry smiles, leaning forwards in his chair and reaching across the table to shake Michal\u2019s hand, before giving his sister a small nod. \u201cI\u2019m really happy for you,\u201d he adds, his smile genuine as his sister quite literally glows with happiness.</p><p>\u201cYeah, congratulations to you both,\u201d you murmur softly, desperately hoping that the smile you display to the family before you is a genuine one, but with your voice laced with sadness, you\u2019re not even sure you\u2019ve convinced yourself, let alone everyone around you.</p><p>Gemma smiles, still giddy after revealing her exciting news, \u201cYou could at least seem happy,\u201d she jokes lightheartedly, \u201cI mean, you look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost,\u201d she notes your obviously distracted expression.</p><p>You force another smile as you sense Harry\u2019s burning gaze on you, him watching you vigilantly as his hand reaches for your own underneath table. He interlocks his fingers with yours, comfortingly intertwining them, his thumb occasionally skimming your skin.</p><p>\u201cNo really, I\u2019m happy for you \u2014 for both of you,\u201d you clarify.</p><p>Your answer seems to satisfy the young female, who\u2019s features resembles a lot of your husband\u2019s, and her bubbly self continues to express her enthusiasm at the happy situation. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the twelve week scan already,\u201d she murmurs, \u201chere,\u201d she gestures towards Michal as her long term partner delves into his back pocket for his leather wallet.</p><p>\u201cLook, there\u2019s it\u2019s fingers, and there\u2019s it toes \u2014\u201d Michal proudly displays the ultrasound picture and points out the baby\u2019s body parts. With his permission, Anne takes it from him, looking at the scan of her first Grandchild in awe as her fingertips trace over the glossy paper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a second,\u201d you whisper softly to Harry, pulling your hand away from his and standing from your spot. You enter the house through the opened patio doors, leaving your husband and his family in the garden as you head upstairs and away from the clearly difficult situation.</p><p>\u201cIs she ok?\u201d Anne looks up and asks her son at your sudden departure.</p><p>\u201c\u2018m just goin\u2019 to check on her,\u201d Harry murmurs softly, before giving his sister a small smile \u2014 one that appears apologetic yet also indicates that he really is happy for both her and Michal with the good news that they had shared.</p><p>Heading up the stairs of his childhood home, he runs a hand over his face and steadies his breath. Upon reaching the bathroom door, he unmistakably hears your soft sniffles and it tears at his heart strings. Lightly tapping on the door that acts as a barrier between you, his soft voice murmurs, \u201cSweetheart, it\u2019s me,\u201d confirming your suspicions that your husband would of course follow you in your time of distress.</p><p>He\u2019s met with a deafening silence and he knows you\u2019re preventing the sobs you\u2019re holding back from escaping your lips, and that only shatters his heart further.</p><p>\u201cDarling, please let me in,\u201d he begs. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, I\u2019m fine. Go back downstairs \u2014 I\u2019ll be out in a minute,\u201d you assure him.</p><p>He sighs heavily, licking his lips. \u201cDarling, open the door,\u201d he simply states. You should know by now that he wouldn\u2019t leave you alone, especially when you\u2019re crying \u2014 God, he really hates it when you cry \u2014 and you know there\u2019s no point in arguing against him. The moment his hand rests upon the doorknob, he hears you unlocking it from the inside.</p><p>He emits a sigh of relief, grateful that you\u2019ll allow him to comfort you in your time of need.</p><p>\u201cHey, angel,\u201d he murmurs softly, as he enters the bathroom. \u201cOh sweetheart,\u201d he breathes, as he takes in your demeanour. You\u2019re sat on the edge of the bath, your cheeks blotchy and your eyes red and puffy from the crying, as the taste of salt lingers on your lips.</p><p>\u201c\u2018m sorry,\u201d you mumble, wiping away the tears with the back of your hand.</p><p>Locking the door behind him, your husband shakes his head. \u201cNo, poppet. Never apologise.\u201d Harry comes to kneel in front of you, his hands resting atop of your knees as he pouts his lips, his eyes glossing over at the sight of you. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard, darling \u2014\u201d he begins, but stops himself when you shake your head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy for her, Harry, I really am. I\u2019m happy for both of them,\u201d you clarify.</p><p>\u201cI know you are, sweetheart, I didn\u2019t think otherwise,\u201d he tells you matter of factly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s horrible, you know? Seeing and hearing everyone else around us announcing their pregnancies and having babies, and we can\u2019t even get pregnant,\u201d you sigh, sniffling. \u201cWhy is it taking so long?\u201d you ask, your bottom lip trembling once more.</p><p>\u201cHey, poppet, calm down for me, yeah?\u201d he pleads, bringing his hands up to cup your face, his thumb wiping away the tears that continue to spill over. \u201cIt\u2019ll happen when it happens, yeah? There\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t get pregnant, sometimes these things just take time,\u201d he speaks with conviction.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d your lip trembles once more as your husband intertwines his fingers within your own.</p><p>\u201cHow about we take a break?\u201d he hesitantly suggests, licking his plush lips as he simultaneously skims the skin of your hands with his fingertips. \u201cFor a little while, at least,\u201d he adds, finally resting his eyes on your features once more, in an attempt to read your expression.</p><p>You frown in confusion at Harry\u2019s words, pouting your lips slightly until you comprehend the meaning behind them. \u201cWhat \u2014 no,\u201d you tell him adamantly, vigorously shaking your head and tugging at your hands, although seemingly struggling at removing them from your husband\u2019s grasp as he tightens his hold on you.</p><p>\u201cNot permanently,\u201d he clarifies, sensing your fear and panic. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that we won\u2019t try, but how about we don\u2019t actually focus on the trying, so much?\u201d he proposes the idea that\u2019s been swimming around his head the past few weeks. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ve spent so much time trying for a baby, that we haven\u2019t been focussed on enjoying making love to each other,\u201d he tells you with a sad smile.</p><p>Your bottom lip trembles once again. You know your husband is right. The first attempts at trying for a baby were fun \u2014 you couldn\u2019t deny that the sex was amazing and you and Harry took every opportunity to love on each other. But within the most recent months where falling pregnant was proving to be unsuccessful, you had become obsessive over fertility trackers, and sex was becoming a chore as opposed to spending quality time of making love to each other.</p><p>\u201cHow about we have a little trip away somewhere?\u201d he suggests gently, his thumb continuing to brush over your shaking hands. \u201cItaly, or Paris, perhaps,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt might take our mind off of things for a while, and we could even make it our second honeymoon,\u201d he smirks cheekily.</p><p>Having only been married for four months, your special day was still imprinted in both of your minds, and whilst you had enjoyed your three week honeymoon in Greece, exploring the beaches and taking advantage of the alone time you had together, Harry had assured you that he would take you to other parts of the world and love on you even more, making it clear that \u201cone honeymoon just isn\u2019t enough.\u201d</p><p>A breathy laugh escapes your lips before they break into a smile. </p><p>\u201cThere it is,\u201d he murmurs softly, his expression happier now that you\u2019re smiling back at him. \u201cMiss that smile, angel. Need t\u2019 see it more often, yeah?\u201d</p><p>You nod. \u201c\u2018m sorry \u2014\u201d</p><p>Harry cuts you off, pressing his forefinger to your lips. \u201cStop apologising, doll. It\u2019s been a bit of a shitty time recently, and you have nothing to be sorry for.\u201d</p><p>Again, you realise there\u2019s no point in arguing with your husband \u2014 sometimes you hate to admit how often he\u2019s right. \u201cI know, it\u2019s just \u2014 you\u2019ve been amazing,\u201d you tell him, resting a hand on his cheek. \u201cYou\u2019ve put up with so much \u2014 so many tears and \u2014\u201d</p><p>Harry shakes his head. \u201cYou\u2019re my wife, I\u2019m always going to be there for you, darling. Never doubt that, yeah? There\u2019s nowhere else that I\u2019ll be,\u201d he tells you, his tone honest and genuine as he raises your hand, brushing his lips along your knuckles. \u201cI\u2019m in love with yeh. Always goin\u2019 t\u2019 be there. And someday, it\u2019ll be our turn,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI promise you.\u201d</p><p>Giving him a small nod, you smile down at him. \u201cI\u2019ll be down in a minute,\u201d you tell him, your tone lighter as you calm your previously anxious body. \u201cI promise,\u201d you assure him.</p><p>Harry sighs, \u201cYou know I\u2019m not leaving you like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Harry, I\u2019m fine,\u201d you mumble. \u201cI just \u2014 I just need some time to process it, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Harry. Please, can you just \u2014 just apologise to Gemma for me, and to your mum and Michal. I don\u2019t want to be a bitch \u2014\u201d your husband quickly cuts you off.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d he tells you firmly.</p><p>\u201c\u2014 just tell them I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018f course,\u201d he replies. \u201cWhat exactly do you want me to tell them?\u201d</p><p>You shrug. You didn\u2019t know. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d you tell him. You were torn \u2014 perhaps telling the truth would help Harry\u2019s family to understand why you reacted the way you did. Equally so, you didn\u2019t want sympathetic looks for the rest of the weekend, with people walking on eggshells around you \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t be fair to Gemma and Michal as they proudly talked about welcoming their bundle of joy into their lives within the next six months.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll never think any less of you, y\u2019know? You\u2019ll never be any different \u2014 you\u2019re still the same woman who\u2019s been there for me from day one, the same woman who makes me the happiest and proudest man on this Earth,\u201d he reassures you.</p><p>You nod, knowingly. Your husband\u2019s family had welcomed you with open arms from the first day he introduced you all to each other. From the moment they met you, they knew you would always hold a special place in Harry\u2019s heart, willing from the beginning of your relationship that you two would be lifelong partners.</p><p>He raises his hand to cup your face, his thumb skimming your cheekbone as he presses a soft kiss to your lips. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in a minute?\u201d he questions, gently.</p><p>You give him a small smile, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll just sort myself out then I\u2019ll be down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be long, yeah? I want to enjoy as much of this weekend sunshine together as we can,\u201d he smiles. He stands from his spot, giving you a supportive smile before begrudgingly leaving you alone in the bathroom, but he knows he should give you the space you deserve to comprehend recent events.</p><p>Heading down the stairs of the little Cheshire home, he makes out the words being faintly spoken, breathy voices sounding through the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI mean, did you see her face?\u201d he hears Gemma hiss, barely above a whisper, \u201cShe could barely bring herself to look at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a reasonable explanation, darling,\u201d he\u2019s grateful that his mother is defending his wife, and although he feels sympathetic towards his sister, Harry\u2019s heart breaks for his love who\u2019s locked herself away in the bathroom, secluding herself from his family \u2014 the woman he married and vowed to protect, beating herself up over something she couldn\u2019t possibly control.</p><p>\u201cWhat needs doing?\u201d Harry\u2019s voice suddenly pipes up as he enters the kitchen. He fakes a smile, but the consistency his family home continues to provide for him, the sight before him making him feel like he was a youngster once again, actually uplifts him a little.</p><p>Whilst Gemma is peeling an array of fruits in preparation for the fruit salad following the Sunday roast that was cooking in the oven, Anne begins stirring the gravy on the stove with the wooden spoon in her hand. Looking up at her son as he enters the room, she gives him a small smile. </p><p>\u201cMichal\u2019s just popped out for some more milk, so you could help your sister peel the fruit,\u201d she suggests, nodding towards the brightly coloured fresh fruits displayed - strawberries, oranges, pineapples, kiwis, plums, banana, mangoes \u2014 Anne had gone all out to ensure that family time around the table was maximised over the long weekend.</p><p>Harry nods, giving his mum a small smile before heading towards the fruit bowl.</p><p>\u201cIs everything ok, sweetheart?\u201d his mum questions gently, placing down the spoon and turning on her heel. Both her and Gemma watch Harry, their gaze burning into him as they struggle to take their eyes off of his frame.</p><p>\u201cYeah \u2014 yeah, everything\u2019s fine,\u201d he settles on his choice of words, fiddling with the orange in his hands, barely making a start on peeling the fruit he\u2019s holding.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just \u2014 she didn\u2019t seem happy about our news,\u201d Gemma murmurs, hurt coursing through her and it breaks Harry\u2019s heart that his sister can barely bring herself to speak your name aloud. \u201cI just hope I didn\u2019t offend her,\u201d she tells her brother, her expression solemn.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, God, Gem, you could never \u2014\u201d he begins, glancing at her from the corner of his eye. \u201cWe are <i>both</i> really happy for you,\u201d he speaks with sincerity, before pausing, \u201c\u2014 and the last thing we want is to overshadow what\u2019s obviously a happy time for you both \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d Anne asks, raising an eyebrow questioningly as she folds her arms across her chest.</p><p>\u201cBut, nothing,\u201d Harry shakes his head, a refusal to meet the gaze of his mum and sister.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Harry,\u201d Anne murmurs softly as she approaches the young boy from behind and rests a soft hand on his back, her palm resting between his shoulder blades as the other hand gently massages the top of his arm. \u201cI\u2019m your mother,\u201d she smiles, despite the fact that he can\u2019t see her expression. \u201cAnd regardless of the fact that you grew up well before your time and knowing so much more about the world than I do, I still know you well enough to know that everything\u2019s not fine. Talk to us, darling. We\u2019re here for you,\u201d she also gives Gemma a nod. \u201cWe\u2019re here for <i>both</i> of you,\u201d she clarifies, Anne supportive of both her son and daughter-in-law.</p><p>Harry softly chews his lip, before turning to face his mum. With glossy eyes, his bottom lip trembles before he speaks, continuing to fiddle nonchalantly with the orange. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying for months, mum,\u201d he begins, his eyes quickly finding the ceiling as he tries to prevent the sob that would escape him if he even catches a glance of a sympathetic look from either of his family members right now. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying for months and we just can\u2019t seem to get pregnant,\u201d he repeats, meeting his sisters gaze this time.</p><p>\u201cOh sweetheart,\u201d Anne whispers softly, her hand continuing to rub at her son\u2019s exposed skin, his toned muscles tensing further with the difficult conversation taking place.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying when I say we\u2019re happy for you, Gemma,\u201d he begins.</p><p>His older sister quickly shakes her head and holds up her hand, preventing her brother from continuing his sentence. \u201cHarry, honestly, it\u2019s fine,\u201d she tells him, her voice firm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry \u2014 had I have realised, I wouldn\u2019t have \u2014 God, I\u2019m so sorry, that must have been really hard for her \u2014 for you both, to hear,\u201d Gemma\u2019s considerate nature shines through.</p><p>\u201c\u2019s not your fault, yeh weren\u2019t t\u2019 know,\u201d Harry shrugs. \u201cShe just needs some time,\u201d Harry murmurs softly, his eyes finding the ceiling once more. \u201cShe asked me to apologise to you though,\u201d he gives both Anne and Gemma a small smile.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d Gemma tuts. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to her later \u2014 apologise, too,\u201d she adds.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Harry counter argues, not blaming Gemma for the day\u2019s events. He gives his sister a small nod before pulling her into a hug. \u201cI really am happy for you, sis,\u201d he smiles. \u201cWe both are.\u201d</p><p>Gemma murmurs her gratitude, reciprocating the hug, before pulling away and giving each other a supportive smile \u2014 one that was comforting in an attempt to reassure each other that, despite the occasional sibling rivalry, they will always be there for each other.</p><p>\u201cAnd how about you, darling? No doubt it\u2019s hard for both of you,\u201d Anne suddenly pipes up. \u201cIt\u2019s important for you to talk about your feelings, too, Harry. I know you only too well to see that you\u2019ll be comforting and reassuring, but not talking about how <i>you</i> feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will happen when it happens, I guess,\u201d Harry begins with a shrug. \u201cObviously I want children, too. I don\u2019t want anyone else t\u2019 be the mother of m\u2019kiddies, wouldn\u2019t \u2018ave married her otherwise,\u201d he speaks with conviction. \u201cI just \u2014 I can\u2019t handle seeing her in pieces over another negative test,\u201d he whimpers. \u201cShe suffered a phantom pregnancy a couple of months ago,\u201d he tells the two women and Anne gasps at the revelation, covering her mouth with her hand in shock. Harry\u2019s expression is pained as he exhales a shaky breath, recalling the symptoms, \u201cHer periods stopped, she was being sick \u2014 specifically in the mornings \u2014\u201d </p><p>\u201cDarling,\u201d Anne murmurs softly, pulling her son into her embrace.</p><p>\u201cWatching her go through that only to find out she wasn\u2019t pregnant, <i>Christ</i>, it practically killed her. She\u2019s already picked out baby names and been shopping for baby clothes,\u201d he adds, painful memories flooding back to him as he remembers comforting you on the day you discovered you weren\u2019t actually pregnant.</p><p>\u201cOh sweetheart,\u201d Anne\u2019s sympathetic voice fills the room. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard to hear, but you <i>are</i> right. It\u2019ll happen when it\u2019s meant to be, and maybe now just isn\u2019t the time. You haven\u2019t been married <i>that</i> long and so perhaps you should just enjoy newlywed life for a little longer. You have plenty of time,\u201d she smiles.</p><p>Harry nods, steadying himself on the kitchen counter as he holds onto the granite worktop. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I said \u2014 not to focus on trying and to just enjoy spending time together,\u201d he begins, his cheeks suddenly flushing as the words leave his lips. \u201cNo, I mean \u2014\u201d but Anne holds a hand up to stop him, nodding in understanding.</p><p>\u201cMum\u2019s right. This one wasn\u2019t exactly planned,\u201d Gemma admits, resting a hand on her stomach. \u201cAnd perhaps that\u2019s what will happen with you two. It\u2019ll happen when you least expect it. I mean, we all know you\u2019d be the best parents. Your children will want for nothing, Harry. They\u2019re going to have an amazing mummy<i> and</i> daddy who love them very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Gem,\u201d Harry smiles, his eyes glossing over once more at the emotional conversation taking place within his childhood home. Had someone told him a few years ago that not only would he be continuing with a steadily successful solo career, but he would also married to the love of his life and trying to start a family with her, he would have probably told them to \u201cpiss off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust take everything one day at a time,\u201d Anne tells him, before continuing once again, \u201c\u2014 and it will happen, darling. I promise you, it will,\u201d she assures her son, easing his obvious anxiousness.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he agrees, \u201cyeah, it will happen,\u201d smiling fondly at the thought of starting your little family together, \u201csomeday.\u201d</p>",

With his other arm slung around the back of your chair, his fingertips quickly dance on your shoulder, the thin strap to your floral summer dress giving him easy access to your bare skin. You can feel a lump form at the base of your throat as you watch Harry give you a sympathetic look from the corner of your eye as you comprehend your sister-in-law\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Anne begins, the realisation of the conversation only just dawning, \u201cthe three of \u2014 what \u2014 wait, you\u2019re pregnant?\u201d the older woman asks, her smile beaming as she removes her sunglasses from her face, pushing them up into her hair. </p><p>\u201c<b>I\u2019m pregnant</b>,\u201d Gemma confirms, resting a hand on her stomach. \u201cTwelves weeks,\u201d she clarifies.</p><p>\u201cOh my goodness, Gemma! Congratulations!\u201d Anne\u2019s voice chirps as she stands from her chair and shuffles her feet to the other side of the table. Pulling her daughter into her, she gives her a kiss on the cheek. \u201cOh, I\u2019m so happy for you both!\u201d she exclaims, before pressing a peck to Michal\u2019s cheek, too.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Harry smiles, leaning forwards in his chair and reaching across the table to shake Michal\u2019s hand, before giving his sister a small nod. \u201cI\u2019m really happy for you,\u201d he adds, his smile genuine as his sister quite literally glows with happiness.</p><p>\u201cYeah, congratulations to you both,\u201d you murmur softly, desperately hoping that the smile you display to the family before you is a genuine one, but with your voice laced with sadness, you\u2019re not even sure you\u2019ve convinced yourself, let alone everyone around you.</p><p>Gemma smiles, still giddy after revealing her exciting news, \u201cYou could at least seem happy,\u201d she jokes lightheartedly, \u201cI mean, you look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost,\u201d she notes your obviously distracted expression.</p><p>You force another smile as you sense Harry\u2019s burning gaze on you, him watching you vigilantly as his hand reaches for your own underneath table. He interlocks his fingers with yours, comfortingly intertwining them, his thumb occasionally skimming your skin.</p><p>\u201cNo really, I\u2019m happy for you \u2014 for both of you,\u201d you clarify.</p><p>Your answer seems to satisfy the young female, who\u2019s features resembles a lot of your husband\u2019s, and her bubbly self continues to express her enthusiasm at the happy situation. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the twelve week scan already,\u201d she murmurs, \u201chere,\u201d she gestures towards Michal as her long term partner delves into his back pocket for his leather wallet.</p><p>\u201cLook, there\u2019s it\u2019s fingers, and there\u2019s it toes \u2014\u201d Michal proudly displays the ultrasound picture and points out the baby\u2019s body parts. With his permission, Anne takes it from him, looking at the scan of her first Grandchild in awe as her fingertips trace over the glossy paper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a second,\u201d you whisper softly to Harry, pulling your hand away from his and standing from your spot. You enter the house through the opened patio doors, leaving your husband and his family in the garden as you head upstairs and away from the clearly difficult situation.</p><p>\u201cIs she ok?\u201d Anne looks up and asks her son at your sudden departure.</p><p>\u201c\u2018m just goin\u2019 to check on her,\u201d Harry murmurs softly, before giving his sister a small smile \u2014 one that appears apologetic yet also indicates that he really is happy for both her and Michal with the good news that they had shared.</p><p>Heading up the stairs of his childhood home, he runs a hand over his face and steadies his breath. Upon reaching the bathroom door, he unmistakably hears your soft sniffles and it tears at his heart strings. Lightly tapping on the door that acts as a barrier between you, his soft voice murmurs, \u201cSweetheart, it\u2019s me,\u201d confirming your suspicions that your husband would of course follow you in your time of distress.</p><p>He\u2019s met with a deafening silence and he knows you\u2019re preventing the sobs you\u2019re holding back from escaping your lips, and that only shatters his heart further.</p><p>\u201cDarling, please let me in,\u201d he begs. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, I\u2019m fine. Go back downstairs \u2014 I\u2019ll be out in a minute,\u201d you assure him.</p><p>He sighs heavily, licking his lips. \u201cDarling, open the door,\u201d he simply states. You should know by now that he wouldn\u2019t leave you alone, especially when you\u2019re crying \u2014 God, he really hates it when you cry \u2014 and you know there\u2019s no point in arguing against him. The moment his hand rests upon the doorknob, he hears you unlocking it from the inside.</p><p>He emits a sigh of relief, grateful that you\u2019ll allow him to comfort you in your time of need.</p><p>\u201cHey, angel,\u201d he murmurs softly, as he enters the bathroom. \u201cOh sweetheart,\u201d he breathes, as he takes in your demeanour. You\u2019re sat on the edge of the bath, your cheeks blotchy and your eyes red and puffy from the crying, as the taste of salt lingers on your lips.</p><p>\u201c\u2018m sorry,\u201d you mumble, wiping away the tears with the back of your hand.</p><p>Locking the door behind him, your husband shakes his head. \u201cNo, poppet. Never apologise.\u201d Harry comes to kneel in front of you, his hands resting atop of your knees as he pouts his lips, his eyes glossing over at the sight of you. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard, darling \u2014\u201d he begins, but stops himself when you shake your head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy for her, Harry, I really am. I\u2019m happy for both of them,\u201d you clarify.</p><p>\u201cI know you are, sweetheart, I didn\u2019t think otherwise,\u201d he tells you matter of factly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s horrible, you know? Seeing and hearing everyone else around us announcing their pregnancies and having babies, and we can\u2019t even get pregnant,\u201d you sigh, sniffling. \u201cWhy is it taking so long?\u201d you ask, your bottom lip trembling once more.</p><p>\u201cHey, poppet, calm down for me, yeah?\u201d he pleads, bringing his hands up to cup your face, his thumb wiping away the tears that continue to spill over. \u201cIt\u2019ll happen when it happens, yeah? There\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t get pregnant, sometimes these things just take time,\u201d he speaks with conviction.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d your lip trembles once more as your husband intertwines his fingers within your own.</p><p>\u201cHow about we take a break?\u201d he hesitantly suggests, licking his plush lips as he simultaneously skims the skin of your hands with his fingertips. \u201cFor a little while, at least,\u201d he adds, finally resting his eyes on your features once more, in an attempt to read your expression.</p><p>You frown in confusion at Harry\u2019s words, pouting your lips slightly until you comprehend the meaning behind them. \u201cWhat \u2014 no,\u201d you tell him adamantly, vigorously shaking your head and tugging at your hands, although seemingly struggling at removing them from your husband\u2019s grasp as he tightens his hold on you.</p><p>\u201cNot permanently,\u201d he clarifies, sensing your fear and panic. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that we won\u2019t try, but how about we don\u2019t actually focus on the trying, so much?\u201d he proposes the idea that\u2019s been swimming around his head the past few weeks. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ve spent so much time trying for a baby, that we haven\u2019t been focussed on enjoying making love to each other,\u201d he tells you with a sad smile.</p><p>Your bottom lip trembles once again. You know your husband is right. The first attempts at trying for a baby were fun \u2014 you couldn\u2019t deny that the sex was amazing and you and Harry took every opportunity to love on each other. But within the most recent months where falling pregnant was proving to be unsuccessful, you had become obsessive over fertility trackers, and sex was becoming a chore as opposed to spending quality time of making love to each other.</p><p>\u201cHow about we have a little trip away somewhere?\u201d he suggests gently, his thumb continuing to brush over your shaking hands. \u201cItaly, or Paris, perhaps,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt might take our mind off of things for a while, and we could even make it our second honeymoon,\u201d he smirks cheekily.</p><p>Having only been married for four months, your special day was still imprinted in both of your minds, and whilst you had enjoyed your three week honeymoon in Greece, exploring the beaches and taking advantage of the alone time you had together, Harry had assured you that he would take you to other parts of the world and love on you even more, making it clear that \u201cone honeymoon just isn\u2019t enough.\u201d</p><p>A breathy laugh escapes your lips before they break into a smile. </p><p>\u201cThere it is,\u201d he murmurs softly, his expression happier now that you\u2019re smiling back at him. \u201cMiss that smile, angel. Need t\u2019 see it more often, yeah?\u201d</p><p>You nod. \u201c\u2018m sorry \u2014\u201d</p><p>Harry cuts you off, pressing his forefinger to your lips. \u201cStop apologising, doll. It\u2019s been a bit of a shitty time recently, and you have nothing to be sorry for.\u201d</p><p>Again, you realise there\u2019s no point in arguing with your husband \u2014 sometimes you hate to admit how often he\u2019s right. \u201cI know, it\u2019s just \u2014 you\u2019ve been amazing,\u201d you tell him, resting a hand on his cheek. \u201cYou\u2019ve put up with so much \u2014 so many tears and \u2014\u201d</p><p>Harry shakes his head. \u201cYou\u2019re my wife, I\u2019m always going to be there for you, darling. Never doubt that, yeah? There\u2019s nowhere else that I\u2019ll be,\u201d he tells you, his tone honest and genuine as he raises your hand, brushing his lips along your knuckles. \u201cI\u2019m in love with yeh. Always goin\u2019 t\u2019 be there. And someday, it\u2019ll be our turn,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI promise you.\u201d</p><p>Giving him a small nod, you smile down at him. \u201cI\u2019ll be down in a minute,\u201d you tell him, your tone lighter as you calm your previously anxious body. \u201cI promise,\u201d you assure him.</p><p>Harry sighs, \u201cYou know I\u2019m not leaving you like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Harry, I\u2019m fine,\u201d you mumble. \u201cI just \u2014 I just need some time to process it, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Harry. Please, can you just \u2014 just apologise to Gemma for me, and to your mum and Michal. I don\u2019t want to be a bitch \u2014\u201d your husband quickly cuts you off.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d he tells you firmly.</p><p>\u201c\u2014 just tell them I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018f course,\u201d he replies. \u201cWhat exactly do you want me to tell them?\u201d</p><p>You shrug. You didn\u2019t know. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d you tell him. You were torn \u2014 perhaps telling the truth would help Harry\u2019s family to understand why you reacted the way you did. Equally so, you didn\u2019t want sympathetic looks for the rest of the weekend, with people walking on eggshells around you \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t be fair to Gemma and Michal as they proudly talked about welcoming their bundle of joy into their lives within the next six months.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll never think any less of you, y\u2019know? You\u2019ll never be any different \u2014 you\u2019re still the same woman who\u2019s been there for me from day one, the same woman who makes me the happiest and proudest man on this Earth,\u201d he reassures you.</p><p>You nod, knowingly. Your husband\u2019s family had welcomed you with open arms from the first day he introduced you all to each other. From the moment they met you, they knew you would always hold a special place in Harry\u2019s heart, willing from the beginning of your relationship that you two would be lifelong partners.</p><p>He raises his hand to cup your face, his thumb skimming your cheekbone as he presses a soft kiss to your lips. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in a minute?\u201d he questions, gently.</p><p>You give him a small smile, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll just sort myself out then I\u2019ll be down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be long, yeah? I want to enjoy as much of this weekend sunshine together as we can,\u201d he smiles. He stands from his spot, giving you a supportive smile before begrudgingly leaving you alone in the bathroom, but he knows he should give you the space you deserve to comprehend recent events.</p><p>Heading down the stairs of the little Cheshire home, he makes out the words being faintly spoken, breathy voices sounding through the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI mean, did you see her face?\u201d he hears Gemma hiss, barely above a whisper, \u201cShe could barely bring herself to look at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a reasonable explanation, darling,\u201d he\u2019s grateful that his mother is defending his wife, and although he feels sympathetic towards his sister, Harry\u2019s heart breaks for his love who\u2019s locked herself away in the bathroom, secluding herself from his family \u2014 the woman he married and vowed to protect, beating herself up over something she couldn\u2019t possibly control.</p><p>\u201cWhat needs doing?\u201d Harry\u2019s voice suddenly pipes up as he enters the kitchen. He fakes a smile, but the consistency his family home continues to provide for him, the sight before him making him feel like he was a youngster once again, actually uplifts him a little.</p><p>Whilst Gemma is peeling an array of fruits in preparation for the fruit salad following the Sunday roast that was cooking in the oven, Anne begins stirring the gravy on the stove with the wooden spoon in her hand. Looking up at her son as he enters the room, she gives him a small smile. </p><p>\u201cMichal\u2019s just popped out for some more milk, so you could help your sister peel the fruit,\u201d she suggests, nodding towards the brightly coloured fresh fruits displayed - strawberries, oranges, pineapples, kiwis, plums, banana, mangoes \u2014 Anne had gone all out to ensure that family time around the table was maximised over the long weekend.</p><p>Harry nods, giving his mum a small smile before heading towards the fruit bowl.</p><p>\u201cIs everything ok, sweetheart?\u201d his mum questions gently, placing down the spoon and turning on her heel. Both her and Gemma watch Harry, their gaze burning into him as they struggle to take their eyes off of his frame.</p><p>\u201cYeah \u2014 yeah, everything\u2019s fine,\u201d he settles on his choice of words, fiddling with the orange in his hands, barely making a start on peeling the fruit he\u2019s holding.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just \u2014 she didn\u2019t seem happy about our news,\u201d Gemma murmurs, hurt coursing through her and it breaks Harry\u2019s heart that his sister can barely bring herself to speak your name aloud. \u201cI just hope I didn\u2019t offend her,\u201d she tells her brother, her expression solemn.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, God, Gem, you could never \u2014\u201d he begins, glancing at her from the corner of his eye. \u201cWe are <i>both</i> really happy for you,\u201d he speaks with sincerity, before pausing, \u201c\u2014 and the last thing we want is to overshadow what\u2019s obviously a happy time for you both \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d Anne asks, raising an eyebrow questioningly as she folds her arms across her chest.</p><p>\u201cBut, nothing,\u201d Harry shakes his head, a refusal to meet the gaze of his mum and sister.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Harry,\u201d Anne murmurs softly as she approaches the young boy from behind and rests a soft hand on his back, her palm resting between his shoulder blades as the other hand gently massages the top of his arm. \u201cI\u2019m your mother,\u201d she smiles, despite the fact that he can\u2019t see her expression. \u201cAnd regardless of the fact that you grew up well before your time and knowing so much more about the world than I do, I still know you well enough to know that everything\u2019s not fine. Talk to us, darling. We\u2019re here for you,\u201d she also gives Gemma a nod. \u201cWe\u2019re here for <i>both</i> of you,\u201d she clarifies, Anne supportive of both her son and daughter-in-law.</p><p>Harry softly chews his lip, before turning to face his mum. With glossy eyes, his bottom lip trembles before he speaks, continuing to fiddle nonchalantly with the orange. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying for months, mum,\u201d he begins, his eyes quickly finding the ceiling as he tries to prevent the sob that would escape him if he even catches a glance of a sympathetic look from either of his family members right now. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying for months and we just can\u2019t seem to get pregnant,\u201d he repeats, meeting his sisters gaze this time.</p><p>\u201cOh sweetheart,\u201d Anne whispers softly, her hand continuing to rub at her son\u2019s exposed skin, his toned muscles tensing further with the difficult conversation taking place.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying when I say we\u2019re happy for you, Gemma,\u201d he begins.</p><p>His older sister quickly shakes her head and holds up her hand, preventing her brother from continuing his sentence. \u201cHarry, honestly, it\u2019s fine,\u201d she tells him, her voice firm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry \u2014 had I have realised, I wouldn\u2019t have \u2014 God, I\u2019m so sorry, that must have been really hard for her \u2014 for you both, to hear,\u201d Gemma\u2019s considerate nature shines through.</p><p>\u201c\u2019s not your fault, yeh weren\u2019t t\u2019 know,\u201d Harry shrugs. \u201cShe just needs some time,\u201d Harry murmurs softly, his eyes finding the ceiling once more. \u201cShe asked me to apologise to you though,\u201d he gives both Anne and Gemma a small smile.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d Gemma tuts. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to her later \u2014 apologise, too,\u201d she adds.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Harry counter argues, not blaming Gemma for the day\u2019s events. He gives his sister a small nod before pulling her into a hug. \u201cI really am happy for you, sis,\u201d he smiles. \u201cWe both are.\u201d</p><p>Gemma murmurs her gratitude, reciprocating the hug, before pulling away and giving each other a supportive smile \u2014 one that was comforting in an attempt to reassure each other that, despite the occasional sibling rivalry, they will always be there for each other.</p><p>\u201cAnd how about you, darling? No doubt it\u2019s hard for both of you,\u201d Anne suddenly pipes up. \u201cIt\u2019s important for you to talk about your feelings, too, Harry. I know you only too well to see that you\u2019ll be comforting and reassuring, but not talking about how <i>you</i> feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will happen when it happens, I guess,\u201d Harry begins with a shrug. \u201cObviously I want children, too. I don\u2019t want anyone else t\u2019 be the mother of m\u2019kiddies, wouldn\u2019t \u2018ave married her otherwise,\u201d he speaks with conviction. \u201cI just \u2014 I can\u2019t handle seeing her in pieces over another negative test,\u201d he whimpers. \u201cShe suffered a phantom pregnancy a couple of months ago,\u201d he tells the two women and Anne gasps at the revelation, covering her mouth with her hand in shock. Harry\u2019s expression is pained as he exhales a shaky breath, recalling the symptoms, \u201cHer periods stopped, she was being sick \u2014 specifically in the mornings \u2014\u201d </p><p>\u201cDarling,\u201d Anne murmurs softly, pulling her son into her embrace.</p><p>\u201cWatching her go through that only to find out she wasn\u2019t pregnant, <i>Christ</i>, it practically killed her. She\u2019s already picked out baby names and been shopping for baby clothes,\u201d he adds, painful memories flooding back to him as he remembers comforting you on the day you discovered you weren\u2019t actually pregnant.</p><p>\u201cOh sweetheart,\u201d Anne\u2019s sympathetic voice fills the room. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard to hear, but you <i>are</i> right. It\u2019ll happen when it\u2019s meant to be, and maybe now just isn\u2019t the time. You haven\u2019t been married <i>that</i> long and so perhaps you should just enjoy newlywed life for a little longer. You have plenty of time,\u201d she smiles.</p><p>Harry nods, steadying himself on the kitchen counter as he holds onto the granite worktop. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I said \u2014 not to focus on trying and to just enjoy spending time together,\u201d he begins, his cheeks suddenly flushing as the words leave his lips. \u201cNo, I mean \u2014\u201d but Anne holds a hand up to stop him, nodding in understanding.</p><p>\u201cMum\u2019s right. This one wasn\u2019t exactly planned,\u201d Gemma admits, resting a hand on her stomach. \u201cAnd perhaps that\u2019s what will happen with you two. It\u2019ll happen when you least expect it. I mean, we all know you\u2019d be the best parents. Your children will want for nothing, Harry. They\u2019re going to have an amazing mummy<i> and</i> daddy who love them very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Gem,\u201d Harry smiles, his eyes glossing over once more at the emotional conversation taking place within his childhood home. Had someone told him a few years ago that not only would he be continuing with a steadily successful solo career, but he would also married to the love of his life and trying to start a family with her, he would have probably told them to \u201cpiss off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust take everything one day at a time,\u201d Anne tells him, before continuing once again, \u201c\u2014 and it will happen, darling. I promise you, it will,\u201d she assures her son, easing his obvious anxiousness.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he agrees, \u201cyeah, it will happen,\u201d smiling fondly at the thought of starting your little family together, \u201csomeday.\u201d</p>",

Anyway, without further ado, here it is again!</p><p>So, basically, I received two requests at a similar time \u2014 and I don\u2019t like letting people down and cheating my way out of prompts by only doing one request. Another anon requested Number 18 \u2014 but left it up to me to decide which section to choose from, so I really hope you don\u2019t mind but I have incorporated these two \u2014 <b>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d</b> and <b>\u201cDon\u2019t come yet,\u201d</b> \u2014 but in two different parts, (with part two is still in the process of being written). It\u2019s been a piece that I\u2019ve played in my mind over and over again and these prompts gave me a good enough excuse to write and post it, so I <i>really</i> hope I\u2019ve done it justice for you both! So here\u2019s part one (and 4K of husband!harry)! And of course, stay tuned for part two!</p><p><b>Just a slight warning that this one contains sensitive material surrounding difficulties in falling pregnant and also brief mentions of phantom pregnancies, so please do not read this if you are or will be affected \u2014 and my ask box is always open if you want to talk!</b></p><p><b>Someday.</b></p><p>Spending a Bank Holiday at Anne\u2019s was becoming somewhat of a tradition for you as a couple, and this Spring holiday was no different. Having packed up the car on the previous Friday afternoon, you and Harry had travelled up to Holmes Chapel to spend the long weekend at your husband\u2019s childhood home with his family.</p><p>You had awoken, in his childhood bedroom, to the aromas of food cooking in the kitchen, knowing full well that, despite no longer having to make the effort and impress anyone, Anne would still be providing a breakfast spread.</p><p>As expected, once you were up, ready and headed downstairs, you were met with an array of delicious foods \u2014 a variety of cereals with cold milk, fresh and tinned fruits, croissants, yoghurts, hot toast and butter, quality meats from the local butcher that Harry constantly raved about, eggs, \u2014 scrambled and fried \u2014 and different juices including pineapple, orange and mango. The breakfast buffet before you felt as though you were in a five star hotel as opposed to your husband\u2019s family home, but nonetheless, you always appreciated Anne\u2019s efforts at welcoming guests into her home.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Harry\u2019s raspy voice appears as you pour your orange juice into a glass.</p><p>You turn around to see your husband exiting the lounge through the patio doors. He stops to greet his mother, giving her a kiss on the cheek, before coming to stand behind you. He rests a hand on your hip, dropping a kiss to your jawline from behind, as a low growl leaves the base of his throat.</p><p>\u201cMorning, wifey,\u201d he murmurs.</p><p>\u201cGet a room, you two,\u201d Gemma smirks, as she too, joins you all in the garden, closely followed by Michal. \u201cI mean, you\u2019ve been married, what \u2014 three months,\u201d she shrugs, \u201cThought you\u2019d have got it out of your system by now,\u201d she laughs.</p><p>\u201cFour, actually,\u201d Harry clarifies with a smirk, draping an arm around your shoulder as you pour him a pineapple juice and hand it to him. \u201cFour months, and two days,\u201d he specifies, waggling his ring finger in front of his sister as he takes a sip of the freshly squeezed fruit.</p><p>\u201cYoung love,\u201d Anne beams. \u201cCould\u2019ve at least put a shirt on though, Mister!\u201d she laughs, noticing his half naked body as he seats himself on the black and white checked gingham garden furniture \u2014 a set that Harry had bought his mum for Christmas one year, despite the fact that it wouldn\u2019t come in handy until summertime when the weather would get warmer and the nights would become longer.</p><p>Harry shrugs, \u201c\u2019s why she married, for all this,\u201d he gestures towards his ink covered body.</p><p>You blush at his comment, and although it was no secret that his body art was one of the many reasons you found yourself sexually attracted to him, you had both embarked on a romantic relationship where you love each other, focussing on making each other happy, supporting each other and respecting the others\u2019 boundaries, and working together to become best friends, lovers, soulmates, and equals.</p><p>\u201cJust ignore him,\u201d Gemma smirks. \u201cHe\u2019s all mouth and no trousers,\u201d she adds.</p><p>\u201cExactly my point, that\u2019s why she married me,\u201d he jokes once more.</p><p>Your cheeks continue to flush a deeper shade of red, and Harry rests a hand on your thigh, whispering a quick, \u201c\u2018m sorry, lovie, but we both know it\u2019s true,\u201d with a smirk \u2014 and luckily for you, his comment is out of ear shot from everyone else, which you\u2019re only too grateful for because you\u2019re not sure you could handle any more embarrassment.</p><p>Within seconds, the conversation easily flows and takes a different direction. Anne discusses the weekend weather and her plans for the following week, whilst Gemma talks about her most recent article focusing on feminism, educating everyone on issues for girls around the world, something that everyone listened intently to, and as expected, Harry barely reveals any information regarding the next album.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a minute,\u201d Gemma suddenly says, with a smile as she takes herself back into the house, leaving you and Harry to reminisce over your honeymoon \u2014 which despite the fact that it finished three months ago, you still couldn\u2019t help talking about the amazing adventures you\u2019d experienced together in your newlywed lifestyle.</p><p>\u201cIt was just nice having the pool to ourselves, and the food \u2014\u201d Harry practically drools as he thinks back to the Greek cuisine. \u201cThe food was<i> amazing</i>!\u201d he sighs, eyes rolling as he seriously contemplates packing the car up, driving to the airport and flying you both back to Greece for an extended holiday.</p><p>\u201cThe food was really good,\u201d you agree, \u201cBut the beaches were to die for though,\u201d you smile, adding to the complimentary comments of the country you\u2019d visited together. \u201cThey were so sandy and beautiful, it was just so peaceful,\u201d you tell the other two adults in front of you who listen attentively, before Gemma reappears once again, skipping out of the patio doors.</p><p>\u201cHappy Easter,\u201d she smiles, as she excitedly hands each of you a boxed chocolate egg. She gives Michal a knowing smile, regaining her position on her chair beside him and barely giving any of you the opportunity to express your gratitude, before she states, \u201cIt\u2019s from the three of us,\u201d with a squeal.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cOh thanks, Gem,\u201d Anne\u2019s voice begins.</p><p>Harry\u2019s hand finds your thigh once again, giving you a reassuring squeeze. With his other arm slung around the back of your chair, his fingertips quickly dance on your shoulder, the thin strap to your floral summer dress giving him easy access to your bare skin. You can feel a lump form at the base of your throat as you watch Harry give you a sympathetic look from the corner of your eye as you comprehend your sister-in-law\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Anne begins, the realisation of the conversation only just dawning, \u201cthe three of \u2014 what \u2014 wait, you\u2019re pregnant?\u201d the older woman asks, her smile beaming as she removes her sunglasses from her face, pushing them up into her hair. </p><p>\u201c<b>I\u2019m pregnant</b>,\u201d Gemma confirms, resting a hand on her stomach. \u201cTwelves weeks,\u201d she clarifies.</p><p>\u201cOh my goodness, Gemma! Congratulations!\u201d Anne\u2019s voice chirps as she stands from her chair and shuffles her feet to the other side of the table. Pulling her daughter into her, she gives her a kiss on the cheek. \u201cOh, I\u2019m so happy for you both!\u201d she exclaims, before pressing a peck to Michal\u2019s cheek, too.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Harry smiles, leaning forwards in his chair and reaching across the table to shake Michal\u2019s hand, before giving his sister a small nod. \u201cI\u2019m really happy for you,\u201d he adds, his smile genuine as his sister quite literally glows with happiness.</p><p>\u201cYeah, congratulations to you both,\u201d you murmur softly, desperately hoping that the smile you display to the family before you is a genuine one, but with your voice laced with sadness, you\u2019re not even sure you\u2019ve convinced yourself, let alone everyone around you.</p><p>Gemma smiles, still giddy after revealing her exciting news, \u201cYou could at least seem happy,\u201d she jokes lightheartedly, \u201cI mean, you look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost,\u201d she notes your obviously distracted expression.</p><p>You force another smile as you sense Harry\u2019s burning gaze on you, him watching you vigilantly as his hand reaches for your own underneath table. He interlocks his fingers with yours, comfortingly intertwining them, his thumb occasionally skimming your skin.</p><p>\u201cNo really, I\u2019m happy for you \u2014 for both of you,\u201d you clarify.</p><p>Your answer seems to satisfy the young female, who\u2019s features resembles a lot of your husband\u2019s, and her bubbly self continues to express her enthusiasm at the happy situation. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the twelve week scan already,\u201d she murmurs, \u201chere,\u201d she gestures towards Michal as her long term partner delves into his back pocket for his leather wallet.</p><p>\u201cLook, there\u2019s it\u2019s fingers, and there\u2019s it toes \u2014\u201d Michal proudly displays the ultrasound picture and points out the baby\u2019s body parts. With his permission, Anne takes it from him, looking at the scan of her first Grandchild in awe as her fingertips trace over the glossy paper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a second,\u201d you whisper softly to Harry, pulling your hand away from his and standing from your spot. You enter the house through the opened patio doors, leaving your husband and his family in the garden as you head upstairs and away from the clearly difficult situation.</p><p>\u201cIs she ok?\u201d Anne looks up and asks her son at your sudden departure.</p><p>\u201c\u2018m just goin\u2019 to check on her,\u201d Harry murmurs softly, before giving his sister a small smile \u2014 one that appears apologetic yet also indicates that he really is happy for both her and Michal with the good news that they had shared.</p><p>Heading up the stairs of his childhood home, he runs a hand over his face and steadies his breath. Upon reaching the bathroom door, he unmistakably hears your soft sniffles and it tears at his heart strings. Lightly tapping on the door that acts as a barrier between you, his soft voice murmurs, \u201cSweetheart, it\u2019s me,\u201d confirming your suspicions that your husband would of course follow you in your time of distress.</p><p>He\u2019s met with a deafening silence and he knows you\u2019re preventing the sobs you\u2019re holding back from escaping your lips, and that only shatters his heart further.</p><p>\u201cDarling, please let me in,\u201d he begs. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, I\u2019m fine. Go back downstairs \u2014 I\u2019ll be out in a minute,\u201d you assure him.</p><p>He sighs heavily, licking his lips. \u201cDarling, open the door,\u201d he simply states. You should know by now that he wouldn\u2019t leave you alone, especially when you\u2019re crying \u2014 God, he really hates it when you cry \u2014 and you know there\u2019s no point in arguing against him. The moment his hand rests upon the doorknob, he hears you unlocking it from the inside.</p><p>He emits a sigh of relief, grateful that you\u2019ll allow him to comfort you in your time of need.</p><p>\u201cHey, angel,\u201d he murmurs softly, as he enters the bathroom. \u201cOh sweetheart,\u201d he breathes, as he takes in your demeanour. You\u2019re sat on the edge of the bath, your cheeks blotchy and your eyes red and puffy from the crying, as the taste of salt lingers on your lips.</p><p>\u201c\u2018m sorry,\u201d you mumble, wiping away the tears with the back of your hand.</p><p>Locking the door behind him, your husband shakes his head. \u201cNo, poppet. Never apologise.\u201d Harry comes to kneel in front of you, his hands resting atop of your knees as he pouts his lips, his eyes glossing over at the sight of you. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard, darling \u2014\u201d he begins, but stops himself when you shake your head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy for her, Harry, I really am. I\u2019m happy for both of them,\u201d you clarify.</p><p>\u201cI know you are, sweetheart, I didn\u2019t think otherwise,\u201d he tells you matter of factly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s horrible, you know? Seeing and hearing everyone else around us announcing their pregnancies and having babies, and we can\u2019t even get pregnant,\u201d you sigh, sniffling. \u201cWhy is it taking so long?\u201d you ask, your bottom lip trembling once more.</p><p>\u201cHey, poppet, calm down for me, yeah?\u201d he pleads, bringing his hands up to cup your face, his thumb wiping away the tears that continue to spill over. \u201cIt\u2019ll happen when it happens, yeah? There\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t get pregnant, sometimes these things just take time,\u201d he speaks with conviction.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d your lip trembles once more as your husband intertwines his fingers within your own.</p><p>\u201cHow about we take a break?\u201d he hesitantly suggests, licking his plush lips as he simultaneously skims the skin of your hands with his fingertips. \u201cFor a little while, at least,\u201d he adds, finally resting his eyes on your features once more, in an attempt to read your expression.</p><p>You frown in confusion at Harry\u2019s words, pouting your lips slightly until you comprehend the meaning behind them. \u201cWhat \u2014 no,\u201d you tell him adamantly, vigorously shaking your head and tugging at your hands, although seemingly struggling at removing them from your husband\u2019s grasp as he tightens his hold on you.</p><p>\u201cNot permanently,\u201d he clarifies, sensing your fear and panic. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that we won\u2019t try, but how about we don\u2019t actually focus on the trying, so much?\u201d he proposes the idea that\u2019s been swimming around his head the past few weeks. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ve spent so much time trying for a baby, that we haven\u2019t been focussed on enjoying making love to each other,\u201d he tells you with a sad smile.</p><p>Your bottom lip trembles once again. You know your husband is right. The first attempts at trying for a baby were fun \u2014 you couldn\u2019t deny that the sex was amazing and you and Harry took every opportunity to love on each other. But within the most recent months where falling pregnant was proving to be unsuccessful, you had become obsessive over fertility trackers, and sex was becoming a chore as opposed to spending quality time of making love to each other.</p><p>\u201cHow about we have a little trip away somewhere?\u201d he suggests gently, his thumb continuing to brush over your shaking hands. \u201cItaly, or Paris, perhaps,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt might take our mind off of things for a while, and we could even make it our second honeymoon,\u201d he smirks cheekily.</p><p>Having only been married for four months, your special day was still imprinted in both of your minds, and whilst you had enjoyed your three week honeymoon in Greece, exploring the beaches and taking advantage of the alone time you had together, Harry had assured you that he would take you to other parts of the world and love on you even more, making it clear that \u201cone honeymoon just isn\u2019t enough.\u201d</p><p>A breathy laugh escapes your lips before they break into a smile. </p><p>\u201cThere it is,\u201d he murmurs softly, his expression happier now that you\u2019re smiling back at him. \u201cMiss that smile, angel. Need t\u2019 see it more often, yeah?\u201d</p><p>You nod. \u201c\u2018m sorry \u2014\u201d</p><p>Harry cuts you off, pressing his forefinger to your lips. \u201cStop apologising, doll. It\u2019s been a bit of a shitty time recently, and you have nothing to be sorry for.\u201d</p><p>Again, you realise there\u2019s no point in arguing with your husband \u2014 sometimes you hate to admit how often he\u2019s right. \u201cI know, it\u2019s just \u2014 you\u2019ve been amazing,\u201d you tell him, resting a hand on his cheek. \u201cYou\u2019ve put up with so much \u2014 so many tears and \u2014\u201d</p><p>Harry shakes his head. \u201cYou\u2019re my wife, I\u2019m always going to be there for you, darling. Never doubt that, yeah? There\u2019s nowhere else that I\u2019ll be,\u201d he tells you, his tone honest and genuine as he raises your hand, brushing his lips along your knuckles. \u201cI\u2019m in love with yeh. Always goin\u2019 t\u2019 be there. And someday, it\u2019ll be our turn,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI promise you.\u201d</p><p>Giving him a small nod, you smile down at him. \u201cI\u2019ll be down in a minute,\u201d you tell him, your tone lighter as you calm your previously anxious body. \u201cI promise,\u201d you assure him.</p><p>Harry sighs, \u201cYou know I\u2019m not leaving you like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Harry, I\u2019m fine,\u201d you mumble. \u201cI just \u2014 I just need some time to process it, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Harry. Please, can you just \u2014 just apologise to Gemma for me, and to your mum and Michal. I don\u2019t want to be a bitch \u2014\u201d your husband quickly cuts you off.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d he tells you firmly.</p><p>\u201c\u2014 just tell them I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018f course,\u201d he replies. \u201cWhat exactly do you want me to tell them?\u201d</p><p>You shrug. You didn\u2019t know. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d you tell him. You were torn \u2014 perhaps telling the truth would help Harry\u2019s family to understand why you reacted the way you did. Equally so, you didn\u2019t want sympathetic looks for the rest of the weekend, with people walking on eggshells around you \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t be fair to Gemma and Michal as they proudly talked about welcoming their bundle of joy into their lives within the next six months.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll never think any less of you, y\u2019know? You\u2019ll never be any different \u2014 you\u2019re still the same woman who\u2019s been there for me from day one, the same woman who makes me the happiest and proudest man on this Earth,\u201d he reassures you.</p><p>You nod, knowingly. Your husband\u2019s family had welcomed you with open arms from the first day he introduced you all to each other. From the moment they met you, they knew you would always hold a special place in Harry\u2019s heart, willing from the beginning of your relationship that you two would be lifelong partners.</p><p>He raises his hand to cup your face, his thumb skimming your cheekbone as he presses a soft kiss to your lips. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in a minute?\u201d he questions, gently.</p><p>You give him a small smile, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll just sort myself out then I\u2019ll be down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be long, yeah? I want to enjoy as much of this weekend sunshine together as we can,\u201d he smiles. He stands from his spot, giving you a supportive smile before begrudgingly leaving you alone in the bathroom, but he knows he should give you the space you deserve to comprehend recent events.</p><p>Heading down the stairs of the little Cheshire home, he makes out the words being faintly spoken, breathy voices sounding through the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI mean, did you see her face?\u201d he hears Gemma hiss, barely above a whisper, \u201cShe could barely bring herself to look at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a reasonable explanation, darling,\u201d he\u2019s grateful that his mother is defending his wife, and although he feels sympathetic towards his sister, Harry\u2019s heart breaks for his love who\u2019s locked herself away in the bathroom, secluding herself from his family \u2014 the woman he married and vowed to protect, beating herself up over something she couldn\u2019t possibly control.</p><p>\u201cWhat needs doing?\u201d Harry\u2019s voice suddenly pipes up as he enters the kitchen. He fakes a smile, but the consistency his family home continues to provide for him, the sight before him making him feel like he was a youngster once again, actually uplifts him a little.</p><p>Whilst Gemma is peeling an array of fruits in preparation for the fruit salad following the Sunday roast that was cooking in the oven, Anne begins stirring the gravy on the stove with the wooden spoon in her hand. Looking up at her son as he enters the room, she gives him a small smile. </p><p>\u201cMichal\u2019s just popped out for some more milk, so you could help your sister peel the fruit,\u201d she suggests, nodding towards the brightly coloured fresh fruits displayed - strawberries, oranges, pineapples, kiwis, plums, banana, mangoes \u2014 Anne had gone all out to ensure that family time around the table was maximised over the long weekend.</p><p>Harry nods, giving his mum a small smile before heading towards the fruit bowl.</p><p>\u201cIs everything ok, sweetheart?\u201d his mum questions gently, placing down the spoon and turning on her heel. Both her and Gemma watch Harry, their gaze burning into him as they struggle to take their eyes off of his frame.</p><p>\u201cYeah \u2014 yeah, everything\u2019s fine,\u201d he settles on his choice of words, fiddling with the orange in his hands, barely making a start on peeling the fruit he\u2019s holding.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just \u2014 she didn\u2019t seem happy about our news,\u201d Gemma murmurs, hurt coursing through her and it breaks Harry\u2019s heart that his sister can barely bring herself to speak your name aloud. \u201cI just hope I didn\u2019t offend her,\u201d she tells her brother, her expression solemn.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, God, Gem, you could never \u2014\u201d he begins, glancing at her from the corner of his eye. \u201cWe are <i>both</i> really happy for you,\u201d he speaks with sincerity, before pausing, \u201c\u2014 and the last thing we want is to overshadow what\u2019s obviously a happy time for you both \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d Anne asks, raising an eyebrow questioningly as she folds her arms across her chest.</p><p>\u201cBut, nothing,\u201d Harry shakes his head, a refusal to meet the gaze of his mum and sister.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Harry,\u201d Anne murmurs softly as she approaches the young boy from behind and rests a soft hand on his back, her palm resting between his shoulder blades as the other hand gently massages the top of his arm. \u201cI\u2019m your mother,\u201d she smiles, despite the fact that he can\u2019t see her expression. \u201cAnd regardless of the fact that you grew up well before your time and knowing so much more about the world than I do, I still know you well enough to know that everything\u2019s not fine. Talk to us, darling. We\u2019re here for you,\u201d she also gives Gemma a nod. \u201cWe\u2019re here for <i>both</i> of you,\u201d she clarifies, Anne supportive of both her son and daughter-in-law.</p><p>Harry softly chews his lip, before turning to face his mum. With glossy eyes, his bottom lip trembles before he speaks, continuing to fiddle nonchalantly with the orange. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying for months, mum,\u201d he begins, his eyes quickly finding the ceiling as he tries to prevent the sob that would escape him if he even catches a glance of a sympathetic look from either of his family members right now. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying for months and we just can\u2019t seem to get pregnant,\u201d he repeats, meeting his sisters gaze this time.</p><p>\u201cOh sweetheart,\u201d Anne whispers softly, her hand continuing to rub at her son\u2019s exposed skin, his toned muscles tensing further with the difficult conversation taking place.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying when I say we\u2019re happy for you, Gemma,\u201d he begins.</p><p>His older sister quickly shakes her head and holds up her hand, preventing her brother from continuing his sentence. \u201cHarry, honestly, it\u2019s fine,\u201d she tells him, her voice firm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry \u2014 had I have realised, I wouldn\u2019t have \u2014 God, I\u2019m so sorry, that must have been really hard for her \u2014 for you both, to hear,\u201d Gemma\u2019s considerate nature shines through.</p><p>\u201c\u2019s not your fault, yeh weren\u2019t t\u2019 know,\u201d Harry shrugs. \u201cShe just needs some time,\u201d Harry murmurs softly, his eyes finding the ceiling once more. \u201cShe asked me to apologise to you though,\u201d he gives both Anne and Gemma a small smile.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d Gemma tuts. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to her later \u2014 apologise, too,\u201d she adds.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Harry counter argues, not blaming Gemma for the day\u2019s events. He gives his sister a small nod before pulling her into a hug. \u201cI really am happy for you, sis,\u201d he smiles. \u201cWe both are.\u201d</p><p>Gemma murmurs her gratitude, reciprocating the hug, before pulling away and giving each other a supportive smile \u2014 one that was comforting in an attempt to reassure each other that, despite the occasional sibling rivalry, they will always be there for each other.</p><p>\u201cAnd how about you, darling? No doubt it\u2019s hard for both of you,\u201d Anne suddenly pipes up. \u201cIt\u2019s important for you to talk about your feelings, too, Harry. I know you only too well to see that you\u2019ll be comforting and reassuring, but not talking about how <i>you</i> feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will happen when it happens, I guess,\u201d Harry begins with a shrug. \u201cObviously I want children, too. I don\u2019t want anyone else t\u2019 be the mother of m\u2019kiddies, wouldn\u2019t \u2018ave married her otherwise,\u201d he speaks with conviction. \u201cI just \u2014 I can\u2019t handle seeing her in pieces over another negative test,\u201d he whimpers. \u201cShe suffered a phantom pregnancy a couple of months ago,\u201d he tells the two women and Anne gasps at the revelation, covering her mouth with her hand in shock. Harry\u2019s expression is pained as he exhales a shaky breath, recalling the symptoms, \u201cHer periods stopped, she was being sick \u2014 specifically in the mornings \u2014\u201d </p><p>\u201cDarling,\u201d Anne murmurs softly, pulling her son into her embrace.</p><p>\u201cWatching her go through that only to find out she wasn\u2019t pregnant, <i>Christ</i>, it practically killed her. She\u2019s already picked out baby names and been shopping for baby clothes,\u201d he adds, painful memories flooding back to him as he remembers comforting you on the day you discovered you weren\u2019t actually pregnant.</p><p>\u201cOh sweetheart,\u201d Anne\u2019s sympathetic voice fills the room. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard to hear, but you <i>are</i> right. It\u2019ll happen when it\u2019s meant to be, and maybe now just isn\u2019t the time. You haven\u2019t been married <i>that</i> long and so perhaps you should just enjoy newlywed life for a little longer. You have plenty of time,\u201d she smiles.</p><p>Harry nods, steadying himself on the kitchen counter as he holds onto the granite worktop. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I said \u2014 not to focus on trying and to just enjoy spending time together,\u201d he begins, his cheeks suddenly flushing as the words leave his lips. \u201cNo, I mean \u2014\u201d but Anne holds a hand up to stop him, nodding in understanding.</p><p>\u201cMum\u2019s right. This one wasn\u2019t exactly planned,\u201d Gemma admits, resting a hand on her stomach. \u201cAnd perhaps that\u2019s what will happen with you two. It\u2019ll happen when you least expect it. I mean, we all know you\u2019d be the best parents. Your children will want for nothing, Harry. They\u2019re going to have an amazing mummy<i> and</i> daddy who love them very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Gem,\u201d Harry smiles, his eyes glossing over once more at the emotional conversation taking place within his childhood home. Had someone told him a few years ago that not only would he be continuing with a steadily successful solo career, but he would also married to the love of his life and trying to start a family with her, he would have probably told them to \u201cpiss off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust take everything one day at a time,\u201d Anne tells him, before continuing once again, \u201c\u2014 and it will happen, darling. I promise you, it will,\u201d she assures her son, easing his obvious anxiousness.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he agrees, \u201cyeah, it will happen,\u201d smiling fondly at the thought of starting your little family together, \u201csomeday.\u201d</p>",
                "content": "<p><b>Author&rsquo;s Note</b> - basically, I&rsquo;m an idiot who, whilst trying to sort out my Masterlist, accidentally deleted this one and I am gutted because you guys had posted some really lovely comments and now they&rsquo;re gone - so I am actually really sad! Anyway, without further ado, here it is again!</p><p>So, basically, I received two requests at a similar time &mdash; and I don&rsquo;t like letting people down and cheating my way out of prompts by only doing one request. Another anon requested Number 18 &mdash; but left it up to me to decide which section to choose from, so I really hope you don&rsquo;t mind but I have incorporated these two &mdash; <b>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pregnant,&rdquo;</b> and <b>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come yet,&rdquo;</b> &mdash; but in two different parts, (with part two is still in the process of being written). It&rsquo;s been a piece that I&rsquo;ve played in my mind over and over again and these prompts gave me a good enough excuse to write and post it, so I <i>really</i> hope I&rsquo;ve done it justice for you both! So here&rsquo;s part one (and 4K of husband!harry)! And of course, stay tuned for part two!</p><p><b>Just a slight warning that this one contains sensitive material surrounding difficulties in falling pregnant and also brief mentions of phantom pregnancies, so please do not read this if you are or will be affected &mdash; and my ask box is always open if you want to talk!</b></p><p><b>Someday.</b></p><p>Spending a Bank Holiday at Anne&rsquo;s was becoming somewhat of a tradition for you as a couple, and this Spring holiday was no different. Having packed up the car on the previous Friday afternoon, you and Harry had travelled up to Holmes Chapel to spend the long weekend at your husband&rsquo;s childhood home with his family.</p><p>You had awoken, in his childhood bedroom, to the aromas of food cooking in the kitchen, knowing full well that, despite no longer having to make the effort and impress anyone, Anne would still be providing a breakfast spread.</p><p>As expected, once you were up, ready and headed downstairs, you were met with an array of delicious foods &mdash; a variety of cereals with cold milk, fresh and tinned fruits, croissants, yoghurts, hot toast and butter, quality meats from the local butcher that Harry constantly raved about, eggs, &mdash; scrambled and fried &mdash; and different juices including pineapple, orange and mango. The breakfast buffet before you felt as though you were in a five star hotel as opposed to your husband&rsquo;s family home, but nonetheless, you always appreciated Anne&rsquo;s efforts at welcoming guests into her home.</p><p>&ldquo;Morning,&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s raspy voice appears as you pour your orange juice into a glass.</p><p>You turn around to see your husband exiting the lounge through the patio doors. He stops to greet his mother, giving her a kiss on the cheek, before coming to stand behind you. He rests a hand on your hip, dropping a kiss to your jawline from behind, as a low growl leaves the base of his throat.</p><p>&ldquo;Morning, wifey,&rdquo; he murmurs.</p><p>&ldquo;Get a room, you two,&rdquo; Gemma smirks, as she too, joins you all in the garden, closely followed by Michal. &ldquo;I mean, you&rsquo;ve been married, what &mdash; three months,&rdquo; she shrugs, &ldquo;Thought you&rsquo;d have got it out of your system by now,&rdquo; she laughs.</p><p>&ldquo;Four, actually,&rdquo; Harry clarifies with a smirk, draping an arm around your shoulder as you pour him a pineapple juice and hand it to him. &ldquo;Four months, and two days,&rdquo; he specifies, waggling his ring finger in front of his sister as he takes a sip of the freshly squeezed fruit.</p><p>&ldquo;Young love,&rdquo; Anne beams. &ldquo;Could&rsquo;ve at least put a shirt on though, Mister!&rdquo; she laughs, noticing his half naked body as he seats himself on the black and white checked gingham garden furniture &mdash; a set that Harry had bought his mum for Christmas one year, despite the fact that it wouldn&rsquo;t come in handy until summertime when the weather would get warmer and the nights would become longer.</p><p>Harry shrugs, &ldquo;&rsquo;s why she married, for all this,&rdquo; he gestures towards his ink covered body.</p><p>You blush at his comment, and although it was no secret that his body art was one of the many reasons you found yourself sexually attracted to him, you had both embarked on a romantic relationship where you love each other, focussing on making each other happy, supporting each other and respecting the others&rsquo; boundaries, and working together to become best friends, lovers, soulmates, and equals.</p><p>&ldquo;Just ignore him,&rdquo; Gemma smirks. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s all mouth and no trousers,&rdquo; she adds.</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly my point, that&rsquo;s why she married me,&rdquo; he jokes once more.</p><p>Your cheeks continue to flush a deeper shade of red, and Harry rests a hand on your thigh, whispering a quick, &ldquo;&lsquo;m sorry, lovie, but we both know it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; with a smirk &mdash; and luckily for you, his comment is out of ear shot from everyone else, which you&rsquo;re only too grateful for because you&rsquo;re not sure you could handle any more embarrassment.</p><p>Within seconds, the conversation easily flows and takes a different direction. Anne discusses the weekend weather and her plans for the following week, whilst Gemma talks about her most recent article focusing on feminism, educating everyone on issues for girls around the world, something that everyone listened intently to, and as expected, Harry barely reveals any information regarding the next album.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in a minute,&rdquo; Gemma suddenly says, with a smile as she takes herself back into the house, leaving you and Harry to reminisce over your honeymoon &mdash; which despite the fact that it finished three months ago, you still couldn&rsquo;t help talking about the amazing adventures you&rsquo;d experienced together in your newlywed lifestyle.</p><p>&ldquo;It was just nice having the pool to ourselves, and the food &mdash;&rdquo; Harry practically drools as he thinks back to the Greek cuisine. &ldquo;The food was<i> amazing</i>!&rdquo; he sighs, eyes rolling as he seriously contemplates packing the car up, driving to the airport and flying you both back to Greece for an extended holiday.</p><p>&ldquo;The food was really good,&rdquo; you agree, &ldquo;But the beaches were to die for though,&rdquo; you smile, adding to the complimentary comments of the country you&rsquo;d visited together. &ldquo;They were so sandy and beautiful, it was just so peaceful,&rdquo; you tell the other two adults in front of you who listen attentively, before Gemma reappears once again, skipping out of the patio doors.</p><p>&ldquo;Happy Easter,&rdquo; she smiles, as she excitedly hands each of you a boxed chocolate egg. She gives Michal a knowing smile, regaining her position on her chair beside him and barely giving any of you the opportunity to express your gratitude, before she states, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s from the three of us,&rdquo; with a squeal.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh thanks, Gem,&rdquo; Anne&rsquo;s voice begins.</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s hand finds your thigh once again, giving you a reassuring squeeze. With his other arm slung around the back of your chair, his fingertips quickly dance on your shoulder, the thin strap to your floral summer dress giving him easy access to your bare skin. You can feel a lump form at the base of your throat as you watch Harry give you a sympathetic look from the corner of your eye as you comprehend your sister-in-law&rsquo;s words.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; Anne begins, the realisation of the conversation only just dawning, &ldquo;the three of &mdash; what &mdash; wait, you&rsquo;re pregnant?&rdquo; the older woman asks, her smile beaming as she removes her sunglasses from her face, pushing them up into her hair. </p><p>&ldquo;<b>I&rsquo;m pregnant</b>,&rdquo; Gemma confirms, resting a hand on her stomach. &ldquo;Twelves weeks,&rdquo; she clarifies.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my goodness, Gemma! Congratulations!&rdquo; Anne&rsquo;s voice chirps as she stands from her chair and shuffles her feet to the other side of the table. Pulling her daughter into her, she gives her a kiss on the cheek. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so happy for you both!&rdquo; she exclaims, before pressing a peck to Michal&rsquo;s cheek, too.</p><p>&ldquo;Congratulations,&rdquo; Harry smiles, leaning forwards in his chair and reaching across the table to shake Michal&rsquo;s hand, before giving his sister a small nod. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really happy for you,&rdquo; he adds, his smile genuine as his sister quite literally glows with happiness.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, congratulations to you both,&rdquo; you murmur softly, desperately hoping that the smile you display to the family before you is a genuine one, but with your voice laced with sadness, you&rsquo;re not even sure you&rsquo;ve convinced yourself, let alone everyone around you.</p><p>Gemma smiles, still giddy after revealing her exciting news, &ldquo;You could at least seem happy,&rdquo; she jokes lightheartedly, &ldquo;I mean, you look like you&rsquo;ve seen a ghost,&rdquo; she notes your obviously distracted expression.</p><p>You force another smile as you sense Harry&rsquo;s burning gaze on you, him watching you vigilantly as his hand reaches for your own underneath table. He interlocks his fingers with yours, comfortingly intertwining them, his thumb occasionally skimming your skin.</p><p>&ldquo;No really, I&rsquo;m happy for you &mdash; for both of you,&rdquo; you clarify.</p><p>Your answer seems to satisfy the young female, who&rsquo;s features resembles a lot of your husband&rsquo;s, and her bubbly self continues to express her enthusiasm at the happy situation. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had the twelve week scan already,&rdquo; she murmurs, &ldquo;here,&rdquo; she gestures towards Michal as her long term partner delves into his back pocket for his leather wallet.</p><p>&ldquo;Look, there&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s fingers, and there&rsquo;s it toes &mdash;&rdquo; Michal proudly displays the ultrasound picture and points out the baby&rsquo;s body parts. With his permission, Anne takes it from him, looking at the scan of her first Grandchild in awe as her fingertips trace over the glossy paper.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in a second,&rdquo; you whisper softly to Harry, pulling your hand away from his and standing from your spot. You enter the house through the opened patio doors, leaving your husband and his family in the garden as you head upstairs and away from the clearly difficult situation.</p><p>&ldquo;Is she ok?&rdquo; Anne looks up and asks her son at your sudden departure.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;m just goin&rsquo; to check on her,&rdquo; Harry murmurs softly, before giving his sister a small smile &mdash; one that appears apologetic yet also indicates that he really is happy for both her and Michal with the good news that they had shared.</p><p>Heading up the stairs of his childhood home, he runs a hand over his face and steadies his breath. Upon reaching the bathroom door, he unmistakably hears your soft sniffles and it tears at his heart strings. Lightly tapping on the door that acts as a barrier between you, his soft voice murmurs, &ldquo;Sweetheart, it&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; confirming your suspicions that your husband would of course follow you in your time of distress.</p><p>He&rsquo;s met with a deafening silence and he knows you&rsquo;re preventing the sobs you&rsquo;re holding back from escaping your lips, and that only shatters his heart further.</p><p>&ldquo;Darling, please let me in,&rdquo; he begs. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to be alone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, I&rsquo;m fine. Go back downstairs &mdash; I&rsquo;ll be out in a minute,&rdquo; you assure him.</p><p>He sighs heavily, licking his lips. &ldquo;Darling, open the door,&rdquo; he simply states. You should know by now that he wouldn&rsquo;t leave you alone, especially when you&rsquo;re crying &mdash; God, he really hates it when you cry &mdash; and you know there&rsquo;s no point in arguing against him. The moment his hand rests upon the doorknob, he hears you unlocking it from the inside.</p><p>He emits a sigh of relief, grateful that you&rsquo;ll allow him to comfort you in your time of need.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, angel,&rdquo; he murmurs softly, as he enters the bathroom. &ldquo;Oh sweetheart,&rdquo; he breathes, as he takes in your demeanour. You&rsquo;re sat on the edge of the bath, your cheeks blotchy and your eyes red and puffy from the crying, as the taste of salt lingers on your lips.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; you mumble, wiping away the tears with the back of your hand.</p><p>Locking the door behind him, your husband shakes his head. &ldquo;No, poppet. Never apologise.&rdquo; Harry comes to kneel in front of you, his hands resting atop of your knees as he pouts his lips, his eyes glossing over at the sight of you. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s hard, darling &mdash;&rdquo; he begins, but stops himself when you shake your head.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy for her, Harry, I really am. I&rsquo;m happy for both of them,&rdquo; you clarify.</p><p>&ldquo;I know you are, sweetheart, I didn&rsquo;t think otherwise,&rdquo; he tells you matter of factly.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just &mdash; it&rsquo;s horrible, you know? Seeing and hearing everyone else around us announcing their pregnancies and having babies, and we can&rsquo;t even get pregnant,&rdquo; you sigh, sniffling. &ldquo;Why is it taking so long?&rdquo; you ask, your bottom lip trembling once more.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, poppet, calm down for me, yeah?&rdquo; he pleads, bringing his hands up to cup your face, his thumb wiping away the tears that continue to spill over. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll happen when it happens, yeah? There&rsquo;s no reason why we can&rsquo;t get pregnant, sometimes these things just take time,&rdquo; he speaks with conviction.</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; your lip trembles once more as your husband intertwines his fingers within your own.</p><p>&ldquo;How about we take a break?&rdquo; he hesitantly suggests, licking his plush lips as he simultaneously skims the skin of your hands with his fingertips. &ldquo;For a little while, at least,&rdquo; he adds, finally resting his eyes on your features once more, in an attempt to read your expression.</p><p>You frown in confusion at Harry&rsquo;s words, pouting your lips slightly until you comprehend the meaning behind them. &ldquo;What &mdash; no,&rdquo; you tell him adamantly, vigorously shaking your head and tugging at your hands, although seemingly struggling at removing them from your husband&rsquo;s grasp as he tightens his hold on you.</p><p>&ldquo;Not permanently,&rdquo; he clarifies, sensing your fear and panic. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying that we won&rsquo;t try, but how about we don&rsquo;t actually focus on the trying, so much?&rdquo; he proposes the idea that&rsquo;s been swimming around his head the past few weeks. &ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ve spent so much time trying for a baby, that we haven&rsquo;t been focussed on enjoying making love to each other,&rdquo; he tells you with a sad smile.</p><p>Your bottom lip trembles once again. You know your husband is right. The first attempts at trying for a baby were fun &mdash; you couldn&rsquo;t deny that the sex was amazing and you and Harry took every opportunity to love on each other. But within the most recent months where falling pregnant was proving to be unsuccessful, you had become obsessive over fertility trackers, and sex was becoming a chore as opposed to spending quality time of making love to each other.</p><p>&ldquo;How about we have a little trip away somewhere?&rdquo; he suggests gently, his thumb continuing to brush over your shaking hands. &ldquo;Italy, or Paris, perhaps,&rdquo; he continues. &ldquo;It might take our mind off of things for a while, and we could even make it our second honeymoon,&rdquo; he smirks cheekily.</p><p>Having only been married for four months, your special day was still imprinted in both of your minds, and whilst you had enjoyed your three week honeymoon in Greece, exploring the beaches and taking advantage of the alone time you had together, Harry had assured you that he would take you to other parts of the world and love on you even more, making it clear that &ldquo;one honeymoon just isn&rsquo;t enough.&rdquo;</p><p>A breathy laugh escapes your lips before they break into a smile. </p><p>&ldquo;There it is,&rdquo; he murmurs softly, his expression happier now that you&rsquo;re smiling back at him. &ldquo;Miss that smile, angel. Need t&rsquo; see it more often, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>You nod. &ldquo;&lsquo;m sorry &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Harry cuts you off, pressing his forefinger to your lips. &ldquo;Stop apologising, doll. It&rsquo;s been a bit of a shitty time recently, and you have nothing to be sorry for.&rdquo;</p><p>Again, you realise there&rsquo;s no point in arguing with your husband &mdash; sometimes you hate to admit how often he&rsquo;s right. &ldquo;I know, it&rsquo;s just &mdash; you&rsquo;ve been amazing,&rdquo; you tell him, resting a hand on his cheek. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve put up with so much &mdash; so many tears and &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Harry shakes his head. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my wife, I&rsquo;m always going to be there for you, darling. Never doubt that, yeah? There&rsquo;s nowhere else that I&rsquo;ll be,&rdquo; he tells you, his tone honest and genuine as he raises your hand, brushing his lips along your knuckles. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in love with yeh. Always goin&rsquo; t&rsquo; be there. And someday, it&rsquo;ll be our turn,&rdquo; he smiles. &ldquo;I promise you.&rdquo;</p><p>Giving him a small nod, you smile down at him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be down in a minute,&rdquo; you tell him, your tone lighter as you calm your previously anxious body. &ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; you assure him.</p><p>Harry sighs, &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m not leaving you like this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please, Harry, I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; you mumble. &ldquo;I just &mdash; I just need some time to process it, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sweetheart &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, Harry. Please, can you just &mdash; just apologise to Gemma for me, and to your mum and Michal. I don&rsquo;t want to be a bitch &mdash;&rdquo; your husband quickly cuts you off.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; he tells you firmly.</p><p>&ldquo;&mdash; just tell them I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;f course,&rdquo; he replies. &ldquo;What exactly do you want me to tell them?&rdquo;</p><p>You shrug. You didn&rsquo;t know. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; you tell him. You were torn &mdash; perhaps telling the truth would help Harry&rsquo;s family to understand why you reacted the way you did. Equally so, you didn&rsquo;t want sympathetic looks for the rest of the weekend, with people walking on eggshells around you &mdash; that wouldn&rsquo;t be fair to Gemma and Michal as they proudly talked about welcoming their bundle of joy into their lives within the next six months.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll never think any less of you, y&rsquo;know? You&rsquo;ll never be any different &mdash; you&rsquo;re still the same woman who&rsquo;s been there for me from day one, the same woman who makes me the happiest and proudest man on this Earth,&rdquo; he reassures you.</p><p>You nod, knowingly. Your husband&rsquo;s family had welcomed you with open arms from the first day he introduced you all to each other. From the moment they met you, they knew you would always hold a special place in Harry&rsquo;s heart, willing from the beginning of your relationship that you two would be lifelong partners.</p><p>He raises his hand to cup your face, his thumb skimming your cheekbone as he presses a soft kiss to your lips. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you in a minute?&rdquo; he questions, gently.</p><p>You give him a small smile, &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;ll just sort myself out then I&rsquo;ll be down.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be long, yeah? I want to enjoy as much of this weekend sunshine together as we can,&rdquo; he smiles. He stands from his spot, giving you a supportive smile before begrudgingly leaving you alone in the bathroom, but he knows he should give you the space you deserve to comprehend recent events.</p><p>Heading down the stairs of the little Cheshire home, he makes out the words being faintly spoken, breathy voices sounding through the kitchen.</p><p>&ldquo;I mean, did you see her face?&rdquo; he hears Gemma hiss, barely above a whisper, &ldquo;She could barely bring herself to look at me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a reasonable explanation, darling,&rdquo; he&rsquo;s grateful that his mother is defending his wife, and although he feels sympathetic towards his sister, Harry&rsquo;s heart breaks for his love who&rsquo;s locked herself away in the bathroom, secluding herself from his family &mdash; the woman he married and vowed to protect, beating herself up over something she couldn&rsquo;t possibly control.</p><p>&ldquo;What needs doing?&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s voice suddenly pipes up as he enters the kitchen. He fakes a smile, but the consistency his family home continues to provide for him, the sight before him making him feel like he was a youngster once again, actually uplifts him a little.</p><p>Whilst Gemma is peeling an array of fruits in preparation for the fruit salad following the Sunday roast that was cooking in the oven, Anne begins stirring the gravy on the stove with the wooden spoon in her hand. Looking up at her son as he enters the room, she gives him a small smile. </p><p>&ldquo;Michal&rsquo;s just popped out for some more milk, so you could help your sister peel the fruit,&rdquo; she suggests, nodding towards the brightly coloured fresh fruits displayed - strawberries, oranges, pineapples, kiwis, plums, banana, mangoes &mdash; Anne had gone all out to ensure that family time around the table was maximised over the long weekend.</p><p>Harry nods, giving his mum a small smile before heading towards the fruit bowl.</p><p>&ldquo;Is everything ok, sweetheart?&rdquo; his mum questions gently, placing down the spoon and turning on her heel. Both her and Gemma watch Harry, their gaze burning into him as they struggle to take their eyes off of his frame.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah &mdash; yeah, everything&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; he settles on his choice of words, fiddling with the orange in his hands, barely making a start on peeling the fruit he&rsquo;s holding.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just &mdash; she didn&rsquo;t seem happy about our news,&rdquo; Gemma murmurs, hurt coursing through her and it breaks Harry&rsquo;s heart that his sister can barely bring herself to speak your name aloud. &ldquo;I just hope I didn&rsquo;t offend her,&rdquo; she tells her brother, her expression solemn.</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, God, Gem, you could never &mdash;&rdquo; he begins, glancing at her from the corner of his eye. &ldquo;We are <i>both</i> really happy for you,&rdquo; he speaks with sincerity, before pausing, &ldquo;&mdash; and the last thing we want is to overshadow what&rsquo;s obviously a happy time for you both &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But?&rdquo; Anne asks, raising an eyebrow questioningly as she folds her arms across her chest.</p><p>&ldquo;But, nothing,&rdquo; Harry shakes his head, a refusal to meet the gaze of his mum and sister.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, Harry,&rdquo; Anne murmurs softly as she approaches the young boy from behind and rests a soft hand on his back, her palm resting between his shoulder blades as the other hand gently massages the top of his arm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m your mother,&rdquo; she smiles, despite the fact that he can&rsquo;t see her expression. &ldquo;And regardless of the fact that you grew up well before your time and knowing so much more about the world than I do, I still know you well enough to know that everything&rsquo;s not fine. Talk to us, darling. We&rsquo;re here for you,&rdquo; she also gives Gemma a nod. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here for <i>both</i> of you,&rdquo; she clarifies, Anne supportive of both her son and daughter-in-law.</p><p>Harry softly chews his lip, before turning to face his mum. With glossy eyes, his bottom lip trembles before he speaks, continuing to fiddle nonchalantly with the orange. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been trying for months, mum,&rdquo; he begins, his eyes quickly finding the ceiling as he tries to prevent the sob that would escape him if he even catches a glance of a sympathetic look from either of his family members right now. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been trying for months and we just can&rsquo;t seem to get pregnant,&rdquo; he repeats, meeting his sisters gaze this time.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh sweetheart,&rdquo; Anne whispers softly, her hand continuing to rub at her son&rsquo;s exposed skin, his toned muscles tensing further with the difficult conversation taking place.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not lying when I say we&rsquo;re happy for you, Gemma,&rdquo; he begins.</p><p>His older sister quickly shakes her head and holds up her hand, preventing her brother from continuing his sentence. &ldquo;Harry, honestly, it&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; she tells him, her voice firm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry &mdash; had I have realised, I wouldn&rsquo;t have &mdash; God, I&rsquo;m so sorry, that must have been really hard for her &mdash; for you both, to hear,&rdquo; Gemma&rsquo;s considerate nature shines through.</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;s not your fault, yeh weren&rsquo;t t&rsquo; know,&rdquo; Harry shrugs. &ldquo;She just needs some time,&rdquo; Harry murmurs softly, his eyes finding the ceiling once more. &ldquo;She asked me to apologise to you though,&rdquo; he gives both Anne and Gemma a small smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly,&rdquo; Gemma tuts. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to her later &mdash; apologise, too,&rdquo; she adds.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Harry counter argues, not blaming Gemma for the day&rsquo;s events. He gives his sister a small nod before pulling her into a hug. &ldquo;I really am happy for you, sis,&rdquo; he smiles. &ldquo;We both are.&rdquo;</p><p>Gemma murmurs her gratitude, reciprocating the hug, before pulling away and giving each other a supportive smile &mdash; one that was comforting in an attempt to reassure each other that, despite the occasional sibling rivalry, they will always be there for each other.</p><p>&ldquo;And how about you, darling? No doubt it&rsquo;s hard for both of you,&rdquo; Anne suddenly pipes up. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important for you to talk about your feelings, too, Harry. I know you only too well to see that you&rsquo;ll be comforting and reassuring, but not talking about how <i>you</i> feel.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It will happen when it happens, I guess,&rdquo; Harry begins with a shrug. &ldquo;Obviously I want children, too. I don&rsquo;t want anyone else t&rsquo; be the mother of m&rsquo;kiddies, wouldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;ave married her otherwise,&rdquo; he speaks with conviction. &ldquo;I just &mdash; I can&rsquo;t handle seeing her in pieces over another negative test,&rdquo; he whimpers. &ldquo;She suffered a phantom pregnancy a couple of months ago,&rdquo; he tells the two women and Anne gasps at the revelation, covering her mouth with her hand in shock. Harry&rsquo;s expression is pained as he exhales a shaky breath, recalling the symptoms, &ldquo;Her periods stopped, she was being sick &mdash; specifically in the mornings &mdash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Darling,&rdquo; Anne murmurs softly, pulling her son into her embrace.</p><p>&ldquo;Watching her go through that only to find out she wasn&rsquo;t pregnant, <i>Christ</i>, it practically killed her. She&rsquo;s already picked out baby names and been shopping for baby clothes,&rdquo; he adds, painful memories flooding back to him as he remembers comforting you on the day you discovered you weren&rsquo;t actually pregnant.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh sweetheart,&rdquo; Anne&rsquo;s sympathetic voice fills the room. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s hard to hear, but you <i>are</i> right. It&rsquo;ll happen when it&rsquo;s meant to be, and maybe now just isn&rsquo;t the time. You haven&rsquo;t been married <i>that</i> long and so perhaps you should just enjoy newlywed life for a little longer. You have plenty of time,&rdquo; she smiles.</p><p>Harry nods, steadying himself on the kitchen counter as he holds onto the granite worktop. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I said &mdash; not to focus on trying and to just enjoy spending time together,&rdquo; he begins, his cheeks suddenly flushing as the words leave his lips. &ldquo;No, I mean &mdash;&rdquo; but Anne holds a hand up to stop him, nodding in understanding.</p><p>&ldquo;Mum&rsquo;s right. This one wasn&rsquo;t exactly planned,&rdquo; Gemma admits, resting a hand on her stomach. &ldquo;And perhaps that&rsquo;s what will happen with you two. It&rsquo;ll happen when you least expect it. I mean, we all know you&rsquo;d be the best parents. Your children will want for nothing, Harry. They&rsquo;re going to have an amazing mummy<i> and</i> daddy who love them very much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, Gem,&rdquo; Harry smiles, his eyes glossing over once more at the emotional conversation taking place within his childhood home. Had someone told him a few years ago that not only would he be continuing with a steadily successful solo career, but he would also married to the love of his life and trying to start a family with her, he would have probably told them to &ldquo;piss off.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just take everything one day at a time,&rdquo; Anne tells him, before continuing once again, &ldquo;&mdash; and it will happen, darling. I promise you, it will,&rdquo; she assures her son, easing his obvious anxiousness.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he agrees, &ldquo;yeah, it will happen,&rdquo; smiling fondly at the thought of starting your little family together, &ldquo;someday.&rdquo;</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p><b>Author&rsquo;s Note</b> - basically, I&rsquo;m an idiot who, whilst trying to sort out my Masterlist, accidentally deleted this one and I am gutted because you guys had posted some really lovely comments and now they&rsquo;re gone - so I am actually really sad! Anyway, without further ado, here it is again!</p>\n<p>So, basically, I received two requests at a similar time &mdash; and I don&rsquo;t like letting people down and cheating my way out of prompts by only doing one request. Another anon requested Number 18 &mdash; but left it up to me to decide which section to choose from, so I really hope you don&rsquo;t mind but I have incorporated these two &mdash; <b>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pregnant,&rdquo;</b> and <b>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come yet,&rdquo;</b> &mdash; but in two different parts, (with part two is still in the process of being written). It&rsquo;s been a piece that I&rsquo;ve played in my mind over and over again and these prompts gave me a good enough excuse to write and post it, so I <i>really</i> hope I&rsquo;ve done it justice for you both! So here&rsquo;s part one (and 4K of husband!harry)! And of course, stay tuned for part two!</p>\n<p><b>Just a slight warning that this one contains sensitive material surrounding difficulties in falling pregnant and also brief mentions of phantom pregnancies, so please do not read this if you are or will be affected &mdash; and my ask box is always open if you want to talk!</b></p>\n<p><b>Someday.</b></p>\n<p>Spending a Bank Holiday at Anne&rsquo;s was becoming somewhat of a tradition for you as a couple, and this Spring holiday was no different. Having packed up the car on the previous Friday afternoon, you and Harry had travelled up to Holmes Chapel to spend the long weekend at your husband&rsquo;s childhood home with his family.</p>\n<p>You had awoken, in his childhood bedroom, to the aromas of food cooking in the kitchen, knowing full well that, despite no longer having to make the effort and impress anyone, Anne would still be providing a breakfast spread.</p>\n<p>As expected, once you were up, ready and headed downstairs, you were met with an array of delicious foods &mdash; a variety of cereals with cold milk, fresh and tinned fruits, croissants, yoghurts, hot toast and butter, quality meats from the local butcher that Harry constantly raved about, eggs, &mdash; scrambled and fried &mdash; and different juices including pineapple, orange and mango. The breakfast buffet before you felt as though you were in a five star hotel as opposed to your husband&rsquo;s family home, but nonetheless, you always appreciated Anne&rsquo;s efforts at welcoming guests into her home.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Morning,&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s raspy voice appears as you pour your orange juice into a glass.</p>\n<p>You turn around to see your husband exiting the lounge through the patio doors. He stops to greet his mother, giving her a kiss on the cheek, before coming to stand behind you. He rests a hand on your hip, dropping a kiss to your jawline from behind, as a low growl leaves the base of his throat.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Morning, wifey,&rdquo; he murmurs.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Get a room, you two,&rdquo; Gemma smirks, as she too, joins you all in the garden, closely followed by Michal. &ldquo;I mean, you&rsquo;ve been married, what &mdash; three months,&rdquo; she shrugs, &ldquo;Thought you&rsquo;d have got it out of your system by now,&rdquo; she laughs.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Four, actually,&rdquo; Harry clarifies with a smirk, draping an arm around your shoulder as you pour him a pineapple juice and hand it to him. &ldquo;Four months, and two days,&rdquo; he specifies, waggling his ring finger in front of his sister as he takes a sip of the freshly squeezed fruit.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Young love,&rdquo; Anne beams. &ldquo;Could&rsquo;ve at least put a shirt on though, Mister!&rdquo; she laughs, noticing his half naked body as he seats himself on the black and white checked gingham garden furniture &mdash; a set that Harry had bought his mum for Christmas one year, despite the fact that it wouldn&rsquo;t come in handy until summertime when the weather would get warmer and the nights would become longer.</p>\n<p>Harry shrugs, &ldquo;&rsquo;s why she married, for all this,&rdquo; he gestures towards his ink covered body.</p>\n<p>You blush at his comment, and although it was no secret that his body art was one of the many reasons you found yourself sexually attracted to him, you had both embarked on a romantic relationship where you love each other, focussing on making each other happy, supporting each other and respecting the others&rsquo; boundaries, and working together to become best friends, lovers, soulmates, and equals.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Just ignore him,&rdquo; Gemma smirks. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s all mouth and no trousers,&rdquo; she adds.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Exactly my point, that&rsquo;s why she married me,&rdquo; he jokes once more.</p>\n<p>Your cheeks continue to flush a deeper shade of red, and Harry rests a hand on your thigh, whispering a quick, &ldquo;&lsquo;m sorry, lovie, but we both know it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; with a smirk &mdash; and luckily for you, his comment is out of ear shot from everyone else, which you&rsquo;re only too grateful for because you&rsquo;re not sure you could handle any more embarrassment.</p>\n<p>Within seconds, the conversation easily flows and takes a different direction. Anne discusses the weekend weather and her plans for the following week, whilst Gemma talks about her most recent article focusing on feminism, educating everyone on issues for girls around the world, something that everyone listened intently to, and as expected, Harry barely reveals any information regarding the next album.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in a minute,&rdquo; Gemma suddenly says, with a smile as she takes herself back into the house, leaving you and Harry to reminisce over your honeymoon &mdash; which despite the fact that it finished three months ago, you still couldn&rsquo;t help talking about the amazing adventures you&rsquo;d experienced together in your newlywed lifestyle.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It was just nice having the pool to ourselves, and the food &mdash;&rdquo; Harry practically drools as he thinks back to the Greek cuisine. &ldquo;The food was<i> amazing</i>!&rdquo; he sighs, eyes rolling as he seriously contemplates packing the car up, driving to the airport and flying you both back to Greece for an extended holiday.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The food was really good,&rdquo; you agree, &ldquo;But the beaches were to die for though,&rdquo; you smile, adding to the complimentary comments of the country you&rsquo;d visited together. &ldquo;They were so sandy and beautiful, it was just so peaceful,&rdquo; you tell the other two adults in front of you who listen attentively, before Gemma reappears once again, skipping out of the patio doors.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Happy Easter,&rdquo; she smiles, as she excitedly hands each of you a boxed chocolate egg. She gives Michal a knowing smile, regaining her position on her chair beside him and barely giving any of you the opportunity to express your gratitude, before she states, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s from the three of us,&rdquo; with a squeal.</p>\n</p>",
