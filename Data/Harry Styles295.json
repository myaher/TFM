He\u2019s found the perfect place to disappear, a tucked away corner in the shade of a large elm tree, a refuge from the constant commotion of the festival happening around him. It\u2019s only the first day and he\u2019s seen about 30 people carted away on makeshift stretchers either due to heat stroke, dehydration or too much LSD, about two thirds of them most likely suffering from all three. Scoping out the bodies swaying barefoot to the tune up of an electric guitar, he lets his mind wander. To this morning, finally dragging himself out of the body-sized indent in his bed. To last night, lying beneath the stars on the hood of his 1957 Cadillac, soft palms resting right on the hot metal as if it could burn the fingerprints right off his body. As if it could burn the existence right out of him.</p><p>To last month and the letter in the mail that changed the coursing river of his fate. The swiftness of the water sludged down to a motionless one, not a ripple to be seen for miles. He thought back to the letter, written in blue ink, written five states away in a room he\u2019s never seen before. She sat in that unfamiliar room, on an unfamiliar chair and whipped out the most formal stationary she owned and proceeded to cross her T\u2019s and dot her I\u2019s and break his heart. She used to spray her letters with his favorite perfume of hers so that when they arrived they would carry a sweet reminder; that she remembered the small details about him, that she remembered enough of him to call it love. </p><p>When the mailman unceremoniously dropped the pile of bills and subscriptions and a single handwritten letter onto his entryway floor he didn\u2019t know he would spend the rest of the day in his room, on his bed, staring at the blazing summer sun making its way across his wall. The letter, adorned with drying tear stains that marred the pretty blue cursive, was absent of any faint trace of lemon. It was more bitter than the words that played on repeat in his mind, a record player skipping on the ugliest part of the song and distorting itself into a continuous screech. Words saying over and over again, \u201cit\u2019s not you, it\u2019s the distance\u201d. As if she wasn\u2019t the one who created the distance in the first place. </p><p>The unmistakable sound of a cheering crowd brought him back to the present. Harry felt the grass poking at the tender skin of his hands as he ran them back and forth lazily to the music emitting from the speakers. A band he didn\u2019t know the name of just walked on stage and everyone went wild, tipping their beers and sloshing the beverage all over the ground below them. He frowned, looking across the littered lawn at the variety of trash blanketing the green earth. Piles of cups, cans and bottles discarded, cigarette butts and clipped joints burned amongst wrappers of fast food and flyers showcasing the lineups for the day. He thought it was such an unnecessary thing to do as the large dumpsters lining the perimeters stood empty and void of their purpose. It was unfair. And he suddenly felt a great need to do something about it. Anything to get his mind off her.</p><p>Harry stood to his feet and brushed off the back of his pants so they would be free of dirt, ignoring the inevitable grass stains on his dark grey corduroys, and fixed the red bandanna tied loosely around his collar. He took off in the direction of the largest trash pile. He hadn\u2019t even wanted to be here. He loved music, sure, but he bought these tickets months ago with his friends with the money he saved from his shoveling side job during the winter when things were drastically different. He\u2019s been mentally preparing himself for the amazing experience he would soon have at dear old Woodstock. He planned everything down to the minute but what he hadn\u2019t planned on was his girlfriend of 2 years to up and cut all forms of ties she had with him, which nowadays were only came in a weekly letter due to her having moved miles away. He couldn\u2019t even enjoy himself here, couldn\u2019t allow the music to wash over him in that special healing way it did when he heard a spectacular guitar riff or felt the beat of the drums sync up with his pulse. </p><p>So he grabbed a leaf bag that lined one of the smaller garbages towards the center of the festival and walked around, picking up single pieces of wayward trash before moving to the more compact piles. He didn\u2019t realize how far he\u2019d walked until his bag was filled to the brim with a plethora of waste and his arms started to ache in protest. Half carrying and half dragging the bag, he headed over to the industrial dumpsters and wrangled the ballooned bag over the top of the container. A hot and soupy liquid leaked onto his chest in the process and he recoiled, dropping half of the bags contents back on the ground. He groaned and with a dejected sigh and began to pick it all up again. When he straightened at the waist, he felt a pair of eyes boring holes into his back. He shrugged off the feeling as there were obviously a lot of eyes in the vicinity today and successfully got rid of the garbage once and for all. </p><p>Turning around, Harry made eye contact with a girl about 100 feet away. She looked to be around his age, maybe younger, holding a trash picker in one hand and a nearly full black garbage bag in the other. In a quick once over he notices long black hair trailing onto the ruffled shoulders of a white floral blouse that ended at the waistband of dark brown bell bottoms, giving way to thickly strapped sandals peeking underneath the fabric. She gives him a wide smile and throws up a peace sign, her chubby fingers clad with an assortment of rings on each one. He thought it must be difficult to use the picker with the clunky bands of metal hitting the switch every other second to open up the claws at the end when they didn\u2019t need to be opened up. He tilts his head slightly to the side and furrowing his brows he lets a small, tight smile take over his face. She must\u2019ve thought he was a fellow advocate for Mother Earth like her. He wasn\u2019t really. He just needed something to do.</p><p>Averting her gaze, he finds his way through the disjointed crowds in search of his friends, Eric and Johnny. He was hoping he could see Eric\u2019s circular afro bopping above the sea of bouncing heads or Johnny\u2019s tremendously long arms flailing out of rhythm to the heavy music sounding out through the trees. He was ready to go and they had all taken Harry\u2019s car to Woodstock. Fumbling with his keys, he saw a familiar body going hard in the middle of a mosh pit, semi greasy pieces of hair flying about Johnny\u2019s face as his bony elbows found a different target to impale every two seconds. Taking a deep breath and squaring his shoulders, Harry braved the pit. His feet were being crushed every time he took a step and he stopped just outside of the core of the mosh, hanging low in the outer edge. He called out his friends name. </p><p>\u201cJohnny! Johnny Menzel!\u201d Harry repeated his name until the letters no longer made sense and his name no longer sounded like a word. Johnny was too caught up in the music. Harry wishes he could throw away his brain, wishes he could actually enjoy himself this weekend but alas. Here he was, wanting to go home to sulk in his bed after only three hours at the festival. They were supposed to go all night, him and his friends, even after the acts had finished their gigs. He told them he would stay for them because they knew he was going through the ringer at the moment and he wanted to be that reliable Harry he was, not this flakey, emotional Harry. But here he was, going back on his word. Harry traveled further into the dense crowd of flying limbs and swirling hair and tugged on Johnny\u2019s shoulder, turning him around to face him. </p><p>\u201cHarry! Fancy seeing you here dude,\u201d Johnny exclaimed, brushing a sweaty strand of dirt colored hair out of his eyes in order to see his friend. Red rimmed the translucent blue irises, eyelids drooping heavily over them as a cheesy grin found its way onto his face. Harry resisted the urge to roll his eyes. Johnny was having fun, everyone around him was having fun. So why couldn\u2019t he? Johnny had four months of rent to worry about that was due in two days but here he was, head banging to some obscure band amidst total strangers with their own problems. Maybe that was the way to let forget about it; smoke a whole lot of weed and let your body do all the thinking. Harry felt he couldn\u2019t even do that, though. He just wanted to go home.</p><p>One look at Harry\u2019s face and Johnny could tell what he was thinking. Shaking his head quickly, he backed away from Harry with his palms up and started to walk over to the canteen where they were selling bottled water for outrageous prices. Harry followed him and watched as he whistled and started picking at the bush next to the table, seemingly interested in its foliage. Harry knew what he was doing, having seen this same scene play out hundreds of times. The person in the chair counting money didn\u2019t notice when Johnny swiped a cold bottle from the row and strutted away, Harry scoffing and trailing behind. </p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Harry says, catching up to Johnny. \u201cI\u2019ll stay the whole day tomorrow, I promise. I just can\u2019t today. It\u2019s too hot and&hellip;loud,\u201d Harry finished, grasping for any excuse and coming up short. Of course it\u2019s loud and sweaty. They\u2019re at a music festival. In the middle of August.</p><p>Johnny could hear the absolute bullshit in his words and whirled around, placing a cold and condensated hand on Harry\u2019s shoulder, chugging half of the water in one gulp before opening his mouth. \u201cYeah, because that\u2019s totally the reason you want to leave before Janis Joplin comes on stage. You know, the quote unquote love of your short lived life? The woman you\u2019ve obsessed over since you knew what a boner was?\u201d Harry smacked Johnny\u2019s hand off his shoulder, suppressing an intense blush before groaning. He should know by now to never tell his friends anything about himself.</p><p>\u201cMan, I told you that in confidence,\u201d Harry whines. </p><p>\u201cYou were drunk off your ass and announced that Janis Joplin gave you musical hard ons to a garage full of people. Don\u2019t act all scandalized. You do it to yourself,\u201d Johnny quips. \u201cAnyway,\u201d he continues animatedly. \u201cEric and I told you we were going to <i>drag</i> you out of that house if it was the last thing we did. And we did it. You can\u2019t stay in that musty room anymore. I get that you\u2019re hurt, man, I really do,\u201d Harry crosses his arms at this statement but that doesn\u2019t deter Johnny. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been talking about this forever! I should\u2019ve spent most of this money on rent but here I am, getting paid in <i>experience</i>. This is too groovy man, and you\u2019re making it seem like a chore,\u201d Johnny ends his miniature rant with a pouty bottom lip and what seems like a stab at a comforting voice but all it sounds like to Harry is pitying. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going home,\u201d Harry announces, choosing to ignore the well meaning monologue. He jingles his keys in front of Johnny\u2019s face, the 8 ball accesory almost making contact with his aquiline nose.\u201dWith or without you guys.\u201d Johnny rears his head back.</p><p>\u201cLooks like it\u2019s without then. I\u2019m going to go find Eric. And together we will find a ride. If not, we\u2019ll just sleep on a bench or something. Maybe even on the wet grass,\u201d he says, letting out an exaggerated gasp. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the experience,\u201d Johnny says, before turning on his heel in search of the third staple friend in their group. Harry knows he shouldn\u2019t feel betrayed by them. It would be unfair with all the moping they\u2019ve put up with and all the times they smoked a bowl on Eric\u2019s roof and Harry talked for hours and hours about her. Her pointy ears, her dainty wrists, her brown eyes he wanted to sow seeds in, watch flowers grow out of. Yeah, he was high. He was also sad. And they knew it. They sat there and let him talk for as long as he wanted to, even until the sun came up. They were good friends, he reminded himself on the way to his car. They just wanted to have fun. </p><p>Shoving his key into the ignition, he felt the Cadillac roar to life. He spent a full year working on this car, restoring it to its former glory. He loved his baby, even gave her a name: Candace. It wasn\u2019t too creative but it was something to call his own. Putting his car into reverse and letting his foot off the break, he slowly rolled backwards out of his hazardous parking space, in his own little world. He regretted being to lazy to check his blindspot when he heard a dull thud and a grunt, the sound of numerous object falling to the ground. Harry\u2019s eyes widened as he put the car in park, scrambling for the door handle. He missed the lock three times before successfully disarming it and opening the door. He hesitantly made his way to the back of Candace, heart racing. He just hit someone. </p><p>In the two seconds it took to get to the bumper, Harry\u2019s thought process went something like this; <i>Oh my god. I just hit someone with my car. I\u2019m in so much shit. Deep shit. Center of the Earth shit. They\u2019ll sue me. Wait, what if they\u2019re can\u2019t sue me because they\u2019re dead? I wasn\u2019t going that fast, was I? What if they hit their head on Candace on the way down to their demise? What if there\u2019s blood? I can\u2019t handle blood! Oh my god, I\u2019m going the throw up ohmygodohmygodohmygod. </i></p><p>Rounding the back of the car (and discretely flicking his gaze to the headlight for any sign of damage), he sees a familiar pair of thick and strappy sandals and his heart drops even more. It was Hippie Girl he just mowed over with his car. He stands there, frozen as she begins to stir, loud groans escaping her lips. She tries to sit up and Harry finally moves, rushing over and dropping to his knees, making sure to cradle her head so she doesn\u2019t hurt anything else. </p><p>Upon opening her eyes, his breath catches. They\u2019re the deepest shade of brown he\u2019s ever seen and it chills him to the bone. It\u2019s an unsettling stare. Various emotions pass over her face like clouds in the sky ranging from shock, confusion, pain and then finally, anger. She winces and takes a stuttered breath, opening up her deeply bowed mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat the <i>hell</i> just happened,\u201d she questions angrily. Her thick brows furrow and dimple her forehead in the process. She turns her dark eyes left and right as if to gather her bearings before connecting with his, a recognizance sparking to life behind them like a flame. He gulps, praying silently for the Earth to swallow him up. </p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Harry drawls out, unsure of how to say it. \u201cI kind of backed into you with Candace. But not on purpose! I was&hellip;changing the radio station,\u201d he lies, not wanting to seem like a wack job that doesn\u2019t deserve his license. \u201cI am so, so, so, so, so incredibly, terribly sorry. Here let me help you.\u201d</p><p>With one hand on her back and the other wrapped around her wrist, he gently helps her up. As soon as she rises to her feet, she swats his hands away. Grimacing, she rotates her neck side to side and finds that it\u2019s only a bit sore and still capable of full motion. Testing out the rest of her body, she stretches out her limbs, flinching slightly when she takes a step forward. Lifting her shirt to expose her hip where Harry assumes he hit with his car, he sees the start of a nasty bruise spreading into the waist of her dark brown jeans the same time she does. Lifting her head, he sees her face turn red with anger. A sharp inhale leaves both of their mouths. <i>Uh oh,</i> Harry thinks to himself. <i>I\u2019m definitely getting sued. </i></p><p>The Hippie Girl starts mumbling under her breath. </p><p>\u201cUh, what are you doing?\u201d Harry asks uneasily. He really didn\u2019t feel like getting cursed by your run of the mill Woodstock Witch, no matter how much he deserved it. She ignores him and \u00a0turns her focus to the trash bag lying half empty in the dirt, its contents splayed all around them, many having rolled under nearby cars. She closes her eyes in defeat. Harry, feeling awful, hurriedly bends down to pick up all the garbage he can fit into his arms, not caring this time around if any mysterious liquid drips onto him. </p><p>Stuffing the armful of random waste into the bag at her feet, he hears what she\u2019s saying. He stays crouched, cocking his head. She\u2019s not saying any words, just counting. The numbers drop down from one hundred in threes, it seems. He pauses to listens. <i>97, 94, 91, 88, 85, 82</i>\u2026The numbers stop suddenly at 79 and he looks up to see her looking at him, almost black eyes narrowed. He straightens up quickly, clearing his throat. \u201cListen,\u201d he says frantically. \u201cYou have to understand how sorry I am. I\u2019m not usually the type of guy who goes around running over girls with his car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would hope not,\u201d she shoots back. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky I have somewhere to be or else I would really be laying into you, dude. Changing radio stations? Really? Are you that shitty of a driver?\u201d She puts her hands on her fleshy hips, forgetting about the bruise and cursing quietly. \u201cWhatever,\u201d she says softly, almost to herself, diverting her gaze to the sad looking trash bag. \u201cI have somewhere to be.\u201d </p><p>Reaching down to get a firm grip on the bag, Harry stops her. He feels like the worst person in the world. He can\u2019t let her leave like this. </p><p>He could\u2019ve hurt her way worse than a bruise. And he already felt horrible about the bruise, sucking in his own breath like he was the one who got hit when he saw it. Taking the bag from her, his hands dwarfing her own ring covered ones, he jogs over to the nearest dumpster before she can protest and throws it in. Returning to her, he holds up his hands in some type of truce. </p><p>\u201cWhere are you going? Maybe you could let me take you there. It\u2019s the least I can do. And if you\u2019re in such a hurry, driving would get you to wherever you need to go way faster than your tiny feet could. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with tiny feet,\u201d he hurries out. \u201cJust can\u2019t cover as much ground as my Candace,\u201d he finishes with a proud smile and a knuckle rapping twice on the trunk. </p><p>\u201cAs if I\u2019m sitting in the same car that ran me over. A car that you named <i>Candace</i>. No chance buddy,\u201d she says, already twisting her body to physically leave the conversation. Harry inwardly groans. She seemed more than capable of doing things on her own and she definitely didn\u2019t want Harry\u2019s company but he felt like he owed her. Scratch that. He didn\u2019t just <i>feel</i> like he owed her: he absolutely knew that he did. He hit her with his car! </p><p>He watches her retreating figure for a full minute before deciding to catch up to her. If she didn\u2019t accept his ride, he would at least see her arrive to her destination safely. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she asks, side eyeing his profile. She\u2019s made it all the way to the entrance of the festival full of congested cars. He shrugs his shoulder, remaining silent as they walk, not quite together, but not quite like strangers. </p><p>She weaves her way in between the vehicles, a bit more wary now that she knows what it\u2019s like to be rammed into by one of them. He walks behind her, observing her straight posture and confident walk silhouetted by the setting sun. The dying star turned the frizzy halo around the crown of her head an orange tint and made her swinging hands glint brightly, courtesy of the multiple rings that called her fingers home. Her blouse was falling off one shoulder, sporting a couple dirt stains on the white fabric from her fall. Another thing he was sorry about. His eyes wander down to the swell of her backside against the tightness of her bell bottoms. He almost doesn\u2019t notice she\u2019s stopped walking and thankfully he does in time, or else he would\u2019ve ran into her. That would\u2019ve been bad. That would have brought on an onslaught of, \u201cYou can\u2019t drive AND you can\u2019t walk? How did you even get this far in life being a total safety hazard?\u201d </p><p>Harry can just hear it now. </p><p>She\u2019s stopped in her tracks because a small fender bender blocks her path. She huffs and turns around not knowing how close Harry is, running right into his  chest and bouncing back. \u201cWoah there,\u201d he says, putting both hands on her upper arms to steady her. </p><p>She shrugs him off and lets her feet carry her to the left, through a break in bumper to bumper traffic. Harry follows, of course. He thinks just a bit more than normal before opening his mouth. \u201cYou think they\u2019d see the traffic and the sun setting and turn around to go home, wouldn\u2019t you? Like, day one\u2019s almost over, the acts are wrapping up their sets,\u201d he says matter-of-factly. She doesn\u2019t say anything, just nods her head infinitesimally in grudging agreement. Harry takes this as a good sign. She\u2019s no longer biting at his head.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he starts off. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name? I\u2019m Harry. Harry Styles. And, again, I\u2019m so sorry I hit you with my car.\u201d He finds himself by her side, walking faster to keep up. <i>Maybe her tiny feet aren\u2019t so ineffectual,</i> he thinks with a huff. She doesn\u2019t seem to be too eager to answer him so he presses further. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here anyway? At Woodstock I mean. You don\u2019t look like you were enjoying the music so I\u2019m just curious as to why someone spends their Friday afternoon picking up other people\u2019s messes. Seems kinda pointless if you ask me,\u201d he says, rubbing a large hand around the nape of his neck. This garners a reaction from her and she looks up at him, an incredulous look on her otherwise serene face. </p><p>\u201cMy name is <i>Cynthia</i>,\u201d she begins, voice gaining more traction as she goes on. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a good thing no one asked you then. I\u2019m here because a bunch of environmentally challenged idiots get together and fry their brains to the sound of metal screeching on metal and create more litter than what\u2019s found in a town dump. I\u2019m <i>here</i> because no one but me seems to care about the environment. Do you know how much waste this godforsaken festival generates? And do you know how often they let it be stampeded into the Earth? They don\u2019t clean this shit up, man,\u201d she swears and breathes in, continuing her spiel. \u201cI mean I thought <i>you</i> cared. Do you? Or is your favorite pastime just taking out random pedestrians with your obnoxiously red car like it\u2019s a bowling ball and we\u2019re the pins?\u201d She finishes her last sentence with a snark. </p><p>Harry raises his eyebrows in surprise, halting mid step. Whatever he says is the wrong thing, so he just purses his lips and stares straight ahead. <i>If I just stayed with Johnny and Eric, I wouldn\u2019t be stuck with this self righteous hippie,</i> he thinks. He knows she has every right to be angry but he\u2019s been in too bad of a mood to even begin sympathizing. Everything feels like a direct attack to him at the moment.</p><p>Mentally sighing, he falls back in step with Cynthia, feeling bound to her at least until she knows she\u2019s safe. She may be mean and sarcastic and all the synonyms of angry in one person, but after she\u2019s arrived where she needs to go, Harry will never have to see her again. This thought gives him a bit of relief. She really is draining on his energy and he feels the need to pack a bowl just being around her.</p><p>They\u2019ve been walking in uncomfortable silence for a mile now and she stopped protesting his presence about half a mile ago. The sky eventually turned dark and the stars have come out from behind their cloudy curtains when they finally approach a small neighborhood full of neatly stacked white houses and manicured lawns, most of which are full of blooming yellow black eyed susans and crisp white hydrangeas. She walks a bit quicker, a skip in her step as she nears a white blocked house with pale yellow window shutters and the number 19 in gold lettering on the front door. As she hops up the steps, her bell bottoms swish against the ground.</p><p>She turns around. Narrowing her dark eyes yet again, she bites out a curt, \u201cthank you\u201d. Harry\u2019s about to smile but before he does she follows up with a, \u201cthank you, really. For hitting me with <i>Candace</i>. That\u2019s a hardcore stripper name, you know,\u201d she blows a piece of thick onyx hair out of her face. \u201cI didn\u2019t need you to walk me home. Really. So I\u2019m not going to give you a heartfelt thank you. <i>You hit me with your car,\u201d </i>she says pointedly. She can\u2019t believe she ended up here at the end of another seemingly routine day, standing on her front porch and looking into eyes so green it feels like she\u2019s staring at a motionless forest, waiting for the trees to move. </p><p>\u201cHave a wonderful night, Henry.\u201d </p><p>And with that, Cynthia closes her front door with a flourish and in the quiet night, Harry can hear the lock click shut. \u201cIt\u2019s Harry,\u201d he says out loud to no one but himself. </p><p>\u201cFucking Cynthia,\u201d he grumbles before twisting on his heel so fast it almost creates smoke, briskly walking down the single road in the complex back to Woodstock. He hears a flutter in the bush to his right and the brisk pace turns into a jog. </p><p>\u201cFucking <i>Cynthia</i>,\u201d he repeats, shaking his head.</p>",

            "comment": "<p><h1>Gaia</h1><p>Idek what this is, it\u2019s just an idea that came to me upon looking at that one pic of harry sitting on the grass with a red bandanna around his neck and sunglasses on his head. Nothin too serious but I thought I\u2019d post bc it\u2019s 7 am and why not? 4.5k words of nonsense</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"720\"><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/tempmediahashed.tumblr.com/3518acf00ae49445323c663f015d5b82/tumblr_pdaq2hN6gs1silg1u_raw.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"720\"></figure><p>In the flat green fields of Woodstock, New York, a young man sits with his knees pulled lazily to his chest. He\u2019s found the perfect place to disappear, a tucked away corner in the shade of a large elm tree, a refuge from the constant commotion of the festival happening around him. It\u2019s only the first day and he\u2019s seen about 30 people carted away on makeshift stretchers either due to heat stroke, dehydration or too much LSD, about two thirds of them most likely suffering from all three. Scoping out the bodies swaying barefoot to the tune up of an electric guitar, he lets his mind wander. To this morning, finally dragging himself out of the body-sized indent in his bed. To last night, lying beneath the stars on the hood of his 1957 Cadillac, soft palms resting right on the hot metal as if it could burn the fingerprints right off his body. As if it could burn the existence right out of him.</p><p>To last month and the letter in the mail that changed the coursing river of his fate. The swiftness of the water sludged down to a motionless one, not a ripple to be seen for miles. He thought back to the letter, written in blue ink, written five states away in a room he\u2019s never seen before. She sat in that unfamiliar room, on an unfamiliar chair and whipped out the most formal stationary she owned and proceeded to cross her T\u2019s and dot her I\u2019s and break his heart. She used to spray her letters with his favorite perfume of hers so that when they arrived they would carry a sweet reminder; that she remembered the small details about him, that she remembered enough of him to call it love. </p><p>When the mailman unceremoniously dropped the pile of bills and subscriptions and a single handwritten letter onto his entryway floor he didn\u2019t know he would spend the rest of the day in his room, on his bed, staring at the blazing summer sun making its way across his wall. The letter, adorned with drying tear stains that marred the pretty blue cursive, was absent of any faint trace of lemon. It was more bitter than the words that played on repeat in his mind, a record player skipping on the ugliest part of the song and distorting itself into a continuous screech. Words saying over and over again, \u201cit\u2019s not you, it\u2019s the distance\u201d. As if she wasn\u2019t the one who created the distance in the first place. </p><p>The unmistakable sound of a cheering crowd brought him back to the present. Harry felt the grass poking at the tender skin of his hands as he ran them back and forth lazily to the music emitting from the speakers. A band he didn\u2019t know the name of just walked on stage and everyone went wild, tipping their beers and sloshing the beverage all over the ground below them. He frowned, looking across the littered lawn at the variety of trash blanketing the green earth. Piles of cups, cans and bottles discarded, cigarette butts and clipped joints burned amongst wrappers of fast food and flyers showcasing the lineups for the day. He thought it was such an unnecessary thing to do as the large dumpsters lining the perimeters stood empty and void of their purpose. It was unfair. And he suddenly felt a great need to do something about it. Anything to get his mind off her.</p><p>Harry stood to his feet and brushed off the back of his pants so they would be free of dirt, ignoring the inevitable grass stains on his dark grey corduroys, and fixed the red bandanna tied loosely around his collar. He took off in the direction of the largest trash pile. He hadn\u2019t even wanted to be here. He loved music, sure, but he bought these tickets months ago with his friends with the money he saved from his shoveling side job during the winter when things were drastically different. He\u2019s been mentally preparing himself for the amazing experience he would soon have at dear old Woodstock. He planned everything down to the minute but what he hadn\u2019t planned on was his girlfriend of 2 years to up and cut all forms of ties she had with him, which nowadays were only came in a weekly letter due to her having moved miles away. He couldn\u2019t even enjoy himself here, couldn\u2019t allow the music to wash over him in that special healing way it did when he heard a spectacular guitar riff or felt the beat of the drums sync up with his pulse. </p><p>So he grabbed a leaf bag that lined one of the smaller garbages towards the center of the festival and walked around, picking up single pieces of wayward trash before moving to the more compact piles. He didn\u2019t realize how far he\u2019d walked until his bag was filled to the brim with a plethora of waste and his arms started to ache in protest. Half carrying and half dragging the bag, he headed over to the industrial dumpsters and wrangled the ballooned bag over the top of the container. A hot and soupy liquid leaked onto his chest in the process and he recoiled, dropping half of the bags contents back on the ground. He groaned and with a dejected sigh and began to pick it all up again. When he straightened at the waist, he felt a pair of eyes boring holes into his back. He shrugged off the feeling as there were obviously a lot of eyes in the vicinity today and successfully got rid of the garbage once and for all. </p><p>Turning around, Harry made eye contact with a girl about 100 feet away. She looked to be around his age, maybe younger, holding a trash picker in one hand and a nearly full black garbage bag in the other. In a quick once over he notices long black hair trailing onto the ruffled shoulders of a white floral blouse that ended at the waistband of dark brown bell bottoms, giving way to thickly strapped sandals peeking underneath the fabric. She gives him a wide smile and throws up a peace sign, her chubby fingers clad with an assortment of rings on each one. He thought it must be difficult to use the picker with the clunky bands of metal hitting the switch every other second to open up the claws at the end when they didn\u2019t need to be opened up. He tilts his head slightly to the side and furrowing his brows he lets a small, tight smile take over his face. She must\u2019ve thought he was a fellow advocate for Mother Earth like her. He wasn\u2019t really. He just needed something to do.</p><p>Averting her gaze, he finds his way through the disjointed crowds in search of his friends, Eric and Johnny. He was hoping he could see Eric\u2019s circular afro bopping above the sea of bouncing heads or Johnny\u2019s tremendously long arms flailing out of rhythm to the heavy music sounding out through the trees. He was ready to go and they had all taken Harry\u2019s car to Woodstock. Fumbling with his keys, he saw a familiar body going hard in the middle of a mosh pit, semi greasy pieces of hair flying about Johnny\u2019s face as his bony elbows found a different target to impale every two seconds. Taking a deep breath and squaring his shoulders, Harry braved the pit. His feet were being crushed every time he took a step and he stopped just outside of the core of the mosh, hanging low in the outer edge. He called out his friends name. </p><p>\u201cJohnny! Johnny Menzel!\u201d Harry repeated his name until the letters no longer made sense and his name no longer sounded like a word. Johnny was too caught up in the music. Harry wishes he could throw away his brain, wishes he could actually enjoy himself this weekend but alas. Here he was, wanting to go home to sulk in his bed after only three hours at the festival. They were supposed to go all night, him and his friends, even after the acts had finished their gigs. He told them he would stay for them because they knew he was going through the ringer at the moment and he wanted to be that reliable Harry he was, not this flakey, emotional Harry. But here he was, going back on his word. Harry traveled further into the dense crowd of flying limbs and swirling hair and tugged on Johnny\u2019s shoulder, turning him around to face him. </p><p>\u201cHarry! Fancy seeing you here dude,\u201d Johnny exclaimed, brushing a sweaty strand of dirt colored hair out of his eyes in order to see his friend. Red rimmed the translucent blue irises, eyelids drooping heavily over them as a cheesy grin found its way onto his face. Harry resisted the urge to roll his eyes. Johnny was having fun, everyone around him was having fun. So why couldn\u2019t he? Johnny had four months of rent to worry about that was due in two days but here he was, head banging to some obscure band amidst total strangers with their own problems. Maybe that was the way to let forget about it; smoke a whole lot of weed and let your body do all the thinking. Harry felt he couldn\u2019t even do that, though. He just wanted to go home.</p><p>One look at Harry\u2019s face and Johnny could tell what he was thinking. Shaking his head quickly, he backed away from Harry with his palms up and started to walk over to the canteen where they were selling bottled water for outrageous prices. Harry followed him and watched as he whistled and started picking at the bush next to the table, seemingly interested in its foliage. Harry knew what he was doing, having seen this same scene play out hundreds of times. The person in the chair counting money didn\u2019t notice when Johnny swiped a cold bottle from the row and strutted away, Harry scoffing and trailing behind. </p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Harry says, catching up to Johnny. \u201cI\u2019ll stay the whole day tomorrow, I promise. I just can\u2019t today. It\u2019s too hot and\u2026loud,\u201d Harry finished, grasping for any excuse and coming up short. Of course it\u2019s loud and sweaty. They\u2019re at a music festival. In the middle of August.</p><p>Johnny could hear the absolute bullshit in his words and whirled around, placing a cold and condensated hand on Harry\u2019s shoulder, chugging half of the water in one gulp before opening his mouth. \u201cYeah, because that\u2019s totally the reason you want to leave before Janis Joplin comes on stage. You know, the quote unquote love of your short lived life? The woman you\u2019ve obsessed over since you knew what a boner was?\u201d Harry smacked Johnny\u2019s hand off his shoulder, suppressing an intense blush before groaning. He should know by now to never tell his friends anything about himself.</p><p>\u201cMan, I told you that in confidence,\u201d Harry whines. </p><p>\u201cYou were drunk off your ass and announced that Janis Joplin gave you musical hard ons to a garage full of people. Don\u2019t act all scandalized. You do it to yourself,\u201d Johnny quips. \u201cAnyway,\u201d he continues animatedly. \u201cEric and I told you we were going to <i>drag</i> you out of that house if it was the last thing we did. And we did it. You can\u2019t stay in that musty room anymore. I get that you\u2019re hurt, man, I really do,\u201d Harry crosses his arms at this statement but that doesn\u2019t deter Johnny. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been talking about this forever! I should\u2019ve spent most of this money on rent but here I am, getting paid in <i>experience</i>. This is too groovy man, and you\u2019re making it seem like a chore,\u201d Johnny ends his miniature rant with a pouty bottom lip and what seems like a stab at a comforting voice but all it sounds like to Harry is pitying. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going home,\u201d Harry announces, choosing to ignore the well meaning monologue. He jingles his keys in front of Johnny\u2019s face, the 8 ball accesory almost making contact with his aquiline nose.\u201dWith or without you guys.\u201d Johnny rears his head back.</p><p>\u201cLooks like it\u2019s without then. I\u2019m going to go find Eric. And together we will find a ride. If not, we\u2019ll just sleep on a bench or something. Maybe even on the wet grass,\u201d he says, letting out an exaggerated gasp. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the experience,\u201d Johnny says, before turning on his heel in search of the third staple friend in their group. Harry knows he shouldn\u2019t feel betrayed by them. It would be unfair with all the moping they\u2019ve put up with and all the times they smoked a bowl on Eric\u2019s roof and Harry talked for hours and hours about her. Her pointy ears, her dainty wrists, her brown eyes he wanted to sow seeds in, watch flowers grow out of. Yeah, he was high. He was also sad. And they knew it. They sat there and let him talk for as long as he wanted to, even until the sun came up. They were good friends, he reminded himself on the way to his car. They just wanted to have fun. </p><p>Shoving his key into the ignition, he felt the Cadillac roar to life. He spent a full year working on this car, restoring it to its former glory. He loved his baby, even gave her a name: Candace. It wasn\u2019t too creative but it was something to call his own. Putting his car into reverse and letting his foot off the break, he slowly rolled backwards out of his hazardous parking space, in his own little world. He regretted being to lazy to check his blindspot when he heard a dull thud and a grunt, the sound of numerous object falling to the ground. Harry\u2019s eyes widened as he put the car in park, scrambling for the door handle. He missed the lock three times before successfully disarming it and opening the door. He hesitantly made his way to the back of Candace, heart racing. He just hit someone. </p><p>In the two seconds it took to get to the bumper, Harry\u2019s thought process went something like this; <i>Oh my god. I just hit someone with my car. I\u2019m in so much shit. Deep shit. Center of the Earth shit. They\u2019ll sue me. Wait, what if they\u2019re can\u2019t sue me because they\u2019re dead? I wasn\u2019t going that fast, was I? What if they hit their head on Candace on the way down to their demise? What if there\u2019s blood? I can\u2019t handle blood! Oh my god, I\u2019m going the throw up ohmygodohmygodohmygod. </i></p><p>Rounding the back of the car (and discretely flicking his gaze to the headlight for any sign of damage), he sees a familiar pair of thick and strappy sandals and his heart drops even more. It was Hippie Girl he just mowed over with his car. He stands there, frozen as she begins to stir, loud groans escaping her lips. She tries to sit up and Harry finally moves, rushing over and dropping to his knees, making sure to cradle her head so she doesn\u2019t hurt anything else. </p><p>Upon opening her eyes, his breath catches. They\u2019re the deepest shade of brown he\u2019s ever seen and it chills him to the bone. It\u2019s an unsettling stare. Various emotions pass over her face like clouds in the sky ranging from shock, confusion, pain and then finally, anger. She winces and takes a stuttered breath, opening up her deeply bowed mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat the <i>hell</i> just happened,\u201d she questions angrily. Her thick brows furrow and dimple her forehead in the process. She turns her dark eyes left and right as if to gather her bearings before connecting with his, a recognizance sparking to life behind them like a flame. He gulps, praying silently for the Earth to swallow him up. </p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Harry drawls out, unsure of how to say it. \u201cI kind of backed into you with Candace. But not on purpose! I was\u2026changing the radio station,\u201d he lies, not wanting to seem like a wack job that doesn\u2019t deserve his license. \u201cI am so, so, so, so, so incredibly, terribly sorry. Here let me help you.\u201d</p><p>With one hand on her back and the other wrapped around her wrist, he gently helps her up. As soon as she rises to her feet, she swats his hands away. Grimacing, she rotates her neck side to side and finds that it\u2019s only a bit sore and still capable of full motion. Testing out the rest of her body, she stretches out her limbs, flinching slightly when she takes a step forward. Lifting her shirt to expose her hip where Harry assumes he hit with his car, he sees the start of a nasty bruise spreading into the waist of her dark brown jeans the same time she does. Lifting her head, he sees her face turn red with anger. A sharp inhale leaves both of their mouths. <i>Uh oh,</i> Harry thinks to himself. <i>I\u2019m definitely getting sued. </i></p><p>The Hippie Girl starts mumbling under her breath. </p><p>\u201cUh, what are you doing?\u201d Harry asks uneasily. He really didn\u2019t feel like getting cursed by your run of the mill Woodstock Witch, no matter how much he deserved it. She ignores him and \u00a0turns her focus to the trash bag lying half empty in the dirt, its contents splayed all around them, many having rolled under nearby cars. She closes her eyes in defeat. Harry, feeling awful, hurriedly bends down to pick up all the garbage he can fit into his arms, not caring this time around if any mysterious liquid drips onto him. </p><p>Stuffing the armful of random waste into the bag at her feet, he hears what she\u2019s saying. He stays crouched, cocking his head. She\u2019s not saying any words, just counting. The numbers drop down from one hundred in threes, it seems. He pauses to listens. <i>97, 94, 91, 88, 85, 82</i>\u2026The numbers stop suddenly at 79 and he looks up to see her looking at him, almost black eyes narrowed. He straightens up quickly, clearing his throat. \u201cListen,\u201d he says frantically. \u201cYou have to understand how sorry I am. I\u2019m not usually the type of guy who goes around running over girls with his car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would hope not,\u201d she shoots back. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky I have somewhere to be or else I would really be laying into you, dude. Changing radio stations? Really? Are you that shitty of a driver?\u201d She puts her hands on her fleshy hips, forgetting about the bruise and cursing quietly. \u201cWhatever,\u201d she says softly, almost to herself, diverting her gaze to the sad looking trash bag. \u201cI have somewhere to be.\u201d </p><p>Reaching down to get a firm grip on the bag, Harry stops her. He feels like the worst person in the world. He can\u2019t let her leave like this. </p><p>He could\u2019ve hurt her way worse than a bruise. And he already felt horrible about the bruise, sucking in his own breath like he was the one who got hit when he saw it. Taking the bag from her, his hands dwarfing her own ring covered ones, he jogs over to the nearest dumpster before she can protest and throws it in. Returning to her, he holds up his hands in some type of truce. </p><p>\u201cWhere are you going? Maybe you could let me take you there. It\u2019s the least I can do. And if you\u2019re in such a hurry, driving would get you to wherever you need to go way faster than your tiny feet could. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with tiny feet,\u201d he hurries out. \u201cJust can\u2019t cover as much ground as my Candace,\u201d he finishes with a proud smile and a knuckle rapping twice on the trunk. </p><p>\u201cAs if I\u2019m sitting in the same car that ran me over. A car that you named <i>Candace</i>. No chance buddy,\u201d she says, already twisting her body to physically leave the conversation. Harry inwardly groans. She seemed more than capable of doing things on her own and she definitely didn\u2019t want Harry\u2019s company but he felt like he owed her. Scratch that. He didn\u2019t just <i>feel</i> like he owed her: he absolutely knew that he did. He hit her with his car! </p><p>He watches her retreating figure for a full minute before deciding to catch up to her. If she didn\u2019t accept his ride, he would at least see her arrive to her destination safely. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she asks, side eyeing his profile. She\u2019s made it all the way to the entrance of the festival full of congested cars. He shrugs his shoulder, remaining silent as they walk, not quite together, but not quite like strangers. </p><p>She weaves her way in between the vehicles, a bit more wary now that she knows what it\u2019s like to be rammed into by one of them. He walks behind her, observing her straight posture and confident walk silhouetted by the setting sun. The dying star turned the frizzy halo around the crown of her head an orange tint and made her swinging hands glint brightly, courtesy of the multiple rings that called her fingers home. Her blouse was falling off one shoulder, sporting a couple dirt stains on the white fabric from her fall. Another thing he was sorry about. His eyes wander down to the swell of her backside against the tightness of her bell bottoms. He almost doesn\u2019t notice she\u2019s stopped walking and thankfully he does in time, or else he would\u2019ve ran into her. That would\u2019ve been bad. That would have brought on an onslaught of, \u201cYou can\u2019t drive AND you can\u2019t walk? How did you even get this far in life being a total safety hazard?\u201d </p><p>Harry can just hear it now. </p><p>She\u2019s stopped in her tracks because a small fender bender blocks her path. She huffs and turns around not knowing how close Harry is, running right into his  chest and bouncing back. \u201cWoah there,\u201d he says, putting both hands on her upper arms to steady her. </p><p>She shrugs him off and lets her feet carry her to the left, through a break in bumper to bumper traffic. Harry follows, of course. He thinks just a bit more than normal before opening his mouth. \u201cYou think they\u2019d see the traffic and the sun setting and turn around to go home, wouldn\u2019t you? Like, day one\u2019s almost over, the acts are wrapping up their sets,\u201d he says matter-of-factly. She doesn\u2019t say anything, just nods her head infinitesimally in grudging agreement. Harry takes this as a good sign. She\u2019s no longer biting at his head.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he starts off. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name? I\u2019m Harry. Harry Styles. And, again, I\u2019m so sorry I hit you with my car.\u201d He finds himself by her side, walking faster to keep up. <i>Maybe her tiny feet aren\u2019t so ineffectual,</i> he thinks with a huff. She doesn\u2019t seem to be too eager to answer him so he presses further. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here anyway? At Woodstock I mean. You don\u2019t look like you were enjoying the music so I\u2019m just curious as to why someone spends their Friday afternoon picking up other people\u2019s messes. Seems kinda pointless if you ask me,\u201d he says, rubbing a large hand around the nape of his neck. This garners a reaction from her and she looks up at him, an incredulous look on her otherwise serene face. </p><p>\u201cMy name is <i>Cynthia</i>,\u201d she begins, voice gaining more traction as she goes on. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a good thing no one asked you then. I\u2019m here because a bunch of environmentally challenged idiots get together and fry their brains to the sound of metal screeching on metal and create more litter than what\u2019s found in a town dump. I\u2019m <i>here</i> because no one but me seems to care about the environment. Do you know how much waste this godforsaken festival generates? And do you know how often they let it be stampeded into the Earth? They don\u2019t clean this shit up, man,\u201d she swears and breathes in, continuing her spiel. \u201cI mean I thought <i>you</i> cared. Do you? Or is your favorite pastime just taking out random pedestrians with your obnoxiously red car like it\u2019s a bowling ball and we\u2019re the pins?\u201d She finishes her last sentence with a snark. </p><p>Harry raises his eyebrows in surprise, halting mid step. Whatever he says is the wrong thing, so he just purses his lips and stares straight ahead. <i>If I just stayed with Johnny and Eric, I wouldn\u2019t be stuck with this self righteous hippie,</i> he thinks. He knows she has every right to be angry but he\u2019s been in too bad of a mood to even begin sympathizing. Everything feels like a direct attack to him at the moment.</p><p>Mentally sighing, he falls back in step with Cynthia, feeling bound to her at least until she knows she\u2019s safe. She may be mean and sarcastic and all the synonyms of angry in one person, but after she\u2019s arrived where she needs to go, Harry will never have to see her again. This thought gives him a bit of relief. She really is draining on his energy and he feels the need to pack a bowl just being around her.</p><p>They\u2019ve been walking in uncomfortable silence for a mile now and she stopped protesting his presence about half a mile ago. The sky eventually turned dark and the stars have come out from behind their cloudy curtains when they finally approach a small neighborhood full of neatly stacked white houses and manicured lawns, most of which are full of blooming yellow black eyed susans and crisp white hydrangeas. She walks a bit quicker, a skip in her step as she nears a white blocked house with pale yellow window shutters and the number 19 in gold lettering on the front door. As she hops up the steps, her bell bottoms swish against the ground.</p><p>She turns around. Narrowing her dark eyes yet again, she bites out a curt, \u201cthank you\u201d. Harry\u2019s about to smile but before he does she follows up with a, \u201cthank you, really. For hitting me with <i>Candace</i>. That\u2019s a hardcore stripper name, you know,\u201d she blows a piece of thick onyx hair out of her face. \u201cI didn\u2019t need you to walk me home. Really. So I\u2019m not going to give you a heartfelt thank you. <i>You hit me with your car,\u201d </i>she says pointedly. She can\u2019t believe she ended up here at the end of another seemingly routine day, standing on her front porch and looking into eyes so green it feels like she\u2019s staring at a motionless forest, waiting for the trees to move. </p><p>\u201cHave a wonderful night, Henry.\u201d </p><p>And with that, Cynthia closes her front door with a flourish and in the quiet night, Harry can hear the lock click shut. \u201cIt\u2019s Harry,\u201d he says out loud to no one but himself. </p><p>\u201cFucking Cynthia,\u201d he grumbles before twisting on his heel so fast it almost creates smoke, briskly walking down the single road in the complex back to Woodstock. He hears a flutter in the bush to his right and the brisk pace turns into a jog. </p><p>\u201cFucking <i>Cynthia</i>,\u201d he repeats, shaking his head.</p></p>",

Nothin too serious but I thought I\u2019d post bc it\u2019s 7 am and why not? 4.5k words of nonsense</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"720\"><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/tempmediahashed.tumblr.com/3518acf00ae49445323c663f015d5b82/tumblr_pdaq2hN6gs1silg1u_raw.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"720\"></figure><p>In the flat green fields of Woodstock, New York, a young man sits with his knees pulled lazily to his chest. He\u2019s found the perfect place to disappear, a tucked away corner in the shade of a large elm tree, a refuge from the constant commotion of the festival happening around him. It\u2019s only the first day and he\u2019s seen about 30 people carted away on makeshift stretchers either due to heat stroke, dehydration or too much LSD, about two thirds of them most likely suffering from all three. Scoping out the bodies swaying barefoot to the tune up of an electric guitar, he lets his mind wander. To this morning, finally dragging himself out of the body-sized indent in his bed. To last night, lying beneath the stars on the hood of his 1957 Cadillac, soft palms resting right on the hot metal as if it could burn the fingerprints right off his body. As if it could burn the existence right out of him.</p><p>To last month and the letter in the mail that changed the coursing river of his fate. The swiftness of the water sludged down to a motionless one, not a ripple to be seen for miles. He thought back to the letter, written in blue ink, written five states away in a room he\u2019s never seen before. She sat in that unfamiliar room, on an unfamiliar chair and whipped out the most formal stationary she owned and proceeded to cross her T\u2019s and dot her I\u2019s and break his heart. She used to spray her letters with his favorite perfume of hers so that when they arrived they would carry a sweet reminder; that she remembered the small details about him, that she remembered enough of him to call it love. </p><p>When the mailman unceremoniously dropped the pile of bills and subscriptions and a single handwritten letter onto his entryway floor he didn\u2019t know he would spend the rest of the day in his room, on his bed, staring at the blazing summer sun making its way across his wall. The letter, adorned with drying tear stains that marred the pretty blue cursive, was absent of any faint trace of lemon. It was more bitter than the words that played on repeat in his mind, a record player skipping on the ugliest part of the song and distorting itself into a continuous screech. Words saying over and over again, \u201cit\u2019s not you, it\u2019s the distance\u201d. As if she wasn\u2019t the one who created the distance in the first place. </p><p>The unmistakable sound of a cheering crowd brought him back to the present. Harry felt the grass poking at the tender skin of his hands as he ran them back and forth lazily to the music emitting from the speakers. A band he didn\u2019t know the name of just walked on stage and everyone went wild, tipping their beers and sloshing the beverage all over the ground below them. He frowned, looking across the littered lawn at the variety of trash blanketing the green earth. Piles of cups, cans and bottles discarded, cigarette butts and clipped joints burned amongst wrappers of fast food and flyers showcasing the lineups for the day. He thought it was such an unnecessary thing to do as the large dumpsters lining the perimeters stood empty and void of their purpose. It was unfair. And he suddenly felt a great need to do something about it. Anything to get his mind off her.</p><p>Harry stood to his feet and brushed off the back of his pants so they would be free of dirt, ignoring the inevitable grass stains on his dark grey corduroys, and fixed the red bandanna tied loosely around his collar. He took off in the direction of the largest trash pile. He hadn\u2019t even wanted to be here. He loved music, sure, but he bought these tickets months ago with his friends with the money he saved from his shoveling side job during the winter when things were drastically different. He\u2019s been mentally preparing himself for the amazing experience he would soon have at dear old Woodstock. He planned everything down to the minute but what he hadn\u2019t planned on was his girlfriend of 2 years to up and cut all forms of ties she had with him, which nowadays were only came in a weekly letter due to her having moved miles away. He couldn\u2019t even enjoy himself here, couldn\u2019t allow the music to wash over him in that special healing way it did when he heard a spectacular guitar riff or felt the beat of the drums sync up with his pulse. </p><p>So he grabbed a leaf bag that lined one of the smaller garbages towards the center of the festival and walked around, picking up single pieces of wayward trash before moving to the more compact piles. He didn\u2019t realize how far he\u2019d walked until his bag was filled to the brim with a plethora of waste and his arms started to ache in protest. Half carrying and half dragging the bag, he headed over to the industrial dumpsters and wrangled the ballooned bag over the top of the container. A hot and soupy liquid leaked onto his chest in the process and he recoiled, dropping half of the bags contents back on the ground. He groaned and with a dejected sigh and began to pick it all up again. When he straightened at the waist, he felt a pair of eyes boring holes into his back. He shrugged off the feeling as there were obviously a lot of eyes in the vicinity today and successfully got rid of the garbage once and for all. </p><p>Turning around, Harry made eye contact with a girl about 100 feet away. She looked to be around his age, maybe younger, holding a trash picker in one hand and a nearly full black garbage bag in the other. In a quick once over he notices long black hair trailing onto the ruffled shoulders of a white floral blouse that ended at the waistband of dark brown bell bottoms, giving way to thickly strapped sandals peeking underneath the fabric. She gives him a wide smile and throws up a peace sign, her chubby fingers clad with an assortment of rings on each one. He thought it must be difficult to use the picker with the clunky bands of metal hitting the switch every other second to open up the claws at the end when they didn\u2019t need to be opened up. He tilts his head slightly to the side and furrowing his brows he lets a small, tight smile take over his face. She must\u2019ve thought he was a fellow advocate for Mother Earth like her. He wasn\u2019t really. He just needed something to do.</p><p>Averting her gaze, he finds his way through the disjointed crowds in search of his friends, Eric and Johnny. He was hoping he could see Eric\u2019s circular afro bopping above the sea of bouncing heads or Johnny\u2019s tremendously long arms flailing out of rhythm to the heavy music sounding out through the trees. He was ready to go and they had all taken Harry\u2019s car to Woodstock. Fumbling with his keys, he saw a familiar body going hard in the middle of a mosh pit, semi greasy pieces of hair flying about Johnny\u2019s face as his bony elbows found a different target to impale every two seconds. Taking a deep breath and squaring his shoulders, Harry braved the pit. His feet were being crushed every time he took a step and he stopped just outside of the core of the mosh, hanging low in the outer edge. He called out his friends name. </p><p>\u201cJohnny! Johnny Menzel!\u201d Harry repeated his name until the letters no longer made sense and his name no longer sounded like a word. Johnny was too caught up in the music. Harry wishes he could throw away his brain, wishes he could actually enjoy himself this weekend but alas. Here he was, wanting to go home to sulk in his bed after only three hours at the festival. They were supposed to go all night, him and his friends, even after the acts had finished their gigs. He told them he would stay for them because they knew he was going through the ringer at the moment and he wanted to be that reliable Harry he was, not this flakey, emotional Harry. But here he was, going back on his word. Harry traveled further into the dense crowd of flying limbs and swirling hair and tugged on Johnny\u2019s shoulder, turning him around to face him. </p><p>\u201cHarry! Fancy seeing you here dude,\u201d Johnny exclaimed, brushing a sweaty strand of dirt colored hair out of his eyes in order to see his friend. Red rimmed the translucent blue irises, eyelids drooping heavily over them as a cheesy grin found its way onto his face. Harry resisted the urge to roll his eyes. Johnny was having fun, everyone around him was having fun. So why couldn\u2019t he? Johnny had four months of rent to worry about that was due in two days but here he was, head banging to some obscure band amidst total strangers with their own problems. Maybe that was the way to let forget about it; smoke a whole lot of weed and let your body do all the thinking. Harry felt he couldn\u2019t even do that, though. He just wanted to go home.</p><p>One look at Harry\u2019s face and Johnny could tell what he was thinking. Shaking his head quickly, he backed away from Harry with his palms up and started to walk over to the canteen where they were selling bottled water for outrageous prices. Harry followed him and watched as he whistled and started picking at the bush next to the table, seemingly interested in its foliage. Harry knew what he was doing, having seen this same scene play out hundreds of times. The person in the chair counting money didn\u2019t notice when Johnny swiped a cold bottle from the row and strutted away, Harry scoffing and trailing behind. </p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Harry says, catching up to Johnny. \u201cI\u2019ll stay the whole day tomorrow, I promise. I just can\u2019t today. It\u2019s too hot and\u2026loud,\u201d Harry finished, grasping for any excuse and coming up short. Of course it\u2019s loud and sweaty. They\u2019re at a music festival. In the middle of August.</p><p>Johnny could hear the absolute bullshit in his words and whirled around, placing a cold and condensated hand on Harry\u2019s shoulder, chugging half of the water in one gulp before opening his mouth. \u201cYeah, because that\u2019s totally the reason you want to leave before Janis Joplin comes on stage. You know, the quote unquote love of your short lived life? The woman you\u2019ve obsessed over since you knew what a boner was?\u201d Harry smacked Johnny\u2019s hand off his shoulder, suppressing an intense blush before groaning. He should know by now to never tell his friends anything about himself.</p><p>\u201cMan, I told you that in confidence,\u201d Harry whines. </p><p>\u201cYou were drunk off your ass and announced that Janis Joplin gave you musical hard ons to a garage full of people. Don\u2019t act all scandalized. You do it to yourself,\u201d Johnny quips. \u201cAnyway,\u201d he continues animatedly. \u201cEric and I told you we were going to <i>drag</i> you out of that house if it was the last thing we did. And we did it. You can\u2019t stay in that musty room anymore. I get that you\u2019re hurt, man, I really do,\u201d Harry crosses his arms at this statement but that doesn\u2019t deter Johnny. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been talking about this forever! I should\u2019ve spent most of this money on rent but here I am, getting paid in <i>experience</i>. This is too groovy man, and you\u2019re making it seem like a chore,\u201d Johnny ends his miniature rant with a pouty bottom lip and what seems like a stab at a comforting voice but all it sounds like to Harry is pitying. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going home,\u201d Harry announces, choosing to ignore the well meaning monologue. He jingles his keys in front of Johnny\u2019s face, the 8 ball accesory almost making contact with his aquiline nose.\u201dWith or without you guys.\u201d Johnny rears his head back.</p><p>\u201cLooks like it\u2019s without then. I\u2019m going to go find Eric. And together we will find a ride. If not, we\u2019ll just sleep on a bench or something. Maybe even on the wet grass,\u201d he says, letting out an exaggerated gasp. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the experience,\u201d Johnny says, before turning on his heel in search of the third staple friend in their group. Harry knows he shouldn\u2019t feel betrayed by them. It would be unfair with all the moping they\u2019ve put up with and all the times they smoked a bowl on Eric\u2019s roof and Harry talked for hours and hours about her. Her pointy ears, her dainty wrists, her brown eyes he wanted to sow seeds in, watch flowers grow out of. Yeah, he was high. He was also sad. And they knew it. They sat there and let him talk for as long as he wanted to, even until the sun came up. They were good friends, he reminded himself on the way to his car. They just wanted to have fun. </p><p>Shoving his key into the ignition, he felt the Cadillac roar to life. He spent a full year working on this car, restoring it to its former glory. He loved his baby, even gave her a name: Candace. It wasn\u2019t too creative but it was something to call his own. Putting his car into reverse and letting his foot off the break, he slowly rolled backwards out of his hazardous parking space, in his own little world. He regretted being to lazy to check his blindspot when he heard a dull thud and a grunt, the sound of numerous object falling to the ground. Harry\u2019s eyes widened as he put the car in park, scrambling for the door handle. He missed the lock three times before successfully disarming it and opening the door. He hesitantly made his way to the back of Candace, heart racing. He just hit someone. </p><p>In the two seconds it took to get to the bumper, Harry\u2019s thought process went something like this; <i>Oh my god. I just hit someone with my car. I\u2019m in so much shit. Deep shit. Center of the Earth shit. They\u2019ll sue me. Wait, what if they\u2019re can\u2019t sue me because they\u2019re dead? I wasn\u2019t going that fast, was I? What if they hit their head on Candace on the way down to their demise? What if there\u2019s blood? I can\u2019t handle blood! Oh my god, I\u2019m going the throw up ohmygodohmygodohmygod. </i></p><p>Rounding the back of the car (and discretely flicking his gaze to the headlight for any sign of damage), he sees a familiar pair of thick and strappy sandals and his heart drops even more. It was Hippie Girl he just mowed over with his car. He stands there, frozen as she begins to stir, loud groans escaping her lips. She tries to sit up and Harry finally moves, rushing over and dropping to his knees, making sure to cradle her head so she doesn\u2019t hurt anything else. </p><p>Upon opening her eyes, his breath catches. They\u2019re the deepest shade of brown he\u2019s ever seen and it chills him to the bone. It\u2019s an unsettling stare. Various emotions pass over her face like clouds in the sky ranging from shock, confusion, pain and then finally, anger. She winces and takes a stuttered breath, opening up her deeply bowed mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat the <i>hell</i> just happened,\u201d she questions angrily. Her thick brows furrow and dimple her forehead in the process. She turns her dark eyes left and right as if to gather her bearings before connecting with his, a recognizance sparking to life behind them like a flame. He gulps, praying silently for the Earth to swallow him up. </p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Harry drawls out, unsure of how to say it. \u201cI kind of backed into you with Candace. But not on purpose! I was\u2026changing the radio station,\u201d he lies, not wanting to seem like a wack job that doesn\u2019t deserve his license. \u201cI am so, so, so, so, so incredibly, terribly sorry. Here let me help you.\u201d</p><p>With one hand on her back and the other wrapped around her wrist, he gently helps her up. As soon as she rises to her feet, she swats his hands away. Grimacing, she rotates her neck side to side and finds that it\u2019s only a bit sore and still capable of full motion. Testing out the rest of her body, she stretches out her limbs, flinching slightly when she takes a step forward. Lifting her shirt to expose her hip where Harry assumes he hit with his car, he sees the start of a nasty bruise spreading into the waist of her dark brown jeans the same time she does. Lifting her head, he sees her face turn red with anger. A sharp inhale leaves both of their mouths. <i>Uh oh,</i> Harry thinks to himself. <i>I\u2019m definitely getting sued. </i></p><p>The Hippie Girl starts mumbling under her breath. </p><p>\u201cUh, what are you doing?\u201d Harry asks uneasily. He really didn\u2019t feel like getting cursed by your run of the mill Woodstock Witch, no matter how much he deserved it. She ignores him and \u00a0turns her focus to the trash bag lying half empty in the dirt, its contents splayed all around them, many having rolled under nearby cars. She closes her eyes in defeat. Harry, feeling awful, hurriedly bends down to pick up all the garbage he can fit into his arms, not caring this time around if any mysterious liquid drips onto him. </p><p>Stuffing the armful of random waste into the bag at her feet, he hears what she\u2019s saying. He stays crouched, cocking his head. She\u2019s not saying any words, just counting. The numbers drop down from one hundred in threes, it seems. He pauses to listens. <i>97, 94, 91, 88, 85, 82</i>\u2026The numbers stop suddenly at 79 and he looks up to see her looking at him, almost black eyes narrowed. He straightens up quickly, clearing his throat. \u201cListen,\u201d he says frantically. \u201cYou have to understand how sorry I am. I\u2019m not usually the type of guy who goes around running over girls with his car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would hope not,\u201d she shoots back. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky I have somewhere to be or else I would really be laying into you, dude. Changing radio stations? Really? Are you that shitty of a driver?\u201d She puts her hands on her fleshy hips, forgetting about the bruise and cursing quietly. \u201cWhatever,\u201d she says softly, almost to herself, diverting her gaze to the sad looking trash bag. \u201cI have somewhere to be.\u201d </p><p>Reaching down to get a firm grip on the bag, Harry stops her. He feels like the worst person in the world. He can\u2019t let her leave like this. </p><p>He could\u2019ve hurt her way worse than a bruise. And he already felt horrible about the bruise, sucking in his own breath like he was the one who got hit when he saw it. Taking the bag from her, his hands dwarfing her own ring covered ones, he jogs over to the nearest dumpster before she can protest and throws it in. Returning to her, he holds up his hands in some type of truce. </p><p>\u201cWhere are you going? Maybe you could let me take you there. It\u2019s the least I can do. And if you\u2019re in such a hurry, driving would get you to wherever you need to go way faster than your tiny feet could. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with tiny feet,\u201d he hurries out. \u201cJust can\u2019t cover as much ground as my Candace,\u201d he finishes with a proud smile and a knuckle rapping twice on the trunk. </p><p>\u201cAs if I\u2019m sitting in the same car that ran me over. A car that you named <i>Candace</i>. No chance buddy,\u201d she says, already twisting her body to physically leave the conversation. Harry inwardly groans. She seemed more than capable of doing things on her own and she definitely didn\u2019t want Harry\u2019s company but he felt like he owed her. Scratch that. He didn\u2019t just <i>feel</i> like he owed her: he absolutely knew that he did. He hit her with his car! </p><p>He watches her retreating figure for a full minute before deciding to catch up to her. If she didn\u2019t accept his ride, he would at least see her arrive to her destination safely. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she asks, side eyeing his profile. She\u2019s made it all the way to the entrance of the festival full of congested cars. He shrugs his shoulder, remaining silent as they walk, not quite together, but not quite like strangers. </p><p>She weaves her way in between the vehicles, a bit more wary now that she knows what it\u2019s like to be rammed into by one of them. He walks behind her, observing her straight posture and confident walk silhouetted by the setting sun. The dying star turned the frizzy halo around the crown of her head an orange tint and made her swinging hands glint brightly, courtesy of the multiple rings that called her fingers home. Her blouse was falling off one shoulder, sporting a couple dirt stains on the white fabric from her fall. Another thing he was sorry about. His eyes wander down to the swell of her backside against the tightness of her bell bottoms. He almost doesn\u2019t notice she\u2019s stopped walking and thankfully he does in time, or else he would\u2019ve ran into her. That would\u2019ve been bad. That would have brought on an onslaught of, \u201cYou can\u2019t drive AND you can\u2019t walk? How did you even get this far in life being a total safety hazard?\u201d </p><p>Harry can just hear it now. </p><p>She\u2019s stopped in her tracks because a small fender bender blocks her path. She huffs and turns around not knowing how close Harry is, running right into his  chest and bouncing back. \u201cWoah there,\u201d he says, putting both hands on her upper arms to steady her. </p><p>She shrugs him off and lets her feet carry her to the left, through a break in bumper to bumper traffic. Harry follows, of course. He thinks just a bit more than normal before opening his mouth. \u201cYou think they\u2019d see the traffic and the sun setting and turn around to go home, wouldn\u2019t you? Like, day one\u2019s almost over, the acts are wrapping up their sets,\u201d he says matter-of-factly. She doesn\u2019t say anything, just nods her head infinitesimally in grudging agreement. Harry takes this as a good sign. She\u2019s no longer biting at his head.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he starts off. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name? I\u2019m Harry. Harry Styles. And, again, I\u2019m so sorry I hit you with my car.\u201d He finds himself by her side, walking faster to keep up. <i>Maybe her tiny feet aren\u2019t so ineffectual,</i> he thinks with a huff. She doesn\u2019t seem to be too eager to answer him so he presses further. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here anyway? At Woodstock I mean. You don\u2019t look like you were enjoying the music so I\u2019m just curious as to why someone spends their Friday afternoon picking up other people\u2019s messes. Seems kinda pointless if you ask me,\u201d he says, rubbing a large hand around the nape of his neck. This garners a reaction from her and she looks up at him, an incredulous look on her otherwise serene face. </p><p>\u201cMy name is <i>Cynthia</i>,\u201d she begins, voice gaining more traction as she goes on. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a good thing no one asked you then. I\u2019m here because a bunch of environmentally challenged idiots get together and fry their brains to the sound of metal screeching on metal and create more litter than what\u2019s found in a town dump. I\u2019m <i>here</i> because no one but me seems to care about the environment. Do you know how much waste this godforsaken festival generates? And do you know how often they let it be stampeded into the Earth? They don\u2019t clean this shit up, man,\u201d she swears and breathes in, continuing her spiel. \u201cI mean I thought <i>you</i> cared. Do you? Or is your favorite pastime just taking out random pedestrians with your obnoxiously red car like it\u2019s a bowling ball and we\u2019re the pins?\u201d She finishes her last sentence with a snark. </p><p>Harry raises his eyebrows in surprise, halting mid step. Whatever he says is the wrong thing, so he just purses his lips and stares straight ahead. <i>If I just stayed with Johnny and Eric, I wouldn\u2019t be stuck with this self righteous hippie,</i> he thinks. He knows she has every right to be angry but he\u2019s been in too bad of a mood to even begin sympathizing. Everything feels like a direct attack to him at the moment.</p><p>Mentally sighing, he falls back in step with Cynthia, feeling bound to her at least until she knows she\u2019s safe. She may be mean and sarcastic and all the synonyms of angry in one person, but after she\u2019s arrived where she needs to go, Harry will never have to see her again. This thought gives him a bit of relief. She really is draining on his energy and he feels the need to pack a bowl just being around her.</p><p>They\u2019ve been walking in uncomfortable silence for a mile now and she stopped protesting his presence about half a mile ago. The sky eventually turned dark and the stars have come out from behind their cloudy curtains when they finally approach a small neighborhood full of neatly stacked white houses and manicured lawns, most of which are full of blooming yellow black eyed susans and crisp white hydrangeas. She walks a bit quicker, a skip in her step as she nears a white blocked house with pale yellow window shutters and the number 19 in gold lettering on the front door. As she hops up the steps, her bell bottoms swish against the ground.</p><p>She turns around. Narrowing her dark eyes yet again, she bites out a curt, \u201cthank you\u201d. Harry\u2019s about to smile but before he does she follows up with a, \u201cthank you, really. For hitting me with <i>Candace</i>. That\u2019s a hardcore stripper name, you know,\u201d she blows a piece of thick onyx hair out of her face. \u201cI didn\u2019t need you to walk me home. Really. So I\u2019m not going to give you a heartfelt thank you. <i>You hit me with your car,\u201d </i>she says pointedly. She can\u2019t believe she ended up here at the end of another seemingly routine day, standing on her front porch and looking into eyes so green it feels like she\u2019s staring at a motionless forest, waiting for the trees to move. </p><p>\u201cHave a wonderful night, Henry.\u201d </p><p>And with that, Cynthia closes her front door with a flourish and in the quiet night, Harry can hear the lock click shut. \u201cIt\u2019s Harry,\u201d he says out loud to no one but himself. </p><p>\u201cFucking Cynthia,\u201d he grumbles before twisting on his heel so fast it almost creates smoke, briskly walking down the single road in the complex back to Woodstock. He hears a flutter in the bush to his right and the brisk pace turns into a jog. </p><p>\u201cFucking <i>Cynthia</i>,\u201d he repeats, shaking his head.</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>Gaia</h1><p>Idek what this is, it&rsquo;s just an idea that came to me upon looking at that one pic of harry sitting on the grass with a red bandanna around his neck and sunglasses on his head. Nothin too serious but I thought I&rsquo;d post bc it&rsquo;s 7 am and why not? 4.5k words of nonsense</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/tempmediahashed.tumblr.com/3518acf00ae49445323c663f015d5b82/tumblr_pdaq2hN6gs1silg1u_raw.jpg\">External image</div></figure><p>In the flat green fields of Woodstock, New York, a young man sits with his knees pulled lazily to his chest. He&rsquo;s found the perfect place to disappear, a tucked away corner in the shade of a large elm tree, a refuge from the constant commotion of the festival happening around him. It&rsquo;s only the first day and he&rsquo;s seen about 30 people carted away on makeshift stretchers either due to heat stroke, dehydration or too much LSD, about two thirds of them most likely suffering from all three. Scoping out the bodies swaying barefoot to the tune up of an electric guitar, he lets his mind wander. To this morning, finally dragging himself out of the body-sized indent in his bed. To last night, lying beneath the stars on the hood of his 1957 Cadillac, soft palms resting right on the hot metal as if it could burn the fingerprints right off his body. As if it could burn the existence right out of him.</p><p>To last month and the letter in the mail that changed the coursing river of his fate. The swiftness of the water sludged down to a motionless one, not a ripple to be seen for miles. He thought back to the letter, written in blue ink, written five states away in a room he&rsquo;s never seen before. She sat in that unfamiliar room, on an unfamiliar chair and whipped out the most formal stationary she owned and proceeded to cross her T&rsquo;s and dot her I&rsquo;s and break his heart. She used to spray her letters with his favorite perfume of hers so that when they arrived they would carry a sweet reminder; that she remembered the small details about him, that she remembered enough of him to call it love. </p><p>When the mailman unceremoniously dropped the pile of bills and subscriptions and a single handwritten letter onto his entryway floor he didn&rsquo;t know he would spend the rest of the day in his room, on his bed, staring at the blazing summer sun making its way across his wall. The letter, adorned with drying tear stains that marred the pretty blue cursive, was absent of any faint trace of lemon. It was more bitter than the words that played on repeat in his mind, a record player skipping on the ugliest part of the song and distorting itself into a continuous screech. Words saying over and over again, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not you, it&rsquo;s the distance&rdquo;. As if she wasn&rsquo;t the one who created the distance in the first place. </p><p>The unmistakable sound of a cheering crowd brought him back to the present. Harry felt the grass poking at the tender skin of his hands as he ran them back and forth lazily to the music emitting from the speakers. A band he didn&rsquo;t know the name of just walked on stage and everyone went wild, tipping their beers and sloshing the beverage all over the ground below them. He frowned, looking across the littered lawn at the variety of trash blanketing the green earth. Piles of cups, cans and bottles discarded, cigarette butts and clipped joints burned amongst wrappers of fast food and flyers showcasing the lineups for the day. He thought it was such an unnecessary thing to do as the large dumpsters lining the perimeters stood empty and void of their purpose. It was unfair. And he suddenly felt a great need to do something about it. Anything to get his mind off her.</p><p>Harry stood to his feet and brushed off the back of his pants so they would be free of dirt, ignoring the inevitable grass stains on his dark grey corduroys, and fixed the red bandanna tied loosely around his collar. He took off in the direction of the largest trash pile. He hadn&rsquo;t even wanted to be here. He loved music, sure, but he bought these tickets months ago with his friends with the money he saved from his shoveling side job during the winter when things were drastically different. He&rsquo;s been mentally preparing himself for the amazing experience he would soon have at dear old Woodstock. He planned everything down to the minute but what he hadn&rsquo;t planned on was his girlfriend of 2 years to up and cut all forms of ties she had with him, which nowadays were only came in a weekly letter due to her having moved miles away. He couldn&rsquo;t even enjoy himself here, couldn&rsquo;t allow the music to wash over him in that special healing way it did when he heard a spectacular guitar riff or felt the beat of the drums sync up with his pulse. </p><p>So he grabbed a leaf bag that lined one of the smaller garbages towards the center of the festival and walked around, picking up single pieces of wayward trash before moving to the more compact piles. He didn&rsquo;t realize how far he&rsquo;d walked until his bag was filled to the brim with a plethora of waste and his arms started to ache in protest. Half carrying and half dragging the bag, he headed over to the industrial dumpsters and wrangled the ballooned bag over the top of the container. A hot and soupy liquid leaked onto his chest in the process and he recoiled, dropping half of the bags contents back on the ground. He groaned and with a dejected sigh and began to pick it all up again. When he straightened at the waist, he felt a pair of eyes boring holes into his back. He shrugged off the feeling as there were obviously a lot of eyes in the vicinity today and successfully got rid of the garbage once and for all. </p><p>Turning around, Harry made eye contact with a girl about 100 feet away. She looked to be around his age, maybe younger, holding a trash picker in one hand and a nearly full black garbage bag in the other. In a quick once over he notices long black hair trailing onto the ruffled shoulders of a white floral blouse that ended at the waistband of dark brown bell bottoms, giving way to thickly strapped sandals peeking underneath the fabric. She gives him a wide smile and throws up a peace sign, her chubby fingers clad with an assortment of rings on each one. He thought it must be difficult to use the picker with the clunky bands of metal hitting the switch every other second to open up the claws at the end when they didn&rsquo;t need to be opened up. He tilts his head slightly to the side and furrowing his brows he lets a small, tight smile take over his face. She must&rsquo;ve thought he was a fellow advocate for Mother Earth like her. He wasn&rsquo;t really. He just needed something to do.</p><p>Averting her gaze, he finds his way through the disjointed crowds in search of his friends, Eric and Johnny. He was hoping he could see Eric&rsquo;s circular afro bopping above the sea of bouncing heads or Johnny&rsquo;s tremendously long arms flailing out of rhythm to the heavy music sounding out through the trees. He was ready to go and they had all taken Harry&rsquo;s car to Woodstock. Fumbling with his keys, he saw a familiar body going hard in the middle of a mosh pit, semi greasy pieces of hair flying about Johnny&rsquo;s face as his bony elbows found a different target to impale every two seconds. Taking a deep breath and squaring his shoulders, Harry braved the pit. His feet were being crushed every time he took a step and he stopped just outside of the core of the mosh, hanging low in the outer edge. He called out his friends name. </p><p>&ldquo;Johnny! Johnny Menzel!&rdquo; Harry repeated his name until the letters no longer made sense and his name no longer sounded like a word. Johnny was too caught up in the music. Harry wishes he could throw away his brain, wishes he could actually enjoy himself this weekend but alas. Here he was, wanting to go home to sulk in his bed after only three hours at the festival. They were supposed to go all night, him and his friends, even after the acts had finished their gigs. He told them he would stay for them because they knew he was going through the ringer at the moment and he wanted to be that reliable Harry he was, not this flakey, emotional Harry. But here he was, going back on his word. Harry traveled further into the dense crowd of flying limbs and swirling hair and tugged on Johnny&rsquo;s shoulder, turning him around to face him. </p><p>&ldquo;Harry! Fancy seeing you here dude,&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed, brushing a sweaty strand of dirt colored hair out of his eyes in order to see his friend. Red rimmed the translucent blue irises, eyelids drooping heavily over them as a cheesy grin found its way onto his face. Harry resisted the urge to roll his eyes. Johnny was having fun, everyone around him was having fun. So why couldn&rsquo;t he? Johnny had four months of rent to worry about that was due in two days but here he was, head banging to some obscure band amidst total strangers with their own problems. Maybe that was the way to let forget about it; smoke a whole lot of weed and let your body do all the thinking. Harry felt he couldn&rsquo;t even do that, though. He just wanted to go home.</p><p>One look at Harry&rsquo;s face and Johnny could tell what he was thinking. Shaking his head quickly, he backed away from Harry with his palms up and started to walk over to the canteen where they were selling bottled water for outrageous prices. Harry followed him and watched as he whistled and started picking at the bush next to the table, seemingly interested in its foliage. Harry knew what he was doing, having seen this same scene play out hundreds of times. The person in the chair counting money didn&rsquo;t notice when Johnny swiped a cold bottle from the row and strutted away, Harry scoffing and trailing behind. </p><p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; Harry says, catching up to Johnny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay the whole day tomorrow, I promise. I just can&rsquo;t today. It&rsquo;s too hot and&hellip;loud,&rdquo; Harry finished, grasping for any excuse and coming up short. Of course it&rsquo;s loud and sweaty. They&rsquo;re at a music festival. In the middle of August.</p><p>Johnny could hear the absolute bullshit in his words and whirled around, placing a cold and condensated hand on Harry&rsquo;s shoulder, chugging half of the water in one gulp before opening his mouth. &ldquo;Yeah, because that&rsquo;s totally the reason you want to leave before Janis Joplin comes on stage. You know, the quote unquote love of your short lived life? The woman you&rsquo;ve obsessed over since you knew what a boner was?&rdquo; Harry smacked Johnny&rsquo;s hand off his shoulder, suppressing an intense blush before groaning. He should know by now to never tell his friends anything about himself.</p><p>&ldquo;Man, I told you that in confidence,&rdquo; Harry whines. </p><p>&ldquo;You were drunk off your ass and announced that Janis Joplin gave you musical hard ons to a garage full of people. Don&rsquo;t act all scandalized. You do it to yourself,&rdquo; Johnny quips. &ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; he continues animatedly. &ldquo;Eric and I told you we were going to <i>drag</i> you out of that house if it was the last thing we did. And we did it. You can&rsquo;t stay in that musty room anymore. I get that you&rsquo;re hurt, man, I really do,&rdquo; Harry crosses his arms at this statement but that doesn&rsquo;t deter Johnny. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve been talking about this forever! I should&rsquo;ve spent most of this money on rent but here I am, getting paid in <i>experience</i>. This is too groovy man, and you&rsquo;re making it seem like a chore,&rdquo; Johnny ends his miniature rant with a pouty bottom lip and what seems like a stab at a comforting voice but all it sounds like to Harry is pitying. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going home,&rdquo; Harry announces, choosing to ignore the well meaning monologue. He jingles his keys in front of Johnny&rsquo;s face, the 8 ball accesory almost making contact with his aquiline nose.&rdquo;With or without you guys.&rdquo; Johnny rears his head back.</p><p>&ldquo;Looks like it&rsquo;s without then. I&rsquo;m going to go find Eric. And together we will find a ride. If not, we&rsquo;ll just sleep on a bench or something. Maybe even on the wet grass,&rdquo; he says, letting out an exaggerated gasp. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about the experience,&rdquo; Johnny says, before turning on his heel in search of the third staple friend in their group. Harry knows he shouldn&rsquo;t feel betrayed by them. It would be unfair with all the moping they&rsquo;ve put up with and all the times they smoked a bowl on Eric&rsquo;s roof and Harry talked for hours and hours about her. Her pointy ears, her dainty wrists, her brown eyes he wanted to sow seeds in, watch flowers grow out of. Yeah, he was high. He was also sad. And they knew it. They sat there and let him talk for as long as he wanted to, even until the sun came up. They were good friends, he reminded himself on the way to his car. They just wanted to have fun. </p><p>Shoving his key into the ignition, he felt the Cadillac roar to life. He spent a full year working on this car, restoring it to its former glory. He loved his baby, even gave her a name: Candace. It wasn&rsquo;t too creative but it was something to call his own. Putting his car into reverse and letting his foot off the break, he slowly rolled backwards out of his hazardous parking space, in his own little world. He regretted being to lazy to check his blindspot when he heard a dull thud and a grunt, the sound of numerous object falling to the ground. Harry&rsquo;s eyes widened as he put the car in park, scrambling for the door handle. He missed the lock three times before successfully disarming it and opening the door. He hesitantly made his way to the back of Candace, heart racing. He just hit someone. </p><p>In the two seconds it took to get to the bumper, Harry&rsquo;s thought process went something like this; <i>Oh my god. I just hit someone with my car. I&rsquo;m in so much shit. Deep shit. Center of the Earth shit. They&rsquo;ll sue me. Wait, what if they&rsquo;re can&rsquo;t sue me because they&rsquo;re dead? I wasn&rsquo;t going that fast, was I? What if they hit their head on Candace on the way down to their demise? What if there&rsquo;s blood? I can&rsquo;t handle blood! Oh my god, I&rsquo;m going the throw up ohmygodohmygodohmygod. </i></p><p>Rounding the back of the car (and discretely flicking his gaze to the headlight for any sign of damage), he sees a familiar pair of thick and strappy sandals and his heart drops even more. It was Hippie Girl he just mowed over with his car. He stands there, frozen as she begins to stir, loud groans escaping her lips. She tries to sit up and Harry finally moves, rushing over and dropping to his knees, making sure to cradle her head so she doesn&rsquo;t hurt anything else. </p><p>Upon opening her eyes, his breath catches. They&rsquo;re the deepest shade of brown he&rsquo;s ever seen and it chills him to the bone. It&rsquo;s an unsettling stare. Various emotions pass over her face like clouds in the sky ranging from shock, confusion, pain and then finally, anger. She winces and takes a stuttered breath, opening up her deeply bowed mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;What the <i>hell</i> just happened,&rdquo; she questions angrily. Her thick brows furrow and dimple her forehead in the process. She turns her dark eyes left and right as if to gather her bearings before connecting with his, a recognizance sparking to life behind them like a flame. He gulps, praying silently for the Earth to swallow him up. </p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Harry drawls out, unsure of how to say it. &ldquo;I kind of backed into you with Candace. But not on purpose! I was&hellip;changing the radio station,&rdquo; he lies, not wanting to seem like a wack job that doesn&rsquo;t deserve his license. &ldquo;I am so, so, so, so, so incredibly, terribly sorry. Here let me help you.&rdquo;</p><p>With one hand on her back and the other wrapped around her wrist, he gently helps her up. As soon as she rises to her feet, she swats his hands away. Grimacing, she rotates her neck side to side and finds that it&rsquo;s only a bit sore and still capable of full motion. Testing out the rest of her body, she stretches out her limbs, flinching slightly when she takes a step forward. Lifting her shirt to expose her hip where Harry assumes he hit with his car, he sees the start of a nasty bruise spreading into the waist of her dark brown jeans the same time she does. Lifting her head, he sees her face turn red with anger. A sharp inhale leaves both of their mouths. <i>Uh oh,</i> Harry thinks to himself. <i>I&rsquo;m definitely getting sued. </i></p><p>The Hippie Girl starts mumbling under her breath. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh, what are you doing?&rdquo; Harry asks uneasily. He really didn&rsquo;t feel like getting cursed by your run of the mill Woodstock Witch, no matter how much he deserved it. She ignores him and &nbsp;turns her focus to the trash bag lying half empty in the dirt, its contents splayed all around them, many having rolled under nearby cars. She closes her eyes in defeat. Harry, feeling awful, hurriedly bends down to pick up all the garbage he can fit into his arms, not caring this time around if any mysterious liquid drips onto him. </p><p>Stuffing the armful of random waste into the bag at her feet, he hears what she&rsquo;s saying. He stays crouched, cocking his head. She&rsquo;s not saying any words, just counting. The numbers drop down from one hundred in threes, it seems. He pauses to listens. <i>97, 94, 91, 88, 85, 82</i>&hellip;The numbers stop suddenly at 79 and he looks up to see her looking at him, almost black eyes narrowed. He straightens up quickly, clearing his throat. &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he says frantically. &ldquo;You have to understand how sorry I am. I&rsquo;m not usually the type of guy who goes around running over girls with his car.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I would hope not,&rdquo; she shoots back. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky I have somewhere to be or else I would really be laying into you, dude. Changing radio stations? Really? Are you that shitty of a driver?&rdquo; She puts her hands on her fleshy hips, forgetting about the bruise and cursing quietly. &ldquo;Whatever,&rdquo; she says softly, almost to herself, diverting her gaze to the sad looking trash bag. &ldquo;I have somewhere to be.&rdquo; </p><p>Reaching down to get a firm grip on the bag, Harry stops her. He feels like the worst person in the world. He can&rsquo;t let her leave like this. </p><p>He could&rsquo;ve hurt her way worse than a bruise. And he already felt horrible about the bruise, sucking in his own breath like he was the one who got hit when he saw it. Taking the bag from her, his hands dwarfing her own ring covered ones, he jogs over to the nearest dumpster before she can protest and throws it in. Returning to her, he holds up his hands in some type of truce. </p><p>&ldquo;Where are you going? Maybe you could let me take you there. It&rsquo;s the least I can do. And if you&rsquo;re in such a hurry, driving would get you to wherever you need to go way faster than your tiny feet could. Not that there&rsquo;s anything wrong with tiny feet,&rdquo; he hurries out. &ldquo;Just can&rsquo;t cover as much ground as my Candace,&rdquo; he finishes with a proud smile and a knuckle rapping twice on the trunk. </p><p>&ldquo;As if I&rsquo;m sitting in the same car that ran me over. A car that you named <i>Candace</i>. No chance buddy,&rdquo; she says, already twisting her body to physically leave the conversation. Harry inwardly groans. She seemed more than capable of doing things on her own and she definitely didn&rsquo;t want Harry&rsquo;s company but he felt like he owed her. Scratch that. He didn&rsquo;t just <i>feel</i> like he owed her: he absolutely knew that he did. He hit her with his car! </p><p>He watches her retreating figure for a full minute before deciding to catch up to her. If she didn&rsquo;t accept his ride, he would at least see her arrive to her destination safely. </p><p>&ldquo;What do you think you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo; she asks, side eyeing his profile. She&rsquo;s made it all the way to the entrance of the festival full of congested cars. He shrugs his shoulder, remaining silent as they walk, not quite together, but not quite like strangers. </p><p>She weaves her way in between the vehicles, a bit more wary now that she knows what it&rsquo;s like to be rammed into by one of them. He walks behind her, observing her straight posture and confident walk silhouetted by the setting sun. The dying star turned the frizzy halo around the crown of her head an orange tint and made her swinging hands glint brightly, courtesy of the multiple rings that called her fingers home. Her blouse was falling off one shoulder, sporting a couple dirt stains on the white fabric from her fall. Another thing he was sorry about. His eyes wander down to the swell of her backside against the tightness of her bell bottoms. He almost doesn&rsquo;t notice she&rsquo;s stopped walking and thankfully he does in time, or else he would&rsquo;ve ran into her. That would&rsquo;ve been bad. That would have brought on an onslaught of, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t drive AND you can&rsquo;t walk? How did you even get this far in life being a total safety hazard?&rdquo; </p><p>Harry can just hear it now. </p><p>She&rsquo;s stopped in her tracks because a small fender bender blocks her path. She huffs and turns around not knowing how close Harry is, running right into his  chest and bouncing back. &ldquo;Woah there,&rdquo; he says, putting both hands on her upper arms to steady her. </p><p>She shrugs him off and lets her feet carry her to the left, through a break in bumper to bumper traffic. Harry follows, of course. He thinks just a bit more than normal before opening his mouth. &ldquo;You think they&rsquo;d see the traffic and the sun setting and turn around to go home, wouldn&rsquo;t you? Like, day one&rsquo;s almost over, the acts are wrapping up their sets,&rdquo; he says matter-of-factly. She doesn&rsquo;t say anything, just nods her head infinitesimally in grudging agreement. Harry takes this as a good sign. She&rsquo;s no longer biting at his head.</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; he starts off. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name? I&rsquo;m Harry. Harry Styles. And, again, I&rsquo;m so sorry I hit you with my car.&rdquo; He finds himself by her side, walking faster to keep up. <i>Maybe her tiny feet aren&rsquo;t so ineffectual,</i> he thinks with a huff. She doesn&rsquo;t seem to be too eager to answer him so he presses further. </p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing here anyway? At Woodstock I mean. You don&rsquo;t look like you were enjoying the music so I&rsquo;m just curious as to why someone spends their Friday afternoon picking up other people&rsquo;s messes. Seems kinda pointless if you ask me,&rdquo; he says, rubbing a large hand around the nape of his neck. This garners a reaction from her and she looks up at him, an incredulous look on her otherwise serene face. </p><p>&ldquo;My name is <i>Cynthia</i>,&rdquo; she begins, voice gaining more traction as she goes on. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s a good thing no one asked you then. I&rsquo;m here because a bunch of environmentally challenged idiots get together and fry their brains to the sound of metal screeching on metal and create more litter than what&rsquo;s found in a town dump. I&rsquo;m <i>here</i> because no one but me seems to care about the environment. Do you know how much waste this godforsaken festival generates? And do you know how often they let it be stampeded into the Earth? They don&rsquo;t clean this shit up, man,&rdquo; she swears and breathes in, continuing her spiel. &ldquo;I mean I thought <i>you</i> cared. Do you? Or is your favorite pastime just taking out random pedestrians with your obnoxiously red car like it&rsquo;s a bowling ball and we&rsquo;re the pins?&rdquo; She finishes her last sentence with a snark. </p><p>Harry raises his eyebrows in surprise, halting mid step. Whatever he says is the wrong thing, so he just purses his lips and stares straight ahead. <i>If I just stayed with Johnny and Eric, I wouldn&rsquo;t be stuck with this self righteous hippie,</i> he thinks. He knows she has every right to be angry but he&rsquo;s been in too bad of a mood to even begin sympathizing. Everything feels like a direct attack to him at the moment.</p><p>Mentally sighing, he falls back in step with Cynthia, feeling bound to her at least until she knows she&rsquo;s safe. She may be mean and sarcastic and all the synonyms of angry in one person, but after she&rsquo;s arrived where she needs to go, Harry will never have to see her again. This thought gives him a bit of relief. She really is draining on his energy and he feels the need to pack a bowl just being around her.</p><p>They&rsquo;ve been walking in uncomfortable silence for a mile now and she stopped protesting his presence about half a mile ago. The sky eventually turned dark and the stars have come out from behind their cloudy curtains when they finally approach a small neighborhood full of neatly stacked white houses and manicured lawns, most of which are full of blooming yellow black eyed susans and crisp white hydrangeas. She walks a bit quicker, a skip in her step as she nears a white blocked house with pale yellow window shutters and the number 19 in gold lettering on the front door. As she hops up the steps, her bell bottoms swish against the ground.</p><p>She turns around. Narrowing her dark eyes yet again, she bites out a curt, &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;. Harry&rsquo;s about to smile but before he does she follows up with a, &ldquo;thank you, really. For hitting me with <i>Candace</i>. That&rsquo;s a hardcore stripper name, you know,&rdquo; she blows a piece of thick onyx hair out of her face. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t need you to walk me home. Really. So I&rsquo;m not going to give you a heartfelt thank you. <i>You hit me with your car,&rdquo; </i>she says pointedly. She can&rsquo;t believe she ended up here at the end of another seemingly routine day, standing on her front porch and looking into eyes so green it feels like she&rsquo;s staring at a motionless forest, waiting for the trees to move. </p><p>&ldquo;Have a wonderful night, Henry.&rdquo; </p><p>And with that, Cynthia closes her front door with a flourish and in the quiet night, Harry can hear the lock click shut. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Harry,&rdquo; he says out loud to no one but himself. </p><p>&ldquo;Fucking Cynthia,&rdquo; he grumbles before twisting on his heel so fast it almost creates smoke, briskly walking down the single road in the complex back to Woodstock. He hears a flutter in the bush to his right and the brisk pace turns into a jog. </p><p>&ldquo;Fucking <i>Cynthia</i>,&rdquo; he repeats, shaking his head.</p></p>",

She splashes some water onto her face before replying.</p><p>\u201cHar, my man, my baby love, my bub, I\u2019m so sorry, just give me\u2014 30\nminutes\u2014 and I\u2019ll\u2014fly\u2014 right over,\u201d the words tumble out of her lips, grunting\nas she forcefully attempts to jerk herself into her jeans.

Something <i>affordable</i>,\u201d\nshe includes the last bit on hindsight, knowing that he literally has a\nproclivity towards expensive tastes.</p><p>\u201cNice and savoury\u2026 hmm.

Her\neyes catch his smug face watching her. She walks towards him and smiles,\nlooking around and making sure no one catches her grinning like a fool for no\nobvious reason.</p><p>\u201cHow are, uh\u2026 how are the goods?\u201d she feigns suspicion, speaking\nin hushed tones and sliding into the seat across from him.</p><p>\u201cI only sell the good, pure stuff. Take it or leave it, buddy,\u201d he\npushes her iced coffee to her, playing along with her charade. She envelopes\nthe cup in both of her hands, the condensation rolling down her fingers. She\nsips the drink, not losing the green eyes from her sight. She swallows it down,\nsmacking her tongue against the roof of her mouth and frowning.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIced coffee,\u201d he shrugs, too nonchalantly and taking a sip of\nhis. She keeps her eyes fixed on him.</p><p>\u201cJust a normal iced coffee? A basic cuppa joe? No, it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s\ntoo strong\u2026 Harry, what is it?\u201d She interrogates him. When she sees his dimple\nsurfacing and his eyes twinkling mischievously, she begins to feel on edge.</p><p>\u201cMight\u2019ve added an extra espresso shot or two,\u201d he remarked. She\nraises an eyebrow, not understanding what the big deal is.</p><p>\u201cOh. Thanks, I guess\u2026\u201d she trails off. But when he doesn\u2019t wipe\nthe smile off his face, her guard is raised again. \u201cAm I missing something\nhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh\u2026 We\u2019ll see.\u201d he scrunches his nose and squints his eyes,\nnodding and sending a toothless smile her way.</p><p><br/></p><p>It took about an hour before Y/N realised why he had been so sly\nabout the coffee.</p><p>And Harry? He loves it. It\u2019s like he\u2019s gotten her drunk, without\nthe alcohol.</p><p>\u201cHar, Har\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, darling?\u201d he goes to his default response in the past\nfew minutes, propping his head onto the palm of his hand.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever wondered about spiders\u2019 careers?\u201d</p><p>His head tilts and his face contorts in amused incredulity,\nwondering where the hell she could possibly be going with this one.</p><p>\u201cY/N, why would I wonder about a spider\u2019s career?\u201d he breaks into\nspurts of laughter mid-sentence. Seeing his reaction, she laughs too, but not\nbefore tutting him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the joke yet! Hush! So, come on, have you?\u201d she grabs\nhis arm, urgently awaiting an answer.</p><p>\u201cThink the answer to that one is pretty obvious, innit?\u201d he holds\nback his urge to laugh, witnessing her desperation to finish her joke. In all\nhonesty, he\u2019s rather intrigued by this one.</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna know what spiders work as?\u201d she brings her voice\ndown and bends forward all childlike, almost like she\u2019s letting him in on a\nsecret.</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d he remains in his position. He actually really does.</p><p>\u201cSpiders\u2026 work as web developers.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes, running his fingers through his hair and\nshaking his head. She doesn\u2019t stop there, though. \u201cThey also have to deal with\nbugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d he sputters a laugh out. \u201cGet outta here, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpike my coffee with more espresso next time, eh?\u201d she refutes,\nreaching across the table to punch his arm playfully. He\u2019s just half a second\nquicker, though, catching her wrist. She struggles against his grip, but he\nbrings it up to his lips and plants a kiss to her knuckles.</p><p>\u201cYou bet your perky arse I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really love my arse today, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna show my arse some love, pet? After all the love\nI have given yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d she snickers, and when the moment passes, she moves on\nto another slew of endless puns.</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>After their little breakfast date gets a little loud and earns\nmore and more stares from the patrons of the caf\u00e9, they decide to escape\nthrough the back door (courtesy of Harry\u2019s charm and fame), and somehow end up\ndriving to a more obscure supermarket about a half hour away. Y/N has only\nupped the ante of her puns and jokes, the foreign extra shot of caffeine\npulsing through her veins and sending her thoughts and speech into overdrive.\nHarry certainly doesn\u2019t mind this new discovery.</p><p>They\u2019re lurking through the aisles, needing nothing in particular\n(apart from an assortment of cheeses to fuel Y/N\u2019s cheese cravings), and she\u2019s\nmaking him a victim of a number of painful puns, when she takes on a somber\nmood.</p><p>\u201cHarry\u2026\u201d she motions for him. She doesn\u2019t possess the same amount\nof excitement as she had before, prompting him to perceive that something was\noff, but he doesn\u2019t push it. He follows her, and she stops him right before the\nnext aisle.</p><p>\u201cI just want you to know\u2026 that\u2026\u201d she pauses. Now she\u2019s got him\npositively worried.</p><p>She takes him by the hand, to the next aisle. \u201cYou\u2019re,\u201d gesturing\nto the stacks and stacks of eggs behind her, \u201can eggcellent boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>The anxious countenance on his face melts into annoyance, though\nthe lopsided smile expresses his relief that it wasn\u2019t anything serious. At\nthis, she breaks out into a display of finger guns and ebbing laughter. It\u2019s\napparent that the caffeine crash was catching up with her.</p><p>\u201cThat was terrible,\u201d he remarks and, amid a relieved chuckle,\nadding, \u201cI thought you were mad about me hanging out with Joey later.\u201d</p><p>She gradually stops her movements as her expression drops\nslightly. \u201cOh. You didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>His expression drops as well. \u201cI didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>The air grows tense, but she quickly saves it. \u201cIs that the friend\nof Grimmy\u2019s? The one he\u2019s been trying to introduce to you? Say hi to\u2026 him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, her.\u201d Blood rushes to his ears, tingeing them pink in\nembarrassment and guilt. He realises how bad it all looks and sounds, and he\nknows if it were the other way around he would\u2019ve done anything to keep her\nfrom meeting this \u201cfriend of Grimmy\u2019s\u201d, especially when he wasn\u2019t around to overanalyse\nthe entire interaction. He\u2019s already half expecting her to blow at him, though the\nother half of him acknowledges just how big-hearted his muse is.</p><p>\u201cSay hi to her for me,\u201d she smiles, walking with him once she\nhooks her arm with his. He hasn\u2019t given her a reason not to trust him, yet she\u2019s\njust a tad bit intimidated because it\u2019s Grimmy\u2019s recommendation, for heaven\u2019s\nsake. He\u2019s a hilarious chap, but you can never really know what to expect when\nit comes to him.</p><p>He reaches for her arm, pulling her gently into a hug. \u201cYou\u2019re an\neggceptional girlfriend.\u201d She snuggles her face into his soft sweater, taking\nin the scent of his cologne and chuckling out her deep inhale.</p><p><br/></p><p>Y/N always expected that she would be the cool girlfriend\nwho lets her significant other hang out with other women without having to\ncheck up on him every two minutes.</p><p>But now that her mind is completely flying over Jake Peralta\u2019s\nwitticisms and jokes, she understands that the real question isn\u2019t about how chill\nshe is, but how willing she is to trust her beloved. Lying down on his couch and\nclutching nervously onto his favourite blanket, her night of having fun on her\nown is only becoming one of doubt and distraction.</p><p>So she hits the pause button on Netflix and grabs her phone.\nShe taps the messaging app, opens the chat and her thumbs are hovering, ready\nto show him some proper linguistic loving.</p><p><i>Have I ever told you\nhow much I love you?</i></p><p>She stares at that message for a while, and then deletes it.\nHer thumbs hover in circles as she thinks about her message again, all the\nwhile staring at the screen.</p><p><i>I would give up\nchocolate on my sad days for you</i></p><p>She stares at it too. <i>One\nof the top contenders</i>, she thinks, but deletes it when she realises it\ncould just come off as passive aggressive.</p><p><i>Could you get some\nchocolates for me on the way back?</i></p><p>She hits send before she can rethink her text, then hits\nplay on the TV remote. Somehow, she feels even more on edge than she was\nbefore, and her nerves lead her to get up and pace the living room while\nhumming a tune to herself. She drags her\nfeet against the rug, trying to enjoy the texture, but then she recalls how\nHarry is the kind of gentleman to not pick his phone up while talking to\nsomeone, which leads her to wonder if he would break that rule for her.</p><p>She plops on the couch. She hopes he\u2019s having fun. Not too\nmuch. Is he thinking about her like she\u2019s thinking about him? She places her\nphone further out of her reach on the coffee table and, resuming her initial\nposition, she stares at the television, slowly focusing on the show rather than\non him.</p><p><br/></p><p>When three episodes pass, she hears the front door opening\nand clicking shut, followed by a heavy exhale. She doesn\u2019t react, watching the\nnext one.</p><p>\u201cPoppet,\u201d he greets her from behind the sofa, bending down\nand kissing her temple. She hums in return. He still smells of him, which she\ntakes as a good sign, but he sounds tired.</p><p>Her attention remains fixated on the screen for a few\nminutes before he reappears in a shirt and his favourite pair of long pants to\nrelax in, taking the other side of the couch. He lifts her feet and places them\natop his thighs, absentmindedly fiddling with her toes.</p><p>\u201cHow was it?\u201d she asks, concealing her sudden hyperfocus on\nhis touch with a tone of distraction and disinterest.</p><p>\u201c\u2019S alright. A little exhausted, though. How about you? Did\nyou miss me?\u201d he replies facing her, teasing her to get her attention.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t stop thinking about you,\u201d she drones while her\neyes are still glued to the screen, not giving him the responsiveness he wants.\n</p><p>His lips curve up slightly at her perceived sarcasm and\nmutters an inaudible \u201cNeither can I\u201d, but he continues scrutinising her,\nwondering what her lack of cheeriness is all about. Yet, in his fatigue and\ngeneral dislike for conflict, he grips her by her knees and pulls her closer to\nhim.</p><p>This finally gets her to turn her gaze to him, and she crawls\nup to him, positioning herself next to him with her legs over his thighs and\nher head resting by his chest just below his shoulder. Her hands stay closed in\nher lap, though, refusing to hold his torso close like she typically does. He\nlooks down at her, confused, but connects the dots when he notices her phone is\non the table that\u2019s too pointlessly far away. </p><p>\u201cDid you read my text?\u201d he asks, stroking her hip where his\nhand rests. He can\u2019t see her eyes widening at his question, but has the\nsatisfaction of watching her get up and checking her phone. He watches her\nexpression go from one of clueless excitement to one of silent adoration (at\nleast, that\u2019s what he hopes it is). </p><p>\u201cWhat did I say?\u201d he taunts her.</p><p>\u201c<i>Got a stash for you\nlast week, there\u2019s a ton in the fridge. Knock yourself out</i>,\u201d she reads the\nmessage verbatim, holding her phone to her chest. She smiles like a child on Christmas\nmorning, and while he thinks it\u2019s just because of her craving for the\nchocolates, her heart is full because he thought of her too.</p>",

She hopes he\u2019s having fun. Not too\nmuch. Is he thinking about her like she\u2019s thinking about him? She places her\nphone further out of her reach on the coffee table and, resuming her initial\nposition, she stares at the television, slowly focusing on the show rather than\non him.</p><p><br></p><p>When three episodes pass, she hears the front door opening\nand clicking shut, followed by a heavy exhale. She doesn\u2019t react, watching the\nnext one.</p><p>\u201cPoppet,\u201d he greets her from behind the sofa, bending down\nand kissing her temple. She hums in return. He still smells of him, which she\ntakes as a good sign, but he sounds tired.</p><p>Her attention remains fixated on the screen for a few\nminutes before he reappears in a shirt and his favourite pair of long pants to\nrelax in, taking the other side of the couch. He lifts her feet and places them\natop his thighs, absentmindedly fiddling with her toes.</p><p>\u201cHow was it?\u201d she asks, concealing her sudden hyperfocus on\nhis touch with a tone of distraction and disinterest.</p><p>\u201c\u2019S alright. A little exhausted, though. How about you? Did\nyou miss me?\u201d he replies facing her, teasing her to get her attention.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t stop thinking about you,\u201d she drones while her\neyes are still glued to the screen, not giving him the responsiveness he wants.\n</p><p>His lips curve up slightly at her perceived sarcasm and\nmutters an inaudible \u201cNeither can I\u201d, but he continues scrutinising her,\nwondering what her lack of cheeriness is all about. Yet, in his fatigue and\ngeneral dislike for conflict, he grips her by her knees and pulls her closer to\nhim.</p><p>This finally gets her to turn her gaze to him, and she crawls\nup to him, positioning herself next to him with her legs over his thighs and\nher head resting by his chest just below his shoulder. Her hands stay closed in\nher lap, though, refusing to hold his torso close like she typically does. He\nlooks down at her, confused, but connects the dots when he notices her phone is\non the table that\u2019s too pointlessly far away. </p><p>\u201cDid you read my text?\u201d he asks, stroking her hip where his\nhand rests. He can\u2019t see her eyes widening at his question, but has the\nsatisfaction of watching her get up and checking her phone. He watches her\nexpression go from one of clueless excitement to one of silent adoration (at\nleast, that\u2019s what he hopes it is). </p><p>\u201cWhat did I say?\u201d he taunts her.</p><p>\u201c<i>Got a stash for you\nlast week, there\u2019s a ton in the fridge. Knock yourself out</i>,\u201d she reads the\nmessage verbatim, holding her phone to her chest. She smiles like a child on Christmas\nmorning, and while he thinks it\u2019s just because of her craving for the\nchocolates, her heart is full because he thought of her too.</p>",

Instinctively, her arm flies\nonto her eyes. She\u2019d slept really late \u2013 or early \u2013 working on a side project\nat her apartment that she got more engrossed in than she had anticipated, and\nnow she\u2019s heavily regretting that decision.</p><p>After unsuccessfully trying to find sleep again in the recesses of\nher mind, she gives up, rubbing her eyes.

Her eyes land on the\nclock on her bedside table.</p><p>Then, she goes into a proper frenzy.</p><p>\u201cShit, shit, shit!\u201d she mutters under her breath, clumsily reaching\nfor her phone and her face contorting sheepishly when she scrolls through Harry\u2019s\ntexts and 2 missed calls.</p><p><i>Bub, where are you?</i></p><p><i>Y/NNNNNNN</i></p><p><i>I bet a full breakfast meal you\u2019re still asleep</i></p><p><i>You owe me one, darling.</i></p><p>Her fingers immediately hit the dial button, putting it on speaker\nand tossing it onto her bed while she scrambles to get ready, running the tap\nand brushing her teeth in 10 seconds flat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re finally up. What were you dreaming about, me?\u201d Harry\u2019s\nvoice chimes throughout the room. The background sounds rather peaceful, which\ninclines her to imagine that he has chosen a more private spot for their little\nhang out. She splashes some water onto her face before replying.</p><p>\u201cHar, my man, my baby love, my bub, I\u2019m so sorry, just give me\u2014 30\nminutes\u2014 and I\u2019ll\u2014fly\u2014 right over,\u201d the words tumble out of her lips, grunting\nas she forcefully attempts to jerk herself into her jeans. She ignores his\nlittle tease, thankful he can\u2019t see the blush creeping up her skin at the\nthought of herself walking down the aisle towards him.</p><p>He hums. \u201cWhat will you be having?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything nice and savoury. And a good coffee, I\u2019m as good as dead\nright now. Be a sweetheart and choose something for me will you? Something <i>affordable</i>,\u201d\nshe includes the last bit on hindsight, knowing that he literally has a\nproclivity towards expensive tastes.</p><p>\u201cNice and savoury\u2026 hmm. Will my c\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cHarry!\u201d</p><p>He smirks on the other side. \u201cGet your prissy ass down here quick. Miss it already.\u201d He casually drawls in a low voice, knowing the\neffect it has on her.</p><p>She can\u2019t help the smile that etches its way on her face, and she\nspontaneously decides to spritz on a little bit of her vanilla fragrance that\nhe seems to love so much. \u201cYou can bet my ass I\u2019ll take my time now. See you\nmuch later, babe!\u201d</p><p>She giggles hearing his whine as she hangs up on him before he can\nsay anything else. Throwing a shirt on and grabbing her wallet, keys and phone,\nshe slips on her shoes and makes her way out.</p><p><br><br></p><p>Harry grins when he spots Y/N walking in big strides into the caf\u00e9.\nThe bell on the door rings and she enters, scanning the unfamiliar place. Her\neyes catch his smug face watching her. She walks towards him and smiles,\nlooking around and making sure no one catches her grinning like a fool for no\nobvious reason.</p><p>\u201cHow are, uh\u2026 how are the goods?\u201d she feigns suspicion, speaking\nin hushed tones and sliding into the seat across from him.</p><p>\u201cI only sell the good, pure stuff. Take it or leave it, buddy,\u201d he\npushes her iced coffee to her, playing along with her charade. She envelopes\nthe cup in both of her hands, the condensation rolling down her fingers. She\nsips the drink, not losing the green eyes from her sight. She swallows it down,\nsmacking her tongue against the roof of her mouth and frowning.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIced coffee,\u201d he shrugs, too nonchalantly and taking a sip of\nhis. She keeps her eyes fixed on him.</p><p>\u201cJust a normal iced coffee? A basic cuppa joe? No, it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s\ntoo strong\u2026 Harry, what is it?\u201d She interrogates him. When she sees his dimple\nsurfacing and his eyes twinkling mischievously, she begins to feel on edge.</p><p>\u201cMight\u2019ve added an extra espresso shot or two,\u201d he remarked. She\nraises an eyebrow, not understanding what the big deal is.</p><p>\u201cOh. Thanks, I guess\u2026\u201d she trails off. But when he doesn\u2019t wipe\nthe smile off his face, her guard is raised again. \u201cAm I missing something\nhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh\u2026 We\u2019ll see.\u201d he scrunches his nose and squints his eyes,\nnodding and sending a toothless smile her way.</p><p><br></p><p>It took about an hour before Y/N realised why he had been so sly\nabout the coffee.</p><p>And Harry? He loves it. It\u2019s like he\u2019s gotten her drunk, without\nthe alcohol.</p><p>\u201cHar, Har\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, darling?\u201d he goes to his default response in the past\nfew minutes, propping his head onto the palm of his hand.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever wondered about spiders\u2019 careers?\u201d</p><p>His head tilts and his face contorts in amused incredulity,\nwondering where the hell she could possibly be going with this one.</p><p>\u201cY/N, why would I wonder about a spider\u2019s career?\u201d he breaks into\nspurts of laughter mid-sentence. Seeing his reaction, she laughs too, but not\nbefore tutting him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the joke yet! Hush! So, come on, have you?\u201d she grabs\nhis arm, urgently awaiting an answer.</p><p>\u201cThink the answer to that one is pretty obvious, innit?\u201d he holds\nback his urge to laugh, witnessing her desperation to finish her joke. In all\nhonesty, he\u2019s rather intrigued by this one.</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna know what spiders work as?\u201d she brings her voice\ndown and bends forward all childlike, almost like she\u2019s letting him in on a\nsecret.</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d he remains in his position. He actually really does.</p><p>\u201cSpiders\u2026 work as web developers.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes, running his fingers through his hair and\nshaking his head. She doesn\u2019t stop there, though. \u201cThey also have to deal with\nbugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d he sputters a laugh out. \u201cGet outta here, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpike my coffee with more espresso next time, eh?\u201d she refutes,\nreaching across the table to punch his arm playfully. He\u2019s just half a second\nquicker, though, catching her wrist. She struggles against his grip, but he\nbrings it up to his lips and plants a kiss to her knuckles.</p><p>\u201cYou bet your perky arse I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really love my arse today, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna show my arse some love, pet?

Instinctively, her arm flies\nonto her eyes. She&rsquo;d slept really late &ndash; or early &ndash; working on a side project\nat her apartment that she got more engrossed in than she had anticipated, and\nnow she&rsquo;s heavily regretting that decision.</p><p>After unsuccessfully trying to find sleep again in the recesses of\nher mind, she gives up, rubbing her eyes. They were moving at half speed,\nseemingly weighed down by the remainders of fatigue that are refusing to leave\nher body.</p><p>She curses her body for not being able to &ldquo;make up your damn mind&rdquo;,\nsighing as she pulls her limbs into a satisfying stretch. Her eyes land on the\nclock on her bedside table.</p><p>Then, she goes into a proper frenzy.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit, shit, shit!&rdquo; she mutters under her breath, clumsily reaching\nfor her phone and her face contorting sheepishly when she scrolls through Harry&rsquo;s\ntexts and 2 missed calls.</p><p><i>Bub, where are you?</i></p><p><i>Y/NNNNNNN</i></p><p><i>I bet a full breakfast meal you&rsquo;re still asleep</i></p><p><i>You owe me one, darling.</i></p><p>Her fingers immediately hit the dial button, putting it on speaker\nand tossing it onto her bed while she scrambles to get ready, running the tap\nand brushing her teeth in 10 seconds flat.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re finally up. What were you dreaming about, me?&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s\nvoice chimes throughout the room. The background sounds rather peaceful, which\ninclines her to imagine that he has chosen a more private spot for their little\nhang out. She splashes some water onto her face before replying.</p><p>&ldquo;Har, my man, my baby love, my bub, I&rsquo;m so sorry, just give me&mdash; 30\nminutes&mdash; and I&rsquo;ll&mdash;fly&mdash; right over,&rdquo; the words tumble out of her lips, grunting\nas she forcefully attempts to jerk herself into her jeans. She ignores his\nlittle tease, thankful he can&rsquo;t see the blush creeping up her skin at the\nthought of herself walking down the aisle towards him.</p><p>He hums. &ldquo;What will you be having?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anything nice and savoury. And a good coffee, I&rsquo;m as good as dead\nright now. Be a sweetheart and choose something for me will you? Something <i>affordable</i>,&rdquo;\nshe includes the last bit on hindsight, knowing that he literally has a\nproclivity towards expensive tastes.</p><p>&ldquo;Nice and savoury&hellip; hmm. Will my c&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry!&rdquo;</p><p>He smirks on the other side. &ldquo;Get your prissy ass down here quick. Miss it already.&rdquo; He casually drawls in a low voice, knowing the\neffect it has on her.</p><p>She can&rsquo;t help the smile that etches its way on her face, and she\nspontaneously decides to spritz on a little bit of her vanilla fragrance that\nhe seems to love so much. &ldquo;You can bet my ass I&rsquo;ll take my time now. See you\nmuch later, babe!&rdquo;</p><p>She giggles hearing his whine as she hangs up on him before he can\nsay anything else. Throwing a shirt on and grabbing her wallet, keys and phone,\nshe slips on her shoes and makes her way out.</p><p><br /><br /></p><p>Harry grins when he spots Y/N walking in big strides into the caf&eacute;.\nThe bell on the door rings and she enters, scanning the unfamiliar place. Her\neyes catch his smug face watching her. She walks towards him and smiles,\nlooking around and making sure no one catches her grinning like a fool for no\nobvious reason.</p><p>&ldquo;How are, uh&hellip; how are the goods?&rdquo; she feigns suspicion, speaking\nin hushed tones and sliding into the seat across from him.</p><p>&ldquo;I only sell the good, pure stuff. Take it or leave it, buddy,&rdquo; he\npushes her iced coffee to her, playing along with her charade. She envelopes\nthe cup in both of her hands, the condensation rolling down her fingers. She\nsips the drink, not losing the green eyes from her sight. She swallows it down,\nsmacking her tongue against the roof of her mouth and frowning.</p><p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Iced coffee,&rdquo; he shrugs, too nonchalantly and taking a sip of\nhis. She keeps her eyes fixed on him.</p><p>&ldquo;Just a normal iced coffee? A basic cuppa joe? No, it isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s\ntoo strong&hellip; Harry, what is it?&rdquo; She interrogates him. When she sees his dimple\nsurfacing and his eyes twinkling mischievously, she begins to feel on edge.</p><p>&ldquo;Might&rsquo;ve added an extra espresso shot or two,&rdquo; he remarked. She\nraises an eyebrow, not understanding what the big deal is.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh. Thanks, I guess&hellip;&rdquo; she trails off. But when he doesn&rsquo;t wipe\nthe smile off his face, her guard is raised again. &ldquo;Am I missing something\nhere?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Eh&hellip; We&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo; he scrunches his nose and squints his eyes,\nnodding and sending a toothless smile her way.</p><p><br /></p><p>It took about an hour before Y/N realised why he had been so sly\nabout the coffee.</p><p>And Harry? He loves it. It&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s gotten her drunk, without\nthe alcohol.</p><p>&ldquo;Har, Har&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is it, darling?&rdquo; he goes to his default response in the past\nfew minutes, propping his head onto the palm of his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you ever wondered about spiders&rsquo; careers?&rdquo;</p><p>His head tilts and his face contorts in amused incredulity,\nwondering where the hell she could possibly be going with this one.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, why would I wonder about a spider&rsquo;s career?&rdquo; he breaks into\nspurts of laughter mid-sentence. Seeing his reaction, she laughs too, but not\nbefore tutting him.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the joke yet! Hush! So, come on, have you?&rdquo; she grabs\nhis arm, urgently awaiting an answer.</p><p>&ldquo;Think the answer to that one is pretty obvious, innit?&rdquo; he holds\nback his urge to laugh, witnessing her desperation to finish her joke. In all\nhonesty, he&rsquo;s rather intrigued by this one.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you wanna know what spiders work as?&rdquo; she brings her voice\ndown and bends forward all childlike, almost like she&rsquo;s letting him in on a\nsecret.</p><p>&ldquo;Do I?&rdquo; he remains in his position. He actually really does.</p><p>&ldquo;Spiders&hellip; work as web developers.&rdquo;</p><p>He rolls his eyes, running his fingers through his hair and\nshaking his head. She doesn&rsquo;t stop there, though. &ldquo;They also have to deal with\nbugs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, God,&rdquo; he sputters a laugh out. &ldquo;Get outta here, will you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Spike my coffee with more espresso next time, eh?&rdquo; she refutes,\nreaching across the table to punch his arm playfully. He&rsquo;s just half a second\nquicker, though, catching her wrist. She struggles against his grip, but he\nbrings it up to his lips and plants a kiss to her knuckles.</p><p>&ldquo;You bet your perky arse I will.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You really love my arse today, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not gonna show my arse some love, pet? After all the love\nI have given yours?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo; she snickers, and when the moment passes, she moves on\nto another slew of endless puns.</p><p><br /><br /></p><p>After their little breakfast date gets a little loud and earns\nmore and more stares from the patrons of the caf&eacute;, they decide to escape\nthrough the back door (courtesy of Harry&rsquo;s charm and fame), and somehow end up\ndriving to a more obscure supermarket about a half hour away. Y/N has only\nupped the ante of her puns and jokes, the foreign extra shot of caffeine\npulsing through her veins and sending her thoughts and speech into overdrive.\nHarry certainly doesn&rsquo;t mind this new discovery.</p><p>They&rsquo;re lurking through the aisles, needing nothing in particular\n(apart from an assortment of cheeses to fuel Y/N&rsquo;s cheese cravings), and she&rsquo;s\nmaking him a victim of a number of painful puns, when she takes on a somber\nmood.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry&hellip;&rdquo; she motions for him. She doesn&rsquo;t possess the same amount\nof excitement as she had before, prompting him to perceive that something was\noff, but he doesn&rsquo;t push it. He follows her, and she stops him right before the\nnext aisle.</p><p>&ldquo;I just want you to know&hellip; that&hellip;&rdquo; she pauses. Now she&rsquo;s got him\npositively worried.</p><p>She takes him by the hand, to the next aisle. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re,&rdquo; gesturing\nto the stacks and stacks of eggs behind her, &ldquo;an eggcellent boyfriend.&rdquo;</p><p>The anxious countenance on his face melts into annoyance, though\nthe lopsided smile expresses his relief that it wasn&rsquo;t anything serious. At\nthis, she breaks out into a display of finger guns and ebbing laughter. It&rsquo;s\napparent that the caffeine crash was catching up with her.</p><p>&ldquo;That was terrible,&rdquo; he remarks and, amid a relieved chuckle,\nadding, &ldquo;I thought you were mad about me hanging out with Joey later.&rdquo;</p><p>She gradually stops her movements as her expression drops\nslightly. &ldquo;Oh. You didn&rsquo;t tell me.&rdquo;</p><p>His expression drops as well. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p><p>The air grows tense, but she quickly saves it. &ldquo;Is that the friend\nof Grimmy&rsquo;s? The one he&rsquo;s been trying to introduce to you? Say hi to&hellip; him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, her.&rdquo; Blood rushes to his ears, tingeing them pink in\nembarrassment and guilt. He realises how bad it all looks and sounds, and he\nknows if it were the other way around he would&rsquo;ve done anything to keep her\nfrom meeting this &ldquo;friend of Grimmy&rsquo;s&rdquo;, especially when he wasn&rsquo;t around to overanalyse\nthe entire interaction. He&rsquo;s already half expecting her to blow at him, though the\nother half of him acknowledges just how big-hearted his muse is.</p><p>&ldquo;Say hi to her for me,&rdquo; she smiles, walking with him once she\nhooks her arm with his. He hasn&rsquo;t given her a reason not to trust him, yet she&rsquo;s\njust a tad bit intimidated because it&rsquo;s Grimmy&rsquo;s recommendation, for heaven&rsquo;s\nsake. He&rsquo;s a hilarious chap, but you can never really know what to expect when\nit comes to him.</p><p>He reaches for her arm, pulling her gently into a hug. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an\neggceptional girlfriend.&rdquo; She snuggles her face into his soft sweater, taking\nin the scent of his cologne and chuckling out her deep inhale.</p><p><br /></p><p>Y/N always expected that she would be the cool girlfriend\nwho lets her significant other hang out with other women without having to\ncheck up on him every two minutes.</p><p>But now that her mind is completely flying over Jake Peralta&rsquo;s\nwitticisms and jokes, she understands that the real question isn&rsquo;t about how chill\nshe is, but how willing she is to trust her beloved. Lying down on his couch and\nclutching nervously onto his favourite blanket, her night of having fun on her\nown is only becoming one of doubt and distraction.</p><p>So she hits the pause button on Netflix and grabs her phone.\nShe taps the messaging app, opens the chat and her thumbs are hovering, ready\nto show him some proper linguistic loving.</p><p><i>Have I ever told you\nhow much I love you?</i></p><p>She stares at that message for a while, and then deletes it.\nHer thumbs hover in circles as she thinks about her message again, all the\nwhile staring at the screen.</p><p><i>I would give up\nchocolate on my sad days for you</i></p><p>She stares at it too. <i>One\nof the top contenders</i>, she thinks, but deletes it when she realises it\ncould just come off as passive aggressive.</p><p><i>Could you get some\nchocolates for me on the way back?</i></p><p>She hits send before she can rethink her text, then hits\nplay on the TV remote. Somehow, she feels even more on edge than she was\nbefore, and her nerves lead her to get up and pace the living room while\nhumming a tune to herself. She drags her\nfeet against the rug, trying to enjoy the texture, but then she recalls how\nHarry is the kind of gentleman to not pick his phone up while talking to\nsomeone, which leads her to wonder if he would break that rule for her.</p><p>She plops on the couch. She hopes he&rsquo;s having fun. Not too\nmuch. Is he thinking about her like she&rsquo;s thinking about him? She places her\nphone further out of her reach on the coffee table and, resuming her initial\nposition, she stares at the television, slowly focusing on the show rather than\non him.</p><p><br /></p><p>When three episodes pass, she hears the front door opening\nand clicking shut, followed by a heavy exhale.
