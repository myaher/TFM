His hands rest on your arms as he gives you a look of confusion.\u00a0\u201cSince when are you on a first name basis with Mr, Mr Stark?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You shrug your shoulder as you step forward, forcing Peter from your path so you can continue walking.\u00a0\u201cSince he called me to talk about you, and about your suit.\u201d You mutter the last part, but with his spidey senses, nothing is missed with Peter. Well, almost nothing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat about my suit?\u201d His tone becomes sterner as Peter keeps his eyes on you, watching as you nervously lick your lips and keep your gaze fixated on the ground.\u00a0\u201cY/n,\u201d Peter drags your name out, knowing you\u2019ll tell him if he annoys it out of you.\u00a0<br/></p><p>A short sigh escapes your lips as you reach your front door. As you walk up the steps and place your books down you turn back to face Peter.\u00a0\u201cTony thinks he should take your suit away for a while.\u201d You try and break the news gently to him, but his mouth hangs open in shock as his eyes widen.\u00a0</p><p>Waving your hand in front of his face, he snaps out of it and you sit down on your front step, waiting for the rambles to commence.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cWwwhat Mr Stark can\u2019t take my suit, I love my suit and don\u2019t get me wrong the tech in it is amazing but there are alterations I\u2019d make but I don\u2019t want him to take it I mean why does he need to take it?\u201d As he finishes he blankly stares at you, waiting for a response as you stutter.\u00a0</p><p>Rising to your feet, you unlock your front door and pick up your textbooks.\u00a0\u201cHonestly Peter? I think you need to talk to Tony about it.\u201d You reply before holding the door open, but Peter remains still.\u00a0\u201cYou coming in? I\u2019m sure Mom will make some of your favourite pizza?\u201d You beam, but Peter lowers his head shaking it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, but tell your Mom I said hi. I, I\u2019ll see you at school tomorrow.\u201d Peter speaks softly, trying to disguise the disappointment in his tone as he walks away from your house and turns left, disappearing out of sight.<br/></p><p>You shut your front door, leaning against it as your Mom appears from the kitchen.\u00a0\u201cOh sweetie, I know it\u2019s hard,\u201d She softly tells you as she leads you into the kitchen, presenting you with a cup of coffee.\u00a0\u201cbeing best friends with the guy you like? Nightmare.\u201d She chuckles as I sip the coffee.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo how do I get out of it being a nightmare?\u201d You question as she switches the oven on before turning back to face you.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cSpend quality time together. I know you and Peter are as thick as thieves. It\u2019s just boys, especially teenage boys are oblivious to what\u2019s in front of them.\u201d She explains before walking back toward you, wrapping her arms tightly around you.\u00a0\u201cOnce he realises, he\u2019ll feel stupid not realising the best thing has been there all along.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d You mutter before heading upstairs, seeing several messages from Tony Stark about Peter\u2019s suit, all of which are rather irritated responses.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Peeping your head out to ensure no one else was upstairs, you place your coffee down before calling Tony.\u00a0\u201cAbout time and all young lady.\u201d Tony huffs down the line as you sit down by your desk, smiling at a photo of you, Peter and Ned at last years summer fair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Tony, Peter wasn\u2019t exactly willing to listen to the idea. I gave it my best shot.\u201d You tell him, but you know it\u2019s not enough to just tell someone an idea, especially when that idea is Tony Starks.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, kid. I\u2019ll take the suit back tomorrow, do you think you\u2019ll be able to keep him distracted?\u201d Tony asks and you smile to yourself, knowing how easy of a task that can be.<br/></p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you down.\u201d You tell him as he hangs up, leaving you to contemplate what would be the best way to keep Peter preoccupied for a day.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Honestly, Tony couldn\u2019t have asked a better person.\u00a0</p><p>*</p><p>Three hours into your study session you were losing your mind, and Peter could tell. Your eyes were scanning over the same page in the hope the information will go in, but nothing will. To you, it\u2019s just a series of words on the page meaning nothing.\u00a0</p><p>Groaning loudly you roll over on Peter\u2019s bed, placing the book over your face.\u00a0\u201cI give up, Chemistry will be the one class I fail and I think I can accept that.\u201d You dramatically sigh as Peter chuckles, leaning over to lift the book from your face.\u00a0</p><p>As he lifts it up, you glance up not expecting him to be so close to you. Your eyes hover on his before he moves away, allowing you to sit back upright.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad, Y/N/N.\u201d He nudges your arm, always smiling at your nickname he devised for you when you were kids.\u00a0\u201cLook, if I\u2019m stuck not being Spiderman, you\u2019ve got to learn chemistry.\u201d He sighs before holding his hand out in front of you.\u00a0\u201cDeal?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Raising an eyebrow you accept the handshake.\u00a0\u201cDeal, I guess.\u201d You shrug your shoulder as you pick the chemistry book back up.\u00a0\u201cYou better help me become the smartest person in the class Parker.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you the second smartest, how\u2019s that?\u201d He retorts, flashing a smile to you before focusing back on his own work.\u00a0<br/></p><p>After a few hours of studying, you were struggling to keep your eyes open.\u00a0\u201cGetting sleepy over there?\u201d Peter pipes up, smiling to you as you lift your head up, weakly nodding in response.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t sleep much last night.\u201d You admit as you rub your eyes.\u00a0\u201cNeighbours played music til 4am again so I\u2019m still half asleep.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>You return to reading the textbook as your eyes continue to grow heavy. Faintly, you can hear the sound of movement coming from Peter as you turn around from the floor, seeing him pulling his bedding back and the textbooks on the floor.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d He motions for you to join him and you can feel heat spreading through your body.\u00a0\u201cyou need to get some rest, I\u2019ll stick a movie on. Like old times.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Hesitantly, you rise to your feet as you climb under the covers and curl into Peter. He instinctively brings you closer, wrapping his arm around you so you can rest your head on his chest as he plays the movie. It is barely five minutes in and you\u2019re unable to focus on it any longer.\u00a0\u201cThank you Peter.\u201d You mumble to him as you allow yourself to fully drift off, feeling Peter drawing shapes into your arm.\u00a0</p><p>*</p><p>Walking down the corridor, MJ continues to talk about the latest election and the drawbacks it has. Usually, you\u2019re able to listen and provide some form of a comment, but as you look ahead you watch as Peter stands by Liz.\u00a0</p><p>It isn\u2019t something uncommon. Peter always talks to Ned or MJ, but this is clearly different. MJ follows your line of focus and sighs to herself.\u00a0\u201cI guess Peter\u2019s got himself a crush.\u201d She sings to you, rolling her eyes and waiting for you to react, but you remain silent.</p><p>You watch as Peter nervously plays with the hem of his hoodie, how he is trying to stand taller and is evidently stuttering as he focuses on her. Of course, he likes Liz, she\u2019s beautiful and smart. You\u2019ll always be his best friend, that\u2019s all you\u2019ll be to him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you in class I just need the the restroom.\u201d You mutter before turning around and running to the bathroom where you keep your head low as you rush into a cubicle, locking it as you sit down and let the tears fall.\u00a0<br/></p><p>It\u2019s not Peter\u2019s fault for liking someone else. It\u2019s your own stupid fault for not saying anything. Your Mom always said teenage boys are oblivious, but they always notice the other girls, the ones who aren\u2019t with them 24/7 or see them in their PJs or after a battle with the Avengers.\u00a0</p><p>Sighing to yourself you take a deep breath, wipe your eyes and head to class. Chemistry class.\u00a0</p><p>As you walk in, you mutter an apology to your teacher before sitting beside MJ. Peter noticed something was wrong as soon as you didn\u2019t walk through with everyone else. You never miss class, especially one you\u2019re struggling in.\u00a0</p><p>Peter turns to Ned who simply shrugs his shoulders. You\u2019re situated at the back of the lab with MJ whilst Peter sits alongside Ned and behind Liz. He smiles to himself as Liz glances over her shoulder, smiling to Peter shyly before averting her attention back to the class.\u00a0</p><p>Ned glances down to his lap, seeing a message appear on his phone from MJ. He sighs silently before placing his phone back in his pocket as he looks to Peter who remains in a world of his own, completely unaware of the reason why you were upset.\u00a0</p><p>The bell rings and the class is over. You quickly gather your things before anyone, and by anyone you mean Peter can stop you. You rush through the halls straight to the library for study hall, a chance to hide away and shut down for an hour or two.\u00a0</p><p>As Peter leaves the classroom, his eyes scan through the students hoping you were one of them. But, much to his dismay, you\u2019re gone.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Y/n?\u201d Peter asks Ned who remains quiet, shrugging his shoulders.\u00a0\u201cNed?\u201d Peter asks once more, and Ned lets out a heavy sigh.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSince when have you liked Liz?\u201d Ned questions and watches as heat rises to Peter\u2019s cheeks as they wander down the corridor toward the library.\u00a0\u201cI know, she\u2019s really pretty but you didn\u2019t tell me you liked her.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Peter pulls the strap on his backpack uncomfortably.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not sure, she\u2019s really nice to me and smart. We, we have a lot in common I guess.\u201d Peter says uncertainly, and MJ walks alongside them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re breaking Y/n\u2019s heart, you know that, Parker?\u201d She coldly comments before picking up her pace, walking out of sight before Peter can question what she just told him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Ned averts his gaze as they walk into the library.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019d she mean I\u2019m,\u201d Before Peter can finish his sentence he is shushed by the librarian.\u00a0\u201csorry Ms Pells.\u201d He whispers as he follows Ned up the stairs and into the room out the back.\u00a0</p><p>Curled up in the corner of the back room, you allow yourself to hide away behind the bookshelves. A small sofa is situated that only a few know of, it\u2019s your small spot to fully shut yourself out from school and in this case, from Peter.\u00a0</p><p>Your ears perk up as the door opens and closes.\u00a0\u201cWell? What did I do wrong?\u201d Silently you swear to yourself as you recognise that voice having heard it for every single day for years.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou really have no clue, do you?\u201d Ned chuckles softly as you sink further into the sofa, wishing the ground would swallow you whole or that there was an emergency escape from the room.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Peter holds his arms up in defeat.\u00a0\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe fact that Y/n likes you, Peter?\u201d Ned states and Peter chuckles a sound that slowly cracks your heart.<br/></p><p>\u201cOf course she likes me, she\u2019s my best friend.\u201d Peter laughs it off, but as Ned continues to stare at him, his laughter dies down.\u00a0\u201cOh.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Ned replies as Peter moves to sit down.</p><p>\u201cHow, how did I not notice?\u201d He stutters.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Ned shrugs his shoulders.\u00a0\u201cWe all can see it, Peter. Y/n really cares about you, but do you feel the same?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The question hangs heavy in the air as tears well up in your eyes. It was a question you\u2019ve wanted to hear the answer to for months but you\u2019ve been too afraid to ask it. Yet, here it is. The one time you shouldn\u2019t hear it, you\u2019re given no choice.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d Peter says with confusion in his voice.\u00a0\u201cI mean, yeah, yeah.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s stopping you?\u201d MJ\u2019s voice interrupts and Peter stutters.\u00a0\u201cYou know this part of the library has hidden spots right?\u201d You listen as her voice becomes closer.\u00a0\u201cSuch as the back corner behind the election files from 1982 to 1987?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Peter looks dumbfounded as he rises to his feet, following MJ as he turns the corner to see you curled up.\u00a0\u201cH,hi.\u201d You whisper, afraid to meet Peter\u2019s gaze.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll leave you two.\u201d MJ states as she takes a hold of Ned, dragging him away and closes the door behind them.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Shuffling on the spot it suddenly feels like neither of you knows your boundaries. It\u2019s like being in the first grade when you\u2019re unsure of who to talk to, who could become a friend for life or just for the first few days.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI, I don\u2019t bite.\u201d You mutter and watch a small smile form on Peter\u2019s face as he sits down opposite you, leaning forward.\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hear all that, we can, we can forget about it if it\u2019s awkward.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna forget it, Y/n.\u201d Peter responds and you lift your head up, seeing his eyes focused on you.\u00a0\u201cWhy would I want to forget it?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s stupid and you don\u2019t like me like that, as I\u2019m your best friend.\u201d You force a laugh that cracks as tears threaten to spill.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Peter slides off of the sofa, kneeling in front of you as he takes your hands in his.\u00a0\u201cHey, it\u2019s me, okay?\u201d Peter strokes your hands with his thumbs.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re my best friend, and you always will be, but I\u2019ve always wondered what if we went to being in a relationship.\u201d He smiles softly, having thought about it for hours at night when you would leave his apartment or he\u2019d walk home from yours.\u00a0\u201cCan&rsquo;t imagine it being that different.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You smile as you sniff lightly.\u00a0\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you want to give this a go?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Peter retorts and you nod repeatedly.\u00a0\u201cWell then,\u201d He mutters as he rises to his feet, holding his hand out to you.\u00a0\u201cY/N/N, will you be my girlfriend?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Placing his hands on your waist, you lift your hands up around his neck.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d love to Spidey.\u201d You mumble before leaning closer and kissing Peter for the first time, the first of many to come.\u00a0</p>",

I think you need to talk to Tony about it.\u201d You reply before holding the door open, but Peter remains still.\u00a0\u201cYou coming in? I\u2019m sure Mom will make some of your favourite pizza?\u201d You beam, but Peter lowers his head shaking it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, but tell your Mom I said hi. I, I\u2019ll see you at school tomorrow.\u201d Peter speaks softly, trying to disguise the disappointment in his tone as he walks away from your house and turns left, disappearing out of sight.<br></p><p>You shut your front door, leaning against it as your Mom appears from the kitchen.\u00a0\u201cOh sweetie, I know it\u2019s hard,\u201d She softly tells you as she leads you into the kitchen, presenting you with a cup of coffee.\u00a0\u201cbeing best friends with the guy you like? Nightmare.\u201d She chuckles as I sip the coffee.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo how do I get out of it being a nightmare?\u201d You question as she switches the oven on before turning back to face you.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSpend quality time together. I know you and Peter are as thick as thieves. It\u2019s just boys, especially teenage boys are oblivious to what\u2019s in front of them.\u201d She explains before walking back toward you, wrapping her arms tightly around you.\u00a0\u201cOnce he realises, he\u2019ll feel stupid not realising the best thing has been there all along.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d You mutter before heading upstairs, seeing several messages from Tony Stark about Peter\u2019s suit, all of which are rather irritated responses.\u00a0<br></p><p>Peeping your head out to ensure no one else was upstairs, you place your coffee down before calling Tony.\u00a0\u201cAbout time and all young lady.\u201d Tony huffs down the line as you sit down by your desk, smiling at a photo of you, Peter and Ned at last years summer fair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Tony, Peter wasn\u2019t exactly willing to listen to the idea. I gave it my best shot.\u201d You tell him, but you know it\u2019s not enough to just tell someone an idea, especially when that idea is Tony Starks.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, kid. I\u2019ll take the suit back tomorrow, do you think you\u2019ll be able to keep him distracted?\u201d Tony asks and you smile to yourself, knowing how easy of a task that can be.<br></p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you down.\u201d You tell him as he hangs up, leaving you to contemplate what would be the best way to keep Peter preoccupied for a day.\u00a0<br></p><p>Honestly, Tony couldn\u2019t have asked a better person.\u00a0</p><p>*</p><p>Three hours into your study session you were losing your mind, and Peter could tell. Your eyes were scanning over the same page in the hope the information will go in, but nothing will. To you, it\u2019s just a series of words on the page meaning nothing.\u00a0</p><p>Groaning loudly you roll over on Peter\u2019s bed, placing the book over your face.\u00a0\u201cI give up, Chemistry will be the one class I fail and I think I can accept that.\u201d You dramatically sigh as Peter chuckles, leaning over to lift the book from your face.\u00a0</p><p>As he lifts it up, you glance up not expecting him to be so close to you. Your eyes hover on his before he moves away, allowing you to sit back upright.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad, Y/N/N.\u201d He nudges your arm, always smiling at your nickname he devised for you when you were kids.\u00a0\u201cLook, if I\u2019m stuck not being Spiderman, you\u2019ve got to learn chemistry.\u201d He sighs before holding his hand out in front of you.\u00a0\u201cDeal?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Raising an eyebrow you accept the handshake.\u00a0\u201cDeal, I guess.\u201d You shrug your shoulder as you pick the chemistry book back up.\u00a0\u201cYou better help me become the smartest person in the class Parker.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you the second smartest, how\u2019s that?\u201d He retorts, flashing a smile to you before focusing back on his own work.\u00a0<br></p><p>After a few hours of studying, you were struggling to keep your eyes open.\u00a0\u201cGetting sleepy over there?\u201d Peter pipes up, smiling to you as you lift your head up, weakly nodding in response.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t sleep much last night.\u201d You admit as you rub your eyes.\u00a0\u201cNeighbours played music til 4am again so I\u2019m still half asleep.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You return to reading the textbook as your eyes continue to grow heavy. Faintly, you can hear the sound of movement coming from Peter as you turn around from the floor, seeing him pulling his bedding back and the textbooks on the floor.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d He motions for you to join him and you can feel heat spreading through your body.\u00a0\u201cyou need to get some rest, I\u2019ll stick a movie on. Like old times.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Hesitantly, you rise to your feet as you climb under the covers and curl into Peter. He instinctively brings you closer, wrapping his arm around you so you can rest your head on his chest as he plays the movie. It is barely five minutes in and you\u2019re unable to focus on it any longer.\u00a0\u201cThank you Peter.\u201d You mumble to him as you allow yourself to fully drift off, feeling Peter drawing shapes into your arm.\u00a0</p><p>*</p><p>Walking down the corridor, MJ continues to talk about the latest election and the drawbacks it has. Usually, you\u2019re able to listen and provide some form of a comment, but as you look ahead you watch as Peter stands by Liz.\u00a0</p><p>It isn\u2019t something uncommon. Peter always talks to Ned or MJ, but this is clearly different. MJ follows your line of focus and sighs to herself.\u00a0\u201cI guess Peter\u2019s got himself a crush.\u201d She sings to you, rolling her eyes and waiting for you to react, but you remain silent.</p><p>You watch as Peter nervously plays with the hem of his hoodie, how he is trying to stand taller and is evidently stuttering as he focuses on her. Of course, he likes Liz, she\u2019s beautiful and smart. You\u2019ll always be his best friend, that\u2019s all you\u2019ll be to him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you in class I just need the the restroom.\u201d You mutter before turning around and running to the bathroom where you keep your head low as you rush into a cubicle, locking it as you sit down and let the tears fall.\u00a0<br></p><p>It\u2019s not Peter\u2019s fault for liking someone else. It\u2019s your own stupid fault for not saying anything. Your Mom always said teenage boys are oblivious, but they always notice the other girls, the ones who aren\u2019t with them 24/7 or see them in their PJs or after a battle with the Avengers.\u00a0</p><p>Sighing to yourself you take a deep breath, wipe your eyes and head to class. Chemistry class.\u00a0</p><p>As you walk in, you mutter an apology to your teacher before sitting beside MJ. Peter noticed something was wrong as soon as you didn\u2019t walk through with everyone else. You never miss class, especially one you\u2019re struggling in.\u00a0</p><p>Peter turns to Ned who simply shrugs his shoulders. You\u2019re situated at the back of the lab with MJ whilst Peter sits alongside Ned and behind Liz. He smiles to himself as Liz glances over her shoulder, smiling to Peter shyly before averting her attention back to the class.\u00a0</p><p>Ned glances down to his lap, seeing a message appear on his phone from MJ. He sighs silently before placing his phone back in his pocket as he looks to Peter who remains in a world of his own, completely unaware of the reason why you were upset.\u00a0</p><p>The bell rings and the class is over. You quickly gather your things before anyone, and by anyone you mean Peter can stop you. You rush through the halls straight to the library for study hall, a chance to hide away and shut down for an hour or two.\u00a0</p><p>As Peter leaves the classroom, his eyes scan through the students hoping you were one of them. But, much to his dismay, you\u2019re gone.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Y/n?\u201d Peter asks Ned who remains quiet, shrugging his shoulders.\u00a0\u201cNed?\u201d Peter asks once more, and Ned lets out a heavy sigh.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSince when have you liked Liz?\u201d Ned questions and watches as heat rises to Peter\u2019s cheeks as they wander down the corridor toward the library.\u00a0\u201cI know, she\u2019s really pretty but you didn\u2019t tell me you liked her.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Peter pulls the strap on his backpack uncomfortably.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not sure, she\u2019s really nice to me and smart. We, we have a lot in common I guess.\u201d Peter says uncertainly, and MJ walks alongside them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re breaking Y/n\u2019s heart, you know that, Parker?\u201d She coldly comments before picking up her pace, walking out of sight before Peter can question what she just told him.\u00a0<br></p><p>Ned averts his gaze as they walk into the library.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019d she mean I\u2019m,\u201d Before Peter can finish his sentence he is shushed by the librarian.\u00a0\u201csorry Ms Pells.\u201d He whispers as he follows Ned up the stairs and into the room out the back.\u00a0</p><p>Curled up in the corner of the back room, you allow yourself to hide away behind the bookshelves. A small sofa is situated that only a few know of, it\u2019s your small spot to fully shut yourself out from school and in this case, from Peter.\u00a0</p><p>Your ears perk up as the door opens and closes.\u00a0\u201cWell? What did I do wrong?\u201d Silently you swear to yourself as you recognise that voice having heard it for every single day for years.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou really have no clue, do you?\u201d Ned chuckles softly as you sink further into the sofa, wishing the ground would swallow you whole or that there was an emergency escape from the room.\u00a0<br></p><p>Peter holds his arms up in defeat.\u00a0\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe fact that Y/n likes you, Peter?\u201d Ned states and Peter chuckles a sound that slowly cracks your heart.<br></p><p>\u201cOf course she likes me, she\u2019s my best friend.\u201d Peter laughs it off, but as Ned continues to stare at him, his laughter dies down.\u00a0\u201cOh.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Ned replies as Peter moves to sit down.</p><p>\u201cHow, how did I not notice?\u201d He stutters.\u00a0<br></p><p>Ned shrugs his shoulders.\u00a0\u201cWe all can see it, Peter. Y/n really cares about you, but do you feel the same?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The question hangs heavy in the air as tears well up in your eyes. It was a question you\u2019ve wanted to hear the answer to for months but you\u2019ve been too afraid to ask it. Yet, here it is. The one time you shouldn\u2019t hear it, you\u2019re given no choice.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d Peter says with confusion in his voice.\u00a0\u201cI mean, yeah, yeah.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s stopping you?\u201d MJ\u2019s voice interrupts and Peter stutters.\u00a0\u201cYou know this part of the library has hidden spots right?\u201d You listen as her voice becomes closer.\u00a0\u201cSuch as the back corner behind the election files from 1982 to 1987?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Peter looks dumbfounded as he rises to his feet, following MJ as he turns the corner to see you curled up.\u00a0\u201cH,hi.\u201d You whisper, afraid to meet Peter\u2019s gaze.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll leave you two.\u201d MJ states as she takes a hold of Ned, dragging him away and closes the door behind them.\u00a0<br></p><p>Shuffling on the spot it suddenly feels like neither of you knows your boundaries. It\u2019s like being in the first grade when you\u2019re unsure of who to talk to, who could become a friend for life or just for the first few days.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI, I don\u2019t bite.\u201d You mutter and watch a small smile form on Peter\u2019s face as he sits down opposite you, leaning forward.\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hear all that, we can, we can forget about it if it\u2019s awkward.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna forget it, Y/n.\u201d Peter responds and you lift your head up, seeing his eyes focused on you.\u00a0\u201cWhy would I want to forget it?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s stupid and you don\u2019t like me like that, as I\u2019m your best friend.\u201d You force a laugh that cracks as tears threaten to spill.\u00a0<br></p><p>Peter slides off of the sofa, kneeling in front of you as he takes your hands in his.\u00a0\u201cHey, it\u2019s me, okay?\u201d Peter strokes your hands with his thumbs.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re my best friend, and you always will be, but I\u2019ve always wondered what if we went to being in a relationship.\u201d He smiles softly, having thought about it for hours at night when you would leave his apartment or he\u2019d walk home from yours.\u00a0\u201cCan\u2019t imagine it being that different.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You smile as you sniff lightly.\u00a0\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you want to give this a go?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Peter retorts and you nod repeatedly.\u00a0\u201cWell then,\u201d He mutters as he rises to his feet, holding his hand out to you.\u00a0\u201cY/N/N, will you be my girlfriend?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Placing his hands on your waist, you lift your hands up around his neck.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d love to Spidey.\u201d You mumble before leaning closer and kissing Peter for the first time, the first of many to come.\u00a0</p>",

His hands rest on your arms as he gives you a look of confusion.\u00a0\u201cSince when are you on a first name basis with Mr, Mr Stark?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You shrug your shoulder as you step forward, forcing Peter from your path so you can continue walking.\u00a0\u201cSince he called me to talk about you, and about your suit.\u201d You mutter the last part, but with his spidey senses, nothing is missed with Peter. Well, almost nothing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat about my suit?\u201d His tone becomes sterner as Peter keeps his eyes on you, watching as you nervously lick your lips and keep your gaze fixated on the ground.\u00a0\u201cY/n,\u201d Peter drags your name out, knowing you\u2019ll tell him if he annoys it out of you.\u00a0<br></p><p>A short sigh escapes your lips as you reach your front door. As you walk up the steps and place your books down you turn back to face Peter.\u00a0\u201cTony thinks he should take your suit away for a while.\u201d You try and break the news gently to him, but his mouth hangs open in shock as his eyes widen.\u00a0</p><p>Waving your hand in front of his face, he snaps out of it and you sit down on your front step, waiting for the rambles to commence.\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cWwwhat Mr Stark can\u2019t take my suit, I love my suit and don\u2019t get me wrong the tech in it is amazing but there are alterations I\u2019d make but I don\u2019t want him to take it I mean why does he need to take it?\u201d As he finishes he blankly stares at you, waiting for a response as you stutter.\u00a0</p><p>Rising to your feet, you unlock your front door and pick up your textbooks.\u00a0\u201cHonestly Peter? I think you need to talk to Tony about it.\u201d You reply before holding the door open, but Peter remains still.\u00a0\u201cYou coming in? I\u2019m sure Mom will make some of your favourite pizza?\u201d You beam, but Peter lowers his head shaking it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, but tell your Mom I said hi. I, I\u2019ll see you at school tomorrow.\u201d Peter speaks softly, trying to disguise the disappointment in his tone as he walks away from your house and turns left, disappearing out of sight.<br></p><p>You shut your front door, leaning against it as your Mom appears from the kitchen.\u00a0\u201cOh sweetie, I know it\u2019s hard,\u201d She softly tells you as she leads you into the kitchen, presenting you with a cup of coffee.\u00a0\u201cbeing best friends with the guy you like? Nightmare.\u201d She chuckles as I sip the coffee.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo how do I get out of it being a nightmare?\u201d You question as she switches the oven on before turning back to face you.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSpend quality time together. I know you and Peter are as thick as thieves. It\u2019s just boys, especially teenage boys are oblivious to what\u2019s in front of them.\u201d She explains before walking back toward you, wrapping her arms tightly around you.\u00a0\u201cOnce he realises, he\u2019ll feel stupid not realising the best thing has been there all along.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d You mutter before heading upstairs, seeing several messages from Tony Stark about Peter\u2019s suit, all of which are rather irritated responses.\u00a0<br></p><p>Peeping your head out to ensure no one else was upstairs, you place your coffee down before calling Tony.\u00a0\u201cAbout time and all young lady.\u201d Tony huffs down the line as you sit down by your desk, smiling at a photo of you, Peter and Ned at last years summer fair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Tony, Peter wasn\u2019t exactly willing to listen to the idea. I gave it my best shot.\u201d You tell him, but you know it\u2019s not enough to just tell someone an idea, especially when that idea is Tony Starks.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, kid. I\u2019ll take the suit back tomorrow, do you think you\u2019ll be able to keep him distracted?\u201d Tony asks and you smile to yourself, knowing how easy of a task that can be.<br></p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you down.\u201d You tell him as he hangs up, leaving you to contemplate what would be the best way to keep Peter preoccupied for a day.\u00a0<br></p><p>Honestly, Tony couldn\u2019t have asked a better person.\u00a0</p><p>*</p><p>Three hours into your study session you were losing your mind, and Peter could tell. Your eyes were scanning over the same page in the hope the information will go in, but nothing will. To you, it\u2019s just a series of words on the page meaning nothing.\u00a0</p><p>Groaning loudly you roll over on Peter\u2019s bed, placing the book over your face.\u00a0\u201cI give up, Chemistry will be the one class I fail and I think I can accept that.\u201d You dramatically sigh as Peter chuckles, leaning over to lift the book from your face.\u00a0</p><p>As he lifts it up, you glance up not expecting him to be so close to you. Your eyes hover on his before he moves away, allowing you to sit back upright.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad, Y/N/N.\u201d He nudges your arm, always smiling at your nickname he devised for you when you were kids.\u00a0\u201cLook, if I\u2019m stuck not being Spiderman, you\u2019ve got to learn chemistry.\u201d He sighs before holding his hand out in front of you.\u00a0\u201cDeal?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Raising an eyebrow you accept the handshake.\u00a0\u201cDeal, I guess.\u201d You shrug your shoulder as you pick the chemistry book back up.\u00a0\u201cYou better help me become the smartest person in the class Parker.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you the second smartest, how\u2019s that?\u201d He retorts, flashing a smile to you before focusing back on his own work.\u00a0<br></p><p>After a few hours of studying, you were struggling to keep your eyes open.\u00a0\u201cGetting sleepy over there?\u201d Peter pipes up, smiling to you as you lift your head up, weakly nodding in response.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t sleep much last night.\u201d You admit as you rub your eyes.\u00a0\u201cNeighbours played music til 4am again so I\u2019m still half asleep.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You return to reading the textbook as your eyes continue to grow heavy. Faintly, you can hear the sound of movement coming from Peter as you turn around from the floor, seeing him pulling his bedding back and the textbooks on the floor.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d He motions for you to join him and you can feel heat spreading through your body.\u00a0\u201cyou need to get some rest, I\u2019ll stick a movie on. Like old times.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Hesitantly, you rise to your feet as you climb under the covers and curl into Peter. He instinctively brings you closer, wrapping his arm around you so you can rest your head on his chest as he plays the movie. It is barely five minutes in and you\u2019re unable to focus on it any longer.\u00a0\u201cThank you Peter.\u201d You mumble to him as you allow yourself to fully drift off, feeling Peter drawing shapes into your arm.\u00a0</p><p>*</p><p>Walking down the corridor, MJ continues to talk about the latest election and the drawbacks it has. Usually, you\u2019re able to listen and provide some form of a comment, but as you look ahead you watch as Peter stands by Liz.\u00a0</p><p>It isn\u2019t something uncommon. Peter always talks to Ned or MJ, but this is clearly different. MJ follows your line of focus and sighs to herself.\u00a0\u201cI guess Peter\u2019s got himself a crush.\u201d She sings to you, rolling her eyes and waiting for you to react, but you remain silent.</p><p>You watch as Peter nervously plays with the hem of his hoodie, how he is trying to stand taller and is evidently stuttering as he focuses on her. Of course, he likes Liz, she\u2019s beautiful and smart. You\u2019ll always be his best friend, that\u2019s all you\u2019ll be to him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you in class I just need the the restroom.\u201d You mutter before turning around and running to the bathroom where you keep your head low as you rush into a cubicle, locking it as you sit down and let the tears fall.\u00a0<br></p><p>It\u2019s not Peter\u2019s fault for liking someone else. It\u2019s your own stupid fault for not saying anything. Your Mom always said teenage boys are oblivious, but they always notice the other girls, the ones who aren\u2019t with them 24/7 or see them in their PJs or after a battle with the Avengers.\u00a0</p><p>Sighing to yourself you take a deep breath, wipe your eyes and head to class. Chemistry class.\u00a0</p><p>As you walk in, you mutter an apology to your teacher before sitting beside MJ. Peter noticed something was wrong as soon as you didn\u2019t walk through with everyone else. You never miss class, especially one you\u2019re struggling in.\u00a0</p><p>Peter turns to Ned who simply shrugs his shoulders. You\u2019re situated at the back of the lab with MJ whilst Peter sits alongside Ned and behind Liz. He smiles to himself as Liz glances over her shoulder, smiling to Peter shyly before averting her attention back to the class.\u00a0</p><p>Ned glances down to his lap, seeing a message appear on his phone from MJ. He sighs silently before placing his phone back in his pocket as he looks to Peter who remains in a world of his own, completely unaware of the reason why you were upset.\u00a0</p><p>The bell rings and the class is over. You quickly gather your things before anyone, and by anyone you mean Peter can stop you. You rush through the halls straight to the library for study hall, a chance to hide away and shut down for an hour or two.\u00a0</p><p>As Peter leaves the classroom, his eyes scan through the students hoping you were one of them. But, much to his dismay, you\u2019re gone.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Y/n?\u201d Peter asks Ned who remains quiet, shrugging his shoulders.\u00a0\u201cNed?\u201d Peter asks once more, and Ned lets out a heavy sigh.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSince when have you liked Liz?\u201d Ned questions and watches as heat rises to Peter\u2019s cheeks as they wander down the corridor toward the library.\u00a0\u201cI know, she\u2019s really pretty but you didn\u2019t tell me you liked her.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Peter pulls the strap on his backpack uncomfortably.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not sure, she\u2019s really nice to me and smart. We, we have a lot in common I guess.\u201d Peter says uncertainly, and MJ walks alongside them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re breaking Y/n\u2019s heart, you know that, Parker?\u201d She coldly comments before picking up her pace, walking out of sight before Peter can question what she just told him.\u00a0<br></p><p>Ned averts his gaze as they walk into the library.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019d she mean I\u2019m,\u201d Before Peter can finish his sentence he is shushed by the librarian.\u00a0\u201csorry Ms Pells.\u201d He whispers as he follows Ned up the stairs and into the room out the back.\u00a0</p><p>Curled up in the corner of the back room, you allow yourself to hide away behind the bookshelves. A small sofa is situated that only a few know of, it\u2019s your small spot to fully shut yourself out from school and in this case, from Peter.\u00a0</p><p>Your ears perk up as the door opens and closes.\u00a0\u201cWell? What did I do wrong?\u201d Silently you swear to yourself as you recognise that voice having heard it for every single day for years.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou really have no clue, do you?\u201d Ned chuckles softly as you sink further into the sofa, wishing the ground would swallow you whole or that there was an emergency escape from the room.\u00a0<br></p><p>Peter holds his arms up in defeat.\u00a0\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe fact that Y/n likes you, Peter?\u201d Ned states and Peter chuckles a sound that slowly cracks your heart.<br></p><p>\u201cOf course she likes me, she\u2019s my best friend.\u201d Peter laughs it off, but as Ned continues to stare at him, his laughter dies down.\u00a0\u201cOh.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Ned replies as Peter moves to sit down.</p><p>\u201cHow, how did I not notice?\u201d He stutters.\u00a0<br></p><p>Ned shrugs his shoulders.\u00a0\u201cWe all can see it, Peter. Y/n really cares about you, but do you feel the same?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The question hangs heavy in the air as tears well up in your eyes. It was a question you\u2019ve wanted to hear the answer to for months but you\u2019ve been too afraid to ask it. Yet, here it is. The one time you shouldn\u2019t hear it, you\u2019re given no choice.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d Peter says with confusion in his voice.\u00a0\u201cI mean, yeah, yeah.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s stopping you?\u201d MJ\u2019s voice interrupts and Peter stutters.\u00a0\u201cYou know this part of the library has hidden spots right?\u201d You listen as her voice becomes closer.\u00a0\u201cSuch as the back corner behind the election files from 1982 to 1987?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Peter looks dumbfounded as he rises to his feet, following MJ as he turns the corner to see you curled up.\u00a0\u201cH,hi.\u201d You whisper, afraid to meet Peter\u2019s gaze.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll leave you two.\u201d MJ states as she takes a hold of Ned, dragging him away and closes the door behind them.\u00a0<br></p><p>Shuffling on the spot it suddenly feels like neither of you knows your boundaries. It\u2019s like being in the first grade when you\u2019re unsure of who to talk to, who could become a friend for life or just for the first few days.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI, I don\u2019t bite.\u201d You mutter and watch a small smile form on Peter\u2019s face as he sits down opposite you, leaning forward.\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hear all that, we can, we can forget about it if it\u2019s awkward.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna forget it, Y/n.\u201d Peter responds and you lift your head up, seeing his eyes focused on you.\u00a0\u201cWhy would I want to forget it?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s stupid and you don\u2019t like me like that, as I\u2019m your best friend.\u201d You force a laugh that cracks as tears threaten to spill.\u00a0<br></p><p>Peter slides off of the sofa, kneeling in front of you as he takes your hands in his.\u00a0\u201cHey, it\u2019s me, okay?\u201d Peter strokes your hands with his thumbs.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re my best friend, and you always will be, but I\u2019ve always wondered what if we went to being in a relationship.\u201d He smiles softly, having thought about it for hours at night when you would leave his apartment or he\u2019d walk home from yours.\u00a0\u201cCan\u2019t imagine it being that different.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You smile as you sniff lightly.\u00a0\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you want to give this a go?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Peter retorts and you nod repeatedly.\u00a0\u201cWell then,\u201d He mutters as he rises to his feet, holding his hand out to you.\u00a0\u201cY/N/N, will you be my girlfriend?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Placing his hands on your waist, you lift your hands up around his neck.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d love to Spidey.\u201d You mumble before leaning closer and kissing Peter for the first time, the first of many to come.\u00a0</p>",

His hands rest on your arms as he gives you a look of confusion.&nbsp;&ldquo;Since when are you on a first name basis with Mr, Mr Stark?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You shrug your shoulder as you step forward, forcing Peter from your path so you can continue walking.&nbsp;&ldquo;Since he called me to talk about you, and about your suit.&rdquo; You mutter the last part, but with his spidey senses, nothing is missed with Peter. Well, almost nothing.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What about my suit?&rdquo; His tone becomes sterner as Peter keeps his eyes on you, watching as you nervously lick your lips and keep your gaze fixated on the ground.&nbsp;&ldquo;Y/n,&rdquo; Peter drags your name out, knowing you&rsquo;ll tell him if he annoys it out of you.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>A short sigh escapes your lips as you reach your front door. As you walk up the steps and place your books down you turn back to face Peter.&nbsp;&ldquo;Tony thinks he should take your suit away for a while.&rdquo; You try and break the news gently to him, but his mouth hangs open in shock as his eyes widen.&nbsp;</p><p>Waving your hand in front of his face, he snaps out of it and you sit down on your front step, waiting for the rambles to commence.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Wwwhat Mr Stark can&rsquo;t take my suit, I love my suit and don&rsquo;t get me wrong the tech in it is amazing but there are alterations I&rsquo;d make but I don&rsquo;t want him to take it I mean why does he need to take it?&rdquo; As he finishes he blankly stares at you, waiting for a response as you stutter.&nbsp;</p><p>Rising to your feet, you unlock your front door and pick up your textbooks.&nbsp;&ldquo;Honestly Peter? I think you need to talk to Tony about it.&rdquo; You reply before holding the door open, but Peter remains still.&nbsp;&ldquo;You coming in? I&rsquo;m sure Mom will make some of your favourite pizza?&rdquo; You beam, but Peter lowers his head shaking it.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay, but tell your Mom I said hi. I, I&rsquo;ll see you at school tomorrow.&rdquo; Peter speaks softly, trying to disguise the disappointment in his tone as he walks away from your house and turns left, disappearing out of sight.<br /></p><p>You shut your front door, leaning against it as your Mom appears from the kitchen.&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh sweetie, I know it&rsquo;s hard,&rdquo; She softly tells you as she leads you into the kitchen, presenting you with a cup of coffee.&nbsp;&ldquo;being best friends with the guy you like? Nightmare.&rdquo; She chuckles as I sip the coffee.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So how do I get out of it being a nightmare?&rdquo; You question as she switches the oven on before turning back to face you.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Spend quality time together. I know you and Peter are as thick as thieves. It&rsquo;s just boys, especially teenage boys are oblivious to what&rsquo;s in front of them.&rdquo; She explains before walking back toward you, wrapping her arms tightly around you.&nbsp;&ldquo;Once he realises, he&rsquo;ll feel stupid not realising the best thing has been there all along.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, Mom.&rdquo; You mutter before heading upstairs, seeing several messages from Tony Stark about Peter&rsquo;s suit, all of which are rather irritated responses.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Peeping your head out to ensure no one else was upstairs, you place your coffee down before calling Tony.&nbsp;&ldquo;About time and all young lady.&rdquo; Tony huffs down the line as you sit down by your desk, smiling at a photo of you, Peter and Ned at last years summer fair.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Tony, Peter wasn&rsquo;t exactly willing to listen to the idea. I gave it my best shot.&rdquo; You tell him, but you know it&rsquo;s not enough to just tell someone an idea, especially when that idea is Tony Starks.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, kid. I&rsquo;ll take the suit back tomorrow, do you think you&rsquo;ll be able to keep him distracted?&rdquo; Tony asks and you smile to yourself, knowing how easy of a task that can be.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let you down.&rdquo; You tell him as he hangs up, leaving you to contemplate what would be the best way to keep Peter preoccupied for a day.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Honestly, Tony couldn&rsquo;t have asked a better person.&nbsp;</p><p>*</p><p>Three hours into your study session you were losing your mind, and Peter could tell. Your eyes were scanning over the same page in the hope the information will go in, but nothing will. To you, it&rsquo;s just a series of words on the page meaning nothing.&nbsp;</p><p>Groaning loudly you roll over on Peter&rsquo;s bed, placing the book over your face.&nbsp;&ldquo;I give up, Chemistry will be the one class I fail and I think I can accept that.&rdquo; You dramatically sigh as Peter chuckles, leaning over to lift the book from your face.&nbsp;</p><p>As he lifts it up, you glance up not expecting him to be so close to you. Your eyes hover on his before he moves away, allowing you to sit back upright.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so bad, Y/N/N.&rdquo; He nudges your arm, always smiling at your nickname he devised for you when you were kids.&nbsp;&ldquo;Look, if I&rsquo;m stuck not being Spiderman, you&rsquo;ve got to learn chemistry.&rdquo; He sighs before holding his hand out in front of you.&nbsp;&ldquo;Deal?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Raising an eyebrow you accept the handshake.&nbsp;&ldquo;Deal, I guess.&rdquo; You shrug your shoulder as you pick the chemistry book back up.&nbsp;&ldquo;You better help me become the smartest person in the class Parker.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make you the second smartest, how&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; He retorts, flashing a smile to you before focusing back on his own work.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>After a few hours of studying, you were struggling to keep your eyes open.&nbsp;&ldquo;Getting sleepy over there?&rdquo; Peter pipes up, smiling to you as you lift your head up, weakly nodding in response.</p><p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t sleep much last night.&rdquo; You admit as you rub your eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;Neighbours played music til 4am again so I&rsquo;m still half asleep.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You return to reading the textbook as your eyes continue to grow heavy. Faintly, you can hear the sound of movement coming from Peter as you turn around from the floor, seeing him pulling his bedding back and the textbooks on the floor.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; He motions for you to join him and you can feel heat spreading through your body.&nbsp;&ldquo;you need to get some rest, I&rsquo;ll stick a movie on. Like old times.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Hesitantly, you rise to your feet as you climb under the covers and curl into Peter. He instinctively brings you closer, wrapping his arm around you so you can rest your head on his chest as he plays the movie. It is barely five minutes in and you&rsquo;re unable to focus on it any longer.&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you Peter.&rdquo; You mumble to him as you allow yourself to fully drift off, feeling Peter drawing shapes into your arm.&nbsp;</p><p>*</p><p>Walking down the corridor, MJ continues to talk about the latest election and the drawbacks it has. Usually, you&rsquo;re able to listen and provide some form of a comment, but as you look ahead you watch as Peter stands by Liz.&nbsp;</p><p>It isn&rsquo;t something uncommon. Peter always talks to Ned or MJ, but this is clearly different. MJ follows your line of focus and sighs to herself.&nbsp;&ldquo;I guess Peter&rsquo;s got himself a crush.&rdquo; She sings to you, rolling her eyes and waiting for you to react, but you remain silent.</p><p>You watch as Peter nervously plays with the hem of his hoodie, how he is trying to stand taller and is evidently stuttering as he focuses on her. Of course, he likes Liz, she&rsquo;s beautiful and smart. You&rsquo;ll always be his best friend, that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;ll be to him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you in class I just need the the restroom.&rdquo; You mutter before turning around and running to the bathroom where you keep your head low as you rush into a cubicle, locking it as you sit down and let the tears fall.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>It&rsquo;s not Peter&rsquo;s fault for liking someone else. It&rsquo;s your own stupid fault for not saying anything. Your Mom always said teenage boys are oblivious, but they always notice the other girls, the ones who aren&rsquo;t with them 24/7 or see them in their PJs or after a battle with the Avengers.&nbsp;</p><p>Sighing to yourself you take a deep breath, wipe your eyes and head to class. Chemistry class.&nbsp;</p><p>As you walk in, you mutter an apology to your teacher before sitting beside MJ. Peter noticed something was wrong as soon as you didn&rsquo;t walk through with everyone else. You never miss class, especially one you&rsquo;re struggling in.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter turns to Ned who simply shrugs his shoulders. You&rsquo;re situated at the back of the lab with MJ whilst Peter sits alongside Ned and behind Liz. He smiles to himself as Liz glances over her shoulder, smiling to Peter shyly before averting her attention back to the class.&nbsp;</p><p>Ned glances down to his lap, seeing a message appear on his phone from MJ. He sighs silently before placing his phone back in his pocket as he looks to Peter who remains in a world of his own, completely unaware of the reason why you were upset.&nbsp;</p><p>The bell rings and the class is over. You quickly gather your things before anyone, and by anyone you mean Peter can stop you. You rush through the halls straight to the library for study hall, a chance to hide away and shut down for an hour or two.&nbsp;</p><p>As Peter leaves the classroom, his eyes scan through the students hoping you were one of them. But, much to his dismay, you&rsquo;re gone.&nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with Y/n?&rdquo; Peter asks Ned who remains quiet, shrugging his shoulders.&nbsp;&ldquo;Ned?&rdquo; Peter asks once more, and Ned lets out a heavy sigh.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Since when have you liked Liz?&rdquo; Ned questions and watches as heat rises to Peter&rsquo;s cheeks as they wander down the corridor toward the library.&nbsp;&ldquo;I know, she&rsquo;s really pretty but you didn&rsquo;t tell me you liked her.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Peter pulls the strap on his backpack uncomfortably.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure, she&rsquo;s really nice to me and smart. We, we have a lot in common I guess.&rdquo; Peter says uncertainly, and MJ walks alongside them.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re breaking Y/n&rsquo;s heart, you know that, Parker?&rdquo; She coldly comments before picking up her pace, walking out of sight before Peter can question what she just told him.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Ned averts his gaze as they walk into the library.&nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;d she mean I&rsquo;m,&rdquo; Before Peter can finish his sentence he is shushed by the librarian.&nbsp;&ldquo;sorry Ms Pells.&rdquo; He whispers as he follows Ned up the stairs and into the room out the back.&nbsp;</p><p>Curled up in the corner of the back room, you allow yourself to hide away behind the bookshelves. A small sofa is situated that only a few know of, it&rsquo;s your small spot to fully shut yourself out from school and in this case, from Peter.&nbsp;</p><p>Your ears perk up as the door opens and closes.&nbsp;&ldquo;Well? What did I do wrong?&rdquo; Silently you swear to yourself as you recognise that voice having heard it for every single day for years.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You really have no clue, do you?&rdquo; Ned chuckles softly as you sink further into the sofa, wishing the ground would swallow you whole or that there was an emergency escape from the room.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Peter holds his arms up in defeat.&nbsp;&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The fact that Y/n likes you, Peter?&rdquo; Ned states and Peter chuckles a sound that slowly cracks your heart.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Of course she likes me, she&rsquo;s my best friend.&rdquo; Peter laughs it off, but as Ned continues to stare at him, his laughter dies down.&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Ned replies as Peter moves to sit down.</p><p>&ldquo;How, how did I not notice?&rdquo; He stutters.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Ned shrugs his shoulders.&nbsp;&ldquo;We all can see it, Peter. Y/n really cares about you, but do you feel the same?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>The question hangs heavy in the air as tears well up in your eyes. It was a question you&rsquo;ve wanted to hear the answer to for months but you&rsquo;ve been too afraid to ask it. Yet, here it is. The one time you shouldn&rsquo;t hear it, you&rsquo;re given no choice.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo; Peter says with confusion in his voice.&nbsp;&ldquo;I mean, yeah, yeah.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s stopping you?&rdquo; MJ&rsquo;s voice interrupts and Peter stutters.&nbsp;&ldquo;You know this part of the library has hidden spots right?&rdquo; You listen as her voice becomes closer.&nbsp;&ldquo;Such as the back corner behind the election files from 1982 to 1987?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Peter looks dumbfounded as he rises to his feet, following MJ as he turns the corner to see you curled up.&nbsp;&ldquo;H,hi.&rdquo; You whisper, afraid to meet Peter&rsquo;s gaze.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll leave you two.&rdquo; MJ states as she takes a hold of Ned, dragging him away and closes the door behind them.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Shuffling on the spot it suddenly feels like neither of you knows your boundaries. It&rsquo;s like being in the first grade when you&rsquo;re unsure of who to talk to, who could become a friend for life or just for the first few days.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I, I don&rsquo;t bite.&rdquo; You mutter and watch a small smile form on Peter&rsquo;s face as he sits down opposite you, leaning forward.&nbsp;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to hear all that, we can, we can forget about it if it&rsquo;s awkward.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wanna forget it, Y/n.&rdquo; Peter responds and you lift your head up, seeing his eyes focused on you.&nbsp;&ldquo;Why would I want to forget it?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s stupid and you don&rsquo;t like me like that, as I&rsquo;m your best friend.&rdquo; You force a laugh that cracks as tears threaten to spill.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Peter slides off of the sofa, kneeling in front of you as he takes your hands in his.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s me, okay?&rdquo; Peter strokes your hands with his thumbs.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re my best friend, and you always will be, but I&rsquo;ve always wondered what if we went to being in a relationship.&rdquo; He smiles softly, having thought about it for hours at night when you would leave his apartment or he&rsquo;d walk home from yours.&nbsp;&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t imagine it being that different.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You smile as you sniff lightly.&nbsp;&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re saying you want to give this a go?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; Peter retorts and you nod repeatedly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; He mutters as he rises to his feet, holding his hand out to you.&nbsp;&ldquo;Y/N/N, will you be my girlfriend?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Placing his hands on your waist, you lift your hands up around his neck.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to Spidey.&rdquo; You mumble before leaning closer and kissing Peter for the first time, the first of many to come.&nbsp;</p>",

Peter being the stubborn ass boy he is of course didn&rsquo;t listen, or maybe he couldn&rsquo;t listen because of the fever. </p><p>Then of course  the Parker luck strikes again, the fever gets worse and worse as the day goes by. Peter could barely stand at this point and looked like he just git hit by a train. Once Peter actually got to P.E he&rsquo;s all dizzy and practically drenched in sweat. He stumbles for a bit before accidentally bumping in to Harley.</p><p>Before Peter could even face plat to the ground Harley catches him with both arms looking at him with concerned eyes. He rose an eyebrow at Peter&rsquo;s utterly dying form before gently letting go of his boyfriend. He questions Peter about it only for the other boy to shrug all his questions off. </p><p>Harley doesn&rsquo;t get majorly concerned, he knew Peter could handle himself. After all Peter did dress up as a red spider furry and beat up bad guys all night. Harley didn&rsquo;t think anything of the confrontation until he saw Peter stumble by the benches before dropping out cold and nearly the floor.</p><p>Harley being the oh so good boyfriend he was managed to catch Peter before his head could drop to the ground. In all honesty Harley was VERY scared and concerned. I mean wouldn&rsquo;t you if your boyfriend suddenly dropped out cold like he just died? He quickly pushed those thoughts away at the back of his mind before lifting Peter&rsquo;s body up and sprint to the nurse&rsquo;s office even with the teachers yelling at him to stop running in the halls. </p><p>He sets Peter on the bed and just waits for him to wake up. It was literally torture for Harley but there was nothing else to do besides waiting. So he sat there, resting his face near Peter&rsquo;s sleeping one, and waited for the other boy to wake up. Peter did eventually wake up though only to find a sleeping Harley next to him instead.</p><p>Imagine them staying like that until Peter silently fell asleep again, slowly waking up to find himself in his room at the tower. Harley was in front of him sitting on a chair, holding a bowl of chicken noodle soup. Once Peter opened his mouth to say something Harley shoved a spoon full of soup down his throat before placing the soup on the bed side table and hugged Peter to death. Peter hugged Harley back even though he wasn&rsquo;t fully aware of what happened during the time he was out cold.</p><p>Needless to say Harley forced Peter on bed rest until he was 100% healthy again. He wouldn&rsquo;t have enjoyed seeing Peter pass out cold for the second time that day. Peter didn&rsquo;t really mind though, even as he protested against doing so. Harley would get to feed him all week and honestly? Peter wasn&rsquo;t even going to complain since Harley&rsquo;s chicken noodle soup was the best in New York. He also didn&rsquo;t mind the extra bear hugs he got from Harley either. </p>",

Didn\u2019t know this was an anthology team up title jeez.</p><p>Did it go out with a bang or a whimper? Well&hellip;a bit of\nboth.</p><p>&hellip;And by both I mean there were literal bangs in the issue\nso the whimpers&hellip;you get it&hellip;</p><!-- more --><p>Okay so for starters the cover lies again like in issue #1. The\ncover promises us Peter in Kamala\u2019s body with spider powers and Kamala in Peter\u2019s\nbody with Inhuman powers.</p><p>And in the issue we get&hellip;the same shit from the past 2\nissues, standard Freaky Friday.</p><p>It\u2019s less bad here than in issue #1 though. Issue #1\u2019s lie\nwas actively reductive to the reading experience. Here it\u2019s just artistic\nlicence and really the idea of seeing Spidey with Kamala\u2019s powers and vice\nversa is only good for a strong visual. If Peter in Kamala\u2019s body got the same\npower set it\u2019d seriously undermine the creative legs of the Freaky Friday\ndynamic in the first place. So a quick cover for an eye catching visual is good\nenough.</p><p>Moving on&hellip;this issue is kind of the weakest instalment in\nthis already kind of shakey arc. If you turned your brain off you could kind of\nenjoy issues #1-2 but the creative energy in this issue was waning a lot.</p><p>You can tell this because once the Jackal, the villain of\nthis arc, gets defeated the issue continues for over 11 pages. Over 11 pages of\nrestoring the status quo.</p><p>And when I say restoring the status quo I don\u2019t simply mean\nPeter and Kamala inevitably swap back, I mean they swap back and also forget\neverything that happened, leaving you wondering what the point of any of this\nwas.</p><p>Kamala will go forward in life never knowing the impending\ndread of job interviews or unpaid bills and Peter Parker will never remember\nthe pain and discomfort of a period or the sweet taste of cotton candy lip\ngloss&hellip;okay maybe for both parties forgetting this ever happened isn\u2019t the\nworst idea.</p><p>But the issue could\u2019ve been mitigated if Ewing had just\nrestructured the story a little bit so that the swap lasted way less than two\ndays. In fact even if they forgot what happened wouldn\u2019t it raise big red flags\nthat 2 days have elapsed within which they remember nothing?</p><p>Even putting this aside the story continues the trajectory\nof having a lot of small problems that add up. Some of these don\u2019t break the\nissue per se but the numeracy of them adds up to an over all lack of thought\nand planning put into the story.</p><p>Let\u2019s talk about one example I actually forgot to bring up\nin issue #2. So in the first issue when the Jackal showed up and declared\nRosario\u2019s Polly tech would be useful in his cloning experiments my first\nthought was \u2018how\u2019? But I let it slide because maybe the story would elaborate.</p><p>And in issue #2 it did but having Spidey throw out a theory,\nand in issue #3 we got that theory confirmed.</p><p>The plan goes like this. The Jackal\u2019s wants to use Rosario\u2019s\ntech alongside his cloning tech to create clones with the consciousness of\nanother person.</p><p>When that happened my thoughts Digivolved from \u2018how?\u2019 into \u2018why?\u2019</p><p>Like&hellip;okay, the Jackal has a God complex.</p><p>OBVIOUSLY. </p><p>Even shitty BND era writers picked up on that.</p><p>This would definitely come under the remit of playing God,\nbut even during the nadir of the Clone Saga (we call that Maximum Clonage kids)\nyou could just about see the method in his madness. It wasn\u2019t rationale but it\nadded up within his warped logic. He wanted to destroy life on Earth and\nreplace it with the life HE created.</p><p>Cool.</p><p>Now in this story he wants to&hellip;basically transfer someone\u2019s\nmind into someone else\u2019s body, but not even their actual body a copy of their\nactual body.</p><p>What possible purpose would that serve?</p><p>I could KIND of see it if he wanted to transfer people\u2019s\nminds into clones of their own bodies. Like what happened to Xavier after he\nwas infected with the Brood.</p><p>But into a clone of someone else\u2019s body?</p><p>That\u2019s some Underpants Gnome level planning.</p><p>Not to mention can\u2019t he basically already do that?</p><p>He created the Carrion virus IIRC which genetically\nreprograms the infected subject into basically believing themselves to be Miles\nWarren. He was also able to update Ben Reilly\u2019s memories so they\u2019d match Peter\nParker\u2019s. If you can do that then surely you could already put someone\u2019s consciousness\ninto a body that isn\u2019t theirs? Or at least the scientific leap from one to the\nother isn\u2019t that huge.</p><p>Another rather significant issue with the plot revolves\naround the Isotope Genome Accelerator. Yeah remember that? The thing that separated\nPeter and Spider-Man back in Spencer\u2019s opening arc.</p><p>Remember how it heavily implied to explode in ASM v5 #5 and\nthus merge Peter and Spidey back together? Apparently not. It was either\nundamaged or got rebuilt apparently. Even better it has plot convenience powers\nnow. It\u2019s used to swap Peter and Kamala again.</p><p>So just so we are clear the Isotope Genome Accelerator\u2019s\nscientific applications include:</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIrradiating shit</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIrradiating house spiders to the point where\nbiting people gives them spider powers which may or may not include organic\nwebbing</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nRemoving super powered mutations (see\nSpider-Man: the Final Adventure #4)</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nTemporarily \u2018masking\u2019 super powered mutations\n(see above)</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSeparating people into different sides of\nthemselves (and also maybe creating different clothes for them too?)</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSwapping people\u2019s minds which is somehow an\nextension of the latter application</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nCopies and/or transfers the super powers of one person\nto another (we\u2019ll get back to that)</p><p>Holy shit this thing can do everything short of toast bread!</p><p>Good lord&hellip;the issue tries to explain that it\u2019s ability to separate\npeople into two different entities is how they\u2019re going to affect the swap\nbut&hellip;that doesn\u2019t make a lick of sense even by the already bullshit science in\nplay.</p><p>How is physically separating the thrill seeking adventurer\nfrom the responsible everyman out of the one person (or in theory the man from\nthe cannibalistic lizard monster) remotely similar to swapping the <b><i>minds</i></b>\nof two people?</p><p>What did it separate both minds from both bodies and\nthen&hellip;they just snapped back to where they belonged?*</p><p>This isn\u2019t even mentioning how for what is presumably a gag\nthe Accelerator also apparently gave Rosario Kamala\u2019s powers. How? Why? Does\nthis mean Kamala lost her powers? Does it mean the Accelerator copied her\npowers into Rosario?</p><p>Never explained who fucking knows the Isotope Genome\nAccelerator is the plot device that just keeps on giving.</p><p>There are other lesser contrivances in the issue that are\ncontrivances nevertheless.</p><p>Remember how I said in issue #1 how it\u2019s weird that everyone\nis so concerned about destroying Rosario\u2019s polly device because surely she has\nthe plans to another one? Well this issue confirms she does, she has schematics\nto another device. </p><p>Which raises two big questions.</p><p>a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf the device is going to make all the\ndifference in swapping Peter and Kamala back&hellip;why do they need the\naccelerator? Why the drama and tension over that, they could just build another\ndevice and swap back easy peasey</p><p>b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhy was there any tension over destroying the\ndevice in issue #1 and thus kicking off this whole arc\u2019s premise?</p><p>Another piece of technological contrivance comes from the\nchip Peter off panel implanted in his brain ages ago without telling the\nreaders. So apparently it was useless all along because it\u2019d only work if\nwhoever was trying to mind swap with him also had a chip.**Oh and it\u2019s eroded\naway any how.</p><p>This is a mind bender this one.</p><p>We have a non-Spidey comic by a non-Spidey office\nestablishing Spider-Man did something major that was very smart and very\nobvious provided it was possible (which we were never led to believe it was in\nSpidey stories proper). That same non-Spidey comic upon establishing this plot\ndevice then uses it as a possible explanation for the scenario it\u2019s setting up.\nThen in resolving that scenario reveals the plot device wasn\u2019t working, never\nwas going to work, wasn\u2019t a factor in the first place and thus paints\nSpider-Man as stupid.</p><p>WTF!</p><p>WTF was the point of the anti-body swap chip then?</p><p>You might as well have never had that in the comic and\nthereby not made Spider-Man storytellers look dumb for not considering that or\nmade the character look dumb for not considering it <b><i>enough</i></b>.</p><p>Just lose that plot point altogether and nothing changes. </p><p>Everything else wrong with this issue is less egregious, it\u2019s\nsmaller things that further spell out the lack of attention being paid to the\nstory.</p><p>They range from minor stuff like typos to pretentious\nnarration at the start of the issue.</p><p>Not only pretentious by the way but pointless given how they\nforget what happens and it doesn\u2019t seem to serve the story. It pays lip service\nto us as people accepting our good and bad traits but&hellip;that hasn\u2019t got\nanything to d with this story in the first place. Also after 2 issues of\ntalking out loud NOW thought captions are a thing?</p><p>Let\u2019s see what other shit is wrong with this issue.</p><p>Oh right, Rosario has been tied up and conscious in her\noffice at ESU (on a weekday no less) all night but NOBDOY heard her calling for\nhelp in all that time? Or she didn\u2019t try yelling before Peter and Kamala\nconveniently showed up?</p><p>Not to mention Kamala says her spider sense (which wasn\u2019t\nworking in the last issue for no explained reason) is alerting her to maybe\ngetting the right location for Rosario but&hellip;didn\u2019t they have her office\nlisted? Wasn\u2019t that what they were following? And why would the spider sense\n(from her and Peter\u2019s POV) tingle if there wasn\u2019t any danger the issue implies\nit\u2019s the mere fact they\u2019re zeroing in on Rosario.</p><p>Other smaller problems include Peter complaining that teens\nare so mean as though this is a revelation. Peter&hellip;Parker&hellip;is learning teens\ncan be jerks&hellip;.um&hellip;did Ewing not read Amazing Fantasy #15&hellip;page 1&hellip;? </p><p>Similarly talks about how he\u2019s learned to focus on the\nproblems of the present and not worry about the future. My kneejerk reaction to\nthat is to call BS, Peter clearly does fret over the future.</p><p>Final little complaints Spidey bangs on about his knees not\nhurting when Kamala in his older body never brings them up and seems fine.\nAaaaaand there is a line of dialogue from kamala about how the Jackal doesn\u2019t\nunderstand that humans are more than bodies and stored ideas yadda yadda\nyadda,. But like&hellip;from her point of view the Jackal never said any of that\nshit. I guess maybe she\u2019s right but she shouldn\u2019t know to be right if you see\nwhat I mean.</p><p>I\u2019ll finish off with a little positivity.</p><p>The art was lovely again.</p><p>Spidey owning Jackal with Kamala\u2019s powers was bad ass.</p><p>Spider-Man acting the older mentor figure to Kamala was\nawesome, just wish it wasn\u2019t undermined by him being in her body when he was\ndoing that.</p><p>So all in all&hellip;this arc is very unimpressive.</p><p>You know how online, maybe on tumblr, maybe on CBR, maybe on\nGoogle images or scans daily you see a selection of pages from a comic book\nstory? Basically the highlights?</p><p>Yeah if you were to experience issue #1 and #2 like that\nthat\u2019s how I\u2019d recommend experiencing this story.</p><p>Reading or God forbid buying it is highly NOT recommended.</p><p>*Shit now I think about it the way Roasrio\u2019s device was\nexplained it doesn\u2019t even add up to being able to mind swap. It turns the mind\ninto data and stores it. Okay&hellip;how does that mean we\u2019re swapping the minds of\ntwo meatbag humans with no mechanical storage device or interface involved?</p><p>**Even though again Doc Ock <b><i>DIDN\u2019T</i></b> \u00a0swap minds with Peter he uploaded a copy of\nhis mind into his head and vice versa, Peter\u2019s real mind was still in his body\nthe whole time but buried.</p>",

Didn\u2019t know this was an anthology team up title jeez.</p><p>Did it go out with a bang or a whimper? Well\u2026a bit of\nboth.</p><p>\u2026And by both I mean there were literal bangs in the issue\nso the whimpers\u2026you get it\u2026</p>[[MORE]]<p>Okay so for starters the cover lies again like in issue #1. The\ncover promises us Peter in Kamala\u2019s body with spider powers and Kamala in Peter\u2019s\nbody with Inhuman powers.</p><p>And in the issue we get\u2026the same shit from the past 2\nissues, standard Freaky Friday.</p><p>It\u2019s less bad here than in issue #1 though. Issue #1\u2019s lie\nwas actively reductive to the reading experience. Here it\u2019s just artistic\nlicence and really the idea of seeing Spidey with Kamala\u2019s powers and vice\nversa is only good for a strong visual. If Peter in Kamala\u2019s body got the same\npower set it\u2019d seriously undermine the creative legs of the Freaky Friday\ndynamic in the first place. So a quick cover for an eye catching visual is good\nenough.</p><p>Moving on\u2026this issue is kind of the weakest instalment in\nthis already kind of shakey arc. If you turned your brain off you could kind of\nenjoy issues #1-2 but the creative energy in this issue was waning a lot.</p><p>You can tell this because once the Jackal, the villain of\nthis arc, gets defeated the issue continues for over 11 pages. Over 11 pages of\nrestoring the status quo.</p><p>And when I say restoring the status quo I don\u2019t simply mean\nPeter and Kamala inevitably swap back, I mean they swap back and also forget\neverything that happened, leaving you wondering what the point of any of this\nwas.</p><p>Kamala will go forward in life never knowing the impending\ndread of job interviews or unpaid bills and Peter Parker will never remember\nthe pain and discomfort of a period or the sweet taste of cotton candy lip\ngloss\u2026okay maybe for both parties forgetting this ever happened isn\u2019t the\nworst idea.</p><p>But the issue could\u2019ve been mitigated if Ewing had just\nrestructured the story a little bit so that the swap lasted way less than two\ndays. In fact even if they forgot what happened wouldn\u2019t it raise big red flags\nthat 2 days have elapsed within which they remember nothing?</p><p>Even putting this aside the story continues the trajectory\nof having a lot of small problems that add up. Some of these don\u2019t break the\nissue per se but the numeracy of them adds up to an over all lack of thought\nand planning put into the story.</p><p>Let\u2019s talk about one example I actually forgot to bring up\nin issue #2. So in the first issue when the Jackal showed up and declared\nRosario\u2019s Polly tech would be useful in his cloning experiments my first\nthought was \u2018how\u2019? But I let it slide because maybe the story would elaborate.</p><p>And in issue #2 it did but having Spidey throw out a theory,\nand in issue #3 we got that theory confirmed.</p><p>The plan goes like this. The Jackal\u2019s wants to use Rosario\u2019s\ntech alongside his cloning tech to create clones with the consciousness of\nanother person.</p><p>When that happened my thoughts Digivolved from \u2018how?\u2019 into \u2018why?\u2019</p><p>Like\u2026okay, the Jackal has a God complex.</p><p>OBVIOUSLY. </p><p>Even shitty BND era writers picked up on that.</p><p>This would definitely come under the remit of playing God,\nbut even during the nadir of the Clone Saga (we call that Maximum Clonage kids)\nyou could just about see the method in his madness. It wasn\u2019t rationale but it\nadded up within his warped logic. He wanted to destroy life on Earth and\nreplace it with the life HE created.</p><p>Cool.</p><p>Now in this story he wants to\u2026basically transfer someone\u2019s\nmind into someone else\u2019s body, but not even their actual body a copy of their\nactual body.</p><p>What possible purpose would that serve?</p><p>I could KIND of see it if he wanted to transfer people\u2019s\nminds into clones of their own bodies. Like what happened to Xavier after he\nwas infected with the Brood.</p><p>But into a clone of someone else\u2019s body?</p><p>That\u2019s some Underpants Gnome level planning.</p><p>Not to mention can\u2019t he basically already do that?</p><p>He created the Carrion virus IIRC which genetically\nreprograms the infected subject into basically believing themselves to be Miles\nWarren. He was also able to update Ben Reilly\u2019s memories so they\u2019d match Peter\nParker\u2019s. If you can do that then surely you could already put someone\u2019s consciousness\ninto a body that isn\u2019t theirs? Or at least the scientific leap from one to the\nother isn\u2019t that huge.</p><p>Another rather significant issue with the plot revolves\naround the Isotope Genome Accelerator. Yeah remember that? The thing that separated\nPeter and Spider-Man back in Spencer\u2019s opening arc.</p><p>Remember how it heavily implied to explode in ASM v5 #5 and\nthus merge Peter and Spidey back together? Apparently not. It was either\nundamaged or got rebuilt apparently. Even better it has plot convenience powers\nnow. It\u2019s used to swap Peter and Kamala again.</p><p>So just so we are clear the Isotope Genome Accelerator\u2019s\nscientific applications include:</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIrradiating shit</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIrradiating house spiders to the point where\nbiting people gives them spider powers which may or may not include organic\nwebbing</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nRemoving super powered mutations (see\nSpider-Man: the Final Adventure #4)</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nTemporarily \u2018masking\u2019 super powered mutations\n(see above)</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSeparating people into different sides of\nthemselves (and also maybe creating different clothes for them too?)</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSwapping people\u2019s minds which is somehow an\nextension of the latter application</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nCopies and/or transfers the super powers of one person\nto another (we\u2019ll get back to that)</p><p>Holy shit this thing can do everything short of toast bread!</p><p>Good lord\u2026the issue tries to explain that it\u2019s ability to separate\npeople into two different entities is how they\u2019re going to affect the swap\nbut\u2026that doesn\u2019t make a lick of sense even by the already bullshit science in\nplay.</p><p>How is physically separating the thrill seeking adventurer\nfrom the responsible everyman out of the one person (or in theory the man from\nthe cannibalistic lizard monster) remotely similar to swapping the <b><i>minds</i></b>\nof two people?</p><p>What did it separate both minds from both bodies and\nthen\u2026they just snapped back to where they belonged?*</p><p>This isn\u2019t even mentioning how for what is presumably a gag\nthe Accelerator also apparently gave Rosario Kamala\u2019s powers. How? Why? Does\nthis mean Kamala lost her powers? Does it mean the Accelerator copied her\npowers into Rosario?</p><p>Never explained who fucking knows the Isotope Genome\nAccelerator is the plot device that just keeps on giving.</p><p>There are other lesser contrivances in the issue that are\ncontrivances nevertheless.</p><p>Remember how I said in issue #1 how it\u2019s weird that everyone\nis so concerned about destroying Rosario\u2019s polly device because surely she has\nthe plans to another one? Well this issue confirms she does, she has schematics\nto another device. </p><p>Which raises two big questions.</p><p>a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf the device is going to make all the\ndifference in swapping Peter and Kamala back\u2026why do they need the\naccelerator? Why the drama and tension over that, they could just build another\ndevice and swap back easy peasey</p><p>b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhy was there any tension over destroying the\ndevice in issue #1 and thus kicking off this whole arc\u2019s premise?</p><p>Another piece of technological contrivance comes from the\nchip Peter off panel implanted in his brain ages ago without telling the\nreaders. So apparently it was useless all along because it\u2019d only work if\nwhoever was trying to mind swap with him also had a chip.**Oh and it\u2019s eroded\naway any how.</p><p>This is a mind bender this one.</p><p>We have a non-Spidey comic by a non-Spidey office\nestablishing Spider-Man did something major that was very smart and very\nobvious provided it was possible (which we were never led to believe it was in\nSpidey stories proper). That same non-Spidey comic upon establishing this plot\ndevice then uses it as a possible explanation for the scenario it\u2019s setting up.\nThen in resolving that scenario reveals the plot device wasn\u2019t working, never\nwas going to work, wasn\u2019t a factor in the first place and thus paints\nSpider-Man as stupid.</p><p>WTF!</p><p>WTF was the point of the anti-body swap chip then?</p><p>You might as well have never had that in the comic and\nthereby not made Spider-Man storytellers look dumb for not considering that or\nmade the character look dumb for not considering it <b><i>enough</i></b>.</p><p>Just lose that plot point altogether and nothing changes. </p><p>Everything else wrong with this issue is less egregious, it\u2019s\nsmaller things that further spell out the lack of attention being paid to the\nstory.</p><p>They range from minor stuff like typos to pretentious\nnarration at the start of the issue.</p><p>Not only pretentious by the way but pointless given how they\nforget what happens and it doesn\u2019t seem to serve the story. It pays lip service\nto us as people accepting our good and bad traits but\u2026that hasn\u2019t got\nanything to d with this story in the first place. Also after 2 issues of\ntalking out loud NOW thought captions are a thing?</p><p>Let\u2019s see what other shit is wrong with this issue.</p><p>Oh right, Rosario has been tied up and conscious in her\noffice at ESU (on a weekday no less) all night but NOBDOY heard her calling for\nhelp in all that time? Or she didn\u2019t try yelling before Peter and Kamala\nconveniently showed up?</p><p>Not to mention Kamala says her spider sense (which wasn\u2019t\nworking in the last issue for no explained reason) is alerting her to maybe\ngetting the right location for Rosario but\u2026didn\u2019t they have her office\nlisted? Wasn\u2019t that what they were following? And why would the spider sense\n(from her and Peter\u2019s POV) tingle if there wasn\u2019t any danger the issue implies\nit\u2019s the mere fact they\u2019re zeroing in on Rosario.</p><p>Other smaller problems include Peter complaining that teens\nare so mean as though this is a revelation. Peter\u2026Parker\u2026is learning teens\ncan be jerks\u2026.um\u2026did Ewing not read Amazing Fantasy #15\u2026page 1\u2026? </p><p>Similarly talks about how he\u2019s learned to focus on the\nproblems of the present and not worry about the future. My kneejerk reaction to\nthat is to call BS, Peter clearly does fret over the future.</p><p>Final little complaints Spidey bangs on about his knees not\nhurting when Kamala in his older body never brings them up and seems fine.\nAaaaaand there is a line of dialogue from kamala about how the Jackal doesn\u2019t\nunderstand that humans are more than bodies and stored ideas yadda yadda\nyadda,. But like\u2026from her point of view the Jackal never said any of that\nshit. I guess maybe she\u2019s right but she shouldn\u2019t know to be right if you see\nwhat I mean.</p><p>I\u2019ll finish off with a little positivity.</p><p>The art was lovely again.</p><p>Spidey owning Jackal with Kamala\u2019s powers was bad ass.</p><p>Spider-Man acting the older mentor figure to Kamala was\nawesome, just wish it wasn\u2019t undermined by him being in her body when he was\ndoing that.</p><p>So all in all\u2026this arc is very unimpressive.</p><p>You know how online, maybe on tumblr, maybe on CBR, maybe on\nGoogle images or scans daily you see a selection of pages from a comic book\nstory? Basically the highlights?</p><p>Yeah if you were to experience issue #1 and #2 like that\nthat\u2019s how I\u2019d recommend experiencing this story.</p><p>Reading or God forbid buying it is highly NOT recommended.</p><p>*Shit now I think about it the way Roasrio\u2019s device was\nexplained it doesn\u2019t even add up to being able to mind swap. It turns the mind\ninto data and stores it. Okay\u2026how does that mean we\u2019re swapping the minds of\ntwo meatbag humans with no mechanical storage device or interface involved?</p><p>**Even though again Doc Ock <b><i>DIDN\u2019T</i></b> \u00a0swap minds with Peter he uploaded a copy of\nhis mind into his head and vice versa, Peter\u2019s real mind was still in his body\nthe whole time but buried.</p></p>",

Didn&rsquo;t know this was an anthology team up title jeez.</p><p>Did it go out with a bang or a whimper? Well&hellip;a bit of\nboth.</p><p>&hellip;And by both I mean there were literal bangs in the issue\nso the whimpers&hellip;you get it&hellip;</p><p>Okay so for starters the cover lies again like in issue #1. The\ncover promises us Peter in Kamala&rsquo;s body with spider powers and Kamala in Peter&rsquo;s\nbody with Inhuman powers.</p><p>And in the issue we get&hellip;the same shit from the past 2\nissues, standard Freaky Friday.</p><p>It&rsquo;s less bad here than in issue #1 though. Issue #1&rsquo;s lie\nwas actively reductive to the reading experience. Here it&rsquo;s just artistic\nlicence and really the idea of seeing Spidey with Kamala&rsquo;s powers and vice\nversa is only good for a strong visual. If Peter in Kamala&rsquo;s body got the same\npower set it&rsquo;d seriously undermine the creative legs of the Freaky Friday\ndynamic in the first place. So a quick cover for an eye catching visual is good\nenough.</p><p>Moving on&hellip;this issue is kind of the weakest instalment in\nthis already kind of shakey arc. If you turned your brain off you could kind of\nenjoy issues #1-2 but the creative energy in this issue was waning a lot.</p><p>You can tell this because once the Jackal, the villain of\nthis arc, gets defeated the issue continues for over 11 pages. Over 11 pages of\nrestoring the status quo.</p><p>And when I say restoring the status quo I don&rsquo;t simply mean\nPeter and Kamala inevitably swap back, I mean they swap back and also forget\neverything that happened, leaving you wondering what the point of any of this\nwas.</p><p>Kamala will go forward in life never knowing the impending\ndread of job interviews or unpaid bills and Peter Parker will never remember\nthe pain and discomfort of a period or the sweet taste of cotton candy lip\ngloss&hellip;okay maybe for both parties forgetting this ever happened isn&rsquo;t the\nworst idea.</p><p>But the issue could&rsquo;ve been mitigated if Ewing had just\nrestructured the story a little bit so that the swap lasted way less than two\ndays. In fact even if they forgot what happened wouldn&rsquo;t it raise big red flags\nthat 2 days have elapsed within which they remember nothing?</p><p>Even putting this aside the story continues the trajectory\nof having a lot of small problems that add up. Some of these don&rsquo;t break the\nissue per se but the numeracy of them adds up to an over all lack of thought\nand planning put into the story.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s talk about one example I actually forgot to bring up\nin issue #2. So in the first issue when the Jackal showed up and declared\nRosario&rsquo;s Polly tech would be useful in his cloning experiments my first\nthought was &lsquo;how&rsquo;? But I let it slide because maybe the story would elaborate.</p><p>And in issue #2 it did but having Spidey throw out a theory,\nand in issue #3 we got that theory confirmed.</p><p>The plan goes like this. The Jackal&rsquo;s wants to use Rosario&rsquo;s\ntech alongside his cloning tech to create clones with the consciousness of\nanother person.</p><p>When that happened my thoughts Digivolved from &lsquo;how?&rsquo; into &lsquo;why?&rsquo;</p><p>Like&hellip;okay, the Jackal has a God complex.</p><p>OBVIOUSLY. </p><p>Even shitty BND era writers picked up on that.</p><p>This would definitely come under the remit of playing God,\nbut even during the nadir of the Clone Saga (we call that Maximum Clonage kids)\nyou could just about see the method in his madness. It wasn&rsquo;t rationale but it\nadded up within his warped logic. He wanted to destroy life on Earth and\nreplace it with the life HE created.</p><p>Cool.</p><p>Now in this story he wants to&hellip;basically transfer someone&rsquo;s\nmind into someone else&rsquo;s body, but not even their actual body a copy of their\nactual body.</p><p>What possible purpose would that serve?</p><p>I could KIND of see it if he wanted to transfer people&rsquo;s\nminds into clones of their own bodies. Like what happened to Xavier after he\nwas infected with the Brood.</p><p>But into a clone of someone else&rsquo;s body?</p><p>That&rsquo;s some Underpants Gnome level planning.</p><p>Not to mention can&rsquo;t he basically already do that?</p><p>He created the Carrion virus IIRC which genetically\nreprograms the infected subject into basically believing themselves to be Miles\nWarren. He was also able to update Ben Reilly&rsquo;s memories so they&rsquo;d match Peter\nParker&rsquo;s. If you can do that then surely you could already put someone&rsquo;s consciousness\ninto a body that isn&rsquo;t theirs? Or at least the scientific leap from one to the\nother isn&rsquo;t that huge.</p><p>Another rather significant issue with the plot revolves\naround the Isotope Genome Accelerator. Yeah remember that? The thing that separated\nPeter and Spider-Man back in Spencer&rsquo;s opening arc.</p><p>Remember how it heavily implied to explode in ASM v5 #5 and\nthus merge Peter and Spidey back together? Apparently not. It was either\nundamaged or got rebuilt apparently. Even better it has plot convenience powers\nnow.

You sat in your bed, sitting against the headboard and Peter had his arm around you. You couldn\u2019t lie, you were feeling things for him. Not just emotional things, but physical things too. </p><p>You stared up at Peter as he watched the TV. He looked down at you and smiled. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d He had that gorgeous smile of his plastered across his face. Your face was inches away from his. You could feel his breath against your face.</p><p>\u201cOh nothing,\u201d You turned away before he could catch you blushing. Peter kept staring. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so pretty.\u201d Your heart skipped a beat as he said that.</p><p>\u201cW-what?\u201d You turned to face him, suddenly feeling too close to him.</p><p>\u201cI- You heard me. I said you\u2019re pretty. You\u2019re fucking gorgeous actually.\u201d You were flustered. You had no idea what to say to him.</p><p>\u201cPeter, I-\u201d He cut you off before you could continue.</p><p>\u201cLook, Y/N, I- I know I shouldn\u2019t say this and I know this could&hellip; I don\u2019t know, temporarily damage our friendship if you don\u2019t feel the same way, but I don\u2019t care anymore. I can\u2019t hold in the way I feel about you anymore. I\u2019m in love with you Y/N. I know that\u2019s a lot, but it\u2019s true. Everything about you is perfect even your \u201cimperfections.\u201d We have this connection and it\u2019s something that I\u2019ve never felt with anyone else before. I tried pushing these feelings away, but I honestly can\u2019t anymore. Sorry I know that\u2019s probably a lot to take in&hellip;\u201d You\u2019d never expected Peter to be confessing his feelings to you in a big, long romantic speech, but you felt the exact same way about him. You just hadn\u2019t had the chance to admit it to yourself until now.</p><p>\u201cPeter I- I feel the same way. I haven\u2019t been able to admit it to myself till now because I was afraid that if I did, I would be ruining our friendship. The thing is, I don\u2019t think there is anyone else I want or could be with. You are everything I could ever want in a guy and no one knows me better than you. On top of all of that, it seems like you have this magical power where you\u2019re the only one who has any ability to calm me down, after my panic attacks or nightmares, literally whatever it is. It\u2019s you, Peter.\u201d You looked up at him. </p><p>He had a small grin on his face as his eyes flickered between your eyes and your lips. He slid his hand to cup your face, they fit perfectly into each other. \u201cIs this okay?\u201d He asked in the softest voice. You nodded your head. </p><p>You moved towards him, his lips capturing yours. Your hands moved into his hair as your lips moved perfectly against each other. It felt like you had this hunger inside of you that needed to be fed, and Peter was the only remedy for it. Peter\u2019s tongue slipped into your mouth, as his hands moved to your waist. He pulled you to straddle his lap. You pulled away from him, resting your forehead against his. His eyes looked into yours. Suddenly, he looked slightly confused. You pulled your face away from his a little.</p><p>\u201cY/N, why are your eyes pink, I thought I had all your colors memorized.\u201d His hands slid onto your face, as he looked at your eyes. You blushed as you remembered.</p><p>\u201cOh yea I- well I was never really able to show you or anyone else for that matter, it\u2019s a color that only I\u2019ve ever seen. It sort of a mix of romantic feelings, lust, sexual desire, and/or being turned on. I\u2019m definitely all of the above. I\u2019ve noticed that the tone of pink changes depending on if it\u2019s more romantic or sexual.\u201d Peter smirked as he pulled you into a hug with you still in his lap.</p><p>\u201cI fucking love that I do those things to you.\u201d He giggled.</p><p>\u201cStop, oh my god Pete! Look, I think we should stop this for tonight, I mean we just confessed our feelings to each other. I don\u2019t think we should go further than kissing just for tonight. I know we\u2019re gonna move fast considering that we were basically dating before except we acted like friends, but I don\u2019t think we should have sex tonight. Trust me I want to, oh my god I want to. Let\u2019s just relax together and watch The Office for the rest of the night. Plus today has been an overwhelming day.\u201d You moved off of Peter\u2019s lap and back to where you were before.</p><p>\u201cYou literally took the words out of my mouth. We need to explore this a little before we go there, but trust me, I wanna go there too, holy shit. Also your pink eyes are sexy as hell. Well actually everything about you is sexy as hell.\u201d He gave you a quick peck on the lips and turned the show back on, leaving you blushing. \u201cSorry I couldn\u2019t resist.\u201d He giggled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than alright, and if it makes you feel any better, you&rsquo;re also sexy as hell. I would honestly be lying if I said I haven\u2019t dreamt about you boxing shirtless in the gym.\u201d You laughed and cuddled into his side. He turned and looked at you with his eyebrows raised.</p><p>\u201cOh yea, is that so? Well, I\u2019ve had my fair share of dreams about you, and not all of them have been clean&hellip; but if we continue this conversation, I will literally have to leave this room because if not I won\u2019t be able to resist you.\u201d You both laughed at Peter\u2019s comment.</p><p>*******</p><p>Tony opened the door to your room.

You sat in your bed, sitting against the headboard and Peter had his arm around you. You couldn\u2019t lie, you were feeling things for him. Not just emotional things, but physical things too. </p><p>You stared up at Peter as he watched the TV. He looked down at you and smiled. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d He had that gorgeous smile of his plastered across his face. Your face was inches away from his. You could feel his breath against your face.</p><p>\u201cOh nothing,\u201d You turned away before he could catch you blushing. Peter kept staring. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so pretty.\u201d Your heart skipped a beat as he said that.</p><p>\u201cW-what?\u201d You turned to face him, suddenly feeling too close to him.</p><p>\u201cI- You heard me. I said you\u2019re pretty. You\u2019re fucking gorgeous actually.\u201d You were flustered. You had no idea what to say to him.</p><p>\u201cPeter, I-\u201d He cut you off before you could continue.</p><p>\u201cLook, Y/N, I- I know I shouldn\u2019t say this and I know this could\u2026 I don\u2019t know, temporarily damage our friendship if you don\u2019t feel the same way, but I don\u2019t care anymore. I can\u2019t hold in the way I feel about you anymore. I\u2019m in love with you Y/N. I know that\u2019s a lot, but it\u2019s true. Everything about you is perfect even your \u201cimperfections.\u201d We have this connection and it\u2019s something that I\u2019ve never felt with anyone else before. I tried pushing these feelings away, but I honestly can\u2019t anymore. Sorry I know that\u2019s probably a lot to take in\u2026\u201d You\u2019d never expected Peter to be confessing his feelings to you in a big, long romantic speech, but you felt the exact same way about him. You just hadn\u2019t had the chance to admit it to yourself until now.</p><p>\u201cPeter I- I feel the same way. I haven\u2019t been able to admit it to myself till now because I was afraid that if I did, I would be ruining our friendship. The thing is, I don\u2019t think there is anyone else I want or could be with. You are everything I could ever want in a guy and no one knows me better than you. On top of all of that, it seems like you have this magical power where you\u2019re the only one who has any ability to calm me down, after my panic attacks or nightmares, literally whatever it is. It\u2019s you, Peter.\u201d You looked up at him. </p><p>He had a small grin on his face as his eyes flickered between your eyes and your lips. He slid his hand to cup your face, they fit perfectly into each other. \u201cIs this okay?\u201d He asked in the softest voice. You nodded your head. </p><p>You moved towards him, his lips capturing yours. Your hands moved into his hair as your lips moved perfectly against each other. It felt like you had this hunger inside of you that needed to be fed, and Peter was the only remedy for it. Peter\u2019s tongue slipped into your mouth, as his hands moved to your waist. He pulled you to straddle his lap. You pulled away from him, resting your forehead against his. His eyes looked into yours. Suddenly, he looked slightly confused. You pulled your face away from his a little.</p><p>\u201cY/N, why are your eyes pink, I thought I had all your colors memorized.\u201d His hands slid onto your face, as he looked at your eyes. You blushed as you remembered.</p><p>\u201cOh yea I- well I was never really able to show you or anyone else for that matter, it\u2019s a color that only I\u2019ve ever seen. It sort of a mix of romantic feelings, lust, sexual desire, and/or being turned on. I\u2019m definitely all of the above. I\u2019ve noticed that the tone of pink changes depending on if it\u2019s more romantic or sexual.\u201d Peter smirked as he pulled you into a hug with you still in his lap.</p><p>\u201cI fucking love that I do those things to you.\u201d He giggled.</p><p>\u201cStop, oh my god Pete! Look, I think we should stop this for tonight, I mean we just confessed our feelings to each other. I don\u2019t think we should go further than kissing just for tonight. I know we\u2019re gonna move fast considering that we were basically dating before except we acted like friends, but I don\u2019t think we should have sex tonight. Trust me I want to, oh my god I want to. Let\u2019s just relax together and watch The Office for the rest of the night. Plus today has been an overwhelming day.\u201d You moved off of Peter\u2019s lap and back to where you were before.</p><p>\u201cYou literally took the words out of my mouth. We need to explore this a little before we go there, but trust me, I wanna go there too, holy shit. Also your pink eyes are sexy as hell. Well actually everything about you is sexy as hell.\u201d He gave you a quick peck on the lips and turned the show back on, leaving you blushing. \u201cSorry I couldn\u2019t resist.\u201d He giggled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than alright, and if it makes you feel any better, you\u2019re also sexy as hell. I would honestly be lying if I said I haven\u2019t dreamt about you boxing shirtless in the gym.\u201d You laughed and cuddled into his side. He turned and looked at you with his eyebrows raised.</p><p>\u201cOh yea, is that so? Well, I\u2019ve had my fair share of dreams about you, and not all of them have been clean\u2026 but if we continue this conversation, I will literally have to leave this room because if not I won\u2019t be able to resist you.\u201d You both laughed at Peter\u2019s comment.</p><p>*******</p><p>Tony opened the door to your room. Both you and Peter were laying cuddled asleep in your bed with The Office still playing on the TV. There was something different about it this time though. You were closer and your legs were tangled in his. He knew what had happened. He smiled. \u201cFinally.\u201d He said to himself. He closed the door and left as if he hadn\u2019t seen anything.</p><p><a href=\"https://spiderlingsweb.tumblr.com/post/185480415374/wreckless-love-chapter-11-summery-youre-the\">Next Chapter</a></p><p><a href=\"https://spiderlingsweb.tumblr.com/post/176783082489/wreckless-love-masterlist\">Series Masterlist</a></p><p>taglist:<i> (crossed out means your user didn\u2019t pop up) <b>also please read the A/N at the top above the gif</b></i></p><p><i>if you want to be added to the taglist let me know and i\u2019ll add you or if you changed your username tell me so i can replace it on the taglist!</i></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrhktVC5rC3MII45_k5glsA\">@15-shades-of-fangirl</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2A5hP_yFWgXsCAXfXZ7WBw\">@tom-hollands-eyelash</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA7b7XQDTTjPhV6jTEuU6Jg\">@yourwonderbelle</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNea1DqOYqAWVZTfTenqGzg\">@keirashark</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnAPmuMjxqNenxeFqq4iztg\">@blueivysuniverse</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu2Lx6-oDqIfWECsH3BfE8A\">@m4shtyx</a> <strike>@clarissamorningstar</strike> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnCVjJEMKp1QypCCWp8arww\">@xlittlemissydjx</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDPeplTMCnSSkDIJ6mKWWeQ\">@loxbbg</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGZJpBMdq3d6okYctyoiK0w\">@maybeidontwannachooseaname</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUg1Vs_BHiPO0bEvihb243A\">@sweetacp</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb4Ng5BIH0qBGMsIxMoF2tw\">@blue-wonderland</a> <strike>@southsidesweetheart</strike> <strike>@dailymariss</strike> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqQEdJZ4EPHl4cOZIOczfWQ\">@writingisapassion</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\">@vxidnik</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7r9zYIQBdQvtnzrtg4SwXw\">@rainywagonpicklemug</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCYvadBWpZlcFLNaZEHlIBA\">@superbdonutgirl</a> <strike>@annika3039</strike> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mK5uE1UC27qQgBUEIRtNubw\">@iamaunicorn4704</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn0-azfE8MrqAXWkFnkPGAQ\">@wishbonewolf</a> @irondadandspiderkid <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-vK_XPk5Oj30f3U0lqEb1Q\">@bookgirlunicorn</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV2EtEmTkLnTMvr-7MdLEmw\">@lexi-laz</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrthaw2nRI3LU3uTIQpacbg\">@chloe-geoghegan1</a> <strike>@woman-of-letters-legacy</strike> <strike>@thetea-theshade-thepinklemonade</strike> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXopaULzE66wYJKwhskNAJw\">@obsessedfangirl4lyfe</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mP1j-xz_EGzDouCZ2fq-0Hw\">@raegan-the-asshole</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57JD5arDGPQkxn9DyRK14Q\">@tomshufflepuff</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqQcSTViPVL31LlP9NubuOw\">@hiimalyssawriter</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/msTNeyCWZAM5yo0cKwGrBeg\">@tiffy119</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlp9XZh_VOhNLTloGdf9vUg\">@imabrooklynbich</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcqHmKhFDXoBBLNKdV3I7UA\">@rubygalaxyvh</a> <strike>@twwtxfs128</strike> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5WUgXxbDJaUF5MjMIZWSrQ\">@aya-writing</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFmpGRjCwmu-OpV-wKJ_kwA\">@yafriendlyfangirl</a> <strike>@brozekey3215</strike> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFiMQ8IsWpzpNlclj7ObanQ\">@askyfullof-dreams</a> <strike>@percabeth-is-canon</strike> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moWXZ7C2HEoOT1EaSoFCoRA\">@superwholockwannabe</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrKtxjFvVWAS9X-9JgTIh8Q\">@venetumx</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5epc-hzKPMotrgHL5skymA\">@scarletsoldierrr</a> <strike>@krxstynnn</strike> <strike>@scottyisthatyou</strike> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4Z3f3RyJDTxqt2erC9pR9A\">@unhealthyobsessionwithmarvel</a></p><p><i><b>if you want to be added to the taglist let me know and i\u2019ll add you or if you changed your username tell me so i can replace it on the taglist!</b></i></p></p>",

Not just emotional things, but physical things too. </p><p>You stared up at Peter as he watched the TV. He looked down at you and smiled. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d He had that gorgeous smile of his plastered across his face. Your face was inches away from his. You could feel his breath against your face.</p><p>\u201cOh nothing,\u201d You turned away before he could catch you blushing. Peter kept staring. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so pretty.\u201d Your heart skipped a beat as he said that.</p><p>\u201cW-what?\u201d You turned to face him, suddenly feeling too close to him.</p><p>\u201cI- You heard me. I said you\u2019re pretty. You\u2019re fucking gorgeous actually.\u201d You were flustered. You had no idea what to say to him.</p><p>\u201cPeter, I-\u201d He cut you off before you could continue.</p><p>\u201cLook, Y/N, I- I know I shouldn\u2019t say this and I know this could\u2026 I don\u2019t know, temporarily damage our friendship if you don\u2019t feel the same way, but I don\u2019t care anymore. I can\u2019t hold in the way I feel about you anymore. I\u2019m in love with you Y/N. I know that\u2019s a lot, but it\u2019s true. Everything about you is perfect even your \u201cimperfections.\u201d We have this connection and it\u2019s something that I\u2019ve never felt with anyone else before. I tried pushing these feelings away, but I honestly can\u2019t anymore. Sorry I know that\u2019s probably a lot to take in\u2026\u201d You\u2019d never expected Peter to be confessing his feelings to you in a big, long romantic speech, but you felt the exact same way about him. You just hadn\u2019t had the chance to admit it to yourself until now.</p><p>\u201cPeter I- I feel the same way. I haven\u2019t been able to admit it to myself till now because I was afraid that if I did, I would be ruining our friendship. The thing is, I don\u2019t think there is anyone else I want or could be with. You are everything I could ever want in a guy and no one knows me better than you. On top of all of that, it seems like you have this magical power where you\u2019re the only one who has any ability to calm me down, after my panic attacks or nightmares, literally whatever it is. It\u2019s you, Peter.\u201d You looked up at him. </p><p>He had a small grin on his face as his eyes flickered between your eyes and your lips. He slid his hand to cup your face, they fit perfectly into each other. \u201cIs this okay?\u201d He asked in the softest voice. You nodded your head. </p><p>You moved towards him, his lips capturing yours. Your hands moved into his hair as your lips moved perfectly against each other. It felt like you had this hunger inside of you that needed to be fed, and Peter was the only remedy for it. Peter\u2019s tongue slipped into your mouth, as his hands moved to your waist. He pulled you to straddle his lap. You pulled away from him, resting your forehead against his. His eyes looked into yours. Suddenly, he looked slightly confused. You pulled your face away from his a little.</p><p>\u201cY/N, why are your eyes pink, I thought I had all your colors memorized.\u201d His hands slid onto your face, as he looked at your eyes. You blushed as you remembered.</p><p>\u201cOh yea I- well I was never really able to show you or anyone else for that matter, it\u2019s a color that only I\u2019ve ever seen. It sort of a mix of romantic feelings, lust, sexual desire, and/or being turned on. I\u2019m definitely all of the above. I\u2019ve noticed that the tone of pink changes depending on if it\u2019s more romantic or sexual.\u201d Peter smirked as he pulled you into a hug with you still in his lap.</p><p>\u201cI fucking love that I do those things to you.\u201d He giggled.</p><p>\u201cStop, oh my god Pete! Look, I think we should stop this for tonight, I mean we just confessed our feelings to each other. I don\u2019t think we should go further than kissing just for tonight. I know we\u2019re gonna move fast considering that we were basically dating before except we acted like friends, but I don\u2019t think we should have sex tonight. Trust me I want to, oh my god I want to. Let\u2019s just relax together and watch The Office for the rest of the night. Plus today has been an overwhelming day.\u201d You moved off of Peter\u2019s lap and back to where you were before.</p><p>\u201cYou literally took the words out of my mouth. We need to explore this a little before we go there, but trust me, I wanna go there too, holy shit. Also your pink eyes are sexy as hell. Well actually everything about you is sexy as hell.\u201d He gave you a quick peck on the lips and turned the show back on, leaving you blushing. \u201cSorry I couldn\u2019t resist.\u201d He giggled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than alright, and if it makes you feel any better, you\u2019re also sexy as hell. I would honestly be lying if I said I haven\u2019t dreamt about you boxing shirtless in the gym.\u201d You laughed and cuddled into his side. He turned and looked at you with his eyebrows raised.</p><p>\u201cOh yea, is that so? Well, I\u2019ve had my fair share of dreams about you, and not all of them have been clean\u2026 but if we continue this conversation, I will literally have to leave this room because if not I won\u2019t be able to resist you.\u201d You both laughed at Peter\u2019s comment.</p><p>*******</p><p>Tony opened the door to your room. Both you and Peter were laying cuddled asleep in your bed with The Office still playing on the TV. There was something different about it this time though. You were closer and your legs were tangled in his. He knew what had happened. He smiled. \u201cFinally.\u201d He said to himself. He closed the door and left as if he hadn\u2019t seen anything.</p><p><a href=\"https://spiderlingsweb.tumblr.com/post/185480415374/wreckless-love-chapter-11-summery-youre-the\">Next Chapter</a></p><p><a href=\"https://spiderlingsweb.tumblr.com/post/176783082489/wreckless-love-masterlist\">Series Masterlist</a></p><p>taglist:<i> (crossed out means your user didn\u2019t pop up) <b>also please read the A/N at the top above the gif</b></i></p><p><i>if you want to be added to the taglist let me know and i\u2019ll add you or if you changed your username tell me so i can replace it on the taglist!</i></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrhktVC5rC3MII45_k5glsA\">@15-shades-of-fangirl</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2A5hP_yFWgXsCAXfXZ7WBw\">@tom-hollands-eyelash</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA7b7XQDTTjPhV6jTEuU6Jg\">@yourwonderbelle</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNea1DqOYqAWVZTfTenqGzg\">@keirashark</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnAPmuMjxqNenxeFqq4iztg\">@blueivysuniverse</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu2Lx6-oDqIfWECsH3BfE8A\">@m4shtyx</a> <strike>@clarissamorningstar</strike> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnCVjJEMKp1QypCCWp8arww\">@xlittlemissydjx</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDPeplTMCnSSkDIJ6mKWWeQ\">@loxbbg</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGZJpBMdq3d6okYctyoiK0w\">@maybeidontwannachooseaname</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUg1Vs_BHiPO0bEvihb243A\">@sweetacp</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb4Ng5BIH0qBGMsIxMoF2tw\">@blue-wonderland</a> <strike>@southsidesweetheart</strike> <strike>@dailymariss</strike> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqQEdJZ4EPHl4cOZIOczfWQ\">@writingisapassion</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\">@vxidnik</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7r9zYIQBdQvtnzrtg4SwXw\">@rainywagonpicklemug</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCYvadBWpZlcFLNaZEHlIBA\">@superbdonutgirl</a> <strike>@annika3039</strike> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mK5uE1UC27qQgBUEIRtNubw\">@iamaunicorn4704</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn0-azfE8MrqAXWkFnkPGAQ\">@wishbonewolf</a> @irondadandspiderkid <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-vK_XPk5Oj30f3U0lqEb1Q\">@bookgirlunicorn</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV2EtEmTkLnTMvr-7MdLEmw\">@lexi-laz</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrthaw2nRI3LU3uTIQpacbg\">@chloe-geoghegan1</a> <strike>@woman-of-letters-legacy</strike> <strike>@thetea-theshade-thepinklemonade</strike> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXopaULzE66wYJKwhskNAJw\">@obsessedfangirl4lyfe</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mP1j-xz_EGzDouCZ2fq-0Hw\">@raegan-the-asshole</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57JD5arDGPQkxn9DyRK14Q\">@tomshufflepuff</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqQcSTViPVL31LlP9NubuOw\">@hiimalyssawriter</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/msTNeyCWZAM5yo0cKwGrBeg\">@tiffy119</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlp9XZh_VOhNLTloGdf9vUg\">@imabrooklynbich</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcqHmKhFDXoBBLNKdV3I7UA\">@rubygalaxyvh</a> <strike>@twwtxfs128</strike> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5WUgXxbDJaUF5MjMIZWSrQ\">@aya-writing</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFmpGRjCwmu-OpV-wKJ_kwA\">@yafriendlyfangirl</a> <strike>@brozekey3215</strike> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFiMQ8IsWpzpNlclj7ObanQ\">@askyfullof-dreams</a> <strike>@percabeth-is-canon</strike> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moWXZ7C2HEoOT1EaSoFCoRA\">@superwholockwannabe</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrKtxjFvVWAS9X-9JgTIh8Q\">@venetumx</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5epc-hzKPMotrgHL5skymA\">@scarletsoldierrr</a> <strike>@krxstynnn</strike> <strike>@scottyisthatyou</strike> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4Z3f3RyJDTxqt2erC9pR9A\">@unhealthyobsessionwithmarvel</a></p><p><i><b>if you want to be added to the taglist let me know and i\u2019ll add you or if you changed your username tell me so i can replace it on the taglist!</b></i></p></p>",
