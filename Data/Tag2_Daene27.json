        "question": "I'm getting rather tired of the argument that Mad!Dany is set up even in the books. I'm yet to see ANY receipts on that. You've actually helped me to realise that a lot of the \"foreshadowing scenes\" in GoT are negative deviations from their book counterparts. E.g., her claim that Qarth would burn and all ensuing threats against Xaro Xhoan Daxos are show-only moments yet often cited as evidence. You're so well-versed on Dany, so I want to ask, what do the books really hint at for her destiny?",
        "answer": "<p>\n\nThe question \u201cwhat do the books hint at for her destiny?\u201d is rather broad. Many things could be a hint of her endgame, and to be quite honest, I don\u2019t think the books give us a clear idea of what Dany\u2019s endgame is. As a Dany fan that wants to see her succeed, I can give you a list of reasons to why I think she\u2019ll survive. But there are many other meta writers out there that will also find many hints that Dany will die, or even that she\u2019ll become mad or evil (and I vehemently disagree with her ever being evil or the mad queen). So I\u2019m going to focus on answering about the \u201cMad Queen Dany\u201d theory and why I don\u2019t think this is her endgame (if you have a more specific question about what I think about her endgame other than Mad Queen Dany, please feel free to send another ask). I also want to talk about how the idea of madness impacts thematically in Dany\u2019s story.</p><!-- more --><p>There are different arguments that are used in favor of the Mad Queen theory. Some of them have some basis in the books, and some of them are completely baseless. The main arguments I see in favor of the mad queen theory are: that Dany is violent; that Dany is paranoid; and that Dany has hallucinations. So let\u2019s talk about each of them.<b><br/></b></p><p><b>\u201cDany is violent, therefore, she\u2019s mad\u201d</b></p><p>I think this argument fails on different levels.</p><p>First, because violence is not indication of madness. A person can be violent and not be mentally ill, and a person can be mentally ill and not be violent. In the books, we see many characters being violent, from Jon Snow to Tywin Lannister, and yet no one ever says they\u2019re insane. It always goes back to sexism: a woman showing any emotion or anger? Oh, must be madness! So this argument is bullshit.</p><p>Second, because Dany\u2019s supposed violence is always highly exaggerated in the fandom. What are her moments of violence? Well, Dany conquers cities to free slaves. Is that violence bad? I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t see any other way for Dany to free the slaves. It\u2019s not like the masters will just decide to free the slaves if Dany asks them politely. And Dany using force and military power to conquer the slave cities is no different from characters like Stannis or Robb fighting in the War of the Five Kings. Actually, I would say Dany using her armies to free slaves is a much more noble goal than most of the other characters we see in ASOIAF. And yet you don\u2019t see people calling them mad, only Dany. In my opinion, there are only two moments in which we could say that Dany is violent and acts impulsively because of anger in the books: when she orders the crucifixions of the slavers and when she allows torture. And yet, there\u2019s nothing here to say that Dany is mad. Dany crucified slavers because the slavers crucified children. And she didn\u2019t choose random people to crucify: she specifically asked for the leaders of Meereen, and she told them to choose amongst themselves who would be crucified. Was it right? No. Was it justice? No. But I think Dany\u2019s reaction is pretty understandable given that Dany just witnessed the brutal crucifixion of children by the Meereenese masters just to taunt her, and it\u2019s also understandable because Dany never had a good role model to teach her about justice (she was raised by Viserys, so it\u2019s amazing that Dany turned out to be such a good person). Dany is trying to do what\u2019s right, but Dany doesn\u2019t always know what\u2019s right. About Dany allowing torture, again, this is not outside what\u2019s accepted in their society. Torture is considered to be a legitimate means of obtaining information, and Dany is a product of her society. There\u2019s also the fact that Dany was also being manipulated by the Shavepate. Besides, Dany does forbid torture later when she realizes it\u2019s ineffective.</p><p>So Dany only has TWO darker moments in the books (she has other flaws, but these are, in my opinion, the only really bad moments for her character), and both are understandable given her upbringing and the society she lives in. So the people calling her violent are just applying double standards. This is even more clear when you consider that there are other characters that also have impulsive moments in which they act out of anger. One example is Jon Snow, who also loses his temper in different moments:</p><blockquote><p>And then he heard the laughter, sharp and cruel as a whip, and the voice of Ser Alliser Thorne. <b>\u201cNot only a bastard, but a traitor\u2019s bastard,\u201d</b> he was telling the men around him.</p><p><b>In the blink of an eye, Jon had vaulted onto the table, dagger in his hand. </b>Pyp made a grab for him, but he wrenched his leg away, and then he was sprinting down the table and kicking the bowl from Ser Alliser\u2019s hand. Stew went flying everywhere, spattering the brothers. Thorne recoiled. People were shouting, but Jon Snow did not hear them. <b>He lunged at Ser Alliser\u2019s face with the dagger, slashing at those cold onyx eyes,</b> but Sam threw himself between them and before Jon could get around him, Pyp was on his back clinging like a monkey, and Grenn was grabbing his arm while Toad wrenched the knife from his fingers. - Jon VII AGOT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>He was almost ready to lower his blade and call a halt when Emmett feinted low and came in over his shield with a savage forehand slash that caught Jon on the temple. He staggered, his helm and head both ringing from the force of the blow. For half a heartbeat the world beyond his eyeslit was a blur.</p><p>And then the years were gone, and he was back at Winterfell once more, wearing a quilted leather coat in place of mail and plate. His sword was made of wood, and it was Robb who stood facing him, not Iron Emmett.</p><p>[\u2026]</p><p>That morning he called it first. \u201cI\u2019m Lord of Winterfell!\u201d he cried, as he had a hundred times before. Only this time, this time, Robb had answered, \u201cYou can\u2019t be Lord of Winterfell, you\u2019re bastard-born. My lady mother says you can\u2019t ever be the Lord of Winterfell.\u201d</p><p>I thought I had forgotten that. Jon could taste blood in his mouth, from the blow he\u2019d taken.</p><p><b>In the end Halder and Horse had to pull him away from Iron Emmett, one man on either arm. The ranger sat on the ground dazed, his shield half in splinters, the visor of his helm knocked askew, and his sword six yards away. \u201cJon, enough,\u201d Halder was shouting, \u201che\u2019s down, you disarmed him. Enough!\u201d</b></p><p><b>No. Not enough. Never enough.</b> Jon let his sword drop. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he muttered. \u201cEmmett, are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>Iron Emmett pulled his battered helm off. \u201cWas there some part of yield you could not comprehend, Lord Snow?\u201d It was said amiably, though. Emmett was an amiable man, and he loved the song of swords. \u201cWarrior defend me,\u201d he groaned, \u201cnow I know how Qhorin Halfhand must have felt.\u201d - Jon XII ASOS</p></blockquote><p>Jon loses his temper and tries to kill someone over an insult. He also completely loses his senses and starts mindlessly beating a guy. Dany never had any moment in which she tried to kill someone over an insult (actually, there are moments in which people spit in her face and try to attack her, and she still forgives them), and Dany never loses her senses in anger. And yet, I don\u2019t see people calling Jon mad for losing his temper and being violent. These are double standards (and if you want to know more about darker Jon moments in the books, you can read my meta <b><a href=\"https://rainhadaenerys.tumblr.com/post/184810432287/hi-ive-only-read-the-first-book-and-that-was#notes\">HERE</a></b>). If you don\u2019t think Jon is \u201cmad\u201d for being violent or losing his temper, you shouldn\u2019t think this of Dany either (and like I said, violence is not the same thing as madness).</p><p><b>\u201cDany is paranoid\u201d</b></p><p>This is an argument that I completely disagree with and that I think is completely baseless. Dany is not a paranoid person. She knows that she needs to trust people and work with them, and that otherwise, she would end up alienating everyone that could help her:</p><blockquote><p><b>\u201cIt seems to me that a queen who trusts no one is as foolish as a queen who trusts everyone.</b> Every man I take into my service is a risk, I understand that, but how am I to win the Seven Kingdoms without such risks? Am I to conquer Westeros with one exile knight and three Dothraki bloodriders?\u201d \u2013 Daenerys I ASOS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cI am glad you came to me. It is good to see your face again, my friend.\u201d<b> I will not trust you, but I need you. I need your Thirteen, I need your ships, I need your trade.</b> - Daenerys III ADWD</p></blockquote><p>People in the fandom sometimes say that Dany is paranoid about prophecies. But this isn\u2019t true either. Dany receives several prophecies throughout the story, from Mirri Maz Duur, from the House of the Undying, and from Quaithe. And some of these prophecies warn her about some dangers: the Undying tell Dany that she\u2019ll know three treasons, one for blood, one for money and one for love. And Quaithe tells Dany to not trust many people: kraken and dark flame, lion and griffin, the sun\u2019s son and the mummer\u2019s dragons. So it would be understandable if she started to act a little paranoid. But she doesn\u2019t. Dany suspects many people, but she continues to accept them in her service:</p><blockquote><p>There were times when Dany wondered if that razor might not be better saved for Reznak\u2019s throat. He was a useful man, but she liked him little and trusted him less. <b>The Undying of Qarth had told her she would be thrice betrayed.</b> Mirri Maz Duur had been the first, Ser Jorah the second. <b>Would Reznak be the third? The Shavepate? Daario? Or will it be someone I would never suspect, Ser Barristan or Grey Worm or Missandei? </b>\u2013 Daenerys I ADWD</p></blockquote><p>As we can see, Dany distrusts all of these people. But she still keeps them in her service, not letting her doubts consume her.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cIt has been so long,\u201d she had said to Ser Barristan, just yesterday. <b>\u201cWhat if Daario has betrayed me and gone over to my enemies?\u201d Three treasons will you know.</b> \u201cWhat if he met another woman, some princess of the Lhazarene?\u201d \u2013 Daenerys II ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Dany thinks that Daario might betray her. She thinks sellswords are treacherous, but she still sleeps with him.</p><p>Dany constantly thinks that prophecies are treacherous, and that she should not let them dictate her decisions:</p><blockquote><p><b>When Reznak and Skahaz appeared, she found herself looking at them askance, mindful of the three treasons. Beware the perfumed seneschal.</b> She sniffed suspiciously at Reznak mo Reznak. I could command the Shavepate to arrest him and put him to the question. Would that forestall the prophecy? Or would some other betrayer take his place? <b>Prophecies are treacherous, she reminded herself, and Reznak may be no more than he appears.</b> \u2013 Daenerys II ADWD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n\nHis bitterness dismayed her, so much so that <b>Dany found herself wondering if the grizzled Pentoshi could be one of her three betrayers. No, he is only an old man, far from home and sick at heart.</b> - Daenerys V ADWD\u00a0</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>He shall be the stallion that mounts the world. Dany knew how it went with prophecies. They were made of words, and words were wind.</b>\u00a0- Daenerys IV ADWD</p></blockquote><p>And even when Quentyn comes to her, she doesn\u2019t do anything about the prophecy, even though she knows that he\u2019s the sun\u2019s son:</p><blockquote><p><b>The sun\u2019s son. A shiver went through her.</b> \u201cShadows and whispers.\u201d What else had Quaithe said? The pale mare and the sun\u2019s son. There was a lion in it too, and a dragon. Or am I the dragon? \u201cBeware the perfumed seneschal.\u201d That she remembered. <b>\u201cDreams and prophecies. Why must they always be in riddles?</b> I hate this. Oh, leave me, ser. Tomorrow is my wedding day.\u201d \u2013 Daenerys VII</p></blockquote><p>So I don\u2019t really agree with the assessment that Dany is paranoid about prophecies. She worries about the prophecies, but she never lets them influence her actions and judgement, and is very aware that prophecies are treacherous. And actually, Dany\u2019s behaviour towards prophecy is written as a foil to another character: Cersei. Cersei is the one that is really paranoid. She sees enemies in every shadow, is obsessed with the idea that Tyrion is hiding everywhere and is the cause of all her problems. She alienates her allies and refuses to trust anyone. And she\u2019s terrified of the Younger More Beautiful Queen prophecy and tries to do everything to avoid it (in contrast to Dany, who doesn\u2019t do anything and reminds herself that prophecies are treacherous). GRRM has said that Dany and Cersei are meant as foils, and this is one of the main contrasts between them. So Dany is written exactly to contrast Cersei\u2019s attitude - she\u2019s not paranoid like Cersei, she\u2019s the opposite.</p><p><b>\u201cDany has hallucinations\u201d</b></p><p>In the books, Dany has some visions that people sometimes use to argue that she\u2019s mad. So let\u2019s look at the different moments that I imagine that mad queen theorists use to \u201cprove\u201d that Dany is mad:</p><p><b>1)</b> In the first book, Dany has three prophetic dreams in which she dreams with dragons. These dreams (and also Mirri Maz Duur\u2019s lessons about how only death pays for life) give her the idea of stepping into the fire, and make her confident that she can walk into the fire without dying and hatch dragons.</p><p><b>2)</b> In the second book, when she is in Qarth, Dany meets a woman named Quaithe, who is a shadowbinder from Asshai. Qhaithe gives her warnings and prophecies. But in the next books, Dany starts to sometimes see and talk to Quaithe in the middle of the night, and no one else seems to see or hear Quaithe:</p><blockquote><p>She is standing over me. <b>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Dany peered into the darkness. She thought she could see a shadow, the faintest outline of a shape.</b> \u201cWhat do you want to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember. To go north, you must journey south. To reach the west, you must go east. To go forward you must go back, and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow.\u201d</p><p><b>\u201cQuaithe?\u201d</b> Dany sprung from the bed and threw open the door. Pale yellow lantern light flooded the cabin, and Irri and Jhiqui sat up sleepily. \u201cKhaleesi?\u201d murmured Jhiqui, rubbing her eyes. <b>Viserion woke and opened his jaws, and a puff of flame brightened even the darkest corners. There was no sign of a woman in a red lacquer mask. \u201cKhaleesi, are you unwell?\u201d asked Jhiqui.</b></p><p><b>\u201cA dream.\u201d Dany shook her head. \u201cI dreamed a dream, no more.</b> Go back to sleep. All of us, go back to sleep.\u201d Yet try as she might, sleep would not come again. - Daenerys III ASOS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>\u201cQuaithe? Am I dreaming?\u201d</b> She pinched her ear and winced at the pain. \u201cI dreamt of you on Balerion, when first we came to Astapor.\u201d</p><p><b>\u201cYou did not dream. Then or now.\u201d</b></p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here? <b>How did you get past my guards?\u201d</b></p><p><b>\u201cI came another way. Your guards never saw me.\u201d</b></p><p><b>\u201cIf I call out, they will kill you.\u201d</b></p><p><b>\u201cThey will swear to you that I am not here.\u201d</b></p><p><b>\u201cAre you here?\u201d</b></p><p><b>\u201cNo.</b> [\u2026]\u201d - Daenerys II ADWD</p></blockquote><p><b>3)</b> Finally, there\u2019s Dany last chapter in ADWD. In this chapter, Dany \u201ctalks with her ghosts\u201d. She\u2019s walking alone in the Dothraki sea, and yet she sees and talks to Jorah, Quaithe, Viserys, and she even listens to the grass talking:</p><blockquote><p>Sometimes she heard birds singing. The sound made her belly rumble, but she had no nets to snare them with, and so far she had not come on any nests. Once I dreamed of flying, she thought, and now I\u2019ve flown, and dream of stealing eggs. That made her laugh. <b>\u201cMen are mad and gods are madder,\u201d she told the grass, and the grass murmured its agreement. </b>- Daenerys X ADWD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>\u201cI am the blood of the dragon,\u201d she told the grass, aloud.</b></p><p><b>Once, the grass whispered back</b>, until you chained your dragons in the dark.</p><p>\u201cDrogon killed a little girl. Her name was \u2026 her name \u2026\u201d Dany could not recall the child\u2019s name. That made her so sad that she would have cried if all her tears had not been burned away. \u201cI will never have a little girl. I was the Mother of Dragons.\u201d</p><p><b>Aye, the grass said, but you turned against your children. </b>- Daenerys X ADWD</p></blockquote><p>So\u2026 are these moments proof that Dany is mad? I don\u2019t think so at all. Let me explain why in each case:</p><p><b>1)</b> Dany doesn\u2019t have dragon dreams because she\u2019s mad. She has dragon dreams because they are truly prophetic dreams. And the proof we have of this is that they came true. Dany was right in believing that if she walked into the fire, she would survive. If this world was a world without any magic, and Dany started to have these dreams and think that they are prophetic, then I could understand the argument that she\u2019s mad. But this world has magic. Dany believing in magic and in prophetic dreams is not something that makes her mad, because magic does exist. If we start saying that Dany is \u201cmad\u201d, because she has prophetic dreams, then Bran, Jon, and Arya are all mad, because they all have wolf dreams, and all of them believe their wolf dreams to be real. If Dany\u2019s prophetic dreams and her actions to follow what her dreams tell her to do are a sign of madness, then Bran and Jojen are mad, because they too look up to prophetic dreams to guide them. So trying to say that Dany is mad for believing in magic in a world in which magic does exist, is nonsense in my opinion.</p><p><b>2)</b> Dany\u2019s encounters with Quaithe are the same thing. One could wonder: could Dany\u2019s talks with Quaithe be just a product of her mind? After all, no one else seems to see or hear Quaithe, only Dany. And Dany herself wonders, after Quaithe comes to her in Meereen, if she\u2019s mad:</p><blockquote><p><b>\u201cYour Grace?\u201d</b> Missandei stood in the door of the queen\u2019s bedchamber, a lantern in her hand. <b>\u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d</b></p><p>Dany glanced back toward the persimmon tree. There was no woman there. No hooded robe, no lacquer mask, no Quaithe.</p><p>A shadow. A memory. No one. <b>She was the blood of the dragon, but Ser Barristan had warned her that in that blood there was a taint. Could I be going mad? They had called her father mad, once.</b>\u00a0- Daenerys II ADWD</p></blockquote><p>So I see how people could use this to say Dany is mad. However, we have proof that Dany is not seeing things. Quaithe is real, not a product of her mind. And what is this proof? Well, the first time Quaithe appears to Dany in the middle of the night, Quaithe repeats to Dany something she had already told Dany in person, when she was in Qarth:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cRemember. To go north, you must journey south. To reach the west, you must go east. To go forward you must go back, and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow.\u201d - Daenerys III ASOS</p></blockquote><p>So this could very well be a product of Dany\u2019s mind, it could be her mind remembering something Quaithe said and creating some hallucination based on it. However, the second time Quaithe comes to Dany, she tells Dany something entirely new:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cNo. Hear me, Daenerys Targaryen. The glass candles are burning. Soon comes the pale mare, and after her the others. Kraken and dark flame, lion and griffin, the sun\u2019s son and the mummer\u2019s dragon. Trust none of them. Remember the Undying. Beware the perfumed seneschal.\u201d - Daenerys II ADWD</p></blockquote><p>This is not something Quaithe told Dany before. This can\u2019t be a memory that her mind turned into a hallucination. This is not even something that Dany\u2019s mind could have produced, because Dany knows nothing about a pale mare, griffin, dark flame, or any of that. This is a prophecy. And we get confirmation later that this was indeed real, Dany was not imagining Quaithe. Because later in the books, the prophecy starts to come true: the pale mare comes, the sun\u2019s son comes, and we know that kraken, dark flame, lion and mummer\u2019s dragon are all true and are all going to cross Dany\u2019s path at some point. So Dany\u2019s talks with Quaithe were not a product of her mind: they were real, and Quaithe was giving Dany real prophecies. And we have a magic device established in the lore that could explain very well how Quaithe was able to communicate with Dany: glass candles. Quaithe even mentions them:\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo. Hear me, Daenerys Targaryen. <b>The glass candles are burning.</b>\u201d So Dany was not seeing or hearing things. Quaithe was actually talking to her.</p><p><b>3)</b> Finally, let\u2019s talk about Dany\u2019s last chapter in ADWD. In this chapter, Dany was supposedly having hallucinations and this supposedly proves she\u2019s mad. However, I have two problems with this interpretation. First, because Dany was in a terrible physical condition: she had suffered sun exposure, she had walked throughout the entire day, she was hungry, tired and weak, she had eaten poisoned berries, and she had just had a miscarriage. Having hallucinations in her condition has nothing to do with madness, it\u2019s very much normal. And second, because if I\u2019m going to be quite honest, I never interpreted Dany\u2019s last chapter as her having hallucinations. In my opinion, Dany talking with her ghosts or hearing the grass is simply a literary device. GRRM wrote Dany\u2019s last chapter as a huge solitary reflexion. She\u2019s all by herself thinking about her life and her choices. He could have written this chapter as a huge monologue in which Dany ponders about things. But that would have been really tiresome. By writing Dany talking with her ghosts, GRRM makes the chapter more dynamic, more interesting, less boring. It gives us dialogue instead of a monologue. So the choice of having Dany talk with her ghosts is simply a literary device. When I read that chapter, I never really interpreted as Dany having hallucinations. When Dany talks with Viserys, I don\u2019t get the impression that Dany truly believes that Viserys is in front of her: she\u2019s simply projecting him in her mind, and imagining the things he would have said. And the same is true of the other people Dany talks to. Dany doesn\u2019t believe those people are real, she\u2019s simply using a projection of them to reflect about her choices (though, as I pointed out, if she was indeed having hallucinations, it\u2019s nothing that indicates madness, given her physical condition).</p><p>So, to summarize why Daenerys is not mad: Her dreams are prophetic and come from magic, they are not a sign of madness. Her talks with Quaithe are actually real. And her hallucinations in the Dothraki sea are, in my opinion, a literary device, but anyway, if Dany is indeed having hallucinations, it\u2019s something to be expected given her physical condition. Finally, I need to say that in the books, Dany is a very level-headed person, who occasionally loses her temper. It\u2019s impossible for me to quote the entire books here, but reading them, I see no signs of madness. And we have even more proof that Dany isn\u2019t mad through what Ser Barristan Selmy says:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWhy ask for truth,\u201d Ser Barristan said softly, \u201cif you close your ears to it?\u201d He hesitated, then continued. <b>\u201cI told you before that I used a false name so the Lannisters would not know that I\u2019d joined you. That was less than half of it, Your Grace. The truth is, I wanted to watch you for a time before pledging you my sword. To make certain that you were not \u2026\u201d</b></p><p>\u2026 my father\u2019s daughter?\u201c If she was not her father\u2019s daughter, who was she?</p><p><b>\u201d\u2026 mad,\u201c he finished. \u201cBut I see no taint in you.\u201d</b></p><p>[\u2026]<b> \u201cSo I am a coin in the hands of some god, is that what you are saying, ser?\u201d</b><br/></p><p><b>\u201cNo,\u201d Ser Barristan replied. \u201cYou are the trueborn heir of Westeros.</b> To the end of my days I shall remain your faithful knight, should you find me worthy to bear a sword again. If not, I am content to serve Strong Belwas as his squire.\u201d</p><p><b>\u201cWhat if I decide you\u2019re only worthy to be my fool?\u201d Dany asked scornfully. \u201cOr perhaps my cook?\u201d</b></p><p><b>\u201cI would be honored, Your Grace,\u201d Selmy said with quiet dignity.</b>\u00a0- Daenerys VI ASOS</p></blockquote><p>Ser Barristan knew her father. Of all people, he would know if Dany was mad, and if she was in any way like Aerys. He spends months hiding his identity and observing Dany just to see if she shows any signs of madness, and in the end, he is so sure that she isn\u2019t mad, and that she is a worthy queen to follow, that he even says he would be honored to be her cook. That\u2019s how much he trusts Dany. I think his judgement of her is yet another reason as for why the mad queen Dany theory doesn\u2019t really have a lot of basis.</p><p><b>THEMATIC IMPORTANCE OF MADNESS IN DANY\u2019S STORY</b></p><p>However, even though I don\u2019t think Dany is mad at all, I do think that \u201cmadness\u201d is an important part of her story, and I think the themes in her story are just another proof of why Dany won\u2019t go mad.</p><p><b>1)</b> One of the discussions involving madness is the madness vs greatness debate. We have this quote about the coin that everyone loves bringing up:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI am no maester to quote history at you, Your Grace. Swords have been my life, not books. <b>But every child knows that the Targaryens have always danced too close to madness. Your father was not the first. King Jaehaerys once told me that madness and greatness are two sides of the same coin. Every time a new Targaryen is born, he said, the gods toss the coin in the air and the world holds its breath to see how it will land.\u201d </b>- Daenerys VI ASOS</p></blockquote><p>But I think people really miss the point of this quote. This quote isn\u2019t saying that half the Targaryens are mad and half are not (in fact, <b><a href=\"https://tomakeitbeautifultolive.tumblr.com/post/185032357463/what-bothers-me-is-the-saying-that-when-a\">few Targaryens were indeed mad</a></b>). What it\u2019s talking about is how madness and greatness are two sides of the same coin. This means that to be great, you also have to be \u201cmad\u201d, in a way. When Dany is about to walk into Drogo\u2019s funeral pyre, this is what she tells Mirri Maz Duur:</p><blockquote><p>As she climbed down off the pyre, she noticed Mirri Maz Duur watching her. \u201cYou are mad,\u201d the godswife said hoarsely.</p><p><b>\u201cIs it so far from madness to wisdom?\u201d Dany asked.</b> - Daenerys X AGOT</p></blockquote><p>And this is a running theme in Dany\u2019s story, because if you think about it, part of what she does can indeed be seen as mad from the outside. Dany walked into a pyre! For anyone looking, this was pretty crazy! But it was also great. Because if Dany had not decided to commit this \u201cmadness\u201d, she wouldn\u2019t have hatched dragons either. To be great, Dany had to take a huge risk, she had to have a lot of courage and confidence. Most people would never take such a huge risk. Most people would consider taking a risk this huge to be madness. But Dany doesn\u2019t. She\u2019s the kind of person that is willing to go to extreme lengths to achieve something, who\u2019s willing to take risks to accomplish things that others consider impossible. That\u2019s where the madness vs greatness theme comes from, because to be great, you have to do things that most people would consider impossible (and because they consider it impossible, they call it madness). Other moment in which Dany can be considered mad is when she fights against Drogon with a whip. Many people would call this madness, while others would call it courage. And this theme can also be seen in Dany\u2019s fight against slavery. Most people would consider fighting a continent wide system madness, because it looks impossible. And yet, Dany does it anyway. Because she\u2019s the kind of person who is willing to do anything, no matter how hard it is. What other people call madness, is what makes her great.</p><p><b>2)</b> Related to this topic, Dany\u2019s defiances of society\u2019s norms is also something that leads people to call her mad. Her enemies call her mad because she dared to try to end slavery, and they also call her mad because she\u2019s a woman in a patriarchal society that dares to defy gender norms:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI have a gift for you as well.\u201d She slammed the chest shut. \u201cThree days. On the morning of the third day, send out your slaves. All of them. Every man, woman, and child shall be given a weapon, and as much food, clothing, coin, and goods as he or she can carry. These they shall be allowed to choose freely from among their masters\u2019 possessions, as payment for their years of servitude. When all the slaves have departed, you will open your gates and allow my Unsullied to enter and search your city, to make certain none remain in bondage. If you do this, Yunkai will not be burned or plundered, and none of your people shall be molested. The Wise Masters will have the peace they desire, and will have proved themselves wise indeed. What say you?\u201d</p><p><b>\u201cI say, you are mad.\u201d</b> - Daenerys IV ASOS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cWhen I went to the Hall of a Thousand Thrones to beg the Pureborn for your life, I said that you were no more than a child,\u201d Xaro went on, \u201cbut Egon Emeros the Exquisite rose and said, <b>\u2018She is a foolish child, mad and heedless and too dangerous to live.\u2019</b> When your dragons were small they were a wonder. Grown, they are death and devastation, a flaming sword above the world.\u201d He wiped away the tears. \u201cI should have slain you in Qarth.\u201d - Daenerys III ADWD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The more Quentyn heard of Daenerys Targaryen, the more he feared that meeting. <b>The Yunkai'i claimed that she fed her dragons on human flesh and bathed in the blood of virgins to keep her skin smooth and supple.</b> Beans laughed at that but relished the tales of the silver queen\u2019s promiscuity. <b>\u201cOne of her captains comes of a line where the men have foot-long members,\u201d he told them, \u201cbut even he\u2019s not big enough for her. She rode with the Dothraki and grew accustomed to being fucked by stallions, so now no man can fill her.\u201d And Books</b>, the clever Volantene swordsman who always seemed to have his nose poked in some crumbly scroll, <b>thought the dragon queen both murderous and mad. \u201cHer khal killed her brother to make her queen. Then she killed her khal to make herself khaleesi. She practices blood sacrifice, lies as easily as she breathes, turns against her own on a whim. She\u2019s broken truces, tortured envoys \u2026 her father was mad too. It runs in the blood.\u201d </b>\u2013 The Windblown, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>So all those people spreading the tales that Dany is monstrous and mad are actually people who have their own agenda, people that benefit from the status quo that Dany is trying to destroy. To me, it seems that GRRM is trying to explore how people that fight against the status quo and women that defy society are vilified. Making Dany mad accomplishes nothing in the story, it would only prove the villains right (something I don\u2019t believe GRRM would do).</p><p><b>3) </b>Another important theme related to madness is stigma. The main characters in ASOIAF have to face many stigmas: Tyrion is seen as a monster for being a dwarf, Bran is seen as useless, Arya is stigmatized for not conforming to gender norms, and Jon is a bastard. Dany also has to deal with stigma, and aside from the fact that she defies gender norms, there\u2019s the fact that she\u2019s the Mad King\u2019s daughter. This affects both how the people around her see her, and how she sees herself. As seen above, people judge her because of her father:</p><blockquote><p>\u201c[\u2026] She\u2019s broken truces, tortured envoys \u2026<b> her father was mad too. It runs in the blood.\u201d</b> \u2013 The Windblown, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>And in Westeros, there are already people calling her mad when they first hear of her:</p><blockquote><p><b>\u201cAs mad as her father,\u201d</b> declared Lord Mace Tyrell. - Epilogue, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>And, of course, there\u2019s Ser Barristan, who came to her wary and looking for signs of madness. This makes Dany question herself, worrying if she has the \u201ctaint\u201d:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cYou have brought freedom as well,\u201d Missandei pointed out.</p><p>\u201cFreedom to starve?\u201d asked Dany sharply. \u201cFreedom to die? Am I a dragon, or a harpy?\u201d <b>Am I mad? Do I have the taint? </b>- Daenerys VI ASOS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A shadow. A memory. No one. <b>She was the blood of the dragon, but Ser Barristan had warned her that in that blood there was a taint. Could I be going mad? They had called her father mad, once.</b> - Daenerys II ADWD</p></blockquote><p>This means that Dany\u2019s actions are subject to much more scrutiny by herself and others, and the story is trying to explore how the stigma impacts her life, her perceptions of herself, and other people\u2019s perception of her. But as happens to other characters that suffer stigma, I don\u2019t think the point of the story is to prove society right.</p><p>So I don\u2019t think Dany would ever go mad in the books. I think it\u2019s possible that she\u2019ll destroy King\u2019s Landing by accident (because the fact that her father has hidden wildfire in the city is a Chekhov\u2019s gun), but I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll go mad or evil (I wrote about the possibility of Dany turning into a villain <b><a href=\"https://rainhadaenerys.tumblr.com/post/182459462677/danys-story-is-the-opposite-of-hero-turns#notes\">HERE</a></b>), and I don\u2019t think she would ever destroy King\u2019s Landing on purpose. There\u2019s really no reason to think that she\u2019s mad: visions and prophetic dreams are magic, not madness; and her hallucinations are both a literary device and a consequence of being weak from all that Dany endured in the Dothraki sea. And looking at the themes regarding madness in her story, making Dany mad makes each of them pointless. I don\u2019t think the point of this story is to prove that slavers were right all along, that children are fated to be like their parents, or that women are crazy. And the theme of madness and greatness is about people\u2019s perceptions of what we call \u201cmadness\u201d and what we call \u201cgreatness\u201d, and how the same actions can be seen as either mad or great. It\u2019s not about how Targaryens are genetically determined to be either mad or great. (You can read more about what madness means in Dany\u2019s story <b><a href=\"https://rainhadaenerys.tumblr.com/post/184880550852/daenerys-and-magical-thinking#notes\">HERE</a></b> and <b><a href=\"https://rainhadaenerys.tumblr.com/post/184117823147/no-he-cannot-have-my-son-she-would-not-weep\">HERE</a></b>).</p><p>Finally, let me just give you a more personal opinion on this mad queen debate. I think the mad queen theory is so popular because it conveniently erases a female protagonist and gets her out of the way for the other heroes to shine. Which is exactly what happened in the show. So I hope GRRM is better than that.</p>",
        "answer_abstract": "<p>\n\nThe question &ldquo;what do the books hint at for her destiny?&rdquo; is rather broad. Many things could be a hint of her endgame, and to be quite honest, I don&rsquo;t think the books give us a clear idea of what Dany&rsquo;s endgame is. As a Dany fan that wants to see her succeed, I can give you a list of reasons to why I think she&rsquo;ll survive.

I also want to talk about how the idea of madness impacts thematically in Dany\u2019s story.</p>[[MORE]]<p>There are different arguments that are used in favor of the Mad Queen theory. Some of them have some basis in the books, and some of them are completely baseless. The main arguments I see in favor of the mad queen theory are: that Dany is violent; that Dany is paranoid; and that Dany has hallucinations. So let\u2019s talk about each of them.<b><br></b></p><p><b>\u201cDany is violent, therefore, she\u2019s mad\u201d</b></p><p>I think this argument fails on different levels.</p><p>First, because violence is not indication of madness. A person can be violent and not be mentally ill, and a person can be mentally ill and not be violent. In the books, we see many characters being violent, from Jon Snow to Tywin Lannister, and yet no one ever says they\u2019re insane. It always goes back to sexism: a woman showing any emotion or anger? Oh, must be madness! So this argument is bullshit.</p><p>Second, because Dany\u2019s supposed violence is always highly exaggerated in the fandom. What are her moments of violence? Well, Dany conquers cities to free slaves. Is that violence bad? I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t see any other way for Dany to free the slaves. It\u2019s not like the masters will just decide to free the slaves if Dany asks them politely. And Dany using force and military power to conquer the slave cities is no different from characters like Stannis or Robb fighting in the War of the Five Kings. Actually, I would say Dany using her armies to free slaves is a much more noble goal than most of the other characters we see in ASOIAF. And yet you don\u2019t see people calling them mad, only Dany. In my opinion, there are only two moments in which we could say that Dany is violent and acts impulsively because of anger in the books: when she orders the crucifixions of the slavers and when she allows torture. And yet, there\u2019s nothing here to say that Dany is mad. Dany crucified slavers because the slavers crucified children. And she didn\u2019t choose random people to crucify: she specifically asked for the leaders of Meereen, and she told them to choose amongst themselves who would be crucified. Was it right? No. Was it justice? No. But I think Dany\u2019s reaction is pretty understandable given that Dany just witnessed the brutal crucifixion of children by the Meereenese masters just to taunt her, and it\u2019s also understandable because Dany never had a good role model to teach her about justice (she was raised by Viserys, so it\u2019s amazing that Dany turned out to be such a good person). Dany is trying to do what\u2019s right, but Dany doesn\u2019t always know what\u2019s right. About Dany allowing torture, again, this is not outside what\u2019s accepted in their society. Torture is considered to be a legitimate means of obtaining information, and Dany is a product of her society. There\u2019s also the fact that Dany was also being manipulated by the Shavepate. Besides, Dany does forbid torture later when she realizes it\u2019s ineffective.</p><p>So Dany only has TWO darker moments in the books (she has other flaws, but these are, in my opinion, the only really bad moments for her character), and both are understandable given her upbringing and the society she lives in. So the people calling her violent are just applying double standards. This is even more clear when you consider that there are other characters that also have impulsive moments in which they act out of anger. One example is Jon Snow, who also loses his temper in different moments:</p><blockquote><p>And then he heard the laughter, sharp and cruel as a whip, and the voice of Ser Alliser Thorne. <b>\u201cNot only a bastard, but a traitor\u2019s bastard,\u201d</b> he was telling the men around him.</p><p><b>In the blink of an eye, Jon had vaulted onto the table, dagger in his hand. </b>Pyp made a grab for him, but he wrenched his leg away, and then he was sprinting down the table and kicking the bowl from Ser Alliser\u2019s hand. Stew went flying everywhere, spattering the brothers. Thorne recoiled. People were shouting, but Jon Snow did not hear them. <b>He lunged at Ser Alliser\u2019s face with the dagger, slashing at those cold onyx eyes,</b> but Sam threw himself between them and before Jon could get around him, Pyp was on his back clinging like a monkey, and Grenn was grabbing his arm while Toad wrenched the knife from his fingers. - Jon VII AGOT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>He was almost ready to lower his blade and call a halt when Emmett feinted low and came in over his shield with a savage forehand slash that caught Jon on the temple. He staggered, his helm and head both ringing from the force of the blow. For half a heartbeat the world beyond his eyeslit was a blur.</p><p>And then the years were gone, and he was back at Winterfell once more, wearing a quilted leather coat in place of mail and plate. His sword was made of wood, and it was Robb who stood facing him, not Iron Emmett.</p><p>[\u2026]</p><p>That morning he called it first. \u201cI\u2019m Lord of Winterfell!\u201d he cried, as he had a hundred times before. Only this time, this time, Robb had answered, \u201cYou can\u2019t be Lord of Winterfell, you\u2019re bastard-born. My lady mother says you can\u2019t ever be the Lord of Winterfell.\u201d</p><p>I thought I had forgotten that. Jon could taste blood in his mouth, from the blow he\u2019d taken.</p><p><b>In the end Halder and Horse had to pull him away from Iron Emmett, one man on either arm. The ranger sat on the ground dazed, his shield half in splinters, the visor of his helm knocked askew, and his sword six yards away. \u201cJon, enough,\u201d Halder was shouting, \u201che\u2019s down, you disarmed him. Enough!\u201d</b></p><p><b>No. Not enough. Never enough.</b> Jon let his sword drop. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he muttered. \u201cEmmett, are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>Iron Emmett pulled his battered helm off. \u201cWas there some part of yield you could not comprehend, Lord Snow?\u201d It was said amiably, though. Emmett was an amiable man, and he loved the song of swords. \u201cWarrior defend me,\u201d he groaned, \u201cnow I know how Qhorin Halfhand must have felt.\u201d - Jon XII ASOS</p></blockquote><p>Jon loses his temper and tries to kill someone over an insult. He also completely loses his senses and starts mindlessly beating a guy. Dany never had any moment in which she tried to kill someone over an insult (actually, there are moments in which people spit in her face and try to attack her, and she still forgives them), and Dany never loses her senses in anger. And yet, I don\u2019t see people calling Jon mad for losing his temper and being violent. These are double standards (and if you want to know more about darker Jon moments in the books, you can read my meta <b><a href=\"https://rainhadaenerys.tumblr.com/post/184810432287/hi-ive-only-read-the-first-book-and-that-was#notes\">HERE</a></b>). If you don\u2019t think Jon is \u201cmad\u201d for being violent or losing his temper, you shouldn\u2019t think this of Dany either (and like I said, violence is not the same thing as madness).</p><p><b>\u201cDany is paranoid\u201d</b></p><p>This is an argument that I completely disagree with and that I think is completely baseless. Dany is not a paranoid person. She knows that she needs to trust people and work with them, and that otherwise, she would end up alienating everyone that could help her:</p><blockquote><p><b>\u201cIt seems to me that a queen who trusts no one is as foolish as a queen who trusts everyone.</b> Every man I take into my service is a risk, I understand that, but how am I to win the Seven Kingdoms without such risks? Am I to conquer Westeros with one exile knight and three Dothraki bloodriders?\u201d \u2013 Daenerys I ASOS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cI am glad you came to me. It is good to see your face again, my friend.\u201d<b> I will not trust you, but I need you. I need your Thirteen, I need your ships, I need your trade.</b> - Daenerys III ADWD</p></blockquote><p>People in the fandom sometimes say that Dany is paranoid about prophecies. But this isn\u2019t true either. Dany receives several prophecies throughout the story, from Mirri Maz Duur, from the House of the Undying, and from Quaithe. And some of these prophecies warn her about some dangers: the Undying tell Dany that she\u2019ll know three treasons, one for blood, one for money and one for love. And Quaithe tells Dany to not trust many people: kraken and dark flame, lion and griffin, the sun\u2019s son and the mummer\u2019s dragons. So it would be understandable if she started to act a little paranoid. But she doesn\u2019t. Dany suspects many people, but she continues to accept them in her service:</p><blockquote><p>There were times when Dany wondered if that razor might not be better saved for Reznak\u2019s throat. He was a useful man, but she liked him little and trusted him less. <b>The Undying of Qarth had told her she would be thrice betrayed.</b> Mirri Maz Duur had been the first, Ser Jorah the second. <b>Would Reznak be the third? The Shavepate? Daario? Or will it be someone I would never suspect, Ser Barristan or Grey Worm or Missandei? </b>\u2013 Daenerys I ADWD</p></blockquote><p>As we can see, Dany distrusts all of these people. But she still keeps them in her service, not letting her doubts consume her.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cIt has been so long,\u201d she had said to Ser Barristan, just yesterday. <b>\u201cWhat if Daario has betrayed me and gone over to my enemies?\u201d Three treasons will you know.</b> \u201cWhat if he met another woman, some princess of the Lhazarene?\u201d \u2013 Daenerys II ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Dany thinks that Daario might betray her. She thinks sellswords are treacherous, but she still sleeps with him.</p><p>Dany constantly thinks that prophecies are treacherous, and that she should not let them dictate her decisions:</p><blockquote><p><b>When Reznak and Skahaz appeared, she found herself looking at them askance, mindful of the three treasons. Beware the perfumed seneschal.</b> She sniffed suspiciously at Reznak mo Reznak. I could command the Shavepate to arrest him and put him to the question. Would that forestall the prophecy? Or would some other betrayer take his place? <b>Prophecies are treacherous, she reminded herself, and Reznak may be no more than he appears.</b> \u2013 Daenerys II ADWD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n\nHis bitterness dismayed her, so much so that <b>Dany found herself wondering if the grizzled Pentoshi could be one of her three betrayers. No, he is only an old man, far from home and sick at heart.</b> - Daenerys V ADWD\u00a0</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>He shall be the stallion that mounts the world. Dany knew how it went with prophecies. They were made of words, and words were wind.</b>\u00a0- Daenerys IV ADWD</p></blockquote><p>And even when Quentyn comes to her, she doesn\u2019t do anything about the prophecy, even though she knows that he\u2019s the sun\u2019s son:</p><blockquote><p><b>The sun\u2019s son. A shiver went through her.</b> \u201cShadows and whispers.\u201d What else had Quaithe said? The pale mare and the sun\u2019s son. There was a lion in it too, and a dragon. Or am I the dragon? \u201cBeware the perfumed seneschal.\u201d That she remembered. <b>\u201cDreams and prophecies. Why must they always be in riddles?</b> I hate this. Oh, leave me, ser. Tomorrow is my wedding day.\u201d \u2013 Daenerys VII</p></blockquote><p>So I don\u2019t really agree with the assessment that Dany is paranoid about prophecies. She worries about the prophecies, but she never lets them influence her actions and judgement, and is very aware that prophecies are treacherous. And actually, Dany\u2019s behaviour towards prophecy is written as a foil to another character: Cersei. Cersei is the one that is really paranoid. She sees enemies in every shadow, is obsessed with the idea that Tyrion is hiding everywhere and is the cause of all her problems. She alienates her allies and refuses to trust anyone. And she\u2019s terrified of the Younger More Beautiful Queen prophecy and tries to do everything to avoid it (in contrast to Dany, who doesn\u2019t do anything and reminds herself that prophecies are treacherous). GRRM has said that Dany and Cersei are meant as foils, and this is one of the main contrasts between them. So Dany is written exactly to contrast Cersei\u2019s attitude - she\u2019s not paranoid like Cersei, she\u2019s the opposite.</p><p><b>\u201cDany has hallucinations\u201d</b></p><p>In the books, Dany has some visions that people sometimes use to argue that she\u2019s mad. So let\u2019s look at the different moments that I imagine that mad queen theorists use to \u201cprove\u201d that Dany is mad:</p><p><b>1)</b> In the first book, Dany has three prophetic dreams in which she dreams with dragons. These dreams (and also Mirri Maz Duur\u2019s lessons about how only death pays for life) give her the idea of stepping into the fire, and make her confident that she can walk into the fire without dying and hatch dragons.</p><p><b>2)</b> In the second book, when she is in Qarth, Dany meets a woman named Quaithe, who is a shadowbinder from Asshai. Qhaithe gives her warnings and prophecies. But in the next books, Dany starts to sometimes see and talk to Quaithe in the middle of the night, and no one else seems to see or hear Quaithe:</p><blockquote><p>She is standing over me. <b>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Dany peered into the darkness. She thought she could see a shadow, the faintest outline of a shape.</b> \u201cWhat do you want to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember. To go north, you must journey south. To reach the west, you must go east. To go forward you must go back, and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow.\u201d</p><p><b>\u201cQuaithe?\u201d</b> Dany sprung from the bed and threw open the door. Pale yellow lantern light flooded the cabin, and Irri and Jhiqui sat up sleepily. \u201cKhaleesi?\u201d murmured Jhiqui, rubbing her eyes. <b>Viserion woke and opened his jaws, and a puff of flame brightened even the darkest corners. There was no sign of a woman in a red lacquer mask. \u201cKhaleesi, are you unwell?\u201d asked Jhiqui.</b></p><p><b>\u201cA dream.\u201d Dany shook her head. \u201cI dreamed a dream, no more.</b> Go back to sleep. All of us, go back to sleep.\u201d Yet try as she might, sleep would not come again. - Daenerys III ASOS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>\u201cQuaithe? Am I dreaming?\u201d</b> She pinched her ear and winced at the pain. \u201cI dreamt of you on Balerion, when first we came to Astapor.\u201d</p><p><b>\u201cYou did not dream. Then or now.\u201d</b></p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here? <b>How did you get past my guards?\u201d</b></p><p><b>\u201cI came another way. Your guards never saw me.\u201d</b></p><p><b>\u201cIf I call out, they will kill you.\u201d</b></p><p><b>\u201cThey will swear to you that I am not here.\u201d</b></p><p><b>\u201cAre you here?\u201d</b></p><p><b>\u201cNo.</b> [\u2026]\u201d - Daenerys II ADWD</p></blockquote><p><b>3)</b> Finally, there\u2019s Dany last chapter in ADWD. In this chapter, Dany \u201ctalks with her ghosts\u201d. She\u2019s walking alone in the Dothraki sea, and yet she sees and talks to Jorah, Quaithe, Viserys, and she even listens to the grass talking:</p><blockquote><p>Sometimes she heard birds singing. The sound made her belly rumble, but she had no nets to snare them with, and so far she had not come on any nests. Once I dreamed of flying, she thought, and now I\u2019ve flown, and dream of stealing eggs. That made her laugh. <b>\u201cMen are mad and gods are madder,\u201d she told the grass, and the grass murmured its agreement. </b>- Daenerys X ADWD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>\u201cI am the blood of the dragon,\u201d she told the grass, aloud.</b></p><p><b>Once, the grass whispered back</b>, until you chained your dragons in the dark.</p><p>\u201cDrogon killed a little girl. Her name was \u2026 her name \u2026\u201d Dany could not recall the child\u2019s name. That made her so sad that she would have cried if all her tears had not been burned away. \u201cI will never have a little girl. I was the Mother of Dragons.\u201d</p><p><b>Aye, the grass said, but you turned against your children. </b>- Daenerys X ADWD</p></blockquote><p>So\u2026 are these moments proof that Dany is mad? I don\u2019t think so at all. Let me explain why in each case:</p><p><b>1)</b> Dany doesn\u2019t have dragon dreams because she\u2019s mad. She has dragon dreams because they are truly prophetic dreams. And the proof we have of this is that they came true. Dany was right in believing that if she walked into the fire, she would survive. If this world was a world without any magic, and Dany started to have these dreams and think that they are prophetic, then I could understand the argument that she\u2019s mad. But this world has magic. Dany believing in magic and in prophetic dreams is not something that makes her mad, because magic does exist. If we start saying that Dany is \u201cmad\u201d, because she has prophetic dreams, then Bran, Jon, and Arya are all mad, because they all have wolf dreams, and all of them believe their wolf dreams to be real. If Dany\u2019s prophetic dreams and her actions to follow what her dreams tell her to do are a sign of madness, then Bran and Jojen are mad, because they too look up to prophetic dreams to guide them. So trying to say that Dany is mad for believing in magic in a world in which magic does exist, is nonsense in my opinion.</p><p><b>2)</b> Dany\u2019s encounters with Quaithe are the same thing. One could wonder: could Dany\u2019s talks with Quaithe be just a product of her mind? After all, no one else seems to see or hear Quaithe, only Dany. And Dany herself wonders, after Quaithe comes to her in Meereen, if she\u2019s mad:</p><blockquote><p><b>\u201cYour Grace?\u201d</b> Missandei stood in the door of the queen\u2019s bedchamber, a lantern in her hand. <b>\u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d</b></p><p>Dany glanced back toward the persimmon tree. There was no woman there. No hooded robe, no lacquer mask, no Quaithe.</p><p>A shadow. A memory. No one. <b>She was the blood of the dragon, but Ser Barristan had warned her that in that blood there was a taint. Could I be going mad? They had called her father mad, once.</b>\u00a0- Daenerys II ADWD</p></blockquote><p>So I see how people could use this to say Dany is mad. However, we have proof that Dany is not seeing things. Quaithe is real, not a product of her mind. And what is this proof? Well, the first time Quaithe appears to Dany in the middle of the night, Quaithe repeats to Dany something she had already told Dany in person, when she was in Qarth:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cRemember. To go north, you must journey south. To reach the west, you must go east. To go forward you must go back, and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow.\u201d - Daenerys III ASOS</p></blockquote><p>So this could very well be a product of Dany\u2019s mind, it could be her mind remembering something Quaithe said and creating some hallucination based on it. However, the second time Quaithe comes to Dany, she tells Dany something entirely new:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cNo. Hear me, Daenerys Targaryen. The glass candles are burning. Soon comes the pale mare, and after her the others. Kraken and dark flame, lion and griffin, the sun\u2019s son and the mummer\u2019s dragon. Trust none of them. Remember the Undying. Beware the perfumed seneschal.\u201d - Daenerys II ADWD</p></blockquote><p>This is not something Quaithe told Dany before. This can\u2019t be a memory that her mind turned into a hallucination. This is not even something that Dany\u2019s mind could have produced, because Dany knows nothing about a pale mare, griffin, dark flame, or any of that. This is a prophecy. And we get confirmation later that this was indeed real, Dany was not imagining Quaithe. Because later in the books, the prophecy starts to come true: the pale mare comes, the sun\u2019s son comes, and we know that kraken, dark flame, lion and mummer\u2019s dragon are all true and are all going to cross Dany\u2019s path at some point. So Dany\u2019s talks with Quaithe were not a product of her mind: they were real, and Quaithe was giving Dany real prophecies. And we have a magic device established in the lore that could explain very well how Quaithe was able to communicate with Dany: glass candles. Quaithe even mentions them:\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo. Hear me, Daenerys Targaryen. <b>The glass candles are burning.</b>\u201d So Dany was not seeing or hearing things. Quaithe was actually talking to her.</p><p><b>3)</b> Finally, let\u2019s talk about Dany\u2019s last chapter in ADWD. In this chapter, Dany was supposedly having hallucinations and this supposedly proves she\u2019s mad. However, I have two problems with this interpretation. First, because Dany was in a terrible physical condition: she had suffered sun exposure, she had walked throughout the entire day, she was hungry, tired and weak, she had eaten poisoned berries, and she had just had a miscarriage. Having hallucinations in her condition has nothing to do with madness, it\u2019s very much normal. And second, because if I\u2019m going to be quite honest, I never interpreted Dany\u2019s last chapter as her having hallucinations. In my opinion, Dany talking with her ghosts or hearing the grass is simply a literary device. GRRM wrote Dany\u2019s last chapter as a huge solitary reflexion. She\u2019s all by herself thinking about her life and her choices. He could have written this chapter as a huge monologue in which Dany ponders about things. But that would have been really tiresome. By writing Dany talking with her ghosts, GRRM makes the chapter more dynamic, more interesting, less boring. It gives us dialogue instead of a monologue. So the choice of having Dany talk with her ghosts is simply a literary device. When I read that chapter, I never really interpreted as Dany having hallucinations. When Dany talks with Viserys, I don\u2019t get the impression that Dany truly believes that Viserys is in front of her: she\u2019s simply projecting him in her mind, and imagining the things he would have said. And the same is true of the other people Dany talks to. Dany doesn\u2019t believe those people are real, she\u2019s simply using a projection of them to reflect about her choices (though, as I pointed out, if she was indeed having hallucinations, it\u2019s nothing that indicates madness, given her physical condition).</p><p>So, to summarize why Daenerys is not mad: Her dreams are prophetic and come from magic, they are not a sign of madness. Her talks with Quaithe are actually real. And her hallucinations in the Dothraki sea are, in my opinion, a literary device, but anyway, if Dany is indeed having hallucinations, it\u2019s something to be expected given her physical condition. Finally, I need to say that in the books, Dany is a very level-headed person, who occasionally loses her temper. It\u2019s impossible for me to quote the entire books here, but reading them, I see no signs of madness. And we have even more proof that Dany isn\u2019t mad through what Ser Barristan Selmy says:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWhy ask for truth,\u201d Ser Barristan said softly, \u201cif you close your ears to it?\u201d He hesitated, then continued. <b>\u201cI told you before that I used a false name so the Lannisters would not know that I\u2019d joined you. That was less than half of it, Your Grace. The truth is, I wanted to watch you for a time before pledging you my sword. To make certain that you were not \u2026\u201d</b></p><p>\u2026 my father\u2019s daughter?\u201c If she was not her father\u2019s daughter, who was she?</p><p><b>\u201d\u2026 mad,\u201c he finished. \u201cBut I see no taint in you.\u201d</b></p><p>[\u2026]<b> \u201cSo I am a coin in the hands of some god, is that what you are saying, ser?\u201d</b><br></p><p><b>\u201cNo,\u201d Ser Barristan replied. \u201cYou are the trueborn heir of Westeros.</b> To the end of my days I shall remain your faithful knight, should you find me worthy to bear a sword again. If not, I am content to serve Strong Belwas as his squire.\u201d</p><p><b>\u201cWhat if I decide you\u2019re only worthy to be my fool?\u201d Dany asked scornfully. \u201cOr perhaps my cook?\u201d</b></p><p><b>\u201cI would be honored, Your Grace,\u201d Selmy said with quiet dignity.</b>\u00a0- Daenerys VI ASOS</p></blockquote><p>Ser Barristan knew her father. Of all people, he would know if Dany was mad, and if she was in any way like Aerys. He spends months hiding his identity and observing Dany just to see if she shows any signs of madness, and in the end, he is so sure that she isn\u2019t mad, and that she is a worthy queen to follow, that he even says he would be honored to be her cook. That\u2019s how much he trusts Dany. I think his judgement of her is yet another reason as for why the mad queen Dany theory doesn\u2019t really have a lot of basis.</p><p><b>THEMATIC IMPORTANCE OF MADNESS IN DANY\u2019S STORY</b></p><p>However, even though I don\u2019t think Dany is mad at all, I do think that \u201cmadness\u201d is an important part of her story, and I think the themes in her story are just another proof of why Dany won\u2019t go mad.</p><p><b>1)</b> One of the discussions involving madness is the madness vs greatness debate. We have this quote about the coin that everyone loves bringing up:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI am no maester to quote history at you, Your Grace. Swords have been my life, not books. <b>But every child knows that the Targaryens have always danced too close to madness. Your father was not the first. King Jaehaerys once told me that madness and greatness are two sides of the same coin. Every time a new Targaryen is born, he said, the gods toss the coin in the air and the world holds its breath to see how it will land.\u201d </b>- Daenerys VI ASOS</p></blockquote><p>But I think people really miss the point of this quote. This quote isn\u2019t saying that half the Targaryens are mad and half are not (in fact, <b><a href=\"https://tomakeitbeautifultolive.tumblr.com/post/185032357463/what-bothers-me-is-the-saying-that-when-a\">few Targaryens were indeed mad</a></b>). What it\u2019s talking about is how madness and greatness are two sides of the same coin. This means that to be great, you also have to be \u201cmad\u201d, in a way. When Dany is about to walk into Drogo\u2019s funeral pyre, this is what she tells Mirri Maz Duur:</p><blockquote><p>As she climbed down off the pyre, she noticed Mirri Maz Duur watching her. \u201cYou are mad,\u201d the godswife said hoarsely.</p><p><b>\u201cIs it so far from madness to wisdom?\u201d Dany asked.</b> - Daenerys X AGOT</p></blockquote><p>And this is a running theme in Dany\u2019s story, because if you think about it, part of what she does can indeed be seen as mad from the outside. Dany walked into a pyre! For anyone looking, this was pretty crazy! But it was also great. Because if Dany had not decided to commit this \u201cmadness\u201d, she wouldn\u2019t have hatched dragons either. To be great, Dany had to take a huge risk, she had to have a lot of courage and confidence. Most people would never take such a huge risk. Most people would consider taking a risk this huge to be madness. But Dany doesn\u2019t. She\u2019s the kind of person that is willing to go to extreme lengths to achieve something, who\u2019s willing to take risks to accomplish things that others consider impossible. That\u2019s where the madness vs greatness theme comes from, because to be great, you have to do things that most people would consider impossible (and because they consider it impossible, they call it madness). Other moment in which Dany can be considered mad is when she fights against Drogon with a whip. Many people would call this madness, while others would call it courage. And this theme can also be seen in Dany\u2019s fight against slavery. Most people would consider fighting a continent wide system madness, because it looks impossible. And yet, Dany does it anyway. Because she\u2019s the kind of person who is willing to do anything, no matter how hard it is. What other people call madness, is what makes her great.</p><p><b>2)</b> Related to this topic, Dany\u2019s defiances of society\u2019s norms is also something that leads people to call her mad. Her enemies call her mad because she dared to try to end slavery, and they also call her mad because she\u2019s a woman in a patriarchal society that dares to defy gender norms:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI have a gift for you as well.\u201d She slammed the chest shut. \u201cThree days. On the morning of the third day, send out your slaves. All of them. Every man, woman, and child shall be given a weapon, and as much food, clothing, coin, and goods as he or she can carry. These they shall be allowed to choose freely from among their masters\u2019 possessions, as payment for their years of servitude. When all the slaves have departed, you will open your gates and allow my Unsullied to enter and search your city, to make certain none remain in bondage. If you do this, Yunkai will not be burned or plundered, and none of your people shall be molested. The Wise Masters will have the peace they desire, and will have proved themselves wise indeed. What say you?\u201d</p><p><b>\u201cI say, you are mad.\u201d</b> - Daenerys IV ASOS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cWhen I went to the Hall of a Thousand Thrones to beg the Pureborn for your life, I said that you were no more than a child,\u201d Xaro went on, \u201cbut Egon Emeros the Exquisite rose and said, <b>\u2018She is a foolish child, mad and heedless and too dangerous to live.\u2019</b> When your dragons were small they were a wonder. Grown, they are death and devastation, a flaming sword above the world.\u201d He wiped away the tears. \u201cI should have slain you in Qarth.\u201d - Daenerys III ADWD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The more Quentyn heard of Daenerys Targaryen, the more he feared that meeting. <b>The Yunkai'i claimed that she fed her dragons on human flesh and bathed in the blood of virgins to keep her skin smooth and supple.</b> Beans laughed at that but relished the tales of the silver queen\u2019s promiscuity. <b>\u201cOne of her captains comes of a line where the men have foot-long members,\u201d he told them, \u201cbut even he\u2019s not big enough for her. She rode with the Dothraki and grew accustomed to being fucked by stallions, so now no man can fill her.\u201d And Books</b>, the clever Volantene swordsman who always seemed to have his nose poked in some crumbly scroll, <b>thought the dragon queen both murderous and mad. \u201cHer khal killed her brother to make her queen. Then she killed her khal to make herself khaleesi. She practices blood sacrifice, lies as easily as she breathes, turns against her own on a whim. She\u2019s broken truces, tortured envoys \u2026 her father was mad too. It runs in the blood.\u201d </b>\u2013 The Windblown, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>So all those people spreading the tales that Dany is monstrous and mad are actually people who have their own agenda, people that benefit from the status quo that Dany is trying to destroy. To me, it seems that GRRM is trying to explore how people that fight against the status quo and women that defy society are vilified. Making Dany mad accomplishes nothing in the story, it would only prove the villains right (something I don\u2019t believe GRRM would do).</p><p><b>3) </b>Another important theme related to madness is stigma. The main characters in ASOIAF have to face many stigmas: Tyrion is seen as a monster for being a dwarf, Bran is seen as useless, Arya is stigmatized for not conforming to gender norms, and Jon is a bastard. Dany also has to deal with stigma, and aside from the fact that she defies gender norms, there\u2019s the fact that she\u2019s the Mad King\u2019s daughter. This affects both how the people around her see her, and how she sees herself. As seen above, people judge her because of her father:</p><blockquote><p>\u201c[\u2026] She\u2019s broken truces, tortured envoys \u2026<b> her father was mad too. It runs in the blood.\u201d</b> \u2013 The Windblown, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>And in Westeros, there are already people calling her mad when they first hear of her:</p><blockquote><p><b>\u201cAs mad as her father,\u201d</b> declared Lord Mace Tyrell. - Epilogue, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>And, of course, there\u2019s Ser Barristan, who came to her wary and looking for signs of madness. This makes Dany question herself, worrying if she has the \u201ctaint\u201d:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cYou have brought freedom as well,\u201d Missandei pointed out.</p><p>\u201cFreedom to starve?\u201d asked Dany sharply. \u201cFreedom to die? Am I a dragon, or a harpy?\u201d <b>Am I mad? Do I have the taint? </b>- Daenerys VI ASOS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A shadow. A memory. No one. <b>She was the blood of the dragon, but Ser Barristan had warned her that in that blood there was a taint. Could I be going mad? They had called her father mad, once.</b> - Daenerys II ADWD</p></blockquote><p>This means that Dany\u2019s actions are subject to much more scrutiny by herself and others, and the story is trying to explore how the stigma impacts her life, her perceptions of herself, and other people\u2019s perception of her. But as happens to other characters that suffer stigma, I don\u2019t think the point of the story is to prove society right.</p><p>So I don\u2019t think Dany would ever go mad in the books. I think it\u2019s possible that she\u2019ll destroy King\u2019s Landing by accident (because the fact that her father has hidden wildfire in the city is a Chekhov\u2019s gun), but I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll go mad or evil (I wrote about the possibility of Dany turning into a villain <b><a href=\"https://rainhadaenerys.tumblr.com/post/182459462677/danys-story-is-the-opposite-of-hero-turns#notes\">HERE</a></b>), and I don\u2019t think she would ever destroy King\u2019s Landing on purpose. There\u2019s really no reason to think that she\u2019s mad: visions and prophetic dreams are magic, not madness; and her hallucinations are both a literary device and a consequence of being weak from all that Dany endured in the Dothraki sea. And looking at the themes regarding madness in her story, making Dany mad makes each of them pointless. I don\u2019t think the point of this story is to prove that slavers were right all along, that children are fated to be like their parents, or that women are crazy. And the theme of madness and greatness is about people\u2019s perceptions of what we call \u201cmadness\u201d and what we call \u201cgreatness\u201d, and how the same actions can be seen as either mad or great. It\u2019s not about how Targaryens are genetically determined to be either mad or great. (You can read more about what madness means in Dany\u2019s story <b><a href=\"https://rainhadaenerys.tumblr.com/post/184880550852/daenerys-and-magical-thinking#notes\">HERE</a></b> and <b><a href=\"https://rainhadaenerys.tumblr.com/post/184117823147/no-he-cannot-have-my-son-she-would-not-weep\">HERE</a></b>).</p><p>Finally, let me just give you a more personal opinion on this mad queen debate. I think the mad queen theory is so popular because it conveniently erases a female protagonist and gets her out of the way for the other heroes to shine. Which is exactly what happened in the show. So I hope GRRM is better than that.</p>",

Many things could be a hint of her endgame, and to be quite honest, I don\u2019t think the books give us a clear idea of what Dany\u2019s endgame is. As a Dany fan that wants to see her succeed, I can give you a list of reasons to why I think she\u2019ll survive. But there are many other meta writers out there that will also find many hints that Dany will die, or even that she\u2019ll become mad or evil (and I vehemently disagree with her ever being evil or the mad queen). So I\u2019m going to focus on answering about the \u201cMad Queen Dany\u201d theory and why I don\u2019t think this is her endgame (if you have a more specific question about what I think about her endgame other than Mad Queen Dany, please feel free to send another ask). I also want to talk about how the idea of madness impacts thematically in Dany\u2019s story.</p>[[MORE]]<p>There are different arguments that are used in favor of the Mad Queen theory. Some of them have some basis in the books, and some of them are completely baseless. The main arguments I see in favor of the mad queen theory are: that Dany is violent; that Dany is paranoid; and that Dany has hallucinations. So let\u2019s talk about each of them.<b><br></b></p><p><b>\u201cDany is violent, therefore, she\u2019s mad\u201d</b></p><p>I think this argument fails on different levels.</p><p>First, because violence is not indication of madness. A person can be violent and not be mentally ill, and a person can be mentally ill and not be violent. In the books, we see many characters being violent, from Jon Snow to Tywin Lannister, and yet no one ever says they\u2019re insane. It always goes back to sexism: a woman showing any emotion or anger? Oh, must be madness! So this argument is bullshit.</p><p>Second, because Dany\u2019s supposed violence is always highly exaggerated in the fandom. What are her moments of violence? Well, Dany conquers cities to free slaves. Is that violence bad? I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t see any other way for Dany to free the slaves. It\u2019s not like the masters will just decide to free the slaves if Dany asks them politely. And Dany using force and military power to conquer the slave cities is no different from characters like Stannis or Robb fighting in the War of the Five Kings. Actually, I would say Dany using her armies to free slaves is a much more noble goal than most of the other characters we see in ASOIAF. And yet you don\u2019t see people calling them mad, only Dany. In my opinion, there are only two moments in which we could say that Dany is violent and acts impulsively because of anger in the books: when she orders the crucifixions of the slavers and when she allows torture. And yet, there\u2019s nothing here to say that Dany is mad. Dany crucified slavers because the slavers crucified children. And she didn\u2019t choose random people to crucify: she specifically asked for the leaders of Meereen, and she told them to choose amongst themselves who would be crucified. Was it right? No. Was it justice? No. But I think Dany\u2019s reaction is pretty understandable given that Dany just witnessed the brutal crucifixion of children by the Meereenese masters just to taunt her, and it\u2019s also understandable because Dany never had a good role model to teach her about justice (she was raised by Viserys, so it\u2019s amazing that Dany turned out to be such a good person). Dany is trying to do what\u2019s right, but Dany doesn\u2019t always know what\u2019s right. About Dany allowing torture, again, this is not outside what\u2019s accepted in their society. Torture is considered to be a legitimate means of obtaining information, and Dany is a product of her society. There\u2019s also the fact that Dany was also being manipulated by the Shavepate. Besides, Dany does forbid torture later when she realizes it\u2019s ineffective.</p><p>So Dany only has TWO darker moments in the books (she has other flaws, but these are, in my opinion, the only really bad moments for her character), and both are understandable given her upbringing and the society she lives in. So the people calling her violent are just applying double standards. This is even more clear when you consider that there are other characters that also have impulsive moments in which they act out of anger. One example is Jon Snow, who also loses his temper in different moments:</p><blockquote><p>And then he heard the laughter, sharp and cruel as a whip, and the voice of Ser Alliser Thorne. <b>\u201cNot only a bastard, but a traitor\u2019s bastard,\u201d</b> he was telling the men around him.</p><p><b>In the blink of an eye, Jon had vaulted onto the table, dagger in his hand. </b>Pyp made a grab for him, but he wrenched his leg away, and then he was sprinting down the table and kicking the bowl from Ser Alliser\u2019s hand. Stew went flying everywhere, spattering the brothers. Thorne recoiled. People were shouting, but Jon Snow did not hear them. <b>He lunged at Ser Alliser\u2019s face with the dagger, slashing at those cold onyx eyes,</b> but Sam threw himself between them and before Jon could get around him, Pyp was on his back clinging like a monkey, and Grenn was grabbing his arm while Toad wrenched the knife from his fingers. - Jon VII AGOT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>He was almost ready to lower his blade and call a halt when Emmett feinted low and came in over his shield with a savage forehand slash that caught Jon on the temple. He staggered, his helm and head both ringing from the force of the blow. For half a heartbeat the world beyond his eyeslit was a blur.</p><p>And then the years were gone, and he was back at Winterfell once more, wearing a quilted leather coat in place of mail and plate. His sword was made of wood, and it was Robb who stood facing him, not Iron Emmett.</p><p>[\u2026]</p><p>That morning he called it first. \u201cI\u2019m Lord of Winterfell!\u201d he cried, as he had a hundred times before. Only this time, this time, Robb had answered, \u201cYou can\u2019t be Lord of Winterfell, you\u2019re bastard-born. My lady mother says you can\u2019t ever be the Lord of Winterfell.\u201d</p><p>I thought I had forgotten that. Jon could taste blood in his mouth, from the blow he\u2019d taken.</p><p><b>In the end Halder and Horse had to pull him away from Iron Emmett, one man on either arm. The ranger sat on the ground dazed, his shield half in splinters, the visor of his helm knocked askew, and his sword six yards away. \u201cJon, enough,\u201d Halder was shouting, \u201che\u2019s down, you disarmed him. Enough!\u201d</b></p><p><b>No. Not enough. Never enough.</b> Jon let his sword drop. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he muttered. \u201cEmmett, are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>Iron Emmett pulled his battered helm off. \u201cWas there some part of yield you could not comprehend, Lord Snow?\u201d It was said amiably, though. Emmett was an amiable man, and he loved the song of swords. \u201cWarrior defend me,\u201d he groaned, \u201cnow I know how Qhorin Halfhand must have felt.\u201d - Jon XII ASOS</p></blockquote><p>Jon loses his temper and tries to kill someone over an insult. He also completely loses his senses and starts mindlessly beating a guy. Dany never had any moment in which she tried to kill someone over an insult (actually, there are moments in which people spit in her face and try to attack her, and she still forgives them), and Dany never loses her senses in anger. And yet, I don\u2019t see people calling Jon mad for losing his temper and being violent. These are double standards (and if you want to know more about darker Jon moments in the books, you can read my meta <b><a href=\"https://rainhadaenerys.tumblr.com/post/184810432287/hi-ive-only-read-the-first-book-and-that-was#notes\">HERE</a></b>). If you don\u2019t think Jon is \u201cmad\u201d for being violent or losing his temper, you shouldn\u2019t think this of Dany either (and like I said, violence is not the same thing as madness).</p><p><b>\u201cDany is paranoid\u201d</b></p><p>This is an argument that I completely disagree with and that I think is completely baseless. Dany is not a paranoid person. She knows that she needs to trust people and work with them, and that otherwise, she would end up alienating everyone that could help her:</p><blockquote><p><b>\u201cIt seems to me that a queen who trusts no one is as foolish as a queen who trusts everyone.</b> Every man I take into my service is a risk, I understand that, but how am I to win the Seven Kingdoms without such risks? Am I to conquer Westeros with one exile knight and three Dothraki bloodriders?\u201d \u2013 Daenerys I ASOS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cI am glad you came to me. It is good to see your face again, my friend.\u201d<b> I will not trust you, but I need you. I need your Thirteen, I need your ships, I need your trade.</b> - Daenerys III ADWD</p></blockquote><p>People in the fandom sometimes say that Dany is paranoid about prophecies. But this isn\u2019t true either. Dany receives several prophecies throughout the story, from Mirri Maz Duur, from the House of the Undying, and from Quaithe. And some of these prophecies warn her about some dangers: the Undying tell Dany that she\u2019ll know three treasons, one for blood, one for money and one for love. And Quaithe tells Dany to not trust many people: kraken and dark flame, lion and griffin, the sun\u2019s son and the mummer\u2019s dragons. So it would be understandable if she started to act a little paranoid. But she doesn\u2019t. Dany suspects many people, but she continues to accept them in her service:</p><blockquote><p>There were times when Dany wondered if that razor might not be better saved for Reznak\u2019s throat. He was a useful man, but she liked him little and trusted him less. <b>The Undying of Qarth had told her she would be thrice betrayed.</b> Mirri Maz Duur had been the first, Ser Jorah the second. <b>Would Reznak be the third? The Shavepate? Daario? Or will it be someone I would never suspect, Ser Barristan or Grey Worm or Missandei? </b>\u2013 Daenerys I ADWD</p></blockquote><p>As we can see, Dany distrusts all of these people. But she still keeps them in her service, not letting her doubts consume her.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cIt has been so long,\u201d she had said to Ser Barristan, just yesterday. <b>\u201cWhat if Daario has betrayed me and gone over to my enemies?\u201d Three treasons will you know.</b> \u201cWhat if he met another woman, some princess of the Lhazarene?\u201d \u2013 Daenerys II ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Dany thinks that Daario might betray her. She thinks sellswords are treacherous, but she still sleeps with him.</p><p>Dany constantly thinks that prophecies are treacherous, and that she should not let them dictate her decisions:</p><blockquote><p><b>When Reznak and Skahaz appeared, she found herself looking at them askance, mindful of the three treasons. Beware the perfumed seneschal.</b> She sniffed suspiciously at Reznak mo Reznak. I could command the Shavepate to arrest him and put him to the question. Would that forestall the prophecy? Or would some other betrayer take his place? <b>Prophecies are treacherous, she reminded herself, and Reznak may be no more than he appears.</b> \u2013 Daenerys II ADWD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n\nHis bitterness dismayed her, so much so that <b>Dany found herself wondering if the grizzled Pentoshi could be one of her three betrayers. No, he is only an old man, far from home and sick at heart.</b> - Daenerys V ADWD\u00a0</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>He shall be the stallion that mounts the world. Dany knew how it went with prophecies. They were made of words, and words were wind.</b>\u00a0- Daenerys IV ADWD</p></blockquote><p>And even when Quentyn comes to her, she doesn\u2019t do anything about the prophecy, even though she knows that he\u2019s the sun\u2019s son:</p><blockquote><p><b>The sun\u2019s son. A shiver went through her.</b> \u201cShadows and whispers.\u201d What else had Quaithe said? The pale mare and the sun\u2019s son. There was a lion in it too, and a dragon. Or am I the dragon? \u201cBeware the perfumed seneschal.\u201d That she remembered. <b>\u201cDreams and prophecies. Why must they always be in riddles?</b> I hate this. Oh, leave me, ser. Tomorrow is my wedding day.\u201d \u2013 Daenerys VII</p></blockquote><p>So I don\u2019t really agree with the assessment that Dany is paranoid about prophecies. She worries about the prophecies, but she never lets them influence her actions and judgement, and is very aware that prophecies are treacherous. And actually, Dany\u2019s behaviour towards prophecy is written as a foil to another character: Cersei. Cersei is the one that is really paranoid. She sees enemies in every shadow, is obsessed with the idea that Tyrion is hiding everywhere and is the cause of all her problems. She alienates her allies and refuses to trust anyone. And she\u2019s terrified of the Younger More Beautiful Queen prophecy and tries to do everything to avoid it (in contrast to Dany, who doesn\u2019t do anything and reminds herself that prophecies are treacherous). GRRM has said that Dany and Cersei are meant as foils, and this is one of the main contrasts between them. So Dany is written exactly to contrast Cersei\u2019s attitude - she\u2019s not paranoid like Cersei, she\u2019s the opposite.</p><p><b>\u201cDany has hallucinations\u201d</b></p><p>In the books, Dany has some visions that people sometimes use to argue that she\u2019s mad. So let\u2019s look at the different moments that I imagine that mad queen theorists use to \u201cprove\u201d that Dany is mad:</p><p><b>1)</b> In the first book, Dany has three prophetic dreams in which she dreams with dragons. These dreams (and also Mirri Maz Duur\u2019s lessons about how only death pays for life) give her the idea of stepping into the fire, and make her confident that she can walk into the fire without dying and hatch dragons.</p><p><b>2)</b> In the second book, when she is in Qarth, Dany meets a woman named Quaithe, who is a shadowbinder from Asshai. Qhaithe gives her warnings and prophecies. But in the next books, Dany starts to sometimes see and talk to Quaithe in the middle of the night, and no one else seems to see or hear Quaithe:</p><blockquote><p>She is standing over me. <b>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Dany peered into the darkness. She thought she could see a shadow, the faintest outline of a shape.</b> \u201cWhat do you want to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember. To go north, you must journey south. To reach the west, you must go east. To go forward you must go back, and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow.\u201d</p><p><b>\u201cQuaithe?\u201d</b> Dany sprung from the bed and threw open the door. Pale yellow lantern light flooded the cabin, and Irri and Jhiqui sat up sleepily. \u201cKhaleesi?\u201d murmured Jhiqui, rubbing her eyes. <b>Viserion woke and opened his jaws, and a puff of flame brightened even the darkest corners. There was no sign of a woman in a red lacquer mask. \u201cKhaleesi, are you unwell?\u201d asked Jhiqui.</b></p><p><b>\u201cA dream.\u201d Dany shook her head. \u201cI dreamed a dream, no more.</b> Go back to sleep. All of us, go back to sleep.\u201d Yet try as she might, sleep would not come again. - Daenerys III ASOS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>\u201cQuaithe? Am I dreaming?\u201d</b> She pinched her ear and winced at the pain. \u201cI dreamt of you on Balerion, when first we came to Astapor.\u201d</p><p><b>\u201cYou did not dream. Then or now.\u201d</b></p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here? <b>How did you get past my guards?\u201d</b></p><p><b>\u201cI came another way. Your guards never saw me.\u201d</b></p><p><b>\u201cIf I call out, they will kill you.\u201d</b></p><p><b>\u201cThey will swear to you that I am not here.\u201d</b></p><p><b>\u201cAre you here?\u201d</b></p><p><b>\u201cNo.</b> [\u2026]\u201d - Daenerys II ADWD</p></blockquote><p><b>3)</b> Finally, there\u2019s Dany last chapter in ADWD. In this chapter, Dany \u201ctalks with her ghosts\u201d. She\u2019s walking alone in the Dothraki sea, and yet she sees and talks to Jorah, Quaithe, Viserys, and she even listens to the grass talking:</p><blockquote><p>Sometimes she heard birds singing. The sound made her belly rumble, but she had no nets to snare them with, and so far she had not come on any nests. Once I dreamed of flying, she thought, and now I\u2019ve flown, and dream of stealing eggs. That made her laugh. <b>\u201cMen are mad and gods are madder,\u201d she told the grass, and the grass murmured its agreement. </b>- Daenerys X ADWD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>\u201cI am the blood of the dragon,\u201d she told the grass, aloud.</b></p><p><b>Once, the grass whispered back</b>, until you chained your dragons in the dark.</p><p>\u201cDrogon killed a little girl. Her name was \u2026 her name \u2026\u201d Dany could not recall the child\u2019s name. That made her so sad that she would have cried if all her tears had not been burned away. \u201cI will never have a little girl. I was the Mother of Dragons.\u201d</p><p><b>Aye, the grass said, but you turned against your children. </b>- Daenerys X ADWD</p></blockquote><p>So\u2026 are these moments proof that Dany is mad? I don\u2019t think so at all. Let me explain why in each case:</p><p><b>1)</b> Dany doesn\u2019t have dragon dreams because she\u2019s mad. She has dragon dreams because they are truly prophetic dreams. And the proof we have of this is that they came true. Dany was right in believing that if she walked into the fire, she would survive. If this world was a world without any magic, and Dany started to have these dreams and think that they are prophetic, then I could understand the argument that she\u2019s mad. But this world has magic. Dany believing in magic and in prophetic dreams is not something that makes her mad, because magic does exist. If we start saying that Dany is \u201cmad\u201d, because she has prophetic dreams, then Bran, Jon, and Arya are all mad, because they all have wolf dreams, and all of them believe their wolf dreams to be real. If Dany\u2019s prophetic dreams and her actions to follow what her dreams tell her to do are a sign of madness, then Bran and Jojen are mad, because they too look up to prophetic dreams to guide them. So trying to say that Dany is mad for believing in magic in a world in which magic does exist, is nonsense in my opinion.</p><p><b>2)</b> Dany\u2019s encounters with Quaithe are the same thing. One could wonder: could Dany\u2019s talks with Quaithe be just a product of her mind? After all, no one else seems to see or hear Quaithe, only Dany. And Dany herself wonders, after Quaithe comes to her in Meereen, if she\u2019s mad:</p><blockquote><p><b>\u201cYour Grace?\u201d</b> Missandei stood in the door of the queen\u2019s bedchamber, a lantern in her hand. <b>\u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d</b></p><p>Dany glanced back toward the persimmon tree. There was no woman there. No hooded robe, no lacquer mask, no Quaithe.</p><p>A shadow. A memory. No one. <b>She was the blood of the dragon, but Ser Barristan had warned her that in that blood there was a taint. Could I be going mad? They had called her father mad, once.</b>\u00a0- Daenerys II ADWD</p></blockquote><p>So I see how people could use this to say Dany is mad. However, we have proof that Dany is not seeing things. Quaithe is real, not a product of her mind. And what is this proof? Well, the first time Quaithe appears to Dany in the middle of the night, Quaithe repeats to Dany something she had already told Dany in person, when she was in Qarth:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cRemember. To go north, you must journey south. To reach the west, you must go east. To go forward you must go back, and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow.\u201d - Daenerys III ASOS</p></blockquote><p>So this could very well be a product of Dany\u2019s mind, it could be her mind remembering something Quaithe said and creating some hallucination based on it. However, the second time Quaithe comes to Dany, she tells Dany something entirely new:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cNo. Hear me, Daenerys Targaryen. The glass candles are burning. Soon comes the pale mare, and after her the others. Kraken and dark flame, lion and griffin, the sun\u2019s son and the mummer\u2019s dragon. Trust none of them. Remember the Undying. Beware the perfumed seneschal.\u201d - Daenerys II ADWD</p></blockquote><p>This is not something Quaithe told Dany before. This can\u2019t be a memory that her mind turned into a hallucination. This is not even something that Dany\u2019s mind could have produced, because Dany knows nothing about a pale mare, griffin, dark flame, or any of that. This is a prophecy. And we get confirmation later that this was indeed real, Dany was not imagining Quaithe. Because later in the books, the prophecy starts to come true: the pale mare comes, the sun\u2019s son comes, and we know that kraken, dark flame, lion and mummer\u2019s dragon are all true and are all going to cross Dany\u2019s path at some point. So Dany\u2019s talks with Quaithe were not a product of her mind: they were real, and Quaithe was giving Dany real prophecies. And we have a magic device established in the lore that could explain very well how Quaithe was able to communicate with Dany: glass candles. Quaithe even mentions them:\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo. Hear me, Daenerys Targaryen. <b>The glass candles are burning.</b>\u201d So Dany was not seeing or hearing things. Quaithe was actually talking to her.</p><p><b>3)</b> Finally, let\u2019s talk about Dany\u2019s last chapter in ADWD. In this chapter, Dany was supposedly having hallucinations and this supposedly proves she\u2019s mad. However, I have two problems with this interpretation. First, because Dany was in a terrible physical condition: she had suffered sun exposure, she had walked throughout the entire day, she was hungry, tired and weak, she had eaten poisoned berries, and she had just had a miscarriage. Having hallucinations in her condition has nothing to do with madness, it\u2019s very much normal. And second, because if I\u2019m going to be quite honest, I never interpreted Dany\u2019s last chapter as her having hallucinations. In my opinion, Dany talking with her ghosts or hearing the grass is simply a literary device. GRRM wrote Dany\u2019s last chapter as a huge solitary reflexion. She\u2019s all by herself thinking about her life and her choices. He could have written this chapter as a huge monologue in which Dany ponders about things. But that would have been really tiresome. By writing Dany talking with her ghosts, GRRM makes the chapter more dynamic, more interesting, less boring. It gives us dialogue instead of a monologue. So the choice of having Dany talk with her ghosts is simply a literary device. When I read that chapter, I never really interpreted as Dany having hallucinations. When Dany talks with Viserys, I don\u2019t get the impression that Dany truly believes that Viserys is in front of her: she\u2019s simply projecting him in her mind, and imagining the things he would have said. And the same is true of the other people Dany talks to. Dany doesn\u2019t believe those people are real, she\u2019s simply using a projection of them to reflect about her choices (though, as I pointed out, if she was indeed having hallucinations, it\u2019s nothing that indicates madness, given her physical condition).</p><p>So, to summarize why Daenerys is not mad: Her dreams are prophetic and come from magic, they are not a sign of madness. Her talks with Quaithe are actually real. And her hallucinations in the Dothraki sea are, in my opinion, a literary device, but anyway, if Dany is indeed having hallucinations, it\u2019s something to be expected given her physical condition. Finally, I need to say that in the books, Dany is a very level-headed person, who occasionally loses her temper. It\u2019s impossible for me to quote the entire books here, but reading them, I see no signs of madness. And we have even more proof that Dany isn\u2019t mad through what Ser Barristan Selmy says:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWhy ask for truth,\u201d Ser Barristan said softly, \u201cif you close your ears to it?\u201d He hesitated, then continued. <b>\u201cI told you before that I used a false name so the Lannisters would not know that I\u2019d joined you. That was less than half of it, Your Grace. The truth is, I wanted to watch you for a time before pledging you my sword. To make certain that you were not \u2026\u201d</b></p><p>\u2026 my father\u2019s daughter?\u201c If she was not her father\u2019s daughter, who was she?</p><p><b>\u201d\u2026 mad,\u201c he finished. \u201cBut I see no taint in you.\u201d</b></p><p>[\u2026]<b> \u201cSo I am a coin in the hands of some god, is that what you are saying, ser?\u201d</b><br></p><p><b>\u201cNo,\u201d Ser Barristan replied. \u201cYou are the trueborn heir of Westeros.</b> To the end of my days I shall remain your faithful knight, should you find me worthy to bear a sword again. If not, I am content to serve Strong Belwas as his squire.\u201d</p><p><b>\u201cWhat if I decide you\u2019re only worthy to be my fool?\u201d Dany asked scornfully. \u201cOr perhaps my cook?\u201d</b></p><p><b>\u201cI would be honored, Your Grace,\u201d Selmy said with quiet dignity.</b>\u00a0- Daenerys VI ASOS</p></blockquote><p>Ser Barristan knew her father. Of all people, he would know if Dany was mad, and if she was in any way like Aerys. He spends months hiding his identity and observing Dany just to see if she shows any signs of madness, and in the end, he is so sure that she isn\u2019t mad, and that she is a worthy queen to follow, that he even says he would be honored to be her cook. That\u2019s how much he trusts Dany. I think his judgement of her is yet another reason as for why the mad queen Dany theory doesn\u2019t really have a lot of basis.</p><p><b>THEMATIC IMPORTANCE OF MADNESS IN DANY\u2019S STORY</b></p><p>However, even though I don\u2019t think Dany is mad at all, I do think that \u201cmadness\u201d is an important part of her story, and I think the themes in her story are just another proof of why Dany won\u2019t go mad.</p><p><b>1)</b> One of the discussions involving madness is the madness vs greatness debate. We have this quote about the coin that everyone loves bringing up:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI am no maester to quote history at you, Your Grace. Swords have been my life, not books. <b>But every child knows that the Targaryens have always danced too close to madness. Your father was not the first. King Jaehaerys once told me that madness and greatness are two sides of the same coin. Every time a new Targaryen is born, he said, the gods toss the coin in the air and the world holds its breath to see how it will land.\u201d </b>- Daenerys VI ASOS</p></blockquote><p>But I think people really miss the point of this quote. This quote isn\u2019t saying that half the Targaryens are mad and half are not (in fact, <b><a href=\"https://tomakeitbeautifultolive.tumblr.com/post/185032357463/what-bothers-me-is-the-saying-that-when-a\">few Targaryens were indeed mad</a></b>). What it\u2019s talking about is how madness and greatness are two sides of the same coin. This means that to be great, you also have to be \u201cmad\u201d, in a way. When Dany is about to walk into Drogo\u2019s funeral pyre, this is what she tells Mirri Maz Duur:</p><blockquote><p>As she climbed down off the pyre, she noticed Mirri Maz Duur watching her. \u201cYou are mad,\u201d the godswife said hoarsely.</p><p><b>\u201cIs it so far from madness to wisdom?\u201d Dany asked.</b> - Daenerys X AGOT</p></blockquote><p>And this is a running theme in Dany\u2019s story, because if you think about it, part of what she does can indeed be seen as mad from the outside. Dany walked into a pyre! For anyone looking, this was pretty crazy! But it was also great. Because if Dany had not decided to commit this \u201cmadness\u201d, she wouldn\u2019t have hatched dragons either. To be great, Dany had to take a huge risk, she had to have a lot of courage and confidence. Most people would never take such a huge risk. Most people would consider taking a risk this huge to be madness. But Dany doesn\u2019t. She\u2019s the kind of person that is willing to go to extreme lengths to achieve something, who\u2019s willing to take risks to accomplish things that others consider impossible. That\u2019s where the madness vs greatness theme comes from, because to be great, you have to do things that most people would consider impossible (and because they consider it impossible, they call it madness). Other moment in which Dany can be considered mad is when she fights against Drogon with a whip. Many people would call this madness, while others would call it courage. And this theme can also be seen in Dany\u2019s fight against slavery. Most people would consider fighting a continent wide system madness, because it looks impossible. And yet, Dany does it anyway. Because she\u2019s the kind of person who is willing to do anything, no matter how hard it is. What other people call madness, is what makes her great.</p><p><b>2)</b> Related to this topic, Dany\u2019s defiances of society\u2019s norms is also something that leads people to call her mad. Her enemies call her mad because she dared to try to end slavery, and they also call her mad because she\u2019s a woman in a patriarchal society that dares to defy gender norms:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI have a gift for you as well.\u201d She slammed the chest shut. \u201cThree days. On the morning of the third day, send out your slaves. All of them. Every man, woman, and child shall be given a weapon, and as much food, clothing, coin, and goods as he or she can carry. These they shall be allowed to choose freely from among their masters\u2019 possessions, as payment for their years of servitude. When all the slaves have departed, you will open your gates and allow my Unsullied to enter and search your city, to make certain none remain in bondage. If you do this, Yunkai will not be burned or plundered, and none of your people shall be molested. The Wise Masters will have the peace they desire, and will have proved themselves wise indeed. What say you?\u201d</p><p><b>\u201cI say, you are mad.\u201d</b> - Daenerys IV ASOS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cWhen I went to the Hall of a Thousand Thrones to beg the Pureborn for your life, I said that you were no more than a child,\u201d Xaro went on, \u201cbut Egon Emeros the Exquisite rose and said, <b>\u2018She is a foolish child, mad and heedless and too dangerous to live.\u2019</b> When your dragons were small they were a wonder. Grown, they are death and devastation, a flaming sword above the world.\u201d He wiped away the tears. \u201cI should have slain you in Qarth.\u201d - Daenerys III ADWD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The more Quentyn heard of Daenerys Targaryen, the more he feared that meeting. <b>The Yunkai'i claimed that she fed her dragons on human flesh and bathed in the blood of virgins to keep her skin smooth and supple.</b> Beans laughed at that but relished the tales of the silver queen\u2019s promiscuity. <b>\u201cOne of her captains comes of a line where the men have foot-long members,\u201d he told them, \u201cbut even he\u2019s not big enough for her. She rode with the Dothraki and grew accustomed to being fucked by stallions, so now no man can fill her.\u201d And Books</b>, the clever Volantene swordsman who always seemed to have his nose poked in some crumbly scroll, <b>thought the dragon queen both murderous and mad. \u201cHer khal killed her brother to make her queen. Then she killed her khal to make herself khaleesi. She practices blood sacrifice, lies as easily as she breathes, turns against her own on a whim. She\u2019s broken truces, tortured envoys \u2026 her father was mad too. It runs in the blood.\u201d </b>\u2013 The Windblown, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>So all those people spreading the tales that Dany is monstrous and mad are actually people who have their own agenda, people that benefit from the status quo that Dany is trying to destroy. To me, it seems that GRRM is trying to explore how people that fight against the status quo and women that defy society are vilified. Making Dany mad accomplishes nothing in the story, it would only prove the villains right (something I don\u2019t believe GRRM would do).</p><p><b>3) </b>Another important theme related to madness is stigma. The main characters in ASOIAF have to face many stigmas: Tyrion is seen as a monster for being a dwarf, Bran is seen as useless, Arya is stigmatized for not conforming to gender norms, and Jon is a bastard. Dany also has to deal with stigma, and aside from the fact that she defies gender norms, there\u2019s the fact that she\u2019s the Mad King\u2019s daughter. This affects both how the people around her see her, and how she sees herself. As seen above, people judge her because of her father:</p><blockquote><p>\u201c[\u2026] She\u2019s broken truces, tortured envoys \u2026<b> her father was mad too. It runs in the blood.\u201d</b> \u2013 The Windblown, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>And in Westeros, there are already people calling her mad when they first hear of her:</p><blockquote><p><b>\u201cAs mad as her father,\u201d</b> declared Lord Mace Tyrell. - Epilogue, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>And, of course, there\u2019s Ser Barristan, who came to her wary and looking for signs of madness. This makes Dany question herself, worrying if she has the \u201ctaint\u201d:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cYou have brought freedom as well,\u201d Missandei pointed out.</p><p>\u201cFreedom to starve?\u201d asked Dany sharply. \u201cFreedom to die? Am I a dragon, or a harpy?\u201d <b>Am I mad? Do I have the taint? </b>- Daenerys VI ASOS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A shadow. A memory. No one. <b>She was the blood of the dragon, but Ser Barristan had warned her that in that blood there was a taint. Could I be going mad? They had called her father mad, once.</b> - Daenerys II ADWD</p></blockquote><p>This means that Dany\u2019s actions are subject to much more scrutiny by herself and others, and the story is trying to explore how the stigma impacts her life, her perceptions of herself, and other people\u2019s perception of her. But as happens to other characters that suffer stigma, I don\u2019t think the point of the story is to prove society right.</p><p>So I don\u2019t think Dany would ever go mad in the books. I think it\u2019s possible that she\u2019ll destroy King\u2019s Landing by accident (because the fact that her father has hidden wildfire in the city is a Chekhov\u2019s gun), but I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll go mad or evil (I wrote about the possibility of Dany turning into a villain <b><a href=\"https://rainhadaenerys.tumblr.com/post/182459462677/danys-story-is-the-opposite-of-hero-turns#notes\">HERE</a></b>), and I don\u2019t think she would ever destroy King\u2019s Landing on purpose. There\u2019s really no reason to think that she\u2019s mad: visions and prophetic dreams are magic, not madness; and her hallucinations are both a literary device and a consequence of being weak from all that Dany endured in the Dothraki sea. And looking at the themes regarding madness in her story, making Dany mad makes each of them pointless. I don\u2019t think the point of this story is to prove that slavers were right all along, that children are fated to be like their parents, or that women are crazy. And the theme of madness and greatness is about people\u2019s perceptions of what we call \u201cmadness\u201d and what we call \u201cgreatness\u201d, and how the same actions can be seen as either mad or great. It\u2019s not about how Targaryens are genetically determined to be either mad or great. (You can read more about what madness means in Dany\u2019s story <b><a href=\"https://rainhadaenerys.tumblr.com/post/184880550852/daenerys-and-magical-thinking#notes\">HERE</a></b> and <b><a href=\"https://rainhadaenerys.tumblr.com/post/184117823147/no-he-cannot-have-my-son-she-would-not-weep\">HERE</a></b>).</p><p>Finally, let me just give you a more personal opinion on this mad queen debate. I think the mad queen theory is so popular because it conveniently erases a female protagonist and gets her out of the way for the other heroes to shine. Which is exactly what happened in the show. So I hope GRRM is better than that.</p>",
                "content": "<p>\n\nThe question &ldquo;what do the books hint at for her destiny?&rdquo; is rather broad. Many things could be a hint of her endgame, and to be quite honest, I don&rsquo;t think the books give us a clear idea of what Dany&rsquo;s endgame is. As a Dany fan that wants to see her succeed, I can give you a list of reasons to why I think she&rsquo;ll survive. But there are many other meta writers out there that will also find many hints that Dany will die, or even that she&rsquo;ll become mad or evil (and I vehemently disagree with her ever being evil or the mad queen). So I&rsquo;m going to focus on answering about the &ldquo;Mad Queen Dany&rdquo; theory and why I don&rsquo;t think this is her endgame (if you have a more specific question about what I think about her endgame other than Mad Queen Dany, please feel free to send another ask). I also want to talk about how the idea of madness impacts thematically in Dany&rsquo;s story.</p><p>There are different arguments that are used in favor of the Mad Queen theory. Some of them have some basis in the books, and some of them are completely baseless. The main arguments I see in favor of the mad queen theory are: that Dany is violent; that Dany is paranoid; and that Dany has hallucinations. So let&rsquo;s talk about each of them.<b><br /></b></p><p><b>&ldquo;Dany is violent, therefore, she&rsquo;s mad&rdquo;</b></p><p>I think this argument fails on different levels.</p><p>First, because violence is not indication of madness. A person can be violent and not be mentally ill, and a person can be mentally ill and not be violent. In the books, we see many characters being violent, from Jon Snow to Tywin Lannister, and yet no one ever says they&rsquo;re insane. It always goes back to sexism: a woman showing any emotion or anger? Oh, must be madness! So this argument is bullshit.</p><p>Second, because Dany&rsquo;s supposed violence is always highly exaggerated in the fandom. What are her moments of violence? Well, Dany conquers cities to free slaves. Is that violence bad? I&rsquo;m sorry, but I don&rsquo;t see any other way for Dany to free the slaves. It&rsquo;s not like the masters will just decide to free the slaves if Dany asks them politely. And Dany using force and military power to conquer the slave cities is no different from characters like Stannis or Robb fighting in the War of the Five Kings. Actually, I would say Dany using her armies to free slaves is a much more noble goal than most of the other characters we see in ASOIAF. And yet you don&rsquo;t see people calling them mad, only Dany. In my opinion, there are only two moments in which we could say that Dany is violent and acts impulsively because of anger in the books: when she orders the crucifixions of the slavers and when she allows torture. And yet, there&rsquo;s nothing here to say that Dany is mad. Dany crucified slavers because the slavers crucified children. And she didn&rsquo;t choose random people to crucify: she specifically asked for the leaders of Meereen, and she told them to choose amongst themselves who would be crucified. Was it right? No. Was it justice? No. But I think Dany&rsquo;s reaction is pretty understandable given that Dany just witnessed the brutal crucifixion of children by the Meereenese masters just to taunt her, and it&rsquo;s also understandable because Dany never had a good role model to teach her about justice (she was raised by Viserys, so it&rsquo;s amazing that Dany turned out to be such a good person). Dany is trying to do what&rsquo;s right, but Dany doesn&rsquo;t always know what&rsquo;s right. About Dany allowing torture, again, this is not outside what&rsquo;s accepted in their society. Torture is considered to be a legitimate means of obtaining information, and Dany is a product of her society. There&rsquo;s also the fact that Dany was also being manipulated by the Shavepate. Besides, Dany does forbid torture later when she realizes it&rsquo;s ineffective.</p><p>So Dany only has TWO darker moments in the books (she has other flaws, but these are, in my opinion, the only really bad moments for her character), and both are understandable given her upbringing and the society she lives in. So the people calling her violent are just applying double standards. This is even more clear when you consider that there are other characters that also have impulsive moments in which they act out of anger. One example is Jon Snow, who also loses his temper in different moments:</p><blockquote><p>And then he heard the laughter, sharp and cruel as a whip, and the voice of Ser Alliser Thorne. <b>&ldquo;Not only a bastard, but a traitor&rsquo;s bastard,&rdquo;</b> he was telling the men around him.</p><p><b>In the blink of an eye, Jon had vaulted onto the table, dagger in his hand. </b>Pyp made a grab for him, but he wrenched his leg away, and then he was sprinting down the table and kicking the bowl from Ser Alliser&rsquo;s hand. Stew went flying everywhere, spattering the brothers. Thorne recoiled. People were shouting, but Jon Snow did not hear them. <b>He lunged at Ser Alliser&rsquo;s face with the dagger, slashing at those cold onyx eyes,</b> but Sam threw himself between them and before Jon could get around him, Pyp was on his back clinging like a monkey, and Grenn was grabbing his arm while Toad wrenched the knife from his fingers. - Jon VII AGOT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>He was almost ready to lower his blade and call a halt when Emmett feinted low and came in over his shield with a savage forehand slash that caught Jon on the temple. He staggered, his helm and head both ringing from the force of the blow. For half a heartbeat the world beyond his eyeslit was a blur.</p><p>And then the years were gone, and he was back at Winterfell once more, wearing a quilted leather coat in place of mail and plate. His sword was made of wood, and it was Robb who stood facing him, not Iron Emmett.</p><p>[&hellip;]</p><p>That morning he called it first. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Lord of Winterfell!&rdquo; he cried, as he had a hundred times before. Only this time, this time, Robb had answered, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be Lord of Winterfell, you&rsquo;re bastard-born. My lady mother says you can&rsquo;t ever be the Lord of Winterfell.&rdquo;</p><p>I thought I had forgotten that. Jon could taste blood in his mouth, from the blow he&rsquo;d taken.</p><p><b>In the end Halder and Horse had to pull him away from Iron Emmett, one man on either arm. The ranger sat on the ground dazed, his shield half in splinters, the visor of his helm knocked askew, and his sword six yards away. &ldquo;Jon, enough,&rdquo; Halder was shouting, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s down, you disarmed him. Enough!&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>No. Not enough. Never enough.</b> Jon let his sword drop. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Emmett, are you hurt?&rdquo;</p><p>Iron Emmett pulled his battered helm off. &ldquo;Was there some part of yield you could not comprehend, Lord Snow?&rdquo; It was said amiably, though. Emmett was an amiable man, and he loved the song of swords. &ldquo;Warrior defend me,&rdquo; he groaned, &ldquo;now I know how Qhorin Halfhand must have felt.&rdquo; - Jon XII ASOS</p></blockquote><p>Jon loses his temper and tries to kill someone over an insult. He also completely loses his senses and starts mindlessly beating a guy. Dany never had any moment in which she tried to kill someone over an insult (actually, there are moments in which people spit in her face and try to attack her, and she still forgives them), and Dany never loses her senses in anger. And yet, I don&rsquo;t see people calling Jon mad for losing his temper and being violent. These are double standards (and if you want to know more about darker Jon moments in the books, you can read my meta <b><a href=\"https://rainhadaenerys.tumblr.com/post/184810432287/hi-ive-only-read-the-first-book-and-that-was#notes\">HERE</a></b>). If you don&rsquo;t think Jon is &ldquo;mad&rdquo; for being violent or losing his temper, you shouldn&rsquo;t think this of Dany either (and like I said, violence is not the same thing as madness).</p><p><b>&ldquo;Dany is paranoid&rdquo;</b></p><p>This is an argument that I completely disagree with and that I think is completely baseless. Dany is not a paranoid person. She knows that she needs to trust people and work with them, and that otherwise, she would end up alienating everyone that could help her:</p><blockquote><p><b>&ldquo;It seems to me that a queen who trusts no one is as foolish as a queen who trusts everyone.</b> Every man I take into my service is a risk, I understand that, but how am I to win the Seven Kingdoms without such risks? Am I to conquer Westeros with one exile knight and three Dothraki bloodriders?&rdquo; &ndash; Daenerys I ASOS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am glad you came to me. It is good to see your face again, my friend.&rdquo;<b> I will not trust you, but I need you. I need your Thirteen, I need your ships, I need your trade.</b> - Daenerys III ADWD</p></blockquote><p>People in the fandom sometimes say that Dany is paranoid about prophecies. But this isn&rsquo;t true either. Dany receives several prophecies throughout the story, from Mirri Maz Duur, from the House of the Undying, and from Quaithe. And some of these prophecies warn her about some dangers: the Undying tell Dany that she&rsquo;ll know three treasons, one for blood, one for money and one for love. And Quaithe tells Dany to not trust many people: kraken and dark flame, lion and griffin, the sun&rsquo;s son and the mummer&rsquo;s dragons. So it would be understandable if she started to act a little paranoid. But she doesn&rsquo;t. Dany suspects many people, but she continues to accept them in her service:</p><blockquote><p>There were times when Dany wondered if that razor might not be better saved for Reznak&rsquo;s throat. He was a useful man, but she liked him little and trusted him less. <b>The Undying of Qarth had told her she would be thrice betrayed.</b> Mirri Maz Duur had been the first, Ser Jorah the second. <b>Would Reznak be the third? The Shavepate? Daario? Or will it be someone I would never suspect, Ser Barristan or Grey Worm or Missandei? </b>&ndash; Daenerys I ADWD</p></blockquote><p>As we can see, Dany distrusts all of these people. But she still keeps them in her service, not letting her doubts consume her.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;It has been so long,&rdquo; she had said to Ser Barristan, just yesterday. <b>&ldquo;What if Daario has betrayed me and gone over to my enemies?&rdquo; Three treasons will you know.</b> &ldquo;What if he met another woman, some princess of the Lhazarene?&rdquo; &ndash; Daenerys II ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Dany thinks that Daario might betray her. She thinks sellswords are treacherous, but she still sleeps with him.</p><p>Dany constantly thinks that prophecies are treacherous, and that she should not let them dictate her decisions:</p><blockquote><p><b>When Reznak and Skahaz appeared, she found herself looking at them askance, mindful of the three treasons. Beware the perfumed seneschal.</b> She sniffed suspiciously at Reznak mo Reznak. I could command the Shavepate to arrest him and put him to the question. Would that forestall the prophecy? Or would some other betrayer take his place? <b>Prophecies are treacherous, she reminded herself, and Reznak may be no more than he appears.</b> &ndash; Daenerys II ADWD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n\nHis bitterness dismayed her, so much so that <b>Dany found herself wondering if the grizzled Pentoshi could be one of her three betrayers. No, he is only an old man, far from home and sick at heart.</b> - Daenerys V ADWD&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>He shall be the stallion that mounts the world. Dany knew how it went with prophecies. They were made of words, and words were wind.</b>&nbsp;- Daenerys IV ADWD</p></blockquote><p>And even when Quentyn comes to her, she doesn&rsquo;t do anything about the prophecy, even though she knows that he&rsquo;s the sun&rsquo;s son:</p><blockquote><p><b>The sun&rsquo;s son. A shiver went through her.</b> &ldquo;Shadows and whispers.&rdquo; What else had Quaithe said? The pale mare and the sun&rsquo;s son. There was a lion in it too, and a dragon. Or am I the dragon? &ldquo;Beware the perfumed seneschal.&rdquo; That she remembered. <b>&ldquo;Dreams and prophecies. Why must they always be in riddles?</b> I hate this. Oh, leave me, ser. Tomorrow is my wedding day.&rdquo; &ndash; Daenerys VII</p></blockquote><p>So I don&rsquo;t really agree with the assessment that Dany is paranoid about prophecies. She worries about the prophecies, but she never lets them influence her actions and judgement, and is very aware that prophecies are treacherous. And actually, Dany&rsquo;s behaviour towards prophecy is written as a foil to another character: Cersei. Cersei is the one that is really paranoid. She sees enemies in every shadow, is obsessed with the idea that Tyrion is hiding everywhere and is the cause of all her problems. She alienates her allies and refuses to trust anyone. And she&rsquo;s terrified of the Younger More Beautiful Queen prophecy and tries to do everything to avoid it (in contrast to Dany, who doesn&rsquo;t do anything and reminds herself that prophecies are treacherous). GRRM has said that Dany and Cersei are meant as foils, and this is one of the main contrasts between them. So Dany is written exactly to contrast Cersei&rsquo;s attitude - she&rsquo;s not paranoid like Cersei, she&rsquo;s the opposite.</p><p><b>&ldquo;Dany has hallucinations&rdquo;</b></p><p>In the books, Dany has some visions that people sometimes use to argue that she&rsquo;s mad. So let&rsquo;s look at the different moments that I imagine that mad queen theorists use to &ldquo;prove&rdquo; that Dany is mad:</p><p><b>1)</b> In the first book, Dany has three prophetic dreams in which she dreams with dragons. These dreams (and also Mirri Maz Duur&rsquo;s lessons about how only death pays for life) give her the idea of stepping into the fire, and make her confident that she can walk into the fire without dying and hatch dragons.</p><p><b>2)</b> In the second book, when she is in Qarth, Dany meets a woman named Quaithe, who is a shadowbinder from Asshai. Qhaithe gives her warnings and prophecies. But in the next books, Dany starts to sometimes see and talk to Quaithe in the middle of the night, and no one else seems to see or hear Quaithe:</p><blockquote><p>She is standing over me. <b>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; Dany peered into the darkness. She thought she could see a shadow, the faintest outline of a shape.</b> &ldquo;What do you want to me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Remember. To go north, you must journey south. To reach the west, you must go east. To go forward you must go back, and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow.&rdquo;</p><p><b>&ldquo;Quaithe?&rdquo;</b> Dany sprung from the bed and threw open the door. Pale yellow lantern light flooded the cabin, and Irri and Jhiqui sat up sleepily. &ldquo;Khaleesi?&rdquo; murmured Jhiqui, rubbing her eyes. <b>Viserion woke and opened his jaws, and a puff of flame brightened even the darkest corners. There was no sign of a woman in a red lacquer mask. &ldquo;Khaleesi, are you unwell?&rdquo; asked Jhiqui.</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;A dream.&rdquo; Dany shook her head. &ldquo;I dreamed a dream, no more.</b> Go back to sleep. All of us, go back to sleep.&rdquo; Yet try as she might, sleep would not come again. - Daenerys III ASOS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>&ldquo;Quaithe? Am I dreaming?&rdquo;</b> She pinched her ear and winced at the pain. &ldquo;I dreamt of you on Balerion, when first we came to Astapor.&rdquo;</p><p><b>&ldquo;You did not dream. Then or now.&rdquo;</b></p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing here? <b>How did you get past my guards?&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;I came another way. Your guards never saw me.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;If I call out, they will kill you.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;They will swear to you that I am not here.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;Are you here?&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;No.</b> [&hellip;]&rdquo; - Daenerys II ADWD</p></blockquote><p><b>3)</b> Finally, there&rsquo;s Dany last chapter in ADWD. In this chapter, Dany &ldquo;talks with her ghosts&rdquo;. She&rsquo;s walking alone in the Dothraki sea, and yet she sees and talks to Jorah, Quaithe, Viserys, and she even listens to the grass talking:</p><blockquote><p>Sometimes she heard birds singing. The sound made her belly rumble, but she had no nets to snare them with, and so far she had not come on any nests. Once I dreamed of flying, she thought, and now I&rsquo;ve flown, and dream of stealing eggs. That made her laugh. <b>&ldquo;Men are mad and gods are madder,&rdquo; she told the grass, and the grass murmured its agreement. </b>- Daenerys X ADWD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>&ldquo;I am the blood of the dragon,&rdquo; she told the grass, aloud.</b></p><p><b>Once, the grass whispered back</b>, until you chained your dragons in the dark.</p><p>&ldquo;Drogon killed a little girl. Her name was &hellip; her name &hellip;&rdquo; Dany could not recall the child&rsquo;s name. That made her so sad that she would have cried if all her tears had not been burned away. &ldquo;I will never have a little girl. I was the Mother of Dragons.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Aye, the grass said, but you turned against your children. </b>- Daenerys X ADWD</p></blockquote><p>So&hellip; are these moments proof that Dany is mad? I don&rsquo;t think so at all. Let me explain why in each case:</p><p><b>1)</b> Dany doesn&rsquo;t have dragon dreams because she&rsquo;s mad. She has dragon dreams because they are truly prophetic dreams. And the proof we have of this is that they came true. Dany was right in believing that if she walked into the fire, she would survive. If this world was a world without any magic, and Dany started to have these dreams and think that they are prophetic, then I could understand the argument that she&rsquo;s mad. But this world has magic. Dany believing in magic and in prophetic dreams is not something that makes her mad, because magic does exist. If we start saying that Dany is &ldquo;mad&rdquo;, because she has prophetic dreams, then Bran, Jon, and Arya are all mad, because they all have wolf dreams, and all of them believe their wolf dreams to be real. If Dany&rsquo;s prophetic dreams and her actions to follow what her dreams tell her to do are a sign of madness, then Bran and Jojen are mad, because they too look up to prophetic dreams to guide them. So trying to say that Dany is mad for believing in magic in a world in which magic does exist, is nonsense in my opinion.</p><p><b>2)</b> Dany&rsquo;s encounters with Quaithe are the same thing. One could wonder: could Dany&rsquo;s talks with Quaithe be just a product of her mind? After all, no one else seems to see or hear Quaithe, only Dany. And Dany herself wonders, after Quaithe comes to her in Meereen, if she&rsquo;s mad:</p><blockquote><p><b>&ldquo;Your Grace?&rdquo;</b> Missandei stood in the door of the queen&rsquo;s bedchamber, a lantern in her hand. <b>&ldquo;Who are you talking to?&rdquo;</b></p><p>Dany glanced back toward the persimmon tree. There was no woman there. No hooded robe, no lacquer mask, no Quaithe.</p><p>A shadow. A memory. No one. <b>She was the blood of the dragon, but Ser Barristan had warned her that in that blood there was a taint. Could I be going mad? They had called her father mad, once.</b>&nbsp;- Daenerys II ADWD</p></blockquote><p>So I see how people could use this to say Dany is mad. However, we have proof that Dany is not seeing things. Quaithe is real, not a product of her mind. And what is this proof? Well, the first time Quaithe appears to Dany in the middle of the night, Quaithe repeats to Dany something she had already told Dany in person, when she was in Qarth:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Remember. To go north, you must journey south. To reach the west, you must go east. To go forward you must go back, and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow.&rdquo; - Daenerys III ASOS</p></blockquote><p>So this could very well be a product of Dany&rsquo;s mind, it could be her mind remembering something Quaithe said and creating some hallucination based on it. However, the second time Quaithe comes to Dany, she tells Dany something entirely new:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;No. Hear me, Daenerys Targaryen. The glass candles are burning. Soon comes the pale mare, and after her the others. Kraken and dark flame, lion and griffin, the sun&rsquo;s son and the mummer&rsquo;s dragon. Trust none of them. Remember the Undying. Beware the perfumed seneschal.&rdquo; - Daenerys II ADWD</p></blockquote><p>This is not something Quaithe told Dany before. This can&rsquo;t be a memory that her mind turned into a hallucination. This is not even something that Dany&rsquo;s mind could have produced, because Dany knows nothing about a pale mare, griffin, dark flame, or any of that. This is a prophecy. And we get confirmation later that this was indeed real, Dany was not imagining Quaithe. Because later in the books, the prophecy starts to come true: the pale mare comes, the sun&rsquo;s son comes, and we know that kraken, dark flame, lion and mummer&rsquo;s dragon are all true and are all going to cross Dany&rsquo;s path at some point. So Dany&rsquo;s talks with Quaithe were not a product of her mind: they were real, and Quaithe was giving Dany real prophecies. And we have a magic device established in the lore that could explain very well how Quaithe was able to communicate with Dany: glass candles. Quaithe even mentions them:&nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;No. Hear me, Daenerys Targaryen. <b>The glass candles are burning.</b>&rdquo; So Dany was not seeing or hearing things. Quaithe was actually talking to her.</p><p><b>3)</b> Finally, let&rsquo;s talk about Dany&rsquo;s last chapter in ADWD. In this chapter, Dany was supposedly having hallucinations and this supposedly proves she&rsquo;s mad. However, I have two problems with this interpretation. First, because Dany was in a terrible physical condition: she had suffered sun exposure, she had walked throughout the entire day, she was hungry, tired and weak, she had eaten poisoned berries, and she had just had a miscarriage. Having hallucinations in her condition has nothing to do with madness, it&rsquo;s very much normal. And second, because if I&rsquo;m going to be quite honest, I never interpreted Dany&rsquo;s last chapter as her having hallucinations. In my opinion, Dany talking with her ghosts or hearing the grass is simply a literary device. GRRM wrote Dany&rsquo;s last chapter as a huge solitary reflexion. She&rsquo;s all by herself thinking about her life and her choices. He could have written this chapter as a huge monologue in which Dany ponders about things. But that would have been really tiresome. By writing Dany talking with her ghosts, GRRM makes the chapter more dynamic, more interesting, less boring. It gives us dialogue instead of a monologue. So the choice of having Dany talk with her ghosts is simply a literary device. When I read that chapter, I never really interpreted as Dany having hallucinations. When Dany talks with Viserys, I don&rsquo;t get the impression that Dany truly believes that Viserys is in front of her: she&rsquo;s simply projecting him in her mind, and imagining the things he would have said. And the same is true of the other people Dany talks to. Dany doesn&rsquo;t believe those people are real, she&rsquo;s simply using a projection of them to reflect about her choices (though, as I pointed out, if she was indeed having hallucinations, it&rsquo;s nothing that indicates madness, given her physical condition).</p><p>So, to summarize why Daenerys is not mad: Her dreams are prophetic and come from magic, they are not a sign of madness. Her talks with Quaithe are actually real. And her hallucinations in the Dothraki sea are, in my opinion, a literary device, but anyway, if Dany is indeed having hallucinations, it&rsquo;s something to be expected given her physical condition. Finally, I need to say that in the books, Dany is a very level-headed person, who occasionally loses her temper. It&rsquo;s impossible for me to quote the entire books here, but reading them, I see no signs of madness. And we have even more proof that Dany isn&rsquo;t mad through what Ser Barristan Selmy says:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Why ask for truth,&rdquo; Ser Barristan said softly, &ldquo;if you close your ears to it?&rdquo; He hesitated, then continued. <b>&ldquo;I told you before that I used a false name so the Lannisters would not know that I&rsquo;d joined you. That was less than half of it, Your Grace. The truth is, I wanted to watch you for a time before pledging you my sword. To make certain that you were not &hellip;&rdquo;</b></p><p>&hellip; my father&rsquo;s daughter?&ldquo; If she was not her father&rsquo;s daughter, who was she?</p><p><b>&rdquo;&hellip; mad,&ldquo; he finished. &ldquo;But I see no taint in you.&rdquo;</b></p><p>[&hellip;]<b> &ldquo;So I am a coin in the hands of some god, is that what you are saying, ser?&rdquo;</b><br /></p><p><b>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Ser Barristan replied. &ldquo;You are the trueborn heir of Westeros.</b> To the end of my days I shall remain your faithful knight, should you find me worthy to bear a sword again. If not, I am content to serve Strong Belwas as his squire.&rdquo;</p><p><b>&ldquo;What if I decide you&rsquo;re only worthy to be my fool?&rdquo; Dany asked scornfully. &ldquo;Or perhaps my cook?&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;I would be honored, Your Grace,&rdquo; Selmy said with quiet dignity.</b>&nbsp;- Daenerys VI ASOS</p></blockquote><p>Ser Barristan knew her father. Of all people, he would know if Dany was mad, and if she was in any way like Aerys. He spends months hiding his identity and observing Dany just to see if she shows any signs of madness, and in the end, he is so sure that she isn&rsquo;t mad, and that she is a worthy queen to follow, that he even says he would be honored to be her cook. That&rsquo;s how much he trusts Dany. I think his judgement of her is yet another reason as for why the mad queen Dany theory doesn&rsquo;t really have a lot of basis.</p><p><b>THEMATIC IMPORTANCE OF MADNESS IN DANY&rsquo;S STORY</b></p><p>However, even though I don&rsquo;t think Dany is mad at all, I do think that &ldquo;madness&rdquo; is an important part of her story, and I think the themes in her story are just another proof of why Dany won&rsquo;t go mad.</p><p><b>1)</b> One of the discussions involving madness is the madness vs greatness debate. We have this quote about the coin that everyone loves bringing up:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am no maester to quote history at you, Your Grace. Swords have been my life, not books. <b>But every child knows that the Targaryens have always danced too close to madness. Your father was not the first. King Jaehaerys once told me that madness and greatness are two sides of the same coin. Every time a new Targaryen is born, he said, the gods toss the coin in the air and the world holds its breath to see how it will land.&rdquo; </b>- Daenerys VI ASOS</p></blockquote><p>But I think people really miss the point of this quote. This quote isn&rsquo;t saying that half the Targaryens are mad and half are not (in fact, <b><a href=\"https://tomakeitbeautifultolive.tumblr.com/post/185032357463/what-bothers-me-is-the-saying-that-when-a\">few Targaryens were indeed mad</a></b>). What it&rsquo;s talking about is how madness and greatness are two sides of the same coin. This means that to be great, you also have to be &ldquo;mad&rdquo;, in a way. When Dany is about to walk into Drogo&rsquo;s funeral pyre, this is what she tells Mirri Maz Duur:</p><blockquote><p>As she climbed down off the pyre, she noticed Mirri Maz Duur watching her. &ldquo;You are mad,&rdquo; the godswife said hoarsely.</p><p><b>&ldquo;Is it so far from madness to wisdom?&rdquo; Dany asked.</b> - Daenerys X AGOT</p></blockquote><p>And this is a running theme in Dany&rsquo;s story, because if you think about it, part of what she does can indeed be seen as mad from the outside. Dany walked into a pyre! For anyone looking, this was pretty crazy! But it was also great. Because if Dany had not decided to commit this &ldquo;madness&rdquo;, she wouldn&rsquo;t have hatched dragons either. To be great, Dany had to take a huge risk, she had to have a lot of courage and confidence. Most people would never take such a huge risk. Most people would consider taking a risk this huge to be madness. But Dany doesn&rsquo;t. She&rsquo;s the kind of person that is willing to go to extreme lengths to achieve something, who&rsquo;s willing to take risks to accomplish things that others consider impossible. That&rsquo;s where the madness vs greatness theme comes from, because to be great, you have to do things that most people would consider impossible (and because they consider it impossible, they call it madness). Other moment in which Dany can be considered mad is when she fights against Drogon with a whip. Many people would call this madness, while others would call it courage. And this theme can also be seen in Dany&rsquo;s fight against slavery. Most people would consider fighting a continent wide system madness, because it looks impossible. And yet, Dany does it anyway. Because she&rsquo;s the kind of person who is willing to do anything, no matter how hard it is. What other people call madness, is what makes her great.</p><p><b>2)</b> Related to this topic, Dany&rsquo;s defiances of society&rsquo;s norms is also something that leads people to call her mad. Her enemies call her mad because she dared to try to end slavery, and they also call her mad because she&rsquo;s a woman in a patriarchal society that dares to defy gender norms:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have a gift for you as well.&rdquo; She slammed the chest shut. &ldquo;Three days. On the morning of the third day, send out your slaves. All of them. Every man, woman, and child shall be given a weapon, and as much food, clothing, coin, and goods as he or she can carry. These they shall be allowed to choose freely from among their masters&rsquo; possessions, as payment for their years of servitude. When all the slaves have departed, you will open your gates and allow my Unsullied to enter and search your city, to make certain none remain in bondage. If you do this, Yunkai will not be burned or plundered, and none of your people shall be molested. The Wise Masters will have the peace they desire, and will have proved themselves wise indeed. What say you?&rdquo;</p><p><b>&ldquo;I say, you are mad.&rdquo;</b> - Daenerys IV ASOS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;When I went to the Hall of a Thousand Thrones to beg the Pureborn for your life, I said that you were no more than a child,&rdquo; Xaro went on, &ldquo;but Egon Emeros the Exquisite rose and said, <b>&lsquo;She is a foolish child, mad and heedless and too dangerous to live.&rsquo;</b> When your dragons were small they were a wonder. Grown, they are death and devastation, a flaming sword above the world.&rdquo; He wiped away the tears. &ldquo;I should have slain you in Qarth.&rdquo; - Daenerys III ADWD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The more Quentyn heard of Daenerys Targaryen, the more he feared that meeting. <b>The Yunkai'i claimed that she fed her dragons on human flesh and bathed in the blood of virgins to keep her skin smooth and supple.</b> Beans laughed at that but relished the tales of the silver queen&rsquo;s promiscuity. <b>&ldquo;One of her captains comes of a line where the men have foot-long members,&rdquo; he told them, &ldquo;but even he&rsquo;s not big enough for her. She rode with the Dothraki and grew accustomed to being fucked by stallions, so now no man can fill her.&rdquo; And Books</b>, the clever Volantene swordsman who always seemed to have his nose poked in some crumbly scroll, <b>thought the dragon queen both murderous and mad. &ldquo;Her khal killed her brother to make her queen. Then she killed her khal to make herself khaleesi. She practices blood sacrifice, lies as easily as she breathes, turns against her own on a whim. She&rsquo;s broken truces, tortured envoys &hellip; her father was mad too. It runs in the blood.&rdquo; </b>&ndash; The Windblown, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>So all those people spreading the tales that Dany is monstrous and mad are actually people who have their own agenda, people that benefit from the status quo that Dany is trying to destroy. To me, it seems that GRRM is trying to explore how people that fight against the status quo and women that defy society are vilified. Making Dany mad accomplishes nothing in the story, it would only prove the villains right (something I don&rsquo;t believe GRRM would do).</p><p><b>3) </b>Another important theme related to madness is stigma. The main characters in ASOIAF have to face many stigmas: Tyrion is seen as a monster for being a dwarf, Bran is seen as useless, Arya is stigmatized for not conforming to gender norms, and Jon is a bastard. Dany also has to deal with stigma, and aside from the fact that she defies gender norms, there&rsquo;s the fact that she&rsquo;s the Mad King&rsquo;s daughter. This affects both how the people around her see her, and how she sees herself. As seen above, people judge her because of her father:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;[&hellip;] She&rsquo;s broken truces, tortured envoys &hellip;<b> her father was mad too. It runs in the blood.&rdquo;</b> &ndash; The Windblown, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>And in Westeros, there are already people calling her mad when they first hear of her:</p><blockquote><p><b>&ldquo;As mad as her father,&rdquo;</b> declared Lord Mace Tyrell. - Epilogue, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>And, of course, there&rsquo;s Ser Barristan, who came to her wary and looking for signs of madness. This makes Dany question herself, worrying if she has the &ldquo;taint&rdquo;:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;You have brought freedom as well,&rdquo; Missandei pointed out.</p><p>&ldquo;Freedom to starve?&rdquo; asked Dany sharply. &ldquo;Freedom to die? Am I a dragon, or a harpy?&rdquo; <b>Am I mad? Do I have the taint? </b>- Daenerys VI ASOS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A shadow. A memory. No one. <b>She was the blood of the dragon, but Ser Barristan had warned her that in that blood there was a taint. Could I be going mad? They had called her father mad, once.</b> - Daenerys II ADWD</p></blockquote><p>This means that Dany&rsquo;s actions are subject to much more scrutiny by herself and others, and the story is trying to explore how the stigma impacts her life, her perceptions of herself, and other people&rsquo;s perception of her. But as happens to other characters that suffer stigma, I don&rsquo;t think the point of the story is to prove society right.</p><p>So I don&rsquo;t think Dany would ever go mad in the books. I think it&rsquo;s possible that she&rsquo;ll destroy King&rsquo;s Landing by accident (because the fact that her father has hidden wildfire in the city is a Chekhov&rsquo;s gun), but I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll go mad or evil (I wrote about the possibility of Dany turning into a villain <b><a href=\"https://rainhadaenerys.tumblr.com/post/182459462677/danys-story-is-the-opposite-of-hero-turns#notes\">HERE</a></b>), and I don&rsquo;t think she would ever destroy King&rsquo;s Landing on purpose. There&rsquo;s really no reason to think that she&rsquo;s mad: visions and prophetic dreams are magic, not madness; and her hallucinations are both a literary device and a consequence of being weak from all that Dany endured in the Dothraki sea. And looking at the themes regarding madness in her story, making Dany mad makes each of them pointless. I don&rsquo;t think the point of this story is to prove that slavers were right all along, that children are fated to be like their parents, or that women are crazy. And the theme of madness and greatness is about people&rsquo;s perceptions of what we call &ldquo;madness&rdquo; and what we call &ldquo;greatness&rdquo;, and how the same actions can be seen as either mad or great. It&rsquo;s not about how Targaryens are genetically determined to be either mad or great. (You can read more about what madness means in Dany&rsquo;s story <b><a href=\"https://rainhadaenerys.tumblr.com/post/184880550852/daenerys-and-magical-thinking#notes\">HERE</a></b> and <b><a href=\"https://rainhadaenerys.tumblr.com/post/184117823147/no-he-cannot-have-my-son-she-would-not-weep\">HERE</a></b>).</p><p>Finally, let me just give you a more personal opinion on this mad queen debate. I think the mad queen theory is so popular because it conveniently erases a female protagonist and gets her out of the way for the other heroes to shine. Which is exactly what happened in the show. So I hope GRRM is better than that.</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n\nThe question &ldquo;what do the books hint at for her destiny?&rdquo; is rather broad. Many things could be a hint of her endgame, and to be quite honest, I don&rsquo;t think the books give us a clear idea of what Dany&rsquo;s endgame is. As a Dany fan that wants to see her succeed, I can give you a list of reasons to why I think she&rsquo;ll survive. But there are many other meta writers out there that will also find many hints that Dany will die, or even that she&rsquo;ll become mad or evil (and I vehemently disagree with her ever being evil or the mad queen). So I&rsquo;m going to focus on answering about the &ldquo;Mad Queen Dany&rdquo; theory and why I don&rsquo;t think this is her endgame (if you have a more specific question about what I think about her endgame other than Mad Queen Dany, please feel free to send another ask). I also want to talk about how the idea of madness impacts thematically in Dany&rsquo;s story.</p>",
