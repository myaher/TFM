        "answer": "<p>Hey anon! I love your Sansa Stark love lol, whenever I get <b><i>#sansalove</i></b> in my ask box it brightens my WHOLE DAY \u2764\ufe0f</p><p>Sadly though, you\u2019re right; there are always going to be people who hate Sansa and characters like her\u2026 I think characters like Sansa are very easy characters to put in a narrative box, and that box places a lot of limitations and expectations on characters like her. Which is so sad, because he is so much bigger and better and more beautiful than the box that people want to confine her to. But when Sansa characters d a r e to start to moving outside that box\u2014 that\u2019s when people start to get uncomfortable, that\u2019s when people start to get angry. </p><p>I don\u2019t really blame people for initially putting Sansa in this box either tbh, it\u2019s such a prevalent theme and practice in regards to what are generally considered \u201ctraditional female characters.\u201d And I do think it\u2019s easy to get surprised when Sansa\u2019s move out side their boxes and the realm of expectations for their characters as well; GRRM has even said that Sansa surprised him in that way. But so often that surprise turns to resentment and disdain, because nothing really <i>changes</i> about Sansa characters, they manage to move outside their boxes all on their own. Getting smarter shouldn\u2019t enable a female character to start testing the boundaries of our expectations. Nooo, that\u2019s a job for female characters who get <i>stronger!</i> So the surprise turns to resentment and disdain, which can soon turn to outright hatred.</p><p>There\u2019s this quote that I think perfectly sums up reactions to and judgements of Sansa and characters like her: \u201c<i>the world never did help a smart girl.\u201d</i> Smart girls are allowed to be just that, but they aren\u2019t allowed to be anything else. So people are comfortable with Sansa characters, as long as she stays in her smart girl box and doesn\u2019t dare to pretend she\u2019s a <i>real</i> Strong Female Character\u2122\u2026 <br/></p><!-- more --><p>Sansa can have a voice, as long as she speaks when spoken to. She can have an opinion, as long as she remembers her place. She can have political influence and play the game, but <i>only</i> in the North. She can contribute, as long as she doesn\u2019t want or ask that her contributions be recognized. She can have agency and stand up for herself, but only to people who deserve it, like her abusers. She can be strong in her own way, as long as she doesn\u2019t try to use her strengths for her own benefit.

Also, Sansa\u2019s are never anyone\u2019s first choice, so make sure you don\u2019t make that mistake. Why would anyone ever pick a <i>Sansa?</i> Be romantically interested in a <i>Sansa??</i> Fall in love with a <i>Sansa???</i> When there are other, more impressive, <i>real</i> Strong Female Characters who are <i>far more deserving</i> of love and admiration?!? <br></p><p>And I mean honestly, you don\u2019t even <i>need</i> to ship her with <i>anyone</i>. Sure she\u2019s smart; but like, she\u2019s a <i>victim</i>. She\u2019s damaged goods. Sansa\u2019s don\u2019t get happily ever afters, they haven\u2019t earned it. Not like other <i>real</i> Strong Female Characters have. No, Sansa should settle for loving herself; she shouldn\u2019t want or expect anything more than that. Don\u2019t be stupid Sansa, don\u2019t be unrealistic. Characters like Sansa should always be realistic and humble; they should realize they are disposable, because there are a dozen more where they came from.<br></p><p>No one tells stories or sings songs about Sansa Stark\u2019s. She isn\u2019t in the history books, there is no need to remember her when she\u2019s gone. Sure, she\u2019s smart; but Sansa\u2019s are a dime a dozen. Better to write about the <i>real</i> heroines, the <i>real</i> strong girls, the <i>real</i> badasses, the ones who are <i>really</i> going to make a difference, the ones who actually <i>deserve</i> to be remembered. Sansa did nothing but survive and triumph all on her own in a world that tried to beat her down and tear her apart at every step and with every turn.<br></p><p>The world never helped a smart girl, and why should it? They\u2019re <i>nothing special. </i><br></p>",
                "content": "<p>Hey anon! I love your Sansa Stark love lol, whenever I get <b><i>#sansalove</i></b> in my ask box it brightens my WHOLE DAY &#10084;&#65039;</p><p>Sadly though, you&rsquo;re right; there are always going to be people who hate Sansa and characters like her&hellip; I think characters like Sansa are very easy characters to put in a narrative box, and that box places a lot of limitations and expectations on characters like her.

But so often that surprise turns to resentment and disdain, because nothing really <i>changes</i> about Sansa characters, they manage to move outside their boxes all on their own. Getting smarter shouldn&rsquo;t enable a female character to start testing the boundaries of our expectations. Nooo, that&rsquo;s a job for female characters who get <i>stronger!</i> So the surprise turns to resentment and disdain, which can soon turn to outright hatred.</p><p>There&rsquo;s this quote that I think perfectly sums up reactions to and judgements of Sansa and characters like her: &ldquo;<i>the world never did help a smart girl.&rdquo;</i> Smart girls are allowed to be just that, but they aren&rsquo;t allowed to be anything else. So people are comfortable with Sansa characters, as long as she stays in her smart girl box and doesn&rsquo;t dare to pretend she&rsquo;s a <i>real</i> Strong Female Character&trade;&hellip; <br /></p><p>Sansa can have a voice, as long as she speaks when spoken to. She can have an opinion, as long as she remembers her place. She can have political influence and play the game, but <i>only</i> in the North. She can contribute, as long as she doesn&rsquo;t want or ask that her contributions be recognized. She can have agency and stand up for herself, but only to people who deserve it, like her abusers. She can be strong in her own way, as long as she doesn&rsquo;t try to use her strengths for her own benefit. She can be confident and self assured, but she better not start thinking too highly of herself or getting too big for her britches, we wouldn&rsquo;t want her to start getting power hungry. </p><p>Go ahead and love Sansa, but don&rsquo;t make her into something she&rsquo;s not. Don&rsquo;t give her any recognition she doesn&rsquo;t deserve. Don&rsquo;t kid yourself into thinking she&rsquo;s actually valuable. Don&rsquo;t taint or white wash her character with your silly ideas that she&rsquo;s an important character. You&rsquo;re just going to be disappointed, Sansa&rsquo;s are never that important. And why would she be? She doesn&rsquo;t know how to use a sword, she doesn&rsquo;t have dragons, she doesn&rsquo;t have magic, she doesn&rsquo;t have a wolf, she doesn&rsquo;t have an army. All she has is her brain, that&rsquo;s not impressive <i>at all.</i> For example, she couldn&rsquo;t even fight back at her abusers or stop her own abuse, she had to <i>&ldquo;roll over and take it.&rdquo;</i> I mean yeah I guess it&rsquo;s cool she managed to survive, but hopefully she learned her lesson. Characters like Sansa <i>need</i> to be taught lessons, after all. Who are they to be proud? To think that they are important?? To have dreams and want good things for themselves??? When there are other characters who are <i>so much more deserving?!</i> When there are other characters who have really earned it. Don&rsquo;t compare Sansa to those characters, she&rsquo;s nothing like them. How <i>insulting! </i></p><p>Sure, Sansa is a smart girl. But that&rsquo;s nothing special, and it doesn&rsquo;t make <i>her</i> anything special. So how <i>dare</i> she think she is?? How dare <i>anyone</i> think she is!? Sansa isn&rsquo;t a ruler or a heroine or a leader or a leading lady&hellip; Nooo no no don&rsquo;t be <i>stupid!</i> Sansa is the side kick, Sansa is the girl friend, Sansa is the bff, Sansa is the little wife. Sansa is there to make <i>other people</i> look better. Why on EARTH would you make her a leading lady when there are other <i>real</i> Strong Female Characters who are much more deserving and much better suited for that roll than Sansa?!? I mean yeah she&rsquo;s smart, but that doesn&rsquo;t make her worthy of being a hero or a leader. That would be so unrealistic, for a character like Sansa to end up being in a leadership roll where someone else clearly belongs. What a <i>joke! </i><br /></p><p>Sansa&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t become queens, they don&rsquo;t become powerful, they don&rsquo;t become leaders; they aren&rsquo;t heroes or fighters or legends or saviors. Sansa&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t save lives, their don&rsquo;t make an impact, they don&rsquo;t leave their mark, they don&rsquo;t change the world or make it a better place. Noooo those are jobs for <i>real</i> Strong Female Characters, not Sansa&rsquo;s. It would be unrealistic for her to do any of those things tbqh, especially when there are other, more important, more capable characters around. Sansa&rsquo;s sit still, look pretty, and wait until they are called upon. Sansa characters can have a future, obviously; but just not a future that should belong to a <i>real</i> Strong Female Character. She should be grateful she&rsquo;s managed to survive this long with nothing but herself and her brain, she&rsquo;s clearly had help and she&rsquo;s clearly gotten lucky. She shouldn&rsquo;t expect to be important or powerful or loved or appreciated. And if she is at all, she should be grateful. Sansa&rsquo;s should <i>always</i> be grateful for being &ldquo;handed&rdquo; things they haven&rsquo;t earned and don&rsquo;t really deserve. She should consider herself lucky. </p><p>Oh! And speaking of <i>love</i>: if you are going to ship Sansa with someone, make sure it&rsquo;s someone who proves she isn&rsquo;t shallow&hellip; She did need to be taught that lesson after all, and she should be smarter that that by now. That&rsquo;s what her story is supposed to be about isn&rsquo;t it, finally becoming smart and not being a&nbsp;&ldquo;stupid girl&rdquo; anymore?

It ignores a very simple concept: Jon didn't lose the battle because he didn't have enough men, or even that his plan failed: Jon lost because he recklessly ran into battle and abandoned any plan that was made, thus running himself and his people into Ramsay's traps. Sansa telling Jon about the Vale wouldn't change his actions; it would only add the Vale to those many casualties.",

She stopped trusting him completely the moment he handed her to the Boltons, who knows if he would have betrayed her yet again. All of this is so obviously laid out for the audience so anyone who is arguing otherwise is a hateful prick.
