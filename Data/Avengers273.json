Some angst and some fluff.</p><p><b>WC: 4k</b></p><p>There is one part at the end that I had this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfFW9COtsR8\">song</a> playing in my head the entire time. I\u2019ll post the link again at the spot in the story. Hope you guys like it! Tag list is open!<br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>Deep breath in. Hold it. Release. Repeat.</p><p>Over and over. It seems to be a never ending cycle.</p><p>You sit upright in a white plush chair in one of the many labs in the mansion. Bruce and Tony are in the next room over, but you can see them through the wall of glass separating you. Their heads are close together and bent over the mass of computer screens. With a sigh, you shift uncomfortably, trying not to dislodge the IV that was sticking in your arm. Bruce runs his fingers through his hair and glances up at you with a forced smile. Your stomach drops and you close your eyes, trying to block everything out as you sit in silence.</p><p>It had been two weeks since the attack on the mansion. Two weeks since you had your first meltdown, but it wasn&rsquo;t the only one. You had been plagued with nightmares every night since then. Broken fragments of memories that you couldn&rsquo;t quite place but felt familiar all the same. Unnamed fears that crippled your entire body and threatened loss of consciousness. All of these things were also accompanied by anger and heartache.</p><p>The anger came from so many things. Not understanding yourself anymore, not being able to control yourself, not trusting yourself around the team anymore, not being able to read Bucky, being treated as a lab rat, the list goes on and on. But the heartache, that mainly comes from knowing that you have feelings for Bucky that are not reciprocated. Knowing that he only wants to use you for a release and nothing more, and what&rsquo;s worse, you&rsquo;re considering letting him.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright. I think we&rsquo;re done for the day.&rdquo; Tony steps into the room with a bag of blueberries. &ldquo;You doing okay?&rdquo; You nod, but keep your eyes closed, fighting off the nausea that is building in your stomach, as he removes the IV. &ldquo;Everything looks good. We&rsquo;ve isolated a few more genomes from your DNA. It would probably be better if you go to -&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m not going to Wakanda for the panthers to dissect my brain and probe around in there,&rdquo; you say tightly and squeeze your eyes even tighter.</p><p>&ldquo;It worked so well for James. If you would just consider it,&rdquo; Bruce says quietly. You hadn&rsquo;t heard him come in. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to stay there forever.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; You say again and hop off the chair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine right where I am.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh sure. Your nightmares are getting worse. You hardly sleep. You walk around like a member of the Walking Dead, and you are training so brutally I&rsquo;ve had to replace most of the equipment.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you know it was me? It could have been Steve or Bucky on a bad day,&rdquo; you say weakly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, okay, I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m such a fucked up mess.&rdquo; You storm out of the room without another word. Your stomach churns angrily as you climb the stairs two at a time, heading toward the south side of the roof. Your favorite spot because it overlooks the river. </p><p>You lean your back against the wall and slide to the ground, pressing your forehead against your knees. Silent tears slide down your cheeks as your mind races. The dull ache blooms in your chest as your fingers curl around your ankles and take a shaky breath. The sound of footsteps causes you to jump and hastily wipe your face with your sleeve.</p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;Oh. Sorry. I didn&rsquo;t think anyone else would be up here,&rdquo; Bucky&rsquo;s voice was quiet. You look up in time to see him run his fingers through his hair and start to turn away, but he stops. &ldquo;Are you okay? Are you crying?&rdquo; Bucky kneels in front of you, but you can&rsquo;t meet his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; you whisper and try to shift away from him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; This seems to be your new catch phrase.</p><p>&ldquo;More tests?&rdquo; He asks softly, tilting his head to the side. &ldquo;Did they find anything new? Anything helpful?&rdquo;</p><p>Shaking your head, you peek up at him from under your lashes and your heart squeezes painfully. &ldquo;No. Everything is the same. No new news. No changes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then why are you so upset?&rdquo; He pressed. His fingers flexed in front of him, but he made no move to reach out.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just tired. I&rsquo;ve been having nightmares. I&rsquo;m frustrated and I cry when I&rsquo;m frustrated,&rdquo; you explain and close your eyes again. You inhale deeply through your nose and let it out through your mouth. &ldquo;They want to send me to Wakanda,&rdquo; you whisper softly and fight back tears again.</p><p>Bucky&rsquo;s face falls and he leans back just a little, as if he&rsquo;s trying to put some space between the two of you. &ldquo;Oh. It&rsquo;s a beautiful place,&rdquo; he offered, but he didn&rsquo;t sound sincere. You nod once and wipe your cheeks again. &ldquo;When do you leave?&rdquo; He&rsquo;s stoic, but you swear you hear a hint of emotion in his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going,&rdquo; you say firmly and clench your fists. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go to a strange place and have the probe around in my brain.&rdquo; Your lips press together suddenly and you look at him apologetically. &ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For what? I volunteered. I knew that I needed help, and they were the best. They nearly fixed me. I still have a lot of issues to sort through on my own, but I don&rsquo;t feel controlled or afraid of who I am anymore.&rdquo; Bucky stops and looks at you for a long while before reaching out with his flesh hand and tucking a piece of hair behind your ear. &ldquo;Maybe you should go. If anyone can help you, they can.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look, Bucky, I get that they helped you and it was great, but I don&rsquo;t even know what&rsquo;s wrong with me. I want to figure it out for myself before I let everyone and their brother fuck around in my brain.&rdquo; You almost lean into his hand, but stop yourself. Longing for his touch is something that you try not to do because it is too painful. pulling yourself together, you start to stand.</p><p>Bucky reaches out suddenly and grabs your wrist gently. &ldquo;Wait. I didn&rsquo;t mean to push you. Stay. We can talk a little bit.&rdquo; He smiles, but it doesn&rsquo;t touch his eyes. &ldquo;To get your mind off of everything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a good idea.&rdquo; And it isn&rsquo;t a good idea. Every time you look at him, you want to lean forward those few inches and kiss him again and again, but you know that you&rsquo;re heart can&rsquo;t take it at this fragile time in your life.</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Bucky scoffs, trying to hide the hurt in his voice. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re friends, right? We can sit and talk about things like civilized people, can&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We could,&rdquo; you agree cautiously. &ldquo;But I still don&rsquo;t think I can.&rdquo; Biting your lip, you turn to walk away, but Bucky doesn&rsquo;t let go of your arm. &ldquo;Bucky, come on.&rdquo; You pull your arm, but his grip tightens. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; He demands. &ldquo;Do you have somewhere else you need to be? Got a hot date or something?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; With a sigh of defeat, you sink back to the ground beside him. There were several valid reasons that you could think of, but none of them you could tell him. &ldquo;Fine. What do you want to talk about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your favorite song?&rdquo; He asks suddenly, randomly. He smirks at your expression.</p><p>&ldquo;So we&rsquo;re going to play 20 questions then?&rdquo; He nods once. &ldquo;Alright then.&rdquo;</p><p>You answer all of his questions and he answers all of yours. The two of you sit and talk for hours, laughing at bad jokes and stories from the past. You let yourself relax a little and open up to Bucky and he does the same. It felt good to just sit and talk to someone, the conversation aimless. No purpose or double meaning. Just two people getting to know each other.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you feel better?&rdquo; Bucky asks after you stop laughing from his story of Coney Island and Steve getting sick on the rides. </p><p>Nodding slowly, you notice just how relaxed you feel. The knots in your stomach or gone and the ache in your chest is dull, barely noticable. &ldquo;I do actually. I think this is the longest conversation I&rsquo;ve had in awhile. I feel almost human again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know what you mean,&rdquo; he chuckles and you forget to breathe. The sound of his laugh only makes you ache for him even more. He shifts his weight from where he is sitting beside you, pulling one of his knees to his chest and leaving his other leg extended. His leg and arm bump against your side a few times, bringing chill bumps to your skin despite the warm weather. &ldquo;Hey listen&hellip;&rdquo; He stops talking and fidgets with a spot on his dark jeans.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; warily, you cut your eyes at him and bite your lip.</p><p>&ldquo;I, uh, I think you should really consider going to Wakanda for a while,&rdquo; Bucky says slowly, not looking at you.</p><p>It felt as though you&rsquo;ve \u00a0been kicked in the gut. The dull ache in your chest erupts into white hot pain. Your eyes start to burn again as tears start to form. Of course he thought you should go to Wakanda. You were broken and needed some serious fixing. No one wanted to deal with your issues here. Wiping your face before he can see your tears, you sniff once. &ldquo;Right. That&rsquo;s great, James, thanks for your input,&rdquo; you snap and turn away from him.</p><p>&ldquo;No! That&rsquo;s not what&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t mean to&hellip;&rdquo; He was searching for the right words, but couldn&rsquo;t seem to find any. &ldquo;I think it would be good for you to get away from this place for a while. Everything has been quite and we haven&rsquo;t had a mission in weeks. Tony would be happy to let you borrow a jet for a while. Maybe not without supervision.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did he tell you to say that? Is that why you&rsquo;re here and why you wanted to talk to me? Did Tony put you up to this?&rdquo; Unbelievable. You didn&rsquo;t bother trying to hide your anger.</p><p>&ldquo;Geez, y/n, no! I just wanted to talk to you because I haven&rsquo;t seen you in a while.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You see me everyday,&rdquo; you retort bitterly.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but you haven&rsquo;t been you. I just wanted to see you and talk to the old you.&rdquo; He lets out a long sigh and stands. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not trying to push you. I just think you&rsquo;ll enjoy it. I know I wouldn&rsquo;t mind going back to Wakanda for a while,&rdquo; Bucky admits after a long pause.</p><p>&ldquo;Then come with me,&rdquo; you say suddenly and turn to face him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go&hellip; But I want you to come with me.&rdquo; It was a long shot, but maybe if you didn&rsquo;t go alone it wouldn&rsquo;t be as bad. If you had someone to talk to, someone you knew well, maybe you wouldn&rsquo;t feel so isolated.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n,&rdquo; he whispers and closes his eyes. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you feel more comfortable with Wanda or Nat going? I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m the guy for that.&rdquo; Bucky pauses again, shifting uncomfortably. &ldquo;Listen, Y/n, I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re thinking&hellip; But I&rsquo;m not the guy for you.&rdquo;</p><p>The ache in your chest surged again. It was an overwhelming throbbing now, something that you could no longer ignore. Nodding your head, you stand up so suddenly that you almost knock Bucky over. &ldquo;Okay. I get it. Message received.&rdquo; Your voice broke as tears begin to flow down you face. &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; you whisper and bolt for the door. &ldquo;Thanks for talking to me, Bucky,&rdquo; you call over your shoulder. Without a second glance, you disappear.</p><p>If you had looked back, you would have seen the pain and regret painted on Bucky&rsquo;s face. You would have seen how his fists were clenched at his sides and how his eyes glistened just a little. And how his breathing was shallow, like he couldn&rsquo;t take a deep breath because it hurt too much. You would have seen that his words were a lie, but you never turned around.</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, Stark, I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo; You are standing in the doorway of his lab, fidgeting with a small tear on the pocket of your jeans.</p><p>Tony looks up, shocked but pleased, and sets his tools down. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll regret this. You can stay as long as you&rsquo;d like or leave as soon as you want. I&rsquo;ll confirm everything. Suri will be excited that she&rsquo;ll have something meaningful to do now.&rdquo; He leaves the room, muttering to himself.</p><p>You try to convince yourself that you had made the right decision, but you still didn&rsquo;t feel great about it. Taking a deep breath, you head to your room to hide from reality for a while.</p><p>***</p><p>You shift in front of the mirror, tugging at the hem of your dress again, trying to get the fabric to lay right. Your hair fell in soft waves down your shoulders, and your makeup was minimal but affected.</p><p>&ldquo;You look fine! Come on the party started half an hour ago!&rdquo; Wanda says with a heavy sigh. &ldquo;Tony is throwing this party for you, you know, you should at least show up!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh Tony would through a party for any reason! My leaving is just the most recent event that warrants some big gathering in his opinion,&rdquo; you mutter and tuck your hair behind your ears. Casting one more look over your shoulder, you follow Wanda out of the room and toward the sound of people laughing and music playing. &ldquo;Oh my gosh,&rdquo; you whisper as you walk through the door. There were hundreds of people milling around, talking and dancing and laughing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to need a drink.&rdquo; Wanda nods as you push through the throngs of people trying to get to the bar.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow! You look fantastic! You sure clean up good!&rdquo; Sam whistled and laughs when you approach where he is sitting at the bar. &ldquo;Leave it to Tony to turn a goodbye party into a several hundred people event!&rdquo; He sweeps his arms out, gesturing around the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks. And yeah. I know. I actually was expecting this, but it still doesn&rsquo;t make me feel any better.&rdquo; You sit beside Sam and order a drink. The bartender pours it and hands it to you immediately. &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; you mutter and turn to survey the room. The music was pulsating, but it wasn&rsquo;t really loud. It was more like constant background noise. People were dancing in the center of the room, shouting and laughing loudly. Some people even appeared to be drunk already.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Sam. Y/n,&rdquo; Steve greets you with a smile and a hug. &ldquo;Packed and ready to go?&rdquo; You nod and he smiles even wider, like he&rsquo;s got a secret that he&rsquo;s dying to tell. &ldquo;Good. Have you guys seen Bucky? He was supposed to train with me before the party, but I haven&rsquo;t seen him all day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No I haven&rsquo;t seen him since we talked two days ago,&rdquo; you admit sheepishly and scan the room, looking for the super soldier. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s around here somewhere. I didn&rsquo;t figure he would come tonight because of all the people.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d miss this,&rdquo; Sam mutters under his breath. Steve elbows Sam in the ribs and chuckles. You look at both of them curiously but say nothing. &ldquo;Well, this has been a fun talk, but I&rsquo;m going to go dance now. Care to join me?&rdquo; Sam asks looking over at you.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh no. I don&rsquo;t dance. And I don&rsquo;t do well with large crowds. I&rsquo;m going to stay right here and people watch.&rdquo; You take a sip of your drink and Sam shrugs, disappearing into the sea of people. </p><p>Steve shakes his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go find Tony.&rdquo; He too disappears into the crowd, leaving you alone at the bar. Tilting back the glass, you down the rest of your drink and signal the bartender for another one. </p><p>You smile and hold polite conversations with several people that pass by or stop to order drinks, but you never venture very far. You prefer to just sit and watch. After your fourth drink, you start to feel warm and fuzzy. You relax and speak a little more freely as people approach you, but still keep your guard up with unfamiliar people.</p><p>&ldquo;You look amazing, doll,&rdquo; Bucky&rsquo;s voice purrs in your ear. He speaks loud enough for you to hear over the music. &ldquo;Having fun tonight?&rdquo;</p><p>Nodding, you smile up at him and watch his face break into a large grin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m having a blast. I&rsquo;m watching people dance and make fools of themselves.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well that does sound like a good time. Mind if I join you?&rdquo; He chuckles and sits beside you.</p><p>&ldquo;I actually was just about to go. I have to pee,&rdquo; you whisper and blush as you get to your feet. You wobble a few times before regaining your balance.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay? You gonna make it?&rdquo; He&rsquo;s laughing at you. You smile back at him and enjoy the warm feeling that settled in your stomach as soon as Bucky sat down. &ldquo;Need some help?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, Bucky. You can&rsquo;t go in with me! It&rsquo;s the LADIES room. You&rsquo;re not a lady.&rdquo; You giggle and grab his biceps to hold yourself up. Your fingers flex around his muscles and you sigh quietly, letting yourself imagine being wrapped in his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;You okay? Hello?&rdquo; Bucky wraps his arm around your waist and helps you walk to the restroom. &ldquo;There you go. I&rsquo;ll be right here, okay?&rdquo; You nod and giggle again as you walk into the bathroom. Once you&rsquo;re finished, you stumble back out and into Bucky&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;Whoa. Let&rsquo;s get you to bed. I think you party is over.&rdquo;</p><p>You nod slowly and press your lips together. They are numb. &ldquo;I can do it!&rdquo; you protest and struggle weakly against him. His arms tighten around you as he pulls you down the hallway. He stops at your room, opens the door, and gently pulls you inside. &ldquo;Thank you. You can go now,&rdquo; you whisper, your heart still stinging from your last conversation with Bucky. Your lower lip quivers as you sink onto the bed, your body sagging visibly as you realize this is your last night at the mansion. Bucky just nods, looking torn, and turns to leave. &ldquo;Bucky,&rdquo; you whisper softly and he turns.</p><p>**<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfFW9COtsR8\">Insert song now</a>**</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; He asks when he notices your lip trembling. He stands there for a moment, visibly warring with himself. &ldquo;Doll,&rdquo; he sighs and moves in front of you. He pulls you up and wraps his arms tightly around you. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be the death of me, doll,&rdquo; he whispers against your hair. You feel a soft pressure on the top of your head and realize that it&rsquo;s his lips peppering kisses against your hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t die,&rdquo; you say weakly and lean into him, breathing deeply. Memorizing his scent and the way he feels against you. Storing them in your mind so that you would never forget, no matter how long you&rsquo;re away.</p><p>Bucky leans back, but doesn&rsquo;t let you go. A broad grin stretches across his face. &ldquo;But if you&rsquo;re the death of me, Darlin&rsquo;, I wanna die.&rdquo; He kisses you, softly at first. Just light pecks against your lips. You wrap your arms around his neck and hold him against you. Bucky deepens the kiss with a quiet moan, his fingers tightening around your waist, holding you firmly against his body.</p><p>A shudder snakes up your spine as you knot your fingers in his hair and trace your tongue along his bottom lip, nipping lightly. His tongue slides into your mouth and dances with yours as you groan loudly, tugging his hair sharply. You feel a warm pooling between your legs as you grind yourself against him. He pulls away slowly, looking down at you. His pupils are dark and his breathing is shallow. &ldquo;Y/n,&rdquo; he whispers your name like a prayer. Bucky pulls you against him once more, enveloping you in a tight hug and rests his chin on the top of your head.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; You whisper breathlessly and press your ear against his chest, listening to the steady thumping of his heart.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had too much to drink. I don&rsquo;t want to do this like this. I don&rsquo;t want to do something that you&rsquo;ll regret once your sober,&rdquo; he says quietly, not letting you go.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to regret it,&rdquo; you assure him and press your lips to his clothed chest. You smile to yourself at Bucky being the perfect gentlemen. You wondered if this is how the old Bucky was. Always considerate and always the gentlemen.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he says again and steps away from you. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already messed a lot of things up, but I&rsquo;m not going to mess this up. I&rsquo;m not saying I don&rsquo;t want to!&rdquo; he reassures you when he sees your face fall. &ldquo;I just want to do it right,&rdquo; he whispers. &ldquo;Not with you tipsy and not on the night before we leave. Here.&rdquo; He hands you the pajamas that had been sitting on the edge of the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, okay. You&rsquo;re such a gentlemen,&rdquo; you say with a small smile and duck into the bathroom to change, but you leave the door slightly open. &ldquo;Hey, Bucky?&rdquo; you say after a few moments. He grunts in response. &ldquo;Even if nothing happens tonight&hellip;Can you stay here. I sleep a little better when I&rsquo;m not alone,&rdquo; you admit timidly. You pull on your sleep shirt and shorts and walk back into the bedroom.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure thing.&rdquo; Bucky starts to remove his clothes. It was at that point that you actually notice what he was wearing. Black dress pants, white dress shirt, black bow tie, and black suit jacket. His brown hair was dishevelled from your kiss earlier and his scruffy chin seems a bit more groomed. He looked so good. Bucky looks over at you and his cheeks turn a light shade of pink. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sleep in these. I&rsquo;ll roast.&rdquo; You nod an okay and he removes his shirt and pants. </p><p>Now it&rsquo;s your turn to blush as you turn away from him and giggle at the absurdity of this situation. Bucky was here, in your room, in nothing but his boxers. He climbs onto your bed and lays on top of the blankets. You turn on your fan and slip into bed beside him. &ldquo;I sleep with the fan on high, so it might get a little cold in here,&rdquo; you warn him and turn off the lamp.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll be okay,&rdquo; he responds with a yawn. </p><p>With a small smile, you roll onto your side and curl up against Bucky. He slides his metal arm under your head so you can rest your head on his chest. You sigh deeply and nuzzle your nose against him, already feeling your eyelids drooping. You feel him tense and shift his body away from you slightly. You feel him breathing and listen to the steady rhythm of his heart. Something he said earlier teases your consciousness. &ldquo;Bucky?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo; he shifts slightly so he can see you in the dark.</p><p>&ldquo;Earlier, when we were, um, kissing.&rdquo; Your cheeks heat up. &ldquo;You said we.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We?&rdquo; he asks sleepily. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. You said &lsquo;not the night before we leave,&rsquo;&rdquo; you whisper quietly and tilt your face up to look at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; he smiles softly. &ldquo;I did say that didn&rsquo;t I.&rdquo; He doesn&rsquo;t say anything else for a long while. </p><p>&ldquo;What did you mean?&rdquo; You wait for him to admit that he had just misspoken, but he remains silent. &ldquo;Are you asleep?&rdquo; You whisper and reach for his face.

I didn\u2019t think anyone else would be up here,\u201d Bucky\u2019s voice was quiet. You look up in time to see him run his fingers through his hair and start to turn away, but he stops. \u201cAre you okay? Are you crying?\u201d Bucky kneels in front of you, but you can\u2019t meet his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d you whisper and try to shift away from him. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d This seems to be your new catch phrase.</p><p>\u201cMore tests?\u201d He asks softly, tilting his head to the side. \u201cDid they find anything new? Anything helpful?\u201d</p><p>Shaking your head, you peek up at him from under your lashes and your heart squeezes painfully. \u201cNo. Everything is the same. No new news. No changes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you so upset?\u201d He pressed. His fingers flexed in front of him, but he made no move to reach out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just tired. I\u2019ve been having nightmares. I\u2019m frustrated and I cry when I\u2019m frustrated,\u201d you explain and close your eyes again. You inhale deeply through your nose and let it out through your mouth. \u201cThey want to send me to Wakanda,\u201d you whisper softly and fight back tears again.</p><p>Bucky\u2019s face falls and he leans back just a little, as if he\u2019s trying to put some space between the two of you. \u201cOh. It\u2019s a beautiful place,\u201d he offered, but he didn\u2019t sound sincere. You nod once and wipe your cheeks again. \u201cWhen do you leave?\u201d He\u2019s stoic, but you swear you hear a hint of emotion in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going,\u201d you say firmly and clench your fists. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to a strange place and have the probe around in my brain.\u201d Your lips press together suddenly and you look at him apologetically. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what? I volunteered. I knew that I needed help, and they were the best. They nearly fixed me. I still have a lot of issues to sort through on my own, but I don\u2019t feel controlled or afraid of who I am anymore.\u201d Bucky stops and looks at you for a long while before reaching out with his flesh hand and tucking a piece of hair behind your ear. \u201cMaybe you should go. If anyone can help you, they can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Bucky, I get that they helped you and it was great, but I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s wrong with me. I want to figure it out for myself before I let everyone and their brother fuck around in my brain.\u201d You almost lean into his hand, but stop yourself. Longing for his touch is something that you try not to do because it is too painful. pulling yourself together, you start to stand.</p><p>Bucky reaches out suddenly and grabs your wrist gently. \u201cWait. I didn\u2019t mean to push you. Stay. We can talk a little bit.\u201d He smiles, but it doesn\u2019t touch his eyes. \u201cTo get your mind off of everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d And it isn\u2019t a good idea. Every time you look at him, you want to lean forward those few inches and kiss him again and again, but you know that you\u2019re heart can\u2019t take it at this fragile time in your life.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Bucky scoffs, trying to hide the hurt in his voice. \u201cWe\u2019re friends, right? We can sit and talk about things like civilized people, can\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could,\u201d you agree cautiously. \u201cBut I still don\u2019t think I can.\u201d Biting your lip, you turn to walk away, but Bucky doesn\u2019t let go of your arm. \u201cBucky, come on.\u201d You pull your arm, but his grip tightens. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d He demands. \u201cDo you have somewhere else you need to be? Got a hot date or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t.\u201d With a sigh of defeat, you sink back to the ground beside him. There were several valid reasons that you could think of, but none of them you could tell him. \u201cFine. What do you want to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite song?\u201d He asks suddenly, randomly. He smirks at your expression.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re going to play 20 questions then?\u201d He nods once. \u201cAlright then.\u201d</p><p>You answer all of his questions and he answers all of yours. The two of you sit and talk for hours, laughing at bad jokes and stories from the past. You let yourself relax a little and open up to Bucky and he does the same. It felt good to just sit and talk to someone, the conversation aimless. No purpose or double meaning. Just two people getting to know each other.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel better?\u201d Bucky asks after you stop laughing from his story of Coney Island and Steve getting sick on the rides. </p><p>Nodding slowly, you notice just how relaxed you feel. The knots in your stomach or gone and the ache in your chest is dull, barely noticable. \u201cI do actually. I think this is the longest conversation I\u2019ve had in awhile. I feel almost human again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean,\u201d he chuckles and you forget to breathe. The sound of his laugh only makes you ache for him even more. He shifts his weight from where he is sitting beside you, pulling one of his knees to his chest and leaving his other leg extended. His leg and arm bump against your side a few times, bringing chill bumps to your skin despite the warm weather. \u201cHey listen\u2026\u201d He stops talking and fidgets with a spot on his dark jeans.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d warily, you cut your eyes at him and bite your lip.</p><p>\u201cI, uh, I think you should really consider going to Wakanda for a while,\u201d Bucky says slowly, not looking at you.</p><p>It felt as though you\u2019ve \u00a0been kicked in the gut. The dull ache in your chest erupts into white hot pain. Your eyes start to burn again as tears start to form. Of course he thought you should go to Wakanda. You were broken and needed some serious fixing. No one wanted to deal with your issues here. Wiping your face before he can see your tears, you sniff once. \u201cRight. That\u2019s great, James, thanks for your input,\u201d you snap and turn away from him.</p><p>\u201cNo! That\u2019s not what\u2026 I didn\u2019t mean to\u2026\u201d He was searching for the right words, but couldn\u2019t seem to find any. \u201cI think it would be good for you to get away from this place for a while. Everything has been quite and we haven\u2019t had a mission in weeks. Tony would be happy to let you borrow a jet for a while. Maybe not without supervision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he tell you to say that? Is that why you\u2019re here and why you wanted to talk to me? Did Tony put you up to this?\u201d Unbelievable. You didn\u2019t bother trying to hide your anger.</p><p>\u201cGeez, y/n, no! I just wanted to talk to you because I haven\u2019t seen you in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see me everyday,\u201d you retort bitterly.</p><p>\u201cYes, but you haven\u2019t been you. I just wanted to see you and talk to the old you.\u201d He lets out a long sigh and stands. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to push you. I just think you\u2019ll enjoy it. I know I wouldn\u2019t mind going back to Wakanda for a while,\u201d Bucky admits after a long pause.</p><p>\u201cThen come with me,\u201d you say suddenly and turn to face him. \u201cI\u2019ll go\u2026 But I want you to come with me.\u201d It was a long shot, but maybe if you didn\u2019t go alone it wouldn\u2019t be as bad. If you had someone to talk to, someone you knew well, maybe you wouldn\u2019t feel so isolated.</p><p>\u201cY/n,\u201d he whispers and closes his eyes. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you feel more comfortable with Wanda or Nat going? I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m the guy for that.\u201d Bucky pauses again, shifting uncomfortably. \u201cListen, Y/n, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking\u2026 But I\u2019m not the guy for you.\u201d</p><p>The ache in your chest surged again. It was an overwhelming throbbing now, something that you could no longer ignore. Nodding your head, you stand up so suddenly that you almost knock Bucky over. \u201cOkay. I get it. Message received.\u201d Your voice broke as tears begin to flow down you face. \u201cSorry,\u201d you whisper and bolt for the door. \u201cThanks for talking to me, Bucky,\u201d you call over your shoulder. Without a second glance, you disappear.</p><p>If you had looked back, you would have seen the pain and regret painted on Bucky\u2019s face. You would have seen how his fists were clenched at his sides and how his eyes glistened just a little. And how his breathing was shallow, like he couldn\u2019t take a deep breath because it hurt too much. You would have seen that his words were a lie, but you never turned around.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cOkay, Stark, I\u2019ll go.\u201d You are standing in the doorway of his lab, fidgeting with a small tear on the pocket of your jeans.</p><p>Tony looks up, shocked but pleased, and sets his tools down. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll regret this. You can stay as long as you\u2019d like or leave as soon as you want. I\u2019ll confirm everything. Suri will be excited that she\u2019ll have something meaningful to do now.\u201d He leaves the room, muttering to himself.</p><p>You try to convince yourself that you had made the right decision, but you still didn\u2019t feel great about it. Taking a deep breath, you head to your room to hide from reality for a while.</p><p>***</p><p>You shift in front of the mirror, tugging at the hem of your dress again, trying to get the fabric to lay right. Your hair fell in soft waves down your shoulders, and your makeup was minimal but affected.</p><p>\u201cYou look fine! Come on the party started half an hour ago!\u201d Wanda says with a heavy sigh. \u201cTony is throwing this party for you, you know, you should at least show up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Tony would through a party for any reason! My leaving is just the most recent event that warrants some big gathering in his opinion,\u201d you mutter and tuck your hair behind your ears. Casting one more look over your shoulder, you follow Wanda out of the room and toward the sound of people laughing and music playing. \u201cOh my gosh,\u201d you whisper as you walk through the door. There were hundreds of people milling around, talking and dancing and laughing. \u201cI\u2019m going to need a drink.\u201d Wanda nods as you push through the throngs of people trying to get to the bar.</p><p>\u201cWow! You look fantastic! You sure clean up good!\u201d Sam whistled and laughs when you approach where he is sitting at the bar. \u201cLeave it to Tony to turn a goodbye party into a several hundred people event!\u201d He sweeps his arms out, gesturing around the room.</p><p>\u201cThanks. And yeah. I know. I actually was expecting this, but it still doesn\u2019t make me feel any better.\u201d You sit beside Sam and order a drink. The bartender pours it and hands it to you immediately. \u201cThanks,\u201d you mutter and turn to survey the room. The music was pulsating, but it wasn\u2019t really loud. It was more like constant background noise. People were dancing in the center of the room, shouting and laughing loudly. Some people even appeared to be drunk already.</p><p>\u201cHey, Sam. Y/n,\u201d Steve greets you with a smile and a hug. \u201cPacked and ready to go?\u201d You nod and he smiles even wider, like he\u2019s got a secret that he\u2019s dying to tell. \u201cGood. Have you guys seen Bucky? He was supposed to train with me before the party, but I haven\u2019t seen him all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo I haven\u2019t seen him since we talked two days ago,\u201d you admit sheepishly and scan the room, looking for the super soldier. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s around here somewhere. I didn\u2019t figure he would come tonight because of all the people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t think he\u2019d miss this,\u201d Sam mutters under his breath. Steve elbows Sam in the ribs and chuckles. You look at both of them curiously but say nothing. \u201cWell, this has been a fun talk, but I\u2019m going to go dance now. Care to join me?\u201d Sam asks looking over at you.</p><p>\u201cOh no. I don\u2019t dance. And I don\u2019t do well with large crowds. I\u2019m going to stay right here and people watch.\u201d You take a sip of your drink and Sam shrugs, disappearing into the sea of people. </p><p>Steve shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m going to go find Tony.\u201d He too disappears into the crowd, leaving you alone at the bar. Tilting back the glass, you down the rest of your drink and signal the bartender for another one. </p><p>You smile and hold polite conversations with several people that pass by or stop to order drinks, but you never venture very far. You prefer to just sit and watch. After your fourth drink, you start to feel warm and fuzzy. You relax and speak a little more freely as people approach you, but still keep your guard up with unfamiliar people.</p><p>\u201cYou look amazing, doll,\u201d Bucky\u2019s voice purrs in your ear. He speaks loud enough for you to hear over the music. \u201cHaving fun tonight?\u201d</p><p>Nodding, you smile up at him and watch his face break into a large grin. \u201cI\u2019m having a blast. I\u2019m watching people dance and make fools of themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell that does sound like a good time. Mind if I join you?\u201d He chuckles and sits beside you.</p><p>\u201cI actually was just about to go. I have to pee,\u201d you whisper and blush as you get to your feet. You wobble a few times before regaining your balance.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay? You gonna make it?\u201d He\u2019s laughing at you. You smile back at him and enjoy the warm feeling that settled in your stomach as soon as Bucky sat down. \u201cNeed some help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, Bucky. You can\u2019t go in with me! It\u2019s the LADIES room. You\u2019re not a lady.\u201d You giggle and grab his biceps to hold yourself up. Your fingers flex around his muscles and you sigh quietly, letting yourself imagine being wrapped in his arms.</p><p>\u201cYou okay? Hello?\u201d Bucky wraps his arm around your waist and helps you walk to the restroom. \u201cThere you go. I\u2019ll be right here, okay?\u201d You nod and giggle again as you walk into the bathroom. Once you\u2019re finished, you stumble back out and into Bucky\u2019s arms. \u201cWhoa. Let\u2019s get you to bed. I think you party is over.\u201d</p><p>You nod slowly and press your lips together. They are numb. \u201cI can do it!\u201d you protest and struggle weakly against him. His arms tighten around you as he pulls you down the hallway. He stops at your room, opens the door, and gently pulls you inside. \u201cThank you. You can go now,\u201d you whisper, your heart still stinging from your last conversation with Bucky. Your lower lip quivers as you sink onto the bed, your body sagging visibly as you realize this is your last night at the mansion. Bucky just nods, looking torn, and turns to leave. \u201cBucky,\u201d you whisper softly and he turns.</p><p>**<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfFW9COtsR8\">Insert song now</a>**</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He asks when he notices your lip trembling. He stands there for a moment, visibly warring with himself. \u201cDoll,\u201d he sighs and moves in front of you. He pulls you up and wraps his arms tightly around you. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be the death of me, doll,\u201d he whispers against your hair. You feel a soft pressure on the top of your head and realize that it\u2019s his lips peppering kisses against your hair.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t die,\u201d you say weakly and lean into him, breathing deeply. Memorizing his scent and the way he feels against you. Storing them in your mind so that you would never forget, no matter how long you\u2019re away.</p><p>Bucky leans back, but doesn\u2019t let you go. A broad grin stretches across his face. \u201cBut if you\u2019re the death of me, Darlin\u2019, I wanna die.\u201d He kisses you, softly at first. Just light pecks against your lips. You wrap your arms around his neck and hold him against you. Bucky deepens the kiss with a quiet moan, his fingers tightening around your waist, holding you firmly against his body.</p><p>A shudder snakes up your spine as you knot your fingers in his hair and trace your tongue along his bottom lip, nipping lightly. His tongue slides into your mouth and dances with yours as you groan loudly, tugging his hair sharply. You feel a warm pooling between your legs as you grind yourself against him. He pulls away slowly, looking down at you. His pupils are dark and his breathing is shallow. \u201cY/n,\u201d he whispers your name like a prayer. Bucky pulls you against him once more, enveloping you in a tight hug and rests his chin on the top of your head.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d You whisper breathlessly and press your ear against his chest, listening to the steady thumping of his heart.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had too much to drink. I don\u2019t want to do this like this. I don\u2019t want to do something that you\u2019ll regret once your sober,\u201d he says quietly, not letting you go.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to regret it,\u201d you assure him and press your lips to his clothed chest. You smile to yourself at Bucky being the perfect gentlemen. You wondered if this is how the old Bucky was. Always considerate and always the gentlemen.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says again and steps away from you. \u201cI\u2019ve already messed a lot of things up, but I\u2019m not going to mess this up. I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t want to!\u201d he reassures you when he sees your face fall. \u201cI just want to do it right,\u201d he whispers. \u201cNot with you tipsy and not on the night before we leave. Here.\u201d He hands you the pajamas that had been sitting on the edge of the bed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. You\u2019re such a gentlemen,\u201d you say with a small smile and duck into the bathroom to change, but you leave the door slightly open. \u201cHey, Bucky?\u201d you say after a few moments. He grunts in response. \u201cEven if nothing happens tonight\u2026Can you stay here. I sleep a little better when I\u2019m not alone,\u201d you admit timidly. You pull on your sleep shirt and shorts and walk back into the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d Bucky starts to remove his clothes. It was at that point that you actually notice what he was wearing. Black dress pants, white dress shirt, black bow tie, and black suit jacket. His brown hair was dishevelled from your kiss earlier and his scruffy chin seems a bit more groomed. He looked so good. Bucky looks over at you and his cheeks turn a light shade of pink. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep in these. I\u2019ll roast.\u201d You nod an okay and he removes his shirt and pants. </p><p>Now it\u2019s your turn to blush as you turn away from him and giggle at the absurdity of this situation. Bucky was here, in your room, in nothing but his boxers. He climbs onto your bed and lays on top of the blankets. You turn on your fan and slip into bed beside him. \u201cI sleep with the fan on high, so it might get a little cold in here,\u201d you warn him and turn off the lamp.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll be okay,\u201d he responds with a yawn. </p><p>With a small smile, you roll onto your side and curl up against Bucky. He slides his metal arm under your head so you can rest your head on his chest. You sigh deeply and nuzzle your nose against him, already feeling your eyelids drooping. You feel him tense and shift his body away from you slightly. You feel him breathing and listen to the steady rhythm of his heart. Something he said earlier teases your consciousness. \u201cBucky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d he shifts slightly so he can see you in the dark.</p><p>\u201cEarlier, when we were, um, kissing.\u201d Your cheeks heat up. \u201cYou said we.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d he asks sleepily. </p><p>\u201cYeah. You said \u2018not the night before we leave,\u2019\u201d you whisper quietly and tilt your face up to look at him.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d he smiles softly. \u201cI did say that didn\u2019t I.\u201d He doesn\u2019t say anything else for a long while. </p><p>\u201cWhat did you mean?\u201d You wait for him to admit that he had just misspoken, but he remains silent. \u201cAre you asleep?\u201d You whisper and reach for his face. Your fingers ghost along his chin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m awake,\u201d he whispers back. \u201cI said we because I\u2019m going with you. I talked to Tony and packed my bags today. Unless\u2026\u201d he leans his face into your palm. \u201cUnless you changed your mind and don\u2019t want me to go anymore.\u201d</p><p>You can hear the smile in his voice. \u201cNo. I\u2019m happy you\u2019re going with me,\u201d you whisper with a yawn. You fall asleep with a smile on your face.</p><p><br></p><h2>TAGLIST:\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNwV7ZLuGfRzK7Y0vPCz2rg\">@ivartheblessed</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgysIoWRLnQ9YY2enUhxotQ\">@hadesgirl1015</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFmpGRjCwmu-OpV-wKJ_kwA\">@yafriendlyfangirl</a></h2></p>",

It seems to be a never ending cycle.</p><p>You sit upright in a white plush chair in one of the many labs in the mansion. Bruce and Tony are in the next room over, but you can see them through the wall of glass separating you. Their heads are close together and bent over the mass of computer screens. With a sigh, you shift uncomfortably, trying not to dislodge the IV that was sticking in your arm. Bruce runs his fingers through his hair and glances up at you with a forced smile. Your stomach drops and you close your eyes, trying to block everything out as you sit in silence.</p><p>It had been two weeks since the attack on the mansion. Two weeks since you had your first meltdown, but it wasn\u2019t the only one. You had been plagued with nightmares every night since then. Broken fragments of memories that you couldn\u2019t quite place but felt familiar all the same. Unnamed fears that crippled your entire body and threatened loss of consciousness. All of these things were also accompanied by anger and heartache.</p><p>The anger came from so many things. Not understanding yourself anymore, not being able to control yourself, not trusting yourself around the team anymore, not being able to read Bucky, being treated as a lab rat, the list goes on and on. But the heartache, that mainly comes from knowing that you have feelings for Bucky that are not reciprocated. Knowing that he only wants to use you for a release and nothing more, and what\u2019s worse, you\u2019re considering letting him.</p><p>\u201cAlright. I think we\u2019re done for the day.\u201d Tony steps into the room with a bag of blueberries. \u201cYou doing okay?\u201d You nod, but keep your eyes closed, fighting off the nausea that is building in your stomach, as he removes the IV. \u201cEverything looks good. We\u2019ve isolated a few more genomes from your DNA. It would probably be better if you go to -\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not going to Wakanda for the panthers to dissect my brain and probe around in there,\u201d you say tightly and squeeze your eyes even tighter.</p><p>\u201cIt worked so well for James. If you would just consider it,\u201d Bruce says quietly. You hadn\u2019t heard him come in. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay there forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d You say again and hop off the chair. \u201cI\u2019m fine right where I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh sure. Your nightmares are getting worse. You hardly sleep. You walk around like a member of the Walking Dead, and you are training so brutally I\u2019ve had to replace most of the equipment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know it was me? It could have been Steve or Bucky on a bad day,\u201d you say weakly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, okay, I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m such a fucked up mess.\u201d You storm out of the room without another word. Your stomach churns angrily as you climb the stairs two at a time, heading toward the south side of the roof. Your favorite spot because it overlooks the river. </p><p>You lean your back against the wall and slide to the ground, pressing your forehead against your knees. Silent tears slide down your cheeks as your mind races. The dull ache blooms in your chest as your fingers curl around your ankles and take a shaky breath. The sound of footsteps causes you to jump and hastily wipe your face with your sleeve.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cOh. Sorry. I didn\u2019t think anyone else would be up here,\u201d Bucky\u2019s voice was quiet. You look up in time to see him run his fingers through his hair and start to turn away, but he stops. \u201cAre you okay? Are you crying?\u201d Bucky kneels in front of you, but you can\u2019t meet his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d you whisper and try to shift away from him. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d This seems to be your new catch phrase.</p><p>\u201cMore tests?\u201d He asks softly, tilting his head to the side. \u201cDid they find anything new? Anything helpful?\u201d</p><p>Shaking your head, you peek up at him from under your lashes and your heart squeezes painfully. \u201cNo. Everything is the same. No new news. No changes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you so upset?\u201d He pressed. His fingers flexed in front of him, but he made no move to reach out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just tired. I\u2019ve been having nightmares. I\u2019m frustrated and I cry when I\u2019m frustrated,\u201d you explain and close your eyes again. You inhale deeply through your nose and let it out through your mouth. \u201cThey want to send me to Wakanda,\u201d you whisper softly and fight back tears again.</p><p>Bucky\u2019s face falls and he leans back just a little, as if he\u2019s trying to put some space between the two of you. \u201cOh. It\u2019s a beautiful place,\u201d he offered, but he didn\u2019t sound sincere. You nod once and wipe your cheeks again. \u201cWhen do you leave?\u201d He\u2019s stoic, but you swear you hear a hint of emotion in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going,\u201d you say firmly and clench your fists. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to a strange place and have the probe around in my brain.\u201d Your lips press together suddenly and you look at him apologetically. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what? I volunteered. I knew that I needed help, and they were the best. They nearly fixed me. I still have a lot of issues to sort through on my own, but I don\u2019t feel controlled or afraid of who I am anymore.\u201d Bucky stops and looks at you for a long while before reaching out with his flesh hand and tucking a piece of hair behind your ear. \u201cMaybe you should go. If anyone can help you, they can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Bucky, I get that they helped you and it was great, but I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s wrong with me. I want to figure it out for myself before I let everyone and their brother fuck around in my brain.\u201d You almost lean into his hand, but stop yourself. Longing for his touch is something that you try not to do because it is too painful. pulling yourself together, you start to stand.</p><p>Bucky reaches out suddenly and grabs your wrist gently. \u201cWait. I didn\u2019t mean to push you. Stay. We can talk a little bit.\u201d He smiles, but it doesn\u2019t touch his eyes. \u201cTo get your mind off of everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d And it isn\u2019t a good idea. Every time you look at him, you want to lean forward those few inches and kiss him again and again, but you know that you\u2019re heart can\u2019t take it at this fragile time in your life.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Bucky scoffs, trying to hide the hurt in his voice. \u201cWe\u2019re friends, right? We can sit and talk about things like civilized people, can\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could,\u201d you agree cautiously. \u201cBut I still don\u2019t think I can.\u201d Biting your lip, you turn to walk away, but Bucky doesn\u2019t let go of your arm. \u201cBucky, come on.\u201d You pull your arm, but his grip tightens. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d He demands. \u201cDo you have somewhere else you need to be? Got a hot date or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t.\u201d With a sigh of defeat, you sink back to the ground beside him. There were several valid reasons that you could think of, but none of them you could tell him. \u201cFine. What do you want to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite song?\u201d He asks suddenly, randomly. He smirks at your expression.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re going to play 20 questions then?\u201d He nods once. \u201cAlright then.\u201d</p><p>You answer all of his questions and he answers all of yours. The two of you sit and talk for hours, laughing at bad jokes and stories from the past. You let yourself relax a little and open up to Bucky and he does the same. It felt good to just sit and talk to someone, the conversation aimless. No purpose or double meaning. Just two people getting to know each other.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel better?\u201d Bucky asks after you stop laughing from his story of Coney Island and Steve getting sick on the rides. </p><p>Nodding slowly, you notice just how relaxed you feel. The knots in your stomach or gone and the ache in your chest is dull, barely noticable. \u201cI do actually. I think this is the longest conversation I\u2019ve had in awhile. I feel almost human again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean,\u201d he chuckles and you forget to breathe. The sound of his laugh only makes you ache for him even more. He shifts his weight from where he is sitting beside you, pulling one of his knees to his chest and leaving his other leg extended. His leg and arm bump against your side a few times, bringing chill bumps to your skin despite the warm weather. \u201cHey listen\u2026\u201d He stops talking and fidgets with a spot on his dark jeans.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d warily, you cut your eyes at him and bite your lip.</p><p>\u201cI, uh, I think you should really consider going to Wakanda for a while,\u201d Bucky says slowly, not looking at you.</p><p>It felt as though you\u2019ve \u00a0been kicked in the gut. The dull ache in your chest erupts into white hot pain. Your eyes start to burn again as tears start to form. Of course he thought you should go to Wakanda. You were broken and needed some serious fixing. No one wanted to deal with your issues here. Wiping your face before he can see your tears, you sniff once. \u201cRight. That\u2019s great, James, thanks for your input,\u201d you snap and turn away from him.</p><p>\u201cNo! That\u2019s not what\u2026 I didn\u2019t mean to\u2026\u201d He was searching for the right words, but couldn\u2019t seem to find any. \u201cI think it would be good for you to get away from this place for a while. Everything has been quite and we haven\u2019t had a mission in weeks. Tony would be happy to let you borrow a jet for a while. Maybe not without supervision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he tell you to say that? Is that why you\u2019re here and why you wanted to talk to me? Did Tony put you up to this?\u201d Unbelievable. You didn\u2019t bother trying to hide your anger.</p><p>\u201cGeez, y/n, no! I just wanted to talk to you because I haven\u2019t seen you in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see me everyday,\u201d you retort bitterly.</p><p>\u201cYes, but you haven\u2019t been you. I just wanted to see you and talk to the old you.\u201d He lets out a long sigh and stands. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to push you. I just think you\u2019ll enjoy it. I know I wouldn\u2019t mind going back to Wakanda for a while,\u201d Bucky admits after a long pause.</p><p>\u201cThen come with me,\u201d you say suddenly and turn to face him. \u201cI\u2019ll go\u2026 But I want you to come with me.\u201d It was a long shot, but maybe if you didn\u2019t go alone it wouldn\u2019t be as bad. If you had someone to talk to, someone you knew well, maybe you wouldn\u2019t feel so isolated.</p><p>\u201cY/n,\u201d he whispers and closes his eyes. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you feel more comfortable with Wanda or Nat going? I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m the guy for that.\u201d Bucky pauses again, shifting uncomfortably. \u201cListen, Y/n, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking\u2026 But I\u2019m not the guy for you.\u201d</p><p>The ache in your chest surged again. It was an overwhelming throbbing now, something that you could no longer ignore. Nodding your head, you stand up so suddenly that you almost knock Bucky over. \u201cOkay. I get it. Message received.\u201d Your voice broke as tears begin to flow down you face. \u201cSorry,\u201d you whisper and bolt for the door. \u201cThanks for talking to me, Bucky,\u201d you call over your shoulder. Without a second glance, you disappear.</p><p>If you had looked back, you would have seen the pain and regret painted on Bucky\u2019s face. You would have seen how his fists were clenched at his sides and how his eyes glistened just a little. And how his breathing was shallow, like he couldn\u2019t take a deep breath because it hurt too much. You would have seen that his words were a lie, but you never turned around.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cOkay, Stark, I\u2019ll go.\u201d You are standing in the doorway of his lab, fidgeting with a small tear on the pocket of your jeans.</p><p>Tony looks up, shocked but pleased, and sets his tools down. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll regret this. You can stay as long as you\u2019d like or leave as soon as you want. I\u2019ll confirm everything. Suri will be excited that she\u2019ll have something meaningful to do now.\u201d He leaves the room, muttering to himself.</p><p>You try to convince yourself that you had made the right decision, but you still didn\u2019t feel great about it. Taking a deep breath, you head to your room to hide from reality for a while.</p><p>***</p><p>You shift in front of the mirror, tugging at the hem of your dress again, trying to get the fabric to lay right. Your hair fell in soft waves down your shoulders, and your makeup was minimal but affected.</p><p>\u201cYou look fine! Come on the party started half an hour ago!\u201d Wanda says with a heavy sigh. \u201cTony is throwing this party for you, you know, you should at least show up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Tony would through a party for any reason! My leaving is just the most recent event that warrants some big gathering in his opinion,\u201d you mutter and tuck your hair behind your ears. Casting one more look over your shoulder, you follow Wanda out of the room and toward the sound of people laughing and music playing. \u201cOh my gosh,\u201d you whisper as you walk through the door. There were hundreds of people milling around, talking and dancing and laughing. \u201cI\u2019m going to need a drink.\u201d Wanda nods as you push through the throngs of people trying to get to the bar.</p><p>\u201cWow! You look fantastic! You sure clean up good!\u201d Sam whistled and laughs when you approach where he is sitting at the bar. \u201cLeave it to Tony to turn a goodbye party into a several hundred people event!\u201d He sweeps his arms out, gesturing around the room.</p><p>\u201cThanks. And yeah. I know. I actually was expecting this, but it still doesn\u2019t make me feel any better.\u201d You sit beside Sam and order a drink. The bartender pours it and hands it to you immediately. \u201cThanks,\u201d you mutter and turn to survey the room. The music was pulsating, but it wasn\u2019t really loud. It was more like constant background noise. People were dancing in the center of the room, shouting and laughing loudly. Some people even appeared to be drunk already.</p><p>\u201cHey, Sam. Y/n,\u201d Steve greets you with a smile and a hug. \u201cPacked and ready to go?\u201d You nod and he smiles even wider, like he\u2019s got a secret that he\u2019s dying to tell. \u201cGood. Have you guys seen Bucky? He was supposed to train with me before the party, but I haven\u2019t seen him all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo I haven\u2019t seen him since we talked two days ago,\u201d you admit sheepishly and scan the room, looking for the super soldier. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s around here somewhere. I didn\u2019t figure he would come tonight because of all the people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t think he\u2019d miss this,\u201d Sam mutters under his breath. Steve elbows Sam in the ribs and chuckles. You look at both of them curiously but say nothing. \u201cWell, this has been a fun talk, but I\u2019m going to go dance now. Care to join me?\u201d Sam asks looking over at you.</p><p>\u201cOh no. I don\u2019t dance. And I don\u2019t do well with large crowds. I\u2019m going to stay right here and people watch.\u201d You take a sip of your drink and Sam shrugs, disappearing into the sea of people. </p><p>Steve shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m going to go find Tony.\u201d He too disappears into the crowd, leaving you alone at the bar. Tilting back the glass, you down the rest of your drink and signal the bartender for another one. </p><p>You smile and hold polite conversations with several people that pass by or stop to order drinks, but you never venture very far. You prefer to just sit and watch. After your fourth drink, you start to feel warm and fuzzy. You relax and speak a little more freely as people approach you, but still keep your guard up with unfamiliar people.</p><p>\u201cYou look amazing, doll,\u201d Bucky\u2019s voice purrs in your ear. He speaks loud enough for you to hear over the music. \u201cHaving fun tonight?\u201d</p><p>Nodding, you smile up at him and watch his face break into a large grin. \u201cI\u2019m having a blast. I\u2019m watching people dance and make fools of themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell that does sound like a good time. Mind if I join you?\u201d He chuckles and sits beside you.</p><p>\u201cI actually was just about to go. I have to pee,\u201d you whisper and blush as you get to your feet. You wobble a few times before regaining your balance.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay? You gonna make it?\u201d He\u2019s laughing at you. You smile back at him and enjoy the warm feeling that settled in your stomach as soon as Bucky sat down. \u201cNeed some help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, Bucky. You can\u2019t go in with me! It\u2019s the LADIES room. You\u2019re not a lady.\u201d You giggle and grab his biceps to hold yourself up. Your fingers flex around his muscles and you sigh quietly, letting yourself imagine being wrapped in his arms.</p><p>\u201cYou okay? Hello?\u201d Bucky wraps his arm around your waist and helps you walk to the restroom. \u201cThere you go. I\u2019ll be right here, okay?\u201d You nod and giggle again as you walk into the bathroom. Once you\u2019re finished, you stumble back out and into Bucky\u2019s arms. \u201cWhoa. Let\u2019s get you to bed. I think you party is over.\u201d</p><p>You nod slowly and press your lips together. They are numb. \u201cI can do it!\u201d you protest and struggle weakly against him. His arms tighten around you as he pulls you down the hallway. He stops at your room, opens the door, and gently pulls you inside. \u201cThank you. You can go now,\u201d you whisper, your heart still stinging from your last conversation with Bucky. Your lower lip quivers as you sink onto the bed, your body sagging visibly as you realize this is your last night at the mansion. Bucky just nods, looking torn, and turns to leave. \u201cBucky,\u201d you whisper softly and he turns.</p><p>**<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfFW9COtsR8\">Insert song now</a>**</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He asks when he notices your lip trembling. He stands there for a moment, visibly warring with himself. \u201cDoll,\u201d he sighs and moves in front of you. He pulls you up and wraps his arms tightly around you. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be the death of me, doll,\u201d he whispers against your hair. You feel a soft pressure on the top of your head and realize that it\u2019s his lips peppering kisses against your hair.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t die,\u201d you say weakly and lean into him, breathing deeply. Memorizing his scent and the way he feels against you. Storing them in your mind so that you would never forget, no matter how long you\u2019re away.</p><p>Bucky leans back, but doesn\u2019t let you go. A broad grin stretches across his face. \u201cBut if you\u2019re the death of me, Darlin\u2019, I wanna die.\u201d He kisses you, softly at first. Just light pecks against your lips. You wrap your arms around his neck and hold him against you. Bucky deepens the kiss with a quiet moan, his fingers tightening around your waist, holding you firmly against his body.</p><p>A shudder snakes up your spine as you knot your fingers in his hair and trace your tongue along his bottom lip, nipping lightly. His tongue slides into your mouth and dances with yours as you groan loudly, tugging his hair sharply. You feel a warm pooling between your legs as you grind yourself against him. He pulls away slowly, looking down at you. His pupils are dark and his breathing is shallow. \u201cY/n,\u201d he whispers your name like a prayer. Bucky pulls you against him once more, enveloping you in a tight hug and rests his chin on the top of your head.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d You whisper breathlessly and press your ear against his chest, listening to the steady thumping of his heart.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had too much to drink. I don\u2019t want to do this like this. I don\u2019t want to do something that you\u2019ll regret once your sober,\u201d he says quietly, not letting you go.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to regret it,\u201d you assure him and press your lips to his clothed chest. You smile to yourself at Bucky being the perfect gentlemen. You wondered if this is how the old Bucky was. Always considerate and always the gentlemen.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says again and steps away from you. \u201cI\u2019ve already messed a lot of things up, but I\u2019m not going to mess this up. I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t want to!\u201d he reassures you when he sees your face fall. \u201cI just want to do it right,\u201d he whispers. \u201cNot with you tipsy and not on the night before we leave. Here.\u201d He hands you the pajamas that had been sitting on the edge of the bed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. You\u2019re such a gentlemen,\u201d you say with a small smile and duck into the bathroom to change, but you leave the door slightly open. \u201cHey, Bucky?\u201d you say after a few moments. He grunts in response. \u201cEven if nothing happens tonight\u2026Can you stay here. I sleep a little better when I\u2019m not alone,\u201d you admit timidly. You pull on your sleep shirt and shorts and walk back into the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d Bucky starts to remove his clothes. It was at that point that you actually notice what he was wearing. Black dress pants, white dress shirt, black bow tie, and black suit jacket. His brown hair was dishevelled from your kiss earlier and his scruffy chin seems a bit more groomed. He looked so good. Bucky looks over at you and his cheeks turn a light shade of pink. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep in these. I\u2019ll roast.\u201d You nod an okay and he removes his shirt and pants. </p><p>Now it\u2019s your turn to blush as you turn away from him and giggle at the absurdity of this situation. Bucky was here, in your room, in nothing but his boxers. He climbs onto your bed and lays on top of the blankets. You turn on your fan and slip into bed beside him. \u201cI sleep with the fan on high, so it might get a little cold in here,\u201d you warn him and turn off the lamp.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll be okay,\u201d he responds with a yawn. </p><p>With a small smile, you roll onto your side and curl up against Bucky. He slides his metal arm under your head so you can rest your head on his chest. You sigh deeply and nuzzle your nose against him, already feeling your eyelids drooping. You feel him tense and shift his body away from you slightly. You feel him breathing and listen to the steady rhythm of his heart. Something he said earlier teases your consciousness. \u201cBucky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d he shifts slightly so he can see you in the dark.</p><p>\u201cEarlier, when we were, um, kissing.\u201d Your cheeks heat up. \u201cYou said we.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d he asks sleepily. </p><p>\u201cYeah. You said \u2018not the night before we leave,\u2019\u201d you whisper quietly and tilt your face up to look at him.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d he smiles softly. \u201cI did say that didn\u2019t I.\u201d He doesn\u2019t say anything else for a long while. </p><p>\u201cWhat did you mean?\u201d You wait for him to admit that he had just misspoken, but he remains silent. \u201cAre you asleep?\u201d You whisper and reach for his face. Your fingers ghost along his chin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m awake,\u201d he whispers back. \u201cI said we because I\u2019m going with you. I talked to Tony and packed my bags today. Unless\u2026\u201d he leans his face into your palm. \u201cUnless you changed your mind and don\u2019t want me to go anymore.\u201d</p><p>You can hear the smile in his voice. \u201cNo. I\u2019m happy you\u2019re going with me,\u201d you whisper with a yawn. You fall asleep with a smile on your face.</p><p><br></p><h2>TAGLIST:\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNwV7ZLuGfRzK7Y0vPCz2rg\">@ivartheblessed</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgysIoWRLnQ9YY2enUhxotQ\">@hadesgirl1015</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFmpGRjCwmu-OpV-wKJ_kwA\">@yafriendlyfangirl</a></h2></p>",

Some angst and some fluff.</p><p><b>WC: 4k</b></p><p>There is one part at the end that I had this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfFW9COtsR8\">song</a> playing in my head the entire time. I&rsquo;ll post the link again at the spot in the story. Hope you guys like it! Tag list is open!<br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>Deep breath in. Hold it. Release. Repeat.</p><p>Over and over. It seems to be a never ending cycle.</p><p>You sit upright in a white plush chair in one of the many labs in the mansion. Bruce and Tony are in the next room over, but you can see them through the wall of glass separating you. Their heads are close together and bent over the mass of computer screens. With a sigh, you shift uncomfortably, trying not to dislodge the IV that was sticking in your arm. Bruce runs his fingers through his hair and glances up at you with a forced smile. Your stomach drops and you close your eyes, trying to block everything out as you sit in silence.</p><p>It had been two weeks since the attack on the mansion. Two weeks since you had your first meltdown, but it wasn&rsquo;t the only one. You had been plagued with nightmares every night since then. Broken fragments of memories that you couldn&rsquo;t quite place but felt familiar all the same. Unnamed fears that crippled your entire body and threatened loss of consciousness. All of these things were also accompanied by anger and heartache.</p><p>The anger came from so many things. Not understanding yourself anymore, not being able to control yourself, not trusting yourself around the team anymore, not being able to read Bucky, being treated as a lab rat, the list goes on and on. But the heartache, that mainly comes from knowing that you have feelings for Bucky that are not reciprocated. Knowing that he only wants to use you for a release and nothing more, and what&rsquo;s worse, you&rsquo;re considering letting him.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright. I think we&rsquo;re done for the day.&rdquo; Tony steps into the room with a bag of blueberries. &ldquo;You doing okay?&rdquo; You nod, but keep your eyes closed, fighting off the nausea that is building in your stomach, as he removes the IV. &ldquo;Everything looks good. We&rsquo;ve isolated a few more genomes from your DNA. It would probably be better if you go to -&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m not going to Wakanda for the panthers to dissect my brain and probe around in there,&rdquo; you say tightly and squeeze your eyes even tighter.</p><p>&ldquo;It worked so well for James. If you would just consider it,&rdquo; Bruce says quietly. You hadn&rsquo;t heard him come in. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to stay there forever.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; You say again and hop off the chair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine right where I am.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh sure. Your nightmares are getting worse. You hardly sleep. You walk around like a member of the Walking Dead, and you are training so brutally I&rsquo;ve had to replace most of the equipment.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you know it was me? It could have been Steve or Bucky on a bad day,&rdquo; you say weakly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, okay, I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m such a fucked up mess.&rdquo; You storm out of the room without another word. Your stomach churns angrily as you climb the stairs two at a time, heading toward the south side of the roof. Your favorite spot because it overlooks the river. </p><p>You lean your back against the wall and slide to the ground, pressing your forehead against your knees. Silent tears slide down your cheeks as your mind races. The dull ache blooms in your chest as your fingers curl around your ankles and take a shaky breath. The sound of footsteps causes you to jump and hastily wipe your face with your sleeve.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh. Sorry. I didn&rsquo;t think anyone else would be up here,&rdquo; Bucky&rsquo;s voice was quiet. You look up in time to see him run his fingers through his hair and start to turn away, but he stops. &ldquo;Are you okay? Are you crying?&rdquo; Bucky kneels in front of you, but you can&rsquo;t meet his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; you whisper and try to shift away from him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; This seems to be your new catch phrase.</p><p>&ldquo;More tests?&rdquo; He asks softly, tilting his head to the side. &ldquo;Did they find anything new? Anything helpful?&rdquo;</p><p>Shaking your head, you peek up at him from under your lashes and your heart squeezes painfully. &ldquo;No. Everything is the same. No new news. No changes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then why are you so upset?&rdquo; He pressed. His fingers flexed in front of him, but he made no move to reach out.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just tired. I&rsquo;ve been having nightmares. I&rsquo;m frustrated and I cry when I&rsquo;m frustrated,&rdquo; you explain and close your eyes again. You inhale deeply through your nose and let it out through your mouth. &ldquo;They want to send me to Wakanda,&rdquo; you whisper softly and fight back tears again.</p><p>Bucky&rsquo;s face falls and he leans back just a little, as if he&rsquo;s trying to put some space between the two of you. &ldquo;Oh. It&rsquo;s a beautiful place,&rdquo; he offered, but he didn&rsquo;t sound sincere. You nod once and wipe your cheeks again. &ldquo;When do you leave?&rdquo; He&rsquo;s stoic, but you swear you hear a hint of emotion in his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going,&rdquo; you say firmly and clench your fists. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go to a strange place and have the probe around in my brain.&rdquo; Your lips press together suddenly and you look at him apologetically. &ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For what? I volunteered. I knew that I needed help, and they were the best. They nearly fixed me. I still have a lot of issues to sort through on my own, but I don&rsquo;t feel controlled or afraid of who I am anymore.&rdquo; Bucky stops and looks at you for a long while before reaching out with his flesh hand and tucking a piece of hair behind your ear. &ldquo;Maybe you should go. If anyone can help you, they can.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look, Bucky, I get that they helped you and it was great, but I don&rsquo;t even know what&rsquo;s wrong with me. I want to figure it out for myself before I let everyone and their brother fuck around in my brain.&rdquo; You almost lean into his hand, but stop yourself. Longing for his touch is something that you try not to do because it is too painful. pulling yourself together, you start to stand.</p><p>Bucky reaches out suddenly and grabs your wrist gently. &ldquo;Wait. I didn&rsquo;t mean to push you. Stay. We can talk a little bit.&rdquo; He smiles, but it doesn&rsquo;t touch his eyes. &ldquo;To get your mind off of everything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a good idea.&rdquo; And it isn&rsquo;t a good idea. Every time you look at him, you want to lean forward those few inches and kiss him again and again, but you know that you&rsquo;re heart can&rsquo;t take it at this fragile time in your life.</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Bucky scoffs, trying to hide the hurt in his voice. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re friends, right? We can sit and talk about things like civilized people, can&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We could,&rdquo; you agree cautiously. &ldquo;But I still don&rsquo;t think I can.&rdquo; Biting your lip, you turn to walk away, but Bucky doesn&rsquo;t let go of your arm. &ldquo;Bucky, come on.&rdquo; You pull your arm, but his grip tightens. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; He demands. &ldquo;Do you have somewhere else you need to be? Got a hot date or something?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; With a sigh of defeat, you sink back to the ground beside him. There were several valid reasons that you could think of, but none of them you could tell him. &ldquo;Fine. What do you want to talk about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your favorite song?&rdquo; He asks suddenly, randomly. He smirks at your expression.</p><p>&ldquo;So we&rsquo;re going to play 20 questions then?&rdquo; He nods once. &ldquo;Alright then.&rdquo;</p><p>You answer all of his questions and he answers all of yours. The two of you sit and talk for hours, laughing at bad jokes and stories from the past. You let yourself relax a little and open up to Bucky and he does the same. It felt good to just sit and talk to someone, the conversation aimless. No purpose or double meaning. Just two people getting to know each other.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you feel better?&rdquo; Bucky asks after you stop laughing from his story of Coney Island and Steve getting sick on the rides. </p><p>Nodding slowly, you notice just how relaxed you feel. The knots in your stomach or gone and the ache in your chest is dull, barely noticable. &ldquo;I do actually. I think this is the longest conversation I&rsquo;ve had in awhile. I feel almost human again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know what you mean,&rdquo; he chuckles and you forget to breathe. The sound of his laugh only makes you ache for him even more. He shifts his weight from where he is sitting beside you, pulling one of his knees to his chest and leaving his other leg extended. His leg and arm bump against your side a few times, bringing chill bumps to your skin despite the warm weather. &ldquo;Hey listen&hellip;&rdquo; He stops talking and fidgets with a spot on his dark jeans.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; warily, you cut your eyes at him and bite your lip.</p><p>&ldquo;I, uh, I think you should really consider going to Wakanda for a while,&rdquo; Bucky says slowly, not looking at you.</p><p>It felt as though you&rsquo;ve &nbsp;been kicked in the gut. The dull ache in your chest erupts into white hot pain. Your eyes start to burn again as tears start to form. Of course he thought you should go to Wakanda. You were broken and needed some serious fixing. No one wanted to deal with your issues here. Wiping your face before he can see your tears, you sniff once. &ldquo;Right. That&rsquo;s great, James, thanks for your input,&rdquo; you snap and turn away from him.</p><p>&ldquo;No! That&rsquo;s not what&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t mean to&hellip;&rdquo; He was searching for the right words, but couldn&rsquo;t seem to find any. &ldquo;I think it would be good for you to get away from this place for a while. Everything has been quite and we haven&rsquo;t had a mission in weeks. Tony would be happy to let you borrow a jet for a while. Maybe not without supervision.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did he tell you to say that? Is that why you&rsquo;re here and why you wanted to talk to me? Did Tony put you up to this?&rdquo; Unbelievable. You didn&rsquo;t bother trying to hide your anger.</p><p>&ldquo;Geez, y/n, no! I just wanted to talk to you because I haven&rsquo;t seen you in a while.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You see me everyday,&rdquo; you retort bitterly.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but you haven&rsquo;t been you. I just wanted to see you and talk to the old you.&rdquo; He lets out a long sigh and stands. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not trying to push you. I just think you&rsquo;ll enjoy it. I know I wouldn&rsquo;t mind going back to Wakanda for a while,&rdquo; Bucky admits after a long pause.</p><p>&ldquo;Then come with me,&rdquo; you say suddenly and turn to face him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go&hellip; But I want you to come with me.&rdquo; It was a long shot, but maybe if you didn&rsquo;t go alone it wouldn&rsquo;t be as bad. If you had someone to talk to, someone you knew well, maybe you wouldn&rsquo;t feel so isolated.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n,&rdquo; he whispers and closes his eyes. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you feel more comfortable with Wanda or Nat going? I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m the guy for that.&rdquo; Bucky pauses again, shifting uncomfortably. &ldquo;Listen, Y/n, I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re thinking&hellip; But I&rsquo;m not the guy for you.&rdquo;</p><p>The ache in your chest surged again. It was an overwhelming throbbing now, something that you could no longer ignore. Nodding your head, you stand up so suddenly that you almost knock Bucky over. &ldquo;Okay. I get it. Message received.&rdquo; Your voice broke as tears begin to flow down you face. &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; you whisper and bolt for the door. &ldquo;Thanks for talking to me, Bucky,&rdquo; you call over your shoulder. Without a second glance, you disappear.</p><p>If you had looked back, you would have seen the pain and regret painted on Bucky&rsquo;s face. You would have seen how his fists were clenched at his sides and how his eyes glistened just a little. And how his breathing was shallow, like he couldn&rsquo;t take a deep breath because it hurt too much. You would have seen that his words were a lie, but you never turned around.</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, Stark, I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo; You are standing in the doorway of his lab, fidgeting with a small tear on the pocket of your jeans.</p><p>Tony looks up, shocked but pleased, and sets his tools down. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll regret this. You can stay as long as you&rsquo;d like or leave as soon as you want. I&rsquo;ll confirm everything. Suri will be excited that she&rsquo;ll have something meaningful to do now.&rdquo; He leaves the room, muttering to himself.</p><p>You try to convince yourself that you had made the right decision, but you still didn&rsquo;t feel great about it. Taking a deep breath, you head to your room to hide from reality for a while.</p><p>***</p><p>You shift in front of the mirror, tugging at the hem of your dress again, trying to get the fabric to lay right. Your hair fell in soft waves down your shoulders, and your makeup was minimal but affected.</p><p>&ldquo;You look fine! Come on the party started half an hour ago!&rdquo; Wanda says with a heavy sigh. &ldquo;Tony is throwing this party for you, you know, you should at least show up!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh Tony would through a party for any reason! My leaving is just the most recent event that warrants some big gathering in his opinion,&rdquo; you mutter and tuck your hair behind your ears. Casting one more look over your shoulder, you follow Wanda out of the room and toward the sound of people laughing and music playing. &ldquo;Oh my gosh,&rdquo; you whisper as you walk through the door. There were hundreds of people milling around, talking and dancing and laughing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to need a drink.&rdquo; Wanda nods as you push through the throngs of people trying to get to the bar.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow! You look fantastic! You sure clean up good!&rdquo; Sam whistled and laughs when you approach where he is sitting at the bar. &ldquo;Leave it to Tony to turn a goodbye party into a several hundred people event!&rdquo; He sweeps his arms out, gesturing around the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks. And yeah. I know. I actually was expecting this, but it still doesn&rsquo;t make me feel any better.&rdquo; You sit beside Sam and order a drink. The bartender pours it and hands it to you immediately. &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; you mutter and turn to survey the room. The music was pulsating, but it wasn&rsquo;t really loud. It was more like constant background noise. People were dancing in the center of the room, shouting and laughing loudly. Some people even appeared to be drunk already.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Sam. Y/n,&rdquo; Steve greets you with a smile and a hug. &ldquo;Packed and ready to go?&rdquo; You nod and he smiles even wider, like he&rsquo;s got a secret that he&rsquo;s dying to tell. &ldquo;Good. Have you guys seen Bucky? He was supposed to train with me before the party, but I haven&rsquo;t seen him all day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No I haven&rsquo;t seen him since we talked two days ago,&rdquo; you admit sheepishly and scan the room, looking for the super soldier. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s around here somewhere. I didn&rsquo;t figure he would come tonight because of all the people.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d miss this,&rdquo; Sam mutters under his breath. Steve elbows Sam in the ribs and chuckles. You look at both of them curiously but say nothing. &ldquo;Well, this has been a fun talk, but I&rsquo;m going to go dance now. Care to join me?&rdquo; Sam asks looking over at you.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh no. I don&rsquo;t dance. And I don&rsquo;t do well with large crowds. I&rsquo;m going to stay right here and people watch.&rdquo; You take a sip of your drink and Sam shrugs, disappearing into the sea of people. </p><p>Steve shakes his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go find Tony.&rdquo; He too disappears into the crowd, leaving you alone at the bar. Tilting back the glass, you down the rest of your drink and signal the bartender for another one. </p><p>You smile and hold polite conversations with several people that pass by or stop to order drinks, but you never venture very far. You prefer to just sit and watch. After your fourth drink, you start to feel warm and fuzzy. You relax and speak a little more freely as people approach you, but still keep your guard up with unfamiliar people.</p><p>&ldquo;You look amazing, doll,&rdquo; Bucky&rsquo;s voice purrs in your ear. He speaks loud enough for you to hear over the music. &ldquo;Having fun tonight?&rdquo;</p><p>Nodding, you smile up at him and watch his face break into a large grin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m having a blast. I&rsquo;m watching people dance and make fools of themselves.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well that does sound like a good time. Mind if I join you?&rdquo; He chuckles and sits beside you.</p><p>&ldquo;I actually was just about to go. I have to pee,&rdquo; you whisper and blush as you get to your feet. You wobble a few times before regaining your balance.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay? You gonna make it?&rdquo; He&rsquo;s laughing at you. You smile back at him and enjoy the warm feeling that settled in your stomach as soon as Bucky sat down. &ldquo;Need some help?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, Bucky. You can&rsquo;t go in with me! It&rsquo;s the LADIES room. You&rsquo;re not a lady.&rdquo; You giggle and grab his biceps to hold yourself up. Your fingers flex around his muscles and you sigh quietly, letting yourself imagine being wrapped in his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;You okay? Hello?&rdquo; Bucky wraps his arm around your waist and helps you walk to the restroom. &ldquo;There you go. I&rsquo;ll be right here, okay?&rdquo; You nod and giggle again as you walk into the bathroom. Once you&rsquo;re finished, you stumble back out and into Bucky&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;Whoa. Let&rsquo;s get you to bed. I think you party is over.&rdquo;</p><p>You nod slowly and press your lips together. They are numb. &ldquo;I can do it!&rdquo; you protest and struggle weakly against him. His arms tighten around you as he pulls you down the hallway. He stops at your room, opens the door, and gently pulls you inside. &ldquo;Thank you. You can go now,&rdquo; you whisper, your heart still stinging from your last conversation with Bucky. Your lower lip quivers as you sink onto the bed, your body sagging visibly as you realize this is your last night at the mansion. Bucky just nods, looking torn, and turns to leave. &ldquo;Bucky,&rdquo; you whisper softly and he turns.</p><p>**<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfFW9COtsR8\">Insert song now</a>**</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; He asks when he notices your lip trembling. He stands there for a moment, visibly warring with himself. &ldquo;Doll,&rdquo; he sighs and moves in front of you. He pulls you up and wraps his arms tightly around you. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be the death of me, doll,&rdquo; he whispers against your hair. You feel a soft pressure on the top of your head and realize that it&rsquo;s his lips peppering kisses against your hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t die,&rdquo; you say weakly and lean into him, breathing deeply. Memorizing his scent and the way he feels against you. Storing them in your mind so that you would never forget, no matter how long you&rsquo;re away.</p><p>Bucky leans back, but doesn&rsquo;t let you go. A broad grin stretches across his face. &ldquo;But if you&rsquo;re the death of me, Darlin&rsquo;, I wanna die.&rdquo; He kisses you, softly at first. Just light pecks against your lips. You wrap your arms around his neck and hold him against you. Bucky deepens the kiss with a quiet moan, his fingers tightening around your waist, holding you firmly against his body.</p><p>A shudder snakes up your spine as you knot your fingers in his hair and trace your tongue along his bottom lip, nipping lightly. His tongue slides into your mouth and dances with yours as you groan loudly, tugging his hair sharply. You feel a warm pooling between your legs as you grind yourself against him. He pulls away slowly, looking down at you. His pupils are dark and his breathing is shallow. &ldquo;Y/n,&rdquo; he whispers your name like a prayer. Bucky pulls you against him once more, enveloping you in a tight hug and rests his chin on the top of your head.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; You whisper breathlessly and press your ear against his chest, listening to the steady thumping of his heart.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had too much to drink. I don&rsquo;t want to do this like this. I don&rsquo;t want to do something that you&rsquo;ll regret once your sober,&rdquo; he says quietly, not letting you go.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to regret it,&rdquo; you assure him and press your lips to his clothed chest. You smile to yourself at Bucky being the perfect gentlemen. You wondered if this is how the old Bucky was. Always considerate and always the gentlemen.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he says again and steps away from you. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already messed a lot of things up, but I&rsquo;m not going to mess this up. I&rsquo;m not saying I don&rsquo;t want to!&rdquo; he reassures you when he sees your face fall. &ldquo;I just want to do it right,&rdquo; he whispers. &ldquo;Not with you tipsy and not on the night before we leave. Here.&rdquo; He hands you the pajamas that had been sitting on the edge of the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, okay. You&rsquo;re such a gentlemen,&rdquo; you say with a small smile and duck into the bathroom to change, but you leave the door slightly open. &ldquo;Hey, Bucky?&rdquo; you say after a few moments. He grunts in response. &ldquo;Even if nothing happens tonight&hellip;Can you stay here. I sleep a little better when I&rsquo;m not alone,&rdquo; you admit timidly. You pull on your sleep shirt and shorts and walk back into the bedroom.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure thing.&rdquo; Bucky starts to remove his clothes. It was at that point that you actually notice what he was wearing. Black dress pants, white dress shirt, black bow tie, and black suit jacket. His brown hair was dishevelled from your kiss earlier and his scruffy chin seems a bit more groomed. He looked so good. Bucky looks over at you and his cheeks turn a light shade of pink. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sleep in these. I&rsquo;ll roast.&rdquo; You nod an okay and he removes his shirt and pants. </p><p>Now it&rsquo;s your turn to blush as you turn away from him and giggle at the absurdity of this situation. Bucky was here, in your room, in nothing but his boxers. He climbs onto your bed and lays on top of the blankets. You turn on your fan and slip into bed beside him. &ldquo;I sleep with the fan on high, so it might get a little cold in here,&rdquo; you warn him and turn off the lamp.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll be okay,&rdquo; he responds with a yawn. </p><p>With a small smile, you roll onto your side and curl up against Bucky. He slides his metal arm under your head so you can rest your head on his chest. You sigh deeply and nuzzle your nose against him, already feeling your eyelids drooping. You feel him tense and shift his body away from you slightly. You feel him breathing and listen to the steady rhythm of his heart. Something he said earlier teases your consciousness. &ldquo;Bucky?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo; he shifts slightly so he can see you in the dark.</p><p>&ldquo;Earlier, when we were, um, kissing.&rdquo; Your cheeks heat up. &ldquo;You said we.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We?&rdquo; he asks sleepily. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. You said &lsquo;not the night before we leave,&rsquo;&rdquo; you whisper quietly and tilt your face up to look at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; he smiles softly. &ldquo;I did say that didn&rsquo;t I.&rdquo; He doesn&rsquo;t say anything else for a long while. </p><p>&ldquo;What did you mean?&rdquo; You wait for him to admit that he had just misspoken, but he remains silent. &ldquo;Are you asleep?&rdquo; You whisper and reach for his face. Your fingers ghost along his chin.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awake,&rdquo; he whispers back. &ldquo;I said we because I&rsquo;m going with you. I talked to Tony and packed my bags today. Unless&hellip;&rdquo; he leans his face into your palm. &ldquo;Unless you changed your mind and don&rsquo;t want me to go anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>You can hear the smile in his voice. &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m happy you&rsquo;re going with me,&rdquo; you whisper with a yawn. You fall asleep with a smile on your face.</p><p><br /></p><h2>TAGLIST:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNwV7ZLuGfRzK7Y0vPCz2rg\">@ivartheblessed</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgysIoWRLnQ9YY2enUhxotQ\">@hadesgirl1015</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFmpGRjCwmu-OpV-wKJ_kwA\">@yafriendlyfangirl</a></h2></p>",

I&rsquo;ll post the link again at the spot in the story. Hope you guys like it! Tag list is open!<br /></p>\n<hr />\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Deep breath in. Hold it. Release. Repeat.</p>\n<p>Over and over. It seems to be a never ending cycle.</p>\n<p>You sit upright in a white plush chair in one of the many labs in the mansion. Bruce and Tony are in the next room over, but you can see them through the wall of glass separating you. Their heads are close together and bent over the mass of computer screens. With a sigh, you shift uncomfortably, trying not to dislodge the IV that was sticking in your arm. Bruce runs his fingers through his hair and glances up at you with a forced smile. Your stomach drops and you close your eyes, trying to block everything out as you sit in silence.</p>\n<p>It had been two weeks since the attack on the mansion. Two weeks since you had your first meltdown, but it wasn&rsquo;t the only one. You had been plagued with nightmares every night since then. Broken fragments of memories that you couldn&rsquo;t quite place but felt familiar all the same. Unnamed fears that crippled your entire body and threatened loss of consciousness. All of these things were also accompanied by anger and heartache.</p>\n<p>The anger came from so many things. Not understanding yourself anymore, not being able to control yourself, not trusting yourself around the team anymore, not being able to read Bucky, being treated as a lab rat, the list goes on and on. But the heartache, that mainly comes from knowing that you have feelings for Bucky that are not reciprocated. Knowing that he only wants to use you for a release and nothing more, and what&rsquo;s worse, you&rsquo;re considering letting him.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Alright. I think we&rsquo;re done for the day.&rdquo; Tony steps into the room with a bag of blueberries. &ldquo;You doing okay?&rdquo; You nod, but keep your eyes closed, fighting off the nausea that is building in your stomach, as he removes the IV. &ldquo;Everything looks good. We&rsquo;ve isolated a few more genomes from your DNA. It would probably be better if you go to -&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m not going to Wakanda for the panthers to dissect my brain and probe around in there,&rdquo; you say tightly and squeeze your eyes even tighter.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It worked so well for James. If you would just consider it,&rdquo; Bruce says quietly. You hadn&rsquo;t heard him come in. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to stay there forever.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; You say again and hop off the chair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine right where I am.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh sure. Your nightmares are getting worse. You hardly sleep. You walk around like a member of the Walking Dead, and you are training so brutally I&rsquo;ve had to replace most of the equipment.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;How do you know it was me? It could have been Steve or Bucky on a bad day,&rdquo; you say weakly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, okay, I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m such a fucked up mess.&rdquo; You storm out of the room without another word. Your stomach churns angrily as you climb the stairs two at a time, heading toward the south side of the roof. Your favorite spot because it overlooks the river. </p>\n<p>You lean your back against the wall and slide to the ground, pressing your forehead against your knees. Silent tears slide down your cheeks as your mind races. The dull ache blooms in your chest as your fingers curl around your ankles and take a shaky breath. The sound of footsteps causes you to jump and hastily wipe your face with your sleeve.</p>\n</p>",

He never had to do it- you could\nsimply catch the bus, but he still insisted. At first you thought he only did\nit to get him on your good side, but he still insisted, and now it was just\nnormal for him to drive you to and from school unless you needed to stay behind\nor you wanted to go hang out with friends. </p><!-- more --><p>Steve had been the closest thing to a father figure for you\nin the recent years. You were a mutant who\u2019d ran away from your family due to\nthem not responding well to the revelation that you had powers, and they ended\nup calling the cops on you. Luckily it got SHIELD involved, and the one to find\nyou was Steve. You were barely a teenager then, and Steve made it his mission\nto make sure you were never arrested and instead talked Fury into allowing you\nto be trained and protected by SHIELD. Eventually, when you\u2019re old enough,\nyou\u2019d become part of the Avengers. For the time being however, you lived with\none, and while you never called him dad, you\u2019d made it obvious that you\nappreciated him as a father figure when you got him a card for Father\u2019s day. </p><p>Steve in the past few weeks had been a little worried about\nyou when it came to school- to be fair, he\u2019d always been worried about your\nschool life, especially when you started High School as a well-known mutant.\nThat worry calmed down when you assured him that you\u2019d made some friends who\nthought you were cool. But he still worried, whether it would be about homework\nthat you\u2019d been struggling with (he couldn\u2019t exactly help you due to his school\nknowledge being decades old) or your grades, upcoming parent evening or even\nworrying he wouldn\u2019t be able to get a night off to see something you\u2019d be\npartaking in. However, so far it had worked out, and he was hoping this would\nbe the same\u2026 but this time it felt different. </p><p>The School Dance was coming up, and you had shown some\ninterest in it. You had even took up doing chores for the Avengers and for the\npeople in surrounding flats for some money to put towards your dress, though\nthat goal for the dress you wanted was quickly reached because Tony doesn\u2019t\nunderstand the meaning of \u2018a sensible amount of money\u2019. However, not everything\nwas ready yet. You didn\u2019t have a date, and that was one of the things that\nSteve couldn\u2019t help much with. He could drive you, pick you up and all that,\nbut he couldn\u2019t get a date for you. That was up to you and anyone at the school\nwanting to take you. </p><p>What particularly worried him about today was that you\u2019d\ntold him you\u2019d be asking someone you liked if they\u2019d like to go to the dance\nwith you. He had given you a short protective talk on the way to school, but\nwished you luck. </p><p>He went through work, driving to your school and parking\noutside a little earlier than when the bell rang. He sat, waiting for only a\nfew minutes till the bell rang. He looked out the window as students shuffled\nout, chatting, laughing and smiling, relieved that school was over and they\nwere one day closer to the dance. That made you stand out to Steve. You were\ntrudging along, your head hung and hugging your books close to you as you\nsilently got into his car. Steve knew instantly something had happened, but he\nknew you weren\u2019t ready to talk to him. \u201cI\u2019ve got some bucks spare\u2026 ice cream\nsound good?\u201d He asked. You peeked your eyes at him, smiling weakly and nodding\nsoftly. </p><p>The drive was silent, and he did all the talking when you\narrived to the parlour. You got a corner seat, and eventually Steve spoke up.\n\u201cOkay\u2026 what happened?\u201d He asked softly. </p><p>\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t have a date.\u201d You admitted dimly, messing with\nyour ice cream and resting your arms on the table.</p><p>\u201cAny particular reason?\u201d He asked. You didn\u2019t respond\ninitially, only curling up more. \u201cY/N\u2026 come on sweetheart. You can tell me.\u201d He\nassured. This was enough assurance for you.</p><p>\u201cNo one wants to go with me because I\u2019m\u2026 fine. They called\nme a freak, and said they\u2019d never give someone who looked like me a chance.\u201d\nYou admitted, and Steve\u2019s heart dropped. His blood boiled. He was furious. But\nhe didn\u2019t show it. He instead put his arm across the table, taking your hand\nand rubbing his thumb across it, trying to reassure you.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re both wrong and missing out. You are amazing, Y/N.\nThey\u2019ve known you for a lot less than I have, and I know they\u2019re wrong by a\nlong shot. If they\u2019re that obsessed about how someone else looks, and over\nsomething you didn\u2019t have a choice in having, then they\u2019re the one with\nproblems.\u201d He assured you. You smiled weakly at him, being able to hold it. \u201c\u2026While\nI\u2019m not one for parties\u2026 I\u2019m pretty sure Tony would be alright with setting up\na much more extravagant party than what your school can put together, and make\nyou the princess of the ball\u2026 to be fair he\u2019s been bugging me about it for\nweeks so\u2026\u201d That made you laugh, knowing it was probably true. </p><p>\u201cThat sounds great.

Specifically when relationships and body\nconfidence are involved?</b></p><hr /><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>Steve had dropped you off at your high school like he had\nseveral hundred times in the past few years. He never had to do it- you could\nsimply catch the bus, but he still insisted. At first you thought he only did\nit to get him on your good side, but he still insisted, and now it was just\nnormal for him to drive you to and from school unless you needed to stay behind\nor you wanted to go hang out with friends. </p><p>Steve had been the closest thing to a father figure for you\nin the recent years. You were a mutant who&rsquo;d ran away from your family due to\nthem not responding well to the revelation that you had powers, and they ended\nup calling the cops on you. Luckily it got SHIELD involved, and the one to find\nyou was Steve. You were barely a teenager then, and Steve made it his mission\nto make sure you were never arrested and instead talked Fury into allowing you\nto be trained and protected by SHIELD. Eventually, when you&rsquo;re old enough,\nyou&rsquo;d become part of the Avengers. For the time being however, you lived with\none, and while you never called him dad, you&rsquo;d made it obvious that you\nappreciated him as a father figure when you got him a card for Father&rsquo;s day. </p><p>Steve in the past few weeks had been a little worried about\nyou when it came to school- to be fair, he&rsquo;d always been worried about your\nschool life, especially when you started High School as a well-known mutant.\nThat worry calmed down when you assured him that you&rsquo;d made some friends who\nthought you were cool. But he still worried, whether it would be about homework\nthat you&rsquo;d been struggling with (he couldn&rsquo;t exactly help you due to his school\nknowledge being decades old) or your grades, upcoming parent evening or even\nworrying he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get a night off to see something you&rsquo;d be\npartaking in. However, so far it had worked out, and he was hoping this would\nbe the same&hellip; but this time it felt different. </p><p>The School Dance was coming up, and you had shown some\ninterest in it. You had even took up doing chores for the Avengers and for the\npeople in surrounding flats for some money to put towards your dress, though\nthat goal for the dress you wanted was quickly reached because Tony doesn&rsquo;t\nunderstand the meaning of &lsquo;a sensible amount of money&rsquo;. However, not everything\nwas ready yet. You didn&rsquo;t have a date, and that was one of the things that\nSteve couldn&rsquo;t help much with. He could drive you, pick you up and all that,\nbut he couldn&rsquo;t get a date for you. That was up to you and anyone at the school\nwanting to take you. </p><p>What particularly worried him about today was that you&rsquo;d\ntold him you&rsquo;d be asking someone you liked if they&rsquo;d like to go to the dance\nwith you. He had given you a short protective talk on the way to school, but\nwished you luck. </p><p>He went through work, driving to your school and parking\noutside a little earlier than when the bell rang. He sat, waiting for only a\nfew minutes till the bell rang. He looked out the window as students shuffled\nout, chatting, laughing and smiling, relieved that school was over and they\nwere one day closer to the dance. That made you stand out to Steve. You were\ntrudging along, your head hung and hugging your books close to you as you\nsilently got into his car. Steve knew instantly something had happened, but he\nknew you weren&rsquo;t ready to talk to him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got some bucks spare&hellip; ice cream\nsound good?&rdquo; He asked. You peeked your eyes at him, smiling weakly and nodding\nsoftly. </p><p>The drive was silent, and he did all the talking when you\narrived to the parlour. You got a corner seat, and eventually Steve spoke up.\n&ldquo;Okay&hellip; what happened?&rdquo; He asked softly. </p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;I don&rsquo;t have a date.&rdquo; You admitted dimly, messing with\nyour ice cream and resting your arms on the table.</p><p>&ldquo;Any particular reason?&rdquo; He asked. You didn&rsquo;t respond\ninitially, only curling up more. &ldquo;Y/N&hellip; come on sweetheart. You can tell me.&rdquo; He\nassured. This was enough assurance for you.</p><p>&ldquo;No one wants to go with me because I&rsquo;m&hellip; fine. They called\nme a freak, and said they&rsquo;d never give someone who looked like me a chance.&rdquo;\nYou admitted, and Steve&rsquo;s heart dropped. His blood boiled. He was furious. But\nhe didn&rsquo;t show it. He instead put his arm across the table, taking your hand\nand rubbing his thumb across it, trying to reassure you.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re both wrong and missing out. You are amazing, Y/N.\nThey&rsquo;ve known you for a lot less than I have, and I know they&rsquo;re wrong by a\nlong shot. If they&rsquo;re that obsessed about how someone else looks, and over\nsomething you didn&rsquo;t have a choice in having, then they&rsquo;re the one with\nproblems.&rdquo; He assured you. You smiled weakly at him, being able to hold it. &ldquo;&hellip;While\nI&rsquo;m not one for parties&hellip; I&rsquo;m pretty sure Tony would be alright with setting up\na much more extravagant party than what your school can put together, and make\nyou the princess of the ball&hellip; to be fair he&rsquo;s been bugging me about it for\nweeks so&hellip;&rdquo; That made you laugh, knowing it was probably true. </p><p>&ldquo;That sounds great. I have a feeling he will constantly be\nsprouting about me being an Avenger in training.&rdquo; You commented, giving Steve\nan opportunity to laugh. &ldquo;You always know how to make me feel better. Thank\nyou. I&rsquo;m happy I&rsquo;m lucky to have someone as amazing as you as a father figure.&rdquo;\nNow that just made him feel like the proudest man in the world. </p><hr /><p>Hope you like it!

He really didn&rsquo;t want to be there, but only came because Clint threatened to tell Y/N about his crush on her which he vehemently denied. Lifting the drink to his mouth he felt the warm liquid glide down his throat. </p><p>\u201cIs anyone sitting here?\u201d A voice beside him asked. He didn&rsquo;t even have to look to know it was Y/N. Putting a smile on his face he motioned for her to sit down. \u00a0He found that he couldn\u2019t help but stare. Her H/C hair was in a neat bun with a few ringlets framing her face. She was wearing a medium length red dress.</p><p>Trying to look away he focused his attention back to his drink. \u201cSo are you being blackmailed into this party too?\u201d Y/N voice spoke up again. He looked at her with curiosity wondering what she was being blackmailed about but he didn\u2019t want to seem like he was being nosey.</p><p>\u201cNo I thought it was a good idea to get away from the lab.\u201d As soon as the words left his mouth he didn\u2019t believe them himself. The look on her face suggested she didn\u2019t buy it either. \u00a0Looking for a change of topic he remembered something. </p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going out to Florida to help Pepper with something?\u201d \u00a0Just the mention of her job she smiled. \u201cYeah I\u2019m going to help redesign the new Avengers safehouses out there.\u201d \u00a0Y/N was Tony\u2019s sister but she started to work with Shield  once the Avengers were formed he brought her on as a designer for all the new rooms in the Avengers Tower.</p><p>He nodded not sure what else to say. \u00a0\u201cSo Y/N you wouldn\u2019t be over here flirting with Banner would you?\u201d \u00a0A voice from behind him joked. Bruce watched as her face turned to a playful scrawl but it didn\u2019t do much to Tony who came over laughing. Bruce tried his best to hide his blush. </p><p>Tony didn\u2019t know anything about his crush which he was grateful for, but looking over he saw Clint smiling in his direction. Bruce wished he would just stop. because nothing was ever going to happen between him and yourself. </p><p>Turning back around he saw that you and Tony had walked off and was sitting at the couch with everyone else. Going over to the empty chair he took a seat and listened as Thor was telling a story about some battle he had been in. Bruce was only half listening when he saw that you had stood up to go upstairs probably to get ready to leave he thought. He felt a tightness in his chest as he thought about not seeing you for the next 8 weeks. </p><p>Ignoring his chest he turned his attention back to Thor saying how he hit some alien with his hammer or something like that. Bruce\u2019s thoughts kept drifting back to you as he realized he won\u2019t see your smiling face in the morning getting coffee or hear your voice sing a little off key while singing around the tower and he realized his feelings for you were much stronger than he initially thought but he knew he could never tell you. He didn\u2019t want you to be in danger because of the other guy and he didn\u2019t think Tony would like one of his teammates dating his sister. </p><p>Hearing \u201cTony you better just get it over with.\u201d Coming from Rhodey he followed the man&rsquo;s gaze to see you coming down the stairs in a pair of old jeans and a modest top. Your hair was hanging down now. \u00a0Bruce thought he looked so much better this way than all glammed up at parties. </p><p>He watched as Tony reluctantly stood up and walked over to where Y/N stood and held out his arms she returned the gesture and closed the distance between them. Everyone around the siblings was watching the exchange with smiles on their faces. \u00a0Pulling apart he saw that Tony was really going to miss his sister. Y/N the went around the room saying her goodbyes and giving everyone hugs. She came up to him last and wrapped her arms around him he slowly did the same; it felt odd to have another human being touch him. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to miss you but once I get back I\u2019m determined to know the mystery that is Dr. Bruce Banner.\u201d She joked her hot breath right in his ear. \u00a0Pulling away he watched as she went out the door to have the driver take her to the airport. </p><p>it had been about twenty minutes since you left but he kept replaying what Y/N had said to him and couldn\u2019t help but wonder what you meant by that. \u00a0His thoughts were interrupted when JARVIS voice came out of the speaker from above. </p><p>\u201cSir I\u2019m afraid there are two police officers at the door.\u201d Everyone in the room got quiet after that. Tony was the first to react \u201cHave they said why they are here?\u201d \u00a0The AI responded, \u201cNo but they said it was an emergency that they talk to you.\u201d Now everyone\u2019s eyes were on Tony as he hurried to the door to find out what the trouble was. His mind started to wonder one thing much worse than the last. What if something happened and you were in the hospital. The silence in the room was cut through when a scream was emitted into the air. everyone went to see what the trouble was. Bruce came around the corner with everyone else the sight was quite worrisome with Tony on his knees and his hand over his mouth sobbing. \u00a0</p><p>Bruce felt a knot in his stomach . Rhodey went to his friend to see what the problem was. Bruce never thought he would hear those words especially not tonight but when he saw the man\u2019s face look up at them he knew it wasn\u2019t good news. \u201cY/N is dead.&ldquo; \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>AN: So please tell me what you think will only continue if enough people seem interested.
