        "answer": "<p>It was an article posted by Salt Lake Tribune and it was pretty spoiler heavy regarding the plot for One in a Minyan. So if you wanna read it, you\u2019ve been warned! (I literally just copied and pasted the whole article so if there are mistakes I\u2019m sorry lol)\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>In the 2\u00bd seasons \u201cAndi Mack\u201d has been on the air, it has dealt with family secrets, bullying, guns, love, betrayal, multiculturalism, religion, sexism, privacy, lies, military deployments, standing up to authority, jealousy, mental health and more than a little teenage angst.</p><p>This week\u2019s episode (Friday, 6 p.m., Disney Channel) of the made-in-Utah show deals with death. And it\u2019s funny. Really.</p><p><a href=\"http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=5398083&amp;itype=CMSID\">Cyrus (Joshua Rush)</a> is mourning the loss of his grandmother. He and his family are sitting shiva, the weeklong mourning period that\u2019s unfamiliar to Cyrus\u2019 non-Jewish friends.</p><p>But, supportive friends that they are, Andi (Peyton Elizabeth Lee), Buffy (Sofia Wylie) and Jonah (Asher Angel) are there for Cyrus.</p><p>Jonah \u2014 unaware that Jewish custom is to have the burial as quickly as possible \u2014 asks to see the body of Cyrus\u2019 bubbe to pay his respects. He\u2019s surprised when he learns she\u2019s already been buried.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not laid out somewhere?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cThis is a shiva,\u201d Cyrus says. \u201cThe only thing that gets laid out are the deli platters.\u201d</p><p>There are a lot of jokes like that in the episode, written by Jonathan Hurwitz. There\u2019s a plot line in which Cyrus\u2019 relatives are shocked and dismayed that Andi\u2019s father, Bowie (Trent Garrett), has brought a kugel (a noodle casserole) devoid of raisins to the shiva.</p><p>Later in the episode, Cyrus tells his friends, \u201cYou know the story behind every major Jewish holiday \u2014 they tried to kill us. We survived. Let\u2019s eat!\u201d</p><p>You don\u2019t often see religious traditions portrayed like this. And it\u2019s more rare still to see Jewish traditions play such a central, sympathetic role.</p><p>\u201cShiva\u2019s about friends and family being together to comfort one another and share stories,\u201d Cyrus says.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like a really nice thing to do when you\u2019ve just lost someone,\u201d Andi says.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Cyrus replies. \u201cExcept \u2026 it lasts seven days. We take a long time to say goodbye.\u201d</p><p>This being \u201cAndi Mack,\u201d that\u2019s not the only thing going on. Andi and her grandmother Celia (Lauren Tom) are at odds over details of Andi\u2019s parents\u2019 upcoming wedding. Jonah has another panic attack \u2014 a strong storyline that lets young viewers know that we all deal with issues.</p><p>Speaking of modeling good behavior, Cyrus finally comes out to Jonah, a development that\u2019s not a big deal \u2014 which makes a statement by not being a Major Event.</p><p>I know I\u2019m repeating myself, but \u201cAndi Mack\u201d <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/artsliving/tv/2017/11/02/scott-d-pierce-made-in-utah-andi-mack-does-great-job-with-gay-storyline/\">is an exceptional series that kids can learn a lot from</a> while they\u2019re being entertained. And, unlike so many shows aimed at kids and tweens, this one is watchable for parents and grandparents, too.</p><p>The question hanging over the show is not answered in this episode, however. There\u2019s been no mention of Andi\u2019s grandfather Ham since the actor who plays him, <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/2019/01/10/fired-disney-channel/\">Stoney Westmoreland, was arrested in Salt Lake City</a> on charges he tried to set up a sexual encounter with a person he believed to be a 13-year-old boy.</p><p>To repeat myself again, <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/artsliving/2019/01/18/scott-d-pierce-disney/\">Westmoreland was not a regular</a> on \u201cAndi Mack.\u201d He was a supporting character when he did appear. And kids who don\u2019t know what happened wouldn\u2019t have noticed his absence in the four new episodes that have aired since he was <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/nation-world/2018/12/15/disney-actor-stoney/\">arrested and fired</a>.</p><p>But, assuming Bowie and <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/artsliving/2018/07/12/andi-macks-tv-mom-finds/\">Bex (Lilan Bowden) </a>actually do get married, it will be tough to have the wedding without somehow explaining how the father of the bride isn\u2019t there.</p>",

I have also made it very clear that if Josh ever showed any discomfort or offence in fans using those kinds of terms for him, I would stop immediately.</p><p>I actually try very hard not to patronize Josh - because I have an incredible amount of respect for him as a human being.

But with that being said - I am almost positive that in talking about those things - I definitely used the terms <i>underage</i>, <i>minor</i>, and <i>teenager</i>\u00a0to refer to him because they are more accurate and more professional. I also made a post when he left his blog explaining that the fact that he is a minor wasn\u2019t the reason I was upset or defending him - but rather the fact that a human being was being treated so poorly for no valid reason. I was actually really annoyed that day because a lot of people were making posts about how it\u2019s unfair to treat a 17 year old like that, but I was more upset that ANYONE could be treated like that.</p><p>If you are referring to me saying\u00a0\u201cprotect our children\u201d, that is mostly a joke and it pre-dates Andi Mack. It is not at all meant to describe Josh in particular, but rather the child actors and public figures who are regularly and unfairly mistreated by people my age and older. I first started saying it about Zendaya and Bella Thorne (who are literally only 1-2 years younger than me) on Shake It Up! because everyone my age hated that show, and took it out on them and I saw it as something really disgusting. When I have used it on this blog, it mostly started out to describe the cast as a whole, not just Josh. But I used that term before I ever made that blog as kind of a joke towards the fact that I get a genuine motherly urge to protect and defend young people who are being harassed or mistreated\u2026 which is kind of an urge we should all feel so like\u2026 I definitely don\u2019t feel bad about it.\u00a0</p><p>I also find it weird that this is something you <i>cannot wait </i>for.
