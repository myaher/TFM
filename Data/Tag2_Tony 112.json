What\nyear was it, anyway? Why was this phone so damn ancient? \u201cIt\u2019s me. I couldn\u2019t\nsleep, and I know you\u2019re practically nocturnal, so I thought you\u2019d answer.\u201d The\nMP at the door scowled at you and you shifted on your chair. The metal scraped\nacross the concrete floor. \u201cActually that\u2019s not true. I could really use your\nhelp.\u201d</p><p>You hung up when the recording informed you the message\nwould be delivered. The MP stepped forward and took the phone.</p><p>\u201cHey! Where are you taking that?! He\u2019ll call back!\u201d</p><p>The man in full military fatigues turned back with a sigh. You\nwondered if anyone could be more frustrated with their job. It made you a\nlittle pleased. If you had to be dragged in here to this intentionally\nuncomfortable rat cage of a room, your captors could be a little uncomfortable\ntoo.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t allow treason suspects unrestricted phone access.\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes. \u201c<i>Light</i>\ntreason. It was light! And accidental!\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t react in the slightest as he turned with the phone\nunder his arm and headed back out the heavy steel door. Your head fell back between\nyour shoulders when you heard the low clank of the lock.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"720\" data-orig-height=\"38\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/54012d682d6a462beb79985bbb939b83/tumblr_inline_po0rhtmsiG1uvseau_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"720\" data-orig-height=\"38\"/></figure><p>It was no secret that Tony had an inexorably active mind. No\none would be surprised to find him up at odd hours tinkering in his lab. He had\na whole floor for it.</p><p>Nowadays though, it wasn\u2019t curiosity that kept him up, kept\nhim working. Tony carried more than his fair share of trauma and unhealthy coping\nmechanisms. He\u2019d come a long way toward channeling them into more constructive\ndirections, and this \u2013 the late night tinkering \u2013 was one of them.</p><p>Instead of a drink to blur the pain or a drug to ease his\nmind, he focused on something else. But it wasn\u2019t just that his mind was\nengaged. There was something comforting and familiar about working with his\nhands. It gave him control in a way nothing else could.</p><p>Sometimes his mind was a runaway train. But here, in the\nlab, with his hands on steel and iron, surrounded by the things he himself had\ncreated, he could slow it all down.</p><p>No one would have been surprised to find him in the lab at\n1:30 in the morning. But not everyone knew him well enough to recognize it as\nhis own brand of therapy. Most people didn\u2019t bother to. The perils of\ncelebrity.</p><p>\u201cA call for you, sir,\u201d FRIDAY\u2019s soft accent called through\nthe blaring music of the lab.</p><p>Tony frowned. His attention hardly shifted from the\ndelicately balanced wiring he held against the glowing soldering iron with long\nfoceps. FRIDAY allowed only a very small handful of callers through when he was\nin the lab, and frankly, he wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to talk to even that short\nlist just now.</p><p>\u201cBusy,\u201d he ordered, tongue poking out involuntarily as he\nconcentrated on the precarious task.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s collect, sir. Department of Homeland Security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m very busy.\u201d</p><p>The AI played the recorded message and Tony froze. It had\nbeen years since he\u2019d heard that voice. Another lifetime. The soldering iron\nslowly sank to the lead table and his eyes drifted to the dark emptiness ahead\nof him through the floor to ceiling windows.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"720\" data-orig-height=\"38\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/54012d682d6a462beb79985bbb939b83/tumblr_inline_po0ri8D6d71uvseau_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"720\" data-orig-height=\"38\"/></figure><p>It had been hours. Hours on hours. Time was meaningless to\nyou, generally. You were smart and quick but scattered. Your conscious unfurled\nlike a tangle of Christmas lights. Just when you think you\u2019re on the right\ntrack it takes a sharp angle and gets caught in a knot, a new puzzle, a new\nchallenge. You were always losing track of time.</p><p>But here, in this gray room with it\u2019s steel grey table and\nsteel grey chairs and black Styrofoam ceiling, time seemed to unravel entirely.\nWith no external stimulation you drifted down the web until you couldn\u2019t follow\nthe tangle any further. The energy itched beneath your skin until you jumped up\nfrom the seat and paced. Then you stretched. Then you lay on the floor and\nthought some more.</p><p>It had been years since your last contact with Tony Stark.\nBut you knew he\u2019d be there when you really needed him. You tried to convince\nyourself that was true as the time passed in its slow winding way.</p><p>Finally, when it seemed you\u2019d been there so long you\u2019d half\nconvinced yourself you could dissolve your own atoms and melt into the floor at\nany moment\u2026 The clatter of the lock turning in the empty room rang as loud as a\nfreight train.</p><p>The MP stood at the door, the same bored expression, but\nthis time, he stood to the side, holding it open.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Nurse Ratched!\u201d you called, letting your head fall\nback to the floor after catching a glimpse of his rolling eyes.</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s just rude.\u201d</p><p>Your eyes snapped open, and a grin dragged across your lips\nat the sound of his voice.</p><p>\u201cI have 3 PhDs,\u201d Tony frowned, gliding into the room.\n\u201cThat\u2019s Dr. Ratched to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d you drew out the word as you curled to your feet. \u201c<i>You</i>, darling, are my knight in red\nshining armor!\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak, but the smile on his lips drew out the\nseries of wrinkles at his eyes and you knew you\u2019d called the right person.\nRolling his eyes playfully, he jerked his head toward the open door, beckoning\nyou to get moving.</p><p>You did, but not before stopping to throw your arms over his\nshoulders and bury your face in his neck. Sweet and spicy cologne tickled your\nnose, an expensive cocktail, no doubt.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, Tony.\u201d</p><p>His arm curled around your back and you felt the stubble\nfrom his jaw scratch at your shoulder as he pressed in close. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d The whisper of his breath tickled your\nskin and set a shiver prickling up your spine.</p><p>\u201cYou know these aren\u2019t private rooms,\u201d the MP deadpanned.</p><p>The snicker had burst past your lips before you could stop\nit. </p><p>\u201cWho hurt you, Ratched? Why does happiness make you so\nangry?\u201d So relieved to be free, and to see Tony, your stupid web of a brain, had\ncharged full steam ahead. </p><p>As you reached to put a hand on the MP\u2019s elbow, all mock sympathy\nand snark, Tony snapped out to pull you back with a firm grip on your wrist.\nThe scowl from the officer was enough to have you biting back another giggle. </p><p>\u201cOkay, no touching the Military Police,\u201d Tony, instructed,\nrushing you through the door as another officer led the way out of the tunnel\nof hallways. \u201cLet\u2019s get you out of here without any new charges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d you mumbled.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t take you anywhere,\u201d he teased under his breath. He\ngave you a familiar squeeze as he guided you into the elevator with an arm\nstill securely around your waist.</p><p>\u201cFor the record,\u201d you argued, as was your wont. \u201cI took\nmyself\u2026 well not here. Where is here, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisneyworld.\u201d</p><p>You looked up at him with a frown and a sigh but he barely\ncracked even a hint of a smile.</p><p>\u201cThe Pentagon!\u201d he finally shouted. \u201cHow in the hell did you\nland yourself on the brink of actual oblivion in the basement of the fucking\nPentagon?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, relax.

They were gonna bury you in some basement cell until you were\nforgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou worry too much, you know that?\u201d</p><p>He blinked at you, frustrated, and afraid, and for once in\nhis life, out of words.</p><p>This was always how your arguments progressed. There was nothing\nserious enough for you where Tony was all in, stakes so high he might snap.</p><p>You were like that one perfect summer: a light breath and a\nrash decision, laughter and risks. An exciting toy others always seemed to want\nto hold in their hands but not to keep. A pleasure but a liability. </p><p>When you met him, Tony had seemed a match for your spontaneity.\nBut in the end, he worried. Too much, and constantly. He couldn\u2019t stand to\nwatch the destruction of your fire and you wouldn\u2019t let yourself be dimmed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 nobody\u2019s ever accused me of that particular crime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you don\u2019t let people see you,\u201d you offered a\nsad smile and stepped closer, closing the distance, the miles, the years that\nhad separated you all this time. \u201cBut I still do.\u201d Your forehead pressed to his\nand your eyes remained locked on his, warm and open and so wonderfully,\ncomfortingly, familiar.</p><p>He sighed, relenting.

A very strongly worded Cease And Desist.\u201d</p><p>Your eyes went wide and you took one last look inside the\nbag.</p><p>\u201cThey took it.\u201d The defeat in your voice was palpable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d and he was.

What\nyear was it, anyway? Why was this phone so damn ancient? \u201cIt\u2019s me. I couldn\u2019t\nsleep, and I know you\u2019re practically nocturnal, so I thought you\u2019d answer.\u201d The\nMP at the door scowled at you and you shifted on your chair. The metal scraped\nacross the concrete floor. \u201cActually that\u2019s not true. I could really use your\nhelp.\u201d</p><p>You hung up when the recording informed you the message\nwould be delivered. The MP stepped forward and took the phone.</p><p>\u201cHey! Where are you taking that?! He\u2019ll call back!\u201d</p><p>The man in full military fatigues turned back with a sigh. You\nwondered if anyone could be more frustrated with their job. It made you a\nlittle pleased. If you had to be dragged in here to this intentionally\nuncomfortable rat cage of a room, your captors could be a little uncomfortable\ntoo.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t allow treason suspects unrestricted phone access.\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes. \u201c<i>Light</i>\ntreason. It was light! And accidental!\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t react in the slightest as he turned with the phone\nunder his arm and headed back out the heavy steel door. Your head fell back between\nyour shoulders when you heard the low clank of the lock.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"720\" data-orig-height=\"38\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/54012d682d6a462beb79985bbb939b83/tumblr_inline_po0rhtmsiG1uvseau_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"720\" data-orig-height=\"38\"></figure><p>It was no secret that Tony had an inexorably active mind. No\none would be surprised to find him up at odd hours tinkering in his lab. He had\na whole floor for it.</p><p>Nowadays though, it wasn\u2019t curiosity that kept him up, kept\nhim working. Tony carried more than his fair share of trauma and unhealthy coping\nmechanisms. He\u2019d come a long way toward channeling them into more constructive\ndirections, and this \u2013 the late night tinkering \u2013 was one of them.</p><p>Instead of a drink to blur the pain or a drug to ease his\nmind, he focused on something else. But it wasn\u2019t just that his mind was\nengaged. There was something comforting and familiar about working with his\nhands. It gave him control in a way nothing else could.</p><p>Sometimes his mind was a runaway train. But here, in the\nlab, with his hands on steel and iron, surrounded by the things he himself had\ncreated, he could slow it all down.</p><p>No one would have been surprised to find him in the lab at\n1:30 in the morning. But not everyone knew him well enough to recognize it as\nhis own brand of therapy. Most people didn\u2019t bother to. The perils of\ncelebrity.</p><p>\u201cA call for you, sir,\u201d FRIDAY\u2019s soft accent called through\nthe blaring music of the lab.</p><p>Tony frowned. His attention hardly shifted from the\ndelicately balanced wiring he held against the glowing soldering iron with long\nfoceps. FRIDAY allowed only a very small handful of callers through when he was\nin the lab, and frankly, he wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to talk to even that short\nlist just now.</p><p>\u201cBusy,\u201d he ordered, tongue poking out involuntarily as he\nconcentrated on the precarious task.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s collect, sir. Department of Homeland Security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m very busy.\u201d</p><p>The AI played the recorded message and Tony froze. It had\nbeen years since he\u2019d heard that voice. Another lifetime. The soldering iron\nslowly sank to the lead table and his eyes drifted to the dark emptiness ahead\nof him through the floor to ceiling windows.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"720\" data-orig-height=\"38\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/54012d682d6a462beb79985bbb939b83/tumblr_inline_po0ri8D6d71uvseau_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"720\" data-orig-height=\"38\"></figure><p>It had been hours. Hours on hours. Time was meaningless to\nyou, generally. You were smart and quick but scattered. Your conscious unfurled\nlike a tangle of Christmas lights. Just when you think you\u2019re on the right\ntrack it takes a sharp angle and gets caught in a knot, a new puzzle, a new\nchallenge. You were always losing track of time.</p><p>But here, in this gray room with it\u2019s steel grey table and\nsteel grey chairs and black Styrofoam ceiling, time seemed to unravel entirely.\nWith no external stimulation you drifted down the web until you couldn\u2019t follow\nthe tangle any further. The energy itched beneath your skin until you jumped up\nfrom the seat and paced. Then you stretched. Then you lay on the floor and\nthought some more.</p><p>It had been years since your last contact with Tony Stark.\nBut you knew he\u2019d be there when you really needed him. You tried to convince\nyourself that was true as the time passed in its slow winding way.</p><p>Finally, when it seemed you\u2019d been there so long you\u2019d half\nconvinced yourself you could dissolve your own atoms and melt into the floor at\nany moment\u2026 The clatter of the lock turning in the empty room rang as loud as a\nfreight train.</p><p>The MP stood at the door, the same bored expression, but\nthis time, he stood to the side, holding it open.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Nurse Ratched!\u201d you called, letting your head fall\nback to the floor after catching a glimpse of his rolling eyes.</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s just rude.\u201d</p><p>Your eyes snapped open, and a grin dragged across your lips\nat the sound of his voice.</p><p>\u201cI have 3 PhDs,\u201d Tony frowned, gliding into the room.\n\u201cThat\u2019s Dr. Ratched to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d you drew out the word as you curled to your feet. \u201c<i>You</i>, darling, are my knight in red\nshining armor!\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak, but the smile on his lips drew out the\nseries of wrinkles at his eyes and you knew you\u2019d called the right person.\nRolling his eyes playfully, he jerked his head toward the open door, beckoning\nyou to get moving.</p><p>You did, but not before stopping to throw your arms over his\nshoulders and bury your face in his neck. Sweet and spicy cologne tickled your\nnose, an expensive cocktail, no doubt.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, Tony.\u201d</p><p>His arm curled around your back and you felt the stubble\nfrom his jaw scratch at your shoulder as he pressed in close. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d The whisper of his breath tickled your\nskin and set a shiver prickling up your spine.</p><p>\u201cYou know these aren\u2019t private rooms,\u201d the MP deadpanned.</p><p>The snicker had burst past your lips before you could stop\nit. </p><p>\u201cWho hurt you, Ratched? Why does happiness make you so\nangry?\u201d So relieved to be free, and to see Tony, your stupid web of a brain, had\ncharged full steam ahead. </p><p>As you reached to put a hand on the MP\u2019s elbow, all mock sympathy\nand snark, Tony snapped out to pull you back with a firm grip on your wrist.\nThe scowl from the officer was enough to have you biting back another giggle. </p><p>\u201cOkay, no touching the Military Police,\u201d Tony, instructed,\nrushing you through the door as another officer led the way out of the tunnel\nof hallways. \u201cLet\u2019s get you out of here without any new charges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d you mumbled.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t take you anywhere,\u201d he teased under his breath. He\ngave you a familiar squeeze as he guided you into the elevator with an arm\nstill securely around your waist.</p><p>\u201cFor the record,\u201d you argued, as was your wont. \u201cI took\nmyself\u2026 well not here. Where is here, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisneyworld.\u201d</p><p>You looked up at him with a frown and a sigh but he barely\ncracked even a hint of a smile.</p><p>\u201cThe Pentagon!\u201d he finally shouted. \u201cHow in the hell did you\nland yourself on the brink of actual oblivion in the basement of the fucking\nPentagon?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, relax. It was an ex\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cIf you say \u2018It was an experiment,\u2019 I will lock you up\nmyself. Are you insane?\u201d His warm brown eyes had turned hard and angry as they\nbore into you.</p><p>By now you\u2019d left the elevator and you\u2019d practically jogged\nto the front desk to keep up with his quick pace. His questioning stare never\nleft you as he slammed his visitor badge down onto the counter and they handed\nyou a plastic bag with your belongings.</p><p>\u201cUm okay how about it was a\u2026 uh\u2026 <i>test,</i> then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh for the love of\u2026\u201d He rolled his eyes and turned away\nfrom you briefly. \u201cYou know they could have killed you on sight, right?

What\nyear was it, anyway? Why was this phone so damn ancient? \u201cIt\u2019s me. I couldn\u2019t\nsleep, and I know you\u2019re practically nocturnal, so I thought you\u2019d answer.\u201d The\nMP at the door scowled at you and you shifted on your chair. The metal scraped\nacross the concrete floor. \u201cActually that\u2019s not true. I could really use your\nhelp.\u201d</p><p>You hung up when the recording informed you the message\nwould be delivered. The MP stepped forward and took the phone.</p><p>\u201cHey! Where are you taking that?! He\u2019ll call back!\u201d</p><p>The man in full military fatigues turned back with a sigh. You\nwondered if anyone could be more frustrated with their job. It made you a\nlittle pleased. If you had to be dragged in here to this intentionally\nuncomfortable rat cage of a room, your captors could be a little uncomfortable\ntoo.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t allow treason suspects unrestricted phone access.\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes. \u201c<i>Light</i>\ntreason. It was light! And accidental!\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t react in the slightest as he turned with the phone\nunder his arm and headed back out the heavy steel door.

No\none would be surprised to find him up at odd hours tinkering in his lab. He had\na whole floor for it.</p><p>Nowadays though, it wasn\u2019t curiosity that kept him up, kept\nhim working. Tony carried more than his fair share of trauma and unhealthy coping\nmechanisms. He\u2019d come a long way toward channeling them into more constructive\ndirections, and this \u2013 the late night tinkering \u2013 was one of them.</p><p>Instead of a drink to blur the pain or a drug to ease his\nmind, he focused on something else. But it wasn\u2019t just that his mind was\nengaged. There was something comforting and familiar about working with his\nhands. It gave him control in a way nothing else could.</p><p>Sometimes his mind was a runaway train.

His attention hardly shifted from the\ndelicately balanced wiring he held against the glowing soldering iron with long\nfoceps. FRIDAY allowed only a very small handful of callers through when he was\nin the lab, and frankly, he wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to talk to even that short\nlist just now.</p><p>\u201cBusy,\u201d he ordered, tongue poking out involuntarily as he\nconcentrated on the precarious task.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s collect, sir. Department of Homeland Security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m very busy.\u201d</p><p>The AI played the recorded message and Tony froze. It had\nbeen years since he\u2019d heard that voice.

Hours on hours. Time was meaningless to\nyou, generally. You were smart and quick but scattered. Your conscious unfurled\nlike a tangle of Christmas lights. Just when you think you\u2019re on the right\ntrack it takes a sharp angle and gets caught in a knot, a new puzzle, a new\nchallenge. You were always losing track of time.</p><p>But here, in this gray room with it\u2019s steel grey table and\nsteel grey chairs and black Styrofoam ceiling, time seemed to unravel entirely.\nWith no external stimulation you drifted down the web until you couldn\u2019t follow\nthe tangle any further. The energy itched beneath your skin until you jumped up\nfrom the seat and paced. Then you stretched. Then you lay on the floor and\nthought some more.</p><p>It had been years since your last contact with Tony Stark.\nBut you knew he\u2019d be there when you really needed him. You tried to convince\nyourself that was true as the time passed in its slow winding way.</p><p>Finally, when it seemed you\u2019d been there so long you\u2019d half\nconvinced yourself you could dissolve your own atoms and melt into the floor at\nany moment\u2026 The clatter of the lock turning in the empty room rang as loud as a\nfreight train.</p><p>The MP stood at the door, the same bored expression, but\nthis time, he stood to the side, holding it open.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Nurse Ratched!\u201d you called, letting your head fall\nback to the floor after catching a glimpse of his rolling eyes.</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s just rude.\u201d</p><p>Your eyes snapped open, and a grin dragged across your lips\nat the sound of his voice.</p><p>\u201cI have 3 PhDs,\u201d Tony frowned, gliding into the room.\n\u201cThat\u2019s Dr. Ratched to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d you drew out the word as you curled to your feet. \u201c<i>You</i>, darling, are my knight in red\nshining armor!\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak, but the smile on his lips drew out the\nseries of wrinkles at his eyes and you knew you\u2019d called the right person.\nRolling his eyes playfully, he jerked his head toward the open door, beckoning\nyou to get moving.</p><p>You did, but not before stopping to throw your arms over his\nshoulders and bury your face in his neck. Sweet and spicy cologne tickled your\nnose, an expensive cocktail, no doubt.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, Tony.\u201d</p><p>His arm curled around your back and you felt the stubble\nfrom his jaw scratch at your shoulder as he pressed in close. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d The whisper of his breath tickled your\nskin and set a shiver prickling up your spine.</p><p>\u201cYou know these aren\u2019t private rooms,\u201d the MP deadpanned.</p><p>The snicker had burst past your lips before you could stop\nit. </p><p>\u201cWho hurt you, Ratched? Why does happiness make you so\nangry?\u201d So relieved to be free, and to see Tony, your stupid web of a brain, had\ncharged full steam ahead. </p><p>As you reached to put a hand on the MP\u2019s elbow, all mock sympathy\nand snark, Tony snapped out to pull you back with a firm grip on your wrist.\nThe scowl from the officer was enough to have you biting back another giggle. </p><p>\u201cOkay, no touching the Military Police,\u201d Tony, instructed,\nrushing you through the door as another officer led the way out of the tunnel\nof hallways. \u201cLet\u2019s get you out of here without any new charges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d you mumbled.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t take you anywhere,\u201d he teased under his breath. He\ngave you a familiar squeeze as he guided you into the elevator with an arm\nstill securely around your waist.</p><p>\u201cFor the record,\u201d you argued, as was your wont. \u201cI took\nmyself\u2026 well not here. Where is here, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisneyworld.\u201d</p><p>You looked up at him with a frown and a sigh but he barely\ncracked even a hint of a smile.</p><p>\u201cThe Pentagon!\u201d he finally shouted. \u201cHow in the hell did you\nland yourself on the brink of actual oblivion in the basement of the fucking\nPentagon?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, relax. It was an ex\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cIf you say \u2018It was an experiment,\u2019 I will lock you up\nmyself. Are you insane?\u201d His warm brown eyes had turned hard and angry as they\nbore into you.</p><p>By now you\u2019d left the elevator and you\u2019d practically jogged\nto the front desk to keep up with his quick pace. His questioning stare never\nleft you as he slammed his visitor badge down onto the counter and they handed\nyou a plastic bag with your belongings.</p><p>\u201cUm okay how about it was a\u2026 uh\u2026 <i>test,</i> then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh for the love of\u2026\u201d He rolled his eyes and turned away\nfrom you briefly. \u201cYou know they could have killed you on sight, right? Like a\ncarnival shooting game. The one with the ducks? What is that called. The one\u2026\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cDucks? I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\nYou grinned up at him as you leaned into the heavy door and spun out into the\nwarm summer air. The humid night closed around you like a comforting embrace\ncompared to the icy bite of the rigid air conditioned building you\u2019d just fled.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, the one where you were a sitting duck, and they\ncould have legally <i>shot you!</i> in the\nhead!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell that would have been an extremely rude way to greet a\nguest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have been killed!\u201d he shouted. Somehow his hands\nwere around yours and he had pulled you close, eyes dancing back and forth over\nface, searching for you to recognize how serious this was. \u201cYou broke into the\nWhite House! They were gonna bury you in some basement cell until you were\nforgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou worry too much, you know that?\u201d</p><p>He blinked at you, frustrated, and afraid, and for once in\nhis life, out of words.</p><p>This was always how your arguments progressed. There was nothing\nserious enough for you where Tony was all in, stakes so high he might snap.</p><p>You were like that one perfect summer: a light breath and a\nrash decision, laughter and risks. An exciting toy others always seemed to want\nto hold in their hands but not to keep. A pleasure but a liability. </p><p>When you met him, Tony had seemed a match for your spontaneity.\nBut in the end, he worried. Too much, and constantly. He couldn\u2019t stand to\nwatch the destruction of your fire and you wouldn\u2019t let yourself be dimmed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 nobody\u2019s ever accused me of that particular crime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you don\u2019t let people see you,\u201d you offered a\nsad smile and stepped closer, closing the distance, the miles, the years that\nhad separated you all this time. \u201cBut I still do.\u201d Your forehead pressed to his\nand your eyes remained locked on his, warm and open and so wonderfully,\ncomfortingly, familiar.</p><p>He sighed, relenting. Letting the argument go for now. There\nwas no other way; there never was with you two.</p><p>A slow smirk pulled at your lips when he lifted his gaze\nback to your face.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna see how I did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He was firm and he shook his head, moving yours with\nit, foreheads still pressed together. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah you do,\u201d you laughed, trying to nod against his rhythm.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he laughed but then growled your name as he dragged\nyou down the stairs of the building by the elbow. Like you were kids, like he\nwas scolding you for sneaking into the lab at MIT again. Like you were young\nand free, pushing boundaries and chasing dreams. Somewhere along the way,\nthough he\u2019d found his dreams and caught them.</p><p>You dug through the plastic bag, searching for the small\npiece of technology that had brought you here.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d he sighed, holding the car door open for you.\n\u201cTerms of your release. A very strongly worded Cease And Desist.\u201d</p><p>Your eyes went wide and you took one last look inside the\nbag.</p><p>\u201cThey took it.\u201d The defeat in your voice was palpable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d and he was. He knew too well what it was like to\nhave your work seized and used in ways you would never know, intend, or\napprove. \u201cIt was the only way to guarantee your release.\u201d</p><p>It ached like a part of your chest had been taken. Your work\nwas your heart. It gave you purpose and direction and it was gone.</p><p>\u201cYou know you can\u2019t just teleport inside the President\u2019s\nbedroom,\u201d he soothed, sweeping gentle hands over your arms and pulled you\nclose. Tony gave the best hugs. </p><p>\u201cGross,\u201d you mumbled against his chest, face scrunched into\na grimace. \u201cThat\u2019s the last place I want to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere <i>do</i> you want\nto be?\u201d he asked, stroking a hand over your hair. \u201cName it and we\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>You sighed and lifted your face, resting your chin on his\nchest. The cold metal of the arc reactor made you smile. Tony\u2019s work would\nnever be separated from him, he\u2019d made sure of that. At least some of the good\nones win.</p><p>\u201cCheeseburger,\u201d you moaned. \u201cI need a cheeseburger.\u201d</p><p>A laugh rippled through his chest and shook your body. The\nsound was high and true; a real, genuine giggle. It pulled a grin to your lips.</p><p>He tipped his head down and kissed the tip of your nose.\n\u201cOkay. I know a place.\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"720\" data-orig-height=\"38\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/54012d682d6a462beb79985bbb939b83/tumblr_inline_po0rr2G6xM1uvseau_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"720\" data-orig-height=\"38\"></figure><p>Will reblog with tags shortly</p>",

Why does happiness make you so\nangry?&rdquo; So relieved to be free, and to see Tony, your stupid web of a brain, had\ncharged full steam ahead. </p><p>As you reached to put a hand on the MP&rsquo;s elbow, all mock sympathy\nand snark, Tony snapped out to pull you back with a firm grip on your wrist.\nThe scowl from the officer was enough to have you biting back another giggle. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, no touching the Military Police,&rdquo; Tony, instructed,\nrushing you through the door as another officer led the way out of the tunnel\nof hallways. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get you out of here without any new charges.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; you mumbled.</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t take you anywhere,&rdquo; he teased under his breath. He\ngave you a familiar squeeze as he guided you into the elevator with an arm\nstill securely around your waist.</p><p>&ldquo;For the record,&rdquo; you argued, as was your wont. &ldquo;I took\nmyself&hellip; well not here. Where is here, anyway?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Disneyworld.&rdquo;</p><p>You looked up at him with a frown and a sigh but he barely\ncracked even a hint of a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;The Pentagon!&rdquo; he finally shouted. &ldquo;How in the hell did you\nland yourself on the brink of actual oblivion in the basement of the fucking\nPentagon?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, relax. It was an ex&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you say &lsquo;It was an experiment,&rsquo; I will lock you up\nmyself. Are you insane?&rdquo; His warm brown eyes had turned hard and angry as they\nbore into you.</p><p>By now you&rsquo;d left the elevator and you&rsquo;d practically jogged\nto the front desk to keep up with his quick pace. His questioning stare never\nleft you as he slammed his visitor badge down onto the counter and they handed\nyou a plastic bag with your belongings.</p><p>&ldquo;Um okay how about it was a&hellip; uh&hellip; <i>test,</i> then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh for the love of&hellip;&rdquo; He rolled his eyes and turned away\nfrom you briefly. &ldquo;You know they could have killed you on sight, right? Like a\ncarnival shooting game. The one with the ducks? What is that called. The one&hellip;&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ducks? I don&rsquo;t&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo;\nYou grinned up at him as you leaned into the heavy door and spun out into the\nwarm summer air. The humid night closed around you like a comforting embrace\ncompared to the icy bite of the rigid air conditioned building you&rsquo;d just fled.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah, the one where you were a sitting duck, and they\ncould have legally <i>shot you!</i> in the\nhead!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well that would have been an extremely rude way to greet a\nguest.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You could have been killed!&rdquo; he shouted. Somehow his hands\nwere around yours and he had pulled you close, eyes dancing back and forth over\nface, searching for you to recognize how serious this was. &ldquo;You broke into the\nWhite House! They were gonna bury you in some basement cell until you were\nforgotten.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You worry too much, you know that?&rdquo;</p><p>He blinked at you, frustrated, and afraid, and for once in\nhis life, out of words.</p><p>This was always how your arguments progressed. There was nothing\nserious enough for you where Tony was all in, stakes so high he might snap.</p><p>You were like that one perfect summer: a light breath and a\nrash decision, laughter and risks. An exciting toy others always seemed to want\nto hold in their hands but not to keep. A pleasure but a liability. </p><p>When you met him, Tony had seemed a match for your spontaneity.\nBut in the end, he worried. Too much, and constantly. He couldn&rsquo;t stand to\nwatch the destruction of your fire and you wouldn&rsquo;t let yourself be dimmed.</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip; nobody&rsquo;s ever accused me of that particular crime.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you don&rsquo;t let people see you,&rdquo; you offered a\nsad smile and stepped closer, closing the distance, the miles, the years that\nhad separated you all this time. &ldquo;But I still do.&rdquo; Your forehead pressed to his\nand your eyes remained locked on his, warm and open and so wonderfully,\ncomfortingly, familiar.</p><p>He sighed, relenting. Letting the argument go for now. There\nwas no other way; there never was with you two.</p><p>A slow smirk pulled at your lips when he lifted his gaze\nback to your face.</p><p>&ldquo;You wanna see how I did it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He was firm and he shook his head, moving yours with\nit, foreheads still pressed together. &ldquo;Absolutely not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah you do,&rdquo; you laughed, trying to nod against his rhythm.</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he laughed but then growled your name as he dragged\nyou down the stairs of the building by the elbow. Like you were kids, like he\nwas scolding you for sneaking into the lab at MIT again. Like you were young\nand free, pushing boundaries and chasing dreams. Somewhere along the way,\nthough he&rsquo;d found his dreams and caught them.</p><p>You dug through the plastic bag, searching for the small\npiece of technology that had brought you here.</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he sighed, holding the car door open for you.\n&ldquo;Terms of your release. A very strongly worded Cease And Desist.&rdquo;</p><p>Your eyes went wide and you took one last look inside the\nbag.</p><p>&ldquo;They took it.&rdquo; The defeat in your voice was palpable.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; and he was. He knew too well what it was like to\nhave your work seized and used in ways you would never know, intend, or\napprove. &ldquo;It was the only way to guarantee your release.&rdquo;</p><p>It ached like a part of your chest had been taken. Your work\nwas your heart. It gave you purpose and direction and it was gone.</p><p>&ldquo;You know you can&rsquo;t just teleport inside the President&rsquo;s\nbedroom,&rdquo; he soothed, sweeping gentle hands over your arms and pulled you\nclose. Tony gave the best hugs. </p><p>&ldquo;Gross,&rdquo; you mumbled against his chest, face scrunched into\na grimace. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the last place I want to be.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where <i>do</i> you want\nto be?&rdquo; he asked, stroking a hand over your hair. &ldquo;Name it and we&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p><p>You sighed and lifted your face, resting your chin on his\nchest. The cold metal of the arc reactor made you smile. Tony&rsquo;s work would\nnever be separated from him, he&rsquo;d made sure of that. At least some of the good\nones win.</p><p>&ldquo;Cheeseburger,&rdquo; you moaned. &ldquo;I need a cheeseburger.&rdquo;</p><p>A laugh rippled through his chest and shook your body. The\nsound was high and true; a real, genuine giggle. It pulled a grin to your lips.</p><p>He tipped his head down and kissed the tip of your nose.\n&ldquo;Okay. I know a place.&rdquo;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/54012d682d6a462beb79985bbb939b83/tumblr_inline_po0rr2G6xM1uvseau_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Will reblog with tags shortly</p>",
