        "body": "<p>Disclaimer: Some of the probably tiny amount of\nreaders this is gonna get are probably asking themselves, \u201cWhat? Failed? Bitch,\nwhere? T/ony and Peter are <i>the</i>\nfather/son duo.\u201d Answer: in reality, objectively. I used to be a fan of the\ndynamic, because I love both Peter Parker and the \u201cfound family\u201d trope, but\nI\u2019ve given the matter a lot of thought (that\u2019s actually the reason I\u2019m sitting\ndown to write it; I\u2019m hoping to put it in words to put it out of my thoughts)\nand I\u2019m calling them how I see them.<br/></p><p>Fair warning: To/ny stans, if they don\u2019t want\nto get upset, shouldn\u2019t read this. It won\u2019t be bashing him, I\u2019ll be trying to\nbe fair, but it will be critical of him. You shouldn\u2019t see this, since I\u2019m\ntagging it accordingly, but maybe a Spider-Man fan who also likes T/ony, is new\nto the fandom and hasn\u2019t blacklisted \u201canti T/ony st/ark\u201d might find it. </p><p>Also, I might be slightly biased because of\nwhat I know from the Spider-Man comics, which I\u2019m in the process of reading\nnow, but of which I knew very little when I first thought of this. I will be\nbringing up those few things that I knew, not because I think that the movie\nshould be absolutely identical to it, but because it\u2019s actually relevant to the\nargument. (Although from what I\u2019ve seen in the comics and what I\u2019ve read from\npeople who know better than me, there is plenty of reason to be offended by the\nmovie and it\u2019s \u201caccuracy\u201d that has nothing to do with gate-keeping nitpicking.)</p><p>Last, I\u2019ll be adding slightly off-topic\nopinions between [these]. I won\u2019t start talking about Black Panther, but they\u2019ll\nbe subjective comments (right or wrong) and won\u2019t have much to do with the\nactual argument. Don\u2019t want to read the, don\u2019t read them; if you disagree, you\ndisagree. It\u2019s your opinion and you can do what you want just like this is my\npost and I do what I want, but, like I said, the actual argument will be\nseparate from them, so it should be read accordingly. (No saying my argument is\nwrong because I prefer Seven Up over Sprite.) </p><p>Now, to the actual thing.</p><!-- more --><p>An ideal mentor should provide the mentee with:\ntraining (in whatever form this training takes, i.e. it counts if it\u2019s just\nadvice on life), support (the emotional kind), aid (more substantial support;\nequipment and actions fall into this category), a clear set of rules, respect\n(not that of an equal in the field the mentorship\u2019s taking place, but at least\nthat of a person to another, enough to see the mentee for what they are), fair feedback\n(appropriate encouragement when they do something right, appropriate punishment\nwhen they do something wrong), frequent if not constant assessment. This last\none is especially important to make sure all these other things are being done\nadequately (it would be useless to try to teach a 5<sup>th</sup> grader math\ngenius how to add, unfair to tell them that they can\u2019t sleep over at a friend\u2019s\nhouse because you\u2019re afraid they\u2019ll get home sick and want to go home when\nthey\u2019ve been doing it for a while now) and to give the mentee a sense of\nreliability, since a relationship has to be maintained by two people, and a\nmentee that doesn\u2019t trust their mentor won\u2019t let them perform their duties. </p><p>Most importantly, though, the mentor has to give\nall of this to the mentee as tools to use for themselves, understanding that\neventually they should outgrow the need for mentoring. (Which doesn\u2019t mean\noutgrowing the need/desire for the relationship itself. More in the sense of graduating\nand going from a friendly relationship with a teacher to becoming actual\nfriends who respect each other as equals and aren\u2019t part of an imbalanced\nrelationship the way that of a mentor/mentee is.) This requires a very exact\ndistance which allows the mentor to carry out their duties and receive feedback\nwhile still letting the mentee be their own person and grow on their own.</p><p>T/ony fails to provide everything but aid. I\nconsidered including fair feedback, but even that misses the \u201cfair\u201d part.</p><p><br/></p><hr><h2><br/></h2><h2>SENSE OF RELIABILITY: FAIL</h2><p>T/ony doesn\u2019t communicate with Peter, leading\nhim to think he can\u2019t rely on him.</p><p>There are ways to refute this statement, such\nas pointing out the suit, which T/ony made to protect Peter and into which he\nseemed to have put a lot of effort, or that he was listening to Peter\u2019s messages,\nsince he was able to mention the churro lady. I\u2019ll address this later on. Right\nnow, I\u2019ll only say that what\u2019s important isn\u2019t being reliable<sup>1</sup>, but\ngiving Peter a sense of reliability, which he failed to do, and so he disobeyed\nhim at every turn. We can assume that Peter stopped giving Happy updates, so he\nstopped putting effort in the relationship, and when T/ony went to confront him\nwhen he messed up, Peter refused to acknowledge any kind of authority on his\npart except right of ownership of the suit. It could be said that this was\nbecause Peter was trying to prove himself worthy of becoming an Avenger and it\nwas just childish rebellion and, while I wouldn\u2019t disagree, I\u2019d say that, be\nthat as it may, Peter still rejected and circumvented T/ony\u2019s authority. He was\nconvinced he was wrong and tried to prove it by doing things on his own.<sup>2</sup></p><p>[1: Which T/ony wasn\u2019t, anyway. 2: As he\u2019d been\ndoing all along.]</p><p><br/></p><hr><h2><br/></h2><h2>TRAINING: FAIL</h2><p>T/ony doesn\u2019t train Peter. He doesn\u2019t meet\nPeter until he\u2019s had his powers for 6 months, probably has been Spider-Man for\naround 5, and has established himself as a \u201ccool\u201d (enough to have more than one\nvideo on YouTube<sup>1</sup>) vigilante, if not a hero in his own right. He\ngoes to Germany and holds his own against both Sam and Bucky, even with all his\nfanboying<sup>2</sup>. He saved Rhodey from crashing into a plane. He was\nessential in beating Scott.<sup> 3 4</sup></p><p>By the time CA:CW rolls around, ability wise, Peter\nhas a handle on things<sup>5</sup> that, while not perfect, can improve only\nwith experience, which also goes for his ability to assess and react to a\nsituation accordingly, and seems to have a grip on the direction of his career\n(go on patrol, help the \u201clittle guy\u201d). He could handle himself in his chosen\npath and was no push-over when taken out of his element. Which is a good thing,\nsince the only \u201ctraining\u201d he gave him, besides indoctrination to keep him from\nlistening to Cap, was \u201caim for the legs\u201d.</p><p>In Homecoming, for most of the movie Peter uses\nthe St/ark suit. The only two features we see him use are: the new webshooters\nand the tracing chip (the one he uses himself). We can assume that, as far as\nPeter knows until his first fight with the Vulture, that\u2019s all it does. Then, T/ony\ntells him that he put everything into his suit. Peter doesn\u2019t really look into\nit, even after he finds out there\u2019s a tracer in his suit. He hacks into it to\ntake the tracer out and Ned tells him about the training wheels. More on some\nof this stuff later. What\u2019s important now is that Peter wasn\u2019t trained in how\nto use the suit. He wasn\u2019t even told he was supposed to be trained. He didn\u2019t\nknow about the suit\u2019s capabilities and, until he takes a moment to see for\nhimself how it works, i.e. train himself, again, it actually hinders him.</p><p>[1: I mean, to be fair, the first video,\nbecause of the way it\u2019s framed (static and with Peter swinging right in front\nof it) and how convenient it is that someone was just recording a hijacking\nPeter was there to stop, was probably made by Peter himself. 2: Fun fact, Word\ntried to change fanboying into annoying. Tea. 3: This is meant as a comment on\nhis ability, not the other Avengers, but, since Scott couldn\u2019t break the\nwebbing on his legs, he also probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to break it if he\nwas wrapped upon it completely, so, hypothetically, Peter could have tied him\nup and delivered the last punch himself. 4: What a pity he lost not only most\nof his skill but also his commons sense and smarts by Homecoming. I mean, he\ndoes know he\u2019s in New York, right? Why was his best idea to get the bike back\nto its owner to leave it in the middle of the sidewalk? 5: (this one will make\nme sound At least biased, at most, obsessed) of the powers Feige saw fit to let\nhim keep, which amount to strength and his Spider-sense limited by contrivances\n(show that he has it and make him cooler in a fight, but drop it when it could\ncome useful, like with the drone). Just to give you an idea: in the comics,\nPeter is fast enough that people often say that he can\u2019t be human. The Green\nGoblin says that he\u2019s impressed by his agility. Unless it doesn\u2019t fit the plot,\nhis Spidey- sense lets him fight people in the dark. All these combined allow\nhim to dodge bullets. Apply this knowledge to his fight scenes. Also apply his\nstickiness and the fact that he\u2019s super strong while Cap\u2019s supposed to be at\nhuman peak, as in, he\u2019s the best any human can be, but still human, to his\nfight with Cap. Would Cap still have beaten him? Of effing course, but the\nfight would have been more about strategy than outright punches. Not completely\nthough, his punches would still have been effective. I mean, kinda. I can\nactually see the fight happening as it did (except when Cap pulls Peter to him)\nin the comics, even with Peter not being wet around the ears as he is in CA:CW.\nI guess I mostly wanted to comment on his powers. Also, he has a super-human\nsense of balance, so him wobbling on the hero landing was shit.]</p><p><br/></p><hr><h2><br/></h2><h2>SUPPORT: FAIL</h2><p>T/ony and Peter talk all of six times during\nthe movie, and that\u2019s being extremely generous, since I\u2019m counting the ferry\ncall, the ferry save, and the post ferry scene as three different occasions.\nI\u2019ll talk about each of them in other sections of the post, but at no point\ndoes T/ony ever provide emotional support to Peter. Him apparently\nreading/listening to his messages but not replying is him not providing\nemotional support. Actually\u2026</p><p>Here it gets <i>heavily</i> T/ony critical. In the post-ferry scene, however you want\nto frame it, went horribly. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong. Peter deserved a lecture. More.\nHe, if you\u2019ll forgive the parlance in the \u201cobjective\u201d part of the post, fucked\nup. I\u2019m not saying he didn\u2019t. However, the way T/ony went about it was so wrong\nhe provided the exact opposite of emotional support and drove him to tears\nhours after the fact AND to stop being Spider-Man. I know there will be those\nthat will say, \u201cHey, that\u2019s good, right? I mean, first you complain about him\ncondoning his vigilantism and then you complain about him ending it? Make up\nyour mind.\u201d There\u2019s a difference between making a minor understand that they\nshouldn\u2019t do some things for their own safety and making them feel like\nscrew-ups who are nothing without a piece of clothing. </p><p>Because here\u2019s how the scene went. Peter\nscrewed the pooch. T/ony informs him of this. Gives him a bit of a\ntongue-lashing. Peter asks if everyone\u2019s okay. T/ony says no thanks to him. Not\nhow I would have worded it, but I have both the disadvantage of closeness,\nbecause I know what Peter was thinking and I empathize with him because of that<sup>1</sup>,\nand the advantage of distance, because I haven\u2019t landed on a roof after having\nto save all those people in the ferry along with the kid whose life I feel\nresponsible for, after he disobeyed my orders. Peter gives voice to my thoughts:\nhe was trying to protect people<sup>2</sup>, you know, his job. He points out\nthat he had tried to tell T/ony, that he had asked for his help/him to play\ninterference before, but he blew him off.<sup>3</sup> He says that if T/ony\ncared, he\u2019d be there.<sup>4</sup></p><p>Then<sup>5</sup>, T/ony steps out of the suit.\nHe tells him that he\u2019d called the FBI. The FBI would have been \u2013<i>was</i>\u2014useless against the Vulture. Even if\nthey weren\u2019t, Peter didn\u2019t know that, because the only thing T/ony told him was\nthat the weapons dealing was too small for the Avengers<sup>6</sup>, but too\nbig for Peter and to call Happy if he saw them again. Happy, who had been\nignoring Peter like he was a street vendor. And if he knew enough about their\ncommunications to know about the churro lady, he had to know Happy was ignoring\nhim. Actually, I want to quote him. \u201cTake him down now, huh? Crockett,\nthere are people who handle this son of thing.\u201d He told Spider-Man to ignore\nhis responsibilities. </p><p>T/ony, there\u2019s no other way\nto say this, guilt-trips him by saying he was the only one who believed in him<sup>7</sup>.\nHe says he got criticized for choosing to have faith in a 14yo. The only good\nreason to say that would have been to make Peter feel like he was in his debt. Then,\nafter making the, ultimately, but only partially<sup>8</sup>, true assertion\nthat if anyone had died that night it would have been on Peter (I want you to\ntake a second to consider the callousness of telling a 15yo that; change the\nphrasing from \u201con you\u201d to \u201cit\u2019s your fault\u201d), he tells Peter that if he had\ndied, he\u2019d have felt responsible and that he doesn\u2019t need that<sup>9</sup>. He\u2019s\nmaking someone who already feels bad feel worse. That\u2019s not the point of\nlectures. The point of lectures is making someone understand what they did\nwrong, why what they did was wrong, how to avoid it in the future and, maybe,\nhow to fix it. Admittedly<sup>10</sup>, T/ony does that, but he completely\ntears Peter down in the process. I\u2019m not saying that he should be allowed to\nget away scott free, either by T/ony or by the narrative, but that\u2019s not the\nway to do it, because of many reasons, but mainly because Peter gets the wrong\nlesson. This is, first, because T/ony insists on making everything about\nhimself. He blames everything that happened on Peter disobeying him; when Peter\npoints out the way he failed, he makes an argument that, yes, saves him from\nlooking like a complete ass, but fails to address the underlying root of the\nproblem which is that Peter was reacting to the information he had available,\nwhich included absolutely nothing from him except (the illusion of) disregard;\nhe makes himself the victim of the danger <i>Peter</i>\ngets into. </p><p>The last part draws into\nthe second thing Peter got wrong about the lecture, which is that he\u2019s a\nscrew-up. He now not only feels guilty about his own failure, the whole blame\nfor the accident has been laid on him<sup>11</sup>. Then, the coup de gr\u00e2ce.</p><p>T/ony asks for the suit\nback. (This is not it). Peter begs him not to, and then claims he\u2019s nothing\nwithout the suit<sup>12</sup>.</p><p>And T/ony answers that, if\nhe\u2019s nothing without the suit, then he shouldn\u2019t have it<sup>13</sup>.</p><p>And then he takes the suit.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>Put it this way. Peter says\nA. T/ony answers \u201cIf A, then B\u201d (A=&gt;B)<sup>14</sup>. Then T/ony says B.</p><p>I know it\u2019s not what he\nmeant. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what Feige, or Goldstein and Daley intended. Believe\nme, I do. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that T/ony indirectly tells Peter he\u2019s\nnothing, and Peter thinks he\u2019s nothing, and the movie supports this by making\nthe emotional climax of the movie about Peter proving he\u2019s not nothing.</p><p>That is not emotional\nsupport. If it was done often enough, you could make a case for it being\nemotional abuse, especially since it was done at a time when Peter, a child who\nadmires T/ony and so is very impressionable where he\u2019s concerned, was already\nfeeling guilty, so that T/ony\u2019s words reinforce the thought that he\u2019s nothing.\nAnd all of this is in the context of T/ony ignoring Peter for two months,\nappearing to ignore his worries, going back to ignoring him until he messes up,\nmaking the point of the following lecture that everything wrong that had\nhappened on the ferry happened because Peter didn\u2019t obey T/ony\u2019s orders and\nthen, the next time they speak, framing all of that and telling Peter,\nessentially, that he\u2019s nothing, as a \u201cthe tough-love moment that he needed.\u201d</p><p>I believe that the only\nreason a lot of people (I haven\u2019t even seen anyone in the anti-T/ony crowd\npoint this out) let this slide is because the moment follows T/ony\u2019s oh-so-convenient\ncall to Peter and instantly followed itself by his \u201cNow I sound like my father\u201d\nline, where he sets himself up in a fatherly role. This way, when people think\nof the scene, they think it a fatherly lecture without seeming to remember the\nnothing line<sup>15</sup>, or they think it the indispensable set up for the\nwarehouse scene<sup>16</sup>.</p><p>[1: And because he\u2019s the\nprotagonist, and my favorite. 2: I mean, sure, becoming an Avenger was also a\nbig part of his motivations, but the point is that going after supervillians is\nthe heroic thing to do. 3: Throwing in a nice \u201cthis is all your fault\u201d, for\ngood measure. 4: He, but I actually mean the scriptwriters, makes it seem like\nhis whole argument was based on T/ony not caring and Peter being hurt and angry\nand lashing out because of that and not because he had any actual reason for\ngoing to the ferry, since they only address the matter of T/ony caring/listening/being\nthere (at that moment at least, which is supposed to mean/make us think he was\nalways there), and not the consequences of him not showing it. 5: \u2026we start\ngetting emotionally manipulated. 6: With Rhodey disabled, doesn\u2019t that just\nmean T/ony and Vision at this point? 7: First, shitty. Second, as other people\nhave pointed out, he\u2019s, by T/ony\u2019s accounts, which, to respect Peter\u2019s wishes\nand privacy, he should have only given maybe to Pepper and Vision, 14. Maybe\nwhen they asked \u201care you insane?\u201d they were questioning your morals, not your\nsanity. Third, the scene where Happy says he told T/ony that he was a good kid\nmight make this a lie, if that wasn\u2019t Happy trying to take credit. Personally,\nI think the latter, I\u2019ve always thought so. 8: It\u2019s important to me that people\nunderstand that it wasn\u2019t Peter with the gun and, since the FBI was already\nthere ready to bust the deal, the fight would have happened anyway but with\nmore casualties. I mean, they probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to give them\nenough trouble that the ferry would be broken in two, but if T/ony hadn\u2019t\ncalled when he did, he wouldn\u2019t have gone to help. 9: Stop playing the victim.\nAlso, stop making every single one of Peter\u2019s actions about you, now we have\nhis literal death scene made to be all about you. This goes to the stans, too.\nStop making all of Peter\u2019s life about T/ony, Marvel\u2019s already busy at that. 10:\nI disagree with the truthfulness (as in veracity, not sincerity) of what he\u2019s\nsaying, he is explaining all the wh\u2019s. 11: He is to blame for a lot of it. I\nmean, technically, if he hadn\u2019t stopped all his other deals, he might not have\ntried the one in the ferry. Of course that\u2019s nitpicking, because we can\u2019t be\nsure and, as a hero, it\u2019s his job to stop villains and, as Spider-Man, it\u2019s his\n(self-appointed) job to stop crime in general. Then again, let\u2019s not forget,\nyou know, the criminal and the guy who could have given him the information\nthat might have made him decide to stay out of it. 12: The fact that he\u2019d been\nSpider-Man without it for long enough aside\u2026 13: Instead of, you know, telling\nhim it wasn\u2019t true. Actually, a night has gone since I wrote the 12 to mark\nthat I wanted to comment and the moment of writing this, so I don\u2019t remember\nwhat I wanted to say. 14: They give it a relationship of cause-effect, and it\u2019s\nnot the same as B=&gt;A, but for the effect they have on both Peter and the\nmovie, it might as well be an equivalence. 15: Unless they want to make a\nparallel between him and T/ony both being told they\u2019re nothing without the\nsuits (and proving that\u2019s false) because \u201cthey\u2019re so alike! Look at this dad\nand his son!!\u201d without taking a moment to remember who exactly told Peter he\nwas nothing without the suit. 16: I\u2026 don\u2019t understand how this line in that\ncontext can be seen as motivational. The only way it works, even if barely, is\nif we go with the theory that Peter thinks he\u2019s nothing without the suit and T/ony\nagrees with him and he\u2019s lifting the warehouse out of spite. I mean, if he\u2019d\nhis own words (\u201cI\u2019m nothing without this suit\u201d), it could be seen as a moment\nof growth, of telling himself, \u201cI\u2019m still Peter, and I\u2019m still Spider-Man\u201d, but\nhe remembers T/ony\u2019s. His exact words are \u201cIf you\u2019re nothing without this [St/ark]\nsuit, then you shouldn\u2019t have it.\u201d Let\u2019s take a moment and see how Peter\u2019s\nthoughts might have carried him there without spite. If he was thinking of T/ony:\n\u201cI can\u2019t do this on my own, I wish there was someone here to help me. I wish my\npersonal hero, I/ron Man, was here. \u2018If\u2026\u2019 He took the suit away, so I\u2019m\nnothing. I don\u2019t even have a way to contact him.\u201d Without a \u201cwow, what a dick,\nI\u2019m gonna prove him wrong\u201d thrown in there, I can\u2019t see a way for that to lead\nto any inspiration to lift the warehouse. If he was thinking of the suit: \u201cGod,\nI\u2019m trapped down here, I\u2019ve tried to lift this off, but I couldn\u2019t, and to top\nit off all I have is this useless suit, not even a phone, or an AI to comfort\nme the way the other one did. \u2018If\u2026\u2019 So, I can\u2019t lift these walls off me, which\nonly goes to show what T/ony already knew when he took the suit away: I\u2019m\nnothing without it. I lost.\u201d If he was thinking about himself being nothing: \u201cI\ncouldn\u2019t lift these walls, I really am nothing without that suit. \u2018If\u2026\u2019 Yeah,\nMr. St/ark, you were right to take it away.\u201d I mean, let\u2019s forget for a second\nthat the other suit probably wouldn\u2019t have helped him then. There\u2019s no relation\nbetween his current situation and the line except the suit and the theme of\nself-worth, and the line supports the lack of both. What I\u2019m trying to say here\nis that I can\u2019t see any way for that line to not only fit the situation, but to\nlead Peter to gain the strength (of will) to lift the walls. I mean, I could\nsee Peter 616 saving himself out of spite, maybe, but in that context that line\nis like a sore.]</p><p><br/></p><hr><h2><br/></h2><h2>A CLEAR SET OF RULES:\nINCOMPLETE</h2><p>T/ony first gives Peter an\nextremely vague spectrum of which actions are acceptable and which aren\u2019t, and\nlater on gives Peter and order that, in the way it was presented, was anathema\nto what he believes, without explaining his reasoning. The rules, in T/ony\u2019s\nmind, seem to be there, but the only clear direction he gives Peter is to stay\naway from the weapons dealing.</p><p>In the car ride to Peter\u2019s\nhome, T/ony tells Peter, \u201cdon\u2019t do anything I would do, and don\u2019t do anything I\nwouldn\u2019t do.\u201d While the audience might find that joke funny, Peter would only\nknow T/ony from what he\u2019s seen on the media, and that with parental guidance,\nsince he was eight at the most tumultuous, speaking from a PR perspective, part\nof T/ony\u2019s life. While some of us might hear that line and go, \u201cthat\u2019s the best\nadvice you could give a child\u201d, and we are the target of that line, Peter\ndoesn\u2019t know T/ony. He only knows him as I/ron Man and, maybe, as a genius\nengineer. Those directions are worthless to him further than the implied \u201cuse\nyour common sense.\u201d Just so we\u2019re clear, I\u2019m not saying T/ony doesn\u2019t have that<sup>1</sup>,\njust that he\u2019s telling Peter to react in an appropriate manner to the situation\nwithout direction as to what an appropriate reaction would be.</p><p>Then comes Peter\u2019s first fight with the\nVulture, T/ony\u2019s second talk with Peter in the movie, and he tells him to stay\nout of it. He doesn\u2019t say he\u2019ll look into it, he doesn\u2019t tell him to go to the\nauthorities. He tells him not to look into the weapons dealing and, if he does\ncome across it again, to call Happy. Like I said before, if T/ony was\nreading/listening to Peter\u2019s messages, he probably had access to his and\nHappy\u2019s communications, so he knew Happy was lowing Peter off. Maybe he thought\nthat was alright because <i>he</i> was\ngetting the messages and he\u2019d know if there was trouble, but Peter didn\u2019t know\nthat. As I mentioned before, Peter doesn\u2019t feel like T/ony\u2019s reliable, so he\ndidn\u2019t trust T/ony had his best interests at heart or at least he didn\u2019t think\nhe knew what those were.</p><p>Furthermore, when he tried to argue against the\nrule, T/ony broke out the \u201cBecause I said so!\u201d Which is the fallacy of appeal\nto authority. A lot of parents use it, which is why a lot of fans love the\nexchange and, I\u2019ll bet, why the scriptwriters included it, but it\u2019s worthless\nas a logical argument and sure to make most teenagers hurry to do the exact\nopposite of what you said, nevermind a teenager who already thinks you\u2019re\nwrong, that you\u2019ve failed him and sees you as an obstacle to his goals, even as\nhe sees you as the path to them.</p><p>However, I feel like I have to point out that,\nat least, T/ony doesn\u2019t create the rules thinking about himself, but about\nPeter. He was honestly trying to protect him.<sup>2</sup> I think he should get\ncredit for that.</p><p>[1: Although I certainly think so. 2: He\u2019s just\ninept.]</p><p><br/></p><hr><h2><br/></h2><h2>RESPECT: FAIL</h2><p>T/ony consistently looks down on Peter. To be\nfair, most of the times he does this he\u2019s trying to make a joke, but his humor\nis, not only with Peter but with most people, condescending and disrespectful.</p><p>In CA:CW, while he compliments him on his\npowers and inventions, he does it as a power move. Maybe not intentionally, but\ncornering a teenager in his own room and one by one throwing all of his most\ndangerous secrets right in his face like you do it every Tuesday, even as the\nteenager in question gets progressively more agitated, only served to build\nhimself up and put Peter in the spot. Personally, I don\u2019t think that when T/ony\nmentions May he\u2019s implying he\u2019ll tell her about Spider-Man, but there\u2019s no\ndoubt that Peter is feeling like Damocles\u2019 sword was giving him a very close\nshave. He was at a disadvantage, even if T/ony wouldn\u2019t press, even Peter\ndidn\u2019t think T/ony would press.</p><p>From Peter\u2019s video, we know that he didn\u2019t see\nor talk with T/ony at least until they gathered at the airport. T/ony told him\nwhat to do, gave him a tip on how to do it, convinced him not to listen to what\nCap said<sup>1</sup> and sent him off. No explanation given, he gave\ninformation on a need to know basis and didn\u2019t think Peter even needed to know\nthe real reason why they were fighting.</p><p>In the middle of all that, though, I missed a\nstep. He gave Peter the suit. At that particular moment, all that suit had\ngoing for itself were the new webshooters (they may look nicer, but we are\ngiven no reason to believe they are, with the training wheels protocol in\nplace, any better than the original), the (maybe) improved lenses and being\nmore stylish<sup>1</sup>. Meta textually, all it served was to give Spider-Man\nhis suit<sup>2</sup>. In the movie, all the purpose it could have served was,\nif we\u2019re being generous, T/ony wanting Peter to have something nice<sup>3 </sup>or\nnot wanting to be seen badly for bringing someone in rags and, if we\u2019re not, T/ony\npaying for a service.<sup>4</sup></p><p>In the car ride, he makes the joke about May.<sup>5</sup>\nA woman isn\u2019t relevant only in relation to the men in her life and a man is\nsupposed to understand that he doesn\u2019t control the women in his life and that\nthey are not a comment on himself. That said, T/ony was locker room talking\nPeter\u2019s mom. He not only passed him off to Happy, he told him that someone, not\nhim, would call him if they needed him. That was the last Peter heard of him\nfor two months. </p><p>Then comes the fight with the Vulture. That\u2019s\nthe first time Peter hears anything about his suit having a parachute, a tracer\nor a heater. After explaining the whole story to T/ony, he says they can take\nthe Vulture down and T/ony replies with \u201ctaking him down now, huh? Crocket,\nthere are people who handle this sort of things.\u201d He condescendingly tells\nPeter that he\u2019ll be out of the case and when Peter asks if he\u2019ll be the one\nwho\u2019ll handle it, he says it\u2019s too unimportant. That\u2019s when he reveals he isn\u2019t\nthere with Peter but seemingly on vacation in India. From this point on, Peter\nstops trusting T/ony cares about him personally. The \u201cBecause I said so!\u201d line\nmakes an obligatory appearance in this section, because he hasn\u2019t given Peter a\ngood reason not to go after the Vulture. We can guess from his outburst that\nhe\u2019s worried about him, but Peter can only hear his words and they\u2019re telling\nnot to do his job because he says so, and then he goes on to belittle his\nefforts in CW. He has plenty of reasons to believe T/ony sees him as nothing\nbut the kid he picked up and unfortunately got stuck to his hand. He goes on to\ntell Peter to stay with the small stuff and be \u201cfriendly neighborhood\nSpider-Man\u201d.<sup>6</sup></p><p>He bribes him with easy entrance to MIT<sup>7</sup>\nand leaves instead of using that convenient moment to bring up the other things\nthe suit can do, since he won\u2019t be accessing to it until he\u2019s completed the\ntraining T/ony was apparently supposed to give him, and he hasn\u2019t even started\nyet, so it\u2019s not important, right?</p><p>Except Peter accesses to it and, if he wasn\u2019t\nannoyed by T/ony by then, the \u201cTraining Wheels\u201d and the \u201cBaby Monitor\u201d protocol\nwould have finished the job. The first one, admittedly, isn\u2019t that bad in its\nname and not bad at all in its purpose, but it existed in the context of all\nthe other ways T/ony made Peter feel inadequate and like a kid. The Baby\nMonitor, on the other hand, was downright patronizing in its name and a breach\nof privacy that outdid the tracer in the suit.</p><p>Then, out of nowhere, T/ony calls him to\ncongratulate him (pointing out Peter\u2019s lie and ignoring the fact he clearly\ndoesn\u2019t want to talk to him, but then again, he probably programmed the AI to\nconnect his calls directly, so he never much cared about that) and inserts\nhimself in the role of a father to this kid he\u2019s talked to four times (this is\na manipulation from Marvel). At every point he disregards Peter\u2019s wishes, going\nso far as to tell him not to cut him off when Peter says he\u2019s in the middle of\nsomething. That call wasn\u2019t about Peter, it was about himself. </p><p>The mission goes sideways until T/ony gets\nthere and saves everyone. I\u2019m hesitant to include the \u201cI think you\u2019ve done\nenough\u201d line since Peter did mess up and its delivery wasn\u2019t condescending so\nmuch as angry. </p><p>During their talk post-ferry, the talk is\npeppered with \u201cstereotypical parental lecture\u201d catchphrases, which is what fans\nwant to see, I assume, is why no one bothers to notice how inappropriate it is\nfor someone whose interactions with a kid can\u2019t amount to more than a day all\nput together to insert himself as a father figure in his life and then start\nwith methods such as constantly making reference to his authority as an adult\ninstead of making actual arguments. \u201cI\u2019m fifteen\u201d may not have been the most\ndevastating of all smackdowns, but \u201cThis is where you zip it! The adults are\ntalking\u201d is an immediate and absolute shut down of communication, because, even\nif the other person rebels against it and keeps talking, the \u201cadult\u201d already\nexpressed unwillingness to listen. And I\u2019ve talked about how he puts Peter in\nhis debt with his comment about others thinking he was crazy for recruiting a\n\u201c14\u201d year old (see how the age gap and so his superiority just grows), but here\nhe also makes it as though Peter was at fault for that for being young, while\nalso telling him how no one else believes in him, while <i>also</i> implying he doesn\u2019t believe in him anymore.<sup>8</sup></p><p>Then he takes the suit away. I think that was\nthe right choice. I mean, personally, I don\u2019t see how it was that much better\nthan his own suit beyond looking better and being better for the acrobatics\nhe\u2019s known for<sup>9</sup> until he hacks it, but he\u2019s not supposed to access\nto all the suit\u2019s capabilities anyway (again, something I agree with). It\u2019s\njust a toy, but one that enabled him to go against T/ony\u2019s orders and taking it\naway is the best way to punish him (if it was apart from the \u201cnothing\u201d issue)\nand keep him from repeating is actions. There\u2019s not much to criticize about his\nchoice to take the suit away \u00a0(again,\nexcept for the conversation which gave that choice context) except maybe that,\nbecause that suit was the only thing that tied the two of them together, taking\nit away was basically giving up on the relationship, but I\u2019ve already explained\nthat the relationship was based on Peter admiring T/ony and what he\nrepresented, reaching out and lashing out when he perceived rejection and T/ony\nignoring Peter, so it\u2019s not much of a loss. There\u2019s especially nothing to\ncriticize in regards of T/ony disrespecting Peter.</p><p>Nothing, that is, except the clothes. It isn\u2019t\nonly humiliating and, if the writers had a bit of common sense, a sign for May\nthat something bad happened<sup>10</sup>, it\u2019s also petty and vindictive in a\nway that casts a bad light on the good parts of his lecture, which are already\nfew, because they don\u2019t seem to come from the right place, one of genuine\nintent to do right by Peter, but out of desire to take out his anger on him.<sup>11</sup></p><p>Their next interaction is when Peter \u201chas\nproven himself to T/ony\u201d and gets invited to the upstate facility. Without the\nslightest hesitation, a thought spared to whether Peter harbored any resentment\nfor the way he was treated (even if T/ony doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s done anything <i>wrong</i>, he has to know, because sometimes\nthat\u2019s what he was going for, that he upset Peter, as all people get upset when\nthey\u2019re lectured and punished), T/ony throws an arm over Peter\u2019s shoulders\nwelcomes him back and takes credit for motivating Peter, even though he went\nagainst T/ony\u2019s wishes, after a talk in which he was torn down for not doing as\nhe said. He paid so little mind to Peter himself that he planned the rest of\nhis life in advance for him, starting<sup>12</sup> right then, as soon as he\nsuited up, with dozens of reporters waiting to drill the fifteen year old whose\nonly exposure to attention greater than that of his class when he answered a\nteacher\u2019s question was at AcaDec. Then Peter rejects him and he lets him go,\nafter a quick \u201clook at me (I\u2019m the best thing that could ever happen to you).\nStill no? Okay, I\u2019ll take this in a dignified way since you\u2019re so adorable. I\nmean, look at it! It\u2019s so smart, it\u2019s almost like it understands what you\u2019re\nsaying!\u201d That may seem like I\u2019m being mean-spirited, but with the billionaire\nsaying he digs the \u201cworking-class hero vibe\u201d?<sup>13</sup> It\u2019s not. </p><p>I repeat, most of T/ony\u2019s moments of\ncondescendence are either jokes or T/ony\u2019s/RDJ\u2019s way of carrying himself that\nmight make mostly innocuous comments offensive or probably his way of lashing\nout when he\u2019s angry or upset. It\u2019s not planned or out of maliciousness, just\nthoughtlessness. If it wasn\u2019t, he probably would have told Peter that it wasn\u2019t\na test when he asked<sup>14</sup>, to manipulate him, maybe guilt him into\nagreeing. That doesn\u2019t change their effect.</p><p>[1: Afraid he\u2019ll agree? 2: Stop making every\nclassic Spider-Man thing about T/ony. 3: How convenient that T/ony knew exactly\neverything that Peter needed and put it in the suit even before meeting and\ntalking to him or that he had time to add it while planning for the fight,\nbefore he got to his hotel room. 3: This explains why he\u2019s so comfortable just\ndropping him then picking him up whenever it suits him, and also it makes sense\nas an investment. Pay your workers well and reap the benefits of their\nwellbeing and the skills they develop while/by working for you. 5: Why do I\nhave to go through this with everyone but Peter? I\u2019d say every man, but I\nwouldn0t know, since May only appears on screen to show what a cool mom she is\nto his nephew and to be slobbered over by men, they deleted the one scene where\nshe could have been shown as her own person and as someone who raised the boy\nwho\u2019d become Spider-Man because hey <i>why\nwould I bother showing that when I could point out how hot Aunt May who\u2019s\ninitially characterized by being ill and a bit doddering but <b>who pushes through that and her grief over\nthe loss of her husband(s) with her immense strength of will and inspired by\nher caring for her boy just as he pushes through the grief of life with his\nimmense strength of will probably learned from her and inspired by his caring\nfor his mom/aunt/and uncle/dad.</b></i> 6: Stahhhhp. 7: Let him go to ESU, you\ncowards. (I literally just remembered T/ony went to MIT. First, wow, another\nparallel, much surprised. Second, a good chance to set him apart from T/ony and\nlet him be his own person, as many fans who disagree with Peter having a mentor\nbut like their relationship have say is probably what\u2019s going to happen. Third,\nyou\u2019re taking ESU disaster student Peter Parker from my cold, dead hands and\ntrigger the curse of the mummy so I\u2019ll come back to life, take it back and beat\nyou on the head with it. 8: The more I think about that scene the hotter my\nblood boils. 9: Except in the MCU because who cares about anything but\nstrength? Oh, yeah, and sticky fingers. 10: Her teenager disappeared from school\nat a point in his life where he\u2019s making a lot of bad decisions all of a sudden\nand he comes back home in tears and thrown together clothes? Listen, I\u2019m not\nfrom New York, I don\u2019t know exactly how bad crime is over there, but that\u2019s\nsure to raise a red alert in anyone, right? 11: I didn\u2019t recognize that shirt\nas Pepper\u2019s when I watched the movie, and I don\u2019t think we were meant to. I\nthink we were just supposed to think he went ahead and bought the most\nembarrassing outfit he could find, so I\u2019m not including that in the main body.\n12: with a nice fuck you to May, but I\u2019m used to the scriptwriters\u2019 attitude\ntowards her by now. 13: To Spider-Man, who, even though they didn\u2019t bother to\nestablish the Parkers as struggling with money (beyond Peter dumpster diving)\nand, really, given the times and May\u2019s youth still wouldn\u2019t lead to Peter\nworking as a teenager and having a lot of his problems/anxieties revolving\naround money, is still a character who\u2019s characterized by <i>a lot of his problems/anxieties revolving around money</i>? 14: Also,\nnice way of destroying the only development you gave to the character that\ndidn\u2019t require you to get rid of the other things you\u2019ve established in the\nprevious movie. He wants to look after the little guy? Now he just wants to be an\nAvenger. He was clever, made his own computers and equipment and came up with\nplans/strategized? Now he lacks common sense and he\u2019s only smart academically\nand because people say so. He was able to go toe-to-toe with Avengers? Now he\u2019s\njust plain incompetent and can\u2019t even swing. He cared enough about school that\nhe wouldn\u2019t just eff off to Germany, even if T/ony St/ark asked? Now he\u2019s just\nwaiting for the call and ready to drop out and move upstate. And then when he\u2019s\nfinally getting his priorities straight, he ruins it and asks if it was a test.\nDo you just throw shit at a wall and hope it sticks or did you actually plan to\ngive him character development but got scared that something would go wrong and\nplayed it down?]</p><p><br/></p><hr><h2><br/></h2><h2>FAIR FEEDBACK: INCOMPLETE</h2><p>On my count, T/ony shows Peter a reaction to\nhis actions five times. Of those, two of them are exaggerated and one is\ncomplicated, as I will explain shortly.</p><p>The first two, will be analyzed together due to\ntheir similarity<sup>1</sup>, are in CA:CW, in the bedroom scene, and in the\ncar scene in Homecoming. Although, as I\u2019ve explained, there are problems with\nthe context of that praise, it\u2019s honest and an appropriate response when you\nthink someone\u2019s skilled. A simple \u201cthis is good work\u201d, just like in the car\nscene. That time, he\u2019s technically talking to May about Peter\u2019s (fictitious)\nwork at the retreat, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stretch to say it\u2019s meant for\nPeter.</p><p>The third feedback moment, the complicated one,\nis the phone call right before the ferry accident. I say it\u2019s complicated\nbecause, in the context of everything else we\u2019ve seen before in the movie, that\nwas out of character and mostly for plot convenience. Despite that, what we get\nto hear shows it would have been \u201cfair feedback\u201d, at least given what T/ony\nknows, and possibly a turning point for their relationship that might have led\nto a good mentorship, if it hadn\u2019t come at that particular moment. He calls\nafter hearing about him saving his friends at Washington and mentions \u201cgreat\nthings to come, which we can assume means the training which would have led to\nmore frequent<sup>2</sup> interaction and communication which would probably\nhave solved most of the problems I\u2019ve pointed out. However, from an objective\npoint of view, that feedback wasn\u2019t fair, since the Washington incident was\nPeter\u2019s fault. He was the one who brought the Chitauri energy core and left it\nwith his non-powered friend after just picking it off the streets and\nirresponsibly not telling the police or anyone who could deal with it better\nthan him (except T/ony) and carrying it around on him. Those actions deserved\npunishment. He also used it to disobey T/ony\u2019s orders and investigate the\nVulture\u2019s operations. If he had had this information, T/ony most likely\nwouldn\u2019t have congratulated him. Peter, by not giving him all the information,\nprevented him from performing his duties as a mentor correctly, but this\nhappened because T/ony failed to provide him with a sense of reliability and\nalienating him by not respecting him. This leaves us, for the purposes of this\nsection, with a situation in which T/ony doesn\u2019t actually give Peter fair\nfeedback, but it isn\u2019t completely his fault.</p><p>The fourth time is the post-ferry lecture. In\nthis case, he was right to choose to punish Peter, but wrong in the delivery of\nthat punishment. I\u2019ve explained everything that bothers me about this scene: T/ony\nis condescending in how he says things; his chastisement is based around Peter\nnot listening to him instead of the things he actually did wrong and led to him\nendangering people, among which are being too eager to please him and his whole\ninvolvement with the Chitauri energy core, which didn\u2019t actually affect the\noutcome of the ferry accident; his whole lecture does more harm than good.\nThen, by taking away the suit, he ends the relationship with Peter. That\u2019s his\nreaction to, to his knowledge, Peter\u2019s first strike. Instead of trying to fix\nthings, he just discards him. Maybe he planned to give it back, but that would\nmake the threat intentionally manipulative, which would be even worse.</p><p>The fifth time is at the upstate facility\nwhere, after Peter did everything he told him not to, again, which he punished\nhim for before, he praises him<sup>3</sup> and offers to make him an Avenger<sup>4</sup>.\nPeter does what he was punished for doing before, which includes endangering people\nthe same way he did at the ferry (he showed up to fight crime, things went\nsideways and he tried to fix it. The only difference is that he needed help in\nthe ferry while both the plane and the beach were miraculously empty), only he\nsucceeds this time, and T/ony\u2019s reaction is to give him everything he wants.\nI\u2019m not saying Peter doesn\u2019t deserve reward, I\u2019m saying that T/ony\u2019s is over\nthe top, not only because he doesn\u2019t deserve it, but also because it would end\nup being bad for him. The Avengers are the Big Leagues and he\u2019s not ready for\nit.<sup>5</sup> Even if they took the time to train him, he\u2019d have to upend his\nlife as Peter Parker, even if he didn\u2019t reveal his identity.<sup>6</sup> He\u2019d\nhave to drop out, and tell his Aunt at the very least, since her life would be\nupended, too. He\u2019s not getting what he thinks he\u2019s buying since the Avengers at\nthat point are not the idealized elite who saved him and all the world when he\nwas eight, but just T/ony, Vision and a disabled and probably still recovering\nRhodey, who are bound by the Accords and now completely beholden to the UN. If\nyou\u2019re doing Peter Parker right, he\u2019ll never agree to only acting when he\u2019s\nallowed, or doing something he thinks is wrong. They got this right in the\nmovie by making him go against T/ony even though he\u2019s his hero. If it\u2019s true\nthat T/ony told people that he recruited a teenager and they were judgmental,\nhe\u2019ll be exposed to that skepticism.<sup>7</sup> He\u2019ll be (immediately) exposed\nto the media\u2019s scrutiny as the new Avenger, and the one that came after Civil\nWar. </p><p>What I\u2019m trying to say with all this is that\nonce again T/ony\u2019s reaction is over-the-top and inappropriate. He also gives\nPeter the wrong message: succeed and I\u2019ll give you the world; fail and I\u2019ll\ntake it away. There is also the small uncomfortable matter that, while this may\nnot have held weight in his decision, Peter\u2019s success was closely tied with\ndoing T/ony a favor by saving his plane. It wasn\u2019t the point, but it goes to\nshow that constantly trying to make everything about T/ony has its downsides.</p><p>[1:and because all I have to say about each of\nthem is \u201cyou didn\u2019t fuck up here\u201d and that\u2019s hardly paragraph worthy. 2: As if\nthat was hard, they were at rock bottom at \u201cnever\u201d. 3: And claims credit for\nPeter\u2019s success stop claiming credit for Peter\u2019s success ffs. 4: As the\nAvengers stand at that point. 5: I\u2019ve said it once and I\u2019ll say it again, he\u2019s\nplain incompetent. 6: Spider-Man would be the best hero to use to show the\neffects of the Accords, since he\u2019d be screwed over without prep or lube by\nthem, but Marvel didn\u2019t intend to take that anywhere, which shows even in Civil\nWar, since most of the movie and for most of the characters it isn\u2019t about them\nanyway. 7: And he won\u2019t be able to prove them wrong.]</p><p><br/></p><hr><h2><br/></h2><h2>AID: COMPROMISED / DISTANCE: FAIL</h2><p>So, you thought I\u2019d be nice to the\nrelationship/T/ony St/ark. </p><p>As I said before, T/ony provides a lot of aid.\nHe takes care that the suit \u201csuits\u201d Peter<sup>1</sup>: it has the lenses to\nprevent overwhelming his senses, the new webshooters, it fits his acrobatic\nlifestyle better<sup>2</sup>, it has tracers he can use knowingly and\napparently some other functions which activate automatically in case of\nemergency if Peter can\u2019t do it himself.<sup>3</sup></p><p>Furthermore, it has some kind of devise to warn\nhim if Peter\u2019s in some trouble the suit can detect (although it does depend on\nInternet connection) and, when he gets that warning, T/ony wastes no time to\nget a suit to save him, just as he goes running when he figures out Peter\u2019s on\nthe ferry, where he knows a deal\u2019s about to go through. Then, he offers Peter a\nhome at the facility, a place on the Avengers, the Iron Spider suit and a\nfather figure in himself.<sup>4</sup></p><p>All in all, when Peter\u2019s on T/ony\u2019s good\ngraces, he holds the world upon a string.<sup>5</sup> He\u2019s provided with aid in\nspades. When it comes to actions of aid, I can\u2019t complain at all. The only\ntimes when he didn\u2019t come to Peter\u2019s rescue in the movie were when it would\nmake sense because he wasn\u2019t keeping tabs anymore and the movie actually\nrequired his absence. It\u2019s the material aid that, perhaps unfairly, I\u2019ll admit,\nI\u2019m not happy with. The problem is that he doesn\u2019t manage well the distance I\ntalked about in the introduction.</p><p>In every other way, he\u2019s too distant. This\ndistance means that his attempts at material aid backfire, because he\u2019s not\nthere to ensure the correct use of the equipment. Therefore, Peter first\nendangers himself by using the suit\u2019s extra abilities because he doesn\u2019t\nunderstand them and later uses them to go against T/ony\u2019s wishes. In addition\nto give Peter this space to reject him, his distance also causes it by breeding\nresentment or/and disconnect on Peter\u2019s side. </p><p>On the other hand, the moments and ways in\nwhich he\u2019s present he\u2019s overbearing. Physically and emotionally, he goes from\nignoring Peter to taking the opportunity of saving him to set down rules that\ngo against what Peter believes in and which, because of that, will be difficult\nto follow since the trouble he\u2019s supposed to avoid is happening right before\nhis eyes. Then he calls before the ferry incident, sets himself up as Peter\u2019s\nfather figure (by referencing his own father and saying he\u2019ll succeed where he\nfailed) and is about to tell Peter that he\u2019s going to start training him. Note\nthat I say \u201ctell that\u201d and not some other, more unassertive words like\n\u201csuggest\u201d or \u201coffer\u201d. It\u2019s for a reason. In the call, T/ony constantly wrestles\nfor control of the conversation, and from Peter. Without a by-your leave, he\ndecides he\u2019s going to try to parent Peter. That\u2019s the basis of all their\ninteractions, T/ony trying to move Peter to where he wants him, Peter resisting\nand T/ony dragging him or leaning on him to make him comply, with oftentimes\npoor results. </p><p>Other way in which he\u2019s not giving room for\nPeter to be himself is by giving him the suit as it was. Remember when I\nmentioned that I\u2019d use the comics to support my claims? Here it is. Putting\naside the fact that Peter himself made the suit (the movie is apparently based\non Ultimate Spider-Man<sup>6</sup>, and they already changed it so it would be\nMary Jane who made him the suit instead there), a good example for what I\u2019m\nsaying is the spider-tracers. The original, 616 Peter Parker very early on made\nthe spider tracers, simple spider-shaped devices that allowed him to track\npeople, first with a receiver and later he programs them so he can find them\nwith his spider-sense.<sup>7</sup> You might remember a spider-like tracer in\nthe movie. T/ony gave it to him and both it and the \u201creceiver\u201d are a hundred\ntimes more advanced than the ones Peter uses in the comics. Thus, he has no\nreason to keep working on it and will probably never figure out how to tap into\nhis spider-sense\u2019s frequency. The webshooters come with hundreds of different\ncombinations programmed into them, so he has no reason to tinker with them. He\nhas no reason to develop his skills at all because it\u2019s all been handed to him.\nAnd it\u2019s not like Peter wants to be a poet; he has both talent and interest in\nscience but no reason to work on it. T/ony himself commented that his work was\nimpressive. He said Peter in general, his skills, his powers, his morals, was\ngreat, but then the first thing he did was limit him and then try to shape him\ninto something that fit him better, like someone who\u2019d ignore trouble, someone\nwho he saw as eventually going to want to use an Instant Kill Mode. </p><p>I\u2019ve talked about the how, but here\u2019s why the\nmentorship fails. T/ony is, at once, too distant and too overbearing.</p><p>He sees potential in Peter and so he invests in\nhim with the suit, and takes measures to protect that investment by putting\neverything he thinks will help him survive in it. This means he has a very set\npath he wants Peter to follow and to that end put bumpers on the sides. Peter\ncould get rid of them and do his own thing, but they make life easier and so he\ndoesn\u2019t even need to learn how to aim because he has the bumpers to fall back\non. The moment Peter decides to try it anyway, T/ony shows no hesitation in\ncutting him loose and taking his investment back, though. And why wouldn\u2019t he,\nif T/ony doesn\u2019t tell him the rules of the game and won\u2019t even play with him?</p><p>No, I don\u2019t think T/ony does it on purpose. I\nthink he does care about Peter. But if he\u2019s a dad, he\u2019s one of those rich ones\nwho don\u2019t make time for their kids and try to make up for it by buying them\nexpensive gifts that they may or may not want and justify it by saying they\u2019re\njust making sure they have a good future, even though their kids don\u2019t want to\nwork on their law firm. </p><p>[1: As I said before, it\u2019s weird, and by weird\nI mean eye-rollingly-convenient, just how well T/ony could predict the needs of\nsomeone he hadn\u2019t even met. 2: Toight. 3: Which is useful since Peter doesn\u2019t\nknow about them. 4: Don\u2019t get up in my face, I never said T/ony didn\u2019t care\nabout Peter or might be open to a father/son relationship with him, only that\nhe sucks at it. 5: I\u2019ve already talked about what happens when he isn\u2019t, but\nmentioning that in the main body is just being petty at this point. 6: In ways\nthey wouldn\u2019t like to admit. 7: Some people take a page out of Bruce Wayne\u2019s\nbook a prefix part of their name to everything to cope and that\u2019s valid.]</p><hr><h2><br/></h2><h2>CONCLUSION</h2><p>If the father/son relationship between Peter\nand T/ony doesn\u2019t exist. The scriptwriters used certain cues that are widely\nassociated with parents reacting to their kids or blatantly compared T/ony to\nhis father in how he acted towards Peter, implying he was filling the same\nrole. Their interactions, though, are minimal and most plain conflictive, while\nalmost all had problematic undertones and context, even when the characters had\nthe best intentions. T/ony fails to communicate with Peter and so he fails him\nin almost every aspect, and by the time he gets his act together, Peter, while\nstill admiring him and wanting his attention and to be an Avenger, has rejected\nhis authority both because he doesn\u2019t trust it and because accepting it would\nmean going against his own beliefs and wishes. Since Peter meets with failure, T/ony\ncan\u2019t tolerate the challenge and doesn\u2019t see any reason to compromise and so cuts\nPeter off, claiming that it will be permanent. After Peter succeeds, T/ony\nwelcomes him back without any of them addressing the issues that had set them\napart before and tries to impose his way again by giving him everything he\nwanted, but Peter rejects him. They go their own ways, understanding that Peter\nwill be his own person, and with this understanding also setting the groundwork\nfor a better, functional relationship. </p><p>Fans, as it is their right, created a very\ndifferent relationship following the cues and the emotional manipulation used\nin the movie. Marvel profits from it without having had to actually put effort\ninto the relationship. </p><p>It should be pointed out that any mentorship\nrelationship involving a teenage hero will always be problematic since the\nmentor will be complicit at best and completely to blame at most for child\nendangerment. Marvel realized this 60 years ago and, if my memory serves, until\nmodern times no teenage hero has had a mentor or operated in a team, with\nteam-ups being the exception, since Johnny Storm (and the rest of the FF\nfamily). This trend was started \n\nand popularized\n\nby <i>Spider-Man</i>.\u00a0</p>",

This last\none is especially important to make sure all these other things are being done\nadequately (it would be useless to try to teach a 5<sup>th</sup> grader math\ngenius how to add, unfair to tell them that they can\u2019t sleep over at a friend\u2019s\nhouse because you\u2019re afraid they\u2019ll get home sick and want to go home when\nthey\u2019ve been doing it for a while now) and to give the mentee a sense of\nreliability, since a relationship has to be maintained by two people, and a\nmentee that doesn\u2019t trust their mentor won\u2019t let them perform their duties. </p><p>Most importantly, though, the mentor has to give\nall of this to the mentee as tools to use for themselves, understanding that\neventually they should outgrow the need for mentoring. (Which doesn\u2019t mean\noutgrowing the need/desire for the relationship itself. More in the sense of graduating\nand going from a friendly relationship with a teacher to becoming actual\nfriends who respect each other as equals and aren\u2019t part of an imbalanced\nrelationship the way that of a mentor/mentee is.) This requires a very exact\ndistance which allows the mentor to carry out their duties and receive feedback\nwhile still letting the mentee be their own person and grow on their own.</p><p>T/ony fails to provide everything but aid. I\nconsidered including fair feedback, but even that misses the \u201cfair\u201d part.</p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>SENSE OF RELIABILITY: FAIL</h2><p>T/ony doesn\u2019t communicate with Peter, leading\nhim to think he can\u2019t rely on him.</p><p>There are ways to refute this statement, such\nas pointing out the suit, which T/ony made to protect Peter and into which he\nseemed to have put a lot of effort, or that he was listening to Peter\u2019s messages,\nsince he was able to mention the churro lady. I\u2019ll address this later on. Right\nnow, I\u2019ll only say that what\u2019s important isn\u2019t being reliable<sup>1</sup>, but\ngiving Peter a sense of reliability, which he failed to do, and so he disobeyed\nhim at every turn. We can assume that Peter stopped giving Happy updates, so he\nstopped putting effort in the relationship, and when T/ony went to confront him\nwhen he messed up, Peter refused to acknowledge any kind of authority on his\npart except right of ownership of the suit. It could be said that this was\nbecause Peter was trying to prove himself worthy of becoming an Avenger and it\nwas just childish rebellion and, while I wouldn\u2019t disagree, I\u2019d say that, be\nthat as it may, Peter still rejected and circumvented T/ony\u2019s authority. He was\nconvinced he was wrong and tried to prove it by doing things on his own.<sup>2</sup></p><p>[1: Which T/ony wasn\u2019t, anyway. 2: As he\u2019d been\ndoing all along.]</p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>TRAINING: FAIL</h2><p>T/ony doesn\u2019t train Peter. He doesn\u2019t meet\nPeter until he\u2019s had his powers for 6 months, probably has been Spider-Man for\naround 5, and has established himself as a \u201ccool\u201d (enough to have more than one\nvideo on YouTube<sup>1</sup>) vigilante, if not a hero in his own right. He\ngoes to Germany and holds his own against both Sam and Bucky, even with all his\nfanboying<sup>2</sup>. He saved Rhodey from crashing into a plane. He was\nessential in beating Scott.<sup> 3 4</sup></p><p>By the time CA:CW rolls around, ability wise, Peter\nhas a handle on things<sup>5</sup> that, while not perfect, can improve only\nwith experience, which also goes for his ability to assess and react to a\nsituation accordingly, and seems to have a grip on the direction of his career\n(go on patrol, help the \u201clittle guy\u201d). He could handle himself in his chosen\npath and was no push-over when taken out of his element. Which is a good thing,\nsince the only \u201ctraining\u201d he gave him, besides indoctrination to keep him from\nlistening to Cap, was \u201caim for the legs\u201d.</p><p>In Homecoming, for most of the movie Peter uses\nthe St/ark suit. The only two features we see him use are: the new webshooters\nand the tracing chip (the one he uses himself). We can assume that, as far as\nPeter knows until his first fight with the Vulture, that\u2019s all it does. Then, T/ony\ntells him that he put everything into his suit. Peter doesn\u2019t really look into\nit, even after he finds out there\u2019s a tracer in his suit. He hacks into it to\ntake the tracer out and Ned tells him about the training wheels. More on some\nof this stuff later. What\u2019s important now is that Peter wasn\u2019t trained in how\nto use the suit. He wasn\u2019t even told he was supposed to be trained. He didn\u2019t\nknow about the suit\u2019s capabilities and, until he takes a moment to see for\nhimself how it works, i.e. train himself, again, it actually hinders him.</p><p>[1: I mean, to be fair, the first video,\nbecause of the way it\u2019s framed (static and with Peter swinging right in front\nof it) and how convenient it is that someone was just recording a hijacking\nPeter was there to stop, was probably made by Peter himself. 2: Fun fact, Word\ntried to change fanboying into annoying. Tea. 3: This is meant as a comment on\nhis ability, not the other Avengers, but, since Scott couldn\u2019t break the\nwebbing on his legs, he also probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to break it if he\nwas wrapped upon it completely, so, hypothetically, Peter could have tied him\nup and delivered the last punch himself. 4: What a pity he lost not only most\nof his skill but also his commons sense and smarts by Homecoming. I mean, he\ndoes know he\u2019s in New York, right? Why was his best idea to get the bike back\nto its owner to leave it in the middle of the sidewalk? 5: (this one will make\nme sound At least biased, at most, obsessed) of the powers Feige saw fit to let\nhim keep, which amount to strength and his Spider-sense limited by contrivances\n(show that he has it and make him cooler in a fight, but drop it when it could\ncome useful, like with the drone). Just to give you an idea: in the comics,\nPeter is fast enough that people often say that he can\u2019t be human. The Green\nGoblin says that he\u2019s impressed by his agility. Unless it doesn\u2019t fit the plot,\nhis Spidey- sense lets him fight people in the dark. All these combined allow\nhim to dodge bullets. Apply this knowledge to his fight scenes. Also apply his\nstickiness and the fact that he\u2019s super strong while Cap\u2019s supposed to be at\nhuman peak, as in, he\u2019s the best any human can be, but still human, to his\nfight with Cap. Would Cap still have beaten him? Of effing course, but the\nfight would have been more about strategy than outright punches. Not completely\nthough, his punches would still have been effective. I mean, kinda. I can\nactually see the fight happening as it did (except when Cap pulls Peter to him)\nin the comics, even with Peter not being wet around the ears as he is in CA:CW.\nI guess I mostly wanted to comment on his powers. Also, he has a super-human\nsense of balance, so him wobbling on the hero landing was shit.]</p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>SUPPORT: FAIL</h2><p>T/ony and Peter talk all of six times during\nthe movie, and that\u2019s being extremely generous, since I\u2019m counting the ferry\ncall, the ferry save, and the post ferry scene as three different occasions.\nI\u2019ll talk about each of them in other sections of the post, but at no point\ndoes T/ony ever provide emotional support to Peter. Him apparently\nreading/listening to his messages but not replying is him not providing\nemotional support. Actually\u2026</p><p>Here it gets <i>heavily</i> T/ony critical. In the post-ferry scene, however you want\nto frame it, went horribly. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong. Peter deserved a lecture. More.\nHe, if you\u2019ll forgive the parlance in the \u201cobjective\u201d part of the post, fucked\nup. I\u2019m not saying he didn\u2019t. However, the way T/ony went about it was so wrong\nhe provided the exact opposite of emotional support and drove him to tears\nhours after the fact AND to stop being Spider-Man. I know there will be those\nthat will say, \u201cHey, that\u2019s good, right? I mean, first you complain about him\ncondoning his vigilantism and then you complain about him ending it? Make up\nyour mind.\u201d There\u2019s a difference between making a minor understand that they\nshouldn\u2019t do some things for their own safety and making them feel like\nscrew-ups who are nothing without a piece of clothing. </p><p>Because here\u2019s how the scene went. Peter\nscrewed the pooch. T/ony informs him of this. Gives him a bit of a\ntongue-lashing. Peter asks if everyone\u2019s okay. T/ony says no thanks to him. Not\nhow I would have worded it, but I have both the disadvantage of closeness,\nbecause I know what Peter was thinking and I empathize with him because of that<sup>1</sup>,\nand the advantage of distance, because I haven\u2019t landed on a roof after having\nto save all those people in the ferry along with the kid whose life I feel\nresponsible for, after he disobeyed my orders. Peter gives voice to my thoughts:\nhe was trying to protect people<sup>2</sup>, you know, his job. He points out\nthat he had tried to tell T/ony, that he had asked for his help/him to play\ninterference before, but he blew him off.<sup>3</sup> He says that if T/ony\ncared, he\u2019d be there.<sup>4</sup></p><p>Then<sup>5</sup>, T/ony steps out of the suit.\nHe tells him that he\u2019d called the FBI. The FBI would have been \u2013<i>was</i>\u2014useless against the Vulture. Even if\nthey weren\u2019t, Peter didn\u2019t know that, because the only thing T/ony told him was\nthat the weapons dealing was too small for the Avengers<sup>6</sup>, but too\nbig for Peter and to call Happy if he saw them again. Happy, who had been\nignoring Peter like he was a street vendor. And if he knew enough about their\ncommunications to know about the churro lady, he had to know Happy was ignoring\nhim. Actually, I want to quote him. \u201cTake him down now, huh? Crockett,\nthere are people who handle this son of thing.\u201d He told Spider-Man to ignore\nhis responsibilities. </p><p>T/ony, there\u2019s no other way\nto say this, guilt-trips him by saying he was the only one who believed in him<sup>7</sup>.\nHe says he got criticized for choosing to have faith in a 14yo. The only good\nreason to say that would have been to make Peter feel like he was in his debt. Then,\nafter making the, ultimately, but only partially<sup>8</sup>, true assertion\nthat if anyone had died that night it would have been on Peter (I want you to\ntake a second to consider the callousness of telling a 15yo that; change the\nphrasing from \u201con you\u201d to \u201cit\u2019s your fault\u201d), he tells Peter that if he had\ndied, he\u2019d have felt responsible and that he doesn\u2019t need that<sup>9</sup>. He\u2019s\nmaking someone who already feels bad feel worse. That\u2019s not the point of\nlectures. The point of lectures is making someone understand what they did\nwrong, why what they did was wrong, how to avoid it in the future and, maybe,\nhow to fix it. Admittedly<sup>10</sup>, T/ony does that, but he completely\ntears Peter down in the process. I\u2019m not saying that he should be allowed to\nget away scott free, either by T/ony or by the narrative, but that\u2019s not the\nway to do it, because of many reasons, but mainly because Peter gets the wrong\nlesson. This is, first, because T/ony insists on making everything about\nhimself. He blames everything that happened on Peter disobeying him; when Peter\npoints out the way he failed, he makes an argument that, yes, saves him from\nlooking like a complete ass, but fails to address the underlying root of the\nproblem which is that Peter was reacting to the information he had available,\nwhich included absolutely nothing from him except (the illusion of) disregard;\nhe makes himself the victim of the danger <i>Peter</i>\ngets into. </p><p>The last part draws into\nthe second thing Peter got wrong about the lecture, which is that he\u2019s a\nscrew-up. He now not only feels guilty about his own failure, the whole blame\nfor the accident has been laid on him<sup>11</sup>. Then, the coup de gr\u00e2ce.</p><p>T/ony asks for the suit\nback. (This is not it). Peter begs him not to, and then claims he\u2019s nothing\nwithout the suit<sup>12</sup>.</p><p>And T/ony answers that, if\nhe\u2019s nothing without the suit, then he shouldn\u2019t have it<sup>13</sup>.</p><p>And then he takes the suit.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>Put it this way. Peter says\nA. T/ony answers \u201cIf A, then B\u201d (A=&gt;B)<sup>14</sup>. Then T/ony says B.</p><p>I know it\u2019s not what he\nmeant. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what Feige, or Goldstein and Daley intended. Believe\nme, I do. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that T/ony indirectly tells Peter he\u2019s\nnothing, and Peter thinks he\u2019s nothing, and the movie supports this by making\nthe emotional climax of the movie about Peter proving he\u2019s not nothing.</p><p>That is not emotional\nsupport. If it was done often enough, you could make a case for it being\nemotional abuse, especially since it was done at a time when Peter, a child who\nadmires T/ony and so is very impressionable where he\u2019s concerned, was already\nfeeling guilty, so that T/ony\u2019s words reinforce the thought that he\u2019s nothing.\nAnd all of this is in the context of T/ony ignoring Peter for two months,\nappearing to ignore his worries, going back to ignoring him until he messes up,\nmaking the point of the following lecture that everything wrong that had\nhappened on the ferry happened because Peter didn\u2019t obey T/ony\u2019s orders and\nthen, the next time they speak, framing all of that and telling Peter,\nessentially, that he\u2019s nothing, as a \u201cthe tough-love moment that he needed.\u201d</p><p>I believe that the only\nreason a lot of people (I haven\u2019t even seen anyone in the anti-T/ony crowd\npoint this out) let this slide is because the moment follows T/ony\u2019s oh-so-convenient\ncall to Peter and instantly followed itself by his \u201cNow I sound like my father\u201d\nline, where he sets himself up in a fatherly role. This way, when people think\nof the scene, they think it a fatherly lecture without seeming to remember the\nnothing line<sup>15</sup>, or they think it the indispensable set up for the\nwarehouse scene<sup>16</sup>.</p><p>[1: And because he\u2019s the\nprotagonist, and my favorite. 2: I mean, sure, becoming an Avenger was also a\nbig part of his motivations, but the point is that going after supervillians is\nthe heroic thing to do. 3: Throwing in a nice \u201cthis is all your fault\u201d, for\ngood measure. 4: He, but I actually mean the scriptwriters, makes it seem like\nhis whole argument was based on T/ony not caring and Peter being hurt and angry\nand lashing out because of that and not because he had any actual reason for\ngoing to the ferry, since they only address the matter of T/ony caring/listening/being\nthere (at that moment at least, which is supposed to mean/make us think he was\nalways there), and not the consequences of him not showing it. 5: \u2026we start\ngetting emotionally manipulated. 6: With Rhodey disabled, doesn\u2019t that just\nmean T/ony and Vision at this point? 7: First, shitty. Second, as other people\nhave pointed out, he\u2019s, by T/ony\u2019s accounts, which, to respect Peter\u2019s wishes\nand privacy, he should have only given maybe to Pepper and Vision, 14. Maybe\nwhen they asked \u201care you insane?\u201d they were questioning your morals, not your\nsanity. Third, the scene where Happy says he told T/ony that he was a good kid\nmight make this a lie, if that wasn\u2019t Happy trying to take credit. Personally,\nI think the latter, I\u2019ve always thought so. 8: It\u2019s important to me that people\nunderstand that it wasn\u2019t Peter with the gun and, since the FBI was already\nthere ready to bust the deal, the fight would have happened anyway but with\nmore casualties. I mean, they probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to give them\nenough trouble that the ferry would be broken in two, but if T/ony hadn\u2019t\ncalled when he did, he wouldn\u2019t have gone to help. 9: Stop playing the victim.\nAlso, stop making every single one of Peter\u2019s actions about you, now we have\nhis literal death scene made to be all about you. This goes to the stans, too.\nStop making all of Peter\u2019s life about T/ony, Marvel\u2019s already busy at that. 10:\nI disagree with the truthfulness (as in veracity, not sincerity) of what he\u2019s\nsaying, he is explaining all the wh\u2019s. 11: He is to blame for a lot of it. I\nmean, technically, if he hadn\u2019t stopped all his other deals, he might not have\ntried the one in the ferry. Of course that\u2019s nitpicking, because we can\u2019t be\nsure and, as a hero, it\u2019s his job to stop villains and, as Spider-Man, it\u2019s his\n(self-appointed) job to stop crime in general. Then again, let\u2019s not forget,\nyou know, the criminal and the guy who could have given him the information\nthat might have made him decide to stay out of it. 12: The fact that he\u2019d been\nSpider-Man without it for long enough aside\u2026 13: Instead of, you know, telling\nhim it wasn\u2019t true. Actually, a night has gone since I wrote the 12 to mark\nthat I wanted to comment and the moment of writing this, so I don\u2019t remember\nwhat I wanted to say. 14: They give it a relationship of cause-effect, and it\u2019s\nnot the same as B=&gt;A, but for the effect they have on both Peter and the\nmovie, it might as well be an equivalence. 15: Unless they want to make a\nparallel between him and T/ony both being told they\u2019re nothing without the\nsuits (and proving that\u2019s false) because \u201cthey\u2019re so alike! Look at this dad\nand his son!!\u201d without taking a moment to remember who exactly told Peter he\nwas nothing without the suit. 16: I\u2026 don\u2019t understand how this line in that\ncontext can be seen as motivational. The only way it works, even if barely, is\nif we go with the theory that Peter thinks he\u2019s nothing without the suit and T/ony\nagrees with him and he\u2019s lifting the warehouse out of spite. I mean, if he\u2019d\nhis own words (\u201cI\u2019m nothing without this suit\u201d), it could be seen as a moment\nof growth, of telling himself, \u201cI\u2019m still Peter, and I\u2019m still Spider-Man\u201d, but\nhe remembers T/ony\u2019s. His exact words are \u201cIf you\u2019re nothing without this [St/ark]\nsuit, then you shouldn\u2019t have it.\u201d Let\u2019s take a moment and see how Peter\u2019s\nthoughts might have carried him there without spite. If he was thinking of T/ony:\n\u201cI can\u2019t do this on my own, I wish there was someone here to help me. I wish my\npersonal hero, I/ron Man, was here. \u2018If\u2026\u2019 He took the suit away, so I\u2019m\nnothing. I don\u2019t even have a way to contact him.\u201d Without a \u201cwow, what a dick,\nI\u2019m gonna prove him wrong\u201d thrown in there, I can\u2019t see a way for that to lead\nto any inspiration to lift the warehouse. If he was thinking of the suit: \u201cGod,\nI\u2019m trapped down here, I\u2019ve tried to lift this off, but I couldn\u2019t, and to top\nit off all I have is this useless suit, not even a phone, or an AI to comfort\nme the way the other one did. \u2018If\u2026\u2019 So, I can\u2019t lift these walls off me, which\nonly goes to show what T/ony already knew when he took the suit away: I\u2019m\nnothing without it. I lost.\u201d If he was thinking about himself being nothing: \u201cI\ncouldn\u2019t lift these walls, I really am nothing without that suit. \u2018If\u2026\u2019 Yeah,\nMr. St/ark, you were right to take it away.\u201d I mean, let\u2019s forget for a second\nthat the other suit probably wouldn\u2019t have helped him then. There\u2019s no relation\nbetween his current situation and the line except the suit and the theme of\nself-worth, and the line supports the lack of both. What I\u2019m trying to say here\nis that I can\u2019t see any way for that line to not only fit the situation, but to\nlead Peter to gain the strength (of will) to lift the walls. I mean, I could\nsee Peter 616 saving himself out of spite, maybe, but in that context that line\nis like a sore.]</p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>A CLEAR SET OF RULES:\nINCOMPLETE</h2><p>T/ony first gives Peter an\nextremely vague spectrum of which actions are acceptable and which aren\u2019t, and\nlater on gives Peter and order that, in the way it was presented, was anathema\nto what he believes, without explaining his reasoning. The rules, in T/ony\u2019s\nmind, seem to be there, but the only clear direction he gives Peter is to stay\naway from the weapons dealing.</p><p>In the car ride to Peter\u2019s\nhome, T/ony tells Peter, \u201cdon\u2019t do anything I would do, and don\u2019t do anything I\nwouldn\u2019t do.\u201d While the audience might find that joke funny, Peter would only\nknow T/ony from what he\u2019s seen on the media, and that with parental guidance,\nsince he was eight at the most tumultuous, speaking from a PR perspective, part\nof T/ony\u2019s life. While some of us might hear that line and go, \u201cthat\u2019s the best\nadvice you could give a child\u201d, and we are the target of that line, Peter\ndoesn\u2019t know T/ony. He only knows him as I/ron Man and, maybe, as a genius\nengineer. Those directions are worthless to him further than the implied \u201cuse\nyour common sense.\u201d Just so we\u2019re clear, I\u2019m not saying T/ony doesn\u2019t have that<sup>1</sup>,\njust that he\u2019s telling Peter to react in an appropriate manner to the situation\nwithout direction as to what an appropriate reaction would be.</p><p>Then comes Peter\u2019s first fight with the\nVulture, T/ony\u2019s second talk with Peter in the movie, and he tells him to stay\nout of it. He doesn\u2019t say he\u2019ll look into it, he doesn\u2019t tell him to go to the\nauthorities. He tells him not to look into the weapons dealing and, if he does\ncome across it again, to call Happy. Like I said before, if T/ony was\nreading/listening to Peter\u2019s messages, he probably had access to his and\nHappy\u2019s communications, so he knew Happy was lowing Peter off. Maybe he thought\nthat was alright because <i>he</i> was\ngetting the messages and he\u2019d know if there was trouble, but Peter didn\u2019t know\nthat. As I mentioned before, Peter doesn\u2019t feel like T/ony\u2019s reliable, so he\ndidn\u2019t trust T/ony had his best interests at heart or at least he didn\u2019t think\nhe knew what those were.</p><p>Furthermore, when he tried to argue against the\nrule, T/ony broke out the \u201cBecause I said so!\u201d Which is the fallacy of appeal\nto authority. A lot of parents use it, which is why a lot of fans love the\nexchange and, I\u2019ll bet, why the scriptwriters included it, but it\u2019s worthless\nas a logical argument and sure to make most teenagers hurry to do the exact\nopposite of what you said, nevermind a teenager who already thinks you\u2019re\nwrong, that you\u2019ve failed him and sees you as an obstacle to his goals, even as\nhe sees you as the path to them.</p><p>However, I feel like I have to point out that,\nat least, T/ony doesn\u2019t create the rules thinking about himself, but about\nPeter. He was honestly trying to protect him.<sup>2</sup> I think he should get\ncredit for that.</p><p>[1: Although I certainly think so. 2: He\u2019s just\ninept.]</p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>RESPECT: FAIL</h2><p>T/ony consistently looks down on Peter. To be\nfair, most of the times he does this he\u2019s trying to make a joke, but his humor\nis, not only with Peter but with most people, condescending and disrespectful.</p><p>In CA:CW, while he compliments him on his\npowers and inventions, he does it as a power move. Maybe not intentionally, but\ncornering a teenager in his own room and one by one throwing all of his most\ndangerous secrets right in his face like you do it every Tuesday, even as the\nteenager in question gets progressively more agitated, only served to build\nhimself up and put Peter in the spot. Personally, I don\u2019t think that when T/ony\nmentions May he\u2019s implying he\u2019ll tell her about Spider-Man, but there\u2019s no\ndoubt that Peter is feeling like Damocles\u2019 sword was giving him a very close\nshave. He was at a disadvantage, even if T/ony wouldn\u2019t press, even Peter\ndidn\u2019t think T/ony would press.</p><p>From Peter\u2019s video, we know that he didn\u2019t see\nor talk with T/ony at least until they gathered at the airport. T/ony told him\nwhat to do, gave him a tip on how to do it, convinced him not to listen to what\nCap said<sup>1</sup> and sent him off. No explanation given, he gave\ninformation on a need to know basis and didn\u2019t think Peter even needed to know\nthe real reason why they were fighting.</p><p>In the middle of all that, though, I missed a\nstep. He gave Peter the suit. At that particular moment, all that suit had\ngoing for itself were the new webshooters (they may look nicer, but we are\ngiven no reason to believe they are, with the training wheels protocol in\nplace, any better than the original), the (maybe) improved lenses and being\nmore stylish<sup>1</sup>. Meta textually, all it served was to give Spider-Man\nhis suit<sup>2</sup>. In the movie, all the purpose it could have served was,\nif we\u2019re being generous, T/ony wanting Peter to have something nice<sup>3 </sup>or\nnot wanting to be seen badly for bringing someone in rags and, if we\u2019re not, T/ony\npaying for a service.<sup>4</sup></p><p>In the car ride, he makes the joke about May.<sup>5</sup>\nA woman isn\u2019t relevant only in relation to the men in her life and a man is\nsupposed to understand that he doesn\u2019t control the women in his life and that\nthey are not a comment on himself. That said, T/ony was locker room talking\nPeter\u2019s mom. He not only passed him off to Happy, he told him that someone, not\nhim, would call him if they needed him. That was the last Peter heard of him\nfor two months. </p><p>Then comes the fight with the Vulture. That\u2019s\nthe first time Peter hears anything about his suit having a parachute, a tracer\nor a heater. After explaining the whole story to T/ony, he says they can take\nthe Vulture down and T/ony replies with \u201ctaking him down now, huh? Crocket,\nthere are people who handle this sort of things.\u201d He condescendingly tells\nPeter that he\u2019ll be out of the case and when Peter asks if he\u2019ll be the one\nwho\u2019ll handle it, he says it\u2019s too unimportant. That\u2019s when he reveals he isn\u2019t\nthere with Peter but seemingly on vacation in India. From this point on, Peter\nstops trusting T/ony cares about him personally. The \u201cBecause I said so!\u201d line\nmakes an obligatory appearance in this section, because he hasn\u2019t given Peter a\ngood reason not to go after the Vulture. We can guess from his outburst that\nhe\u2019s worried about him, but Peter can only hear his words and they\u2019re telling\nnot to do his job because he says so, and then he goes on to belittle his\nefforts in CW. He has plenty of reasons to believe T/ony sees him as nothing\nbut the kid he picked up and unfortunately got stuck to his hand. He goes on to\ntell Peter to stay with the small stuff and be \u201cfriendly neighborhood\nSpider-Man\u201d.<sup>6</sup></p><p>He bribes him with easy entrance to MIT<sup>7</sup>\nand leaves instead of using that convenient moment to bring up the other things\nthe suit can do, since he won\u2019t be accessing to it until he\u2019s completed the\ntraining T/ony was apparently supposed to give him, and he hasn\u2019t even started\nyet, so it\u2019s not important, right?</p><p>Except Peter accesses to it and, if he wasn\u2019t\nannoyed by T/ony by then, the \u201cTraining Wheels\u201d and the \u201cBaby Monitor\u201d protocol\nwould have finished the job. The first one, admittedly, isn\u2019t that bad in its\nname and not bad at all in its purpose, but it existed in the context of all\nthe other ways T/ony made Peter feel inadequate and like a kid. The Baby\nMonitor, on the other hand, was downright patronizing in its name and a breach\nof privacy that outdid the tracer in the suit.</p><p>Then, out of nowhere, T/ony calls him to\ncongratulate him (pointing out Peter\u2019s lie and ignoring the fact he clearly\ndoesn\u2019t want to talk to him, but then again, he probably programmed the AI to\nconnect his calls directly, so he never much cared about that) and inserts\nhimself in the role of a father to this kid he\u2019s talked to four times (this is\na manipulation from Marvel). At every point he disregards Peter\u2019s wishes, going\nso far as to tell him not to cut him off when Peter says he\u2019s in the middle of\nsomething. That call wasn\u2019t about Peter, it was about himself. </p><p>The mission goes sideways until T/ony gets\nthere and saves everyone. I\u2019m hesitant to include the \u201cI think you\u2019ve done\nenough\u201d line since Peter did mess up and its delivery wasn\u2019t condescending so\nmuch as angry. </p><p>During their talk post-ferry, the talk is\npeppered with \u201cstereotypical parental lecture\u201d catchphrases, which is what fans\nwant to see, I assume, is why no one bothers to notice how inappropriate it is\nfor someone whose interactions with a kid can\u2019t amount to more than a day all\nput together to insert himself as a father figure in his life and then start\nwith methods such as constantly making reference to his authority as an adult\ninstead of making actual arguments. \u201cI\u2019m fifteen\u201d may not have been the most\ndevastating of all smackdowns, but \u201cThis is where you zip it! The adults are\ntalking\u201d is an immediate and absolute shut down of communication, because, even\nif the other person rebels against it and keeps talking, the \u201cadult\u201d already\nexpressed unwillingness to listen. And I\u2019ve talked about how he puts Peter in\nhis debt with his comment about others thinking he was crazy for recruiting a\n\u201c14\u201d year old (see how the age gap and so his superiority just grows), but here\nhe also makes it as though Peter was at fault for that for being young, while\nalso telling him how no one else believes in him, while <i>also</i> implying he doesn\u2019t believe in him anymore.<sup>8</sup></p><p>Then he takes the suit away. I think that was\nthe right choice. I mean, personally, I don\u2019t see how it was that much better\nthan his own suit beyond looking better and being better for the acrobatics\nhe\u2019s known for<sup>9</sup> until he hacks it, but he\u2019s not supposed to access\nto all the suit\u2019s capabilities anyway (again, something I agree with). It\u2019s\njust a toy, but one that enabled him to go against T/ony\u2019s orders and taking it\naway is the best way to punish him (if it was apart from the \u201cnothing\u201d issue)\nand keep him from repeating is actions. There\u2019s not much to criticize about his\nchoice to take the suit away \u00a0(again,\nexcept for the conversation which gave that choice context) except maybe that,\nbecause that suit was the only thing that tied the two of them together, taking\nit away was basically giving up on the relationship, but I\u2019ve already explained\nthat the relationship was based on Peter admiring T/ony and what he\nrepresented, reaching out and lashing out when he perceived rejection and T/ony\nignoring Peter, so it\u2019s not much of a loss. There\u2019s especially nothing to\ncriticize in regards of T/ony disrespecting Peter.</p><p>Nothing, that is, except the clothes. It isn\u2019t\nonly humiliating and, if the writers had a bit of common sense, a sign for May\nthat something bad happened<sup>10</sup>, it\u2019s also petty and vindictive in a\nway that casts a bad light on the good parts of his lecture, which are already\nfew, because they don\u2019t seem to come from the right place, one of genuine\nintent to do right by Peter, but out of desire to take out his anger on him.<sup>11</sup></p><p>Their next interaction is when Peter \u201chas\nproven himself to T/ony\u201d and gets invited to the upstate facility. Without the\nslightest hesitation, a thought spared to whether Peter harbored any resentment\nfor the way he was treated (even if T/ony doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s done anything <i>wrong</i>, he has to know, because sometimes\nthat\u2019s what he was going for, that he upset Peter, as all people get upset when\nthey\u2019re lectured and punished), T/ony throws an arm over Peter\u2019s shoulders\nwelcomes him back and takes credit for motivating Peter, even though he went\nagainst T/ony\u2019s wishes, after a talk in which he was torn down for not doing as\nhe said. He paid so little mind to Peter himself that he planned the rest of\nhis life in advance for him, starting<sup>12</sup> right then, as soon as he\nsuited up, with dozens of reporters waiting to drill the fifteen year old whose\nonly exposure to attention greater than that of his class when he answered a\nteacher\u2019s question was at AcaDec. Then Peter rejects him and he lets him go,\nafter a quick \u201clook at me (I\u2019m the best thing that could ever happen to you).\nStill no? Okay, I\u2019ll take this in a dignified way since you\u2019re so adorable. I\nmean, look at it! It\u2019s so smart, it\u2019s almost like it understands what you\u2019re\nsaying!\u201d That may seem like I\u2019m being mean-spirited, but with the billionaire\nsaying he digs the \u201cworking-class hero vibe\u201d?<sup>13</sup> It\u2019s not. </p><p>I repeat, most of T/ony\u2019s moments of\ncondescendence are either jokes or T/ony\u2019s/RDJ\u2019s way of carrying himself that\nmight make mostly innocuous comments offensive or probably his way of lashing\nout when he\u2019s angry or upset. It\u2019s not planned or out of maliciousness, just\nthoughtlessness. If it wasn\u2019t, he probably would have told Peter that it wasn\u2019t\na test when he asked<sup>14</sup>, to manipulate him, maybe guilt him into\nagreeing. That doesn\u2019t change their effect.</p><p>[1: Afraid he\u2019ll agree? 2: Stop making every\nclassic Spider-Man thing about T/ony. 3: How convenient that T/ony knew exactly\neverything that Peter needed and put it in the suit even before meeting and\ntalking to him or that he had time to add it while planning for the fight,\nbefore he got to his hotel room. 3: This explains why he\u2019s so comfortable just\ndropping him then picking him up whenever it suits him, and also it makes sense\nas an investment. Pay your workers well and reap the benefits of their\nwellbeing and the skills they develop while/by working for you. 5: Why do I\nhave to go through this with everyone but Peter? I\u2019d say every man, but I\nwouldn0t know, since May only appears on screen to show what a cool mom she is\nto his nephew and to be slobbered over by men, they deleted the one scene where\nshe could have been shown as her own person and as someone who raised the boy\nwho\u2019d become Spider-Man because hey <i>why\nwould I bother showing that when I could point out how hot Aunt May who\u2019s\ninitially characterized by being ill and a bit doddering but <b>who pushes through that and her grief over\nthe loss of her husband(s) with her immense strength of will and inspired by\nher caring for her boy just as he pushes through the grief of life with his\nimmense strength of will probably learned from her and inspired by his caring\nfor his mom/aunt/and uncle/dad.</b></i> 6: Stahhhhp. 7: Let him go to ESU, you\ncowards. (I literally just remembered T/ony went to MIT. First, wow, another\nparallel, much surprised. Second, a good chance to set him apart from T/ony and\nlet him be his own person, as many fans who disagree with Peter having a mentor\nbut like their relationship have say is probably what\u2019s going to happen. Third,\nyou\u2019re taking ESU disaster student Peter Parker from my cold, dead hands and\ntrigger the curse of the mummy so I\u2019ll come back to life, take it back and beat\nyou on the head with it. 8: The more I think about that scene the hotter my\nblood boils. 9: Except in the MCU because who cares about anything but\nstrength? Oh, yeah, and sticky fingers. 10: Her teenager disappeared from school\nat a point in his life where he\u2019s making a lot of bad decisions all of a sudden\nand he comes back home in tears and thrown together clothes? Listen, I\u2019m not\nfrom New York, I don\u2019t know exactly how bad crime is over there, but that\u2019s\nsure to raise a red alert in anyone, right? 11: I didn\u2019t recognize that shirt\nas Pepper\u2019s when I watched the movie, and I don\u2019t think we were meant to. I\nthink we were just supposed to think he went ahead and bought the most\nembarrassing outfit he could find, so I\u2019m not including that in the main body.\n12: with a nice fuck you to May, but I\u2019m used to the scriptwriters\u2019 attitude\ntowards her by now. 13: To Spider-Man, who, even though they didn\u2019t bother to\nestablish the Parkers as struggling with money (beyond Peter dumpster diving)\nand, really, given the times and May\u2019s youth still wouldn\u2019t lead to Peter\nworking as a teenager and having a lot of his problems/anxieties revolving\naround money, is still a character who\u2019s characterized by <i>a lot of his problems/anxieties revolving around money</i>? 14: Also,\nnice way of destroying the only development you gave to the character that\ndidn\u2019t require you to get rid of the other things you\u2019ve established in the\nprevious movie. He wants to look after the little guy? Now he just wants to be an\nAvenger. He was clever, made his own computers and equipment and came up with\nplans/strategized? Now he lacks common sense and he\u2019s only smart academically\nand because people say so. He was able to go toe-to-toe with Avengers? Now he\u2019s\njust plain incompetent and can\u2019t even swing. He cared enough about school that\nhe wouldn\u2019t just eff off to Germany, even if T/ony St/ark asked? Now he\u2019s just\nwaiting for the call and ready to drop out and move upstate. And then when he\u2019s\nfinally getting his priorities straight, he ruins it and asks if it was a test.\nDo you just throw shit at a wall and hope it sticks or did you actually plan to\ngive him character development but got scared that something would go wrong and\nplayed it down?]</p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>FAIR FEEDBACK: INCOMPLETE</h2><p>On my count, T/ony shows Peter a reaction to\nhis actions five times. Of those, two of them are exaggerated and one is\ncomplicated, as I will explain shortly.</p><p>The first two, will be analyzed together due to\ntheir similarity<sup>1</sup>, are in CA:CW, in the bedroom scene, and in the\ncar scene in Homecoming. Although, as I\u2019ve explained, there are problems with\nthe context of that praise, it\u2019s honest and an appropriate response when you\nthink someone\u2019s skilled. A simple \u201cthis is good work\u201d, just like in the car\nscene. That time, he\u2019s technically talking to May about Peter\u2019s (fictitious)\nwork at the retreat, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stretch to say it\u2019s meant for\nPeter.</p><p>The third feedback moment, the complicated one,\nis the phone call right before the ferry accident. I say it\u2019s complicated\nbecause, in the context of everything else we\u2019ve seen before in the movie, that\nwas out of character and mostly for plot convenience. Despite that, what we get\nto hear shows it would have been \u201cfair feedback\u201d, at least given what T/ony\nknows, and possibly a turning point for their relationship that might have led\nto a good mentorship, if it hadn\u2019t come at that particular moment. He calls\nafter hearing about him saving his friends at Washington and mentions \u201cgreat\nthings to come, which we can assume means the training which would have led to\nmore frequent<sup>2</sup> interaction and communication which would probably\nhave solved most of the problems I\u2019ve pointed out. However, from an objective\npoint of view, that feedback wasn\u2019t fair, since the Washington incident was\nPeter\u2019s fault. He was the one who brought the Chitauri energy core and left it\nwith his non-powered friend after just picking it off the streets and\nirresponsibly not telling the police or anyone who could deal with it better\nthan him (except T/ony) and carrying it around on him. Those actions deserved\npunishment. He also used it to disobey T/ony\u2019s orders and investigate the\nVulture\u2019s operations. If he had had this information, T/ony most likely\nwouldn\u2019t have congratulated him. Peter, by not giving him all the information,\nprevented him from performing his duties as a mentor correctly, but this\nhappened because T/ony failed to provide him with a sense of reliability and\nalienating him by not respecting him. This leaves us, for the purposes of this\nsection, with a situation in which T/ony doesn\u2019t actually give Peter fair\nfeedback, but it isn\u2019t completely his fault.</p><p>The fourth time is the post-ferry lecture. In\nthis case, he was right to choose to punish Peter, but wrong in the delivery of\nthat punishment. I\u2019ve explained everything that bothers me about this scene: T/ony\nis condescending in how he says things; his chastisement is based around Peter\nnot listening to him instead of the things he actually did wrong and led to him\nendangering people, among which are being too eager to please him and his whole\ninvolvement with the Chitauri energy core, which didn\u2019t actually affect the\noutcome of the ferry accident; his whole lecture does more harm than good.\nThen, by taking away the suit, he ends the relationship with Peter. That\u2019s his\nreaction to, to his knowledge, Peter\u2019s first strike. Instead of trying to fix\nthings, he just discards him. Maybe he planned to give it back, but that would\nmake the threat intentionally manipulative, which would be even worse.</p><p>The fifth time is at the upstate facility\nwhere, after Peter did everything he told him not to, again, which he punished\nhim for before, he praises him<sup>3</sup> and offers to make him an Avenger<sup>4</sup>.\nPeter does what he was punished for doing before, which includes endangering people\nthe same way he did at the ferry (he showed up to fight crime, things went\nsideways and he tried to fix it. The only difference is that he needed help in\nthe ferry while both the plane and the beach were miraculously empty), only he\nsucceeds this time, and T/ony\u2019s reaction is to give him everything he wants.\nI\u2019m not saying Peter doesn\u2019t deserve reward, I\u2019m saying that T/ony\u2019s is over\nthe top, not only because he doesn\u2019t deserve it, but also because it would end\nup being bad for him. The Avengers are the Big Leagues and he\u2019s not ready for\nit.<sup>5</sup> Even if they took the time to train him, he\u2019d have to upend his\nlife as Peter Parker, even if he didn\u2019t reveal his identity.<sup>6</sup> He\u2019d\nhave to drop out, and tell his Aunt at the very least, since her life would be\nupended, too. He\u2019s not getting what he thinks he\u2019s buying since the Avengers at\nthat point are not the idealized elite who saved him and all the world when he\nwas eight, but just T/ony, Vision and a disabled and probably still recovering\nRhodey, who are bound by the Accords and now completely beholden to the UN. If\nyou\u2019re doing Peter Parker right, he\u2019ll never agree to only acting when he\u2019s\nallowed, or doing something he thinks is wrong. They got this right in the\nmovie by making him go against T/ony even though he\u2019s his hero. If it\u2019s true\nthat T/ony told people that he recruited a teenager and they were judgmental,\nhe\u2019ll be exposed to that skepticism.<sup>7</sup> He\u2019ll be (immediately) exposed\nto the media\u2019s scrutiny as the new Avenger, and the one that came after Civil\nWar. </p><p>What I\u2019m trying to say with all this is that\nonce again T/ony\u2019s reaction is over-the-top and inappropriate. He also gives\nPeter the wrong message: succeed and I\u2019ll give you the world; fail and I\u2019ll\ntake it away. There is also the small uncomfortable matter that, while this may\nnot have held weight in his decision, Peter\u2019s success was closely tied with\ndoing T/ony a favor by saving his plane. It wasn\u2019t the point, but it goes to\nshow that constantly trying to make everything about T/ony has its downsides.</p><p>[1:and because all I have to say about each of\nthem is \u201cyou didn\u2019t fuck up here\u201d and that\u2019s hardly paragraph worthy. 2: As if\nthat was hard, they were at rock bottom at \u201cnever\u201d. 3: And claims credit for\nPeter\u2019s success stop claiming credit for Peter\u2019s success ffs. 4: As the\nAvengers stand at that point. 5: I\u2019ve said it once and I\u2019ll say it again, he\u2019s\nplain incompetent. 6: Spider-Man would be the best hero to use to show the\neffects of the Accords, since he\u2019d be screwed over without prep or lube by\nthem, but Marvel didn\u2019t intend to take that anywhere, which shows even in Civil\nWar, since most of the movie and for most of the characters it isn\u2019t about them\nanyway. 7: And he won\u2019t be able to prove them wrong.]</p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>AID: COMPROMISED / DISTANCE: FAIL</h2><p>So, you thought I\u2019d be nice to the\nrelationship/T/ony St/ark. </p><p>As I said before, T/ony provides a lot of aid.\nHe takes care that the suit \u201csuits\u201d Peter<sup>1</sup>: it has the lenses to\nprevent overwhelming his senses, the new webshooters, it fits his acrobatic\nlifestyle better<sup>2</sup>, it has tracers he can use knowingly and\napparently some other functions which activate automatically in case of\nemergency if Peter can\u2019t do it himself.<sup>3</sup></p><p>Furthermore, it has some kind of devise to warn\nhim if Peter\u2019s in some trouble the suit can detect (although it does depend on\nInternet connection) and, when he gets that warning, T/ony wastes no time to\nget a suit to save him, just as he goes running when he figures out Peter\u2019s on\nthe ferry, where he knows a deal\u2019s about to go through. Then, he offers Peter a\nhome at the facility, a place on the Avengers, the Iron Spider suit and a\nfather figure in himself.<sup>4</sup></p><p>All in all, when Peter\u2019s on T/ony\u2019s good\ngraces, he holds the world upon a string.<sup>5</sup> He\u2019s provided with aid in\nspades. When it comes to actions of aid, I can\u2019t complain at all. The only\ntimes when he didn\u2019t come to Peter\u2019s rescue in the movie were when it would\nmake sense because he wasn\u2019t keeping tabs anymore and the movie actually\nrequired his absence. It\u2019s the material aid that, perhaps unfairly, I\u2019ll admit,\nI\u2019m not happy with. The problem is that he doesn\u2019t manage well the distance I\ntalked about in the introduction.</p><p>In every other way, he\u2019s too distant. This\ndistance means that his attempts at material aid backfire, because he\u2019s not\nthere to ensure the correct use of the equipment. Therefore, Peter first\nendangers himself by using the suit\u2019s extra abilities because he doesn\u2019t\nunderstand them and later uses them to go against T/ony\u2019s wishes. In addition\nto give Peter this space to reject him, his distance also causes it by breeding\nresentment or/and disconnect on Peter\u2019s side. </p><p>On the other hand, the moments and ways in\nwhich he\u2019s present he\u2019s overbearing. Physically and emotionally, he goes from\nignoring Peter to taking the opportunity of saving him to set down rules that\ngo against what Peter believes in and which, because of that, will be difficult\nto follow since the trouble he\u2019s supposed to avoid is happening right before\nhis eyes. Then he calls before the ferry incident, sets himself up as Peter\u2019s\nfather figure (by referencing his own father and saying he\u2019ll succeed where he\nfailed) and is about to tell Peter that he\u2019s going to start training him. Note\nthat I say \u201ctell that\u201d and not some other, more unassertive words like\n\u201csuggest\u201d or \u201coffer\u201d. It\u2019s for a reason. In the call, T/ony constantly wrestles\nfor control of the conversation, and from Peter. Without a by-your leave, he\ndecides he\u2019s going to try to parent Peter. That\u2019s the basis of all their\ninteractions, T/ony trying to move Peter to where he wants him, Peter resisting\nand T/ony dragging him or leaning on him to make him comply, with oftentimes\npoor results. </p><p>Other way in which he\u2019s not giving room for\nPeter to be himself is by giving him the suit as it was. Remember when I\nmentioned that I\u2019d use the comics to support my claims? Here it is. Putting\naside the fact that Peter himself made the suit (the movie is apparently based\non Ultimate Spider-Man<sup>6</sup>, and they already changed it so it would be\nMary Jane who made him the suit instead there), a good example for what I\u2019m\nsaying is the spider-tracers. The original, 616 Peter Parker very early on made\nthe spider tracers, simple spider-shaped devices that allowed him to track\npeople, first with a receiver and later he programs them so he can find them\nwith his spider-sense.<sup>7</sup> You might remember a spider-like tracer in\nthe movie. T/ony gave it to him and both it and the \u201creceiver\u201d are a hundred\ntimes more advanced than the ones Peter uses in the comics. Thus, he has no\nreason to keep working on it and will probably never figure out how to tap into\nhis spider-sense\u2019s frequency. The webshooters come with hundreds of different\ncombinations programmed into them, so he has no reason to tinker with them. He\nhas no reason to develop his skills at all because it\u2019s all been handed to him.\nAnd it\u2019s not like Peter wants to be a poet; he has both talent and interest in\nscience but no reason to work on it. T/ony himself commented that his work was\nimpressive. He said Peter in general, his skills, his powers, his morals, was\ngreat, but then the first thing he did was limit him and then try to shape him\ninto something that fit him better, like someone who\u2019d ignore trouble, someone\nwho he saw as eventually going to want to use an Instant Kill Mode. </p><p>I\u2019ve talked about the how, but here\u2019s why the\nmentorship fails. T/ony is, at once, too distant and too overbearing.</p><p>He sees potential in Peter and so he invests in\nhim with the suit, and takes measures to protect that investment by putting\neverything he thinks will help him survive in it. This means he has a very set\npath he wants Peter to follow and to that end put bumpers on the sides. Peter\ncould get rid of them and do his own thing, but they make life easier and so he\ndoesn\u2019t even need to learn how to aim because he has the bumpers to fall back\non. The moment Peter decides to try it anyway, T/ony shows no hesitation in\ncutting him loose and taking his investment back, though. And why wouldn\u2019t he,\nif T/ony doesn\u2019t tell him the rules of the game and won\u2019t even play with him?</p><p>No, I don\u2019t think T/ony does it on purpose. I\nthink he does care about Peter. But if he\u2019s a dad, he\u2019s one of those rich ones\nwho don\u2019t make time for their kids and try to make up for it by buying them\nexpensive gifts that they may or may not want and justify it by saying they\u2019re\njust making sure they have a good future, even though their kids don\u2019t want to\nwork on their law firm. </p><p>[1: As I said before, it\u2019s weird, and by weird\nI mean eye-rollingly-convenient, just how well T/ony could predict the needs of\nsomeone he hadn\u2019t even met. 2: Toight. 3: Which is useful since Peter doesn\u2019t\nknow about them. 4: Don\u2019t get up in my face, I never said T/ony didn\u2019t care\nabout Peter or might be open to a father/son relationship with him, only that\nhe sucks at it. 5: I\u2019ve already talked about what happens when he isn\u2019t, but\nmentioning that in the main body is just being petty at this point. 6: In ways\nthey wouldn\u2019t like to admit. 7: Some people take a page out of Bruce Wayne\u2019s\nbook a prefix part of their name to everything to cope and that\u2019s valid.]</p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>CONCLUSION</h2><p>If the father/son relationship between Peter\nand T/ony doesn\u2019t exist. The scriptwriters used certain cues that are widely\nassociated with parents reacting to their kids or blatantly compared T/ony to\nhis father in how he acted towards Peter, implying he was filling the same\nrole. Their interactions, though, are minimal and most plain conflictive, while\nalmost all had problematic undertones and context, even when the characters had\nthe best intentions. T/ony fails to communicate with Peter and so he fails him\nin almost every aspect, and by the time he gets his act together, Peter, while\nstill admiring him and wanting his attention and to be an Avenger, has rejected\nhis authority both because he doesn\u2019t trust it and because accepting it would\nmean going against his own beliefs and wishes. Since Peter meets with failure, T/ony\ncan\u2019t tolerate the challenge and doesn\u2019t see any reason to compromise and so cuts\nPeter off, claiming that it will be permanent. After Peter succeeds, T/ony\nwelcomes him back without any of them addressing the issues that had set them\napart before and tries to impose his way again by giving him everything he\nwanted, but Peter rejects him. They go their own ways, understanding that Peter\nwill be his own person, and with this understanding also setting the groundwork\nfor a better, functional relationship. </p><p>Fans, as it is their right, created a very\ndifferent relationship following the cues and the emotional manipulation used\nin the movie. Marvel profits from it without having had to actually put effort\ninto the relationship. </p><p>It should be pointed out that any mentorship\nrelationship involving a teenage hero will always be problematic since the\nmentor will be complicit at best and completely to blame at most for child\nendangerment. Marvel realized this 60 years ago and, if my memory serves, until\nmodern times no teenage hero has had a mentor or operated in a team, with\nteam-ups being the exception, since Johnny Storm (and the rest of the FF\nfamily). This trend was started \n\nand popularized\n\nby <i>Spider-Man</i>.\u00a0</p>",

I used to be a fan of the\ndynamic, because I love both Peter Parker and the \u201cfound family\u201d trope, but\nI\u2019ve given the matter a lot of thought (that\u2019s actually the reason I\u2019m sitting\ndown to write it; I\u2019m hoping to put it in words to put it out of my thoughts)\nand I\u2019m calling them how I see them.<br></p><p>Fair warning: To/ny stans, if they don\u2019t want\nto get upset, shouldn\u2019t read this. It won\u2019t be bashing him, I\u2019ll be trying to\nbe fair, but it will be critical of him. You shouldn\u2019t see this, since I\u2019m\ntagging it accordingly, but maybe a Spider-Man fan who also likes T/ony, is new\nto the fandom and hasn\u2019t blacklisted \u201canti T/ony st/ark\u201d might find it. </p><p>Also, I might be slightly biased because of\nwhat I know from the Spider-Man comics, which I\u2019m in the process of reading\nnow, but of which I knew very little when I first thought of this. I will be\nbringing up those few things that I knew, not because I think that the movie\nshould be absolutely identical to it, but because it\u2019s actually relevant to the\nargument. (Although from what I\u2019ve seen in the comics and what I\u2019ve read from\npeople who know better than me, there is plenty of reason to be offended by the\nmovie and it\u2019s \u201caccuracy\u201d that has nothing to do with gate-keeping nitpicking.)</p><p>Last, I\u2019ll be adding slightly off-topic\nopinions between [these]. I won\u2019t start talking about Black Panther, but they\u2019ll\nbe subjective comments (right or wrong) and won\u2019t have much to do with the\nactual argument. Don\u2019t want to read the, don\u2019t read them; if you disagree, you\ndisagree. It\u2019s your opinion and you can do what you want just like this is my\npost and I do what I want, but, like I said, the actual argument will be\nseparate from them, so it should be read accordingly. (No saying my argument is\nwrong because I prefer Seven Up over Sprite.) </p><p>Now, to the actual thing.</p>[[MORE]]<p>An ideal mentor should provide the mentee with:\ntraining (in whatever form this training takes, i.e. it counts if it\u2019s just\nadvice on life), support (the emotional kind), aid (more substantial support;\nequipment and actions fall into this category), a clear set of rules, respect\n(not that of an equal in the field the mentorship\u2019s taking place, but at least\nthat of a person to another, enough to see the mentee for what they are), fair feedback\n(appropriate encouragement when they do something right, appropriate punishment\nwhen they do something wrong), frequent if not constant assessment. This last\none is especially important to make sure all these other things are being done\nadequately (it would be useless to try to teach a 5<sup>th</sup> grader math\ngenius how to add, unfair to tell them that they can\u2019t sleep over at a friend\u2019s\nhouse because you\u2019re afraid they\u2019ll get home sick and want to go home when\nthey\u2019ve been doing it for a while now) and to give the mentee a sense of\nreliability, since a relationship has to be maintained by two people, and a\nmentee that doesn\u2019t trust their mentor won\u2019t let them perform their duties. </p><p>Most importantly, though, the mentor has to give\nall of this to the mentee as tools to use for themselves, understanding that\neventually they should outgrow the need for mentoring. (Which doesn\u2019t mean\noutgrowing the need/desire for the relationship itself. More in the sense of graduating\nand going from a friendly relationship with a teacher to becoming actual\nfriends who respect each other as equals and aren\u2019t part of an imbalanced\nrelationship the way that of a mentor/mentee is.) This requires a very exact\ndistance which allows the mentor to carry out their duties and receive feedback\nwhile still letting the mentee be their own person and grow on their own.</p><p>T/ony fails to provide everything but aid. I\nconsidered including fair feedback, but even that misses the \u201cfair\u201d part.</p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>SENSE OF RELIABILITY: FAIL</h2><p>T/ony doesn\u2019t communicate with Peter, leading\nhim to think he can\u2019t rely on him.</p><p>There are ways to refute this statement, such\nas pointing out the suit, which T/ony made to protect Peter and into which he\nseemed to have put a lot of effort, or that he was listening to Peter\u2019s messages,\nsince he was able to mention the churro lady. I\u2019ll address this later on. Right\nnow, I\u2019ll only say that what\u2019s important isn\u2019t being reliable<sup>1</sup>, but\ngiving Peter a sense of reliability, which he failed to do, and so he disobeyed\nhim at every turn. We can assume that Peter stopped giving Happy updates, so he\nstopped putting effort in the relationship, and when T/ony went to confront him\nwhen he messed up, Peter refused to acknowledge any kind of authority on his\npart except right of ownership of the suit. It could be said that this was\nbecause Peter was trying to prove himself worthy of becoming an Avenger and it\nwas just childish rebellion and, while I wouldn\u2019t disagree, I\u2019d say that, be\nthat as it may, Peter still rejected and circumvented T/ony\u2019s authority. He was\nconvinced he was wrong and tried to prove it by doing things on his own.<sup>2</sup></p><p>[1: Which T/ony wasn\u2019t, anyway. 2: As he\u2019d been\ndoing all along.]</p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>TRAINING: FAIL</h2><p>T/ony doesn\u2019t train Peter. He doesn\u2019t meet\nPeter until he\u2019s had his powers for 6 months, probably has been Spider-Man for\naround 5, and has established himself as a \u201ccool\u201d (enough to have more than one\nvideo on YouTube<sup>1</sup>) vigilante, if not a hero in his own right. He\ngoes to Germany and holds his own against both Sam and Bucky, even with all his\nfanboying<sup>2</sup>. He saved Rhodey from crashing into a plane. He was\nessential in beating Scott.<sup> 3 4</sup></p><p>By the time CA:CW rolls around, ability wise, Peter\nhas a handle on things<sup>5</sup> that, while not perfect, can improve only\nwith experience, which also goes for his ability to assess and react to a\nsituation accordingly, and seems to have a grip on the direction of his career\n(go on patrol, help the \u201clittle guy\u201d). He could handle himself in his chosen\npath and was no push-over when taken out of his element. Which is a good thing,\nsince the only \u201ctraining\u201d he gave him, besides indoctrination to keep him from\nlistening to Cap, was \u201caim for the legs\u201d.</p><p>In Homecoming, for most of the movie Peter uses\nthe St/ark suit. The only two features we see him use are: the new webshooters\nand the tracing chip (the one he uses himself). We can assume that, as far as\nPeter knows until his first fight with the Vulture, that\u2019s all it does. Then, T/ony\ntells him that he put everything into his suit. Peter doesn\u2019t really look into\nit, even after he finds out there\u2019s a tracer in his suit. He hacks into it to\ntake the tracer out and Ned tells him about the training wheels. More on some\nof this stuff later. What\u2019s important now is that Peter wasn\u2019t trained in how\nto use the suit. He wasn\u2019t even told he was supposed to be trained. He didn\u2019t\nknow about the suit\u2019s capabilities and, until he takes a moment to see for\nhimself how it works, i.e. train himself, again, it actually hinders him.</p><p>[1: I mean, to be fair, the first video,\nbecause of the way it\u2019s framed (static and with Peter swinging right in front\nof it) and how convenient it is that someone was just recording a hijacking\nPeter was there to stop, was probably made by Peter himself. 2: Fun fact, Word\ntried to change fanboying into annoying. Tea. 3: This is meant as a comment on\nhis ability, not the other Avengers, but, since Scott couldn\u2019t break the\nwebbing on his legs, he also probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to break it if he\nwas wrapped upon it completely, so, hypothetically, Peter could have tied him\nup and delivered the last punch himself. 4: What a pity he lost not only most\nof his skill but also his commons sense and smarts by Homecoming. I mean, he\ndoes know he\u2019s in New York, right? Why was his best idea to get the bike back\nto its owner to leave it in the middle of the sidewalk? 5: (this one will make\nme sound At least biased, at most, obsessed) of the powers Feige saw fit to let\nhim keep, which amount to strength and his Spider-sense limited by contrivances\n(show that he has it and make him cooler in a fight, but drop it when it could\ncome useful, like with the drone). Just to give you an idea: in the comics,\nPeter is fast enough that people often say that he can\u2019t be human. The Green\nGoblin says that he\u2019s impressed by his agility. Unless it doesn\u2019t fit the plot,\nhis Spidey- sense lets him fight people in the dark. All these combined allow\nhim to dodge bullets. Apply this knowledge to his fight scenes. Also apply his\nstickiness and the fact that he\u2019s super strong while Cap\u2019s supposed to be at\nhuman peak, as in, he\u2019s the best any human can be, but still human, to his\nfight with Cap. Would Cap still have beaten him? Of effing course, but the\nfight would have been more about strategy than outright punches. Not completely\nthough, his punches would still have been effective. I mean, kinda. I can\nactually see the fight happening as it did (except when Cap pulls Peter to him)\nin the comics, even with Peter not being wet around the ears as he is in CA:CW.\nI guess I mostly wanted to comment on his powers. Also, he has a super-human\nsense of balance, so him wobbling on the hero landing was shit.]</p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>SUPPORT: FAIL</h2><p>T/ony and Peter talk all of six times during\nthe movie, and that\u2019s being extremely generous, since I\u2019m counting the ferry\ncall, the ferry save, and the post ferry scene as three different occasions.\nI\u2019ll talk about each of them in other sections of the post, but at no point\ndoes T/ony ever provide emotional support to Peter. Him apparently\nreading/listening to his messages but not replying is him not providing\nemotional support. Actually\u2026</p><p>Here it gets <i>heavily</i> T/ony critical. In the post-ferry scene, however you want\nto frame it, went horribly. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong. Peter deserved a lecture. More.\nHe, if you\u2019ll forgive the parlance in the \u201cobjective\u201d part of the post, fucked\nup. I\u2019m not saying he didn\u2019t. However, the way T/ony went about it was so wrong\nhe provided the exact opposite of emotional support and drove him to tears\nhours after the fact AND to stop being Spider-Man. I know there will be those\nthat will say, \u201cHey, that\u2019s good, right? I mean, first you complain about him\ncondoning his vigilantism and then you complain about him ending it? Make up\nyour mind.\u201d There\u2019s a difference between making a minor understand that they\nshouldn\u2019t do some things for their own safety and making them feel like\nscrew-ups who are nothing without a piece of clothing. </p><p>Because here\u2019s how the scene went. Peter\nscrewed the pooch. T/ony informs him of this. Gives him a bit of a\ntongue-lashing. Peter asks if everyone\u2019s okay. T/ony says no thanks to him. Not\nhow I would have worded it, but I have both the disadvantage of closeness,\nbecause I know what Peter was thinking and I empathize with him because of that<sup>1</sup>,\nand the advantage of distance, because I haven\u2019t landed on a roof after having\nto save all those people in the ferry along with the kid whose life I feel\nresponsible for, after he disobeyed my orders. Peter gives voice to my thoughts:\nhe was trying to protect people<sup>2</sup>, you know, his job. He points out\nthat he had tried to tell T/ony, that he had asked for his help/him to play\ninterference before, but he blew him off.<sup>3</sup> He says that if T/ony\ncared, he\u2019d be there.<sup>4</sup></p><p>Then<sup>5</sup>, T/ony steps out of the suit.\nHe tells him that he\u2019d called the FBI. The FBI would have been \u2013<i>was</i>\u2014useless against the Vulture. Even if\nthey weren\u2019t, Peter didn\u2019t know that, because the only thing T/ony told him was\nthat the weapons dealing was too small for the Avengers<sup>6</sup>, but too\nbig for Peter and to call Happy if he saw them again. Happy, who had been\nignoring Peter like he was a street vendor. And if he knew enough about their\ncommunications to know about the churro lady, he had to know Happy was ignoring\nhim. Actually, I want to quote him. \u201cTake him down now, huh? Crockett,\nthere are people who handle this son of thing.\u201d He told Spider-Man to ignore\nhis responsibilities. </p><p>T/ony, there\u2019s no other way\nto say this, guilt-trips him by saying he was the only one who believed in him<sup>7</sup>.\nHe says he got criticized for choosing to have faith in a 14yo. The only good\nreason to say that would have been to make Peter feel like he was in his debt. Then,\nafter making the, ultimately, but only partially<sup>8</sup>, true assertion\nthat if anyone had died that night it would have been on Peter (I want you to\ntake a second to consider the callousness of telling a 15yo that; change the\nphrasing from \u201con you\u201d to \u201cit\u2019s your fault\u201d), he tells Peter that if he had\ndied, he\u2019d have felt responsible and that he doesn\u2019t need that<sup>9</sup>. He\u2019s\nmaking someone who already feels bad feel worse. That\u2019s not the point of\nlectures. The point of lectures is making someone understand what they did\nwrong, why what they did was wrong, how to avoid it in the future and, maybe,\nhow to fix it. Admittedly<sup>10</sup>, T/ony does that, but he completely\ntears Peter down in the process. I\u2019m not saying that he should be allowed to\nget away scott free, either by T/ony or by the narrative, but that\u2019s not the\nway to do it, because of many reasons, but mainly because Peter gets the wrong\nlesson. This is, first, because T/ony insists on making everything about\nhimself. He blames everything that happened on Peter disobeying him; when Peter\npoints out the way he failed, he makes an argument that, yes, saves him from\nlooking like a complete ass, but fails to address the underlying root of the\nproblem which is that Peter was reacting to the information he had available,\nwhich included absolutely nothing from him except (the illusion of) disregard;\nhe makes himself the victim of the danger <i>Peter</i>\ngets into. </p><p>The last part draws into\nthe second thing Peter got wrong about the lecture, which is that he\u2019s a\nscrew-up. He now not only feels guilty about his own failure, the whole blame\nfor the accident has been laid on him<sup>11</sup>. Then, the coup de gr\u00e2ce.</p><p>T/ony asks for the suit\nback. (This is not it). Peter begs him not to, and then claims he\u2019s nothing\nwithout the suit<sup>12</sup>.</p><p>And T/ony answers that, if\nhe\u2019s nothing without the suit, then he shouldn\u2019t have it<sup>13</sup>.</p><p>And then he takes the suit.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>Put it this way. Peter says\nA. T/ony answers \u201cIf A, then B\u201d (A=&gt;B)<sup>14</sup>. Then T/ony says B.</p><p>I know it\u2019s not what he\nmeant. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what Feige, or Goldstein and Daley intended. Believe\nme, I do. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that T/ony indirectly tells Peter he\u2019s\nnothing, and Peter thinks he\u2019s nothing, and the movie supports this by making\nthe emotional climax of the movie about Peter proving he\u2019s not nothing.</p><p>That is not emotional\nsupport. If it was done often enough, you could make a case for it being\nemotional abuse, especially since it was done at a time when Peter, a child who\nadmires T/ony and so is very impressionable where he\u2019s concerned, was already\nfeeling guilty, so that T/ony\u2019s words reinforce the thought that he\u2019s nothing.\nAnd all of this is in the context of T/ony ignoring Peter for two months,\nappearing to ignore his worries, going back to ignoring him until he messes up,\nmaking the point of the following lecture that everything wrong that had\nhappened on the ferry happened because Peter didn\u2019t obey T/ony\u2019s orders and\nthen, the next time they speak, framing all of that and telling Peter,\nessentially, that he\u2019s nothing, as a \u201cthe tough-love moment that he needed.\u201d</p><p>I believe that the only\nreason a lot of people (I haven\u2019t even seen anyone in the anti-T/ony crowd\npoint this out) let this slide is because the moment follows T/ony\u2019s oh-so-convenient\ncall to Peter and instantly followed itself by his \u201cNow I sound like my father\u201d\nline, where he sets himself up in a fatherly role. This way, when people think\nof the scene, they think it a fatherly lecture without seeming to remember the\nnothing line<sup>15</sup>, or they think it the indispensable set up for the\nwarehouse scene<sup>16</sup>.</p><p>[1: And because he\u2019s the\nprotagonist, and my favorite. 2: I mean, sure, becoming an Avenger was also a\nbig part of his motivations, but the point is that going after supervillians is\nthe heroic thing to do. 3: Throwing in a nice \u201cthis is all your fault\u201d, for\ngood measure. 4: He, but I actually mean the scriptwriters, makes it seem like\nhis whole argument was based on T/ony not caring and Peter being hurt and angry\nand lashing out because of that and not because he had any actual reason for\ngoing to the ferry, since they only address the matter of T/ony caring/listening/being\nthere (at that moment at least, which is supposed to mean/make us think he was\nalways there), and not the consequences of him not showing it. 5: \u2026we start\ngetting emotionally manipulated. 6: With Rhodey disabled, doesn\u2019t that just\nmean T/ony and Vision at this point? 7: First, shitty. Second, as other people\nhave pointed out, he\u2019s, by T/ony\u2019s accounts, which, to respect Peter\u2019s wishes\nand privacy, he should have only given maybe to Pepper and Vision, 14. Maybe\nwhen they asked \u201care you insane?\u201d they were questioning your morals, not your\nsanity. Third, the scene where Happy says he told T/ony that he was a good kid\nmight make this a lie, if that wasn\u2019t Happy trying to take credit. Personally,\nI think the latter, I\u2019ve always thought so. 8: It\u2019s important to me that people\nunderstand that it wasn\u2019t Peter with the gun and, since the FBI was already\nthere ready to bust the deal, the fight would have happened anyway but with\nmore casualties. I mean, they probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to give them\nenough trouble that the ferry would be broken in two, but if T/ony hadn\u2019t\ncalled when he did, he wouldn\u2019t have gone to help. 9: Stop playing the victim.\nAlso, stop making every single one of Peter\u2019s actions about you, now we have\nhis literal death scene made to be all about you. This goes to the stans, too.\nStop making all of Peter\u2019s life about T/ony, Marvel\u2019s already busy at that. 10:\nI disagree with the truthfulness (as in veracity, not sincerity) of what he\u2019s\nsaying, he is explaining all the wh\u2019s. 11: He is to blame for a lot of it. I\nmean, technically, if he hadn\u2019t stopped all his other deals, he might not have\ntried the one in the ferry. Of course that\u2019s nitpicking, because we can\u2019t be\nsure and, as a hero, it\u2019s his job to stop villains and, as Spider-Man, it\u2019s his\n(self-appointed) job to stop crime in general. Then again, let\u2019s not forget,\nyou know, the criminal and the guy who could have given him the information\nthat might have made him decide to stay out of it. 12: The fact that he\u2019d been\nSpider-Man without it for long enough aside\u2026 13: Instead of, you know, telling\nhim it wasn\u2019t true. Actually, a night has gone since I wrote the 12 to mark\nthat I wanted to comment and the moment of writing this, so I don\u2019t remember\nwhat I wanted to say. 14: They give it a relationship of cause-effect, and it\u2019s\nnot the same as B=&gt;A, but for the effect they have on both Peter and the\nmovie, it might as well be an equivalence. 15: Unless they want to make a\nparallel between him and T/ony both being told they\u2019re nothing without the\nsuits (and proving that\u2019s false) because \u201cthey\u2019re so alike! Look at this dad\nand his son!!\u201d without taking a moment to remember who exactly told Peter he\nwas nothing without the suit. 16: I\u2026 don\u2019t understand how this line in that\ncontext can be seen as motivational. The only way it works, even if barely, is\nif we go with the theory that Peter thinks he\u2019s nothing without the suit and T/ony\nagrees with him and he\u2019s lifting the warehouse out of spite. I mean, if he\u2019d\nhis own words (\u201cI\u2019m nothing without this suit\u201d), it could be seen as a moment\nof growth, of telling himself, \u201cI\u2019m still Peter, and I\u2019m still Spider-Man\u201d, but\nhe remembers T/ony\u2019s. His exact words are \u201cIf you\u2019re nothing without this [St/ark]\nsuit, then you shouldn\u2019t have it.\u201d Let\u2019s take a moment and see how Peter\u2019s\nthoughts might have carried him there without spite. If he was thinking of T/ony:\n\u201cI can\u2019t do this on my own, I wish there was someone here to help me. I wish my\npersonal hero, I/ron Man, was here. \u2018If\u2026\u2019 He took the suit away, so I\u2019m\nnothing. I don\u2019t even have a way to contact him.\u201d Without a \u201cwow, what a dick,\nI\u2019m gonna prove him wrong\u201d thrown in there, I can\u2019t see a way for that to lead\nto any inspiration to lift the warehouse. If he was thinking of the suit: \u201cGod,\nI\u2019m trapped down here, I\u2019ve tried to lift this off, but I couldn\u2019t, and to top\nit off all I have is this useless suit, not even a phone, or an AI to comfort\nme the way the other one did. \u2018If\u2026\u2019 So, I can\u2019t lift these walls off me, which\nonly goes to show what T/ony already knew when he took the suit away: I\u2019m\nnothing without it. I lost.\u201d If he was thinking about himself being nothing: \u201cI\ncouldn\u2019t lift these walls, I really am nothing without that suit. \u2018If\u2026\u2019 Yeah,\nMr. St/ark, you were right to take it away.\u201d I mean, let\u2019s forget for a second\nthat the other suit probably wouldn\u2019t have helped him then. There\u2019s no relation\nbetween his current situation and the line except the suit and the theme of\nself-worth, and the line supports the lack of both. What I\u2019m trying to say here\nis that I can\u2019t see any way for that line to not only fit the situation, but to\nlead Peter to gain the strength (of will) to lift the walls. I mean, I could\nsee Peter 616 saving himself out of spite, maybe, but in that context that line\nis like a sore.]</p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>A CLEAR SET OF RULES:\nINCOMPLETE</h2><p>T/ony first gives Peter an\nextremely vague spectrum of which actions are acceptable and which aren\u2019t, and\nlater on gives Peter and order that, in the way it was presented, was anathema\nto what he believes, without explaining his reasoning. The rules, in T/ony\u2019s\nmind, seem to be there, but the only clear direction he gives Peter is to stay\naway from the weapons dealing.</p><p>In the car ride to Peter\u2019s\nhome, T/ony tells Peter, \u201cdon\u2019t do anything I would do, and don\u2019t do anything I\nwouldn\u2019t do.\u201d While the audience might find that joke funny, Peter would only\nknow T/ony from what he\u2019s seen on the media, and that with parental guidance,\nsince he was eight at the most tumultuous, speaking from a PR perspective, part\nof T/ony\u2019s life. While some of us might hear that line and go, \u201cthat\u2019s the best\nadvice you could give a child\u201d, and we are the target of that line, Peter\ndoesn\u2019t know T/ony. He only knows him as I/ron Man and, maybe, as a genius\nengineer. Those directions are worthless to him further than the implied \u201cuse\nyour common sense.\u201d Just so we\u2019re clear, I\u2019m not saying T/ony doesn\u2019t have that<sup>1</sup>,\njust that he\u2019s telling Peter to react in an appropriate manner to the situation\nwithout direction as to what an appropriate reaction would be.</p><p>Then comes Peter\u2019s first fight with the\nVulture, T/ony\u2019s second talk with Peter in the movie, and he tells him to stay\nout of it. He doesn\u2019t say he\u2019ll look into it, he doesn\u2019t tell him to go to the\nauthorities. He tells him not to look into the weapons dealing and, if he does\ncome across it again, to call Happy. Like I said before, if T/ony was\nreading/listening to Peter\u2019s messages, he probably had access to his and\nHappy\u2019s communications, so he knew Happy was lowing Peter off. Maybe he thought\nthat was alright because <i>he</i> was\ngetting the messages and he\u2019d know if there was trouble, but Peter didn\u2019t know\nthat. As I mentioned before, Peter doesn\u2019t feel like T/ony\u2019s reliable, so he\ndidn\u2019t trust T/ony had his best interests at heart or at least he didn\u2019t think\nhe knew what those were.</p><p>Furthermore, when he tried to argue against the\nrule, T/ony broke out the \u201cBecause I said so!\u201d Which is the fallacy of appeal\nto authority. A lot of parents use it, which is why a lot of fans love the\nexchange and, I\u2019ll bet, why the scriptwriters included it, but it\u2019s worthless\nas a logical argument and sure to make most teenagers hurry to do the exact\nopposite of what you said, nevermind a teenager who already thinks you\u2019re\nwrong, that you\u2019ve failed him and sees you as an obstacle to his goals, even as\nhe sees you as the path to them.</p><p>However, I feel like I have to point out that,\nat least, T/ony doesn\u2019t create the rules thinking about himself, but about\nPeter. He was honestly trying to protect him.<sup>2</sup> I think he should get\ncredit for that.</p><p>[1: Although I certainly think so. 2: He\u2019s just\ninept.]</p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>RESPECT: FAIL</h2><p>T/ony consistently looks down on Peter. To be\nfair, most of the times he does this he\u2019s trying to make a joke, but his humor\nis, not only with Peter but with most people, condescending and disrespectful.</p><p>In CA:CW, while he compliments him on his\npowers and inventions, he does it as a power move. Maybe not intentionally, but\ncornering a teenager in his own room and one by one throwing all of his most\ndangerous secrets right in his face like you do it every Tuesday, even as the\nteenager in question gets progressively more agitated, only served to build\nhimself up and put Peter in the spot. Personally, I don\u2019t think that when T/ony\nmentions May he\u2019s implying he\u2019ll tell her about Spider-Man, but there\u2019s no\ndoubt that Peter is feeling like Damocles\u2019 sword was giving him a very close\nshave. He was at a disadvantage, even if T/ony wouldn\u2019t press, even Peter\ndidn\u2019t think T/ony would press.</p><p>From Peter\u2019s video, we know that he didn\u2019t see\nor talk with T/ony at least until they gathered at the airport. T/ony told him\nwhat to do, gave him a tip on how to do it, convinced him not to listen to what\nCap said<sup>1</sup> and sent him off. No explanation given, he gave\ninformation on a need to know basis and didn\u2019t think Peter even needed to know\nthe real reason why they were fighting.</p><p>In the middle of all that, though, I missed a\nstep. He gave Peter the suit. At that particular moment, all that suit had\ngoing for itself were the new webshooters (they may look nicer, but we are\ngiven no reason to believe they are, with the training wheels protocol in\nplace, any better than the original), the (maybe) improved lenses and being\nmore stylish<sup>1</sup>. Meta textually, all it served was to give Spider-Man\nhis suit<sup>2</sup>. In the movie, all the purpose it could have served was,\nif we\u2019re being generous, T/ony wanting Peter to have something nice<sup>3 </sup>or\nnot wanting to be seen badly for bringing someone in rags and, if we\u2019re not, T/ony\npaying for a service.<sup>4</sup></p><p>In the car ride, he makes the joke about May.<sup>5</sup>\nA woman isn\u2019t relevant only in relation to the men in her life and a man is\nsupposed to understand that he doesn\u2019t control the women in his life and that\nthey are not a comment on himself. That said, T/ony was locker room talking\nPeter\u2019s mom. He not only passed him off to Happy, he told him that someone, not\nhim, would call him if they needed him. That was the last Peter heard of him\nfor two months. </p><p>Then comes the fight with the Vulture. That\u2019s\nthe first time Peter hears anything about his suit having a parachute, a tracer\nor a heater. After explaining the whole story to T/ony, he says they can take\nthe Vulture down and T/ony replies with \u201ctaking him down now, huh? Crocket,\nthere are people who handle this sort of things.\u201d He condescendingly tells\nPeter that he\u2019ll be out of the case and when Peter asks if he\u2019ll be the one\nwho\u2019ll handle it, he says it\u2019s too unimportant. That\u2019s when he reveals he isn\u2019t\nthere with Peter but seemingly on vacation in India. From this point on, Peter\nstops trusting T/ony cares about him personally. The \u201cBecause I said so!\u201d line\nmakes an obligatory appearance in this section, because he hasn\u2019t given Peter a\ngood reason not to go after the Vulture. We can guess from his outburst that\nhe\u2019s worried about him, but Peter can only hear his words and they\u2019re telling\nnot to do his job because he says so, and then he goes on to belittle his\nefforts in CW. He has plenty of reasons to believe T/ony sees him as nothing\nbut the kid he picked up and unfortunately got stuck to his hand. He goes on to\ntell Peter to stay with the small stuff and be \u201cfriendly neighborhood\nSpider-Man\u201d.<sup>6</sup></p><p>He bribes him with easy entrance to MIT<sup>7</sup>\nand leaves instead of using that convenient moment to bring up the other things\nthe suit can do, since he won\u2019t be accessing to it until he\u2019s completed the\ntraining T/ony was apparently supposed to give him, and he hasn\u2019t even started\nyet, so it\u2019s not important, right?</p><p>Except Peter accesses to it and, if he wasn\u2019t\nannoyed by T/ony by then, the \u201cTraining Wheels\u201d and the \u201cBaby Monitor\u201d protocol\nwould have finished the job. The first one, admittedly, isn\u2019t that bad in its\nname and not bad at all in its purpose, but it existed in the context of all\nthe other ways T/ony made Peter feel inadequate and like a kid. The Baby\nMonitor, on the other hand, was downright patronizing in its name and a breach\nof privacy that outdid the tracer in the suit.</p><p>Then, out of nowhere, T/ony calls him to\ncongratulate him (pointing out Peter\u2019s lie and ignoring the fact he clearly\ndoesn\u2019t want to talk to him, but then again, he probably programmed the AI to\nconnect his calls directly, so he never much cared about that) and inserts\nhimself in the role of a father to this kid he\u2019s talked to four times (this is\na manipulation from Marvel). At every point he disregards Peter\u2019s wishes, going\nso far as to tell him not to cut him off when Peter says he\u2019s in the middle of\nsomething. That call wasn\u2019t about Peter, it was about himself. </p><p>The mission goes sideways until T/ony gets\nthere and saves everyone. I\u2019m hesitant to include the \u201cI think you\u2019ve done\nenough\u201d line since Peter did mess up and its delivery wasn\u2019t condescending so\nmuch as angry. </p><p>During their talk post-ferry, the talk is\npeppered with \u201cstereotypical parental lecture\u201d catchphrases, which is what fans\nwant to see, I assume, is why no one bothers to notice how inappropriate it is\nfor someone whose interactions with a kid can\u2019t amount to more than a day all\nput together to insert himself as a father figure in his life and then start\nwith methods such as constantly making reference to his authority as an adult\ninstead of making actual arguments. \u201cI\u2019m fifteen\u201d may not have been the most\ndevastating of all smackdowns, but \u201cThis is where you zip it! The adults are\ntalking\u201d is an immediate and absolute shut down of communication, because, even\nif the other person rebels against it and keeps talking, the \u201cadult\u201d already\nexpressed unwillingness to listen. And I\u2019ve talked about how he puts Peter in\nhis debt with his comment about others thinking he was crazy for recruiting a\n\u201c14\u201d year old (see how the age gap and so his superiority just grows), but here\nhe also makes it as though Peter was at fault for that for being young, while\nalso telling him how no one else believes in him, while <i>also</i> implying he doesn\u2019t believe in him anymore.<sup>8</sup></p><p>Then he takes the suit away. I think that was\nthe right choice. I mean, personally, I don\u2019t see how it was that much better\nthan his own suit beyond looking better and being better for the acrobatics\nhe\u2019s known for<sup>9</sup> until he hacks it, but he\u2019s not supposed to access\nto all the suit\u2019s capabilities anyway (again, something I agree with). It\u2019s\njust a toy, but one that enabled him to go against T/ony\u2019s orders and taking it\naway is the best way to punish him (if it was apart from the \u201cnothing\u201d issue)\nand keep him from repeating is actions. There\u2019s not much to criticize about his\nchoice to take the suit away \u00a0(again,\nexcept for the conversation which gave that choice context) except maybe that,\nbecause that suit was the only thing that tied the two of them together, taking\nit away was basically giving up on the relationship, but I\u2019ve already explained\nthat the relationship was based on Peter admiring T/ony and what he\nrepresented, reaching out and lashing out when he perceived rejection and T/ony\nignoring Peter, so it\u2019s not much of a loss. There\u2019s especially nothing to\ncriticize in regards of T/ony disrespecting Peter.</p><p>Nothing, that is, except the clothes. It isn\u2019t\nonly humiliating and, if the writers had a bit of common sense, a sign for May\nthat something bad happened<sup>10</sup>, it\u2019s also petty and vindictive in a\nway that casts a bad light on the good parts of his lecture, which are already\nfew, because they don\u2019t seem to come from the right place, one of genuine\nintent to do right by Peter, but out of desire to take out his anger on him.<sup>11</sup></p><p>Their next interaction is when Peter \u201chas\nproven himself to T/ony\u201d and gets invited to the upstate facility. Without the\nslightest hesitation, a thought spared to whether Peter harbored any resentment\nfor the way he was treated (even if T/ony doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s done anything <i>wrong</i>, he has to know, because sometimes\nthat\u2019s what he was going for, that he upset Peter, as all people get upset when\nthey\u2019re lectured and punished), T/ony throws an arm over Peter\u2019s shoulders\nwelcomes him back and takes credit for motivating Peter, even though he went\nagainst T/ony\u2019s wishes, after a talk in which he was torn down for not doing as\nhe said. He paid so little mind to Peter himself that he planned the rest of\nhis life in advance for him, starting<sup>12</sup> right then, as soon as he\nsuited up, with dozens of reporters waiting to drill the fifteen year old whose\nonly exposure to attention greater than that of his class when he answered a\nteacher\u2019s question was at AcaDec. Then Peter rejects him and he lets him go,\nafter a quick \u201clook at me (I\u2019m the best thing that could ever happen to you).\nStill no? Okay, I\u2019ll take this in a dignified way since you\u2019re so adorable. I\nmean, look at it! It\u2019s so smart, it\u2019s almost like it understands what you\u2019re\nsaying!\u201d That may seem like I\u2019m being mean-spirited, but with the billionaire\nsaying he digs the \u201cworking-class hero vibe\u201d?<sup>13</sup> It\u2019s not. </p><p>I repeat, most of T/ony\u2019s moments of\ncondescendence are either jokes or T/ony\u2019s/RDJ\u2019s way of carrying himself that\nmight make mostly innocuous comments offensive or probably his way of lashing\nout when he\u2019s angry or upset. It\u2019s not planned or out of maliciousness, just\nthoughtlessness. If it wasn\u2019t, he probably would have told Peter that it wasn\u2019t\na test when he asked<sup>14</sup>, to manipulate him, maybe guilt him into\nagreeing. That doesn\u2019t change their effect.</p><p>[1: Afraid he\u2019ll agree? 2: Stop making every\nclassic Spider-Man thing about T/ony. 3: How convenient that T/ony knew exactly\neverything that Peter needed and put it in the suit even before meeting and\ntalking to him or that he had time to add it while planning for the fight,\nbefore he got to his hotel room. 3: This explains why he\u2019s so comfortable just\ndropping him then picking him up whenever it suits him, and also it makes sense\nas an investment. Pay your workers well and reap the benefits of their\nwellbeing and the skills they develop while/by working for you. 5: Why do I\nhave to go through this with everyone but Peter? I\u2019d say every man, but I\nwouldn0t know, since May only appears on screen to show what a cool mom she is\nto his nephew and to be slobbered over by men, they deleted the one scene where\nshe could have been shown as her own person and as someone who raised the boy\nwho\u2019d become Spider-Man because hey <i>why\nwould I bother showing that when I could point out how hot Aunt May who\u2019s\ninitially characterized by being ill and a bit doddering but <b>who pushes through that and her grief over\nthe loss of her husband(s) with her immense strength of will and inspired by\nher caring for her boy just as he pushes through the grief of life with his\nimmense strength of will probably learned from her and inspired by his caring\nfor his mom/aunt/and uncle/dad.</b></i> 6: Stahhhhp. 7: Let him go to ESU, you\ncowards. (I literally just remembered T/ony went to MIT. First, wow, another\nparallel, much surprised. Second, a good chance to set him apart from T/ony and\nlet him be his own person, as many fans who disagree with Peter having a mentor\nbut like their relationship have say is probably what\u2019s going to happen. Third,\nyou\u2019re taking ESU disaster student Peter Parker from my cold, dead hands and\ntrigger the curse of the mummy so I\u2019ll come back to life, take it back and beat\nyou on the head with it. 8: The more I think about that scene the hotter my\nblood boils. 9: Except in the MCU because who cares about anything but\nstrength? Oh, yeah, and sticky fingers. 10: Her teenager disappeared from school\nat a point in his life where he\u2019s making a lot of bad decisions all of a sudden\nand he comes back home in tears and thrown together clothes? Listen, I\u2019m not\nfrom New York, I don\u2019t know exactly how bad crime is over there, but that\u2019s\nsure to raise a red alert in anyone, right? 11: I didn\u2019t recognize that shirt\nas Pepper\u2019s when I watched the movie, and I don\u2019t think we were meant to. I\nthink we were just supposed to think he went ahead and bought the most\nembarrassing outfit he could find, so I\u2019m not including that in the main body.\n12: with a nice fuck you to May, but I\u2019m used to the scriptwriters\u2019 attitude\ntowards her by now. 13: To Spider-Man, who, even though they didn\u2019t bother to\nestablish the Parkers as struggling with money (beyond Peter dumpster diving)\nand, really, given the times and May\u2019s youth still wouldn\u2019t lead to Peter\nworking as a teenager and having a lot of his problems/anxieties revolving\naround money, is still a character who\u2019s characterized by <i>a lot of his problems/anxieties revolving around money</i>? 14: Also,\nnice way of destroying the only development you gave to the character that\ndidn\u2019t require you to get rid of the other things you\u2019ve established in the\nprevious movie. He wants to look after the little guy? Now he just wants to be an\nAvenger. He was clever, made his own computers and equipment and came up with\nplans/strategized? Now he lacks common sense and he\u2019s only smart academically\nand because people say so. He was able to go toe-to-toe with Avengers? Now he\u2019s\njust plain incompetent and can\u2019t even swing. He cared enough about school that\nhe wouldn\u2019t just eff off to Germany, even if T/ony St/ark asked? Now he\u2019s just\nwaiting for the call and ready to drop out and move upstate. And then when he\u2019s\nfinally getting his priorities straight, he ruins it and asks if it was a test.\nDo you just throw shit at a wall and hope it sticks or did you actually plan to\ngive him character development but got scared that something would go wrong and\nplayed it down?]</p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>FAIR FEEDBACK: INCOMPLETE</h2><p>On my count, T/ony shows Peter a reaction to\nhis actions five times. Of those, two of them are exaggerated and one is\ncomplicated, as I will explain shortly.</p><p>The first two, will be analyzed together due to\ntheir similarity<sup>1</sup>, are in CA:CW, in the bedroom scene, and in the\ncar scene in Homecoming. Although, as I\u2019ve explained, there are problems with\nthe context of that praise, it\u2019s honest and an appropriate response when you\nthink someone\u2019s skilled. A simple \u201cthis is good work\u201d, just like in the car\nscene. That time, he\u2019s technically talking to May about Peter\u2019s (fictitious)\nwork at the retreat, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stretch to say it\u2019s meant for\nPeter.</p><p>The third feedback moment, the complicated one,\nis the phone call right before the ferry accident. I say it\u2019s complicated\nbecause, in the context of everything else we\u2019ve seen before in the movie, that\nwas out of character and mostly for plot convenience. Despite that, what we get\nto hear shows it would have been \u201cfair feedback\u201d, at least given what T/ony\nknows, and possibly a turning point for their relationship that might have led\nto a good mentorship, if it hadn\u2019t come at that particular moment. He calls\nafter hearing about him saving his friends at Washington and mentions \u201cgreat\nthings to come, which we can assume means the training which would have led to\nmore frequent<sup>2</sup> interaction and communication which would probably\nhave solved most of the problems I\u2019ve pointed out. However, from an objective\npoint of view, that feedback wasn\u2019t fair, since the Washington incident was\nPeter\u2019s fault. He was the one who brought the Chitauri energy core and left it\nwith his non-powered friend after just picking it off the streets and\nirresponsibly not telling the police or anyone who could deal with it better\nthan him (except T/ony) and carrying it around on him. Those actions deserved\npunishment. He also used it to disobey T/ony\u2019s orders and investigate the\nVulture\u2019s operations. If he had had this information, T/ony most likely\nwouldn\u2019t have congratulated him. Peter, by not giving him all the information,\nprevented him from performing his duties as a mentor correctly, but this\nhappened because T/ony failed to provide him with a sense of reliability and\nalienating him by not respecting him. This leaves us, for the purposes of this\nsection, with a situation in which T/ony doesn\u2019t actually give Peter fair\nfeedback, but it isn\u2019t completely his fault.</p><p>The fourth time is the post-ferry lecture. In\nthis case, he was right to choose to punish Peter, but wrong in the delivery of\nthat punishment. I\u2019ve explained everything that bothers me about this scene: T/ony\nis condescending in how he says things; his chastisement is based around Peter\nnot listening to him instead of the things he actually did wrong and led to him\nendangering people, among which are being too eager to please him and his whole\ninvolvement with the Chitauri energy core, which didn\u2019t actually affect the\noutcome of the ferry accident; his whole lecture does more harm than good.\nThen, by taking away the suit, he ends the relationship with Peter. That\u2019s his\nreaction to, to his knowledge, Peter\u2019s first strike. Instead of trying to fix\nthings, he just discards him. Maybe he planned to give it back, but that would\nmake the threat intentionally manipulative, which would be even worse.</p><p>The fifth time is at the upstate facility\nwhere, after Peter did everything he told him not to, again, which he punished\nhim for before, he praises him<sup>3</sup> and offers to make him an Avenger<sup>4</sup>.\nPeter does what he was punished for doing before, which includes endangering people\nthe same way he did at the ferry (he showed up to fight crime, things went\nsideways and he tried to fix it. The only difference is that he needed help in\nthe ferry while both the plane and the beach were miraculously empty), only he\nsucceeds this time, and T/ony\u2019s reaction is to give him everything he wants.\nI\u2019m not saying Peter doesn\u2019t deserve reward, I\u2019m saying that T/ony\u2019s is over\nthe top, not only because he doesn\u2019t deserve it, but also because it would end\nup being bad for him. The Avengers are the Big Leagues and he\u2019s not ready for\nit.<sup>5</sup> Even if they took the time to train him, he\u2019d have to upend his\nlife as Peter Parker, even if he didn\u2019t reveal his identity.<sup>6</sup> He\u2019d\nhave to drop out, and tell his Aunt at the very least, since her life would be\nupended, too. He\u2019s not getting what he thinks he\u2019s buying since the Avengers at\nthat point are not the idealized elite who saved him and all the world when he\nwas eight, but just T/ony, Vision and a disabled and probably still recovering\nRhodey, who are bound by the Accords and now completely beholden to the UN. If\nyou\u2019re doing Peter Parker right, he\u2019ll never agree to only acting when he\u2019s\nallowed, or doing something he thinks is wrong. They got this right in the\nmovie by making him go against T/ony even though he\u2019s his hero. If it\u2019s true\nthat T/ony told people that he recruited a teenager and they were judgmental,\nhe\u2019ll be exposed to that skepticism.<sup>7</sup> He\u2019ll be (immediately) exposed\nto the media\u2019s scrutiny as the new Avenger, and the one that came after Civil\nWar. </p><p>What I\u2019m trying to say with all this is that\nonce again T/ony\u2019s reaction is over-the-top and inappropriate. He also gives\nPeter the wrong message: succeed and I\u2019ll give you the world; fail and I\u2019ll\ntake it away. There is also the small uncomfortable matter that, while this may\nnot have held weight in his decision, Peter\u2019s success was closely tied with\ndoing T/ony a favor by saving his plane. It wasn\u2019t the point, but it goes to\nshow that constantly trying to make everything about T/ony has its downsides.</p><p>[1:and because all I have to say about each of\nthem is \u201cyou didn\u2019t fuck up here\u201d and that\u2019s hardly paragraph worthy. 2: As if\nthat was hard, they were at rock bottom at \u201cnever\u201d. 3: And claims credit for\nPeter\u2019s success stop claiming credit for Peter\u2019s success ffs. 4: As the\nAvengers stand at that point. 5: I\u2019ve said it once and I\u2019ll say it again, he\u2019s\nplain incompetent. 6: Spider-Man would be the best hero to use to show the\neffects of the Accords, since he\u2019d be screwed over without prep or lube by\nthem, but Marvel didn\u2019t intend to take that anywhere, which shows even in Civil\nWar, since most of the movie and for most of the characters it isn\u2019t about them\nanyway. 7: And he won\u2019t be able to prove them wrong.]</p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>AID: COMPROMISED / DISTANCE: FAIL</h2><p>So, you thought I\u2019d be nice to the\nrelationship/T/ony St/ark. </p><p>As I said before, T/ony provides a lot of aid.\nHe takes care that the suit \u201csuits\u201d Peter<sup>1</sup>: it has the lenses to\nprevent overwhelming his senses, the new webshooters, it fits his acrobatic\nlifestyle better<sup>2</sup>, it has tracers he can use knowingly and\napparently some other functions which activate automatically in case of\nemergency if Peter can\u2019t do it himself.<sup>3</sup></p><p>Furthermore, it has some kind of devise to warn\nhim if Peter\u2019s in some trouble the suit can detect (although it does depend on\nInternet connection) and, when he gets that warning, T/ony wastes no time to\nget a suit to save him, just as he goes running when he figures out Peter\u2019s on\nthe ferry, where he knows a deal\u2019s about to go through. Then, he offers Peter a\nhome at the facility, a place on the Avengers, the Iron Spider suit and a\nfather figure in himself.<sup>4</sup></p><p>All in all, when Peter\u2019s on T/ony\u2019s good\ngraces, he holds the world upon a string.<sup>5</sup> He\u2019s provided with aid in\nspades. When it comes to actions of aid, I can\u2019t complain at all. The only\ntimes when he didn\u2019t come to Peter\u2019s rescue in the movie were when it would\nmake sense because he wasn\u2019t keeping tabs anymore and the movie actually\nrequired his absence. It\u2019s the material aid that, perhaps unfairly, I\u2019ll admit,\nI\u2019m not happy with. The problem is that he doesn\u2019t manage well the distance I\ntalked about in the introduction.</p><p>In every other way, he\u2019s too distant. This\ndistance means that his attempts at material aid backfire, because he\u2019s not\nthere to ensure the correct use of the equipment. Therefore, Peter first\nendangers himself by using the suit\u2019s extra abilities because he doesn\u2019t\nunderstand them and later uses them to go against T/ony\u2019s wishes. In addition\nto give Peter this space to reject him, his distance also causes it by breeding\nresentment or/and disconnect on Peter\u2019s side. </p><p>On the other hand, the moments and ways in\nwhich he\u2019s present he\u2019s overbearing. Physically and emotionally, he goes from\nignoring Peter to taking the opportunity of saving him to set down rules that\ngo against what Peter believes in and which, because of that, will be difficult\nto follow since the trouble he\u2019s supposed to avoid is happening right before\nhis eyes. Then he calls before the ferry incident, sets himself up as Peter\u2019s\nfather figure (by referencing his own father and saying he\u2019ll succeed where he\nfailed) and is about to tell Peter that he\u2019s going to start training him. Note\nthat I say \u201ctell that\u201d and not some other, more unassertive words like\n\u201csuggest\u201d or \u201coffer\u201d. It\u2019s for a reason. In the call, T/ony constantly wrestles\nfor control of the conversation, and from Peter. Without a by-your leave, he\ndecides he\u2019s going to try to parent Peter. That\u2019s the basis of all their\ninteractions, T/ony trying to move Peter to where he wants him, Peter resisting\nand T/ony dragging him or leaning on him to make him comply, with oftentimes\npoor results. </p><p>Other way in which he\u2019s not giving room for\nPeter to be himself is by giving him the suit as it was. Remember when I\nmentioned that I\u2019d use the comics to support my claims? Here it is. Putting\naside the fact that Peter himself made the suit (the movie is apparently based\non Ultimate Spider-Man<sup>6</sup>, and they already changed it so it would be\nMary Jane who made him the suit instead there), a good example for what I\u2019m\nsaying is the spider-tracers. The original, 616 Peter Parker very early on made\nthe spider tracers, simple spider-shaped devices that allowed him to track\npeople, first with a receiver and later he programs them so he can find them\nwith his spider-sense.<sup>7</sup> You might remember a spider-like tracer in\nthe movie. T/ony gave it to him and both it and the \u201creceiver\u201d are a hundred\ntimes more advanced than the ones Peter uses in the comics. Thus, he has no\nreason to keep working on it and will probably never figure out how to tap into\nhis spider-sense\u2019s frequency. The webshooters come with hundreds of different\ncombinations programmed into them, so he has no reason to tinker with them. He\nhas no reason to develop his skills at all because it\u2019s all been handed to him.\nAnd it\u2019s not like Peter wants to be a poet; he has both talent and interest in\nscience but no reason to work on it. T/ony himself commented that his work was\nimpressive. He said Peter in general, his skills, his powers, his morals, was\ngreat, but then the first thing he did was limit him and then try to shape him\ninto something that fit him better, like someone who\u2019d ignore trouble, someone\nwho he saw as eventually going to want to use an Instant Kill Mode. </p><p>I\u2019ve talked about the how, but here\u2019s why the\nmentorship fails. T/ony is, at once, too distant and too overbearing.</p><p>He sees potential in Peter and so he invests in\nhim with the suit, and takes measures to protect that investment by putting\neverything he thinks will help him survive in it. This means he has a very set\npath he wants Peter to follow and to that end put bumpers on the sides. Peter\ncould get rid of them and do his own thing, but they make life easier and so he\ndoesn\u2019t even need to learn how to aim because he has the bumpers to fall back\non. The moment Peter decides to try it anyway, T/ony shows no hesitation in\ncutting him loose and taking his investment back, though. And why wouldn\u2019t he,\nif T/ony doesn\u2019t tell him the rules of the game and won\u2019t even play with him?</p><p>No, I don\u2019t think T/ony does it on purpose. I\nthink he does care about Peter. But if he\u2019s a dad, he\u2019s one of those rich ones\nwho don\u2019t make time for their kids and try to make up for it by buying them\nexpensive gifts that they may or may not want and justify it by saying they\u2019re\njust making sure they have a good future, even though their kids don\u2019t want to\nwork on their law firm. </p><p>[1: As I said before, it\u2019s weird, and by weird\nI mean eye-rollingly-convenient, just how well T/ony could predict the needs of\nsomeone he hadn\u2019t even met. 2: Toight. 3: Which is useful since Peter doesn\u2019t\nknow about them. 4: Don\u2019t get up in my face, I never said T/ony didn\u2019t care\nabout Peter or might be open to a father/son relationship with him, only that\nhe sucks at it. 5: I\u2019ve already talked about what happens when he isn\u2019t, but\nmentioning that in the main body is just being petty at this point. 6: In ways\nthey wouldn\u2019t like to admit. 7: Some people take a page out of Bruce Wayne\u2019s\nbook a prefix part of their name to everything to cope and that\u2019s valid.]</p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>CONCLUSION</h2><p>If the father/son relationship between Peter\nand T/ony doesn\u2019t exist. The scriptwriters used certain cues that are widely\nassociated with parents reacting to their kids or blatantly compared T/ony to\nhis father in how he acted towards Peter, implying he was filling the same\nrole. Their interactions, though, are minimal and most plain conflictive, while\nalmost all had problematic undertones and context, even when the characters had\nthe best intentions. T/ony fails to communicate with Peter and so he fails him\nin almost every aspect, and by the time he gets his act together, Peter, while\nstill admiring him and wanting his attention and to be an Avenger, has rejected\nhis authority both because he doesn\u2019t trust it and because accepting it would\nmean going against his own beliefs and wishes. Since Peter meets with failure, T/ony\ncan\u2019t tolerate the challenge and doesn\u2019t see any reason to compromise and so cuts\nPeter off, claiming that it will be permanent. After Peter succeeds, T/ony\nwelcomes him back without any of them addressing the issues that had set them\napart before and tries to impose his way again by giving him everything he\nwanted, but Peter rejects him. They go their own ways, understanding that Peter\nwill be his own person, and with this understanding also setting the groundwork\nfor a better, functional relationship. </p><p>Fans, as it is their right, created a very\ndifferent relationship following the cues and the emotional manipulation used\nin the movie. Marvel profits from it without having had to actually put effort\ninto the relationship. </p><p>It should be pointed out that any mentorship\nrelationship involving a teenage hero will always be problematic since the\nmentor will be complicit at best and completely to blame at most for child\nendangerment. Marvel realized this 60 years ago and, if my memory serves, until\nmodern times no teenage hero has had a mentor or operated in a team, with\nteam-ups being the exception, since Johnny Storm (and the rest of the FF\nfamily). This trend was started \n\nand popularized\n\nby <i>Spider-Man</i>.\u00a0</p>",
                "content": "<p>Disclaimer: Some of the probably tiny amount of\nreaders this is gonna get are probably asking themselves, &ldquo;What? Failed? Bitch,\nwhere? T/ony and Peter are <i>the</i>\nfather/son duo.&rdquo; Answer: in reality, objectively. I used to be a fan of the\ndynamic, because I love both Peter Parker and the &ldquo;found family&rdquo; trope, but\nI&rsquo;ve given the matter a lot of thought (that&rsquo;s actually the reason I&rsquo;m sitting\ndown to write it; I&rsquo;m hoping to put it in words to put it out of my thoughts)\nand I&rsquo;m calling them how I see them.<br /></p><p>Fair warning: To/ny stans, if they don&rsquo;t want\nto get upset, shouldn&rsquo;t read this. It won&rsquo;t be bashing him, I&rsquo;ll be trying to\nbe fair, but it will be critical of him. You shouldn&rsquo;t see this, since I&rsquo;m\ntagging it accordingly, but maybe a Spider-Man fan who also likes T/ony, is new\nto the fandom and hasn&rsquo;t blacklisted &ldquo;anti T/ony st/ark&rdquo; might find it. </p><p>Also, I might be slightly biased because of\nwhat I know from the Spider-Man comics, which I&rsquo;m in the process of reading\nnow, but of which I knew very little when I first thought of this. I will be\nbringing up those few things that I knew, not because I think that the movie\nshould be absolutely identical to it, but because it&rsquo;s actually relevant to the\nargument. (Although from what I&rsquo;ve seen in the comics and what I&rsquo;ve read from\npeople who know better than me, there is plenty of reason to be offended by the\nmovie and it&rsquo;s &ldquo;accuracy&rdquo; that has nothing to do with gate-keeping nitpicking.)</p><p>Last, I&rsquo;ll be adding slightly off-topic\nopinions between [these]. I won&rsquo;t start talking about Black Panther, but they&rsquo;ll\nbe subjective comments (right or wrong) and won&rsquo;t have much to do with the\nactual argument. Don&rsquo;t want to read the, don&rsquo;t read them; if you disagree, you\ndisagree. It&rsquo;s your opinion and you can do what you want just like this is my\npost and I do what I want, but, like I said, the actual argument will be\nseparate from them, so it should be read accordingly. (No saying my argument is\nwrong because I prefer Seven Up over Sprite.) </p><p>Now, to the actual thing.</p><p>An ideal mentor should provide the mentee with:\ntraining (in whatever form this training takes, i.e. it counts if it&rsquo;s just\nadvice on life), support (the emotional kind), aid (more substantial support;\nequipment and actions fall into this category), a clear set of rules, respect\n(not that of an equal in the field the mentorship&rsquo;s taking place, but at least\nthat of a person to another, enough to see the mentee for what they are), fair feedback\n(appropriate encouragement when they do something right, appropriate punishment\nwhen they do something wrong), frequent if not constant assessment. This last\none is especially important to make sure all these other things are being done\nadequately (it would be useless to try to teach a 5<sup>th</sup> grader math\ngenius how to add, unfair to tell them that they can&rsquo;t sleep over at a friend&rsquo;s\nhouse because you&rsquo;re afraid they&rsquo;ll get home sick and want to go home when\nthey&rsquo;ve been doing it for a while now) and to give the mentee a sense of\nreliability, since a relationship has to be maintained by two people, and a\nmentee that doesn&rsquo;t trust their mentor won&rsquo;t let them perform their duties. </p><p>Most importantly, though, the mentor has to give\nall of this to the mentee as tools to use for themselves, understanding that\neventually they should outgrow the need for mentoring. (Which doesn&rsquo;t mean\noutgrowing the need/desire for the relationship itself. More in the sense of graduating\nand going from a friendly relationship with a teacher to becoming actual\nfriends who respect each other as equals and aren&rsquo;t part of an imbalanced\nrelationship the way that of a mentor/mentee is.) This requires a very exact\ndistance which allows the mentor to carry out their duties and receive feedback\nwhile still letting the mentee be their own person and grow on their own.</p><p>T/ony fails to provide everything but aid. I\nconsidered including fair feedback, but even that misses the &ldquo;fair&rdquo; part.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><h2><br /></h2><h2>SENSE OF RELIABILITY: FAIL</h2><p>T/ony doesn&rsquo;t communicate with Peter, leading\nhim to think he can&rsquo;t rely on him.</p><p>There are ways to refute this statement, such\nas pointing out the suit, which T/ony made to protect Peter and into which he\nseemed to have put a lot of effort, or that he was listening to Peter&rsquo;s messages,\nsince he was able to mention the churro lady. I&rsquo;ll address this later on. Right\nnow, I&rsquo;ll only say that what&rsquo;s important isn&rsquo;t being reliable<sup>1</sup>, but\ngiving Peter a sense of reliability, which he failed to do, and so he disobeyed\nhim at every turn. We can assume that Peter stopped giving Happy updates, so he\nstopped putting effort in the relationship, and when T/ony went to confront him\nwhen he messed up, Peter refused to acknowledge any kind of authority on his\npart except right of ownership of the suit. It could be said that this was\nbecause Peter was trying to prove himself worthy of becoming an Avenger and it\nwas just childish rebellion and, while I wouldn&rsquo;t disagree, I&rsquo;d say that, be\nthat as it may, Peter still rejected and circumvented T/ony&rsquo;s authority. He was\nconvinced he was wrong and tried to prove it by doing things on his own.<sup>2</sup></p><p>[1: Which T/ony wasn&rsquo;t, anyway. 2: As he&rsquo;d been\ndoing all along.]</p><p><br /></p><hr /><h2><br /></h2><h2>TRAINING: FAIL</h2><p>T/ony doesn&rsquo;t train Peter. He doesn&rsquo;t meet\nPeter until he&rsquo;s had his powers for 6 months, probably has been Spider-Man for\naround 5, and has established himself as a &ldquo;cool&rdquo; (enough to have more than one\nvideo on YouTube<sup>1</sup>) vigilante, if not a hero in his own right. He\ngoes to Germany and holds his own against both Sam and Bucky, even with all his\nfanboying<sup>2</sup>. He saved Rhodey from crashing into a plane. He was\nessential in beating Scott.<sup> 3 4</sup></p><p>By the time CA:CW rolls around, ability wise, Peter\nhas a handle on things<sup>5</sup> that, while not perfect, can improve only\nwith experience, which also goes for his ability to assess and react to a\nsituation accordingly, and seems to have a grip on the direction of his career\n(go on patrol, help the &ldquo;little guy&rdquo;). He could handle himself in his chosen\npath and was no push-over when taken out of his element. Which is a good thing,\nsince the only &ldquo;training&rdquo; he gave him, besides indoctrination to keep him from\nlistening to Cap, was &ldquo;aim for the legs&rdquo;.</p><p>In Homecoming, for most of the movie Peter uses\nthe St/ark suit. The only two features we see him use are: the new webshooters\nand the tracing chip (the one he uses himself). We can assume that, as far as\nPeter knows until his first fight with the Vulture, that&rsquo;s all it does. Then, T/ony\ntells him that he put everything into his suit. Peter doesn&rsquo;t really look into\nit, even after he finds out there&rsquo;s a tracer in his suit. He hacks into it to\ntake the tracer out and Ned tells him about the training wheels. More on some\nof this stuff later. What&rsquo;s important now is that Peter wasn&rsquo;t trained in how\nto use the suit. He wasn&rsquo;t even told he was supposed to be trained. He didn&rsquo;t\nknow about the suit&rsquo;s capabilities and, until he takes a moment to see for\nhimself how it works, i.e. train himself, again, it actually hinders him.</p><p>[1: I mean, to be fair, the first video,\nbecause of the way it&rsquo;s framed (static and with Peter swinging right in front\nof it) and how convenient it is that someone was just recording a hijacking\nPeter was there to stop, was probably made by Peter himself. 2: Fun fact, Word\ntried to change fanboying into annoying. Tea. 3: This is meant as a comment on\nhis ability, not the other Avengers, but, since Scott couldn&rsquo;t break the\nwebbing on his legs, he also probably wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to break it if he\nwas wrapped upon it completely, so, hypothetically, Peter could have tied him\nup and delivered the last punch himself. 4: What a pity he lost not only most\nof his skill but also his commons sense and smarts by Homecoming. I mean, he\ndoes know he&rsquo;s in New York, right? Why was his best idea to get the bike back\nto its owner to leave it in the middle of the sidewalk? 5: (this one will make\nme sound At least biased, at most, obsessed) of the powers Feige saw fit to let\nhim keep, which amount to strength and his Spider-sense limited by contrivances\n(show that he has it and make him cooler in a fight, but drop it when it could\ncome useful, like with the drone). Just to give you an idea: in the comics,\nPeter is fast enough that people often say that he can&rsquo;t be human. The Green\nGoblin says that he&rsquo;s impressed by his agility. Unless it doesn&rsquo;t fit the plot,\nhis Spidey- sense lets him fight people in the dark. All these combined allow\nhim to dodge bullets. Apply this knowledge to his fight scenes. Also apply his\nstickiness and the fact that he&rsquo;s super strong while Cap&rsquo;s supposed to be at\nhuman peak, as in, he&rsquo;s the best any human can be, but still human, to his\nfight with Cap. Would Cap still have beaten him? Of effing course, but the\nfight would have been more about strategy than outright punches. Not completely\nthough, his punches would still have been effective. I mean, kinda. I can\nactually see the fight happening as it did (except when Cap pulls Peter to him)\nin the comics, even with Peter not being wet around the ears as he is in CA:CW.\nI guess I mostly wanted to comment on his powers. Also, he has a super-human\nsense of balance, so him wobbling on the hero landing was shit.]</p><p><br /></p><hr /><h2><br /></h2><h2>SUPPORT: FAIL</h2><p>T/ony and Peter talk all of six times during\nthe movie, and that&rsquo;s being extremely generous, since I&rsquo;m counting the ferry\ncall, the ferry save, and the post ferry scene as three different occasions.\nI&rsquo;ll talk about each of them in other sections of the post, but at no point\ndoes T/ony ever provide emotional support to Peter. Him apparently\nreading/listening to his messages but not replying is him not providing\nemotional support. Actually&hellip;</p><p>Here it gets <i>heavily</i> T/ony critical. In the post-ferry scene, however you want\nto frame it, went horribly. Now, don&rsquo;t get me wrong. Peter deserved a lecture. More.\nHe, if you&rsquo;ll forgive the parlance in the &ldquo;objective&rdquo; part of the post, fucked\nup. I&rsquo;m not saying he didn&rsquo;t. However, the way T/ony went about it was so wrong\nhe provided the exact opposite of emotional support and drove him to tears\nhours after the fact AND to stop being Spider-Man. I know there will be those\nthat will say, &ldquo;Hey, that&rsquo;s good, right? I mean, first you complain about him\ncondoning his vigilantism and then you complain about him ending it? Make up\nyour mind.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a difference between making a minor understand that they\nshouldn&rsquo;t do some things for their own safety and making them feel like\nscrew-ups who are nothing without a piece of clothing. </p><p>Because here&rsquo;s how the scene went. Peter\nscrewed the pooch. T/ony informs him of this. Gives him a bit of a\ntongue-lashing. Peter asks if everyone&rsquo;s okay. T/ony says no thanks to him. Not\nhow I would have worded it, but I have both the disadvantage of closeness,\nbecause I know what Peter was thinking and I empathize with him because of that<sup>1</sup>,\nand the advantage of distance, because I haven&rsquo;t landed on a roof after having\nto save all those people in the ferry along with the kid whose life I feel\nresponsible for, after he disobeyed my orders. Peter gives voice to my thoughts:\nhe was trying to protect people<sup>2</sup>, you know, his job. He points out\nthat he had tried to tell T/ony, that he had asked for his help/him to play\ninterference before, but he blew him off.<sup>3</sup> He says that if T/ony\ncared, he&rsquo;d be there.<sup>4</sup></p><p>Then<sup>5</sup>, T/ony steps out of the suit.\nHe tells him that he&rsquo;d called the FBI. The FBI would have been &ndash;<i>was</i>&mdash;useless against the Vulture. Even if\nthey weren&rsquo;t, Peter didn&rsquo;t know that, because the only thing T/ony told him was\nthat the weapons dealing was too small for the Avengers<sup>6</sup>, but too\nbig for Peter and to call Happy if he saw them again. Happy, who had been\nignoring Peter like he was a street vendor. And if he knew enough about their\ncommunications to know about the churro lady, he had to know Happy was ignoring\nhim. Actually, I want to quote him. &ldquo;Take him down now, huh? Crockett,\nthere are people who handle this son of thing.&rdquo; He told Spider-Man to ignore\nhis responsibilities. </p><p>T/ony, there&rsquo;s no other way\nto say this, guilt-trips him by saying he was the only one who believed in him<sup>7</sup>.\nHe says he got criticized for choosing to have faith in a 14yo. The only good\nreason to say that would have been to make Peter feel like he was in his debt. Then,\nafter making the, ultimately, but only partially<sup>8</sup>, true assertion\nthat if anyone had died that night it would have been on Peter (I want you to\ntake a second to consider the callousness of telling a 15yo that; change the\nphrasing from &ldquo;on you&rdquo; to &ldquo;it&rsquo;s your fault&rdquo;), he tells Peter that if he had\ndied, he&rsquo;d have felt responsible and that he doesn&rsquo;t need that<sup>9</sup>. He&rsquo;s\nmaking someone who already feels bad feel worse. That&rsquo;s not the point of\nlectures. The point of lectures is making someone understand what they did\nwrong, why what they did was wrong, how to avoid it in the future and, maybe,\nhow to fix it. Admittedly<sup>10</sup>, T/ony does that, but he completely\ntears Peter down in the process. I&rsquo;m not saying that he should be allowed to\nget away scott free, either by T/ony or by the narrative, but that&rsquo;s not the\nway to do it, because of many reasons, but mainly because Peter gets the wrong\nlesson. This is, first, because T/ony insists on making everything about\nhimself. He blames everything that happened on Peter disobeying him; when Peter\npoints out the way he failed, he makes an argument that, yes, saves him from\nlooking like a complete ass, but fails to address the underlying root of the\nproblem which is that Peter was reacting to the information he had available,\nwhich included absolutely nothing from him except (the illusion of) disregard;\nhe makes himself the victim of the danger <i>Peter</i>\ngets into. </p><p>The last part draws into\nthe second thing Peter got wrong about the lecture, which is that he&rsquo;s a\nscrew-up. He now not only feels guilty about his own failure, the whole blame\nfor the accident has been laid on him<sup>11</sup>. Then, the coup de gr&acirc;ce.</p><p>T/ony asks for the suit\nback. (This is not it). Peter begs him not to, and then claims he&rsquo;s nothing\nwithout the suit<sup>12</sup>.</p><p>And T/ony answers that, if\nhe&rsquo;s nothing without the suit, then he shouldn&rsquo;t have it<sup>13</sup>.</p><p>And then he takes the suit.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>Put it this way. Peter says\nA. T/ony answers &ldquo;If A, then B&rdquo; (A=&gt;B)<sup>14</sup>. Then T/ony says B.</p><p>I know it&rsquo;s not what he\nmeant. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s what Feige, or Goldstein and Daley intended. Believe\nme, I do. That doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that T/ony indirectly tells Peter he&rsquo;s\nnothing, and Peter thinks he&rsquo;s nothing, and the movie supports this by making\nthe emotional climax of the movie about Peter proving he&rsquo;s not nothing.</p><p>That is not emotional\nsupport. If it was done often enough, you could make a case for it being\nemotional abuse, especially since it was done at a time when Peter, a child who\nadmires T/ony and so is very impressionable where he&rsquo;s concerned, was already\nfeeling guilty, so that T/ony&rsquo;s words reinforce the thought that he&rsquo;s nothing.\nAnd all of this is in the context of T/ony ignoring Peter for two months,\nappearing to ignore his worries, going back to ignoring him until he messes up,\nmaking the point of the following lecture that everything wrong that had\nhappened on the ferry happened because Peter didn&rsquo;t obey T/ony&rsquo;s orders and\nthen, the next time they speak, framing all of that and telling Peter,\nessentially, that he&rsquo;s nothing, as a &ldquo;the tough-love moment that he needed.&rdquo;</p><p>I believe that the only\nreason a lot of people (I haven&rsquo;t even seen anyone in the anti-T/ony crowd\npoint this out) let this slide is because the moment follows T/ony&rsquo;s oh-so-convenient\ncall to Peter and instantly followed itself by his &ldquo;Now I sound like my father&rdquo;\nline, where he sets himself up in a fatherly role. This way, when people think\nof the scene, they think it a fatherly lecture without seeming to remember the\nnothing line<sup>15</sup>, or they think it the indispensable set up for the\nwarehouse scene<sup>16</sup>.</p><p>[1: And because he&rsquo;s the\nprotagonist, and my favorite. 2: I mean, sure, becoming an Avenger was also a\nbig part of his motivations, but the point is that going after supervillians is\nthe heroic thing to do. 3: Throwing in a nice &ldquo;this is all your fault&rdquo;, for\ngood measure. 4: He, but I actually mean the scriptwriters, makes it seem like\nhis whole argument was based on T/ony not caring and Peter being hurt and angry\nand lashing out because of that and not because he had any actual reason for\ngoing to the ferry, since they only address the matter of T/ony caring/listening/being\nthere (at that moment at least, which is supposed to mean/make us think he was\nalways there), and not the consequences of him not showing it. 5: &hellip;we start\ngetting emotionally manipulated. 6: With Rhodey disabled, doesn&rsquo;t that just\nmean T/ony and Vision at this point? 7: First, shitty. Second, as other people\nhave pointed out, he&rsquo;s, by T/ony&rsquo;s accounts, which, to respect Peter&rsquo;s wishes\nand privacy, he should have only given maybe to Pepper and Vision, 14. Maybe\nwhen they asked &ldquo;are you insane?&rdquo; they were questioning your morals, not your\nsanity. Third, the scene where Happy says he told T/ony that he was a good kid\nmight make this a lie, if that wasn&rsquo;t Happy trying to take credit. Personally,\nI think the latter, I&rsquo;ve always thought so. 8: It&rsquo;s important to me that people\nunderstand that it wasn&rsquo;t Peter with the gun and, since the FBI was already\nthere ready to bust the deal, the fight would have happened anyway but with\nmore casualties. I mean, they probably wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to give them\nenough trouble that the ferry would be broken in two, but if T/ony hadn&rsquo;t\ncalled when he did, he wouldn&rsquo;t have gone to help. 9: Stop playing the victim.\nAlso, stop making every single one of Peter&rsquo;s actions about you, now we have\nhis literal death scene made to be all about you. This goes to the stans, too.\nStop making all of Peter&rsquo;s life about T/ony, Marvel&rsquo;s already busy at that. 10:\nI disagree with the truthfulness (as in veracity, not sincerity) of what he&rsquo;s\nsaying, he is explaining all the wh&rsquo;s. 11: He is to blame for a lot of it. I\nmean, technically, if he hadn&rsquo;t stopped all his other deals, he might not have\ntried the one in the ferry. Of course that&rsquo;s nitpicking, because we can&rsquo;t be\nsure and, as a hero, it&rsquo;s his job to stop villains and, as Spider-Man, it&rsquo;s his\n(self-appointed) job to stop crime in general. Then again, let&rsquo;s not forget,\nyou know, the criminal and the guy who could have given him the information\nthat might have made him decide to stay out of it. 12: The fact that he&rsquo;d been\nSpider-Man without it for long enough aside&hellip; 13: Instead of, you know, telling\nhim it wasn&rsquo;t true. Actually, a night has gone since I wrote the 12 to mark\nthat I wanted to comment and the moment of writing this, so I don&rsquo;t remember\nwhat I wanted to say. 14: They give it a relationship of cause-effect, and it&rsquo;s\nnot the same as B=&gt;A, but for the effect they have on both Peter and the\nmovie, it might as well be an equivalence. 15: Unless they want to make a\nparallel between him and T/ony both being told they&rsquo;re nothing without the\nsuits (and proving that&rsquo;s false) because &ldquo;they&rsquo;re so alike! Look at this dad\nand his son!!&rdquo; without taking a moment to remember who exactly told Peter he\nwas nothing without the suit. 16: I&hellip; don&rsquo;t understand how this line in that\ncontext can be seen as motivational. The only way it works, even if barely, is\nif we go with the theory that Peter thinks he&rsquo;s nothing without the suit and T/ony\nagrees with him and he&rsquo;s lifting the warehouse out of spite. I mean, if he&rsquo;d\nhis own words (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m nothing without this suit&rdquo;), it could be seen as a moment\nof growth, of telling himself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still Peter, and I&rsquo;m still Spider-Man&rdquo;, but\nhe remembers T/ony&rsquo;s. His exact words are &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re nothing without this [St/ark]\nsuit, then you shouldn&rsquo;t have it.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s take a moment and see how Peter&rsquo;s\nthoughts might have carried him there without spite. If he was thinking of T/ony:\n&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do this on my own, I wish there was someone here to help me. I wish my\npersonal hero, I/ron Man, was here. &lsquo;If&hellip;&rsquo; He took the suit away, so I&rsquo;m\nnothing. I don&rsquo;t even have a way to contact him.&rdquo; Without a &ldquo;wow, what a dick,\nI&rsquo;m gonna prove him wrong&rdquo; thrown in there, I can&rsquo;t see a way for that to lead\nto any inspiration to lift the warehouse. If he was thinking of the suit: &ldquo;God,\nI&rsquo;m trapped down here, I&rsquo;ve tried to lift this off, but I couldn&rsquo;t, and to top\nit off all I have is this useless suit, not even a phone, or an AI to comfort\nme the way the other one did. &lsquo;If&hellip;&rsquo; So, I can&rsquo;t lift these walls off me, which\nonly goes to show what T/ony already knew when he took the suit away: I&rsquo;m\nnothing without it. I lost.&rdquo; If he was thinking about himself being nothing: &ldquo;I\ncouldn&rsquo;t lift these walls, I really am nothing without that suit. &lsquo;If&hellip;&rsquo; Yeah,\nMr. St/ark, you were right to take it away.&rdquo; I mean, let&rsquo;s forget for a second\nthat the other suit probably wouldn&rsquo;t have helped him then. There&rsquo;s no relation\nbetween his current situation and the line except the suit and the theme of\nself-worth, and the line supports the lack of both. What I&rsquo;m trying to say here\nis that I can&rsquo;t see any way for that line to not only fit the situation, but to\nlead Peter to gain the strength (of will) to lift the walls. I mean, I could\nsee Peter 616 saving himself out of spite, maybe, but in that context that line\nis like a sore.]</p><p><br /></p><hr /><h2><br /></h2><h2>A CLEAR SET OF RULES:\nINCOMPLETE</h2><p>T/ony first gives Peter an\nextremely vague spectrum of which actions are acceptable and which aren&rsquo;t, and\nlater on gives Peter and order that, in the way it was presented, was anathema\nto what he believes, without explaining his reasoning. The rules, in T/ony&rsquo;s\nmind, seem to be there, but the only clear direction he gives Peter is to stay\naway from the weapons dealing.</p><p>In the car ride to Peter&rsquo;s\nhome, T/ony tells Peter, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t do anything I would do, and don&rsquo;t do anything I\nwouldn&rsquo;t do.&rdquo; While the audience might find that joke funny, Peter would only\nknow T/ony from what he&rsquo;s seen on the media, and that with parental guidance,\nsince he was eight at the most tumultuous, speaking from a PR perspective, part\nof T/ony&rsquo;s life. While some of us might hear that line and go, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the best\nadvice you could give a child&rdquo;, and we are the target of that line, Peter\ndoesn&rsquo;t know T/ony. He only knows him as I/ron Man and, maybe, as a genius\nengineer. Those directions are worthless to him further than the implied &ldquo;use\nyour common sense.&rdquo; Just so we&rsquo;re clear, I&rsquo;m not saying T/ony doesn&rsquo;t have that<sup>1</sup>,\njust that he&rsquo;s telling Peter to react in an appropriate manner to the situation\nwithout direction as to what an appropriate reaction would be.</p><p>Then comes Peter&rsquo;s first fight with the\nVulture, T/ony&rsquo;s second talk with Peter in the movie, and he tells him to stay\nout of it. He doesn&rsquo;t say he&rsquo;ll look into it, he doesn&rsquo;t tell him to go to the\nauthorities. He tells him not to look into the weapons dealing and, if he does\ncome across it again, to call Happy. Like I said before, if T/ony was\nreading/listening to Peter&rsquo;s messages, he probably had access to his and\nHappy&rsquo;s communications, so he knew Happy was lowing Peter off. Maybe he thought\nthat was alright because <i>he</i> was\ngetting the messages and he&rsquo;d know if there was trouble, but Peter didn&rsquo;t know\nthat. As I mentioned before, Peter doesn&rsquo;t feel like T/ony&rsquo;s reliable, so he\ndidn&rsquo;t trust T/ony had his best interests at heart or at least he didn&rsquo;t think\nhe knew what those were.</p><p>Furthermore, when he tried to argue against the\nrule, T/ony broke out the &ldquo;Because I said so!&rdquo; Which is the fallacy of appeal\nto authority. A lot of parents use it, which is why a lot of fans love the\nexchange and, I&rsquo;ll bet, why the scriptwriters included it, but it&rsquo;s worthless\nas a logical argument and sure to make most teenagers hurry to do the exact\nopposite of what you said, nevermind a teenager who already thinks you&rsquo;re\nwrong, that you&rsquo;ve failed him and sees you as an obstacle to his goals, even as\nhe sees you as the path to them.</p><p>However, I feel like I have to point out that,\nat least, T/ony doesn&rsquo;t create the rules thinking about himself, but about\nPeter. He was honestly trying to protect him.<sup>2</sup> I think he should get\ncredit for that.</p><p>[1: Although I certainly think so. 2: He&rsquo;s just\ninept.]</p><p><br /></p><hr /><h2><br /></h2><h2>RESPECT: FAIL</h2><p>T/ony consistently looks down on Peter. To be\nfair, most of the times he does this he&rsquo;s trying to make a joke, but his humor\nis, not only with Peter but with most people, condescending and disrespectful.</p><p>In CA:CW, while he compliments him on his\npowers and inventions, he does it as a power move. Maybe not intentionally, but\ncornering a teenager in his own room and one by one throwing all of his most\ndangerous secrets right in his face like you do it every Tuesday, even as the\nteenager in question gets progressively more agitated, only served to build\nhimself up and put Peter in the spot. Personally, I don&rsquo;t think that when T/ony\nmentions May he&rsquo;s implying he&rsquo;ll tell her about Spider-Man, but there&rsquo;s no\ndoubt that Peter is feeling like Damocles&rsquo; sword was giving him a very close\nshave. He was at a disadvantage, even if T/ony wouldn&rsquo;t press, even Peter\ndidn&rsquo;t think T/ony would press.</p><p>From Peter&rsquo;s video, we know that he didn&rsquo;t see\nor talk with T/ony at least until they gathered at the airport. T/ony told him\nwhat to do, gave him a tip on how to do it, convinced him not to listen to what\nCap said<sup>1</sup> and sent him off. No explanation given, he gave\ninformation on a need to know basis and didn&rsquo;t think Peter even needed to know\nthe real reason why they were fighting.</p><p>In the middle of all that, though, I missed a\nstep. He gave Peter the suit. At that particular moment, all that suit had\ngoing for itself were the new webshooters (they may look nicer, but we are\ngiven no reason to believe they are, with the training wheels protocol in\nplace, any better than the original), the (maybe) improved lenses and being\nmore stylish<sup>1</sup>. Meta textually, all it served was to give Spider-Man\nhis suit<sup>2</sup>. In the movie, all the purpose it could have served was,\nif we&rsquo;re being generous, T/ony wanting Peter to have something nice<sup>3 </sup>or\nnot wanting to be seen badly for bringing someone in rags and, if we&rsquo;re not, T/ony\npaying for a service.<sup>4</sup></p><p>In the car ride, he makes the joke about May.<sup>5</sup>\nA woman isn&rsquo;t relevant only in relation to the men in her life and a man is\nsupposed to understand that he doesn&rsquo;t control the women in his life and that\nthey are not a comment on himself. That said, T/ony was locker room talking\nPeter&rsquo;s mom. He not only passed him off to Happy, he told him that someone, not\nhim, would call him if they needed him. That was the last Peter heard of him\nfor two months. </p><p>Then comes the fight with the Vulture. That&rsquo;s\nthe first time Peter hears anything about his suit having a parachute, a tracer\nor a heater. After explaining the whole story to T/ony, he says they can take\nthe Vulture down and T/ony replies with &ldquo;taking him down now, huh? Crocket,\nthere are people who handle this sort of things.&rdquo; He condescendingly tells\nPeter that he&rsquo;ll be out of the case and when Peter asks if he&rsquo;ll be the one\nwho&rsquo;ll handle it, he says it&rsquo;s too unimportant. That&rsquo;s when he reveals he isn&rsquo;t\nthere with Peter but seemingly on vacation in India. From this point on, Peter\nstops trusting T/ony cares about him personally. The &ldquo;Because I said so!&rdquo; line\nmakes an obligatory appearance in this section, because he hasn&rsquo;t given Peter a\ngood reason not to go after the Vulture. We can guess from his outburst that\nhe&rsquo;s worried about him, but Peter can only hear his words and they&rsquo;re telling\nnot to do his job because he says so, and then he goes on to belittle his\nefforts in CW. He has plenty of reasons to believe T/ony sees him as nothing\nbut the kid he picked up and unfortunately got stuck to his hand. He goes on to\ntell Peter to stay with the small stuff and be &ldquo;friendly neighborhood\nSpider-Man&rdquo;.<sup>6</sup></p><p>He bribes him with easy entrance to MIT<sup>7</sup>\nand leaves instead of using that convenient moment to bring up the other things\nthe suit can do, since he won&rsquo;t be accessing to it until he&rsquo;s completed the\ntraining T/ony was apparently supposed to give him, and he hasn&rsquo;t even started\nyet, so it&rsquo;s not important, right?</p><p>Except Peter accesses to it and, if he wasn&rsquo;t\nannoyed by T/ony by then, the &ldquo;Training Wheels&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Baby Monitor&rdquo; protocol\nwould have finished the job. The first one, admittedly, isn&rsquo;t that bad in its\nname and not bad at all in its purpose, but it existed in the context of all\nthe other ways T/ony made Peter feel inadequate and like a kid. The Baby\nMonitor, on the other hand, was downright patronizing in its name and a breach\nof privacy that outdid the tracer in the suit.</p><p>Then, out of nowhere, T/ony calls him to\ncongratulate him (pointing out Peter&rsquo;s lie and ignoring the fact he clearly\ndoesn&rsquo;t want to talk to him, but then again, he probably programmed the AI to\nconnect his calls directly, so he never much cared about that) and inserts\nhimself in the role of a father to this kid he&rsquo;s talked to four times (this is\na manipulation from Marvel). At every point he disregards Peter&rsquo;s wishes, going\nso far as to tell him not to cut him off when Peter says he&rsquo;s in the middle of\nsomething. That call wasn&rsquo;t about Peter, it was about himself. </p><p>The mission goes sideways until T/ony gets\nthere and saves everyone. I&rsquo;m hesitant to include the &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ve done\nenough&rdquo; line since Peter did mess up and its delivery wasn&rsquo;t condescending so\nmuch as angry. </p><p>During their talk post-ferry, the talk is\npeppered with &ldquo;stereotypical parental lecture&rdquo; catchphrases, which is what fans\nwant to see, I assume, is why no one bothers to notice how inappropriate it is\nfor someone whose interactions with a kid can&rsquo;t amount to more than a day all\nput together to insert himself as a father figure in his life and then start\nwith methods such as constantly making reference to his authority as an adult\ninstead of making actual arguments. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fifteen&rdquo; may not have been the most\ndevastating of all smackdowns, but &ldquo;This is where you zip it! The adults are\ntalking&rdquo; is an immediate and absolute shut down of communication, because, even\nif the other person rebels against it and keeps talking, the &ldquo;adult&rdquo; already\nexpressed unwillingness to listen. And I&rsquo;ve talked about how he puts Peter in\nhis debt with his comment about others thinking he was crazy for recruiting a\n&ldquo;14&rdquo; year old (see how the age gap and so his superiority just grows), but here\nhe also makes it as though Peter was at fault for that for being young, while\nalso telling him how no one else believes in him, while <i>also</i> implying he doesn&rsquo;t believe in him anymore.<sup>8</sup></p><p>Then he takes the suit away. I think that was\nthe right choice. I mean, personally, I don&rsquo;t see how it was that much better\nthan his own suit beyond looking better and being better for the acrobatics\nhe&rsquo;s known for<sup>9</sup> until he hacks it, but he&rsquo;s not supposed to access\nto all the suit&rsquo;s capabilities anyway (again, something I agree with). It&rsquo;s\njust a toy, but one that enabled him to go against T/ony&rsquo;s orders and taking it\naway is the best way to punish him (if it was apart from the &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; issue)\nand keep him from repeating is actions. There&rsquo;s not much to criticize about his\nchoice to take the suit away &nbsp;(again,\nexcept for the conversation which gave that choice context) except maybe that,\nbecause that suit was the only thing that tied the two of them together, taking\nit away was basically giving up on the relationship, but I&rsquo;ve already explained\nthat the relationship was based on Peter admiring T/ony and what he\nrepresented, reaching out and lashing out when he perceived rejection and T/ony\nignoring Peter, so it&rsquo;s not much of a loss. There&rsquo;s especially nothing to\ncriticize in regards of T/ony disrespecting Peter.</p><p>Nothing, that is, except the clothes. It isn&rsquo;t\nonly humiliating and, if the writers had a bit of common sense, a sign for May\nthat something bad happened<sup>10</sup>, it&rsquo;s also petty and vindictive in a\nway that casts a bad light on the good parts of his lecture, which are already\nfew, because they don&rsquo;t seem to come from the right place, one of genuine\nintent to do right by Peter, but out of desire to take out his anger on him.<sup>11</sup></p><p>Their next interaction is when Peter &ldquo;has\nproven himself to T/ony&rdquo; and gets invited to the upstate facility. Without the\nslightest hesitation, a thought spared to whether Peter harbored any resentment\nfor the way he was treated (even if T/ony doesn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s done anything <i>wrong</i>, he has to know, because sometimes\nthat&rsquo;s what he was going for, that he upset Peter, as all people get upset when\nthey&rsquo;re lectured and punished), T/ony throws an arm over Peter&rsquo;s shoulders\nwelcomes him back and takes credit for motivating Peter, even though he went\nagainst T/ony&rsquo;s wishes, after a talk in which he was torn down for not doing as\nhe said. He paid so little mind to Peter himself that he planned the rest of\nhis life in advance for him, starting<sup>12</sup> right then, as soon as he\nsuited up, with dozens of reporters waiting to drill the fifteen year old whose\nonly exposure to attention greater than that of his class when he answered a\nteacher&rsquo;s question was at AcaDec. Then Peter rejects him and he lets him go,\nafter a quick &ldquo;look at me (I&rsquo;m the best thing that could ever happen to you).\nStill no? Okay, I&rsquo;ll take this in a dignified way since you&rsquo;re so adorable. I\nmean, look at it! It&rsquo;s so smart, it&rsquo;s almost like it understands what you&rsquo;re\nsaying!&rdquo; That may seem like I&rsquo;m being mean-spirited, but with the billionaire\nsaying he digs the &ldquo;working-class hero vibe&rdquo;?<sup>13</sup> It&rsquo;s not. </p><p>I repeat, most of T/ony&rsquo;s moments of\ncondescendence are either jokes or T/ony&rsquo;s/RDJ&rsquo;s way of carrying himself that\nmight make mostly innocuous comments offensive or probably his way of lashing\nout when he&rsquo;s angry or upset. It&rsquo;s not planned or out of maliciousness, just\nthoughtlessness. If it wasn&rsquo;t, he probably would have told Peter that it wasn&rsquo;t\na test when he asked<sup>14</sup>, to manipulate him, maybe guilt him into\nagreeing. That doesn&rsquo;t change their effect.</p><p>[1: Afraid he&rsquo;ll agree? 2: Stop making every\nclassic Spider-Man thing about T/ony. 3: How convenient that T/ony knew exactly\neverything that Peter needed and put it in the suit even before meeting and\ntalking to him or that he had time to add it while planning for the fight,\nbefore he got to his hotel room. 3: This explains why he&rsquo;s so comfortable just\ndropping him then picking him up whenever it suits him, and also it makes sense\nas an investment. Pay your workers well and reap the benefits of their\nwellbeing and the skills they develop while/by working for you. 5: Why do I\nhave to go through this with everyone but Peter? I&rsquo;d say every man, but I\nwouldn0t know, since May only appears on screen to show what a cool mom she is\nto his nephew and to be slobbered over by men, they deleted the one scene where\nshe could have been shown as her own person and as someone who raised the boy\nwho&rsquo;d become Spider-Man because hey <i>why\nwould I bother showing that when I could point out how hot Aunt May who&rsquo;s\ninitially characterized by being ill and a bit doddering but <b>who pushes through that and her grief over\nthe loss of her husband(s) with her immense strength of will and inspired by\nher caring for her boy just as he pushes through the grief of life with his\nimmense strength of will probably learned from her and inspired by his caring\nfor his mom/aunt/and uncle/dad.</b></i> 6: Stahhhhp. 7: Let him go to ESU, you\ncowards. (I literally just remembered T/ony went to MIT. First, wow, another\nparallel, much surprised. Second, a good chance to set him apart from T/ony and\nlet him be his own person, as many fans who disagree with Peter having a mentor\nbut like their relationship have say is probably what&rsquo;s going to happen. Third,\nyou&rsquo;re taking ESU disaster student Peter Parker from my cold, dead hands and\ntrigger the curse of the mummy so I&rsquo;ll come back to life, take it back and beat\nyou on the head with it. 8: The more I think about that scene the hotter my\nblood boils. 9: Except in the MCU because who cares about anything but\nstrength? Oh, yeah, and sticky fingers. 10: Her teenager disappeared from school\nat a point in his life where he&rsquo;s making a lot of bad decisions all of a sudden\nand he comes back home in tears and thrown together clothes? Listen, I&rsquo;m not\nfrom New York, I don&rsquo;t know exactly how bad crime is over there, but that&rsquo;s\nsure to raise a red alert in anyone, right? 11: I didn&rsquo;t recognize that shirt\nas Pepper&rsquo;s when I watched the movie, and I don&rsquo;t think we were meant to. I\nthink we were just supposed to think he went ahead and bought the most\nembarrassing outfit he could find, so I&rsquo;m not including that in the main body.\n12: with a nice fuck you to May, but I&rsquo;m used to the scriptwriters&rsquo; attitude\ntowards her by now. 13: To Spider-Man, who, even though they didn&rsquo;t bother to\nestablish the Parkers as struggling with money (beyond Peter dumpster diving)\nand, really, given the times and May&rsquo;s youth still wouldn&rsquo;t lead to Peter\nworking as a teenager and having a lot of his problems/anxieties revolving\naround money, is still a character who&rsquo;s characterized by <i>a lot of his problems/anxieties revolving around money</i>? 14: Also,\nnice way of destroying the only development you gave to the character that\ndidn&rsquo;t require you to get rid of the other things you&rsquo;ve established in the\nprevious movie. He wants to look after the little guy? Now he just wants to be an\nAvenger. He was clever, made his own computers and equipment and came up with\nplans/strategized? Now he lacks common sense and he&rsquo;s only smart academically\nand because people say so. He was able to go toe-to-toe with Avengers? Now he&rsquo;s\njust plain incompetent and can&rsquo;t even swing. He cared enough about school that\nhe wouldn&rsquo;t just eff off to Germany, even if T/ony St/ark asked? Now he&rsquo;s just\nwaiting for the call and ready to drop out and move upstate. And then when he&rsquo;s\nfinally getting his priorities straight, he ruins it and asks if it was a test.\nDo you just throw shit at a wall and hope it sticks or did you actually plan to\ngive him character development but got scared that something would go wrong and\nplayed it down?]</p><p><br /></p><hr /><h2><br /></h2><h2>FAIR FEEDBACK: INCOMPLETE</h2><p>On my count, T/ony shows Peter a reaction to\nhis actions five times. Of those, two of them are exaggerated and one is\ncomplicated, as I will explain shortly.</p><p>The first two, will be analyzed together due to\ntheir similarity<sup>1</sup>, are in CA:CW, in the bedroom scene, and in the\ncar scene in Homecoming. Although, as I&rsquo;ve explained, there are problems with\nthe context of that praise, it&rsquo;s honest and an appropriate response when you\nthink someone&rsquo;s skilled. A simple &ldquo;this is good work&rdquo;, just like in the car\nscene. That time, he&rsquo;s technically talking to May about Peter&rsquo;s (fictitious)\nwork at the retreat, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a stretch to say it&rsquo;s meant for\nPeter.</p><p>The third feedback moment, the complicated one,\nis the phone call right before the ferry accident. I say it&rsquo;s complicated\nbecause, in the context of everything else we&rsquo;ve seen before in the movie, that\nwas out of character and mostly for plot convenience. Despite that, what we get\nto hear shows it would have been &ldquo;fair feedback&rdquo;, at least given what T/ony\nknows, and possibly a turning point for their relationship that might have led\nto a good mentorship, if it hadn&rsquo;t come at that particular moment. He calls\nafter hearing about him saving his friends at Washington and mentions &ldquo;great\nthings to come, which we can assume means the training which would have led to\nmore frequent<sup>2</sup> interaction and communication which would probably\nhave solved most of the problems I&rsquo;ve pointed out. However, from an objective\npoint of view, that feedback wasn&rsquo;t fair, since the Washington incident was\nPeter&rsquo;s fault. He was the one who brought the Chitauri energy core and left it\nwith his non-powered friend after just picking it off the streets and\nirresponsibly not telling the police or anyone who could deal with it better\nthan him (except T/ony) and carrying it around on him. Those actions deserved\npunishment. He also used it to disobey T/ony&rsquo;s orders and investigate the\nVulture&rsquo;s operations. If he had had this information, T/ony most likely\nwouldn&rsquo;t have congratulated him. Peter, by not giving him all the information,\nprevented him from performing his duties as a mentor correctly, but this\nhappened because T/ony failed to provide him with a sense of reliability and\nalienating him by not respecting him. This leaves us, for the purposes of this\nsection, with a situation in which T/ony doesn&rsquo;t actually give Peter fair\nfeedback, but it isn&rsquo;t completely his fault.</p><p>The fourth time is the post-ferry lecture. In\nthis case, he was right to choose to punish Peter, but wrong in the delivery of\nthat punishment. I&rsquo;ve explained everything that bothers me about this scene: T/ony\nis condescending in how he says things; his chastisement is based around Peter\nnot listening to him instead of the things he actually did wrong and led to him\nendangering people, among which are being too eager to please him and his whole\ninvolvement with the Chitauri energy core, which didn&rsquo;t actually affect the\noutcome of the ferry accident; his whole lecture does more harm than good.\nThen, by taking away the suit, he ends the relationship with Peter. That&rsquo;s his\nreaction to, to his knowledge, Peter&rsquo;s first strike. Instead of trying to fix\nthings, he just discards him. Maybe he planned to give it back, but that would\nmake the threat intentionally manipulative, which would be even worse.</p><p>The fifth time is at the upstate facility\nwhere, after Peter did everything he told him not to, again, which he punished\nhim for before, he praises him<sup>3</sup> and offers to make him an Avenger<sup>4</sup>.\nPeter does what he was punished for doing before, which includes endangering people\nthe same way he did at the ferry (he showed up to fight crime, things went\nsideways and he tried to fix it. The only difference is that he needed help in\nthe ferry while both the plane and the beach were miraculously empty), only he\nsucceeds this time, and T/ony&rsquo;s reaction is to give him everything he wants.\nI&rsquo;m not saying Peter doesn&rsquo;t deserve reward, I&rsquo;m saying that T/ony&rsquo;s is over\nthe top, not only because he doesn&rsquo;t deserve it, but also because it would end\nup being bad for him. The Avengers are the Big Leagues and he&rsquo;s not ready for\nit.<sup>5</sup> Even if they took the time to train him, he&rsquo;d have to upend his\nlife as Peter Parker, even if he didn&rsquo;t reveal his identity.<sup>6</sup> He&rsquo;d\nhave to drop out, and tell his Aunt at the very least, since her life would be\nupended, too. He&rsquo;s not getting what he thinks he&rsquo;s buying since the Avengers at\nthat point are not the idealized elite who saved him and all the world when he\nwas eight, but just T/ony, Vision and a disabled and probably still recovering\nRhodey, who are bound by the Accords and now completely beholden to the UN. If\nyou&rsquo;re doing Peter Parker right, he&rsquo;ll never agree to only acting when he&rsquo;s\nallowed, or doing something he thinks is wrong. They got this right in the\nmovie by making him go against T/ony even though he&rsquo;s his hero. If it&rsquo;s true\nthat T/ony told people that he recruited a teenager and they were judgmental,\nhe&rsquo;ll be exposed to that skepticism.<sup>7</sup> He&rsquo;ll be (immediately) exposed\nto the media&rsquo;s scrutiny as the new Avenger, and the one that came after Civil\nWar. </p><p>What I&rsquo;m trying to say with all this is that\nonce again T/ony&rsquo;s reaction is over-the-top and inappropriate. He also gives\nPeter the wrong message: succeed and I&rsquo;ll give you the world; fail and I&rsquo;ll\ntake it away. There is also the small uncomfortable matter that, while this may\nnot have held weight in his decision, Peter&rsquo;s success was closely tied with\ndoing T/ony a favor by saving his plane. It wasn&rsquo;t the point, but it goes to\nshow that constantly trying to make everything about T/ony has its downsides.</p><p>[1:and because all I have to say about each of\nthem is &ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t fuck up here&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s hardly paragraph worthy. 2: As if\nthat was hard, they were at rock bottom at &ldquo;never&rdquo;. 3: And claims credit for\nPeter&rsquo;s success stop claiming credit for Peter&rsquo;s success ffs. 4: As the\nAvengers stand at that point. 5: I&rsquo;ve said it once and I&rsquo;ll say it again, he&rsquo;s\nplain incompetent. 6: Spider-Man would be the best hero to use to show the\neffects of the Accords, since he&rsquo;d be screwed over without prep or lube by\nthem, but Marvel didn&rsquo;t intend to take that anywhere, which shows even in Civil\nWar, since most of the movie and for most of the characters it isn&rsquo;t about them\nanyway. 7: And he won&rsquo;t be able to prove them wrong.]</p><p><br /></p><hr /><h2><br /></h2><h2>AID: COMPROMISED / DISTANCE: FAIL</h2><p>So, you thought I&rsquo;d be nice to the\nrelationship/T/ony St/ark. </p><p>As I said before, T/ony provides a lot of aid.\nHe takes care that the suit &ldquo;suits&rdquo; Peter<sup>1</sup>: it has the lenses to\nprevent overwhelming his senses, the new webshooters, it fits his acrobatic\nlifestyle better<sup>2</sup>, it has tracers he can use knowingly and\napparently some other functions which activate automatically in case of\nemergency if Peter can&rsquo;t do it himself.<sup>3</sup></p><p>Furthermore, it has some kind of devise to warn\nhim if Peter&rsquo;s in some trouble the suit can detect (although it does depend on\nInternet connection) and, when he gets that warning, T/ony wastes no time to\nget a suit to save him, just as he goes running when he figures out Peter&rsquo;s on\nthe ferry, where he knows a deal&rsquo;s about to go through. Then, he offers Peter a\nhome at the facility, a place on the Avengers, the Iron Spider suit and a\nfather figure in himself.<sup>4</sup></p><p>All in all, when Peter&rsquo;s on T/ony&rsquo;s good\ngraces, he holds the world upon a string.<sup>5</sup> He&rsquo;s provided with aid in\nspades. When it comes to actions of aid, I can&rsquo;t complain at all. The only\ntimes when he didn&rsquo;t come to Peter&rsquo;s rescue in the movie were when it would\nmake sense because he wasn&rsquo;t keeping tabs anymore and the movie actually\nrequired his absence. It&rsquo;s the material aid that, perhaps unfairly, I&rsquo;ll admit,\nI&rsquo;m not happy with. The problem is that he doesn&rsquo;t manage well the distance I\ntalked about in the introduction.</p><p>In every other way, he&rsquo;s too distant. This\ndistance means that his attempts at material aid backfire, because he&rsquo;s not\nthere to ensure the correct use of the equipment. Therefore, Peter first\nendangers himself by using the suit&rsquo;s extra abilities because he doesn&rsquo;t\nunderstand them and later uses them to go against T/ony&rsquo;s wishes. In addition\nto give Peter this space to reject him, his distance also causes it by breeding\nresentment or/and disconnect on Peter&rsquo;s side. </p><p>On the other hand, the moments and ways in\nwhich he&rsquo;s present he&rsquo;s overbearing. Physically and emotionally, he goes from\nignoring Peter to taking the opportunity of saving him to set down rules that\ngo against what Peter believes in and which, because of that, will be difficult\nto follow since the trouble he&rsquo;s supposed to avoid is happening right before\nhis eyes. Then he calls before the ferry incident, sets himself up as Peter&rsquo;s\nfather figure (by referencing his own father and saying he&rsquo;ll succeed where he\nfailed) and is about to tell Peter that he&rsquo;s going to start training him. Note\nthat I say &ldquo;tell that&rdquo; and not some other, more unassertive words like\n&ldquo;suggest&rdquo; or &ldquo;offer&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s for a reason. In the call, T/ony constantly wrestles\nfor control of the conversation, and from Peter. Without a by-your leave, he\ndecides he&rsquo;s going to try to parent Peter. That&rsquo;s the basis of all their\ninteractions, T/ony trying to move Peter to where he wants him, Peter resisting\nand T/ony dragging him or leaning on him to make him comply, with oftentimes\npoor results. </p><p>Other way in which he&rsquo;s not giving room for\nPeter to be himself is by giving him the suit as it was. Remember when I\nmentioned that I&rsquo;d use the comics to support my claims? Here it is. Putting\naside the fact that Peter himself made the suit (the movie is apparently based\non Ultimate Spider-Man<sup>6</sup>, and they already changed it so it would be\nMary Jane who made him the suit instead there), a good example for what I&rsquo;m\nsaying is the spider-tracers. The original, 616 Peter Parker very early on made\nthe spider tracers, simple spider-shaped devices that allowed him to track\npeople, first with a receiver and later he programs them so he can find them\nwith his spider-sense.<sup>7</sup> You might remember a spider-like tracer in\nthe movie. T/ony gave it to him and both it and the &ldquo;receiver&rdquo; are a hundred\ntimes more advanced than the ones Peter uses in the comics. Thus, he has no\nreason to keep working on it and will probably never figure out how to tap into\nhis spider-sense&rsquo;s frequency. The webshooters come with hundreds of different\ncombinations programmed into them, so he has no reason to tinker with them. He\nhas no reason to develop his skills at all because it&rsquo;s all been handed to him.\nAnd it&rsquo;s not like Peter wants to be a poet; he has both talent and interest in\nscience but no reason to work on it. T/ony himself commented that his work was\nimpressive. He said Peter in general, his skills, his powers, his morals, was\ngreat, but then the first thing he did was limit him and then try to shape him\ninto something that fit him better, like someone who&rsquo;d ignore trouble, someone\nwho he saw as eventually going to want to use an Instant Kill Mode. </p><p>I&rsquo;ve talked about the how, but here&rsquo;s why the\nmentorship fails. T/ony is, at once, too distant and too overbearing.</p><p>He sees potential in Peter and so he invests in\nhim with the suit, and takes measures to protect that investment by putting\neverything he thinks will help him survive in it. This means he has a very set\npath he wants Peter to follow and to that end put bumpers on the sides. Peter\ncould get rid of them and do his own thing, but they make life easier and so he\ndoesn&rsquo;t even need to learn how to aim because he has the bumpers to fall back\non. The moment Peter decides to try it anyway, T/ony shows no hesitation in\ncutting him loose and taking his investment back, though. And why wouldn&rsquo;t he,\nif T/ony doesn&rsquo;t tell him the rules of the game and won&rsquo;t even play with him?</p><p>No, I don&rsquo;t think T/ony does it on purpose. I\nthink he does care about Peter. But if he&rsquo;s a dad, he&rsquo;s one of those rich ones\nwho don&rsquo;t make time for their kids and try to make up for it by buying them\nexpensive gifts that they may or may not want and justify it by saying they&rsquo;re\njust making sure they have a good future, even though their kids don&rsquo;t want to\nwork on their law firm. </p><p>[1: As I said before, it&rsquo;s weird, and by weird\nI mean eye-rollingly-convenient, just how well T/ony could predict the needs of\nsomeone he hadn&rsquo;t even met. 2: Toight. 3: Which is useful since Peter doesn&rsquo;t\nknow about them. 4: Don&rsquo;t get up in my face, I never said T/ony didn&rsquo;t care\nabout Peter or might be open to a father/son relationship with him, only that\nhe sucks at it. 5: I&rsquo;ve already talked about what happens when he isn&rsquo;t, but\nmentioning that in the main body is just being petty at this point. 6: In ways\nthey wouldn&rsquo;t like to admit. 7: Some people take a page out of Bruce Wayne&rsquo;s\nbook a prefix part of their name to everything to cope and that&rsquo;s valid.]</p><hr /><h2><br /></h2><h2>CONCLUSION</h2><p>If the father/son relationship between Peter\nand T/ony doesn&rsquo;t exist. The scriptwriters used certain cues that are widely\nassociated with parents reacting to their kids or blatantly compared T/ony to\nhis father in how he acted towards Peter, implying he was filling the same\nrole. Their interactions, though, are minimal and most plain conflictive, while\nalmost all had problematic undertones and context, even when the characters had\nthe best intentions. T/ony fails to communicate with Peter and so he fails him\nin almost every aspect, and by the time he gets his act together, Peter, while\nstill admiring him and wanting his attention and to be an Avenger, has rejected\nhis authority both because he doesn&rsquo;t trust it and because accepting it would\nmean going against his own beliefs and wishes. Since Peter meets with failure, T/ony\ncan&rsquo;t tolerate the challenge and doesn&rsquo;t see any reason to compromise and so cuts\nPeter off, claiming that it will be permanent. After Peter succeeds, T/ony\nwelcomes him back without any of them addressing the issues that had set them\napart before and tries to impose his way again by giving him everything he\nwanted, but Peter rejects him. They go their own ways, understanding that Peter\nwill be his own person, and with this understanding also setting the groundwork\nfor a better, functional relationship. </p><p>Fans, as it is their right, created a very\ndifferent relationship following the cues and the emotional manipulation used\nin the movie. Marvel profits from it without having had to actually put effort\ninto the relationship. </p><p>It should be pointed out that any mentorship\nrelationship involving a teenage hero will always be problematic since the\nmentor will be complicit at best and completely to blame at most for child\nendangerment. Marvel realized this 60 years ago and, if my memory serves, until\nmodern times no teenage hero has had a mentor or operated in a team, with\nteam-ups being the exception, since Johnny Storm (and the rest of the FF\nfamily). This trend was started \n\nand popularized\n\nby <i>Spider-Man</i>.&nbsp;</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>Disclaimer: Some of the probably tiny amount of\nreaders this is gonna get are probably asking themselves, &ldquo;What? Failed? Bitch,\nwhere? T/ony and Peter are <i>the</i>\nfather/son duo.&rdquo; Answer: in reality, objectively. I used to be a fan of the\ndynamic, because I love both Peter Parker and the &ldquo;found family&rdquo; trope, but\nI&rsquo;ve given the matter a lot of thought (that&rsquo;s actually the reason I&rsquo;m sitting\ndown to write it; I&rsquo;m hoping to put it in words to put it out of my thoughts)\nand I&rsquo;m calling them how I see them.<br /></p>\n<p>Fair warning: To/ny stans, if they don&rsquo;t want\nto get upset, shouldn&rsquo;t read this. It won&rsquo;t be bashing him, I&rsquo;ll be trying to\nbe fair, but it will be critical of him. You shouldn&rsquo;t see this, since I&rsquo;m\ntagging it accordingly, but maybe a Spider-Man fan who also likes T/ony, is new\nto the fandom and hasn&rsquo;t blacklisted &ldquo;anti T/ony st/ark&rdquo; might find it. </p>\n<p>Also, I might be slightly biased because of\nwhat I know from the Spider-Man comics, which I&rsquo;m in the process of reading\nnow, but of which I knew very little when I first thought of this. I will be\nbringing up those few things that I knew, not because I think that the movie\nshould be absolutely identical to it, but because it&rsquo;s actually relevant to the\nargument. (Although from what I&rsquo;ve seen in the comics and what I&rsquo;ve read from\npeople who know better than me, there is plenty of reason to be offended by the\nmovie and it&rsquo;s &ldquo;accuracy&rdquo; that has nothing to do with gate-keeping nitpicking.)</p>\n<p>Last, I&rsquo;ll be adding slightly off-topic\nopinions between [these]. I won&rsquo;t start talking about Black Panther, but they&rsquo;ll\nbe subjective comments (right or wrong) and won&rsquo;t have much to do with the\nactual argument. Don&rsquo;t want to read the, don&rsquo;t read them; if you disagree, you\ndisagree. It&rsquo;s your opinion and you can do what you want just like this is my\npost and I do what I want, but, like I said, the actual argument will be\nseparate from them, so it should be read accordingly. (No saying my argument is\nwrong because I prefer Seven Up over Sprite.) </p>\n<p>Now, to the actual thing.</p>\n</p>",
