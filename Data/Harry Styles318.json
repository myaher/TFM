You hated when there was a meeting with all the Handmaids and Aunt Lydia, since it normally meant that somebody had committed a crime and you would have to punish them. It was part of what you did, and you hated it, you hated your vagina for working so perfectly and you hated how you got caught and now spend your days with the Knight family. </p><p>The man had raped the girl in his house, and, apparently, the only people that can rape the Handmaids were the men of the house, so he was sentenced to death by physical abuse. You followed the girls who circled around him and watched as they started to hit him. You pretended to throw a few punches and kick but you didn\u2019t actually touch him. You stayed your distance and left the other girls to do so. </p><p>\u201cThank you, girls, you may now leave,\u201d Aunt Lydia spoke, her glare fixed onto all the girls as they left. </p><p>You found your partner, a very quite girl called Ofnick, but, you two were the perfect  pair because the two of you didn\u2019t speak much. You greeted each other, you walked, you left. That\u2019s all you two do together, but, if your honest, you can\u2019t wait to leave her and be alone. But you\u2019re never really alone in this place. </p><p>You walk into the house, take your robe and hat off and walking into the kitchen where Florence the maid was making your lunch and Harry was sat eating his lunch, \u201cBlessed be the fruit.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMay the lord open,\u201d Florence says whilst Harry nods his head in your direction. Completely professional.</p><p>Everybody spoils you on this day, since it\u2019s the ceremony, the whole reason that you\u2019re here being a handmaid is because of today, and hopefully the life you will possess because of it. Harry can\u2019t look you in the eye on the day of the ceremony, and you get why, but sometimes it hurts. You need him on these days and he can\u2019t even look you in the eye. </p><p>The second you sit down and start to eat, Harry passes his plate to Florence and leaves. You don\u2019t let it show, but it hurts, so to mask it, you try to eat as much of the food as possibly before going upstairs. Mrs Knight makes it clear that she wants everything perfect on the night of the ceremony and that includes you taking a special bath, with the sweet scented shower gels and shampoos. </p><p>The door to the bathroom doesn\u2019t have a lock, and it\u2019s not like you can take a bath naked, and if you\u2019re honest, everybody in the house has seen you naked apart from Florence. There\u2019s no privacy when you\u2019re a Handmaid, you do what you do and you let everybody else have reigns on your life. The bath is supposed to be relaxing, but it\u2019s not. Not on ceremony day. </p><p>The day goes by way too quick and before you know it, you knelt on the floor, with Florence and Harry stood behind you, and Mrs Knight sat smoking a cigarette in the chair in front of you. Mr Knight had to knock before he could enter the room, and once he entered, the ceremony would start. You would have to kneel there, with Harry stood behind you, and listen to Mr Knights voice as he reads from the ceremony book. </p><p>Next, Florence and Harry leave and the three of you upstairs. Your body rests in between Mrs Knight\u2019s legs whilst Mr Knight prepares. Then he comes, and he touches you. You still feel his touch way after it\u2019s done, and you still feel him inside of you, but you just ignore it. You know this what you have to do, and you get on with it, no matter how much you don\u2019t want him to. </p><p>You leave the room and immediately go and try to wash yourself a billion times, you know it doesn\u2019t work but it gives you a sense of cleanliness. You hear Mr Knight go to his office and you know that Mrs Knight has gone to bed. You carefully sneak out of bed and walk down the stairs, avoiding the creaky steps and making sure to be as quiet as possible when opening and closing the front door. </p><p>You walk up the steps to Harry\u2019s loft and knock on the door. The second he looks at you, he grasps your arm and pulls you into a hug. He pulls you in the loft, closes the door and pushes your face into his chest. His hands wrap around your shoulders and yours wrap around his waist. His hand moves to the back of your head and he runs his fingers through my hair. </p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d He asks, his voice quiet and worried. You nod your head into his chest and try and push yourself further into it. He places a kiss to the top of your head and pulls away, but grabs your hand and pulls you onto his bed, \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, baby, we\u2019re nearly ready to leave. It won\u2019t take much longer.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to do this anymore, H,\u201d You say, your head resting in his lap as his hands running through your hair. </p><p>\u201cIts Okay, you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Harry says, his voice louder and more certain, \u201cYou\u2019ll be in Canada in a week, max, and I\u2019ll be there next to you.\u201d </p><p>The next day, people avoid you like the plague, the ceremony is over meaning that they just want you to have a bun in the oven so you can bake it, give it to them, and move on to the next family. You don\u2019t want this to happen, but there\u2019s nothing you can do. Not until Harry gets you away from here in the next week. He promised he would when you first hooked up, he told you he was part of a secret system that could get you both out and both into Canada safely. </p><p>Ofnick was waiting for you outside the gate when you walked out this morning. You walked with your head down but you could feel Harry\u2019s green stare coming from the window of his loft. You couldn\u2019t look up at him but you knew he was there, and he knew exactly what you were thinking.</p><p>You and Ofnick then slowly walk down the street, towards the supermarket. That\u2019s another job as Handmaid, when your family require something from the shop, you go and you get it, using your tokens. The two of you greet each other and don\u2019t talk for the rest of the time together. People don\u2019t even talk to you when you get there because you\u2019re the odd girl that doesn\u2019t talk to anyone. You don\u2019t think you\u2019ve spoken another word to a Handmaid that isn\u2019t Ofnick before. </p><p>Ofnick leaves and says she\u2019s going to the fishmonger so you walk over to the butcher. Mrs Knight said that she had asked for them to put a piece of meat aside and she made sure that you had enough tokens to get it. You walk up the butcher greats you with a smile, and you say your families name and he gives you a weird look. </p><p>\u201cWe have two things for you,\u201d He says, putting the two parcels on the counter in front of you, \u201cThe first ones just for you.\u201d</p><p>You pass him the needed tokens before grabbing both the parcels and holding them in your hands. You tell Ofnick that you\u2019ll wait for her outside and you stuff the parcel that\u2019s not meat under your dress. You then walk home, with the other parcel sticking into you the whole way home. </p><p>That night, you make your way over to Harry\u2019s, with the parcel in hand. He lets you in and you sit one the bed with the parcel and you open it together. It was a set of housewives clothes and two tickets to get through the border of Canada. You feel happy, and you can see the happiness on Harry\u2019s face as well. </p><p>He leans over and kisses you on the lips, his hands on either side of your face as he pushes his lips into yours at a happy rhythm, the first time the two of you have felt happy and safe with each other, knowing that you will be leaving to Canada. </p><p>You pull yourself up and sit on Harry\u2019s lap, your lips still touching and your bodies on fire. The heat and passion from the first time you two did this is still there, and you couldn\u2019t wait for it to happen again. Your hands started to mess with the bottom of his shirt, your fingers messing with the hem. He lifts his arms up and you pull his shirt over his head, his hands immediately resting back on your face and your lips reconnecting. </p><p>He messes with the back of your dress and his fingers somehow manage to skilfully get the horrible material off you, leaving you in the even worse undergarments. You mess with the buckle of Harry\u2019s belt and he stands up to take his trousers off. You lay back on the bed and Harry lays over you, his hands running up and down the outside of your thighs as you kiss again. </p><p>You hope you can be like this forever when you go to Canada. Not worrying about whether you\u2019re going to be caught, or whether you\u2019re carrying another mans baby, it\u2019s just you and him. His hands rake up and down your sides, pulling the underdress up and over your head, leaving you in your bra and panties. </p><p>His hands curl around your back and unhook your bra, and he throws it over the room somewhere. His lips run down your neck and attach to your nipple. Sinful noises leave your mouth and you can\u2019t help but clench your thighs together. Harry\u2019s lips carry on further down until he kisses your clit over your panties. </p><p>His fingers wrap around the material and pull them down your legs, his lips attaching directly onto the your clit afterwards. His tongue flicks over it and you can\u2019t hold the noises back any longer, and Harry groans against you, causing your breath to catch and pleasure racking up in your body. </p><p>\u201cLovely, you okay?\u201d He asks, pulling away from you and looking up, with his green eyes and a loving smile on his fine. </p><p>\u201cI just want you to fuck me,\u201d You said, your voice breathless, \u201cPlease.\u201d </p><p>He nodded his head and crawled up again, leaning over you and pressing and loving kiss to your cheek before pulling his boxers down and lining himself up with your entrance. He pushes in slowly and your lips only disconnect for him to start sucking on your collar bone, a breathless moan leaving your mouth. </p><p>It\u2019s times like these where you\u2019re happy, you don\u2019t have the constant looming of the guards or the Knights over you, it\u2019s just you and Harry. The man you love with all of your heart. </p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d You say, your voice quiet but there and Harry carries on pushing into you but with a smile on your face. </p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d He says, pushing in at a fast speed. </p><p>You come first, your whole body going rigid and the pleasure just runs through your body and Harry comes after, a low groan escaping his mouth as he collapsed into your neck. </p><p>The next day, you and Harry plan to leave in the night. You would go when Mrs Knight is asleep and Mr Knight is in his office. You know that it\u2019s risky, but once you\u2019ve escaped, you\u2019ll be free, you\u2019ll hopefully find people that you used to know - alive - and you\u2019ll live. </p><p>You go to Harry\u2019s loft when the times right and you changed into the outfit, a cloak wrapped around you as well. Harry was going to drive you pass the guards and towards a \u2018meeting\u2019 near the border, with your pretending to be Mrs Knight, you hoped more than anything that it would work. </p><p>It needed to work.</p>",

Mrs Knight makes it clear that she wants everything perfect on the night of the ceremony and that includes you taking a special bath, with the sweet scented shower gels and shampoos. </p><p>The door to the bathroom doesn\u2019t have a lock, and it\u2019s not like you can take a bath naked, and if you\u2019re honest, everybody in the house has seen you naked apart from Florence. There\u2019s no privacy when you\u2019re a Handmaid, you do what you do and you let everybody else have reigns on your life. The bath is supposed to be relaxing, but it\u2019s not. Not on ceremony day. </p><p>The day goes by way too quick and before you know it, you knelt on the floor, with Florence and Harry stood behind you, and Mrs Knight sat smoking a cigarette in the chair in front of you. Mr Knight had to knock before he could enter the room, and once he entered, the ceremony would start. You would have to kneel there, with Harry stood behind you, and listen to Mr Knights voice as he reads from the ceremony book. </p><p>Next, Florence and Harry leave and the three of you upstairs. Your body rests in between Mrs Knight\u2019s legs whilst Mr Knight prepares. Then he comes, and he touches you. You still feel his touch way after it\u2019s done, and you still feel him inside of you, but you just ignore it. You know this what you have to do, and you get on with it, no matter how much you don\u2019t want him to. </p><p>You leave the room and immediately go and try to wash yourself a billion times, you know it doesn\u2019t work but it gives you a sense of cleanliness. You hear Mr Knight go to his office and you know that Mrs Knight has gone to bed. You carefully sneak out of bed and walk down the stairs, avoiding the creaky steps and making sure to be as quiet as possible when opening and closing the front door. </p><p>You walk up the steps to Harry\u2019s loft and knock on the door. The second he looks at you, he grasps your arm and pulls you into a hug. He pulls you in the loft, closes the door and pushes your face into his chest. His hands wrap around your shoulders and yours wrap around his waist. His hand moves to the back of your head and he runs his fingers through my hair. </p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d He asks, his voice quiet and worried. You nod your head into his chest and try and push yourself further into it. He places a kiss to the top of your head and pulls away, but grabs your hand and pulls you onto his bed, \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, baby, we\u2019re nearly ready to leave. It won\u2019t take much longer.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to do this anymore, H,\u201d You say, your head resting in his lap as his hands running through your hair. </p><p>\u201cIts Okay, you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Harry says, his voice louder and more certain, \u201cYou\u2019ll be in Canada in a week, max, and I\u2019ll be there next to you.\u201d </p><p>The next day, people avoid you like the plague, the ceremony is over meaning that they just want you to have a bun in the oven so you can bake it, give it to them, and move on to the next family. You don\u2019t want this to happen, but there\u2019s nothing you can do. Not until Harry gets you away from here in the next week. He promised he would when you first hooked up, he told you he was part of a secret system that could get you both out and both into Canada safely. </p><p>Ofnick was waiting for you outside the gate when you walked out this morning. You walked with your head down but you could feel Harry\u2019s green stare coming from the window of his loft. You couldn\u2019t look up at him but you knew he was there, and he knew exactly what you were thinking.</p><p>You and Ofnick then slowly walk down the street, towards the supermarket. That\u2019s another job as Handmaid, when your family require something from the shop, you go and you get it, using your tokens. The two of you greet each other and don\u2019t talk for the rest of the time together. People don\u2019t even talk to you when you get there because you\u2019re the odd girl that doesn\u2019t talk to anyone. You don\u2019t think you\u2019ve spoken another word to a Handmaid that isn\u2019t Ofnick before. </p><p>Ofnick leaves and says she\u2019s going to the fishmonger so you walk over to the butcher. Mrs Knight said that she had asked for them to put a piece of meat aside and she made sure that you had enough tokens to get it. You walk up the butcher greats you with a smile, and you say your families name and he gives you a weird look. </p><p>\u201cWe have two things for you,\u201d He says, putting the two parcels on the counter in front of you, \u201cThe first ones just for you.\u201d</p><p>You pass him the needed tokens before grabbing both the parcels and holding them in your hands. You tell Ofnick that you\u2019ll wait for her outside and you stuff the parcel that\u2019s not meat under your dress. You then walk home, with the other parcel sticking into you the whole way home. </p><p>That night, you make your way over to Harry\u2019s, with the parcel in hand. He lets you in and you sit one the bed with the parcel and you open it together. It was a set of housewives clothes and two tickets to get through the border of Canada. You feel happy, and you can see the happiness on Harry\u2019s face as well. </p><p>He leans over and kisses you on the lips, his hands on either side of your face as he pushes his lips into yours at a happy rhythm, the first time the two of you have felt happy and safe with each other, knowing that you will be leaving to Canada. </p><p>You pull yourself up and sit on Harry\u2019s lap, your lips still touching and your bodies on fire. The heat and passion from the first time you two did this is still there, and you couldn\u2019t wait for it to happen again. Your hands started to mess with the bottom of his shirt, your fingers messing with the hem. He lifts his arms up and you pull his shirt over his head, his hands immediately resting back on your face and your lips reconnecting. </p><p>He messes with the back of your dress and his fingers somehow manage to skilfully get the horrible material off you, leaving you in the even worse undergarments. You mess with the buckle of Harry\u2019s belt and he stands up to take his trousers off. You lay back on the bed and Harry lays over you, his hands running up and down the outside of your thighs as you kiss again. </p><p>You hope you can be like this forever when you go to Canada. Not worrying about whether you\u2019re going to be caught, or whether you\u2019re carrying another mans baby, it\u2019s just you and him. His hands rake up and down your sides, pulling the underdress up and over your head, leaving you in your bra and panties. </p><p>His hands curl around your back and unhook your bra, and he throws it over the room somewhere. His lips run down your neck and attach to your nipple. Sinful noises leave your mouth and you can\u2019t help but clench your thighs together. Harry\u2019s lips carry on further down until he kisses your clit over your panties. </p><p>His fingers wrap around the material and pull them down your legs, his lips attaching directly onto the your clit afterwards. His tongue flicks over it and you can\u2019t hold the noises back any longer, and Harry groans against you, causing your breath to catch and pleasure racking up in your body. </p><p>\u201cLovely, you okay?\u201d He asks, pulling away from you and looking up, with his green eyes and a loving smile on his fine. </p><p>\u201cI just want you to fuck me,\u201d You said, your voice breathless, \u201cPlease.\u201d </p><p>He nodded his head and crawled up again, leaning over you and pressing and loving kiss to your cheek before pulling his boxers down and lining himself up with your entrance. He pushes in slowly and your lips only disconnect for him to start sucking on your collar bone, a breathless moan leaving your mouth. </p><p>It\u2019s times like these where you\u2019re happy, you don\u2019t have the constant looming of the guards or the Knights over you, it\u2019s just you and Harry. The man you love with all of your heart. </p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d You say, your voice quiet but there and Harry carries on pushing into you but with a smile on your face. </p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d He says, pushing in at a fast speed. </p><p>You come first, your whole body going rigid and the pleasure just runs through your body and Harry comes after, a low groan escaping his mouth as he collapsed into your neck. </p><p>The next day, you and Harry plan to leave in the night. You would go when Mrs Knight is asleep and Mr Knight is in his office. You know that it\u2019s risky, but once you\u2019ve escaped, you\u2019ll be free, you\u2019ll hopefully find people that you used to know - alive - and you\u2019ll live. </p><p>You go to Harry\u2019s loft when the times right and you changed into the outfit, a cloak wrapped around you as well. Harry was going to drive you pass the guards and towards a \u2018meeting\u2019 near the border, with your pretending to be Mrs Knight, you hoped more than anything that it would work. </p><p>It needed to work.</p>",

You hated when there was a meeting with all the Handmaids and Aunt Lydia, since it normally meant that somebody had committed a crime and you would have to punish them. It was part of what you did, and you hated it, you hated your vagina for working so perfectly and you hated how you got caught and now spend your days with the Knight family. </p><p>The man had raped the girl in his house, and, apparently, the only people that can rape the Handmaids were the men of the house, so he was sentenced to death by physical abuse. You followed the girls who circled around him and watched as they started to hit him. You pretended to throw a few punches and kick but you didn\u2019t actually touch him. You stayed your distance and left the other girls to do so. </p><p>\u201cThank you, girls, you may now leave,\u201d Aunt Lydia spoke, her glare fixed onto all the girls as they left. </p><p>You found your partner, a very quite girl called Ofnick, but, you two were the perfect  pair because the two of you didn\u2019t speak much. You greeted each other, you walked, you left. That\u2019s all you two do together, but, if your honest, you can\u2019t wait to leave her and be alone. But you\u2019re never really alone in this place. </p><p>You walk into the house, take your robe and hat off and walking into the kitchen where Florence the maid was making your lunch and Harry was sat eating his lunch, \u201cBlessed be the fruit.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMay the lord open,\u201d Florence says whilst Harry nods his head in your direction. Completely professional.</p><p>Everybody spoils you on this day, since it\u2019s the ceremony, the whole reason that you\u2019re here being a handmaid is because of today, and hopefully the life you will possess because of it. Harry can\u2019t look you in the eye on the day of the ceremony, and you get why, but sometimes it hurts. You need him on these days and he can\u2019t even look you in the eye. </p><p>The second you sit down and start to eat, Harry passes his plate to Florence and leaves. You don\u2019t let it show, but it hurts, so to mask it, you try to eat as much of the food as possibly before going upstairs.

You still feel his touch way after it&rsquo;s done, and you still feel him inside of you, but you just ignore it. You know this what you have to do, and you get on with it, no matter how much you don&rsquo;t want him to. </p><p>You leave the room and immediately go and try to wash yourself a billion times, you know it doesn&rsquo;t work but it gives you a sense of cleanliness. You hear Mr Knight go to his office and you know that Mrs Knight has gone to bed. You carefully sneak out of bed and walk down the stairs, avoiding the creaky steps and making sure to be as quiet as possible when opening and closing the front door. </p><p>You walk up the steps to Harry&rsquo;s loft and knock on the door. The second he looks at you, he grasps your arm and pulls you into a hug. He pulls you in the loft, closes the door and pushes your face into his chest. His hands wrap around your shoulders and yours wrap around his waist. His hand moves to the back of your head and he runs his fingers through my hair. </p><p>&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; He asks, his voice quiet and worried. You nod your head into his chest and try and push yourself further into it. He places a kiss to the top of your head and pulls away, but grabs your hand and pulls you onto his bed, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be fine, baby, we&rsquo;re nearly ready to leave. It won&rsquo;t take much longer.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to do this anymore, H,&rdquo; You say, your head resting in his lap as his hands running through your hair. </p><p>&ldquo;Its Okay, you&rsquo;ll be fine,&rdquo; Harry says, his voice louder and more certain, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be in Canada in a week, max, and I&rsquo;ll be there next to you.&rdquo; </p><p>The next day, people avoid you like the plague, the ceremony is over meaning that they just want you to have a bun in the oven so you can bake it, give it to them, and move on to the next family. You don&rsquo;t want this to happen, but there&rsquo;s nothing you can do. Not until Harry gets you away from here in the next week. He promised he would when you first hooked up, he told you he was part of a secret system that could get you both out and both into Canada safely. </p><p>Ofnick was waiting for you outside the gate when you walked out this morning. You walked with your head down but you could feel Harry&rsquo;s green stare coming from the window of his loft. You couldn&rsquo;t look up at him but you knew he was there, and he knew exactly what you were thinking.</p><p>You and Ofnick then slowly walk down the street, towards the supermarket. That&rsquo;s another job as Handmaid, when your family require something from the shop, you go and you get it, using your tokens. The two of you greet each other and don&rsquo;t talk for the rest of the time together. People don&rsquo;t even talk to you when you get there because you&rsquo;re the odd girl that doesn&rsquo;t talk to anyone. You don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ve spoken another word to a Handmaid that isn&rsquo;t Ofnick before. </p><p>Ofnick leaves and says she&rsquo;s going to the fishmonger so you walk over to the butcher. Mrs Knight said that she had asked for them to put a piece of meat aside and she made sure that you had enough tokens to get it. You walk up the butcher greats you with a smile, and you say your families name and he gives you a weird look. </p><p>&ldquo;We have two things for you,&rdquo; He says, putting the two parcels on the counter in front of you, &ldquo;The first ones just for you.&rdquo;</p><p>You pass him the needed tokens before grabbing both the parcels and holding them in your hands. You tell Ofnick that you&rsquo;ll wait for her outside and you stuff the parcel that&rsquo;s not meat under your dress. You then walk home, with the other parcel sticking into you the whole way home. </p><p>That night, you make your way over to Harry&rsquo;s, with the parcel in hand. He lets you in and you sit one the bed with the parcel and you open it together. It was a set of housewives clothes and two tickets to get through the border of Canada. You feel happy, and you can see the happiness on Harry&rsquo;s face as well. </p><p>He leans over and kisses you on the lips, his hands on either side of your face as he pushes his lips into yours at a happy rhythm, the first time the two of you have felt happy and safe with each other, knowing that you will be leaving to Canada. </p><p>You pull yourself up and sit on Harry&rsquo;s lap, your lips still touching and your bodies on fire. The heat and passion from the first time you two did this is still there, and you couldn&rsquo;t wait for it to happen again. Your hands started to mess with the bottom of his shirt, your fingers messing with the hem. He lifts his arms up and you pull his shirt over his head, his hands immediately resting back on your face and your lips reconnecting. </p><p>He messes with the back of your dress and his fingers somehow manage to skilfully get the horrible material off you, leaving you in the even worse undergarments. You mess with the buckle of Harry&rsquo;s belt and he stands up to take his trousers off. You lay back on the bed and Harry lays over you, his hands running up and down the outside of your thighs as you kiss again. </p><p>You hope you can be like this forever when you go to Canada. Not worrying about whether you&rsquo;re going to be caught, or whether you&rsquo;re carrying another mans baby, it&rsquo;s just you and him. His hands rake up and down your sides, pulling the underdress up and over your head, leaving you in your bra and panties. </p><p>His hands curl around your back and unhook your bra, and he throws it over the room somewhere. His lips run down your neck and attach to your nipple. Sinful noises leave your mouth and you can&rsquo;t help but clench your thighs together. Harry&rsquo;s lips carry on further down until he kisses your clit over your panties. </p><p>His fingers wrap around the material and pull them down your legs, his lips attaching directly onto the your clit afterwards. His tongue flicks over it and you can&rsquo;t hold the noises back any longer, and Harry groans against you, causing your breath to catch and pleasure racking up in your body. </p><p>&ldquo;Lovely, you okay?&rdquo; He asks, pulling away from you and looking up, with his green eyes and a loving smile on his fine. </p><p>&ldquo;I just want you to fuck me,&rdquo; You said, your voice breathless, &ldquo;Please.&rdquo; </p><p>He nodded his head and crawled up again, leaning over you and pressing and loving kiss to your cheek before pulling his boxers down and lining himself up with your entrance. He pushes in slowly and your lips only disconnect for him to start sucking on your collar bone, a breathless moan leaving your mouth. </p><p>It&rsquo;s times like these where you&rsquo;re happy, you don&rsquo;t have the constant looming of the guards or the Knights over you, it&rsquo;s just you and Harry. The man you love with all of your heart. </p><p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; You say, your voice quiet but there and Harry carries on pushing into you but with a smile on your face. </p><p>&ldquo;I love you too,&rdquo; He says, pushing in at a fast speed. </p><p>You come first, your whole body going rigid and the pleasure just runs through your body and Harry comes after, a low groan escaping his mouth as he collapsed into your neck. </p><p>The next day, you and Harry plan to leave in the night. You would go when Mrs Knight is asleep and Mr Knight is in his office. You know that it&rsquo;s risky, but once you&rsquo;ve escaped, you&rsquo;ll be free, you&rsquo;ll hopefully find people that you used to know - alive - and you&rsquo;ll live. </p><p>You go to Harry&rsquo;s loft when the times right and you changed into the outfit, a cloak wrapped around you as well. Harry was going to drive you pass the guards and towards a &lsquo;meeting&rsquo; near the border, with your pretending to be Mrs Knight, you hoped more than anything that it would work. </p><p>It needed to work.</p>",

I hope you are too.&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Also I&rsquo;m still struggling with what to call the other woman in the story? Please let me know your name suggestions <a href=\"http://lovelyandwanderful.tumblr.com/ask\">here</a>. First chapter will be up very soon xx Anna</b></p>",
