And that&rsquo;s the reason that you have loads of ice cream and cookies in the kitchen instead of your usual health shit. You&rsquo;re sulking. It has to be love because there&rsquo;s nothing else that would get you down. The only thing would be one of your friends being hurt, but we&rsquo;re all fine, so it has to be a you thing. And your job is perfect and your apartment is perfect and everything else is shipshape, so it&rsquo;s gotta be your heart.&rdquo;</p><p>Words: 1536, Chapters: 1/1, Language: English</p><p>Series: Part 27 of <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/series/1121871\" target=\"_blank\">Stony September AUs</a></p><ul><li>Fandoms: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe/works\" target=\"_blank\">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a></li><li>Rating: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/General%20Audiences/works\" target=\"_blank\">General Audiences</a></li><li>Warnings: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/No%20Archive%20Warnings%20Apply/works\" target=\"_blank\">No Archive Warnings Apply</a></li><li>Categories: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/M*s*M/works\" target=\"_blank\">M/M</a></li><li>Characters: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Steve%20Rogers/works\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Rogers</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Tony%20Stark/works\" target=\"_blank\">Tony Stark</a></li><li>Relationships: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Steve%20Rogers*s*Tony%20Stark/works\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Rogers/Tony Stark</a></li><li>Additional Tags: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Alternate%20Universe%20-%20No%20Powers/works\" target=\"_blank\">Alternate Universe - No Powers</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Fluff/works\" target=\"_blank\">Fluff</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Getting%20Together/works\" target=\"_blank\">Getting Together</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Friends%20to%20Lovers/works\" target=\"_blank\">Friends to Lovers</a></li></ul><br /><br />\nread it on the AO3 at <strong><a href=\"https://ift.tt/2xHVpdw\" target=\"_blank\">https://ift.tt/2xHVpdw</a></strong></p>",

I quickly took in my surroundings, I felt like a small fish in the ocean.</p><p>I right away knew I had to get myself a drink to stop myself from looking at my phone for some sort of distraction, I walked over to the bar and ordered myself a coke. The bartender acted surprised when I had said, \u201cCoke,\u201d as if he were expecting me to order an alcoholic beverage.</p><p>I looked over to the dance floor and noticed Bren walking over to me, \u201cyou must be Bren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be Olivia Stark,\u201d He smiled, \u201cDaughter of Tony Stark, also known as one of the men on my dad\u2019s most hated list.\u201d</p><p>I smirked, \u201cMy dad and I are two different people, although we carry very similar traits and well, DNA of course, his mistakes are not mine.

Especially with someone like my father, I have big plans in my future. Ones that I can not achieve with parties that are like\u2026 high school parties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you find it sad that we have to live up to these expectations because of our parents?\u201d I asked as I grabbed the drink that was placed for me on the counter. He escorted me to a small booth, we both sat down as I began to take a sip of my drink.</p><p>\u201cI find it sad that some people think it\u2019s right to steal other peoples ideas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdeas or suggestions. People should really label things if they really cared for them.\u201d</p><p>He pursed his lips together, \u201cnow-now, Livia, we all know your father did mine dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing personal, but that\u2019s life.\u201d \u00a0I chuckled, \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s silly that we\u2019re arguing over something that happened between our parents and not us?\u201d I asked as I placed my drink on the table.</p><p>He chuckled, \u201cyou\u2019re right, it is silly. But we\u2019re doing their dirty work for them.\u201d</p><p>I nod, \u201cDoes this mean you\u2019ll put in a good word for me then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d he smirks.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see?\u201d</p><p>He nods, \u201cRefill?\u201d Before I could protest, he grabbed my glass and walked away. I was then left alone to watch as people danced to the music, I looked for Liam, spotting him on the dance floor with a girl. It looked like the girl he had talked about, the one he had his eye on for a while and from the looks of the way they were dancing it looked like he finally grew the balls to ask her out or something of the sort.</p><p>Before I knew it, Bren came back with my drink, I took a small glance at my watch to see that he had taken longer than I expected. I looked over to where Liam was but I couldn\u2019t find him, \u00a0\u201cIt would be a shame if you came to this party only to talk business,\u201d he began to say as he glanced to the crowd of people dancing, \u201cyou should at least attempt to have some fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this your attempt to ask me to dance with you?\u201d He laughs, \u201cbecause it\u2019s a horrible one.\u201d</p><p>He smiles, \u201cwell, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne dance won\u2019t hurt,\u201d I said softly as I took a sip of my drink before getting up. Everything about the taste of the drink felt off, I looked over at Bren who was smiling at me as he held out his arm for me to take. Maybe I\u2019m just thinking way too much about it. I grabbed his arm and he led me to the dance floor. I wish I had listened to my gut feeling.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>Taglist:\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQCoyB30ZsdXW44DY5vb1mA\" target=\"_blank\">@waves-and-sunflowers</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moO5ASXsR-8zVvnRKaO4y9w\" target=\"_blank\">@spiderlingsweb</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMUcNZwqcER8WcUxUkbj1dg\" target=\"_blank\">@emmii4</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQxq9pqtJWSHDaPfB-ilG_g\" target=\"_blank\">@henrietteoaks</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRHXBfPMH7F542zQzlTvYVw\" target=\"_blank\">@spider-woman22</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4DOyvzoSlPzPFkTgDWyivw\" target=\"_blank\">@abitofeverythinggg</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mntqqMCubZwtWSuO5TopN1w\" target=\"_blank\">@oliolioxiclean</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFwXVjnT7MSXXEhznVsXbUQ\" target=\"_blank\">@littlephoenix-fire</a>\u00a0</b></p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Permanent taglist is open!\u00a0<br/></b><b>Side Effects May Include Taglist is closed!!\u00a0</b></h2><p><b>ALL REQUESTS ARE OPEN!\u00a0</b></p><p><b>Message me for any requests or to be added to taglists!\u00a0</b></p>",
