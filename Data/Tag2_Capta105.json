And here\u2019s another record for the history books: Its release marks the first time a female editor has edited three Marvel movies back-to-back-to-back. Since joining the studio in 2017, Debbie Berman has assembled the inaugural adventures for three of the <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/tagged/marvel-cinematic-universe\">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>\u2018s most exciting new heroes \u2014 Spider-Man, Black Panther and now Carol Danvers. \u201cI feel like the luckiest person in the world,\u201d the South African-born Berman tells Yahoo Entertainment. \u201cTo be part of bringing Spidey home to Marvel was just spectacular, and <em>Black Panther </em>was a phenomenal experience. To end that off with Marvel\u2019s first female-led film \u2014 I just couldn\u2019t have asked for more. Each film has been a gift in its own way.\u201d</p> <p>One of the gifts of working in the editing room is taking an active role in how each movie takes shape by helping to decide what stays in and, more importantly, what gets cut out. And Captain Marvel experienced a number of major and minor alterations on her way to becoming the hero that moviegoers are meeting for the first time on the big screen. Here are a half-dozen secrets about the global hit straight from the <em>Captain Marvel </em>cutting room.</p> <h3><strong>Carol originally took a solo space flight at the end of the film</strong></h3> <p>Having unlocked her full powers, reclaimed her name, beaten back Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) and vanquished her mentor/mental manipulator, Yon-Rogg (Jude Law), Carol deserves to just kick back and watch <em>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air </em>with\u00a0Maria and Monica (Lashana Lynch and Akira Akbar) as <em>Captain Marvel </em>draws to a close. Instead, she almost immediately embarks on another mission: locating a new home for Skrull leader Talos (Ben Mendelsohn) and his fellow shape-shifters, far from their Kree oppressors.</p> <p>In the original cut of the movie, Danvers left on her planet-finding mission by herself \u2014 a choice that Berman found jarring. \u201cThat\u2019s something I flagged early on \u2014 \u2018Where is she going?\u2019 We realized she had spoken a little about what she was doing, but it wasn\u2019t being visually supported by just seeing her fly off into space alone, especially since she\u2019s leaving behind her re-found family. It felt like we needed a stronger visual to support her leaving.\u201d</p> <p>Directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck came up with that necessarily visual <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/captain-marvel-movie-reshoots-set-photos/\">during a round of reshoots in the fall of 2018</a>, adding shots of Talos and the other Skrull survivors following behind Carol in their spaceship. \u201cThat gave more resonance to the ending,\u201d Berman explains of the simple, but effective tweak. \u201cIt was like, \u2018If she\u2019s going to disappears [for 20 years], we know who she\u2019s with and what she\u2019s doing.\u2019 It added to the specificity of their mission.\u201d</p> <figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"900\" data-orig-width=\"2127\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/acc0a61ddd2aa8738c75d5de2d4a5d17\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4f5461f30a24eb897cee50bc6df0fa67/tumblr_inline_pog0t1fYEL1uwsgms_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"900\" data-orig-width=\"2127\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/acc0a61ddd2aa8738c75d5de2d4a5d17\"/></figure><figcaption>Carol Danvers faces the Supreme Intelligence in a climactic rematch in <em>Captain Marvel</em>\u00a0(Photo: Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures/Marvel/Courtesy Everett Collection)</figcaption><h3><strong>The Supreme Intelligence confrontation was supremely difficult to get right</strong></h3> <p>It took more than a few additional shots to arrive at the right version of <em>Captain Marvel</em>\u2018s most important sequence: Carol\u2019s second face-to-face encounter with the Supreme Intelligence. Both times, the Kree\u2019s A.I.-enhanced ruler appears to her in the form of Dr. Wendy Lawson, a.k.a. Mar-Vell (Annette Bening), but it\u2019s only in the film\u2019s climax that Danvers fully understands the significance of that particular face. Berman says that the first cut of that encounter was much longer, as she and the directors tried to work out how much information needed to be communicated during that scene about Carol\u2019s self-discovery, as well as how her mental fight with her adversary should play out. \u201cThe visual effects all kind of came together at the last minute; there were a lot of variations on what the chamber looked and felt like. And the idea of it falling apart at the end was something that we came to late in the game.\u201d</p> <p>Certain key moments happened in a different order as well. For example, the moment where Vers tearfully reclaims her Earth name occurred earlier in the scene, where it played more like a moment of self-discovery rather than a declaration of purpose. \u201cThat moment is so pivotal, it felt more like an emotional climax instead of a revelation,\u201d Berman notes, adding that Larson\u2019s performance of the line \u201cMy name is Carol\u201d was almost radically different as well. \u201cThere were a lot of takes where Brie did it in a really strong and kick-ass fashion, the kind of performance that you\u2019ve almost come to expect in that moment where it\u2019s really powerful and determined. But then I was going through the takes, and I saw one with a tear running down her cheek. I\u2019d never seen that before \u2014 someone in their most powerful moment also displaying emotion. That\u2019s kind of the theme of the whole film: you shouldn\u2019t run from your emotions, because they can empower you. So I went with that take expecting a bit of a kick-back [from the filmmakers], but everyone really loved it. To me, that\u2019s the most powerful moment in the film \u2014 that line and that take.\u201d</p> <p>Another strong candidate for <em>Captain Marvel</em>\u2018s most powerful moment is the rousing montage of Carol rising to her feet as a young girl, a teenager, an Air Force recruit and, finally, a superhero. It\u2019s a sequence that\u2019s so effective and so emotional it became a key part of Marvel\u2019s advertising campaign.

Early on in the movie, he captures the brainwashed Vers and scans through her Kree-altered memories looking for clues to the whereabouts of Mar-Vell. \u201cEach little snippet [of those memories] came out of almost a full scene,\u201d notes Berman. That means there\u2019s a longer sequence of 13-year-old Carol (Mckenna Grace) getting yelled at by her dad after wiping out on the Go-Kart track, as well more screen time for 6-year-old Carol (London Fuller). \u201cThe original version of that sequence was significantly longer, and it was a very collaborative process of trial-and-error trying to decide what you needed to see.

And here\u2019s another record for the history books: Its release marks the first time a female editor has edited three Marvel movies back-to-back-to-back. Since joining the studio in 2017, Debbie Berman has assembled the inaugural adventures for three of the <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/tagged/marvel-cinematic-universe\">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>\u2018s most exciting new heroes \u2014 Spider-Man, Black Panther and now Carol Danvers. \u201cI feel like the luckiest person in the world,\u201d the South African-born Berman tells Yahoo Entertainment. \u201cTo be part of bringing Spidey home to Marvel was just spectacular, and <em>Black Panther </em>was a phenomenal experience. To end that off with Marvel\u2019s first female-led film \u2014 I just couldn\u2019t have asked for more. Each film has been a gift in its own way.\u201d</p> <p>One of the gifts of working in the editing room is taking an active role in how each movie takes shape by helping to decide what stays in and, more importantly, what gets cut out. And Captain Marvel experienced a number of major and minor alterations on her way to becoming the hero that moviegoers are meeting for the first time on the big screen. Here are a half-dozen secrets about the global hit straight from the <em>Captain Marvel </em>cutting room.</p> <h3><strong>Carol originally took a solo space flight at the end of the film</strong></h3> <p>Having unlocked her full powers, reclaimed her name, beaten back Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) and vanquished her mentor/mental manipulator, Yon-Rogg (Jude Law), Carol deserves to just kick back and watch <em>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air </em>with\u00a0Maria and Monica (Lashana Lynch and Akira Akbar) as <em>Captain Marvel </em>draws to a close. Instead, she almost immediately embarks on another mission: locating a new home for Skrull leader Talos (Ben Mendelsohn) and his fellow shape-shifters, far from their Kree oppressors.</p> <p>In the original cut of the movie, Danvers left on her planet-finding mission by herself \u2014 a choice that Berman found jarring. \u201cThat\u2019s something I flagged early on \u2014 \u2018Where is she going?\u2019 We realized she had spoken a little about what she was doing, but it wasn\u2019t being visually supported by just seeing her fly off into space alone, especially since she\u2019s leaving behind her re-found family. It felt like we needed a stronger visual to support her leaving.\u201d</p> <p>Directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck came up with that necessarily visual <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/captain-marvel-movie-reshoots-set-photos/\">during a round of reshoots in the fall of 2018</a>, adding shots of Talos and the other Skrull survivors following behind Carol in their spaceship. \u201cThat gave more resonance to the ending,\u201d Berman explains of the simple, but effective tweak. \u201cIt was like, \u2018If she\u2019s going to disappears [for 20 years], we know who she\u2019s with and what she\u2019s doing.\u2019 It added to the specificity of their mission.\u201d</p> <figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"900\" data-orig-width=\"2127\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/acc0a61ddd2aa8738c75d5de2d4a5d17\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4f5461f30a24eb897cee50bc6df0fa67/tumblr_inline_pog0t1fYEL1uwsgms_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"900\" data-orig-width=\"2127\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/acc0a61ddd2aa8738c75d5de2d4a5d17\"></figure><figcaption>Carol Danvers faces the Supreme Intelligence in a climactic rematch in <em>Captain Marvel</em>\u00a0(Photo: Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures/Marvel/Courtesy Everett Collection)</figcaption><h3><strong>The Supreme Intelligence confrontation was supremely difficult to get right</strong></h3> <p>It took more than a few additional shots to arrive at the right version of <em>Captain Marvel</em>\u2018s most important sequence: Carol\u2019s second face-to-face encounter with the Supreme Intelligence. Both times, the Kree\u2019s A.I.-enhanced ruler appears to her in the form of Dr. Wendy Lawson, a.k.a. Mar-Vell (Annette Bening), but it\u2019s only in the film\u2019s climax that Danvers fully understands the significance of that particular face. Berman says that the first cut of that encounter was much longer, as she and the directors tried to work out how much information needed to be communicated during that scene about Carol\u2019s self-discovery, as well as how her mental fight with her adversary should play out. \u201cThe visual effects all kind of came together at the last minute; there were a lot of variations on what the chamber looked and felt like. And the idea of it falling apart at the end was something that we came to late in the game.\u201d</p> <p>Certain key moments happened in a different order as well. For example, the moment where Vers tearfully reclaims her Earth name occurred earlier in the scene, where it played more like a moment of self-discovery rather than a declaration of purpose. \u201cThat moment is so pivotal, it felt more like an emotional climax instead of a revelation,\u201d Berman notes, adding that Larson\u2019s performance of the line \u201cMy name is Carol\u201d was almost radically different as well. \u201cThere were a lot of takes where Brie did it in a really strong and kick-ass fashion, the kind of performance that you\u2019ve almost come to expect in that moment where it\u2019s really powerful and determined. But then I was going through the takes, and I saw one with a tear running down her cheek. I\u2019d never seen that before \u2014 someone in their most powerful moment also displaying emotion. That\u2019s kind of the theme of the whole film: you shouldn\u2019t run from your emotions, because they can empower you. So I went with that take expecting a bit of a kick-back [from the filmmakers], but everyone really loved it. To me, that\u2019s the most powerful moment in the film \u2014 that line and that take.\u201d</p> <p>Another strong candidate for <em>Captain Marvel</em>\u2018s most powerful moment is the rousing montage of Carol rising to her feet as a young girl, a teenager, an Air Force recruit and, finally, a superhero. It\u2019s a sequence that\u2019s so effective and so emotional it became a key part of Marvel\u2019s advertising campaign. And Berman says that she and the filmmakers realized what they had right away. \u201cOnce we did that standing-up montage, it stuck. It\u2019s interesting how people react to it differently. Some people just want to cry and some people want to cheer, and some people want to do both. So the editing of it was instinctively leaning into what feels the most emotional in a moment like that. We found what felt like the most powerful moments and gave them enough time to settle so you could feel it in your gut.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"yahoo\" data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"360\" data-url=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/decoding-marvel-cinematic-universe-170123894.html?format=embed\"><iframe src=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/decoding-marvel-cinematic-universe-170123894.html?format=embed\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"640\" height=\"380\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><br><h3><strong>The mid-credits scene was helmed by \u2018Avengers: Endgame\u2019 directors</strong></h3> <p>Rather than wait until April to show us the first momentous first meeting between Marvel\u2019s two Captains in <em><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/tagged/avengers-endgame/\">Avengers: Endgame</a></em>, a <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/captain-marvel-easter-eggs-end-credits-stan-lee-furys-eye-avengers-endgame-spoilers-223620920.html\">mid-credits bonus scene</a> drops us directly into <em>Infinity War</em>\u2018s wake, when Thanos\u2019s finger-snap has reduced the world\u2019s population by over three billion and counting and transformed the Avengers into the Glum-vengers.

And here\u2019s another record for the history books: Its release marks the first time a female editor has edited three Marvel movies back-to-back-to-back. Since joining the studio in 2017, Debbie Berman has assembled the inaugural adventures for three of the <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/tagged/marvel-cinematic-universe\">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>\u2018s most exciting new heroes \u2014 Spider-Man, Black Panther and now Carol Danvers. \u201cI feel like the luckiest person in the world,\u201d the South African-born Berman tells Yahoo Entertainment. \u201cTo be part of bringing Spidey home to Marvel was just spectacular, and <em>Black Panther </em>was a phenomenal experience. To end that off with Marvel\u2019s first female-led film \u2014 I just couldn\u2019t have asked for more. Each film has been a gift in its own way.\u201d</p> <p>One of the gifts of working in the editing room is taking an active role in how each movie takes shape by helping to decide what stays in and, more importantly, what gets cut out. And Captain Marvel experienced a number of major and minor alterations on her way to becoming the hero that moviegoers are meeting for the first time on the big screen. Here are a half-dozen secrets about the global hit straight from the <em>Captain Marvel </em>cutting room.</p> <h3><strong>Carol originally took a solo space flight at the end of the film</strong></h3> <p>Having unlocked her full powers, reclaimed her name, beaten back Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) and vanquished her mentor/mental manipulator, Yon-Rogg (Jude Law), Carol deserves to just kick back and watch <em>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air </em>with\u00a0Maria and Monica (Lashana Lynch and Akira Akbar) as <em>Captain Marvel </em>draws to a close. Instead, she almost immediately embarks on another mission: locating a new home for Skrull leader Talos (Ben Mendelsohn) and his fellow shape-shifters, far from their Kree oppressors.</p> <p>In the original cut of the movie, Danvers left on her planet-finding mission by herself \u2014 a choice that Berman found jarring. \u201cThat\u2019s something I flagged early on \u2014 \u2018Where is she going?\u2019 We realized she had spoken a little about what she was doing, but it wasn\u2019t being visually supported by just seeing her fly off into space alone, especially since she\u2019s leaving behind her re-found family. It felt like we needed a stronger visual to support her leaving.\u201d</p> <p>Directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck came up with that necessarily visual <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/captain-marvel-movie-reshoots-set-photos/\">during a round of reshoots in the fall of 2018</a>, adding shots of Talos and the other Skrull survivors following behind Carol in their spaceship. \u201cThat gave more resonance to the ending,\u201d Berman explains of the simple, but effective tweak. \u201cIt was like, \u2018If she\u2019s going to disappears [for 20 years], we know who she\u2019s with and what she\u2019s doing.\u2019 It added to the specificity of their mission.\u201d</p> <figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"900\" data-orig-width=\"2127\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/acc0a61ddd2aa8738c75d5de2d4a5d17\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4f5461f30a24eb897cee50bc6df0fa67/tumblr_inline_pog0t1fYEL1uwsgms_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"900\" data-orig-width=\"2127\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/acc0a61ddd2aa8738c75d5de2d4a5d17\"></figure><figcaption>Carol Danvers faces the Supreme Intelligence in a climactic rematch in <em>Captain Marvel</em>\u00a0(Photo: Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures/Marvel/Courtesy Everett Collection)</figcaption><h3><strong>The Supreme Intelligence confrontation was supremely difficult to get right</strong></h3> <p>It took more than a few additional shots to arrive at the right version of <em>Captain Marvel</em>\u2018s most important sequence: Carol\u2019s second face-to-face encounter with the Supreme Intelligence. Both times, the Kree\u2019s A.I.-enhanced ruler appears to her in the form of Dr. Wendy Lawson, a.k.a. Mar-Vell (Annette Bening), but it\u2019s only in the film\u2019s climax that Danvers fully understands the significance of that particular face. Berman says that the first cut of that encounter was much longer, as she and the directors tried to work out how much information needed to be communicated during that scene about Carol\u2019s self-discovery, as well as how her mental fight with her adversary should play out. \u201cThe visual effects all kind of came together at the last minute; there were a lot of variations on what the chamber looked and felt like. And the idea of it falling apart at the end was something that we came to late in the game.\u201d</p> <p>Certain key moments happened in a different order as well. For example, the moment where Vers tearfully reclaims her Earth name occurred earlier in the scene, where it played more like a moment of self-discovery rather than a declaration of purpose. \u201cThat moment is so pivotal, it felt more like an emotional climax instead of a revelation,\u201d Berman notes, adding that Larson\u2019s performance of the line \u201cMy name is Carol\u201d was almost radically different as well. \u201cThere were a lot of takes where Brie did it in a really strong and kick-ass fashion, the kind of performance that you\u2019ve almost come to expect in that moment where it\u2019s really powerful and determined. But then I was going through the takes, and I saw one with a tear running down her cheek. I\u2019d never seen that before \u2014 someone in their most powerful moment also displaying emotion. That\u2019s kind of the theme of the whole film: you shouldn\u2019t run from your emotions, because they can empower you. So I went with that take expecting a bit of a kick-back [from the filmmakers], but everyone really loved it. To me, that\u2019s the most powerful moment in the film \u2014 that line and that take.\u201d</p> <p>Another strong candidate for <em>Captain Marvel</em>\u2018s most powerful moment is the rousing montage of Carol rising to her feet as a young girl, a teenager, an Air Force recruit and, finally, a superhero. It\u2019s a sequence that\u2019s so effective and so emotional it became a key part of Marvel\u2019s advertising campaign. And Berman says that she and the filmmakers realized what they had right away. \u201cOnce we did that standing-up montage, it stuck. It\u2019s interesting how people react to it differently. Some people just want to cry and some people want to cheer, and some people want to do both. So the editing of it was instinctively leaning into what feels the most emotional in a moment like that. We found what felt like the most powerful moments and gave them enough time to settle so you could feel it in your gut.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"yahoo\" data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"360\" data-url=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/decoding-marvel-cinematic-universe-170123894.html?format=embed\"><iframe src=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/decoding-marvel-cinematic-universe-170123894.html?format=embed\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"640\" height=\"380\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><br><h3><strong>The mid-credits scene was helmed by \u2018Avengers: Endgame\u2019 directors</strong></h3> <p>Rather than wait until April to show us the first momentous first meeting between Marvel\u2019s two Captains in <em><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/tagged/avengers-endgame/\">Avengers: Endgame</a></em>, a <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/captain-marvel-easter-eggs-end-credits-stan-lee-furys-eye-avengers-endgame-spoilers-223620920.html\">mid-credits bonus scene</a> drops us directly into <em>Infinity War</em>\u2018s wake, when Thanos\u2019s finger-snap has reduced the world\u2019s population by over three billion and counting and transformed the Avengers into the Glum-vengers. Fortunately, the defeated super-team gains a new ally when Carol shows up demanding to know where her old pager pal, Nick Fury, is. Berman confirms that this sequence was helmed by <em>Infinity War </em>and <em>Endgame </em>directors Anthony and Joe Russo, but can\u2019t guarantee that it\u2019ll appear in the next <em>Avengers </em>film in exactly the same form. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen <em>Endgame</em>!\u201d she admits. \u201cThey would sometimes start talking about it in front of me and I\u2019d get really mad and say, \u2018No spoilers!\u2019 Because I\u2019m a fan, too, you know? So that scene did come from the Russo brothers, but it\u2019s cloaked in secrecy.\u201d</p> <h3><strong>A fond(er) farewell</strong></h3> <p>Before his death last November, Marvel icon Stan Lee<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09zggp9\">\u00a0filmed a number of cameos</a> for upcoming MCU movies, including his appearance in <em>Captain Marvel</em> where he\u2019s glimpsed studying for his role in Kevin Smith\u2019s 1995 favorite, <em>Mallrats</em>, on an L.A. subway train. <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/captain-marvel-directors-looked-stan-lee-cameo-fresh-eyes-death-spoilers-160058332.html\">Speaking with Yahoo Entertainment before the movie\u2019s release</a>, Boden hinted that they re-edited that encounter after his passing: \u201cWe certainly had fresh eyes on that scene for sure after he passed away.\u201d And Berman confirms that Carol\u2019s lingering smile as she looks at Lee is a new addition to the movie. \u201cOriginally, we didn\u2019t pause the scene to acknowledge him \u2014 it was more insignificant. We kind of break the reality of the scene for a moment, and she gives him a sweet smile almost as a tribute. It\u2019s so lovely and emotional, and it was important to honor that moment correctly.\u201d The editor admits has a personal reason for wanting to pay tribute to the late, great Lee. \u201cStan Lee and I are birthday buddies! We were both born on the 28th of December. I drive everyone at Marvel crazy, because I always remind them of that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"yahoo\" data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"360\" data-url=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/captain-marvel-directors-talk-stan-120000877.html?format=embed\"><iframe src=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/captain-marvel-directors-talk-stan-120000877.html?format=embed\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"640\" height=\"380\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><br><h3><strong>There\u2019s more footage of Carol as a child</strong></h3> <p>Talos may turn out to be one of the good Skrulls by the end of <em>Captain Marvel</em>, but he\u2019s as guilty as Yon-Rogg in terms of messing around with Carol\u2019s mind. Early on in the movie, he captures the brainwashed Vers and scans through her Kree-altered memories looking for clues to the whereabouts of Mar-Vell. \u201cEach little snippet [of those memories] came out of almost a full scene,\u201d notes Berman. That means there\u2019s a longer sequence of 13-year-old Carol (Mckenna Grace) getting yelled at by her dad after wiping out on the Go-Kart track, as well more screen time for 6-year-old Carol (London Fuller). \u201cThe original version of that sequence was significantly longer, and it was a very collaborative process of trial-and-error trying to decide what you needed to see. We needed to plant some of the people and story lines we will adhere to later in the film, while at the same time tell the story of the scene \u2014 which is that the Skrulls are going through her mind looking for very specific information.\u201d</p> <h3><strong>Getting the last laugh</strong></h3> <p>When is a comic book movie also an extra-long cat video? When one of your stars is a scene-stealing feline \u2026 uh, make that Flerken. Four different cats played the role of Goose, the adorable tabby who befriends Carol and Fury before revealing his <em>actual </em>identity as a highly-dangerous alien. \u201cMy job was to watch cat videos and choose different cat takes,\u201d laughs Berman, who declines to pick a favorite of the kitty thespian quartet. \u201cThese cats are curious performers, so there wasn\u2019t any sort of mad mayhem. They\u2019re working kitties, so they were in character.\u201d And the editor made sure to enhance their performances whenever possible, even at the last possible moment.</p> <figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"2800\" data-orig-width=\"4200\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/7079907774042d9f26e05b9cf252a806\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/75107317e1f33555bef8d5434ecc7ff5/tumblr_inline_pog0t1qoaQ1uwsgms_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"2800\" data-orig-width=\"4200\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/7079907774042d9f26e05b9cf252a806\"></figure><figcaption>Four different felines played Flerken scene-stealer, Goose, in <em>Captain Marvel.</em>\u00a0(Photo: Chuck Zlotnick/Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures/Marvel/Courtesy Everett Collection)</figcaption><p>According to Berman, <em>Captain Marvel </em>was completely finished when she asked to make one small \u2014 but not insignificant \u2014 change. It involved the post-credits scene of Goose leaping up onto Fury\u2019s desk at S.H.I.E.L.D. HQ, whereupon the alien promptly hacks up the Infinity Stone-containing Tesseract. \u201cOriginally, the scene would start, and there would be this little two-second break and the cat would jump on the table,\u201d Berman remembers. \u201cI was watching the film during the sound mix, and I realized that the scene would be so much funnier if you just stared at the desk for a little while.

Each film has been a gift in its own way.&rdquo;</p> <p>One of the gifts of working in the editing room is taking an active role in how each movie takes shape by helping to decide what stays in and, more importantly, what gets cut out. And Captain Marvel experienced a number of major and minor alterations on her way to becoming the hero that moviegoers are meeting for the first time on the big screen. Here are a half-dozen secrets about the global hit straight from the <em>Captain Marvel </em>cutting room.</p> <h3><strong>Carol originally took a solo space flight at the end of the film</strong></h3> <p>Having unlocked her full powers, reclaimed her name, beaten back Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) and vanquished her mentor/mental manipulator, Yon-Rogg (Jude Law), Carol deserves to just kick back and watch <em>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air </em>with&nbsp;Maria and Monica (Lashana Lynch and Akira Akbar) as <em>Captain Marvel </em>draws to a close. Instead, she almost immediately embarks on another mission: locating a new home for Skrull leader Talos (Ben Mendelsohn) and his fellow shape-shifters, far from their Kree oppressors.</p> <p>In the original cut of the movie, Danvers left on her planet-finding mission by herself &mdash; a choice that Berman found jarring. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s something I flagged early on &mdash; &lsquo;Where is she going?&rsquo; We realized she had spoken a little about what she was doing, but it wasn&rsquo;t being visually supported by just seeing her fly off into space alone, especially since she&rsquo;s leaving behind her re-found family. It felt like we needed a stronger visual to support her leaving.&rdquo;</p> <p>Directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck came up with that necessarily visual <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/captain-marvel-movie-reshoots-set-photos/\">during a round of reshoots in the fall of 2018</a>, adding shots of Talos and the other Skrull survivors following behind Carol in their spaceship. &ldquo;That gave more resonance to the ending,&rdquo; Berman explains of the simple, but effective tweak. &ldquo;It was like, &lsquo;If she&rsquo;s going to disappears [for 20 years], we know who she&rsquo;s with and what she&rsquo;s doing.&rsquo; It added to the specificity of their mission.&rdquo;</p> <figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4f5461f30a24eb897cee50bc6df0fa67/tumblr_inline_pog0t1fYEL1uwsgms_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure>Carol Danvers faces the Supreme Intelligence in a climactic rematch in <em>Captain Marvel</em>&nbsp;(Photo: Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures/Marvel/Courtesy Everett Collection)<h3><strong>The Supreme Intelligence confrontation was supremely difficult to get right</strong></h3> <p>It took more than a few additional shots to arrive at the right version of <em>Captain Marvel</em>&lsquo;s most important sequence: Carol&rsquo;s second face-to-face encounter with the Supreme Intelligence. Both times, the Kree&rsquo;s A.I.-enhanced ruler appears to her in the form of Dr. Wendy Lawson, a.k.a. Mar-Vell (Annette Bening), but it&rsquo;s only in the film&rsquo;s climax that Danvers fully understands the significance of that particular face. Berman says that the first cut of that encounter was much longer, as she and the directors tried to work out how much information needed to be communicated during that scene about Carol&rsquo;s self-discovery, as well as how her mental fight with her adversary should play out. &ldquo;The visual effects all kind of came together at the last minute; there were a lot of variations on what the chamber looked and felt like. And the idea of it falling apart at the end was something that we came to late in the game.&rdquo;</p> <p>Certain key moments happened in a different order as well. For example, the moment where Vers tearfully reclaims her Earth name occurred earlier in the scene, where it played more like a moment of self-discovery rather than a declaration of purpose. &ldquo;That moment is so pivotal, it felt more like an emotional climax instead of a revelation,&rdquo; Berman notes, adding that Larson&rsquo;s performance of the line &ldquo;My name is Carol&rdquo; was almost radically different as well. &ldquo;There were a lot of takes where Brie did it in a really strong and kick-ass fashion, the kind of performance that you&rsquo;ve almost come to expect in that moment where it&rsquo;s really powerful and determined. But then I was going through the takes, and I saw one with a tear running down her cheek. I&rsquo;d never seen that before &mdash; someone in their most powerful moment also displaying emotion. That&rsquo;s kind of the theme of the whole film: you shouldn&rsquo;t run from your emotions, because they can empower you. So I went with that take expecting a bit of a kick-back [from the filmmakers], but everyone really loved it. To me, that&rsquo;s the most powerful moment in the film &mdash; that line and that take.&rdquo;</p> <p>Another strong candidate for <em>Captain Marvel</em>&lsquo;s most powerful moment is the rousing montage of Carol rising to her feet as a young girl, a teenager, an Air Force recruit and, finally, a superhero. It&rsquo;s a sequence that&rsquo;s so effective and so emotional it became a key part of Marvel&rsquo;s advertising campaign. And Berman says that she and the filmmakers realized what they had right away. &ldquo;Once we did that standing-up montage, it stuck. It&rsquo;s interesting how people react to it differently. Some people just want to cry and some people want to cheer, and some people want to do both. So the editing of it was instinctively leaning into what feels the most emotional in a moment like that. We found what felt like the most powerful moments and gave them enough time to settle so you could feel it in your gut.&rdquo;</p>  <figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\"><p><a href=\"#\"><img src=\"https://assets.tumblr.com/images/inline_placeholder.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"14\"/></a></p></figure><br /><h3><strong>The mid-credits scene was helmed by &lsquo;Avengers: Endgame&rsquo; directors</strong></h3> <p>Rather than wait until April to show us the first momentous first meeting between Marvel&rsquo;s two Captains in <em><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/tagged/avengers-endgame/\">Avengers: Endgame</a></em>, a <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/captain-marvel-easter-eggs-end-credits-stan-lee-furys-eye-avengers-endgame-spoilers-223620920.html\">mid-credits bonus scene</a> drops us directly into <em>Infinity War</em>&lsquo;s wake, when Thanos&rsquo;s finger-snap has reduced the world&rsquo;s population by over three billion and counting and transformed the Avengers into the Glum-vengers. Fortunately, the defeated super-team gains a new ally when Carol shows up demanding to know where her old pager pal, Nick Fury, is. Berman confirms that this sequence was helmed by <em>Infinity War </em>and <em>Endgame </em>directors Anthony and Joe Russo, but can&rsquo;t guarantee that it&rsquo;ll appear in the next <em>Avengers </em>film in exactly the same form. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen <em>Endgame</em>!&rdquo; she admits. &ldquo;They would sometimes start talking about it in front of me and I&rsquo;d get really mad and say, &lsquo;No spoilers!&rsquo; Because I&rsquo;m a fan, too, you know? So that scene did come from the Russo brothers, but it&rsquo;s cloaked in secrecy.&rdquo;</p> <h3><strong>A fond(er) farewell</strong></h3> <p>Before his death last November, Marvel icon Stan Lee<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09zggp9\">&nbsp;filmed a number of cameos</a> for upcoming MCU movies, including his appearance in <em>Captain Marvel</em> where he&rsquo;s glimpsed studying for his role in Kevin Smith&rsquo;s 1995 favorite, <em>Mallrats</em>, on an L.A. subway train. <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/captain-marvel-directors-looked-stan-lee-cameo-fresh-eyes-death-spoilers-160058332.html\">Speaking with Yahoo Entertainment before the movie&rsquo;s release</a>, Boden hinted that they re-edited that encounter after his passing: &ldquo;We certainly had fresh eyes on that scene for sure after he passed away.&rdquo; And Berman confirms that Carol&rsquo;s lingering smile as she looks at Lee is a new addition to the movie. &ldquo;Originally, we didn&rsquo;t pause the scene to acknowledge him &mdash; it was more insignificant. We kind of break the reality of the scene for a moment, and she gives him a sweet smile almost as a tribute. It&rsquo;s so lovely and emotional, and it was important to honor that moment correctly.&rdquo; The editor admits has a personal reason for wanting to pay tribute to the late, great Lee. &ldquo;Stan Lee and I are birthday buddies! We were both born on the 28th of December. I drive everyone at Marvel crazy, because I always remind them of that.&rdquo;</p>  <figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\"><p><a href=\"#\"><img src=\"https://assets.tumblr.com/images/inline_placeholder.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"14\"/></a></p></figure><br /><h3><strong>There&rsquo;s more footage of Carol as a child</strong></h3> <p>Talos may turn out to be one of the good Skrulls by the end of <em>Captain Marvel</em>, but he&rsquo;s as guilty as Yon-Rogg in terms of messing around with Carol&rsquo;s mind. Early on in the movie, he captures the brainwashed Vers and scans through her Kree-altered memories looking for clues to the whereabouts of Mar-Vell. &ldquo;Each little snippet [of those memories] came out of almost a full scene,&rdquo; notes Berman. That means there&rsquo;s a longer sequence of 13-year-old Carol (Mckenna Grace) getting yelled at by her dad after wiping out on the Go-Kart track, as well more screen time for 6-year-old Carol (London Fuller). &ldquo;The original version of that sequence was significantly longer, and it was a very collaborative process of trial-and-error trying to decide what you needed to see. We needed to plant some of the people and story lines we will adhere to later in the film, while at the same time tell the story of the scene &mdash; which is that the Skrulls are going through her mind looking for very specific information.&rdquo;</p> <h3><strong>Getting the last laugh</strong></h3> <p>When is a comic book movie also an extra-long cat video? When one of your stars is a scene-stealing feline &hellip; uh, make that Flerken. Four different cats played the role of Goose, the adorable tabby who befriends Carol and Fury before revealing his <em>actual </em>identity as a highly-dangerous alien. &ldquo;My job was to watch cat videos and choose different cat takes,&rdquo; laughs Berman, who declines to pick a favorite of the kitty thespian quartet. &ldquo;These cats are curious performers, so there wasn&rsquo;t any sort of mad mayhem. They&rsquo;re working kitties, so they were in character.&rdquo; And the editor made sure to enhance their performances whenever possible, even at the last possible moment.</p> <figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/75107317e1f33555bef8d5434ecc7ff5/tumblr_inline_pog0t1qoaQ1uwsgms_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure>Four different felines played Flerken scene-stealer, Goose, in <em>Captain Marvel.</em>&nbsp;(Photo: Chuck Zlotnick/Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures/Marvel/Courtesy Everett Collection)<p>According to Berman, <em>Captain Marvel </em>was completely finished when she asked to make one small &mdash; but not insignificant &mdash; change. It involved the post-credits scene of Goose leaping up onto Fury&rsquo;s desk at S.H.I.E.L.D. HQ, whereupon the alien promptly hacks up the Infinity Stone-containing Tesseract. &ldquo;Originally, the scene would start, and there would be this little two-second break and the cat would jump on the table,&rdquo; Berman remembers. &ldquo;I was watching the film during the sound mix, and I realized that the scene would be so much funnier if you just stared at the desk for a little while. It would build anticipation, like, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s gonna happen?&lsquo;&rdquo; Even though the film was scheduled to be delivered to theaters, she persuaded Marvel to let her add additional frames to that last shot, delaying Goose&rsquo;s entrance. &ldquo;I remember running from the sound stage, saying &lsquo;There&rsquo;s going to be a long pause&mdash;it&rsquo;s going to be hilarious.'&rdquo; And everyone was like &ldquo;&lsquo;What?'&rdquo;</p> <p>Despite the potential for a distribution delay, Marvel agreed to Berman&rsquo;s 11th hour request. &ldquo;The film had gone out the door, but we pulled it back in the door,&rdquo; she says, proudly. &ldquo;One thing I always believe in is just fight to make the film better even after the film&rsquo;s done; it&rsquo;s worth it. Because when I sat and watched that with an audience, I could feel that the whole thing played better with that moment of anticipation in the beginning.&rdquo;</p> <p><em><strong>Captain Marvel&nbsp;</strong></em><strong>is playing in theaters now</strong></p> <figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\"><p><a href=\"#\"><img src=\"https://assets.tumblr.com/images/inline_placeholder.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"14\"/></a></p></figure> <p><strong>Read more from Yahoo Entertainment</strong></p> <ul><li><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/captain-marvel-easter-eggs-end-credits-stan-lee-furys-eye-avengers-endgame-spoilers-223620920.html\">&lsquo;Captain Marvel&rsquo; Easter eggs and end credits, explained: All about Stan Lee, Fury&rsquo;s eye, &lsquo;Avengers: Endgame&rsquo; and more (spoilers!)</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/captain-marvel-female-superheroes-coming-theaters-211005653.html\">After Captain Marvel, here are all the female superheroes coming to theaters</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/captain-marvel-joins-reunited-avengers-latest-endgame-trailer-134859305.html\">Captain Marvel joins reunited Avengers in latest &lsquo;Endgame&rsquo; trailer</a></li> </ul><p><strong>Want daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox? <a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N360801.1913355YAHOOADMANAGER/B21889679.232649067;dc_trk_aid=430121719;dc_trk_cid=107915321;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=\">Sign up here for Yahoo Entertainment &amp; Lifestyle&rsquo;s newsletter.</a></strong></p></p>",
