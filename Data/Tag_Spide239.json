He may have had a headache, but he was pretty sure that his brain wasn\u2019t actually rotting. God, he could almost hear Professor Williams correcting him on the use of the word. How insufferable.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0But that was just more proof, further evidence to back up his (very poor) argument. He couldn\u2019t even use words correctly; how could anyone expect him to pass English? There were so many more important things he could have been focusing on.</p><!-- more --><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Like the fact that that he had finally kind of gotten used to the head rush that came with sitting cross-legged on his ceiling for five hours. He\u2019d been steadily increasing the time he spent up there aimlessly scrolling through his Twitter feed, trying to see how long he could last. It was his own personal experiment of sorts\u2014Peter was a scientist, after all. He had hypothesized that he could only last about three hours at most. But to his surprise he\u2019d managed to go a solid four and a half before he gave out and threw up all over the floor of his dorm, though not before falling into it. His room reeked of bleach and Windex for a week. And after days of hard work and the sheer power of his unrelenting stubbornness, he\u2019d finally managed to go the full five and walk away from it with little more than a headache and seeing a few spots. He wasn\u2019t sure what he could do with this information but he was more than ready to find out. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Those were the kinds of things that occupied the space in Peter\u2019s mind. That and an innumerable amount of calculus formulas and chemical compounds and on and on and on. If he just started writing all the information he stored in that little Parker brain of his, he\u2019d fill an entire collection of encyclopedias without even trying. Now, with that in mind (feel free to groan at that awful joke), did it seem reasonable that he should pay any attention to try and compare two completely different plays from an era that should no longer concern anyone in this day and age on their employment of dramatic irony?</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0If one were as sane as Peter\u2014although he could almost guarantee his sanity was diminishing by the day\u2014they would undoubtedly agree with him when he said absolutely not. But frankly, it wasn\u2019t up to him. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0And so that was how Ned found him: cross-legged on the ceiling, with his back against the wall above his bed, his face as bright as a ripe tomato and with a worried expression that seemed to be carved in stone. But he had every right to freak out. He was failing English. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou know, that\u2019s not gonna help.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Ned dropped his bag on the floor next to the spot on the carpet that was whiter than the rest, and then fell back onto Peter\u2019s bed with a soft grunt, folding his arms under the pillow behind his head and gazing up at his best friend\u2019s face about a foot above him. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNothing helps,\u201d Peter groaned, unfolding his legs and stretching them out along the ceiling, the rough surface catching softly on the denim. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve come to think that maybe ending it all might be my only option.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh yeah, you could do that,\u201d Ned mused, feigning deep thought. \u201cBut then who\u2019d take over for the one and only web-slinger?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGod, I hate it when you have a point.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0As if he actually considered it, even for a second. If there was anything more unbearable to Peter than trying to write about anything even remotely related to his English course, it was the thought of not being around to be the friendly neighbourhood super hero he\u2019d promised to be. He had a city to protect. But it was also a long running joke between them that Peter would one day swing up high over the streets of New York and then neglect to catch himself on the way down. He couldn\u2019t remember when it started. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Peter stood then, stepping a few paces to his left in order to drop off the ceiling without landing on Ned, and with a quick flip he was on the proper side of the world where the normal people were. His head throbbed, all the warmth that had gathered there beginning to flow back down to where it was supposed to be and the pressure behind his eyes subsiding. He glanced at Ned, who had closed his eyes and looked rather peaceful on Peter\u2019s unmade, messy sheets.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo have you thought about what you\u2019re actually gonna do?\u201d he questioned. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Peter sighed. \u201cNothing. That\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna do.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Ned sat up then, looking at him incredulously as if he\u2019d just told him that there were vines sprouting from his ears. \u201cDude, you gotta do something.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSays who?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSays the school. You know English is mandatory, right? They won\u2019t let you enroll next semester if you don\u2019t pass.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo I\u2019ve been told.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Peter peeked at the clock on the small desk across the room, and though it was almost completely obscured by loose papers and notebooks that he never thought to put away, he still saw the bright green block numbers displaying the time. 4:43 PM. Nearly time to go. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0As he rummaged through his school bag looking for the new prototype webbing cartridges he\u2019d designed, he felt Ned\u2019s gaze on him from the way the hairs at the base of his neck stood on end. The feeling that Ned wanted to say something but couldn\u2019t bring himself to was making the air around Peter palpable. He felt the tension on his skin, eyes nearly watering at the way it stung the inside of his nostrils and he detested the way it made his mouth feel like it was stuffed with cotton balls. Though his heightened senses saved him from getting killed on a nearly daily basis, they always seemed to act up at really, really inopportune moments. Such as this one.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0He felt Ned\u2019s words before he heard them.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDo you need help?\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Peter frowned, his brows coming together. \u201cWhat, like a tutor?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, or something like that,\u201d Ned replied. \u201cI\u2019m asking because I know someone, you know, if you ever manage to swallow your pride and accept the fact that you can\u2019t get out of this by yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI believe this is what the kids call \u2018tough love\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Ned looked at him for a long time. Now that he was right side up it was easy to pinpoint all the warning signs that there was something terribly wrong. The bags under Peter\u2019s eyes had always been there; those dark crescent moons etched into the creases there by many nights spent swinging through the streets of the bustling city, stopping crime whenever it had the audacity to crop up, had become a permanent feature on his face. But there was something else, something far more concerning in the way his shoulders stayed perpetually close to his ears, an undeniable tension tugging his entire frame upward as if he was being pulled up by a tight string. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0And when he turned to face Ned once more, the crease between his brows that had been there since he\u2019d been sitting on the ceiling was still present, if not more prominent. He was only nineteen, but Peter was going to end up with wrinkles soon if he didn\u2019t stop frowning all the damn time.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0His expression softened, his features relaxing at his friend\u2019s words. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou look like shit,\u201d Ned continued, though his tone held the same care.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re so frustrating.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Peter smiled, plucking the mask of his suit off his desk and flipping it so it was facing the right way again, hiding the circuits and wires that lined nearly the entirety of the fabric. He brushed his arm across the desk, clearing space and knocking papers, books, pencils, rolls of solder and even a sock to the floor in the process. If looking at him wasn\u2019t proof enough that something had been troubling him, then one only needed to step into the catastrophe that was his dorm. But to be fair, did anyone keep their dorm sparkling? He didn\u2019t think so.<br/>\tHe fished the red and blue suit out of the top right corner of his small closet and smoothed it over the area he\u2019d cleared of clutter. Ned watched as he carefully slipped the cartridges into their holders at the hip.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m serious though,\u201d he pressed on, not missing the way Peter\u2019s ears twitched in annoyance. \u201cI\u2019ve got a friend who could help you.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI barely have money to buy food, Ned,\u201d Peter sighed. \u201cI seriously doubt I\u2019d be able to afford a tutor.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShe owes me a favour anyway. She wouldn\u2019t make you pay.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0He turned back to face Ned, eyebrows raised. \u201cWhat makes you think she\u2019d even be willing to help me?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, please.\u201d With a roll of his eyes, Ned reached into his back pocket and pulled out his phone, scrolling through what Peter could only assume was his contact list. \u201cWould I even be friends with someone that cold hearted?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know, last time I checked we were still friends with MJ.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cShe\u2019d punch you if she heard that.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCountin\u2019 on it.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0He held up the suit by the shoulders then, the baggy material looking drab and uninteresting and frankly kind of ridiculous. Throwing it on the bed at Ned\u2019s feet, he tugged the hem of his ESU hoodie up and over his head, his t-shirt and pants coming off shortly after. He discarded the clothes on his floor with little regard as to where they ended up. Ned moved around him as Peter tugged on the loose suit. He set up his laptop on the desk and pulled a textbook out of his backpack. This part of their routine was easy, comfortable even. It had integrated itself into their lives just as easily as everything else did.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Peter tapped the spider emblem on his chest, sucking in a quick breath as the material of the suit formed to his body and hugged his limbs. He turned to grab the mask but found Ned already holding it out to him, a worried expression on his face. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0He took it carefully. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Ned only nodded, swivelling around in Peter\u2019s desk chair and opening up the textbook he\u2019d placed next to the laptop. Something was off and it was making Peter\u2019s skin crawl more than usual. He looked carefully at the back of Ned\u2019s head, his words only being held back by his teeth and his tight jaw. If he opened his mouth, there would be no stopping. But what the hell, right? Ned was his best friend.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGive her a call,\u201d he said finally, and Ned turned to him with a smile. \u201cIf you think it\u2019ll help, I don\u2019t see why I shouldn\u2019t try.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI hope you know I\u2019m doing this for your own good,\u201d he grinned, pulling his phone out again and looking for her contact. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Peter would always admire just how much his best friend had matured since sophomore year. Sure he still geeked out over Star Wars and comic books (but then again, so did Peter) but there was no doubt in his mind that Ned had simply\u2026 grown. As person, as a best friend, as his guy in the chair; Ned went from nervously helping Peter with whatever ridiculous idea he\u2019d had that week to either fully supporting him or calling him a fucking idiot when he was being one. Ned was the one person he could always count on to be there for him.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey,\u201d he called, his foot on the windowsill and hand gripping the frame, backpack slung lazily over one shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re here if I need you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Ned smiled, tucking his earbuds in and firing up the laptop. \u201cYeah, always.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Peter grinned back, slipping on the mask and throwing up a peace sign before he jumped out the window of his dorm. Luckily, his dorm only faced an alley between the residences and no one was around to see him crawling up the side of the brick. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0When he reached the rooftop, he sat for a moment admiring the autumn sunset, the warm orange hues washing the city with vibrant yet calm energy. Though he knew that this was but a mirage, and New York was nothing if not a complete disaster, he couldn\u2019t help but think of a city at peace. Maybe one day he\u2019d accomplish it, and hang up the webs one last time. But he doubted it\u2019d come any time soon. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPete?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah?\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Ned\u2019s voice was soft through the comm system, and Peter could almost hear the frown on his face. \u201cBe careful, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Peter grinned, his heads up display focusing and zooming in on a group of men standing near the edge of Washing Square Park, a scared looking girl at their feet and trying desperately to back away on her hands. Why were they always stupid enough to assault someone in broad daylight in the middle of a park? They were almost begging for a beating. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0He webbed his backpack to a wall in the alleyway below him, then shot a web at the next roof over and pulled himself forward, landing gracefully on the balls of his feet and using the momentum to launch himself into the air. His head buzzed with the rush of air whizzing past his ears. He flipped once, twice, then landed in a crouch in front of the girl, fingertips on the ground with one arm extended to the side to help his balance, shielding her from the attackers. He could\u2019ve sworn they could see his smirk through the mask, because their faces paled comically. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAlways am.\u201d</p><p>\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cListen, you know that favour you owe me? Yeah, I\u2019d like to cash that in now.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh I\u2019m great, Ned, thanks for asking. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cY/N\u2026.\u201d Ned whined, dragging out the last syllable. \u201cIt\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Y/N laughed, switching her cell phone from her right ear to her left, and pressing it in place with her shoulder as she poured herself a cup of coffee. She finally felt that she had room to breathe now that midterms were over and she had the weekend off from work. The library staff room was warm and cozy despite the chilly November weather, so all she really wanted to do was sit down on the couch with one of the new fiction arrivals that she\u2019d unpacked that afternoon for a good little while, but she\u2019d been interrupted when her phone rang.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0The strong yet comfortable smell of bitter black coffee filled the small room, and she watched as the cream she poured into her mug swirled and mixed with the dark liquid. \u201cAlright, alright. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0She was so positive of the fact that Ned was beaming that she would have bet everything she had on it, and when he spoke she could see his silly smile in her mind\u2019s eye. \u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay, so, you remember Peter, right?\u201d Ned asked, and Y/N frowned as she opened the fridge door to put the cream back. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHaven\u2019t met him but you\u2019ve told me about him,\u201d she said. \u201cChildhood best friend or something, right?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe one and only. Anyway he\u2019s kind of in a tight spot right now.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s failing English.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Y/N smiled knowingly then, settling down on the rather ugly but still surprisingly soft beige couch in the centre of the room, the bright blue mug in her hands warming her to the bone. She knew instantly what the phone call was about and what Ned was going to ask of her, yet she feigned ignorance. Why? For her own amusement, she supposed.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd you called me because\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve been talking about wanting to tutor people on the side\u2026 right? But I figured you might want to test how comfortable you are doing it before you start charging people.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd you\u2019re suggesting that Peter would be my guinea pig?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201c&hellip;Yes, in a way.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIs he okay with that?\u201d she asked, setting her phone down on the small foot table in front of her and putting the phone on speaker. She was all alone in the staff room, and there were only a handful of students and two other staff members in the building at the moment so she wouldn\u2019t need to worry about disturbing anyone. That, and her neck was starting to ache. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Ned\u2019s sigh confirmed her suspicions, that he had somehow convinced Peter into agreeing to being tutored even though he didn\u2019t want to. She wasn\u2019t sure why, but Y/N felt her stomach tug at the thought. But that was ridiculous\u2014she didn\u2019t even know the kid. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI kinda had to beg him,\u201d he admitted rather sheepishly. \u201cHe\u2019s just\u2026 so stubborn and it- it\u2019s infuriating. They\u2019re not gonna let him back next semester if he doesn\u2019t pass this time because he failed both times last year but honestly, I feel like he doesn\u2019t even care.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHmm.\u201d Y/N knew the type of person Peter was just from the little information Ned had just shared with her. He was headstrong and stubborn, but only made time for things he enjoyed and had genuine interest in, which evidently did not include English. \u201cWhat\u2019s he studying right now?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDouble major in Chemistry, and Molecular Biology and Biochemistry.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJesus. That gave me a headache.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI know, gross, right? I always told him he should\u2019ve done Com-Sci like me, and maybe he\u2019d be less stressed, but he never listens to me. He\u2019s actually the smartest person I know when he wants to be, but when he doesn\u2019t\u2026\u201d<br/></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, I get it,\u201d she sighed. \u201cWell, I\u2019m free all weekend if he wants to meet up at the library. I was gonna stay far away from this place since I have a few days off, but I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t abandon my books for too long anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou have no idea how much this means to us, Y/N,\u201d Ned sighed. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d she grinned, mostly to herself though since no one could see her. \u201cI feel like this is more important to you than it is to him, though.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat makes two of us. Hey, can I give him your number?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSure, go ahead. Tell him to text me, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe will. And if he doesn\u2019t, I\u2019ll make him.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Y/N giggled at that, sipping on her coffee and relishing in the warmth that slid down her throat. She dreaded leaving the library and stepping into the cold autumn air. She wanted to stay holed up on that couch forever. \u201cAlright, dude, I gotta go. I\u2019ll never leave if I stay here any longer and I still have to read a couple chapters of a new book tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, for sure. I\u2019ll see you around this week?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy door\u2019s always open for you,\u201d she smiled, knowing that Ned\u2019s dorm room was only a few floors below hers and he\u2019d often pop by to visit her while she studied. \u201cSee ya.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBye, my guy.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Y/N wondered if everyone felt that odd silence after hanging up a phone call, that lingering stillness that felt a little too quiet, especially when she was alone. It made the skin of her arms prickle with goosebumps and she shivered, putting her things back into her backpack and tugging it onto her shoulder. Quickly knocking back the rest of her coffee, she grabbed her scarf off the hook on the wall and laid it lazily around her neck once, still too warm inside the building to put it on properly. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0As she stepped out of the staff room, the warm atmosphere of the library engulfed her once more and she smiled as she stepped toward the main desk. Carol, her boss and the school\u2019s head librarian, was typing away at the computer and busy signing out a laptop to a student. Y/N slid behind the desk, grabbing a copy of the new book she wanted to read and began to sign it out to herself on one of the unoccupied desktops as Carol thanked the student and let him know that he needed to bring the laptop back by the following evening. When she was done, she glanced at Y/N with a smile.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, tell me how that one is,\u201d she said when she saw the book. \u201cIt caught my eye but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll have time to read it. If it\u2019s a worthwhile read, however, I\u2019ll make time.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWill do.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Carol was a kind woman, who looked so stereotypically like a librarian it almost made Y/N laugh when they\u2019d met. Her greying auburn hair was always tied into a tight knot on her head, and her wire-framed glasses were always slipping too far down her nose. She wore cardigans and capris pants almost everyday, and Y/N was pretty sure she only owned one pair of beige shoes. But she was caring and sweet, never shushing anyone when they laughed too loudly or if they swore when they dropped a particularly heavy encyclopedia on their foot. She was one of the main reasons Y/N liked her job so much and never said no when Carol asked her to come in a little bit early or stay a little while longer. She was practically her second mother, and the library was her home away from home. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll see you on Monday, dear?\u201d Carol asked as Y/N picked up her shoulder bag.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo, actually,\u201d she grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll see you this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah.\u201d She looked at her Converse clad feet and the fraying bottom of her pant legs, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. \u201cI\u2019m tutoring a friend of a friend as a favour. He\u2019s failing English and, you know me- I have an obligation to make everyone enjoy literature.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou and I both,\u201d Carol smiled, the crinkles on the outside corners of her eyes folding and making her look like a sweet grandmother (she totally was sweet, though a grandmother only to her cat\u2019s kittens, perhaps). \u201cI do hope you go out and enjoy yourself this weekend, though. Every time I see you, you have your nose stuck in a book. And you know I do encourage that but you should really stretch your legs, go out and have some fun.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI find reading very fun,\u201d Y/N smiled, tucking the book into her bag. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, I\u2019m well aware.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0She turned, walking backwards toward the library doors so she could wave to Carol. \u201cSee you soon then!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll be here, as always,\u201d Carol grinned. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0It was dark when she stepped out of the building, the cold air hitting her like a wall and chilling her to her very core. She hugged her school hoodie around herself, tugging her scarf tighter and tucking it into the collar. The only downfall of studying at Empire State was that since the campus was in the centre of Greenwich, it was spread out over quite a few blocks. It would be a fifteen minute walk back to her dorm building, even if she cut through the park. So Y/N tucked in her earbuds and set off, stuffing her hands into the soft pocket of her hoodie and trying to keep as warm as possible.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0By the time she arrived to her building on 7th Avenue, her fingers were numb as she held the keycard over the sensor. She was sure her nose looked like a cherry tomato with how cold it\u2019d gotten on the walk. Making a mental note to buy herself a pair of mittens for the upcoming winter, she stepped into the elevator and hit the button for the sixth floor. She estimated it to be a little past 10 PM, considering her shift ended at 9:30 and she\u2019d spent some time talking to both Ned and Carol before she left. But luckily, that meant there would be nobody in the common room. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Setting her bag down on the couch in her floor\u2019s common lounge area, she took out the lunch she\u2019d forgotten to eat and sat down with her book resting on her knees and her sandwich in her lap. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0She\u2019d spent so many nights this way, it almost became routine for her now. She nestled into her usual corner, facing the glass walls that allowed her to see out into the hallway and took a bite of her food as she turned to chapter one. She yawned, already used to feeling tired after work and figuring that a good book would help her relax.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0And relax she did.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Y/N was unsure just how much time had passed when she woke with a start, her book clattering to the ground next to her with the movement of her body.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShit,\u201d she muttered, picking it up and making sure that no pages had bent when it hit the ground. She glanced at the clock on the wall. 4:07 AM. God, had she really been there for that long? There was a kink in her neck where it had lolled back in her sleep, and she rubbed it as she took in her surroundings. It seemed like no one had been in the room since she\u2019d arrived. \u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0It wasn\u2019t until she looked up, however, that she really startled.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0There, in the hallway on the other side of the glass, frozen like a deer caught in headlights, stood a boy who looked like he\u2019d been beaten within an inch of his life. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Y/N\u2019s breath caught in her throat as they gazed at each other, both equally shocked. It was then that she realized that it was the sound of him almost falling flat on his face, but catching himself against a wall with a sharp, pained shout before he landed that woke her up. He was still gripping the wall, knuckles white with the sheer force of his grasp, his other arm clutched around his ribs. Neither of them expected the other to be there.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0He looked like he\u2019d been hit by a bus. Or maybe hit by a bus, but then the bus turned around and drove over him another three or four times for good measure. One of his eyes was swollen shut, the skin around and under it beaten blue and purple, and yellowing at the edges. The blood from his crooked nose dripped onto his mouth and chin, down his neck and staining the collar of his t-shirt, which had some ridiculous math pun on it that Y/N would have rolled her eyes at if she hadn\u2019t been so shocked by the state of him. His arms were littered with what looked like bruises in the form of fingers, as if someone had grabbed him and thrown him around. There were cuts and bruises all over the rest of his face, and his short brown hair stuck up at an odd angle as if he\u2019d just taken off a beanie. He wore a backpack that looked like it was one throw to the ground away from ripping at the seams and, for whatever reason, he wasn\u2019t wearing shoes.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0They both sat in silence until he looked away, his shocked eyes then taking on a droopy, tired expression as he limped down the hall, his hand still supporting almost the entire weight of his body against the wall. His bare feet dragged against the hall floor, leaving dirt and blood behind on the linoleum. Y/N choked on her breath as she exhaled, not having noticed that she\u2019d even been holding it. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0What the fuck? What the <i>fuck</i>?</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0She scrambled to her feet, the book now long forgotten as it fell to the floor once again, and she fumbled with the doorknob as it slipped in her sweaty palms. When she finally got the door open, she stared down the hallway in the direction he\u2019d gone, but she was met with nothing but an empty corridor.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Where could he possibly have gone that fast?</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0She stepped carefully and quietly, making sure to keep her footfalls as light as possible, as she walked in the direction she\u2019d seen him go. She passed each door, looking for any sign that he might have been there, when finally she stopped in front of one with blood on the silver handle. Glancing up at the name tag that adorned every door, Y/N swallowed the dry lump in her throat and her eyes widened as she took in the name.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0<i>Peter P. </i></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Oh dear God.

He may have had a headache, but he was pretty sure that his brain wasn\u2019t actually rotting. God, he could almost hear Professor Williams correcting him on the use of the word. How insufferable.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0But that was just more proof, further evidence to back up his (very poor) argument. He couldn\u2019t even use words correctly; how could anyone expect him to pass English? There were so many more important things he could have been focusing on.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Like the fact that that he had finally kind of gotten used to the head rush that came with sitting cross-legged on his ceiling for five hours. He\u2019d been steadily increasing the time he spent up there aimlessly scrolling through his Twitter feed, trying to see how long he could last. It was his own personal experiment of sorts\u2014Peter was a scientist, after all. He had hypothesized that he could only last about three hours at most. But to his surprise he\u2019d managed to go a solid four and a half before he gave out and threw up all over the floor of his dorm, though not before falling into it. His room reeked of bleach and Windex for a week. And after days of hard work and the sheer power of his unrelenting stubbornness, he\u2019d finally managed to go the full five and walk away from it with little more than a headache and seeing a few spots. He wasn\u2019t sure what he could do with this information but he was more than ready to find out. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Those were the kinds of things that occupied the space in Peter\u2019s mind. That and an innumerable amount of calculus formulas and chemical compounds and on and on and on. If he just started writing all the information he stored in that little Parker brain of his, he\u2019d fill an entire collection of encyclopedias without even trying. Now, with that in mind (feel free to groan at that awful joke), did it seem reasonable that he should pay any attention to try and compare two completely different plays from an era that should no longer concern anyone in this day and age on their employment of dramatic irony?</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0If one were as sane as Peter\u2014although he could almost guarantee his sanity was diminishing by the day\u2014they would undoubtedly agree with him when he said absolutely not. But frankly, it wasn\u2019t up to him. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0And so that was how Ned found him: cross-legged on the ceiling, with his back against the wall above his bed, his face as bright as a ripe tomato and with a worried expression that seemed to be carved in stone. But he had every right to freak out. He was failing English. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou know, that\u2019s not gonna help.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Ned dropped his bag on the floor next to the spot on the carpet that was whiter than the rest, and then fell back onto Peter\u2019s bed with a soft grunt, folding his arms under the pillow behind his head and gazing up at his best friend\u2019s face about a foot above him. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNothing helps,\u201d Peter groaned, unfolding his legs and stretching them out along the ceiling, the rough surface catching softly on the denim. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve come to think that maybe ending it all might be my only option.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh yeah, you could do that,\u201d Ned mused, feigning deep thought. \u201cBut then who\u2019d take over for the one and only web-slinger?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGod, I hate it when you have a point.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0As if he actually considered it, even for a second. If there was anything more unbearable to Peter than trying to write about anything even remotely related to his English course, it was the thought of not being around to be the friendly neighbourhood super hero he\u2019d promised to be. He had a city to protect. But it was also a long running joke between them that Peter would one day swing up high over the streets of New York and then neglect to catch himself on the way down. He couldn\u2019t remember when it started. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Peter stood then, stepping a few paces to his left in order to drop off the ceiling without landing on Ned, and with a quick flip he was on the proper side of the world where the normal people were. His head throbbed, all the warmth that had gathered there beginning to flow back down to where it was supposed to be and the pressure behind his eyes subsiding. He glanced at Ned, who had closed his eyes and looked rather peaceful on Peter\u2019s unmade, messy sheets.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo have you thought about what you\u2019re actually gonna do?\u201d he questioned. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Peter sighed. \u201cNothing. That\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna do.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Ned sat up then, looking at him incredulously as if he\u2019d just told him that there were vines sprouting from his ears. \u201cDude, you gotta do something.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSays who?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSays the school. You know English is mandatory, right? They won\u2019t let you enroll next semester if you don\u2019t pass.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo I\u2019ve been told.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Peter peeked at the clock on the small desk across the room, and though it was almost completely obscured by loose papers and notebooks that he never thought to put away, he still saw the bright green block numbers displaying the time. 4:43 PM. Nearly time to go. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0As he rummaged through his school bag looking for the new prototype webbing cartridges he\u2019d designed, he felt Ned\u2019s gaze on him from the way the hairs at the base of his neck stood on end. The feeling that Ned wanted to say something but couldn\u2019t bring himself to was making the air around Peter palpable. He felt the tension on his skin, eyes nearly watering at the way it stung the inside of his nostrils and he detested the way it made his mouth feel like it was stuffed with cotton balls. Though his heightened senses saved him from getting killed on a nearly daily basis, they always seemed to act up at really, really inopportune moments. Such as this one.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0He felt Ned\u2019s words before he heard them.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDo you need help?\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Peter frowned, his brows coming together. \u201cWhat, like a tutor?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, or something like that,\u201d Ned replied. \u201cI\u2019m asking because I know someone, you know, if you ever manage to swallow your pride and accept the fact that you can\u2019t get out of this by yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI believe this is what the kids call \u2018tough love\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Ned looked at him for a long time. Now that he was right side up it was easy to pinpoint all the warning signs that there was something terribly wrong. The bags under Peter\u2019s eyes had always been there; those dark crescent moons etched into the creases there by many nights spent swinging through the streets of the bustling city, stopping crime whenever it had the audacity to crop up, had become a permanent feature on his face. But there was something else, something far more concerning in the way his shoulders stayed perpetually close to his ears, an undeniable tension tugging his entire frame upward as if he was being pulled up by a tight string. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0And when he turned to face Ned once more, the crease between his brows that had been there since he\u2019d been sitting on the ceiling was still present, if not more prominent. He was only nineteen, but Peter was going to end up with wrinkles soon if he didn\u2019t stop frowning all the damn time.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0His expression softened, his features relaxing at his friend\u2019s words. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou look like shit,\u201d Ned continued, though his tone held the same care.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re so frustrating.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Peter smiled, plucking the mask of his suit off his desk and flipping it so it was facing the right way again, hiding the circuits and wires that lined nearly the entirety of the fabric. He brushed his arm across the desk, clearing space and knocking papers, books, pencils, rolls of solder and even a sock to the floor in the process. If looking at him wasn\u2019t proof enough that something had been troubling him, then one only needed to step into the catastrophe that was his dorm. But to be fair, did anyone keep their dorm sparkling? He didn\u2019t think so.<br>\tHe fished the red and blue suit out of the top right corner of his small closet and smoothed it over the area he\u2019d cleared of clutter. Ned watched as he carefully slipped the cartridges into their holders at the hip.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m serious though,\u201d he pressed on, not missing the way Peter\u2019s ears twitched in annoyance. \u201cI\u2019ve got a friend who could help you.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI barely have money to buy food, Ned,\u201d Peter sighed. \u201cI seriously doubt I\u2019d be able to afford a tutor.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShe owes me a favour anyway. She wouldn\u2019t make you pay.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0He turned back to face Ned, eyebrows raised. \u201cWhat makes you think she\u2019d even be willing to help me?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, please.\u201d With a roll of his eyes, Ned reached into his back pocket and pulled out his phone, scrolling through what Peter could only assume was his contact list. \u201cWould I even be friends with someone that cold hearted?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know, last time I checked we were still friends with MJ.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cShe\u2019d punch you if she heard that.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCountin\u2019 on it.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0He held up the suit by the shoulders then, the baggy material looking drab and uninteresting and frankly kind of ridiculous. Throwing it on the bed at Ned\u2019s feet, he tugged the hem of his ESU hoodie up and over his head, his t-shirt and pants coming off shortly after. He discarded the clothes on his floor with little regard as to where they ended up. Ned moved around him as Peter tugged on the loose suit. He set up his laptop on the desk and pulled a textbook out of his backpack. This part of their routine was easy, comfortable even. It had integrated itself into their lives just as easily as everything else did.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Peter tapped the spider emblem on his chest, sucking in a quick breath as the material of the suit formed to his body and hugged his limbs. He turned to grab the mask but found Ned already holding it out to him, a worried expression on his face. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0He took it carefully. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Ned only nodded, swivelling around in Peter\u2019s desk chair and opening up the textbook he\u2019d placed next to the laptop. Something was off and it was making Peter\u2019s skin crawl more than usual. He looked carefully at the back of Ned\u2019s head, his words only being held back by his teeth and his tight jaw. If he opened his mouth, there would be no stopping. But what the hell, right? Ned was his best friend.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGive her a call,\u201d he said finally, and Ned turned to him with a smile. \u201cIf you think it\u2019ll help, I don\u2019t see why I shouldn\u2019t try.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI hope you know I\u2019m doing this for your own good,\u201d he grinned, pulling his phone out again and looking for her contact. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Peter would always admire just how much his best friend had matured since sophomore year. Sure he still geeked out over Star Wars and comic books (but then again, so did Peter) but there was no doubt in his mind that Ned had simply\u2026 grown. As person, as a best friend, as his guy in the chair; Ned went from nervously helping Peter with whatever ridiculous idea he\u2019d had that week to either fully supporting him or calling him a fucking idiot when he was being one. Ned was the one person he could always count on to be there for him.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey,\u201d he called, his foot on the windowsill and hand gripping the frame, backpack slung lazily over one shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re here if I need you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Ned smiled, tucking his earbuds in and firing up the laptop. \u201cYeah, always.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Peter grinned back, slipping on the mask and throwing up a peace sign before he jumped out the window of his dorm. Luckily, his dorm only faced an alley between the residences and no one was around to see him crawling up the side of the brick. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0When he reached the rooftop, he sat for a moment admiring the autumn sunset, the warm orange hues washing the city with vibrant yet calm energy. Though he knew that this was but a mirage, and New York was nothing if not a complete disaster, he couldn\u2019t help but think of a city at peace. Maybe one day he\u2019d accomplish it, and hang up the webs one last time. But he doubted it\u2019d come any time soon. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPete?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah?\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Ned\u2019s voice was soft through the comm system, and Peter could almost hear the frown on his face. \u201cBe careful, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Peter grinned, his heads up display focusing and zooming in on a group of men standing near the edge of Washing Square Park, a scared looking girl at their feet and trying desperately to back away on her hands. Why were they always stupid enough to assault someone in broad daylight in the middle of a park? They were almost begging for a beating. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0He webbed his backpack to a wall in the alleyway below him, then shot a web at the next roof over and pulled himself forward, landing gracefully on the balls of his feet and using the momentum to launch himself into the air. His head buzzed with the rush of air whizzing past his ears. He flipped once, twice, then landed in a crouch in front of the girl, fingertips on the ground with one arm extended to the side to help his balance, shielding her from the attackers. He could\u2019ve sworn they could see his smirk through the mask, because their faces paled comically. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAlways am.\u201d</p><p>\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cListen, you know that favour you owe me? Yeah, I\u2019d like to cash that in now.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh I\u2019m great, Ned, thanks for asking. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cY/N\u2026.\u201d Ned whined, dragging out the last syllable. \u201cIt\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Y/N laughed, switching her cell phone from her right ear to her left, and pressing it in place with her shoulder as she poured herself a cup of coffee. She finally felt that she had room to breathe now that midterms were over and she had the weekend off from work. The library staff room was warm and cozy despite the chilly November weather, so all she really wanted to do was sit down on the couch with one of the new fiction arrivals that she\u2019d unpacked that afternoon for a good little while, but she\u2019d been interrupted when her phone rang.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0The strong yet comfortable smell of bitter black coffee filled the small room, and she watched as the cream she poured into her mug swirled and mixed with the dark liquid. \u201cAlright, alright. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0She was so positive of the fact that Ned was beaming that she would have bet everything she had on it, and when he spoke she could see his silly smile in her mind\u2019s eye. \u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay, so, you remember Peter, right?\u201d Ned asked, and Y/N frowned as she opened the fridge door to put the cream back. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHaven\u2019t met him but you\u2019ve told me about him,\u201d she said. \u201cChildhood best friend or something, right?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe one and only. Anyway he\u2019s kind of in a tight spot right now.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s failing English.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Y/N smiled knowingly then, settling down on the rather ugly but still surprisingly soft beige couch in the centre of the room, the bright blue mug in her hands warming her to the bone. She knew instantly what the phone call was about and what Ned was going to ask of her, yet she feigned ignorance. Why? For her own amusement, she supposed.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd you called me because\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve been talking about wanting to tutor people on the side\u2026 right? But I figured you might want to test how comfortable you are doing it before you start charging people.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd you\u2019re suggesting that Peter would be my guinea pig?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201c\u2026Yes, in a way.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIs he okay with that?\u201d she asked, setting her phone down on the small foot table in front of her and putting the phone on speaker. She was all alone in the staff room, and there were only a handful of students and two other staff members in the building at the moment so she wouldn\u2019t need to worry about disturbing anyone. That, and her neck was starting to ache. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Ned\u2019s sigh confirmed her suspicions, that he had somehow convinced Peter into agreeing to being tutored even though he didn\u2019t want to. She wasn\u2019t sure why, but Y/N felt her stomach tug at the thought. But that was ridiculous\u2014she didn\u2019t even know the kid. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI kinda had to beg him,\u201d he admitted rather sheepishly. \u201cHe\u2019s just\u2026 so stubborn and it- it\u2019s infuriating. They\u2019re not gonna let him back next semester if he doesn\u2019t pass this time because he failed both times last year but honestly, I feel like he doesn\u2019t even care.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHmm.\u201d Y/N knew the type of person Peter was just from the little information Ned had just shared with her. He was headstrong and stubborn, but only made time for things he enjoyed and had genuine interest in, which evidently did not include English. \u201cWhat\u2019s he studying right now?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDouble major in Chemistry, and Molecular Biology and Biochemistry.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJesus. That gave me a headache.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI know, gross, right? I always told him he should\u2019ve done Com-Sci like me, and maybe he\u2019d be less stressed, but he never listens to me. He\u2019s actually the smartest person I know when he wants to be, but when he doesn\u2019t\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, I get it,\u201d she sighed. \u201cWell, I\u2019m free all weekend if he wants to meet up at the library. I was gonna stay far away from this place since I have a few days off, but I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t abandon my books for too long anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou have no idea how much this means to us, Y/N,\u201d Ned sighed. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d she grinned, mostly to herself though since no one could see her. \u201cI feel like this is more important to you than it is to him, though.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat makes two of us. Hey, can I give him your number?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSure, go ahead. Tell him to text me, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe will. And if he doesn\u2019t, I\u2019ll make him.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Y/N giggled at that, sipping on her coffee and relishing in the warmth that slid down her throat. She dreaded leaving the library and stepping into the cold autumn air. She wanted to stay holed up on that couch forever. \u201cAlright, dude, I gotta go. I\u2019ll never leave if I stay here any longer and I still have to read a couple chapters of a new book tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, for sure. I\u2019ll see you around this week?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy door\u2019s always open for you,\u201d she smiled, knowing that Ned\u2019s dorm room was only a few floors below hers and he\u2019d often pop by to visit her while she studied. \u201cSee ya.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBye, my guy.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Y/N wondered if everyone felt that odd silence after hanging up a phone call, that lingering stillness that felt a little too quiet, especially when she was alone. It made the skin of her arms prickle with goosebumps and she shivered, putting her things back into her backpack and tugging it onto her shoulder. Quickly knocking back the rest of her coffee, she grabbed her scarf off the hook on the wall and laid it lazily around her neck once, still too warm inside the building to put it on properly. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0As she stepped out of the staff room, the warm atmosphere of the library engulfed her once more and she smiled as she stepped toward the main desk. Carol, her boss and the school\u2019s head librarian, was typing away at the computer and busy signing out a laptop to a student. Y/N slid behind the desk, grabbing a copy of the new book she wanted to read and began to sign it out to herself on one of the unoccupied desktops as Carol thanked the student and let him know that he needed to bring the laptop back by the following evening. When she was done, she glanced at Y/N with a smile.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, tell me how that one is,\u201d she said when she saw the book. \u201cIt caught my eye but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll have time to read it. If it\u2019s a worthwhile read, however, I\u2019ll make time.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWill do.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Carol was a kind woman, who looked so stereotypically like a librarian it almost made Y/N laugh when they\u2019d met. Her greying auburn hair was always tied into a tight knot on her head, and her wire-framed glasses were always slipping too far down her nose. She wore cardigans and capris pants almost everyday, and Y/N was pretty sure she only owned one pair of beige shoes. But she was caring and sweet, never shushing anyone when they laughed too loudly or if they swore when they dropped a particularly heavy encyclopedia on their foot. She was one of the main reasons Y/N liked her job so much and never said no when Carol asked her to come in a little bit early or stay a little while longer. She was practically her second mother, and the library was her home away from home. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll see you on Monday, dear?\u201d Carol asked as Y/N picked up her shoulder bag.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo, actually,\u201d she grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll see you this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah.\u201d She looked at her Converse clad feet and the fraying bottom of her pant legs, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. \u201cI\u2019m tutoring a friend of a friend as a favour. He\u2019s failing English and, you know me- I have an obligation to make everyone enjoy literature.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou and I both,\u201d Carol smiled, the crinkles on the outside corners of her eyes folding and making her look like a sweet grandmother (she totally was sweet, though a grandmother only to her cat\u2019s kittens, perhaps). \u201cI do hope you go out and enjoy yourself this weekend, though. Every time I see you, you have your nose stuck in a book. And you know I do encourage that but you should really stretch your legs, go out and have some fun.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI find reading very fun,\u201d Y/N smiled, tucking the book into her bag. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, I\u2019m well aware.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0She turned, walking backwards toward the library doors so she could wave to Carol. \u201cSee you soon then!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll be here, as always,\u201d Carol grinned. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0It was dark when she stepped out of the building, the cold air hitting her like a wall and chilling her to her very core. She hugged her school hoodie around herself, tugging her scarf tighter and tucking it into the collar. The only downfall of studying at Empire State was that since the campus was in the centre of Greenwich, it was spread out over quite a few blocks. It would be a fifteen minute walk back to her dorm building, even if she cut through the park. So Y/N tucked in her earbuds and set off, stuffing her hands into the soft pocket of her hoodie and trying to keep as warm as possible.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0By the time she arrived to her building on 7th Avenue, her fingers were numb as she held the keycard over the sensor. She was sure her nose looked like a cherry tomato with how cold it\u2019d gotten on the walk. Making a mental note to buy herself a pair of mittens for the upcoming winter, she stepped into the elevator and hit the button for the sixth floor. She estimated it to be a little past 10 PM, considering her shift ended at 9:30 and she\u2019d spent some time talking to both Ned and Carol before she left. But luckily, that meant there would be nobody in the common room. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Setting her bag down on the couch in her floor\u2019s common lounge area, she took out the lunch she\u2019d forgotten to eat and sat down with her book resting on her knees and her sandwich in her lap. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0She\u2019d spent so many nights this way, it almost became routine for her now. She nestled into her usual corner, facing the glass walls that allowed her to see out into the hallway and took a bite of her food as she turned to chapter one. She yawned, already used to feeling tired after work and figuring that a good book would help her relax.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0And relax she did.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Y/N was unsure just how much time had passed when she woke with a start, her book clattering to the ground next to her with the movement of her body.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShit,\u201d she muttered, picking it up and making sure that no pages had bent when it hit the ground. She glanced at the clock on the wall. 4:07 AM. God, had she really been there for that long? There was a kink in her neck where it had lolled back in her sleep, and she rubbed it as she took in her surroundings. It seemed like no one had been in the room since she\u2019d arrived. \u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0It wasn\u2019t until she looked up, however, that she really startled.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0There, in the hallway on the other side of the glass, frozen like a deer caught in headlights, stood a boy who looked like he\u2019d been beaten within an inch of his life. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Y/N\u2019s breath caught in her throat as they gazed at each other, both equally shocked. It was then that she realized that it was the sound of him almost falling flat on his face, but catching himself against a wall with a sharp, pained shout before he landed that woke her up. He was still gripping the wall, knuckles white with the sheer force of his grasp, his other arm clutched around his ribs. Neither of them expected the other to be there.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0He looked like he\u2019d been hit by a bus. Or maybe hit by a bus, but then the bus turned around and drove over him another three or four times for good measure. One of his eyes was swollen shut, the skin around and under it beaten blue and purple, and yellowing at the edges. The blood from his crooked nose dripped onto his mouth and chin, down his neck and staining the collar of his t-shirt, which had some ridiculous math pun on it that Y/N would have rolled her eyes at if she hadn\u2019t been so shocked by the state of him. His arms were littered with what looked like bruises in the form of fingers, as if someone had grabbed him and thrown him around. There were cuts and bruises all over the rest of his face, and his short brown hair stuck up at an odd angle as if he\u2019d just taken off a beanie. He wore a backpack that looked like it was one throw to the ground away from ripping at the seams and, for whatever reason, he wasn\u2019t wearing shoes.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0They both sat in silence until he looked away, his shocked eyes then taking on a droopy, tired expression as he limped down the hall, his hand still supporting almost the entire weight of his body against the wall. His bare feet dragged against the hall floor, leaving dirt and blood behind on the linoleum. Y/N choked on her breath as she exhaled, not having noticed that she\u2019d even been holding it. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0What the fuck? What the <i>fuck</i>?</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0She scrambled to her feet, the book now long forgotten as it fell to the floor once again, and she fumbled with the doorknob as it slipped in her sweaty palms. When she finally got the door open, she stared down the hallway in the direction he\u2019d gone, but she was met with nothing but an empty corridor.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Where could he possibly have gone that fast?</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0She stepped carefully and quietly, making sure to keep her footfalls as light as possible, as she walked in the direction she\u2019d seen him go. She passed each door, looking for any sign that he might have been there, when finally she stopped in front of one with blood on the silver handle. Glancing up at the name tag that adorned every door, Y/N swallowed the dry lump in her throat and her eyes widened as she took in the name.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0<i>Peter P. </i></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Oh dear God. What the hell did she just herself into?</p><p>\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501</p><p><strike>A/N:</strike> i\u2019m so sorry but this is going to be the slowest slow burn in the history of slow burns, maybe ever. hope ya\u2019ll are into pain.\u00a0</p><p>ALSO i spell everything the <i>canadian way,\u00a0</i>ya know, with ou\u2019s and shit\u2026 if that bothers you then whoOps sorry</p><p><strike>\u2190 previous</strike> | <a href=\"https://raspberryparker.tumblr.com/post/179427234664/someday-series-collegeau-spidey-x-femreader\">series masterlist</a> | <a href=\"http://\">next \u2192</a></p><p>tags: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSNmVB4TPedzr8jjGfAVpFw\">@psychedelicmagnum</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7AGW6l0r5KAlzZjTrCZHMw\">@jazmins-main-hoe</a></p><p><b>message me to be added to a taglist or\u00a0<a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/BhIUjXlYx5Gkgnhy2\">add yourself</a>\u00a0</b>(updates coming steadily through november)<b> or send an ask/comment to give me some feedback! x</b></p></p>",

He may have had a headache, but he was pretty sure that his brain wasn\u2019t actually rotting. God, he could almost hear Professor Williams correcting him on the use of the word. How insufferable.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0But that was just more proof, further evidence to back up his (very poor) argument. He couldn\u2019t even use words correctly; how could anyone expect him to pass English? There were so many more important things he could have been focusing on.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Like the fact that that he had finally kind of gotten used to the head rush that came with sitting cross-legged on his ceiling for five hours. He\u2019d been steadily increasing the time he spent up there aimlessly scrolling through his Twitter feed, trying to see how long he could last. It was his own personal experiment of sorts\u2014Peter was a scientist, after all. He had hypothesized that he could only last about three hours at most. But to his surprise he\u2019d managed to go a solid four and a half before he gave out and threw up all over the floor of his dorm, though not before falling into it. His room reeked of bleach and Windex for a week. And after days of hard work and the sheer power of his unrelenting stubbornness, he\u2019d finally managed to go the full five and walk away from it with little more than a headache and seeing a few spots. He wasn\u2019t sure what he could do with this information but he was more than ready to find out. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Those were the kinds of things that occupied the space in Peter\u2019s mind. That and an innumerable amount of calculus formulas and chemical compounds and on and on and on. If he just started writing all the information he stored in that little Parker brain of his, he\u2019d fill an entire collection of encyclopedias without even trying. Now, with that in mind (feel free to groan at that awful joke), did it seem reasonable that he should pay any attention to try and compare two completely different plays from an era that should no longer concern anyone in this day and age on their employment of dramatic irony?</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0If one were as sane as Peter\u2014although he could almost guarantee his sanity was diminishing by the day\u2014they would undoubtedly agree with him when he said absolutely not. But frankly, it wasn\u2019t up to him. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0And so that was how Ned found him: cross-legged on the ceiling, with his back against the wall above his bed, his face as bright as a ripe tomato and with a worried expression that seemed to be carved in stone. But he had every right to freak out. He was failing English. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou know, that\u2019s not gonna help.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Ned dropped his bag on the floor next to the spot on the carpet that was whiter than the rest, and then fell back onto Peter\u2019s bed with a soft grunt, folding his arms under the pillow behind his head and gazing up at his best friend\u2019s face about a foot above him. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNothing helps,\u201d Peter groaned, unfolding his legs and stretching them out along the ceiling, the rough surface catching softly on the denim. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve come to think that maybe ending it all might be my only option.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh yeah, you could do that,\u201d Ned mused, feigning deep thought. \u201cBut then who\u2019d take over for the one and only web-slinger?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGod, I hate it when you have a point.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0As if he actually considered it, even for a second. If there was anything more unbearable to Peter than trying to write about anything even remotely related to his English course, it was the thought of not being around to be the friendly neighbourhood super hero he\u2019d promised to be. He had a city to protect. But it was also a long running joke between them that Peter would one day swing up high over the streets of New York and then neglect to catch himself on the way down. He couldn\u2019t remember when it started. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Peter stood then, stepping a few paces to his left in order to drop off the ceiling without landing on Ned, and with a quick flip he was on the proper side of the world where the normal people were. His head throbbed, all the warmth that had gathered there beginning to flow back down to where it was supposed to be and the pressure behind his eyes subsiding. He glanced at Ned, who had closed his eyes and looked rather peaceful on Peter\u2019s unmade, messy sheets.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo have you thought about what you\u2019re actually gonna do?\u201d he questioned. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Peter sighed. \u201cNothing. That\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna do.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Ned sat up then, looking at him incredulously as if he\u2019d just told him that there were vines sprouting from his ears. \u201cDude, you gotta do something.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSays who?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSays the school. You know English is mandatory, right? They won\u2019t let you enroll next semester if you don\u2019t pass.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo I\u2019ve been told.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Peter peeked at the clock on the small desk across the room, and though it was almost completely obscured by loose papers and notebooks that he never thought to put away, he still saw the bright green block numbers displaying the time. 4:43 PM. Nearly time to go. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0As he rummaged through his school bag looking for the new prototype webbing cartridges he\u2019d designed, he felt Ned\u2019s gaze on him from the way the hairs at the base of his neck stood on end. The feeling that Ned wanted to say something but couldn\u2019t bring himself to was making the air around Peter palpable. He felt the tension on his skin, eyes nearly watering at the way it stung the inside of his nostrils and he detested the way it made his mouth feel like it was stuffed with cotton balls. Though his heightened senses saved him from getting killed on a nearly daily basis, they always seemed to act up at really, really inopportune moments. Such as this one.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0He felt Ned\u2019s words before he heard them.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDo you need help?\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Peter frowned, his brows coming together. \u201cWhat, like a tutor?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, or something like that,\u201d Ned replied. \u201cI\u2019m asking because I know someone, you know, if you ever manage to swallow your pride and accept the fact that you can\u2019t get out of this by yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI believe this is what the kids call \u2018tough love\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Ned looked at him for a long time. Now that he was right side up it was easy to pinpoint all the warning signs that there was something terribly wrong. The bags under Peter\u2019s eyes had always been there; those dark crescent moons etched into the creases there by many nights spent swinging through the streets of the bustling city, stopping crime whenever it had the audacity to crop up, had become a permanent feature on his face. But there was something else, something far more concerning in the way his shoulders stayed perpetually close to his ears, an undeniable tension tugging his entire frame upward as if he was being pulled up by a tight string. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0And when he turned to face Ned once more, the crease between his brows that had been there since he\u2019d been sitting on the ceiling was still present, if not more prominent. He was only nineteen, but Peter was going to end up with wrinkles soon if he didn\u2019t stop frowning all the damn time.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0His expression softened, his features relaxing at his friend\u2019s words. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou look like shit,\u201d Ned continued, though his tone held the same care.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re so frustrating.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Peter smiled, plucking the mask of his suit off his desk and flipping it so it was facing the right way again, hiding the circuits and wires that lined nearly the entirety of the fabric. He brushed his arm across the desk, clearing space and knocking papers, books, pencils, rolls of solder and even a sock to the floor in the process. If looking at him wasn\u2019t proof enough that something had been troubling him, then one only needed to step into the catastrophe that was his dorm. But to be fair, did anyone keep their dorm sparkling? He didn\u2019t think so.<br>\tHe fished the red and blue suit out of the top right corner of his small closet and smoothed it over the area he\u2019d cleared of clutter. Ned watched as he carefully slipped the cartridges into their holders at the hip.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m serious though,\u201d he pressed on, not missing the way Peter\u2019s ears twitched in annoyance. \u201cI\u2019ve got a friend who could help you.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI barely have money to buy food, Ned,\u201d Peter sighed. \u201cI seriously doubt I\u2019d be able to afford a tutor.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShe owes me a favour anyway. She wouldn\u2019t make you pay.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0He turned back to face Ned, eyebrows raised. \u201cWhat makes you think she\u2019d even be willing to help me?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, please.\u201d With a roll of his eyes, Ned reached into his back pocket and pulled out his phone, scrolling through what Peter could only assume was his contact list. \u201cWould I even be friends with someone that cold hearted?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know, last time I checked we were still friends with MJ.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cShe\u2019d punch you if she heard that.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCountin\u2019 on it.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0He held up the suit by the shoulders then, the baggy material looking drab and uninteresting and frankly kind of ridiculous. Throwing it on the bed at Ned\u2019s feet, he tugged the hem of his ESU hoodie up and over his head, his t-shirt and pants coming off shortly after. He discarded the clothes on his floor with little regard as to where they ended up. Ned moved around him as Peter tugged on the loose suit. He set up his laptop on the desk and pulled a textbook out of his backpack. This part of their routine was easy, comfortable even. It had integrated itself into their lives just as easily as everything else did.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Peter tapped the spider emblem on his chest, sucking in a quick breath as the material of the suit formed to his body and hugged his limbs. He turned to grab the mask but found Ned already holding it out to him, a worried expression on his face. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0He took it carefully. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Ned only nodded, swivelling around in Peter\u2019s desk chair and opening up the textbook he\u2019d placed next to the laptop. Something was off and it was making Peter\u2019s skin crawl more than usual. He looked carefully at the back of Ned\u2019s head, his words only being held back by his teeth and his tight jaw. If he opened his mouth, there would be no stopping. But what the hell, right? Ned was his best friend.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGive her a call,\u201d he said finally, and Ned turned to him with a smile. \u201cIf you think it\u2019ll help, I don\u2019t see why I shouldn\u2019t try.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI hope you know I\u2019m doing this for your own good,\u201d he grinned, pulling his phone out again and looking for her contact. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Peter would always admire just how much his best friend had matured since sophomore year. Sure he still geeked out over Star Wars and comic books (but then again, so did Peter) but there was no doubt in his mind that Ned had simply\u2026 grown. As person, as a best friend, as his guy in the chair; Ned went from nervously helping Peter with whatever ridiculous idea he\u2019d had that week to either fully supporting him or calling him a fucking idiot when he was being one. Ned was the one person he could always count on to be there for him.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey,\u201d he called, his foot on the windowsill and hand gripping the frame, backpack slung lazily over one shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re here if I need you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Ned smiled, tucking his earbuds in and firing up the laptop. \u201cYeah, always.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Peter grinned back, slipping on the mask and throwing up a peace sign before he jumped out the window of his dorm. Luckily, his dorm only faced an alley between the residences and no one was around to see him crawling up the side of the brick. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0When he reached the rooftop, he sat for a moment admiring the autumn sunset, the warm orange hues washing the city with vibrant yet calm energy. Though he knew that this was but a mirage, and New York was nothing if not a complete disaster, he couldn\u2019t help but think of a city at peace. Maybe one day he\u2019d accomplish it, and hang up the webs one last time. But he doubted it\u2019d come any time soon. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPete?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah?\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Ned\u2019s voice was soft through the comm system, and Peter could almost hear the frown on his face. \u201cBe careful, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Peter grinned, his heads up display focusing and zooming in on a group of men standing near the edge of Washing Square Park, a scared looking girl at their feet and trying desperately to back away on her hands. Why were they always stupid enough to assault someone in broad daylight in the middle of a park? They were almost begging for a beating. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0He webbed his backpack to a wall in the alleyway below him, then shot a web at the next roof over and pulled himself forward, landing gracefully on the balls of his feet and using the momentum to launch himself into the air. His head buzzed with the rush of air whizzing past his ears. He flipped once, twice, then landed in a crouch in front of the girl, fingertips on the ground with one arm extended to the side to help his balance, shielding her from the attackers. He could\u2019ve sworn they could see his smirk through the mask, because their faces paled comically. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAlways am.\u201d</p><p>\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cListen, you know that favour you owe me? Yeah, I\u2019d like to cash that in now.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh I\u2019m great, Ned, thanks for asking. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cY/N\u2026.\u201d Ned whined, dragging out the last syllable. \u201cIt\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Y/N laughed, switching her cell phone from her right ear to her left, and pressing it in place with her shoulder as she poured herself a cup of coffee. She finally felt that she had room to breathe now that midterms were over and she had the weekend off from work. The library staff room was warm and cozy despite the chilly November weather, so all she really wanted to do was sit down on the couch with one of the new fiction arrivals that she\u2019d unpacked that afternoon for a good little while, but she\u2019d been interrupted when her phone rang.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0The strong yet comfortable smell of bitter black coffee filled the small room, and she watched as the cream she poured into her mug swirled and mixed with the dark liquid. \u201cAlright, alright. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0She was so positive of the fact that Ned was beaming that she would have bet everything she had on it, and when he spoke she could see his silly smile in her mind\u2019s eye. \u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay, so, you remember Peter, right?\u201d Ned asked, and Y/N frowned as she opened the fridge door to put the cream back. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHaven\u2019t met him but you\u2019ve told me about him,\u201d she said. \u201cChildhood best friend or something, right?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe one and only. Anyway he\u2019s kind of in a tight spot right now.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s failing English.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Y/N smiled knowingly then, settling down on the rather ugly but still surprisingly soft beige couch in the centre of the room, the bright blue mug in her hands warming her to the bone. She knew instantly what the phone call was about and what Ned was going to ask of her, yet she feigned ignorance. Why? For her own amusement, she supposed.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd you called me because\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve been talking about wanting to tutor people on the side\u2026 right? But I figured you might want to test how comfortable you are doing it before you start charging people.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd you\u2019re suggesting that Peter would be my guinea pig?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201c\u2026Yes, in a way.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIs he okay with that?\u201d she asked, setting her phone down on the small foot table in front of her and putting the phone on speaker. She was all alone in the staff room, and there were only a handful of students and two other staff members in the building at the moment so she wouldn\u2019t need to worry about disturbing anyone. That, and her neck was starting to ache. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Ned\u2019s sigh confirmed her suspicions, that he had somehow convinced Peter into agreeing to being tutored even though he didn\u2019t want to. She wasn\u2019t sure why, but Y/N felt her stomach tug at the thought. But that was ridiculous\u2014she didn\u2019t even know the kid. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI kinda had to beg him,\u201d he admitted rather sheepishly. \u201cHe\u2019s just\u2026 so stubborn and it- it\u2019s infuriating. They\u2019re not gonna let him back next semester if he doesn\u2019t pass this time because he failed both times last year but honestly, I feel like he doesn\u2019t even care.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHmm.\u201d Y/N knew the type of person Peter was just from the little information Ned had just shared with her. He was headstrong and stubborn, but only made time for things he enjoyed and had genuine interest in, which evidently did not include English. \u201cWhat\u2019s he studying right now?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDouble major in Chemistry, and Molecular Biology and Biochemistry.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJesus. That gave me a headache.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI know, gross, right? I always told him he should\u2019ve done Com-Sci like me, and maybe he\u2019d be less stressed, but he never listens to me. He\u2019s actually the smartest person I know when he wants to be, but when he doesn\u2019t\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, I get it,\u201d she sighed. \u201cWell, I\u2019m free all weekend if he wants to meet up at the library. I was gonna stay far away from this place since I have a few days off, but I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t abandon my books for too long anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou have no idea how much this means to us, Y/N,\u201d Ned sighed. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d she grinned, mostly to herself though since no one could see her. \u201cI feel like this is more important to you than it is to him, though.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat makes two of us. Hey, can I give him your number?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSure, go ahead. Tell him to text me, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe will. And if he doesn\u2019t, I\u2019ll make him.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Y/N giggled at that, sipping on her coffee and relishing in the warmth that slid down her throat. She dreaded leaving the library and stepping into the cold autumn air. She wanted to stay holed up on that couch forever. \u201cAlright, dude, I gotta go. I\u2019ll never leave if I stay here any longer and I still have to read a couple chapters of a new book tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, for sure. I\u2019ll see you around this week?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy door\u2019s always open for you,\u201d she smiled, knowing that Ned\u2019s dorm room was only a few floors below hers and he\u2019d often pop by to visit her while she studied. \u201cSee ya.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBye, my guy.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Y/N wondered if everyone felt that odd silence after hanging up a phone call, that lingering stillness that felt a little too quiet, especially when she was alone. It made the skin of her arms prickle with goosebumps and she shivered, putting her things back into her backpack and tugging it onto her shoulder. Quickly knocking back the rest of her coffee, she grabbed her scarf off the hook on the wall and laid it lazily around her neck once, still too warm inside the building to put it on properly. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0As she stepped out of the staff room, the warm atmosphere of the library engulfed her once more and she smiled as she stepped toward the main desk. Carol, her boss and the school\u2019s head librarian, was typing away at the computer and busy signing out a laptop to a student. Y/N slid behind the desk, grabbing a copy of the new book she wanted to read and began to sign it out to herself on one of the unoccupied desktops as Carol thanked the student and let him know that he needed to bring the laptop back by the following evening. When she was done, she glanced at Y/N with a smile.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, tell me how that one is,\u201d she said when she saw the book. \u201cIt caught my eye but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll have time to read it. If it\u2019s a worthwhile read, however, I\u2019ll make time.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWill do.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Carol was a kind woman, who looked so stereotypically like a librarian it almost made Y/N laugh when they\u2019d met. Her greying auburn hair was always tied into a tight knot on her head, and her wire-framed glasses were always slipping too far down her nose. She wore cardigans and capris pants almost everyday, and Y/N was pretty sure she only owned one pair of beige shoes. But she was caring and sweet, never shushing anyone when they laughed too loudly or if they swore when they dropped a particularly heavy encyclopedia on their foot. She was one of the main reasons Y/N liked her job so much and never said no when Carol asked her to come in a little bit early or stay a little while longer. She was practically her second mother, and the library was her home away from home. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll see you on Monday, dear?\u201d Carol asked as Y/N picked up her shoulder bag.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo, actually,\u201d she grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll see you this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah.\u201d She looked at her Converse clad feet and the fraying bottom of her pant legs, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. \u201cI\u2019m tutoring a friend of a friend as a favour. He\u2019s failing English and, you know me- I have an obligation to make everyone enjoy literature.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou and I both,\u201d Carol smiled, the crinkles on the outside corners of her eyes folding and making her look like a sweet grandmother (she totally was sweet, though a grandmother only to her cat\u2019s kittens, perhaps). \u201cI do hope you go out and enjoy yourself this weekend, though. Every time I see you, you have your nose stuck in a book. And you know I do encourage that but you should really stretch your legs, go out and have some fun.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI find reading very fun,\u201d Y/N smiled, tucking the book into her bag. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, I\u2019m well aware.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0She turned, walking backwards toward the library doors so she could wave to Carol. \u201cSee you soon then!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll be here, as always,\u201d Carol grinned. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0It was dark when she stepped out of the building, the cold air hitting her like a wall and chilling her to her very core. She hugged her school hoodie around herself, tugging her scarf tighter and tucking it into the collar. The only downfall of studying at Empire State was that since the campus was in the centre of Greenwich, it was spread out over quite a few blocks. It would be a fifteen minute walk back to her dorm building, even if she cut through the park. So Y/N tucked in her earbuds and set off, stuffing her hands into the soft pocket of her hoodie and trying to keep as warm as possible.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0By the time she arrived to her building on 7th Avenue, her fingers were numb as she held the keycard over the sensor. She was sure her nose looked like a cherry tomato with how cold it\u2019d gotten on the walk. Making a mental note to buy herself a pair of mittens for the upcoming winter, she stepped into the elevator and hit the button for the sixth floor. She estimated it to be a little past 10 PM, considering her shift ended at 9:30 and she\u2019d spent some time talking to both Ned and Carol before she left. But luckily, that meant there would be nobody in the common room. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Setting her bag down on the couch in her floor\u2019s common lounge area, she took out the lunch she\u2019d forgotten to eat and sat down with her book resting on her knees and her sandwich in her lap. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0She\u2019d spent so many nights this way, it almost became routine for her now. She nestled into her usual corner, facing the glass walls that allowed her to see out into the hallway and took a bite of her food as she turned to chapter one. She yawned, already used to feeling tired after work and figuring that a good book would help her relax.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0And relax she did.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Y/N was unsure just how much time had passed when she woke with a start, her book clattering to the ground next to her with the movement of her body.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShit,\u201d she muttered, picking it up and making sure that no pages had bent when it hit the ground. She glanced at the clock on the wall. 4:07 AM. God, had she really been there for that long? There was a kink in her neck where it had lolled back in her sleep, and she rubbed it as she took in her surroundings. It seemed like no one had been in the room since she\u2019d arrived. \u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0It wasn\u2019t until she looked up, however, that she really startled.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0There, in the hallway on the other side of the glass, frozen like a deer caught in headlights, stood a boy who looked like he\u2019d been beaten within an inch of his life. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Y/N\u2019s breath caught in her throat as they gazed at each other, both equally shocked. It was then that she realized that it was the sound of him almost falling flat on his face, but catching himself against a wall with a sharp, pained shout before he landed that woke her up. He was still gripping the wall, knuckles white with the sheer force of his grasp, his other arm clutched around his ribs. Neither of them expected the other to be there.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0He looked like he\u2019d been hit by a bus. Or maybe hit by a bus, but then the bus turned around and drove over him another three or four times for good measure. One of his eyes was swollen shut, the skin around and under it beaten blue and purple, and yellowing at the edges. The blood from his crooked nose dripped onto his mouth and chin, down his neck and staining the collar of his t-shirt, which had some ridiculous math pun on it that Y/N would have rolled her eyes at if she hadn\u2019t been so shocked by the state of him. His arms were littered with what looked like bruises in the form of fingers, as if someone had grabbed him and thrown him around. There were cuts and bruises all over the rest of his face, and his short brown hair stuck up at an odd angle as if he\u2019d just taken off a beanie. He wore a backpack that looked like it was one throw to the ground away from ripping at the seams and, for whatever reason, he wasn\u2019t wearing shoes.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0They both sat in silence until he looked away, his shocked eyes then taking on a droopy, tired expression as he limped down the hall, his hand still supporting almost the entire weight of his body against the wall. His bare feet dragged against the hall floor, leaving dirt and blood behind on the linoleum. Y/N choked on her breath as she exhaled, not having noticed that she\u2019d even been holding it. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0What the fuck? What the <i>fuck</i>?</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0She scrambled to her feet, the book now long forgotten as it fell to the floor once again, and she fumbled with the doorknob as it slipped in her sweaty palms. When she finally got the door open, she stared down the hallway in the direction he\u2019d gone, but she was met with nothing but an empty corridor.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Where could he possibly have gone that fast?</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0She stepped carefully and quietly, making sure to keep her footfalls as light as possible, as she walked in the direction she\u2019d seen him go. She passed each door, looking for any sign that he might have been there, when finally she stopped in front of one with blood on the silver handle. Glancing up at the name tag that adorned every door, Y/N swallowed the dry lump in her throat and her eyes widened as she took in the name.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0<i>Peter P. </i></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Oh dear God.

He may have had a headache, but he was pretty sure that his brain wasn&rsquo;t actually rotting. God, he could almost hear Professor Williams correcting him on the use of the word. How insufferable.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;But that was just more proof, further evidence to back up his (very poor) argument. He couldn&rsquo;t even use words correctly; how could anyone expect him to pass English? There were so many more important things he could have been focusing on.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Like the fact that that he had finally kind of gotten used to the head rush that came with sitting cross-legged on his ceiling for five hours. He&rsquo;d been steadily increasing the time he spent up there aimlessly scrolling through his Twitter feed, trying to see how long he could last. It was his own personal experiment of sorts&mdash;Peter was a scientist, after all. He had hypothesized that he could only last about three hours at most. But to his surprise he&rsquo;d managed to go a solid four and a half before he gave out and threw up all over the floor of his dorm, though not before falling into it. His room reeked of bleach and Windex for a week. And after days of hard work and the sheer power of his unrelenting stubbornness, he&rsquo;d finally managed to go the full five and walk away from it with little more than a headache and seeing a few spots. He wasn&rsquo;t sure what he could do with this information but he was more than ready to find out. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Those were the kinds of things that occupied the space in Peter&rsquo;s mind. That and an innumerable amount of calculus formulas and chemical compounds and on and on and on. If he just started writing all the information he stored in that little Parker brain of his, he&rsquo;d fill an entire collection of encyclopedias without even trying. Now, with that in mind (feel free to groan at that awful joke), did it seem reasonable that he should pay any attention to try and compare two completely different plays from an era that should no longer concern anyone in this day and age on their employment of dramatic irony?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;If one were as sane as Peter&mdash;although he could almost guarantee his sanity was diminishing by the day&mdash;they would undoubtedly agree with him when he said absolutely not. But frankly, it wasn&rsquo;t up to him. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;And so that was how Ned found him: cross-legged on the ceiling, with his back against the wall above his bed, his face as bright as a ripe tomato and with a worried expression that seemed to be carved in stone. But he had every right to freak out. He was failing English. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You know, that&rsquo;s not gonna help.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Ned dropped his bag on the floor next to the spot on the carpet that was whiter than the rest, and then fell back onto Peter&rsquo;s bed with a soft grunt, folding his arms under the pillow behind his head and gazing up at his best friend&rsquo;s face about a foot above him. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Nothing helps,&rdquo; Peter groaned, unfolding his legs and stretching them out along the ceiling, the rough surface catching softly on the denim. &ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;ve come to think that maybe ending it all might be my only option.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh yeah, you could do that,&rdquo; Ned mused, feigning deep thought. &ldquo;But then who&rsquo;d take over for the one and only web-slinger?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;God, I hate it when you have a point.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;As if he actually considered it, even for a second. If there was anything more unbearable to Peter than trying to write about anything even remotely related to his English course, it was the thought of not being around to be the friendly neighbourhood super hero he&rsquo;d promised to be. He had a city to protect. But it was also a long running joke between them that Peter would one day swing up high over the streets of New York and then neglect to catch himself on the way down. He couldn&rsquo;t remember when it started. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Peter stood then, stepping a few paces to his left in order to drop off the ceiling without landing on Ned, and with a quick flip he was on the proper side of the world where the normal people were. His head throbbed, all the warmth that had gathered there beginning to flow back down to where it was supposed to be and the pressure behind his eyes subsiding. He glanced at Ned, who had closed his eyes and looked rather peaceful on Peter&rsquo;s unmade, messy sheets.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;So have you thought about what you&rsquo;re actually gonna do?&rdquo; he questioned. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Peter sighed. &ldquo;Nothing. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m gonna do.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Ned sat up then, looking at him incredulously as if he&rsquo;d just told him that there were vines sprouting from his ears. &ldquo;Dude, you gotta do something.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Says who?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Says the school. You know English is mandatory, right? They won&rsquo;t let you enroll next semester if you don&rsquo;t pass.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve been told.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Peter peeked at the clock on the small desk across the room, and though it was almost completely obscured by loose papers and notebooks that he never thought to put away, he still saw the bright green block numbers displaying the time. 4:43 PM. Nearly time to go. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;As he rummaged through his school bag looking for the new prototype webbing cartridges he&rsquo;d designed, he felt Ned&rsquo;s gaze on him from the way the hairs at the base of his neck stood on end. The feeling that Ned wanted to say something but couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to was making the air around Peter palpable. He felt the tension on his skin, eyes nearly watering at the way it stung the inside of his nostrils and he detested the way it made his mouth feel like it was stuffed with cotton balls. Though his heightened senses saved him from getting killed on a nearly daily basis, they always seemed to act up at really, really inopportune moments. Such as this one.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;He felt Ned&rsquo;s words before he heard them.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Do you need help?&rdquo; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Peter frowned, his brows coming together. &ldquo;What, like a tutor?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, or something like that,&rdquo; Ned replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m asking because I know someone, you know, if you ever manage to swallow your pride and accept the fact that you can&rsquo;t get out of this by yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Ouch.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I believe this is what the kids call &lsquo;tough love&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Ned looked at him for a long time. Now that he was right side up it was easy to pinpoint all the warning signs that there was something terribly wrong. The bags under Peter&rsquo;s eyes had always been there; those dark crescent moons etched into the creases there by many nights spent swinging through the streets of the bustling city, stopping crime whenever it had the audacity to crop up, had become a permanent feature on his face. But there was something else, something far more concerning in the way his shoulders stayed perpetually close to his ears, an undeniable tension tugging his entire frame upward as if he was being pulled up by a tight string. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;And when he turned to face Ned once more, the crease between his brows that had been there since he&rsquo;d been sitting on the ceiling was still present, if not more prominent. He was only nineteen, but Peter was going to end up with wrinkles soon if he didn&rsquo;t stop frowning all the damn time.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m worried about you.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;His expression softened, his features relaxing at his friend&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You look like shit,&rdquo; Ned continued, though his tone held the same care.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so frustrating.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; Peter smiled, plucking the mask of his suit off his desk and flipping it so it was facing the right way again, hiding the circuits and wires that lined nearly the entirety of the fabric. He brushed his arm across the desk, clearing space and knocking papers, books, pencils, rolls of solder and even a sock to the floor in the process. If looking at him wasn&rsquo;t proof enough that something had been troubling him, then one only needed to step into the catastrophe that was his dorm. But to be fair, did anyone keep their dorm sparkling? He didn&rsquo;t think so.<br />\tHe fished the red and blue suit out of the top right corner of his small closet and smoothed it over the area he&rsquo;d cleared of clutter. Ned watched as he carefully slipped the cartridges into their holders at the hip.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious though,&rdquo; he pressed on, not missing the way Peter&rsquo;s ears twitched in annoyance. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a friend who could help you.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I barely have money to buy food, Ned,&rdquo; Peter sighed. &ldquo;I seriously doubt I&rsquo;d be able to afford a tutor.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;She owes me a favour anyway. She wouldn&rsquo;t make you pay.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;He turned back to face Ned, eyebrows raised. &ldquo;What makes you think she&rsquo;d even be willing to help me?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, please.&rdquo; With a roll of his eyes, Ned reached into his back pocket and pulled out his phone, scrolling through what Peter could only assume was his contact list. &ldquo;Would I even be friends with someone that cold hearted?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, last time I checked we were still friends with MJ.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;d punch you if she heard that.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Countin&rsquo; on it.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;He held up the suit by the shoulders then, the baggy material looking drab and uninteresting and frankly kind of ridiculous. Throwing it on the bed at Ned&rsquo;s feet, he tugged the hem of his ESU hoodie up and over his head, his t-shirt and pants coming off shortly after. He discarded the clothes on his floor with little regard as to where they ended up. Ned moved around him as Peter tugged on the loose suit. He set up his laptop on the desk and pulled a textbook out of his backpack. This part of their routine was easy, comfortable even. It had integrated itself into their lives just as easily as everything else did.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Peter tapped the spider emblem on his chest, sucking in a quick breath as the material of the suit formed to his body and hugged his limbs. He turned to grab the mask but found Ned already holding it out to him, a worried expression on his face. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;He took it carefully. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Ned only nodded, swivelling around in Peter&rsquo;s desk chair and opening up the textbook he&rsquo;d placed next to the laptop. Something was off and it was making Peter&rsquo;s skin crawl more than usual. He looked carefully at the back of Ned&rsquo;s head, his words only being held back by his teeth and his tight jaw. If he opened his mouth, there would be no stopping. But what the hell, right? Ned was his best friend.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Give her a call,&rdquo; he said finally, and Ned turned to him with a smile. &ldquo;If you think it&rsquo;ll help, I don&rsquo;t see why I shouldn&rsquo;t try.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I hope you know I&rsquo;m doing this for your own good,&rdquo; he grinned, pulling his phone out again and looking for her contact. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Peter would always admire just how much his best friend had matured since sophomore year. Sure he still geeked out over Star Wars and comic books (but then again, so did Peter) but there was no doubt in his mind that Ned had simply&hellip; grown. As person, as a best friend, as his guy in the chair; Ned went from nervously helping Peter with whatever ridiculous idea he&rsquo;d had that week to either fully supporting him or calling him a fucking idiot when he was being one. Ned was the one person he could always count on to be there for him.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he called, his foot on the windowsill and hand gripping the frame, backpack slung lazily over one shoulder. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re here if I need you, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Ned smiled, tucking his earbuds in and firing up the laptop. &ldquo;Yeah, always.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Peter grinned back, slipping on the mask and throwing up a peace sign before he jumped out the window of his dorm. Luckily, his dorm only faced an alley between the residences and no one was around to see him crawling up the side of the brick. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;When he reached the rooftop, he sat for a moment admiring the autumn sunset, the warm orange hues washing the city with vibrant yet calm energy. Though he knew that this was but a mirage, and New York was nothing if not a complete disaster, he couldn&rsquo;t help but think of a city at peace. Maybe one day he&rsquo;d accomplish it, and hang up the webs one last time. But he doubted it&rsquo;d come any time soon. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Pete?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Ned&rsquo;s voice was soft through the comm system, and Peter could almost hear the frown on his face. &ldquo;Be careful, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Peter grinned, his heads up display focusing and zooming in on a group of men standing near the edge of Washing Square Park, a scared looking girl at their feet and trying desperately to back away on her hands. Why were they always stupid enough to assault someone in broad daylight in the middle of a park? They were almost begging for a beating. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;He webbed his backpack to a wall in the alleyway below him, then shot a web at the next roof over and pulled himself forward, landing gracefully on the balls of his feet and using the momentum to launch himself into the air. His head buzzed with the rush of air whizzing past his ears. He flipped once, twice, then landed in a crouch in front of the girl, fingertips on the ground with one arm extended to the side to help his balance, shielding her from the attackers. He could&rsquo;ve sworn they could see his smirk through the mask, because their faces paled comically. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Always am.&rdquo;</p><p>&#9473;&#9473;&#9473;&#9473;&#9473;&#9473;&#9473;&#9473;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Listen, you know that favour you owe me? Yeah, I&rsquo;d like to cash that in now.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m great, Ned, thanks for asking. How are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Y/N&hellip;.&rdquo; Ned whined, dragging out the last syllable. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Y/N laughed, switching her cell phone from her right ear to her left, and pressing it in place with her shoulder as she poured herself a cup of coffee. She finally felt that she had room to breathe now that midterms were over and she had the weekend off from work. The library staff room was warm and cozy despite the chilly November weather, so all she really wanted to do was sit down on the couch with one of the new fiction arrivals that she&rsquo;d unpacked that afternoon for a good little while, but she&rsquo;d been interrupted when her phone rang.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The strong yet comfortable smell of bitter black coffee filled the small room, and she watched as the cream she poured into her mug swirled and mixed with the dark liquid. &ldquo;Alright, alright. What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;She was so positive of the fact that Ned was beaming that she would have bet everything she had on it, and when he spoke she could see his silly smile in her mind&rsquo;s eye. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay, so, you remember Peter, right?&rdquo; Ned asked, and Y/N frowned as she opened the fridge door to put the cream back. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t met him but you&rsquo;ve told me about him,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Childhood best friend or something, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;The one and only. Anyway he&rsquo;s kind of in a tight spot right now.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s failing English.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Y/N smiled knowingly then, settling down on the rather ugly but still surprisingly soft beige couch in the centre of the room, the bright blue mug in her hands warming her to the bone. She knew instantly what the phone call was about and what Ned was going to ask of her, yet she feigned ignorance. Why? For her own amusement, she supposed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;And you called me because&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been talking about wanting to tutor people on the side&hellip; right? But I figured you might want to test how comfortable you are doing it before you start charging people.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re suggesting that Peter would be my guinea pig?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;Yes, in a way.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Is he okay with that?&rdquo; she asked, setting her phone down on the small foot table in front of her and putting the phone on speaker. She was all alone in the staff room, and there were only a handful of students and two other staff members in the building at the moment so she wouldn&rsquo;t need to worry about disturbing anyone. That, and her neck was starting to ache. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Ned&rsquo;s sigh confirmed her suspicions, that he had somehow convinced Peter into agreeing to being tutored even though he didn&rsquo;t want to. She wasn&rsquo;t sure why, but Y/N felt her stomach tug at the thought. But that was ridiculous&mdash;she didn&rsquo;t even know the kid. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I kinda had to beg him,&rdquo; he admitted rather sheepishly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just&hellip; so stubborn and it- it&rsquo;s infuriating. They&rsquo;re not gonna let him back next semester if he doesn&rsquo;t pass this time because he failed both times last year but honestly, I feel like he doesn&rsquo;t even care.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo; Y/N knew the type of person Peter was just from the little information Ned had just shared with her. He was headstrong and stubborn, but only made time for things he enjoyed and had genuine interest in, which evidently did not include English. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s he studying right now?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Double major in Chemistry, and Molecular Biology and Biochemistry.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Jesus. That gave me a headache.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I know, gross, right? I always told him he should&rsquo;ve done Com-Sci like me, and maybe he&rsquo;d be less stressed, but he never listens to me. He&rsquo;s actually the smartest person I know when he wants to be, but when he doesn&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, I get it,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m free all weekend if he wants to meet up at the library. I was gonna stay far away from this place since I have a few days off, but I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t abandon my books for too long anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You have no idea how much this means to us, Y/N,&rdquo; Ned sighed. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, yeah,&rdquo; she grinned, mostly to herself though since no one could see her. &ldquo;I feel like this is more important to you than it is to him, though.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;That makes two of us. Hey, can I give him your number?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Sure, go ahead. Tell him to text me, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;He will. And if he doesn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll make him.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Y/N giggled at that, sipping on her coffee and relishing in the warmth that slid down her throat. She dreaded leaving the library and stepping into the cold autumn air. She wanted to stay holed up on that couch forever. &ldquo;Alright, dude, I gotta go. I&rsquo;ll never leave if I stay here any longer and I still have to read a couple chapters of a new book tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, for sure. I&rsquo;ll see you around this week?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;My door&rsquo;s always open for you,&rdquo; she smiled, knowing that Ned&rsquo;s dorm room was only a few floors below hers and he&rsquo;d often pop by to visit her while she studied. &ldquo;See ya.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Bye, my guy.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Y/N wondered if everyone felt that odd silence after hanging up a phone call, that lingering stillness that felt a little too quiet, especially when she was alone. It made the skin of her arms prickle with goosebumps and she shivered, putting her things back into her backpack and tugging it onto her shoulder. Quickly knocking back the rest of her coffee, she grabbed her scarf off the hook on the wall and laid it lazily around her neck once, still too warm inside the building to put it on properly. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;As she stepped out of the staff room, the warm atmosphere of the library engulfed her once more and she smiled as she stepped toward the main desk. Carol, her boss and the school&rsquo;s head librarian, was typing away at the computer and busy signing out a laptop to a student. Y/N slid behind the desk, grabbing a copy of the new book she wanted to read and began to sign it out to herself on one of the unoccupied desktops as Carol thanked the student and let him know that he needed to bring the laptop back by the following evening. When she was done, she glanced at Y/N with a smile.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, tell me how that one is,&rdquo; she said when she saw the book. &ldquo;It caught my eye but I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;ll have time to read it. If it&rsquo;s a worthwhile read, however, I&rsquo;ll make time.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Will do.&rdquo; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Carol was a kind woman, who looked so stereotypically like a librarian it almost made Y/N laugh when they&rsquo;d met. Her greying auburn hair was always tied into a tight knot on her head, and her wire-framed glasses were always slipping too far down her nose. She wore cardigans and capris pants almost everyday, and Y/N was pretty sure she only owned one pair of beige shoes. But she was caring and sweet, never shushing anyone when they laughed too loudly or if they swore when they dropped a particularly heavy encyclopedia on their foot. She was one of the main reasons Y/N liked her job so much and never said no when Carol asked her to come in a little bit early or stay a little while longer. She was practically her second mother, and the library was her home away from home. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you on Monday, dear?&rdquo; Carol asked as Y/N picked up her shoulder bag.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;No, actually,&rdquo; she grinned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you this weekend.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; She looked at her Converse clad feet and the fraying bottom of her pant legs, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tutoring a friend of a friend as a favour. He&rsquo;s failing English and, you know me- I have an obligation to make everyone enjoy literature.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You and I both,&rdquo; Carol smiled, the crinkles on the outside corners of her eyes folding and making her look like a sweet grandmother (she totally was sweet, though a grandmother only to her cat&rsquo;s kittens, perhaps). &ldquo;I do hope you go out and enjoy yourself this weekend, though. Every time I see you, you have your nose stuck in a book. And you know I do encourage that but you should really stretch your legs, go out and have some fun.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I find reading very fun,&rdquo; Y/N smiled, tucking the book into her bag. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m well aware.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;She turned, walking backwards toward the library doors so she could wave to Carol. &ldquo;See you soon then!&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be here, as always,&rdquo; Carol grinned. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;It was dark when she stepped out of the building, the cold air hitting her like a wall and chilling her to her very core. She hugged her school hoodie around herself, tugging her scarf tighter and tucking it into the collar. The only downfall of studying at Empire State was that since the campus was in the centre of Greenwich, it was spread out over quite a few blocks. It would be a fifteen minute walk back to her dorm building, even if she cut through the park. So Y/N tucked in her earbuds and set off, stuffing her hands into the soft pocket of her hoodie and trying to keep as warm as possible.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;By the time she arrived to her building on 7th Avenue, her fingers were numb as she held the keycard over the sensor. She was sure her nose looked like a cherry tomato with how cold it&rsquo;d gotten on the walk. Making a mental note to buy herself a pair of mittens for the upcoming winter, she stepped into the elevator and hit the button for the sixth floor. She estimated it to be a little past 10 PM, considering her shift ended at 9:30 and she&rsquo;d spent some time talking to both Ned and Carol before she left. But luckily, that meant there would be nobody in the common room. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Setting her bag down on the couch in her floor&rsquo;s common lounge area, she took out the lunch she&rsquo;d forgotten to eat and sat down with her book resting on her knees and her sandwich in her lap. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;She&rsquo;d spent so many nights this way, it almost became routine for her now. She nestled into her usual corner, facing the glass walls that allowed her to see out into the hallway and took a bite of her food as she turned to chapter one. She yawned, already used to feeling tired after work and figuring that a good book would help her relax.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;And relax she did.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Y/N was unsure just how much time had passed when she woke with a start, her book clattering to the ground next to her with the movement of her body.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; she muttered, picking it up and making sure that no pages had bent when it hit the ground. She glanced at the clock on the wall. 4:07 AM. God, had she really been there for that long? There was a kink in her neck where it had lolled back in her sleep, and she rubbed it as she took in her surroundings. It seemed like no one had been in the room since she&rsquo;d arrived. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t until she looked up, however, that she really startled.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;There, in the hallway on the other side of the glass, frozen like a deer caught in headlights, stood a boy who looked like he&rsquo;d been beaten within an inch of his life. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Y/N&rsquo;s breath caught in her throat as they gazed at each other, both equally shocked. It was then that she realized that it was the sound of him almost falling flat on his face, but catching himself against a wall with a sharp, pained shout before he landed that woke her up. He was still gripping the wall, knuckles white with the sheer force of his grasp, his other arm clutched around his ribs. Neither of them expected the other to be there.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;He looked like he&rsquo;d been hit by a bus. Or maybe hit by a bus, but then the bus turned around and drove over him another three or four times for good measure. One of his eyes was swollen shut, the skin around and under it beaten blue and purple, and yellowing at the edges. The blood from his crooked nose dripped onto his mouth and chin, down his neck and staining the collar of his t-shirt, which had some ridiculous math pun on it that Y/N would have rolled her eyes at if she hadn&rsquo;t been so shocked by the state of him. His arms were littered with what looked like bruises in the form of fingers, as if someone had grabbed him and thrown him around. There were cuts and bruises all over the rest of his face, and his short brown hair stuck up at an odd angle as if he&rsquo;d just taken off a beanie. He wore a backpack that looked like it was one throw to the ground away from ripping at the seams and, for whatever reason, he wasn&rsquo;t wearing shoes.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;They both sat in silence until he looked away, his shocked eyes then taking on a droopy, tired expression as he limped down the hall, his hand still supporting almost the entire weight of his body against the wall. His bare feet dragged against the hall floor, leaving dirt and blood behind on the linoleum. Y/N choked on her breath as she exhaled, not having noticed that she&rsquo;d even been holding it. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;What the fuck? What the <i>fuck</i>?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;She scrambled to her feet, the book now long forgotten as it fell to the floor once again, and she fumbled with the doorknob as it slipped in her sweaty palms. When she finally got the door open, she stared down the hallway in the direction he&rsquo;d gone, but she was met with nothing but an empty corridor.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Where could he possibly have gone that fast?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;She stepped carefully and quietly, making sure to keep her footfalls as light as possible, as she walked in the direction she&rsquo;d seen him go. She passed each door, looking for any sign that he might have been there, when finally she stopped in front of one with blood on the silver handle. Glancing up at the name tag that adorned every door, Y/N swallowed the dry lump in her throat and her eyes widened as she took in the name.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<i>Peter P. </i></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Oh dear God.
