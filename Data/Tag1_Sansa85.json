Some people think the feather symbolizes Lyanna, other people think it represents Sansa and yet others claim that it represents Jon\u2019s parentage.</p><p>I\u2019m here to say that <b>the feather actually represents all three options!</b> In itself the feather is just an object, a prop - what it means is completely dependent on the context in which it appears - and when the context changes, so does the meaning of the feather.</p><h2><b>At various moments in the story, the feather symbolizes different things - and it all depends on the context in which it appears!!!!!</b></h2><p>In order to ascertain what the feather might signify in the teaser <i>Aftermath</i>, we\u2019ll have to take a look at the circumstances where it has previously appeared.\u00a0The feather has made appearances in season 1 and 5 as well as in 2 of the promotional teasers for the upcoming season 8.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><h2><b>Season 1</b></h2><p>The feather makes its debut in the very first episode of the show, when the whole story takes its beginning. Immediately after his arrival in Winterfell, King Robert goes with to crypts with Ned Stark to pay his respects the Ned\u2019s late sister Lyanna Stark whose\u00a0\u201cabduction\u201d by Rhaegar Targaryen was one of the events that sparked Robert\u2019s Rebellion, which put an end to the Targaryen dynasty. (Now we know that Lyanna wasn\u2019t really abducted by Rhaegar but this is the official story and what Robert believes).</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"282\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aacad7407fc05b228b109886cb7883f4/tumblr_inline_ppdwzelnrC1uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"282\"/></figure><p>(GIF by Zulzibar)</p><p>Robert has brought the feather of an exotic bird which he places in the hands of Lyanna\u2019s funerary statue. He laments that she is buried in such a dark place and when Ned says the she belongs there because she was a Stark, Robert angrily retorts that she belonged with him. Then Robert says that he kills Rhaegar all over again in his dreams, even after 15 years.</p><p>In this context, the feather represents Robert\u2019s love for Lyanna - and it is thus a symbol both of Lyanna herself but also of his love and his loss, which haunts him to this day.</p><h2><b>Season 5</b></h2><p>The feather reappears in season 5 when Sansa Stark returns to Winterfell to be wed to Ramsay Bolton. Shortly after her arrival, we have a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bfnl9owFc84\">scene</a> where she\u2019s in\u00a0 the crypts, lighting a candle that she places in the hands of Lyanna\u2019s funerary statue, much like Robert placed the feather there. She notices the feather lying at the feet of the statue, picks it up and blows off the dust that have accumulated on it.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/21c0028fb4c1710e891788521c9f1c7e/tumblr_inline_ppdx06Y38A1uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure><p>(GIF by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m61FcucyaOKFkj0gFLKRgJA\">@thelawyerthatwaspromised</a>)</p><p>The showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss explains one of the reasons why they included the feather in this scene:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\n&ldquo;The last time we saw the statue of Lyanna was in the pilot episode,&rdquo; explains series co-creator David Benioff. &ldquo;King Robert Baratheon laid this exotic, tropical bird feather in her hand. As we were preparing the scene [with Sansa], we thought: That feather\u2019s probably still there. People haven&rsquo;t been going down there and cleaning up much. Certainly after Ramsay destroyed Winterfell, there hasn\u2019t been a janitorial crew going down and vacuuming.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;<b>We thought it would be kind of a great thing to have Sansa wondering about it</b>,&rdquo; co-creator D.B. Weiss notes. &ldquo;Hopefully viewers wonder: Where did I see that before? \u2013 and then remember that in the first episode of the show, this is something that Robert left to remember the woman he loved.&rdquo; </i>(<a href=\"http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/sansa-stark-crypts-feather\">Making Game of Thrones</a>)<br/></p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width=\"768\" data-orig-height=\"512\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a9fa744002b5fbf7e75ef46c6d80387d/tumblr_inline_ppdxx7sK4V1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"768\" data-orig-height=\"512\"/></figure><p>Now this sounds like the feather is just a sort of nice little Easter egg for the attentive viewer to remember. However, the context of the scene adds a layer of significance to this little object because the official story of Lyanna\u2019s fate comes to function as a foreshadowing for what happens to Sansa later in season 5.</p><p>Just after she has picked up the feather, Littlefinger intrudes upon Sansa as she pays homage to her dead:</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: <i>Father never talked about her. Sometimes I\u2019d find him down here, lighting the candles. They say she was beautiful.</i></p></blockquote><p>This shows that Sansa didn\u2019t really know much about her aunt who died before she was born. She doesn\u2019t really have a connection with Lyanna but yet she\u2019s down in the crypt lighting a candle to her. Why? The line quoted above subtly tells us that this is Sansa\u2019s way of remembering her father. There\u2019s no statue of Ned in the crypts but she remembers her father lighting candles to her aunt - and so she does the same as a way of remembering him, which is both beautiful and heartbreaking.</p><p>Littlefinger then goes on to tell the story of the Tourney of Harrenhal where Rhaegar first met Lyanna and crowned her Queen of Love and Beauty - causing a scandal. Sansa finishes the story by saying that Rhaegar then kidnapped and raped Lyanna. This shows that while Ned never talked about his sister, her story (or the official version of it) was well known in the North and that Sansa knew about it from other sources. The conversation about Rhaegar and Lyanna also serves as an extremely subtle hint of a big secret (Jon\u2019s parentage) for the discerning viewer, especially one who\u2019s familiar with the books.</p><p><b>As they walk away from Lyanna\u2019s statue, Sansa is still holding the feather!</b> They discuss Littlefinger\u2019s plans for her to end up Wardeness of the North and as he prepares to take his leave of her she says:</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: <i>I expect\u00a0I\u2019ll be a married woman by the time you return.</i></p></blockquote><p>We never see Sansa return the feather to Lyanna\u2019s statue, which I think is important to note!</p><p><b>Within the context of this scene, the feather is obviously connected to Lyanna but it also becomes connected to Sansa</b> more than one way. Firstly, because <b>Lyanna\u2019s fate comes to serve as a dark foreshadowing of things to come for Sansa</b> as she is raped on her wedding night by Ramsay Bolton. This narrative connection between Lyanna and Sansa is further elaborated when Littlefinger serves Lord Rhoyce the lie that Sansa was abducted by the Bolton in season 6. <b>Thus, the official story of Sansa\u2019s presence in the North is one of kidnapping and rape, just like the official story of Lyanna is - and it is used to prompt the Lords of the Vale to go to war for her, just like it prompted Robert and the Starks to go to war for Lyanna.</b></p><p>It is also worth noting that Sansa wears her black, feathered gown during the scene in the crypt. The costume design is important but WHEN the costumes are worn is equally important - and Sansa\u2019s gown also sports feathers dangling from her wrists, which the camera work draws attention to in another scene. Sansa is thus already connected to feathers visually and she has quite a bit of bird imagery as well - she\u2019s been called both Little Dove and Little Bird in King\u2019s Landing. So <b>there\u2019s a visual comparison drawn between Lyanna\u2019s feather and Sansa\u2019s costume.</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1080\" data-orig-height=\"544\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b8ba8605a100c1e6c87ab7d1ace14050/tumblr_inline_ppdxc0qDbG1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1080\" data-orig-height=\"544\"/></figure><p>The there\u2019s the fact that the show draws visual comparisons between Lyanna and Sansa in season 7. Thus, Sansa wears her hair just like Lyanna did during her secret wedding to Rhaegar Targaryen.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dcf4bb483edece30ec79b37a07e30d30/tumblr_inline_ppe2bhchqq1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\"/></figure><p>Furthermore, Lyanna\u2019s wedding gown features a belt that looks very similar to the one that adorned Sansa\u2019s wedding dress in season 3 in the way it cross over her torso and sports an embellished collar. This is NOT a coincidence since costumier Michele Clapton is very particular with her designs and how they support the narrative - and in season 7 she was especially insistent on how each costume detail is symbolic:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>We try to be really <b>symbolic about everything</b> everyone wears now.</i>\u201d (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thisisinsider.com%2Fgame-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-2017-6&amp;t=MWJkZmEyNjEyYTI0NDdiNTMzNTJjYTc4OTFjMjUzNTllODg3YTFiYyxaMGdLU2FadA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183300013819%2Fa-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks&amp;m=1\">Insider</a>) \n\n<br/></p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3030\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f22ad32a4942444ead72e895a7bcdd5b/tumblr_inline_ppg2omdu3j1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3030\"/></figure><p>Thus,<b>\u00a0the show\u00a0creates a subtle connection between Sansa and Lyanna through the costuming and that adds to the way that the feather connects the two characters through the context of the scene in season 5.</b> In light of this we have to ask ourselves WHY?<b>\u00a0</b></p><h2>Why has the show gone out of the way to connect these two characters?</h2><h2><b>Crypts of Winterfell - season 8 Teaser</b></h2><p>The feather makes a third appearance in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA38GCX4Tb0&amp;t=1s\"><i>The Crypts of Winterfell</i></a> teaser for season 8 where we see Jon, Sansa and Arya stride through the crypts of Winterfell only to be confronted with statues of themselves.

In this teaser we see a broken and abandoned Winterfell covered in snow. The Stark direwolf banner is torn and as the camera moves about the ruined castle, we notice objects associated with the main characters: the golden Hand brooch of Tyrion, Arya\u2019s sword Needle, Bran\u2019s wheelchair, Daenerys\u2019 chain of intent, Jaime\u2019s golden hand and Jon\u2019s sword Longclaw. However, we don\u2019t see any object that is obviously associated with Sansa. Yet Lyanna\u2019s feather makes another appearance. Right before we see the feather, we get this shot of the battlements:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1117\" data-orig-height=\"579\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d858de85b7ddf4293514bdffd69c5705/tumblr_inline_ppdx52JYNY1uklhai_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1117\" data-orig-height=\"579\"/></figure><p>This particular place is a place where we\u2019ve seen Sansa several times during seasons 5-7.

In comparison the camera spends only about 3 seconds each on the other character symbols except for Jon\u2019s sword, which the camera lingers on for 9 seconds. <b>This proves that the feather is obviously important.</b></p><p>So does the feather represent Sansa in this teaser? It isn\u2019t a question that can\u2019t be answered conclusively unless the creators either confirm of deny it. However, considering that the battlements is a place especially associated with Sansa, combined with the fact that she was associated with the feather in an earlier scene in season 5 + the visual connection made between her and Lyanna in season 7, <b>I\u2019d argue that there\u2019s a very high possibility that the feather does indeed represent Sansa</b>. But why use Lyanna\u2019s feather and not a more recognizable item, like her necklace, that is more readily associated with Sansa? I don\u2019t really have an answer for that other than the creators have decided to infuse the teaser with some ambiguity and that the Lyanna/Sansa/R+L=J connection that the feather symbolizes will be narratively important in some way.</p><p>Another interesting detail is the fact that the sequence with the feather is placed between the shot of Arya\u2019s Needle and Bran\u2019s wheelchair, which brings to mind the promotional photo shoots where Sansa repeatedly has been placed between Arya and Bran.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6572e537f975c97640d02c6e361bcbd/tumblr_inline_ppdxkzuwXg1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\"/></figure><p>Having the feather land by Bran\u2019s wheelchair also connects it symbolically with Bran, which activates its symbol value as a signifier of Jon\u2019s true parentage since he is one of the only two people who knows the truth of Jon\u2019s parents as of the end of season 7 where he witness the secret wedding of Lyanna and Rhaegar. <b>Thus, the feather comes to symbolize several things at the same time: Sansa as well as Jon\u2019s parentage, also invoking Lyanna by association.</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"3155\" data-orig-height=\"2100\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7c00377e9a9a778c581935357970f28f/tumblr_inline_ppdxpfhfxR1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3155\" data-orig-height=\"2100\"/></figure><p><i>The Crypts of Winterfell</i> teaser invoked the feather as a symbol of Jon\u2019s true parentage and its importance for the narrative.

It is akin to the season 6 <i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmrA8nOZF2Q\">Hall of Faces</a></i> teaser where the faces of both living and dead characters adorn the walls of the temple of the Many-Faced God. it was clearly meant to remind the audience that no character is safe on this show and to make people worry for their favorites.\u00a0</p><p><i>Aftermath</i> serves a similar purpose. It teases a grim future where our heroes lose the War against the Dead, leaving behind a frozen wasteland. It teases the ultimate defeat and the death of all the characters, making us worry just like the <i>Hall of Faces</i> teaser did. There\u2019s no room for politics in this apocalyptic scenario and you have to wonder why the camera takes its time to linger long on an item that symbolizes Jon\u2019s parentage as well as Sansa. You have to wonder why they\u2019ve chosen to put so much focus on this humble feather that is narratively connected to both Lyanna and Sansa as well as serving as a symbol of Jon\u2019s royal heritage.</p>",

Immediately after his arrival in Winterfell, King Robert goes with to crypts with Ned Stark to pay his respects the Ned\u2019s late sister Lyanna Stark whose\u00a0\u201cabduction\u201d by Rhaegar Targaryen was one of the events that sparked Robert\u2019s Rebellion, which put an end to the Targaryen dynasty. (Now we know that Lyanna wasn\u2019t really abducted by Rhaegar but this is the official story and what Robert believes).</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"282\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aacad7407fc05b228b109886cb7883f4/tumblr_inline_ppdwzelnrC1uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"282\"></figure><p>(GIF by Zulzibar)</p><p>Robert has brought the feather of an exotic bird which he places in the hands of Lyanna\u2019s funerary statue. He laments that she is buried in such a dark place and when Ned says the she belongs there because she was a Stark, Robert angrily retorts that she belonged with him. Then Robert says that he kills Rhaegar all over again in his dreams, even after 15 years.</p><p>In this context, the feather represents Robert\u2019s love for Lyanna - and it is thus a symbol both of Lyanna herself but also of his love and his loss, which haunts him to this day.</p><h2><b>Season 5</b></h2><p>The feather reappears in season 5 when Sansa Stark returns to Winterfell to be wed to Ramsay Bolton. Shortly after her arrival, we have a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bfnl9owFc84\">scene</a> where she\u2019s in\u00a0 the crypts, lighting a candle that she places in the hands of Lyanna\u2019s funerary statue, much like Robert placed the feather there. She notices the feather lying at the feet of the statue, picks it up and blows off the dust that have accumulated on it.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/21c0028fb4c1710e891788521c9f1c7e/tumblr_inline_ppdx06Y38A1uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"></figure><p>(GIF by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m61FcucyaOKFkj0gFLKRgJA\">@thelawyerthatwaspromised</a>)</p><p>The showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss explains one of the reasons why they included the feather in this scene:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\n\u201cThe last time we saw the statue of Lyanna was in the pilot episode,\u201d explains series co-creator David Benioff. \u201cKing Robert Baratheon laid this exotic, tropical bird feather in her hand. As we were preparing the scene [with Sansa], we thought: That feather\u2019s probably still there. People haven\u2019t been going down there and cleaning up much. Certainly after Ramsay destroyed Winterfell, there hasn\u2019t been a janitorial crew going down and vacuuming.\u201d<br><br>\u201c<b>We thought it would be kind of a great thing to have Sansa wondering about it</b>,\u201d co-creator D.B. Weiss notes. \u201cHopefully viewers wonder: Where did I see that before? \u2013 and then remember that in the first episode of the show, this is something that Robert left to remember the woman he loved.\u201d </i>(<a href=\"http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/sansa-stark-crypts-feather\">Making Game of Thrones</a>)<br></p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width=\"768\" data-orig-height=\"512\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a9fa744002b5fbf7e75ef46c6d80387d/tumblr_inline_ppdxx7sK4V1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"768\" data-orig-height=\"512\"></figure><p>Now this sounds like the feather is just a sort of nice little Easter egg for the attentive viewer to remember. However, the context of the scene adds a layer of significance to this little object because the official story of Lyanna\u2019s fate comes to function as a foreshadowing for what happens to Sansa later in season 5.</p><p>Just after she has picked up the feather, Littlefinger intrudes upon Sansa as she pays homage to her dead:</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: <i>Father never talked about her. Sometimes I\u2019d find him down here, lighting the candles. They say she was beautiful.</i></p></blockquote><p>This shows that Sansa didn\u2019t really know much about her aunt who died before she was born. She doesn\u2019t really have a connection with Lyanna but yet she\u2019s down in the crypt lighting a candle to her. Why? The line quoted above subtly tells us that this is Sansa\u2019s way of remembering her father. There\u2019s no statue of Ned in the crypts but she remembers her father lighting candles to her aunt - and so she does the same as a way of remembering him, which is both beautiful and heartbreaking.</p><p>Littlefinger then goes on to tell the story of the Tourney of Harrenhal where Rhaegar first met Lyanna and crowned her Queen of Love and Beauty - causing a scandal. Sansa finishes the story by saying that Rhaegar then kidnapped and raped Lyanna. This shows that while Ned never talked about his sister, her story (or the official version of it) was well known in the North and that Sansa knew about it from other sources. The conversation about Rhaegar and Lyanna also serves as an extremely subtle hint of a big secret (Jon\u2019s parentage) for the discerning viewer, especially one who\u2019s familiar with the books.</p><p><b>As they walk away from Lyanna\u2019s statue, Sansa is still holding the feather!</b> They discuss Littlefinger\u2019s plans for her to end up Wardeness of the North and as he prepares to take his leave of her she says:</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: <i>I expect\u00a0I\u2019ll be a married woman by the time you return.</i></p></blockquote><p>We never see Sansa return the feather to Lyanna\u2019s statue, which I think is important to note!</p><p><b>Within the context of this scene, the feather is obviously connected to Lyanna but it also becomes connected to Sansa</b> more than one way. Firstly, because <b>Lyanna\u2019s fate comes to serve as a dark foreshadowing of things to come for Sansa</b> as she is raped on her wedding night by Ramsay Bolton. This narrative connection between Lyanna and Sansa is further elaborated when Littlefinger serves Lord Rhoyce the lie that Sansa was abducted by the Bolton in season 6. <b>Thus, the official story of Sansa\u2019s presence in the North is one of kidnapping and rape, just like the official story of Lyanna is - and it is used to prompt the Lords of the Vale to go to war for her, just like it prompted Robert and the Starks to go to war for Lyanna.</b></p><p>It is also worth noting that Sansa wears her black, feathered gown during the scene in the crypt. The costume design is important but WHEN the costumes are worn is equally important - and Sansa\u2019s gown also sports feathers dangling from her wrists, which the camera work draws attention to in another scene. Sansa is thus already connected to feathers visually and she has quite a bit of bird imagery as well - she\u2019s been called both Little Dove and Little Bird in King\u2019s Landing. So <b>there\u2019s a visual comparison drawn between Lyanna\u2019s feather and Sansa\u2019s costume.</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1080\" data-orig-height=\"544\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b8ba8605a100c1e6c87ab7d1ace14050/tumblr_inline_ppdxc0qDbG1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1080\" data-orig-height=\"544\"></figure><p>The there\u2019s the fact that the show draws visual comparisons between Lyanna and Sansa in season 7. Thus, Sansa wears her hair just like Lyanna did during her secret wedding to Rhaegar Targaryen.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dcf4bb483edece30ec79b37a07e30d30/tumblr_inline_ppe2bhchqq1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\"></figure><p>Furthermore, Lyanna\u2019s wedding gown features a belt that looks very similar to the one that adorned Sansa\u2019s wedding dress in season 3 in the way it cross over her torso and sports an embellished collar. This is NOT a coincidence since costumier Michele Clapton is very particular with her designs and how they support the narrative - and in season 7 she was especially insistent on how each costume detail is symbolic:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>We try to be really <b>symbolic about everything</b> everyone wears now.</i>\u201d (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thisisinsider.com%2Fgame-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-2017-6&amp;t=MWJkZmEyNjEyYTI0NDdiNTMzNTJjYTc4OTFjMjUzNTllODg3YTFiYyxaMGdLU2FadA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183300013819%2Fa-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks&amp;m=1\">Insider</a>) \n\n<br></p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3030\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f22ad32a4942444ead72e895a7bcdd5b/tumblr_inline_ppg2omdu3j1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3030\"></figure><p>Thus,<b>\u00a0the show\u00a0creates a subtle connection between Sansa and Lyanna through the costuming and that adds to the way that the feather connects the two characters through the context of the scene in season 5.</b> In light of this we have to ask ourselves WHY?<b>\u00a0</b></p><h2>Why has the show gone out of the way to connect these two characters?</h2><h2><b>Crypts of Winterfell - season 8 Teaser</b></h2><p>The feather makes a third appearance in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA38GCX4Tb0&amp;t=1s\"><i>The Crypts of Winterfell</i></a> teaser for season 8 where we see Jon, Sansa and Arya stride through the crypts of Winterfell only to be confronted with statues of themselves.

In this teaser we see a broken and abandoned Winterfell covered in snow. The Stark direwolf banner is torn and as the camera moves about the ruined castle, we notice objects associated with the main characters: the golden Hand brooch of Tyrion, Arya\u2019s sword Needle, Bran\u2019s wheelchair, Daenerys\u2019 chain of intent, Jaime\u2019s golden hand and Jon\u2019s sword Longclaw. However, we don\u2019t see any object that is obviously associated with Sansa. Yet Lyanna\u2019s feather makes another appearance. Right before we see the feather, we get this shot of the battlements:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1117\" data-orig-height=\"579\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d858de85b7ddf4293514bdffd69c5705/tumblr_inline_ppdx52JYNY1uklhai_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1117\" data-orig-height=\"579\"></figure><p>This particular place is a place where we\u2019ve seen Sansa several times during seasons 5-7.

I don\u2019t really have an answer for that other than the creators have decided to infuse the teaser with some ambiguity and that the Lyanna/Sansa/R+L=J connection that the feather symbolizes will be narratively important in some way.</p><p>Another interesting detail is the fact that the sequence with the feather is placed between the shot of Arya\u2019s Needle and Bran\u2019s wheelchair, which brings to mind the promotional photo shoots where Sansa repeatedly has been placed between Arya and Bran.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6572e537f975c97640d02c6e361bcbd/tumblr_inline_ppdxkzuwXg1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\"></figure><p>Having the feather land by Bran\u2019s wheelchair also connects it symbolically with Bran, which activates its symbol value as a signifier of Jon\u2019s true parentage since he is one of the only two people who knows the truth of Jon\u2019s parents as of the end of season 7 where he witness the secret wedding of Lyanna and Rhaegar. <b>Thus, the feather comes to symbolize several things at the same time: Sansa as well as Jon\u2019s parentage, also invoking Lyanna by association.</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"3155\" data-orig-height=\"2100\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7c00377e9a9a778c581935357970f28f/tumblr_inline_ppdxpfhfxR1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3155\" data-orig-height=\"2100\"></figure><p><i>The Crypts of Winterfell</i> teaser invoked the feather as a symbol of Jon\u2019s true parentage and its importance for the narrative. It is the most narratively coherent of all the season 8 trailers and it establishes the importance of who Jon really is and hints at what it could mean for him politically (<i>\u201dYou have to protect him\u201d</i>).</p><p>The <i>Aftermath</i> teaser is quite different. It is akin to the season 6 <i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmrA8nOZF2Q\">Hall of Faces</a></i> teaser where the faces of both living and dead characters adorn the walls of the temple of the Many-Faced God. it was clearly meant to remind the audience that no character is safe on this show and to make people worry for their favorites.\u00a0</p><p><i>Aftermath</i> serves a similar purpose. It teases a grim future where our heroes lose the War against the Dead, leaving behind a frozen wasteland. It teases the ultimate defeat and the death of all the characters, making us worry just like the <i>Hall of Faces</i> teaser did. There\u2019s no room for politics in this apocalyptic scenario and you have to wonder why the camera takes its time to linger long on an item that symbolizes Jon\u2019s parentage as well as Sansa. You have to wonder why they\u2019ve chosen to put so much focus on this humble feather that is narratively connected to both Lyanna and Sansa as well as serving as a symbol of Jon\u2019s royal heritage.</p></p>",

Some people think the feather symbolizes Lyanna, other people think it represents Sansa and yet others claim that it represents Jon\u2019s parentage.</p><p>I\u2019m here to say that <b>the feather actually represents all three options!</b> In itself the feather is just an object, a prop - what it means is completely dependent on the context in which it appears - and when the context changes, so does the meaning of the feather.</p><h2><b>At various moments in the story, the feather symbolizes different things - and it all depends on the context in which it appears!!!!!</b></h2><p>In order to ascertain what the feather might signify in the teaser <i>Aftermath</i>, we\u2019ll have to take a look at the circumstances where it has previously appeared.\u00a0The feather has made appearances in season 1 and 5 as well as in 2 of the promotional teasers for the upcoming season 8.\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<h2><b>Season 1</b></h2><p>The feather makes its debut in the very first episode of the show, when the whole story takes its beginning. Immediately after his arrival in Winterfell, King Robert goes with to crypts with Ned Stark to pay his respects the Ned\u2019s late sister Lyanna Stark whose\u00a0\u201cabduction\u201d by Rhaegar Targaryen was one of the events that sparked Robert\u2019s Rebellion, which put an end to the Targaryen dynasty. (Now we know that Lyanna wasn\u2019t really abducted by Rhaegar but this is the official story and what Robert believes).</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"282\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aacad7407fc05b228b109886cb7883f4/tumblr_inline_ppdwzelnrC1uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"282\"></figure><p>(GIF by Zulzibar)</p><p>Robert has brought the feather of an exotic bird which he places in the hands of Lyanna\u2019s funerary statue. He laments that she is buried in such a dark place and when Ned says the she belongs there because she was a Stark, Robert angrily retorts that she belonged with him. Then Robert says that he kills Rhaegar all over again in his dreams, even after 15 years.</p><p>In this context, the feather represents Robert\u2019s love for Lyanna - and it is thus a symbol both of Lyanna herself but also of his love and his loss, which haunts him to this day.</p><h2><b>Season 5</b></h2><p>The feather reappears in season 5 when Sansa Stark returns to Winterfell to be wed to Ramsay Bolton. Shortly after her arrival, we have a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bfnl9owFc84\">scene</a> where she\u2019s in\u00a0 the crypts, lighting a candle that she places in the hands of Lyanna\u2019s funerary statue, much like Robert placed the feather there. She notices the feather lying at the feet of the statue, picks it up and blows off the dust that have accumulated on it.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/21c0028fb4c1710e891788521c9f1c7e/tumblr_inline_ppdx06Y38A1uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"></figure><p>(GIF by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m61FcucyaOKFkj0gFLKRgJA\">@thelawyerthatwaspromised</a>)</p><p>The showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss explains one of the reasons why they included the feather in this scene:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\n\u201cThe last time we saw the statue of Lyanna was in the pilot episode,\u201d explains series co-creator David Benioff. \u201cKing Robert Baratheon laid this exotic, tropical bird feather in her hand. As we were preparing the scene [with Sansa], we thought: That feather\u2019s probably still there. People haven\u2019t been going down there and cleaning up much. Certainly after Ramsay destroyed Winterfell, there hasn\u2019t been a janitorial crew going down and vacuuming.\u201d<br><br>\u201c<b>We thought it would be kind of a great thing to have Sansa wondering about it</b>,\u201d co-creator D.B. Weiss notes. \u201cHopefully viewers wonder: Where did I see that before? \u2013 and then remember that in the first episode of the show, this is something that Robert left to remember the woman he loved.\u201d </i>(<a href=\"http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/sansa-stark-crypts-feather\">Making Game of Thrones</a>)<br></p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width=\"768\" data-orig-height=\"512\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a9fa744002b5fbf7e75ef46c6d80387d/tumblr_inline_ppdxx7sK4V1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"768\" data-orig-height=\"512\"></figure><p>Now this sounds like the feather is just a sort of nice little Easter egg for the attentive viewer to remember. However, the context of the scene adds a layer of significance to this little object because the official story of Lyanna\u2019s fate comes to function as a foreshadowing for what happens to Sansa later in season 5.</p><p>Just after she has picked up the feather, Littlefinger intrudes upon Sansa as she pays homage to her dead:</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: <i>Father never talked about her. Sometimes I\u2019d find him down here, lighting the candles. They say she was beautiful.</i></p></blockquote><p>This shows that Sansa didn\u2019t really know much about her aunt who died before she was born. She doesn\u2019t really have a connection with Lyanna but yet she\u2019s down in the crypt lighting a candle to her. Why? The line quoted above subtly tells us that this is Sansa\u2019s way of remembering her father. There\u2019s no statue of Ned in the crypts but she remembers her father lighting candles to her aunt - and so she does the same as a way of remembering him, which is both beautiful and heartbreaking.</p><p>Littlefinger then goes on to tell the story of the Tourney of Harrenhal where Rhaegar first met Lyanna and crowned her Queen of Love and Beauty - causing a scandal. Sansa finishes the story by saying that Rhaegar then kidnapped and raped Lyanna. This shows that while Ned never talked about his sister, her story (or the official version of it) was well known in the North and that Sansa knew about it from other sources. The conversation about Rhaegar and Lyanna also serves as an extremely subtle hint of a big secret (Jon\u2019s parentage) for the discerning viewer, especially one who\u2019s familiar with the books.</p><p><b>As they walk away from Lyanna\u2019s statue, Sansa is still holding the feather!</b> They discuss Littlefinger\u2019s plans for her to end up Wardeness of the North and as he prepares to take his leave of her she says:</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: <i>I expect\u00a0I\u2019ll be a married woman by the time you return.</i></p></blockquote><p>We never see Sansa return the feather to Lyanna\u2019s statue, which I think is important to note!</p><p><b>Within the context of this scene, the feather is obviously connected to Lyanna but it also becomes connected to Sansa</b> more than one way. Firstly, because <b>Lyanna\u2019s fate comes to serve as a dark foreshadowing of things to come for Sansa</b> as she is raped on her wedding night by Ramsay Bolton. This narrative connection between Lyanna and Sansa is further elaborated when Littlefinger serves Lord Rhoyce the lie that Sansa was abducted by the Bolton in season 6. <b>Thus, the official story of Sansa\u2019s presence in the North is one of kidnapping and rape, just like the official story of Lyanna is - and it is used to prompt the Lords of the Vale to go to war for her, just like it prompted Robert and the Starks to go to war for Lyanna.</b></p><p>It is also worth noting that Sansa wears her black, feathered gown during the scene in the crypt. The costume design is important but WHEN the costumes are worn is equally important - and Sansa\u2019s gown also sports feathers dangling from her wrists, which the camera work draws attention to in another scene. Sansa is thus already connected to feathers visually and she has quite a bit of bird imagery as well - she\u2019s been called both Little Dove and Little Bird in King\u2019s Landing. So <b>there\u2019s a visual comparison drawn between Lyanna\u2019s feather and Sansa\u2019s costume.</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1080\" data-orig-height=\"544\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b8ba8605a100c1e6c87ab7d1ace14050/tumblr_inline_ppdxc0qDbG1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1080\" data-orig-height=\"544\"></figure><p>The there\u2019s the fact that the show draws visual comparisons between Lyanna and Sansa in season 7.

This is NOT a coincidence since costumier Michele Clapton is very particular with her designs and how they support the narrative - and in season 7 she was especially insistent on how each costume detail is symbolic:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>We try to be really <b>symbolic about everything</b> everyone wears now.</i>\u201d (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thisisinsider.com%2Fgame-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-2017-6&amp;t=MWJkZmEyNjEyYTI0NDdiNTMzNTJjYTc4OTFjMjUzNTllODg3YTFiYyxaMGdLU2FadA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183300013819%2Fa-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks&amp;m=1\">Insider</a>) \n\n<br></p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3030\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f22ad32a4942444ead72e895a7bcdd5b/tumblr_inline_ppg2omdu3j1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3030\"></figure><p>Thus,<b>\u00a0the show\u00a0creates a subtle connection between Sansa and Lyanna through the costuming and that adds to the way that the feather connects the two characters through the context of the scene in season 5.</b> In light of this we have to ask ourselves WHY?<b>\u00a0</b></p><h2>Why has the show gone out of the way to connect these two characters?</h2><h2><b>Crypts of Winterfell - season 8 Teaser</b></h2><p>The feather makes a third appearance in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA38GCX4Tb0&amp;t=1s\"><i>The Crypts of Winterfell</i></a> teaser for season 8 where we see Jon, Sansa and Arya stride through the crypts of Winterfell only to be confronted with statues of themselves.

In this teaser we see a broken and abandoned Winterfell covered in snow. The Stark direwolf banner is torn and as the camera moves about the ruined castle, we notice objects associated with the main characters: the golden Hand brooch of Tyrion, Arya\u2019s sword Needle, Bran\u2019s wheelchair, Daenerys\u2019 chain of intent, Jaime\u2019s golden hand and Jon\u2019s sword Longclaw. However, we don\u2019t see any object that is obviously associated with Sansa. Yet Lyanna\u2019s feather makes another appearance. Right before we see the feather, we get this shot of the battlements:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1117\" data-orig-height=\"579\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d858de85b7ddf4293514bdffd69c5705/tumblr_inline_ppdx52JYNY1uklhai_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1117\" data-orig-height=\"579\"></figure><p>This particular place is a place where we\u2019ve seen Sansa several times during seasons 5-7.

                "content": "<p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6735cbbb5d06be72b17005fbce0612ea/tumblr_inline_ppeas63gfJ1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Ever since the <i>Game of Thrones</i> season 8 teaser<i> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwmAWOE5F9o\">Aftermath</a></i> was released people have been debating who or what is represented by the feather that slowly falls from the broken railing on the battlements of Winterfell down to the remains of Bran&rsquo;s wheelchair. Some people think the feather symbolizes Lyanna, other people think it represents Sansa and yet others claim that it represents Jon&rsquo;s parentage.</p><p>I&rsquo;m here to say that <b>the feather actually represents all three options!</b> In itself the feather is just an object, a prop - what it means is completely dependent on the context in which it appears - and when the context changes, so does the meaning of the feather.</p><h2><b>At various moments in the story, the feather symbolizes different things - and it all depends on the context in which it appears!!!!!</b></h2><p>In order to ascertain what the feather might signify in the teaser <i>Aftermath</i>, we&rsquo;ll have to take a look at the circumstances where it has previously appeared.&nbsp;The feather has made appearances in season 1 and 5 as well as in 2 of the promotional teasers for the upcoming season 8.&nbsp;</p><h2><b>Season 1</b></h2><p>The feather makes its debut in the very first episode of the show, when the whole story takes its beginning. Immediately after his arrival in Winterfell, King Robert goes with to crypts with Ned Stark to pay his respects the Ned&rsquo;s late sister Lyanna Stark whose&nbsp;&ldquo;abduction&rdquo; by Rhaegar Targaryen was one of the events that sparked Robert&rsquo;s Rebellion, which put an end to the Targaryen dynasty. (Now we know that Lyanna wasn&rsquo;t really abducted by Rhaegar but this is the official story and what Robert believes).</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aacad7407fc05b228b109886cb7883f4/tumblr_inline_ppdwzelnrC1uklhai_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>(GIF by Zulzibar)</p><p>Robert has brought the feather of an exotic bird which he places in the hands of Lyanna&rsquo;s funerary statue. He laments that she is buried in such a dark place and when Ned says the she belongs there because she was a Stark, Robert angrily retorts that she belonged with him. Then Robert says that he kills Rhaegar all over again in his dreams, even after 15 years.</p><p>In this context, the feather represents Robert&rsquo;s love for Lyanna - and it is thus a symbol both of Lyanna herself but also of his love and his loss, which haunts him to this day.</p><h2><b>Season 5</b></h2><p>The feather reappears in season 5 when Sansa Stark returns to Winterfell to be wed to Ramsay Bolton. Shortly after her arrival, we have a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bfnl9owFc84\">scene</a> where she&rsquo;s in&nbsp; the crypts, lighting a candle that she places in the hands of Lyanna&rsquo;s funerary statue, much like Robert placed the feather there. She notices the feather lying at the feet of the statue, picks it up and blows off the dust that have accumulated on it.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/21c0028fb4c1710e891788521c9f1c7e/tumblr_inline_ppdx06Y38A1uklhai_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>(GIF by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m61FcucyaOKFkj0gFLKRgJA\">@thelawyerthatwaspromised</a>)</p><p>The showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss explains one of the reasons why they included the feather in this scene:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\n&ldquo;The last time we saw the statue of Lyanna was in the pilot episode,&rdquo; explains series co-creator David Benioff. &ldquo;King Robert Baratheon laid this exotic, tropical bird feather in her hand. As we were preparing the scene [with Sansa], we thought: That feather&rsquo;s probably still there. People haven&rsquo;t been going down there and cleaning up much. Certainly after Ramsay destroyed Winterfell, there hasn&rsquo;t been a janitorial crew going down and vacuuming.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;<b>We thought it would be kind of a great thing to have Sansa wondering about it</b>,&rdquo; co-creator D.B. Weiss notes. &ldquo;Hopefully viewers wonder: Where did I see that before? &ndash; and then remember that in the first episode of the show, this is something that Robert left to remember the woman he loved.&rdquo; </i>(<a href=\"http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/sansa-stark-crypts-feather\">Making Game of Thrones</a>)<br /></p></blockquote><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a9fa744002b5fbf7e75ef46c6d80387d/tumblr_inline_ppdxx7sK4V1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Now this sounds like the feather is just a sort of nice little Easter egg for the attentive viewer to remember. However, the context of the scene adds a layer of significance to this little object because the official story of Lyanna&rsquo;s fate comes to function as a foreshadowing for what happens to Sansa later in season 5.</p><p>Just after she has picked up the feather, Littlefinger intrudes upon Sansa as she pays homage to her dead:</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: <i>Father never talked about her. Sometimes I&rsquo;d find him down here, lighting the candles. They say she was beautiful.</i></p></blockquote><p>This shows that Sansa didn&rsquo;t really know much about her aunt who died before she was born. She doesn&rsquo;t really have a connection with Lyanna but yet she&rsquo;s down in the crypt lighting a candle to her. Why? The line quoted above subtly tells us that this is Sansa&rsquo;s way of remembering her father. There&rsquo;s no statue of Ned in the crypts but she remembers her father lighting candles to her aunt - and so she does the same as a way of remembering him, which is both beautiful and heartbreaking.</p><p>Littlefinger then goes on to tell the story of the Tourney of Harrenhal where Rhaegar first met Lyanna and crowned her Queen of Love and Beauty - causing a scandal. Sansa finishes the story by saying that Rhaegar then kidnapped and raped Lyanna. This shows that while Ned never talked about his sister, her story (or the official version of it) was well known in the North and that Sansa knew about it from other sources. The conversation about Rhaegar and Lyanna also serves as an extremely subtle hint of a big secret (Jon&rsquo;s parentage) for the discerning viewer, especially one who&rsquo;s familiar with the books.</p><p><b>As they walk away from Lyanna&rsquo;s statue, Sansa is still holding the feather!</b> They discuss Littlefinger&rsquo;s plans for her to end up Wardeness of the North and as he prepares to take his leave of her she says:</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: <i>I expect&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll be a married woman by the time you return.</i></p></blockquote><p>We never see Sansa return the feather to Lyanna&rsquo;s statue, which I think is important to note!</p><p><b>Within the context of this scene, the feather is obviously connected to Lyanna but it also becomes connected to Sansa</b> more than one way. Firstly, because <b>Lyanna&rsquo;s fate comes to serve as a dark foreshadowing of things to come for Sansa</b> as she is raped on her wedding night by Ramsay Bolton. This narrative connection between Lyanna and Sansa is further elaborated when Littlefinger serves Lord Rhoyce the lie that Sansa was abducted by the Bolton in season 6. <b>Thus, the official story of Sansa&rsquo;s presence in the North is one of kidnapping and rape, just like the official story of Lyanna is - and it is used to prompt the Lords of the Vale to go to war for her, just like it prompted Robert and the Starks to go to war for Lyanna.</b></p><p>It is also worth noting that Sansa wears her black, feathered gown during the scene in the crypt. The costume design is important but WHEN the costumes are worn is equally important - and Sansa&rsquo;s gown also sports feathers dangling from her wrists, which the camera work draws attention to in another scene. Sansa is thus already connected to feathers visually and she has quite a bit of bird imagery as well - she&rsquo;s been called both Little Dove and Little Bird in King&rsquo;s Landing. So <b>there&rsquo;s a visual comparison drawn between Lyanna&rsquo;s feather and Sansa&rsquo;s costume.</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b8ba8605a100c1e6c87ab7d1ace14050/tumblr_inline_ppdxc0qDbG1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The there&rsquo;s the fact that the show draws visual comparisons between Lyanna and Sansa in season 7. Thus, Sansa wears her hair just like Lyanna did during her secret wedding to Rhaegar Targaryen.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dcf4bb483edece30ec79b37a07e30d30/tumblr_inline_ppe2bhchqq1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Furthermore, Lyanna&rsquo;s wedding gown features a belt that looks very similar to the one that adorned Sansa&rsquo;s wedding dress in season 3 in the way it cross over her torso and sports an embellished collar. This is NOT a coincidence since costumier Michele Clapton is very particular with her designs and how they support the narrative - and in season 7 she was especially insistent on how each costume detail is symbolic:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>We try to be really <b>symbolic about everything</b> everyone wears now.</i>&rdquo; (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thisisinsider.com%2Fgame-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-2017-6&amp;t=MWJkZmEyNjEyYTI0NDdiNTMzNTJjYTc4OTFjMjUzNTllODg3YTFiYyxaMGdLU2FadA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183300013819%2Fa-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks&amp;m=1\">Insider</a>) \n\n<br /></p></blockquote><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f22ad32a4942444ead72e895a7bcdd5b/tumblr_inline_ppg2omdu3j1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Thus,<b>&nbsp;the show&nbsp;creates a subtle connection between Sansa and Lyanna through the costuming and that adds to the way that the feather connects the two characters through the context of the scene in season 5.</b> In light of this we have to ask ourselves WHY?<b>&nbsp;</b></p><h2>Why has the show gone out of the way to connect these two characters?</h2><h2><b>Crypts of Winterfell - season 8 Teaser</b></h2><p>The feather makes a third appearance in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA38GCX4Tb0&amp;t=1s\"><i>The Crypts of Winterfell</i></a> teaser for season 8 where we see Jon, Sansa and Arya stride through the crypts of Winterfell only to be confronted with statues of themselves.

However, we don&rsquo;t see any object that is obviously associated with Sansa. Yet Lyanna&rsquo;s feather makes another appearance.

Some people think the feather symbolizes Lyanna, other people think it represents Sansa and yet others claim that it represents Jon&rsquo;s parentage.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m here to say that <b>the feather actually represents all three options!</b> In itself the feather is just an object, a prop - what it means is completely dependent on the context in which it appears - and when the context changes, so does the meaning of the feather.</p>\n<h2><b>At various moments in the story, the feather symbolizes different things - and it all depends on the context in which it appears!!!!!</b></h2>\n<p>In order to ascertain what the feather might signify in the teaser <i>Aftermath</i>, we&rsquo;ll have to take a look at the circumstances where it has previously appeared.&nbsp;The feather has made appearances in season 1 and 5 as well as in 2 of the promotional teasers for the upcoming season 8.&nbsp;</p>\n</p>",
