If I can chip away at it, then it\u2019ll be up tonight!</i>\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>He was glad that the kitchen was\nempty as it gave him a moment to gather himself and his thoughts. He knew he was\nprobably taking a little longer in the kitchen than he actually should, but he\ndidn\u2019t know if that was something he decided to do on purpose to test if you\nwould check on him. Some last ditch attempt to swell his ego before he bottled\nit and chickened out, heading for the door and leaving early.</p><p>You did, check on him that is.\nStanding in the doorway and finding him, alone, pissing about with the\nbottle opener which he couldn\u2019t quite get the hang of. All fingers and\nthumbs as he worked himself up about you.</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d you grabbed his attention,\nafter watching him for a while, causing him to look over his shoulder at you\nseeing where you stood in the kitchen doorway. This was the first time he\u2019d had\na proper chance tonight to admire you, you the same with him.</p><p>You took in his silk shirt and black\ntrousers. Black shoes on his feet that gleamed even in the soft spotlights of\nthe kitchen. \u201cEverything okay?</p><p>The shadows that lined his face\nhighlighted his prominent cheekbones and the way his dimples dented into his\ncheeks somewhat even more so when he was trying to fight a smile.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he scoffed out a slight a\nlaugh through his nose turning back before continuing to try to figure out how\nto open this fresh bottle of white wine.</p><p>Again, he chuckled under his breath,\n\u201cActually, could use a hand.\u201d</p><p>The minute the words left his lips he\nwas trying not to think about how they could be misconstrued cause he could\ndefinitely use a hand in that way too but my god he\u2019s wasn\u2019t going to correct\nhimself. He was going to let it slide. He was going to hope you picked up on\nthe innuendo that was unintended cause the way your legs looked tonight, he\nwanted nothing more than for them to be slung over his shoulders or wrapped\nloosely around his waist as you ravaged each other in the middle of his bed, or\nyours.
