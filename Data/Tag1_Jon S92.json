        "title": "In Love With A Crow",
        "body": "<p>Summary: You\u2019ve been in love with Jon for as long as you can remember, but it doesn\u2019t stop him from joining the watch. When you met back up the love is still there</p><p>Pairing: Jon x Reader</p><p>Warnings: smut, vag penetration, oral(fem recieving)</p><p>You paced back and forth in your room not entirely sure what to do. Jon Snow was leaving to join the night&rsquo;s watch and your heart was breaking at the thought. The two of you had been the best of friends ever since you came to Winterfell. And now he was going to leave without even telling you; you had to hear about it from Robb the night before. &ldquo;What am I suppose to do Jaileen?&rdquo; you asked your handmaiden/best friend.</p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;Either you go tell him how you feel and hope he doesn&rsquo;t leave or you go with him,&rdquo; she replied. You gave her an incredulous look. There was no way you could tell him how you felt, but going with him was just as crazy. &ldquo;What just chop of my hair and pretend to be a man?&rdquo; you asked with a raised brow. When she nodded her head you gestured toward your breasts. &ldquo;And what pray tell am I suppose to do about these?&rdquo; you questioned.</p><p>Jaileen walked over and grabbed some cloth. &ldquo;You could bind them with this,&rdquo; she suggested. You shook your head at her ridiculous plan. &ldquo;<b>I&rsquo;m not gonna throw everything away from someone I&rsquo;m not sure loves me</b>,&rdquo; you told her putting a stop to the idea. She shrugged her shoulders and said, &ldquo;You asked for my advice I gave it, but just so you know he loves you he&rsquo;s just too afraid to admit it.&rdquo;</p><p>Later that day you walked through the courtyard and spotting Jon stormed over to him. You punched him in the shoulder giving him a menacing look. &ldquo;<b>Was that supposed to hurt</b>?&rdquo; he asked. While you could throw a mean punch his furs had cushioned the blow making it almost pointless. &ldquo;<b>Were you ever going to tell me</b>?&rdquo; you questioned. Looking into his grey eyes you could see the quilt swimming in them.</p><p>&ldquo;Listen, Y/N I have to go there&rsquo;s nothing for me here,&rdquo; he said. A lump formed in your throat as you tried to choke back your tears. &ldquo;Are you saying I mean nothing to you,<b> </b>Jon Snow?&rdquo; you asked. His eyes went wide as he pulled you in for a hug. &ldquo;No that&rsquo;s not what I meant and you know it,&rdquo; he replied. You pushed back and looked into his eyes once again. &ldquo;Tell me what I mean to you then,&rdquo; you demanded.</p><p>He sucked in a breath as he searched your face trying to figure out what it was you wanted from him exactly. &ldquo;<b>I&rsquo;ve been in love with you for years. I just never had the guts to tell ya</b>,&rdquo; he finally said. More tears leaked down your face when you realized he was telling the truth. &ldquo;Then why are you leaving?&rdquo; you asked. Jon ran a hand down his face letting out a heavy sigh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a bastard, Y/N. That means nothing more than friendship can ever happen between us,&rdquo; he explained.</p><p>While you knew he was right the truth didn&rsquo;t stop your heart from breaking. You knew nothing you said could convince him to stay. His last name might not have been Stark, but he had honor just like Eddard and he felt this was the only way he could honor his family. You took a step back and bit your lip trying to think of something to say, but nothing would come to you. &ldquo;<b>Stop biting that fucking lip</b>,&rdquo; Jon said catching you off guard.</p><p>&ldquo;Why? Does it bother you?&rdquo; you questioned. He let out a groan and pulled you close pressing his lips to yours. Without hesitating you wrapped your arms around his shoulders and kissed back. When Jon pulled away from you, you whimpered at the loss of contact. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why, Y/N. It drives me crazy and there&rsquo;s nothing I can do about it,&rdquo; he said pushing a piece of hair behind your ear. He stared into your e/c eyes for a few moments longer before letting you go and walking away. That was the last time you would see him for a long time.</p><p>You sat at your desk with your head in your hands and let out a heavy sigh. Jaileen had just informed you that Jon and Sansa had arrived wanting to speak to you. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know what to say to him after all this time,&rdquo; you groaned out running a hand through your hair. &ldquo;Tell him the truth,&rdquo; she replied. You looked at her as if she had grown a second head. &ldquo;Oh yeah that&rsquo;ll be great. Hey Jon it&rsquo;s great to see you so I&rsquo;m not married because my heart still belongs to you. Like that will go over well,&rdquo; you sassed.</p><p>A knock on your door alerted you to Jon and Sansa&rsquo;s presence. &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; you called out. When the door opened the only one there was Jon. You cocked your head in curiosity. Jaileen snickered as she walked out closing the door behind her. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Sansa?&rdquo; you asked. &ldquo;I asked her to let me speak to you alone,&rdquo; he replied. Your heart rate sped up wondering why he would want you alone.</p><p>You gave him a look letting him know he could continue. &ldquo;Listen, Y/N I know I have no right coming in here saying this, but after recent events I realize I need to. I never stopped loving you. I should have never left and I hope you can forgive me,&rdquo; he told you. Tears pooled in the corner of your eyes at his confession. He still loved you and now there was a chance for you. &ldquo;<b>I don&rsquo;t know whether I want to punch you or kiss you</b>,&rdquo; you told him. &ldquo;<b>Can I pick</b>?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>Knowing just which one he would pick you walked around the desk and pulled him toward you. His soft lips pressed against yours letting out all the emotions you had bottled up for years. Jon&rsquo;s tongue darted out to lick your bottom lip and when you granted him access he drank you in like a man deprived of water. You groaned feeling his tongue map out your mouth.</p><p>Sliding your hands under his cloak you pushed it from his shoulders. You then began undoing his leather curiass dropping it to the floor once it was undone. &ldquo;Gods I want you, Jon. You have no idea,&rdquo; you told him when he broke the kiss. He nipped at your earlobe and said, &ldquo;I think I do.&rdquo; His lips trailed kisses down your neck until he reached your collarbone. He undid the laces holding your dress allowing it to pool at your feet.</p><p>His hands then loosened your shift leaving you completely bare before him. &ldquo;Damn you&rsquo;re beautiful,&rdquo; he said as his eyes caressed your body. Jon walked toward you, picked you up and placed you on the edge of the desk. He then kneeled before you. &ldquo;What are y&hellip;&rdquo; you never finished your sentence as his tongue licked you from your entrance to your clit. You gripped the edge of the desk tight as his tongue flicked your clit over and over.</p><p>The pleasure was unlike anything you had ever felt before. You bucked your hips as a coil began tightening in the pit of your stomach. If anyone was to come near the room they would hear you moaning Jon&rsquo;s name like a mantra. He held you in place with one hand while the other dipped into your slick folds to tease your entrance. &ldquo;Please,&rdquo; you moaned out.</p><p>Listening to your plea he slid two fingers in curling them so he could reach that special spot inside. With a few pumps of his fingers the coil sprung loose allowing warmth to wash over you. Your walls clenched around his fingers and your head fell back as your body tensed and quivered. \u00a0When you came down from the high of your orgasm, Jon stood, removed the rest of his clothing, and placed himself between your legs.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you so much, Y/N. Words can&rsquo;t describe how much,&rdquo; he said caressing your sides gently. &ldquo;I love you too, Jon. Always have and always will,&rdquo; you replied placing your hands on top of his. He laced your fingers together as he slowly pushed his cock inside you. The feeling of him stretching you had you tightening your hold on his hands and whimpering.</p><p>Once he was fully in you he leaned forward and pressed his lips to yours in a tender kiss. After you grew accustomed to his cock you wiggled letting him know he could move. Jon&rsquo;s thrusts were slow and languid allowing you to feel every inch of him. The angle he had you in allowed him to rub your clit as well as your sensitive walls. You gripped his forearms tightly when he released your hands to grab your hips.</p><p>Burying your face in his neck you bit and sucked trying to keep your moans to a minimum. However when another orgasm began to build that became easier said than done. &ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; you groaned out gritting your teeth. Jon leaned his head down taking one of your nipples in his mouth and rolling the other between his fingers. The new sensation was all it took to send you over the edge into oblivion. You dug your nails into his arms as your body shook from the intense pleasure.</p><p>Your walls clenching around his cock sent Jon spiraling into his own orgasm. His seed coated you with its warmth making your orgasm last a moment longer. After you came down you unwrapped your legs from around his waist placing your feet on the floor. Jon held you whispering sweet nothings in your ear peppering your neck with kisses. Pulling back he placed a loving kiss upon your lips.</p><p>A moment later his bliss turned into pure panic as he realized he had spilled his seed inside you. &ldquo;Seven hells what if I got you pregnant?&rdquo; he questioned. He pulled completely away from you and began to pace. Standing up you grabbed his hands stopping his movements. &ldquo;So what if you did, Jon we can get married this child won&rsquo;t have your fate if that is what you fear,&rdquo; you told him trying to quell his worry. Looking in your eyes he saw nothing, but love and the truth of your words.</p><p>&ldquo;You would really marry me?&rdquo; he asked. You shook your head amazed that he could even ask such a question. &ldquo;Of course I would. I love you and only you,&rdquo; you replied. He swooped down capturing your lips in another kiss. &ldquo;Now that, that&rsquo;s taken care of why don&rsquo;t you tell me why you and Sansa came here,&rdquo; you said picking your clothes up off the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;We need men to take back Winterfell. We were hoping you would help us,&rdquo; he told you. Tying the laces to your dress you looked up at him with a grin. &ldquo;Nothing would make me happier than to help you defeat that bastard,&rdquo; you said. Ramsay was a deplorable human being and if Jon planned to take him down, you would help the best you could. Jon wrapped his arms around you from behind kissing the side of your neck.</p><p>&ldquo;How many men do you have?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;200,&rdquo; you answered. He pulled away from you and began walking toward the door. You grabbed his hand to stop him pulling him in for one last kiss before he left. &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; you told him letting his hand go. &ldquo;And I love you,&rdquo; he replied opening your door. As he started down the hall you yelled his name. He turned to look at you curiously. &ldquo;Try not to be gone as long this time. We have some catching up to do,&rdquo; you told him with a wink. He nodded his head grinning as he continued his walk.</p>",

And now he was going to leave without even telling you; you had to hear about it from Robb the night before. \u201cWhat am I suppose to do Jaileen?\u201d you asked your handmaiden/best friend.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cEither you go tell him how you feel and hope he doesn\u2019t leave or you go with him,\u201d she replied. You gave her an incredulous look. There was no way you could tell him how you felt, but going with him was just as crazy. \u201cWhat just chop of my hair and pretend to be a man?\u201d you asked with a raised brow. When she nodded her head you gestured toward your breasts. \u201cAnd what pray tell am I suppose to do about these?\u201d you questioned.</p><p>Jaileen walked over and grabbed some cloth. \u201cYou could bind them with this,\u201d she suggested. You shook your head at her ridiculous plan. \u201c<b>I\u2019m not gonna throw everything away from someone I\u2019m not sure loves me</b>,\u201d you told her putting a stop to the idea. She shrugged her shoulders and said, \u201cYou asked for my advice I gave it, but just so you know he loves you he\u2019s just too afraid to admit it.\u201d</p><p>Later that day you walked through the courtyard and spotting Jon stormed over to him. You punched him in the shoulder giving him a menacing look. \u201c<b>Was that supposed to hurt</b>?\u201d he asked. While you could throw a mean punch his furs had cushioned the blow making it almost pointless. \u201c<b>Were you ever going to tell me</b>?\u201d you questioned. Looking into his grey eyes you could see the quilt swimming in them.</p><p>\u201cListen, Y/N I have to go there\u2019s nothing for me here,\u201d he said. A lump formed in your throat as you tried to choke back your tears. \u201cAre you saying I mean nothing to you,<b> </b>Jon Snow?\u201d you asked. His eyes went wide as he pulled you in for a hug. \u201cNo that\u2019s not what I meant and you know it,\u201d he replied. You pushed back and looked into his eyes once again. \u201cTell me what I mean to you then,\u201d you demanded.</p><p>He sucked in a breath as he searched your face trying to figure out what it was you wanted from him exactly. \u201c<b>I\u2019ve been in love with you for years. I just never had the guts to tell ya</b>,\u201d he finally said. More tears leaked down your face when you realized he was telling the truth. \u201cThen why are you leaving?\u201d you asked. Jon ran a hand down his face letting out a heavy sigh. \u201cI\u2019m a bastard, Y/N. That means nothing more than friendship can ever happen between us,\u201d he explained.</p><p>While you knew he was right the truth didn\u2019t stop your heart from breaking. You knew nothing you said could convince him to stay. His last name might not have been Stark, but he had honor just like Eddard and he felt this was the only way he could honor his family. You took a step back and bit your lip trying to think of something to say, but nothing would come to you. \u201c<b>Stop biting that fucking lip</b>,\u201d Jon said catching you off guard.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Does it bother you?\u201d you questioned. He let out a groan and pulled you close pressing his lips to yours. Without hesitating you wrapped your arms around his shoulders and kissed back. When Jon pulled away from you, you whimpered at the loss of contact. \u201cThat\u2019s why, Y/N. It drives me crazy and there\u2019s nothing I can do about it,\u201d he said pushing a piece of hair behind your ear. He stared into your e/c eyes for a few moments longer before letting you go and walking away. That was the last time you would see him for a long time.</p><p>You sat at your desk with your head in your hands and let out a heavy sigh. Jaileen had just informed you that Jon and Sansa had arrived wanting to speak to you. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what to say to him after all this time,\u201d you groaned out running a hand through your hair. \u201cTell him the truth,\u201d she replied. You looked at her as if she had grown a second head. \u201cOh yeah that\u2019ll be great. Hey Jon it\u2019s great to see you so I\u2019m not married because my heart still belongs to you. Like that will go over well,\u201d you sassed.</p><p>A knock on your door alerted you to Jon and Sansa\u2019s presence. \u201cCome in,\u201d you called out. When the door opened the only one there was Jon. You cocked your head in curiosity. Jaileen snickered as she walked out closing the door behind her. \u201cWhere\u2019s Sansa?\u201d you asked. \u201cI asked her to let me speak to you alone,\u201d he replied. Your heart rate sped up wondering why he would want you alone.</p><p>You gave him a look letting him know he could continue. \u201cListen, Y/N I know I have no right coming in here saying this, but after recent events I realize I need to. I never stopped loving you. I should have never left and I hope you can forgive me,\u201d he told you. Tears pooled in the corner of your eyes at his confession. He still loved you and now there was a chance for you. \u201c<b>I don\u2019t know whether I want to punch you or kiss you</b>,\u201d you told him. \u201c<b>Can I pick</b>?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Knowing just which one he would pick you walked around the desk and pulled him toward you. His soft lips pressed against yours letting out all the emotions you had bottled up for years. Jon\u2019s tongue darted out to lick your bottom lip and when you granted him access he drank you in like a man deprived of water. You groaned feeling his tongue map out your mouth.</p><p>Sliding your hands under his cloak you pushed it from his shoulders. You then began undoing his leather curiass dropping it to the floor once it was undone. \u201cGods I want you, Jon. You have no idea,\u201d you told him when he broke the kiss. He nipped at your earlobe and said, \u201cI think I do.\u201d His lips trailed kisses down your neck until he reached your collarbone. He undid the laces holding your dress allowing it to pool at your feet.</p><p>His hands then loosened your shift leaving you completely bare before him. \u201cDamn you\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he said as his eyes caressed your body. Jon walked toward you, picked you up and placed you on the edge of the desk. He then kneeled before you. \u201cWhat are y\u2026\u201d you never finished your sentence as his tongue licked you from your entrance to your clit. You gripped the edge of the desk tight as his tongue flicked your clit over and over.</p><p>The pleasure was unlike anything you had ever felt before. You bucked your hips as a coil began tightening in the pit of your stomach. If anyone was to come near the room they would hear you moaning Jon\u2019s name like a mantra. He held you in place with one hand while the other dipped into your slick folds to tease your entrance. \u201cPlease,\u201d you moaned out.</p><p>Listening to your plea he slid two fingers in curling them so he could reach that special spot inside. With a few pumps of his fingers the coil sprung loose allowing warmth to wash over you. Your walls clenched around his fingers and your head fell back as your body tensed and quivered. \u00a0When you came down from the high of your orgasm, Jon stood, removed the rest of his clothing, and placed himself between your legs.</p><p>\u201cI love you so much, Y/N. Words can\u2019t describe how much,\u201d he said caressing your sides gently. \u201cI love you too, Jon. Always have and always will,\u201d you replied placing your hands on top of his. He laced your fingers together as he slowly pushed his cock inside you. The feeling of him stretching you had you tightening your hold on his hands and whimpering.</p><p>Once he was fully in you he leaned forward and pressed his lips to yours in a tender kiss. After you grew accustomed to his cock you wiggled letting him know he could move. Jon\u2019s thrusts were slow and languid allowing you to feel every inch of him. The angle he had you in allowed him to rub your clit as well as your sensitive walls. You gripped his forearms tightly when he released your hands to grab your hips.</p><p>Burying your face in his neck you bit and sucked trying to keep your moans to a minimum. However when another orgasm began to build that became easier said than done. \u201cFuck,\u201d you groaned out gritting your teeth. Jon leaned his head down taking one of your nipples in his mouth and rolling the other between his fingers. The new sensation was all it took to send you over the edge into oblivion. You dug your nails into his arms as your body shook from the intense pleasure.</p><p>Your walls clenching around his cock sent Jon spiraling into his own orgasm. His seed coated you with its warmth making your orgasm last a moment longer. After you came down you unwrapped your legs from around his waist placing your feet on the floor. Jon held you whispering sweet nothings in your ear peppering your neck with kisses. Pulling back he placed a loving kiss upon your lips.</p><p>A moment later his bliss turned into pure panic as he realized he had spilled his seed inside you. \u201cSeven hells what if I got you pregnant?\u201d he questioned. He pulled completely away from you and began to pace. Standing up you grabbed his hands stopping his movements. \u201cSo what if you did, Jon we can get married this child won\u2019t have your fate if that is what you fear,\u201d you told him trying to quell his worry. Looking in your eyes he saw nothing, but love and the truth of your words.</p><p>\u201cYou would really marry me?\u201d he asked. You shook your head amazed that he could even ask such a question. \u201cOf course I would. I love you and only you,\u201d you replied. He swooped down capturing your lips in another kiss. \u201cNow that, that\u2019s taken care of why don\u2019t you tell me why you and Sansa came here,\u201d you said picking your clothes up off the floor.</p><p>\u201cWe need men to take back Winterfell.

Looking in your eyes he saw nothing, but love and the truth of your words.</p><p>\u201cYou would really marry me?\u201d he asked. You shook your head amazed that he could even ask such a question. \u201cOf course I would. I love you and only you,\u201d you replied. He swooped down capturing your lips in another kiss. \u201cNow that, that\u2019s taken care of why don\u2019t you tell me why you and Sansa came here,\u201d you said picking your clothes up off the floor.</p><p>\u201cWe need men to take back Winterfell. We were hoping you would help us,\u201d he told you. Tying the laces to your dress you looked up at him with a grin. \u201cNothing would make me happier than to help you defeat that bastard,\u201d you said. Ramsay was a deplorable human being and if Jon planned to take him down, you would help the best you could. Jon wrapped his arms around you from behind kissing the side of your neck.</p><p>\u201cHow many men do you have?\u201d he asked. \u201c200,\u201d you answered. He pulled away from you and began walking toward the door. You grabbed his hand to stop him pulling him in for one last kiss before he left. \u201cI love you,\u201d you told him letting his hand go. \u201cAnd I love you,\u201d he replied opening your door. As he started down the hall you yelled his name. He turned to look at you curiously. \u201cTry not to be gone as long this time. We have some catching up to do,\u201d you told him with a wink. He nodded his head grinning as he continued his walk.</p>",
                "content": "<p>Summary: You&rsquo;ve been in love with Jon for as long as you can remember, but it doesn&rsquo;t stop him from joining the watch. When you met back up the love is still there</p><p>Pairing: Jon x Reader</p><p>Warnings: smut, vag penetration, oral(fem recieving)</p><p>You paced back and forth in your room not entirely sure what to do. Jon Snow was leaving to join the night&rsquo;s watch and your heart was breaking at the thought. The two of you had been the best of friends ever since you came to Winterfell. And now he was going to leave without even telling you; you had to hear about it from Robb the night before. &ldquo;What am I suppose to do Jaileen?&rdquo; you asked your handmaiden/best friend.</p><p>&ldquo;Either you go tell him how you feel and hope he doesn&rsquo;t leave or you go with him,&rdquo; she replied. You gave her an incredulous look. There was no way you could tell him how you felt, but going with him was just as crazy. &ldquo;What just chop of my hair and pretend to be a man?&rdquo; you asked with a raised brow. When she nodded her head you gestured toward your breasts. &ldquo;And what pray tell am I suppose to do about these?&rdquo; you questioned.</p><p>Jaileen walked over and grabbed some cloth. &ldquo;You could bind them with this,&rdquo; she suggested. You shook your head at her ridiculous plan. &ldquo;<b>I&rsquo;m not gonna throw everything away from someone I&rsquo;m not sure loves me</b>,&rdquo; you told her putting a stop to the idea. She shrugged her shoulders and said, &ldquo;You asked for my advice I gave it, but just so you know he loves you he&rsquo;s just too afraid to admit it.&rdquo;</p><p>Later that day you walked through the courtyard and spotting Jon stormed over to him. You punched him in the shoulder giving him a menacing look. &ldquo;<b>Was that supposed to hurt</b>?&rdquo; he asked. While you could throw a mean punch his furs had cushioned the blow making it almost pointless. &ldquo;<b>Were you ever going to tell me</b>?&rdquo; you questioned. Looking into his grey eyes you could see the quilt swimming in them.</p><p>&ldquo;Listen, Y/N I have to go there&rsquo;s nothing for me here,&rdquo; he said. A lump formed in your throat as you tried to choke back your tears. &ldquo;Are you saying I mean nothing to you,<b> </b>Jon Snow?&rdquo; you asked. His eyes went wide as he pulled you in for a hug. &ldquo;No that&rsquo;s not what I meant and you know it,&rdquo; he replied. You pushed back and looked into his eyes once again. &ldquo;Tell me what I mean to you then,&rdquo; you demanded.</p><p>He sucked in a breath as he searched your face trying to figure out what it was you wanted from him exactly. &ldquo;<b>I&rsquo;ve been in love with you for years. I just never had the guts to tell ya</b>,&rdquo; he finally said. More tears leaked down your face when you realized he was telling the truth. &ldquo;Then why are you leaving?&rdquo; you asked. Jon ran a hand down his face letting out a heavy sigh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a bastard, Y/N. That means nothing more than friendship can ever happen between us,&rdquo; he explained.</p><p>While you knew he was right the truth didn&rsquo;t stop your heart from breaking. You knew nothing you said could convince him to stay. His last name might not have been Stark, but he had honor just like Eddard and he felt this was the only way he could honor his family. You took a step back and bit your lip trying to think of something to say, but nothing would come to you. &ldquo;<b>Stop biting that fucking lip</b>,&rdquo; Jon said catching you off guard.</p><p>&ldquo;Why? Does it bother you?&rdquo; you questioned. He let out a groan and pulled you close pressing his lips to yours. Without hesitating you wrapped your arms around his shoulders and kissed back. When Jon pulled away from you, you whimpered at the loss of contact. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why, Y/N. It drives me crazy and there&rsquo;s nothing I can do about it,&rdquo; he said pushing a piece of hair behind your ear. He stared into your e/c eyes for a few moments longer before letting you go and walking away. That was the last time you would see him for a long time.</p><p>You sat at your desk with your head in your hands and let out a heavy sigh. Jaileen had just informed you that Jon and Sansa had arrived wanting to speak to you. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know what to say to him after all this time,&rdquo; you groaned out running a hand through your hair. &ldquo;Tell him the truth,&rdquo; she replied. You looked at her as if she had grown a second head. &ldquo;Oh yeah that&rsquo;ll be great. Hey Jon it&rsquo;s great to see you so I&rsquo;m not married because my heart still belongs to you. Like that will go over well,&rdquo; you sassed.</p><p>A knock on your door alerted you to Jon and Sansa&rsquo;s presence. &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; you called out. When the door opened the only one there was Jon. You cocked your head in curiosity. Jaileen snickered as she walked out closing the door behind her. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Sansa?&rdquo; you asked. &ldquo;I asked her to let me speak to you alone,&rdquo; he replied. Your heart rate sped up wondering why he would want you alone.</p><p>You gave him a look letting him know he could continue. &ldquo;Listen, Y/N I know I have no right coming in here saying this, but after recent events I realize I need to. I never stopped loving you. I should have never left and I hope you can forgive me,&rdquo; he told you. Tears pooled in the corner of your eyes at his confession. He still loved you and now there was a chance for you. &ldquo;<b>I don&rsquo;t know whether I want to punch you or kiss you</b>,&rdquo; you told him. &ldquo;<b>Can I pick</b>?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>Knowing just which one he would pick you walked around the desk and pulled him toward you. His soft lips pressed against yours letting out all the emotions you had bottled up for years. Jon&rsquo;s tongue darted out to lick your bottom lip and when you granted him access he drank you in like a man deprived of water. You groaned feeling his tongue map out your mouth.</p><p>Sliding your hands under his cloak you pushed it from his shoulders. You then began undoing his leather curiass dropping it to the floor once it was undone. &ldquo;Gods I want you, Jon. You have no idea,&rdquo; you told him when he broke the kiss. He nipped at your earlobe and said, &ldquo;I think I do.&rdquo; His lips trailed kisses down your neck until he reached your collarbone. He undid the laces holding your dress allowing it to pool at your feet.</p><p>His hands then loosened your shift leaving you completely bare before him. &ldquo;Damn you&rsquo;re beautiful,&rdquo; he said as his eyes caressed your body. Jon walked toward you, picked you up and placed you on the edge of the desk. He then kneeled before you. &ldquo;What are y&hellip;&rdquo; you never finished your sentence as his tongue licked you from your entrance to your clit. You gripped the edge of the desk tight as his tongue flicked your clit over and over.</p><p>The pleasure was unlike anything you had ever felt before. You bucked your hips as a coil began tightening in the pit of your stomach. If anyone was to come near the room they would hear you moaning Jon&rsquo;s name like a mantra. He held you in place with one hand while the other dipped into your slick folds to tease your entrance. &ldquo;Please,&rdquo; you moaned out.</p><p>Listening to your plea he slid two fingers in curling them so he could reach that special spot inside. With a few pumps of his fingers the coil sprung loose allowing warmth to wash over you. Your walls clenched around his fingers and your head fell back as your body tensed and quivered. &nbsp;When you came down from the high of your orgasm, Jon stood, removed the rest of his clothing, and placed himself between your legs.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you so much, Y/N. Words can&rsquo;t describe how much,&rdquo; he said caressing your sides gently. &ldquo;I love you too, Jon. Always have and always will,&rdquo; you replied placing your hands on top of his. He laced your fingers together as he slowly pushed his cock inside you. The feeling of him stretching you had you tightening your hold on his hands and whimpering.</p><p>Once he was fully in you he leaned forward and pressed his lips to yours in a tender kiss. After you grew accustomed to his cock you wiggled letting him know he could move. Jon&rsquo;s thrusts were slow and languid allowing you to feel every inch of him. The angle he had you in allowed him to rub your clit as well as your sensitive walls. You gripped his forearms tightly when he released your hands to grab your hips.</p><p>Burying your face in his neck you bit and sucked trying to keep your moans to a minimum. However when another orgasm began to build that became easier said than done. &ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; you groaned out gritting your teeth. Jon leaned his head down taking one of your nipples in his mouth and rolling the other between his fingers. The new sensation was all it took to send you over the edge into oblivion. You dug your nails into his arms as your body shook from the intense pleasure.</p><p>Your walls clenching around his cock sent Jon spiraling into his own orgasm. His seed coated you with its warmth making your orgasm last a moment longer. After you came down you unwrapped your legs from around his waist placing your feet on the floor. Jon held you whispering sweet nothings in your ear peppering your neck with kisses. Pulling back he placed a loving kiss upon your lips.</p><p>A moment later his bliss turned into pure panic as he realized he had spilled his seed inside you. &ldquo;Seven hells what if I got you pregnant?&rdquo; he questioned. He pulled completely away from you and began to pace. Standing up you grabbed his hands stopping his movements. &ldquo;So what if you did, Jon we can get married this child won&rsquo;t have your fate if that is what you fear,&rdquo; you told him trying to quell his worry. Looking in your eyes he saw nothing, but love and the truth of your words.</p><p>&ldquo;You would really marry me?&rdquo; he asked.
