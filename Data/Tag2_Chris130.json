Everything was going fine..he likes her\u2026</p><p>When Harper gets her bag, he stands and pulls her against him, hugging her close. He whispers in her hair \u201cDon\u2019t go.

It was almost 2 pm when they leave the bed to have lunch and after that, they go to the mountain with his friends to skiing.

Humans are simple creatures by design \u2013 inspired and ruined by the same motivations. It&rsquo;s only when they are aware their voice is heard that feelings like guilt and apology come into play. </p><p>Steve used to think his super hearing, like most of his abilities, was a curse. It forced him to be witness to peoples move private and intimate conversations \u2013 forcing him into strangers lives. Over time, he had to learn how to tune humans out. He was tired of hearing the same things, tired of the anxiety that arose from jumping from one conversation to another. While he believed in the beauty of humanity \u2013 believed that him and his species were worth fighting for \u2013 it was becoming dull to have to listen to the same conversations repeat themselves, to never pinpoint the simpler of solutions. </p><p>That humans were restless and craved conflict.</p><p>He should know. </p><p>It was how he felt 90% of the time. </p><!-- more --><p>So, as he stood in a stadium that had the capacity to hold over 54,000 he had realized the error in his ways. He was trying to find you \u2013 the service on his cell phone had failed him at his current location and the only sure way he knew how to find you in a crowd was to listen for your voice. But to listen for your voice meant he had to jump into the world of the thousands of people around him and his brain was feeling overstimulated, not used to ingesting so much stimulation and data at once, not since he trained it to do otherwise in social situations like this. Between the yelling and screaming and laughing \u2013 the people who were moving past him quickly and brushing against his body he felt like screaming, like bursting out and finding safety at higher ground.</p><p>It was how he felt back when breathing felt like a chore and the only time girls laid eyes on him was when they realized he was Bucky\u2019s sad best friend. </p><p>Being in crowds made him insecure. Which is why he preferred to watch from the wings. </p><p>He looked down at his screen, trying to see if the text he typed for you was sent but his phone was still doing that circling thing that Bucky called the wheel of death, so he assumed not. </p><p>He should have been more specific. Texting was more of a chore than a convenience. </p><p>He had given in to finally getting the writing service on his phone, right after he had made amends with you in your office. He had immediately asked Bucky to meet him at the cell phone store he had purchased his flip phone at to get texting put on the older device. Which had caused Bucky to guffaw because he really needed a new phone but Steve was insistent on keeping his old one and Bucky wasn\u2019t going to argue against it for the uptenth time again. So he patiently helped Steve figure out the simple buttons to send you a text, which had been a bust the next day when he was ready to send you a message.</p><p>It was Sam that stood next to him after their morning training, patiently helping \u00a0him click out the words over stiff buttons to send off to you,</p><p>I have texting on my phone so I can be better at staying in touch with you. How is your day?</p><p>The message had taken him an ashamedly twenty minutes to get out but he did, hearing from you immediately. The week continued with that cadence, you texting him goodnight and him texting you good morning. Finding opportunities to get to know each other a bit more, your texts coming in long paragraphs that his phone broke up in 5 pages while he sent multiple smaller texts, frustrated with the machine. So when you had texted him earlier that afternoon with the simple message of,</p><p>Excited to see you tonight! Yankee\u2019s Stadium, 6pm. SW entrance</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought to follow up to ask which southwest entrance. There were at least four, and they were all crowded and similar and he was feeling anxious trying to find you among the waves and waves of people walking in.</p><p>He was tempted to walk and find an area where he would find service, where he could call or text you to get clarification, but it&rsquo;s at that moment he senses someone walking behind him, not as silent as they were hoping as they lift their hands. Its instinctual as he turns, easily catching your wrists that are in mid air quickly as you gasp, your eyes growing larger as you let out a breathy \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Even though his breathing is measured, his heart is beating fast as he allows his eyes to take you in, to realize that he\u2019s in a public space and you don\u2019t mean any harm to him, the people around him. You shift your wrists in his embrace and he realizes that he\u2019s grabbed them too tight and he immediately pulls away as you give a side smile, your eyes relaxing as you let out,</p><p>\u201cServes me right, thinking I could sneak up behind you. I just wanted to see if you could guess who I was but that was a short lived idea.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re laughing, not offended at all as you pull out your phone and start scrolling through it. You look back up at him and smile, nodding for him to follow you into the long line to get into the stadium. He wants to tell you that he hated surprises, that they usually always resulted like this, him aggressively and unexpectedly ruining a nice gesture because he was always on edge. Instead, he pushes it down as you look back up at him, the first time he\u2019s seen you relaxed and happy around him since the start of your relationship and he smiles back,</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you credit for trying. Not a lot of women bold enough to try to out play me but unfortunately for us both, I\u2019ll always be quicker. My DNA gives me that advantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhhh humble are we,\u201d you say as you show the man your tickets on your phone, motioning it&rsquo;s for you and Steve as he ushers you towards security. \u201cYou\u2019ll never surprise me because I\u2019m smarter, faster, stronger. Ok Kanye.\u201d</p><p>Your voice is teasing as you give the security guard your purse to look through, before you walk through the security strip. It takes a beat and grants him the opportunity to quickly pull out the small notebook he keeps in his back pocket, to scribble down how he thinks one would write Kanye (with a C like the pepper?), multiple question marks beside it before placing the small book back in his pocket. He follows your lead through security, remembering a time where you could trust the people in the world to not cause havoc at places of joy as he tries to pinpoint the reference you\u2019ve dropped. </p><p>What the heck was a Kanye and why was everyone in this city always referencing him? If you brought it up it must be somewhat important so he\u2019d make sure to ask Sam or Clint next time he saw them.</p><p>He\u2019s surprised when he\u2019s moved through security and you\u2019re no longer standing in the spot you had been previously, waiting for him. Instead there\u2019s just the group of people passing by, trying to get to their seats. He feels panic rise in his chest, his hands going damp. </p><p>Where could you have gone that quickly? </p><p>It\u2019s seconds later he\u2019s rewarded to you throwing your body on his back, your arms wrapping around his broad shoulders as your legs squeeze around his middle,</p><p>\u201cHow about now soldier?\u201d you whisper in his ear, your voice dark and sultry, \u201cIs this quick enough for you?\u201d</p><p>Its intimate the position you&rsquo;re in, his hand instinctively finding the back of your thighs as you tighten around him. He shifts you higher up on his back, causing you to squeal as you tighten your hold around him and he likes the sound that slips out your mouth, wants to see how else he can pull it out of you. </p><p>\u201cYou just had to prove me wrong didn\u2019t you?\u201d he states, trying to look over his shoulder and you giggle, moving enough to look back into his eyes,</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me I\u2019m not fast enough, even for you. You should know now, \u00a0I will dedicate every minute of my life to proving you otherwise. I don\u2019t do \u2018can\u2019t\u2019\u201d</p><p>Your breath hits his face, the mixture of mint mingling with your perfume. He becomes aware of how his hands tease the soft muscle underneath your thighs, the soft way your stomach and breast press against his hard back, the way the bills of your hat awkwardly hit each other, causing you to drift closer.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous. But point made.\u201d He smiles at you, giving your legs a squeeze and you giggle, biting your lip as you wiggle in his embrace.</p><p>\u201cOk Mr. Rogers, now you\u2019ve made your point and you\u2019ve impressed me. You\u2019re able to lift my thick figure with ease. But I&rsquo;m sure the hoards of New York and Boston baseball fans that are pushing around us aren\u2019t as appreciative of your skills.\u201d</p><p>You move to fall down from his back, laughing as you adjust to being back on ground. He wants to tell you that he likes your thick figure, that you have meat on your bones that compliments you and you weighed nothing at all. But you\u2019re onto the next thing, your eyes surveying the place.</p><p>\u201cOk, first things first. We find beer. Then we find our seats. Then you have to impress me with your dazzling baseball knowledge. And if you impress me, maybe you get a second date. Or\u2026.you get stuck in the friend safe zone if I find you unable to keep up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d he asks, quirking an eyebrow at you. </p><p>\u201cYeah. You were the one who stood me up, remember.\u201d </p><p>You were right about that. </p><p>\u201cFair. It&rsquo;s your call. This time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou saying there\u2019s going to be a next?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know there is.\u201d he says confidently and you laugh as you pull the straps of your purse as you put your phone back into the satchel before your smiling up at him,</p><p>\u201cOk Cap. Follow me.\u201d</p><p>You move quickly, fast surprisingly considering the thickness of the crowd, but he\u2019s able to keep up with your frame. He wasn\u2019t used to this, someone else taking charge that wasn\u2019t Tony and he likes how confident you are, the fact that you knew what you wanted and wasn\u2019t afraid to go for it. You get him to the escalator with speed and smile at him as the moving stairs give you the vantage point of temporary high ground</p><p>\u201cWhat does it mean to have box seats?\u201d he finally asks, curious as you both look around in silence. \u201cEveryone at the tower are impressed that you\u2019re able to provide them and I&rsquo;m not sure why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeans we have one of the best views in the park and never have to leave the space for booze and food. It&rsquo;s just a fancy word of saying you are isolated from the public and get good amenities along with the game.\u201d</p><p>Oh. </p><p>You didn\u2019t seem like the kind of girl who liked to sit in isolation, away from it all in areas of athletics. While he could appreciate the privacy, he was always nostalgic of watching a good baseball game with others. </p><p>There was nothing like comradery amongst strangers. </p><p>You flicker your eyes back to him, note he\u2019s uneasy as you clear your throat, </p><p>\u201cThat sounded cocky. Let me correct myself&hellip;the seats aren\u2019t mine. Honestly, there the companies. They\u2019ll be three other people, journalists with us in the box. It&rsquo;s honestly just a nice place to watch the game if you\u2019re also trying to write down highlights for your article. Outside of that it&rsquo;s just convenience and a way to isolate from the crowd. Which really bums me out once I\u2019m done working, half of the fun at baseball is the crowd.\u201d</p><p>Steve nods, looking around him,</p><p>\u201cI know it may not seem it, but I like watching the game with a group of people too. I\u2019ve seen some of the best games and had some of the best conversations with just kind, random strangers.\u201d</p><p>You watch him curiously, leaning against the rail of the escalator before saying,</p><p>\u201cI suppose you were able to see some of the best baseball in the history of baseball on this soil. Box seats wouldn\u2019t impress you much, now that I think about it. Hmmm.\u201d</p><p>You give a wry smile and he realizes that he\u2019s done that thing again, where he\u2019s embarrassed you by defaulting to his simple ways and he\u2019s quick to place a gentle hand on your hips,</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m excited! It\u2019s a new experience and I get to talk with you and three other people who study baseball for a living. But mainly, I get one on one time with you.\u201d</p><p>That was at least true. While he would prefer normal seats, the only upside of this opportunity was being able to be so intimately close with you. You respond by laughing, resting your hand on his shoulder,</p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;re kind Steve. I didn\u2019t even think you\u2019d mind being with others\u2026.that was a selfish oversight of mine. My friend asked me to come to help him with his article, he likes my input and I thought it would be fun for us. But I see now\u2026.I shouldn\u2019t have thought you were the kind of man who would have found it interesting. And maybe&hellip;maybe I was trying not to make a big deal out of this date.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles, his hands squeezing your hips, </p><p>\u201cWhy? Because I disappointed you once and you were worried it would happen again so you wanted back up.\u201d </p><p>You giggle as you lean into him, giving his shoulder a swat, </p><p>\u201cCan you blame me! You real life disappeared for days\u2026.and it was after I was already speculative of letting you in the first place.\u201d</p><p>Your voice is light but you keep your eyes focused on everything but his face and he realizes that he had really disappointed you. Which, in turn, makes him feel disappointed in himself. </p><p>The last thing he wanted to do in any capacity was hurt you. </p><p>Especially when you were making it clear that you were still unsure about having anything to do with him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that and I promise you it will never happen again. I even got texting on my phone!\u201d he makes a point to pull out his phone, that automatically causes you to erupt in laughter, causing strangers to look over. </p><p>\u201cHoly shit. You must be serious\u2026.I bet getting texting on that thing was a migraine for the technician.\u201d </p><p>Your smiling back at him, the one that is all teeth and causes his stomach to dance and he squeezes your hips one more time. </p><p>\u201cBucky can happily let you know the pain I went through for you. Or more so that technician.\u201d </p><p>You both reach the top of the escalator, stepping off for the second level and you look around. Your quick as you find your target, causing him to stumble after you as you make your way to the daughter and father duo,</p><p>\u201cHello, sorry do you have a few seconds to talk?,\u201d \u00a0you pull your badge out of your bag as you continue \u201cI\u2019m a reporter for ESPN and I have a proposition for you.\u201d</p><p>The father looks at the badge, impressed as the daughter tugs on his legs, looking out onto the field.</p><p>\u201cI have these box seats for the game and my friend and I kinda want to be in the crowd \u2013 we\u2019ve been there all season you know. Would you be ok with switching? I know it&rsquo;s last minute and super random but it&rsquo;s just other reporters and you\u2019d have some first hand advantage for any bets you might have? And I much rather give my seats to you than some rowdy douchebag.\u201d</p><p>Your voice is light and sincere and the man looks at you in disbelief before asking,</p><p>\u201cAre you Ariadne Bellamy? The Ariadne Bellamy who writes for All Bets on Me?\u201d</p><p>You scrunch your eyes together before nodding,</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026..\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god \u2013 you helped me so much last season with your blog. Yes! We\u2019d love that. My daughter has really gotten into the sport and it&rsquo;s fun being in the ranks but it&rsquo;d be nice to watch a playoff game away from all the rowdiness. Besides I can tell all my friends how the Ariadne Bellamy gave me her seats.\u201d </p><p>You both exchange email addresses, sending him your box suite information as he exchanges the tickets in his hands. When you return back to Steve, you do so with a large grin on our face.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that Ariadne.\u201d Steve says quietly and you roll your eyes, shrugging.</p><p>\u201cJacob jumps on the opportunity to talk with real fans. Helps his article. And honestly, he\u2019ll text me if he really needs help. I want you to be comfortable for our date and if you\u2019d prefer to be down with the others, I\u2019m game. Though I\u2019m still using my company credit card for beer. That\u2019s the best perk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, you didn\u2019t have to be so nice to a stranger and yet you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaptain America questioning my moral code of conduct? Oh boy.\u201d </p><p>You have that teasing tone in your voice again and he laughs, grabbing your hand and giving it a small squeeze,</p><p>\u201cNot at all. It\u2019s just\u2026.refreshing. Of all the people you could have given it to, you were intentional to give it to someone who you knew it would mean a lot to. It\u2019s a unique kind of selflessness that&rsquo;s hard to find nowadays. It\u2019s makes you an exceptional person\u2026.\u201d he drifts as you look up at him, softened features etching your face and he clears his throat, \u201cAnyways, you got us into the game. Let me take care of the rest.\u201d</p><p>You don\u2019t object as you both head to find your seats, neither of you stopping to pull your hands away from the other.</p><p>You both miss most of the first inning, the line to grab cheap hot dogs and beer longer than he\u2019d like. You lean into making this experience authentic, though he\u2019s pretty sure that your arguing to hold two baskets of hot dogs and beers is a learned behavior from your overprotective and natural maternal relationship with Ellie. When he insists that he\u2019ll carry the beers and you can focus on the dogs you hesitantly agree, though by the time your walking down the steep stairs to your seats you give a grateful sigh that you weren\u2019t stuck with the bitter, golden liquid he was balancing behind you. It&rsquo;s not until your both sitting down that he automatically regrets his decision.</p><p>\u201cYou know what the difference is between watching the 1932 Yankees then versus now?\u201d he asks as you look over at him, \u201cI was a lot smaller. When did stadium seating get so\u2026.compact?\u201d</p><p>You laugh as you shake your head, falling back into your seat and leaning into his large frame.</p><p>\u201cAlways! They just make it for small people. If you have curves or a large Adonis frame like ourselves, you just gotta get up and grab more beer to deal with the stiffness in your legs.\u201d</p><p>He smiles as he hands a beer to you,</p><p>\u201cWell, to authenticity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo authenticity.\u201d </p><p>You both toast, the promise of a fun night hanging in the air.</p><hr><p>The game is fast paced. After you both inhale your hot dogs, you\u2019re never given the opportunity to sit down. The teams are too equally matched in skill, causing the stadium to spend most of its time standing and yelling at the field, at other fans, you and Steve included between alternating grabbing drinks. There\u2019s a few people that recognizes him, he can see the wide eye glimmer in their eyes before they look away but he\u2019s lucky that they haven\u2019t boldly gone over to ask for his autograph or photo. It\u2019s in contrast to you, who has multiple people stopping you between grabbing beers and innings - mostly men he notices - who are itching to hear your opinions on plays. You don\u2019t seem too bothered about it, answering questions gracefully before pointing out you\u2019re on a date and he wonders if this is standard for you, if it\u2019s the true reason you prefer your box seating.<br/></p><p>It\u2019s another question for another time - this wasn\u2019t the setting for that kind of reflection so instead when he gets a chance he asks, </p><p>\u201cYou know - you don\u2019t seem like a baseball watching kind of woman to me.\u201d</p><p>You laugh at him as you finish scurrying into your seat, the two beers in your hand splashing over your fingers. \u00a0You blow on them, the sun had set hours ago and the cold east coast air was starting to bite through your Yankees lined bomber jacket. This was round number four for you both and you still had three innings left. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d You nod as the horn signaling the end of the seventh inning goes off. You both opt to sit down, taking the opportunity for the next five minutes to rest your feet.</p><p>\u201cBut you are quite knowledgeable about baseball. I think even beyond what you need to know for your job.\u201d Steve counters and you smile, shaking your head as he throws his arm around you, allowing himself to be bold and you lean into his embrace easily.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d You take a sip of your beer watching him.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026..the story goes?\u201d</p><p>You laugh again, nodding your head to the side, biting your lip. When the time in your relationship came, he was going to learn how to tame that habit of yours. It was driving him crazy.</p><p>\u201cNothing complicated. I\u2019m a New York girl. My grandfather took me to games, then my father. I liked sports so it was easy, learning the intricacies of the game. I guess\u2026..I was close to my grandpa \u2013 my dad. So it\u2019s a way to keep them close to me, you know.\u201d</p><p>He nods and you lean into him, blinking up at him innocently,</p><p>\u201cWhat about you? What got you into baseball.\u201d</p><p>Steve laughs, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cTwo words. 1927 Yankees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurderer\u2019s Row.\u201d You whistle underneath your breath and he smiles, nodding.</p><p>\u201cI saw Babe Ruth play in this stadium. Lou Geghrig. Dimaggio. That was\u2026to see that group of men play a sport with the athletic finesse they did - \u00a0you just didn&rsquo;t get any better than that you know? I think it was the games in 1932. Bucky and I spent any free dime and nickel we could get our hands on to go. So much so that during the Yankees winning streak, we had drained our resources and right around my birthday. I was devastated. Bucky could only spare so much - his pop had died a few years back in the war and with three younger sisters to feed he felt guilty as it was to spend the money selfishly on the games. </p><p>But unbeknownst to me, my mom had been working double down at the factory despite the cancer that was eating at her to get me and Bucky tickets. She knew how much I loved baseball and wanted to get me a nice gift for my birthday. Bucky was thrilled, charmed a dame to buy us a hot dog we had to share and we had to hitchhike back home because we didn\u2019t have enough bus or subway fare but\u2026.standing in that stadium and watching that team play against the Pirates. Nothing like it.\u201d</p><p>He remembers how hot it\u2019d been, that it had triggered his asthma no matter how many layers he peeled off. It was the smoke from the fireworks that had resulted in pneumonia the next day and he had been out of commission for a week. \u00a0It hadn\u2019t mattered, standing beside Bucky in this stadium, watching a group of men play a game that made him forget for a few hours that he was feeble, sick Steve Rogers but just a part of the crowd, the memory makes him smile. Makes him feel like himself.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like a nice memory.\u201d You whisper to him and it causes him to shift his eyes back to you, pulling him back into the present.</p><p>\u201cIt was. Feels like yesterday\u201d He looks back onto the field as the game starts up and you nudge him, your hands finding his own and intertwining with them.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you sitting when it happened?,\u201d you look around, squinting before smiling and point to the north side of the stadium. \u201cI was sitting over there my first time. Fucking nosebleeds but Derek Jetter had been on fire that night. My grandfather was so happy and excited, the Yankees winning the most games that season in a long time. He had been grooming me on baseball for years, he was so enthusiastic about the sport and my family pitched in to get us the tickets. </p><p>It was exciting to take the train from Queens to the The Bronx. It was the first time I\u2019d been on the subway that long, my eight year old self eagerly drinking in everything as my grandpa quizzed me on the basic rules of baseball. He could\u2019ve taken anyone - my older brother loved baseball as much as him and he had been pissed when I got the ticket but grandfather was insistent it had to be me. Said there was something special about my voice when I talked about sports. I like to come here and remember how I felt in that moment&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Your face has washed over in nostalgia, smiling deeply as you lean into his shoulder, trying to block off a gust of wind that was blowing through the stadium. Steve looks around, before looking up and pointing, </p><p>\u201cIt was actually in this section\u2026but also in the nosebleeds. It had a beautiful view of everything and Bucky and I sat there every time we got our hands on a ticket,\u201d he laughs, shaking his head and drawing you closer to him, rubbing your arms as you shiver underneath your jacket. \u201cBucky had to carry me up the stairs every time toward the end, I couldn\u2019t breath after the first three flights. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I went through my whole inhaler between the wet air and those stairs.\u201d</p><p>You laugh as you look up at him, giving his hand a squeeze.</p><p>\u201cSports bring people together. That\u2019s why I do it - write. There\u2019s all the fucking politics and shady shit around it sure but it brings out this. Those happy moments that define us as humans.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s not prepared for you. Doesn\u2019t think he\u2019d be able to be, life had thrown you in his path when he had made peace with functioning alone in the world. He doesn\u2019t want that now that he\u2019s met you, wants to spend every second of his breath moving forward in being a part of your world in some way. </p><p>There\u2019s a moment that the loud stadium noise fades away, where he forgets where he\u2019s at as you both look at each other and there\u2019s the familiar knot that spreads in his stomach since he\u2019s met you. You\u2019re a siren calling him home and he leans down to press his lips against your own, needing to see. </p><p>You taste like a first kiss. Your lips are feathery and lush and he moves his beer between his legs so he can press his cold hand against your warm cheek, pull you closer to him. Your perfume overwhelms him and he doesn\u2019t need anything deeper than the satisfaction of your lips on top of his own. To feel your hand wrap over his as you kiss him back sweetly, the game an afterthought. </p><p>He was in trouble.</p><p>You were in trouble.</p><p>Both of you are too involved with the other to notice the fan that discreetly snaps your photo.</p><hr><p><b>Tag List:\u00a0\n\n</b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLmzyrERLwPWt7oIavzcIkw\">@geminimoonbeamx</a> <b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtaWaN_ighiYYScW7vLIC9w\">@ssweet-empowerment</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mi9ImHMJh5OaxHZPdeYy1LQ\">@capsofwinchesters</a>@<a href=\"http://tacohead13.tumblr.com/\">tacohead13</a>@<a href=\"http://harleycativy.tumblr.com/\">harleycativy</a>@<a href=\"http://pietrotheavenger.tumblr.com/\">pietrotheavenger</a>@<a href=\"http://francezka10.tumblr.com/\">francezka10</a>@<a href=\"http://papichulosebastian.tumblr.com/\">papichulosebastian</a>@<a href=\"http://obsessionsofmynerdheart.tumblr.com/\">obsessionsofmynerdheart</a>@<a href=\"http://melaninmarvel.tumblr.com/\">melaninmarvel</a>@<a href=\"http://avengedqueen26.tumblr.com/\">avengedqueen26</a>@<a href=\"http://nasteaxluvgal.tumblr.com/\">nasteaxluvgal</a>@<a href=\"https://winterbuttmunch.tumblr.com/\">winterbuttmunch</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbe29vW7LW2QdFTGx-XIrJg\">@nys30</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQpGSysFQQ2_z6AQ8OgRSAg\">@buckyslongasshair</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbqZ-ncss0ZkPEoFPX5I76g\">@ohlumi</a>@wellthirsted @<a href=\"http://gifsbysimplysonia.tumblr.com/\">gifsbysimplysonia</a> @misskenni <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSV8_iEBdIrspRVXhUIecAQ\">@harleycativy</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB7Vy5g26g5-LAZcceFvi3g\">@maraudereestauderelb</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8Ag-2kNfXKRbOu7yIBRYcQ\">@chrisevans-sexualfrustrations</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBHPHqRE0Z92Ed5hlLvX6vA\">@xceafh</a>@misskenni</b></p><p>TAGS ARE STILL OPEN!\u00a0</p>",

He was trying to find you \u2013 the service on his cell phone had failed him at his current location and the only sure way he knew how to find you in a crowd was to listen for your voice. But to listen for your voice meant he had to jump into the world of the thousands of people around him and his brain was feeling overstimulated, not used to ingesting so much stimulation and data at once, not since he trained it to do otherwise in social situations like this. Between the yelling and screaming and laughing \u2013 the people who were moving past him quickly and brushing against his body he felt like screaming, like bursting out and finding safety at higher ground.</p><p>It was how he felt back when breathing felt like a chore and the only time girls laid eyes on him was when they realized he was Bucky\u2019s sad best friend. </p><p>Being in crowds made him insecure. Which is why he preferred to watch from the wings. </p><p>He looked down at his screen, trying to see if the text he typed for you was sent but his phone was still doing that circling thing that Bucky called the wheel of death, so he assumed not. </p><p>He should have been more specific. Texting was more of a chore than a convenience. </p><p>He had given in to finally getting the writing service on his phone, right after he had made amends with you in your office. He had immediately asked Bucky to meet him at the cell phone store he had purchased his flip phone at to get texting put on the older device. Which had caused Bucky to guffaw because he really needed a new phone but Steve was insistent on keeping his old one and Bucky wasn\u2019t going to argue against it for the uptenth time again. So he patiently helped Steve figure out the simple buttons to send you a text, which had been a bust the next day when he was ready to send you a message.</p><p>It was Sam that stood next to him after their morning training, patiently helping \u00a0him click out the words over stiff buttons to send off to you,</p><p>I have texting on my phone so I can be better at staying in touch with you. How is your day?</p><p>The message had taken him an ashamedly twenty minutes to get out but he did, hearing from you immediately. The week continued with that cadence, you texting him goodnight and him texting you good morning. Finding opportunities to get to know each other a bit more, your texts coming in long paragraphs that his phone broke up in 5 pages while he sent multiple smaller texts, frustrated with the machine. So when you had texted him earlier that afternoon with the simple message of,</p><p>Excited to see you tonight! Yankee\u2019s Stadium, 6pm. SW entrance</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought to follow up to ask which southwest entrance. There were at least four, and they were all crowded and similar and he was feeling anxious trying to find you among the waves and waves of people walking in.</p><p>He was tempted to walk and find an area where he would find service, where he could call or text you to get clarification, but it\u2019s at that moment he senses someone walking behind him, not as silent as they were hoping as they lift their hands. Its instinctual as he turns, easily catching your wrists that are in mid air quickly as you gasp, your eyes growing larger as you let out a breathy \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Even though his breathing is measured, his heart is beating fast as he allows his eyes to take you in, to realize that he\u2019s in a public space and you don\u2019t mean any harm to him, the people around him. You shift your wrists in his embrace and he realizes that he\u2019s grabbed them too tight and he immediately pulls away as you give a side smile, your eyes relaxing as you let out,</p><p>\u201cServes me right, thinking I could sneak up behind you. I just wanted to see if you could guess who I was but that was a short lived idea.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re laughing, not offended at all as you pull out your phone and start scrolling through it. You look back up at him and smile, nodding for him to follow you into the long line to get into the stadium. He wants to tell you that he hated surprises, that they usually always resulted like this, him aggressively and unexpectedly ruining a nice gesture because he was always on edge. Instead, he pushes it down as you look back up at him, the first time he\u2019s seen you relaxed and happy around him since the start of your relationship and he smiles back,</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you credit for trying. Not a lot of women bold enough to try to out play me but unfortunately for us both, I\u2019ll always be quicker. My DNA gives me that advantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhhh humble are we,\u201d you say as you show the man your tickets on your phone, motioning it\u2019s for you and Steve as he ushers you towards security. \u201cYou\u2019ll never surprise me because I\u2019m smarter, faster, stronger. Ok Kanye.\u201d</p><p>Your voice is teasing as you give the security guard your purse to look through, before you walk through the security strip. It takes a beat and grants him the opportunity to quickly pull out the small notebook he keeps in his back pocket, to scribble down how he thinks one would write Kanye (with a C like the pepper?), multiple question marks beside it before placing the small book back in his pocket. He follows your lead through security, remembering a time where you could trust the people in the world to not cause havoc at places of joy as he tries to pinpoint the reference you\u2019ve dropped. </p><p>What the heck was a Kanye and why was everyone in this city always referencing him? If you brought it up it must be somewhat important so he\u2019d make sure to ask Sam or Clint next time he saw them.</p><p>He\u2019s surprised when he\u2019s moved through security and you\u2019re no longer standing in the spot you had been previously, waiting for him. Instead there\u2019s just the group of people passing by, trying to get to their seats. He feels panic rise in his chest, his hands going damp. </p><p>Where could you have gone that quickly? </p><p>It\u2019s seconds later he\u2019s rewarded to you throwing your body on his back, your arms wrapping around his broad shoulders as your legs squeeze around his middle,</p><p>\u201cHow about now soldier?\u201d you whisper in his ear, your voice dark and sultry, \u201cIs this quick enough for you?\u201d</p><p>Its intimate the position you\u2019re in, his hand instinctively finding the back of your thighs as you tighten around him. He shifts you higher up on his back, causing you to squeal as you tighten your hold around him and he likes the sound that slips out your mouth, wants to see how else he can pull it out of you. </p><p>\u201cYou just had to prove me wrong didn\u2019t you?\u201d he states, trying to look over his shoulder and you giggle, moving enough to look back into his eyes,</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me I\u2019m not fast enough, even for you. You should know now, \u00a0I will dedicate every minute of my life to proving you otherwise. I don\u2019t do \u2018can\u2019t\u2019\u201d</p><p>Your breath hits his face, the mixture of mint mingling with your perfume. He becomes aware of how his hands tease the soft muscle underneath your thighs, the soft way your stomach and breast press against his hard back, the way the bills of your hat awkwardly hit each other, causing you to drift closer.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous. But point made.\u201d He smiles at you, giving your legs a squeeze and you giggle, biting your lip as you wiggle in his embrace.</p><p>\u201cOk Mr. Rogers, now you\u2019ve made your point and you\u2019ve impressed me. You\u2019re able to lift my thick figure with ease. But I\u2019m sure the hoards of New York and Boston baseball fans that are pushing around us aren\u2019t as appreciative of your skills.\u201d</p><p>You move to fall down from his back, laughing as you adjust to being back on ground. He wants to tell you that he likes your thick figure, that you have meat on your bones that compliments you and you weighed nothing at all. But you\u2019re onto the next thing, your eyes surveying the place.</p><p>\u201cOk, first things first. We find beer. Then we find our seats. Then you have to impress me with your dazzling baseball knowledge. And if you impress me, maybe you get a second date. Or\u2026.you get stuck in the friend safe zone if I find you unable to keep up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d he asks, quirking an eyebrow at you. </p><p>\u201cYeah. You were the one who stood me up, remember.\u201d </p><p>You were right about that. </p><p>\u201cFair. It\u2019s your call. This time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou saying there\u2019s going to be a next?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know there is.\u201d he says confidently and you laugh as you pull the straps of your purse as you put your phone back into the satchel before your smiling up at him,</p><p>\u201cOk Cap. Follow me.\u201d</p><p>You move quickly, fast surprisingly considering the thickness of the crowd, but he\u2019s able to keep up with your frame. He wasn\u2019t used to this, someone else taking charge that wasn\u2019t Tony and he likes how confident you are, the fact that you knew what you wanted and wasn\u2019t afraid to go for it. You get him to the escalator with speed and smile at him as the moving stairs give you the vantage point of temporary high ground</p><p>\u201cWhat does it mean to have box seats?\u201d he finally asks, curious as you both look around in silence. \u201cEveryone at the tower are impressed that you\u2019re able to provide them and I\u2019m not sure why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeans we have one of the best views in the park and never have to leave the space for booze and food. It\u2019s just a fancy word of saying you are isolated from the public and get good amenities along with the game.\u201d</p><p>Oh. </p><p>You didn\u2019t seem like the kind of girl who liked to sit in isolation, away from it all in areas of athletics. While he could appreciate the privacy, he was always nostalgic of watching a good baseball game with others. </p><p>There was nothing like comradery amongst strangers. </p><p>You flicker your eyes back to him, note he\u2019s uneasy as you clear your throat, </p><p>\u201cThat sounded cocky. Let me correct myself\u2026the seats aren\u2019t mine. Honestly, there the companies. They\u2019ll be three other people, journalists with us in the box. It\u2019s honestly just a nice place to watch the game if you\u2019re also trying to write down highlights for your article. Outside of that it\u2019s just convenience and a way to isolate from the crowd. Which really bums me out once I\u2019m done working, half of the fun at baseball is the crowd.\u201d</p><p>Steve nods, looking around him,</p><p>\u201cI know it may not seem it, but I like watching the game with a group of people too. I\u2019ve seen some of the best games and had some of the best conversations with just kind, random strangers.\u201d</p><p>You watch him curiously, leaning against the rail of the escalator before saying,</p><p>\u201cI suppose you were able to see some of the best baseball in the history of baseball on this soil. Box seats wouldn\u2019t impress you much, now that I think about it. Hmmm.\u201d</p><p>You give a wry smile and he realizes that he\u2019s done that thing again, where he\u2019s embarrassed you by defaulting to his simple ways and he\u2019s quick to place a gentle hand on your hips,</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m excited! It\u2019s a new experience and I get to talk with you and three other people who study baseball for a living. But mainly, I get one on one time with you.\u201d</p><p>That was at least true. While he would prefer normal seats, the only upside of this opportunity was being able to be so intimately close with you. You respond by laughing, resting your hand on his shoulder,</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kind Steve. I didn\u2019t even think you\u2019d mind being with others\u2026.that was a selfish oversight of mine. My friend asked me to come to help him with his article, he likes my input and I thought it would be fun for us. But I see now\u2026.I shouldn\u2019t have thought you were the kind of man who would have found it interesting. And maybe\u2026maybe I was trying not to make a big deal out of this date.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles, his hands squeezing your hips, </p><p>\u201cWhy? Because I disappointed you once and you were worried it would happen again so you wanted back up.\u201d </p><p>You giggle as you lean into him, giving his shoulder a swat, </p><p>\u201cCan you blame me! You real life disappeared for days\u2026.and it was after I was already speculative of letting you in the first place.\u201d</p><p>Your voice is light but you keep your eyes focused on everything but his face and he realizes that he had really disappointed you. Which, in turn, makes him feel disappointed in himself. </p><p>The last thing he wanted to do in any capacity was hurt you. </p><p>Especially when you were making it clear that you were still unsure about having anything to do with him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that and I promise you it will never happen again. I even got texting on my phone!\u201d he makes a point to pull out his phone, that automatically causes you to erupt in laughter, causing strangers to look over. </p><p>\u201cHoly shit. You must be serious\u2026.I bet getting texting on that thing was a migraine for the technician.\u201d </p><p>Your smiling back at him, the one that is all teeth and causes his stomach to dance and he squeezes your hips one more time. </p><p>\u201cBucky can happily let you know the pain I went through for you. Or more so that technician.\u201d </p><p>You both reach the top of the escalator, stepping off for the second level and you look around. Your quick as you find your target, causing him to stumble after you as you make your way to the daughter and father duo,</p><p>\u201cHello, sorry do you have a few seconds to talk?,\u201d \u00a0you pull your badge out of your bag as you continue \u201cI\u2019m a reporter for ESPN and I have a proposition for you.\u201d</p><p>The father looks at the badge, impressed as the daughter tugs on his legs, looking out onto the field.</p><p>\u201cI have these box seats for the game and my friend and I kinda want to be in the crowd \u2013 we\u2019ve been there all season you know. Would you be ok with switching? I know it\u2019s last minute and super random but it\u2019s just other reporters and you\u2019d have some first hand advantage for any bets you might have? And I much rather give my seats to you than some rowdy douchebag.\u201d</p><p>Your voice is light and sincere and the man looks at you in disbelief before asking,</p><p>\u201cAre you Ariadne Bellamy? The Ariadne Bellamy who writes for All Bets on Me?\u201d</p><p>You scrunch your eyes together before nodding,</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026..\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god \u2013 you helped me so much last season with your blog. Yes! We\u2019d love that. My daughter has really gotten into the sport and it\u2019s fun being in the ranks but it\u2019d be nice to watch a playoff game away from all the rowdiness. Besides I can tell all my friends how the Ariadne Bellamy gave me her seats.\u201d </p><p>You both exchange email addresses, sending him your box suite information as he exchanges the tickets in his hands. When you return back to Steve, you do so with a large grin on our face.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that Ariadne.\u201d Steve says quietly and you roll your eyes, shrugging.</p><p>\u201cJacob jumps on the opportunity to talk with real fans. Helps his article. And honestly, he\u2019ll text me if he really needs help. I want you to be comfortable for our date and if you\u2019d prefer to be down with the others, I\u2019m game. Though I\u2019m still using my company credit card for beer. That\u2019s the best perk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, you didn\u2019t have to be so nice to a stranger and yet you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaptain America questioning my moral code of conduct? Oh boy.\u201d </p><p>You have that teasing tone in your voice again and he laughs, grabbing your hand and giving it a small squeeze,</p><p>\u201cNot at all. It\u2019s just\u2026.refreshing. Of all the people you could have given it to, you were intentional to give it to someone who you knew it would mean a lot to. It\u2019s a unique kind of selflessness that\u2019s hard to find nowadays. It\u2019s makes you an exceptional person\u2026.\u201d he drifts as you look up at him, softened features etching your face and he clears his throat, \u201cAnyways, you got us into the game. Let me take care of the rest.\u201d</p><p>You don\u2019t object as you both head to find your seats, neither of you stopping to pull your hands away from the other.</p><p>You both miss most of the first inning, the line to grab cheap hot dogs and beer longer than he\u2019d like. You lean into making this experience authentic, though he\u2019s pretty sure that your arguing to hold two baskets of hot dogs and beers is a learned behavior from your overprotective and natural maternal relationship with Ellie. When he insists that he\u2019ll carry the beers and you can focus on the dogs you hesitantly agree, though by the time your walking down the steep stairs to your seats you give a grateful sigh that you weren\u2019t stuck with the bitter, golden liquid he was balancing behind you. It\u2019s not until your both sitting down that he automatically regrets his decision.</p><p>\u201cYou know what the difference is between watching the 1932 Yankees then versus now?\u201d he asks as you look over at him, \u201cI was a lot smaller. When did stadium seating get so\u2026.compact?\u201d</p><p>You laugh as you shake your head, falling back into your seat and leaning into his large frame.</p><p>\u201cAlways! They just make it for small people. If you have curves or a large Adonis frame like ourselves, you just gotta get up and grab more beer to deal with the stiffness in your legs.\u201d</p><p>He smiles as he hands a beer to you,</p><p>\u201cWell, to authenticity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo authenticity.\u201d </p><p>You both toast, the promise of a fun night hanging in the air.</p><hr><p>The game is fast paced. After you both inhale your hot dogs, you\u2019re never given the opportunity to sit down. The teams are too equally matched in skill, causing the stadium to spend most of its time standing and yelling at the field, at other fans, you and Steve included between alternating grabbing drinks. There\u2019s a few people that recognizes him, he can see the wide eye glimmer in their eyes before they look away but he\u2019s lucky that they haven\u2019t boldly gone over to ask for his autograph or photo. It\u2019s in contrast to you, who has multiple people stopping you between grabbing beers and innings - mostly men he notices - who are itching to hear your opinions on plays. You don\u2019t seem too bothered about it, answering questions gracefully before pointing out you\u2019re on a date and he wonders if this is standard for you, if it\u2019s the true reason you prefer your box seating.<br></p><p>It\u2019s another question for another time - this wasn\u2019t the setting for that kind of reflection so instead when he gets a chance he asks, </p><p>\u201cYou know - you don\u2019t seem like a baseball watching kind of woman to me.\u201d</p><p>You laugh at him as you finish scurrying into your seat, the two beers in your hand splashing over your fingers. \u00a0You blow on them, the sun had set hours ago and the cold east coast air was starting to bite through your Yankees lined bomber jacket. This was round number four for you both and you still had three innings left. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d You nod as the horn signaling the end of the seventh inning goes off. You both opt to sit down, taking the opportunity for the next five minutes to rest your feet.</p><p>\u201cBut you are quite knowledgeable about baseball. I think even beyond what you need to know for your job.\u201d Steve counters and you smile, shaking your head as he throws his arm around you, allowing himself to be bold and you lean into his embrace easily.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d You take a sip of your beer watching him.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026..the story goes?\u201d</p><p>You laugh again, nodding your head to the side, biting your lip. When the time in your relationship came, he was going to learn how to tame that habit of yours. It was driving him crazy.</p><p>\u201cNothing complicated. I\u2019m a New York girl. My grandfather took me to games, then my father. I liked sports so it was easy, learning the intricacies of the game. I guess\u2026..I was close to my grandpa \u2013 my dad. So it\u2019s a way to keep them close to me, you know.\u201d</p><p>He nods and you lean into him, blinking up at him innocently,</p><p>\u201cWhat about you? What got you into baseball.\u201d</p><p>Steve laughs, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cTwo words. 1927 Yankees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurderer\u2019s Row.\u201d You whistle underneath your breath and he smiles, nodding.</p><p>\u201cI saw Babe Ruth play in this stadium. Lou Geghrig. Dimaggio. That was\u2026to see that group of men play a sport with the athletic finesse they did - \u00a0you just didn\u2019t get any better than that you know? I think it was the games in 1932. Bucky and I spent any free dime and nickel we could get our hands on to go. So much so that during the Yankees winning streak, we had drained our resources and right around my birthday. I was devastated. Bucky could only spare so much - his pop had died a few years back in the war and with three younger sisters to feed he felt guilty as it was to spend the money selfishly on the games. </p><p>But unbeknownst to me, my mom had been working double down at the factory despite the cancer that was eating at her to get me and Bucky tickets. She knew how much I loved baseball and wanted to get me a nice gift for my birthday. Bucky was thrilled, charmed a dame to buy us a hot dog we had to share and we had to hitchhike back home because we didn\u2019t have enough bus or subway fare but\u2026.standing in that stadium and watching that team play against the Pirates. Nothing like it.\u201d</p><p>He remembers how hot it\u2019d been, that it had triggered his asthma no matter how many layers he peeled off. It was the smoke from the fireworks that had resulted in pneumonia the next day and he had been out of commission for a week. \u00a0It hadn\u2019t mattered, standing beside Bucky in this stadium, watching a group of men play a game that made him forget for a few hours that he was feeble, sick Steve Rogers but just a part of the crowd, the memory makes him smile. Makes him feel like himself.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like a nice memory.\u201d You whisper to him and it causes him to shift his eyes back to you, pulling him back into the present.</p><p>\u201cIt was. Feels like yesterday\u201d He looks back onto the field as the game starts up and you nudge him, your hands finding his own and intertwining with them.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you sitting when it happened?,\u201d you look around, squinting before smiling and point to the north side of the stadium. \u201cI was sitting over there my first time. Fucking nosebleeds but Derek Jetter had been on fire that night. My grandfather was so happy and excited, the Yankees winning the most games that season in a long time. He had been grooming me on baseball for years, he was so enthusiastic about the sport and my family pitched in to get us the tickets. </p><p>It was exciting to take the train from Queens to the The Bronx. It was the first time I\u2019d been on the subway that long, my eight year old self eagerly drinking in everything as my grandpa quizzed me on the basic rules of baseball. He could\u2019ve taken anyone - my older brother loved baseball as much as him and he had been pissed when I got the ticket but grandfather was insistent it had to be me. Said there was something special about my voice when I talked about sports. I like to come here and remember how I felt in that moment\u2026\u201d</p><p>Your face has washed over in nostalgia, smiling deeply as you lean into his shoulder, trying to block off a gust of wind that was blowing through the stadium. Steve looks around, before looking up and pointing, </p><p>\u201cIt was actually in this section\u2026but also in the nosebleeds. It had a beautiful view of everything and Bucky and I sat there every time we got our hands on a ticket,\u201d he laughs, shaking his head and drawing you closer to him, rubbing your arms as you shiver underneath your jacket. \u201cBucky had to carry me up the stairs every time toward the end, I couldn\u2019t breath after the first three flights. I\u2019m pretty sure I went through my whole inhaler between the wet air and those stairs.\u201d</p><p>You laugh as you look up at him, giving his hand a squeeze.</p><p>\u201cSports bring people together. That\u2019s why I do it - write. There\u2019s all the fucking politics and shady shit around it sure but it brings out this. Those happy moments that define us as humans.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s not prepared for you. Doesn\u2019t think he\u2019d be able to be, life had thrown you in his path when he had made peace with functioning alone in the world. He doesn\u2019t want that now that he\u2019s met you, wants to spend every second of his breath moving forward in being a part of your world in some way. </p><p>There\u2019s a moment that the loud stadium noise fades away, where he forgets where he\u2019s at as you both look at each other and there\u2019s the familiar knot that spreads in his stomach since he\u2019s met you. You\u2019re a siren calling him home and he leans down to press his lips against your own, needing to see. </p><p>You taste like a first kiss. Your lips are feathery and lush and he moves his beer between his legs so he can press his cold hand against your warm cheek, pull you closer to him. Your perfume overwhelms him and he doesn\u2019t need anything deeper than the satisfaction of your lips on top of his own. To feel your hand wrap over his as you kiss him back sweetly, the game an afterthought. </p><p>He was in trouble.</p><p>You were in trouble.</p><p>Both of you are too involved with the other to notice the fan that discreetly snaps your photo.</p><hr><p><b>Tag List:\u00a0\n\n</b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLmzyrERLwPWt7oIavzcIkw\">@geminimoonbeamx</a> <b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtaWaN_ighiYYScW7vLIC9w\">@ssweet-empowerment</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mi9ImHMJh5OaxHZPdeYy1LQ\">@capsofwinchesters</a>@<a href=\"http://tacohead13.tumblr.com/\">tacohead13</a>@<a href=\"http://harleycativy.tumblr.com/\">harleycativy</a>@<a href=\"http://pietrotheavenger.tumblr.com/\">pietrotheavenger</a>@<a href=\"http://francezka10.tumblr.com/\">francezka10</a>@<a href=\"http://papichulosebastian.tumblr.com/\">papichulosebastian</a>@<a href=\"http://obsessionsofmynerdheart.tumblr.com/\">obsessionsofmynerdheart</a>@<a href=\"http://melaninmarvel.tumblr.com/\">melaninmarvel</a>@<a href=\"http://avengedqueen26.tumblr.com/\">avengedqueen26</a>@<a href=\"http://nasteaxluvgal.tumblr.com/\">nasteaxluvgal</a>@<a href=\"https://winterbuttmunch.tumblr.com/\">winterbuttmunch</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbe29vW7LW2QdFTGx-XIrJg\">@nys30</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQpGSysFQQ2_z6AQ8OgRSAg\">@buckyslongasshair</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbqZ-ncss0ZkPEoFPX5I76g\">@ohlumi</a>@wellthirsted @<a href=\"http://gifsbysimplysonia.tumblr.com/\">gifsbysimplysonia</a> @misskenni <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSV8_iEBdIrspRVXhUIecAQ\">@harleycativy</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB7Vy5g26g5-LAZcceFvi3g\">@maraudereestauderelb</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8Ag-2kNfXKRbOu7yIBRYcQ\">@chrisevans-sexualfrustrations</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBHPHqRE0Z92Ed5hlLvX6vA\">@xceafh</a>@misskenni</b></p><p>TAGS ARE STILL OPEN!\u00a0</p>",

Humans are simple creatures by design \u2013 inspired and ruined by the same motivations. It\u2019s only when they are aware their voice is heard that feelings like guilt and apology come into play. </p><p>Steve used to think his super hearing, like most of his abilities, was a curse. It forced him to be witness to peoples move private and intimate conversations \u2013 forcing him into strangers lives. Over time, he had to learn how to tune humans out. He was tired of hearing the same things, tired of the anxiety that arose from jumping from one conversation to another. While he believed in the beauty of humanity \u2013 believed that him and his species were worth fighting for \u2013 it was becoming dull to have to listen to the same conversations repeat themselves, to never pinpoint the simpler of solutions. </p><p>That humans were restless and craved conflict.</p><p>He should know. </p><p>It was how he felt 90% of the time. </p>[[MORE]]<p>So, as he stood in a stadium that had the capacity to hold over 54,000 he had realized the error in his ways. He was trying to find you \u2013 the service on his cell phone had failed him at his current location and the only sure way he knew how to find you in a crowd was to listen for your voice. But to listen for your voice meant he had to jump into the world of the thousands of people around him and his brain was feeling overstimulated, not used to ingesting so much stimulation and data at once, not since he trained it to do otherwise in social situations like this. Between the yelling and screaming and laughing \u2013 the people who were moving past him quickly and brushing against his body he felt like screaming, like bursting out and finding safety at higher ground.</p><p>It was how he felt back when breathing felt like a chore and the only time girls laid eyes on him was when they realized he was Bucky\u2019s sad best friend. </p><p>Being in crowds made him insecure. Which is why he preferred to watch from the wings. </p><p>He looked down at his screen, trying to see if the text he typed for you was sent but his phone was still doing that circling thing that Bucky called the wheel of death, so he assumed not. </p><p>He should have been more specific. Texting was more of a chore than a convenience. </p><p>He had given in to finally getting the writing service on his phone, right after he had made amends with you in your office. He had immediately asked Bucky to meet him at the cell phone store he had purchased his flip phone at to get texting put on the older device. Which had caused Bucky to guffaw because he really needed a new phone but Steve was insistent on keeping his old one and Bucky wasn\u2019t going to argue against it for the uptenth time again. So he patiently helped Steve figure out the simple buttons to send you a text, which had been a bust the next day when he was ready to send you a message.</p><p>It was Sam that stood next to him after their morning training, patiently helping \u00a0him click out the words over stiff buttons to send off to you,</p><p>I have texting on my phone so I can be better at staying in touch with you. How is your day?</p><p>The message had taken him an ashamedly twenty minutes to get out but he did, hearing from you immediately. The week continued with that cadence, you texting him goodnight and him texting you good morning. Finding opportunities to get to know each other a bit more, your texts coming in long paragraphs that his phone broke up in 5 pages while he sent multiple smaller texts, frustrated with the machine. So when you had texted him earlier that afternoon with the simple message of,</p><p>Excited to see you tonight! Yankee\u2019s Stadium, 6pm. SW entrance</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought to follow up to ask which southwest entrance. There were at least four, and they were all crowded and similar and he was feeling anxious trying to find you among the waves and waves of people walking in.</p><p>He was tempted to walk and find an area where he would find service, where he could call or text you to get clarification, but it\u2019s at that moment he senses someone walking behind him, not as silent as they were hoping as they lift their hands. Its instinctual as he turns, easily catching your wrists that are in mid air quickly as you gasp, your eyes growing larger as you let out a breathy \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Even though his breathing is measured, his heart is beating fast as he allows his eyes to take you in, to realize that he\u2019s in a public space and you don\u2019t mean any harm to him, the people around him. You shift your wrists in his embrace and he realizes that he\u2019s grabbed them too tight and he immediately pulls away as you give a side smile, your eyes relaxing as you let out,</p><p>\u201cServes me right, thinking I could sneak up behind you. I just wanted to see if you could guess who I was but that was a short lived idea.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re laughing, not offended at all as you pull out your phone and start scrolling through it. You look back up at him and smile, nodding for him to follow you into the long line to get into the stadium. He wants to tell you that he hated surprises, that they usually always resulted like this, him aggressively and unexpectedly ruining a nice gesture because he was always on edge. Instead, he pushes it down as you look back up at him, the first time he\u2019s seen you relaxed and happy around him since the start of your relationship and he smiles back,</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you credit for trying. Not a lot of women bold enough to try to out play me but unfortunately for us both, I\u2019ll always be quicker. My DNA gives me that advantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhhh humble are we,\u201d you say as you show the man your tickets on your phone, motioning it\u2019s for you and Steve as he ushers you towards security. \u201cYou\u2019ll never surprise me because I\u2019m smarter, faster, stronger. Ok Kanye.\u201d</p><p>Your voice is teasing as you give the security guard your purse to look through, before you walk through the security strip. It takes a beat and grants him the opportunity to quickly pull out the small notebook he keeps in his back pocket, to scribble down how he thinks one would write Kanye (with a C like the pepper?), multiple question marks beside it before placing the small book back in his pocket. He follows your lead through security, remembering a time where you could trust the people in the world to not cause havoc at places of joy as he tries to pinpoint the reference you\u2019ve dropped. </p><p>What the heck was a Kanye and why was everyone in this city always referencing him? If you brought it up it must be somewhat important so he\u2019d make sure to ask Sam or Clint next time he saw them.</p><p>He\u2019s surprised when he\u2019s moved through security and you\u2019re no longer standing in the spot you had been previously, waiting for him. Instead there\u2019s just the group of people passing by, trying to get to their seats. He feels panic rise in his chest, his hands going damp. </p><p>Where could you have gone that quickly? </p><p>It\u2019s seconds later he\u2019s rewarded to you throwing your body on his back, your arms wrapping around his broad shoulders as your legs squeeze around his middle,</p><p>\u201cHow about now soldier?\u201d you whisper in his ear, your voice dark and sultry, \u201cIs this quick enough for you?\u201d</p><p>Its intimate the position you\u2019re in, his hand instinctively finding the back of your thighs as you tighten around him. He shifts you higher up on his back, causing you to squeal as you tighten your hold around him and he likes the sound that slips out your mouth, wants to see how else he can pull it out of you. </p><p>\u201cYou just had to prove me wrong didn\u2019t you?\u201d he states, trying to look over his shoulder and you giggle, moving enough to look back into his eyes,</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me I\u2019m not fast enough, even for you. You should know now, \u00a0I will dedicate every minute of my life to proving you otherwise. I don\u2019t do \u2018can\u2019t\u2019\u201d</p><p>Your breath hits his face, the mixture of mint mingling with your perfume. He becomes aware of how his hands tease the soft muscle underneath your thighs, the soft way your stomach and breast press against his hard back, the way the bills of your hat awkwardly hit each other, causing you to drift closer.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous. But point made.\u201d He smiles at you, giving your legs a squeeze and you giggle, biting your lip as you wiggle in his embrace.</p><p>\u201cOk Mr. Rogers, now you\u2019ve made your point and you\u2019ve impressed me. You\u2019re able to lift my thick figure with ease. But I\u2019m sure the hoards of New York and Boston baseball fans that are pushing around us aren\u2019t as appreciative of your skills.\u201d</p><p>You move to fall down from his back, laughing as you adjust to being back on ground. He wants to tell you that he likes your thick figure, that you have meat on your bones that compliments you and you weighed nothing at all. But you\u2019re onto the next thing, your eyes surveying the place.</p><p>\u201cOk, first things first. We find beer. Then we find our seats. Then you have to impress me with your dazzling baseball knowledge. And if you impress me, maybe you get a second date. Or\u2026.you get stuck in the friend safe zone if I find you unable to keep up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d he asks, quirking an eyebrow at you. </p><p>\u201cYeah. You were the one who stood me up, remember.\u201d </p><p>You were right about that. </p><p>\u201cFair. It\u2019s your call. This time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou saying there\u2019s going to be a next?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know there is.\u201d he says confidently and you laugh as you pull the straps of your purse as you put your phone back into the satchel before your smiling up at him,</p><p>\u201cOk Cap. Follow me.\u201d</p><p>You move quickly, fast surprisingly considering the thickness of the crowd, but he\u2019s able to keep up with your frame. He wasn\u2019t used to this, someone else taking charge that wasn\u2019t Tony and he likes how confident you are, the fact that you knew what you wanted and wasn\u2019t afraid to go for it. You get him to the escalator with speed and smile at him as the moving stairs give you the vantage point of temporary high ground</p><p>\u201cWhat does it mean to have box seats?\u201d he finally asks, curious as you both look around in silence. \u201cEveryone at the tower are impressed that you\u2019re able to provide them and I\u2019m not sure why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeans we have one of the best views in the park and never have to leave the space for booze and food. It\u2019s just a fancy word of saying you are isolated from the public and get good amenities along with the game.\u201d</p><p>Oh. </p><p>You didn\u2019t seem like the kind of girl who liked to sit in isolation, away from it all in areas of athletics. While he could appreciate the privacy, he was always nostalgic of watching a good baseball game with others. </p><p>There was nothing like comradery amongst strangers. </p><p>You flicker your eyes back to him, note he\u2019s uneasy as you clear your throat, </p><p>\u201cThat sounded cocky. Let me correct myself\u2026the seats aren\u2019t mine. Honestly, there the companies. They\u2019ll be three other people, journalists with us in the box. It\u2019s honestly just a nice place to watch the game if you\u2019re also trying to write down highlights for your article. Outside of that it\u2019s just convenience and a way to isolate from the crowd. Which really bums me out once I\u2019m done working, half of the fun at baseball is the crowd.\u201d</p><p>Steve nods, looking around him,</p><p>\u201cI know it may not seem it, but I like watching the game with a group of people too. I\u2019ve seen some of the best games and had some of the best conversations with just kind, random strangers.\u201d</p><p>You watch him curiously, leaning against the rail of the escalator before saying,</p><p>\u201cI suppose you were able to see some of the best baseball in the history of baseball on this soil. Box seats wouldn\u2019t impress you much, now that I think about it. Hmmm.\u201d</p><p>You give a wry smile and he realizes that he\u2019s done that thing again, where he\u2019s embarrassed you by defaulting to his simple ways and he\u2019s quick to place a gentle hand on your hips,</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m excited! It\u2019s a new experience and I get to talk with you and three other people who study baseball for a living. But mainly, I get one on one time with you.\u201d</p><p>That was at least true. While he would prefer normal seats, the only upside of this opportunity was being able to be so intimately close with you. You respond by laughing, resting your hand on his shoulder,</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kind Steve. I didn\u2019t even think you\u2019d mind being with others\u2026.that was a selfish oversight of mine. My friend asked me to come to help him with his article, he likes my input and I thought it would be fun for us. But I see now\u2026.I shouldn\u2019t have thought you were the kind of man who would have found it interesting. And maybe\u2026maybe I was trying not to make a big deal out of this date.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles, his hands squeezing your hips, </p><p>\u201cWhy? Because I disappointed you once and you were worried it would happen again so you wanted back up.\u201d </p><p>You giggle as you lean into him, giving his shoulder a swat, </p><p>\u201cCan you blame me! You real life disappeared for days\u2026.and it was after I was already speculative of letting you in the first place.\u201d</p><p>Your voice is light but you keep your eyes focused on everything but his face and he realizes that he had really disappointed you. Which, in turn, makes him feel disappointed in himself. </p><p>The last thing he wanted to do in any capacity was hurt you. </p><p>Especially when you were making it clear that you were still unsure about having anything to do with him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that and I promise you it will never happen again. I even got texting on my phone!\u201d he makes a point to pull out his phone, that automatically causes you to erupt in laughter, causing strangers to look over. </p><p>\u201cHoly shit. You must be serious\u2026.I bet getting texting on that thing was a migraine for the technician.\u201d </p><p>Your smiling back at him, the one that is all teeth and causes his stomach to dance and he squeezes your hips one more time. </p><p>\u201cBucky can happily let you know the pain I went through for you. Or more so that technician.\u201d </p><p>You both reach the top of the escalator, stepping off for the second level and you look around. Your quick as you find your target, causing him to stumble after you as you make your way to the daughter and father duo,</p><p>\u201cHello, sorry do you have a few seconds to talk?,\u201d \u00a0you pull your badge out of your bag as you continue \u201cI\u2019m a reporter for ESPN and I have a proposition for you.\u201d</p><p>The father looks at the badge, impressed as the daughter tugs on his legs, looking out onto the field.</p><p>\u201cI have these box seats for the game and my friend and I kinda want to be in the crowd \u2013 we\u2019ve been there all season you know. Would you be ok with switching? I know it\u2019s last minute and super random but it\u2019s just other reporters and you\u2019d have some first hand advantage for any bets you might have? And I much rather give my seats to you than some rowdy douchebag.\u201d</p><p>Your voice is light and sincere and the man looks at you in disbelief before asking,</p><p>\u201cAre you Ariadne Bellamy? The Ariadne Bellamy who writes for All Bets on Me?\u201d</p><p>You scrunch your eyes together before nodding,</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026..\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god \u2013 you helped me so much last season with your blog. Yes! We\u2019d love that. My daughter has really gotten into the sport and it\u2019s fun being in the ranks but it\u2019d be nice to watch a playoff game away from all the rowdiness. Besides I can tell all my friends how the Ariadne Bellamy gave me her seats.\u201d </p><p>You both exchange email addresses, sending him your box suite information as he exchanges the tickets in his hands. When you return back to Steve, you do so with a large grin on our face.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that Ariadne.\u201d Steve says quietly and you roll your eyes, shrugging.</p><p>\u201cJacob jumps on the opportunity to talk with real fans. Helps his article. And honestly, he\u2019ll text me if he really needs help. I want you to be comfortable for our date and if you\u2019d prefer to be down with the others, I\u2019m game. Though I\u2019m still using my company credit card for beer. That\u2019s the best perk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, you didn\u2019t have to be so nice to a stranger and yet you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaptain America questioning my moral code of conduct? Oh boy.\u201d </p><p>You have that teasing tone in your voice again and he laughs, grabbing your hand and giving it a small squeeze,</p><p>\u201cNot at all. It\u2019s just\u2026.refreshing. Of all the people you could have given it to, you were intentional to give it to someone who you knew it would mean a lot to. It\u2019s a unique kind of selflessness that\u2019s hard to find nowadays. It\u2019s makes you an exceptional person\u2026.\u201d he drifts as you look up at him, softened features etching your face and he clears his throat, \u201cAnyways, you got us into the game. Let me take care of the rest.\u201d</p><p>You don\u2019t object as you both head to find your seats, neither of you stopping to pull your hands away from the other.</p><p>You both miss most of the first inning, the line to grab cheap hot dogs and beer longer than he\u2019d like. You lean into making this experience authentic, though he\u2019s pretty sure that your arguing to hold two baskets of hot dogs and beers is a learned behavior from your overprotective and natural maternal relationship with Ellie. When he insists that he\u2019ll carry the beers and you can focus on the dogs you hesitantly agree, though by the time your walking down the steep stairs to your seats you give a grateful sigh that you weren\u2019t stuck with the bitter, golden liquid he was balancing behind you. It\u2019s not until your both sitting down that he automatically regrets his decision.</p><p>\u201cYou know what the difference is between watching the 1932 Yankees then versus now?\u201d he asks as you look over at him, \u201cI was a lot smaller. When did stadium seating get so\u2026.compact?\u201d</p><p>You laugh as you shake your head, falling back into your seat and leaning into his large frame.</p><p>\u201cAlways! They just make it for small people. If you have curves or a large Adonis frame like ourselves, you just gotta get up and grab more beer to deal with the stiffness in your legs.\u201d</p><p>He smiles as he hands a beer to you,</p><p>\u201cWell, to authenticity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo authenticity.\u201d </p><p>You both toast, the promise of a fun night hanging in the air.</p><hr><p>The game is fast paced. After you both inhale your hot dogs, you\u2019re never given the opportunity to sit down. The teams are too equally matched in skill, causing the stadium to spend most of its time standing and yelling at the field, at other fans, you and Steve included between alternating grabbing drinks. There\u2019s a few people that recognizes him, he can see the wide eye glimmer in their eyes before they look away but he\u2019s lucky that they haven\u2019t boldly gone over to ask for his autograph or photo. It\u2019s in contrast to you, who has multiple people stopping you between grabbing beers and innings - mostly men he notices - who are itching to hear your opinions on plays. You don\u2019t seem too bothered about it, answering questions gracefully before pointing out you\u2019re on a date and he wonders if this is standard for you, if it\u2019s the true reason you prefer your box seating.<br></p><p>It\u2019s another question for another time - this wasn\u2019t the setting for that kind of reflection so instead when he gets a chance he asks, </p><p>\u201cYou know - you don\u2019t seem like a baseball watching kind of woman to me.\u201d</p><p>You laugh at him as you finish scurrying into your seat, the two beers in your hand splashing over your fingers. \u00a0You blow on them, the sun had set hours ago and the cold east coast air was starting to bite through your Yankees lined bomber jacket. This was round number four for you both and you still had three innings left. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d You nod as the horn signaling the end of the seventh inning goes off. You both opt to sit down, taking the opportunity for the next five minutes to rest your feet.</p><p>\u201cBut you are quite knowledgeable about baseball. I think even beyond what you need to know for your job.\u201d Steve counters and you smile, shaking your head as he throws his arm around you, allowing himself to be bold and you lean into his embrace easily.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d You take a sip of your beer watching him.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026..the story goes?\u201d</p><p>You laugh again, nodding your head to the side, biting your lip. When the time in your relationship came, he was going to learn how to tame that habit of yours. It was driving him crazy.</p><p>\u201cNothing complicated. I\u2019m a New York girl. My grandfather took me to games, then my father. I liked sports so it was easy, learning the intricacies of the game. I guess\u2026..I was close to my grandpa \u2013 my dad. So it\u2019s a way to keep them close to me, you know.\u201d</p><p>He nods and you lean into him, blinking up at him innocently,</p><p>\u201cWhat about you? What got you into baseball.\u201d</p><p>Steve laughs, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cTwo words. 1927 Yankees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurderer\u2019s Row.\u201d You whistle underneath your breath and he smiles, nodding.</p><p>\u201cI saw Babe Ruth play in this stadium. Lou Geghrig. Dimaggio. That was\u2026to see that group of men play a sport with the athletic finesse they did - \u00a0you just didn\u2019t get any better than that you know? I think it was the games in 1932. Bucky and I spent any free dime and nickel we could get our hands on to go. So much so that during the Yankees winning streak, we had drained our resources and right around my birthday. I was devastated. Bucky could only spare so much - his pop had died a few years back in the war and with three younger sisters to feed he felt guilty as it was to spend the money selfishly on the games. </p><p>But unbeknownst to me, my mom had been working double down at the factory despite the cancer that was eating at her to get me and Bucky tickets. She knew how much I loved baseball and wanted to get me a nice gift for my birthday. Bucky was thrilled, charmed a dame to buy us a hot dog we had to share and we had to hitchhike back home because we didn\u2019t have enough bus or subway fare but\u2026.standing in that stadium and watching that team play against the Pirates. Nothing like it.\u201d</p><p>He remembers how hot it\u2019d been, that it had triggered his asthma no matter how many layers he peeled off. It was the smoke from the fireworks that had resulted in pneumonia the next day and he had been out of commission for a week. \u00a0It hadn\u2019t mattered, standing beside Bucky in this stadium, watching a group of men play a game that made him forget for a few hours that he was feeble, sick Steve Rogers but just a part of the crowd, the memory makes him smile. Makes him feel like himself.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like a nice memory.\u201d You whisper to him and it causes him to shift his eyes back to you, pulling him back into the present.</p><p>\u201cIt was. Feels like yesterday\u201d He looks back onto the field as the game starts up and you nudge him, your hands finding his own and intertwining with them.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you sitting when it happened?,\u201d you look around, squinting before smiling and point to the north side of the stadium. \u201cI was sitting over there my first time. Fucking nosebleeds but Derek Jetter had been on fire that night. My grandfather was so happy and excited, the Yankees winning the most games that season in a long time. He had been grooming me on baseball for years, he was so enthusiastic about the sport and my family pitched in to get us the tickets. </p><p>It was exciting to take the train from Queens to the The Bronx. It was the first time I\u2019d been on the subway that long, my eight year old self eagerly drinking in everything as my grandpa quizzed me on the basic rules of baseball. He could\u2019ve taken anyone - my older brother loved baseball as much as him and he had been pissed when I got the ticket but grandfather was insistent it had to be me. Said there was something special about my voice when I talked about sports. I like to come here and remember how I felt in that moment\u2026\u201d</p><p>Your face has washed over in nostalgia, smiling deeply as you lean into his shoulder, trying to block off a gust of wind that was blowing through the stadium. Steve looks around, before looking up and pointing, </p><p>\u201cIt was actually in this section\u2026but also in the nosebleeds. It had a beautiful view of everything and Bucky and I sat there every time we got our hands on a ticket,\u201d he laughs, shaking his head and drawing you closer to him, rubbing your arms as you shiver underneath your jacket. \u201cBucky had to carry me up the stairs every time toward the end, I couldn\u2019t breath after the first three flights. I\u2019m pretty sure I went through my whole inhaler between the wet air and those stairs.\u201d</p><p>You laugh as you look up at him, giving his hand a squeeze.</p><p>\u201cSports bring people together. That\u2019s why I do it - write. There\u2019s all the fucking politics and shady shit around it sure but it brings out this. Those happy moments that define us as humans.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s not prepared for you. Doesn\u2019t think he\u2019d be able to be, life had thrown you in his path when he had made peace with functioning alone in the world. He doesn\u2019t want that now that he\u2019s met you, wants to spend every second of his breath moving forward in being a part of your world in some way. </p><p>There\u2019s a moment that the loud stadium noise fades away, where he forgets where he\u2019s at as you both look at each other and there\u2019s the familiar knot that spreads in his stomach since he\u2019s met you. You\u2019re a siren calling him home and he leans down to press his lips against your own, needing to see. </p><p>You taste like a first kiss. Your lips are feathery and lush and he moves his beer between his legs so he can press his cold hand against your warm cheek, pull you closer to him. Your perfume overwhelms him and he doesn\u2019t need anything deeper than the satisfaction of your lips on top of his own. To feel your hand wrap over his as you kiss him back sweetly, the game an afterthought. </p><p>He was in trouble.</p><p>You were in trouble.</p><p>Both of you are too involved with the other to notice the fan that discreetly snaps your photo.</p><hr><p><b>Tag List:\u00a0\n\n</b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLmzyrERLwPWt7oIavzcIkw\">@geminimoonbeamx</a> <b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtaWaN_ighiYYScW7vLIC9w\">@ssweet-empowerment</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mi9ImHMJh5OaxHZPdeYy1LQ\">@capsofwinchesters</a>@<a href=\"http://tacohead13.tumblr.com/\">tacohead13</a>@<a href=\"http://harleycativy.tumblr.com/\">harleycativy</a>@<a href=\"http://pietrotheavenger.tumblr.com/\">pietrotheavenger</a>@<a href=\"http://francezka10.tumblr.com/\">francezka10</a>@<a href=\"http://papichulosebastian.tumblr.com/\">papichulosebastian</a>@<a href=\"http://obsessionsofmynerdheart.tumblr.com/\">obsessionsofmynerdheart</a>@<a href=\"http://melaninmarvel.tumblr.com/\">melaninmarvel</a>@<a href=\"http://avengedqueen26.tumblr.com/\">avengedqueen26</a>@<a href=\"http://nasteaxluvgal.tumblr.com/\">nasteaxluvgal</a>@<a href=\"https://winterbuttmunch.tumblr.com/\">winterbuttmunch</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbe29vW7LW2QdFTGx-XIrJg\">@nys30</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQpGSysFQQ2_z6AQ8OgRSAg\">@buckyslongasshair</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbqZ-ncss0ZkPEoFPX5I76g\">@ohlumi</a>@wellthirsted @<a href=\"http://gifsbysimplysonia.tumblr.com/\">gifsbysimplysonia</a> @misskenni <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSV8_iEBdIrspRVXhUIecAQ\">@harleycativy</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB7Vy5g26g5-LAZcceFvi3g\">@maraudereestauderelb</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8Ag-2kNfXKRbOu7yIBRYcQ\">@chrisevans-sexualfrustrations</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBHPHqRE0Z92Ed5hlLvX6vA\">@xceafh</a>@misskenni</b></p><p>TAGS ARE STILL OPEN!\u00a0</p>",

Humans are simple creatures by design &ndash; inspired and ruined by the same motivations. It&rsquo;s only when they are aware their voice is heard that feelings like guilt and apology come into play. </p><p>Steve used to think his super hearing, like most of his abilities, was a curse. It forced him to be witness to peoples move private and intimate conversations &ndash; forcing him into strangers lives. Over time, he had to learn how to tune humans out. He was tired of hearing the same things, tired of the anxiety that arose from jumping from one conversation to another. While he believed in the beauty of humanity &ndash; believed that him and his species were worth fighting for &ndash; it was becoming dull to have to listen to the same conversations repeat themselves, to never pinpoint the simpler of solutions. </p><p>That humans were restless and craved conflict.</p><p>He should know. </p><p>It was how he felt 90% of the time. </p><p>So, as he stood in a stadium that had the capacity to hold over 54,000 he had realized the error in his ways. He was trying to find you &ndash; the service on his cell phone had failed him at his current location and the only sure way he knew how to find you in a crowd was to listen for your voice. But to listen for your voice meant he had to jump into the world of the thousands of people around him and his brain was feeling overstimulated, not used to ingesting so much stimulation and data at once, not since he trained it to do otherwise in social situations like this. Between the yelling and screaming and laughing &ndash; the people who were moving past him quickly and brushing against his body he felt like screaming, like bursting out and finding safety at higher ground.</p><p>It was how he felt back when breathing felt like a chore and the only time girls laid eyes on him was when they realized he was Bucky&rsquo;s sad best friend. </p><p>Being in crowds made him insecure. Which is why he preferred to watch from the wings. </p><p>He looked down at his screen, trying to see if the text he typed for you was sent but his phone was still doing that circling thing that Bucky called the wheel of death, so he assumed not. </p><p>He should have been more specific. Texting was more of a chore than a convenience. </p><p>He had given in to finally getting the writing service on his phone, right after he had made amends with you in your office. He had immediately asked Bucky to meet him at the cell phone store he had purchased his flip phone at to get texting put on the older device. Which had caused Bucky to guffaw because he really needed a new phone but Steve was insistent on keeping his old one and Bucky wasn&rsquo;t going to argue against it for the uptenth time again. So he patiently helped Steve figure out the simple buttons to send you a text, which had been a bust the next day when he was ready to send you a message.</p><p>It was Sam that stood next to him after their morning training, patiently helping &nbsp;him click out the words over stiff buttons to send off to you,</p><p>I have texting on my phone so I can be better at staying in touch with you. How is your day?</p><p>The message had taken him an ashamedly twenty minutes to get out but he did, hearing from you immediately. The week continued with that cadence, you texting him goodnight and him texting you good morning. Finding opportunities to get to know each other a bit more, your texts coming in long paragraphs that his phone broke up in 5 pages while he sent multiple smaller texts, frustrated with the machine. So when you had texted him earlier that afternoon with the simple message of,</p><p>Excited to see you tonight! Yankee&rsquo;s Stadium, 6pm. SW entrance</p><p>He hadn&rsquo;t thought to follow up to ask which southwest entrance. There were at least four, and they were all crowded and similar and he was feeling anxious trying to find you among the waves and waves of people walking in.</p><p>He was tempted to walk and find an area where he would find service, where he could call or text you to get clarification, but it&rsquo;s at that moment he senses someone walking behind him, not as silent as they were hoping as they lift their hands. Its instinctual as he turns, easily catching your wrists that are in mid air quickly as you gasp, your eyes growing larger as you let out a breathy &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p><p>Even though his breathing is measured, his heart is beating fast as he allows his eyes to take you in, to realize that he&rsquo;s in a public space and you don&rsquo;t mean any harm to him, the people around him. You shift your wrists in his embrace and he realizes that he&rsquo;s grabbed them too tight and he immediately pulls away as you give a side smile, your eyes relaxing as you let out,</p><p>&ldquo;Serves me right, thinking I could sneak up behind you. I just wanted to see if you could guess who I was but that was a short lived idea.&rdquo;</p><p>You&rsquo;re laughing, not offended at all as you pull out your phone and start scrolling through it. You look back up at him and smile, nodding for him to follow you into the long line to get into the stadium. He wants to tell you that he hated surprises, that they usually always resulted like this, him aggressively and unexpectedly ruining a nice gesture because he was always on edge. Instead, he pushes it down as you look back up at him, the first time he&rsquo;s seen you relaxed and happy around him since the start of your relationship and he smiles back,</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you credit for trying. Not a lot of women bold enough to try to out play me but unfortunately for us both, I&rsquo;ll always be quicker. My DNA gives me that advantage.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ohhh humble are we,&rdquo; you say as you show the man your tickets on your phone, motioning it&rsquo;s for you and Steve as he ushers you towards security. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never surprise me because I&rsquo;m smarter, faster, stronger. Ok Kanye.&rdquo;</p><p>Your voice is teasing as you give the security guard your purse to look through, before you walk through the security strip. It takes a beat and grants him the opportunity to quickly pull out the small notebook he keeps in his back pocket, to scribble down how he thinks one would write Kanye (with a C like the pepper?), multiple question marks beside it before placing the small book back in his pocket. He follows your lead through security, remembering a time where you could trust the people in the world to not cause havoc at places of joy as he tries to pinpoint the reference you&rsquo;ve dropped. </p><p>What the heck was a Kanye and why was everyone in this city always referencing him? If you brought it up it must be somewhat important so he&rsquo;d make sure to ask Sam or Clint next time he saw them.</p><p>He&rsquo;s surprised when he&rsquo;s moved through security and you&rsquo;re no longer standing in the spot you had been previously, waiting for him. Instead there&rsquo;s just the group of people passing by, trying to get to their seats. He feels panic rise in his chest, his hands going damp. </p><p>Where could you have gone that quickly? </p><p>It&rsquo;s seconds later he&rsquo;s rewarded to you throwing your body on his back, your arms wrapping around his broad shoulders as your legs squeeze around his middle,</p><p>&ldquo;How about now soldier?&rdquo; you whisper in his ear, your voice dark and sultry, &ldquo;Is this quick enough for you?&rdquo;</p><p>Its intimate the position you&rsquo;re in, his hand instinctively finding the back of your thighs as you tighten around him. He shifts you higher up on his back, causing you to squeal as you tighten your hold around him and he likes the sound that slips out your mouth, wants to see how else he can pull it out of you. </p><p>&ldquo;You just had to prove me wrong didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he states, trying to look over his shoulder and you giggle, moving enough to look back into his eyes,</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me I&rsquo;m not fast enough, even for you. You should know now, &nbsp;I will dedicate every minute of my life to proving you otherwise. I don&rsquo;t do &lsquo;can&rsquo;t&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Your breath hits his face, the mixture of mint mingling with your perfume. He becomes aware of how his hands tease the soft muscle underneath your thighs, the soft way your stomach and breast press against his hard back, the way the bills of your hat awkwardly hit each other, causing you to drift closer.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re ridiculous. But point made.&rdquo; He smiles at you, giving your legs a squeeze and you giggle, biting your lip as you wiggle in his embrace.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok Mr. Rogers, now you&rsquo;ve made your point and you&rsquo;ve impressed me. You&rsquo;re able to lift my thick figure with ease. But I&rsquo;m sure the hoards of New York and Boston baseball fans that are pushing around us aren&rsquo;t as appreciative of your skills.&rdquo;</p><p>You move to fall down from his back, laughing as you adjust to being back on ground. He wants to tell you that he likes your thick figure, that you have meat on your bones that compliments you and you weighed nothing at all. But you&rsquo;re onto the next thing, your eyes surveying the place.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok, first things first. We find beer. Then we find our seats. Then you have to impress me with your dazzling baseball knowledge. And if you impress me, maybe you get a second date. Or&hellip;.you get stuck in the friend safe zone if I find you unable to keep up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh really?&rdquo; he asks, quirking an eyebrow at you. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. You were the one who stood me up, remember.&rdquo; </p><p>You were right about that. </p><p>&ldquo;Fair. It&rsquo;s your call. This time.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You saying there&rsquo;s going to be a next?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I know there is.&rdquo; he says confidently and you laugh as you pull the straps of your purse as you put your phone back into the satchel before your smiling up at him,</p><p>&ldquo;Ok Cap. Follow me.&rdquo;</p><p>You move quickly, fast surprisingly considering the thickness of the crowd, but he&rsquo;s able to keep up with your frame. He wasn&rsquo;t used to this, someone else taking charge that wasn&rsquo;t Tony and he likes how confident you are, the fact that you knew what you wanted and wasn&rsquo;t afraid to go for it. You get him to the escalator with speed and smile at him as the moving stairs give you the vantage point of temporary high ground</p><p>&ldquo;What does it mean to have box seats?&rdquo; he finally asks, curious as you both look around in silence. &ldquo;Everyone at the tower are impressed that you&rsquo;re able to provide them and I&rsquo;m not sure why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Means we have one of the best views in the park and never have to leave the space for booze and food. It&rsquo;s just a fancy word of saying you are isolated from the public and get good amenities along with the game.&rdquo;</p><p>Oh. </p><p>You didn&rsquo;t seem like the kind of girl who liked to sit in isolation, away from it all in areas of athletics. While he could appreciate the privacy, he was always nostalgic of watching a good baseball game with others. </p><p>There was nothing like comradery amongst strangers. </p><p>You flicker your eyes back to him, note he&rsquo;s uneasy as you clear your throat, </p><p>&ldquo;That sounded cocky. Let me correct myself&hellip;the seats aren&rsquo;t mine. Honestly, there the companies. They&rsquo;ll be three other people, journalists with us in the box. It&rsquo;s honestly just a nice place to watch the game if you&rsquo;re also trying to write down highlights for your article. Outside of that it&rsquo;s just convenience and a way to isolate from the crowd. Which really bums me out once I&rsquo;m done working, half of the fun at baseball is the crowd.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve nods, looking around him,</p><p>&ldquo;I know it may not seem it, but I like watching the game with a group of people too. I&rsquo;ve seen some of the best games and had some of the best conversations with just kind, random strangers.&rdquo;</p><p>You watch him curiously, leaning against the rail of the escalator before saying,</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose you were able to see some of the best baseball in the history of baseball on this soil. Box seats wouldn&rsquo;t impress you much, now that I think about it. Hmmm.&rdquo;</p><p>You give a wry smile and he realizes that he&rsquo;s done that thing again, where he&rsquo;s embarrassed you by defaulting to his simple ways and he&rsquo;s quick to place a gentle hand on your hips,</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m excited! It&rsquo;s a new experience and I get to talk with you and three other people who study baseball for a living. But mainly, I get one on one time with you.&rdquo;</p><p>That was at least true. While he would prefer normal seats, the only upside of this opportunity was being able to be so intimately close with you. You respond by laughing, resting your hand on his shoulder,</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re kind Steve. I didn&rsquo;t even think you&rsquo;d mind being with others&hellip;.that was a selfish oversight of mine. My friend asked me to come to help him with his article, he likes my input and I thought it would be fun for us. But I see now&hellip;.I shouldn&rsquo;t have thought you were the kind of man who would have found it interesting. And maybe&hellip;maybe I was trying not to make a big deal out of this date.&rdquo;</p><p>He chuckles, his hands squeezing your hips, </p><p>&ldquo;Why? Because I disappointed you once and you were worried it would happen again so you wanted back up.&rdquo; </p><p>You giggle as you lean into him, giving his shoulder a swat, </p><p>&ldquo;Can you blame me! You real life disappeared for days&hellip;.and it was after I was already speculative of letting you in the first place.&rdquo;</p><p>Your voice is light but you keep your eyes focused on everything but his face and he realizes that he had really disappointed you. Which, in turn, makes him feel disappointed in himself. </p><p>The last thing he wanted to do in any capacity was hurt you. </p><p>Especially when you were making it clear that you were still unsure about having anything to do with him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about that and I promise you it will never happen again. I even got texting on my phone!&rdquo; he makes a point to pull out his phone, that automatically causes you to erupt in laughter, causing strangers to look over. </p><p>&ldquo;Holy shit. You must be serious&hellip;.I bet getting texting on that thing was a migraine for the technician.&rdquo; </p><p>Your smiling back at him, the one that is all teeth and causes his stomach to dance and he squeezes your hips one more time. </p><p>&ldquo;Bucky can happily let you know the pain I went through for you. Or more so that technician.&rdquo; </p><p>You both reach the top of the escalator, stepping off for the second level and you look around. Your quick as you find your target, causing him to stumble after you as you make your way to the daughter and father duo,</p><p>&ldquo;Hello, sorry do you have a few seconds to talk?,&rdquo; &nbsp;you pull your badge out of your bag as you continue &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a reporter for ESPN and I have a proposition for you.&rdquo;</p><p>The father looks at the badge, impressed as the daughter tugs on his legs, looking out onto the field.</p><p>&ldquo;I have these box seats for the game and my friend and I kinda want to be in the crowd &ndash; we&rsquo;ve been there all season you know. Would you be ok with switching? I know it&rsquo;s last minute and super random but it&rsquo;s just other reporters and you&rsquo;d have some first hand advantage for any bets you might have? And I much rather give my seats to you than some rowdy douchebag.&rdquo;</p><p>Your voice is light and sincere and the man looks at you in disbelief before asking,</p><p>&ldquo;Are you Ariadne Bellamy? The Ariadne Bellamy who writes for All Bets on Me?&rdquo;</p><p>You scrunch your eyes together before nodding,</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;..&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god &ndash; you helped me so much last season with your blog. Yes! We&rsquo;d love that. My daughter has really gotten into the sport and it&rsquo;s fun being in the ranks but it&rsquo;d be nice to watch a playoff game away from all the rowdiness. Besides I can tell all my friends how the Ariadne Bellamy gave me her seats.&rdquo; </p><p>You both exchange email addresses, sending him your box suite information as he exchanges the tickets in his hands. When you return back to Steve, you do so with a large grin on our face.</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t have to do that Ariadne.&rdquo; Steve says quietly and you roll your eyes, shrugging.</p><p>&ldquo;Jacob jumps on the opportunity to talk with real fans. Helps his article. And honestly, he&rsquo;ll text me if he really needs help. I want you to be comfortable for our date and if you&rsquo;d prefer to be down with the others, I&rsquo;m game. Though I&rsquo;m still using my company credit card for beer. That&rsquo;s the best perk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I mean, you didn&rsquo;t have to be so nice to a stranger and yet you were.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Captain America questioning my moral code of conduct? Oh boy.&rdquo; </p><p>You have that teasing tone in your voice again and he laughs, grabbing your hand and giving it a small squeeze,</p><p>&ldquo;Not at all. It&rsquo;s just&hellip;.refreshing. Of all the people you could have given it to, you were intentional to give it to someone who you knew it would mean a lot to. It&rsquo;s a unique kind of selflessness that&rsquo;s hard to find nowadays. It&rsquo;s makes you an exceptional person&hellip;.&rdquo; he drifts as you look up at him, softened features etching your face and he clears his throat, &ldquo;Anyways, you got us into the game. Let me take care of the rest.&rdquo;</p><p>You don&rsquo;t object as you both head to find your seats, neither of you stopping to pull your hands away from the other.</p><p>You both miss most of the first inning, the line to grab cheap hot dogs and beer longer than he&rsquo;d like. You lean into making this experience authentic, though he&rsquo;s pretty sure that your arguing to hold two baskets of hot dogs and beers is a learned behavior from your overprotective and natural maternal relationship with Ellie. When he insists that he&rsquo;ll carry the beers and you can focus on the dogs you hesitantly agree, though by the time your walking down the steep stairs to your seats you give a grateful sigh that you weren&rsquo;t stuck with the bitter, golden liquid he was balancing behind you. It&rsquo;s not until your both sitting down that he automatically regrets his decision.</p><p>&ldquo;You know what the difference is between watching the 1932 Yankees then versus now?&rdquo; he asks as you look over at him, &ldquo;I was a lot smaller. When did stadium seating get so&hellip;.compact?&rdquo;</p><p>You laugh as you shake your head, falling back into your seat and leaning into his large frame.</p><p>&ldquo;Always! They just make it for small people. If you have curves or a large Adonis frame like ourselves, you just gotta get up and grab more beer to deal with the stiffness in your legs.&rdquo;</p><p>He smiles as he hands a beer to you,</p><p>&ldquo;Well, to authenticity.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To authenticity.&rdquo; </p><p>You both toast, the promise of a fun night hanging in the air.</p><hr /><p>The game is fast paced. After you both inhale your hot dogs, you&rsquo;re never given the opportunity to sit down. The teams are too equally matched in skill, causing the stadium to spend most of its time standing and yelling at the field, at other fans, you and Steve included between alternating grabbing drinks. There&rsquo;s a few people that recognizes him, he can see the wide eye glimmer in their eyes before they look away but he&rsquo;s lucky that they haven&rsquo;t boldly gone over to ask for his autograph or photo. It&rsquo;s in contrast to you, who has multiple people stopping you between grabbing beers and innings - mostly men he notices - who are itching to hear your opinions on plays. You don&rsquo;t seem too bothered about it, answering questions gracefully before pointing out you&rsquo;re on a date and he wonders if this is standard for you, if it&rsquo;s the true reason you prefer your box seating.<br /></p><p>It&rsquo;s another question for another time - this wasn&rsquo;t the setting for that kind of reflection so instead when he gets a chance he asks, </p><p>&ldquo;You know - you don&rsquo;t seem like a baseball watching kind of woman to me.&rdquo;</p><p>You laugh at him as you finish scurrying into your seat, the two beers in your hand splashing over your fingers. &nbsp;You blow on them, the sun had set hours ago and the cold east coast air was starting to bite through your Yankees lined bomber jacket. This was round number four for you both and you still had three innings left. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo; You nod as the horn signaling the end of the seventh inning goes off. You both opt to sit down, taking the opportunity for the next five minutes to rest your feet.</p><p>&ldquo;But you are quite knowledgeable about baseball. I think even beyond what you need to know for your job.&rdquo; Steve counters and you smile, shaking your head as he throws his arm around you, allowing himself to be bold and you lean into his embrace easily.</p><p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo; You take a sip of your beer watching him.</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip;..the story goes?&rdquo;</p><p>You laugh again, nodding your head to the side, biting your lip. When the time in your relationship came, he was going to learn how to tame that habit of yours. It was driving him crazy.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing complicated. I&rsquo;m a New York girl. My grandfather took me to games, then my father. I liked sports so it was easy, learning the intricacies of the game. I guess&hellip;..I was close to my grandpa &ndash; my dad. So it&rsquo;s a way to keep them close to me, you know.&rdquo;</p><p>He nods and you lean into him, blinking up at him innocently,</p><p>&ldquo;What about you? What got you into baseball.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve laughs, shaking his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Two words. 1927 Yankees.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Murderer&rsquo;s Row.&rdquo; You whistle underneath your breath and he smiles, nodding.</p><p>&ldquo;I saw Babe Ruth play in this stadium. Lou Geghrig. Dimaggio. That was&hellip;to see that group of men play a sport with the athletic finesse they did - &nbsp;you just didn&rsquo;t get any better than that you know? I think it was the games in 1932. Bucky and I spent any free dime and nickel we could get our hands on to go. So much so that during the Yankees winning streak, we had drained our resources and right around my birthday. I was devastated. Bucky could only spare so much - his pop had died a few years back in the war and with three younger sisters to feed he felt guilty as it was to spend the money selfishly on the games. </p><p>But unbeknownst to me, my mom had been working double down at the factory despite the cancer that was eating at her to get me and Bucky tickets. She knew how much I loved baseball and wanted to get me a nice gift for my birthday. Bucky was thrilled, charmed a dame to buy us a hot dog we had to share and we had to hitchhike back home because we didn&rsquo;t have enough bus or subway fare but&hellip;.standing in that stadium and watching that team play against the Pirates. Nothing like it.&rdquo;</p><p>He remembers how hot it&rsquo;d been, that it had triggered his asthma no matter how many layers he peeled off. It was the smoke from the fireworks that had resulted in pneumonia the next day and he had been out of commission for a week. &nbsp;It hadn&rsquo;t mattered, standing beside Bucky in this stadium, watching a group of men play a game that made him forget for a few hours that he was feeble, sick Steve Rogers but just a part of the crowd, the memory makes him smile. Makes him feel like himself.</p><p>&ldquo;That sounds like a nice memory.&rdquo; You whisper to him and it causes him to shift his eyes back to you, pulling him back into the present.</p><p>&ldquo;It was. Feels like yesterday&rdquo; He looks back onto the field as the game starts up and you nudge him, your hands finding his own and intertwining with them.</p><p>&ldquo;Where were you sitting when it happened?,&rdquo; you look around, squinting before smiling and point to the north side of the stadium. &ldquo;I was sitting over there my first time. Fucking nosebleeds but Derek Jetter had been on fire that night. My grandfather was so happy and excited, the Yankees winning the most games that season in a long time. He had been grooming me on baseball for years, he was so enthusiastic about the sport and my family pitched in to get us the tickets. </p><p>It was exciting to take the train from Queens to the The Bronx. It was the first time I&rsquo;d been on the subway that long, my eight year old self eagerly drinking in everything as my grandpa quizzed me on the basic rules of baseball. He could&rsquo;ve taken anyone - my older brother loved baseball as much as him and he had been pissed when I got the ticket but grandfather was insistent it had to be me. Said there was something special about my voice when I talked about sports. I like to come here and remember how I felt in that moment&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Your face has washed over in nostalgia, smiling deeply as you lean into his shoulder, trying to block off a gust of wind that was blowing through the stadium. Steve looks around, before looking up and pointing, </p><p>&ldquo;It was actually in this section&hellip;but also in the nosebleeds. It had a beautiful view of everything and Bucky and I sat there every time we got our hands on a ticket,&rdquo; he laughs, shaking his head and drawing you closer to him, rubbing your arms as you shiver underneath your jacket. &ldquo;Bucky had to carry me up the stairs every time toward the end, I couldn&rsquo;t breath after the first three flights. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I went through my whole inhaler between the wet air and those stairs.&rdquo;</p><p>You laugh as you look up at him, giving his hand a squeeze.</p><p>&ldquo;Sports bring people together. That&rsquo;s why I do it - write. There&rsquo;s all the fucking politics and shady shit around it sure but it brings out this. Those happy moments that define us as humans.&rdquo;</p><p>He&rsquo;s not prepared for you. Doesn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d be able to be, life had thrown you in his path when he had made peace with functioning alone in the world. He doesn&rsquo;t want that now that he&rsquo;s met you, wants to spend every second of his breath moving forward in being a part of your world in some way. </p><p>There&rsquo;s a moment that the loud stadium noise fades away, where he forgets where he&rsquo;s at as you both look at each other and there&rsquo;s the familiar knot that spreads in his stomach since he&rsquo;s met you. You&rsquo;re a siren calling him home and he leans down to press his lips against your own, needing to see. </p><p>You taste like a first kiss. Your lips are feathery and lush and he moves his beer between his legs so he can press his cold hand against your warm cheek, pull you closer to him. Your perfume overwhelms him and he doesn&rsquo;t need anything deeper than the satisfaction of your lips on top of his own. To feel your hand wrap over his as you kiss him back sweetly, the game an afterthought. </p><p>He was in trouble.</p><p>You were in trouble.</p><p>Both of you are too involved with the other to notice the fan that discreetly snaps your photo.</p><hr /><p><b>Tag List:&nbsp;\n\n</b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLmzyrERLwPWt7oIavzcIkw\">@geminimoonbeamx</a> <b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtaWaN_ighiYYScW7vLIC9w\">@ssweet-empowerment</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mi9ImHMJh5OaxHZPdeYy1LQ\">@capsofwinchesters</a>@<a href=\"http://tacohead13.tumblr.com/\">tacohead13</a>@<a href=\"http://harleycativy.tumblr.com/\">harleycativy</a>@<a href=\"http://pietrotheavenger.tumblr.com/\">pietrotheavenger</a>@<a href=\"http://francezka10.tumblr.com/\">francezka10</a>@<a href=\"http://papichulosebastian.tumblr.com/\">papichulosebastian</a>@<a href=\"http://obsessionsofmynerdheart.tumblr.com/\">obsessionsofmynerdheart</a>@<a href=\"http://melaninmarvel.tumblr.com/\">melaninmarvel</a>@<a href=\"http://avengedqueen26.tumblr.com/\">avengedqueen26</a>@<a href=\"http://nasteaxluvgal.tumblr.com/\">nasteaxluvgal</a>@<a href=\"https://winterbuttmunch.tumblr.com/\">winterbuttmunch</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbe29vW7LW2QdFTGx-XIrJg\">@nys30</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQpGSysFQQ2_z6AQ8OgRSAg\">@buckyslongasshair</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbqZ-ncss0ZkPEoFPX5I76g\">@ohlumi</a>@wellthirsted @<a href=\"http://gifsbysimplysonia.tumblr.com/\">gifsbysimplysonia</a> @misskenni <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSV8_iEBdIrspRVXhUIecAQ\">@harleycativy</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB7Vy5g26g5-LAZcceFvi3g\">@maraudereestauderelb</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8Ag-2kNfXKRbOu7yIBRYcQ\">@chrisevans-sexualfrustrations</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBHPHqRE0Z92Ed5hlLvX6vA\">@xceafh</a>@misskenni</b></p><p>TAGS ARE STILL OPEN!&nbsp;</p>",

Humans are simple creatures by design &ndash; inspired and ruined by the same motivations. It&rsquo;s only when they are aware their voice is heard that feelings like guilt and apology come into play. </p>\n<p>Steve used to think his super hearing, like most of his abilities, was a curse. It forced him to be witness to peoples move private and intimate conversations &ndash; forcing him into strangers lives. Over time, he had to learn how to tune humans out. He was tired of hearing the same things, tired of the anxiety that arose from jumping from one conversation to another. While he believed in the beauty of humanity &ndash; believed that him and his species were worth fighting for &ndash; it was becoming dull to have to listen to the same conversations repeat themselves, to never pinpoint the simpler of solutions. </p>\n<p>That humans were restless and craved conflict.</p>\n<p>He should know. </p>\n<p>It was how he felt 90% of the time. </p>\n</p>",
