Arya held Sansa\u2019s box in her hands with a guilty expression after being scolded by her brothers for pulling such pranks and now she had to return it herself. Robb flung the door open, revealing Sansa screaming and thrashing around, throwing everything in sight at you and you being on the verge of tears.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not her fault.\u201d Jon spoke calmly, but in a loud enough voice for Sansa to hear.

Your betrothed, Robb Stark stood between you and Frey, calm as ever. You were the most beautiful of Walder Frey\u2019s many children and certainly smarter than most and that caught the attention of the young King in the North when Walder permitted him to choose a wife.\u00a0\u201cI did nothing wrong.\u201c you looked at your father dead in the eyes, which only made him angrier.

Robb stepped up to him with a smirk on his face&nbsp;&ldquo;She tells the truth, m&rsquo;lord.&ldquo; he said with amusement&nbsp;&ldquo;Because the man she was caught with was me.&ldquo;<br /></p><p><b>Benjen Stark</b></p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"2\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>You both knew what you were getting yourselves into ever since the start of your relationship. And what you got yourselves into now was something very serious. The Night&rsquo;s Watch had caught you both red handed as Benjen was making his way inside your home.&nbsp;&ldquo;You, whore!&rdquo; Yoren yelled and stepped forward to hit you, but Benjen stopped him by grabbing his hand&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not her fault!&rdquo; he yelled back&nbsp;&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t a whore! It was me! I seduced her!&rdquo; Yoren only seemed to get angrier&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you even know what this means?! You broke your vows!&rdquo; They took a moment to glare ferociously at each other. You dared not move or even breathe, afraid for Benjen and for yourself.&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you think the novices don&rsquo;t sneak out at night to Moleville? Do you think they follow the rules strictly? Of course they run in the arms of whores and you know it!&rdquo; For a moment Yoren seemed to assimilate his words and he bit his lip&nbsp;&ldquo;The watch isn&rsquo;t what it used to be.&rdquo; he spat out and slammed the door shut on his way out.</p><p><b>Jaime Lannister</b></p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"3\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>Jaime stopped in his tracks when he heard a poor townsman talking rather loudly to a group of men and women. He wasn&rsquo;t going to turn so much attention if he hadn&rsquo;t heard the name of the noble lady Y/N L/N.&nbsp;&ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t stop sending me love letters. I can even show you! In half of them she even begged me to fuck her! What a riot!&rdquo; Jaime felt anger brewing in him as he stormed over to the crowd and pushed everyone away until he got to the man who was talking. Everyone moved away from his path, frightened and some of them even tried to shush the man, but he ignored them.&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you really think a woman as noble and beautiful as lady Y/N would possibly beg you to fuck her? You, who got out of the swinery moments ago?&rdquo; Jaime yelled, startling the peasant &ldquo;I forbid gossip about lady L/N by order of the queen herself!&rdquo; he turned towards the crowd.</p><p><b>Sandor Clegane</b></p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"4\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>You boldly slapped Cersei across the face&nbsp;&ldquo;You talk so much it&rsquo;s becoming annoying.&rdquo; you snarled at her, which only angered her more. You were the only one as it seems, to not suck up to her and that&rsquo;s why she hated you. You spoke up to her and weren&rsquo;t afraid to slap her, just like you did now. Maybe she hated you more because of the fact that you were close with king Robert. &ldquo;How dare you? I will have the entire King&rsquo;s guard on you!&rdquo; Cersei yelled and reached to grab you by the hair but was stopped by a clearing of a throat&nbsp;&ldquo;If you raise a hand against her, the king will have the guard on you.&rdquo; Sandor Clegane spoke indifferently, standing behind Cersei.&nbsp;&ldquo;Not if he doesn&rsquo;t find out what happened exactly. I promise you, L/N, you wouldn&rsquo;t even know what hit you.&rdquo; Cersei smirked wickedly and flipped her hair, before walking away. You merely rolled your eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t need your help, Clegane.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Arthur Dayne</b></p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"5\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>The mob was screaming and cursing at you and you were afraid to move through it to get to your destination. You wondered what you did to make the people so angry. You were a noble, but did absolutely nothing to anger everyone. But of course they didn&rsquo;t understand that. They see a rich woman and blame her for their poor state. You tried to back away into the castle again, but your chest met someone else&rsquo;s.&nbsp;&ldquo;My lady, I will escort you through the crowd, if you allow me to.&rdquo; the familiar voice of ser Arthur Dayne spoke in a soothing manner, somewhat calming you&nbsp;&ldquo;Please.&rdquo; you whispered. He gave a signal to the men behind you and they surrounded you, shielding you from the eyes of the angry peasants. Arthur wrapped his cloak around your shoulders and held you like that, his other hand on the hilt of his sword.&nbsp;</p></p>",

When an almost eighteen year old girl asks for a ball she doesn\u2019t mean a stupid golden ball to play with!\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cI meant the other kind of ball, the ball where you meet people and where people play different sort of games\u2026\u201d She softened her voice. \u201cWhere there are actual people to play with.&ldquo;</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d wanna play with you.\u201d A bright white wolf all of a sudden jumped in front of Sansa and a high pitched shriek escaped her lips. </p><p>She had no idea how he had gotten over the high walls surrounding the caste of Winterfell. Quickly she pushed herself up and she stepped back, her hands in front of her. \u201cDon\u2019t come near me, please.\u201d She swallowed and looked around to see if there was maybe someone near who could help her. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d wanna play with you.\u201d The wolf had a rough, but tender voice and he cocked his head. \u201cYou sound kinda lonely.\u201d The wolf just stood there while Sansa raised her eyebrows and stared at the golden ball in her hand. </p><p>\u201cI turned eighteen. Not twelve!\u201d She raised her voice. \u201cI\u2019m not going to throw that ball away so you can steal it and bring it to your boss.\u201d She paused for a short moment and stared straight into the wolf\u2019s eyes. \u201cJust because I\u2019m a woman, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought you were.\u201d The wolf laid down and made himself comfortable. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to throw that ball if you don\u2019t want to. I was just trying to be nice.\u201d He licked his paws. \u201cI just wanna help, that\u2019s all. But if you don\u2019t want my help, fine with me.\u201d </p><!-- more --><p>Sansa licked her dry lips and she shifted her weight from one leg to the other. After a few minutes, although it could have been hours too, she sat down next to the white wolf. In absolute silence she absentmindedly played with the golden ball Robb had given her. \u201cI wanted a ball. Not this kind of ball, but a dance.\u201d Sansa wasn\u2019t sure if she talked to the wolf or herself. \u201cI wanted people from all over the North to come over. I wanted a huge orchestra to play my favorite songs. I wanted to dance all night in the arms of handsome young men who would all want me as their wife.\u201d She threw the ball up and felt it slip through her fingers when she tried to catch it again. </p><p>The ball rolled away from her, out of reach, faster and faster straight towards the pond. With a loud splash it fell into the water.</p><p>Sansa tried to get to her feet as quickly as possible, but by the time her hand went into the dirty water to reach for her useless birthday present, the ball had already sunken to the bottom. </p><p>It was just a stupid ball. She didn\u2019t care about it. She didn\u2019t need it. She didn\u2019t want it. But she also didn\u2019t want to explain to her brother why she came home without it, that it had fallen into the pond, that she had already lost it. \u201cOf course, as if this day wasn\u2019t bad enough already.\u201d Sansa fell down on her knees. Her dress was covered in mud already, but she couldn\u2019t care less about it.</p><p>For months she had been looking forward to today. She had counted down. She had really firmly believed that her brother would throw her the ball she had asked for. She had hoped that her loneliness and isolation finally would be over.</p><p>\u201cI could get that ball for you.\u201d The wolf appeared next to her. \u201cI could dive in, get the ball and bring it back to you before anyone notices it\u2019s gone.\u201d </p><p>Sansa looked up at him and her eyes widened. \u201cYou would really want to do that for me?\u201d She curled her lips up into a smile. \u201cOw please, yes, that would at least not make this day any worse\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will get that ball from you, on a few conditions.\u201d The wolf spoke firmly and Sansa\u2019s smile disappeared as quickly as it had appeared. </p><p>\u201cI thought you were just trying to be nice? I thought you wanted to help me?\u201d Sansa shook her head in disbelief, but the wolf didn\u2019t flinch, didn\u2019t move, didn\u2019t soften.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want my help when I offered it.\u201d The wolf cocked his head and turned around. \u201cAnd therefore it now comes at a price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d Sansa stood up and almost screamed, but when the wolf started to walk away from her, she realized that if she would let him go, her ball would be lost and she would have to explain Robb where it was. \u201cFine\u2026\u201d </p><p>The wolf stood still and looked over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat are the conditions?\u201d Sansa crossed her arms over her chest and the wolf turned back around. </p><p>The wolf all of a sudden seemed a lot bigger and Sansa had to force herself to straighten her back and lift her chin. \u201cI want to have dinner with you tonight.\u201d The wolf stepped closer and Sansa raised her eyebrows. </p><p>\u201cDinner? With me? You\u2019re a wolf! Robb will never let you into the castle!\u201d</p><p>The wolf either didn\u2019t hear her or simply ignored her. \u201cI want to spend the evening talking with you and then, when the night falls, I want to fall asleep at your feet, in your bed.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\u2019s jaw dropped and she opened her mouth to say something before closing it again.</p><p>\u201cDo you want that golden ball or not?\u201d</p><p>Sansa was on the brink of telling him that he could have that stupid ball, that she didn\u2019t need it, but then she once again thought about Robb, about the fact that it was his birthday present, about the fact that it was pure gold. She had been careless with it and it seemed that she was going to pay the price for it anyway. </p><p>Would it really be that bad to have dinner with this wolf? Would it really be that bad to spend the night talking to him? Would it really be that bad to have him sleep at her feet for one night? It probably wouldn\u2019t be as bad as Robb\u2019s disappointment when he found that his sister had hated his present and had already lost it.</p><p>\u201cFine, I promise all of that.\u201d Sansa licked her dry lips and shrugged. \u201cGet that ball for me and you can have dinner with me, spend the evening talking with me and\u2026\u201d She hesitated for a moment. \u201cTonight you can sleep in my bed. At my feet.\u201d She made sure to emphasize the last part.</p><p>The wolf grinned at her and then he jumped into the water. Only a few seconds later he already emerged again with the golden ball between his sharp teeth. He dropped the ball at Sansa\u2019s feet and then he shuddered his wet fur dry. \u201cLead me to the castle, princess.\u201d</p><p>Sansa bent down and grabbed the ball while she thought about everything that had just happened. \u201cI&rsquo;m sorry, but don\u2019t you think that the price you&rsquo;ve asked from me is a little much for the amount of work you have done? What did it take? Five seconds? Ten seconds? I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth all you&rsquo;ve asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promised me, princess.\u201d The wolf growled, but Sansa wasn\u2019t intimidated, not anymore. \u201cYou promised to let me have dinner with you. You promised to talk to me all evening. You promised me I could sleep at your feet tonight.\u201d</p><p>Sansa crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cYes, but like I said, I don\u2019t think the simple task you\u2019ve completed is worth all that.\u201d She shrugged once more. \u201cAnd like I said, it\u2019s not like Robb will let you into Winterfell in the first place.\u201d</p><p>But it seemed that Sansa was wrong about her brother, because when half an hour later Sansa appeared on the doorstep of Winterfell with the bright white wolf next to her, Robb Stark demanded both her and the wolf to tell him everything that had happened.</p><p>And so the wolf explained how the golden ball had fallen into the pond, how he had offered to get it for her, how he had wanted a few small things in return and how she had promised to give him all that, only to break her promise as soon as she realized that getting her ball back only took him a few seconds.</p><p>\u201cSansa?\u201d Robb\u2019s eyes stared straight into hers and she felt a shiver rolling down her spine. \u201cIs that true? Did you promise this wolf to have dinner with him? To spend the evening talking with him? To let him sleep at your feet tonight if he would retrieve that ball for you?\u201d</p><p>Sansa bent her head and stared at her feet. \u201cRobb, it only took him seconds!\u201d </p><p>\u201cDid you promise him?&rdquo; Robb raised his voice and Sansa let out a deep sigh.</p><p>\u201cYes, Robb, I promised him.\u201d She dropped her shoulders and she twirled a strand of her long red hair around her finger. \u201cBut really, it only took him seconds!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Stark never breaks a promise.\u201d Robb opened the door a little wider. \u201cThe wolf is welcome to have dinner with us tonight. And you will spend the entire night talking with him and you will allow him to sleep at your feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobb!\u201d Sansa threw her head in her neck. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not the one doing anything to you, Sansa. You were the one promising the wolf all of this and you shall give him what you have promised.\u201d</p><p>And with that the discussion had ended. Robb let the wolf into Winterfell and Sansa hated this day more than she had already done before she was forced to spend the rest of her birthday talking to a wolf.</p><p>But much to her surprise it wasn\u2019t as bad as she had thought it would be. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be into fairytales that much, princess.\u201d The wolf let his glance wander over all the books on the shelves in the library. \u201cYou don\u2019t really seem like the damsel in distress kinda girl.\u201d </p><p>Sansa rolled her eyes, but she couldn\u2019t help but smiling a little. \u201cI&rsquo;m not. I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApart from that time your ball fell into the pond.\u201d The wolf chuckled and Sansa fell down in one of the comfortable chairs.</p><p>\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t been there, I would\u2019ve found another way to get that ball back.\u201d</p><p>The wolf sat down next to her. \u201cOf course. That&rsquo;s why you agreed to all those things you clearly didn\u2019t wanna do.\u201d The wolf chuckled once more and Sansa decided that it was better to keep her mouth shut than to try to argue with him.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you love them so much?\u201d After a few long minutes of silence the wolf spoke again.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sansa looked up, letting go of the thoughts that had gone through her head. </p><p>\u201cFairytales. Why do love them so much?\u201d The wolf walked a little closer towards her and without really thinking about it, Sansa buried her hand in his fur. </p><p>\u201cFairytales are a promise.\u201d Sansa leaned back in her chair and her eyes drifted off. \u201cThey&rsquo;re a promise that no matter how bad things are, things will get better eventually.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cCinderella was treated like a slave for years, but eventually a fairy godmother appeared and she got everything she wanted and even more.\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe got a prince to save her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Sansa shook her head firmly. \u201cCinderella never asked for a prince. She asked for a ball, for one night of pleasure, to enjoy herself, to be away from her life.\u201d</p><p>The wolf kept silent for a moment. \u201cIs that why you asked for a ball? To get away from life?\u201d</p><p>Sansa bent her head and she folded her sweaty hands. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say that my life is bad or a hell or anything like that.\u201d Sansa fought the tears in her eyes. \u201cBut ever since dad died\u2026\u201d She felt a tear escaping and rolling down her cheek. \u201cMom doesn\u2019t care about anything anymore. She locks herself up in her room. She barely eats, she barely speaks, she barely says something.\u201d She paused for a moment. \u201cAnd Robb\u2026\u201d She swallowed while another tear escaped and rolled down her cheek. \u201cRobb is afraid that whoever killed dad will come after us too. He refuses to let me go anywhere outside these walls. And he refuses to let anyone else in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds kinda lonely\u2026\u201d The wolf moved a little closer towards Sansa, warming her legs and letting her pull his fur as much as she wanted and needed. </p><p>\u201cIf only fairy godmothers did exist\u2026\u201d Sansa wrapped her arms around the wolf. \u201cMaybe she could change things for me too.\u201d</p><p>The wolf let her cry. He didn\u2019t protest when she buried her face in his fur to dry her tears. He didn\u2019t protest when she tightened her grip. He didn\u2019t protest when she said nothing at all for hours, even though she had promised him an evening of conversation and talking.</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m sorry\u2026\u201d Sansa eventually calmed down again and when she stared at the clock she saw that it was already almost midnight. \u201cI know I\u2019ve promised to talk to you and here I am, crying like a stupid damsel in distress.\u201d</p><p>The wolf licked her hand. \u201cYou&rsquo;re not a damsel in distress, Sansa. You\u2019re human. And no human really likes being alone.\u201d</p><p>Sansa nodded and after a few more minutes she stood up from her seat. \u201cI think we should go to bed now.\u201d She walked through the hallway, climbed a few stairs and eventually she opened the door to her room. \u201cGive me a few seconds, okay?\u201d She disappeared behind the folding screen and changed into her bright white night gown. With quick movements she braided her hair and eventually she pulled back the blankets and slipped under it. </p><p>Less than a second later the wolf jumped on the bed and laid down at her feet. His warmth was pleasantly comfortable and Sansa pushed herself up a little to watch the beautiful bright white wolf at her feet once more before she would blew out the candle next to her bed. </p><p>\u201cSleep well, princess Sansa.\u201d The wolf muttered and without thinking about it Sansa leaned towards him and pressed a soft kiss on his head.</p><p>\u201cSleep we\u2026\u201d She couldn\u2019t finish her sentence. A blinding flash of light brightened her entire room and Sansa closed her eyes and covered them with her hands. \u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d When she opened her eyes again she saw that the wolf at her feet was no longer a wolf. </p><p>At her feet, where the wolf had laid, was now a naked, but handsome man. His dark curls hid one of his beautiful brown eyes, wandering over his own body as if he couldn\u2019t believe what he saw. He stared at his hands and fingers, at his feet and toes, at his bare chest, at his muscled shoulders. </p><p>Deep down Sansa knew that she should scream for help, that she should be afraid and call out for her brother. But she didn\u2019t do so. She didn\u2019t scream. She wasn\u2019t afraid and she didn\u2019t call out for her brother.</p><p>\u201cIt worked\u2026\u201d The handsome young man shook his head over and over and kept counting his fingers and toes. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it worked.\u201d He repeated that same sentence again and again and again and eventually he looked up, as if he only realized then that he was in Sansa\u2019s bedroom, at her feet, naked. \u201cThank you, princess.\u201d He stared at her and quickly he reached for the blankets to cover his nudeness. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I can ever thank you.\u201d</p><p>Sansa cocked her head and let her glance wander over the young man. She thought about how he had listened, how he had understood, how he had not laughed at her, how he had not told her that she was stupid, how he had let her dry her tears, how he had endured her holding him too tight, gripping him too firmly. \u201cYou&rsquo;re welcome\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cJon, Jon Snow.\u201d Jon smiled and Sansa smiled back at him.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Jon.\u201d Sansa moved a little closer towards him. \u201cMaybe fairy godmothers do exist.\u201d She pressed the palm of her hand to his stubbled cheek. \u201cAnd maybe, I did get the best birthday present ever I didn&rsquo;t ask for.&ldquo;</p>",

I thought you wanted to help me?\u201d Sansa shook her head in disbelief, but the wolf didn\u2019t flinch, didn\u2019t move, didn\u2019t soften.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want my help when I offered it.\u201d The wolf cocked his head and turned around. \u201cAnd therefore it now comes at a price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d Sansa stood up and almost screamed, but when the wolf started to walk away from her, she realized that if she would let him go, her ball would be lost and she would have to explain Robb where it was. \u201cFine\u2026\u201d </p><p>The wolf stood still and looked over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat are the conditions?\u201d Sansa crossed her arms over her chest and the wolf turned back around. </p><p>The wolf all of a sudden seemed a lot bigger and Sansa had to force herself to straighten her back and lift her chin. \u201cI want to have dinner with you tonight.\u201d The wolf stepped closer and Sansa raised her eyebrows. </p><p>\u201cDinner? With me? You\u2019re a wolf! Robb will never let you into the castle!\u201d</p><p>The wolf either didn\u2019t hear her or simply ignored her. \u201cI want to spend the evening talking with you and then, when the night falls, I want to fall asleep at your feet, in your bed.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\u2019s jaw dropped and she opened her mouth to say something before closing it again.</p><p>\u201cDo you want that golden ball or not?\u201d</p><p>Sansa was on the brink of telling him that he could have that stupid ball, that she didn\u2019t need it, but then she once again thought about Robb, about the fact that it was his birthday present, about the fact that it was pure gold. She had been careless with it and it seemed that she was going to pay the price for it anyway. </p><p>Would it really be that bad to have dinner with this wolf? Would it really be that bad to spend the night talking to him? Would it really be that bad to have him sleep at her feet for one night? It probably wouldn\u2019t be as bad as Robb\u2019s disappointment when he found that his sister had hated his present and had already lost it.</p><p>\u201cFine, I promise all of that.\u201d Sansa licked her dry lips and shrugged. \u201cGet that ball for me and you can have dinner with me, spend the evening talking with me and\u2026\u201d She hesitated for a moment. \u201cTonight you can sleep in my bed. At my feet.\u201d She made sure to emphasize the last part.</p><p>The wolf grinned at her and then he jumped into the water. Only a few seconds later he already emerged again with the golden ball between his sharp teeth. He dropped the ball at Sansa\u2019s feet and then he shuddered his wet fur dry. \u201cLead me to the castle, princess.\u201d</p><p>Sansa bent down and grabbed the ball while she thought about everything that had just happened. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but don\u2019t you think that the price you\u2019ve asked from me is a little much for the amount of work you have done? What did it take? Five seconds? Ten seconds? I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth all you\u2019ve asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promised me, princess.\u201d The wolf growled, but Sansa wasn\u2019t intimidated, not anymore. \u201cYou promised to let me have dinner with you. You promised to talk to me all evening. You promised me I could sleep at your feet tonight.\u201d</p><p>Sansa crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cYes, but like I said, I don\u2019t think the simple task you\u2019ve completed is worth all that.\u201d She shrugged once more. \u201cAnd like I said, it\u2019s not like Robb will let you into Winterfell in the first place.\u201d</p><p>But it seemed that Sansa was wrong about her brother, because when half an hour later Sansa appeared on the doorstep of Winterfell with the bright white wolf next to her, Robb Stark demanded both her and the wolf to tell him everything that had happened.</p><p>And so the wolf explained how the golden ball had fallen into the pond, how he had offered to get it for her, how he had wanted a few small things in return and how she had promised to give him all that, only to break her promise as soon as she realized that getting her ball back only took him a few seconds.</p><p>\u201cSansa?\u201d Robb\u2019s eyes stared straight into hers and she felt a shiver rolling down her spine. \u201cIs that true? Did you promise this wolf to have dinner with him? To spend the evening talking with him? To let him sleep at your feet tonight if he would retrieve that ball for you?\u201d</p><p>Sansa bent her head and stared at her feet. \u201cRobb, it only took him seconds!\u201d </p><p>\u201cDid you promise him?\u201d Robb raised his voice and Sansa let out a deep sigh.</p><p>\u201cYes, Robb, I promised him.\u201d She dropped her shoulders and she twirled a strand of her long red hair around her finger. \u201cBut really, it only took him seconds!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Stark never breaks a promise.\u201d Robb opened the door a little wider. \u201cThe wolf is welcome to have dinner with us tonight. And you will spend the entire night talking with him and you will allow him to sleep at your feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobb!\u201d Sansa threw her head in her neck. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not the one doing anything to you, Sansa. You were the one promising the wolf all of this and you shall give him what you have promised.\u201d</p><p>And with that the discussion had ended. Robb let the wolf into Winterfell and Sansa hated this day more than she had already done before she was forced to spend the rest of her birthday talking to a wolf.</p><p>But much to her surprise it wasn\u2019t as bad as she had thought it would be. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be into fairytales that much, princess.\u201d The wolf let his glance wander over all the books on the shelves in the library. \u201cYou don\u2019t really seem like the damsel in distress kinda girl.\u201d </p><p>Sansa rolled her eyes, but she couldn\u2019t help but smiling a little. \u201cI\u2019m not. I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApart from that time your ball fell into the pond.\u201d The wolf chuckled and Sansa fell down in one of the comfortable chairs.</p><p>\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t been there, I would\u2019ve found another way to get that ball back.\u201d</p><p>The wolf sat down next to her. \u201cOf course. That\u2019s why you agreed to all those things you clearly didn\u2019t wanna do.\u201d The wolf chuckled once more and Sansa decided that it was better to keep her mouth shut than to try to argue with him.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you love them so much?\u201d After a few long minutes of silence the wolf spoke again.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sansa looked up, letting go of the thoughts that had gone through her head. </p><p>\u201cFairytales. Why do love them so much?\u201d The wolf walked a little closer towards her and without really thinking about it, Sansa buried her hand in his fur. </p><p>\u201cFairytales are a promise.\u201d Sansa leaned back in her chair and her eyes drifted off. \u201cThey\u2019re a promise that no matter how bad things are, things will get better eventually.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cCinderella was treated like a slave for years, but eventually a fairy godmother appeared and she got everything she wanted and even more.\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe got a prince to save her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Sansa shook her head firmly. \u201cCinderella never asked for a prince. She asked for a ball, for one night of pleasure, to enjoy herself, to be away from her life.\u201d</p><p>The wolf kept silent for a moment. \u201cIs that why you asked for a ball? To get away from life?\u201d</p><p>Sansa bent her head and she folded her sweaty hands. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say that my life is bad or a hell or anything like that.\u201d Sansa fought the tears in her eyes. \u201cBut ever since dad died\u2026\u201d She felt a tear escaping and rolling down her cheek. \u201cMom doesn\u2019t care about anything anymore. She locks herself up in her room. She barely eats, she barely speaks, she barely says something.\u201d She paused for a moment. \u201cAnd Robb\u2026\u201d She swallowed while another tear escaped and rolled down her cheek. \u201cRobb is afraid that whoever killed dad will come after us too. He refuses to let me go anywhere outside these walls. And he refuses to let anyone else in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds kinda lonely\u2026\u201d The wolf moved a little closer towards Sansa, warming her legs and letting her pull his fur as much as she wanted and needed. </p><p>\u201cIf only fairy godmothers did exist\u2026\u201d Sansa wrapped her arms around the wolf. \u201cMaybe she could change things for me too.\u201d</p><p>The wolf let her cry. He didn\u2019t protest when she buried her face in his fur to dry her tears. He didn\u2019t protest when she tightened her grip. He didn\u2019t protest when she said nothing at all for hours, even though she had promised him an evening of conversation and talking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d Sansa eventually calmed down again and when she stared at the clock she saw that it was already almost midnight. \u201cI know I\u2019ve promised to talk to you and here I am, crying like a stupid damsel in distress.\u201d</p><p>The wolf licked her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re not a damsel in distress, Sansa. You\u2019re human. And no human really likes being alone.\u201d</p><p>Sansa nodded and after a few more minutes she stood up from her seat. \u201cI think we should go to bed now.\u201d She walked through the hallway, climbed a few stairs and eventually she opened the door to her room. \u201cGive me a few seconds, okay?\u201d She disappeared behind the folding screen and changed into her bright white night gown. With quick movements she braided her hair and eventually she pulled back the blankets and slipped under it. </p><p>Less than a second later the wolf jumped on the bed and laid down at her feet. His warmth was pleasantly comfortable and Sansa pushed herself up a little to watch the beautiful bright white wolf at her feet once more before she would blew out the candle next to her bed. </p><p>\u201cSleep well, princess Sansa.\u201d The wolf muttered and without thinking about it Sansa leaned towards him and pressed a soft kiss on his head.</p><p>\u201cSleep we\u2026\u201d She couldn\u2019t finish her sentence. A blinding flash of light brightened her entire room and Sansa closed her eyes and covered them with her hands. \u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d When she opened her eyes again she saw that the wolf at her feet was no longer a wolf. </p><p>At her feet, where the wolf had laid, was now a naked, but handsome man. His dark curls hid one of his beautiful brown eyes, wandering over his own body as if he couldn\u2019t believe what he saw. He stared at his hands and fingers, at his feet and toes, at his bare chest, at his muscled shoulders. </p><p>Deep down Sansa knew that she should scream for help, that she should be afraid and call out for her brother. But she didn\u2019t do so. She didn\u2019t scream. She wasn\u2019t afraid and she didn\u2019t call out for her brother.</p><p>\u201cIt worked\u2026\u201d The handsome young man shook his head over and over and kept counting his fingers and toes. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it worked.\u201d He repeated that same sentence again and again and again and eventually he looked up, as if he only realized then that he was in Sansa\u2019s bedroom, at her feet, naked. \u201cThank you, princess.\u201d He stared at her and quickly he reached for the blankets to cover his nudeness. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I can ever thank you.\u201d</p><p>Sansa cocked her head and let her glance wander over the young man. She thought about how he had listened, how he had understood, how he had not laughed at her, how he had not told her that she was stupid, how he had let her dry her tears, how he had endured her holding him too tight, gripping him too firmly. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cJon, Jon Snow.\u201d Jon smiled and Sansa smiled back at him.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Jon.\u201d Sansa moved a little closer towards him. \u201cMaybe fairy godmothers do exist.\u201d She pressed the palm of her hand to his stubbled cheek. \u201cAnd maybe, I did get the best birthday present ever I didn\u2019t ask for.\u201c</p></p>",

When she complains about this worthless present she meets a bright white wolf and it\u2019s bright white wolf who gets her her ball back when it falls into the pond. But his help comes at a price and Sansa is not sure if she\u2019s willing to pay it. </small></p><p><small>But maybe, just maybe, there is a fairy godmother out there giving her the best birthday present ever she didn\u2019t ask for.\u00a0</small></p><p><i><small>A frog prince AU</small></i></p></blockquote><p>\u201cSeriously\u2026\u201d Sansa let out a deep sigh while she fell down in the grass next to the pond. \u201cIt\u2019s my eighteenth birthday. And what do I get? A ball. A stupid golden ball to play with.\u201d She threw the ball up and caught it again. \u201cWhy does my older brother think I asked for a golden ball? When an almost eighteen year old girl asks for a ball she doesn\u2019t mean a stupid golden ball to play with!\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cI meant the other kind of ball, the ball where you meet people and where people play different sort of games\u2026\u201d She softened her voice. \u201cWhere there are actual people to play with.\u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d wanna play with you.\u201d A bright white wolf all of a sudden jumped in front of Sansa and a high pitched shriek escaped her lips. </p><p>She had no idea how he had gotten over the high walls surrounding the caste of Winterfell. Quickly she pushed herself up and she stepped back, her hands in front of her. \u201cDon\u2019t come near me, please.\u201d She swallowed and looked around to see if there was maybe someone near who could help her. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d wanna play with you.\u201d The wolf had a rough, but tender voice and he cocked his head. \u201cYou sound kinda lonely.\u201d The wolf just stood there while Sansa raised her eyebrows and stared at the golden ball in her hand. </p><p>\u201cI turned eighteen. Not twelve!\u201d She raised her voice. \u201cI\u2019m not going to throw that ball away so you can steal it and bring it to your boss.\u201d She paused for a short moment and stared straight into the wolf\u2019s eyes. \u201cJust because I\u2019m a woman, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought you were.\u201d The wolf laid down and made himself comfortable. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to throw that ball if you don\u2019t want to. I was just trying to be nice.\u201d He licked his paws. \u201cI just wanna help, that\u2019s all. But if you don\u2019t want my help, fine with me.\u201d </p>[[MORE]]<p>Sansa licked her dry lips and she shifted her weight from one leg to the other. After a few minutes, although it could have been hours too, she sat down next to the white wolf. In absolute silence she absentmindedly played with the golden ball Robb had given her. \u201cI wanted a ball. Not this kind of ball, but a dance.\u201d Sansa wasn\u2019t sure if she talked to the wolf or herself. \u201cI wanted people from all over the North to come over. I wanted a huge orchestra to play my favorite songs. I wanted to dance all night in the arms of handsome young men who would all want me as their wife.\u201d She threw the ball up and felt it slip through her fingers when she tried to catch it again. </p><p>The ball rolled away from her, out of reach, faster and faster straight towards the pond. With a loud splash it fell into the water.</p><p>Sansa tried to get to her feet as quickly as possible, but by the time her hand went into the dirty water to reach for her useless birthday present, the ball had already sunken to the bottom. </p><p>It was just a stupid ball. She didn\u2019t care about it. She didn\u2019t need it. She didn\u2019t want it. But she also didn\u2019t want to explain to her brother why she came home without it, that it had fallen into the pond, that she had already lost it. \u201cOf course, as if this day wasn\u2019t bad enough already.\u201d Sansa fell down on her knees. Her dress was covered in mud already, but she couldn\u2019t care less about it.</p><p>For months she had been looking forward to today. She had counted down. She had really firmly believed that her brother would throw her the ball she had asked for. She had hoped that her loneliness and isolation finally would be over.</p><p>\u201cI could get that ball for you.\u201d The wolf appeared next to her. \u201cI could dive in, get the ball and bring it back to you before anyone notices it\u2019s gone.\u201d </p><p>Sansa looked up at him and her eyes widened. \u201cYou would really want to do that for me?\u201d She curled her lips up into a smile. \u201cOw please, yes, that would at least not make this day any worse\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will get that ball from you, on a few conditions.\u201d The wolf spoke firmly and Sansa\u2019s smile disappeared as quickly as it had appeared. </p><p>\u201cI thought you were just trying to be nice? I thought you wanted to help me?\u201d Sansa shook her head in disbelief, but the wolf didn\u2019t flinch, didn\u2019t move, didn\u2019t soften.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want my help when I offered it.\u201d The wolf cocked his head and turned around. \u201cAnd therefore it now comes at a price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d Sansa stood up and almost screamed, but when the wolf started to walk away from her, she realized that if she would let him go, her ball would be lost and she would have to explain Robb where it was. \u201cFine\u2026\u201d </p><p>The wolf stood still and looked over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat are the conditions?\u201d Sansa crossed her arms over her chest and the wolf turned back around. </p><p>The wolf all of a sudden seemed a lot bigger and Sansa had to force herself to straighten her back and lift her chin. \u201cI want to have dinner with you tonight.\u201d The wolf stepped closer and Sansa raised her eyebrows. </p><p>\u201cDinner? With me? You\u2019re a wolf! Robb will never let you into the castle!\u201d</p><p>The wolf either didn\u2019t hear her or simply ignored her. \u201cI want to spend the evening talking with you and then, when the night falls, I want to fall asleep at your feet, in your bed.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\u2019s jaw dropped and she opened her mouth to say something before closing it again.</p><p>\u201cDo you want that golden ball or not?\u201d</p><p>Sansa was on the brink of telling him that he could have that stupid ball, that she didn\u2019t need it, but then she once again thought about Robb, about the fact that it was his birthday present, about the fact that it was pure gold. She had been careless with it and it seemed that she was going to pay the price for it anyway. </p><p>Would it really be that bad to have dinner with this wolf? Would it really be that bad to spend the night talking to him? Would it really be that bad to have him sleep at her feet for one night? It probably wouldn\u2019t be as bad as Robb\u2019s disappointment when he found that his sister had hated his present and had already lost it.</p><p>\u201cFine, I promise all of that.\u201d Sansa licked her dry lips and shrugged. \u201cGet that ball for me and you can have dinner with me, spend the evening talking with me and\u2026\u201d She hesitated for a moment. \u201cTonight you can sleep in my bed. At my feet.\u201d She made sure to emphasize the last part.</p><p>The wolf grinned at her and then he jumped into the water. Only a few seconds later he already emerged again with the golden ball between his sharp teeth. He dropped the ball at Sansa\u2019s feet and then he shuddered his wet fur dry. \u201cLead me to the castle, princess.\u201d</p><p>Sansa bent down and grabbed the ball while she thought about everything that had just happened. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but don\u2019t you think that the price you\u2019ve asked from me is a little much for the amount of work you have done? What did it take? Five seconds? Ten seconds? I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth all you\u2019ve asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promised me, princess.\u201d The wolf growled, but Sansa wasn\u2019t intimidated, not anymore. \u201cYou promised to let me have dinner with you. You promised to talk to me all evening. You promised me I could sleep at your feet tonight.\u201d</p><p>Sansa crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cYes, but like I said, I don\u2019t think the simple task you\u2019ve completed is worth all that.\u201d She shrugged once more. \u201cAnd like I said, it\u2019s not like Robb will let you into Winterfell in the first place.\u201d</p><p>But it seemed that Sansa was wrong about her brother, because when half an hour later Sansa appeared on the doorstep of Winterfell with the bright white wolf next to her, Robb Stark demanded both her and the wolf to tell him everything that had happened.</p><p>And so the wolf explained how the golden ball had fallen into the pond, how he had offered to get it for her, how he had wanted a few small things in return and how she had promised to give him all that, only to break her promise as soon as she realized that getting her ball back only took him a few seconds.</p><p>\u201cSansa?\u201d Robb\u2019s eyes stared straight into hers and she felt a shiver rolling down her spine. \u201cIs that true? Did you promise this wolf to have dinner with him? To spend the evening talking with him? To let him sleep at your feet tonight if he would retrieve that ball for you?\u201d</p><p>Sansa bent her head and stared at her feet. \u201cRobb, it only took him seconds!\u201d </p><p>\u201cDid you promise him?\u201d Robb raised his voice and Sansa let out a deep sigh.</p><p>\u201cYes, Robb, I promised him.\u201d She dropped her shoulders and she twirled a strand of her long red hair around her finger. \u201cBut really, it only took him seconds!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Stark never breaks a promise.\u201d Robb opened the door a little wider. \u201cThe wolf is welcome to have dinner with us tonight. And you will spend the entire night talking with him and you will allow him to sleep at your feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobb!\u201d Sansa threw her head in her neck. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not the one doing anything to you, Sansa. You were the one promising the wolf all of this and you shall give him what you have promised.\u201d</p><p>And with that the discussion had ended. Robb let the wolf into Winterfell and Sansa hated this day more than she had already done before she was forced to spend the rest of her birthday talking to a wolf.</p><p>But much to her surprise it wasn\u2019t as bad as she had thought it would be. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be into fairytales that much, princess.\u201d The wolf let his glance wander over all the books on the shelves in the library. \u201cYou don\u2019t really seem like the damsel in distress kinda girl.\u201d </p><p>Sansa rolled her eyes, but she couldn\u2019t help but smiling a little. \u201cI\u2019m not. I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApart from that time your ball fell into the pond.\u201d The wolf chuckled and Sansa fell down in one of the comfortable chairs.</p><p>\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t been there, I would\u2019ve found another way to get that ball back.\u201d</p><p>The wolf sat down next to her. \u201cOf course. That\u2019s why you agreed to all those things you clearly didn\u2019t wanna do.\u201d The wolf chuckled once more and Sansa decided that it was better to keep her mouth shut than to try to argue with him.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you love them so much?\u201d After a few long minutes of silence the wolf spoke again.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sansa looked up, letting go of the thoughts that had gone through her head. </p><p>\u201cFairytales. Why do love them so much?\u201d The wolf walked a little closer towards her and without really thinking about it, Sansa buried her hand in his fur. </p><p>\u201cFairytales are a promise.\u201d Sansa leaned back in her chair and her eyes drifted off. \u201cThey\u2019re a promise that no matter how bad things are, things will get better eventually.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cCinderella was treated like a slave for years, but eventually a fairy godmother appeared and she got everything she wanted and even more.\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe got a prince to save her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Sansa shook her head firmly. \u201cCinderella never asked for a prince. She asked for a ball, for one night of pleasure, to enjoy herself, to be away from her life.\u201d</p><p>The wolf kept silent for a moment. \u201cIs that why you asked for a ball? To get away from life?\u201d</p><p>Sansa bent her head and she folded her sweaty hands. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say that my life is bad or a hell or anything like that.\u201d Sansa fought the tears in her eyes. \u201cBut ever since dad died\u2026\u201d She felt a tear escaping and rolling down her cheek. \u201cMom doesn\u2019t care about anything anymore. She locks herself up in her room. She barely eats, she barely speaks, she barely says something.\u201d She paused for a moment. \u201cAnd Robb\u2026\u201d She swallowed while another tear escaped and rolled down her cheek. \u201cRobb is afraid that whoever killed dad will come after us too. He refuses to let me go anywhere outside these walls. And he refuses to let anyone else in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds kinda lonely\u2026\u201d The wolf moved a little closer towards Sansa, warming her legs and letting her pull his fur as much as she wanted and needed. </p><p>\u201cIf only fairy godmothers did exist\u2026\u201d Sansa wrapped her arms around the wolf. \u201cMaybe she could change things for me too.\u201d</p><p>The wolf let her cry. He didn\u2019t protest when she buried her face in his fur to dry her tears. He didn\u2019t protest when she tightened her grip. He didn\u2019t protest when she said nothing at all for hours, even though she had promised him an evening of conversation and talking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d Sansa eventually calmed down again and when she stared at the clock she saw that it was already almost midnight. \u201cI know I\u2019ve promised to talk to you and here I am, crying like a stupid damsel in distress.\u201d</p><p>The wolf licked her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re not a damsel in distress, Sansa. You\u2019re human. And no human really likes being alone.\u201d</p><p>Sansa nodded and after a few more minutes she stood up from her seat. \u201cI think we should go to bed now.\u201d She walked through the hallway, climbed a few stairs and eventually she opened the door to her room. \u201cGive me a few seconds, okay?\u201d She disappeared behind the folding screen and changed into her bright white night gown. With quick movements she braided her hair and eventually she pulled back the blankets and slipped under it. </p><p>Less than a second later the wolf jumped on the bed and laid down at her feet. His warmth was pleasantly comfortable and Sansa pushed herself up a little to watch the beautiful bright white wolf at her feet once more before she would blew out the candle next to her bed. </p><p>\u201cSleep well, princess Sansa.\u201d The wolf muttered and without thinking about it Sansa leaned towards him and pressed a soft kiss on his head.</p><p>\u201cSleep we\u2026\u201d She couldn\u2019t finish her sentence. A blinding flash of light brightened her entire room and Sansa closed her eyes and covered them with her hands. \u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d When she opened her eyes again she saw that the wolf at her feet was no longer a wolf. </p><p>At her feet, where the wolf had laid, was now a naked, but handsome man. His dark curls hid one of his beautiful brown eyes, wandering over his own body as if he couldn\u2019t believe what he saw. He stared at his hands and fingers, at his feet and toes, at his bare chest, at his muscled shoulders. </p><p>Deep down Sansa knew that she should scream for help, that she should be afraid and call out for her brother. But she didn\u2019t do so. She didn\u2019t scream. She wasn\u2019t afraid and she didn\u2019t call out for her brother.</p><p>\u201cIt worked\u2026\u201d The handsome young man shook his head over and over and kept counting his fingers and toes. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it worked.\u201d He repeated that same sentence again and again and again and eventually he looked up, as if he only realized then that he was in Sansa\u2019s bedroom, at her feet, naked. \u201cThank you, princess.\u201d He stared at her and quickly he reached for the blankets to cover his nudeness. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I can ever thank you.\u201d</p><p>Sansa cocked her head and let her glance wander over the young man. She thought about how he had listened, how he had understood, how he had not laughed at her, how he had not told her that she was stupid, how he had let her dry her tears, how he had endured her holding him too tight, gripping him too firmly. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cJon, Jon Snow.\u201d Jon smiled and Sansa smiled back at him.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Jon.\u201d Sansa moved a little closer towards him. \u201cMaybe fairy godmothers do exist.\u201d She pressed the palm of her hand to his stubbled cheek. \u201cAnd maybe, I did get the best birthday present ever I didn\u2019t ask for.\u201c</p></p>",

And what do I get? A ball. A stupid golden ball to play with.&rdquo; She threw the ball up and caught it again. &ldquo;Why does my older brother think I asked for a golden ball? When an almost eighteen year old girl asks for a ball she doesn&rsquo;t mean a stupid golden ball to play with!&rdquo; She rolled her eyes. &ldquo;I meant the other kind of ball, the ball where you meet people and where people play different sort of games&hellip;&rdquo; She softened her voice. &ldquo;Where there are actual people to play with.&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d wanna play with you.&rdquo; A bright white wolf all of a sudden jumped in front of Sansa and a high pitched shriek escaped her lips. </p><p>She had no idea how he had gotten over the high walls surrounding the caste of Winterfell. Quickly she pushed herself up and she stepped back, her hands in front of her. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come near me, please.&rdquo; She swallowed and looked around to see if there was maybe someone near who could help her. &ldquo;What do you want from me?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d wanna play with you.&rdquo; The wolf had a rough, but tender voice and he cocked his head. &ldquo;You sound kinda lonely.&rdquo; The wolf just stood there while Sansa raised her eyebrows and stared at the golden ball in her hand. </p><p>&ldquo;I turned eighteen. Not twelve!&rdquo; She raised her voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to throw that ball away so you can steal it and bring it to your boss.&rdquo; She paused for a short moment and stared straight into the wolf&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Just because I&rsquo;m a woman, doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m stupid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I never thought you were.&rdquo; The wolf laid down and made himself comfortable. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to throw that ball if you don&rsquo;t want to. I was just trying to be nice.&rdquo; He licked his paws. &ldquo;I just wanna help, that&rsquo;s all. But if you don&rsquo;t want my help, fine with me.&rdquo; </p><p>Sansa licked her dry lips and she shifted her weight from one leg to the other. After a few minutes, although it could have been hours too, she sat down next to the white wolf. In absolute silence she absentmindedly played with the golden ball Robb had given her. &ldquo;I wanted a ball. Not this kind of ball, but a dance.&rdquo; Sansa wasn&rsquo;t sure if she talked to the wolf or herself. &ldquo;I wanted people from all over the North to come over. I wanted a huge orchestra to play my favorite songs. I wanted to dance all night in the arms of handsome young men who would all want me as their wife.&rdquo; She threw the ball up and felt it slip through her fingers when she tried to catch it again. </p><p>The ball rolled away from her, out of reach, faster and faster straight towards the pond. With a loud splash it fell into the water.</p><p>Sansa tried to get to her feet as quickly as possible, but by the time her hand went into the dirty water to reach for her useless birthday present, the ball had already sunken to the bottom. </p><p>It was just a stupid ball. She didn&rsquo;t care about it. She didn&rsquo;t need it. She didn&rsquo;t want it. But she also didn&rsquo;t want to explain to her brother why she came home without it, that it had fallen into the pond, that she had already lost it. &ldquo;Of course, as if this day wasn&rsquo;t bad enough already.&rdquo; Sansa fell down on her knees. Her dress was covered in mud already, but she couldn&rsquo;t care less about it.</p><p>For months she had been looking forward to today. She had counted down. She had really firmly believed that her brother would throw her the ball she had asked for. She had hoped that her loneliness and isolation finally would be over.</p><p>&ldquo;I could get that ball for you.&rdquo; The wolf appeared next to her. &ldquo;I could dive in, get the ball and bring it back to you before anyone notices it&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo; </p><p>Sansa looked up at him and her eyes widened. &ldquo;You would really want to do that for me?&rdquo; She curled her lips up into a smile. &ldquo;Ow please, yes, that would at least not make this day any worse&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will get that ball from you, on a few conditions.&rdquo; The wolf spoke firmly and Sansa&rsquo;s smile disappeared as quickly as it had appeared. </p><p>&ldquo;I thought you were just trying to be nice? I thought you wanted to help me?&rdquo; Sansa shook her head in disbelief, but the wolf didn&rsquo;t flinch, didn&rsquo;t move, didn&rsquo;t soften.</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t want my help when I offered it.&rdquo; The wolf cocked his head and turned around. &ldquo;And therefore it now comes at a price.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s ridiculous!&rdquo; Sansa stood up and almost screamed, but when the wolf started to walk away from her, she realized that if she would let him go, her ball would be lost and she would have to explain Robb where it was. &ldquo;Fine&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>The wolf stood still and looked over his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;What are the conditions?&rdquo; Sansa crossed her arms over her chest and the wolf turned back around. </p><p>The wolf all of a sudden seemed a lot bigger and Sansa had to force herself to straighten her back and lift her chin. &ldquo;I want to have dinner with you tonight.&rdquo; The wolf stepped closer and Sansa raised her eyebrows. </p><p>&ldquo;Dinner? With me? You&rsquo;re a wolf! Robb will never let you into the castle!&rdquo;</p><p>The wolf either didn&rsquo;t hear her or simply ignored her. &ldquo;I want to spend the evening talking with you and then, when the night falls, I want to fall asleep at your feet, in your bed.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa&rsquo;s jaw dropped and she opened her mouth to say something before closing it again.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want that golden ball or not?&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa was on the brink of telling him that he could have that stupid ball, that she didn&rsquo;t need it, but then she once again thought about Robb, about the fact that it was his birthday present, about the fact that it was pure gold. She had been careless with it and it seemed that she was going to pay the price for it anyway. </p><p>Would it really be that bad to have dinner with this wolf? Would it really be that bad to spend the night talking to him? Would it really be that bad to have him sleep at her feet for one night? It probably wouldn&rsquo;t be as bad as Robb&rsquo;s disappointment when he found that his sister had hated his present and had already lost it.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine, I promise all of that.&rdquo; Sansa licked her dry lips and shrugged. &ldquo;Get that ball for me and you can have dinner with me, spend the evening talking with me and&hellip;&rdquo; She hesitated for a moment. &ldquo;Tonight you can sleep in my bed. At my feet.&rdquo; She made sure to emphasize the last part.</p><p>The wolf grinned at her and then he jumped into the water. Only a few seconds later he already emerged again with the golden ball between his sharp teeth. He dropped the ball at Sansa&rsquo;s feet and then he shuddered his wet fur dry. &ldquo;Lead me to the castle, princess.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa bent down and grabbed the ball while she thought about everything that had just happened. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but don&rsquo;t you think that the price you&rsquo;ve asked from me is a little much for the amount of work you have done? What did it take? Five seconds? Ten seconds? I really don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s worth all you&rsquo;ve asked.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You promised me, princess.&rdquo; The wolf growled, but Sansa wasn&rsquo;t intimidated, not anymore. &ldquo;You promised to let me have dinner with you. You promised to talk to me all evening. You promised me I could sleep at your feet tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa crossed her arms over her chest. &ldquo;Yes, but like I said, I don&rsquo;t think the simple task you&rsquo;ve completed is worth all that.&rdquo; She shrugged once more. &ldquo;And like I said, it&rsquo;s not like Robb will let you into Winterfell in the first place.&rdquo;</p><p>But it seemed that Sansa was wrong about her brother, because when half an hour later Sansa appeared on the doorstep of Winterfell with the bright white wolf next to her, Robb Stark demanded both her and the wolf to tell him everything that had happened.</p><p>And so the wolf explained how the golden ball had fallen into the pond, how he had offered to get it for her, how he had wanted a few small things in return and how she had promised to give him all that, only to break her promise as soon as she realized that getting her ball back only took him a few seconds.</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa?&rdquo; Robb&rsquo;s eyes stared straight into hers and she felt a shiver rolling down her spine. &ldquo;Is that true?

To let him sleep at your feet tonight if he would retrieve that ball for you?&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa bent her head and stared at her feet. &ldquo;Robb, it only took him seconds!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Did you promise him?&rdquo; Robb raised his voice and Sansa let out a deep sigh.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Robb, I promised him.&rdquo; She dropped her shoulders and she twirled a strand of her long red hair around her finger. &ldquo;But really, it only took him seconds!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A Stark never breaks a promise.&rdquo; Robb opened the door a little wider. &ldquo;The wolf is welcome to have dinner with us tonight. And you will spend the entire night talking with him and you will allow him to sleep at your feet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Robb!&rdquo; Sansa threw her head in her neck. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do this to me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am not the one doing anything to you, Sansa. You were the one promising the wolf all of this and you shall give him what you have promised.&rdquo;</p><p>And with that the discussion had ended. Robb let the wolf into Winterfell and Sansa hated this day more than she had already done before she was forced to spend the rest of her birthday talking to a wolf.</p><p>But much to her surprise it wasn&rsquo;t as bad as she had thought it would be. </p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d be into fairytales that much, princess.&rdquo; The wolf let his glance wander over all the books on the shelves in the library. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t really seem like the damsel in distress kinda girl.&rdquo; </p><p>Sansa rolled her eyes, but she couldn&rsquo;t help but smiling a little. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not. I can take care of myself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Apart from that time your ball fell into the pond.&rdquo; The wolf chuckled and Sansa fell down in one of the comfortable chairs.</p><p>&ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t been there, I would&rsquo;ve found another way to get that ball back.&rdquo;</p><p>The wolf sat down next to her. &ldquo;Of course. That&rsquo;s why you agreed to all those things you clearly didn&rsquo;t wanna do.&rdquo; The wolf chuckled once more and Sansa decided that it was better to keep her mouth shut than to try to argue with him.</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you love them so much?&rdquo; After a few long minutes of silence the wolf spoke again.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Sansa looked up, letting go of the thoughts that had gone through her head. </p><p>&ldquo;Fairytales. Why do love them so much?&rdquo; The wolf walked a little closer towards her and without really thinking about it, Sansa buried her hand in his fur. </p><p>&ldquo;Fairytales are a promise.&rdquo; Sansa leaned back in her chair and her eyes drifted off. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re a promise that no matter how bad things are, things will get better eventually.&rdquo; She took a deep breath. &ldquo;Cinderella was treated like a slave for years, but eventually a fairy godmother appeared and she got everything she wanted and even more.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;She got a prince to save her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Sansa shook her head firmly. &ldquo;Cinderella never asked for a prince. She asked for a ball, for one night of pleasure, to enjoy herself, to be away from her life.&rdquo;</p><p>The wolf kept silent for a moment. &ldquo;Is that why you asked for a ball? To get away from life?&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa bent her head and she folded her sweaty hands. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to say that my life is bad or a hell or anything like that.&rdquo; Sansa fought the tears in her eyes. &ldquo;But ever since dad died&hellip;&rdquo; She felt a tear escaping and rolling down her cheek. &ldquo;Mom doesn&rsquo;t care about anything anymore. She locks herself up in her room. She barely eats, she barely speaks, she barely says something.&rdquo; She paused for a moment. &ldquo;And Robb&hellip;&rdquo; She swallowed while another tear escaped and rolled down her cheek. &ldquo;Robb is afraid that whoever killed dad will come after us too. He refuses to let me go anywhere outside these walls. And he refuses to let anyone else in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That sounds kinda lonely&hellip;&rdquo; The wolf moved a little closer towards Sansa, warming her legs and letting her pull his fur as much as she wanted and needed. </p><p>&ldquo;If only fairy godmothers did exist&hellip;&rdquo; Sansa wrapped her arms around the wolf. &ldquo;Maybe she could change things for me too.&rdquo;</p><p>The wolf let her cry. He didn&rsquo;t protest when she buried her face in his fur to dry her tears. He didn&rsquo;t protest when she tightened her grip. He didn&rsquo;t protest when she said nothing at all for hours, even though she had promised him an evening of conversation and talking.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;&rdquo; Sansa eventually calmed down again and when she stared at the clock she saw that it was already almost midnight. &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;ve promised to talk to you and here I am, crying like a stupid damsel in distress.&rdquo;</p><p>The wolf licked her hand. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a damsel in distress, Sansa. You&rsquo;re human. And no human really likes being alone.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa nodded and after a few more minutes she stood up from her seat. &ldquo;I think we should go to bed now.&rdquo; She walked through the hallway, climbed a few stairs and eventually she opened the door to her room. &ldquo;Give me a few seconds, okay?&rdquo; She disappeared behind the folding screen and changed into her bright white night gown.

His dark curls hid one of his beautiful brown eyes, wandering over his own body as if he couldn&rsquo;t believe what he saw. He stared at his hands and fingers, at his feet and toes, at his bare chest, at his muscled shoulders. </p><p>Deep down Sansa knew that she should scream for help, that she should be afraid and call out for her brother. But she didn&rsquo;t do so. She didn&rsquo;t scream. She wasn&rsquo;t afraid and she didn&rsquo;t call out for her brother.</p><p>&ldquo;It worked&hellip;&rdquo; The handsome young man shook his head over and over and kept counting his fingers and toes. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it worked.&rdquo; He repeated that same sentence again and again and again and eventually he looked up, as if he only realized then that he was in Sansa&rsquo;s bedroom, at her feet, naked. &ldquo;Thank you, princess.&rdquo; He stared at her and quickly he reached for the blankets to cover his nudeness. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how I can ever thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa cocked her head and let her glance wander over the young man. She thought about how he had listened, how he had understood, how he had not laughed at her, how he had not told her that she was stupid, how he had let her dry her tears, how he had endured her holding him too tight, gripping him too firmly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Jon, Jon Snow.&rdquo; Jon smiled and Sansa smiled back at him.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, Jon.&rdquo; Sansa moved a little closer towards him. &ldquo;Maybe fairy godmothers do exist.&rdquo; She pressed the palm of her hand to his stubbled cheek. &ldquo;And maybe, I did get the best birthday present ever I didn&rsquo;t ask for.&ldquo;</p></p>",

When an almost eighteen year old girl asks for a ball she doesn&rsquo;t mean a stupid golden ball to play with!&rdquo; She rolled her eyes. &ldquo;I meant the other kind of ball, the ball where you meet people and where people play different sort of games&hellip;&rdquo; She softened her voice. &ldquo;Where there are actual people to play with.&ldquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d wanna play with you.&rdquo; A bright white wolf all of a sudden jumped in front of Sansa and a high pitched shriek escaped her lips. </p>\n<p>She had no idea how he had gotten over the high walls surrounding the caste of Winterfell. Quickly she pushed herself up and she stepped back, her hands in front of her. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come near me, please.&rdquo; She swallowed and looked around to see if there was maybe someone near who could help her. &ldquo;What do you want from me?&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d wanna play with you.&rdquo; The wolf had a rough, but tender voice and he cocked his head. &ldquo;You sound kinda lonely.&rdquo; The wolf just stood there while Sansa raised her eyebrows and stared at the golden ball in her hand. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;I turned eighteen. Not twelve!&rdquo; She raised her voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to throw that ball away so you can steal it and bring it to your boss.&rdquo; She paused for a short moment and stared straight into the wolf&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Just because I&rsquo;m a woman, doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m stupid.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I never thought you were.&rdquo; The wolf laid down and made himself comfortable. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to throw that ball if you don&rsquo;t want to. I was just trying to be nice.&rdquo; He licked his paws. &ldquo;I just wanna help, that&rsquo;s all. But if you don&rsquo;t want my help, fine with me.&rdquo; </p>\n</p>",

The way he had rescued her from ser illyn and the hound, why, it was almost like the songs, like the time serwyn of mirror shield saved the princess daeryssa from the giants, or <b>prince aemon the dragonknight championing queen naerys\u2019s honor against evil ser morgil\u2019s slanders .\u201d</b></i></p></blockquote><p>\u00a0l find\u00a0 quite interesting and intriguing\u00a0 the fact that sansa used to\u00a0 love\u00a0 songs about aemon and naerys targaryen two brothers\u00a0 who were in love with each other(l must admit it the girl had good taste!! jon and sansa are the new version of aemon and naerys!! f\u0153tus sansa would be jonsa trash l know it) her liking those type of songs makes me believe that she is ok with incest at leat she is not against it.</p><p>\u00a0That scene was like a story straight out of foetus sansa\u2019s favorite songs or mind ( the dragoncommander heir to the throne almost beating to death the man that wronged his beloved sister)</p><p>GOT is full of ironic stories but the most\u00a0 beautifully ironic story in got is jonsa\u2019 story, I mean\u2026 isn\u2019t it beautifully ironic that sansa\u2019s least favorite brother the man she thought couldn\u2019t protect her is in fact the only person that would die and kill for her( the man threatens to kill with his bare hands the men that have the audacity to mention his sister name) and he is also the perfect incarnation of aemon the dragonknight!! Sansa who doesn\u2019t believe in farytaile anymore has found her dragon prince but she doesn\u2019t know it yet !!</p>",

A suitable reminder that he was not on equal footing with her trueborn son. </p><p>On their ten and two name day though, Robb had decided that all the children should throw a tourney. And in the span of two hours the practice yard turned into a grand tourney ground, with blankets and sheets and chairs snuck from the castle gracing it\u2019s stands. Usually this kind of thing would never pass but seeing how keen Robb was on proving himself a man grown, she decided to make an exception just this once.</p><p>There she sat watching with a smile on her face as the boys sparred, Ned by her side holding her hand. His back straight and his chin held high as any proud father would be. Soon the girls began to gather around the yard to attend <i>the tourney</i>, and a soft laugh made its way out of her when she saw how they were throwing their favors at her boy. </p><p>Robb won once. Twice. Thrice. All against Jon Snow.</p><p>What a lovely day it was!</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until Arya ran into the ring, shrieking with delight and waving her practice sword like a true terror that her smile died down. Cat let go of Ned\u2019s hand, running towards her pup before she got hurt. </p><p>\u2018Arya Stark\u2019 In an instant she was upon her \u2018what do you think you\u2019re doing?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m having fun with them\u2019 she looked at her with all the innocence of a seven year old \u2018I have a sword and I\u2019ll go get a shield too!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hand me the sword now Arya!\u2019 She held out her hand at her little girl, but her daughter only hugged it close like a doll.</p><p>Sighing, Cat crouched in front of her, careful not to get her dress too dirty \u2018look around you Arya, everyone is quiet\u2019 she bade her to understand \u2018the fun had to stop because no one wants you to get hurt, you are a young lady my love, a precious thing that should be kept unharmed. Now give me the sword and sit with your sister.\u2019</p><p>Arya\u2019s lower lip trembled as watched the way everyone stood still and stared at them, with a dejected nod she waddled out of the practice yard and into her place at the stands, Arya never gave Cat the sword. But if hugging her toy would calm her down then she\u2019ll let her have it. </p><p><i>She\u2019ll understand when she\u2019s older why I did this, she\u2019ll know it was for her own good</i></p><p>Cat made her way back to a weary looking Ned, painfully aware of the way Arya seemed to fold in on herself. At least now she was next to her sister, and hopefully Sansa will find a way to lift her mood like she always did with Lysa. The girls around her were already laughing after all.</p><p>When she looked back at that day Cat couldn\u2019t imagine how she had missed the fire that burned in the bastard\u2019s eyes at that moment.</p><p>The tourney started again and Robb won, but so did Jon Snow. So much so in fact that he somehow made up for his loss all the way to the final match, again between him and her boy.</p><p>It did not take <i>him </i>five minutes to knock her husband\u2019s heir to the ground.</p><p><i>The bastard faked his loss before</i>. She realized as her blood froze in her veins.</p><p>She watched as <i>he </i>held out his hand to <i>Robb</i>, helping him up. </p><p>She watched him as he marched to little Bran, gently plucking the crown of winter roses from his hands.</p><p>She watched him as he marched to Sansa, bypassing all the girls that threw their handkerchiefs at him.</p><p>She watched as he ignored her eldest, and placed the crown of frosted flowers on her youngest\u2019s head. She watched as her girl jumped at him over stands, his arms catching her and twirling her around with ease as Arya giggled like a maid in love. Something about the scene suddenly made her uncomfortable.</p><p>In her hand, Ned\u2019s own trembled. Cat turned to face him and was shocked to see what she found, his face looked tired and miserable and scared. Not even in his own subtle way, but it was clear to see for all.</p><p>Cat looked back at the scene, and then back at Ned. Her head going back and forth as if she was watching a snow fight. Something in her mind clicking but not quite clicking. </p><p><i>The Tourney, the sword in Arya\u2019s hand, the fire, Sansa\u2019s disappointment, the crown of winter roses.</i></p><p>Oh no.</p><p>Her stomach fell as she realized that she was absolutely going to <i>murder</i> whoever put this thing together. Of course Ned would be like that, his own sister was taken by prince Rhaegar right after he crowned her like that and then&hellip;</p><p>And then&hellip;</p><p>He had to go save her.</p><p>He came back with the boy.</p><p><i>The Tourney, the sword in Arya\u2019s hand, the fire, Sansa\u2019s disappointment, the crown of winter roses.</i></p><p>And then&hellip;</p><p>Did he? Then it would make sense that he wouldn\u2019t tell her.
