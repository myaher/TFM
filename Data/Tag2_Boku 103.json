        "body": "<p><b>Previously on BnHA:</b>\nEndeavor fucking died you guys. Obviously he\u2019s not <i>really</i> dead (&hellip;I think), but like. He lost an eye and is all laid\nout on a slab of building looking in pretty bad shape. This is bad for a number\nof reasons. One, he is the current number one hero (and holds that position\nsolely because of his strength, I might add), so the fact that he up and died\nfighting against this High Heels Noumu doesn\u2019t exactly bode well for the rest\nof the world. Two, he was just starting to be redeemed, dammit. Although this\nmight still work out for him in the long run in that regard. And three, his\nkids were all watching, and as conflicted as their feelings toward their father\nmight be, this still isn\u2019t the kind of thing any of them ever wanted to\nwitness. With that said, it feels a bit sudden for the world to just suddenly descend into chaos, so maybe the dude will somehow make a comeback. And Hawks is still there, of course,\u00a0so I guess we\u2019ll just see what happens, huh.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> The world watches as Kamino 2.0 plays out before their eyes. High Top Noumu is all\u00a0\u201cIS THIS YOUR KING?\u201d but then Endeavor fucking leaps at him and shuts him up. Natsuo is all\u00a0\u201cwhat the fuck he should be dead\u201d but Fuyu says that Endeavor has always been ridiculously stubborn about giving up. Aizawa comes running into the Heights Alliance dorms to find Shouto already watching the battle along with the other 1-A students. Hawks and the other pros evacuate the terrified crowd as the newscasters all but revel in the panic. That is, until Endeavor\u2019s young fan from earlier calls them out and points out that Endeavor is still alive and still fighting for them. Which is true, despite the fact that he can barely move. But as All for One once said, wounded heroes are the most dangerous, and as Endeavor powers up his flames once again, Hawks steps in to lend an assist, boosting Endeavor\u2019s speed with the help of some of his feathers as the Number One gets ready to turn the High Wire Noumu to ash.</p><p><br/></p><p>(As always, all comments not marked with an ETA are my unspoiled reactions from my first readthrough of this chapter.

He lost an eye and is all laid\nout on a slab of building looking in pretty bad shape. This is bad for a number\nof reasons. One, he is the current number one hero (and holds that position\nsolely because of his strength, I might add), so the fact that he up and died\nfighting against this High Heels Noumu doesn\u2019t exactly bode well for the rest\nof the world. Two, he was just starting to be redeemed, dammit. Although this\nmight still work out for him in the long run in that regard. And three, his\nkids were all watching, and as conflicted as their feelings toward their father\nmight be, this still isn\u2019t the kind of thing any of them ever wanted to\nwitness. With that said, it feels a bit sudden for the world to just suddenly descend into chaos, so maybe the dude will somehow make a comeback. And Hawks is still there, of course,\u00a0so I guess we\u2019ll just see what happens, huh.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> The world watches as Kamino 2.0 plays out before their eyes. High Top Noumu is all\u00a0\u201cIS THIS YOUR KING?\u201d but then Endeavor fucking leaps at him and shuts him up. Natsuo is all\u00a0\u201cwhat the fuck he should be dead\u201d but Fuyu says that Endeavor has always been ridiculously stubborn about giving up. Aizawa comes running into the Heights Alliance dorms to find Shouto already watching the battle along with the other 1-A students. Hawks and the other pros evacuate the terrified crowd as the newscasters all but revel in the panic. That is, until Endeavor\u2019s young fan from earlier calls them out and points out that Endeavor is still alive and still fighting for them. Which is true, despite the fact that he can barely move. But as All for One once said, wounded heroes are the most dangerous, and as Endeavor powers up his flames once again, Hawks steps in to lend an assist, boosting Endeavor\u2019s speed with the help of some of his feathers as the Number One gets ready to turn the High Wire Noumu to ash.</p><p><br></p><p>(As always, all comments not marked with an ETA are my unspoiled reactions from my first readthrough of this chapter.

                "content": "<p><p><b>Previously on BnHA:</b>\nEndeavor fucking died you guys. Obviously he&rsquo;s not <i>really</i> dead (&hellip;I think), but like. He lost an eye and is all laid\nout on a slab of building looking in pretty bad shape. This is bad for a number\nof reasons. One, he is the current number one hero (and holds that position\nsolely because of his strength, I might add), so the fact that he up and died\nfighting against this High Heels Noumu doesn&rsquo;t exactly bode well for the rest\nof the world. Two, he was just starting to be redeemed, dammit. Although this\nmight still work out for him in the long run in that regard. And three, his\nkids were all watching, and as conflicted as their feelings toward their father\nmight be, this still isn&rsquo;t the kind of thing any of them ever wanted to\nwitness. With that said, it feels a bit sudden for the world to just suddenly descend into chaos, so maybe the dude will somehow make a comeback. And Hawks is still there, of course,&nbsp;so I guess we&rsquo;ll just see what happens, huh.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> The world watches as Kamino 2.0 plays out before their eyes. High Top Noumu is all&nbsp;&ldquo;IS THIS YOUR KING?&rdquo; but then Endeavor fucking leaps at him and shuts him up. Natsuo is all&nbsp;&ldquo;what the fuck he should be dead&rdquo; but Fuyu says that Endeavor has always been ridiculously stubborn about giving up. Aizawa comes running into the Heights Alliance dorms to find Shouto already watching the battle along with the other 1-A students. Hawks and the other pros evacuate the terrified crowd as the newscasters all but revel in the panic. That is, until Endeavor&rsquo;s young fan from earlier calls them out and points out that Endeavor is still alive and still fighting for them. Which is true, despite the fact that he can barely move.

He lost an eye and is all laid\nout on a slab of building looking in pretty bad shape. This is bad for a number\nof reasons. One, he is the current number one hero (and holds that position\nsolely because of his strength, I might add), so the fact that he up and died\nfighting against this High Heels Noumu doesn&rsquo;t exactly bode well for the rest\nof the world. Two, he was just starting to be redeemed, dammit. Although this\nmight still work out for him in the long run in that regard. And three, his\nkids were all watching, and as conflicted as their feelings toward their father\nmight be, this still isn&rsquo;t the kind of thing any of them ever wanted to\nwitness.

But I haven\u2019t seen anyone talk about their relationship from Shigaraki\u2019s point of view- and for good reason: Shigaraki\u2019s reply was cut short by the arrival of Gigantomachia, leaving us with no clue as to what he was actually gonna say in response.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"314\" data-orig-width=\"415\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9786d0ecc6305b123b2ee9c83a9bae73/tumblr_inline_poj9wwKHB81sz7ovh_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"314\" data-orig-width=\"415\"/></figure><p>But, what became more and more obvious the longer I actually looked at him, is that Shigaraki looks a little confused? As if he doesn\u2019t understand why Spinner\u2019s yelling at him. And- this will either be the biggest reach you\u2019ve ever heard or the pieces literally clicking into place- I think it\u2019s because of their opening attack on the Nazi Church.</p><!-- more --><p>I\u2019m just gonna recap here, but from the start of bnha, Shigaraki\u2019s been a pretty careful planner.

In short, Shigaraki is a careful planner (his failures are more down to his struggles to anticipate his enemies, rather than his plans being inherently bad) so why attack a fringe &ldquo;church&rdquo; Spinner describes as living fossils to get money?&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fb40be3c76f457c59c9d18a3a91ea2df/tumblr_inline_pojaglkS7B1sz7ovh_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><strike>Also, can we comment on the fact it&rsquo;s the villains fighting the literal nazis, not the heroes? Almost as if the hero system is corrupt or something</strike></p><p>Obviously, there&rsquo;s a whole lotta reasons to kill nazis, but money has never been the top of the list. And we know the League&rsquo;s main motivation for the attack is money, because it&rsquo;s reinforced through the entire chapter that they&rsquo;re very desperate for money.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3cf14f98edffda8ac75a8605da2d6a73/tumblr_inline_pojakqlNAY1sz7ovh_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2dbcc351793c382ffa21ce153cdcfe28/tumblr_inline_pojakr7VwK1sz7ovh_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2272cc0712f3e61392f9f11f1c527400/tumblr_inline_pojakrQNCh1sz7ovh_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Which lead me to wonder, what if Shigaraki chose a racist organisation for this specific attack because of Spinner&rsquo;s (lack of) loyalty?&nbsp;<br />We know from the mall escapade that Shigaraki struggles to understand Stain&rsquo;s ideals- he leaves with the understanding that their motivations are the same, but he still doesn&rsquo;t understand Stain&rsquo;s goals. Because he can&rsquo;t understand Stain and Spinner&rsquo;s goals, Shigaraki can&rsquo;t win them over the way he has the rest of the League. When you compare that against one of the most loyal League members, Toga, it&rsquo;s obvious why Shigaraki succeeded in gaining her loyalty. Both Toga and Shigaraki are motivated by selfish desires. Toga wants to make the world easier to live in:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/447b98a48e18b5e01ce7734e2f4352e6/tumblr_inline_pojatimpWM1sz7ovh_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>She wants to live freely, which, in her world, means she wants to be able to kill people without consequence. Shigaraki, in the same vein, wants revenge on the society that he believes betrayed him. In contrast, Stain and Spinner only want the destruction of &ldquo;fake&rdquo; heroism, heroism done for selfish gain, something which they believe would improve society. And Shigaraki, for all his improvements, still can&rsquo;t understand that because he sees all heroes, and hero society, irredeemable.&nbsp;</p><p>To appeal to Spinner, he attempts the same thing he&rsquo;s done to earn the loyalty of the other villains in the League: he targets the thing they personally dislike about society. For Toga, this meant letting her run free. He lets Compress be as theatrical as he wants, he gives Twice and Magne a place where they won&rsquo;t be discriminated against, and defends Magne against transphobia, to the point where he takes down a powerful potential ally. It&rsquo;s only logical he would do the same thing with Spinner, and deliberately target a group of racists that made Spinner suffer.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe6785acc7ff7e557abf1336a2b62d06/tumblr_inline_pojaxsTC6J1sz7ovh_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>But Spinner still questions Shigaraki, leading to Shigaraki&rsquo;s confusion. Because he appealed to Spinner the same way he did the rest of the League- in a way that would never work, because of Shigaraki&rsquo;s complete incapability to understand Spinner&rsquo;s motivation.&nbsp;</p><p>Alternatively, Shigaraki just wanted to punch Nazis. That&rsquo;s something we can all get behind. <br /></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>Chapter 220 inspired me to stretch out my rusty meta skills, so here I am, back again with more analysis than I&rsquo;ve done in 6 months.&nbsp;So far, I&rsquo;ve seen people discussing Spinner a lot, with emphasis on his relationship with the League and, more specifically, Shigaraki. But I haven&rsquo;t seen anyone talk about their relationship from Shigaraki&rsquo;s point of view- and for good reason: Shigaraki&rsquo;s reply was cut short by the arrival of Gigantomachia, leaving us with no clue as to what he was actually gonna say in response.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9786d0ecc6305b123b2ee9c83a9bae73/tumblr_inline_poj9wwKHB81sz7ovh_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>But, what became more and more obvious the longer I actually looked at him, is that Shigaraki looks a little confused? As if he doesn&rsquo;t understand why Spinner&rsquo;s yelling at him. And- this will either be the biggest reach you&rsquo;ve ever heard or the pieces literally clicking into place- I think it&rsquo;s because of their opening attack on the Nazi Church.</p>\n</p>",

It can also be another subtle way of humanizing Shigaraki (as eating is a &ldquo;shared bodily experience&rdquo; and he is the only villain so far to have eaten food)</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c9e3f0a0b7f5d459ac7f3bef6050c651/tumblr_pojb2quzad1uljn0q_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>I also wanna talk about how unresponsive Shigaraki was this chapter. I don&rsquo;t know if he had to do with his mental state from losing his comrade and mentor or if the listlessness of the League was getting to him. But for a moment, this Shigaraki almost looked to me like someone who could&rsquo;ve grown apart from AFO if he was arrested then and there</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/eb8aea64631c23d8ed1bd38454ac3963/tumblr_pojb2qecIb1uljn0q_400.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>And this goes into Shigaraki not even responding to Toga teasing him about his loneliness <strike>(not even a shipper, still kind of into the idea of slow-burn Shigatoga but I digress)</strike></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a81c731c6a9862269c61d5760dafdf14/tumblr_pojb2q07991uljn0q_500.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Heck, Shigaraki doesn&rsquo;t even really react when Spinner grabs him, pulls him by his clothes ad is literally yelling in his face. I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t get more unresponsive than that</p><p>But then, as soon as trouble stirs, he rushes in front of his team. And once he realizes he still has a piece to play with, he&rsquo;s back to his malicious self</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0adc9e89097e430f227fbec7b4d2e42f/tumblr_pojbfjX6I31uljn0q_500.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Quite interesting</p><p>Also: seeing so much Shigaraki&rsquo;s real face in one chapter actually disturbed/threw me off a bit, I&rsquo;m not gonna lie</p></p>",
