During ACOK, he also ruled Winterfell while his brother, King Robb, was away at war together with their mother.\u00a0 And while his sisters pick some interesting skills on their respective journeys never of them has any experience of ruling. Same can be said for Rickon, who is just a toddier (and alive, too!) on the book series.</p><p>Besides, as you mentioned, Winterfell is Bran\u2019s by Westeros inheritance right. He comes first in the line of succession, before his two sisters and his younger brother.

Aside from that I thought the second Tower of Joy flashback was pretty good, actually!</p><p>Back to the one I didn\u2019t like, though.</p><p>First, the fact that this flashback was in season six at all. It belonged in season one. The Tower of Joy flashback, in the books, is there to tell us about <i>Ned, </i>as much or more as it\u2019s meant to tell us about R+L=J. It tells us about Ned\u2019s love for his sister, his traumatic experiences in Robert\u2019s Rebellion, and shows us the massive emotional and psychological strain of keeping what\u2019s hinted to be a huge secret. What the readers can piece together about Ned\u2019s past in book one goes a <i>long</i>\u00a0way to explaining why he resigned the Handship mid-book and why he couldn\u2019t just tell Robert about Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen. The answer to those questions was not\u00a0\u201cbecause he\u2019s too honourable (and kinda stupid).\u201d</p><p>Second, making the swordfight the focus of the scene. We don\u2019t see the fight in the books because the details of the fight\u2026really don\u2019t matter, thematically. The drama in that scene is <i>Ned\u2019s dead friends</i>, rather than the action of Arthur Dayne mowing them down. It puts the spotlight on how <i>badass!</i>\u2122 Arthur Dayne is, rather than the tragedy of the setup.</p><p>The fight choreography wasn\u2019t even good enough to justify this decision. And by wasn\u2019t even good, I mean it was marginally better than the Sand Snake fight. Arthur Dayne dual wielding, fine. Arthur Dayne dual wielding fucking longswords hamstrung the choreography. You can <i>see</i>\u00a0the actors waiting their turn to die.</p><p>Thirdly, the twist ending of that swordfight. Bran\u2019s all excited, because <i>apparently</i>\u00a0Ned told Bran the story of how he defeated Ser Arthur Dayne a lot. Then, surprise! Ned did not defeat Ser Arthur Dayne in combat! Howland Reed <i>ever</i>\u00a0so unsportingly got up after being knocked down in full on melee combat and had the <i>temerity</i>\u00a0to defend himself and his friend rather than queue up nicely like the others to get cut down, and Ned reveals his own dishonour by finishing Ser Arthur off. Baffled as I am that Howland and Ned are apparently scumbags for taking advantage of Ser Arthur\u2019s lapse of combat awareness (this was not a goddamned duel and everyone knew it going in), the fact that Ned repeatedly told a false version of events to his children tells us that show!Ned\u2019s a lying braggart.</p><p>Show!Ned, by contrast, only ever told Bran that Arthur Dayne was the best knight he ever saw, and Arthur would have killed him if it weren\u2019t for Howland Reed. Basically the polar fucking opposite of the show\u2019s version of Ned\u2019s narrative. And why? Apparently to destroy the idea that Ned was honourable. Goodness knows why the writers thought <i>that</i>\u00a0was necessary, or even a higher priority than revealing to the audience the focal point of the trauma Ned suffered.</p>",

                "content": "<p>It&rsquo;s the first Tower of Joy flashback that&rsquo;s the main offender, here. The flashback to Ned as a kid didn&rsquo;t really <i>do</i>&nbsp;anything, while the second Tower of Joy flashback was only a bit unclear. Aside from that I thought the second Tower of Joy flashback was pretty good, actually!</p><p>Back to the one I didn&rsquo;t like, though.</p><p>First, the fact that this flashback was in season six at all. It belonged in season one. The Tower of Joy flashback, in the books, is there to tell us about <i>Ned, </i>as much or more as it&rsquo;s meant to tell us about R+L=J. It tells us about Ned&rsquo;s love for his sister, his traumatic experiences in Robert&rsquo;s Rebellion, and shows us the massive emotional and psychological strain of keeping what&rsquo;s hinted to be a huge secret. What the readers can piece together about Ned&rsquo;s past in book one goes a <i>long</i>&nbsp;way to explaining why he resigned the Handship mid-book and why he couldn&rsquo;t just tell Robert about Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen. The answer to those questions was not&nbsp;&ldquo;because he&rsquo;s too honourable (and kinda stupid).&rdquo;</p><p>Second, making the swordfight the focus of the scene. We don&rsquo;t see the fight in the books because the details of the fight&hellip;really don&rsquo;t matter, thematically. The drama in that scene is <i>Ned&rsquo;s dead friends</i>, rather than the action of Arthur Dayne mowing them down. It puts the spotlight on how <i>badass!</i>&trade; Arthur Dayne is, rather than the tragedy of the setup.</p><p>The fight choreography wasn&rsquo;t even good enough to justify this decision. And by wasn&rsquo;t even good, I mean it was marginally better than the Sand Snake fight. Arthur Dayne dual wielding, fine. Arthur Dayne dual wielding fucking longswords hamstrung the choreography. You can <i>see</i>&nbsp;the actors waiting their turn to die.</p><p>Thirdly, the twist ending of that swordfight. Bran&rsquo;s all excited, because <i>apparently</i>&nbsp;Ned told Bran the story of how he defeated Ser Arthur Dayne a lot. Then, surprise! Ned did not defeat Ser Arthur Dayne in combat! Howland Reed <i>ever</i>&nbsp;so unsportingly got up after being knocked down in full on melee combat and had the <i>temerity</i>&nbsp;to defend himself and his friend rather than queue up nicely like the others to get cut down, and Ned reveals his own dishonour by finishing Ser Arthur off. Baffled as I am that Howland and Ned are apparently scumbags for taking advantage of Ser Arthur&rsquo;s lapse of combat awareness (this was not a goddamned duel and everyone knew it going in), the fact that Ned repeatedly told a false version of events to his children tells us that show!Ned&rsquo;s a lying braggart.</p><p>Show!Ned, by contrast, only ever told Bran that Arthur Dayne was the best knight he ever saw, and Arthur would have killed him if it weren&rsquo;t for Howland Reed. Basically the polar fucking opposite of the show&rsquo;s version of Ned&rsquo;s narrative. And why? Apparently to destroy the idea that Ned was honourable. Goodness knows why the writers thought <i>that</i>&nbsp;was necessary, or even a higher priority than revealing to the audience the focal point of the trauma Ned suffered.</p>",
