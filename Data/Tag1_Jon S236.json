But Jon is determined to show that he&rsquo;s not like the men who scarred and hurt her at all.</small></p><p><i><small>post-canon // Canon Divergence, mentions of rape and implied smut</small></i></p></blockquote><p>It was a strange sight. It was a sight more painful than anything Jon had ever seen. It was a sight that didn\u2019t fit, didn\u2019t feel right, didn\u2019t seem right.</p><p>The beautiful young queen he had married sat on the edge of her bed with her dress still on and her arms nervously wrapped around her. She didn\u2019t look like a queen anymore. She didn\u2019t look like the fierce and proud woman she had become anymore. She looked like a young girl, afraid and terrified of what was to come. </p><p>\u201cSansa?\u201d He kneeled down in front of her. He was barely wearing anything anymore and he had untied his dark black curls. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d He already knew the answer, but he wanted to ask her anyway. He didn\u2019t want her to think that she looked broken and damaged, that she looked like a scarred girl, wounded in places no one got to see.</p><p>She tried to lift her chin and straighten her back, but she was trembling and shaking, her hands holding onto the white sheets covering the bed. \u201cI&rsquo;m fine.\u201d</p><p>Jon rolled his eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to lie to me, Sansa.\u201d He shook his head and reached for her hands. Her fingers were ice and ice cold and he tried to warm them between his palms. \u201cI hope you know that I always wanna hear the truth from you.\u201d</p><p>Sansa took a deep breath. The smile that had brightened her face all day faltered and disappeared. Her eyes stared at him, wide open and almost child like. It was easy to forget that she was still just a young girl, forced to live in a world that was harsh and didn\u2019t care about innocence and purity.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me.\u201d Jon whispered and he let one of his hands touch her face. The tips of his fingers caressed her cheek, slowly moving down until he let his palm rest in her neck. \u201cTalk to me, please.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>She pulled her hands back and turned her face away from him. Her glance moved to the window and the dark night surrounding the castle of Winterfell. \u201cI don\u2019t know how.\u201d She bent her head. She looked lost, lost in the memories that haunted her and scared her. \u201cI don\u2019t want to disappoint you.\u201d She bit her lip and Jon fought the urge to wrap his arms around her, to press her to his chest, to tell her stories about brave knights fighting fierce dragons, like Robb used to do when Sansa had been little and afraid of the dark. But stories wouldn\u2019t help her right now. Reality had caught up with the fairytales she had believed and reality had left scars on her heart and soul.</p><p>\u201cSansa\u2026\u201d Jon swallowed. If her demons had been humans he could kill with his swords, he would have fought for her. If her nightmares could be beaten in a hand to hand combat, he would have hit the beasts until his knuckles would bleed. But there were fights he couldn\u2019t fight for her, no matter how desperately he wanted to. \u201cYou&rsquo;ll never disappoint me. Just talk to me.\u201d He carefully reached for her chin and moved her face so their eyes could meet. \u201cWe can talk all night.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\u2019s entire body tensed and a salted tear rolled down her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u201d She could barely whisper, but Jon heard each and every word loud and clear anyway. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry he took what was yours and\u2026\u201d</p><p>Jon shook his head and his lips kissed the single tear away. \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry for me.\u201d He kissed her other cheek, the tip of her nose. \u201cTalk to me about you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Sansa turned her glance away from him again. \u201cThe right words don\u2019t exist.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cI want you to know that\u2026\u201d She looked back at him and some of her fierceness returned to her glance. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to just do it.\u201d </p><p>Jon furrowed his eyebrows and then he curled his arms around her head and pressed her to his chest. \u201cIt&rsquo;s not okay to just do it, Sansa.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThis marriage will be worthless if you don\u2019t. You need to do it.\u201d She moved her head up so her lips touched his neck. \u201cThe people need to know you\u2019re a true Stark now.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s hands went through her hair and he kept silent for a long moment. \u201cNo\u2026\u201d He wanted to speak firmly, but the word was stuck in his throat and came out less strong than he had intended. \u201cNothing is more important to me than you. If you\u2019re not ready for it, I\u2019ll wait. However long I have to. We can tell everyone it happened. But I won\u2019t just do it. Not when you\u2019re like this.\u201d</p><p>Sansa buried her face in his neck and after a while she relaxed a little in his arms. The tension in her shoulders eased. Her breathing steadied and she wrapped her arms around him like she had done so many times before. \u201cI&rsquo;ll never be ready for it.\u201d She pulled back and closed her eyes. \u201cAnd Winterfell does need an heir eventually.\u201d She sighed. \u201cSo I want you to just do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d This time Jon\u2019s voice was firm and certain. \u201cI won\u2019t just do it.\u201d He cupped her face between his strong hands and stared at her.</p><p>Despite the scars on her soul, despite her pride being gone, despite the pain and fear in her eyes, she was still beautiful. Even broken and hurt she was still beautiful. She would always be beautiful.</p><p>\u201cI will show you how it can be. Pleasant and nice, a whispered secret between two lovers.\u201d He moved closer towards her and his lips brushed hers. \u201cWe\u2019ll take it slowly. Step by step.\u201d</p><p>Sansa smiled a weak smile at him and she took a deep breath before she pulled her nightgown over her head. \u201cI trust you, Jon Snow.\u201d She shove backwards until she could lay her head down on her soft feathered pillow. \u201cI love you, Jon Snow.\u201d</p><p>He smiled back at her and crawled on the bed too. His lips searched for her neck. \u201cI love you more, Sansa Stark.\u201d He left a trace of soft kisses down her collarbone, her breast and her belly. </p><p>Sansa buried her hand in his hair. \u201cI love you most, Jon Snow.\u201d She spread her legs a little, but Jon was determined to stay true to his promise. </p><p>He wouldn\u2019t just do it. He would take his time, until even her scarred heart would dare to believe he would never ever hurt her. Until even her broken and damaged soul would dare to believe he loved her more than most.</p>",

Step by step.\u201d</p><p>Sansa smiled a weak smile at him and she took a deep breath before she pulled her nightgown over her head. \u201cI trust you, Jon Snow.\u201d She shove backwards until she could lay her head down on her soft feathered pillow. \u201cI love you, Jon Snow.\u201d</p><p>He smiled back at her and crawled on the bed too. His lips searched for her neck. \u201cI love you more, Sansa Stark.\u201d He left a trace of soft kisses down her collarbone, her breast and her belly. </p><p>Sansa buried her hand in his hair. \u201cI love you most, Jon Snow.\u201d She spread her legs a little, but Jon was determined to stay true to his promise. </p><p>He wouldn\u2019t just do it.

It was a sight more painful than anything Jon had ever seen. It was a sight that didn\u2019t fit, didn\u2019t feel right, didn\u2019t seem right.</p><p>The beautiful young queen he had married sat on the edge of her bed with her dress still on and her arms nervously wrapped around her. She didn\u2019t look like a queen anymore. She didn\u2019t look like the fierce and proud woman she had become anymore. She looked like a young girl, afraid and terrified of what was to come. </p><p>\u201cSansa?\u201d He kneeled down in front of her.

He didn\u2019t want her to think that she looked broken and damaged, that she looked like a scarred girl, wounded in places no one got to see.</p><p>She tried to lift her chin and straighten her back, but she was trembling and shaking, her hands holding onto the white sheets covering the bed. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Jon rolled his eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to lie to me, Sansa.\u201d He shook his head and reached for her hands.

The smile that had brightened her face all day faltered and disappeared. Her eyes stared at him, wide open and almost child like.

The tips of his fingers caressed her cheek, slowly moving down until he let his palm rest in her neck. \u201cTalk to me, please.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>She pulled her hands back and turned her face away from him. Her glance moved to the window and the dark night surrounding the castle of Winterfell. \u201cI don\u2019t know how.\u201d She bent her head. She looked lost, lost in the memories that haunted her and scared her. \u201cI don\u2019t want to disappoint you.\u201d She bit her lip and Jon fought the urge to wrap his arms around her, to press her to his chest, to tell her stories about brave knights fighting fierce dragons, like Robb used to do when Sansa had been little and afraid of the dark. But stories wouldn\u2019t help her right now. Reality had caught up with the fairytales she had believed and reality had left scars on her heart and soul.</p><p>\u201cSansa\u2026\u201d Jon swallowed.

        "body": "<p>A lot is missed in all of Jon\u2019s arcs in <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i>, due to him being a traditional lead hero, so many miss the nuance in his arc. He is definitely the character that appears to conform to typical fantasy tropes the most, but hidden within his Action Hero\u2122 exterior, GRRM worked extensively to subvert typical fantasy tropes. And while that doesn\u2019t pay off fully until <i>A Storm of Swords</i> and especially <i>A Dance With Dragons</i>, the foundation is laid for Jon\u2019s full arc to defy fantasy tropes in <i>A Game of Thrones</i>. Instead of conforming to the typical rule of the \u201cput upon\u201d hero, he has to go through his own arc of being humbled, and instead of having a Hero\u2019s Quest\u2122, he\u2019s trapped at the Wall. And while all of GRRM\u2019s work in the first book is relevant to the rest of the books, Jon\u2019s arc in particular is so good at setting up the dominoes of character development that <i>Clash</i>, <i>Storm</i>, and <i>Dance</i> will have so much fun knocking down. I\u2019ll dig into all of this and more below the cut&hellip; .</p><!-- more --><p><b>Bastardy</b></p><p>Being a bastard is the defining point of Jon\u2019s character. It colors everything he does; from his relationships with his siblings to his decision to join the Night\u2019s Watch, all of it is defined through the lens of him being a bastard. It\u2019s so important to his arc that it is the first thing we learn about him in his introduction through Bran\u2019s eyes, and his first introduction via his POV:</p><blockquote><p>Bran\u2019s <b>bastard</b> brother Jon Snow moved closer</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>There were times-not many, but a few-when Jon Snow was glad he was a <b>bastard</b></p></blockquote><p>And the first action we see of him in the text is focused on his bastardy:</p><blockquote><p>Even at seven, Bran understood what his brother had done. The count had come right only because Jon had omitted himself. He had included the girls, included even Rickon, the baby, but not the <b>bastard</b> who bore the surname Snow, the name that custom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own.</p></blockquote><p>Being a bastard means Jon has different expectations; while Robb knows he will grow up to be Lord of Winterfell, and Bran knows he will someday be a knight and bannerman to Robb, Jon has no future. He has the freedom to choose what comes next for him, but not a lot of options and no clear way to bring himself honor. Like most young kids, Jon wants to grow up into a hero:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cDaeren Targaryen was only fourteen when he conquered Dorne,\u201d Jon said. The Young Dragon was one of his heroes.</p></blockquote><p>But as a bastard, the only route Jon sees is by joining the Night\u2019s Watch:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI want to serve in the Night\u2019s Watch, Uncle.\u201d He had thought on it long and hard, lying abed at night while his brothers slept around him. Robb would someday inherit Winterfell, Bran and Rickon would be Robb\u2019s bannerman and rule holdfasts in his name. His sisters Arya and Sansa would marry the heirs of other great houses and go south as mistress of castles of their own. But what place could a bastard hope to earn?</p></blockquote><p>One element of the Night\u2019s Watch that appeals especially to Jon is the oath of celibacy. Having lived as a bastard, it\u2019s clearly not something Jon ever wants his kid to suffer:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI will never father a bastard,\u201d he said carefully \u201cNever!\u201d He spat it out like venom</p></blockquote><p>Being able to join an \u201chonorable\u201d group of men proclaimed in the stories as protectors of the Realm, while also being sworn to celibacy, seems perfect to Jon. It\u2019s everything he\u2019s ever wanted. All of this only appeals to him because he was born a bastard; had he been one of Eddard\u2019s trueborn sons, there is no chance he would have taken the Black.\u00a0</p><p>Becoming a member of the Night\u2019s Watch also frees Jon from the thing he hates: his last name, or lack thereof. One of the defining elements of the Night\u2019s Watch is that it is supposed to be free from the classism that marks the rest of Westeros; even a bastard can rise high. While giving up the family name is the hardest part for most castle-born members of the Watch, it\u2019s exactly what Jon wants to do. The Wall is supposed to be the one place where he isn\u2019t just \u201cNed Stark\u2019s bastard\u201d. Of course, that\u2019s not exactly how Jon finds his time at the wall, but I\u2019ll get to that later.</p><p>Besides deciding Jon\u2019s future, his bastardy also affected many of his relationships, especially with Ned and Catelyn. While most of the other Stark children have an idealization of Ned as a perfect and honorable father/Lord, Jon\u2019s existence proves to him that Ned is capable of failure. Opposed to Sansa, Arya, Robb, and Bran unequivocally proclaiming Ned\u2019s innocence after he is accused of treason, Jon hesitates:</p><blockquote><p>Lord Eddard would never dishonor himself&hellip; would he? He fathered a bastard, a small voice whispered inside him. What was the honor in that? And your mother, what of her? He will not even speak her name.</p></blockquote><p>And earlier in <i>A Game of Thrones</i>, Jon thinks of Ned in a similarly negative light:</p><blockquote><p>He wondered who she [his mother] had been, what she had looked like, why his father had left her. Because she was a whore or an adulteress, fool. Something dark and dishonorable, or else why was Lord Eddard too ashamed to speak of her?</p></blockquote><p>The above quote says so much about who Jon is, and how he views himself and his mother. As I\u2019ll get into more later, Jon has a very high opinion of Ned and still views him as a mostly honorable man, so what does that make him and his mother? How bad must his existence be, that not even Ned Stark is willing to face it? Imagine how awful it would feel, to know the world viewed you as your father\u2019s biggest and only mistake, the one blot on his otherwise perfect honor. And that\u2019s how Jon views himself; because he knows that it\u2019s awful to be born a bastard, and that no one should have to live by that surname, so Ned had to have made a mistake in having him.</p><p>And this opinion of himself is only further reinforced by Catelyn Stark. While I\u2019m tempted to go off on a tangent defending Catelyn\u2019s reaction to Jon (and how it was justified and not actually all that bad, mostly), this is a meta about <i>Jon</i>, and how Catelyn made <i>Jon</i> feel. Having a completely logical and divorced from emotion view of your life when you\u2019re fourteen is impossible, and no matter how much Catelyn\u2019s distaste for him can be justified, it doesn\u2019t change that she made him feel utterly unwanted:</p><blockquote><p>Something cold moved in her eyes. \u201cI told you to leave,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want you here.\u201d</p><p>Once that would have sent him running. Once that might even have made him cry.</p></blockquote><p>While Catelyn\u2019s behavior after Bran\u2019s fall is much worse than it typically is, even her previous actions affected Jon:</p><blockquote><p>He was at the door when she called out to him. \u201cJon,\u201d she said. He should have kept going, but <b>she had never called him by his name before</b>.</p></blockquote><p>In the fourteen years of his life, Catelyn had never once called him by his name. This means that she either called him \u201cbastard\u201d, or never even spoke to him at all. This feeling of being unwanted must have been crippling to Jon, especially when he was younger.</p><p><b>Family</b></p><p>All of the themes in Jon\u2019s <i>AGoT</i> arc are incredibly well interconnected, so I\u2019m not near done discussing how his bastardy defines him. It just happens that it also defined the relationships he had with his family; particularly Ned, Arya, and Sansa (also Catelyn if you include her as a member of Jon\u2019s family).</p><p>As I already touched upon earlier, Jon\u2019s relationship with Ned can never be the same as his other children. Jon is always torn between the love he feels for Ned because Ned has been an objectively great father, and the betrayal he feels for the circumstances of his birth. This quote is the epitome of Jon\u2019s relationship to Ned:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cHe would do whatever was right\u201d he said&hellip; ringingly, to make up for his hesitation. \u201cNo matter what\u201d.</p></blockquote><p>Both the hesitation and Jon\u2019s definitive defense of Ned are how he views his father. \u201cto make up for his hesitation\u201d is very important to Jon\u2019s answer, because he does feel an incredible amount of loyalty to Ned and fully embraced him as his father, even though he has built up resentments over being born a bastard. This quote from <i>Jon VIII</i> goes a long way in showing how dedicated to Ned he is:</p><blockquote><p><i>He is not my father</i>. The thought leapt unbidden to Jon\u2019s mind. <i>Lord Eddard Stark is my father. I will not forget him, no matter how many swords they give me</i></p></blockquote><p>Even though Lord Commander Mormont is offering Jon Longclaw, the ancestral sword of House Mormont (a replacement for Ice, which Ned could never give Jon), Jon\u2019s first thought is to remember Ned. The Night\u2019s Watch is based on the principle of abandoning your family and replacing them with your new brothers, but Jon still chooses to remember Ned.</p><p>And even though Jon is quick to point out that he\u2019s a Snow, not a Stark, when Tyrion says he looks more like Ned than any of his trueborn sons, Jon is happy:</p><blockquote><p>He was pleased by the dwarf\u2019s comment, but he tried not to let it show</p></blockquote><p>When it comes time to take his Night\u2019s Watch vows, Jon decides to take his in the Godswood beyond the Wall instead of inside the Sept:</p><blockquote><p>The gods of the sept had nothing to do with him; the blood of the First Men flowed in the veins of the Starks</p></blockquote><p>Even though Jon often corrects his own inner monologue over his thoughts of being a Stark (for reasons I\u2019ll elaborate on later), his natural instinct is to include himself among them, chiefly because of his admiration for Ned.</p><p>After word gets to the Wall that Ned has been accused of treason and imprisoned, Jon risks his own future to defend Ned\u2019s honor against the taunts of Ser Alliser Thorne:</p><blockquote><p>In the blink of an eye, Jon had vaulted onto the table, dagger in his hand. Pyp made a grab for him, but he wrenched his leg away, and then he was sprinting down the table and kicking the bowl from Ser Alliser\u2019s hand.</p></blockquote><p>And when Jon is riding off to join Robb\u2019s war, his goal is to be recognized as one of Ned\u2019s trueborn sons:</p><blockquote><p>Let them say Eddard Stark had fathered four sons, not three</p></blockquote><p>But even though Jon loves Ned and has a very strong sense of loyalty towards him, he still has a huge amount of built up resentment because of his bastard birth, and the secret identity of his mother. Initially, Jon uses the disappointment of the Night\u2019s Watch as an excuse for why he feels negatively towards Ned, because Ned allowed (also, technically forced him to go, because even though Jon was keen on joining, once Ned decided to go South, Jon had to go North) him to go without properly explaining what the reality was:</p><blockquote><p>No one had told him the Night\u2019s Watch would be like this</p></blockquote><p>But the more he grows accustomed to his place as a Sworn Brother, the more his true grievances with Ned come to the forefront. When confronted with Ned\u2019s potential treason, a part of Jon can\u2019t defend his father:</p><blockquote><p>Lord Eddard would never dishonor himself&hellip; would he?</p></blockquote><p>The idea that Ned could sleep with Jon\u2019s mother and then completely abandon her, and even refuse to speak her name, seems like an incredible injustice to Jon (which it would be if it were true) and is impossible to square with the Ned he grew up with. How can someone you love and trust so much, who has always been a great father, have hurt someone so much?</p><p>This brings us to another very important family member of Jon\u2019s: Lyanna. While Jon doesn\u2019t know she\u2019s his mother, and that\u2019s very important to how she affects his life, GRRM does lay one or two hints through Jon\u2019s intuition that Lyanna is his mother:</p><blockquote><p>He knew nothing of his mother; Eddard Stark would not talk of her. Yet he dreamed of her at times, so often that he could almost see her face. In his dreams, she was beautiful, and highborn, and her eyes were kind</p></blockquote><p>Beautiful and highborn with kind eyes sounds very much like Lyanna. This quote also shows just how constant Jon\u2019s thoughts of his mother are; he dreams of her often enough to have an idea of what she looked like. Yet even though he dreams of her as beautiful and highborn, another part of him believes something much worse about her:</p><blockquote><p>The thought of her made him sad. He wondered who she had been, what she had looked like, why his father had left her. Because she was a whore or an adulteress, fool. Something dark and dishonorable, or else why was Lord Eddard too ashamed to speak of her?</p></blockquote><p>Since he was born a bastard and Ned refuses to speak of his mother, Jon finds himself in a position where the more positively he thinks of Ned, the worse he has to view his mother; her being \u201cdark and dishonorable\u201d lends moral justification to Ned\u2019s decision. But what young kid wants to view their mother as something to be ashamed of? Thinking more highly of his mother puts him right back in the position of hating Ned, though; if she was beautiful and highborn, why did Ned abandon her in shame? Of course we as the audience can see how his mother being Lyanna explains everything, but for Jon this is the paradox of his life. Trying to love both his mother and father while not feeling resentment toward one of them is impossible for him, no matter how hard he tries.</p><p>The next important relationship Jon has with a family member is Arya. She is the closest sibling Jon has, and he misses her more than anyone once he leaves for the Wall:</p><blockquote><p>And Arya&hellip; he missed her even more than Robb, skinny little thing that she was, all scraped knees and tangled hair and torn clothes, so fierce and willful. Arya never seemed to fit, no more than he had</p></blockquote><p>That\u2019s the root of their bond, that both feel like outsiders within Winterfell. Arya\u2019s the only other Stark child who has the brown hair and grey eyes, and just as Jon can never really be \u201cone of them\u201d among Robb, Bran, and Rickon, Arya has never fit in with Sansa, Jeyne, and Beth. Jon\u2019s relationship with Arya also allows us a window into who he really is as a person; before he\u2019s surrounded by strangers or burdened with grief. Unlike fandom perception of him, Jon isn\u2019t even that broody in the first bit of <i>AGoT</i>:</p><blockquote><p>Jon looked her over with all his fourteen-year-old wisdom. \u201cYou\u2019re too skinny,\u201d he said. He took her arm to feel her muscle. Then he sighed and shook his head. \u201cI doubt you could even lift a longsword, little sister, never mind swing one.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>The two of them clearly have an established banter, and Jon enjoys teasing her and calling her \u201clittle sister\u201d. His habit of mussing her hair is also a sign of how close their relationship is. What makes the above quote even cuter, is Jon\u2019s follow through; Jon\u2019s observation that Arya couldn\u2019t lift a longsword is correct, so he goes out of his way to make her a sword she can:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cSo are you,\u201d Jon told her. \u201cI had Mikken make this special. The bravos use swords like this in Pentos and Myr and the other Free Cities. It won\u2019t hack a man\u2019s head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you\u2019re fast enough.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>And the best part is that Jon didn\u2019t make her a smaller version of a Longsword that would functionally be just for show; he clearly spent time discussing with Mikken what kind of small sword would actually be effective, and settled on a Braavosi\u2019s blade for Arya. And the memory of her excitement is one of Jon\u2019s favorite: </p><blockquote><p>The memory of her laughter warmed him on the long ride north.</p></blockquote><p>Arya\u2019s discomfort with typically feminine activities, and her rebellion against societal standards, also helps explain some of Jon\u2019s more forward thinking ideas. While a lot of his progressive ideology comes from his own status as a bastard, it would be wrong to overlook the influence Arya has had on the way Jon views women. While it isn\u2019t a concept that is explored too much in <i>AGoT</i>, Jon\u2019s perception of women is crucial to his <i>ACoK</i>, <i>ASoS</i>, and <i>ADWD</i> arcs. Being exposed to Arya\u2019s tomboyishness helps prepare Jon for the Wildling Spearwives, and especially his relationship with Ygritte. </p><p>As well as Jon giving Arya Needle, there is plenty of other signs that they\u2019re very close:</p><blockquote><p>She set it aside almost shyly and showered him with kisses</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon messed up her hair. \u201cI will miss you, little sister.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Arya glanced behind her, saw Jon, and jumped to her feet. She threw her skinny arms tight around his neck</p></blockquote><p><i>Arya I</i> and <i>Jon II</i> are the only chapters we actually see them interact, but both chapters are full of quotes showing how close the two are. I already mentioned it above, but I love the way Jon calls her \u201clittle sister\u201d and messes with her hair; its a great choice by GRRM, because it immediately conveys so much love and affection between them. In a short number of pages he completely sells you on the sibling bond between Jon and Arya. While the payoff isn\u2019t in <i>AGoT</i>, that bond is extremely important once Jon is Lord Commander in <i>ADwD</i>. </p><p>For all the closeness Jon shares with Arya, he has almost none of the same memories with Sansa. She is the only one of his siblings who overtly treats him like a bastard, and not part of their family proper. While this clearly comes from her close bond with her mother Catelyn, it\u2019s interesting to see how this treatment affected Jon. I\u2019d like to set the record straight on just how much Jon and Sansa disliked each other. Fandom perception paints it as if Sansa endlessly bullied him and they hated each other - that is very much <b>NOT</b> the case. Sansa\u2019s relationship with Jon is so interesting because it isn\u2019t like his with Arya, where she sees him as an equal, or with Robb, where they mostly get along well but Robb\u2019s existence is a reminder of everything Jon can\u2019t have, or even Jon\u2019s relationship with Catelyn, which is obviously venomous. His relationship with Sansa is so unique because they were completely cordial, but both of them were always aware of the other\u2019s status. The worst thing Sansa ever did to Jon was call him \u201cbastard\u201d - and that\u2019s all it took to hurt Jon. It really bothers me that fandom distorts this dynamic so much, because it is a much more interesting exploration of human nature the way GRRM wrote it. </p><p>Another important familial relationship Jon develops in <i>AGoT</i> is his brotherly bond with Samwell Tarly. Jon\u2019s relationship with Sam offers him something unique that he never had with his other brothers - the chance to be the superior. Whereas Jon was always in the shadow of Robb, who\u2019s mere presence made Jon feel inferior, Sam gives Jon a chance to take Robb\u2019s place as the leader. He can council and teach Sam about things without the cloud that hung over him and Robb\u2019s relationship. He gets to be a leader around Sam, in a way that he always was one step below Robb. </p><p>Jon\u2019s friendship with Sam is also another relationship that helps him move passed Westeros\u2019 more bigoted beliefs. When Jon first stands up for Sam, he does so out of a belief that no one should be bullied, but still judges Sam about as harshly as the rest of them do - going so far as to call Sam a coward to his face. But he is the only one to hear Sam out and understand how and why Sam is the way he is. And after he hears Sam\u2019s story, he goes out of his way to protect him from Ser Alliser. Once Jon has made the decision to be Sam\u2019s protector, he slowly comes around to seeing Sam\u2019s value, and ends up putting himself on the line and creating enemies to save Sam from being bullied by Alliser after Jon is made a Steward. His appeal to Maester Aemon shows just how much Jon has thought about Sam\u2019s gifts; he sees the importance of reading, writing, and being as smart as Sam is. </p><p>Getting back to the idea that all of Jon\u2019s narrative themes are extremely interconnected, notice the pattern in many of Jon\u2019s relationships - he is always siding with the underdog. His bastard status makes him feel as if he belongs with the misfits, and he tends \u00a0to seek the companionship of people who don\u2019t quite fit in because he understands the particular way in which they feel left out. </p><p><b>Guilt</b></p><p>Guilt is all over Jon\u2019s arc: Ned\u2019s guilt, both over how Lyanna died and lying to Jon and Catelyn, and Jon\u2019s guilt about everything. </p><p>Because Jon is a bastard, almost all of his desires come with the sting of guilt. I didn\u2019t discuss his relationship with Robb under Family because I think that relationship, sadly, fits better under the theme of guilt. However much Jon holds resentment and hostility for Robb over him being the heir, is outweighed twice over by how much guilt Jon feels over those same feelings. This passage sums it up quite well:</p><blockquote><p>When Jon had been Bran\u2019s age, he had dreamed of doing great deeds, as boys always did. The details of his feats changed with every dreaming, but quite often he imagined saving his father\u2019s life. Afterward Lord Eddard would declare that Jon had proven himself a true Stark, and place Ice in his hand&hellip; What kind of man stole his own brother\u2019s birthright?</p></blockquote><p>Jon is having the same fantasies all young kids do, of being a hero and having his father accept him as his own. But the thought is spoiled by the fact that him having Ice means that he stole it from Robb. If Jon is acknowledged as Ned\u2019s trueborn son, he has to take the title of firstborn from Robb. How hard must it have been for Jon to balance wanting to feel loved and like he belonged, with the feeling that he was taking something from his brothers and sisters? Catelyn consistenly reinforcing the idea that he could steal Robb\u2019s birthright must have just added to Jon\u2019s hatred of his own wants. Fandom jokes about \u201cbroody\u201d Jon Snow a lot, but this is some very dark stuff to try and reconcile with as a kid. All Jon wanted was to be a Stark, but if he gets to be one, he has to take the title from his brother. When Jon refuses to be called a Stark, and repeatedly declares himself a Snow - reasserting his bastard birth - it isn\u2019t because he doesn\u2019t want to be a Stark; it\u2019s because he\u2019s distancing himself from any thought that he could ever take Robb\u2019s birthright. </p><p>Jon\u2019s guilt over his relationship with Robb is a huge factor in why he joins the Night\u2019s Watch. As I touched on above, being born a bastard didn\u2019t leave Jon with many options as far as bringing himself honor, and the only honor that he truly wants (to be a Stark) is one he can\u2019t have. So that leaves him with only two options really - join the King\u2019s Guard, or the Night\u2019s Watch. And as someone who seeks to honor the Stark way of doing things, he definitely wasn\u2019t going to go South and become an anointed Knight. The added bonus that the Night\u2019s Watch has over the Kingsguard is that he leaves behind his family and his past. As I mentioned in the Bastard section, this very much appealed to Jon because he could drop the meaning of \u201cSnow\u201d and just be a sworn brother; but it also appealed to Jon because it means he can never take what\u2019s rightfully Robb\u2019s. Once and for all he removed himself \u00a0from the equation and could never be tempted to take Winterfell from Robb, Bran, or Rickon. Of course, it doesn\u2019t quite play out that way, but that isn\u2019t until <i>A Dance With Dragons</i>. That book also really highlights the mental agony Jon\u2019s relationship with Robb causes him; it\u2019s only touched upon in <i>Game</i>, but by the time we get to <i>Dance</i> he\u2019s having nightmares of <i>murdering</i> Robb. </p><p>And as a bastard, Jon also feels neglected and overlooked; these feelings make him resent his family, and he then feels guilt over that resentment. Tyrion tries to bond with him over this:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve dreamt the same kind of dreams\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jon Snow said, horrified \u201cI wouldn\u2019t&hellip; \u201c</p></blockquote><blockquote><p> \u201che must have good reason for packing you off to the Night\u2019s Watch\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d Jon Snow said, his face dark with anger&hellip; \u201cStop it!\u201d the boy screamed. He took a step forward, his hands coiling into fists, close to tears</p></blockquote><p>Jon is so horrified by Tyrion\u2019s dreams of burning his siblings because, in his own way, he does have those dreams. But unlike Tyrion, who embraces his hate, Jon hates the way he feels. That\u2019s plain to see from Jon\u2019s later chapters:</p><blockquote><p>In his mind\u2019s eye he saw Ben Stark lying dead, his blood red on the snow. The thought made him sick. What was he becoming?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon remembered the wish he\u2019d wished in his anger, the vision of Benjen Stark dead in the snow</p></blockquote><p><b>Between Two Worlds</b></p><p>Potentially the most ever-present theme in Jon\u2019s arc is that he doesn\u2019t quite fit anywhere, because he\u2019s between two worlds. A brother of the Night\u2019s Watch, but he can\u2019t let go of his family; a bastard, but castle-born and privileged; a Stark, but a Snow; and the list goes on and on.</p><p>Leaving his family behind and becoming a Brother of the Night\u2019s Watch proves much harder for Jon than he thought it would be; notice that I didn\u2019t include any of the Night\u2019s Watch besides Sam under Jon\u2019s family, even though they\u2019re supposed to be his brothers. </p><p>The first reason he couldn\u2019t fit in with them is because of his snobbishness, mixed with the self-pity of someone born a bastard. Jon had always viewed himself as the victim, which he was among his family, and didn\u2019t even consider how much worse off the rest of lowborn Westeros had it. He was so used to being called a bastard as an insult, that he didn\u2019t realize to the other brothers it was just a fact of life. Donal Noye calls him on this in <i>Jon III</i>:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Now think on this, boy. None of these others have ever had a master-at-arms until Ser Alliser. Their fathers were farmers and wagonmen and poachers, smiths and miners and oars on a trading galley. What they know of fighting they learned between decks, in the alleys of Oldtown and Lannisport, in wayside brothels and taverns on the kingsroad. They may have clacked a few sticks together before they came here, but I promise you, not one in twenty was ever rich enough to own a real sword.&rdquo; His look was grim. &ldquo;So how do you like the taste of your victories now, Lord Snow?&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Jon hates that Ser Alliser calls him Lord Snow, but the nickname fits. He may be a bastard, but he is definitely a Lord. Jon hates that people look down on him for being a bastard, but he does his fair share of looking down on others; there is a reason he thinks of his mother as a noblewoman, and it\u2019s not because he\u2019s so welcoming of those of lower social standing. Donal Noye goes a long way in helping him shake this mindset, though. But that still doesn\u2019t help Jon fit entirely; while Jon learns that others had it worse than he did, and ends up being close friends with the Brothers he used to bully, he still doesn\u2019t quite belong with them. He was raised in a castle, and is never going to lose that. He doesn\u2019t fit with the Noble born who look down on him for his birth, but he also can\u2019t fit in with the lowborn who lived on the streets or in poverty; in short, he\u2019ll never fit with Pyp or Grenn, but he surely doesn\u2019t fit with Ser Alliser.\u00a0</p><p>Even after Jon becomes friends with his Brothers, he isn\u2019t happy at the wall because he can\u2019t let go of his old life. Jon makes a real effort to forget Winterfell and join the Night\u2019s Watch, and tell himself that the Night\u2019s Watch is his family now:</p><blockquote><p>The grey walls of Winterfell might still haunt his dreams, but Castle Black was his life now, and his brothers were Sam and Grenn and Halder and Pyp and the other cast-outs who wore the black of the Night&rsquo;s Watch.</p></blockquote><p>But he can\u2019t shake Winterfell. The only reason he reaches out to make friends with Grenn after their fight, is because he is in such a good mood after finding out that Bran was going to live. And before Tyrion leaves the Wall, Jon tells him this:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cTell Robb that I\u2019m going to command the Night\u2019s Watch and keep him safe, so he might as well take up needlework&hellip;Bran&hellip;\u201d He stopped suddenly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what message to send him. Help him, Tyrion\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Jon is still overwhelmed with thoughts of Bran and Robb and Winterfell. Even after he has officially taken his Night\u2019s Watch oath and sworn away his past, Jon is furious at Lord Commander Mormont for not keeping him informed of Ned\u2019s imprisonment and Robb\u2019s army. Insults to his family make Jon attack a fellow brother of the Night\u2019s Watch (Ser Alliser). And when it really comes time to choose between the Night\u2019s Watch and his family, Jon runs away:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I belong with my brother.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Even though Grenn tells Jon that they are his brothers, he refuses to go back. The only reason he eventually goes with them is because he knows he\u2019ll have to hurt them or worse to get away. I think it\u2019s an overlooked detail that Sam, Pyp, and Grenn don\u2019t actually convince Jon of anything when they repeat their vows; Jon goes back with the intention of running off at a later date, knowing they can\u2019t watch him 24/7. The reason he ends up staying is because Lord Mormont says he will get to go ranging; and ranging means going beyond the Wall, which means searching for Uncle Benjen. So even though he stays with the Night\u2019s Watch instead of joining Robb\u2019s host, it\u2019s only because he wants to find his family.\u00a0</p><p>And even though Jon loves his family, he doesn\u2019t quite feel at home there either. Being a bastard means that he was never truly a Stark, and he knows that he can\u2019t be with them no matter how much the idea pains him. That\u2019s why he has dreams of wandering around Winterfell like he doesn\u2019t belong:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sometimes I dream about it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m walking down this long empty hall. My voice echoes all around, but no one answers, so I walk faster, opening doors, shouting names. I don&rsquo;t even know who I&rsquo;m looking for. Most nights it&rsquo;s my father, but sometimes it&rsquo;s Robb instead, or my little sister Arya, or my uncle.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Jon is searching for something he can\u2019t find in Winterfell because he never quite felt at home there, which of course is foreshadowing for a very important reveal to come, but also emphasizes the distance he feels from his family:</p><blockquote><p>Your half brothers, a voice inside reminded him. And Lady Stark, who will not welcome you. There was no place for him in Winterfell, no place in King\u2019s Landing either. Even his own mother had not had a place for him</p></blockquote><p>Jon being perpetually trapped between two worlds is so important to his arc because it means he always feels out of place; all of his misfittings lead to a young kid who feels just so alone. Even when he\u2019s surrounded by people he loves, and who love him, he is alone. Jon is dark and broody because he doesn\u2019t feel like he has a family, or anyone; and that is just so sad.\u00a0</p><p><b>The Supernatural</b></p><p>The last key component to Jon\u2019s arc in <i>A Game of Thrones</i> is his connection with the supernatural. He is one of three main characters (the other two being Daenerys and Bran) who\u2019s storyline is so intertwined with the magical elements of GRRM\u2019s world, and especially is connected to the White Walkers.</p><p>Before I get to Jon\u2019s connection to the Others, though, I want to talk about his connection to the Old Gods. I think this connection is going to be extremely important later down the road, especially when Jon is confronted with his true parentage and has to choose who he is. Jon is connected to the Old Gods as soon as the series begins, all the way back in <i>Bran I</i>, when he hears a noise and finds Ghost; of course, that detail becomes especially interesting when we learn in <i>Jon</i> <i>I</i> that Ghost never makes a sound \u2013 so what did Jon hear? It was very clearly something magical that led Jon to Ghost, and speaks to their connection to each other.\u00a0</p><p>And when he takes his oath to join the Night\u2019s Watch, Jon decides to ride out to the Weirwoods beyond the Wall to make his vow in front of the Old Gods; it\u2019s there that Jon first sees the connection between Ghost and the trees:</p><blockquote><p><i>White fur and red eyes</i>, Jon realized, disquieted. <i>Like the trees</i>&hellip;\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Ghost is the only direwolf colored so distinctly; whereas Lady, Nymeria, and Summer are all grey with gold eyes, and Shaggydog is black with eyes like wildfire, Ghost is pure white with bright red eyes just like the Weirwoods. While Jon\u2019s connection to the North and Old Gods hasn\u2019t been fully explored in the narrative yet, it seems like very interesting foreshadowing for things to come.</p><p>It\u2019s also important that Ghost is what connects Jon to his plot with the White Walkers; while taking his oath beyond the Wall, Ghost returns to Jon with the hand of a wight. And when the Rangers try to drag the bodies back with horses, the animals refuse to go near; Chett\u2019s dogs also bark like mad and won\u2019t get close to the wights. Ghost is the only one willing to get close to them. Ghost also somehow senses that Mormont is being attacked by the Wights, and scratches at the door until he gets Jon\u2019s attention. It\u2019s still unclear what the connection is, but Ghost\u2019s reaction to the Others hints at something special between them and direwolves, as well as the Starks that are bonded with them.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Jon\u2019s supernatural plot doesn\u2019t end with Ghost and the White Walkers, though; he shares the same prophetic dreams that Bran and Rickon have. This is a dream he has shortly before Ned dies in <i>A Game of Thrones</i>:</p><blockquote><p>Last night he had dreamt the Winterfell dream again. He was wandering the empty castle, searching for his father, descending into the crypts. Only this time the dream had gone further than before. In the dark he\u2019d saw that the vaults were opening, one after the other. As the dead kings came stumbling from their cold black graves, Jon had woken in pitch-dark, his heart hammering. Even when Ghost leapt up on the bed to nuzzle at his face, he could not shake his deep sense of terror.</p></blockquote><p>And he also has a dream where he comes face to face with Ned\u2019s corpse. All of these supernatural plots are of course leading to Jon\u2019s death and resurrection, and also his role in the final battle against the White Walkers. The prophetic dreams also connect him to a select few Targaryens who seemed to be able to see some parts of the future. He is magical in both a Stark and Targaryen way, connecting him to all the magical plots of the book and the title of the series.</p><p>As the above analysis shows, <i>A Game of Thrones</i> is more of an introduction to Jon\u2019s character than anything else; GRRM opens many doors and leaves most of Jon\u2019s character arc for his later books, which I can\u2019t wait to write about; for now, though, that\u2019s all I have for Jon\u2019s arc in <i>A Game of Thrones</i>.<br/></p>",

I\u2019ll dig into all of this and more below the cut\u2026 .</p>[[MORE]]<p><b>Bastardy</b></p><p>Being a bastard is the defining point of Jon\u2019s character. It colors everything he does; from his relationships with his siblings to his decision to join the Night\u2019s Watch, all of it is defined through the lens of him being a bastard. It\u2019s so important to his arc that it is the first thing we learn about him in his introduction through Bran\u2019s eyes, and his first introduction via his POV:</p><blockquote><p>Bran\u2019s <b>bastard</b> brother Jon Snow moved closer</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>There were times-not many, but a few-when Jon Snow was glad he was a <b>bastard</b></p></blockquote><p>And the first action we see of him in the text is focused on his bastardy:</p><blockquote><p>Even at seven, Bran understood what his brother had done. The count had come right only because Jon had omitted himself. He had included the girls, included even Rickon, the baby, but not the <b>bastard</b> who bore the surname Snow, the name that custom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own.</p></blockquote><p>Being a bastard means Jon has different expectations; while Robb knows he will grow up to be Lord of Winterfell, and Bran knows he will someday be a knight and bannerman to Robb, Jon has no future. He has the freedom to choose what comes next for him, but not a lot of options and no clear way to bring himself honor. Like most young kids, Jon wants to grow up into a hero:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cDaeren Targaryen was only fourteen when he conquered Dorne,\u201d Jon said. The Young Dragon was one of his heroes.</p></blockquote><p>But as a bastard, the only route Jon sees is by joining the Night\u2019s Watch:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI want to serve in the Night\u2019s Watch, Uncle.\u201d He had thought on it long and hard, lying abed at night while his brothers slept around him. Robb would someday inherit Winterfell, Bran and Rickon would be Robb\u2019s bannerman and rule holdfasts in his name. His sisters Arya and Sansa would marry the heirs of other great houses and go south as mistress of castles of their own. But what place could a bastard hope to earn?</p></blockquote><p>One element of the Night\u2019s Watch that appeals especially to Jon is the oath of celibacy. Having lived as a bastard, it\u2019s clearly not something Jon ever wants his kid to suffer:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI will never father a bastard,\u201d he said carefully \u201cNever!\u201d He spat it out like venom</p></blockquote><p>Being able to join an \u201chonorable\u201d group of men proclaimed in the stories as protectors of the Realm, while also being sworn to celibacy, seems perfect to Jon. It\u2019s everything he\u2019s ever wanted. All of this only appeals to him because he was born a bastard; had he been one of Eddard\u2019s trueborn sons, there is no chance he would have taken the Black.\u00a0</p><p>Becoming a member of the Night\u2019s Watch also frees Jon from the thing he hates: his last name, or lack thereof. One of the defining elements of the Night\u2019s Watch is that it is supposed to be free from the classism that marks the rest of Westeros; even a bastard can rise high. While giving up the family name is the hardest part for most castle-born members of the Watch, it\u2019s exactly what Jon wants to do. The Wall is supposed to be the one place where he isn\u2019t just \u201cNed Stark\u2019s bastard\u201d. Of course, that\u2019s not exactly how Jon finds his time at the wall, but I\u2019ll get to that later.</p><p>Besides deciding Jon\u2019s future, his bastardy also affected many of his relationships, especially with Ned and Catelyn. While most of the other Stark children have an idealization of Ned as a perfect and honorable father/Lord, Jon\u2019s existence proves to him that Ned is capable of failure. Opposed to Sansa, Arya, Robb, and Bran unequivocally proclaiming Ned\u2019s innocence after he is accused of treason, Jon hesitates:</p><blockquote><p>Lord Eddard would never dishonor himself\u2026 would he? He fathered a bastard, a small voice whispered inside him. What was the honor in that? And your mother, what of her? He will not even speak her name.</p></blockquote><p>And earlier in <i>A Game of Thrones</i>, Jon thinks of Ned in a similarly negative light:</p><blockquote><p>He wondered who she [his mother] had been, what she had looked like, why his father had left her. Because she was a whore or an adulteress, fool. Something dark and dishonorable, or else why was Lord Eddard too ashamed to speak of her?</p></blockquote><p>The above quote says so much about who Jon is, and how he views himself and his mother. As I\u2019ll get into more later, Jon has a very high opinion of Ned and still views him as a mostly honorable man, so what does that make him and his mother? How bad must his existence be, that not even Ned Stark is willing to face it? Imagine how awful it would feel, to know the world viewed you as your father\u2019s biggest and only mistake, the one blot on his otherwise perfect honor. And that\u2019s how Jon views himself; because he knows that it\u2019s awful to be born a bastard, and that no one should have to live by that surname, so Ned had to have made a mistake in having him.</p><p>And this opinion of himself is only further reinforced by Catelyn Stark. While I\u2019m tempted to go off on a tangent defending Catelyn\u2019s reaction to Jon (and how it was justified and not actually all that bad, mostly), this is a meta about <i>Jon</i>, and how Catelyn made <i>Jon</i> feel. Having a completely logical and divorced from emotion view of your life when you\u2019re fourteen is impossible, and no matter how much Catelyn\u2019s distaste for him can be justified, it doesn\u2019t change that she made him feel utterly unwanted:</p><blockquote><p>Something cold moved in her eyes. \u201cI told you to leave,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want you here.\u201d</p><p>Once that would have sent him running. Once that might even have made him cry.</p></blockquote><p>While Catelyn\u2019s behavior after Bran\u2019s fall is much worse than it typically is, even her previous actions affected Jon:</p><blockquote><p>He was at the door when she called out to him. \u201cJon,\u201d she said. He should have kept going, but <b>she had never called him by his name before</b>.</p></blockquote><p>In the fourteen years of his life, Catelyn had never once called him by his name. This means that she either called him \u201cbastard\u201d, or never even spoke to him at all. This feeling of being unwanted must have been crippling to Jon, especially when he was younger.</p><p><b>Family</b></p><p>All of the themes in Jon\u2019s <i>AGoT</i> arc are incredibly well interconnected, so I\u2019m not near done discussing how his bastardy defines him. It just happens that it also defined the relationships he had with his family; particularly Ned, Arya, and Sansa (also Catelyn if you include her as a member of Jon\u2019s family).</p><p>As I already touched upon earlier, Jon\u2019s relationship with Ned can never be the same as his other children. Jon is always torn between the love he feels for Ned because Ned has been an objectively great father, and the betrayal he feels for the circumstances of his birth. This quote is the epitome of Jon\u2019s relationship to Ned:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cHe would do whatever was right\u201d he said\u2026 ringingly, to make up for his hesitation. \u201cNo matter what\u201d.</p></blockquote><p>Both the hesitation and Jon\u2019s definitive defense of Ned are how he views his father. \u201cto make up for his hesitation\u201d is very important to Jon\u2019s answer, because he does feel an incredible amount of loyalty to Ned and fully embraced him as his father, even though he has built up resentments over being born a bastard. This quote from <i>Jon VIII</i> goes a long way in showing how dedicated to Ned he is:</p><blockquote><p><i>He is not my father</i>. The thought leapt unbidden to Jon\u2019s mind. <i>Lord Eddard Stark is my father. I will not forget him, no matter how many swords they give me</i></p></blockquote><p>Even though Lord Commander Mormont is offering Jon Longclaw, the ancestral sword of House Mormont (a replacement for Ice, which Ned could never give Jon), Jon\u2019s first thought is to remember Ned. The Night\u2019s Watch is based on the principle of abandoning your family and replacing them with your new brothers, but Jon still chooses to remember Ned.</p><p>And even though Jon is quick to point out that he\u2019s a Snow, not a Stark, when Tyrion says he looks more like Ned than any of his trueborn sons, Jon is happy:</p><blockquote><p>He was pleased by the dwarf\u2019s comment, but he tried not to let it show</p></blockquote><p>When it comes time to take his Night\u2019s Watch vows, Jon decides to take his in the Godswood beyond the Wall instead of inside the Sept:</p><blockquote><p>The gods of the sept had nothing to do with him; the blood of the First Men flowed in the veins of the Starks</p></blockquote><p>Even though Jon often corrects his own inner monologue over his thoughts of being a Stark (for reasons I\u2019ll elaborate on later), his natural instinct is to include himself among them, chiefly because of his admiration for Ned.</p><p>After word gets to the Wall that Ned has been accused of treason and imprisoned, Jon risks his own future to defend Ned\u2019s honor against the taunts of Ser Alliser Thorne:</p><blockquote><p>In the blink of an eye, Jon had vaulted onto the table, dagger in his hand. Pyp made a grab for him, but he wrenched his leg away, and then he was sprinting down the table and kicking the bowl from Ser Alliser\u2019s hand.</p></blockquote><p>And when Jon is riding off to join Robb\u2019s war, his goal is to be recognized as one of Ned\u2019s trueborn sons:</p><blockquote><p>Let them say Eddard Stark had fathered four sons, not three</p></blockquote><p>But even though Jon loves Ned and has a very strong sense of loyalty towards him, he still has a huge amount of built up resentment because of his bastard birth, and the secret identity of his mother. Initially, Jon uses the disappointment of the Night\u2019s Watch as an excuse for why he feels negatively towards Ned, because Ned allowed (also, technically forced him to go, because even though Jon was keen on joining, once Ned decided to go South, Jon had to go North) him to go without properly explaining what the reality was:</p><blockquote><p>No one had told him the Night\u2019s Watch would be like this</p></blockquote><p>But the more he grows accustomed to his place as a Sworn Brother, the more his true grievances with Ned come to the forefront. When confronted with Ned\u2019s potential treason, a part of Jon can\u2019t defend his father:</p><blockquote><p>Lord Eddard would never dishonor himself\u2026 would he?</p></blockquote><p>The idea that Ned could sleep with Jon\u2019s mother and then completely abandon her, and even refuse to speak her name, seems like an incredible injustice to Jon (which it would be if it were true) and is impossible to square with the Ned he grew up with. How can someone you love and trust so much, who has always been a great father, have hurt someone so much?</p><p>This brings us to another very important family member of Jon\u2019s: Lyanna. While Jon doesn\u2019t know she\u2019s his mother, and that\u2019s very important to how she affects his life, GRRM does lay one or two hints through Jon\u2019s intuition that Lyanna is his mother:</p><blockquote><p>He knew nothing of his mother; Eddard Stark would not talk of her. Yet he dreamed of her at times, so often that he could almost see her face. In his dreams, she was beautiful, and highborn, and her eyes were kind</p></blockquote><p>Beautiful and highborn with kind eyes sounds very much like Lyanna. This quote also shows just how constant Jon\u2019s thoughts of his mother are; he dreams of her often enough to have an idea of what she looked like. Yet even though he dreams of her as beautiful and highborn, another part of him believes something much worse about her:</p><blockquote><p>The thought of her made him sad. He wondered who she had been, what she had looked like, why his father had left her. Because she was a whore or an adulteress, fool. Something dark and dishonorable, or else why was Lord Eddard too ashamed to speak of her?</p></blockquote><p>Since he was born a bastard and Ned refuses to speak of his mother, Jon finds himself in a position where the more positively he thinks of Ned, the worse he has to view his mother; her being \u201cdark and dishonorable\u201d lends moral justification to Ned\u2019s decision. But what young kid wants to view their mother as something to be ashamed of? Thinking more highly of his mother puts him right back in the position of hating Ned, though; if she was beautiful and highborn, why did Ned abandon her in shame? Of course we as the audience can see how his mother being Lyanna explains everything, but for Jon this is the paradox of his life. Trying to love both his mother and father while not feeling resentment toward one of them is impossible for him, no matter how hard he tries.</p><p>The next important relationship Jon has with a family member is Arya. She is the closest sibling Jon has, and he misses her more than anyone once he leaves for the Wall:</p><blockquote><p>And Arya\u2026 he missed her even more than Robb, skinny little thing that she was, all scraped knees and tangled hair and torn clothes, so fierce and willful. Arya never seemed to fit, no more than he had</p></blockquote><p>That\u2019s the root of their bond, that both feel like outsiders within Winterfell. Arya\u2019s the only other Stark child who has the brown hair and grey eyes, and just as Jon can never really be \u201cone of them\u201d among Robb, Bran, and Rickon, Arya has never fit in with Sansa, Jeyne, and Beth. Jon\u2019s relationship with Arya also allows us a window into who he really is as a person; before he\u2019s surrounded by strangers or burdened with grief. Unlike fandom perception of him, Jon isn\u2019t even that broody in the first bit of <i>AGoT</i>:</p><blockquote><p>Jon looked her over with all his fourteen-year-old wisdom. \u201cYou\u2019re too skinny,\u201d he said. He took her arm to feel her muscle. Then he sighed and shook his head. \u201cI doubt you could even lift a longsword, little sister, never mind swing one.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>The two of them clearly have an established banter, and Jon enjoys teasing her and calling her \u201clittle sister\u201d. His habit of mussing her hair is also a sign of how close their relationship is. What makes the above quote even cuter, is Jon\u2019s follow through; Jon\u2019s observation that Arya couldn\u2019t lift a longsword is correct, so he goes out of his way to make her a sword she can:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cSo are you,\u201d Jon told her. \u201cI had Mikken make this special. The bravos use swords like this in Pentos and Myr and the other Free Cities. It won\u2019t hack a man\u2019s head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you\u2019re fast enough.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>And the best part is that Jon didn\u2019t make her a smaller version of a Longsword that would functionally be just for show; he clearly spent time discussing with Mikken what kind of small sword would actually be effective, and settled on a Braavosi\u2019s blade for Arya. And the memory of her excitement is one of Jon\u2019s favorite: </p><blockquote><p>The memory of her laughter warmed him on the long ride north.</p></blockquote><p>Arya\u2019s discomfort with typically feminine activities, and her rebellion against societal standards, also helps explain some of Jon\u2019s more forward thinking ideas. While a lot of his progressive ideology comes from his own status as a bastard, it would be wrong to overlook the influence Arya has had on the way Jon views women. While it isn\u2019t a concept that is explored too much in <i>AGoT</i>, Jon\u2019s perception of women is crucial to his <i>ACoK</i>, <i>ASoS</i>, and <i>ADWD</i> arcs. Being exposed to Arya\u2019s tomboyishness helps prepare Jon for the Wildling Spearwives, and especially his relationship with Ygritte. </p><p>As well as Jon giving Arya Needle, there is plenty of other signs that they\u2019re very close:</p><blockquote><p>She set it aside almost shyly and showered him with kisses</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon messed up her hair. \u201cI will miss you, little sister.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Arya glanced behind her, saw Jon, and jumped to her feet. She threw her skinny arms tight around his neck</p></blockquote><p><i>Arya I</i> and <i>Jon II</i> are the only chapters we actually see them interact, but both chapters are full of quotes showing how close the two are. I already mentioned it above, but I love the way Jon calls her \u201clittle sister\u201d and messes with her hair; its a great choice by GRRM, because it immediately conveys so much love and affection between them. In a short number of pages he completely sells you on the sibling bond between Jon and Arya. While the payoff isn\u2019t in <i>AGoT</i>, that bond is extremely important once Jon is Lord Commander in <i>ADwD</i>. </p><p>For all the closeness Jon shares with Arya, he has almost none of the same memories with Sansa. She is the only one of his siblings who overtly treats him like a bastard, and not part of their family proper. While this clearly comes from her close bond with her mother Catelyn, it\u2019s interesting to see how this treatment affected Jon. I\u2019d like to set the record straight on just how much Jon and Sansa disliked each other. Fandom perception paints it as if Sansa endlessly bullied him and they hated each other - that is very much <b>NOT</b> the case. Sansa\u2019s relationship with Jon is so interesting because it isn\u2019t like his with Arya, where she sees him as an equal, or with Robb, where they mostly get along well but Robb\u2019s existence is a reminder of everything Jon can\u2019t have, or even Jon\u2019s relationship with Catelyn, which is obviously venomous. His relationship with Sansa is so unique because they were completely cordial, but both of them were always aware of the other\u2019s status. The worst thing Sansa ever did to Jon was call him \u201cbastard\u201d - and that\u2019s all it took to hurt Jon. It really bothers me that fandom distorts this dynamic so much, because it is a much more interesting exploration of human nature the way GRRM wrote it. </p><p>Another important familial relationship Jon develops in <i>AGoT</i> is his brotherly bond with Samwell Tarly. Jon\u2019s relationship with Sam offers him something unique that he never had with his other brothers - the chance to be the superior. Whereas Jon was always in the shadow of Robb, who\u2019s mere presence made Jon feel inferior, Sam gives Jon a chance to take Robb\u2019s place as the leader. He can council and teach Sam about things without the cloud that hung over him and Robb\u2019s relationship. He gets to be a leader around Sam, in a way that he always was one step below Robb. </p><p>Jon\u2019s friendship with Sam is also another relationship that helps him move passed Westeros\u2019 more bigoted beliefs. When Jon first stands up for Sam, he does so out of a belief that no one should be bullied, but still judges Sam about as harshly as the rest of them do - going so far as to call Sam a coward to his face. But he is the only one to hear Sam out and understand how and why Sam is the way he is. And after he hears Sam\u2019s story, he goes out of his way to protect him from Ser Alliser. Once Jon has made the decision to be Sam\u2019s protector, he slowly comes around to seeing Sam\u2019s value, and ends up putting himself on the line and creating enemies to save Sam from being bullied by Alliser after Jon is made a Steward. His appeal to Maester Aemon shows just how much Jon has thought about Sam\u2019s gifts; he sees the importance of reading, writing, and being as smart as Sam is. </p><p>Getting back to the idea that all of Jon\u2019s narrative themes are extremely interconnected, notice the pattern in many of Jon\u2019s relationships - he is always siding with the underdog. His bastard status makes him feel as if he belongs with the misfits, and he tends \u00a0to seek the companionship of people who don\u2019t quite fit in because he understands the particular way in which they feel left out. </p><p><b>Guilt</b></p><p>Guilt is all over Jon\u2019s arc: Ned\u2019s guilt, both over how Lyanna died and lying to Jon and Catelyn, and Jon\u2019s guilt about everything. </p><p>Because Jon is a bastard, almost all of his desires come with the sting of guilt. I didn\u2019t discuss his relationship with Robb under Family because I think that relationship, sadly, fits better under the theme of guilt. However much Jon holds resentment and hostility for Robb over him being the heir, is outweighed twice over by how much guilt Jon feels over those same feelings. This passage sums it up quite well:</p><blockquote><p>When Jon had been Bran\u2019s age, he had dreamed of doing great deeds, as boys always did. The details of his feats changed with every dreaming, but quite often he imagined saving his father\u2019s life. Afterward Lord Eddard would declare that Jon had proven himself a true Stark, and place Ice in his hand\u2026 What kind of man stole his own brother\u2019s birthright?</p></blockquote><p>Jon is having the same fantasies all young kids do, of being a hero and having his father accept him as his own. But the thought is spoiled by the fact that him having Ice means that he stole it from Robb. If Jon is acknowledged as Ned\u2019s trueborn son, he has to take the title of firstborn from Robb. How hard must it have been for Jon to balance wanting to feel loved and like he belonged, with the feeling that he was taking something from his brothers and sisters? Catelyn consistenly reinforcing the idea that he could steal Robb\u2019s birthright must have just added to Jon\u2019s hatred of his own wants. Fandom jokes about \u201cbroody\u201d Jon Snow a lot, but this is some very dark stuff to try and reconcile with as a kid. All Jon wanted was to be a Stark, but if he gets to be one, he has to take the title from his brother. When Jon refuses to be called a Stark, and repeatedly declares himself a Snow - reasserting his bastard birth - it isn\u2019t because he doesn\u2019t want to be a Stark; it\u2019s because he\u2019s distancing himself from any thought that he could ever take Robb\u2019s birthright. </p><p>Jon\u2019s guilt over his relationship with Robb is a huge factor in why he joins the Night\u2019s Watch. As I touched on above, being born a bastard didn\u2019t leave Jon with many options as far as bringing himself honor, and the only honor that he truly wants (to be a Stark) is one he can\u2019t have. So that leaves him with only two options really - join the King\u2019s Guard, or the Night\u2019s Watch. And as someone who seeks to honor the Stark way of doing things, he definitely wasn\u2019t going to go South and become an anointed Knight. The added bonus that the Night\u2019s Watch has over the Kingsguard is that he leaves behind his family and his past. As I mentioned in the Bastard section, this very much appealed to Jon because he could drop the meaning of \u201cSnow\u201d and just be a sworn brother; but it also appealed to Jon because it means he can never take what\u2019s rightfully Robb\u2019s. Once and for all he removed himself \u00a0from the equation and could never be tempted to take Winterfell from Robb, Bran, or Rickon. Of course, it doesn\u2019t quite play out that way, but that isn\u2019t until <i>A Dance With Dragons</i>. That book also really highlights the mental agony Jon\u2019s relationship with Robb causes him; it\u2019s only touched upon in <i>Game</i>, but by the time we get to <i>Dance</i> he\u2019s having nightmares of <i>murdering</i> Robb. </p><p>And as a bastard, Jon also feels neglected and overlooked; these feelings make him resent his family, and he then feels guilt over that resentment. Tyrion tries to bond with him over this:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve dreamt the same kind of dreams\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jon Snow said, horrified \u201cI wouldn\u2019t\u2026 \u201c</p></blockquote><blockquote><p> \u201che must have good reason for packing you off to the Night\u2019s Watch\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d Jon Snow said, his face dark with anger\u2026 \u201cStop it!\u201d the boy screamed. He took a step forward, his hands coiling into fists, close to tears</p></blockquote><p>Jon is so horrified by Tyrion\u2019s dreams of burning his siblings because, in his own way, he does have those dreams. But unlike Tyrion, who embraces his hate, Jon hates the way he feels. That\u2019s plain to see from Jon\u2019s later chapters:</p><blockquote><p>In his mind\u2019s eye he saw Ben Stark lying dead, his blood red on the snow. The thought made him sick. What was he becoming?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon remembered the wish he\u2019d wished in his anger, the vision of Benjen Stark dead in the snow</p></blockquote><p><b>Between Two Worlds</b></p><p>Potentially the most ever-present theme in Jon\u2019s arc is that he doesn\u2019t quite fit anywhere, because he\u2019s between two worlds. A brother of the Night\u2019s Watch, but he can\u2019t let go of his family; a bastard, but castle-born and privileged; a Stark, but a Snow; and the list goes on and on.</p><p>Leaving his family behind and becoming a Brother of the Night\u2019s Watch proves much harder for Jon than he thought it would be; notice that I didn\u2019t include any of the Night\u2019s Watch besides Sam under Jon\u2019s family, even though they\u2019re supposed to be his brothers. </p><p>The first reason he couldn\u2019t fit in with them is because of his snobbishness, mixed with the self-pity of someone born a bastard. Jon had always viewed himself as the victim, which he was among his family, and didn\u2019t even consider how much worse off the rest of lowborn Westeros had it. He was so used to being called a bastard as an insult, that he didn\u2019t realize to the other brothers it was just a fact of life. Donal Noye calls him on this in <i>Jon III</i>:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cNow think on this, boy. None of these others have ever had a master-at-arms until Ser Alliser. Their fathers were farmers and wagonmen and poachers, smiths and miners and oars on a trading galley. What they know of fighting they learned between decks, in the alleys of Oldtown and Lannisport, in wayside brothels and taverns on the kingsroad. They may have clacked a few sticks together before they came here, but I promise you, not one in twenty was ever rich enough to own a real sword.\u201d His look was grim. \u201cSo how do you like the taste of your victories now, Lord Snow?\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Jon hates that Ser Alliser calls him Lord Snow, but the nickname fits. He may be a bastard, but he is definitely a Lord. Jon hates that people look down on him for being a bastard, but he does his fair share of looking down on others; there is a reason he thinks of his mother as a noblewoman, and it\u2019s not because he\u2019s so welcoming of those of lower social standing. Donal Noye goes a long way in helping him shake this mindset, though. But that still doesn\u2019t help Jon fit entirely; while Jon learns that others had it worse than he did, and ends up being close friends with the Brothers he used to bully, he still doesn\u2019t quite belong with them. He was raised in a castle, and is never going to lose that. He doesn\u2019t fit with the Noble born who look down on him for his birth, but he also can\u2019t fit in with the lowborn who lived on the streets or in poverty; in short, he\u2019ll never fit with Pyp or Grenn, but he surely doesn\u2019t fit with Ser Alliser.\u00a0</p><p>Even after Jon becomes friends with his Brothers, he isn\u2019t happy at the wall because he can\u2019t let go of his old life. Jon makes a real effort to forget Winterfell and join the Night\u2019s Watch, and tell himself that the Night\u2019s Watch is his family now:</p><blockquote><p>The grey walls of Winterfell might still haunt his dreams, but Castle Black was his life now, and his brothers were Sam and Grenn and Halder and Pyp and the other cast-outs who wore the black of the Night\u2019s Watch.</p></blockquote><p>But he can\u2019t shake Winterfell. The only reason he reaches out to make friends with Grenn after their fight, is because he is in such a good mood after finding out that Bran was going to live. And before Tyrion leaves the Wall, Jon tells him this:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cTell Robb that I\u2019m going to command the Night\u2019s Watch and keep him safe, so he might as well take up needlework\u2026Bran\u2026\u201d He stopped suddenly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what message to send him. Help him, Tyrion\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Jon is still overwhelmed with thoughts of Bran and Robb and Winterfell. Even after he has officially taken his Night\u2019s Watch oath and sworn away his past, Jon is furious at Lord Commander Mormont for not keeping him informed of Ned\u2019s imprisonment and Robb\u2019s army. Insults to his family make Jon attack a fellow brother of the Night\u2019s Watch (Ser Alliser). And when it really comes time to choose between the Night\u2019s Watch and his family, Jon runs away:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI belong with my brother.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Even though Grenn tells Jon that they are his brothers, he refuses to go back. The only reason he eventually goes with them is because he knows he\u2019ll have to hurt them or worse to get away. I think it\u2019s an overlooked detail that Sam, Pyp, and Grenn don\u2019t actually convince Jon of anything when they repeat their vows; Jon goes back with the intention of running off at a later date, knowing they can\u2019t watch him 24/7. The reason he ends up staying is because Lord Mormont says he will get to go ranging; and ranging means going beyond the Wall, which means searching for Uncle Benjen. So even though he stays with the Night\u2019s Watch instead of joining Robb\u2019s host, it\u2019s only because he wants to find his family.\u00a0</p><p>And even though Jon loves his family, he doesn\u2019t quite feel at home there either. Being a bastard means that he was never truly a Stark, and he knows that he can\u2019t be with them no matter how much the idea pains him. That\u2019s why he has dreams of wandering around Winterfell like he doesn\u2019t belong:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cSometimes I dream about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m walking down this long empty hall. My voice echoes all around, but no one answers, so I walk faster, opening doors, shouting names. I don\u2019t even know who I\u2019m looking for. Most nights it\u2019s my father, but sometimes it\u2019s Robb instead, or my little sister Arya, or my uncle.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Jon is searching for something he can\u2019t find in Winterfell because he never quite felt at home there, which of course is foreshadowing for a very important reveal to come, but also emphasizes the distance he feels from his family:</p><blockquote><p>Your half brothers, a voice inside reminded him. And Lady Stark, who will not welcome you. There was no place for him in Winterfell, no place in King\u2019s Landing either. Even his own mother had not had a place for him</p></blockquote><p>Jon being perpetually trapped between two worlds is so important to his arc because it means he always feels out of place; all of his misfittings lead to a young kid who feels just so alone. Even when he\u2019s surrounded by people he loves, and who love him, he is alone. Jon is dark and broody because he doesn\u2019t feel like he has a family, or anyone; and that is just so sad.\u00a0</p><p><b>The Supernatural</b></p><p>The last key component to Jon\u2019s arc in <i>A Game of Thrones</i> is his connection with the supernatural. He is one of three main characters (the other two being Daenerys and Bran) who\u2019s storyline is so intertwined with the magical elements of GRRM\u2019s world, and especially is connected to the White Walkers.</p><p>Before I get to Jon\u2019s connection to the Others, though, I want to talk about his connection to the Old Gods. I think this connection is going to be extremely important later down the road, especially when Jon is confronted with his true parentage and has to choose who he is. Jon is connected to the Old Gods as soon as the series begins, all the way back in <i>Bran I</i>, when he hears a noise and finds Ghost; of course, that detail becomes especially interesting when we learn in <i>Jon</i> <i>I</i> that Ghost never makes a sound \u2013 so what did Jon hear? It was very clearly something magical that led Jon to Ghost, and speaks to their connection to each other.\u00a0</p><p>And when he takes his oath to join the Night\u2019s Watch, Jon decides to ride out to the Weirwoods beyond the Wall to make his vow in front of the Old Gods; it\u2019s there that Jon first sees the connection between Ghost and the trees:</p><blockquote><p><i>White fur and red eyes</i>, Jon realized, disquieted. <i>Like the trees</i>\u2026\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Ghost is the only direwolf colored so distinctly; whereas Lady, Nymeria, and Summer are all grey with gold eyes, and Shaggydog is black with eyes like wildfire, Ghost is pure white with bright red eyes just like the Weirwoods. While Jon\u2019s connection to the North and Old Gods hasn\u2019t been fully explored in the narrative yet, it seems like very interesting foreshadowing for things to come.</p><p>It\u2019s also important that Ghost is what connects Jon to his plot with the White Walkers; while taking his oath beyond the Wall, Ghost returns to Jon with the hand of a wight. And when the Rangers try to drag the bodies back with horses, the animals refuse to go near; Chett\u2019s dogs also bark like mad and won\u2019t get close to the wights. Ghost is the only one willing to get close to them. Ghost also somehow senses that Mormont is being attacked by the Wights, and scratches at the door until he gets Jon\u2019s attention. It\u2019s still unclear what the connection is, but Ghost\u2019s reaction to the Others hints at something special between them and direwolves, as well as the Starks that are bonded with them.\u00a0<br></p><p>Jon\u2019s supernatural plot doesn\u2019t end with Ghost and the White Walkers, though; he shares the same prophetic dreams that Bran and Rickon have. This is a dream he has shortly before Ned dies in <i>A Game of Thrones</i>:</p><blockquote><p>Last night he had dreamt the Winterfell dream again. He was wandering the empty castle, searching for his father, descending into the crypts. Only this time the dream had gone further than before. In the dark he\u2019d saw that the vaults were opening, one after the other. As the dead kings came stumbling from their cold black graves, Jon had woken in pitch-dark, his heart hammering. Even when Ghost leapt up on the bed to nuzzle at his face, he could not shake his deep sense of terror.</p></blockquote><p>And he also has a dream where he comes face to face with Ned\u2019s corpse. All of these supernatural plots are of course leading to Jon\u2019s death and resurrection, and also his role in the final battle against the White Walkers. The prophetic dreams also connect him to a select few Targaryens who seemed to be able to see some parts of the future. He is magical in both a Stark and Targaryen way, connecting him to all the magical plots of the book and the title of the series.</p><p>As the above analysis shows, <i>A Game of Thrones</i> is more of an introduction to Jon\u2019s character than anything else; GRRM opens many doors and leaves most of Jon\u2019s character arc for his later books, which I can\u2019t wait to write about; for now, though, that\u2019s all I have for Jon\u2019s arc in <i>A Game of Thrones</i>.<br></p>",

He is definitely the character that appears to conform to typical fantasy tropes the most, but hidden within his Action Hero\u2122 exterior, GRRM worked extensively to subvert typical fantasy tropes. And while that doesn\u2019t pay off fully until <i>A Storm of Swords</i> and especially <i>A Dance With Dragons</i>, the foundation is laid for Jon\u2019s full arc to defy fantasy tropes in <i>A Game of Thrones</i>. Instead of conforming to the typical rule of the \u201cput upon\u201d hero, he has to go through his own arc of being humbled, and instead of having a Hero\u2019s Quest\u2122, he\u2019s trapped at the Wall. And while all of GRRM\u2019s work in the first book is relevant to the rest of the books, Jon\u2019s arc in particular is so good at setting up the dominoes of character development that <i>Clash</i>, <i>Storm</i>, and <i>Dance</i> will have so much fun knocking down. I\u2019ll dig into all of this and more below the cut\u2026 .</p>[[MORE]]<p><b>Bastardy</b></p><p>Being a bastard is the defining point of Jon\u2019s character. It colors everything he does; from his relationships with his siblings to his decision to join the Night\u2019s Watch, all of it is defined through the lens of him being a bastard. It\u2019s so important to his arc that it is the first thing we learn about him in his introduction through Bran\u2019s eyes, and his first introduction via his POV:</p><blockquote><p>Bran\u2019s <b>bastard</b> brother Jon Snow moved closer</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>There were times-not many, but a few-when Jon Snow was glad he was a <b>bastard</b></p></blockquote><p>And the first action we see of him in the text is focused on his bastardy:</p><blockquote><p>Even at seven, Bran understood what his brother had done. The count had come right only because Jon had omitted himself. He had included the girls, included even Rickon, the baby, but not the <b>bastard</b> who bore the surname Snow, the name that custom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own.</p></blockquote><p>Being a bastard means Jon has different expectations; while Robb knows he will grow up to be Lord of Winterfell, and Bran knows he will someday be a knight and bannerman to Robb, Jon has no future. He has the freedom to choose what comes next for him, but not a lot of options and no clear way to bring himself honor. Like most young kids, Jon wants to grow up into a hero:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cDaeren Targaryen was only fourteen when he conquered Dorne,\u201d Jon said. The Young Dragon was one of his heroes.</p></blockquote><p>But as a bastard, the only route Jon sees is by joining the Night\u2019s Watch:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI want to serve in the Night\u2019s Watch, Uncle.\u201d He had thought on it long and hard, lying abed at night while his brothers slept around him. Robb would someday inherit Winterfell, Bran and Rickon would be Robb\u2019s bannerman and rule holdfasts in his name. His sisters Arya and Sansa would marry the heirs of other great houses and go south as mistress of castles of their own. But what place could a bastard hope to earn?</p></blockquote><p>One element of the Night\u2019s Watch that appeals especially to Jon is the oath of celibacy. Having lived as a bastard, it\u2019s clearly not something Jon ever wants his kid to suffer:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI will never father a bastard,\u201d he said carefully \u201cNever!\u201d He spat it out like venom</p></blockquote><p>Being able to join an \u201chonorable\u201d group of men proclaimed in the stories as protectors of the Realm, while also being sworn to celibacy, seems perfect to Jon. It\u2019s everything he\u2019s ever wanted. All of this only appeals to him because he was born a bastard; had he been one of Eddard\u2019s trueborn sons, there is no chance he would have taken the Black.\u00a0</p><p>Becoming a member of the Night\u2019s Watch also frees Jon from the thing he hates: his last name, or lack thereof. One of the defining elements of the Night\u2019s Watch is that it is supposed to be free from the classism that marks the rest of Westeros; even a bastard can rise high. While giving up the family name is the hardest part for most castle-born members of the Watch, it\u2019s exactly what Jon wants to do. The Wall is supposed to be the one place where he isn\u2019t just \u201cNed Stark\u2019s bastard\u201d. Of course, that\u2019s not exactly how Jon finds his time at the wall, but I\u2019ll get to that later.</p><p>Besides deciding Jon\u2019s future, his bastardy also affected many of his relationships, especially with Ned and Catelyn. While most of the other Stark children have an idealization of Ned as a perfect and honorable father/Lord, Jon\u2019s existence proves to him that Ned is capable of failure. Opposed to Sansa, Arya, Robb, and Bran unequivocally proclaiming Ned\u2019s innocence after he is accused of treason, Jon hesitates:</p><blockquote><p>Lord Eddard would never dishonor himself\u2026 would he? He fathered a bastard, a small voice whispered inside him. What was the honor in that? And your mother, what of her? He will not even speak her name.</p></blockquote><p>And earlier in <i>A Game of Thrones</i>, Jon thinks of Ned in a similarly negative light:</p><blockquote><p>He wondered who she [his mother] had been, what she had looked like, why his father had left her. Because she was a whore or an adulteress, fool. Something dark and dishonorable, or else why was Lord Eddard too ashamed to speak of her?</p></blockquote><p>The above quote says so much about who Jon is, and how he views himself and his mother. As I\u2019ll get into more later, Jon has a very high opinion of Ned and still views him as a mostly honorable man, so what does that make him and his mother? How bad must his existence be, that not even Ned Stark is willing to face it? Imagine how awful it would feel, to know the world viewed you as your father\u2019s biggest and only mistake, the one blot on his otherwise perfect honor. And that\u2019s how Jon views himself; because he knows that it\u2019s awful to be born a bastard, and that no one should have to live by that surname, so Ned had to have made a mistake in having him.</p><p>And this opinion of himself is only further reinforced by Catelyn Stark. While I\u2019m tempted to go off on a tangent defending Catelyn\u2019s reaction to Jon (and how it was justified and not actually all that bad, mostly), this is a meta about <i>Jon</i>, and how Catelyn made <i>Jon</i> feel. Having a completely logical and divorced from emotion view of your life when you\u2019re fourteen is impossible, and no matter how much Catelyn\u2019s distaste for him can be justified, it doesn\u2019t change that she made him feel utterly unwanted:</p><blockquote><p>Something cold moved in her eyes. \u201cI told you to leave,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want you here.\u201d</p><p>Once that would have sent him running. Once that might even have made him cry.</p></blockquote><p>While Catelyn\u2019s behavior after Bran\u2019s fall is much worse than it typically is, even her previous actions affected Jon:</p><blockquote><p>He was at the door when she called out to him. \u201cJon,\u201d she said. He should have kept going, but <b>she had never called him by his name before</b>.</p></blockquote><p>In the fourteen years of his life, Catelyn had never once called him by his name. This means that she either called him \u201cbastard\u201d, or never even spoke to him at all. This feeling of being unwanted must have been crippling to Jon, especially when he was younger.</p><p><b>Family</b></p><p>All of the themes in Jon\u2019s <i>AGoT</i> arc are incredibly well interconnected, so I\u2019m not near done discussing how his bastardy defines him. It just happens that it also defined the relationships he had with his family; particularly Ned, Arya, and Sansa (also Catelyn if you include her as a member of Jon\u2019s family).</p><p>As I already touched upon earlier, Jon\u2019s relationship with Ned can never be the same as his other children. Jon is always torn between the love he feels for Ned because Ned has been an objectively great father, and the betrayal he feels for the circumstances of his birth. This quote is the epitome of Jon\u2019s relationship to Ned:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cHe would do whatever was right\u201d he said\u2026 ringingly, to make up for his hesitation. \u201cNo matter what\u201d.</p></blockquote><p>Both the hesitation and Jon\u2019s definitive defense of Ned are how he views his father. \u201cto make up for his hesitation\u201d is very important to Jon\u2019s answer, because he does feel an incredible amount of loyalty to Ned and fully embraced him as his father, even though he has built up resentments over being born a bastard. This quote from <i>Jon VIII</i> goes a long way in showing how dedicated to Ned he is:</p><blockquote><p><i>He is not my father</i>. The thought leapt unbidden to Jon\u2019s mind. <i>Lord Eddard Stark is my father. I will not forget him, no matter how many swords they give me</i></p></blockquote><p>Even though Lord Commander Mormont is offering Jon Longclaw, the ancestral sword of House Mormont (a replacement for Ice, which Ned could never give Jon), Jon\u2019s first thought is to remember Ned. The Night\u2019s Watch is based on the principle of abandoning your family and replacing them with your new brothers, but Jon still chooses to remember Ned.</p><p>And even though Jon is quick to point out that he\u2019s a Snow, not a Stark, when Tyrion says he looks more like Ned than any of his trueborn sons, Jon is happy:</p><blockquote><p>He was pleased by the dwarf\u2019s comment, but he tried not to let it show</p></blockquote><p>When it comes time to take his Night\u2019s Watch vows, Jon decides to take his in the Godswood beyond the Wall instead of inside the Sept:</p><blockquote><p>The gods of the sept had nothing to do with him; the blood of the First Men flowed in the veins of the Starks</p></blockquote><p>Even though Jon often corrects his own inner monologue over his thoughts of being a Stark (for reasons I\u2019ll elaborate on later), his natural instinct is to include himself among them, chiefly because of his admiration for Ned.</p><p>After word gets to the Wall that Ned has been accused of treason and imprisoned, Jon risks his own future to defend Ned\u2019s honor against the taunts of Ser Alliser Thorne:</p><blockquote><p>In the blink of an eye, Jon had vaulted onto the table, dagger in his hand. Pyp made a grab for him, but he wrenched his leg away, and then he was sprinting down the table and kicking the bowl from Ser Alliser\u2019s hand.</p></blockquote><p>And when Jon is riding off to join Robb\u2019s war, his goal is to be recognized as one of Ned\u2019s trueborn sons:</p><blockquote><p>Let them say Eddard Stark had fathered four sons, not three</p></blockquote><p>But even though Jon loves Ned and has a very strong sense of loyalty towards him, he still has a huge amount of built up resentment because of his bastard birth, and the secret identity of his mother. Initially, Jon uses the disappointment of the Night\u2019s Watch as an excuse for why he feels negatively towards Ned, because Ned allowed (also, technically forced him to go, because even though Jon was keen on joining, once Ned decided to go South, Jon had to go North) him to go without properly explaining what the reality was:</p><blockquote><p>No one had told him the Night\u2019s Watch would be like this</p></blockquote><p>But the more he grows accustomed to his place as a Sworn Brother, the more his true grievances with Ned come to the forefront. When confronted with Ned\u2019s potential treason, a part of Jon can\u2019t defend his father:</p><blockquote><p>Lord Eddard would never dishonor himself\u2026 would he?</p></blockquote><p>The idea that Ned could sleep with Jon\u2019s mother and then completely abandon her, and even refuse to speak her name, seems like an incredible injustice to Jon (which it would be if it were true) and is impossible to square with the Ned he grew up with. How can someone you love and trust so much, who has always been a great father, have hurt someone so much?</p><p>This brings us to another very important family member of Jon\u2019s: Lyanna. While Jon doesn\u2019t know she\u2019s his mother, and that\u2019s very important to how she affects his life, GRRM does lay one or two hints through Jon\u2019s intuition that Lyanna is his mother:</p><blockquote><p>He knew nothing of his mother; Eddard Stark would not talk of her. Yet he dreamed of her at times, so often that he could almost see her face. In his dreams, she was beautiful, and highborn, and her eyes were kind</p></blockquote><p>Beautiful and highborn with kind eyes sounds very much like Lyanna. This quote also shows just how constant Jon\u2019s thoughts of his mother are; he dreams of her often enough to have an idea of what she looked like. Yet even though he dreams of her as beautiful and highborn, another part of him believes something much worse about her:</p><blockquote><p>The thought of her made him sad. He wondered who she had been, what she had looked like, why his father had left her. Because she was a whore or an adulteress, fool. Something dark and dishonorable, or else why was Lord Eddard too ashamed to speak of her?</p></blockquote><p>Since he was born a bastard and Ned refuses to speak of his mother, Jon finds himself in a position where the more positively he thinks of Ned, the worse he has to view his mother; her being \u201cdark and dishonorable\u201d lends moral justification to Ned\u2019s decision. But what young kid wants to view their mother as something to be ashamed of? Thinking more highly of his mother puts him right back in the position of hating Ned, though; if she was beautiful and highborn, why did Ned abandon her in shame? Of course we as the audience can see how his mother being Lyanna explains everything, but for Jon this is the paradox of his life. Trying to love both his mother and father while not feeling resentment toward one of them is impossible for him, no matter how hard he tries.</p><p>The next important relationship Jon has with a family member is Arya. She is the closest sibling Jon has, and he misses her more than anyone once he leaves for the Wall:</p><blockquote><p>And Arya\u2026 he missed her even more than Robb, skinny little thing that she was, all scraped knees and tangled hair and torn clothes, so fierce and willful. Arya never seemed to fit, no more than he had</p></blockquote><p>That\u2019s the root of their bond, that both feel like outsiders within Winterfell. Arya\u2019s the only other Stark child who has the brown hair and grey eyes, and just as Jon can never really be \u201cone of them\u201d among Robb, Bran, and Rickon, Arya has never fit in with Sansa, Jeyne, and Beth. Jon\u2019s relationship with Arya also allows us a window into who he really is as a person; before he\u2019s surrounded by strangers or burdened with grief. Unlike fandom perception of him, Jon isn\u2019t even that broody in the first bit of <i>AGoT</i>:</p><blockquote><p>Jon looked her over with all his fourteen-year-old wisdom. \u201cYou\u2019re too skinny,\u201d he said. He took her arm to feel her muscle. Then he sighed and shook his head. \u201cI doubt you could even lift a longsword, little sister, never mind swing one.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>The two of them clearly have an established banter, and Jon enjoys teasing her and calling her \u201clittle sister\u201d. His habit of mussing her hair is also a sign of how close their relationship is. What makes the above quote even cuter, is Jon\u2019s follow through; Jon\u2019s observation that Arya couldn\u2019t lift a longsword is correct, so he goes out of his way to make her a sword she can:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cSo are you,\u201d Jon told her. \u201cI had Mikken make this special. The bravos use swords like this in Pentos and Myr and the other Free Cities. It won\u2019t hack a man\u2019s head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you\u2019re fast enough.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>And the best part is that Jon didn\u2019t make her a smaller version of a Longsword that would functionally be just for show; he clearly spent time discussing with Mikken what kind of small sword would actually be effective, and settled on a Braavosi\u2019s blade for Arya. And the memory of her excitement is one of Jon\u2019s favorite: </p><blockquote><p>The memory of her laughter warmed him on the long ride north.</p></blockquote><p>Arya\u2019s discomfort with typically feminine activities, and her rebellion against societal standards, also helps explain some of Jon\u2019s more forward thinking ideas. While a lot of his progressive ideology comes from his own status as a bastard, it would be wrong to overlook the influence Arya has had on the way Jon views women. While it isn\u2019t a concept that is explored too much in <i>AGoT</i>, Jon\u2019s perception of women is crucial to his <i>ACoK</i>, <i>ASoS</i>, and <i>ADWD</i> arcs. Being exposed to Arya\u2019s tomboyishness helps prepare Jon for the Wildling Spearwives, and especially his relationship with Ygritte. </p><p>As well as Jon giving Arya Needle, there is plenty of other signs that they\u2019re very close:</p><blockquote><p>She set it aside almost shyly and showered him with kisses</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon messed up her hair. \u201cI will miss you, little sister.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Arya glanced behind her, saw Jon, and jumped to her feet. She threw her skinny arms tight around his neck</p></blockquote><p><i>Arya I</i> and <i>Jon II</i> are the only chapters we actually see them interact, but both chapters are full of quotes showing how close the two are. I already mentioned it above, but I love the way Jon calls her \u201clittle sister\u201d and messes with her hair; its a great choice by GRRM, because it immediately conveys so much love and affection between them. In a short number of pages he completely sells you on the sibling bond between Jon and Arya. While the payoff isn\u2019t in <i>AGoT</i>, that bond is extremely important once Jon is Lord Commander in <i>ADwD</i>. </p><p>For all the closeness Jon shares with Arya, he has almost none of the same memories with Sansa. She is the only one of his siblings who overtly treats him like a bastard, and not part of their family proper. While this clearly comes from her close bond with her mother Catelyn, it\u2019s interesting to see how this treatment affected Jon. I\u2019d like to set the record straight on just how much Jon and Sansa disliked each other. Fandom perception paints it as if Sansa endlessly bullied him and they hated each other - that is very much <b>NOT</b> the case. Sansa\u2019s relationship with Jon is so interesting because it isn\u2019t like his with Arya, where she sees him as an equal, or with Robb, where they mostly get along well but Robb\u2019s existence is a reminder of everything Jon can\u2019t have, or even Jon\u2019s relationship with Catelyn, which is obviously venomous. His relationship with Sansa is so unique because they were completely cordial, but both of them were always aware of the other\u2019s status. The worst thing Sansa ever did to Jon was call him \u201cbastard\u201d - and that\u2019s all it took to hurt Jon. It really bothers me that fandom distorts this dynamic so much, because it is a much more interesting exploration of human nature the way GRRM wrote it. </p><p>Another important familial relationship Jon develops in <i>AGoT</i> is his brotherly bond with Samwell Tarly. Jon\u2019s relationship with Sam offers him something unique that he never had with his other brothers - the chance to be the superior. Whereas Jon was always in the shadow of Robb, who\u2019s mere presence made Jon feel inferior, Sam gives Jon a chance to take Robb\u2019s place as the leader. He can council and teach Sam about things without the cloud that hung over him and Robb\u2019s relationship. He gets to be a leader around Sam, in a way that he always was one step below Robb. </p><p>Jon\u2019s friendship with Sam is also another relationship that helps him move passed Westeros\u2019 more bigoted beliefs. When Jon first stands up for Sam, he does so out of a belief that no one should be bullied, but still judges Sam about as harshly as the rest of them do - going so far as to call Sam a coward to his face. But he is the only one to hear Sam out and understand how and why Sam is the way he is. And after he hears Sam\u2019s story, he goes out of his way to protect him from Ser Alliser. Once Jon has made the decision to be Sam\u2019s protector, he slowly comes around to seeing Sam\u2019s value, and ends up putting himself on the line and creating enemies to save Sam from being bullied by Alliser after Jon is made a Steward. His appeal to Maester Aemon shows just how much Jon has thought about Sam\u2019s gifts; he sees the importance of reading, writing, and being as smart as Sam is. </p><p>Getting back to the idea that all of Jon\u2019s narrative themes are extremely interconnected, notice the pattern in many of Jon\u2019s relationships - he is always siding with the underdog. His bastard status makes him feel as if he belongs with the misfits, and he tends \u00a0to seek the companionship of people who don\u2019t quite fit in because he understands the particular way in which they feel left out. </p><p><b>Guilt</b></p><p>Guilt is all over Jon\u2019s arc: Ned\u2019s guilt, both over how Lyanna died and lying to Jon and Catelyn, and Jon\u2019s guilt about everything. </p><p>Because Jon is a bastard, almost all of his desires come with the sting of guilt. I didn\u2019t discuss his relationship with Robb under Family because I think that relationship, sadly, fits better under the theme of guilt. However much Jon holds resentment and hostility for Robb over him being the heir, is outweighed twice over by how much guilt Jon feels over those same feelings. This passage sums it up quite well:</p><blockquote><p>When Jon had been Bran\u2019s age, he had dreamed of doing great deeds, as boys always did. The details of his feats changed with every dreaming, but quite often he imagined saving his father\u2019s life. Afterward Lord Eddard would declare that Jon had proven himself a true Stark, and place Ice in his hand\u2026 What kind of man stole his own brother\u2019s birthright?</p></blockquote><p>Jon is having the same fantasies all young kids do, of being a hero and having his father accept him as his own. But the thought is spoiled by the fact that him having Ice means that he stole it from Robb. If Jon is acknowledged as Ned\u2019s trueborn son, he has to take the title of firstborn from Robb. How hard must it have been for Jon to balance wanting to feel loved and like he belonged, with the feeling that he was taking something from his brothers and sisters? Catelyn consistenly reinforcing the idea that he could steal Robb\u2019s birthright must have just added to Jon\u2019s hatred of his own wants. Fandom jokes about \u201cbroody\u201d Jon Snow a lot, but this is some very dark stuff to try and reconcile with as a kid. All Jon wanted was to be a Stark, but if he gets to be one, he has to take the title from his brother. When Jon refuses to be called a Stark, and repeatedly declares himself a Snow - reasserting his bastard birth - it isn\u2019t because he doesn\u2019t want to be a Stark; it\u2019s because he\u2019s distancing himself from any thought that he could ever take Robb\u2019s birthright. </p><p>Jon\u2019s guilt over his relationship with Robb is a huge factor in why he joins the Night\u2019s Watch. As I touched on above, being born a bastard didn\u2019t leave Jon with many options as far as bringing himself honor, and the only honor that he truly wants (to be a Stark) is one he can\u2019t have. So that leaves him with only two options really - join the King\u2019s Guard, or the Night\u2019s Watch. And as someone who seeks to honor the Stark way of doing things, he definitely wasn\u2019t going to go South and become an anointed Knight. The added bonus that the Night\u2019s Watch has over the Kingsguard is that he leaves behind his family and his past. As I mentioned in the Bastard section, this very much appealed to Jon because he could drop the meaning of \u201cSnow\u201d and just be a sworn brother; but it also appealed to Jon because it means he can never take what\u2019s rightfully Robb\u2019s. Once and for all he removed himself \u00a0from the equation and could never be tempted to take Winterfell from Robb, Bran, or Rickon. Of course, it doesn\u2019t quite play out that way, but that isn\u2019t until <i>A Dance With Dragons</i>. That book also really highlights the mental agony Jon\u2019s relationship with Robb causes him; it\u2019s only touched upon in <i>Game</i>, but by the time we get to <i>Dance</i> he\u2019s having nightmares of <i>murdering</i> Robb. </p><p>And as a bastard, Jon also feels neglected and overlooked; these feelings make him resent his family, and he then feels guilt over that resentment. Tyrion tries to bond with him over this:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve dreamt the same kind of dreams\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jon Snow said, horrified \u201cI wouldn\u2019t\u2026 \u201c</p></blockquote><blockquote><p> \u201che must have good reason for packing you off to the Night\u2019s Watch\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d Jon Snow said, his face dark with anger\u2026 \u201cStop it!\u201d the boy screamed. He took a step forward, his hands coiling into fists, close to tears</p></blockquote><p>Jon is so horrified by Tyrion\u2019s dreams of burning his siblings because, in his own way, he does have those dreams. But unlike Tyrion, who embraces his hate, Jon hates the way he feels. That\u2019s plain to see from Jon\u2019s later chapters:</p><blockquote><p>In his mind\u2019s eye he saw Ben Stark lying dead, his blood red on the snow. The thought made him sick. What was he becoming?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon remembered the wish he\u2019d wished in his anger, the vision of Benjen Stark dead in the snow</p></blockquote><p><b>Between Two Worlds</b></p><p>Potentially the most ever-present theme in Jon\u2019s arc is that he doesn\u2019t quite fit anywhere, because he\u2019s between two worlds. A brother of the Night\u2019s Watch, but he can\u2019t let go of his family; a bastard, but castle-born and privileged; a Stark, but a Snow; and the list goes on and on.</p><p>Leaving his family behind and becoming a Brother of the Night\u2019s Watch proves much harder for Jon than he thought it would be; notice that I didn\u2019t include any of the Night\u2019s Watch besides Sam under Jon\u2019s family, even though they\u2019re supposed to be his brothers. </p><p>The first reason he couldn\u2019t fit in with them is because of his snobbishness, mixed with the self-pity of someone born a bastard. Jon had always viewed himself as the victim, which he was among his family, and didn\u2019t even consider how much worse off the rest of lowborn Westeros had it. He was so used to being called a bastard as an insult, that he didn\u2019t realize to the other brothers it was just a fact of life. Donal Noye calls him on this in <i>Jon III</i>:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cNow think on this, boy. None of these others have ever had a master-at-arms until Ser Alliser. Their fathers were farmers and wagonmen and poachers, smiths and miners and oars on a trading galley. What they know of fighting they learned between decks, in the alleys of Oldtown and Lannisport, in wayside brothels and taverns on the kingsroad. They may have clacked a few sticks together before they came here, but I promise you, not one in twenty was ever rich enough to own a real sword.\u201d His look was grim. \u201cSo how do you like the taste of your victories now, Lord Snow?\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Jon hates that Ser Alliser calls him Lord Snow, but the nickname fits. He may be a bastard, but he is definitely a Lord. Jon hates that people look down on him for being a bastard, but he does his fair share of looking down on others; there is a reason he thinks of his mother as a noblewoman, and it\u2019s not because he\u2019s so welcoming of those of lower social standing. Donal Noye goes a long way in helping him shake this mindset, though. But that still doesn\u2019t help Jon fit entirely; while Jon learns that others had it worse than he did, and ends up being close friends with the Brothers he used to bully, he still doesn\u2019t quite belong with them. He was raised in a castle, and is never going to lose that. He doesn\u2019t fit with the Noble born who look down on him for his birth, but he also can\u2019t fit in with the lowborn who lived on the streets or in poverty; in short, he\u2019ll never fit with Pyp or Grenn, but he surely doesn\u2019t fit with Ser Alliser.\u00a0</p><p>Even after Jon becomes friends with his Brothers, he isn\u2019t happy at the wall because he can\u2019t let go of his old life. Jon makes a real effort to forget Winterfell and join the Night\u2019s Watch, and tell himself that the Night\u2019s Watch is his family now:</p><blockquote><p>The grey walls of Winterfell might still haunt his dreams, but Castle Black was his life now, and his brothers were Sam and Grenn and Halder and Pyp and the other cast-outs who wore the black of the Night\u2019s Watch.</p></blockquote><p>But he can\u2019t shake Winterfell. The only reason he reaches out to make friends with Grenn after their fight, is because he is in such a good mood after finding out that Bran was going to live. And before Tyrion leaves the Wall, Jon tells him this:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cTell Robb that I\u2019m going to command the Night\u2019s Watch and keep him safe, so he might as well take up needlework\u2026Bran\u2026\u201d He stopped suddenly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what message to send him. Help him, Tyrion\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Jon is still overwhelmed with thoughts of Bran and Robb and Winterfell. Even after he has officially taken his Night\u2019s Watch oath and sworn away his past, Jon is furious at Lord Commander Mormont for not keeping him informed of Ned\u2019s imprisonment and Robb\u2019s army. Insults to his family make Jon attack a fellow brother of the Night\u2019s Watch (Ser Alliser). And when it really comes time to choose between the Night\u2019s Watch and his family, Jon runs away:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI belong with my brother.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Even though Grenn tells Jon that they are his brothers, he refuses to go back. The only reason he eventually goes with them is because he knows he\u2019ll have to hurt them or worse to get away. I think it\u2019s an overlooked detail that Sam, Pyp, and Grenn don\u2019t actually convince Jon of anything when they repeat their vows; Jon goes back with the intention of running off at a later date, knowing they can\u2019t watch him 24/7. The reason he ends up staying is because Lord Mormont says he will get to go ranging; and ranging means going beyond the Wall, which means searching for Uncle Benjen. So even though he stays with the Night\u2019s Watch instead of joining Robb\u2019s host, it\u2019s only because he wants to find his family.\u00a0</p><p>And even though Jon loves his family, he doesn\u2019t quite feel at home there either. Being a bastard means that he was never truly a Stark, and he knows that he can\u2019t be with them no matter how much the idea pains him. That\u2019s why he has dreams of wandering around Winterfell like he doesn\u2019t belong:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cSometimes I dream about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m walking down this long empty hall. My voice echoes all around, but no one answers, so I walk faster, opening doors, shouting names. I don\u2019t even know who I\u2019m looking for. Most nights it\u2019s my father, but sometimes it\u2019s Robb instead, or my little sister Arya, or my uncle.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Jon is searching for something he can\u2019t find in Winterfell because he never quite felt at home there, which of course is foreshadowing for a very important reveal to come, but also emphasizes the distance he feels from his family:</p><blockquote><p>Your half brothers, a voice inside reminded him. And Lady Stark, who will not welcome you. There was no place for him in Winterfell, no place in King\u2019s Landing either. Even his own mother had not had a place for him</p></blockquote><p>Jon being perpetually trapped between two worlds is so important to his arc because it means he always feels out of place; all of his misfittings lead to a young kid who feels just so alone. Even when he\u2019s surrounded by people he loves, and who love him, he is alone. Jon is dark and broody because he doesn\u2019t feel like he has a family, or anyone; and that is just so sad.\u00a0</p><p><b>The Supernatural</b></p><p>The last key component to Jon\u2019s arc in <i>A Game of Thrones</i> is his connection with the supernatural. He is one of three main characters (the other two being Daenerys and Bran) who\u2019s storyline is so intertwined with the magical elements of GRRM\u2019s world, and especially is connected to the White Walkers.</p><p>Before I get to Jon\u2019s connection to the Others, though, I want to talk about his connection to the Old Gods. I think this connection is going to be extremely important later down the road, especially when Jon is confronted with his true parentage and has to choose who he is. Jon is connected to the Old Gods as soon as the series begins, all the way back in <i>Bran I</i>, when he hears a noise and finds Ghost; of course, that detail becomes especially interesting when we learn in <i>Jon</i> <i>I</i> that Ghost never makes a sound \u2013 so what did Jon hear? It was very clearly something magical that led Jon to Ghost, and speaks to their connection to each other.\u00a0</p><p>And when he takes his oath to join the Night\u2019s Watch, Jon decides to ride out to the Weirwoods beyond the Wall to make his vow in front of the Old Gods; it\u2019s there that Jon first sees the connection between Ghost and the trees:</p><blockquote><p><i>White fur and red eyes</i>, Jon realized, disquieted. <i>Like the trees</i>\u2026\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Ghost is the only direwolf colored so distinctly; whereas Lady, Nymeria, and Summer are all grey with gold eyes, and Shaggydog is black with eyes like wildfire, Ghost is pure white with bright red eyes just like the Weirwoods. While Jon\u2019s connection to the North and Old Gods hasn\u2019t been fully explored in the narrative yet, it seems like very interesting foreshadowing for things to come.</p><p>It\u2019s also important that Ghost is what connects Jon to his plot with the White Walkers; while taking his oath beyond the Wall, Ghost returns to Jon with the hand of a wight. And when the Rangers try to drag the bodies back with horses, the animals refuse to go near; Chett\u2019s dogs also bark like mad and won\u2019t get close to the wights. Ghost is the only one willing to get close to them. Ghost also somehow senses that Mormont is being attacked by the Wights, and scratches at the door until he gets Jon\u2019s attention. It\u2019s still unclear what the connection is, but Ghost\u2019s reaction to the Others hints at something special between them and direwolves, as well as the Starks that are bonded with them.\u00a0<br></p><p>Jon\u2019s supernatural plot doesn\u2019t end with Ghost and the White Walkers, though; he shares the same prophetic dreams that Bran and Rickon have. This is a dream he has shortly before Ned dies in <i>A Game of Thrones</i>:</p><blockquote><p>Last night he had dreamt the Winterfell dream again. He was wandering the empty castle, searching for his father, descending into the crypts. Only this time the dream had gone further than before. In the dark he\u2019d saw that the vaults were opening, one after the other. As the dead kings came stumbling from their cold black graves, Jon had woken in pitch-dark, his heart hammering. Even when Ghost leapt up on the bed to nuzzle at his face, he could not shake his deep sense of terror.</p></blockquote><p>And he also has a dream where he comes face to face with Ned\u2019s corpse. All of these supernatural plots are of course leading to Jon\u2019s death and resurrection, and also his role in the final battle against the White Walkers. The prophetic dreams also connect him to a select few Targaryens who seemed to be able to see some parts of the future. He is magical in both a Stark and Targaryen way, connecting him to all the magical plots of the book and the title of the series.</p><p>As the above analysis shows, <i>A Game of Thrones</i> is more of an introduction to Jon\u2019s character than anything else; GRRM opens many doors and leaves most of Jon\u2019s character arc for his later books, which I can\u2019t wait to write about; for now, though, that\u2019s all I have for Jon\u2019s arc in <i>A Game of Thrones</i>.<br></p>",
                "content": "<p>A lot is missed in all of Jon&rsquo;s arcs in <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i>, due to him being a traditional lead hero, so many miss the nuance in his arc. He is definitely the character that appears to conform to typical fantasy tropes the most, but hidden within his Action Hero&trade; exterior, GRRM worked extensively to subvert typical fantasy tropes. And while that doesn&rsquo;t pay off fully until <i>A Storm of Swords</i> and especially <i>A Dance With Dragons</i>, the foundation is laid for Jon&rsquo;s full arc to defy fantasy tropes in <i>A Game of Thrones</i>. Instead of conforming to the typical rule of the &ldquo;put upon&rdquo; hero, he has to go through his own arc of being humbled, and instead of having a Hero&rsquo;s Quest&trade;, he&rsquo;s trapped at the Wall. And while all of GRRM&rsquo;s work in the first book is relevant to the rest of the books, Jon&rsquo;s arc in particular is so good at setting up the dominoes of character development that <i>Clash</i>, <i>Storm</i>, and <i>Dance</i> will have so much fun knocking down. I&rsquo;ll dig into all of this and more below the cut&hellip; .</p><p><b>Bastardy</b></p><p>Being a bastard is the defining point of Jon&rsquo;s character. It colors everything he does; from his relationships with his siblings to his decision to join the Night&rsquo;s Watch, all of it is defined through the lens of him being a bastard. It&rsquo;s so important to his arc that it is the first thing we learn about him in his introduction through Bran&rsquo;s eyes, and his first introduction via his POV:</p><blockquote><p>Bran&rsquo;s <b>bastard</b> brother Jon Snow moved closer</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>There were times-not many, but a few-when Jon Snow was glad he was a <b>bastard</b></p></blockquote><p>And the first action we see of him in the text is focused on his bastardy:</p><blockquote><p>Even at seven, Bran understood what his brother had done. The count had come right only because Jon had omitted himself. He had included the girls, included even Rickon, the baby, but not the <b>bastard</b> who bore the surname Snow, the name that custom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own.</p></blockquote><p>Being a bastard means Jon has different expectations; while Robb knows he will grow up to be Lord of Winterfell, and Bran knows he will someday be a knight and bannerman to Robb, Jon has no future. He has the freedom to choose what comes next for him, but not a lot of options and no clear way to bring himself honor. Like most young kids, Jon wants to grow up into a hero:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Daeren Targaryen was only fourteen when he conquered Dorne,&rdquo; Jon said. The Young Dragon was one of his heroes.</p></blockquote><p>But as a bastard, the only route Jon sees is by joining the Night&rsquo;s Watch:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I want to serve in the Night&rsquo;s Watch, Uncle.&rdquo; He had thought on it long and hard, lying abed at night while his brothers slept around him. Robb would someday inherit Winterfell, Bran and Rickon would be Robb&rsquo;s bannerman and rule holdfasts in his name. His sisters Arya and Sansa would marry the heirs of other great houses and go south as mistress of castles of their own. But what place could a bastard hope to earn?</p></blockquote><p>One element of the Night&rsquo;s Watch that appeals especially to Jon is the oath of celibacy. Having lived as a bastard, it&rsquo;s clearly not something Jon ever wants his kid to suffer:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I will never father a bastard,&rdquo; he said carefully &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; He spat it out like venom</p></blockquote><p>Being able to join an &ldquo;honorable&rdquo; group of men proclaimed in the stories as protectors of the Realm, while also being sworn to celibacy, seems perfect to Jon. It&rsquo;s everything he&rsquo;s ever wanted. All of this only appeals to him because he was born a bastard; had he been one of Eddard&rsquo;s trueborn sons, there is no chance he would have taken the Black.&nbsp;</p><p>Becoming a member of the Night&rsquo;s Watch also frees Jon from the thing he hates: his last name, or lack thereof. One of the defining elements of the Night&rsquo;s Watch is that it is supposed to be free from the classism that marks the rest of Westeros; even a bastard can rise high. While giving up the family name is the hardest part for most castle-born members of the Watch, it&rsquo;s exactly what Jon wants to do. The Wall is supposed to be the one place where he isn&rsquo;t just &ldquo;Ned Stark&rsquo;s bastard&rdquo;. Of course, that&rsquo;s not exactly how Jon finds his time at the wall, but I&rsquo;ll get to that later.</p><p>Besides deciding Jon&rsquo;s future, his bastardy also affected many of his relationships, especially with Ned and Catelyn. While most of the other Stark children have an idealization of Ned as a perfect and honorable father/Lord, Jon&rsquo;s existence proves to him that Ned is capable of failure. Opposed to Sansa, Arya, Robb, and Bran unequivocally proclaiming Ned&rsquo;s innocence after he is accused of treason, Jon hesitates:</p><blockquote><p>Lord Eddard would never dishonor himself&hellip; would he? He fathered a bastard, a small voice whispered inside him. What was the honor in that? And your mother, what of her? He will not even speak her name.</p></blockquote><p>And earlier in <i>A Game of Thrones</i>, Jon thinks of Ned in a similarly negative light:</p><blockquote><p>He wondered who she [his mother] had been, what she had looked like, why his father had left her. Because she was a whore or an adulteress, fool. Something dark and dishonorable, or else why was Lord Eddard too ashamed to speak of her?</p></blockquote><p>The above quote says so much about who Jon is, and how he views himself and his mother. As I&rsquo;ll get into more later, Jon has a very high opinion of Ned and still views him as a mostly honorable man, so what does that make him and his mother? How bad must his existence be, that not even Ned Stark is willing to face it? Imagine how awful it would feel, to know the world viewed you as your father&rsquo;s biggest and only mistake, the one blot on his otherwise perfect honor. And that&rsquo;s how Jon views himself; because he knows that it&rsquo;s awful to be born a bastard, and that no one should have to live by that surname, so Ned had to have made a mistake in having him.</p><p>And this opinion of himself is only further reinforced by Catelyn Stark. While I&rsquo;m tempted to go off on a tangent defending Catelyn&rsquo;s reaction to Jon (and how it was justified and not actually all that bad, mostly), this is a meta about <i>Jon</i>, and how Catelyn made <i>Jon</i> feel. Having a completely logical and divorced from emotion view of your life when you&rsquo;re fourteen is impossible, and no matter how much Catelyn&rsquo;s distaste for him can be justified, it doesn&rsquo;t change that she made him feel utterly unwanted:</p><blockquote><p>Something cold moved in her eyes. &ldquo;I told you to leave,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want you here.&rdquo;</p><p>Once that would have sent him running. Once that might even have made him cry.</p></blockquote><p>While Catelyn&rsquo;s behavior after Bran&rsquo;s fall is much worse than it typically is, even her previous actions affected Jon:</p><blockquote><p>He was at the door when she called out to him. &ldquo;Jon,&rdquo; she said. He should have kept going, but <b>she had never called him by his name before</b>.</p></blockquote><p>In the fourteen years of his life, Catelyn had never once called him by his name. This means that she either called him &ldquo;bastard&rdquo;, or never even spoke to him at all. This feeling of being unwanted must have been crippling to Jon, especially when he was younger.</p><p><b>Family</b></p><p>All of the themes in Jon&rsquo;s <i>AGoT</i> arc are incredibly well interconnected, so I&rsquo;m not near done discussing how his bastardy defines him. It just happens that it also defined the relationships he had with his family; particularly Ned, Arya, and Sansa (also Catelyn if you include her as a member of Jon&rsquo;s family).</p><p>As I already touched upon earlier, Jon&rsquo;s relationship with Ned can never be the same as his other children. Jon is always torn between the love he feels for Ned because Ned has been an objectively great father, and the betrayal he feels for the circumstances of his birth. This quote is the epitome of Jon&rsquo;s relationship to Ned:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;He would do whatever was right&rdquo; he said&hellip; ringingly, to make up for his hesitation. &ldquo;No matter what&rdquo;.</p></blockquote><p>Both the hesitation and Jon&rsquo;s definitive defense of Ned are how he views his father. &ldquo;to make up for his hesitation&rdquo; is very important to Jon&rsquo;s answer, because he does feel an incredible amount of loyalty to Ned and fully embraced him as his father, even though he has built up resentments over being born a bastard. This quote from <i>Jon VIII</i> goes a long way in showing how dedicated to Ned he is:</p><blockquote><p><i>He is not my father</i>. The thought leapt unbidden to Jon&rsquo;s mind. <i>Lord Eddard Stark is my father. I will not forget him, no matter how many swords they give me</i></p></blockquote><p>Even though Lord Commander Mormont is offering Jon Longclaw, the ancestral sword of House Mormont (a replacement for Ice, which Ned could never give Jon), Jon&rsquo;s first thought is to remember Ned. The Night&rsquo;s Watch is based on the principle of abandoning your family and replacing them with your new brothers, but Jon still chooses to remember Ned.</p><p>And even though Jon is quick to point out that he&rsquo;s a Snow, not a Stark, when Tyrion says he looks more like Ned than any of his trueborn sons, Jon is happy:</p><blockquote><p>He was pleased by the dwarf&rsquo;s comment, but he tried not to let it show</p></blockquote><p>When it comes time to take his Night&rsquo;s Watch vows, Jon decides to take his in the Godswood beyond the Wall instead of inside the Sept:</p><blockquote><p>The gods of the sept had nothing to do with him; the blood of the First Men flowed in the veins of the Starks</p></blockquote><p>Even though Jon often corrects his own inner monologue over his thoughts of being a Stark (for reasons I&rsquo;ll elaborate on later), his natural instinct is to include himself among them, chiefly because of his admiration for Ned.</p><p>After word gets to the Wall that Ned has been accused of treason and imprisoned, Jon risks his own future to defend Ned&rsquo;s honor against the taunts of Ser Alliser Thorne:</p><blockquote><p>In the blink of an eye, Jon had vaulted onto the table, dagger in his hand. Pyp made a grab for him, but he wrenched his leg away, and then he was sprinting down the table and kicking the bowl from Ser Alliser&rsquo;s hand.</p></blockquote><p>And when Jon is riding off to join Robb&rsquo;s war, his goal is to be recognized as one of Ned&rsquo;s trueborn sons:</p><blockquote><p>Let them say Eddard Stark had fathered four sons, not three</p></blockquote><p>But even though Jon loves Ned and has a very strong sense of loyalty towards him, he still has a huge amount of built up resentment because of his bastard birth, and the secret identity of his mother. Initially, Jon uses the disappointment of the Night&rsquo;s Watch as an excuse for why he feels negatively towards Ned, because Ned allowed (also, technically forced him to go, because even though Jon was keen on joining, once Ned decided to go South, Jon had to go North) him to go without properly explaining what the reality was:</p><blockquote><p>No one had told him the Night&rsquo;s Watch would be like this</p></blockquote><p>But the more he grows accustomed to his place as a Sworn Brother, the more his true grievances with Ned come to the forefront. When confronted with Ned&rsquo;s potential treason, a part of Jon can&rsquo;t defend his father:</p><blockquote><p>Lord Eddard would never dishonor himself&hellip; would he?</p></blockquote><p>The idea that Ned could sleep with Jon&rsquo;s mother and then completely abandon her, and even refuse to speak her name, seems like an incredible injustice to Jon (which it would be if it were true) and is impossible to square with the Ned he grew up with. How can someone you love and trust so much, who has always been a great father, have hurt someone so much?</p><p>This brings us to another very important family member of Jon&rsquo;s: Lyanna. While Jon doesn&rsquo;t know she&rsquo;s his mother, and that&rsquo;s very important to how she affects his life, GRRM does lay one or two hints through Jon&rsquo;s intuition that Lyanna is his mother:</p><blockquote><p>He knew nothing of his mother; Eddard Stark would not talk of her. Yet he dreamed of her at times, so often that he could almost see her face. In his dreams, she was beautiful, and highborn, and her eyes were kind</p></blockquote><p>Beautiful and highborn with kind eyes sounds very much like Lyanna. This quote also shows just how constant Jon&rsquo;s thoughts of his mother are; he dreams of her often enough to have an idea of what she looked like. Yet even though he dreams of her as beautiful and highborn, another part of him believes something much worse about her:</p><blockquote><p>The thought of her made him sad. He wondered who she had been, what she had looked like, why his father had left her. Because she was a whore or an adulteress, fool. Something dark and dishonorable, or else why was Lord Eddard too ashamed to speak of her?</p></blockquote><p>Since he was born a bastard and Ned refuses to speak of his mother, Jon finds himself in a position where the more positively he thinks of Ned, the worse he has to view his mother; her being &ldquo;dark and dishonorable&rdquo; lends moral justification to Ned&rsquo;s decision. But what young kid wants to view their mother as something to be ashamed of? Thinking more highly of his mother puts him right back in the position of hating Ned, though; if she was beautiful and highborn, why did Ned abandon her in shame? Of course we as the audience can see how his mother being Lyanna explains everything, but for Jon this is the paradox of his life. Trying to love both his mother and father while not feeling resentment toward one of them is impossible for him, no matter how hard he tries.</p><p>The next important relationship Jon has with a family member is Arya. She is the closest sibling Jon has, and he misses her more than anyone once he leaves for the Wall:</p><blockquote><p>And Arya&hellip; he missed her even more than Robb, skinny little thing that she was, all scraped knees and tangled hair and torn clothes, so fierce and willful. Arya never seemed to fit, no more than he had</p></blockquote><p>That&rsquo;s the root of their bond, that both feel like outsiders within Winterfell. Arya&rsquo;s the only other Stark child who has the brown hair and grey eyes, and just as Jon can never really be &ldquo;one of them&rdquo; among Robb, Bran, and Rickon, Arya has never fit in with Sansa, Jeyne, and Beth. Jon&rsquo;s relationship with Arya also allows us a window into who he really is as a person; before he&rsquo;s surrounded by strangers or burdened with grief. Unlike fandom perception of him, Jon isn&rsquo;t even that broody in the first bit of <i>AGoT</i>:</p><blockquote><p>Jon looked her over with all his fourteen-year-old wisdom. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too skinny,&rdquo; he said. He took her arm to feel her muscle. Then he sighed and shook his head. &ldquo;I doubt you could even lift a longsword, little sister, never mind swing one.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>The two of them clearly have an established banter, and Jon enjoys teasing her and calling her &ldquo;little sister&rdquo;. His habit of mussing her hair is also a sign of how close their relationship is. What makes the above quote even cuter, is Jon&rsquo;s follow through; Jon&rsquo;s observation that Arya couldn&rsquo;t lift a longsword is correct, so he goes out of his way to make her a sword she can:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;So are you,&rdquo; Jon told her. &ldquo;I had Mikken make this special. The bravos use swords like this in Pentos and Myr and the other Free Cities. It won&rsquo;t hack a man&rsquo;s head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you&rsquo;re fast enough.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>And the best part is that Jon didn&rsquo;t make her a smaller version of a Longsword that would functionally be just for show; he clearly spent time discussing with Mikken what kind of small sword would actually be effective, and settled on a Braavosi&rsquo;s blade for Arya. And the memory of her excitement is one of Jon&rsquo;s favorite: </p><blockquote><p>The memory of her laughter warmed him on the long ride north.</p></blockquote><p>Arya&rsquo;s discomfort with typically feminine activities, and her rebellion against societal standards, also helps explain some of Jon&rsquo;s more forward thinking ideas. While a lot of his progressive ideology comes from his own status as a bastard, it would be wrong to overlook the influence Arya has had on the way Jon views women. While it isn&rsquo;t a concept that is explored too much in <i>AGoT</i>, Jon&rsquo;s perception of women is crucial to his <i>ACoK</i>, <i>ASoS</i>, and <i>ADWD</i> arcs. Being exposed to Arya&rsquo;s tomboyishness helps prepare Jon for the Wildling Spearwives, and especially his relationship with Ygritte. </p><p>As well as Jon giving Arya Needle, there is plenty of other signs that they&rsquo;re very close:</p><blockquote><p>She set it aside almost shyly and showered him with kisses</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon messed up her hair. &ldquo;I will miss you, little sister.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Arya glanced behind her, saw Jon, and jumped to her feet. She threw her skinny arms tight around his neck</p></blockquote><p><i>Arya I</i> and <i>Jon II</i> are the only chapters we actually see them interact, but both chapters are full of quotes showing how close the two are. I already mentioned it above, but I love the way Jon calls her &ldquo;little sister&rdquo; and messes with her hair; its a great choice by GRRM, because it immediately conveys so much love and affection between them. In a short number of pages he completely sells you on the sibling bond between Jon and Arya. While the payoff isn&rsquo;t in <i>AGoT</i>, that bond is extremely important once Jon is Lord Commander in <i>ADwD</i>. </p><p>For all the closeness Jon shares with Arya, he has almost none of the same memories with Sansa. She is the only one of his siblings who overtly treats him like a bastard, and not part of their family proper. While this clearly comes from her close bond with her mother Catelyn, it&rsquo;s interesting to see how this treatment affected Jon. I&rsquo;d like to set the record straight on just how much Jon and Sansa disliked each other. Fandom perception paints it as if Sansa endlessly bullied him and they hated each other - that is very much <b>NOT</b> the case. Sansa&rsquo;s relationship with Jon is so interesting because it isn&rsquo;t like his with Arya, where she sees him as an equal, or with Robb, where they mostly get along well but Robb&rsquo;s existence is a reminder of everything Jon can&rsquo;t have, or even Jon&rsquo;s relationship with Catelyn, which is obviously venomous. His relationship with Sansa is so unique because they were completely cordial, but both of them were always aware of the other&rsquo;s status. The worst thing Sansa ever did to Jon was call him &ldquo;bastard&rdquo; - and that&rsquo;s all it took to hurt Jon. It really bothers me that fandom distorts this dynamic so much, because it is a much more interesting exploration of human nature the way GRRM wrote it. </p><p>Another important familial relationship Jon develops in <i>AGoT</i> is his brotherly bond with Samwell Tarly. Jon&rsquo;s relationship with Sam offers him something unique that he never had with his other brothers - the chance to be the superior. Whereas Jon was always in the shadow of Robb, who&rsquo;s mere presence made Jon feel inferior, Sam gives Jon a chance to take Robb&rsquo;s place as the leader. He can council and teach Sam about things without the cloud that hung over him and Robb&rsquo;s relationship. He gets to be a leader around Sam, in a way that he always was one step below Robb. </p><p>Jon&rsquo;s friendship with Sam is also another relationship that helps him move passed Westeros&rsquo; more bigoted beliefs. When Jon first stands up for Sam, he does so out of a belief that no one should be bullied, but still judges Sam about as harshly as the rest of them do - going so far as to call Sam a coward to his face. But he is the only one to hear Sam out and understand how and why Sam is the way he is. And after he hears Sam&rsquo;s story, he goes out of his way to protect him from Ser Alliser. Once Jon has made the decision to be Sam&rsquo;s protector, he slowly comes around to seeing Sam&rsquo;s value, and ends up putting himself on the line and creating enemies to save Sam from being bullied by Alliser after Jon is made a Steward. His appeal to Maester Aemon shows just how much Jon has thought about Sam&rsquo;s gifts; he sees the importance of reading, writing, and being as smart as Sam is. </p><p>Getting back to the idea that all of Jon&rsquo;s narrative themes are extremely interconnected, notice the pattern in many of Jon&rsquo;s relationships - he is always siding with the underdog. His bastard status makes him feel as if he belongs with the misfits, and he tends &nbsp;to seek the companionship of people who don&rsquo;t quite fit in because he understands the particular way in which they feel left out. </p><p><b>Guilt</b></p><p>Guilt is all over Jon&rsquo;s arc: Ned&rsquo;s guilt, both over how Lyanna died and lying to Jon and Catelyn, and Jon&rsquo;s guilt about everything. </p><p>Because Jon is a bastard, almost all of his desires come with the sting of guilt. I didn&rsquo;t discuss his relationship with Robb under Family because I think that relationship, sadly, fits better under the theme of guilt. However much Jon holds resentment and hostility for Robb over him being the heir, is outweighed twice over by how much guilt Jon feels over those same feelings. This passage sums it up quite well:</p><blockquote><p>When Jon had been Bran&rsquo;s age, he had dreamed of doing great deeds, as boys always did. The details of his feats changed with every dreaming, but quite often he imagined saving his father&rsquo;s life. Afterward Lord Eddard would declare that Jon had proven himself a true Stark, and place Ice in his hand&hellip; What kind of man stole his own brother&rsquo;s birthright?</p></blockquote><p>Jon is having the same fantasies all young kids do, of being a hero and having his father accept him as his own. But the thought is spoiled by the fact that him having Ice means that he stole it from Robb. If Jon is acknowledged as Ned&rsquo;s trueborn son, he has to take the title of firstborn from Robb. How hard must it have been for Jon to balance wanting to feel loved and like he belonged, with the feeling that he was taking something from his brothers and sisters? Catelyn consistenly reinforcing the idea that he could steal Robb&rsquo;s birthright must have just added to Jon&rsquo;s hatred of his own wants. Fandom jokes about &ldquo;broody&rdquo; Jon Snow a lot, but this is some very dark stuff to try and reconcile with as a kid. All Jon wanted was to be a Stark, but if he gets to be one, he has to take the title from his brother. When Jon refuses to be called a Stark, and repeatedly declares himself a Snow - reasserting his bastard birth - it isn&rsquo;t because he doesn&rsquo;t want to be a Stark; it&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s distancing himself from any thought that he could ever take Robb&rsquo;s birthright. </p><p>Jon&rsquo;s guilt over his relationship with Robb is a huge factor in why he joins the Night&rsquo;s Watch. As I touched on above, being born a bastard didn&rsquo;t leave Jon with many options as far as bringing himself honor, and the only honor that he truly wants (to be a Stark) is one he can&rsquo;t have. So that leaves him with only two options really - join the King&rsquo;s Guard, or the Night&rsquo;s Watch. And as someone who seeks to honor the Stark way of doing things, he definitely wasn&rsquo;t going to go South and become an anointed Knight. The added bonus that the Night&rsquo;s Watch has over the Kingsguard is that he leaves behind his family and his past. As I mentioned in the Bastard section, this very much appealed to Jon because he could drop the meaning of &ldquo;Snow&rdquo; and just be a sworn brother; but it also appealed to Jon because it means he can never take what&rsquo;s rightfully Robb&rsquo;s. Once and for all he removed himself &nbsp;from the equation and could never be tempted to take Winterfell from Robb, Bran, or Rickon. Of course, it doesn&rsquo;t quite play out that way, but that isn&rsquo;t until <i>A Dance With Dragons</i>. That book also really highlights the mental agony Jon&rsquo;s relationship with Robb causes him; it&rsquo;s only touched upon in <i>Game</i>, but by the time we get to <i>Dance</i> he&rsquo;s having nightmares of <i>murdering</i> Robb. </p><p>And as a bastard, Jon also feels neglected and overlooked; these feelings make him resent his family, and he then feels guilt over that resentment. Tyrion tries to bond with him over this:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve dreamt the same kind of dreams&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Jon Snow said, horrified &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t&hellip; &ldquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p> &ldquo;he must have good reason for packing you off to the Night&rsquo;s Watch&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stop it,&rdquo; Jon Snow said, his face dark with anger&hellip; &ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; the boy screamed. He took a step forward, his hands coiling into fists, close to tears</p></blockquote><p>Jon is so horrified by Tyrion&rsquo;s dreams of burning his siblings because, in his own way, he does have those dreams. But unlike Tyrion, who embraces his hate, Jon hates the way he feels. That&rsquo;s plain to see from Jon&rsquo;s later chapters:</p><blockquote><p>In his mind&rsquo;s eye he saw Ben Stark lying dead, his blood red on the snow. The thought made him sick. What was he becoming?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon remembered the wish he&rsquo;d wished in his anger, the vision of Benjen Stark dead in the snow</p></blockquote><p><b>Between Two Worlds</b></p><p>Potentially the most ever-present theme in Jon&rsquo;s arc is that he doesn&rsquo;t quite fit anywhere, because he&rsquo;s between two worlds. A brother of the Night&rsquo;s Watch, but he can&rsquo;t let go of his family; a bastard, but castle-born and privileged; a Stark, but a Snow; and the list goes on and on.</p><p>Leaving his family behind and becoming a Brother of the Night&rsquo;s Watch proves much harder for Jon than he thought it would be; notice that I didn&rsquo;t include any of the Night&rsquo;s Watch besides Sam under Jon&rsquo;s family, even though they&rsquo;re supposed to be his brothers. </p><p>The first reason he couldn&rsquo;t fit in with them is because of his snobbishness, mixed with the self-pity of someone born a bastard. Jon had always viewed himself as the victim, which he was among his family, and didn&rsquo;t even consider how much worse off the rest of lowborn Westeros had it. He was so used to being called a bastard as an insult, that he didn&rsquo;t realize to the other brothers it was just a fact of life. Donal Noye calls him on this in <i>Jon III</i>:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Now think on this, boy. None of these others have ever had a master-at-arms until Ser Alliser. Their fathers were farmers and wagonmen and poachers, smiths and miners and oars on a trading galley. What they know of fighting they learned between decks, in the alleys of Oldtown and Lannisport, in wayside brothels and taverns on the kingsroad. They may have clacked a few sticks together before they came here, but I promise you, not one in twenty was ever rich enough to own a real sword.&rdquo; His look was grim. &ldquo;So how do you like the taste of your victories now, Lord Snow?&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Jon hates that Ser Alliser calls him Lord Snow, but the nickname fits. He may be a bastard, but he is definitely a Lord. Jon hates that people look down on him for being a bastard, but he does his fair share of looking down on others; there is a reason he thinks of his mother as a noblewoman, and it&rsquo;s not because he&rsquo;s so welcoming of those of lower social standing. Donal Noye goes a long way in helping him shake this mindset, though. But that still doesn&rsquo;t help Jon fit entirely; while Jon learns that others had it worse than he did, and ends up being close friends with the Brothers he used to bully, he still doesn&rsquo;t quite belong with them. He was raised in a castle, and is never going to lose that. He doesn&rsquo;t fit with the Noble born who look down on him for his birth, but he also can&rsquo;t fit in with the lowborn who lived on the streets or in poverty; in short, he&rsquo;ll never fit with Pyp or Grenn, but he surely doesn&rsquo;t fit with Ser Alliser.&nbsp;</p><p>Even after Jon becomes friends with his Brothers, he isn&rsquo;t happy at the wall because he can&rsquo;t let go of his old life. Jon makes a real effort to forget Winterfell and join the Night&rsquo;s Watch, and tell himself that the Night&rsquo;s Watch is his family now:</p><blockquote><p>The grey walls of Winterfell might still haunt his dreams, but Castle Black was his life now, and his brothers were Sam and Grenn and Halder and Pyp and the other cast-outs who wore the black of the Night&rsquo;s Watch.</p></blockquote><p>But he can&rsquo;t shake Winterfell. The only reason he reaches out to make friends with Grenn after their fight, is because he is in such a good mood after finding out that Bran was going to live. And before Tyrion leaves the Wall, Jon tells him this:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Tell Robb that I&rsquo;m going to command the Night&rsquo;s Watch and keep him safe, so he might as well take up needlework&hellip;Bran&hellip;&rdquo; He stopped suddenly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what message to send him. Help him, Tyrion&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Jon is still overwhelmed with thoughts of Bran and Robb and Winterfell. Even after he has officially taken his Night&rsquo;s Watch oath and sworn away his past, Jon is furious at Lord Commander Mormont for not keeping him informed of Ned&rsquo;s imprisonment and Robb&rsquo;s army. Insults to his family make Jon attack a fellow brother of the Night&rsquo;s Watch (Ser Alliser). And when it really comes time to choose between the Night&rsquo;s Watch and his family, Jon runs away:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I belong with my brother.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Even though Grenn tells Jon that they are his brothers, he refuses to go back. The only reason he eventually goes with them is because he knows he&rsquo;ll have to hurt them or worse to get away. I think it&rsquo;s an overlooked detail that Sam, Pyp, and Grenn don&rsquo;t actually convince Jon of anything when they repeat their vows; Jon goes back with the intention of running off at a later date, knowing they can&rsquo;t watch him 24/7. The reason he ends up staying is because Lord Mormont says he will get to go ranging; and ranging means going beyond the Wall, which means searching for Uncle Benjen. So even though he stays with the Night&rsquo;s Watch instead of joining Robb&rsquo;s host, it&rsquo;s only because he wants to find his family.&nbsp;</p><p>And even though Jon loves his family, he doesn&rsquo;t quite feel at home there either. Being a bastard means that he was never truly a Stark, and he knows that he can&rsquo;t be with them no matter how much the idea pains him. That&rsquo;s why he has dreams of wandering around Winterfell like he doesn&rsquo;t belong:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sometimes I dream about it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m walking down this long empty hall. My voice echoes all around, but no one answers, so I walk faster, opening doors, shouting names. I don&rsquo;t even know who I&rsquo;m looking for. Most nights it&rsquo;s my father, but sometimes it&rsquo;s Robb instead, or my little sister Arya, or my uncle.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Jon is searching for something he can&rsquo;t find in Winterfell because he never quite felt at home there, which of course is foreshadowing for a very important reveal to come, but also emphasizes the distance he feels from his family:</p><blockquote><p>Your half brothers, a voice inside reminded him. And Lady Stark, who will not welcome you. There was no place for him in Winterfell, no place in King&rsquo;s Landing either. Even his own mother had not had a place for him</p></blockquote><p>Jon being perpetually trapped between two worlds is so important to his arc because it means he always feels out of place; all of his misfittings lead to a young kid who feels just so alone. Even when he&rsquo;s surrounded by people he loves, and who love him, he is alone. Jon is dark and broody because he doesn&rsquo;t feel like he has a family, or anyone; and that is just so sad.&nbsp;</p><p><b>The Supernatural</b></p><p>The last key component to Jon&rsquo;s arc in <i>A Game of Thrones</i> is his connection with the supernatural. He is one of three main characters (the other two being Daenerys and Bran) who&rsquo;s storyline is so intertwined with the magical elements of GRRM&rsquo;s world, and especially is connected to the White Walkers.</p><p>Before I get to Jon&rsquo;s connection to the Others, though, I want to talk about his connection to the Old Gods. I think this connection is going to be extremely important later down the road, especially when Jon is confronted with his true parentage and has to choose who he is. Jon is connected to the Old Gods as soon as the series begins, all the way back in <i>Bran I</i>, when he hears a noise and finds Ghost; of course, that detail becomes especially interesting when we learn in <i>Jon</i> <i>I</i> that Ghost never makes a sound &ndash; so what did Jon hear? It was very clearly something magical that led Jon to Ghost, and speaks to their connection to each other.&nbsp;</p><p>And when he takes his oath to join the Night&rsquo;s Watch, Jon decides to ride out to the Weirwoods beyond the Wall to make his vow in front of the Old Gods; it&rsquo;s there that Jon first sees the connection between Ghost and the trees:</p><blockquote><p><i>White fur and red eyes</i>, Jon realized, disquieted. <i>Like the trees</i>&hellip;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Ghost is the only direwolf colored so distinctly; whereas Lady, Nymeria, and Summer are all grey with gold eyes, and Shaggydog is black with eyes like wildfire, Ghost is pure white with bright red eyes just like the Weirwoods. While Jon&rsquo;s connection to the North and Old Gods hasn&rsquo;t been fully explored in the narrative yet, it seems like very interesting foreshadowing for things to come.</p><p>It&rsquo;s also important that Ghost is what connects Jon to his plot with the White Walkers; while taking his oath beyond the Wall, Ghost returns to Jon with the hand of a wight. And when the Rangers try to drag the bodies back with horses, the animals refuse to go near; Chett&rsquo;s dogs also bark like mad and won&rsquo;t get close to the wights. Ghost is the only one willing to get close to them. Ghost also somehow senses that Mormont is being attacked by the Wights, and scratches at the door until he gets Jon&rsquo;s attention. It&rsquo;s still unclear what the connection is, but Ghost&rsquo;s reaction to the Others hints at something special between them and direwolves, as well as the Starks that are bonded with them.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Jon&rsquo;s supernatural plot doesn&rsquo;t end with Ghost and the White Walkers, though; he shares the same prophetic dreams that Bran and Rickon have. This is a dream he has shortly before Ned dies in <i>A Game of Thrones</i>:</p><blockquote><p>Last night he had dreamt the Winterfell dream again. He was wandering the empty castle, searching for his father, descending into the crypts. Only this time the dream had gone further than before. In the dark he&rsquo;d saw that the vaults were opening, one after the other. As the dead kings came stumbling from their cold black graves, Jon had woken in pitch-dark, his heart hammering. Even when Ghost leapt up on the bed to nuzzle at his face, he could not shake his deep sense of terror.</p></blockquote><p>And he also has a dream where he comes face to face with Ned&rsquo;s corpse. All of these supernatural plots are of course leading to Jon&rsquo;s death and resurrection, and also his role in the final battle against the White Walkers. The prophetic dreams also connect him to a select few Targaryens who seemed to be able to see some parts of the future. He is magical in both a Stark and Targaryen way, connecting him to all the magical plots of the book and the title of the series.</p><p>As the above analysis shows, <i>A Game of Thrones</i> is more of an introduction to Jon&rsquo;s character than anything else; GRRM opens many doors and leaves most of Jon&rsquo;s character arc for his later books, which I can&rsquo;t wait to write about; for now, though, that&rsquo;s all I have for Jon&rsquo;s arc in <i>A Game of Thrones</i>.<br /></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>A lot is missed in all of Jon&rsquo;s arcs in <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i>, due to him being a traditional lead hero, so many miss the nuance in his arc. He is definitely the character that appears to conform to typical fantasy tropes the most, but hidden within his Action Hero&trade; exterior, GRRM worked extensively to subvert typical fantasy tropes. And while that doesn&rsquo;t pay off fully until <i>A Storm of Swords</i> and especially <i>A Dance With Dragons</i>, the foundation is laid for Jon&rsquo;s full arc to defy fantasy tropes in <i>A Game of Thrones</i>. Instead of conforming to the typical rule of the &ldquo;put upon&rdquo; hero, he has to go through his own arc of being humbled, and instead of having a Hero&rsquo;s Quest&trade;, he&rsquo;s trapped at the Wall. And while all of GRRM&rsquo;s work in the first book is relevant to the rest of the books, Jon&rsquo;s arc in particular is so good at setting up the dominoes of character development that <i>Clash</i>, <i>Storm</i>, and <i>Dance</i> will have so much fun knocking down. I&rsquo;ll dig into all of this and more below the cut&hellip; .</p>",

I'm a JONSA(jon/sansa) shipper. I'm a firm supporter of \"SHIP AND LET SHIP\" and \"LET'S AGREE TO DISAGREE\"\nI have no problem with people who ship them with others or who are multi shippers. But be warned that I post a lot of Jonsa content. O and I dislike Daenerys Targaryen(can't stand all the burning stuff up and the entitlement) So don't follow if you don't agree.\nMy OTHER favorite shows and otps are Jamestown, Merlin, Grimm, SilverMadi (BlackSails) Klayley (The Originals), Olicity (Arrow), Darvey (Suits) and Kennash(Reign, this ship broke my heart, my headcanon is that he is alive and ends up with her where ever she is)",
