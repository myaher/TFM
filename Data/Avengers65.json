But now that Peter is here,Steve and Tony both feel protective over him. It doesn\u2019t help that Peter hates everyone other than Steve and tony. But as Steve and tony raise Peter, they start to fall for one another.

He\u2019d tried to communicate it nearly a thousand\ndifferent ways. He tried to write it, say it, sing it, draw it, he even\nattempted a game of charades to show peter. It didn\u2019t work. Steve had managed\nto spell out the word <i>something\u2019s</i> <i>not right</i> on a black board with sticky\nnotes. His heart leaped up into his throat in excitement. <i>This will work</i>. He could show tony and tony would fix it. Tony\nalways fixed it. But as Steve began to finish the next word, he slammed his\nfist into it, destroying it.</p><p>\u201cfuck.\u201d Steve swore and ran a hand through his hair. He took\nseveral deep and steadying breaths, he needed to calm down.</p><p>\u201cSteve?\u201d it was Bucky, the only person that knew what was\ngoing on.</p><p>\u201cStick notes nearly worked.\u201d Steve told him and he sighed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d Bucky promised.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Steve asked after noticing how tense Bucky\nwas, how his hands were stuffed in his pockets, how messy his hair was.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I ever told you but I was seeing someone, I\nbroke it off today.\u201d Bucky explained and Steve\u2019s stomach twisted in churned.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure this out Bucky. We\u2019ll make sure that we fix\nthis.\u201d Steve turned back to his sticky notes, starting the process again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to work Steve.\u201d Bucky said and Steve\nsqueezed his eyes shut.</p><p>\u201cIt has to work.\u201d Was all Steve said and continued trying.</p><hr><p>Tony found the house was too empty nowadays. Peter was\nspending a lot of time over at May\u2019s, which left Tony alone. The walls were\ncovered in pictures, photographs which had captured moments where Tony and\nSteve had been happy. It all meant nothing. </p><p>\u201cHow did we get here Steve?\u201d Tony wondered aloud, nothing\nresponded. The house was still and silent. His phone vibrated and when Tony\nchecked it, it was a message from Peter.</p><p><i>Staying at May\u2019s, love\nyou dad.</i></p><p>Tony stared at the message for a long time. It was good\nPeter was spending more time with his aunt, but Tony hated being alone in this\nhouse. He seriously wished they had bought a dog at some point. Tony ran a hand\nthrough his hair and began to clean the house. The hours ticked by as Tony\ncleaned everything. Until it was two in the morning. Tony stared at the time on\nthe microwave and blinked. His mind travelled back to a different time, a\ndifferent place.</p><p><i>\u201cHave you ever been in love?\u201d Steve asked and Tony bit his lip.\u00a0</i><i><br/>\n\u201cPerhaps. I\u2019ve cared deeply for people but the\nway I\u2019ve felt and the way people describe it, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever truly\nfallen in love with someone before.\u201d Tony confessed and Steve stared at him for\na long moment.\u00a0<br/>\n\u201cIs there a reason for that?\u201d Tony rolled out\nanother cookie and nodded.\u00a0<br/>\n\u201cWhen my parents died, I put up a lot of walls.\nI don\u2019t let people in, it\u2019s just easier that way. I tried to let Pepper in and\nwe all saw how that failed. If you don\u2019t let people in, then there\u2019s no one who\ncan walk out.\u201d Tony shrugged and Steve was staring.\u00a0<br/>\n\u201cThat\u2019s a really lonely way to live Tony.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cI\u2019m used to it. But I think that may be why I\nconnected so well with Peter. I can love him unconditionally because I know he\nisn\u2019t going anywhere. You know?\u201d And finally Tony looked up to meet Steve\u2019s\neyes.\u00a0<br/>\n\u201cYou need to let people in Tony.\u201d Steve exhaled,\nthey stared at one another for a long moment. The moment was suddenly far too\ndeep and far too real, so Tony looked down, scooped up a bit of cookie dough\nand popped it into his mouth.\u00a0<br/>\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t eat cookie dough.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cHave you ever had cookie dough Steve?\u201d<br/>\n\u201cNo! I\u2019ve always been told not to eat cookie\ndough and-\u201d Tony sighed heavily.\u00a0<br/>\n\u201cClint failed as a teacher. Trust me and eat\nthis.\u201d And Steve reluctantly did so. Tony watched as Steve\u2019s eyes grew wide and\na grin spread out onto his face.</i>\u00a0</p><p>Tony snapped back to the present and shook his head. Those\ndays were long gone.</p><hr><p>Peter felt a little guilty for staying over at May\u2019s. But he\nand Wade had been doing some English homework and Wade had asked for help with\nchemistry and Peter had just decided it would be easier to spend the night. May\nherself was out at some book club, she said she would be home late.</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t get it.\u201d Wade murmured and it was nearing two\nin the morning.</p><p>\u201cit\u2019s really not that complicated.\u201d Peter told him gently.\nWade simply scowled down at his homework.</p><p>\u201cYou know chemistry has never been my strong suit.\u201d Wade\ngrumbled and Peter chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI think we should call it quits for tonight. It\u2019s getting\nlate.\u201d Peter murmured and Wade nodded.</p><p>\u201cHow are your dads?\u201d Wade asked suddenly and Peter froze. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dads, I haven\u2019t seen them in ages. How are they?\u201d Wade\nasked and Peter looked down at the floor. The only person that really knew what\nwas going on was May. His dads hadn\u2019t told the other avengers yet, so Peter had\ntaken that as a sign to not talk about it. But Steve had moved out and they\nwere still getting divorced. So it was time to let other people know.</p><p>\u201cI thought May would\u2019ve told you.\u201d Peter said quietly.</p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d Wade was oblivious as per usual.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re getting a divorce.\u201d And for once, Wade was\nspeechless.</p><hr><p>\u201cThey\u2019re getting a divorce.\u201d Peter confessed. Wade felt his\neyes widen and his brain exploded. That was impossible. Tony and Steve were the\ndefinition of a long-lasting and happy marriage. They were the epitome of love.\nEveryone dreamed of having a relationship like theirs. They were clearly\nsoulmates. It made no sense.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Peter looked up at the ceiling and Wade\u2019s heart broke\nfor him.</p><p>\u201cSteve cheated with Bucky.\u201d <i>Holy fucking shit</i>. Wade\u2019s jaw fell open and he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cbut he wasn\u2019t. Steve would <i>never</i>!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell he did.\u201d Peter\u2019s voice was sharp, but Wade couldn\u2019t\nstop talking.</p><p>\u201cBut Steve loves Tony. They\u2019re like couple goals. They\u2019re the\nultimate power couple! Your dads have been in love for as long as I can\nremember!\u201d Wade exclaimed and Peter shrugged.</p><p>\u201cmy dads are no longer in love.\u201d </p><p>\u201cthat\u2019s impossible.\u201d Wade was shaking his head and he could\nsee Peter was getting irritated.</p><p>\u201cWell it\u2019s reality now.\u201d Peter snapped and Wade inhaled\nsharply. Out of instinct, he took Peter\u2019s hand. Peter inhaled sharply and\nlooked down at their intertwined fingers.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Wade asked and Peter shook his head.</p><p>\u201cMy life is falling apart.\u201d He whispered and Wade bit his\nlip.</p><p>\u201c<i>Peter</i>\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pity me Wade. I know you\u2019re only being nice to me\nbecause you\u2019re living with my aunt and I know I\u2019m useful with helping you with\nhomework. But can we just stop pretending like you didn\u2019t treat me like crap\nfor years?\u201d Wade inhaled sharply.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not pretending to be nice to you Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me Wade.\u201d Peter sounded exhausted and Wade\u2019s\nstomach performed somersaults.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying. I did treat you like crap, but I-\u201c Wade\nstopped himself from finishing the sentence. He could feel the anger, practically\nradiating off of Peter.</p><p>\u201cYou what? You pitied me? Used me? What was it that you were\ngoing to say?\u201d Peter demanded and Wade squeezed his eyes shut.</p><p>\u201cI missed you Pete.\u201d Peter inhaled sharply and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cno. you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><hr><p>There was no way that Wade had missed Peter. It wasn\u2019t\npossible. And even if it were, it wasn\u2019t allowed. Wade had had no problem\nwalking out of Peter\u2019s life, which had told Peter that Wade didn\u2019t give two shits\nabout him. So he wasn\u2019t allowed to miss Peter.</p><p>\u201cI did miss you Pete-\u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d Peter said sharply and Wade flinched.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realise it until we started hanging out again and-\u201c</p><p>\u201cIs that what this is? Hanging out? Because from where I\u2019m\nstanding, you moved into my aunt\u2019s house and every time I come over you use me.\nYou ask me to help with your homework or you get me to do your chores or-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m just using you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t seem to have a problem doing that when we were\nfriends, why would it bother you now?\u201d Peter didn\u2019t want to fight with Wade. But\nhe couldn\u2019t stop the words from coming out of his mouth. </p><p>\u201cYou done?\u201d Wade asked with raised brows. Peter took a deep\nbreath. He needed to calm down.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not done. What you did was a dick move. We were\nbest friends for twelve years and suddenly it was like none of it mattered!\u201d\nPeter shouted and Wade sighed.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He whispered but Peter didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cYou left because, what, I wasn\u2019t cool enough? Come on Wade,\ntell me <i>your</i> side of the story!\u201d Peter\nhissed, he\u2019d never heard Wade\u2019s side. </p><p>\u201cMy side? Now you\u2019re interested in my feelings?\u201d he\u2019d\nfinally pissed off Wade Wilson. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you have to say for yourself?\u201d Peter demanded and\nWade curled up his fists.</p><p>\u201cI <i>always</i> invited you\nto come and hang out with my friends and i.

Wade Wilson, he\u2019s never wrong, he\u2019s Mr\nperfect, everyone loves him therefore everything he does is right, you\u2019ve never\naccepted responsibility for anything!\u201d Peter shouted.</p><p>\u201cyou\u2019ve become such a brat.\u201d Wade snapped and Peter\u2019s blood\nbegan to boil.</p><p>\u201cMy sincerest apologies that I\u2019m not perfect Wade. But have\nyou had even one bad thing happen to you in the last year?\u201d Peter demanded.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Wade\u2019s voice was sad and serious that it snapped Peter\nout of his rage.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The room was silent and peter no longer knew what to\nsay.</p><p>\u201cI should just go home.\u201d Peter said in the end and Wade\nshook his head.</p><p>\u201cit\u2019s late, your aunt and your dads would literally murder\nme if I let you leave at this hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cyou might murder me if I don\u2019t.\u201d Peter said and Wade\nflinched.</p><p>\u201cI meant what I said, about missing you.\u201d Peter squeezed his\neyes shut.</p><p>\u201cIf you missed me, why didn\u2019t you try to talk to me in the\npast three years?\u201d Peter asked gently.</p><p>\u201cI tried. But you avoided me like I was the plague. So I left\nyou alone.\u201d Wade admitted.</p><p>\u201coh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d And then the room was silent once more.</p><hr><p>After every word, Steve would take a picture. He then\nemailed each picture to himself, Bucky, Nat and Peter. The sticky notes were\nworking. Steve began to put the last of the pieces together when his phone buzzed.</p><p><i>Meeting at the\ncompound. Come ASAP. Also stop sending me weird post it note messages.</i></p><p>The text was from Natasha. Steve shook his head. He would\nfinish the post it note and then he would go. Steve took the picture, sent the\nemails and then left. Something was wrong. he could feel it in his bones. Something\nwas terribly wrong.</p><hr><p>\u201c<i>Tony</i>. You are\nbeing uncharacteristically non-hyper verbal.\u201d Natasha announced and Steve looked\nover at Tony who was lying down. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because he\u2019s already made up his mind.\u201d Steve said before\nhe could stop himself. </p><p>\u201cBoy, you know me so well.\u201d Some of the other avengers\nshared looks. Steve knew they had all taken note that they\u2019d arrived at\ndifferent times, but none had commented on it yet. Steve watched as Tony stood\nup and rubbed the back of his head.</p><p>\u201cActually I\u2019m nursing an electromagnetic headache. That\u2019s\nwhat\u2019s going on, Cap. It\u2019s just pain.\u201d Steve looked down at his hands, Tony was\nangry and steve knew Tony\u2019s pain had nothing to do with a headache. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s discomfort. Who\u2019s putting coffee grounds in the\ndisposal? Am I running a bed and breakfast for a biker gang?\u201d Steve listened to\nTony\u2019s speech about Charles Spencer. He listened as Tony decided he would sign\nthe accords, and the little voice in Steve\u2019s head which had been controlling\nhim ever since that stupid vision, told Steve to go against whatever Tony said.\nBut it would be fine. Because he could get the pictures to Tony and then Tony\nwould know that Steve wasn\u2019t okay. Tony could fix things. Steve could save his\nmarriage.</p>",

He\u2019d tried to communicate it nearly a thousand\ndifferent ways. He tried to write it, say it, sing it, draw it, he even\nattempted a game of charades to show peter. It didn\u2019t work. Steve had managed\nto spell out the word <i>something\u2019s</i> <i>not right</i> on a black board with sticky\nnotes. His heart leaped up into his throat in excitement. <i>This will work</i>. He could show tony and tony would fix it. Tony\nalways fixed it. But as Steve began to finish the next word, he slammed his\nfist into it, destroying it.</p><p>\u201cfuck.\u201d Steve swore and ran a hand through his hair. He took\nseveral deep and steadying breaths, he needed to calm down.</p><p>\u201cSteve?\u201d it was Bucky, the only person that knew what was\ngoing on.</p><p>\u201cStick notes nearly worked.\u201d Steve told him and he sighed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d Bucky promised.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Steve asked after noticing how tense Bucky\nwas, how his hands were stuffed in his pockets, how messy his hair was.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I ever told you but I was seeing someone, I\nbroke it off today.\u201d Bucky explained and Steve\u2019s stomach twisted in churned.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure this out Bucky. We\u2019ll make sure that we fix\nthis.\u201d Steve turned back to his sticky notes, starting the process again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to work Steve.\u201d Bucky said and Steve\nsqueezed his eyes shut.</p><p>\u201cIt has to work.\u201d Was all Steve said and continued trying.</p><hr><p>Tony found the house was too empty nowadays. Peter was\nspending a lot of time over at May\u2019s, which left Tony alone. The walls were\ncovered in pictures, photographs which had captured moments where Tony and\nSteve had been happy. It all meant nothing. </p><p>\u201cHow did we get here Steve?\u201d Tony wondered aloud, nothing\nresponded. The house was still and silent. His phone vibrated and when Tony\nchecked it, it was a message from Peter.</p><p><i>Staying at May\u2019s, love\nyou dad.</i></p><p>Tony stared at the message for a long time. It was good\nPeter was spending more time with his aunt, but Tony hated being alone in this\nhouse. He seriously wished they had bought a dog at some point. Tony ran a hand\nthrough his hair and began to clean the house. The hours ticked by as Tony\ncleaned everything. Until it was two in the morning. Tony stared at the time on\nthe microwave and blinked. His mind travelled back to a different time, a\ndifferent place.</p><p><i>\u201cHave you ever been in love?\u201d Steve asked and Tony bit his lip.\u00a0</i><i><br>\n\u201cPerhaps. I\u2019ve cared deeply for people but the\nway I\u2019ve felt and the way people describe it, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever truly\nfallen in love with someone before.\u201d Tony confessed and Steve stared at him for\na long moment.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cIs there a reason for that?\u201d Tony rolled out\nanother cookie and nodded.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cWhen my parents died, I put up a lot of walls.\nI don\u2019t let people in, it\u2019s just easier that way. I tried to let Pepper in and\nwe all saw how that failed. If you don\u2019t let people in, then there\u2019s no one who\ncan walk out.\u201d Tony shrugged and Steve was staring.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cThat\u2019s a really lonely way to live Tony.\u201d<br>\n\u201cI\u2019m used to it. But I think that may be why I\nconnected so well with Peter. I can love him unconditionally because I know he\nisn\u2019t going anywhere. You know?\u201d And finally Tony looked up to meet Steve\u2019s\neyes.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cYou need to let people in Tony.\u201d Steve exhaled,\nthey stared at one another for a long moment. The moment was suddenly far too\ndeep and far too real, so Tony looked down, scooped up a bit of cookie dough\nand popped it into his mouth.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t eat cookie dough.\u201d<br>\n\u201cHave you ever had cookie dough Steve?\u201d<br>\n\u201cNo! I\u2019ve always been told not to eat cookie\ndough and-\u201d Tony sighed heavily.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cClint failed as a teacher. Trust me and eat\nthis.\u201d And Steve reluctantly did so. Tony watched as Steve\u2019s eyes grew wide and\na grin spread out onto his face.</i>\u00a0</p><p>Tony snapped back to the present and shook his head. Those\ndays were long gone.</p><hr><p>Peter felt a little guilty for staying over at May\u2019s. But he\nand Wade had been doing some English homework and Wade had asked for help with\nchemistry and Peter had just decided it would be easier to spend the night. May\nherself was out at some book club, she said she would be home late.</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t get it.\u201d Wade murmured and it was nearing two\nin the morning.</p><p>\u201cit\u2019s really not that complicated.\u201d Peter told him gently.\nWade simply scowled down at his homework.</p><p>\u201cYou know chemistry has never been my strong suit.\u201d Wade\ngrumbled and Peter chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI think we should call it quits for tonight. It\u2019s getting\nlate.\u201d Peter murmured and Wade nodded.</p><p>\u201cHow are your dads?\u201d Wade asked suddenly and Peter froze. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dads, I haven\u2019t seen them in ages. How are they?\u201d Wade\nasked and Peter looked down at the floor. The only person that really knew what\nwas going on was May. His dads hadn\u2019t told the other avengers yet, so Peter had\ntaken that as a sign to not talk about it. But Steve had moved out and they\nwere still getting divorced. So it was time to let other people know.</p><p>\u201cI thought May would\u2019ve told you.\u201d Peter said quietly.</p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d Wade was oblivious as per usual.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re getting a divorce.\u201d And for once, Wade was\nspeechless.</p><hr><p>\u201cThey\u2019re getting a divorce.\u201d Peter confessed. Wade felt his\neyes widen and his brain exploded. That was impossible. Tony and Steve were the\ndefinition of a long-lasting and happy marriage. They were the epitome of love.\nEveryone dreamed of having a relationship like theirs. They were clearly\nsoulmates. It made no sense.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Peter looked up at the ceiling and Wade\u2019s heart broke\nfor him.</p><p>\u201cSteve cheated with Bucky.\u201d <i>Holy fucking shit</i>. Wade\u2019s jaw fell open and he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cbut he wasn\u2019t. Steve would <i>never</i>!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell he did.\u201d Peter\u2019s voice was sharp, but Wade couldn\u2019t\nstop talking.</p><p>\u201cBut Steve loves Tony. They\u2019re like couple goals. They\u2019re the\nultimate power couple! Your dads have been in love for as long as I can\nremember!\u201d Wade exclaimed and Peter shrugged.</p><p>\u201cmy dads are no longer in love.\u201d </p><p>\u201cthat\u2019s impossible.\u201d Wade was shaking his head and he could\nsee Peter was getting irritated.</p><p>\u201cWell it\u2019s reality now.\u201d Peter snapped and Wade inhaled\nsharply. Out of instinct, he took Peter\u2019s hand. Peter inhaled sharply and\nlooked down at their intertwined fingers.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Wade asked and Peter shook his head.</p><p>\u201cMy life is falling apart.\u201d He whispered and Wade bit his\nlip.</p><p>\u201c<i>Peter</i>\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pity me Wade. I know you\u2019re only being nice to me\nbecause you\u2019re living with my aunt and I know I\u2019m useful with helping you with\nhomework. But can we just stop pretending like you didn\u2019t treat me like crap\nfor years?\u201d Wade inhaled sharply.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not pretending to be nice to you Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me Wade.\u201d Peter sounded exhausted and Wade\u2019s\nstomach performed somersaults.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying. I did treat you like crap, but I-\u201c Wade\nstopped himself from finishing the sentence. He could feel the anger, practically\nradiating off of Peter.</p><p>\u201cYou what? You pitied me? Used me? What was it that you were\ngoing to say?\u201d Peter demanded and Wade squeezed his eyes shut.</p><p>\u201cI missed you Pete.\u201d Peter inhaled sharply and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cno. you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><hr><p>There was no way that Wade had missed Peter. It wasn\u2019t\npossible. And even if it were, it wasn\u2019t allowed. Wade had had no problem\nwalking out of Peter\u2019s life, which had told Peter that Wade didn\u2019t give two shits\nabout him. So he wasn\u2019t allowed to miss Peter.</p><p>\u201cI did miss you Pete-\u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d Peter said sharply and Wade flinched.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realise it until we started hanging out again and-\u201c</p><p>\u201cIs that what this is? Hanging out? Because from where I\u2019m\nstanding, you moved into my aunt\u2019s house and every time I come over you use me.\nYou ask me to help with your homework or you get me to do your chores or-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m just using you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t seem to have a problem doing that when we were\nfriends, why would it bother you now?\u201d Peter didn\u2019t want to fight with Wade. But\nhe couldn\u2019t stop the words from coming out of his mouth. </p><p>\u201cYou done?\u201d Wade asked with raised brows. Peter took a deep\nbreath. He needed to calm down.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not done. What you did was a dick move. We were\nbest friends for twelve years and suddenly it was like none of it mattered!\u201d\nPeter shouted and Wade sighed.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He whispered but Peter didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cYou left because, what, I wasn\u2019t cool enough? Come on Wade,\ntell me <i>your</i> side of the story!\u201d Peter\nhissed, he\u2019d never heard Wade\u2019s side. </p><p>\u201cMy side? Now you\u2019re interested in my feelings?\u201d he\u2019d\nfinally pissed off Wade Wilson. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you have to say for yourself?\u201d Peter demanded and\nWade curled up his fists.</p><p>\u201cI <i>always</i> invited you\nto come and hang out with my friends and i.

But have\nyou had even one bad thing happen to you in the last year?\u201d Peter demanded.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Wade\u2019s voice was sad and serious that it snapped Peter\nout of his rage.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The room was silent and peter no longer knew what to\nsay.</p><p>\u201cI should just go home.\u201d Peter said in the end and Wade\nshook his head.</p><p>\u201cit\u2019s late, your aunt and your dads would literally murder\nme if I let you leave at this hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cyou might murder me if I don\u2019t.\u201d Peter said and Wade\nflinched.</p><p>\u201cI meant what I said, about missing you.\u201d Peter squeezed his\neyes shut.</p><p>\u201cIf you missed me, why didn\u2019t you try to talk to me in the\npast three years?\u201d Peter asked gently.</p><p>\u201cI tried. But you avoided me like I was the plague. So I left\nyou alone.\u201d Wade admitted.</p><p>\u201coh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d And then the room was silent once more.</p><hr><p>After every word, Steve would take a picture. He then\nemailed each picture to himself, Bucky, Nat and Peter. The sticky notes were\nworking. Steve began to put the last of the pieces together when his phone buzzed.</p><p><i>Meeting at the\ncompound. Come ASAP. Also stop sending me weird post it note messages.</i></p><p>The text was from Natasha. Steve shook his head. He would\nfinish the post it note and then he would go. Steve took the picture, sent the\nemails and then left. Something was wrong. he could feel it in his bones. Something\nwas terribly wrong.</p><hr><p>\u201c<i>Tony</i>. You are\nbeing uncharacteristically non-hyper verbal.\u201d Natasha announced and Steve looked\nover at Tony who was lying down. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because he\u2019s already made up his mind.\u201d Steve said before\nhe could stop himself. </p><p>\u201cBoy, you know me so well.\u201d Some of the other avengers\nshared looks. Steve knew they had all taken note that they\u2019d arrived at\ndifferent times, but none had commented on it yet. Steve watched as Tony stood\nup and rubbed the back of his head.</p><p>\u201cActually I\u2019m nursing an electromagnetic headache. That\u2019s\nwhat\u2019s going on, Cap. It\u2019s just pain.\u201d Steve looked down at his hands, Tony was\nangry and steve knew Tony\u2019s pain had nothing to do with a headache. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s discomfort. Who\u2019s putting coffee grounds in the\ndisposal? Am I running a bed and breakfast for a biker gang?\u201d Steve listened to\nTony\u2019s speech about Charles Spencer. He listened as Tony decided he would sign\nthe accords, and the little voice in Steve\u2019s head which had been controlling\nhim ever since that stupid vision, told Steve to go against whatever Tony said.\nBut it would be fine. Because he could get the pictures to Tony and then Tony\nwould know that Steve wasn\u2019t okay. Tony could fix things. Steve could save his\nmarriage.</p>",

But now that Peter is here,Steve and Tony both feel protective over him. It doesn\u2019t help that Peter hates everyone other than Steve and tony.

He\u2019d tried to communicate it nearly a thousand\ndifferent ways. He tried to write it, say it, sing it, draw it, he even\nattempted a game of charades to show peter. It didn\u2019t work. Steve had managed\nto spell out the word <i>something\u2019s</i> <i>not right</i> on a black board with sticky\nnotes. His heart leaped up into his throat in excitement. <i>This will work</i>. He could show tony and tony would fix it. Tony\nalways fixed it. But as Steve began to finish the next word, he slammed his\nfist into it, destroying it.</p><p>\u201cfuck.\u201d Steve swore and ran a hand through his hair. He took\nseveral deep and steadying breaths, he needed to calm down.</p><p>\u201cSteve?\u201d it was Bucky, the only person that knew what was\ngoing on.</p><p>\u201cStick notes nearly worked.\u201d Steve told him and he sighed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d Bucky promised.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Steve asked after noticing how tense Bucky\nwas, how his hands were stuffed in his pockets, how messy his hair was.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I ever told you but I was seeing someone, I\nbroke it off today.\u201d Bucky explained and Steve\u2019s stomach twisted in churned.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure this out Bucky. We\u2019ll make sure that we fix\nthis.\u201d Steve turned back to his sticky notes, starting the process again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to work Steve.\u201d Bucky said and Steve\nsqueezed his eyes shut.</p><p>\u201cIt has to work.\u201d Was all Steve said and continued trying.</p><hr><p>Tony found the house was too empty nowadays. Peter was\nspending a lot of time over at May\u2019s, which left Tony alone. The walls were\ncovered in pictures, photographs which had captured moments where Tony and\nSteve had been happy. It all meant nothing. </p><p>\u201cHow did we get here Steve?\u201d Tony wondered aloud, nothing\nresponded. The house was still and silent. His phone vibrated and when Tony\nchecked it, it was a message from Peter.</p><p><i>Staying at May\u2019s, love\nyou dad.</i></p><p>Tony stared at the message for a long time. It was good\nPeter was spending more time with his aunt, but Tony hated being alone in this\nhouse. He seriously wished they had bought a dog at some point. Tony ran a hand\nthrough his hair and began to clean the house. The hours ticked by as Tony\ncleaned everything. Until it was two in the morning. Tony stared at the time on\nthe microwave and blinked. His mind travelled back to a different time, a\ndifferent place.</p><p><i>\u201cHave you ever been in love?\u201d Steve asked and Tony bit his lip.\u00a0</i><i><br>\n\u201cPerhaps. I\u2019ve cared deeply for people but the\nway I\u2019ve felt and the way people describe it, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever truly\nfallen in love with someone before.\u201d Tony confessed and Steve stared at him for\na long moment.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cIs there a reason for that?\u201d Tony rolled out\nanother cookie and nodded.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cWhen my parents died, I put up a lot of walls.\nI don\u2019t let people in, it\u2019s just easier that way. I tried to let Pepper in and\nwe all saw how that failed. If you don\u2019t let people in, then there\u2019s no one who\ncan walk out.\u201d Tony shrugged and Steve was staring.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cThat\u2019s a really lonely way to live Tony.\u201d<br>\n\u201cI\u2019m used to it. But I think that may be why I\nconnected so well with Peter. I can love him unconditionally because I know he\nisn\u2019t going anywhere. You know?\u201d And finally Tony looked up to meet Steve\u2019s\neyes.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cYou need to let people in Tony.\u201d Steve exhaled,\nthey stared at one another for a long moment. The moment was suddenly far too\ndeep and far too real, so Tony looked down, scooped up a bit of cookie dough\nand popped it into his mouth.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t eat cookie dough.\u201d<br>\n\u201cHave you ever had cookie dough Steve?\u201d<br>\n\u201cNo! I\u2019ve always been told not to eat cookie\ndough and-\u201d Tony sighed heavily.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cClint failed as a teacher. Trust me and eat\nthis.\u201d And Steve reluctantly did so. Tony watched as Steve\u2019s eyes grew wide and\na grin spread out onto his face.</i>\u00a0</p><p>Tony snapped back to the present and shook his head. Those\ndays were long gone.</p><hr><p>Peter felt a little guilty for staying over at May\u2019s. But he\nand Wade had been doing some English homework and Wade had asked for help with\nchemistry and Peter had just decided it would be easier to spend the night. May\nherself was out at some book club, she said she would be home late.</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t get it.\u201d Wade murmured and it was nearing two\nin the morning.</p><p>\u201cit\u2019s really not that complicated.\u201d Peter told him gently.\nWade simply scowled down at his homework.</p><p>\u201cYou know chemistry has never been my strong suit.\u201d Wade\ngrumbled and Peter chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI think we should call it quits for tonight. It\u2019s getting\nlate.\u201d Peter murmured and Wade nodded.</p><p>\u201cHow are your dads?\u201d Wade asked suddenly and Peter froze. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dads, I haven\u2019t seen them in ages. How are they?\u201d Wade\nasked and Peter looked down at the floor. The only person that really knew what\nwas going on was May. His dads hadn\u2019t told the other avengers yet, so Peter had\ntaken that as a sign to not talk about it. But Steve had moved out and they\nwere still getting divorced. So it was time to let other people know.</p><p>\u201cI thought May would\u2019ve told you.\u201d Peter said quietly.</p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d Wade was oblivious as per usual.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re getting a divorce.\u201d And for once, Wade was\nspeechless.</p><hr><p>\u201cThey\u2019re getting a divorce.\u201d Peter confessed. Wade felt his\neyes widen and his brain exploded. That was impossible. Tony and Steve were the\ndefinition of a long-lasting and happy marriage. They were the epitome of love.\nEveryone dreamed of having a relationship like theirs. They were clearly\nsoulmates. It made no sense.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Peter looked up at the ceiling and Wade\u2019s heart broke\nfor him.</p><p>\u201cSteve cheated with Bucky.\u201d <i>Holy fucking shit</i>. Wade\u2019s jaw fell open and he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cbut he wasn\u2019t. Steve would <i>never</i>!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell he did.\u201d Peter\u2019s voice was sharp, but Wade couldn\u2019t\nstop talking.</p><p>\u201cBut Steve loves Tony. They\u2019re like couple goals. They\u2019re the\nultimate power couple! Your dads have been in love for as long as I can\nremember!\u201d Wade exclaimed and Peter shrugged.</p><p>\u201cmy dads are no longer in love.\u201d </p><p>\u201cthat\u2019s impossible.\u201d Wade was shaking his head and he could\nsee Peter was getting irritated.</p><p>\u201cWell it\u2019s reality now.\u201d Peter snapped and Wade inhaled\nsharply. Out of instinct, he took Peter\u2019s hand. Peter inhaled sharply and\nlooked down at their intertwined fingers.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Wade asked and Peter shook his head.</p><p>\u201cMy life is falling apart.\u201d He whispered and Wade bit his\nlip.</p><p>\u201c<i>Peter</i>\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pity me Wade. I know you\u2019re only being nice to me\nbecause you\u2019re living with my aunt and I know I\u2019m useful with helping you with\nhomework. But can we just stop pretending like you didn\u2019t treat me like crap\nfor years?\u201d Wade inhaled sharply.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not pretending to be nice to you Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me Wade.\u201d Peter sounded exhausted and Wade\u2019s\nstomach performed somersaults.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying. I did treat you like crap, but I-\u201c Wade\nstopped himself from finishing the sentence. He could feel the anger, practically\nradiating off of Peter.</p><p>\u201cYou what? You pitied me? Used me? What was it that you were\ngoing to say?\u201d Peter demanded and Wade squeezed his eyes shut.</p><p>\u201cI missed you Pete.\u201d Peter inhaled sharply and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cno. you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><hr><p>There was no way that Wade had missed Peter. It wasn\u2019t\npossible. And even if it were, it wasn\u2019t allowed. Wade had had no problem\nwalking out of Peter\u2019s life, which had told Peter that Wade didn\u2019t give two shits\nabout him. So he wasn\u2019t allowed to miss Peter.</p><p>\u201cI did miss you Pete-\u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d Peter said sharply and Wade flinched.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realise it until we started hanging out again and-\u201c</p><p>\u201cIs that what this is? Hanging out? Because from where I\u2019m\nstanding, you moved into my aunt\u2019s house and every time I come over you use me.\nYou ask me to help with your homework or you get me to do your chores or-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m just using you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t seem to have a problem doing that when we were\nfriends, why would it bother you now?\u201d Peter didn\u2019t want to fight with Wade. But\nhe couldn\u2019t stop the words from coming out of his mouth. </p><p>\u201cYou done?\u201d Wade asked with raised brows. Peter took a deep\nbreath. He needed to calm down.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not done. What you did was a dick move. We were\nbest friends for twelve years and suddenly it was like none of it mattered!\u201d\nPeter shouted and Wade sighed.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He whispered but Peter didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cYou left because, what, I wasn\u2019t cool enough? Come on Wade,\ntell me <i>your</i> side of the story!\u201d Peter\nhissed, he\u2019d never heard Wade\u2019s side. </p><p>\u201cMy side? Now you\u2019re interested in my feelings?\u201d he\u2019d\nfinally pissed off Wade Wilson. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you have to say for yourself?\u201d Peter demanded and\nWade curled up his fists.</p><p>\u201cI <i>always</i> invited you\nto come and hang out with my friends and i. I always tried to include you in\nour jokes, I <i>always</i> told people to\nback off if they started picking on you. <i>you\n</i>rejected <i>me.

He&rsquo;d tried to communicate it nearly a thousand\ndifferent ways. He tried to write it, say it, sing it, draw it, he even\nattempted a game of charades to show peter. It didn&rsquo;t work. Steve had managed\nto spell out the word <i>something&rsquo;s</i> <i>not right</i> on a black board with sticky\nnotes. His heart leaped up into his throat in excitement. <i>This will work</i>. He could show tony and tony would fix it. Tony\nalways fixed it. But as Steve began to finish the next word, he slammed his\nfist into it, destroying it.</p><p>&ldquo;fuck.&rdquo; Steve swore and ran a hand through his hair. He took\nseveral deep and steadying breaths, he needed to calm down.</p><p>&ldquo;Steve?&rdquo; it was Bucky, the only person that knew what was\ngoing on.</p><p>&ldquo;Stick notes nearly worked.&rdquo; Steve told him and he sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll figure something out.&rdquo; Bucky promised.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Steve asked after noticing how tense Bucky\nwas, how his hands were stuffed in his pockets, how messy his hair was.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I ever told you but I was seeing someone, I\nbroke it off today.&rdquo; Bucky explained and Steve&rsquo;s stomach twisted in churned.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll figure this out Bucky. We&rsquo;ll make sure that we fix\nthis.&rdquo; Steve turned back to his sticky notes, starting the process again.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not going to work Steve.&rdquo; Bucky said and Steve\nsqueezed his eyes shut.</p><p>&ldquo;It has to work.&rdquo; Was all Steve said and continued trying.</p><hr /><p>Tony found the house was too empty nowadays. Peter was\nspending a lot of time over at May&rsquo;s, which left Tony alone. The walls were\ncovered in pictures, photographs which had captured moments where Tony and\nSteve had been happy. It all meant nothing. </p><p>&ldquo;How did we get here Steve?&rdquo; Tony wondered aloud, nothing\nresponded. The house was still and silent. His phone vibrated and when Tony\nchecked it, it was a message from Peter.</p><p><i>Staying at May&rsquo;s, love\nyou dad.</i></p><p>Tony stared at the message for a long time. It was good\nPeter was spending more time with his aunt, but Tony hated being alone in this\nhouse. He seriously wished they had bought a dog at some point. Tony ran a hand\nthrough his hair and began to clean the house. The hours ticked by as Tony\ncleaned everything. Until it was two in the morning. Tony stared at the time on\nthe microwave and blinked. His mind travelled back to a different time, a\ndifferent place.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Have you ever been in love?&rdquo; Steve asked and Tony bit his lip.&nbsp;</i><i><br />\n&ldquo;Perhaps. I&rsquo;ve cared deeply for people but the\nway I&rsquo;ve felt and the way people describe it, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever truly\nfallen in love with someone before.&rdquo; Tony confessed and Steve stared at him for\na long moment.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;Is there a reason for that?&rdquo; Tony rolled out\nanother cookie and nodded.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;When my parents died, I put up a lot of walls.\nI don&rsquo;t let people in, it&rsquo;s just easier that way. I tried to let Pepper in and\nwe all saw how that failed. If you don&rsquo;t let people in, then there&rsquo;s no one who\ncan walk out.&rdquo; Tony shrugged and Steve was staring.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a really lonely way to live Tony.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m used to it. But I think that may be why I\nconnected so well with Peter. I can love him unconditionally because I know he\nisn&rsquo;t going anywhere. You know?&rdquo; And finally Tony looked up to meet Steve&rsquo;s\neyes.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;You need to let people in Tony.&rdquo; Steve exhaled,\nthey stared at one another for a long moment. The moment was suddenly far too\ndeep and far too real, so Tony looked down, scooped up a bit of cookie dough\nand popped it into his mouth.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t eat cookie dough.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Have you ever had cookie dough Steve?&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;No! I&rsquo;ve always been told not to eat cookie\ndough and-&rdquo; Tony sighed heavily.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;Clint failed as a teacher. Trust me and eat\nthis.&rdquo; And Steve reluctantly did so. Tony watched as Steve&rsquo;s eyes grew wide and\na grin spread out onto his face.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>Tony snapped back to the present and shook his head. Those\ndays were long gone.</p><hr /><p>Peter felt a little guilty for staying over at May&rsquo;s. But he\nand Wade had been doing some English homework and Wade had asked for help with\nchemistry and Peter had just decided it would be easier to spend the night. May\nherself was out at some book club, she said she would be home late.</p><p>&ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo; Wade murmured and it was nearing two\nin the morning.</p><p>&ldquo;it&rsquo;s really not that complicated.&rdquo; Peter told him gently.\nWade simply scowled down at his homework.</p><p>&ldquo;You know chemistry has never been my strong suit.&rdquo; Wade\ngrumbled and Peter chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;I think we should call it quits for tonight. It&rsquo;s getting\nlate.&rdquo; Peter murmured and Wade nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;How are your dads?&rdquo; Wade asked suddenly and Peter froze. </p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your dads, I haven&rsquo;t seen them in ages. How are they?&rdquo; Wade\nasked and Peter looked down at the floor. The only person that really knew what\nwas going on was May. His dads hadn&rsquo;t told the other avengers yet, so Peter had\ntaken that as a sign to not talk about it. But Steve had moved out and they\nwere still getting divorced. So it was time to let other people know.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought May would&rsquo;ve told you.&rdquo; Peter said quietly.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me what?&rdquo; Wade was oblivious as per usual.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re getting a divorce.&rdquo; And for once, Wade was\nspeechless.</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re getting a divorce.&rdquo; Peter confessed. Wade felt his\neyes widen and his brain exploded. That was impossible. Tony and Steve were the\ndefinition of a long-lasting and happy marriage. They were the epitome of love.\nEveryone dreamed of having a relationship like theirs. They were clearly\nsoulmates. It made no sense.</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Peter looked up at the ceiling and Wade&rsquo;s heart broke\nfor him.</p><p>&ldquo;Steve cheated with Bucky.&rdquo; <i>Holy fucking shit</i>. Wade&rsquo;s jaw fell open and he shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;but he wasn&rsquo;t. Steve would <i>never</i>!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well he did.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s voice was sharp, but Wade couldn&rsquo;t\nstop talking.</p><p>&ldquo;But Steve loves Tony. They&rsquo;re like couple goals. They&rsquo;re the\nultimate power couple! Your dads have been in love for as long as I can\nremember!&rdquo; Wade exclaimed and Peter shrugged.</p><p>&ldquo;my dads are no longer in love.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;that&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo; Wade was shaking his head and he could\nsee Peter was getting irritated.</p><p>&ldquo;Well it&rsquo;s reality now.&rdquo; Peter snapped and Wade inhaled\nsharply. Out of instinct, he took Peter&rsquo;s hand. Peter inhaled sharply and\nlooked down at their intertwined fingers.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; Wade asked and Peter shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;My life is falling apart.&rdquo; He whispered and Wade bit his\nlip.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Peter</i>&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pity me Wade. I know you&rsquo;re only being nice to me\nbecause you&rsquo;re living with my aunt and I know I&rsquo;m useful with helping you with\nhomework. But can we just stop pretending like you didn&rsquo;t treat me like crap\nfor years?&rdquo; Wade inhaled sharply.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not pretending to be nice to you Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lie to me Wade.&rdquo; Peter sounded exhausted and Wade&rsquo;s\nstomach performed somersaults.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not lying. I did treat you like crap, but I-&ldquo; Wade\nstopped himself from finishing the sentence. He could feel the anger, practically\nradiating off of Peter.</p><p>&ldquo;You what? You pitied me? Used me? What was it that you were\ngoing to say?&rdquo; Peter demanded and Wade squeezed his eyes shut.</p><p>&ldquo;I missed you Pete.&rdquo; Peter inhaled sharply and shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;no. you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>There was no way that Wade had missed Peter. It wasn&rsquo;t\npossible. And even if it were, it wasn&rsquo;t allowed. Wade had had no problem\nwalking out of Peter&rsquo;s life, which had told Peter that Wade didn&rsquo;t give two shits\nabout him. So he wasn&rsquo;t allowed to miss Peter.</p><p>&ldquo;I did miss you Pete-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me that.&rdquo; Peter said sharply and Wade flinched.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realise it until we started hanging out again and-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that what this is? Hanging out? Because from where I&rsquo;m\nstanding, you moved into my aunt&rsquo;s house and every time I come over you use me.\nYou ask me to help with your homework or you get me to do your chores or-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m just using you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t seem to have a problem doing that when we were\nfriends, why would it bother you now?&rdquo; Peter didn&rsquo;t want to fight with Wade. But\nhe couldn&rsquo;t stop the words from coming out of his mouth. </p><p>&ldquo;You done?&rdquo; Wade asked with raised brows. Peter took a deep\nbreath. He needed to calm down.</p><p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m not done. What you did was a dick move. We were\nbest friends for twelve years and suddenly it was like none of it mattered!&rdquo;\nPeter shouted and Wade sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; He whispered but Peter didn&rsquo;t care.</p><p>&ldquo;You left because, what, I wasn&rsquo;t cool enough? Come on Wade,\ntell me <i>your</i> side of the story!&rdquo; Peter\nhissed, he&rsquo;d never heard Wade&rsquo;s side. </p><p>&ldquo;My side? Now you&rsquo;re interested in my feelings?&rdquo; he&rsquo;d\nfinally pissed off Wade Wilson. </p><p>&ldquo;What do you have to say for yourself?&rdquo; Peter demanded and\nWade curled up his fists.</p><p>&ldquo;I <i>always</i> invited you\nto come and hang out with my friends and i. I always tried to include you in\nour jokes, I <i>always</i> told people to\nback off if they started picking on you. <i>you\n</i>rejected <i>me.
