May Parker instantly stormed over to the New Avengers Facility in upstate New York when she found out Peter was among the half. She screamed until her throat burned and she punched Tony until her arms could take no more and then some. It was a heartbreaking sight to see but no one had the heart to intervene.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHE WAS ALL I HAD LEFT\u201d was all Geneva heard from her room. When Thor came home with the news that Loki died\u2026 again, Geneva\u2019s heart shattered. She didn\u2019t talk much after that. She just waited for Tony and Peter to come home. She didn\u2019t really have anything to say. Loki was one of Geneva\u2019s best friends and she just wanted Peter and Tony to come home to comfort her. When only Tony came back, that\u2019s when sent Geneva over the edge. She locked herself in her room, barely ate and cried herself to sleep every night.</i></p><p><i>\u201cMs. Parker?\u201d they both hear a quaint voice and May stepped back to see a girl with puffy red eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re Peter\u2019s aunt right?\u201d A tear rolls down May\u2019s cheek and she nods. Geneva instantly walks up to May and hugs her. They both instantly break into tears Geneva whispering \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d. The tears went on for a while until they finally calmed down.</i></p><p><i>The day the disappeared people came back, everyone\u2019s heart was fuller than full again. Ever since May stormed into the Avengers Facility, Geneva sometimes went to the Parker residence to do girl stuff with May and talk about the memories they had with Peter. May would go through scrapbooks and photo albums telling her about Peter as a little kid and growing up. Geneva would always marvel about how well he did during the \u201cinternship\u201d. She would talk about how they both learned so many things working with Tony and how fun it was to help engineer suits. These nights went on for a while until a confused teenager stumbles into his apartment building wondering why his aunt and one of his best friends were sitting in facemasks, laughing and crying happy tears. The two girls instantly whip their head around when they hear the door open and widen their eyes when they see who it is. The both of them instantly get up and give him loads of hugs and kisses.\u00a0</i></p><p>Now, about a month later, Peter is sitting on Geneva\u2019s bed confusedly staring at a chemistry textbook and Geneva\u2019s on the floor looking up at him. She lets out a slight giggle and his confused look is now directed at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asks. She laughs even harder \u201cThis is why you don\u2019t try to make your web fluid in chemistry class and leave that kind of thing to me! I don\u2019t have anything else to do!\u201d There was a short pause before Peter mumbles \u201cShut up Gee\u201d. Geneva lets out a giggle and says \u201clet\u2019s take a break\u201d while taking off her glasses. \u201cYou want anything? Food? Water? Tea?\u201d </p><p>Peter doesn&rsquo;t really say anything. He just pats the side of her bed, signaling her to sit next to him. Geneva lets out a sigh and a giggle as she gets up, sits down next to him and puts her head on his shoulder. \u201cWhat I want, is to talk with you. Which I haven\u2019t gotten to do for a while\u201d She nods. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have you back\u201d Geneva whispers. She subtly slips her hand into Peter\u2019s and gives it a little squeeze. Peter looks away as he feels the blush creeping on his cheeks similar to the day when he first met her.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<i> \u201cWhere is she? She should be back by now.\u201d Tony asks looking at his watch. \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry Mr.Stark who exactly are we talking about here?\u201d Peter knits his eyebrows together in confusion. The elevator to their floor dings revealing a girl about Peters age with a cup of coffee in her left hand, a cup of iced tea in her right, and a backpack slung casually behind her back. As soon as she steps out of the elevator she starts rambling \u201cTony I\u2019m so sorry. That guy you sent me to talk to took absolutely forever and could not take a hint when I was hinting at what I was asking for and don\u2019t even get me started on the\u2026\u201d She turns to the side while talking and trails off when she sees Peter. She instantly takes into account his looks and how his eyes were scanning every feature of her face. They both feel their cheeks heat up as Tony clears his throat and says \u201cHey,\u201d while whistling and snapping his fingers \u201csnap out of your teen rom-com mode for a sec will you? Blegh. Gross\u201d He snatches the coffee from Geneva\u2019s hands and says \u201cGeneva this is Spiderling, Spider-Man whatever\u201d \u00a0She shyly puts out her hand to shake his \u201cA-actually Mr.Stark just\u2026 uh just Peter is fine\u201d the boy says while looking down. \u201cAlright then \u2018Just Peter\u2019 this is Geneva. she made both of your suits and Karen. Plus, she\u2019s my niece\u201d \u201cOkay\u201d she instantly comes to her defense \u201cI didn\u2019t fully make the suits! I just drew them up and designated what abilities the suit would actually have and laid out the general structure and calibrated Karen oh my god I\u2019m rambling. I\u2019m so sorry\u201d </i></p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Peter looks down at Geneva \u201cDo you think we\u2019re in \u2018teen rom-com mode\u2019 right now?\u201d. She smiles and hides her face in the crook of his neck. \u201cI would like to establish that I am not responsible for the actions and statements from my uncle\u201d They both laugh for a while and sigh. \u201cBut seriously,\u201d Peter gently asks, \u201cHow have you been?\u201d. Gee looks up at him and mumbles \u201cbetter now that you\u2019re here\u201d. His eyebrows furrowed together in confusion \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She giggles a bit \u201cJeez, Parker don\u2019t you know when a girl is flirting with you?\u201d His eyes widen. She laughs even harder \u201cI\u2019m kidding, Pete. Relax\u201d but she wasn\u2019t really.</p><p>It\u2019s safe to say Geneva had feelings for the boy. He was constantly on her mind. Little to her knowledge, She was constantly on his mind as well. They wouldn\u2019t dare discuss it to anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026\u201d She trails off \u201cI haven\u2019t been sleeping a lot lately. I can\u2019t stop thinking about what happened and how my crazy person of an uncle locked me in a closet rendering me useless\u201d Geneva pauses to look up at Peter for a reaction and is met with hurt eyes. \u201cNo no! This by no means is your fault! It\u2019s just me being weird and teenager-y. But it\u2019s okay, really! Loki came back and he and I have been talking through some of this stuff \u2018cause he doesn\u2019t really sleep either!\u201d. Peter raises his eyebrows and just looks at her. \u201cStooooooop!\u201d she drags out and playfully hits him in his surprisingly built chest. He raises his eyebrows. \u201cPeter, seriously. Stop looking at me like that. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>His phone buzzes and his eyes drop. \u201cMay wants me hone. I gotta go. Please, Gee, take care of yourself. You have nothing to worry about, cause we\u2019re all here and you\u2019ve got nothing to blame yourself over, cause we\u2019re all here. If you need anything, and I mean anything at any time, even if you wanna go on a snack run at 2 AM, just call me?\u201d Geneva nods, stands up with the spiderling and pulls him in a hug, mumbling a \u201cthank you\u201d in the crook of his neck.\u00a0</p><p>She closes the door behind Peter and is met with judgemental looks from Loki. Geneva narrows her eyes at him and mumbles a soft \u201cShut up\u201d. He pulls that mischievous smirk \u201cI said nothing Ms.Stark. But I\u2019m starting to doubt your testimony about not having a crush on Peter-\u201d \u201cSHUT IT\u201d She yelled and stomped away to the kitchen with the god following closely behind her. \u201cYou know,\u201d He starts. She lets out a dramatic sigh, stopping her tea from pouring out and hunching her shoulders. \u201cI may be the god of mischief but-\u201d \u201cExactly\u201d she cuts him off and turns around. \u201cYou like to stir up drama by seeing stuff that DOESN\u2019T EXIST\u201d </p><p>She strides over to the couch in an attempt to avoid the conversation. She adores Loki and she\u2019s ecstatic over the fact that he\u2019s back but no, she didn\u2019t like the conversation they were having.\u201d You can\u2019t run from your feelings forever, Geneva\u201d she scoffs and snaps back \u201cAnd you can\u2019t run from people by faking your death all the time. Besides, I\u2019m not running, I\u2019m just pushing them to the side and not talking about them ever. But that doesn\u2019t matter cause we need to catch you up on things that happened.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>A while into Geneva and Loki\u2019s \u201cReunited Office Marathon\u201d (the only reason for it being \u201cIt\u2019s been a while and who doesn\u2019t love The Office?\u201d), Loki finally says \u201cGeneva,\u201d prompting her to look up at him with raised eyebrows. He continues \u201cyou are aware that you kinda just confessed your feelings about Peter to me right?\u201d She nods and asks \u201cCan I tell ya a secret?\u201d He nods and she becons him to lean closer with her finger. \u201cI actually trust you, despite your title.\u201d She whispers. He smiles greatly with a \u201cThank you, Geneva\u201d \u00a0and kisses the back of her hand. She giggles at the sudden gesture and nods, softly saying \u201cOf course. You\u2019re my insomnia buddy and there\u2019s a lot of night thoughts that will eventually come out one way or another.\u201d </p><p>There was a comfortable silence between the two friends before Loki finally breaks it with \u201cHe actually locked you in the closet?\u201d She cracks a small smile that quickly fades upon the flashes of memory coming back to haunt her. \u201cYeah,\u201d she starts \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to think about still, which is pretty stupid, honestly but I don\u2019t like thinking about it\u201d A single tear runs down her face when her mind races around the feelings during and following what happened. \u201cThis is all your fault\u201d she told herself. \u201cIf you would\u2019ve broken out in time, you could\u2019ve gone with them and saved them. You could have been with Peter and stopped him from leaving. You don\u2019t deserve these abilities. You don\u2019t deserve the Stark name.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGeneva stop it\u201d Is always the phrase that snaps her out of her thoughts. This time, it came from Loki. She wipes the tears from her face \u201cI\u2019m not that loud am I?\u201d. He shakes his head. \u201cSorry\u201d she mumbles. \u201cHey\u201d he grabs her hands and looks her in the eyes \u201cTalk to him. He\u2019s worried about you. It\u2019s not telekinesis but just good body language\u201d She nods and whips out her phone to text Peter</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Peter\u2019s phone buzzes while he\u2019s watching Star Wars with Ned and his cheeks heat up once he sees who it is</p><p><b>Geneva Stark\u2728</b> Hey\u2026 is now a good time to talk?</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Ned inquires. Peter looks up, snapping out of his trance. \u201cGeneva\u201d he says, cheeks heating up at just the thought of her. \u201cYou don\u2019t know her\u201d He continues, \u201cShe\u2019s from the internship\u201d. Ned\u2019s eyebrows raise and he says \u201cPeter, I don\u2019t know what happened to you when you were stuck, wherever you were but, Geneva Stark is just a myth. The hack on Stark Industries, Tony Stark having an orphaned niece, they\u2019re all rumors.\u201d Peter just shakes his head and laughs. A good chunk of people doubted Geneva existed because that\u2019s how Tony preferred it. He ignored Ned\u2019s beliefs due to the (obvious) proof Peter has seen and texted Geneva back.</p><p><b>Peter Parker\ud83d\udd77 </b>Yeah! What\u2019s on your mind? Is everything alright?</p><p>Within a minute Peter\u2019s phone buzzes again</p><p><b>Geneva Stark\u2728 </b>Idk. I just need distractions rn</p><p><b>Peter Parker\ud83d\udd77</b> Well I don\u2019t know if this makes you feel better or worse but Ned is still convinced you don\u2019t exist</p><p>Loki had left the room, leaving Geneva on the couch, alone. She was in tears as her mind raced back and forth, circling from one thing to the next. She gripped her hair trying to calm her thoughts down as tears escaped her eyes without hesitation until she noticed her phone buzzing, signifying Peter texting her back. She looked at her phone, studying the goofy picture of him for his contact photo and then the text. She smiled as more tears rushed down her cheeks. This was the thing telling her that everything was going to be okay and for a short amount of time, she actually believed it.</p><h2><b>tags:</b></h2><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mi5f7xBznyrSF0TFUakTExA\">@nerdofthehighestcalibre</a> \u200b</p>",

This by no means is your fault! It\u2019s just me being weird and teenager-y. But it\u2019s okay, really! Loki came back and he and I have been talking through some of this stuff \u2018cause he doesn\u2019t really sleep either!\u201d. Peter raises his eyebrows and just looks at her. \u201cStooooooop!\u201d she drags out and playfully hits him in his surprisingly built chest. He raises his eyebrows. \u201cPeter, seriously.

Geneva narrows her eyes at him and mumbles a soft \u201cShut up\u201d. He pulls that mischievous smirk \u201cI said nothing Ms.Stark. But I\u2019m starting to doubt your testimony about not having a crush on Peter-\u201d \u201cSHUT IT\u201d She yelled and stomped away to the kitchen with the god following closely behind her. \u201cYou know,\u201d He starts.

Besides, I\u2019m not running, I\u2019m just pushing them to the side and not talking about them ever. But that doesn\u2019t matter cause we need to catch you up on things that happened.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>A while into Geneva and Loki\u2019s \u201cReunited Office Marathon\u201d (the only reason for it being \u201cIt\u2019s been a while and who doesn\u2019t love The Office?\u201d), Loki finally says \u201cGeneva,\u201d prompting her to look up at him with raised eyebrows. He continues \u201cyou are aware that you kinda just confessed your feelings about Peter to me right?\u201d She nods and asks \u201cCan I tell ya a secret?\u201d He nods and she becons him to lean closer with her finger. \u201cI actually trust you, despite your title.\u201d She whispers. He smiles greatly with a \u201cThank you, Geneva\u201d \u00a0and kisses the back of her hand. She giggles at the sudden gesture and nods, softly saying \u201cOf course. You\u2019re my insomnia buddy and there\u2019s a lot of night thoughts that will eventually come out one way or another.\u201d </p><p>There was a comfortable silence between the two friends before Loki finally breaks it with \u201cHe actually locked you in the closet?\u201d She cracks a small smile that quickly fades upon the flashes of memory coming back to haunt her. \u201cYeah,\u201d she starts \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to think about still, which is pretty stupid, honestly but I don\u2019t like thinking about it\u201d A single tear runs down her face when her mind races around the feelings during and following what happened. \u201cThis is all your fault\u201d she told herself. \u201cIf you would\u2019ve broken out in time, you could\u2019ve gone with them and saved them. You could have been with Peter and stopped him from leaving. You don\u2019t deserve these abilities. You don\u2019t deserve the Stark name.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGeneva stop it\u201d Is always the phrase that snaps her out of her thoughts. This time, it came from Loki. She wipes the tears from her face \u201cI\u2019m not that loud am I?\u201d. He shakes his head. \u201cSorry\u201d she mumbles. \u201cHey\u201d he grabs her hands and looks her in the eyes \u201cTalk to him. He\u2019s worried about you. It\u2019s not telekinesis but just good body language\u201d She nods and whips out her phone to text Peter</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Peter\u2019s phone buzzes while he\u2019s watching Star Wars with Ned and his cheeks heat up once he sees who it is</p><p><b>Geneva Stark\u2728</b> Hey\u2026 is now a good time to talk?</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Ned inquires. Peter looks up, snapping out of his trance. \u201cGeneva\u201d he says, cheeks heating up at just the thought of her. \u201cYou don\u2019t know her\u201d He continues, \u201cShe\u2019s from the internship\u201d. Ned\u2019s eyebrows raise and he says \u201cPeter, I don\u2019t know what happened to you when you were stuck, wherever you were but, Geneva Stark is just a myth. The hack on Stark Industries, Tony Stark having an orphaned niece, they\u2019re all rumors.\u201d Peter just shakes his head and laughs. A good chunk of people doubted Geneva existed because that\u2019s how Tony preferred it. He ignored Ned\u2019s beliefs due to the (obvious) proof Peter has seen and texted Geneva back.</p><p><b>Peter Parker\ud83d\udd77 </b>Yeah! What\u2019s on your mind? Is everything alright?</p><p>Within a minute Peter\u2019s phone buzzes again</p><p><b>Geneva Stark\u2728 </b>Idk. I just need distractions rn</p><p><b>Peter Parker\ud83d\udd77</b> Well I don\u2019t know if this makes you feel better or worse but Ned is still convinced you don\u2019t exist</p><p>Loki had left the room, leaving Geneva on the couch, alone. She was in tears as her mind raced back and forth, circling from one thing to the next. She gripped her hair trying to calm her thoughts down as tears escaped her eyes without hesitation until she noticed her phone buzzing, signifying Peter texting her back. She looked at her phone, studying the goofy picture of him for his contact photo and then the text. She smiled as more tears rushed down her cheeks. This was the thing telling her that everything was going to be okay and for a short amount of time, she actually believed it.</p><h2><b>tags:</b></h2><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mi5f7xBznyrSF0TFUakTExA\">@nerdofthehighestcalibre</a> \u200b</p></p>",

May Parker instantly stormed over to the New Avengers Facility in upstate New York when she found out Peter was among the half. She screamed until her throat burned and she punched Tony until her arms could take no more and then some. It was a heartbreaking sight to see but no one had the heart to intervene.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHE WAS ALL I HAD LEFT\u201d was all Geneva heard from her room. When Thor came home with the news that Loki died\u2026 again, Geneva\u2019s heart shattered. She didn\u2019t talk much after that. She just waited for Tony and Peter to come home. She didn\u2019t really have anything to say. Loki was one of Geneva\u2019s best friends and she just wanted Peter and Tony to come home to comfort her. When only Tony came back, that\u2019s when sent Geneva over the edge. She locked herself in her room, barely ate and cried herself to sleep every night.</i></p><p><i>\u201cMs. Parker?\u201d they both hear a quaint voice and May stepped back to see a girl with puffy red eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re Peter\u2019s aunt right?\u201d A tear rolls down May\u2019s cheek and she nods. Geneva instantly walks up to May and hugs her. They both instantly break into tears Geneva whispering \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d. The tears went on for a while until they finally calmed down.</i></p><p><i>The day the disappeared people came back, everyone\u2019s heart was fuller than full again. Ever since May stormed into the Avengers Facility, Geneva sometimes went to the Parker residence to do girl stuff with May and talk about the memories they had with Peter. May would go through scrapbooks and photo albums telling her about Peter as a little kid and growing up. Geneva would always marvel about how well he did during the \u201cinternship\u201d. She would talk about how they both learned so many things working with Tony and how fun it was to help engineer suits. These nights went on for a while until a confused teenager stumbles into his apartment building wondering why his aunt and one of his best friends were sitting in facemasks, laughing and crying happy tears. The two girls instantly whip their head around when they hear the door open and widen their eyes when they see who it is. The both of them instantly get up and give him loads of hugs and kisses.\u00a0</i></p><p>Now, about a month later, Peter is sitting on Geneva\u2019s bed confusedly staring at a chemistry textbook and Geneva\u2019s on the floor looking up at him.

She laughs even harder \u201cThis is why you don\u2019t try to make your web fluid in chemistry class and leave that kind of thing to me!

He just pats the side of her bed, signaling her to sit next to him. Geneva lets out a sigh and a giggle as she gets up, sits down next to him and puts her head on his shoulder. \u201cWhat I want, is to talk with you. Which I haven\u2019t gotten to do for a while\u201d She nods. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have you back\u201d Geneva whispers. She subtly slips her hand into Peter\u2019s and gives it a little squeeze.

May Parker instantly stormed over to the New Avengers Facility in upstate New York when she found out Peter was among the half. She screamed until her throat burned and she punched Tony until her arms could take no more and then some. It was a heartbreaking sight to see but no one had the heart to intervene.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;HE WAS ALL I HAD LEFT&rdquo; was all Geneva heard from her room. When Thor came home with the news that Loki died&hellip; again, Geneva&rsquo;s heart shattered. She didn&rsquo;t talk much after that. She just waited for Tony and Peter to come home. She didn&rsquo;t really have anything to say. Loki was one of Geneva&rsquo;s best friends and she just wanted Peter and Tony to come home to comfort her. When only Tony came back, that&rsquo;s when sent Geneva over the edge. She locked herself in her room, barely ate and cried herself to sleep every night.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Ms. Parker?&rdquo; they both hear a quaint voice and May stepped back to see a girl with puffy red eyes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Peter&rsquo;s aunt right?&rdquo; A tear rolls down May&rsquo;s cheek and she nods. Geneva instantly walks up to May and hugs her. They both instantly break into tears Geneva whispering &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo;. The tears went on for a while until they finally calmed down.</i></p><p><i>The day the disappeared people came back, everyone&rsquo;s heart was fuller than full again. Ever since May stormed into the Avengers Facility, Geneva sometimes went to the Parker residence to do girl stuff with May and talk about the memories they had with Peter. May would go through scrapbooks and photo albums telling her about Peter as a little kid and growing up. Geneva would always marvel about how well he did during the &ldquo;internship&rdquo;. She would talk about how they both learned so many things working with Tony and how fun it was to help engineer suits. These nights went on for a while until a confused teenager stumbles into his apartment building wondering why his aunt and one of his best friends were sitting in facemasks, laughing and crying happy tears. The two girls instantly whip their head around when they hear the door open and widen their eyes when they see who it is. The both of them instantly get up and give him loads of hugs and kisses.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Now, about a month later, Peter is sitting on Geneva&rsquo;s bed confusedly staring at a chemistry textbook and Geneva&rsquo;s on the floor looking up at him. She lets out a slight giggle and his confused look is now directed at her. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he asks. She laughs even harder &ldquo;This is why you don&rsquo;t try to make your web fluid in chemistry class and leave that kind of thing to me! I don&rsquo;t have anything else to do!&rdquo; There was a short pause before Peter mumbles &ldquo;Shut up Gee&rdquo;. Geneva lets out a giggle and says &ldquo;let&rsquo;s take a break&rdquo; while taking off her glasses. &ldquo;You want anything? Food? Water? Tea?&rdquo; </p><p>Peter doesn&rsquo;t really say anything. He just pats the side of her bed, signaling her to sit next to him. Geneva lets out a sigh and a giggle as she gets up, sits down next to him and puts her head on his shoulder. &ldquo;What I want, is to talk with you. Which I haven&rsquo;t gotten to do for a while&rdquo; She nods. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to have you back&rdquo; Geneva whispers. She subtly slips her hand into Peter&rsquo;s and gives it a little squeeze. Peter looks away as he feels the blush creeping on his cheeks similar to the day when he first met her.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> &ldquo;Where is she? She should be back by now.&rdquo; Tony asks looking at his watch. &ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m sorry Mr.Stark who exactly are we talking about here?&rdquo; Peter knits his eyebrows together in confusion. The elevator to their floor dings revealing a girl about Peters age with a cup of coffee in her left hand, a cup of iced tea in her right, and a backpack slung casually behind her back. As soon as she steps out of the elevator she starts rambling &ldquo;Tony I&rsquo;m so sorry. That guy you sent me to talk to took absolutely forever and could not take a hint when I was hinting at what I was asking for and don&rsquo;t even get me started on the&hellip;&rdquo; She turns to the side while talking and trails off when she sees Peter. She instantly takes into account his looks and how his eyes were scanning every feature of her face. They both feel their cheeks heat up as Tony clears his throat and says &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; while whistling and snapping his fingers &ldquo;snap out of your teen rom-com mode for a sec will you? Blegh. Gross&rdquo; He snatches the coffee from Geneva&rsquo;s hands and says &ldquo;Geneva this is Spiderling, Spider-Man whatever&rdquo; &nbsp;She shyly puts out her hand to shake his &ldquo;A-actually Mr.Stark just&hellip; uh just Peter is fine&rdquo; the boy says while looking down. &ldquo;Alright then &lsquo;Just Peter&rsquo; this is Geneva. she made both of your suits and Karen. Plus, she&rsquo;s my niece&rdquo; &ldquo;Okay&rdquo; she instantly comes to her defense &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t fully make the suits! I just drew them up and designated what abilities the suit would actually have and laid out the general structure and calibrated Karen oh my god I&rsquo;m rambling. I&rsquo;m so sorry&rdquo; </i></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter looks down at Geneva &ldquo;Do you think we&rsquo;re in &lsquo;teen rom-com mode&rsquo; right now?&rdquo;. She smiles and hides her face in the crook of his neck. &ldquo;I would like to establish that I am not responsible for the actions and statements from my uncle&rdquo; They both laugh for a while and sigh. &ldquo;But seriously,&rdquo; Peter gently asks, &ldquo;How have you been?&rdquo;. Gee looks up at him and mumbles &ldquo;better now that you&rsquo;re here&rdquo;. His eyebrows furrowed together in confusion &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; She giggles a bit &ldquo;Jeez, Parker don&rsquo;t you know when a girl is flirting with you?&rdquo; His eyes widen. She laughs even harder &ldquo;I&rsquo;m kidding, Pete. Relax&rdquo; but she wasn&rsquo;t really.</p><p>It&rsquo;s safe to say Geneva had feelings for the boy. He was constantly on her mind. Little to her knowledge, She was constantly on his mind as well. They wouldn&rsquo;t dare discuss it to anyone. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&hellip;&rdquo; She trails off &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been sleeping a lot lately. I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about what happened and how my crazy person of an uncle locked me in a closet rendering me useless&rdquo; Geneva pauses to look up at Peter for a reaction and is met with hurt eyes. &ldquo;No no! This by no means is your fault! It&rsquo;s just me being weird and teenager-y. But it&rsquo;s okay, really! Loki came back and he and I have been talking through some of this stuff &lsquo;cause he doesn&rsquo;t really sleep either!&rdquo;. Peter raises his eyebrows and just looks at her. &ldquo;Stooooooop!&rdquo; she drags out and playfully hits him in his surprisingly built chest. He raises his eyebrows. &ldquo;Peter, seriously. Stop looking at me like that. I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;</p><p>His phone buzzes and his eyes drop. &ldquo;May wants me hone. I gotta go. Please, Gee, take care of yourself. You have nothing to worry about, cause we&rsquo;re all here and you&rsquo;ve got nothing to blame yourself over, cause we&rsquo;re all here. If you need anything, and I mean anything at any time, even if you wanna go on a snack run at 2 AM, just call me?&rdquo; Geneva nods, stands up with the spiderling and pulls him in a hug, mumbling a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; in the crook of his neck.&nbsp;</p><p>She closes the door behind Peter and is met with judgemental looks from Loki. Geneva narrows her eyes at him and mumbles a soft &ldquo;Shut up&rdquo;. He pulls that mischievous smirk &ldquo;I said nothing Ms.Stark. But I&rsquo;m starting to doubt your testimony about not having a crush on Peter-&rdquo; &ldquo;SHUT IT&rdquo; She yelled and stomped away to the kitchen with the god following closely behind her. &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; He starts. She lets out a dramatic sigh, stopping her tea from pouring out and hunching her shoulders. &ldquo;I may be the god of mischief but-&rdquo; &ldquo;Exactly&rdquo; she cuts him off and turns around. &ldquo;You like to stir up drama by seeing stuff that DOESN&rsquo;T EXIST&rdquo; </p><p>She strides over to the couch in an attempt to avoid the conversation. She adores Loki and she&rsquo;s ecstatic over the fact that he&rsquo;s back but no, she didn&rsquo;t like the conversation they were having.&rdquo; You can&rsquo;t run from your feelings forever, Geneva&rdquo; she scoffs and snaps back &ldquo;And you can&rsquo;t run from people by faking your death all the time. Besides, I&rsquo;m not running, I&rsquo;m just pushing them to the side and not talking about them ever. But that doesn&rsquo;t matter cause we need to catch you up on things that happened.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>A while into Geneva and Loki&rsquo;s &ldquo;Reunited Office Marathon&rdquo; (the only reason for it being &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a while and who doesn&rsquo;t love The Office?&rdquo;), Loki finally says &ldquo;Geneva,&rdquo; prompting her to look up at him with raised eyebrows.

He smiles greatly with a &ldquo;Thank you, Geneva&rdquo; &nbsp;and kisses the back of her hand. She giggles at the sudden gesture and nods, softly saying &ldquo;Of course. You&rsquo;re my insomnia buddy and there&rsquo;s a lot of night thoughts that will eventually come out one way or another.&rdquo; </p><p>There was a comfortable silence between the two friends before Loki finally breaks it with &ldquo;He actually locked you in the closet?&rdquo; She cracks a small smile that quickly fades upon the flashes of memory coming back to haunt her. &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; she starts &ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of hard to think about still, which is pretty stupid, honestly but I don&rsquo;t like thinking about it&rdquo; A single tear runs down her face when her mind races around the feelings during and following what happened. &ldquo;This is all your fault&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;If you would&rsquo;ve broken out in time, you could&rsquo;ve gone with them and saved them.
