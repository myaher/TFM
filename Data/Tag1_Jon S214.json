A common signification given\nto the troll in psychoanalysis (I\u2019m not sure if Marie-Louise von Franz talks\nabout this, but Freud certainly does) is the role of the evil father who \u201csteals\u201d\nthe mother from the child during the oedipal stage. In this particular tale, we\u2019ve\ngot the \u201cgood\u201d father, the \u201cbad\u201d father, but the mother is notably absent. The\nstand-in figure for the mother is the princess kept prisoner by the troll. In\nfact, the tale strongly implies that the princess and the troll share the same\nbed:</p><p><i>Eventually,\ndarkness came, and they went to bed.

The ambiguity between the \u201cmonstrous\u201d troll and the \u201cparental\u201d troll is actually alluded to in a Jon POV chapter from ASOS:</p><p><i>&quot;Is\nit true you killed a giant once?&rdquo; he asked Tormund as they rode.

Interestingly, here\u2019s another asoiaf passage (this time from ACOK) where the mountain morphs into a mother-ish figure:</p><p><i>\u201cThe\nmountain is your mother,\u201d Stonesnake had told him during an easier climb a few\ndays past. \u201cCling to her, press your face up against her teats, and she won\u2019t\ndrop you.\u201d Jon had made a joke of it, saying how he\u2019d always wondered who his\nmother was, but never thought to find her in the Frostfangs. It did not seem\nnearly so amusing now.</i></p><p>We could also bring up the princes\nturned to stone/kings and lords of Winterfell buried in the crypt parallels. When\nyou view the troll\u2019s den as a sort of tomb, indeed, passages such as this one\nstart making a lot of sense:</p><p><i>And\nso the troll said no more about it. After a while though, he asked who had\nscattered flowers around the threshold.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh,\nthat would be me,&rdquo; said the princess.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;For\nwhat reason?&rdquo; asked the troll.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh,\nthat\u2019s because I hold you so dear. Now that I know where your heart is, I\nwanted it to be surrounded by flowers,&rdquo; said the princess.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Is\nthat so?\u201d said the troll. \u201cThen I\u2019ll have to disappoint you. It\u2019s not there\nanymore.\u201d</i></p><p>The princess is laying flowers on\nthe threshold of a \u201c<i>steep rock wall</i>\u201d\n(the outside description we\u2019re given of the troll\u2019s den), to honor something \u201ccherished\u201d\nthat isn\u2019t there anymore \u2013 that sounds an awful lot like putting flowers on someone\u2019s\ntomb (or sepulcher.) In asoiaf, Lyanna Stark is both a \u201cprincess\u201d and a \u201cprisoner\u201d\nof the crypt, and honored with blue winter roses as well. \u00a0</p><p>For these reasons, I tend to view\nthe princess of the tale as a foil/parallel to Jon\u2019s mother. </p><p>Now, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdZGfCyjwDosEC8qBOKI-8Q\">@myasksaccount</a>, you also\nbrought this up:</p><p><i>This fairy tale in\nparticular reminds me of Jon Snow\u2019s conflict with the Night King, as the prince\nin the story is kept apart from his more conventionally privileged brothers and\ncan only succeed with the aid of a raven, a wolf and a princess.</i></p><p>This is a very good point, and it\nhad me munching over it for a while. Still does, actually. Askeladden (the tale\u2019s\nhero)\u2019s closest partnership is with the wolf (Jon and Ghost?) The raven\u2019s role\nin the tale is to bring the hero a key, and there\u2019s also a salmon (house Tully\nperhaps?) who fetches an egg in a well for Askeladden. The raven represents knowledge:\nin asoiaf, they\u2019re used to carry messages and Bran, the three-eyed-raven, can \u201cunlock\u201d\nany kind of information (hence the key). The wolf and salmon, I\u2019m not so sure. The\nwolf\u2019s function/purpose is to carry Askeladden, though, so if Jon wargs Ghost at the moment\nof his death, it\u2019s possible that Ghost become the \u201ccarrier\u201d of Jon\u2019s soul. Consider\nAskeladden\u2019s first encounter with the wolf: </p><p><i>&quot;Please,\nyou must help me,&rdquo; said the wolf. &ldquo;If you let me have your horse, you\ncan ride on me instead. I will help you in your utmost need.\u201d</i></p><p><i>&quot;I\ndoubt you will be of much help; that being said, it&rsquo;s a shame to leave you here\nto starve to death. Take my horse, if you must,&rdquo; said the prince. </i></p><p><i>When\nthe wolf had eaten the horse, Askeladden took the bridle and tied it to the\nwolf\u2019s mouth, and laid the saddle on his back. After had eaten his first proper\nmeal in two years, the wolf now was so strong that it set off with Askeladden\nas if he was light as a feather; never in his life had the prince ridden this\nfast!</i></p><p>This is a reconstruction of the\ndeath-and-rebirth trope, where the hero loose his horse (\u201c<i>old and worn-out</i>\u201d, we\u2019re told, since the prince\u2019s brothers have\ntaken all the good horses), only to end up with something better. If the Wall\nis Jon\u2019s \u201cold and worn-out\u201d horse \u2013 basically the only thing left for him, a\nbastard \u2013 and if he\u2019s killed at the Wall\u2026 hum. </p><p>And now for the salmon. His role in\nthe story is to bring Askeladden something he can\u2019t physically reach himself,\nfor the egg is at the bottom of a well full of water. Imo, it can only represent\nArya, who\u2019s 1) got a strong affinity with water, as many before me have pointed\nout, 2) can slither herself in impossible places (notably by changing faces),\nand 3) is a girl (and well, water and eggs are all very feminine elements,\nhence perhaps why Askeladden \u2013 a man \u2013 can\u2019t get it himself). </p><p><b>Other\nremark</b>: \u201c<i>There must always be a Stark in Winterfell</i>\u201d.\nThe king from the tale could be Winterfell (\u201c<i>These boys were so precious to him, that he could never be without them\nall at once: one had to always stay by his side</i>.\u201d)</p><p>Thoughts? </p>",

The only useful thing she ever\nmanaged to do was make more Starks. After living with her prejudiced,\nthoughtless cruelty for thirteen years I was more than ready to break her\ninflexible little mind in half. Which was my plan for today. Best get a move on\nthat.</p><p>I grinned at my reflection in the mirror, knowing I was\ndressed no differently than the rest of the Stark children and loving how much\nit pissed my dear Auntie off. There was no chance of Catelyn letting me speak\nwith Father without listening in. Perfect. </p><p>Now if only my resting bitch face would start being\nintimidating again instead of sullen, that would be just grand. Stupid pretty\nboy face.</p><p>/\u2026/</p><p>\u201cYour nameday is coming up.\u201d Robb mentioned, just as he had\nevery day for the last handful. My dear Auntie\u2019s glare burned against my back\nas she lurked and waited for me to turn on Robb. Old Gods, but that woman\u2019s\nblind prejudice was annoying. \u201cDo you know what you\u2019re going to ask Father\nfor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think\u2026 I\u2019d like to know who my mother was. And why Father\nchose to raise me here instead of leaving me with her.\u201d Carefully not looking\nover my shoulder at where I knew the Lady Stark was spying on interactions, I\nmade sure to keep my voice thoughtful. \u201cI\u2019m almost a man grown. I think I\u2019m old\nenough to understand if it\u2026 if it was something terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d The future lord of Winterfell looked thoughtful, and\nnodded his head as he clapped a hand to my shoulder. \u201cIf anyone deserves to\nknow it\u2019s you, brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, one can hope.\u201d With a chuckle, I shook my head. \u201cNow\ncome on, Robb. Let\u2019s finish putting this away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Sighing as he looked at how much was left to take\ncare of, Robb grumbled but set too willingly enough. \u201cCan\u2019t leave a job half\ndone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cT\u2019would be unfitting of a son of House Stark.\u201d I agreed with\njust enough mockery in my tone to make Robb laugh and the Lady Stark bristle.\nHonestly, the woman was so easy to rile up. It was actually a bit sad.</p><p>/\u2026/</p><p>\u201cFather, <i>please</i>.\u201d\nI may have arranged for Lady Stark to follow me into the Godswood today when I\nwent to confront Ned Stark about my true origins, but it still bothered me to\nknow that she was lurking while I asked my father for honesty. Stupid bint. My\nirritation made my voice crack with suppressed emotion. \u201cPlease, I deserve to\nknow. If it\u2019s a secret you\u2019re keeping to preserve a Lady\u2019s honour, I swear by\nthe Old God\u2019s I won\u2019t speak of it! I just wish to know her <i>name</i>. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swore to your mother to keep you safe, Jon. You are my\nblood.\u201d Ned Stark was a quiet man, but he had enough determination to grind\nmountains to dust. A brilliant attribute when you needed to ration supplies\nthrough a decade long winter. Not so endearing when trying to get him to say\nsomething he wanted to stay secret. \u201cThat is enough for me. Let that be the end\nof it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine then, if you won\u2019t tell me my mother\u2019s name\u2026 then tell\nme my fathers!\u201d The blood drained out of my father\u2019s face, and guilt rose in my\nchest. I forged onwards anyway, because this needed doing if we were going to\nsurvive the Long Night without worrying about knives in our backs. \u201cPeople talk\nabout me, and I hear it all the time. \u2018The Honorable Ned Stark\u2019s only sin\u2019,\nthey call me. But they don\u2019t know you, Father. Not like I do. Not enough to\nknow that\u2026 you wouldn\u2019t. Not after you wed, not after you swore an oath. Even\nif Lady Stark was <i>supposed </i>to be your\nelder brother\u2019s wife\u2026 you would never dishonour her that way.\u201d</p><p>Father\u2019s grip on the Heart Tree\u2019s bark was desperate as his\neyes searched my face. I swallowed, hating the pain I saw in his eyes. \u201cI\ndon\u2019t\u2026 It matters not who sired me, not truly. <i>You</i> are my father in all the ways that count, and aye, your blood\nis in my veins, but\u2026 it was Lord Brandon who sired me, wasn\u2019t it. With Lady\nAshara Dayne. If I had been a girl\u2026 you could have left me there, let me be a\nSand. But I was a boy, and the only son of Rickard Stark\u2019s eldest son. That\u2019s\nwhy everyone says Lady Ashara\u2019s <i>daughter</i>\nwas stillborn. It was a misdirection to cover your tracks, because Lord\nBrandon\u2019s son, even a bastard one, could have a stronger claim than your sons\nand-\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. Jon, please. That\u2019s enough. That is\u2026 that is more\nthan enough.\u201d Strong, sword calloused hands gripped my shoulders, and stern\ngrey eyes held mine for a long moment before my Father\u2019s expression softened.\n\u201cI can see now, how much this has troubled you. You\u2019ve never liked the thought\nof causing problems for Robb, and I can well believe that you would draw the\nworst possible conclusion\u2026 Aye, I suppose there\u2019s nothing for it now.\nEspecially not with that sort of rumour taking root\u2026\u201d</p><p>I forced my jaw to relax and my breathing to steady.\n\u201cFather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother was not Ashara Dayne, Jon. And your father was\nnot my brother. Would that\u2026 would that they <i>had</i>\nbeen your parents. Perhaps this would be a simple thing to speak of.\u201d Old, deep\npain etched lines in my father\u2019s face, and for a horrible moment I imagined it.\nOf being the only one still remaining of my siblings. Of Robb slain by\ntreachery, Sansa stolen away by our enemies, Arya and Bran losing themselves to\nvengeance and madness, Rickon\u2019s memories of us fading away until he forgot us\nentirely\u2026 Father closed his eyes, seeming to gather his strength before he\ncould look me in the eye again. \u201cYou will always be my son, Jon. My blood is in\nyour veins, Jon. As is\u2026 as is the blood of my sister, Lyanna.\u201d</p><p>I had been hoping for it, expecting it even, but still <i>hearing him say it</i> made my breath catch\nlike I had just been hit. There in front of the Heart Tree, with the truth\nringing in my ears, all I could manage to do was blink. \u201cBut\u2026 that would make\nmy father\u2026 but I don\u2019t <i>want</i> to be a\nTargaryen! I want to be a Stark! Father, don\u2019t tell anyone else!\u201d</p><p>Sputtering a relieved laugh my father shook me gently until\nI stopped whining, and then he pulled me into an embrace. \u201cI promise, Jon. No\none else will ever know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm\u2026 maybe\u2026 uh, maybe <i>one</i>\nother person.\u201d I felt my father stiffen, and I firmly kept my face pressed into\nthe fur of his collar. \u201cMaybe\u2026 I think it would be okay for you to tell Lady\nStark? Maybe then she\u2019ll agree to have a proper marriage ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon, I\u2026 I know Cat hasn\u2019t always been kind to you. Are you\nsure you wish for her to know?\u201d Father pushed me back so he could see my face.\nI pouted shamelessly, because proper hugs were stupidly scarce in this\nmachismo-laden hellscape. \u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t say yes because you want to make things\neasier for me, Jon. I can handle an argument with my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you want to get married in front of the Heart Tree.\u201d I\npointed out sullenly, keeping my eyes firmly on my father\u2019s chin. \u201cAnd you\ncan\u2019t do that while you keep secrets from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been three and ten years, Jon.\u201d Father sighed, clear\nlonging in his words even as he pushed his own wants aside for the sake of his\nduty. \u201cIf she were willing to truly join the North she would have said\nsomething to me by now.\u201d</p><p>Oh, that comment was going to <i>burn</i>. I know my dear eavesdropping Auntie has never felt welcome in\nthe North, and now she knows <i>why</i>.\nThis is delicious and I love it.</p><p>\u201cTell her anyway, Father.\u201d Meeting those grey eyes again, I\noffered up a wry smile. \u201cPerhaps this will be enough for her to make that\noffer. Perhaps it will calm her fears about me hurting Robb. Perhaps she will\nsimply continue to ignore the fact that I exist until she cannot avoid it any\nlonger. Regardless of the outcome, she at least deserves to know that you have\nnever broken your oaths to her. She deserves to know that another oath bound\nyou to silence, for all our sakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a good boy, Jon.\u201d Father smiled, embracing me again\nas he kissed my hair. \u201cNever forget that kindness. It is a great gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t, Father.\u201d I smiled back and leaned into the\nstrength of the only father I would ever acknowledge. \u201cAfter all, I have you to\nshow me what to do.\u201d</p><p>/\u2026/</p><p>The next morning, I could see that Father had spoken to his\nwife. The way she looked at me\u2026 Catelyn was ashamed of herself. Was writhing in\nguilt of her own making like a worm on a hook. Doubtless she was remembering\nthe promise she had made to her Seven Gods, the promise she had broken so very\nquickly when she learned that I had lived through my fever.</p><p>This was no less than she deserved.</p><p>I took my seat at the head table without sparing her more\nthan a glance. Catelyn\u2019s eyes were reddened and heavy from a night of weeping.\nFor once, there was no transparent attempt to have me sit elsewhere, removed\nfrom my family. Sansa wrinkled her nose at me, only having recently learned\nwhat the word \u2018bastard\u2019 meant, thanks to the Southron influences in her life.</p><p>Robb and Theon glanced at Lady Stark, but did not hesitate\nto draw me into their morning conversation once I was seated.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Robb kept his voice quiet enough not to be heard\nbeyond our small huddle. \u201cDid you get the nameday gift you wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d Inclining my head, I answered just as quietly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like we thought. She\u2019s dead, but Father\u2019s still trying to protect her\nmemory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he gave you a name?\u201d Theon questioned, sharp eyes\nscanning slowly over the hall for listening ears.</p><p>\u201cHe did. I asked him to tell Lady Stark.\u201d I shrugged when\nthey both looked at me strangely. \u201cPerhaps now she will stop fretting over it.\nIt would be nice not to be accused of causing everything that inconveniences\nher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s clever.\u201d Grinning, Theon bumped his shoulder\ninto mine as he pulled his plate closer. \u201cAnd now she owes you a debt, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not bring attention to that, shall we?\u201d I smacked\nTheon\u2019s fingers with the back of my knife before he could steal my bread.\n\u201cThat\u2019s my breakfast, Greyjoy. Get your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it tastes better when it\u2019s stolen!\u201d Laughing as he\nprotested, Theon held his hands up in surrender when I pointed my knife at him.\n\u201cI yield, I yield. Your food is safe, Snow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow there\u2019s a lie if I ever heard one.\u201d Robb snorted,\ncurling his arm around his plate when Theon turned to him with a wounded\nexpression. \u201cYou\u2019re a shameless food sneak, Theon. The cooks are all out for\nvengeance over missing platters.\u201d</p><p>With a disdainful sniff, Theon turned back to his own plate.\n\u201cI\u2019m a growing man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bottomless pit, is what you are.\u201d I eyed the\nIronborn boy up and down. \u201cHow are you this weedy if all you do is eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk.\u201d Robb snickered, the smug little shit.\nOne day he would actually reach an awkward growth stage and I was going to\nlaugh <i>so hard</i>. \u201cYou\u2019re barely bigger\nthan the girls, Snow.\u201d</p><p>The was a scraping noise as Father stood up and cleared his\nthroat, drawing every eye in the hall and cutting off my retort. Robb was going\nto get his ass kicked for that comment later during our arms practice. For now,\nI held my tongue and paid attention as Father raised his hand for silence.</p><p>\u201cI have two announcements to make this morning.\u201d Father\nturned and smiled at his wife, placing a hand on the back of her chair. \u201cTo\ncelebrate the anniversary of King Robert\u2019s coronation, my Lady Wife and I shall\nbe renewing our vows in the Godswood. The invitations to our bannermen Houses\nshall be sent later today.\u201d</p><p>A cheer shook the rafters. I laughed and clapped my hands,\nvastly entertained by the dumbstruck look on Catelyn\u2019s face as the Northern\npeople applauded. This was the first step to her gaining full acceptance, and I\nplanned to keep that momentum going.</p><p>\u201cSecond.\u201d Father continued once the ruckus had died down. \u201cWith\nthe blessings and council of my Lady Wife, I have written to King Robert asking\nfor the granting of legitimacy to my natural born son. Once it is official, Jon\nStark will be named the future lord of Moat Cailin and tasked with its\nrestoration.\u201d</p><p>Robb and Theon whooped, pounding me on the back as I gaped\nat my father. Arya shrieked in glee and lunged across the table to throw her\narms around my neck. Even Sansa was smiling, even if it looked a bit stiff with\nconfusion. Baby Rickon had no idea what was going on but he still added his\nvoice to the mess.</p><p>Holy shit yes. My plans were <i>working</i>. Theon actually had manners, Father had told the truth\nabout my birth, Lady Stark had gotten a reality check, and <i>I had actually been legitimized</i>\u2026 </p><p>Fucking right, I was going to Machiavelli the <i>hell</i> out of the Seven Kingdoms. Next up,\nconvincing Father to have Arya fostered with the Mormonts, or at least have her\ntutored as a shieldmaiden by one, and then I was going to get Sansa someone she\ncould have an actual intelligent conversation with.</p><p>Yes, excellent. This pleases me.</p><p>=/=</p>",

Best get a move on\nthat.</p><p>I grinned at my reflection in the mirror, knowing I was\ndressed no differently than the rest of the Stark children and loving how much\nit pissed my dear Auntie off. There was no chance of Catelyn letting me speak\nwith Father without listening in. Perfect. </p><p>Now if only my resting bitch face would start being\nintimidating again instead of sullen, that would be just grand. Stupid pretty\nboy face.</p><p>/\u2026/</p><p>\u201cYour nameday is coming up.\u201d Robb mentioned, just as he had\nevery day for the last handful. My dear Auntie\u2019s glare burned against my back\nas she lurked and waited for me to turn on Robb. Old Gods, but that woman\u2019s\nblind prejudice was annoying. \u201cDo you know what you\u2019re going to ask Father\nfor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think\u2026 I\u2019d like to know who my mother was. And why Father\nchose to raise me here instead of leaving me with her.\u201d Carefully not looking\nover my shoulder at where I knew the Lady Stark was spying on interactions, I\nmade sure to keep my voice thoughtful. \u201cI\u2019m almost a man grown. I think I\u2019m old\nenough to understand if it\u2026 if it was something terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d The future lord of Winterfell looked thoughtful, and\nnodded his head as he clapped a hand to my shoulder. \u201cIf anyone deserves to\nknow it\u2019s you, brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, one can hope.\u201d With a chuckle, I shook my head. \u201cNow\ncome on, Robb. Let\u2019s finish putting this away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Sighing as he looked at how much was left to take\ncare of, Robb grumbled but set too willingly enough. \u201cCan\u2019t leave a job half\ndone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cT\u2019would be unfitting of a son of House Stark.\u201d I agreed with\njust enough mockery in my tone to make Robb laugh and the Lady Stark bristle.\nHonestly, the woman was so easy to rile up. It was actually a bit sad.</p><p>/\u2026/</p><p>\u201cFather, <i>please</i>.\u201d\nI may have arranged for Lady Stark to follow me into the Godswood today when I\nwent to confront Ned Stark about my true origins, but it still bothered me to\nknow that she was lurking while I asked my father for honesty. Stupid bint. My\nirritation made my voice crack with suppressed emotion. \u201cPlease, I deserve to\nknow. If it\u2019s a secret you\u2019re keeping to preserve a Lady\u2019s honour, I swear by\nthe Old God\u2019s I won\u2019t speak of it! I just wish to know her <i>name</i>. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swore to your mother to keep you safe, Jon. You are my\nblood.\u201d Ned Stark was a quiet man, but he had enough determination to grind\nmountains to dust. A brilliant attribute when you needed to ration supplies\nthrough a decade long winter. Not so endearing when trying to get him to say\nsomething he wanted to stay secret. \u201cThat is enough for me. Let that be the end\nof it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine then, if you won\u2019t tell me my mother\u2019s name\u2026 then tell\nme my fathers!\u201d The blood drained out of my father\u2019s face, and guilt rose in my\nchest. I forged onwards anyway, because this needed doing if we were going to\nsurvive the Long Night without worrying about knives in our backs. \u201cPeople talk\nabout me, and I hear it all the time. \u2018The Honorable Ned Stark\u2019s only sin\u2019,\nthey call me. But they don\u2019t know you, Father. Not like I do. Not enough to\nknow that\u2026 you wouldn\u2019t. Not after you wed, not after you swore an oath. Even\nif Lady Stark was <i>supposed </i>to be your\nelder brother\u2019s wife\u2026 you would never dishonour her that way.\u201d</p><p>Father\u2019s grip on the Heart Tree\u2019s bark was desperate as his\neyes searched my face. I swallowed, hating the pain I saw in his eyes. \u201cI\ndon\u2019t\u2026 It matters not who sired me, not truly. <i>You</i> are my father in all the ways that count, and aye, your blood\nis in my veins, but\u2026 it was Lord Brandon who sired me, wasn\u2019t it. With Lady\nAshara Dayne. If I had been a girl\u2026 you could have left me there, let me be a\nSand. But I was a boy, and the only son of Rickard Stark\u2019s eldest son. That\u2019s\nwhy everyone says Lady Ashara\u2019s <i>daughter</i>\nwas stillborn. It was a misdirection to cover your tracks, because Lord\nBrandon\u2019s son, even a bastard one, could have a stronger claim than your sons\nand-\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. Jon, please. That\u2019s enough. That is\u2026 that is more\nthan enough.\u201d Strong, sword calloused hands gripped my shoulders, and stern\ngrey eyes held mine for a long moment before my Father\u2019s expression softened.\n\u201cI can see now, how much this has troubled you. You\u2019ve never liked the thought\nof causing problems for Robb, and I can well believe that you would draw the\nworst possible conclusion\u2026 Aye, I suppose there\u2019s nothing for it now.\nEspecially not with that sort of rumour taking root\u2026\u201d</p><p>I forced my jaw to relax and my breathing to steady.\n\u201cFather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother was not Ashara Dayne, Jon. And your father was\nnot my brother. Would that\u2026 would that they <i>had</i>\nbeen your parents. Perhaps this would be a simple thing to speak of.\u201d Old, deep\npain etched lines in my father\u2019s face, and for a horrible moment I imagined it.\nOf being the only one still remaining of my siblings. Of Robb slain by\ntreachery, Sansa stolen away by our enemies, Arya and Bran losing themselves to\nvengeance and madness, Rickon\u2019s memories of us fading away until he forgot us\nentirely\u2026 Father closed his eyes, seeming to gather his strength before he\ncould look me in the eye again. \u201cYou will always be my son, Jon. My blood is in\nyour veins, Jon. As is\u2026 as is the blood of my sister, Lyanna.\u201d</p><p>I had been hoping for it, expecting it even, but still <i>hearing him say it</i> made my breath catch\nlike I had just been hit. There in front of the Heart Tree, with the truth\nringing in my ears, all I could manage to do was blink. \u201cBut\u2026 that would make\nmy father\u2026 but I don\u2019t <i>want</i> to be a\nTargaryen! I want to be a Stark! Father, don\u2019t tell anyone else!\u201d</p><p>Sputtering a relieved laugh my father shook me gently until\nI stopped whining, and then he pulled me into an embrace. \u201cI promise, Jon. No\none else will ever know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm\u2026 maybe\u2026 uh, maybe <i>one</i>\nother person.\u201d I felt my father stiffen, and I firmly kept my face pressed into\nthe fur of his collar. \u201cMaybe\u2026 I think it would be okay for you to tell Lady\nStark? Maybe then she\u2019ll agree to have a proper marriage ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon, I\u2026 I know Cat hasn\u2019t always been kind to you. Are you\nsure you wish for her to know?\u201d Father pushed me back so he could see my face.\nI pouted shamelessly, because proper hugs were stupidly scarce in this\nmachismo-laden hellscape. \u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t say yes because you want to make things\neasier for me, Jon. I can handle an argument with my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you want to get married in front of the Heart Tree.\u201d I\npointed out sullenly, keeping my eyes firmly on my father\u2019s chin. \u201cAnd you\ncan\u2019t do that while you keep secrets from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been three and ten years, Jon.\u201d Father sighed, clear\nlonging in his words even as he pushed his own wants aside for the sake of his\nduty. \u201cIf she were willing to truly join the North she would have said\nsomething to me by now.\u201d</p><p>Oh, that comment was going to <i>burn</i>. I know my dear eavesdropping Auntie has never felt welcome in\nthe North, and now she knows <i>why</i>.\nThis is delicious and I love it.</p><p>\u201cTell her anyway, Father.\u201d Meeting those grey eyes again, I\noffered up a wry smile. \u201cPerhaps this will be enough for her to make that\noffer. Perhaps it will calm her fears about me hurting Robb. Perhaps she will\nsimply continue to ignore the fact that I exist until she cannot avoid it any\nlonger. Regardless of the outcome, she at least deserves to know that you have\nnever broken your oaths to her. She deserves to know that another oath bound\nyou to silence, for all our sakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a good boy, Jon.\u201d Father smiled, embracing me again\nas he kissed my hair. \u201cNever forget that kindness. It is a great gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t, Father.\u201d I smiled back and leaned into the\nstrength of the only father I would ever acknowledge. \u201cAfter all, I have you to\nshow me what to do.\u201d</p><p>/\u2026/</p><p>The next morning, I could see that Father had spoken to his\nwife. The way she looked at me\u2026 Catelyn was ashamed of herself. Was writhing in\nguilt of her own making like a worm on a hook. Doubtless she was remembering\nthe promise she had made to her Seven Gods, the promise she had broken so very\nquickly when she learned that I had lived through my fever.</p><p>This was no less than she deserved.</p><p>I took my seat at the head table without sparing her more\nthan a glance. Catelyn\u2019s eyes were reddened and heavy from a night of weeping.\nFor once, there was no transparent attempt to have me sit elsewhere, removed\nfrom my family. Sansa wrinkled her nose at me, only having recently learned\nwhat the word \u2018bastard\u2019 meant, thanks to the Southron influences in her life.</p><p>Robb and Theon glanced at Lady Stark, but did not hesitate\nto draw me into their morning conversation once I was seated.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Robb kept his voice quiet enough not to be heard\nbeyond our small huddle. \u201cDid you get the nameday gift you wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d Inclining my head, I answered just as quietly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like we thought. She\u2019s dead, but Father\u2019s still trying to protect her\nmemory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he gave you a name?\u201d Theon questioned, sharp eyes\nscanning slowly over the hall for listening ears.</p><p>\u201cHe did. I asked him to tell Lady Stark.\u201d I shrugged when\nthey both looked at me strangely. \u201cPerhaps now she will stop fretting over it.\nIt would be nice not to be accused of causing everything that inconveniences\nher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s clever.\u201d Grinning, Theon bumped his shoulder\ninto mine as he pulled his plate closer. \u201cAnd now she owes you a debt, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not bring attention to that, shall we?\u201d I smacked\nTheon\u2019s fingers with the back of my knife before he could steal my bread.\n\u201cThat\u2019s my breakfast, Greyjoy. Get your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it tastes better when it\u2019s stolen!\u201d Laughing as he\nprotested, Theon held his hands up in surrender when I pointed my knife at him.\n\u201cI yield, I yield. Your food is safe, Snow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow there\u2019s a lie if I ever heard one.\u201d Robb snorted,\ncurling his arm around his plate when Theon turned to him with a wounded\nexpression. \u201cYou\u2019re a shameless food sneak, Theon. The cooks are all out for\nvengeance over missing platters.\u201d</p><p>With a disdainful sniff, Theon turned back to his own plate.\n\u201cI\u2019m a growing man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bottomless pit, is what you are.\u201d I eyed the\nIronborn boy up and down. \u201cHow are you this weedy if all you do is eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk.\u201d Robb snickered, the smug little shit.\nOne day he would actually reach an awkward growth stage and I was going to\nlaugh <i>so hard</i>. \u201cYou\u2019re barely bigger\nthan the girls, Snow.\u201d</p><p>The was a scraping noise as Father stood up and cleared his\nthroat, drawing every eye in the hall and cutting off my retort. Robb was going\nto get his ass kicked for that comment later during our arms practice. For now,\nI held my tongue and paid attention as Father raised his hand for silence.</p><p>\u201cI have two announcements to make this morning.\u201d Father\nturned and smiled at his wife, placing a hand on the back of her chair. \u201cTo\ncelebrate the anniversary of King Robert\u2019s coronation, my Lady Wife and I shall\nbe renewing our vows in the Godswood. The invitations to our bannermen Houses\nshall be sent later today.\u201d</p><p>A cheer shook the rafters. I laughed and clapped my hands,\nvastly entertained by the dumbstruck look on Catelyn\u2019s face as the Northern\npeople applauded. This was the first step to her gaining full acceptance, and I\nplanned to keep that momentum going.</p><p>\u201cSecond.\u201d Father continued once the ruckus had died down. \u201cWith\nthe blessings and council of my Lady Wife, I have written to King Robert asking\nfor the granting of legitimacy to my natural born son. Once it is official, Jon\nStark will be named the future lord of Moat Cailin and tasked with its\nrestoration.\u201d</p><p>Robb and Theon whooped, pounding me on the back as I gaped\nat my father. Arya shrieked in glee and lunged across the table to throw her\narms around my neck. Even Sansa was smiling, even if it looked a bit stiff with\nconfusion. Baby Rickon had no idea what was going on but he still added his\nvoice to the mess.</p><p>Holy shit yes. My plans were <i>working</i>. Theon actually had manners, Father had told the truth\nabout my birth, Lady Stark had gotten a reality check, and <i>I had actually been legitimized</i>\u2026 </p><p>Fucking right, I was going to Machiavelli the <i>hell</i> out of the Seven Kingdoms. Next up,\nconvincing Father to have Arya fostered with the Mormonts, or at least have her\ntutored as a shieldmaiden by one, and then I was going to get Sansa someone she\ncould have an actual intelligent conversation with.</p><p>Yes, excellent. This pleases me.</p><p>=/=</p>",

Staring at my reflection in my\ndressing table mirror, I tried to make an ugly face and only managed to look\npouty. Ech. I was conventionally attractive in my life <i>before</i> this one, but Ageon \u2018Jon Snow\u2019 Targaryen-Stark was <i>supernaturally</i> good looking.</p><p>It was actually a little upsetting. I was aesthetically\npleasing, yes, but not at all my own type. If I <i>had</i> to be reborn as a man in this hope-forsaken hellworld, the\nleast the old gods could have done is fashioned me a meatsuit that catered to\nmy personal tastes.</p>[[MORE]]<p>I spared a wistful thought for the Mormonts, with their\nstrong backs and lovely broad shoulders, before I dismissed the images with a\nresigned sigh. Nope, it was all dainty Targargyen features and the rangy\nleanness of the Starks for me.</p><p>Fuckers.</p><p>Grimacing one last time at my reflection, I tied back my\nhair and finished getting ready for the day. Stuck as I was in Winterfell and\nwith no desire to draw unwanted attention, my ability to influence the events\nto come was limited to the Starks. Which was, in my humble opinion, <i>more</i> than enough.</p><p>People always underestimated the Starks. It was baffling. In\na feudal society like Westeros there was <i>nothing</i>\nmore dangerous than a loyal people with a loyal lord. In Robert\u2019s Rebellion, <i>only</i> the Northern forces had answered in\nfull when the Banners were called to Arms.</p><p>The North answered without hesitation when the Stark in\nWinterfell called for them. The King in the North, and the North remembered it.\nA King uncrowned, a King untitled, but a true King nevertheless. Torrhen Stark\nmay have bent his knee\u2026 but he <i>had not</i>\nbared his throat.</p><p>Winterfell was a fortress of ice, untouched by sun or flame.\nI knew there were weaknesses, cracks in the foundation left behind by the\nwildfires of Robert\u2019s Rebellion. If left alone those fissures they would bring\ndestruction, like melt-water under snowcaps just waiting to bring half a\nmountain down on unsuspecting heads.</p><p>Good thing I was a manipulative little shit, and I knew\nexactly how to start doing away with those weaknesses. In this case I needed to\nstart at the top.</p><p>No one had done quite as much damage to the Stark\u2019s good\nfortunes as Catelyn Tully, and so the Lady Stark\u2019s attitude would need a\nlittle\u2026 adjustment. Which I was <i>more</i>\nthan willing to do now that Rickon was safely born. If she went nuts again and\nneeded to be removed I still had a full complement of Stark Wargs to advise and\ninfluence for the sake of preserving all life on the planet.</p><p>Wishywashy fishwives, blech. The only useful thing she ever\nmanaged to do was make more Starks. After living with her prejudiced,\nthoughtless cruelty for thirteen years I was more than ready to break her\ninflexible little mind in half. Which was my plan for today.

That\u2019s enough. That is\u2026 that is more\nthan enough.\u201d Strong, sword calloused hands gripped my shoulders, and stern\ngrey eyes held mine for a long moment before my Father\u2019s expression softened.\n\u201cI can see now, how much this has troubled you. You\u2019ve never liked the thought\nof causing problems for Robb, and I can well believe that you would draw the\nworst possible conclusion\u2026 Aye, I suppose there\u2019s nothing for it now.\nEspecially not with that sort of rumour taking root\u2026\u201d</p><p>I forced my jaw to relax and my breathing to steady.\n\u201cFather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother was not Ashara Dayne, Jon. And your father was\nnot my brother. Would that\u2026 would that they <i>had</i>\nbeen your parents. Perhaps this would be a simple thing to speak of.\u201d Old, deep\npain etched lines in my father\u2019s face, and for a horrible moment I imagined it.\nOf being the only one still remaining of my siblings. Of Robb slain by\ntreachery, Sansa stolen away by our enemies, Arya and Bran losing themselves to\nvengeance and madness, Rickon\u2019s memories of us fading away until he forgot us\nentirely\u2026 Father closed his eyes, seeming to gather his strength before he\ncould look me in the eye again. \u201cYou will always be my son, Jon. My blood is in\nyour veins, Jon. As is\u2026 as is the blood of my sister, Lyanna.\u201d</p><p>I had been hoping for it, expecting it even, but still <i>hearing him say it</i> made my breath catch\nlike I had just been hit. There in front of the Heart Tree, with the truth\nringing in my ears, all I could manage to do was blink. \u201cBut\u2026 that would make\nmy father\u2026 but I don\u2019t <i>want</i> to be a\nTargaryen! I want to be a Stark! Father, don\u2019t tell anyone else!\u201d</p><p>Sputtering a relieved laugh my father shook me gently until\nI stopped whining, and then he pulled me into an embrace. \u201cI promise, Jon. No\none else will ever know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm\u2026 maybe\u2026 uh, maybe <i>one</i>\nother person.\u201d I felt my father stiffen, and I firmly kept my face pressed into\nthe fur of his collar. \u201cMaybe\u2026 I think it would be okay for you to tell Lady\nStark? Maybe then she\u2019ll agree to have a proper marriage ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon, I\u2026 I know Cat hasn\u2019t always been kind to you. Are you\nsure you wish for her to know?\u201d Father pushed me back so he could see my face.\nI pouted shamelessly, because proper hugs were stupidly scarce in this\nmachismo-laden hellscape. \u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t say yes because you want to make things\neasier for me, Jon. I can handle an argument with my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you want to get married in front of the Heart Tree.\u201d I\npointed out sullenly, keeping my eyes firmly on my father\u2019s chin. \u201cAnd you\ncan\u2019t do that while you keep secrets from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been three and ten years, Jon.\u201d Father sighed, clear\nlonging in his words even as he pushed his own wants aside for the sake of his\nduty. \u201cIf she were willing to truly join the North she would have said\nsomething to me by now.\u201d</p><p>Oh, that comment was going to <i>burn</i>. I know my dear eavesdropping Auntie has never felt welcome in\nthe North, and now she knows <i>why</i>.\nThis is delicious and I love it.</p><p>\u201cTell her anyway, Father.\u201d Meeting those grey eyes again, I\noffered up a wry smile. \u201cPerhaps this will be enough for her to make that\noffer. Perhaps it will calm her fears about me hurting Robb. Perhaps she will\nsimply continue to ignore the fact that I exist until she cannot avoid it any\nlonger. Regardless of the outcome, she at least deserves to know that you have\nnever broken your oaths to her. She deserves to know that another oath bound\nyou to silence, for all our sakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a good boy, Jon.\u201d Father smiled, embracing me again\nas he kissed my hair. \u201cNever forget that kindness. It is a great gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t, Father.\u201d I smiled back and leaned into the\nstrength of the only father I would ever acknowledge. \u201cAfter all, I have you to\nshow me what to do.\u201d</p><p>/\u2026/</p><p>The next morning, I could see that Father had spoken to his\nwife. The way she looked at me\u2026 Catelyn was ashamed of herself. Was writhing in\nguilt of her own making like a worm on a hook. Doubtless she was remembering\nthe promise she had made to her Seven Gods, the promise she had broken so very\nquickly when she learned that I had lived through my fever.</p><p>This was no less than she deserved.</p><p>I took my seat at the head table without sparing her more\nthan a glance. Catelyn\u2019s eyes were reddened and heavy from a night of weeping.\nFor once, there was no transparent attempt to have me sit elsewhere, removed\nfrom my family. Sansa wrinkled her nose at me, only having recently learned\nwhat the word \u2018bastard\u2019 meant, thanks to the Southron influences in her life.</p><p>Robb and Theon glanced at Lady Stark, but did not hesitate\nto draw me into their morning conversation once I was seated.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Robb kept his voice quiet enough not to be heard\nbeyond our small huddle. \u201cDid you get the nameday gift you wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d Inclining my head, I answered just as quietly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like we thought. She\u2019s dead, but Father\u2019s still trying to protect her\nmemory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he gave you a name?\u201d Theon questioned, sharp eyes\nscanning slowly over the hall for listening ears.</p><p>\u201cHe did. I asked him to tell Lady Stark.\u201d I shrugged when\nthey both looked at me strangely. \u201cPerhaps now she will stop fretting over it.\nIt would be nice not to be accused of causing everything that inconveniences\nher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s clever.\u201d Grinning, Theon bumped his shoulder\ninto mine as he pulled his plate closer. \u201cAnd now she owes you a debt, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not bring attention to that, shall we?\u201d I smacked\nTheon\u2019s fingers with the back of my knife before he could steal my bread.\n\u201cThat\u2019s my breakfast, Greyjoy. Get your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it tastes better when it\u2019s stolen!\u201d Laughing as he\nprotested, Theon held his hands up in surrender when I pointed my knife at him.\n\u201cI yield, I yield. Your food is safe, Snow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow there\u2019s a lie if I ever heard one.\u201d Robb snorted,\ncurling his arm around his plate when Theon turned to him with a wounded\nexpression. \u201cYou\u2019re a shameless food sneak, Theon. The cooks are all out for\nvengeance over missing platters.\u201d</p><p>With a disdainful sniff, Theon turned back to his own plate.\n\u201cI\u2019m a growing man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bottomless pit, is what you are.\u201d I eyed the\nIronborn boy up and down. \u201cHow are you this weedy if all you do is eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk.\u201d Robb snickered, the smug little shit.\nOne day he would actually reach an awkward growth stage and I was going to\nlaugh <i>so hard</i>. \u201cYou\u2019re barely bigger\nthan the girls, Snow.\u201d</p><p>The was a scraping noise as Father stood up and cleared his\nthroat, drawing every eye in the hall and cutting off my retort. Robb was going\nto get his ass kicked for that comment later during our arms practice. For now,\nI held my tongue and paid attention as Father raised his hand for silence.</p><p>\u201cI have two announcements to make this morning.\u201d Father\nturned and smiled at his wife, placing a hand on the back of her chair. \u201cTo\ncelebrate the anniversary of King Robert\u2019s coronation, my Lady Wife and I shall\nbe renewing our vows in the Godswood. The invitations to our bannermen Houses\nshall be sent later today.\u201d</p><p>A cheer shook the rafters. I laughed and clapped my hands,\nvastly entertained by the dumbstruck look on Catelyn\u2019s face as the Northern\npeople applauded. This was the first step to her gaining full acceptance, and I\nplanned to keep that momentum going.</p><p>\u201cSecond.\u201d Father continued once the ruckus had died down. \u201cWith\nthe blessings and council of my Lady Wife, I have written to King Robert asking\nfor the granting of legitimacy to my natural born son. Once it is official, Jon\nStark will be named the future lord of Moat Cailin and tasked with its\nrestoration.\u201d</p><p>Robb and Theon whooped, pounding me on the back as I gaped\nat my father. Arya shrieked in glee and lunged across the table to throw her\narms around my neck. Even Sansa was smiling, even if it looked a bit stiff with\nconfusion. Baby Rickon had no idea what was going on but he still added his\nvoice to the mess.</p><p>Holy shit yes. My plans were <i>working</i>. Theon actually had manners, Father had told the truth\nabout my birth, Lady Stark had gotten a reality check, and <i>I had actually been legitimized</i>\u2026 </p><p>Fucking right, I was going to Machiavelli the <i>hell</i> out of the Seven Kingdoms. Next up,\nconvincing Father to have Arya fostered with the Mormonts, or at least have her\ntutored as a shieldmaiden by one, and then I was going to get Sansa someone she\ncould have an actual intelligent conversation with.</p><p>Yes, excellent. This pleases me.</p><p>=/=</p>",
                "content": "<p>(3/32 SI Promptfest)</p><p>By the Old Gods, I really was <i>ridiculously</i> pretty for a man. Staring at my reflection in my\ndressing table mirror, I tried to make an ugly face and only managed to look\npouty. Ech. I was conventionally attractive in my life <i>before</i> this one, but Ageon &lsquo;Jon Snow&rsquo; Targaryen-Stark was <i>supernaturally</i> good looking.</p><p>It was actually a little upsetting. I was aesthetically\npleasing, yes, but not at all my own type. If I <i>had</i> to be reborn as a man in this hope-forsaken hellworld, the\nleast the old gods could have done is fashioned me a meatsuit that catered to\nmy personal tastes.</p><p>I spared a wistful thought for the Mormonts, with their\nstrong backs and lovely broad shoulders, before I dismissed the images with a\nresigned sigh. Nope, it was all dainty Targargyen features and the rangy\nleanness of the Starks for me.</p><p>Fuckers.</p><p>Grimacing one last time at my reflection, I tied back my\nhair and finished getting ready for the day. Stuck as I was in Winterfell and\nwith no desire to draw unwanted attention, my ability to influence the events\nto come was limited to the Starks. Which was, in my humble opinion, <i>more</i> than enough.</p><p>People always underestimated the Starks. It was baffling. In\na feudal society like Westeros there was <i>nothing</i>\nmore dangerous than a loyal people with a loyal lord. In Robert&rsquo;s Rebellion, <i>only</i> the Northern forces had answered in\nfull when the Banners were called to Arms.</p><p>The North answered without hesitation when the Stark in\nWinterfell called for them. The King in the North, and the North remembered it.\nA King uncrowned, a King untitled, but a true King nevertheless. Torrhen Stark\nmay have bent his knee&hellip; but he <i>had not</i>\nbared his throat.</p><p>Winterfell was a fortress of ice, untouched by sun or flame.\nI knew there were weaknesses, cracks in the foundation left behind by the\nwildfires of Robert&rsquo;s Rebellion. If left alone those fissures they would bring\ndestruction, like melt-water under snowcaps just waiting to bring half a\nmountain down on unsuspecting heads.</p><p>Good thing I was a manipulative little shit, and I knew\nexactly how to start doing away with those weaknesses. In this case I needed to\nstart at the top.</p><p>No one had done quite as much damage to the Stark&rsquo;s good\nfortunes as Catelyn Tully, and so the Lady Stark&rsquo;s attitude would need a\nlittle&hellip; adjustment. Which I was <i>more</i>\nthan willing to do now that Rickon was safely born. If she went nuts again and\nneeded to be removed I still had a full complement of Stark Wargs to advise and\ninfluence for the sake of preserving all life on the planet.</p><p>Wishywashy fishwives, blech. The only useful thing she ever\nmanaged to do was make more Starks. After living with her prejudiced,\nthoughtless cruelty for thirteen years I was more than ready to break her\ninflexible little mind in half. Which was my plan for today. Best get a move on\nthat.</p><p>I grinned at my reflection in the mirror, knowing I was\ndressed no differently than the rest of the Stark children and loving how much\nit pissed my dear Auntie off. There was no chance of Catelyn letting me speak\nwith Father without listening in. Perfect. </p><p>Now if only my resting bitch face would start being\nintimidating again instead of sullen, that would be just grand. Stupid pretty\nboy face.</p><p>/&hellip;/</p><p>&ldquo;Your nameday is coming up.&rdquo; Robb mentioned, just as he had\nevery day for the last handful. My dear Auntie&rsquo;s glare burned against my back\nas she lurked and waited for me to turn on Robb. Old Gods, but that woman&rsquo;s\nblind prejudice was annoying. &ldquo;Do you know what you&rsquo;re going to ask Father\nfor?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think&hellip; I&rsquo;d like to know who my mother was. And why Father\nchose to raise me here instead of leaving me with her.&rdquo; Carefully not looking\nover my shoulder at where I knew the Lady Stark was spying on interactions, I\nmade sure to keep my voice thoughtful. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost a man grown. I think I&rsquo;m old\nenough to understand if it&hellip; if it was something terrible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip;&rdquo; The future lord of Winterfell looked thoughtful, and\nnodded his head as he clapped a hand to my shoulder. &ldquo;If anyone deserves to\nknow it&rsquo;s you, brother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, one can hope.&rdquo; With a chuckle, I shook my head. &ldquo;Now\ncome on, Robb. Let&rsquo;s finish putting this away.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aye.&rdquo; Sighing as he looked at how much was left to take\ncare of, Robb grumbled but set too willingly enough. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t leave a job half\ndone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;T&rsquo;would be unfitting of a son of House Stark.&rdquo; I agreed with\njust enough mockery in my tone to make Robb laugh and the Lady Stark bristle.\nHonestly, the woman was so easy to rile up. It was actually a bit sad.</p><p>/&hellip;/</p><p>&ldquo;Father, <i>please</i>.&rdquo;\nI may have arranged for Lady Stark to follow me into the Godswood today when I\nwent to confront Ned Stark about my true origins, but it still bothered me to\nknow that she was lurking while I asked my father for honesty. Stupid bint. My\nirritation made my voice crack with suppressed emotion. &ldquo;Please, I deserve to\nknow. If it&rsquo;s a secret you&rsquo;re keeping to preserve a Lady&rsquo;s honour, I swear by\nthe Old God&rsquo;s I won&rsquo;t speak of it! I just wish to know her <i>name</i>. Please.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I swore to your mother to keep you safe, Jon. You are my\nblood.&rdquo; Ned Stark was a quiet man, but he had enough determination to grind\nmountains to dust. A brilliant attribute when you needed to ration supplies\nthrough a decade long winter. Not so endearing when trying to get him to say\nsomething he wanted to stay secret. &ldquo;That is enough for me. Let that be the end\nof it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine then, if you won&rsquo;t tell me my mother&rsquo;s name&hellip; then tell\nme my fathers!&rdquo; The blood drained out of my father&rsquo;s face, and guilt rose in my\nchest. I forged onwards anyway, because this needed doing if we were going to\nsurvive the Long Night without worrying about knives in our backs. &ldquo;People talk\nabout me, and I hear it all the time. &lsquo;The Honorable Ned Stark&rsquo;s only sin&rsquo;,\nthey call me. But they don&rsquo;t know you, Father. Not like I do. Not enough to\nknow that&hellip; you wouldn&rsquo;t. Not after you wed, not after you swore an oath. Even\nif Lady Stark was <i>supposed </i>to be your\nelder brother&rsquo;s wife&hellip; you would never dishonour her that way.&rdquo;</p><p>Father&rsquo;s grip on the Heart Tree&rsquo;s bark was desperate as his\neyes searched my face. I swallowed, hating the pain I saw in his eyes. &ldquo;I\ndon&rsquo;t&hellip; It matters not who sired me, not truly. <i>You</i> are my father in all the ways that count, and aye, your blood\nis in my veins, but&hellip; it was Lord Brandon who sired me, wasn&rsquo;t it. With Lady\nAshara Dayne. If I had been a girl&hellip; you could have left me there, let me be a\nSand. But I was a boy, and the only son of Rickard Stark&rsquo;s eldest son. That&rsquo;s\nwhy everyone says Lady Ashara&rsquo;s <i>daughter</i>\nwas stillborn. It was a misdirection to cover your tracks, because Lord\nBrandon&rsquo;s son, even a bastard one, could have a stronger claim than your sons\nand-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stop. Jon, please.
