Arya is the character Jon loves the most and he thinks on her in every moment:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"750\" data-orig-width=\"750\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4d05b7fc9f5dd0e82ebf079b8f08015e/tumblr_psssgpadgI1rxjq6h_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"750\" data-orig-width=\"750\"/></figure><p><i>And Arya \u2026 he missed her even more than Robb, skinny little thing that she was, all scraped knees and tangled hair and torn clothes, so fierce and willful. Arya never seemed to fit, no more than he had \u2026 yet she could always make Jon smile. He would give anything to be with her now, to muss up her hair once more and watch her make a face, to hear her finish a sentence with him. (<b>A Game of Thrones, Jon III)</b></i></p><p><i>Jon felt as stiff as a man of sixty years. Dark dreams, he thought, and guilt.His thoughts kept returning to Arya. There is no way I can help her. I put all kin aside when I said my words. If one of my men told me his sister was in peril, I would tell him that was no concern of his. Once a man had said the words his blood was black. Black as a bastard\u2019s heart. He\u2019d had Mikken make a sword for Arya once, a bravo\u2019s blade, made small to fit her hand. Needle. He wondered if she still had it. Stick them with the pointy end, he\u2019d told her, but if she tried to stick the Bastard, it could mean her life.</i></p><p><i>Something about her made him think of Arya, though they looked nothing at all alike. </i><b>\u2014 Jon when he meets Ygritte</b></p><p><i>They had always been close. Jon had their father\u2019s face, as she did. They were the only ones. Robb and Sansa and Bran and even little Rickon all took after the Tullys, with easy smiles and fire in their hair. When Arya had been little, she had been afraid that meant that she was a bastard too. It had been Jon she had gone to in her fear, and Jon who had reassured her.</i></p><p>\u2022 Jon is more political in books than show, we seem him negotiating with the iron bank, confronting with Ramsay, taking decisions about Mance and Gilly babies and more, also Jon is not that perfect in books as in show, he have selfish thoughts sometimes but at the end he tries his best. </p><p>\u2022 His relationship with Ghost is deeper in books, he can warg him and is always by his side.</p><p>With all this changes between books and show we can assume that yes, Jon is gonna be resurrected but we don\u2019t know if in the same way, but he will be darker after he comes back, he will abandoned the nights watch to save \u201cArya\u201d and is gonna be king in the north but we will see it in a different way than the show.</p><p>He is gonna be a secret Targaryen too, and also ride a Dragon because in books we have the prophecy of the three heads of the dragon</p><p><b><span class=\"npf_color_joey\">\u201cHe has a song. He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire,\u201d Rhaegar tells the nurse before looking directly at Daenerys and saying, \u201cThere must be one more. The dragon has three heads.\u201d</span></b></p><p>So with that we can assume we will see Jon and Daenerys riding the dragons in books also one more Targaryen (<strike>maybe Aemon or Tyrion book reades knows what im talking about</strike> )</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"324\" data-orig-width=\"400\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/db94a61c2be9b1246b97a5b49be96256/tumblr_psssgqAPAQ1rxjq6h_400.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"324\" data-orig-width=\"400\"/></figure><p>Also I think he is gonna do more important things to the long night, is very posible we see Jonerys in books too and Jon killing her at the end, but I think is gonna be played different with the Azor Ahai prophecy because I have the strong theory Jon is Azor Ahai:</p><p>\u201c<i><span class=\"npf_color_rachel\"><b>There will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him.\u201d </b></span><b>\u2014 Books prophecy.</b></i></p><p>Azor Ahai killed Nissa Nissa who was his wife. In order to unleash the powers of the sword Lightbringer so that he could defeat the darkness of the Great Other, he had to sacrifice her by plunging it into her heart. I think we will see that with Jon i Daenerys in a very unexpected way, I mean not intentionally way.</p><p>\u201c<b><span style=\"color: #7c5cff\">A<i>ccording</i></span><i><span style=\"color: #7c5cff\"> to prophecy, our champion will be reborn to wake dragons from stone and reforge the great sword Lightbringer that defeated the darkness those thousands of years ago. If the old tales are true, a terrible weapon forged with a loving wife&rsquo;s heart. Part of me thinks man was well rid of it, but great power requires great sacrifice. That much at least the Lord of Light is clear on.\u201d </span>\u2014<span style=\"color: #7c5cff\"> </span>THOROS OF MYR.</i></b></p><div class=\"npf_row\"><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"629\" data-orig-width=\"602\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6e4310dd5f253fac36e4f6d35ebc5c90/tumblr_psssgqc6MD1rxjq6h_640.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"629\" data-orig-width=\"602\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"777\" data-orig-width=\"600\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e3209c90d8f05c5f5c63036e65d8ed6e/tumblr_psssgqTwYh1rxjq6h_640.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"777\" data-orig-width=\"600\"/></figure></div><p>In conclusion I really have big hopes for Jon finale arc in books, since there is no night king in books I expect Jon contributes to the battle against the others in a really original way, also his real identity as a Targeryen be more important in the history even i he has the same ending in books if he is journey is good it will don\u2019t matter. <strike>Also he go to the wall by his choice not because he is exiled. </strike></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"360\" data-orig-width=\"480\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a3caea63fadeb052325948a9c2c228a3/tumblr_psst5oAnAG1rxjq6h_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"360\" data-orig-width=\"480\"/></figure>",

                "content": "<p>Everyday for about 6 months, Tormund has walked past Officer Snow on his way in and out of work. He&rsquo;d walk past him in the morning, sunlight bathing the young officer in a golden glow, and then again in the evening, moonlight making him look ethereal with his pale skin and dark eyes. </p><p>Tormund&rsquo;s friends all love to tease him that he&rsquo;s got a school boy crush on Officer Snow, and he can&rsquo;t really argue. The man&rsquo;s gorgeous, his smile makes Tormund&rsquo;s heart flutter, and he has a deep voice that&rsquo;s equal parts smooth and gravelly. In any other situation he&rsquo;d have asked him out months ago, but there&rsquo;s something about Officer Snow that intimidates Tormund.</p><p>He may be a 6&rdquo;2 lumberjack who&rsquo;s built like a grizzly bear, but something about Snow intimidates him. He&rsquo;s a mounted officer, and the way he sits on his huge black horse, straight backed, hat perched smartly on his pretty head, towering over even Tormund, makes him look regal. How can he be expected to ask someone like that out? Officer Snow exudes power and authority, in a borderline godly way, so Tormund contents himself with their daily &ldquo;Good Morning Tormund&rdquo;, &ldquo;Good Morning Officer Snow&rdquo;.</p><p>He goes on like that for a while, up until one evening, he&rsquo;s bone tired on his way home, and he spots Officer Snow in the distance. He&rsquo;s distracted, looking forward to a little friendly interaction after a hard day of manual labour and he doesn&rsquo;t pay attention to where he&rsquo;s going. He strolls head first, full speed into a street lamp, knocking himself to the floor. </p><p>He vaguely registers the sound of a horse clip-clopping down the street getting louder and louder. He opens his eyes and sees Officer Snow riding swiftly towards him, hopping down off his horse and offering out his arm. When he pulls Tormund to his feet, the redheads shocked. </p><p>Officer Snow&rsquo;s short. Really short. Okay maybe really short is an overstatement, but he can&rsquo;t be more than 5&rdquo;8, a good few inches shorter than Tormund and much slighter too. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo; He asks, taking his hat off where it&rsquo;d moved in his haste to get to Tormund and shaking out his hair.</p><p>He finds himself incapable of replying because not only is Officer Snow tiny, but he&rsquo;s been hiding a head of raven black curls under there the whole time and Tormund can&rsquo;t cope.

Being so out of practice, and with unfamiliar skates he\u2019s hesitant to embarrass himself in front of all the Free Folk, but when he looks back at Tormund\u2019s face, the pure innocent joy in his bright blue eyes, he just can\u2019t say no.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut I warn you Tormund, I\u2019m not going to be very good.\u201d he says as the taller man pulls him up and they start heading for the lake.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry Jon,\u201d Tormund replies, slinging an arm around his shoulders and pulling him close,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll keep you on your feet.\u201d<br></p><p>***</p><p>Of course, Jon\u2019s worries turn out to come to nothing. As soon as he put on the skates and felt the ice beneath him, he was off, taking to it like a bird to flight, laughing as Tormund struggled to keep up with him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNot very good my ass Jon Snow!\u201d The taller man shouts at him as he darts around the lake,\u00a0\u201cWhere did a southern boy like you learn to skate?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m from the North!\u201d He shouts back in retort, laughing like he hasn\u2019t in years,\u00a0\u201cWe used to always go skating on the frozen river, maybe an hour from Winterfell.\u201d<br></p><p>He slows down to allow Tormund to catch up to him, breathless from the laughter and exertion of racing about.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo why would you tell me you aren\u2019t very good, hmm?\u201d Tormund asks, sidling up next to Jon, taking his hand as they start to skate in sync.\u00a0\u201cI was hoping to impress you with my skills, show you I\u2019m more than just a pretty face.\u201d he says with a grin.\u00a0<br></p><p>Jon smiles at that.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI am impressed Tormund,\u201d he replies\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re relatively agile for a man your size.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Tormund shoves him at that, and Jon\u2019s bursting into giggles again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI was never the best of my siblings,\u201d Jon continues, moving closer to Tormund again,\u00a0\u201cAfter so long I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d remember how to do it.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI dread to think how good the other were, if you were the worst of them.
