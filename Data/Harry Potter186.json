But, this year just Alice (our of her fam) gets one &amp; James is like super proud/happy about it. &amp; like Ginny pulls Mrs. Weasley aside &amp; asks \u201cwhy did you make Alice one?\u201d (or something) &amp; she basically says like I know I will be making more for their kids or I always knew i\u2019d be making her one. Thank you!!</p><p><i><b>Pairing : jalice</b></i></p><p><b>Genre: FLUFF</b></p><p>Every single year the longbottoms, malfoys , scammanders , finnigans and woods go to the burrows with the wotters , some of them just pop round to give presents and some (like the longbottoms and malfoys ) stay longer. The main Christmas tradition of the wotters was to receive a sweater from Mrs weasley , this was strictly a wotters only tradition and the families that joined in understood after all they had their own family traditions too. Alice was perfectly okay with waiting and watching as James opened his sweater and eagerly pulled it over his head whilst beaming , it practically made her Christmas every year. </p><p>This was the secound year that Alice and James has been dating and James was even more excited for Christmas than ever before , he would my shut up about it. Hislist had been written in November, the day after his birthday , and he had made about 300 changes since then. He used mistletoe on Alice as much as possible , just because it was Christmas. Alice didn\u2019t mind but the whole school was getting pretty bothered with James\u2019 festive cheer.</p><p>He ran around school wearing a scarf and earmuffs singing Christmas carols at the top of his lungs using the excuse it\u2019s Christmas and he can do whatever he wants , mcgonagall disagreed and he was in a detention every Saturday, but that didn\u2019t stop James. </p><p>When school was over all James would talk about was going to the burrow on Christmas. </p><p>One night when Alice was around his house, the two of them were just lead together in silence on his bed. \u201cDo you know what James?\u201d Alice said breaking the silence and playing with the strings on James\u2019 hoodie.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He replied softly whilst smiling at the way Alice was so close to him and playing with his hoodie. </p><p>\u201cThis is the first time since the lead up to Christmas you\u2019ve not mentioned Christmas\u201d Alice said smiling.</p><p>James chuckled ,\u201d it\u2019s because it\u2019s the first time it\u2019s just been the two of us , your so cute all I want to do is look at you\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d Alice said looking into James\u2019 eyes.\u201dis that <i>all</i> you want to do?\u201d</p><p>James got a smug smile on his face as he avoided eye contact , \u201cobviously not\u201d he said now playing with the string of alices pyjama bottoms. </p><p>James quickly connected their lips , whilst cupping alices face , he felt her melt into the kiss before he went deeper and deeper. </p><p>They were practically as intense as you could get before neither of them were fully dressed when they heard a car pull up and the door open downstairs , they quickly disconnected but the two of them were so caught up it took some time to calm down , they were taking heavy breaths and just then they heard footsteps and Harry calling james\u2019 name . James quickly shot of the bed and chucked Alice her top back whilst he put his hoodie back on. Then suddenly the door was swung open. Harry opened the door to see James out of the bed , hair extremely messy, possible sweat on his forehead and breathing heavily.

So I was thinking Alice and her family have been over for the Wotters Christmas\u2019 before &amp; none of them have received a sweater from Mrs. Weasley. But, this year just Alice (our of her fam) gets one &amp; James is like super proud/happy about it. &amp; like Ginny pulls Mrs. Weasley aside &amp; asks \u201cwhy did you make Alice one?\u201d (or something) &amp; she basically says like I know I will be making more for their kids or I always knew i\u2019d be making her one. Thank you!!</p><p><i><b>Pairing : jalice</b></i></p><p><b>Genre: FLUFF</b></p><p>Every single year the longbottoms, malfoys , scammanders , finnigans and woods go to the burrows with the wotters , some of them just pop round to give presents and some (like the longbottoms and malfoys ) stay longer. The main Christmas tradition of the wotters was to receive a sweater from Mrs weasley , this was strictly a wotters only tradition and the families that joined in understood after all they had their own family traditions too. Alice was perfectly okay with waiting and watching as James opened his sweater and eagerly pulled it over his head whilst beaming , it practically made her Christmas every year. </p><p>This was the secound year that Alice and James has been dating and James was even more excited for Christmas than ever before , he would my shut up about it. Hislist had been written in November, the day after his birthday , and he had made about 300 changes since then. He used mistletoe on Alice as much as possible , just because it was Christmas. Alice didn\u2019t mind but the whole school was getting pretty bothered with James\u2019 festive cheer.</p><p>He ran around school wearing a scarf and earmuffs singing Christmas carols at the top of his lungs using the excuse it\u2019s Christmas and he can do whatever he wants , mcgonagall disagreed and he was in a detention every Saturday, but that didn\u2019t stop James. </p><p>When school was over all James would talk about was going to the burrow on Christmas. </p><p>One night when Alice was around his house, the two of them were just lead together in silence on his bed. \u201cDo you know what James?\u201d Alice said breaking the silence and playing with the strings on James\u2019 hoodie.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He replied softly whilst smiling at the way Alice was so close to him and playing with his hoodie. </p><p>\u201cThis is the first time since the lead up to Christmas you\u2019ve not mentioned Christmas\u201d Alice said smiling.</p><p>James chuckled ,\u201d it\u2019s because it\u2019s the first time it\u2019s just been the two of us , your so cute all I want to do is look at you\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d Alice said looking into James\u2019 eyes.\u201dis that <i>all</i> you want to do?\u201d</p><p>James got a smug smile on his face as he avoided eye contact , \u201cobviously not\u201d he said now playing with the string of alices pyjama bottoms. </p><p>James quickly connected their lips , whilst cupping alices face , he felt her melt into the kiss before he went deeper and deeper. </p><p>They were practically as intense as you could get before neither of them were fully dressed when they heard a car pull up and the door open downstairs , they quickly disconnected but the two of them were so caught up it took some time to calm down , they were taking heavy breaths and just then they heard footsteps and Harry calling james\u2019 name . James quickly shot of the bed and chucked Alice her top back whilst he put his hoodie back on. Then suddenly the door was swung open. Harry opened the door to see James out of the bed , hair extremely messy, possible sweat on his forehead and breathing heavily. And Alice sat on the bed , her hair was messy too and her top looked like it hadn\u2019t been put on very well. He looked between the two of them ,\u201dJames\u201d he said swallowing a lump in his throat.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d James replied not making eye contact. </p><p>\u201cI need to speak to you downstairs, alone\u201d </p><p>James looked at Alice and back down and his fingers ,\u201dwhy?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI think you know why \u201c Harry replied.</p><p>James sighed and followed him out leaving Alice alone in the room. </p><p>\u201cSo James \u2026. what did I tell you last time I walked in on a situation like this?\u201d Harry said </p><p>\u201cUhhh- situation like what?\u201d James said acting like he was clueless</p><p>\u201cYou know what James\u201d</p><p>James sighed again,\u201d being safe? I\u2019m too young ? She\u2019s too young? I don\u2019t remember it was a while ago\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell you\u2019re right that is what I said, so listen to my advice\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad we have been dating for two years , stop babying me , I can do what I want , and if something happens then it\u2019s my fault isn\u2019t it and I have to take responsibility\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s where that conversation ended.</p><p>Two days later it was Christmas. Alice arrived at the burrow like usual , the house was beautifully decorated like usual and the smell of Christmas dinner was all throughout the house. Alice found James infront of the tv with his grandad playing a muggle game James played all the time on his xbox. Alice sat in his lap as he played . \u201cGrandad don\u2019t land there land where I\u2019m going , that way we won\u2019t meet people before we get guns and amo\u201d he said </p><p>The game got more intense as James kept talking about a storm shrinking and people dying. \u201cOkay there is only two other teams left now , we can do this\u201d </p><p>Alice watched the screen and realised that Arthur wasn\u2019t actually that great , James was more protecting him. Soon enough there was only one team left. James was in some sort of shoot out and his fingers were moving frantically against his controller and finally he screamed \u201c fuck yeah!\u201d To which he got told off for by molly. But he was high fiveing his grandad talking about a victory royal.</p><p>\u201cDId you win?\u201d Alice asked practically asleep in james lap with her face snuggled into his chest \u201cYeah\u201d he said smiling. Molly came in and announced it was sweater time , Alice hopped off of James lap so he could receive his sweater but when molly came around to pass James his sweater , she also passed one to Alice . Alice was so shocked that she only just managed to stammer a thank you very much. </p><p>James in the other hand was ecstatic , he was hugging Alice and shaky her like crazy all whilst Alice tried to comprehend the situation. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put it on you\u201d James said pulling it over alices head and seeing the smile as her face popped out , giving him the feeling that Alice got every year. </p><p>Meanwhile Ginny gestured for molly to speak to her in the kitchen. \u201cWhat going on mum?\u201d She asked</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Molly replied</p><p>\u201cHow come you made everyone a Christmas sweater this year?\u201d Ginny asked</p><p>Molly chuckled ,\u201d I always meant to make them sweaters Ginny , I just never really had the time , but this year I started early so everyone can get one , and it made James so happy\u201d</p><p>Ginny peered back into the living room to see James still beaming as he made sure everyone realised his sweater was matching with alices.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he is really happy\u201d Ginny replied </p><p>\u201cAnd Alice is apart of the family\u201d molly added </p></p>",
