The ghost tells him that once he reaches his home \u2014 once he slays all his enemies and sets his house in order \u2014 he must do one last thing before he can rest. The ghost tells him to pick up an oar and walk inland, and keep walking until somebody mistakes that oar for a shovel. For that would be a place where no man had ever been troubled by the sea, and that's where he'd find peace.\"</center>",

        "body": "<p>\n<b>Kei: </b>Trip over multiple plot hooks, because some inconsiderate jerk left them lying around everywhere.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>In terms of folklore, lycanthropy took a variety of forms. Yes, that was a pun, but wordplay didn\u2019t make my point less valid. </p><p>According\n to some myths, being turned into a werewolf was a matter of taking a \ncontract with an evil spirit. Or getting cursed by a god for fucking up \nthe laws of hospitality so badly that, while Tantalus was probably still\n the exemplar, punishment was necessary. Maybe the moon was, or wasn\u2019t, \ninvolved. Getting nibbled on by Canis lupus lupus\n came about later, because for whatever reason rabies transmission and \nwerewolves didn\u2019t get together until pulp fiction. Some werewolves got \ntheir curse from picking flowers from graveyards. Not all were-whatever \ncreatures were wolves, were evil, or even changed shape at all. Hell, \nmaybe the stories were just coverups for serial killers in the age of \nwitch trials.</p><p>The trouble started once the moon rose.</p><p>I\u2019d\n never especially paid attention to lunar cycles beyond what was \nnecessary. Plenty of Konoha traditions ran on a Western calendar pulled \nout of a different universe, and so bright moons existed for Tsukimi \nfestivals and ruining stealth missions the world over. After the fact, I\n recalled that the moon had been there, but that was it. </p><p><b>To the point, mind.</b></p><p>At\n the time things went weird, Rin and I were out and about. The autumn \nevening was nippy, not truly cold. Between my circus-given coat and \nRin\u2019s sudden acquisition of a winter Konoha cloak, we were all right. \nThe town was quieter at night, with the closest thing to a true \nnightlife taking up the fairgrounds and the circus\u2019s attention. With any\n luck, we\u2019d have a nice, quiet night and raid the closest thing this \ntown had to a library. Even without electric lighting, there had to be \nsomething we could find.</p><p><i>\u201cWhile we\u2019re away from the circus, I have a question I don\u2019t think was answered,\u201d</i>\n said Rin, as we headed to the lakeshore. The moon\u2019s reflection was \nbright silver in the water, which almost made up for the smell of fish \nand muck. </p><p>Both of us sat down on an empty dock. I could see quite a ways, and Rin cocked her head to one side as she thought.</p><p><i>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d</i> I said, turning my flat yellow eyes to her. </p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019ve had a while to come up with a hypothesis,\u201d </i>Rin began, pressing her fingertips together as she thought. <i>\u201cNow that I\u2019ve met Yasha, and Molly, and also your new form, I think I have enough data. Do you think everyone has been modified somehow?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWe\u2019re kind of a small sample size,\u201d</i> I muttered, but that was as solid as my objections went. <i>\u201cYour changes are cosmetic, right?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t think they are. I mean, yes, my eyes and my hair are different, but there are so many other things.\u201d</i> She held a hand out in front of her and pointed at the moon, frowning. <i>\u201cIt\n may just be a trick my brain is playing on me, but I\u2019m sure my night \nvision wasn\u2019t this good before we got here. I can see fifteen meters \nfarther than I should be able to right now, even with full moonlight. \nDid something similar happen to you?\u201d</i></p><p>I nodded. <i>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026not dark where it should be.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cExactly! And then when I met Molly, I felt my skin crawling even though he hadn\u2019t done anything. It was a totally irrational feeling.\u201d</i>\n Rin threw her hands up in frustration. Her multicolored eyes seemed to \nflash in the dark, catching the moonlight strangely in my modified \nvision. <i>\u201cThere was some little itchy part of me that was just as upset with Yasha for something. It was completely at odds with my first impressions of almost everyone I\u2019ve ever met, including Orochimaru.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI haven\u2019t felt anything like that,\u201d</i> I said. If I tried, I could probably find something deep\n in the factoid-centric part of my brain to explain it, but I didn\u2019t \nknow for sure. But if Yasha and Molly gave off the same feeling, maybe \nthey both weren\u2019t human? <i>\u201cBut I\u2019ve kind of been distracted by\u2026y\u2019know.\u201d</i> I tried to wave my tail to catch Rin\u2019s attention and accidentally smacked her in the leg instead.</p><p><i>\u201cI do know!\u201d </i>Rin said good-naturedly, waving off my attempted apology. <i>\u201cAnd\n I also discovered I can heal without using chakra. I don\u2019t understand \nit, but there\u2019s plenty in this world I don\u2019t understand.\u201d </i>She nodded firmly and clenched her fists as though her determination alone would wrestle truth from the air. <i>\u201cI will, though. Every magic is just insufficiently understood until testing begins!\u201d</i></p><p><b>I missed her.</b> Isobu stretched out with all of his tails and both forelegs, draping himself over Rin\u2019s lap.<i> \u201c<b>Your excessive scientific enthusiasm is a relief, you know.</b>\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAw, you\u2019re making me blush.\u201d </i>Rin pressed her hands to her cheeks theatrically, then settled into tweaking the tips of Isobu\u2019s tails. <i>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019ve been here for Kei. It\u2019s awful to be alone.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou were.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd that\u2019s how I know it\u2019s awful.\u201d</i></p><p>All\n three of us sighed at the same time. Even the turtle. We were a long \nway from home with no way to go back immediately. It sucked no matter \nhow many times it happened. </p><p>Which\n was about when I felt a faint ping at the far end of my chakra sensing \nrange. Instantly, my head jerked in the relevant direction and every \nmuscle on me tensed up, which Rin couldn\u2019t miss on her worst day. </p><p><i>\u201cI think we just found a friend,\u201d</i> I heard myself say.</p><p><i>\u201cWho is it?\u201d</i>\n Rin asked, following me eagerly as we got to our feet and started \nstriding toward the edge of town. It felt like the right direction. </p><p>Except for the lake. </p><p>The\n lightning I was following wasn\u2019t a part of a storm, a spell, or \nanything else conveniently explainable by this world\u2019s phenomena. Not at\n all. I\u2019d know that walking live wire anywhere, and I started to pick up\n the pace toward the signature even as it took me toward the water. </p><p><i>\u201cOh, I know who this is!\u201d </i>Rin chirped, and darted after me as we hurried across the waves. Isobu was still clamped tight in her arms. </p><p>What kind of shinobi would we be if we let a little water stop us from checking in? </p><p>The\n Ustaloch was a kidney bean-shaped body of water that seemed to be a \nfocal point of local superstition. Rin had encountered giant water \nsnakes here during her week\u2019s stay, which seemed to be native. After \ntying them in a knot, there wasn\u2019t much else to prove to the \nout-of-place fauna. Rin knew it, I knew it, and anything that survived a\n Rin-rampage was probably going to live long enough to learn it. </p><p>Thus, we didn\u2019t run into any threats for a while. </p><p>The\n lakeshore butted up against forest, but not true woods as we\u2019d come to \nunderstand in Konoha. There, the trees were wider around than any human \narm-span at a dead minimum. Here, I got the impression that the logging \nindustry was less of an organized affair and more just because people \naround here didn\u2019t have any other way to heat their houses in the \nwinter. Coming to a world without basic amenities felt like such a step \nback it wasn\u2019t on the same continent.</p><p>And we weren\u2019t.</p><p>My feet hit sand again a little before Rin\u2019s did, and we clambered up onto the shore and into tree cover. </p><p><i>\u201cWait\u2026 Is that\u2026?\u201d</i> Rin murmured behind me, just as the source of Kakashi\u2019s chakra signature padded into view.</p><p>My first thought was, <i>Holy fuck he\u2019s a werewolf.</i></p><p>My second was, <i>Oh fucking hell he\u2019s big.</i></p><p>Hanging\n around summoned animals a lot had a way of messing with one\u2019s sense of \nscale, but I was still sure the white wolf in front of me had to be well\n over three times as big as a normal one. At least. The heavy snow-white\n coat was interrupted only by a black muzzle split by two rows of \nwhite-and-red teeth and a dark spot over his left eye, like someone \ncopy-pasted the coat of a sweet mutt over a dire wolf\u2019s frame. All of \nhis teeth were bared and his breath formed thick fog in the moonlit cold\n air. </p><p>That rumble definitely wasn\u2019t thunder. Instead, it sounded like a growl.</p><p><b>You know, I think I could keep him from biting anyone.</b></p><p>Well, I thought as I felt Rin grip my arm, shit.</p><p>Rin\n and I started moving parallel to the massive wolf, along the lakeshore \nand through cattails. Neither of us took our eyes off him.</p><p>Sure,\n Kakashi\u2019s long strides mirrored my movements exactly like a large \npredator would, but hell. I was at least as vicious as a wolf of any \nsize. And he didn\u2019t seem to want to head into the water. Instead, those \nmismatched eyes stayed on us, glittering in the dark. If I had to guess,\n neither Rin nor I came up to his shoulder. Rin in particular. </p><p><b>He can bite me.</b></p><p>There were, apparently, some concrete benefits to having an invulnerable companion. Same principle as a crocodile,\n I theorized. My thoughts weren\u2019t too frantic, though seeing a Sharingan\n in a wolf\u2019s face was fairly unsettling. There wasn\u2019t any recognition in\n that gaze that I could detect. Wolves have more muscles to close their jaws than they do to open them. Or at least the muscles are stronger.</p><p>I\n felt Rin\u2019s chakra pulse as she activated the first stage of her \nStrength of a Hundred seal, just in case. Well, there went the threat \nlevel of this little encounter. On his best day, Kakashi couldn\u2019t hope \nto beat Rin at arm wrestling. On Rin\u2019s best day, <i>Gamabunta </i>would lose.</p><p><i>\u201cLet me know if you want me to keep him busy,\u201d</i> Rin said softly. </p><p>Out of the corner of my mouth, I said, <i>\u201cMaybe once I have a plan. Isobu\u2019s talking.\u201d</i></p><p><b>Speaking\n of, I meant \u201che can bite me\u201d more in the manner of a dog trying to pick\n up a ball too big for its mouth. You know the look.</b></p><p>\u2026Isobu.</p><p><b>If it works, I doubt either of </b><b>us</b><b> will care how silly it looks. And Rin would hardly mention it. </b></p><p>Isobu, please don\u2019t break his teeth. We have no idea how any of this shit works.</p><p><b>Having not seen a competent dentist\u2026 Fine.</b></p><p>I\n picked Isobu up by his shell. In my hands, he curled into a spiked \nmedicine ball of doom. Tossing him up and down a few times to get a \nsense of his weight, I nodded to Rin. Then I held him one-handed and \neyed Kakashi\u2019s growling form. </p><p><i>\u201cChew on this,\u201d</i> I suggested cheerfully, and pitched Isobu right at his face.</p><p>Once\n upon a time, a version of me with her nose constantly in a book read an\n awful lot about strange beasts and magical principles. I\u2019d never lived \nthose rules, of course, because there was one such system in my life and\n it was already bullshit enough for two. But in those books had been \nstories of how all sorts of animal minds worked.</p><p>Per\n the works of one Sir Terry Pratchett, werewolves kept one foot in the \nhuman world and a paw in the world of wolves. Made them a bit of both. \nAnd what did you call a wolf with human influence spanning back \ngenerations uncounted?</p><p>Maybe, just a bit, there was a bit of dog in there.</p><p>I probably should have predicted what happened next.</p><p>Kakashi\n whipped his huge head around and snatched Isobu neatly out of the air. \nHe fumbled for a split second, teeth or tongue catching Isobu\u2019s spikes \nthe wrong way, but stubbornly refused to let the little monster drop. \nThe head jerk motion was nearly the same as a natural wolf\u2019s, but it\u2019d \nbeen designed for prey the equivalent size of a mouse. Isobu was a \nlittle too round and tough.</p><p>Isobu\n hadn\u2019t discussed his next move with me, but in theory he was capable of\n keeping Kakashi\u2019s entire head restrained with just his tails. He \nstarted to uncoil, gripping fur with his little hands.</p><p>And then Kakashi shook his head exactly\n like the signature back-breaking swing I\u2019d only observed in terriers \nbefore. Also in Pakkun, but Pakkun hunted about as often as pigs flew. \nIsobu made a noise like a pissed-off cat and two of his tails looped \naround Kakashi\u2019s lower jaw, but that didn\u2019t seem to stop him. He just \nadjusted his grip on Isobu and half-closed his eyes, shaking my combat \nbuddy so hard I heard Isobu swear inside my head from frustration.</p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s not hurting him, is it?\u201d</i> Rin asked worriedly.</p><p>Isobu\u2019s cursing was definitely the angry kind.</p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014Kakashi, is that fun?\u201d</i> I asked before I could stop myself. </p><p>At\n the sound of my voice, his mismatched eyes locked on me again. I wasn\u2019t\n sure he recognized my voice, because both of our bodies were kinda \nfucked up and our faces were\u2026intact. Hell if I knew what we smelled \nlike.</p><p>Rin at least looked like herself, even if she was glowing a bit from her jutsu. </p><p>Then\n he dropped his chest and forelegs to the bank, his straight tail up and\n wagging. His non-Sharingan eye angled up, toward us, and one of his \nears almost flopped as he let out a noise not unlike a growl. But \nhigher.</p><p><i>\u201cOh no.\u201d</i> I fought valiantly to keep my hand from hitting my face. I had horns now. It\u2019d probably hurt.<i> \u201cNo.\u201d</i></p><p>Rin started to snicker.</p><p><b>I take back what I said about my brilliant plan.</b></p><p>You made that bed, and now you get to lie in it, I told him, but I stepped toward the bank anyway.</p><p>Kakashi skittered back at least a meter.</p><p>I stepped forward twice. </p><p>Kakashi retreated two meters.</p><p>Aw, dammit. I facepalmed anyway, and damn the consequences. <i>\u201cHey, Kakashi. Drop him, please.\u201d</i></p><p>Kakashi\u2019s response was something like <i>\u201cAwuf.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cKakashi.\u201d </i>I crouched just a bit, my tail lashing.<i> \u201cCome on, drop the turtle.\u201d</i></p><p>Though her hands covered her mouth, Rin managed to say, <i>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s listening.\u201d</i></p><p>He did not drop the turtle. In fact, he turned tail and booked it when I darted for Isobu\u2019s loose tail. The only saving grace was that the island wasn\u2019t that big. He couldn\u2019t run forever.</p><p><i>\u201cI DON\u2019T CARE IF YOU\u2019RE A HUNDRED KILOS BIGGER, GET BACK HERE!\u201d</i></p><p>Rin was too doubled over with laughter to help. </p><p>Like I said. Probably should have seen that coming.</p><p>It\n took five hours for Kakashi to finally keel over for a nap. Still giant\n and wolfy and with Isobu trapped between his dinner plate paws, but at \nleast he stopped running. The night\u2019s festivities were like playing keep\n away if the ball kept shrieking out of injured pride, chasing away \nnesting birds and generally making a racket. Had I actually been able to\n sleep, it probably would have pissed me off something fierce. \nOtherwise, the screaming mostly marked Kakashi\u2019s location and helped me \nkeep a bead on them while the chase was on.</p><p>As\n a direct result of these shenanigans, I was dead on my feet by morning.\n Plenty of chakra left, but not perhaps the best control. Also, crabbier\n than Isobu. In my experience, no amount of foreign caffeine made up for\n just never getting to sleep, even if I knew where to get any. </p><p>Rin patted my head when I mentioned this problem. <i>\u201cI\u2019m sure Kakashi had fun.\u201d</i></p><p>At\n least I could lean against Kakashi\u2019s white flank to rest once he \nsettled. Rin was sitting on his other side, humming as she did a medical\n scan. All the data was coming up Dog. I supposed he could\n be a dire wolf, albeit one with strange markings. I had a vague notion \nthat real dire wolves were supposed to have spikes like Isobu, though. \nAnd be a lot more aggressive than Kakashi was, once the ice was broken. </p><p>While\n dawn\u2019s first light touched the treetops and the sky turned orange and \nclouds became pink, Kakashi raised his huge head with his tongue lolling\n out of his mouth. He nosed at the world\u2019s most dangerous tennis ball, \nand Isobu roused. </p><p>Isobu,\n still trapped between his paws, grumbled like an annoyed alligator and \npoked his head out of the mountain of fur. He tolerated the prodding \nwith bad grace, then said, <i><b>\u201cI cannot help but notice that he is still huge and fluffy.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s\n been bothering me, too. I mean, he\u2019s a perfectly healthy giant animal \nat the moment, but he has Kakashi\u2019s chakra signature.\u201d</i> When I leaned my head back to look askance at her, Rin could only shrug. <i>\u201cReally. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on! This is magic, and that\u2019s both intriguing and incredibly frustrating.\u201d</i> She patted Kakashi\u2019s fur. <i>\u201cWe\u2019ll get you back to normal somehow, all right?\u201d</i></p><p>Kakashi made a \u201cwhuf\u201d noise and twisted until his snout could nearly rest in my lap. Then he sighed, as though content. </p><p>Unfortunately,\n I couldn\u2019t wait forever. I lifted his head off me about five minutes \nlater, letting him make sad puppy eyes at me as I got to my feet. Next \non my to-do list was tearing into my emergency supplies.</p><p>Yes, I still had them in a storage seal in my foot. It was harder to replace than conventionally stored bags. </p><p>At\n some point during life as a member of any shinobi corps, people learned\n to pack efficiently whether they wanted to or not. Setting aside the \nperennial issue of folding versus rolling and how putting storage \nscrolls inside of each other tended to result in explosions, I retrieved\n three full sets of clothes that didn\u2019t compensate for the tail I \nsported now. Fortunately, one of them turned out to be Izo\u2019s \nWhitebeard-emblazoned T-shirt and the bright red jacket (designed for \npeople who were over two meters tall). Uniform pants were a little \nharder to be sure of, but I had a pair cut for Obito since he was still in the \u201cthrow it all in\u201d school of keeping shit organized and needed a bit of help. Instead, I got to be pack mule.</p><p>By\n the time the sun rose, I expected Kakashi to turn back into a person. \nAt least then I could yell at him properly for scaring me.</p><p>Instead,\n he shook his head with so much force that he sent a ripple through his \nentire body, his ears pricking to attention. Rin\u2019s grip in his fur was \nthankfully strong enough to keep her from being tossed to the ground, \nbut it was a close thing. He rolled to his feet all at once, with Rin \nstill on his back, and looked around frantically until his mismatched \neyes landed on me.</p><p><i>\u201c&hellip;You all right?\u201d</i> I asked, even as I raised my hand.</p><p>He\n pushed his nose into my hand. It was wet and his breath was hot, coming\n in quick pants. His normal eye was dark with the whites showing around \nthe edges, and his Sharingan spun slowly as fear set in.</p><p>I\n grabbed onto his fur with both hands. He lowered his head until I could\n press my forehead to his, planting a kiss in the middle of his fur. \nWhile the whine in his throat echoed up through me, too, I stroked the \nsides of his head and tried to soothe the fear. I could feel the panic \ntrying to control him and the growl starting to build, but I hung on \nanyway. I wasn\u2019t any better, now that I knew for sure he was really in there and not just his chakra. </p><p><i>\u201cShh, shh,\u201d</i> I\n murmured. Above my head, I felt Rin\u2019s hand briefly brush mine as she, \ntoo, tried her best to let Kakashi know we were both here for him.<i> \u201cI\u2019ve got you now, all right? Everything\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</i></p><p>Rin slid down his back until she could touch ground again. <i>\u201cYou look totally different, but you only just realized it now, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</i></p><p>Kakashi made a mournful noise, his ears flat against his skull. </p><p>It\n took us a while to convince him, but eventually Kakashi laid miserably \non the ground next to me. With my backpack wide open so Rin could use \nit, we all curled up together on that bleak little shore as Rin scanned \nhis chakra again. </p><p>Kakashi\n leaned into my side and my arm clung to his thick fur ruff. Though I \ncouldn\u2019t claim to be a mind reader, I was pretty good at moods if people\n around me had chakra to read. Kakashi did believe us, to a point, but \nthe rest of his signature rattled with undirected, unfamiliar fear. </p><p>Rin\n started slowly going through her medical checks. Her chakra was clamped\n down hard as her training took over, hands glowing faintly green in my \nmind\u2019s eye. Even from my comparatively amateur understanding of animal \ntransformations, Kakashi\u2019s stamina was shot to hell and his confidence \nhad taken a beating, so it was no wonder why Rin was so serious. At \nleast no one had hurt him before found him. That was something. </p><p>It had to be.</p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m here. We\u2019ll get through this.\u201d</i></p><p>Kakashi whined with his muzzle in his paws. In that tone, I heard, What happened?</p><p>While\n Rin scanned Kakashi for abnormalities, I explained what I knew about \nwerewolves\u2014infections and moon cycles, mostly\u2014and the knot of worry in \nmy stomach kept tightening alongside Kakashi\u2019s lightning chakra. It \ndidn\u2019t mean anything to him. It was all empty words. </p><p>I didn\u2019t know what the fuck I was talking about in this world, and that scared all of us.</p><p><i>\u201cDo you remember how you ended up this way?\u201d</i> I asked him, barely keeping my voice steady.</p><p>Kakashi shook his huge head just enough to get his point across, terrified of dislodging me. </p><p>Getting\n occasionally knocked unconscious or fainting were facts of life as \nshinobi. Kakashi, with the drain from the Sharingan, viewed the latter \nas an old and irritating friend. But losing control? Losing his body? Never. In his entire life, Kakashi lost a grand total of maybe an hour to altered states of consciousness from genjutsu tricks or getting drunk. His discipline allowed no more. </p><p>Losing control wasn\u2019t something he did. This was a whole new frontier of impossible to deal with.</p><p>He\n did his best to keep his eyes both locked on Rin as she took his pulse \nand listened to his breathing, trying to figure out where it had all \ngone wrong. She wasn\u2019t a vet. She\u2019d practiced on humans. We were so \nscrewed.</p><p><i>\u201cAs far as I can tell, you\u2019re perfectly healthy,\u201d</i> Rin said finally, running her fingers over one of his dinner plate-sized paws. <i>\u201cJust\n a giant wolf. This has to be another magic thing. It might also explain\n why it took you until now to remember you\u2019re supposed to be human. You \nreally didn\u2019t remember anything?\u201d</i></p><p>Lowering\n his head onto his paws again, he sighed deeply. Perhaps in direct \nresponse, Isobu started carding his much smaller hands through Kakashi\u2019s\n fur. Maybe he just wanted to see what it felt like. It wasn\u2019t like real\n animals often let him close. </p><p><i><b>\u201cFrom one perspective,\u201d</b></i> Isobu said thoughtfully, <b><i>\u201cit is very like being an inexperienced jinch\u016briki.\u201d</i></b> Bobbing in the lake, Isobu wiggled all of his tails as Kakashi jerked his head toward him.<b><i> \u201cI\n think Kei remembers her early experiences well because she did not \nreach V2 before learning some self-control. But I recall instances where\n other jinch\u016briki have not been so lucky.\u201d</i></b></p><p>Utakata\n came to mind immediately, though he\u2019d hit his berserker threshold early\n due to severe injury. All of his usual surgical precision careened out \nthe window. Then Blue B and the time Gy\u016bki\u2019s seal split wide open. And \nthen there was our very own Naruto\u2026</p><p><i>\u201cThough there is one big exception,\u201d</i>\n I said, when Kakashi made a little acknowledging noise. His feelings on\n the matter were still fairly negative, but he\u2019d dealt with worse. <i>\u201cI don\u2019t think you can exactly \u2018befriend\u2019 the wolf mind. At least, not like Isobu.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>\u201cI, for example, am a person. Your affliction seems to have superimposed the mind of a dog on top of yours. Temporarily.\u201d</b></i> Isobu eyed Kakashi carefully as he thought about what to say next. He tucked his little hands under his belly. <i>\u201c<b>Without a proper tongue, can you use that eye of yours to speak to us?</b>\u201d</i></p><p>I glanced down at the top of Kakashi\u2019s head. <i>\u201cThat might work?\u201d <br/></i></p><p><i></i>I was mostly surprised that suggestion came from Isobu,\n because he\u2019d never been fond of Kakashi\u2019s use of the Sharingan. \nTolerated? Sure. Occasionally been grateful for in desperate \ncircumstances? Fine. But he generally didn\u2019t volunteer to have anything \nto do with the Sharingan if at all possible. </p><p><i>\u201cIf that would work, I think you\u2019re in the right place to try it.\u201d </i>Rin\u2019s eyes were a little glazed over as she went over the data her scan gave her, but she was clearly listening. </p><p>Kakashi\n made a curious noise in the back of his throat, ears twitching. He \nnosed at Isobu again, then met the little beastie\u2019s eye with his \nSharingan. As though now was the perfect time to test it. I kept my \nhands in his fur for the length of the staring contest, feeling my \nnerves tremble in anticipation of whatever other curveballs this place \ncould throw our way. We didn\u2019t need any more.</p><p>A second later, Isobu said as though in response to a question, <b>\u201c</b><b>No. There was a threat display</b><b>\u201d</b>\u2014which had been terrifying in the moment because I hadn\u2019t known what to do\u2014<b>\u201cbut once you had me in your teeth, it was all a game. You did not hurt anyone.</b><b>\u201d</b></p><p>I sagged in relief. Thank fuck it worked. </p><p>\u201cAnd then we had a nice nap. Or you did,\u201d Rin added, as Kakashi deflated slightly from sheer relief. His tail thumped the ground once while she spoke, \u201cWith Isobu tucked between your huge paws, after playing Keep Away with him.\u201d</p><p>Kakashi\n managed a mortified expression, even as near-unrecognizable as he was. \nHis chakra burned with shame. He whined uncomfortably.</p><p><i>\u201cYou absolutely did.\u201d</i> Rin smiled for the first time since Kakashi had realized the situation. She scratched his ears. <i>\u201cIt was worse than when Pakkun tried teaching a stray dog how Fetch worked.\u201d</i></p><p>Kakashi\n twisted his head over so he could rub at his Sharingan against his \nforeleg. Then he sighed up at both of us. Those eyes seemed to ask, <i>What now?</i></p><p>I\n had no idea. All I could think of was going back to the circus and \ntelling them I\u2019d have to leave for the foreseeable future, because my \nfianc\u00e9 had been magically transformed into an animal and everything was \nterrible. I couldn\u2019t stick around. Rin and I needed to find a way to fix\n this. </p><p>Kakashi sighed deeply. </p><p><i><b>\u201cBody modifications seem to be all the rage, now,\u201d</b></i>\n Isobu griped while we all tried to absorb what kind of situation we\u2019d \nbeen dropped into. He curled his tails around Rin\u2019s wrist and mine, then\n sat squarely on Kakashi\u2019s right front paw. <i><b>\u201cWe cannot \njust sit idle and hope for a solution to fall onto our heads. You are a \ndog, I am small, Kei has a limb she cannot use, and Rin has also been \nchanged on some spiritual level. These things are unfortunate, but we \nare alive. We are capable. And we will find a way to get our bodies \nback.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Kakashi snorted, but he accepted the ear rubs when Rin offered. </p><p>For\n normal people, the phrase \u201chiked the lake back to town\u201d probably needed\n to be modified by the word \u201caround.\u201d Not so for us. Even \nKakashi-turned-Suicune. Or whatever he was. </p><p>At least<i> something</i> went right today.</p><p>This feeling did not last once the morning mist burned off, because it never did. Town was different overnight.</p><p>Trekking\n back to the circus, only to find that everyone was under house arrest \nand the place was on lockdown thanks to the Crownsguard, was a bit of a \nshock. Learning about a minor zombie outbreak followed in that vein, \nbecause of course it did. Since I couldn\u2019t waltz into camp without a \ndisguise and daylight guards were almost always more alert than \ngraveyard-shifters, the three of us moved on to poking the periphery.</p><p>\u201cSorry\n if this is&hellip;rude, but, uh.\u201d Without the brightly colored costumes the \ncircus folks wore, I at least couldn\u2019t be instantly picked out as one of\n the crew. It was pragmatic, but not particularly nice for the ones \nwho\u2019d been arrested. \u201cIf I could just get past\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove\n along already, you nosy devil.\u201d The Crownsguard spat to the side even \nas all of us watched him. \u201cEveryone here is under suspicion of murder.\u201d </p><p>Kakashi, with his fur held tight by Rin\u2019s hands, didn\u2019t quite manage to avoid growling as the guard got in my face. </p><p>\u201cKeep your damn dog on a leash,\u201d was the guard\u2019s suggestion before he really got sick of us. </p><p>In\n some worlds, dogs wore collars. Or service vests. Or both. To get \nKakashi\u2019s way-too-damn-big wolf form into town, Rin and I puzzled over \nthe problem until we remembered the vests and headbands Kakashi made for\n all of his dogs back when he had proper thumbs instead of dewclaws. So,\n after digging through our emergency supplies and scrubbing what seemed \nto be deer blood from around Kakashi\u2019s dark muzzle, we\u2019d collaborated.</p><p>The\n Whitebeard jacket was tied around his thick neck like a cheery little \nscarf, the sleeves arranged into a bow. Somehow combining that with a \nleash made of rope\u2014attached to the jacket, not his neck\u2014made him a \u201cdog\u201d\n in human brains. </p><p>A very, <i>very</i> big dog that smelled like the forest. </p><p>Isobu might\u2019ve messed with the guards\u2019 heads a bit to make it work, but it worked no matter how much we cheated. Therefore, it was victory through technicality. </p><p>Kakashi\n was very patient through the entire process and even let a different \nguard shake his paw, which was more than I would have offered at the \ntime. Then again, I probably would have been turned into a turtle if I \nwasn\u2019t already a demon-blooded person. Apparently. </p><p>In the end, we ditched the crime scene and went looking around for help.</p><p><i><b>\u201cIt could have been more humiliating if we tried, yes,\u201d</b></i> Isobu said to Kakashi\u2019s apparently Sharingan-transferred question. <i><b>\u201cI have already pretended to be a ventriloquist dummy. Most people do not realize I am a person, either.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Kakashi sighed, and both Rin and I patted his hulking shoulders. </p><p>And,\n because Kakashi\u2019s nose was more useful than my inherent radar in a \nworld where only the four of us had chakra, we managed to track down the\n only member of the circus who wasn\u2019t trapped either in the stockade or \nthe campground. It took a few minutes, and we scared more than a few \npeople while trotting through town in our search, but we did it. I could\n tell that the second Kakashi turned up his nose and refused to even \nthink of walking into a building, because he was too busy sneezing. </p><p>It\n turned out that only so many people smelled like a combination of \npatchouli, road dust, and stale alcohol, even in a town with a \ndecent-sized population. Really, the patchouli was the defining factor \nwhen it came to Mollymauk Tealeaf. And not tea. </p><p>I\u2019d\n noticed strange things in the performers\u2019 boxes while helping out at \nthe circus, but I couldn\u2019t track a drop of perfume across a country. \nKakashi could. Even if he still hated the smell. </p><p>There was a comparison to be made to Prince Humperdinck, but that was a different story.</p><p>Anyway, we found the world\u2019s most colorful fortune teller in an inn off the side of the street. </p><p>Kakashi\n and Isobu stayed outside, with Isobu sitting on the end of his lead as \nthough he was responsible in the slightest. Kakashi, for his part, \nsettled on the ground with his muzzle on his paws and made a miserable \nnoise. The smell of alcohol didn\u2019t agree with him, but bacon probably \ndid. There was a hindbrain-level instinct for meat rattling around in \nthere. </p><p>I needed to find some way to feed him, and it couldn\u2019t involve setting him loose on wildlife. Unless he wanted to do that. </p><p>Molly\n wasn\u2019t terribly colorful when I walked in, or at least hadn\u2019t been for a\n bit. Instead, Molly sat at a table and carefully wiped off enough \nmakeup to disguise a clown. His solid red gaze darted to me and then Rin\n when he noticed us entering the Nestled Nook Inn, and he waved with his\n free hand. \u201cGood to see you, Carey. Rin, too. Rough night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Okay, where did I start? \u201cI guess. I think yours might\u2019ve been worse.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh,\n I don\u2019t know.\u201d Molly eyed me as the last of the peach-colored makeup \nwas wiped away. \u201cWhat\u2019s an unjust arrest and unfriendly small town, in \nthe grand scheme of things? Sure, the Crownsguard are probably going to \nkill us all if they can\u2019t find whoever turned the old man into a \nmonster, but\u2026\u201d Molly paused. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s really a \nbright side to that. How about you?\u201d </p><p>I glanced at Rin, who shrugged. Ought I tell Molly about Kakashi\u2019s rather fuzzy problem? Or Rin\u2019s super strength?</p><p>\u201cDid\n your friend just keep you up all night?\u201d Molly flashed a sharp-toothed \ngrin, but his heart wasn\u2019t in it. While the grin didn\u2019t waver, my \nstone-faced response didn\u2019t seem to be encouraging. \u201cTrouble in \nparadise?\u201d he tried again.</p><p><b>Was that supposed to be an innuendo?</b></p><p><i>Yeah, nope. Not telling him shit.</i> I\n ignored the comment and sat down at the table, followed almost \nimmediately by Rin and then Isobu as he rolled into the bar area, the \nlatter of whom couldn\u2019t see over the edge of the table. </p><p>He did send me an awful image of the underside of said table, just to be an ass. Or to repay my comment, perhaps. </p><p>I shook the picture from my mind\u2019s eye and asked Molly, \u201cWhat exactly happened last night?\u201d </p><p>Molly\n did lay his cards out on the table, once I proved unwilling to play \nalong with any teasing. He explained, likely not for the first time, \nthat the show had gone on exactly as it always had for the majority of \nthe time last night. Right up until an old man turned into an undead \nmonster and killed someone else, who then also\n turned into an undead monster. Running with the theory that the circus \nwasn\u2019t in the business of murdering customers, Molly and his new \nco-conspirators\u2014coincidentally the same motley crew he\u2019d charmed into \nattending just yesterday morning\u2014had spent most of today investigating \nthe old man\u2019s usual haunts.</p><p>\u201cAnd we found basically nothing,\u201d said a new voice. </p><p>I\n leaned back a bit and spotted a woman in blue robes stomping down the \nstairs. Now that I had better light and more inclination to give a shit,\n the blue fabric of her outfit reminded me quite a lot\n of some of the more coastal towns in the Land of Fire and perhaps even \nwhat I\u2019d seen in the Fire Temple I\u2019d visited once. Though the specific \npattern was unfamiliar, there were some similarities to the cloth used \nin the Land of Water as well. Her features were more like mine than, \nsay, any human I\u2019d met so far. </p><p>Actually, she kind of looked like Sokka.</p><p><b>I do not see how that helps us.</b></p><p>That\n woman was followed almost immediately by a blue tiefling with dark, \nbackward-curling, silver-capped horns more like Molly\u2019s than mine. She \nwas probably a hand\u2019s span shorter than I was, wearing a dark blue slit \nskirt peppered with peach and pink tones. Her sleeves almost reached the\n floor, but in a Western style instead of a furisode, and she wore both a\n half-length green cape and a sickle in a sheath on her belt. </p><p>And\n then there was the half-orc behind her, dressed head to toe in dark \nleather armor. The two-tone green on him looked a little odd when I \nthought back to the only other half-orc I knew, but I was literally \ndull, dark pink all over and two of the other people at the table were \nblue and lavender. At this point, the time for pointing fingers was \npast. A scar bisected his eyebrow and formed an X further up his face, \nand his hair was dark, half-shaved, and sported a sharp gray streak. If I\n had to guess, he might\u2019ve been older than I was, and he was definitely \naround Kakashi\u2019s height. </p><p>Well, before he got turned into a giant wolf.</p><p>I\n cleared my throat as our table got a bit more crowded, thanks to the \nwoman in blue, the blue tiefling, and the half-orc from the last inn \nincursion. I cleared my throat. \u201cOkay. Well, then, it\u2019s about time for \nintroductions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems\n like we\u2019re all in the same boat,\u201d agreed the half-orc as he dragged a \nchair over to the table. \u201cI figure Molly might\u2019ve introduced us, but \nagain from the top, just so we\u2019re all clear. The name\u2019s Fjord, with a \nJ.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\n am Jester!\u201d Jester beamed as she followed suit, sliding into place next\n to Fjord. \u201cI didn\u2019t get any of your names before, but it is very nice \nto meet you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeau,\n short for Beauregard,\u201d was the monk\u2019s terse response. Though I \ncertainly couldn\u2019t make judgement calls on what parents named their \nkids, Beau still added, \u201cMy parents wanted a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\n see,\u201d I said, while Isobu clambered up onto the edge of the table and \nfolded his forelegs like some kind of mob boss. He didn\u2019t quite have the\n shoulder rotation range, however. \u201cBy the way, Molly, I wanted to \napologize for something else.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, we can get that out of the way first.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\n lied when I told all of you my name, before.\u201d I picked Gustav\u2019s fake \nidentification paperwork out of a pocket and set it flat on the table. \nBeauregard just picked it up to stare at it, scrutinizing me. \u201cIf you \nall like, you can call me Keisuke. Or Kei. These two do.\u201d </p><p>Isobu nodded firmly. \u201c<b>The\n fake name was useful for deflecting attention, but there does not seem \nto be much point. There is no one here to recognize us. Thus, you may \ncall me Isobu.</b>\u201d His eye narrowed to a glowing red slit that made him look like a monster from the depths, if the depths were floor height. \u201c<b>And if any of you call me </b><i><b>anything</b></i><b> but my name, I will douse you in ice water until you learn better.</b>\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cOh, I wish I spoke this language,\u201d </i>Rin said after a second, waiting for an Isobu translation that didn\u2019t seem to be forthcoming. <i>\u201cI miss so many more jokes this way. Even more than normal.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cOkay,\n okay, O Kei.\u201d And so it began. Molly\u2019s tail lashed as he sat back, \nthough the grin quickly slipped off his face. What had happened to the \ncircus must\u2019ve really rattled him. I wasn\u2019t nearly as close to anyone \nthere as Molly was, but spontaneous zombies weren\u2019t reassuring either. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t quite get that, Rin, but don\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t think you got \nwhat I said earlier.\u201d</p><p>This time, Isobu did translate, and Rin\u2019s reply amounted to, \u201cThanks for your patience!\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre you doing some kind of ventriloquist thing?\u201d Beau asked Rin.</p><p>After Isobu repeated the question\u2014and finally explained what a ventriloquist was\u2014Rin said,<i> \u201cIsobu speaks two languages. I don\u2019t. I like the idea of having Isobu as our translator.\u201d </i>Rin added, after a moment\u2019s thought,<i> \u201cHe\u2019s really quite clever about it.\u201d</i></p><p>This didn\u2019t seem to work out for Beau, but it wasn\u2019t like she could interrogate her.</p><p><i>\u201cYou say that now.\u201d</i>\n I sighed, then I looked squarely to Beauregard and had a sudden flash \nof Yugito, who was one of the few people I knew who played devil\u2019s \nadvocate because she had a chip on her shoulder the size of Matatabi. \n\u201cNonetheless. If you need any help with this, count us in.\u201d</p><p>Rin nudged me once Isobu had translated.</p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d\n I corrected myself, \u201cmostly. If I skip sleeping any more, I\u2019ll be \nuseless for an investigation.\u201d What with the whole giant wolf problem, I\n could probably help with the investigation as long as Rin kept an eye \non Kakashi. Kakashi could clearly still recognize us while huge and \nfluffy and taken over by dog-instincts, but we didn\u2019t know what the \nexact catalyst for his transformation was and couldn\u2019t predict much \nabout it. </p><p>Molly didn\u2019t even blink as the opportunity for innuendo passed. Maybe he really was distracted. </p><p>\u201cThat\n is good for now. Now we are just waiting for the stinky wizard and the \nlittle one to join us finally.\u201d Jester glanced up at the door. Per \nMolly, they\u2019d branched off to search the town on their own because they \nwere the only ones not slapped with \u201cperson of interest\u201d status. </p><p><i>\u201cRin? Do you know anything?\u201d </i>I asked.</p><p>Rin shook her head even before I finished asking the question.<i> \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know who those people might be.\u201d</i></p><p>And I hadn\u2019t been in town back then. Oh well. To the others, I said, \u201cSo, what do we do for now?\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately,\n we were in a tavern. There was an obvious option. Molly checked his \ncoin purse and clearly thought of ordering everything. He leaned back a \nbit in his seat to get the barkeep\u2019s attention. </p><p>Oh dear.</p><p>\u201cYou know, O Kei, I haven\u2019t seen you drink in all the time I\u2019ve known you. Teetotaler?\u201d Molly asked. </p><p>\u201cI\n found out four years ago I\u2019m literally incapable of getting drunk,\u201d I \nsaid, though the entirely unfair contest with the Whitebeard Pirates had\n been kind of funny. It\u2019d turned into more of a bladder endurance match \nthan anything after about the fifteenth drink. \u201cAnd before that, it \nwasn\u2019t to my taste.\u201d </p><p>Molly\n and Beau were both looking at me like I\u2019d told them I had a terminal \ndisease. I could feel the goblin\u2019s eyes on the side of my head, too. </p><p>\u201cOh, you poor dear,\u201d Molly began.</p><p>Rin laughed as I debated flipping Molly off for being a condescending prick. <i>\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t mean much in a society that has safe drinking water. Maybe it means more here?\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>\u201cAh, but we can make safe water. Therefore, there is no need to drink whatever that terrible stuff is.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Rin and Isobu exchanged a very silly low-five as I sighed. </p><p><i>\u201cNice to see you have my back,\u201d</i> I griped.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d\n said Beau, snapping her fingers to get my attention. I felt Isobu\u2019s \nhackles rise and had to silently shush him, or else he\u2019d have crunched \nthrough the table with all the restraint of, well, him. \u201cWhat\u2019s your \nstory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\n had some bad luck, and the circus helped me out with the papers and so \non,\u201d I said, meeting her gaze without changing my expression at all. I\u2019d\n been eyeballed by tougher customers before, and most of them had been \ntwo seconds leaping over obstacles to murder me. This was nothing. \u201cAnd \nhelped me reunite with Rin, even if they didn\u2019t know I\u2019d find her in \nTrostenwald. So, here we are.\u201d </p><p>Beau\n scowled. \u201cThen what was that about not moving at night? You\u2019re not \nwanted by the Crownsguard. You didn\u2019t get arrested. What\u2019s the story \nthere?\u201d </p><p>I\n thought about making a sexually suggestive quip solely to get Beau to \nstop bothering me, then dismissed the option. Instead, I looked to Rin \nfor confirmation and got another bored shrug in response. Rin was too \nbusy trying to decide if she was going to be in the throes of her \ncuriosity to bother with me. Rin was just having fun with Science, and \nJester seemed patient enough to tolerate the prodding.</p><p>\u201cCall\n it luck,\u201d I suggested. \u201cI had the night off. And for better or for \nworse, the Crownsguard hasn\u2019t assumed all tieflings know each other.\u201d </p><p>Molly\n flipped me off with his free hand, not even bothering to put his drink \ndown. Entirely in line with circus communication as I\u2019d seen it.</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t know you until today.\u201d Jester tilted her head to one side, like a dog hearing a new sound. </p><p>Speaking of, was that shouting coming from outside? And growling. </p><p>Um.</p><p>\u201cBe right back!\u201d </p>",

            "comment": "<p>\n<b>Kei: </b>Trip over multiple plot hooks, because some inconsiderate jerk left them lying around everywhere.\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>In terms of folklore, lycanthropy took a variety of forms. Yes, that was a pun, but wordplay didn\u2019t make my point less valid. </p><p>According\n to some myths, being turned into a werewolf was a matter of taking a \ncontract with an evil spirit. Or getting cursed by a god for fucking up \nthe laws of hospitality so badly that, while Tantalus was probably still\n the exemplar, punishment was necessary. Maybe the moon was, or wasn\u2019t, \ninvolved. Getting nibbled on by Canis lupus lupus\n came about later, because for whatever reason rabies transmission and \nwerewolves didn\u2019t get together until pulp fiction. Some werewolves got \ntheir curse from picking flowers from graveyards. Not all were-whatever \ncreatures were wolves, were evil, or even changed shape at all. Hell, \nmaybe the stories were just coverups for serial killers in the age of \nwitch trials.</p><p>The trouble started once the moon rose.</p><p>I\u2019d\n never especially paid attention to lunar cycles beyond what was \nnecessary. Plenty of Konoha traditions ran on a Western calendar pulled \nout of a different universe, and so bright moons existed for Tsukimi \nfestivals and ruining stealth missions the world over. After the fact, I\n recalled that the moon had been there, but that was it. </p><p><b>To the point, mind.</b></p><p>At\n the time things went weird, Rin and I were out and about. The autumn \nevening was nippy, not truly cold. Between my circus-given coat and \nRin\u2019s sudden acquisition of a winter Konoha cloak, we were all right. \nThe town was quieter at night, with the closest thing to a true \nnightlife taking up the fairgrounds and the circus\u2019s attention. With any\n luck, we\u2019d have a nice, quiet night and raid the closest thing this \ntown had to a library. Even without electric lighting, there had to be \nsomething we could find.</p><p><i>\u201cWhile we\u2019re away from the circus, I have a question I don\u2019t think was answered,\u201d</i>\n said Rin, as we headed to the lakeshore. The moon\u2019s reflection was \nbright silver in the water, which almost made up for the smell of fish \nand muck. </p><p>Both of us sat down on an empty dock. I could see quite a ways, and Rin cocked her head to one side as she thought.</p><p><i>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d</i> I said, turning my flat yellow eyes to her. </p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019ve had a while to come up with a hypothesis,\u201d </i>Rin began, pressing her fingertips together as she thought. <i>\u201cNow that I\u2019ve met Yasha, and Molly, and also your new form, I think I have enough data. Do you think everyone has been modified somehow?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWe\u2019re kind of a small sample size,\u201d</i> I muttered, but that was as solid as my objections went. <i>\u201cYour changes are cosmetic, right?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t think they are. I mean, yes, my eyes and my hair are different, but there are so many other things.\u201d</i> She held a hand out in front of her and pointed at the moon, frowning. <i>\u201cIt\n may just be a trick my brain is playing on me, but I\u2019m sure my night \nvision wasn\u2019t this good before we got here. I can see fifteen meters \nfarther than I should be able to right now, even with full moonlight. \nDid something similar happen to you?\u201d</i></p><p>I nodded. <i>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026not dark where it should be.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cExactly! And then when I met Molly, I felt my skin crawling even though he hadn\u2019t done anything. It was a totally irrational feeling.\u201d</i>\n Rin threw her hands up in frustration. Her multicolored eyes seemed to \nflash in the dark, catching the moonlight strangely in my modified \nvision. <i>\u201cThere was some little itchy part of me that was just as upset with Yasha for something. It was completely at odds with my first impressions of almost everyone I\u2019ve ever met, including Orochimaru.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI haven\u2019t felt anything like that,\u201d</i> I said. If I tried, I could probably find something deep\n in the factoid-centric part of my brain to explain it, but I didn\u2019t \nknow for sure. But if Yasha and Molly gave off the same feeling, maybe \nthey both weren\u2019t human? <i>\u201cBut I\u2019ve kind of been distracted by\u2026y\u2019know.\u201d</i> I tried to wave my tail to catch Rin\u2019s attention and accidentally smacked her in the leg instead.</p><p><i>\u201cI do know!\u201d </i>Rin said good-naturedly, waving off my attempted apology. <i>\u201cAnd\n I also discovered I can heal without using chakra. I don\u2019t understand \nit, but there\u2019s plenty in this world I don\u2019t understand.\u201d </i>She nodded firmly and clenched her fists as though her determination alone would wrestle truth from the air. <i>\u201cI will, though. Every magic is just insufficiently understood until testing begins!\u201d</i></p><p><b>I missed her.</b> Isobu stretched out with all of his tails and both forelegs, draping himself over Rin\u2019s lap.<i> \u201c<b>Your excessive scientific enthusiasm is a relief, you know.</b>\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAw, you\u2019re making me blush.\u201d </i>Rin pressed her hands to her cheeks theatrically, then settled into tweaking the tips of Isobu\u2019s tails. <i>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019ve been here for Kei. It\u2019s awful to be alone.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou were.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd that\u2019s how I know it\u2019s awful.\u201d</i></p><p>All\n three of us sighed at the same time. Even the turtle. We were a long \nway from home with no way to go back immediately. It sucked no matter \nhow many times it happened. </p><p>Which\n was about when I felt a faint ping at the far end of my chakra sensing \nrange. Instantly, my head jerked in the relevant direction and every \nmuscle on me tensed up, which Rin couldn\u2019t miss on her worst day. </p><p><i>\u201cI think we just found a friend,\u201d</i> I heard myself say.</p><p><i>\u201cWho is it?\u201d</i>\n Rin asked, following me eagerly as we got to our feet and started \nstriding toward the edge of town. It felt like the right direction. </p><p>Except for the lake. </p><p>The\n lightning I was following wasn\u2019t a part of a storm, a spell, or \nanything else conveniently explainable by this world\u2019s phenomena. Not at\n all. I\u2019d know that walking live wire anywhere, and I started to pick up\n the pace toward the signature even as it took me toward the water. </p><p><i>\u201cOh, I know who this is!\u201d </i>Rin chirped, and darted after me as we hurried across the waves. Isobu was still clamped tight in her arms. </p><p>What kind of shinobi would we be if we let a little water stop us from checking in? </p><p>The\n Ustaloch was a kidney bean-shaped body of water that seemed to be a \nfocal point of local superstition. Rin had encountered giant water \nsnakes here during her week\u2019s stay, which seemed to be native. After \ntying them in a knot, there wasn\u2019t much else to prove to the \nout-of-place fauna. Rin knew it, I knew it, and anything that survived a\n Rin-rampage was probably going to live long enough to learn it. </p><p>Thus, we didn\u2019t run into any threats for a while. </p><p>The\n lakeshore butted up against forest, but not true woods as we\u2019d come to \nunderstand in Konoha. There, the trees were wider around than any human \narm-span at a dead minimum. Here, I got the impression that the logging \nindustry was less of an organized affair and more just because people \naround here didn\u2019t have any other way to heat their houses in the \nwinter. Coming to a world without basic amenities felt like such a step \nback it wasn\u2019t on the same continent.</p><p>And we weren\u2019t.</p><p>My feet hit sand again a little before Rin\u2019s did, and we clambered up onto the shore and into tree cover. </p><p><i>\u201cWait\u2026 Is that\u2026?\u201d</i> Rin murmured behind me, just as the source of Kakashi\u2019s chakra signature padded into view.</p><p>My first thought was, <i>Holy fuck he\u2019s a werewolf.</i></p><p>My second was, <i>Oh fucking hell he\u2019s big.</i></p><p>Hanging\n around summoned animals a lot had a way of messing with one\u2019s sense of \nscale, but I was still sure the white wolf in front of me had to be well\n over three times as big as a normal one. At least. The heavy snow-white\n coat was interrupted only by a black muzzle split by two rows of \nwhite-and-red teeth and a dark spot over his left eye, like someone \ncopy-pasted the coat of a sweet mutt over a dire wolf\u2019s frame. All of \nhis teeth were bared and his breath formed thick fog in the moonlit cold\n air. </p><p>That rumble definitely wasn\u2019t thunder. Instead, it sounded like a growl.</p><p><b>You know, I think I could keep him from biting anyone.</b></p><p>Well, I thought as I felt Rin grip my arm, shit.</p><p>Rin\n and I started moving parallel to the massive wolf, along the lakeshore \nand through cattails. Neither of us took our eyes off him.</p><p>Sure,\n Kakashi\u2019s long strides mirrored my movements exactly like a large \npredator would, but hell. I was at least as vicious as a wolf of any \nsize. And he didn\u2019t seem to want to head into the water. Instead, those \nmismatched eyes stayed on us, glittering in the dark. If I had to guess,\n neither Rin nor I came up to his shoulder. Rin in particular. </p><p><b>He can bite me.</b></p><p>There were, apparently, some concrete benefits to having an invulnerable companion. Same principle as a crocodile,\n I theorized. My thoughts weren\u2019t too frantic, though seeing a Sharingan\n in a wolf\u2019s face was fairly unsettling. There wasn\u2019t any recognition in\n that gaze that I could detect. Wolves have more muscles to close their jaws than they do to open them. Or at least the muscles are stronger.</p><p>I\n felt Rin\u2019s chakra pulse as she activated the first stage of her \nStrength of a Hundred seal, just in case. Well, there went the threat \nlevel of this little encounter. On his best day, Kakashi couldn\u2019t hope \nto beat Rin at arm wrestling. On Rin\u2019s best day, <i>Gamabunta </i>would lose.</p><p><i>\u201cLet me know if you want me to keep him busy,\u201d</i> Rin said softly. </p><p>Out of the corner of my mouth, I said, <i>\u201cMaybe once I have a plan. Isobu\u2019s talking.\u201d</i></p><p><b>Speaking\n of, I meant \u201che can bite me\u201d more in the manner of a dog trying to pick\n up a ball too big for its mouth. You know the look.</b></p><p>\u2026Isobu.</p><p><b>If it works, I doubt either of </b><b>us</b><b> will care how silly it looks. And Rin would hardly mention it. </b></p><p>Isobu, please don\u2019t break his teeth. We have no idea how any of this shit works.</p><p><b>Having not seen a competent dentist\u2026 Fine.</b></p><p>I\n picked Isobu up by his shell. In my hands, he curled into a spiked \nmedicine ball of doom. Tossing him up and down a few times to get a \nsense of his weight, I nodded to Rin. Then I held him one-handed and \neyed Kakashi\u2019s growling form. </p><p><i>\u201cChew on this,\u201d</i> I suggested cheerfully, and pitched Isobu right at his face.</p><p>Once\n upon a time, a version of me with her nose constantly in a book read an\n awful lot about strange beasts and magical principles. I\u2019d never lived \nthose rules, of course, because there was one such system in my life and\n it was already bullshit enough for two. But in those books had been \nstories of how all sorts of animal minds worked.</p><p>Per\n the works of one Sir Terry Pratchett, werewolves kept one foot in the \nhuman world and a paw in the world of wolves. Made them a bit of both. \nAnd what did you call a wolf with human influence spanning back \ngenerations uncounted?</p><p>Maybe, just a bit, there was a bit of dog in there.</p><p>I probably should have predicted what happened next.</p><p>Kakashi\n whipped his huge head around and snatched Isobu neatly out of the air. \nHe fumbled for a split second, teeth or tongue catching Isobu\u2019s spikes \nthe wrong way, but stubbornly refused to let the little monster drop. \nThe head jerk motion was nearly the same as a natural wolf\u2019s, but it\u2019d \nbeen designed for prey the equivalent size of a mouse. Isobu was a \nlittle too round and tough.</p><p>Isobu\n hadn\u2019t discussed his next move with me, but in theory he was capable of\n keeping Kakashi\u2019s entire head restrained with just his tails. He \nstarted to uncoil, gripping fur with his little hands.</p><p>And then Kakashi shook his head exactly\n like the signature back-breaking swing I\u2019d only observed in terriers \nbefore. Also in Pakkun, but Pakkun hunted about as often as pigs flew. \nIsobu made a noise like a pissed-off cat and two of his tails looped \naround Kakashi\u2019s lower jaw, but that didn\u2019t seem to stop him. He just \nadjusted his grip on Isobu and half-closed his eyes, shaking my combat \nbuddy so hard I heard Isobu swear inside my head from frustration.</p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s not hurting him, is it?\u201d</i> Rin asked worriedly.</p><p>Isobu\u2019s cursing was definitely the angry kind.</p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014Kakashi, is that fun?\u201d</i> I asked before I could stop myself. </p><p>At\n the sound of my voice, his mismatched eyes locked on me again. I wasn\u2019t\n sure he recognized my voice, because both of our bodies were kinda \nfucked up and our faces were\u2026intact. Hell if I knew what we smelled \nlike.</p><p>Rin at least looked like herself, even if she was glowing a bit from her jutsu. </p><p>Then\n he dropped his chest and forelegs to the bank, his straight tail up and\n wagging. His non-Sharingan eye angled up, toward us, and one of his \nears almost flopped as he let out a noise not unlike a growl. But \nhigher.</p><p><i>\u201cOh no.\u201d</i> I fought valiantly to keep my hand from hitting my face. I had horns now. It\u2019d probably hurt.<i> \u201cNo.\u201d</i></p><p>Rin started to snicker.</p><p><b>I take back what I said about my brilliant plan.</b></p><p>You made that bed, and now you get to lie in it, I told him, but I stepped toward the bank anyway.</p><p>Kakashi skittered back at least a meter.</p><p>I stepped forward twice. </p><p>Kakashi retreated two meters.</p><p>Aw, dammit. I facepalmed anyway, and damn the consequences. <i>\u201cHey, Kakashi. Drop him, please.\u201d</i></p><p>Kakashi\u2019s response was something like <i>\u201cAwuf.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cKakashi.\u201d </i>I crouched just a bit, my tail lashing.<i> \u201cCome on, drop the turtle.\u201d</i></p><p>Though her hands covered her mouth, Rin managed to say, <i>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s listening.\u201d</i></p><p>He did not drop the turtle. In fact, he turned tail and booked it when I darted for Isobu\u2019s loose tail. The only saving grace was that the island wasn\u2019t that big. He couldn\u2019t run forever.</p><p><i>\u201cI DON\u2019T CARE IF YOU\u2019RE A HUNDRED KILOS BIGGER, GET BACK HERE!\u201d</i></p><p>Rin was too doubled over with laughter to help. </p><p>Like I said. Probably should have seen that coming.</p><p>It\n took five hours for Kakashi to finally keel over for a nap. Still giant\n and wolfy and with Isobu trapped between his dinner plate paws, but at \nleast he stopped running. The night\u2019s festivities were like playing keep\n away if the ball kept shrieking out of injured pride, chasing away \nnesting birds and generally making a racket. Had I actually been able to\n sleep, it probably would have pissed me off something fierce. \nOtherwise, the screaming mostly marked Kakashi\u2019s location and helped me \nkeep a bead on them while the chase was on.</p><p>As\n a direct result of these shenanigans, I was dead on my feet by morning.\n Plenty of chakra left, but not perhaps the best control. Also, crabbier\n than Isobu. In my experience, no amount of foreign caffeine made up for\n just never getting to sleep, even if I knew where to get any. </p><p>Rin patted my head when I mentioned this problem. <i>\u201cI\u2019m sure Kakashi had fun.\u201d</i></p><p>At\n least I could lean against Kakashi\u2019s white flank to rest once he \nsettled. Rin was sitting on his other side, humming as she did a medical\n scan. All the data was coming up Dog. I supposed he could\n be a dire wolf, albeit one with strange markings. I had a vague notion \nthat real dire wolves were supposed to have spikes like Isobu, though. \nAnd be a lot more aggressive than Kakashi was, once the ice was broken. </p><p>While\n dawn\u2019s first light touched the treetops and the sky turned orange and \nclouds became pink, Kakashi raised his huge head with his tongue lolling\n out of his mouth. He nosed at the world\u2019s most dangerous tennis ball, \nand Isobu roused. </p><p>Isobu,\n still trapped between his paws, grumbled like an annoyed alligator and \npoked his head out of the mountain of fur. He tolerated the prodding \nwith bad grace, then said, <i><b>\u201cI cannot help but notice that he is still huge and fluffy.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s\n been bothering me, too. I mean, he\u2019s a perfectly healthy giant animal \nat the moment, but he has Kakashi\u2019s chakra signature.\u201d</i> When I leaned my head back to look askance at her, Rin could only shrug. <i>\u201cReally. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on! This is magic, and that\u2019s both intriguing and incredibly frustrating.\u201d</i> She patted Kakashi\u2019s fur. <i>\u201cWe\u2019ll get you back to normal somehow, all right?\u201d</i></p><p>Kakashi made a \u201cwhuf\u201d noise and twisted until his snout could nearly rest in my lap. Then he sighed, as though content. </p><p>Unfortunately,\n I couldn\u2019t wait forever. I lifted his head off me about five minutes \nlater, letting him make sad puppy eyes at me as I got to my feet. Next \non my to-do list was tearing into my emergency supplies.</p><p>Yes, I still had them in a storage seal in my foot. It was harder to replace than conventionally stored bags. </p><p>At\n some point during life as a member of any shinobi corps, people learned\n to pack efficiently whether they wanted to or not. Setting aside the \nperennial issue of folding versus rolling and how putting storage \nscrolls inside of each other tended to result in explosions, I retrieved\n three full sets of clothes that didn\u2019t compensate for the tail I \nsported now. Fortunately, one of them turned out to be Izo\u2019s \nWhitebeard-emblazoned T-shirt and the bright red jacket (designed for \npeople who were over two meters tall). Uniform pants were a little \nharder to be sure of, but I had a pair cut for Obito since he was still in the \u201cthrow it all in\u201d school of keeping shit organized and needed a bit of help. Instead, I got to be pack mule.</p><p>By\n the time the sun rose, I expected Kakashi to turn back into a person. \nAt least then I could yell at him properly for scaring me.</p><p>Instead,\n he shook his head with so much force that he sent a ripple through his \nentire body, his ears pricking to attention. Rin\u2019s grip in his fur was \nthankfully strong enough to keep her from being tossed to the ground, \nbut it was a close thing. He rolled to his feet all at once, with Rin \nstill on his back, and looked around frantically until his mismatched \neyes landed on me.</p><p><i>\u201c\u2026You all right?\u201d</i> I asked, even as I raised my hand.</p><p>He\n pushed his nose into my hand. It was wet and his breath was hot, coming\n in quick pants. His normal eye was dark with the whites showing around \nthe edges, and his Sharingan spun slowly as fear set in.</p><p>I\n grabbed onto his fur with both hands. He lowered his head until I could\n press my forehead to his, planting a kiss in the middle of his fur. \nWhile the whine in his throat echoed up through me, too, I stroked the \nsides of his head and tried to soothe the fear. I could feel the panic \ntrying to control him and the growl starting to build, but I hung on \nanyway. I wasn\u2019t any better, now that I knew for sure he was really in there and not just his chakra. </p><p><i>\u201cShh, shh,\u201d</i> I\n murmured. Above my head, I felt Rin\u2019s hand briefly brush mine as she, \ntoo, tried her best to let Kakashi know we were both here for him.<i> \u201cI\u2019ve got you now, all right? Everything\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</i></p><p>Rin slid down his back until she could touch ground again. <i>\u201cYou look totally different, but you only just realized it now, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</i></p><p>Kakashi made a mournful noise, his ears flat against his skull. </p><p>It\n took us a while to convince him, but eventually Kakashi laid miserably \non the ground next to me. With my backpack wide open so Rin could use \nit, we all curled up together on that bleak little shore as Rin scanned \nhis chakra again. </p><p>Kakashi\n leaned into my side and my arm clung to his thick fur ruff. Though I \ncouldn\u2019t claim to be a mind reader, I was pretty good at moods if people\n around me had chakra to read. Kakashi did believe us, to a point, but \nthe rest of his signature rattled with undirected, unfamiliar fear. </p><p>Rin\n started slowly going through her medical checks. Her chakra was clamped\n down hard as her training took over, hands glowing faintly green in my \nmind\u2019s eye. Even from my comparatively amateur understanding of animal \ntransformations, Kakashi\u2019s stamina was shot to hell and his confidence \nhad taken a beating, so it was no wonder why Rin was so serious. At \nleast no one had hurt him before found him. That was something. </p><p>It had to be.</p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m here. We\u2019ll get through this.\u201d</i></p><p>Kakashi whined with his muzzle in his paws. In that tone, I heard, What happened?</p><p>While\n Rin scanned Kakashi for abnormalities, I explained what I knew about \nwerewolves\u2014infections and moon cycles, mostly\u2014and the knot of worry in \nmy stomach kept tightening alongside Kakashi\u2019s lightning chakra. It \ndidn\u2019t mean anything to him. It was all empty words. </p><p>I didn\u2019t know what the fuck I was talking about in this world, and that scared all of us.</p><p><i>\u201cDo you remember how you ended up this way?\u201d</i> I asked him, barely keeping my voice steady.</p><p>Kakashi shook his huge head just enough to get his point across, terrified of dislodging me. </p><p>Getting\n occasionally knocked unconscious or fainting were facts of life as \nshinobi. Kakashi, with the drain from the Sharingan, viewed the latter \nas an old and irritating friend. But losing control? Losing his body? Never. In his entire life, Kakashi lost a grand total of maybe an hour to altered states of consciousness from genjutsu tricks or getting drunk. His discipline allowed no more. </p><p>Losing control wasn\u2019t something he did. This was a whole new frontier of impossible to deal with.</p><p>He\n did his best to keep his eyes both locked on Rin as she took his pulse \nand listened to his breathing, trying to figure out where it had all \ngone wrong. She wasn\u2019t a vet. She\u2019d practiced on humans. We were so \nscrewed.</p><p><i>\u201cAs far as I can tell, you\u2019re perfectly healthy,\u201d</i> Rin said finally, running her fingers over one of his dinner plate-sized paws. <i>\u201cJust\n a giant wolf. This has to be another magic thing. It might also explain\n why it took you until now to remember you\u2019re supposed to be human. You \nreally didn\u2019t remember anything?\u201d</i></p><p>Lowering\n his head onto his paws again, he sighed deeply. Perhaps in direct \nresponse, Isobu started carding his much smaller hands through Kakashi\u2019s\n fur. Maybe he just wanted to see what it felt like. It wasn\u2019t like real\n animals often let him close. </p><p><i><b>\u201cFrom one perspective,\u201d</b></i> Isobu said thoughtfully, <b><i>\u201cit is very like being an inexperienced jinch\u016briki.\u201d</i></b> Bobbing in the lake, Isobu wiggled all of his tails as Kakashi jerked his head toward him.<b><i> \u201cI\n think Kei remembers her early experiences well because she did not \nreach V2 before learning some self-control. But I recall instances where\n other jinch\u016briki have not been so lucky.\u201d</i></b></p><p>Utakata\n came to mind immediately, though he\u2019d hit his berserker threshold early\n due to severe injury. All of his usual surgical precision careened out \nthe window. Then Blue B and the time Gy\u016bki\u2019s seal split wide open. And \nthen there was our very own Naruto\u2026</p><p><i>\u201cThough there is one big exception,\u201d</i>\n I said, when Kakashi made a little acknowledging noise. His feelings on\n the matter were still fairly negative, but he\u2019d dealt with worse. <i>\u201cI don\u2019t think you can exactly \u2018befriend\u2019 the wolf mind. At least, not like Isobu.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>\u201cI, for example, am a person. Your affliction seems to have superimposed the mind of a dog on top of yours. Temporarily.\u201d</b></i> Isobu eyed Kakashi carefully as he thought about what to say next. He tucked his little hands under his belly. <i>\u201c<b>Without a proper tongue, can you use that eye of yours to speak to us?</b>\u201d</i></p><p>I glanced down at the top of Kakashi\u2019s head. <i>\u201cThat might work?\u201d <br></i></p><p><i></i>I was mostly surprised that suggestion came from Isobu,\n because he\u2019d never been fond of Kakashi\u2019s use of the Sharingan. \nTolerated? Sure. Occasionally been grateful for in desperate \ncircumstances? Fine. But he generally didn\u2019t volunteer to have anything \nto do with the Sharingan if at all possible. </p><p><i>\u201cIf that would work, I think you\u2019re in the right place to try it.\u201d </i>Rin\u2019s eyes were a little glazed over as she went over the data her scan gave her, but she was clearly listening. </p><p>Kakashi\n made a curious noise in the back of his throat, ears twitching. He \nnosed at Isobu again, then met the little beastie\u2019s eye with his \nSharingan. As though now was the perfect time to test it. I kept my \nhands in his fur for the length of the staring contest, feeling my \nnerves tremble in anticipation of whatever other curveballs this place \ncould throw our way. We didn\u2019t need any more.</p><p>A second later, Isobu said as though in response to a question, <b>\u201c</b><b>No. There was a threat display</b><b>\u201d</b>\u2014which had been terrifying in the moment because I hadn\u2019t known what to do\u2014<b>\u201cbut once you had me in your teeth, it was all a game. You did not hurt anyone.</b><b>\u201d</b></p><p>I sagged in relief. Thank fuck it worked. </p><p>\u201cAnd then we had a nice nap. Or you did,\u201d Rin added, as Kakashi deflated slightly from sheer relief. His tail thumped the ground once while she spoke, \u201cWith Isobu tucked between your huge paws, after playing Keep Away with him.\u201d</p><p>Kakashi\n managed a mortified expression, even as near-unrecognizable as he was. \nHis chakra burned with shame. He whined uncomfortably.</p><p><i>\u201cYou absolutely did.\u201d</i> Rin smiled for the first time since Kakashi had realized the situation. She scratched his ears. <i>\u201cIt was worse than when Pakkun tried teaching a stray dog how Fetch worked.\u201d</i></p><p>Kakashi\n twisted his head over so he could rub at his Sharingan against his \nforeleg. Then he sighed up at both of us. Those eyes seemed to ask, <i>What now?</i></p><p>I\n had no idea. All I could think of was going back to the circus and \ntelling them I\u2019d have to leave for the foreseeable future, because my \nfianc\u00e9 had been magically transformed into an animal and everything was \nterrible. I couldn\u2019t stick around. Rin and I needed to find a way to fix\n this. </p><p>Kakashi sighed deeply. </p><p><i><b>\u201cBody modifications seem to be all the rage, now,\u201d</b></i>\n Isobu griped while we all tried to absorb what kind of situation we\u2019d \nbeen dropped into. He curled his tails around Rin\u2019s wrist and mine, then\n sat squarely on Kakashi\u2019s right front paw. <i><b>\u201cWe cannot \njust sit idle and hope for a solution to fall onto our heads. You are a \ndog, I am small, Kei has a limb she cannot use, and Rin has also been \nchanged on some spiritual level. These things are unfortunate, but we \nare alive. We are capable. And we will find a way to get our bodies \nback.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Kakashi snorted, but he accepted the ear rubs when Rin offered. </p><p>For\n normal people, the phrase \u201chiked the lake back to town\u201d probably needed\n to be modified by the word \u201caround.\u201d Not so for us. Even \nKakashi-turned-Suicune. Or whatever he was. </p><p>At least<i> something</i> went right today.</p><p>This feeling did not last once the morning mist burned off, because it never did. Town was different overnight.</p><p>Trekking\n back to the circus, only to find that everyone was under house arrest \nand the place was on lockdown thanks to the Crownsguard, was a bit of a \nshock. Learning about a minor zombie outbreak followed in that vein, \nbecause of course it did. Since I couldn\u2019t waltz into camp without a \ndisguise and daylight guards were almost always more alert than \ngraveyard-shifters, the three of us moved on to poking the periphery.</p><p>\u201cSorry\n if this is\u2026rude, but, uh.\u201d Without the brightly colored costumes the \ncircus folks wore, I at least couldn\u2019t be instantly picked out as one of\n the crew. It was pragmatic, but not particularly nice for the ones \nwho\u2019d been arrested. \u201cIf I could just get past\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove\n along already, you nosy devil.\u201d The Crownsguard spat to the side even \nas all of us watched him. \u201cEveryone here is under suspicion of murder.\u201d </p><p>Kakashi, with his fur held tight by Rin\u2019s hands, didn\u2019t quite manage to avoid growling as the guard got in my face. </p><p>\u201cKeep your damn dog on a leash,\u201d was the guard\u2019s suggestion before he really got sick of us. </p><p>In\n some worlds, dogs wore collars. Or service vests. Or both. To get \nKakashi\u2019s way-too-damn-big wolf form into town, Rin and I puzzled over \nthe problem until we remembered the vests and headbands Kakashi made for\n all of his dogs back when he had proper thumbs instead of dewclaws. So,\n after digging through our emergency supplies and scrubbing what seemed \nto be deer blood from around Kakashi\u2019s dark muzzle, we\u2019d collaborated.</p><p>The\n Whitebeard jacket was tied around his thick neck like a cheery little \nscarf, the sleeves arranged into a bow. Somehow combining that with a \nleash made of rope\u2014attached to the jacket, not his neck\u2014made him a \u201cdog\u201d\n in human brains. </p><p>A very, <i>very</i> big dog that smelled like the forest. </p><p>Isobu might\u2019ve messed with the guards\u2019 heads a bit to make it work, but it worked no matter how much we cheated. Therefore, it was victory through technicality. </p><p>Kakashi\n was very patient through the entire process and even let a different \nguard shake his paw, which was more than I would have offered at the \ntime. Then again, I probably would have been turned into a turtle if I \nwasn\u2019t already a demon-blooded person. Apparently. </p><p>In the end, we ditched the crime scene and went looking around for help.</p><p><i><b>\u201cIt could have been more humiliating if we tried, yes,\u201d</b></i> Isobu said to Kakashi\u2019s apparently Sharingan-transferred question. <i><b>\u201cI have already pretended to be a ventriloquist dummy. Most people do not realize I am a person, either.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Kakashi sighed, and both Rin and I patted his hulking shoulders. </p><p>And,\n because Kakashi\u2019s nose was more useful than my inherent radar in a \nworld where only the four of us had chakra, we managed to track down the\n only member of the circus who wasn\u2019t trapped either in the stockade or \nthe campground. It took a few minutes, and we scared more than a few \npeople while trotting through town in our search, but we did it. I could\n tell that the second Kakashi turned up his nose and refused to even \nthink of walking into a building, because he was too busy sneezing. </p><p>It\n turned out that only so many people smelled like a combination of \npatchouli, road dust, and stale alcohol, even in a town with a \ndecent-sized population. Really, the patchouli was the defining factor \nwhen it came to Mollymauk Tealeaf. And not tea. </p><p>I\u2019d\n noticed strange things in the performers\u2019 boxes while helping out at \nthe circus, but I couldn\u2019t track a drop of perfume across a country. \nKakashi could. Even if he still hated the smell. </p><p>There was a comparison to be made to Prince Humperdinck, but that was a different story.</p><p>Anyway, we found the world\u2019s most colorful fortune teller in an inn off the side of the street. </p><p>Kakashi\n and Isobu stayed outside, with Isobu sitting on the end of his lead as \nthough he was responsible in the slightest. Kakashi, for his part, \nsettled on the ground with his muzzle on his paws and made a miserable \nnoise. The smell of alcohol didn\u2019t agree with him, but bacon probably \ndid. There was a hindbrain-level instinct for meat rattling around in \nthere. </p><p>I needed to find some way to feed him, and it couldn\u2019t involve setting him loose on wildlife. Unless he wanted to do that. </p><p>Molly\n wasn\u2019t terribly colorful when I walked in, or at least hadn\u2019t been for a\n bit. Instead, Molly sat at a table and carefully wiped off enough \nmakeup to disguise a clown. His solid red gaze darted to me and then Rin\n when he noticed us entering the Nestled Nook Inn, and he waved with his\n free hand. \u201cGood to see you, Carey. Rin, too. Rough night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Okay, where did I start? \u201cI guess. I think yours might\u2019ve been worse.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh,\n I don\u2019t know.\u201d Molly eyed me as the last of the peach-colored makeup \nwas wiped away. \u201cWhat\u2019s an unjust arrest and unfriendly small town, in \nthe grand scheme of things? Sure, the Crownsguard are probably going to \nkill us all if they can\u2019t find whoever turned the old man into a \nmonster, but\u2026\u201d Molly paused. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s really a \nbright side to that. How about you?\u201d </p><p>I glanced at Rin, who shrugged. Ought I tell Molly about Kakashi\u2019s rather fuzzy problem? Or Rin\u2019s super strength?</p><p>\u201cDid\n your friend just keep you up all night?\u201d Molly flashed a sharp-toothed \ngrin, but his heart wasn\u2019t in it. While the grin didn\u2019t waver, my \nstone-faced response didn\u2019t seem to be encouraging. \u201cTrouble in \nparadise?\u201d he tried again.</p><p><b>Was that supposed to be an innuendo?</b></p><p><i>Yeah, nope. Not telling him shit.</i> I\n ignored the comment and sat down at the table, followed almost \nimmediately by Rin and then Isobu as he rolled into the bar area, the \nlatter of whom couldn\u2019t see over the edge of the table. </p><p>He did send me an awful image of the underside of said table, just to be an ass. Or to repay my comment, perhaps. </p><p>I shook the picture from my mind\u2019s eye and asked Molly, \u201cWhat exactly happened last night?\u201d </p><p>Molly\n did lay his cards out on the table, once I proved unwilling to play \nalong with any teasing. He explained, likely not for the first time, \nthat the show had gone on exactly as it always had for the majority of \nthe time last night. Right up until an old man turned into an undead \nmonster and killed someone else, who then also\n turned into an undead monster. Running with the theory that the circus \nwasn\u2019t in the business of murdering customers, Molly and his new \nco-conspirators\u2014coincidentally the same motley crew he\u2019d charmed into \nattending just yesterday morning\u2014had spent most of today investigating \nthe old man\u2019s usual haunts.</p><p>\u201cAnd we found basically nothing,\u201d said a new voice. </p><p>I\n leaned back a bit and spotted a woman in blue robes stomping down the \nstairs. Now that I had better light and more inclination to give a shit,\n the blue fabric of her outfit reminded me quite a lot\n of some of the more coastal towns in the Land of Fire and perhaps even \nwhat I\u2019d seen in the Fire Temple I\u2019d visited once. Though the specific \npattern was unfamiliar, there were some similarities to the cloth used \nin the Land of Water as well. Her features were more like mine than, \nsay, any human I\u2019d met so far. </p><p>Actually, she kind of looked like Sokka.</p><p><b>I do not see how that helps us.</b></p><p>That\n woman was followed almost immediately by a blue tiefling with dark, \nbackward-curling, silver-capped horns more like Molly\u2019s than mine. She \nwas probably a hand\u2019s span shorter than I was, wearing a dark blue slit \nskirt peppered with peach and pink tones. Her sleeves almost reached the\n floor, but in a Western style instead of a furisode, and she wore both a\n half-length green cape and a sickle in a sheath on her belt. </p><p>And\n then there was the half-orc behind her, dressed head to toe in dark \nleather armor. The two-tone green on him looked a little odd when I \nthought back to the only other half-orc I knew, but I was literally \ndull, dark pink all over and two of the other people at the table were \nblue and lavender. At this point, the time for pointing fingers was \npast. A scar bisected his eyebrow and formed an X further up his face, \nand his hair was dark, half-shaved, and sported a sharp gray streak. If I\n had to guess, he might\u2019ve been older than I was, and he was definitely \naround Kakashi\u2019s height. </p><p>Well, before he got turned into a giant wolf.</p><p>I\n cleared my throat as our table got a bit more crowded, thanks to the \nwoman in blue, the blue tiefling, and the half-orc from the last inn \nincursion. I cleared my throat. \u201cOkay. Well, then, it\u2019s about time for \nintroductions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems\n like we\u2019re all in the same boat,\u201d agreed the half-orc as he dragged a \nchair over to the table. \u201cI figure Molly might\u2019ve introduced us, but \nagain from the top, just so we\u2019re all clear. The name\u2019s Fjord, with a \nJ.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\n am Jester!\u201d Jester beamed as she followed suit, sliding into place next\n to Fjord. \u201cI didn\u2019t get any of your names before, but it is very nice \nto meet you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeau,\n short for Beauregard,\u201d was the monk\u2019s terse response. Though I \ncertainly couldn\u2019t make judgement calls on what parents named their \nkids, Beau still added, \u201cMy parents wanted a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\n see,\u201d I said, while Isobu clambered up onto the edge of the table and \nfolded his forelegs like some kind of mob boss. He didn\u2019t quite have the\n shoulder rotation range, however. \u201cBy the way, Molly, I wanted to \napologize for something else.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, we can get that out of the way first.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\n lied when I told all of you my name, before.\u201d I picked Gustav\u2019s fake \nidentification paperwork out of a pocket and set it flat on the table. \nBeauregard just picked it up to stare at it, scrutinizing me. \u201cIf you \nall like, you can call me Keisuke. Or Kei. These two do.\u201d </p><p>Isobu nodded firmly. \u201c<b>The\n fake name was useful for deflecting attention, but there does not seem \nto be much point. There is no one here to recognize us. Thus, you may \ncall me Isobu.</b>\u201d His eye narrowed to a glowing red slit that made him look like a monster from the depths, if the depths were floor height. \u201c<b>And if any of you call me </b><i><b>anything</b></i><b> but my name, I will douse you in ice water until you learn better.</b>\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cOh, I wish I spoke this language,\u201d </i>Rin said after a second, waiting for an Isobu translation that didn\u2019t seem to be forthcoming. <i>\u201cI miss so many more jokes this way. Even more than normal.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cOkay,\n okay, O Kei.\u201d And so it began. Molly\u2019s tail lashed as he sat back, \nthough the grin quickly slipped off his face. What had happened to the \ncircus must\u2019ve really rattled him. I wasn\u2019t nearly as close to anyone \nthere as Molly was, but spontaneous zombies weren\u2019t reassuring either. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t quite get that, Rin, but don\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t think you got \nwhat I said earlier.\u201d</p><p>This time, Isobu did translate, and Rin\u2019s reply amounted to, \u201cThanks for your patience!\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre you doing some kind of ventriloquist thing?\u201d Beau asked Rin.</p><p>After Isobu repeated the question\u2014and finally explained what a ventriloquist was\u2014Rin said,<i> \u201cIsobu speaks two languages. I don\u2019t. I like the idea of having Isobu as our translator.\u201d </i>Rin added, after a moment\u2019s thought,<i> \u201cHe\u2019s really quite clever about it.\u201d</i></p><p>This didn\u2019t seem to work out for Beau, but it wasn\u2019t like she could interrogate her.</p><p><i>\u201cYou say that now.\u201d</i>\n I sighed, then I looked squarely to Beauregard and had a sudden flash \nof Yugito, who was one of the few people I knew who played devil\u2019s \nadvocate because she had a chip on her shoulder the size of Matatabi. \n\u201cNonetheless. If you need any help with this, count us in.\u201d</p><p>Rin nudged me once Isobu had translated.</p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d\n I corrected myself, \u201cmostly. If I skip sleeping any more, I\u2019ll be \nuseless for an investigation.\u201d What with the whole giant wolf problem, I\n could probably help with the investigation as long as Rin kept an eye \non Kakashi. Kakashi could clearly still recognize us while huge and \nfluffy and taken over by dog-instincts, but we didn\u2019t know what the \nexact catalyst for his transformation was and couldn\u2019t predict much \nabout it. </p><p>Molly didn\u2019t even blink as the opportunity for innuendo passed. Maybe he really was distracted. </p><p>\u201cThat\n is good for now. Now we are just waiting for the stinky wizard and the \nlittle one to join us finally.\u201d Jester glanced up at the door. Per \nMolly, they\u2019d branched off to search the town on their own because they \nwere the only ones not slapped with \u201cperson of interest\u201d status. </p><p><i>\u201cRin? Do you know anything?\u201d </i>I asked.</p><p>Rin shook her head even before I finished asking the question.<i> \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know who those people might be.\u201d</i></p><p>And I hadn\u2019t been in town back then. Oh well. To the others, I said, \u201cSo, what do we do for now?\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately,\n we were in a tavern. There was an obvious option. Molly checked his \ncoin purse and clearly thought of ordering everything. He leaned back a \nbit in his seat to get the barkeep\u2019s attention. </p><p>Oh dear.</p><p>\u201cYou know, O Kei, I haven\u2019t seen you drink in all the time I\u2019ve known you. Teetotaler?\u201d Molly asked. </p><p>\u201cI\n found out four years ago I\u2019m literally incapable of getting drunk,\u201d I \nsaid, though the entirely unfair contest with the Whitebeard Pirates had\n been kind of funny. It\u2019d turned into more of a bladder endurance match \nthan anything after about the fifteenth drink. \u201cAnd before that, it \nwasn\u2019t to my taste.\u201d </p><p>Molly\n and Beau were both looking at me like I\u2019d told them I had a terminal \ndisease. I could feel the goblin\u2019s eyes on the side of my head, too. </p><p>\u201cOh, you poor dear,\u201d Molly began.</p><p>Rin laughed as I debated flipping Molly off for being a condescending prick. <i>\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t mean much in a society that has safe drinking water. Maybe it means more here?\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>\u201cAh, but we can make safe water. Therefore, there is no need to drink whatever that terrible stuff is.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Rin and Isobu exchanged a very silly low-five as I sighed. </p><p><i>\u201cNice to see you have my back,\u201d</i> I griped.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d\n said Beau, snapping her fingers to get my attention. I felt Isobu\u2019s \nhackles rise and had to silently shush him, or else he\u2019d have crunched \nthrough the table with all the restraint of, well, him. \u201cWhat\u2019s your \nstory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\n had some bad luck, and the circus helped me out with the papers and so \non,\u201d I said, meeting her gaze without changing my expression at all. I\u2019d\n been eyeballed by tougher customers before, and most of them had been \ntwo seconds leaping over obstacles to murder me. This was nothing. \u201cAnd \nhelped me reunite with Rin, even if they didn\u2019t know I\u2019d find her in \nTrostenwald. So, here we are.\u201d </p><p>Beau\n scowled. \u201cThen what was that about not moving at night? You\u2019re not \nwanted by the Crownsguard. You didn\u2019t get arrested. What\u2019s the story \nthere?\u201d </p><p>I\n thought about making a sexually suggestive quip solely to get Beau to \nstop bothering me, then dismissed the option. Instead, I looked to Rin \nfor confirmation and got another bored shrug in response. Rin was too \nbusy trying to decide if she was going to be in the throes of her \ncuriosity to bother with me. Rin was just having fun with Science, and \nJester seemed patient enough to tolerate the prodding.</p><p>\u201cCall\n it luck,\u201d I suggested. \u201cI had the night off. And for better or for \nworse, the Crownsguard hasn\u2019t assumed all tieflings know each other.\u201d </p><p>Molly\n flipped me off with his free hand, not even bothering to put his drink \ndown. Entirely in line with circus communication as I\u2019d seen it.</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t know you until today.\u201d Jester tilted her head to one side, like a dog hearing a new sound. </p><p>Speaking of, was that shouting coming from outside? And growling. </p><p>Um.</p><p>\u201cBe right back!\u201d </p>",

Yes, that was a pun, but wordplay didn\u2019t make my point less valid. </p><p>According\n to some myths, being turned into a werewolf was a matter of taking a \ncontract with an evil spirit. Or getting cursed by a god for fucking up \nthe laws of hospitality so badly that, while Tantalus was probably still\n the exemplar, punishment was necessary. Maybe the moon was, or wasn\u2019t, \ninvolved. Getting nibbled on by Canis lupus lupus\n came about later, because for whatever reason rabies transmission and \nwerewolves didn\u2019t get together until pulp fiction. Some werewolves got \ntheir curse from picking flowers from graveyards. Not all were-whatever \ncreatures were wolves, were evil, or even changed shape at all. Hell, \nmaybe the stories were just coverups for serial killers in the age of \nwitch trials.</p><p>The trouble started once the moon rose.</p><p>I\u2019d\n never especially paid attention to lunar cycles beyond what was \nnecessary. Plenty of Konoha traditions ran on a Western calendar pulled \nout of a different universe, and so bright moons existed for Tsukimi \nfestivals and ruining stealth missions the world over. After the fact, I\n recalled that the moon had been there, but that was it. </p><p><b>To the point, mind.</b></p><p>At\n the time things went weird, Rin and I were out and about. The autumn \nevening was nippy, not truly cold. Between my circus-given coat and \nRin\u2019s sudden acquisition of a winter Konoha cloak, we were all right. \nThe town was quieter at night, with the closest thing to a true \nnightlife taking up the fairgrounds and the circus\u2019s attention. With any\n luck, we\u2019d have a nice, quiet night and raid the closest thing this \ntown had to a library. Even without electric lighting, there had to be \nsomething we could find.</p><p><i>\u201cWhile we\u2019re away from the circus, I have a question I don\u2019t think was answered,\u201d</i>\n said Rin, as we headed to the lakeshore. The moon\u2019s reflection was \nbright silver in the water, which almost made up for the smell of fish \nand muck. </p><p>Both of us sat down on an empty dock. I could see quite a ways, and Rin cocked her head to one side as she thought.</p><p><i>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d</i> I said, turning my flat yellow eyes to her. </p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019ve had a while to come up with a hypothesis,\u201d </i>Rin began, pressing her fingertips together as she thought. <i>\u201cNow that I\u2019ve met Yasha, and Molly, and also your new form, I think I have enough data. Do you think everyone has been modified somehow?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWe\u2019re kind of a small sample size,\u201d</i> I muttered, but that was as solid as my objections went. <i>\u201cYour changes are cosmetic, right?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t think they are. I mean, yes, my eyes and my hair are different, but there are so many other things.\u201d</i> She held a hand out in front of her and pointed at the moon, frowning. <i>\u201cIt\n may just be a trick my brain is playing on me, but I\u2019m sure my night \nvision wasn\u2019t this good before we got here. I can see fifteen meters \nfarther than I should be able to right now, even with full moonlight. \nDid something similar happen to you?\u201d</i></p><p>I nodded. <i>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026not dark where it should be.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cExactly! And then when I met Molly, I felt my skin crawling even though he hadn\u2019t done anything. It was a totally irrational feeling.\u201d</i>\n Rin threw her hands up in frustration. Her multicolored eyes seemed to \nflash in the dark, catching the moonlight strangely in my modified \nvision. <i>\u201cThere was some little itchy part of me that was just as upset with Yasha for something. It was completely at odds with my first impressions of almost everyone I\u2019ve ever met, including Orochimaru.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI haven\u2019t felt anything like that,\u201d</i> I said. If I tried, I could probably find something deep\n in the factoid-centric part of my brain to explain it, but I didn\u2019t \nknow for sure. But if Yasha and Molly gave off the same feeling, maybe \nthey both weren\u2019t human? <i>\u201cBut I\u2019ve kind of been distracted by\u2026y\u2019know.\u201d</i> I tried to wave my tail to catch Rin\u2019s attention and accidentally smacked her in the leg instead.</p><p><i>\u201cI do know!\u201d </i>Rin said good-naturedly, waving off my attempted apology. <i>\u201cAnd\n I also discovered I can heal without using chakra. I don\u2019t understand \nit, but there\u2019s plenty in this world I don\u2019t understand.\u201d </i>She nodded firmly and clenched her fists as though her determination alone would wrestle truth from the air. <i>\u201cI will, though. Every magic is just insufficiently understood until testing begins!\u201d</i></p><p><b>I missed her.</b> Isobu stretched out with all of his tails and both forelegs, draping himself over Rin\u2019s lap.<i> \u201c<b>Your excessive scientific enthusiasm is a relief, you know.</b>\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAw, you\u2019re making me blush.\u201d </i>Rin pressed her hands to her cheeks theatrically, then settled into tweaking the tips of Isobu\u2019s tails. <i>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019ve been here for Kei. It\u2019s awful to be alone.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou were.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd that\u2019s how I know it\u2019s awful.\u201d</i></p><p>All\n three of us sighed at the same time. Even the turtle. We were a long \nway from home with no way to go back immediately. It sucked no matter \nhow many times it happened. </p><p>Which\n was about when I felt a faint ping at the far end of my chakra sensing \nrange. Instantly, my head jerked in the relevant direction and every \nmuscle on me tensed up, which Rin couldn\u2019t miss on her worst day. </p><p><i>\u201cI think we just found a friend,\u201d</i> I heard myself say.</p><p><i>\u201cWho is it?\u201d</i>\n Rin asked, following me eagerly as we got to our feet and started \nstriding toward the edge of town. It felt like the right direction. </p><p>Except for the lake. </p><p>The\n lightning I was following wasn\u2019t a part of a storm, a spell, or \nanything else conveniently explainable by this world\u2019s phenomena. Not at\n all. I\u2019d know that walking live wire anywhere, and I started to pick up\n the pace toward the signature even as it took me toward the water. </p><p><i>\u201cOh, I know who this is!\u201d </i>Rin chirped, and darted after me as we hurried across the waves. Isobu was still clamped tight in her arms. </p><p>What kind of shinobi would we be if we let a little water stop us from checking in? </p><p>The\n Ustaloch was a kidney bean-shaped body of water that seemed to be a \nfocal point of local superstition. Rin had encountered giant water \nsnakes here during her week\u2019s stay, which seemed to be native. After \ntying them in a knot, there wasn\u2019t much else to prove to the \nout-of-place fauna. Rin knew it, I knew it, and anything that survived a\n Rin-rampage was probably going to live long enough to learn it. </p><p>Thus, we didn\u2019t run into any threats for a while. </p><p>The\n lakeshore butted up against forest, but not true woods as we\u2019d come to \nunderstand in Konoha. There, the trees were wider around than any human \narm-span at a dead minimum. Here, I got the impression that the logging \nindustry was less of an organized affair and more just because people \naround here didn\u2019t have any other way to heat their houses in the \nwinter. Coming to a world without basic amenities felt like such a step \nback it wasn\u2019t on the same continent.</p><p>And we weren\u2019t.</p><p>My feet hit sand again a little before Rin\u2019s did, and we clambered up onto the shore and into tree cover. </p><p><i>\u201cWait\u2026 Is that\u2026?\u201d</i> Rin murmured behind me, just as the source of Kakashi\u2019s chakra signature padded into view.</p><p>My first thought was, <i>Holy fuck he\u2019s a werewolf.</i></p><p>My second was, <i>Oh fucking hell he\u2019s big.</i></p><p>Hanging\n around summoned animals a lot had a way of messing with one\u2019s sense of \nscale, but I was still sure the white wolf in front of me had to be well\n over three times as big as a normal one. At least. The heavy snow-white\n coat was interrupted only by a black muzzle split by two rows of \nwhite-and-red teeth and a dark spot over his left eye, like someone \ncopy-pasted the coat of a sweet mutt over a dire wolf\u2019s frame. All of \nhis teeth were bared and his breath formed thick fog in the moonlit cold\n air. </p><p>That rumble definitely wasn\u2019t thunder. Instead, it sounded like a growl.</p><p><b>You know, I think I could keep him from biting anyone.</b></p><p>Well, I thought as I felt Rin grip my arm, shit.</p><p>Rin\n and I started moving parallel to the massive wolf, along the lakeshore \nand through cattails. Neither of us took our eyes off him.</p><p>Sure,\n Kakashi\u2019s long strides mirrored my movements exactly like a large \npredator would, but hell. I was at least as vicious as a wolf of any \nsize. And he didn\u2019t seem to want to head into the water. Instead, those \nmismatched eyes stayed on us, glittering in the dark. If I had to guess,\n neither Rin nor I came up to his shoulder. Rin in particular. </p><p><b>He can bite me.</b></p><p>There were, apparently, some concrete benefits to having an invulnerable companion. Same principle as a crocodile,\n I theorized. My thoughts weren\u2019t too frantic, though seeing a Sharingan\n in a wolf\u2019s face was fairly unsettling. There wasn\u2019t any recognition in\n that gaze that I could detect. Wolves have more muscles to close their jaws than they do to open them. Or at least the muscles are stronger.</p><p>I\n felt Rin\u2019s chakra pulse as she activated the first stage of her \nStrength of a Hundred seal, just in case. Well, there went the threat \nlevel of this little encounter. On his best day, Kakashi couldn\u2019t hope \nto beat Rin at arm wrestling. On Rin\u2019s best day, <i>Gamabunta </i>would lose.</p><p><i>\u201cLet me know if you want me to keep him busy,\u201d</i> Rin said softly. </p><p>Out of the corner of my mouth, I said, <i>\u201cMaybe once I have a plan. Isobu\u2019s talking.\u201d</i></p><p><b>Speaking\n of, I meant \u201che can bite me\u201d more in the manner of a dog trying to pick\n up a ball too big for its mouth. You know the look.</b></p><p>\u2026Isobu.</p><p><b>If it works, I doubt either of </b><b>us</b><b> will care how silly it looks. And Rin would hardly mention it. </b></p><p>Isobu, please don\u2019t break his teeth. We have no idea how any of this shit works.</p><p><b>Having not seen a competent dentist\u2026 Fine.</b></p><p>I\n picked Isobu up by his shell. In my hands, he curled into a spiked \nmedicine ball of doom. Tossing him up and down a few times to get a \nsense of his weight, I nodded to Rin. Then I held him one-handed and \neyed Kakashi\u2019s growling form. </p><p><i>\u201cChew on this,\u201d</i> I suggested cheerfully, and pitched Isobu right at his face.</p><p>Once\n upon a time, a version of me with her nose constantly in a book read an\n awful lot about strange beasts and magical principles. I\u2019d never lived \nthose rules, of course, because there was one such system in my life and\n it was already bullshit enough for two. But in those books had been \nstories of how all sorts of animal minds worked.</p><p>Per\n the works of one Sir Terry Pratchett, werewolves kept one foot in the \nhuman world and a paw in the world of wolves. Made them a bit of both. \nAnd what did you call a wolf with human influence spanning back \ngenerations uncounted?</p><p>Maybe, just a bit, there was a bit of dog in there.</p><p>I probably should have predicted what happened next.</p><p>Kakashi\n whipped his huge head around and snatched Isobu neatly out of the air. \nHe fumbled for a split second, teeth or tongue catching Isobu\u2019s spikes \nthe wrong way, but stubbornly refused to let the little monster drop. \nThe head jerk motion was nearly the same as a natural wolf\u2019s, but it\u2019d \nbeen designed for prey the equivalent size of a mouse. Isobu was a \nlittle too round and tough.</p><p>Isobu\n hadn\u2019t discussed his next move with me, but in theory he was capable of\n keeping Kakashi\u2019s entire head restrained with just his tails. He \nstarted to uncoil, gripping fur with his little hands.</p><p>And then Kakashi shook his head exactly\n like the signature back-breaking swing I\u2019d only observed in terriers \nbefore. Also in Pakkun, but Pakkun hunted about as often as pigs flew. \nIsobu made a noise like a pissed-off cat and two of his tails looped \naround Kakashi\u2019s lower jaw, but that didn\u2019t seem to stop him. He just \nadjusted his grip on Isobu and half-closed his eyes, shaking my combat \nbuddy so hard I heard Isobu swear inside my head from frustration.</p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s not hurting him, is it?\u201d</i> Rin asked worriedly.</p><p>Isobu\u2019s cursing was definitely the angry kind.</p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014Kakashi, is that fun?\u201d</i> I asked before I could stop myself. </p><p>At\n the sound of my voice, his mismatched eyes locked on me again. I wasn\u2019t\n sure he recognized my voice, because both of our bodies were kinda \nfucked up and our faces were\u2026intact. Hell if I knew what we smelled \nlike.</p><p>Rin at least looked like herself, even if she was glowing a bit from her jutsu. </p><p>Then\n he dropped his chest and forelegs to the bank, his straight tail up and\n wagging. His non-Sharingan eye angled up, toward us, and one of his \nears almost flopped as he let out a noise not unlike a growl. But \nhigher.</p><p><i>\u201cOh no.\u201d</i> I fought valiantly to keep my hand from hitting my face. I had horns now. It\u2019d probably hurt.<i> \u201cNo.\u201d</i></p><p>Rin started to snicker.</p><p><b>I take back what I said about my brilliant plan.</b></p><p>You made that bed, and now you get to lie in it, I told him, but I stepped toward the bank anyway.</p><p>Kakashi skittered back at least a meter.</p><p>I stepped forward twice. </p><p>Kakashi retreated two meters.</p><p>Aw, dammit. I facepalmed anyway, and damn the consequences. <i>\u201cHey, Kakashi. Drop him, please.\u201d</i></p><p>Kakashi\u2019s response was something like <i>\u201cAwuf.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cKakashi.\u201d </i>I crouched just a bit, my tail lashing.<i> \u201cCome on, drop the turtle.\u201d</i></p><p>Though her hands covered her mouth, Rin managed to say, <i>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s listening.\u201d</i></p><p>He did not drop the turtle. In fact, he turned tail and booked it when I darted for Isobu\u2019s loose tail. The only saving grace was that the island wasn\u2019t that big. He couldn\u2019t run forever.</p><p><i>\u201cI DON\u2019T CARE IF YOU\u2019RE A HUNDRED KILOS BIGGER, GET BACK HERE!\u201d</i></p><p>Rin was too doubled over with laughter to help. </p><p>Like I said. Probably should have seen that coming.</p><p>It\n took five hours for Kakashi to finally keel over for a nap. Still giant\n and wolfy and with Isobu trapped between his dinner plate paws, but at \nleast he stopped running. The night\u2019s festivities were like playing keep\n away if the ball kept shrieking out of injured pride, chasing away \nnesting birds and generally making a racket. Had I actually been able to\n sleep, it probably would have pissed me off something fierce. \nOtherwise, the screaming mostly marked Kakashi\u2019s location and helped me \nkeep a bead on them while the chase was on.</p><p>As\n a direct result of these shenanigans, I was dead on my feet by morning.\n Plenty of chakra left, but not perhaps the best control. Also, crabbier\n than Isobu. In my experience, no amount of foreign caffeine made up for\n just never getting to sleep, even if I knew where to get any. </p><p>Rin patted my head when I mentioned this problem. <i>\u201cI\u2019m sure Kakashi had fun.\u201d</i></p><p>At\n least I could lean against Kakashi\u2019s white flank to rest once he \nsettled. Rin was sitting on his other side, humming as she did a medical\n scan. All the data was coming up Dog. I supposed he could\n be a dire wolf, albeit one with strange markings. I had a vague notion \nthat real dire wolves were supposed to have spikes like Isobu, though. \nAnd be a lot more aggressive than Kakashi was, once the ice was broken. </p><p>While\n dawn\u2019s first light touched the treetops and the sky turned orange and \nclouds became pink, Kakashi raised his huge head with his tongue lolling\n out of his mouth. He nosed at the world\u2019s most dangerous tennis ball, \nand Isobu roused. </p><p>Isobu,\n still trapped between his paws, grumbled like an annoyed alligator and \npoked his head out of the mountain of fur. He tolerated the prodding \nwith bad grace, then said, <i><b>\u201cI cannot help but notice that he is still huge and fluffy.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s\n been bothering me, too. I mean, he\u2019s a perfectly healthy giant animal \nat the moment, but he has Kakashi\u2019s chakra signature.\u201d</i> When I leaned my head back to look askance at her, Rin could only shrug. <i>\u201cReally. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on! This is magic, and that\u2019s both intriguing and incredibly frustrating.\u201d</i> She patted Kakashi\u2019s fur. <i>\u201cWe\u2019ll get you back to normal somehow, all right?\u201d</i></p><p>Kakashi made a \u201cwhuf\u201d noise and twisted until his snout could nearly rest in my lap. Then he sighed, as though content. </p><p>Unfortunately,\n I couldn\u2019t wait forever. I lifted his head off me about five minutes \nlater, letting him make sad puppy eyes at me as I got to my feet. Next \non my to-do list was tearing into my emergency supplies.</p><p>Yes, I still had them in a storage seal in my foot. It was harder to replace than conventionally stored bags. </p><p>At\n some point during life as a member of any shinobi corps, people learned\n to pack efficiently whether they wanted to or not. Setting aside the \nperennial issue of folding versus rolling and how putting storage \nscrolls inside of each other tended to result in explosions, I retrieved\n three full sets of clothes that didn\u2019t compensate for the tail I \nsported now. Fortunately, one of them turned out to be Izo\u2019s \nWhitebeard-emblazoned T-shirt and the bright red jacket (designed for \npeople who were over two meters tall). Uniform pants were a little \nharder to be sure of, but I had a pair cut for Obito since he was still in the \u201cthrow it all in\u201d school of keeping shit organized and needed a bit of help. Instead, I got to be pack mule.</p><p>By\n the time the sun rose, I expected Kakashi to turn back into a person. \nAt least then I could yell at him properly for scaring me.</p><p>Instead,\n he shook his head with so much force that he sent a ripple through his \nentire body, his ears pricking to attention. Rin\u2019s grip in his fur was \nthankfully strong enough to keep her from being tossed to the ground, \nbut it was a close thing. He rolled to his feet all at once, with Rin \nstill on his back, and looked around frantically until his mismatched \neyes landed on me.</p><p><i>\u201c\u2026You all right?\u201d</i> I asked, even as I raised my hand.</p><p>He\n pushed his nose into my hand. It was wet and his breath was hot, coming\n in quick pants. His normal eye was dark with the whites showing around \nthe edges, and his Sharingan spun slowly as fear set in.</p><p>I\n grabbed onto his fur with both hands. He lowered his head until I could\n press my forehead to his, planting a kiss in the middle of his fur. \nWhile the whine in his throat echoed up through me, too, I stroked the \nsides of his head and tried to soothe the fear. I could feel the panic \ntrying to control him and the growl starting to build, but I hung on \nanyway. I wasn\u2019t any better, now that I knew for sure he was really in there and not just his chakra. </p><p><i>\u201cShh, shh,\u201d</i> I\n murmured. Above my head, I felt Rin\u2019s hand briefly brush mine as she, \ntoo, tried her best to let Kakashi know we were both here for him.<i> \u201cI\u2019ve got you now, all right? Everything\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</i></p><p>Rin slid down his back until she could touch ground again. <i>\u201cYou look totally different, but you only just realized it now, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</i></p><p>Kakashi made a mournful noise, his ears flat against his skull. </p><p>It\n took us a while to convince him, but eventually Kakashi laid miserably \non the ground next to me. With my backpack wide open so Rin could use \nit, we all curled up together on that bleak little shore as Rin scanned \nhis chakra again. </p><p>Kakashi\n leaned into my side and my arm clung to his thick fur ruff. Though I \ncouldn\u2019t claim to be a mind reader, I was pretty good at moods if people\n around me had chakra to read. Kakashi did believe us, to a point, but \nthe rest of his signature rattled with undirected, unfamiliar fear. </p><p>Rin\n started slowly going through her medical checks. Her chakra was clamped\n down hard as her training took over, hands glowing faintly green in my \nmind\u2019s eye. Even from my comparatively amateur understanding of animal \ntransformations, Kakashi\u2019s stamina was shot to hell and his confidence \nhad taken a beating, so it was no wonder why Rin was so serious. At \nleast no one had hurt him before found him. That was something. </p><p>It had to be.</p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m here. We\u2019ll get through this.\u201d</i></p><p>Kakashi whined with his muzzle in his paws. In that tone, I heard, What happened?</p><p>While\n Rin scanned Kakashi for abnormalities, I explained what I knew about \nwerewolves\u2014infections and moon cycles, mostly\u2014and the knot of worry in \nmy stomach kept tightening alongside Kakashi\u2019s lightning chakra. It \ndidn\u2019t mean anything to him. It was all empty words. </p><p>I didn\u2019t know what the fuck I was talking about in this world, and that scared all of us.</p><p><i>\u201cDo you remember how you ended up this way?\u201d</i> I asked him, barely keeping my voice steady.</p><p>Kakashi shook his huge head just enough to get his point across, terrified of dislodging me. </p><p>Getting\n occasionally knocked unconscious or fainting were facts of life as \nshinobi. Kakashi, with the drain from the Sharingan, viewed the latter \nas an old and irritating friend. But losing control? Losing his body? Never. In his entire life, Kakashi lost a grand total of maybe an hour to altered states of consciousness from genjutsu tricks or getting drunk. His discipline allowed no more. </p><p>Losing control wasn\u2019t something he did. This was a whole new frontier of impossible to deal with.</p><p>He\n did his best to keep his eyes both locked on Rin as she took his pulse \nand listened to his breathing, trying to figure out where it had all \ngone wrong. She wasn\u2019t a vet. She\u2019d practiced on humans. We were so \nscrewed.</p><p><i>\u201cAs far as I can tell, you\u2019re perfectly healthy,\u201d</i> Rin said finally, running her fingers over one of his dinner plate-sized paws. <i>\u201cJust\n a giant wolf. This has to be another magic thing. It might also explain\n why it took you until now to remember you\u2019re supposed to be human. You \nreally didn\u2019t remember anything?\u201d</i></p><p>Lowering\n his head onto his paws again, he sighed deeply. Perhaps in direct \nresponse, Isobu started carding his much smaller hands through Kakashi\u2019s\n fur. Maybe he just wanted to see what it felt like. It wasn\u2019t like real\n animals often let him close. </p><p><i><b>\u201cFrom one perspective,\u201d</b></i> Isobu said thoughtfully, <b><i>\u201cit is very like being an inexperienced jinch\u016briki.\u201d</i></b> Bobbing in the lake, Isobu wiggled all of his tails as Kakashi jerked his head toward him.<b><i> \u201cI\n think Kei remembers her early experiences well because she did not \nreach V2 before learning some self-control. But I recall instances where\n other jinch\u016briki have not been so lucky.\u201d</i></b></p><p>Utakata\n came to mind immediately, though he\u2019d hit his berserker threshold early\n due to severe injury. All of his usual surgical precision careened out \nthe window. Then Blue B and the time Gy\u016bki\u2019s seal split wide open. And \nthen there was our very own Naruto\u2026</p><p><i>\u201cThough there is one big exception,\u201d</i>\n I said, when Kakashi made a little acknowledging noise. His feelings on\n the matter were still fairly negative, but he\u2019d dealt with worse. <i>\u201cI don\u2019t think you can exactly \u2018befriend\u2019 the wolf mind. At least, not like Isobu.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>\u201cI, for example, am a person. Your affliction seems to have superimposed the mind of a dog on top of yours. Temporarily.\u201d</b></i> Isobu eyed Kakashi carefully as he thought about what to say next. He tucked his little hands under his belly. <i>\u201c<b>Without a proper tongue, can you use that eye of yours to speak to us?</b>\u201d</i></p><p>I glanced down at the top of Kakashi\u2019s head. <i>\u201cThat might work?\u201d <br></i></p><p><i></i>I was mostly surprised that suggestion came from Isobu,\n because he\u2019d never been fond of Kakashi\u2019s use of the Sharingan. \nTolerated? Sure. Occasionally been grateful for in desperate \ncircumstances? Fine. But he generally didn\u2019t volunteer to have anything \nto do with the Sharingan if at all possible. </p><p><i>\u201cIf that would work, I think you\u2019re in the right place to try it.\u201d </i>Rin\u2019s eyes were a little glazed over as she went over the data her scan gave her, but she was clearly listening. </p><p>Kakashi\n made a curious noise in the back of his throat, ears twitching. He \nnosed at Isobu again, then met the little beastie\u2019s eye with his \nSharingan. As though now was the perfect time to test it. I kept my \nhands in his fur for the length of the staring contest, feeling my \nnerves tremble in anticipation of whatever other curveballs this place \ncould throw our way. We didn\u2019t need any more.</p><p>A second later, Isobu said as though in response to a question, <b>\u201c</b><b>No. There was a threat display</b><b>\u201d</b>\u2014which had been terrifying in the moment because I hadn\u2019t known what to do\u2014<b>\u201cbut once you had me in your teeth, it was all a game. You did not hurt anyone.</b><b>\u201d</b></p><p>I sagged in relief. Thank fuck it worked. </p><p>\u201cAnd then we had a nice nap. Or you did,\u201d Rin added, as Kakashi deflated slightly from sheer relief. His tail thumped the ground once while she spoke, \u201cWith Isobu tucked between your huge paws, after playing Keep Away with him.\u201d</p><p>Kakashi\n managed a mortified expression, even as near-unrecognizable as he was. \nHis chakra burned with shame. He whined uncomfortably.</p><p><i>\u201cYou absolutely did.\u201d</i> Rin smiled for the first time since Kakashi had realized the situation. She scratched his ears. <i>\u201cIt was worse than when Pakkun tried teaching a stray dog how Fetch worked.\u201d</i></p><p>Kakashi\n twisted his head over so he could rub at his Sharingan against his \nforeleg. Then he sighed up at both of us. Those eyes seemed to ask, <i>What now?</i></p><p>I\n had no idea. All I could think of was going back to the circus and \ntelling them I\u2019d have to leave for the foreseeable future, because my \nfianc\u00e9 had been magically transformed into an animal and everything was \nterrible. I couldn\u2019t stick around. Rin and I needed to find a way to fix\n this. </p><p>Kakashi sighed deeply. </p><p><i><b>\u201cBody modifications seem to be all the rage, now,\u201d</b></i>\n Isobu griped while we all tried to absorb what kind of situation we\u2019d \nbeen dropped into. He curled his tails around Rin\u2019s wrist and mine, then\n sat squarely on Kakashi\u2019s right front paw. <i><b>\u201cWe cannot \njust sit idle and hope for a solution to fall onto our heads. You are a \ndog, I am small, Kei has a limb she cannot use, and Rin has also been \nchanged on some spiritual level. These things are unfortunate, but we \nare alive. We are capable. And we will find a way to get our bodies \nback.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Kakashi snorted, but he accepted the ear rubs when Rin offered. </p><p>For\n normal people, the phrase \u201chiked the lake back to town\u201d probably needed\n to be modified by the word \u201caround.\u201d Not so for us. Even \nKakashi-turned-Suicune. Or whatever he was. </p><p>At least<i> something</i> went right today.</p><p>This feeling did not last once the morning mist burned off, because it never did. Town was different overnight.</p><p>Trekking\n back to the circus, only to find that everyone was under house arrest \nand the place was on lockdown thanks to the Crownsguard, was a bit of a \nshock. Learning about a minor zombie outbreak followed in that vein, \nbecause of course it did. Since I couldn\u2019t waltz into camp without a \ndisguise and daylight guards were almost always more alert than \ngraveyard-shifters, the three of us moved on to poking the periphery.</p><p>\u201cSorry\n if this is\u2026rude, but, uh.\u201d Without the brightly colored costumes the \ncircus folks wore, I at least couldn\u2019t be instantly picked out as one of\n the crew. It was pragmatic, but not particularly nice for the ones \nwho\u2019d been arrested. \u201cIf I could just get past\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove\n along already, you nosy devil.\u201d The Crownsguard spat to the side even \nas all of us watched him. \u201cEveryone here is under suspicion of murder.\u201d </p><p>Kakashi, with his fur held tight by Rin\u2019s hands, didn\u2019t quite manage to avoid growling as the guard got in my face. </p><p>\u201cKeep your damn dog on a leash,\u201d was the guard\u2019s suggestion before he really got sick of us. </p><p>In\n some worlds, dogs wore collars. Or service vests. Or both. To get \nKakashi\u2019s way-too-damn-big wolf form into town, Rin and I puzzled over \nthe problem until we remembered the vests and headbands Kakashi made for\n all of his dogs back when he had proper thumbs instead of dewclaws. So,\n after digging through our emergency supplies and scrubbing what seemed \nto be deer blood from around Kakashi\u2019s dark muzzle, we\u2019d collaborated.</p><p>The\n Whitebeard jacket was tied around his thick neck like a cheery little \nscarf, the sleeves arranged into a bow. Somehow combining that with a \nleash made of rope\u2014attached to the jacket, not his neck\u2014made him a \u201cdog\u201d\n in human brains. </p><p>A very, <i>very</i> big dog that smelled like the forest. </p><p>Isobu might\u2019ve messed with the guards\u2019 heads a bit to make it work, but it worked no matter how much we cheated. Therefore, it was victory through technicality. </p><p>Kakashi\n was very patient through the entire process and even let a different \nguard shake his paw, which was more than I would have offered at the \ntime. Then again, I probably would have been turned into a turtle if I \nwasn\u2019t already a demon-blooded person. Apparently. </p><p>In the end, we ditched the crime scene and went looking around for help.</p><p><i><b>\u201cIt could have been more humiliating if we tried, yes,\u201d</b></i> Isobu said to Kakashi\u2019s apparently Sharingan-transferred question. <i><b>\u201cI have already pretended to be a ventriloquist dummy. Most people do not realize I am a person, either.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Kakashi sighed, and both Rin and I patted his hulking shoulders. </p><p>And,\n because Kakashi\u2019s nose was more useful than my inherent radar in a \nworld where only the four of us had chakra, we managed to track down the\n only member of the circus who wasn\u2019t trapped either in the stockade or \nthe campground. It took a few minutes, and we scared more than a few \npeople while trotting through town in our search, but we did it. I could\n tell that the second Kakashi turned up his nose and refused to even \nthink of walking into a building, because he was too busy sneezing. </p><p>It\n turned out that only so many people smelled like a combination of \npatchouli, road dust, and stale alcohol, even in a town with a \ndecent-sized population. Really, the patchouli was the defining factor \nwhen it came to Mollymauk Tealeaf. And not tea. </p><p>I\u2019d\n noticed strange things in the performers\u2019 boxes while helping out at \nthe circus, but I couldn\u2019t track a drop of perfume across a country. \nKakashi could. Even if he still hated the smell. </p><p>There was a comparison to be made to Prince Humperdinck, but that was a different story.</p><p>Anyway, we found the world\u2019s most colorful fortune teller in an inn off the side of the street. </p><p>Kakashi\n and Isobu stayed outside, with Isobu sitting on the end of his lead as \nthough he was responsible in the slightest. Kakashi, for his part, \nsettled on the ground with his muzzle on his paws and made a miserable \nnoise. The smell of alcohol didn\u2019t agree with him, but bacon probably \ndid. There was a hindbrain-level instinct for meat rattling around in \nthere. </p><p>I needed to find some way to feed him, and it couldn\u2019t involve setting him loose on wildlife. Unless he wanted to do that. </p><p>Molly\n wasn\u2019t terribly colorful when I walked in, or at least hadn\u2019t been for a\n bit. Instead, Molly sat at a table and carefully wiped off enough \nmakeup to disguise a clown. His solid red gaze darted to me and then Rin\n when he noticed us entering the Nestled Nook Inn, and he waved with his\n free hand. \u201cGood to see you, Carey. Rin, too. Rough night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Okay, where did I start? \u201cI guess. I think yours might\u2019ve been worse.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh,\n I don\u2019t know.\u201d Molly eyed me as the last of the peach-colored makeup \nwas wiped away. \u201cWhat\u2019s an unjust arrest and unfriendly small town, in \nthe grand scheme of things? Sure, the Crownsguard are probably going to \nkill us all if they can\u2019t find whoever turned the old man into a \nmonster, but\u2026\u201d Molly paused. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s really a \nbright side to that. How about you?\u201d </p><p>I glanced at Rin, who shrugged. Ought I tell Molly about Kakashi\u2019s rather fuzzy problem? Or Rin\u2019s super strength?</p><p>\u201cDid\n your friend just keep you up all night?\u201d Molly flashed a sharp-toothed \ngrin, but his heart wasn\u2019t in it. While the grin didn\u2019t waver, my \nstone-faced response didn\u2019t seem to be encouraging. \u201cTrouble in \nparadise?\u201d he tried again.</p><p><b>Was that supposed to be an innuendo?</b></p><p><i>Yeah, nope. Not telling him shit.</i> I\n ignored the comment and sat down at the table, followed almost \nimmediately by Rin and then Isobu as he rolled into the bar area, the \nlatter of whom couldn\u2019t see over the edge of the table. </p><p>He did send me an awful image of the underside of said table, just to be an ass. Or to repay my comment, perhaps. </p><p>I shook the picture from my mind\u2019s eye and asked Molly, \u201cWhat exactly happened last night?\u201d </p><p>Molly\n did lay his cards out on the table, once I proved unwilling to play \nalong with any teasing. He explained, likely not for the first time, \nthat the show had gone on exactly as it always had for the majority of \nthe time last night. Right up until an old man turned into an undead \nmonster and killed someone else, who then also\n turned into an undead monster. Running with the theory that the circus \nwasn\u2019t in the business of murdering customers, Molly and his new \nco-conspirators\u2014coincidentally the same motley crew he\u2019d charmed into \nattending just yesterday morning\u2014had spent most of today investigating \nthe old man\u2019s usual haunts.</p><p>\u201cAnd we found basically nothing,\u201d said a new voice. </p><p>I\n leaned back a bit and spotted a woman in blue robes stomping down the \nstairs. Now that I had better light and more inclination to give a shit,\n the blue fabric of her outfit reminded me quite a lot\n of some of the more coastal towns in the Land of Fire and perhaps even \nwhat I\u2019d seen in the Fire Temple I\u2019d visited once. Though the specific \npattern was unfamiliar, there were some similarities to the cloth used \nin the Land of Water as well. Her features were more like mine than, \nsay, any human I\u2019d met so far. </p><p>Actually, she kind of looked like Sokka.</p><p><b>I do not see how that helps us.</b></p><p>That\n woman was followed almost immediately by a blue tiefling with dark, \nbackward-curling, silver-capped horns more like Molly\u2019s than mine. She \nwas probably a hand\u2019s span shorter than I was, wearing a dark blue slit \nskirt peppered with peach and pink tones. Her sleeves almost reached the\n floor, but in a Western style instead of a furisode, and she wore both a\n half-length green cape and a sickle in a sheath on her belt. </p><p>And\n then there was the half-orc behind her, dressed head to toe in dark \nleather armor. The two-tone green on him looked a little odd when I \nthought back to the only other half-orc I knew, but I was literally \ndull, dark pink all over and two of the other people at the table were \nblue and lavender. At this point, the time for pointing fingers was \npast. A scar bisected his eyebrow and formed an X further up his face, \nand his hair was dark, half-shaved, and sported a sharp gray streak. If I\n had to guess, he might\u2019ve been older than I was, and he was definitely \naround Kakashi\u2019s height. </p><p>Well, before he got turned into a giant wolf.</p><p>I\n cleared my throat as our table got a bit more crowded, thanks to the \nwoman in blue, the blue tiefling, and the half-orc from the last inn \nincursion. I cleared my throat. \u201cOkay. Well, then, it\u2019s about time for \nintroductions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems\n like we\u2019re all in the same boat,\u201d agreed the half-orc as he dragged a \nchair over to the table. \u201cI figure Molly might\u2019ve introduced us, but \nagain from the top, just so we\u2019re all clear. The name\u2019s Fjord, with a \nJ.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\n am Jester!\u201d Jester beamed as she followed suit, sliding into place next\n to Fjord. \u201cI didn\u2019t get any of your names before, but it is very nice \nto meet you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeau,\n short for Beauregard,\u201d was the monk\u2019s terse response. Though I \ncertainly couldn\u2019t make judgement calls on what parents named their \nkids, Beau still added, \u201cMy parents wanted a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\n see,\u201d I said, while Isobu clambered up onto the edge of the table and \nfolded his forelegs like some kind of mob boss. He didn\u2019t quite have the\n shoulder rotation range, however. \u201cBy the way, Molly, I wanted to \napologize for something else.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, we can get that out of the way first.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\n lied when I told all of you my name, before.\u201d I picked Gustav\u2019s fake \nidentification paperwork out of a pocket and set it flat on the table. \nBeauregard just picked it up to stare at it, scrutinizing me. \u201cIf you \nall like, you can call me Keisuke. Or Kei. These two do.\u201d </p><p>Isobu nodded firmly. \u201c<b>The\n fake name was useful for deflecting attention, but there does not seem \nto be much point. There is no one here to recognize us. Thus, you may \ncall me Isobu.</b>\u201d His eye narrowed to a glowing red slit that made him look like a monster from the depths, if the depths were floor height. \u201c<b>And if any of you call me </b><i><b>anything</b></i><b> but my name, I will douse you in ice water until you learn better.</b>\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cOh, I wish I spoke this language,\u201d </i>Rin said after a second, waiting for an Isobu translation that didn\u2019t seem to be forthcoming. <i>\u201cI miss so many more jokes this way. Even more than normal.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cOkay,\n okay, O Kei.\u201d And so it began. Molly\u2019s tail lashed as he sat back, \nthough the grin quickly slipped off his face. What had happened to the \ncircus must\u2019ve really rattled him. I wasn\u2019t nearly as close to anyone \nthere as Molly was, but spontaneous zombies weren\u2019t reassuring either. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t quite get that, Rin, but don\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t think you got \nwhat I said earlier.\u201d</p><p>This time, Isobu did translate, and Rin\u2019s reply amounted to, \u201cThanks for your patience!\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre you doing some kind of ventriloquist thing?\u201d Beau asked Rin.</p><p>After Isobu repeated the question\u2014and finally explained what a ventriloquist was\u2014Rin said,<i> \u201cIsobu speaks two languages. I don\u2019t. I like the idea of having Isobu as our translator.\u201d </i>Rin added, after a moment\u2019s thought,<i> \u201cHe\u2019s really quite clever about it.\u201d</i></p><p>This didn\u2019t seem to work out for Beau, but it wasn\u2019t like she could interrogate her.</p><p><i>\u201cYou say that now.\u201d</i>\n I sighed, then I looked squarely to Beauregard and had a sudden flash \nof Yugito, who was one of the few people I knew who played devil\u2019s \nadvocate because she had a chip on her shoulder the size of Matatabi. \n\u201cNonetheless. If you need any help with this, count us in.\u201d</p><p>Rin nudged me once Isobu had translated.</p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d\n I corrected myself, \u201cmostly. If I skip sleeping any more, I\u2019ll be \nuseless for an investigation.\u201d What with the whole giant wolf problem, I\n could probably help with the investigation as long as Rin kept an eye \non Kakashi. Kakashi could clearly still recognize us while huge and \nfluffy and taken over by dog-instincts, but we didn\u2019t know what the \nexact catalyst for his transformation was and couldn\u2019t predict much \nabout it. </p><p>Molly didn\u2019t even blink as the opportunity for innuendo passed. Maybe he really was distracted. </p><p>\u201cThat\n is good for now. Now we are just waiting for the stinky wizard and the \nlittle one to join us finally.\u201d Jester glanced up at the door. Per \nMolly, they\u2019d branched off to search the town on their own because they \nwere the only ones not slapped with \u201cperson of interest\u201d status. </p><p><i>\u201cRin? Do you know anything?\u201d </i>I asked.</p><p>Rin shook her head even before I finished asking the question.<i> \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know who those people might be.\u201d</i></p><p>And I hadn\u2019t been in town back then. Oh well. To the others, I said, \u201cSo, what do we do for now?\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately,\n we were in a tavern. There was an obvious option. Molly checked his \ncoin purse and clearly thought of ordering everything. He leaned back a \nbit in his seat to get the barkeep\u2019s attention. </p><p>Oh dear.</p><p>\u201cYou know, O Kei, I haven\u2019t seen you drink in all the time I\u2019ve known you. Teetotaler?\u201d Molly asked. </p><p>\u201cI\n found out four years ago I\u2019m literally incapable of getting drunk,\u201d I \nsaid, though the entirely unfair contest with the Whitebeard Pirates had\n been kind of funny. It\u2019d turned into more of a bladder endurance match \nthan anything after about the fifteenth drink. \u201cAnd before that, it \nwasn\u2019t to my taste.\u201d </p><p>Molly\n and Beau were both looking at me like I\u2019d told them I had a terminal \ndisease. I could feel the goblin\u2019s eyes on the side of my head, too. </p><p>\u201cOh, you poor dear,\u201d Molly began.</p><p>Rin laughed as I debated flipping Molly off for being a condescending prick. <i>\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t mean much in a society that has safe drinking water. Maybe it means more here?\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>\u201cAh, but we can make safe water. Therefore, there is no need to drink whatever that terrible stuff is.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Rin and Isobu exchanged a very silly low-five as I sighed. </p><p><i>\u201cNice to see you have my back,\u201d</i> I griped.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d\n said Beau, snapping her fingers to get my attention. I felt Isobu\u2019s \nhackles rise and had to silently shush him, or else he\u2019d have crunched \nthrough the table with all the restraint of, well, him. \u201cWhat\u2019s your \nstory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\n had some bad luck, and the circus helped me out with the papers and so \non,\u201d I said, meeting her gaze without changing my expression at all. I\u2019d\n been eyeballed by tougher customers before, and most of them had been \ntwo seconds leaping over obstacles to murder me. This was nothing. \u201cAnd \nhelped me reunite with Rin, even if they didn\u2019t know I\u2019d find her in \nTrostenwald. So, here we are.\u201d </p><p>Beau\n scowled. \u201cThen what was that about not moving at night? You\u2019re not \nwanted by the Crownsguard. You didn\u2019t get arrested. What\u2019s the story \nthere?\u201d </p><p>I\n thought about making a sexually suggestive quip solely to get Beau to \nstop bothering me, then dismissed the option. Instead, I looked to Rin \nfor confirmation and got another bored shrug in response. Rin was too \nbusy trying to decide if she was going to be in the throes of her \ncuriosity to bother with me. Rin was just having fun with Science, and \nJester seemed patient enough to tolerate the prodding.</p><p>\u201cCall\n it luck,\u201d I suggested. \u201cI had the night off. And for better or for \nworse, the Crownsguard hasn\u2019t assumed all tieflings know each other.\u201d </p><p>Molly\n flipped me off with his free hand, not even bothering to put his drink \ndown. Entirely in line with circus communication as I\u2019d seen it.</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t know you until today.\u201d Jester tilted her head to one side, like a dog hearing a new sound. </p><p>Speaking of, was that shouting coming from outside? And growling. </p><p>Um.</p><p>\u201cBe right back!\u201d </p>",
                "content": "<p>\n<b>Kei: </b>Trip over multiple plot hooks, because some inconsiderate jerk left them lying around everywhere.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of folklore, lycanthropy took a variety of forms. Yes, that was a pun, but wordplay didn&rsquo;t make my point less valid. </p><p>According\n to some myths, being turned into a werewolf was a matter of taking a \ncontract with an evil spirit. Or getting cursed by a god for fucking up \nthe laws of hospitality so badly that, while Tantalus was probably still\n the exemplar, punishment was necessary. Maybe the moon was, or wasn&rsquo;t, \ninvolved. Getting nibbled on by Canis lupus lupus\n came about later, because for whatever reason rabies transmission and \nwerewolves didn&rsquo;t get together until pulp fiction. Some werewolves got \ntheir curse from picking flowers from graveyards. Not all were-whatever \ncreatures were wolves, were evil, or even changed shape at all. Hell, \nmaybe the stories were just coverups for serial killers in the age of \nwitch trials.</p><p>The trouble started once the moon rose.</p><p>I&rsquo;d\n never especially paid attention to lunar cycles beyond what was \nnecessary. Plenty of Konoha traditions ran on a Western calendar pulled \nout of a different universe, and so bright moons existed for Tsukimi \nfestivals and ruining stealth missions the world over. After the fact, I\n recalled that the moon had been there, but that was it. </p><p><b>To the point, mind.</b></p><p>At\n the time things went weird, Rin and I were out and about. The autumn \nevening was nippy, not truly cold. Between my circus-given coat and \nRin&rsquo;s sudden acquisition of a winter Konoha cloak, we were all right. \nThe town was quieter at night, with the closest thing to a true \nnightlife taking up the fairgrounds and the circus&rsquo;s attention. With any\n luck, we&rsquo;d have a nice, quiet night and raid the closest thing this \ntown had to a library. Even without electric lighting, there had to be \nsomething we could find.</p><p><i>&ldquo;While we&rsquo;re away from the circus, I have a question I don&rsquo;t think was answered,&rdquo;</i>\n said Rin, as we headed to the lakeshore. The moon&rsquo;s reflection was \nbright silver in the water, which almost made up for the smell of fish \nand muck. </p><p>Both of us sat down on an empty dock. I could see quite a ways, and Rin cocked her head to one side as she thought.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo;</i> I said, turning my flat yellow eyes to her. </p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a while to come up with a hypothesis,&rdquo; </i>Rin began, pressing her fingertips together as she thought. <i>&ldquo;Now that I&rsquo;ve met Yasha, and Molly, and also your new form, I think I have enough data. Do you think everyone has been modified somehow?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re kind of a small sample size,&rdquo;</i> I muttered, but that was as solid as my objections went. <i>&ldquo;Your changes are cosmetic, right?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they are. I mean, yes, my eyes and my hair are different, but there are so many other things.&rdquo;</i> She held a hand out in front of her and pointed at the moon, frowning. <i>&ldquo;It\n may just be a trick my brain is playing on me, but I&rsquo;m sure my night \nvision wasn&rsquo;t this good before we got here. I can see fifteen meters \nfarther than I should be able to right now, even with full moonlight. \nDid something similar happen to you?&rdquo;</i></p><p>I nodded. <i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&hellip;not dark where it should be.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Exactly! And then when I met Molly, I felt my skin crawling even though he hadn&rsquo;t done anything. It was a totally irrational feeling.&rdquo;</i>\n Rin threw her hands up in frustration. Her multicolored eyes seemed to \nflash in the dark, catching the moonlight strangely in my modified \nvision. <i>&ldquo;There was some little itchy part of me that was just as upset with Yasha for something. It was completely at odds with my first impressions of almost everyone I&rsquo;ve ever met, including Orochimaru.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t felt anything like that,&rdquo;</i> I said. If I tried, I could probably find something deep\n in the factoid-centric part of my brain to explain it, but I didn&rsquo;t \nknow for sure. But if Yasha and Molly gave off the same feeling, maybe \nthey both weren&rsquo;t human? <i>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve kind of been distracted by&hellip;y&rsquo;know.&rdquo;</i> I tried to wave my tail to catch Rin&rsquo;s attention and accidentally smacked her in the leg instead.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I do know!&rdquo; </i>Rin said good-naturedly, waving off my attempted apology. <i>&ldquo;And\n I also discovered I can heal without using chakra. I don&rsquo;t understand \nit, but there&rsquo;s plenty in this world I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo; </i>She nodded firmly and clenched her fists as though her determination alone would wrestle truth from the air. <i>&ldquo;I will, though. Every magic is just insufficiently understood until testing begins!&rdquo;</i></p><p><b>I missed her.</b> Isobu stretched out with all of his tails and both forelegs, draping himself over Rin&rsquo;s lap.<i> &ldquo;<b>Your excessive scientific enthusiasm is a relief, you know.</b>&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Aw, you&rsquo;re making me blush.&rdquo; </i>Rin pressed her hands to her cheeks theatrically, then settled into tweaking the tips of Isobu&rsquo;s tails. <i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve been here for Kei. It&rsquo;s awful to be alone.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You were.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s how I know it&rsquo;s awful.&rdquo;</i></p><p>All\n three of us sighed at the same time. Even the turtle. We were a long \nway from home with no way to go back immediately. It sucked no matter \nhow many times it happened. </p><p>Which\n was about when I felt a faint ping at the far end of my chakra sensing \nrange. Instantly, my head jerked in the relevant direction and every \nmuscle on me tensed up, which Rin couldn&rsquo;t miss on her worst day. </p><p><i>&ldquo;I think we just found a friend,&rdquo;</i> I heard myself say.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</i>\n Rin asked, following me eagerly as we got to our feet and started \nstriding toward the edge of town. It felt like the right direction. </p><p>Except for the lake. </p><p>The\n lightning I was following wasn&rsquo;t a part of a storm, a spell, or \nanything else conveniently explainable by this world&rsquo;s phenomena. Not at\n all. I&rsquo;d know that walking live wire anywhere, and I started to pick up\n the pace toward the signature even as it took me toward the water. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh, I know who this is!&rdquo; </i>Rin chirped, and darted after me as we hurried across the waves. Isobu was still clamped tight in her arms. </p><p>What kind of shinobi would we be if we let a little water stop us from checking in? </p><p>The\n Ustaloch was a kidney bean-shaped body of water that seemed to be a \nfocal point of local superstition. Rin had encountered giant water \nsnakes here during her week&rsquo;s stay, which seemed to be native. After \ntying them in a knot, there wasn&rsquo;t much else to prove to the \nout-of-place fauna. Rin knew it, I knew it, and anything that survived a\n Rin-rampage was probably going to live long enough to learn it. </p><p>Thus, we didn&rsquo;t run into any threats for a while. </p><p>The\n lakeshore butted up against forest, but not true woods as we&rsquo;d come to \nunderstand in Konoha. There, the trees were wider around than any human \narm-span at a dead minimum. Here, I got the impression that the logging \nindustry was less of an organized affair and more just because people \naround here didn&rsquo;t have any other way to heat their houses in the \nwinter. Coming to a world without basic amenities felt like such a step \nback it wasn&rsquo;t on the same continent.</p><p>And we weren&rsquo;t.</p><p>My feet hit sand again a little before Rin&rsquo;s did, and we clambered up onto the shore and into tree cover. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Wait&hellip; Is that&hellip;?&rdquo;</i> Rin murmured behind me, just as the source of Kakashi&rsquo;s chakra signature padded into view.</p><p>My first thought was, <i>Holy fuck he&rsquo;s a werewolf.</i></p><p>My second was, <i>Oh fucking hell he&rsquo;s big.</i></p><p>Hanging\n around summoned animals a lot had a way of messing with one&rsquo;s sense of \nscale, but I was still sure the white wolf in front of me had to be well\n over three times as big as a normal one. At least. The heavy snow-white\n coat was interrupted only by a black muzzle split by two rows of \nwhite-and-red teeth and a dark spot over his left eye, like someone \ncopy-pasted the coat of a sweet mutt over a dire wolf&rsquo;s frame. All of \nhis teeth were bared and his breath formed thick fog in the moonlit cold\n air. </p><p>That rumble definitely wasn&rsquo;t thunder. Instead, it sounded like a growl.</p><p><b>You know, I think I could keep him from biting anyone.</b></p><p>Well, I thought as I felt Rin grip my arm, shit.</p><p>Rin\n and I started moving parallel to the massive wolf, along the lakeshore \nand through cattails. Neither of us took our eyes off him.</p><p>Sure,\n Kakashi&rsquo;s long strides mirrored my movements exactly like a large \npredator would, but hell. I was at least as vicious as a wolf of any \nsize. And he didn&rsquo;t seem to want to head into the water. Instead, those \nmismatched eyes stayed on us, glittering in the dark. If I had to guess,\n neither Rin nor I came up to his shoulder. Rin in particular. </p><p><b>He can bite me.</b></p><p>There were, apparently, some concrete benefits to having an invulnerable companion. Same principle as a crocodile,\n I theorized. My thoughts weren&rsquo;t too frantic, though seeing a Sharingan\n in a wolf&rsquo;s face was fairly unsettling. There wasn&rsquo;t any recognition in\n that gaze that I could detect. Wolves have more muscles to close their jaws than they do to open them. Or at least the muscles are stronger.</p><p>I\n felt Rin&rsquo;s chakra pulse as she activated the first stage of her \nStrength of a Hundred seal, just in case. Well, there went the threat \nlevel of this little encounter. On his best day, Kakashi couldn&rsquo;t hope \nto beat Rin at arm wrestling. On Rin&rsquo;s best day, <i>Gamabunta </i>would lose.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Let me know if you want me to keep him busy,&rdquo;</i> Rin said softly. </p><p>Out of the corner of my mouth, I said, <i>&ldquo;Maybe once I have a plan. Isobu&rsquo;s talking.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b>Speaking\n of, I meant &ldquo;he can bite me&rdquo; more in the manner of a dog trying to pick\n up a ball too big for its mouth. You know the look.</b></p><p>&hellip;Isobu.</p><p><b>If it works, I doubt either of </b><b>us</b><b> will care how silly it looks. And Rin would hardly mention it. </b></p><p>Isobu, please don&rsquo;t break his teeth. We have no idea how any of this shit works.</p><p><b>Having not seen a competent dentist&hellip; Fine.</b></p><p>I\n picked Isobu up by his shell. In my hands, he curled into a spiked \nmedicine ball of doom. Tossing him up and down a few times to get a \nsense of his weight, I nodded to Rin. Then I held him one-handed and \neyed Kakashi&rsquo;s growling form. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Chew on this,&rdquo;</i> I suggested cheerfully, and pitched Isobu right at his face.</p><p>Once\n upon a time, a version of me with her nose constantly in a book read an\n awful lot about strange beasts and magical principles. I&rsquo;d never lived \nthose rules, of course, because there was one such system in my life and\n it was already bullshit enough for two. But in those books had been \nstories of how all sorts of animal minds worked.</p><p>Per\n the works of one Sir Terry Pratchett, werewolves kept one foot in the \nhuman world and a paw in the world of wolves. Made them a bit of both. \nAnd what did you call a wolf with human influence spanning back \ngenerations uncounted?</p><p>Maybe, just a bit, there was a bit of dog in there.</p><p>I probably should have predicted what happened next.</p><p>Kakashi\n whipped his huge head around and snatched Isobu neatly out of the air. \nHe fumbled for a split second, teeth or tongue catching Isobu&rsquo;s spikes \nthe wrong way, but stubbornly refused to let the little monster drop. \nThe head jerk motion was nearly the same as a natural wolf&rsquo;s, but it&rsquo;d \nbeen designed for prey the equivalent size of a mouse. Isobu was a \nlittle too round and tough.</p><p>Isobu\n hadn&rsquo;t discussed his next move with me, but in theory he was capable of\n keeping Kakashi&rsquo;s entire head restrained with just his tails. He \nstarted to uncoil, gripping fur with his little hands.</p><p>And then Kakashi shook his head exactly\n like the signature back-breaking swing I&rsquo;d only observed in terriers \nbefore. Also in Pakkun, but Pakkun hunted about as often as pigs flew. \nIsobu made a noise like a pissed-off cat and two of his tails looped \naround Kakashi&rsquo;s lower jaw, but that didn&rsquo;t seem to stop him. He just \nadjusted his grip on Isobu and half-closed his eyes, shaking my combat \nbuddy so hard I heard Isobu swear inside my head from frustration.</p><p><i>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not hurting him, is it?&rdquo;</i> Rin asked worriedly.</p><p>Isobu&rsquo;s cursing was definitely the angry kind.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think&mdash;Kakashi, is that fun?&rdquo;</i> I asked before I could stop myself. </p><p>At\n the sound of my voice, his mismatched eyes locked on me again. I wasn&rsquo;t\n sure he recognized my voice, because both of our bodies were kinda \nfucked up and our faces were&hellip;intact. Hell if I knew what we smelled \nlike.</p><p>Rin at least looked like herself, even if she was glowing a bit from her jutsu. </p><p>Then\n he dropped his chest and forelegs to the bank, his straight tail up and\n wagging. His non-Sharingan eye angled up, toward us, and one of his \nears almost flopped as he let out a noise not unlike a growl. But \nhigher.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh no.&rdquo;</i> I fought valiantly to keep my hand from hitting my face. I had horns now. It&rsquo;d probably hurt.<i> &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Rin started to snicker.</p><p><b>I take back what I said about my brilliant plan.</b></p><p>You made that bed, and now you get to lie in it, I told him, but I stepped toward the bank anyway.</p><p>Kakashi skittered back at least a meter.</p><p>I stepped forward twice. </p><p>Kakashi retreated two meters.</p><p>Aw, dammit. I facepalmed anyway, and damn the consequences. <i>&ldquo;Hey, Kakashi. Drop him, please.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Kakashi&rsquo;s response was something like <i>&ldquo;Awuf.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Kakashi.&rdquo; </i>I crouched just a bit, my tail lashing.<i> &ldquo;Come on, drop the turtle.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Though her hands covered her mouth, Rin managed to say, <i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s listening.&rdquo;</i></p><p>He did not drop the turtle. In fact, he turned tail and booked it when I darted for Isobu&rsquo;s loose tail. The only saving grace was that the island wasn&rsquo;t that big. He couldn&rsquo;t run forever.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I DON&rsquo;T CARE IF YOU&rsquo;RE A HUNDRED KILOS BIGGER, GET BACK HERE!&rdquo;</i></p><p>Rin was too doubled over with laughter to help. </p><p>Like I said. Probably should have seen that coming.</p><p>It\n took five hours for Kakashi to finally keel over for a nap. Still giant\n and wolfy and with Isobu trapped between his dinner plate paws, but at \nleast he stopped running. The night&rsquo;s festivities were like playing keep\n away if the ball kept shrieking out of injured pride, chasing away \nnesting birds and generally making a racket. Had I actually been able to\n sleep, it probably would have pissed me off something fierce. \nOtherwise, the screaming mostly marked Kakashi&rsquo;s location and helped me \nkeep a bead on them while the chase was on.</p><p>As\n a direct result of these shenanigans, I was dead on my feet by morning.\n Plenty of chakra left, but not perhaps the best control. Also, crabbier\n than Isobu. In my experience, no amount of foreign caffeine made up for\n just never getting to sleep, even if I knew where to get any. </p><p>Rin patted my head when I mentioned this problem. <i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Kakashi had fun.&rdquo;</i></p><p>At\n least I could lean against Kakashi&rsquo;s white flank to rest once he \nsettled. Rin was sitting on his other side, humming as she did a medical\n scan. All the data was coming up Dog. I supposed he could\n be a dire wolf, albeit one with strange markings. I had a vague notion \nthat real dire wolves were supposed to have spikes like Isobu, though. \nAnd be a lot more aggressive than Kakashi was, once the ice was broken. </p><p>While\n dawn&rsquo;s first light touched the treetops and the sky turned orange and \nclouds became pink, Kakashi raised his huge head with his tongue lolling\n out of his mouth. He nosed at the world&rsquo;s most dangerous tennis ball, \nand Isobu roused. </p><p>Isobu,\n still trapped between his paws, grumbled like an annoyed alligator and \npoked his head out of the mountain of fur. He tolerated the prodding \nwith bad grace, then said, <i><b>&ldquo;I cannot help but notice that he is still huge and fluffy.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s\n been bothering me, too. I mean, he&rsquo;s a perfectly healthy giant animal \nat the moment, but he has Kakashi&rsquo;s chakra signature.&rdquo;</i> When I leaned my head back to look askance at her, Rin could only shrug. <i>&ldquo;Really. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on! This is magic, and that&rsquo;s both intriguing and incredibly frustrating.&rdquo;</i> She patted Kakashi&rsquo;s fur. <i>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get you back to normal somehow, all right?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Kakashi made a &ldquo;whuf&rdquo; noise and twisted until his snout could nearly rest in my lap. Then he sighed, as though content. </p><p>Unfortunately,\n I couldn&rsquo;t wait forever. I lifted his head off me about five minutes \nlater, letting him make sad puppy eyes at me as I got to my feet. Next \non my to-do list was tearing into my emergency supplies.</p><p>Yes, I still had them in a storage seal in my foot. It was harder to replace than conventionally stored bags. </p><p>At\n some point during life as a member of any shinobi corps, people learned\n to pack efficiently whether they wanted to or not. Setting aside the \nperennial issue of folding versus rolling and how putting storage \nscrolls inside of each other tended to result in explosions, I retrieved\n three full sets of clothes that didn&rsquo;t compensate for the tail I \nsported now. Fortunately, one of them turned out to be Izo&rsquo;s \nWhitebeard-emblazoned T-shirt and the bright red jacket (designed for \npeople who were over two meters tall). Uniform pants were a little \nharder to be sure of, but I had a pair cut for Obito since he was still in the &ldquo;throw it all in&rdquo; school of keeping shit organized and needed a bit of help. Instead, I got to be pack mule.</p><p>By\n the time the sun rose, I expected Kakashi to turn back into a person. \nAt least then I could yell at him properly for scaring me.</p><p>Instead,\n he shook his head with so much force that he sent a ripple through his \nentire body, his ears pricking to attention. Rin&rsquo;s grip in his fur was \nthankfully strong enough to keep her from being tossed to the ground, \nbut it was a close thing. He rolled to his feet all at once, with Rin \nstill on his back, and looked around frantically until his mismatched \neyes landed on me.</p><p><i>&ldquo;&hellip;You all right?&rdquo;</i> I asked, even as I raised my hand.</p><p>He\n pushed his nose into my hand. It was wet and his breath was hot, coming\n in quick pants. His normal eye was dark with the whites showing around \nthe edges, and his Sharingan spun slowly as fear set in.</p><p>I\n grabbed onto his fur with both hands. He lowered his head until I could\n press my forehead to his, planting a kiss in the middle of his fur. \nWhile the whine in his throat echoed up through me, too, I stroked the \nsides of his head and tried to soothe the fear. I could feel the panic \ntrying to control him and the growl starting to build, but I hung on \nanyway. I wasn&rsquo;t any better, now that I knew for sure he was really in there and not just his chakra. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Shh, shh,&rdquo;</i> I\n murmured. Above my head, I felt Rin&rsquo;s hand briefly brush mine as she, \ntoo, tried her best to let Kakashi know we were both here for him.<i> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you now, all right? Everything&rsquo;s going to be okay.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Rin slid down his back until she could touch ground again. <i>&ldquo;You look totally different, but you only just realized it now, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Kakashi made a mournful noise, his ears flat against his skull. </p><p>It\n took us a while to convince him, but eventually Kakashi laid miserably \non the ground next to me. With my backpack wide open so Rin could use \nit, we all curled up together on that bleak little shore as Rin scanned \nhis chakra again. </p><p>Kakashi\n leaned into my side and my arm clung to his thick fur ruff. Though I \ncouldn&rsquo;t claim to be a mind reader, I was pretty good at moods if people\n around me had chakra to read. Kakashi did believe us, to a point, but \nthe rest of his signature rattled with undirected, unfamiliar fear. </p><p>Rin\n started slowly going through her medical checks. Her chakra was clamped\n down hard as her training took over, hands glowing faintly green in my \nmind&rsquo;s eye. Even from my comparatively amateur understanding of animal \ntransformations, Kakashi&rsquo;s stamina was shot to hell and his confidence \nhad taken a beating, so it was no wonder why Rin was so serious. At \nleast no one had hurt him before found him. That was something. </p><p>It had to be.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here. We&rsquo;ll get through this.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Kakashi whined with his muzzle in his paws. In that tone, I heard, What happened?</p><p>While\n Rin scanned Kakashi for abnormalities, I explained what I knew about \nwerewolves&mdash;infections and moon cycles, mostly&mdash;and the knot of worry in \nmy stomach kept tightening alongside Kakashi&rsquo;s lightning chakra. It \ndidn&rsquo;t mean anything to him. It was all empty words. </p><p>I didn&rsquo;t know what the fuck I was talking about in this world, and that scared all of us.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Do you remember how you ended up this way?&rdquo;</i> I asked him, barely keeping my voice steady.</p><p>Kakashi shook his huge head just enough to get his point across, terrified of dislodging me. </p><p>Getting\n occasionally knocked unconscious or fainting were facts of life as \nshinobi. Kakashi, with the drain from the Sharingan, viewed the latter \nas an old and irritating friend. But losing control? Losing his body? Never. In his entire life, Kakashi lost a grand total of maybe an hour to altered states of consciousness from genjutsu tricks or getting drunk. His discipline allowed no more. </p><p>Losing control wasn&rsquo;t something he did. This was a whole new frontier of impossible to deal with.</p><p>He\n did his best to keep his eyes both locked on Rin as she took his pulse \nand listened to his breathing, trying to figure out where it had all \ngone wrong. She wasn&rsquo;t a vet. She&rsquo;d practiced on humans. We were so \nscrewed.</p><p><i>&ldquo;As far as I can tell, you&rsquo;re perfectly healthy,&rdquo;</i> Rin said finally, running her fingers over one of his dinner plate-sized paws. <i>&ldquo;Just\n a giant wolf. This has to be another magic thing. It might also explain\n why it took you until now to remember you&rsquo;re supposed to be human. You \nreally didn&rsquo;t remember anything?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Lowering\n his head onto his paws again, he sighed deeply. Perhaps in direct \nresponse, Isobu started carding his much smaller hands through Kakashi&rsquo;s\n fur. Maybe he just wanted to see what it felt like. It wasn&rsquo;t like real\n animals often let him close. </p><p><i><b>&ldquo;From one perspective,&rdquo;</b></i> Isobu said thoughtfully, <b><i>&ldquo;it is very like being an inexperienced jinch&#363;riki.&rdquo;</i></b> Bobbing in the lake, Isobu wiggled all of his tails as Kakashi jerked his head toward him.<b><i> &ldquo;I\n think Kei remembers her early experiences well because she did not \nreach V2 before learning some self-control. But I recall instances where\n other jinch&#363;riki have not been so lucky.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>Utakata\n came to mind immediately, though he&rsquo;d hit his berserker threshold early\n due to severe injury. All of his usual surgical precision careened out \nthe window. Then Blue B and the time Gy&#363;ki&rsquo;s seal split wide open. And \nthen there was our very own Naruto&hellip;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Though there is one big exception,&rdquo;</i>\n I said, when Kakashi made a little acknowledging noise. His feelings on\n the matter were still fairly negative, but he&rsquo;d dealt with worse. <i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you can exactly &lsquo;befriend&rsquo; the wolf mind. At least, not like Isobu.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;I, for example, am a person. Your affliction seems to have superimposed the mind of a dog on top of yours. Temporarily.&rdquo;</b></i> Isobu eyed Kakashi carefully as he thought about what to say next. He tucked his little hands under his belly. <i>&ldquo;<b>Without a proper tongue, can you use that eye of yours to speak to us?</b>&rdquo;</i></p><p>I glanced down at the top of Kakashi&rsquo;s head. <i>&ldquo;That might work?&rdquo; <br /></i></p><p><i></i>I was mostly surprised that suggestion came from Isobu,\n because he&rsquo;d never been fond of Kakashi&rsquo;s use of the Sharingan. \nTolerated? Sure. Occasionally been grateful for in desperate \ncircumstances? Fine. But he generally didn&rsquo;t volunteer to have anything \nto do with the Sharingan if at all possible. </p><p><i>&ldquo;If that would work, I think you&rsquo;re in the right place to try it.&rdquo; </i>Rin&rsquo;s eyes were a little glazed over as she went over the data her scan gave her, but she was clearly listening. </p><p>Kakashi\n made a curious noise in the back of his throat, ears twitching. He \nnosed at Isobu again, then met the little beastie&rsquo;s eye with his \nSharingan. As though now was the perfect time to test it. I kept my \nhands in his fur for the length of the staring contest, feeling my \nnerves tremble in anticipation of whatever other curveballs this place \ncould throw our way. We didn&rsquo;t need any more.</p><p>A second later, Isobu said as though in response to a question, <b>&ldquo;</b><b>No. There was a threat display</b><b>&rdquo;</b>&mdash;which had been terrifying in the moment because I hadn&rsquo;t known what to do&mdash;<b>&ldquo;but once you had me in your teeth, it was all a game. You did not hurt anyone.</b><b>&rdquo;</b></p><p>I sagged in relief. Thank fuck it worked. </p><p>&ldquo;And then we had a nice nap. Or you did,&rdquo; Rin added, as Kakashi deflated slightly from sheer relief. His tail thumped the ground once while she spoke, &ldquo;With Isobu tucked between your huge paws, after playing Keep Away with him.&rdquo;</p><p>Kakashi\n managed a mortified expression, even as near-unrecognizable as he was. \nHis chakra burned with shame. He whined uncomfortably.</p><p><i>&ldquo;You absolutely did.&rdquo;</i> Rin smiled for the first time since Kakashi had realized the situation. She scratched his ears. <i>&ldquo;It was worse than when Pakkun tried teaching a stray dog how Fetch worked.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Kakashi\n twisted his head over so he could rub at his Sharingan against his \nforeleg. Then he sighed up at both of us. Those eyes seemed to ask, <i>What now?</i></p><p>I\n had no idea. All I could think of was going back to the circus and \ntelling them I&rsquo;d have to leave for the foreseeable future, because my \nfianc&eacute; had been magically transformed into an animal and everything was \nterrible. I couldn&rsquo;t stick around. Rin and I needed to find a way to fix\n this. </p><p>Kakashi sighed deeply. </p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Body modifications seem to be all the rage, now,&rdquo;</b></i>\n Isobu griped while we all tried to absorb what kind of situation we&rsquo;d \nbeen dropped into. He curled his tails around Rin&rsquo;s wrist and mine, then\n sat squarely on Kakashi&rsquo;s right front paw. <i><b>&ldquo;We cannot \njust sit idle and hope for a solution to fall onto our heads. You are a \ndog, I am small, Kei has a limb she cannot use, and Rin has also been \nchanged on some spiritual level. These things are unfortunate, but we \nare alive. We are capable. And we will find a way to get our bodies \nback.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>Kakashi snorted, but he accepted the ear rubs when Rin offered. </p><p>For\n normal people, the phrase &ldquo;hiked the lake back to town&rdquo; probably needed\n to be modified by the word &ldquo;around.&rdquo; Not so for us. Even \nKakashi-turned-Suicune. Or whatever he was. </p><p>At least<i> something</i> went right today.</p><p>This feeling did not last once the morning mist burned off, because it never did. Town was different overnight.</p><p>Trekking\n back to the circus, only to find that everyone was under house arrest \nand the place was on lockdown thanks to the Crownsguard, was a bit of a \nshock. Learning about a minor zombie outbreak followed in that vein, \nbecause of course it did. Since I couldn&rsquo;t waltz into camp without a \ndisguise and daylight guards were almost always more alert than \ngraveyard-shifters, the three of us moved on to poking the periphery.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry\n if this is&hellip;rude, but, uh.&rdquo; Without the brightly colored costumes the \ncircus folks wore, I at least couldn&rsquo;t be instantly picked out as one of\n the crew. It was pragmatic, but not particularly nice for the ones \nwho&rsquo;d been arrested. &ldquo;If I could just get past&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Move\n along already, you nosy devil.&rdquo; The Crownsguard spat to the side even \nas all of us watched him. &ldquo;Everyone here is under suspicion of murder.&rdquo; </p><p>Kakashi, with his fur held tight by Rin&rsquo;s hands, didn&rsquo;t quite manage to avoid growling as the guard got in my face. </p><p>&ldquo;Keep your damn dog on a leash,&rdquo; was the guard&rsquo;s suggestion before he really got sick of us. </p><p>In\n some worlds, dogs wore collars. Or service vests. Or both. To get \nKakashi&rsquo;s way-too-damn-big wolf form into town, Rin and I puzzled over \nthe problem until we remembered the vests and headbands Kakashi made for\n all of his dogs back when he had proper thumbs instead of dewclaws. So,\n after digging through our emergency supplies and scrubbing what seemed \nto be deer blood from around Kakashi&rsquo;s dark muzzle, we&rsquo;d collaborated.</p><p>The\n Whitebeard jacket was tied around his thick neck like a cheery little \nscarf, the sleeves arranged into a bow. Somehow combining that with a \nleash made of rope&mdash;attached to the jacket, not his neck&mdash;made him a &ldquo;dog&rdquo;\n in human brains. </p><p>A very, <i>very</i> big dog that smelled like the forest. </p><p>Isobu might&rsquo;ve messed with the guards&rsquo; heads a bit to make it work, but it worked no matter how much we cheated. Therefore, it was victory through technicality. </p><p>Kakashi\n was very patient through the entire process and even let a different \nguard shake his paw, which was more than I would have offered at the \ntime. Then again, I probably would have been turned into a turtle if I \nwasn&rsquo;t already a demon-blooded person. Apparently. </p><p>In the end, we ditched the crime scene and went looking around for help.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;It could have been more humiliating if we tried, yes,&rdquo;</b></i> Isobu said to Kakashi&rsquo;s apparently Sharingan-transferred question. <i><b>&ldquo;I have already pretended to be a ventriloquist dummy. Most people do not realize I am a person, either.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>Kakashi sighed, and both Rin and I patted his hulking shoulders. </p><p>And,\n because Kakashi&rsquo;s nose was more useful than my inherent radar in a \nworld where only the four of us had chakra, we managed to track down the\n only member of the circus who wasn&rsquo;t trapped either in the stockade or \nthe campground. It took a few minutes, and we scared more than a few \npeople while trotting through town in our search, but we did it. I could\n tell that the second Kakashi turned up his nose and refused to even \nthink of walking into a building, because he was too busy sneezing. </p><p>It\n turned out that only so many people smelled like a combination of \npatchouli, road dust, and stale alcohol, even in a town with a \ndecent-sized population. Really, the patchouli was the defining factor \nwhen it came to Mollymauk Tealeaf. And not tea. </p><p>I&rsquo;d\n noticed strange things in the performers&rsquo; boxes while helping out at \nthe circus, but I couldn&rsquo;t track a drop of perfume across a country. \nKakashi could. Even if he still hated the smell. </p><p>There was a comparison to be made to Prince Humperdinck, but that was a different story.</p><p>Anyway, we found the world&rsquo;s most colorful fortune teller in an inn off the side of the street. </p><p>Kakashi\n and Isobu stayed outside, with Isobu sitting on the end of his lead as \nthough he was responsible in the slightest. Kakashi, for his part, \nsettled on the ground with his muzzle on his paws and made a miserable \nnoise. The smell of alcohol didn&rsquo;t agree with him, but bacon probably \ndid. There was a hindbrain-level instinct for meat rattling around in \nthere. </p><p>I needed to find some way to feed him, and it couldn&rsquo;t involve setting him loose on wildlife. Unless he wanted to do that. </p><p>Molly\n wasn&rsquo;t terribly colorful when I walked in, or at least hadn&rsquo;t been for a\n bit. Instead, Molly sat at a table and carefully wiped off enough \nmakeup to disguise a clown. His solid red gaze darted to me and then Rin\n when he noticed us entering the Nestled Nook Inn, and he waved with his\n free hand. &ldquo;Good to see you, Carey. Rin, too. Rough night?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Okay, where did I start? &ldquo;I guess. I think yours might&rsquo;ve been worse.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh,\n I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Molly eyed me as the last of the peach-colored makeup \nwas wiped away. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s an unjust arrest and unfriendly small town, in \nthe grand scheme of things? Sure, the Crownsguard are probably going to \nkill us all if they can&rsquo;t find whoever turned the old man into a \nmonster, but&hellip;&rdquo; Molly paused. &ldquo;You know, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s really a \nbright side to that. How about you?&rdquo; </p><p>I glanced at Rin, who shrugged. Ought I tell Molly about Kakashi&rsquo;s rather fuzzy problem? Or Rin&rsquo;s super strength?</p><p>&ldquo;Did\n your friend just keep you up all night?&rdquo; Molly flashed a sharp-toothed \ngrin, but his heart wasn&rsquo;t in it. While the grin didn&rsquo;t waver, my \nstone-faced response didn&rsquo;t seem to be encouraging. &ldquo;Trouble in \nparadise?&rdquo; he tried again.</p><p><b>Was that supposed to be an innuendo?</b></p><p><i>Yeah, nope. Not telling him shit.</i> I\n ignored the comment and sat down at the table, followed almost \nimmediately by Rin and then Isobu as he rolled into the bar area, the \nlatter of whom couldn&rsquo;t see over the edge of the table. </p><p>He did send me an awful image of the underside of said table, just to be an ass. Or to repay my comment, perhaps. </p><p>I shook the picture from my mind&rsquo;s eye and asked Molly, &ldquo;What exactly happened last night?&rdquo; </p><p>Molly\n did lay his cards out on the table, once I proved unwilling to play \nalong with any teasing. He explained, likely not for the first time, \nthat the show had gone on exactly as it always had for the majority of \nthe time last night. Right up until an old man turned into an undead \nmonster and killed someone else, who then also\n turned into an undead monster. Running with the theory that the circus \nwasn&rsquo;t in the business of murdering customers, Molly and his new \nco-conspirators&mdash;coincidentally the same motley crew he&rsquo;d charmed into \nattending just yesterday morning&mdash;had spent most of today investigating \nthe old man&rsquo;s usual haunts.</p><p>&ldquo;And we found basically nothing,&rdquo; said a new voice. </p><p>I\n leaned back a bit and spotted a woman in blue robes stomping down the \nstairs. Now that I had better light and more inclination to give a shit,\n the blue fabric of her outfit reminded me quite a lot\n of some of the more coastal towns in the Land of Fire and perhaps even \nwhat I&rsquo;d seen in the Fire Temple I&rsquo;d visited once. Though the specific \npattern was unfamiliar, there were some similarities to the cloth used \nin the Land of Water as well. Her features were more like mine than, \nsay, any human I&rsquo;d met so far. </p><p>Actually, she kind of looked like Sokka.</p><p><b>I do not see how that helps us.</b></p><p>That\n woman was followed almost immediately by a blue tiefling with dark, \nbackward-curling, silver-capped horns more like Molly&rsquo;s than mine. She \nwas probably a hand&rsquo;s span shorter than I was, wearing a dark blue slit \nskirt peppered with peach and pink tones. Her sleeves almost reached the\n floor, but in a Western style instead of a furisode, and she wore both a\n half-length green cape and a sickle in a sheath on her belt. </p><p>And\n then there was the half-orc behind her, dressed head to toe in dark \nleather armor. The two-tone green on him looked a little odd when I \nthought back to the only other half-orc I knew, but I was literally \ndull, dark pink all over and two of the other people at the table were \nblue and lavender. At this point, the time for pointing fingers was \npast. A scar bisected his eyebrow and formed an X further up his face, \nand his hair was dark, half-shaved, and sported a sharp gray streak. If I\n had to guess, he might&rsquo;ve been older than I was, and he was definitely \naround Kakashi&rsquo;s height. </p><p>Well, before he got turned into a giant wolf.</p><p>I\n cleared my throat as our table got a bit more crowded, thanks to the \nwoman in blue, the blue tiefling, and the half-orc from the last inn \nincursion. I cleared my throat. &ldquo;Okay. Well, then, it&rsquo;s about time for \nintroductions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Seems\n like we&rsquo;re all in the same boat,&rdquo; agreed the half-orc as he dragged a \nchair over to the table. &ldquo;I figure Molly might&rsquo;ve introduced us, but \nagain from the top, just so we&rsquo;re all clear. The name&rsquo;s Fjord, with a \nJ.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I\n am Jester!&rdquo; Jester beamed as she followed suit, sliding into place next\n to Fjord. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get any of your names before, but it is very nice \nto meet you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Beau,\n short for Beauregard,&rdquo; was the monk&rsquo;s terse response. Though I \ncertainly couldn&rsquo;t make judgement calls on what parents named their \nkids, Beau still added, &ldquo;My parents wanted a boy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\n see,&rdquo; I said, while Isobu clambered up onto the edge of the table and \nfolded his forelegs like some kind of mob boss. He didn&rsquo;t quite have the\n shoulder rotation range, however. &ldquo;By the way, Molly, I wanted to \napologize for something else.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well, we can get that out of the way first.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I\n lied when I told all of you my name, before.&rdquo; I picked Gustav&rsquo;s fake \nidentification paperwork out of a pocket and set it flat on the table. \nBeauregard just picked it up to stare at it, scrutinizing me. &ldquo;If you \nall like, you can call me Keisuke. Or Kei. These two do.&rdquo; </p><p>Isobu nodded firmly. &ldquo;<b>The\n fake name was useful for deflecting attention, but there does not seem \nto be much point. There is no one here to recognize us. Thus, you may \ncall me Isobu.</b>&rdquo; His eye narrowed to a glowing red slit that made him look like a monster from the depths, if the depths were floor height. &ldquo;<b>And if any of you call me </b><i><b>anything</b></i><b> but my name, I will douse you in ice water until you learn better.</b>&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh, I wish I spoke this language,&rdquo; </i>Rin said after a second, waiting for an Isobu translation that didn&rsquo;t seem to be forthcoming. <i>&ldquo;I miss so many more jokes this way. Even more than normal.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Okay,\n okay, O Kei.&rdquo; And so it began. Molly&rsquo;s tail lashed as he sat back, \nthough the grin quickly slipped off his face. What had happened to the \ncircus must&rsquo;ve really rattled him. I wasn&rsquo;t nearly as close to anyone \nthere as Molly was, but spontaneous zombies weren&rsquo;t reassuring either. \n&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t quite get that, Rin, but don&rsquo;t worry. I don&rsquo;t think you got \nwhat I said earlier.&rdquo;</p><p>This time, Isobu did translate, and Rin&rsquo;s reply amounted to, &ldquo;Thanks for your patience!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Are you doing some kind of ventriloquist thing?&rdquo; Beau asked Rin.</p><p>After Isobu repeated the question&mdash;and finally explained what a ventriloquist was&mdash;Rin said,<i> &ldquo;Isobu speaks two languages. I don&rsquo;t. I like the idea of having Isobu as our translator.&rdquo; </i>Rin added, after a moment&rsquo;s thought,<i> &ldquo;He&rsquo;s really quite clever about it.&rdquo;</i></p><p>This didn&rsquo;t seem to work out for Beau, but it wasn&rsquo;t like she could interrogate her.</p><p><i>&ldquo;You say that now.&rdquo;</i>\n I sighed, then I looked squarely to Beauregard and had a sudden flash \nof Yugito, who was one of the few people I knew who played devil&rsquo;s \nadvocate because she had a chip on her shoulder the size of Matatabi. \n&ldquo;Nonetheless. If you need any help with this, count us in.&rdquo;</p><p>Rin nudged me once Isobu had translated.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh,&rdquo;\n I corrected myself, &ldquo;mostly. If I skip sleeping any more, I&rsquo;ll be \nuseless for an investigation.&rdquo; What with the whole giant wolf problem, I\n could probably help with the investigation as long as Rin kept an eye \non Kakashi. Kakashi could clearly still recognize us while huge and \nfluffy and taken over by dog-instincts, but we didn&rsquo;t know what the \nexact catalyst for his transformation was and couldn&rsquo;t predict much \nabout it. </p><p>Molly didn&rsquo;t even blink as the opportunity for innuendo passed. Maybe he really was distracted. </p><p>&ldquo;That\n is good for now. Now we are just waiting for the stinky wizard and the \nlittle one to join us finally.&rdquo; Jester glanced up at the door. Per \nMolly, they&rsquo;d branched off to search the town on their own because they \nwere the only ones not slapped with &ldquo;person of interest&rdquo; status. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Rin? Do you know anything?&rdquo; </i>I asked.</p><p>Rin shook her head even before I finished asking the question.<i> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I don&rsquo;t know who those people might be.&rdquo;</i></p><p>And I hadn&rsquo;t been in town back then. Oh well. To the others, I said, &ldquo;So, what do we do for now?&rdquo;</p><p>Unfortunately,\n we were in a tavern. There was an obvious option. Molly checked his \ncoin purse and clearly thought of ordering everything. He leaned back a \nbit in his seat to get the barkeep&rsquo;s attention. </p><p>Oh dear.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, O Kei, I haven&rsquo;t seen you drink in all the time I&rsquo;ve known you. Teetotaler?&rdquo; Molly asked. </p><p>&ldquo;I\n found out four years ago I&rsquo;m literally incapable of getting drunk,&rdquo; I \nsaid, though the entirely unfair contest with the Whitebeard Pirates had\n been kind of funny. It&rsquo;d turned into more of a bladder endurance match \nthan anything after about the fifteenth drink. &ldquo;And before that, it \nwasn&rsquo;t to my taste.&rdquo; </p><p>Molly\n and Beau were both looking at me like I&rsquo;d told them I had a terminal \ndisease. I could feel the goblin&rsquo;s eyes on the side of my head, too. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you poor dear,&rdquo; Molly began.</p><p>Rin laughed as I debated flipping Molly off for being a condescending prick. <i>&ldquo;It really doesn&rsquo;t mean much in a society that has safe drinking water. Maybe it means more here?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Ah, but we can make safe water. Therefore, there is no need to drink whatever that terrible stuff is.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>Rin and Isobu exchanged a very silly low-five as I sighed. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Nice to see you have my back,&rdquo;</i> I griped.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo;\n said Beau, snapping her fingers to get my attention. I felt Isobu&rsquo;s \nhackles rise and had to silently shush him, or else he&rsquo;d have crunched \nthrough the table with all the restraint of, well, him. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your \nstory?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\n had some bad luck, and the circus helped me out with the papers and so \non,&rdquo; I said, meeting her gaze without changing my expression at all. I&rsquo;d\n been eyeballed by tougher customers before, and most of them had been \ntwo seconds leaping over obstacles to murder me. This was nothing. &ldquo;And \nhelped me reunite with Rin, even if they didn&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;d find her in \nTrostenwald. So, here we are.&rdquo; </p><p>Beau\n scowled. &ldquo;Then what was that about not moving at night? You&rsquo;re not \nwanted by the Crownsguard. You didn&rsquo;t get arrested. What&rsquo;s the story \nthere?&rdquo; </p><p>I\n thought about making a sexually suggestive quip solely to get Beau to \nstop bothering me, then dismissed the option. Instead, I looked to Rin \nfor confirmation and got another bored shrug in response. Rin was too \nbusy trying to decide if she was going to be in the throes of her \ncuriosity to bother with me. Rin was just having fun with Science, and \nJester seemed patient enough to tolerate the prodding.</p><p>&ldquo;Call\n it luck,&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;I had the night off. And for better or for \nworse, the Crownsguard hasn&rsquo;t assumed all tieflings know each other.&rdquo; </p><p>Molly\n flipped me off with his free hand, not even bothering to put his drink \ndown. Entirely in line with circus communication as I&rsquo;d seen it.</p><p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t know you until today.&rdquo; Jester tilted her head to one side, like a dog hearing a new sound. </p><p>Speaking of, was that shouting coming from outside? And growling. </p><p>Um.</p><p>&ldquo;Be right back!&rdquo; </p>",
