They were walking across the courtyard of Winterfell and into the Godswood. It was just past morning and the sun had fully risen leaving a warm glow across the ground. The snow had packed just right, and Arya was determined to finally get Gendry to build a snowman. She remembered him telling her he never built one while they traveling the Kingsroad when they were younger. She remembered thinking how absurd it was that he never built one, but he had never seen snow before. He told her about building these ridiculous things called sandcastles from wet sand. She figured after she forced him to build a snowman he would make her build a sandcastle. She would dread that when it came, but right now she wanted nothing more than to let Gendry into a small portion of her childhood. Arya reminists building snowmen with her father and brothers when she was little, and she even smiled at the memory of her mother and sister scolding her for acting childish and unladylike. The were fond memories she would hold dear to her heart until the end of her days, but she was making new memories now. New memories with new people, new memories with her new family. Of course very few of them were related to her through blood, but it was the connection they built while they fighted the great war that mattered the most. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0When they reached the Godswood and were near the heart tree Arya motioned for Gendry to stop. This was the place she wanted to build her snowman, the same spot she built her final one years ago. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAlright,\u201d Gendry spoke. \u201cYou\u2019ve got me out here freezing me arse off, now what?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0Arya chuckled and squatted on the ground packing a small snowball in her hands before placing the ball back on the snow and rolling it till the snow began to stick to it. The ball got larger and larger until she could not push it herself. Gendry came up beside her and started to help her push the tightly packed snow across the open land. Gendry grunted quietly as the ball progressively got larger and heavier, making it near impossible to give it the final push it needed. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOnly two more to go!\u201d Arya said excitedly, Gendry looked at her with wide eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, these ones are much smaller than the last.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI still question what you Northerners consider \u2018fun\u2019.\u201d Arya had to smile at that, ignoring her friend\u2019s scoff when she bent down the build yet another snowball. Regardless of his japes, Gendry bent down and helped her to push the small ball across the ground once more. They rolled it to two-thirds the size of the much larger ball and shifted her arms underneath the ball and began to lift. Gendry moved to help her when he saw her strain against the weight. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got to lift the damned thing?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0Rolling her eyes, Arya placed the giant snowball on top of the other and smiled once they were halfway there. The pair began rolling the head before placing that too on the body of the snowman. She stepped back and admired their work, Gendry watched her with his relaxation showing on his face. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to gather stones and sticks now, and then we\u2019ll be done.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThen we can go inside by and sit by the fire?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, Gendry then we can go inside and sit by the fire.\u201d Arya deadpanned and stalked off, irritation lacin her features. Her shoulders slumped in defeat. Gendry stopped then and wondered if he was being too cruel. He could tell this meant something to her and he was being an arse, but why? Because it was a bit nippy outside? Gods, couldn\u2019t he bear the cold for someone he loved? Loved? He had never given it much thought before, but he wondered what he truly felt for awhile. He knew his feelings for Arya were not those for a friend, but he knew he could not have her for the longest time. Had that changed?</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0He walked after he quickly and saw her looking at the heart tree. She stood in front of it with her back stiff. He wrapped his arms around her middle and held her hands in place. If she hadn\u2019t want him to touch her she would have made sure he didn\u2019t. His chin rested on her shoulder and he closed his eyes; it was always unbearable to look into the eyes of the heart tree. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry for what I said. I\u2019ve been a dick.\u201d Arya nodded and look up at him over her shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me today, but I shouldn\u2019t be acting the way I am. You\u2019ve done nothing to deserve my attitude. All you want to do is build a snowman and I just keep brushing off your excitement. I haven\u2019t seen you this happy in years and I keep dampening it by being cruel. Please forgive me.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGendry, you don\u2019t need to ap-\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, I do. I can tell this is important to you and we\u2019re going to build the best damned snowman in Winterfell.\u201d Arya smiled and ducked her head before turning in his arms and hugging him back. He reached around her and grabbed the pile of sticks and stones off the ground. He walked back over to the lumps of snow and stood there awkwardly. He had no clue what he was doing. He felt Arya come up behind him and lift one of the sticks from the pile. He watched as she stuck the stick into the snow harshly till it poked out like an arm. He did the same and held the stones out to her with his other hand. She grabbed two stones and placed them on the top snowball for eyes. Gendry grabbed one and placed it for a nose and watched as Arya took a handful and placed them in a semi-circle in a mouth-like formation. The final three stones were placed on the middle snowball and looked like three buttons. He stepped back and took in the full picture. Arya moved to stand in front of him before grabbing his arms and wrapping them around herself like they stood before. He smiled a bit before resting his his attop her head this time. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt looks just like the one I built with my father and brothers years ago.\u201d She leaned back into him then and let the full weight of her body rest against his torso. \u201cI wanted to let you into a small part of my childhood. Let you know of some of our northern customs. I know you\u2019ll be traveling to the Stormlands soon, but I wanted you to remember something from the North.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cArya,\u201d Gendry whispered. \u201cI am never going to forget the North. Not when I have you in my life.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI know you have to go, but I don\u2019t want you to leave. I\u2019ve just got you back.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou know I have to.\u201d He sighed, \u201cJon legitimized me and now I have lordly responsibilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could go with you.\u201d Arya stated while turning around. Gendry smiled but said nothing. \u201cI could, Jon promised me and Sansa we would never marry if we did not want to, but I know that the lords of Westeros will not leave us alone until we are wed. They all want the power of the North, but I do not want to give them the satisfaction. When we were younger I asked you to come with me to Winterfell. I told you that I could be your family. You told me I wouldn\u2019t be your family, I would be your lady. Now I can be both. Ask me to go with you and I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that I need to make heirs for the Stormlands, Arya. If I don\u2019t then the Baratheon line will disappear from Westeros just like the Tyrells and so many others who suffered from this war. It is the reason I was legitimized, you never want to be a lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGendry, I am fully aware of what my responsibilities would be, but you would not hold me ladylike expectations. You will not cage me, and take away my own free will. Ask me to go with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArya, I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk. Me.\u201d Gendry sighed but looked down into her eyes anyway. He saw a fire burn in her grey orbs, the same fire he saw years ago while they were with the brotherhood. </p><p>\u201cArya Stark, will you ride south with me to the Stormlands and give me the honor of becoming my wife? Will you give me the honor of helping me rule my castle and ensure the Baratheon legacy lives on through our children. Will you forever be my lady?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes at the final bit, but smiled nonetheless. \u201cI will, as long as you will not call me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs my lady commands.\u201d</p>",

Gendry grunted quietly as the ball progressively got larger and heavier, making it near impossible to give it the final push it needed. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOnly two more to go!\u201d Arya said excitedly, Gendry looked at her with wide eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, these ones are much smaller than the last.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI still question what you Northerners consider \u2018fun\u2019.\u201d Arya had to smile at that, ignoring her friend\u2019s scoff when she bent down the build yet another snowball. Regardless of his japes, Gendry bent down and helped her to push the small ball across the ground once more. They rolled it to two-thirds the size of the much larger ball and shifted her arms underneath the ball and began to lift. Gendry moved to help her when he saw her strain against the weight. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got to lift the damned thing?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0Rolling her eyes, Arya placed the giant snowball on top of the other and smiled once they were halfway there. The pair began rolling the head before placing that too on the body of the snowman. She stepped back and admired their work, Gendry watched her with his relaxation showing on his face. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to gather stones and sticks now, and then we\u2019ll be done.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThen we can go inside by and sit by the fire?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, Gendry then we can go inside and sit by the fire.\u201d Arya deadpanned and stalked off, irritation lacin her features. Her shoulders slumped in defeat. Gendry stopped then and wondered if he was being too cruel. He could tell this meant something to her and he was being an arse, but why? Because it was a bit nippy outside? Gods, couldn\u2019t he bear the cold for someone he loved? Loved? He had never given it much thought before, but he wondered what he truly felt for awhile. He knew his feelings for Arya were not those for a friend, but he knew he could not have her for the longest time. Had that changed?</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0He walked after he quickly and saw her looking at the heart tree. She stood in front of it with her back stiff. He wrapped his arms around her middle and held her hands in place. If she hadn\u2019t want him to touch her she would have made sure he didn\u2019t. His chin rested on her shoulder and he closed his eyes; it was always unbearable to look into the eyes of the heart tree. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry for what I said. I\u2019ve been a dick.\u201d Arya nodded and look up at him over her shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me today, but I shouldn\u2019t be acting the way I am. You\u2019ve done nothing to deserve my attitude. All you want to do is build a snowman and I just keep brushing off your excitement. I haven\u2019t seen you this happy in years and I keep dampening it by being cruel. Please forgive me.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGendry, you don\u2019t need to ap-\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, I do. I can tell this is important to you and we\u2019re going to build the best damned snowman in Winterfell.\u201d Arya smiled and ducked her head before turning in his arms and hugging him back. He reached around her and grabbed the pile of sticks and stones off the ground. He walked back over to the lumps of snow and stood there awkwardly. He had no clue what he was doing. He felt Arya come up behind him and lift one of the sticks from the pile. He watched as she stuck the stick into the snow harshly till it poked out like an arm. He did the same and held the stones out to her with his other hand. She grabbed two stones and placed them on the top snowball for eyes. Gendry grabbed one and placed it for a nose and watched as Arya took a handful and placed them in a semi-circle in a mouth-like formation. The final three stones were placed on the middle snowball and looked like three buttons. He stepped back and took in the full picture. Arya moved to stand in front of him before grabbing his arms and wrapping them around herself like they stood before. He smiled a bit before resting his his attop her head this time. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt looks just like the one I built with my father and brothers years ago.\u201d She leaned back into him then and let the full weight of her body rest against his torso. \u201cI wanted to let you into a small part of my childhood. Let you know of some of our northern customs. I know you\u2019ll be traveling to the Stormlands soon, but I wanted you to remember something from the North.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cArya,\u201d Gendry whispered. \u201cI am never going to forget the North. Not when I have you in my life.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI know you have to go, but I don\u2019t want you to leave. I\u2019ve just got you back.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou know I have to.\u201d He sighed, \u201cJon legitimized me and now I have lordly responsibilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could go with you.\u201d Arya stated while turning around. Gendry smiled but said nothing. \u201cI could, Jon promised me and Sansa we would never marry if we did not want to, but I know that the lords of Westeros will not leave us alone until we are wed. They all want the power of the North, but I do not want to give them the satisfaction. When we were younger I asked you to come with me to Winterfell. I told you that I could be your family. You told me I wouldn\u2019t be your family, I would be your lady. Now I can be both. Ask me to go with you and I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that I need to make heirs for the Stormlands, Arya. If I don\u2019t then the Baratheon line will disappear from Westeros just like the Tyrells and so many others who suffered from this war. It is the reason I was legitimized, you never want to be a lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGendry, I am fully aware of what my responsibilities would be, but you would not hold me ladylike expectations. You will not cage me, and take away my own free will. Ask me to go with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArya, I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk. Me.\u201d Gendry sighed but looked down into her eyes anyway. He saw a fire burn in her grey orbs, the same fire he saw years ago while they were with the brotherhood. </p><p>\u201cArya Stark, will you ride south with me to the Stormlands and give me the honor of becoming my wife? Will you give me the honor of helping me rule my castle and ensure the Baratheon legacy lives on through our children. Will you forever be my lady?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes at the final bit, but smiled nonetheless. \u201cI will, as long as you will not call me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs my lady commands.\u201d</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h2>Day Three</h2><p><b>Arya and Gendry build a snowman.</b></p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;ve never built a snowman before.&rdquo; Arya scoffed at Gendry and threw a snowball past his head. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;The first time I ever saw snow was when I went beyond the Wall with Jon!&rdquo; Gendry defended himself, throwing a snowball back at her which she dodged easily. They were walking across the courtyard of Winterfell and into the Godswood. It was just past morning and the sun had fully risen leaving a warm glow across the ground. The snow had packed just right, and Arya was determined to finally get Gendry to build a snowman. She remembered him telling her he never built one while they traveling the Kingsroad when they were younger. She remembered thinking how absurd it was that he never built one, but he had never seen snow before. He told her about building these ridiculous things called sandcastles from wet sand. She figured after she forced him to build a snowman he would make her build a sandcastle. She would dread that when it came, but right now she wanted nothing more than to let Gendry into a small portion of her childhood. Arya reminists building snowmen with her father and brothers when she was little, and she even smiled at the memory of her mother and sister scolding her for acting childish and unladylike. The were fond memories she would hold dear to her heart until the end of her days, but she was making new memories now. New memories with new people, new memories with her new family. Of course very few of them were related to her through blood, but it was the connection they built while they fighted the great war that mattered the most. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;When they reached the Godswood and were near the heart tree Arya motioned for Gendry to stop. This was the place she wanted to build her snowman, the same spot she built her final one years ago. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Gendry spoke. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got me out here freezing me arse off, now what?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;Arya chuckled and squatted on the ground packing a small snowball in her hands before placing the ball back on the snow and rolling it till the snow began to stick to it.

Robb would kill her if she were late for their most crucial match of the season. They finally had a shot at beating Slytherin since Margaery&rsquo;s brother Loras had graduated. She slowed her pace as she approached the door that lead to the Gryffindor team tent where they kept their brooms and equipment when she noticed that her boot laces had come untied. As she bent to tie them, she heard Alys\u2019 voice come muffled through the door.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look now, but it looks like Jon\u2019s moved on.\u201d</p><p>Someone muttered unintelligible curse words. Arya heard the soft pitter-patter of footsteps on turf as that person crossed the tent. Arya rose without a sound to peer through the glass pane at the tent. Ygritte and Alys stood at the flap of the tent, staring into the crowd.</p><p>\u201cBy the old gods, I knew he had a thing for that insufferable Ice Queen Stark bench,\u201d Ygritte growled, knuckles white and shaking. Arya clenched the doorknob tightly. \u201cI can\u2019t stand her. She\u2019s probably only after him for the \u2019prestige\u2019,\u201d Ygritte gagged.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Arya muttered to herself. Flushed, she clenched her fist and prepared to storm through the door to give Ygritte the punch in the face she deserved. As she twisted the doorknob, a strong arm wrapped around her waist and yanked her back.</p><p>\u201cOof!\u201d She landed against a broad chest. Smoke wafted over her; she recognized her best friend instantly.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Arya grumbled, struggling to loosen his grip. \u201cLet me go, you stupid bull!\u201d<br/></p><!-- more --><p>\u201cShh!\u201d Gendry shushed her, pointing to the window. Arya glared at him but turned her attention to the girls in the tent</p><p>\u201cWatch your tongue,\u201d Alys barked. \u201cI don&rsquo;t think Robb or Arya would appreciate you talking that way about their sister. Besides, Sansa\u2019s always been nice to me.\u201d</p><p>Arya relaxed a little as Gendry put her down.</p><p>\u201cThey just make me so angry,\u201d Ygritte responded. \u201cHe should be with me instead of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChannel your aggression into the game,\u201d Alys replied. \u201cLook lively; our fearless captain will be here any minute.\u201d</p><p>Arya turned back to her expectant friend.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you stop me?\u201d She huffed. \u201cYgritte was way out of line.\u201d</p><p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; Gendry smirked. &ldquo;This game is really important to your brother, and you would have kicked yourself if you ruined it for him. You can get back at Ygritte after we beat Slytherin.&rdquo;</p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am.\u201d Gendry pushed past her to open the door. \u201cAfter you, milady.\u201d</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me that,&rdquo; Arya scowled, walking to her locker to grab the rest of her equipment. In the other corner, Alys ran through some warm-up stretches while Ygritte angrily wrestled with her arm guard. Gendry rushed to his locker to put on his shoulder pads as Arya unlocked hers. Her bat tumbled out as she rummaged through the disorganized pile of stuff. Hand closing around one of her arm guards, she quickly tied it on as Robb burst through the door followed closely by Harry Harding and Smalljon Umber.</p><p>\u201cAlright, look alive people,\u201d Robb bellowed. The team paused to listen to their captain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying this is the most important game of the season, but this is the most important game of the season. Gryffindor hasn&rsquo;t beaten Slytherin in six years, but we finally have a chance.&rdquo; The team gathered around him. &ldquo;Joffrey is a weak seeker, but the team is good at scoring. Arya, Smalljon, I don&rsquo;t want to see him anywhere near the snitch until we&rsquo;re ahead. Chasers, you&rsquo;ve got your work cut out for you, but I believe in you. Let&rsquo;s go win this! On three.&rdquo; The team formed a circle and laid their hands on top of his.</p><p>\u201cOne, two, three, Gryffindor!\u201d They shouted. Arya caught Ygritte\u2019s eye as they all went back to their preparations and sent her a withering glare before turning back to her mess of a locker.</p><p>\u201cNow where is that other guard?\u201d She pulled out a leaf and shrugged. Gendry, already dressed in his keeper\u2019s helmet and pads, reached past her to pull the item in question out of the recesses of her locker and dangle it in front of her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d He smirked.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Arya snarked, snatching it from his hands. She slapped it on and grabbed her broom and bat. \u201cLet\u2019s roll.\u201d They joined the other players at the tent flaps and looked out over the pitch. Students from all house filled the stands. Arya quickly scanned the crowd for the rest of her siblings. Sure enough, Rickon and Bran, decked out in red and gold, cheered loudly when they spotted her. Sansa, much more subdued but still loyal to their house, looked quite cozy curled on Jon\u2019s arm. She waved and gave them a big thumbs up. As Arya waved back, she noticed Ygritte glaring at Sansa; Arya\u2019s blood boiled.</p><p>A whistle blew. Coach Tarth, in referee robes, stood in the center of the pitch, gesturing for the teams to come out.</p><p>&ldquo;Welcome, students and teachers,&rdquo; Margaery&rsquo;s best announcer voice echoed across the stadium as both teams entered the field &ldquo;to today'a match. Gryffindor, lead by seventh-year Robb Stark, faces off against Slytherin, captained by seventh-year Ramsay Bolton. Robb is joined on Gryffindor by Ygritte Wild, Harry Hardyng, Alys Karstark, Gendry Waters, Smalljon Umber and Arya Stark.\u201d Arya gave a wave to the roaring crowd when Margaery said her name. \u201cRamsay is joined by Joffrey Baratheon, Myranda Kennel, Elinor Tyrell, Little Walder Frey, Big Walder Frey, and Elmar Frey.\u201d</p><p>The two teams circled around Coach Tarth.</p><p>\u201cAlright, you lot, I want a clean game and no serious injuries. Mount your brooms please.\u201d Arya scrambled to her assigned position on the field and climbed onto her broom.</p><p>The whistle blew, and they were off.</p><hr><p>Arya soared above the pitch to get a better look at the game. For the past two hours, the two houses had been neck and neck. Every time a Gryffindor chaser managed to sink the quaffle through the ring, Slytherin came right back with their own point. She wiped the sweat from her brow. Below, Robb, a blur of red, zipped after Joffrey. They\u2019d spotted the snitch sometime after the first half hour but managed to lose it in the ensuing scuffle. A red-headed speck that Arya assumed was Alys had possession of the quaffle. She dodged a bludger before lobbing the quaffle through a hoop. The faint sounds of cheering and Margaery\u2019s magnified voice echoed over the stadium. \u201cThat\u2019s another ten points for Gryffindor, bringing the score up to 120 v. 120.\u201d Joffrey suddenly veered off in a different direction, with Robb following close behind. They had spotted the snitch again.</p><p>\u201cSeven help me,\u201d Arya muttered before dropping back into the fray. The air rushed past her as she fell, whipping her ponytail into her face until she kicked on the brakes, landing right in the middle of the action. The snitch zipped past her ear.</p><p>&quot;Out of the way, Stark bench.&rdquo; Joffrey elbowed her as he zipped past, sending her spinning. She braked in time to see Robb zoom after his rival. On her other side, Elinor rocketed by holding the quaffle, dogged by the other chasers as she headed straight for the center hoop.</p><p>\u201cTyrell\u2019s on her way to the goalpost and Joffrey\u2019s gaining on the snitch, with Robb hot on his tail. Unless Gryffindor can pull a miracle, it looks like it\u2019s Slytherin\u2019s game.\u201d</p><p>&ldquo;Drat,&rdquo; Arya cursed. In no way could she stop Joffrey and prevent Elinor from scoring at the same time. She didn&rsquo;t even have a bludger to hit. She squinted down the field at Smalljon before signaling him. He sent a bludger careening down the pitch. In the split second before the bludger arrived, she glanced once more at the Goalposts at the end of the field. Gendry nodded. Arya knew what she had to do.</p><p>As the bludger rushed toward her, she readied herself, twirling the bat handle to find the right grip. With all her might, she swung at the approaching ball, sending it ricocheting off the bat straight toward Joffrey. The force of her swing knocked her back a meter. She glanced back at the goalpost where Elinor readied to toss in the quaffle. Time almost seemed to slow down as the Quaffle soared through the air toward the empty hoop and Joffrey reached for the snitch. Arya held her breath. Gendry zoomed in from the side to block the shot with his broom as the bludger smacked into Joffrey&rsquo;s shoulder with a sickening crack that she heard all the way across the field. The bludger snapped back, sailing into the group of chasers crowded around the goal. It smacked Ygritte in the face. Arya laughed; it served her right.</p><p>Arya turned back to the seekers. As Joffrey crumpled and almost fell off his broom, the crowd roared behind her. Robb soared past Joffrey, stretching his fingers past the edge of the broom until they closed around the snitch. Arya let out her breath and sighed in relief.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe this!\u201d Margaery shouted into her microphone as Robb brandished the snitch on a victory lap. \u201cRobb Stark\u2019s caught the snitch! Gryffindor wins!\u201d Arya took a deep breath before diving to join the rest of her celebrating team on the ground. Ygritte was still rubbing her face where the bludger left a red indent.</p><p>\u201cWe did it!\u201d She shouted with a wide grin as she alighted on the grass and ran to Gendry. He dropped his broom when she vaulted into his arms. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we did it!\u201d She giggled as he twirled her around before setting her down.</p><p>\u201cGood call, Stark,\u201d Smalljon pounded her fist.</p><p>Robb finally alighted on the pitch, still holding the winning snitch. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of all of you,\u201d He pulled her into a side hug, \u201cespecially you two.\u201d Arya beamed at Gendry on her other side. \u201cWhat a play!\u201d</p><p>&ldquo;It was a team effort,&rdquo; Arya smirked.</p><p>\u201cNevertheless, you did a fantastic job.\u201d Robb ruffled her hair. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s wash up before the party that they\u2019re definitely not throwing for us in the common room tonight.\u201d</p><hr><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get more butterbeer; do you want any? \u201d Gendry asked over the din of the crowd.</p><p>\u201cNope, I\u2019m good,\u201d Arya glanced down at her mostly full mug. \u201cDon\u2019t take too long, though. You know I can\u2019t stand half the people here.\u201d She scanned the crowd and smirked. Ygritte\u2019s bruise from the bludger was starting to purple through her makeup.</p><p>\u201c I promise,\u201d Gendry winked as he turned. \u201cMilady.\u201d He plunged into the crowd with a salute.</p><p>\u201cIdiot,\u201d Arya grumbled, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d a voice came from over her shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s got it so bad for you.\u201d</p><p>Arya whirled.</p><p>Well, as much as she could without bumping into someone in the crowded Common Room. Jon\u2019s Aunt Daenerys stood behind her sipping Pumpkin Juice out of a cauldron mug.</p><p>\u201cBy the Old Gods, Dany! And they say I\u2019m the sneaky one. How did you get in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother and sister invited me,\u201d she explained with a wave of her hand. With her regal air, speaking to Daenerys was always like talking to a Queen. An easily excitable Queen, but a queen nonetheless. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you can be so unmoved by his obvious affection. I probably would have swooned in your position.\u201d She craned her neck, searching for someone in the crowd.</p><p>\u201cWhat on Earth are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Daenerys looked at her like she had sprouted two heads.</p><p>\u201cGendry, of course. He\u2019s clearly besotted with you.\u201d</p><p>Arya spat out her butterbeer.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d Arya choked out through bursts of laughter.\u201d\u2014believe\u2014you would even\u2014think that.\u201d She wiped a tear from her eye.</p><p>\u201cSo you really think that he doesn&rsquo;t have feelings for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, he&rsquo;s my best friend; it&rsquo;s crazy to think that.\u201d She let out another giggle.</p><p>\u201cBut he was flirting with you!\u201d</p><p>Arya chortled again. \u201cHe was not flirting with me.\u201d</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, you&rsquo;re clearly the expert on your best friend,&rdquo; Daenerys tossed her hair smugly in a way that indicated she did not believe a single word she had uttered. She glanced out at the crowd again before her eyes widened.&ldquo;Well, that was a nice chat, but I think I see your brother and sister calling me over. Ta-ta for now!&rdquo; Just as quickly as Daenerys had disturbed her thoughts, she had skedaddled away, shimmying through the crowd to join Robb, Sansa, and Jon in front of the fireplace.</p><p>Arya blinked. Where had that come from? Daenerys must clearly be as blind as a bat to think Gendry had any interest in her. She downed the rest of her butterbeer in one swig.</p><p>&ldquo;What was that about?&rdquo; Gendry asked when he finally reappeared at her side, startling her from her reverie.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, nothing. Dany just wanted to discuss some &hellip; girl things.\u201d</p><p>Gendry snorted.</p><p>\u201cAlright then, if you don\u2019t want to tell me.\u201d He winked.</p><p>This was so stupid.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. It was just some stupid idea she had. Anyway, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Arya!&rdquo; Their friend Hot Pie sidled up to them and clapped her on the back. &ldquo;Great play today!&rdquo;</p><p>Arya breathed a sigh of relief. Gendry raised an eyebrow but didn\u2019t press the issue any further.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, man,&rdquo; Arya gave him a side hug, trying to avoid crushing the basket he held in his other hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, I&rsquo;m so late. I was baking these to celebrate your big win.&rdquo; He grinned as he lifted two steaming lion-shaped loaves of bread from the basket. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re not too big on lions, but I figured since you both play for Gryffindor it would be appropriate.&rdquo;</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Arya gasped as she snatched a hot loaf from his hand while Gendry took the other. \u201cYou\u2019ve really outdone yourself. I love it!\u201d The smell of cinnamon and cloves wafted up as she broke her loaf with a satisfying crunch in half to watch the steam rise. \u201cThis smells heavenly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt tastes heavenly,\u201d Gendry moaned with a full mouth.</p><p>Hot Pie beamed.</p><p>She broke off a piece; it almost melted in her mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks so much! Bread this good deserves more butterbeer. Anybody need some?&rdquo;</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d Gendry nodded.</p><p>\u201cI could use a mug,\u201d Hot Pie answered.</p><p>&ldquo;Two Butterbeers coming up; here, hold my bread while I&rsquo;m gone.&rdquo;</p><p>She put the rest of her loaf back into the basket, before diving headlong into the crowd, her own mug in tow. She\u2019d just grab one for Hot Pie up at the keg.</p><p>&ldquo;How did all of these people get in here?&rdquo; she grumbled to herself as she stumbled past a third couple locked in a passionate post-victory embrace. &ldquo;Half of them aren&rsquo;t even in Gryffindor.&rdquo; At last, she arrived in front of the keg of butterbeer next to the cauldron of pumpkin juice. She grabbed an empty tankard from the pile on the table to stick it under the spigot. The butterscotch scent drifted up as the butterbeer flowed into the metal mug.</p><p>\u201cHey sis,\u201d Robb greeted her.</p><p>&ldquo;By the seven!&rdquo; Arya shouted, almost spilling the butterbeer. &ldquo;How can you sneak up on a person in a party?&rdquo; She glared at her brother as she turned the spigot off and switched mugs.</p><p>\u201cPractice,\u201d Robb shrugged. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve been meaning to ask you: what do you think about Gendry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear old gods, why does everyone want to know about Gendry today? We\u2019re just friends.\u201d</p><p>She turned the spout off again.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Robb raised a brow. \u201cThen it doesn\u2019t bother you that he\u2019s talking to Elinor Tyrell right now? I heard she just broke up with Alyn Ambrose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Arya whirled back toward the party. She found her friends back in the corner she had left them in, talking with Elinor. She rocked nervously back in forth of Gendry, twirling a strand of her curly mouse brown hair. \u201cHow did she get in? We just beat her.\u201d</p><p>Elinor said something to Gendry. Arya could hear her giggle from across the room.</p><p>\u201cOh you know, Sansa invited Margaery and Margaery invited her cousin.\u201d</p><p>Gendry flushed pink at something Elinor said, before nodding. Megga squealed and hugged him before flouncing back to her friends.</p><p>\u201cWonder what that was about,\u201d Robb commented. \u201cWell, it shouldn\u2019t matter, since you guys are just friends.\u201d He clapped Arya on the shoulder. \u201cKeep up the good work on the pitch. I\u2019ll see you in the library tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Arya muttered. She grabbed the two full mugs and headed back to her friends, trying to ignore that weird tight feeling in her stomach.</p>",

Robb would kill her if she were late for their most crucial match of the season. They finally had a shot at beating Slytherin since Margaery\u2019s brother Loras had graduated. She slowed her pace as she approached the door that lead to the Gryffindor team tent where they kept their brooms and equipment when she noticed that her boot laces had come untied. As she bent to tie them, she heard Alys\u2019 voice come muffled through the door.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look now, but it looks like Jon\u2019s moved on.\u201d</p><p>Someone muttered unintelligible curse words. Arya heard the soft pitter-patter of footsteps on turf as that person crossed the tent. Arya rose without a sound to peer through the glass pane at the tent. Ygritte and Alys stood at the flap of the tent, staring into the crowd.</p><p>\u201cBy the old gods, I knew he had a thing for that insufferable Ice Queen Stark bench,\u201d Ygritte growled, knuckles white and shaking. Arya clenched the doorknob tightly. \u201cI can\u2019t stand her. She\u2019s probably only after him for the \u2019prestige\u2019,\u201d Ygritte gagged.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Arya muttered to herself. Flushed, she clenched her fist and prepared to storm through the door to give Ygritte the punch in the face she deserved. As she twisted the doorknob, a strong arm wrapped around her waist and yanked her back.</p><p>\u201cOof!\u201d She landed against a broad chest. Smoke wafted over her; she recognized her best friend instantly.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Arya grumbled, struggling to loosen his grip. \u201cLet me go, you stupid bull!\u201d<br></p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cShh!\u201d Gendry shushed her, pointing to the window. Arya glared at him but turned her attention to the girls in the tent</p><p>\u201cWatch your tongue,\u201d Alys barked. \u201cI don\u2019t think Robb or Arya would appreciate you talking that way about their sister. Besides, Sansa\u2019s always been nice to me.\u201d</p><p>Arya relaxed a little as Gendry put her down.</p><p>\u201cThey just make me so angry,\u201d Ygritte responded. \u201cHe should be with me instead of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChannel your aggression into the game,\u201d Alys replied. \u201cLook lively; our fearless captain will be here any minute.\u201d</p><p>Arya turned back to her expectant friend.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you stop me?\u201d She huffed. \u201cYgritte was way out of line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Gendry smirked. \u201cThis game is really important to your brother, and you would have kicked yourself if you ruined it for him. You can get back at Ygritte after we beat Slytherin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am.\u201d Gendry pushed past her to open the door. \u201cAfter you, milady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that,\u201d Arya scowled, walking to her locker to grab the rest of her equipment. In the other corner, Alys ran through some warm-up stretches while Ygritte angrily wrestled with her arm guard. Gendry rushed to his locker to put on his shoulder pads as Arya unlocked hers. Her bat tumbled out as she rummaged through the disorganized pile of stuff. Hand closing around one of her arm guards, she quickly tied it on as Robb burst through the door followed closely by Harry Harding and Smalljon Umber.</p><p>\u201cAlright, look alive people,\u201d Robb bellowed. The team paused to listen to their captain. \u201cI\u2019m not saying this is the most important game of the season, but this is the most important game of the season. Gryffindor hasn\u2019t beaten Slytherin in six years, but we finally have a chance.\u201d The team gathered around him. \u201cJoffrey is a weak seeker, but the team is good at scoring. Arya, Smalljon, I don\u2019t want to see him anywhere near the snitch until we\u2019re ahead. Chasers, you\u2019ve got your work cut out for you, but I believe in you. Let\u2019s go win this! On three.\u201d The team formed a circle and laid their hands on top of his.</p><p>\u201cOne, two, three, Gryffindor!\u201d They shouted. Arya caught Ygritte\u2019s eye as they all went back to their preparations and sent her a withering glare before turning back to her mess of a locker.</p><p>\u201cNow where is that other guard?\u201d She pulled out a leaf and shrugged. Gendry, already dressed in his keeper\u2019s helmet and pads, reached past her to pull the item in question out of the recesses of her locker and dangle it in front of her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d He smirked.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Arya snarked, snatching it from his hands. She slapped it on and grabbed her broom and bat. \u201cLet\u2019s roll.\u201d They joined the other players at the tent flaps and looked out over the pitch. Students from all house filled the stands. Arya quickly scanned the crowd for the rest of her siblings. Sure enough, Rickon and Bran, decked out in red and gold, cheered loudly when they spotted her. Sansa, much more subdued but still loyal to their house, looked quite cozy curled on Jon\u2019s arm. She waved and gave them a big thumbs up. As Arya waved back, she noticed Ygritte glaring at Sansa; Arya\u2019s blood boiled.</p><p>A whistle blew. Coach Tarth, in referee robes, stood in the center of the pitch, gesturing for the teams to come out.</p><p>\u201cWelcome, students and teachers,\u201d Margaery\u2019s best announcer voice echoed across the stadium as both teams entered the field \u201cto today'a match. Gryffindor, lead by seventh-year Robb Stark, faces off against Slytherin, captained by seventh-year Ramsay Bolton. Robb is joined on Gryffindor by Ygritte Wild, Harry Hardyng, Alys Karstark, Gendry Waters, Smalljon Umber and Arya Stark.\u201d Arya gave a wave to the roaring crowd when Margaery said her name. \u201cRamsay is joined by Joffrey Baratheon, Myranda Kennel, Elinor Tyrell, Little Walder Frey, Big Walder Frey, and Elmar Frey.\u201d</p><p>The two teams circled around Coach Tarth.</p><p>\u201cAlright, you lot, I want a clean game and no serious injuries. Mount your brooms please.\u201d Arya scrambled to her assigned position on the field and climbed onto her broom.</p><p>The whistle blew, and they were off.</p><hr><p>Arya soared above the pitch to get a better look at the game. For the past two hours, the two houses had been neck and neck. Every time a Gryffindor chaser managed to sink the quaffle through the ring, Slytherin came right back with their own point. She wiped the sweat from her brow. Below, Robb, a blur of red, zipped after Joffrey. They\u2019d spotted the snitch sometime after the first half hour but managed to lose it in the ensuing scuffle. A red-headed speck that Arya assumed was Alys had possession of the quaffle. She dodged a bludger before lobbing the quaffle through a hoop. The faint sounds of cheering and Margaery\u2019s magnified voice echoed over the stadium. \u201cThat\u2019s another ten points for Gryffindor, bringing the score up to 120 v. 120.\u201d Joffrey suddenly veered off in a different direction, with Robb following close behind. They had spotted the snitch again.</p><p>\u201cSeven help me,\u201d Arya muttered before dropping back into the fray. The air rushed past her as she fell, whipping her ponytail into her face until she kicked on the brakes, landing right in the middle of the action. The snitch zipped past her ear.</p><p>\"Out of the way, Stark bench.\u201d Joffrey elbowed her as he zipped past, sending her spinning. She braked in time to see Robb zoom after his rival. On her other side, Elinor rocketed by holding the quaffle, dogged by the other chasers as she headed straight for the center hoop.</p><p>\u201cTyrell\u2019s on her way to the goalpost and Joffrey\u2019s gaining on the snitch, with Robb hot on his tail. Unless Gryffindor can pull a miracle, it looks like it\u2019s Slytherin\u2019s game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrat,\u201d Arya cursed. In no way could she stop Joffrey and prevent Elinor from scoring at the same time. She didn\u2019t even have a bludger to hit. She squinted down the field at Smalljon before signaling him. He sent a bludger careening down the pitch. In the split second before the bludger arrived, she glanced once more at the Goalposts at the end of the field. Gendry nodded. Arya knew what she had to do.</p><p>As the bludger rushed toward her, she readied herself, twirling the bat handle to find the right grip. With all her might, she swung at the approaching ball, sending it ricocheting off the bat straight toward Joffrey. The force of her swing knocked her back a meter. She glanced back at the goalpost where Elinor readied to toss in the quaffle. Time almost seemed to slow down as the Quaffle soared through the air toward the empty hoop and Joffrey reached for the snitch. Arya held her breath. Gendry zoomed in from the side to block the shot with his broom as the bludger smacked into Joffrey\u2019s shoulder with a sickening crack that she heard all the way across the field. The bludger snapped back, sailing into the group of chasers crowded around the goal. It smacked Ygritte in the face. Arya laughed; it served her right.</p><p>Arya turned back to the seekers. As Joffrey crumpled and almost fell off his broom, the crowd roared behind her. Robb soared past Joffrey, stretching his fingers past the edge of the broom until they closed around the snitch. Arya let out her breath and sighed in relief.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe this!\u201d Margaery shouted into her microphone as Robb brandished the snitch on a victory lap. \u201cRobb Stark\u2019s caught the snitch! Gryffindor wins!\u201d Arya took a deep breath before diving to join the rest of her celebrating team on the ground. Ygritte was still rubbing her face where the bludger left a red indent.</p><p>\u201cWe did it!\u201d She shouted with a wide grin as she alighted on the grass and ran to Gendry. He dropped his broom when she vaulted into his arms. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we did it!\u201d She giggled as he twirled her around before setting her down.</p><p>\u201cGood call, Stark,\u201d Smalljon pounded her fist.</p><p>Robb finally alighted on the pitch, still holding the winning snitch. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of all of you,\u201d He pulled her into a side hug, \u201cespecially you two.\u201d Arya beamed at Gendry on her other side. \u201cWhat a play!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a team effort,\u201d Arya smirked.</p><p>\u201cNevertheless, you did a fantastic job.\u201d Robb ruffled her hair. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s wash up before the party that they\u2019re definitely not throwing for us in the common room tonight.\u201d</p><hr><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get more butterbeer; do you want any? \u201d Gendry asked over the din of the crowd.</p><p>\u201cNope, I\u2019m good,\u201d Arya glanced down at her mostly full mug. \u201cDon\u2019t take too long, though. You know I can\u2019t stand half the people here.\u201d She scanned the crowd and smirked. Ygritte\u2019s bruise from the bludger was starting to purple through her makeup.</p><p>\u201c I promise,\u201d Gendry winked as he turned. \u201cMilady.\u201d He plunged into the crowd with a salute.</p><p>\u201cIdiot,\u201d Arya grumbled, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d a voice came from over her shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s got it so bad for you.\u201d</p><p>Arya whirled.</p><p>Well, as much as she could without bumping into someone in the crowded Common Room. Jon\u2019s Aunt Daenerys stood behind her sipping Pumpkin Juice out of a cauldron mug.</p><p>\u201cBy the Old Gods, Dany! And they say I\u2019m the sneaky one. How did you get in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother and sister invited me,\u201d she explained with a wave of her hand. With her regal air, speaking to Daenerys was always like talking to a Queen. An easily excitable Queen, but a queen nonetheless. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you can be so unmoved by his obvious affection. I probably would have swooned in your position.\u201d She craned her neck, searching for someone in the crowd.</p><p>\u201cWhat on Earth are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Daenerys looked at her like she had sprouted two heads.</p><p>\u201cGendry, of course. He\u2019s clearly besotted with you.\u201d</p><p>Arya spat out her butterbeer.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d Arya choked out through bursts of laughter.\u201d\u2014believe\u2014you would even\u2014think that.\u201d She wiped a tear from her eye.</p><p>\u201cSo you really think that he doesn\u2019t have feelings for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, he\u2019s my best friend; it\u2019s crazy to think that.\u201d She let out another giggle.</p><p>\u201cBut he was flirting with you!\u201d</p><p>Arya chortled again. \u201cHe was not flirting with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, you\u2019re clearly the expert on your best friend,\u201d Daenerys tossed her hair smugly in a way that indicated she did not believe a single word she had uttered. She glanced out at the crowd again before her eyes widened.\u201cWell, that was a nice chat, but I think I see your brother and sister calling me over. Ta-ta for now!\u201d Just as quickly as Daenerys had disturbed her thoughts, she had skedaddled away, shimmying through the crowd to join Robb, Sansa, and Jon in front of the fireplace.</p><p>Arya blinked. Where had that come from? Daenerys must clearly be as blind as a bat to think Gendry had any interest in her. She downed the rest of her butterbeer in one swig.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d Gendry asked when he finally reappeared at her side, startling her from her reverie.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, nothing. Dany just wanted to discuss some \u2026 girl things.\u201d</p><p>Gendry snorted.</p><p>\u201cAlright then, if you don\u2019t want to tell me.\u201d He winked.</p><p>This was so stupid.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. It was just some stupid idea she had. Anyway, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Arya!\u201d Their friend Hot Pie sidled up to them and clapped her on the back. \u201cGreat play today!\u201d</p><p>Arya breathed a sigh of relief. Gendry raised an eyebrow but didn\u2019t press the issue any further.</p><p>\u201cThanks, man,\u201d Arya gave him a side hug, trying to avoid crushing the basket he held in his other hand.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019m so late. I was baking these to celebrate your big win.\u201d He grinned as he lifted two steaming lion-shaped loaves of bread from the basket. \u201cI know you\u2019re not too big on lions, but I figured since you both play for Gryffindor it would be appropriate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Arya gasped as she snatched a hot loaf from his hand while Gendry took the other. \u201cYou\u2019ve really outdone yourself. I love it!\u201d The smell of cinnamon and cloves wafted up as she broke her loaf with a satisfying crunch in half to watch the steam rise. \u201cThis smells heavenly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt tastes heavenly,\u201d Gendry moaned with a full mouth.</p><p>Hot Pie beamed.</p><p>She broke off a piece; it almost melted in her mouth.</p><p>\u201cThanks so much! Bread this good deserves more butterbeer. Anybody need some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d Gendry nodded.</p><p>\u201cI could use a mug,\u201d Hot Pie answered.</p><p>\u201cTwo Butterbeers coming up; here, hold my bread while I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>She put the rest of her loaf back into the basket, before diving headlong into the crowd, her own mug in tow. She\u2019d just grab one for Hot Pie up at the keg.</p><p>\u201cHow did all of these people get in here?\u201d she grumbled to herself as she stumbled past a third couple locked in a passionate post-victory embrace. \u201cHalf of them aren\u2019t even in Gryffindor.\u201d At last, she arrived in front of the keg of butterbeer next to the cauldron of pumpkin juice. She grabbed an empty tankard from the pile on the table to stick it under the spigot. The butterscotch scent drifted up as the butterbeer flowed into the metal mug.</p><p>\u201cHey sis,\u201d Robb greeted her.</p><p>\u201cBy the seven!\u201d Arya shouted, almost spilling the butterbeer. \u201cHow can you sneak up on a person in a party?\u201d She glared at her brother as she turned the spigot off and switched mugs.</p><p>\u201cPractice,\u201d Robb shrugged. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve been meaning to ask you: what do you think about Gendry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear old gods, why does everyone want to know about Gendry today? We\u2019re just friends.\u201d</p><p>She turned the spout off again.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Robb raised a brow. \u201cThen it doesn\u2019t bother you that he\u2019s talking to Elinor Tyrell right now? I heard she just broke up with Alyn Ambrose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Arya whirled back toward the party. She found her friends back in the corner she had left them in, talking with Elinor. She rocked nervously back in forth of Gendry, twirling a strand of her curly mouse brown hair. \u201cHow did she get in? We just beat her.\u201d</p><p>Elinor said something to Gendry. Arya could hear her giggle from across the room.</p><p>\u201cOh you know, Sansa invited Margaery and Margaery invited her cousin.\u201d</p><p>Gendry flushed pink at something Elinor said, before nodding. Megga squealed and hugged him before flouncing back to her friends.</p><p>\u201cWonder what that was about,\u201d Robb commented. \u201cWell, it shouldn\u2019t matter, since you guys are just friends.\u201d He clapped Arya on the shoulder. \u201cKeep up the good work on the pitch. I\u2019ll see you in the library tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Arya muttered. She grabbed the two full mugs and headed back to her friends, trying to ignore that weird tight feeling in her stomach.</p>",

Robb would kill her if she were late for their most crucial match of the season. They finally had a shot at beating Slytherin since Margaery\u2019s brother Loras had graduated. She slowed her pace as she approached the door that lead to the Gryffindor team tent where they kept their brooms and equipment when she noticed that her boot laces had come untied. As she bent to tie them, she heard Alys\u2019 voice come muffled through the door.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look now, but it looks like Jon\u2019s moved on.\u201d</p><p>Someone muttered unintelligible curse words. Arya heard the soft pitter-patter of footsteps on turf as that person crossed the tent. Arya rose without a sound to peer through the glass pane at the tent. Ygritte and Alys stood at the flap of the tent, staring into the crowd.</p><p>\u201cBy the old gods, I knew he had a thing for that insufferable Ice Queen Stark bench,\u201d Ygritte growled, knuckles white and shaking. Arya clenched the doorknob tightly. \u201cI can\u2019t stand her. She\u2019s probably only after him for the \u2019prestige\u2019,\u201d Ygritte gagged.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Arya muttered to herself. Flushed, she clenched her fist and prepared to storm through the door to give Ygritte the punch in the face she deserved. As she twisted the doorknob, a strong arm wrapped around her waist and yanked her back.</p><p>\u201cOof!\u201d She landed against a broad chest. Smoke wafted over her; she recognized her best friend instantly.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Arya grumbled, struggling to loosen his grip. \u201cLet me go, you stupid bull!\u201d<br></p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cShh!\u201d Gendry shushed her, pointing to the window. Arya glared at him but turned her attention to the girls in the tent</p><p>\u201cWatch your tongue,\u201d Alys barked. \u201cI don\u2019t think Robb or Arya would appreciate you talking that way about their sister. Besides, Sansa\u2019s always been nice to me.\u201d</p><p>Arya relaxed a little as Gendry put her down.</p><p>\u201cThey just make me so angry,\u201d Ygritte responded. \u201cHe should be with me instead of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChannel your aggression into the game,\u201d Alys replied. \u201cLook lively; our fearless captain will be here any minute.\u201d</p><p>Arya turned back to her expectant friend.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you stop me?\u201d She huffed. \u201cYgritte was way out of line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Gendry smirked. \u201cThis game is really important to your brother, and you would have kicked yourself if you ruined it for him. You can get back at Ygritte after we beat Slytherin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am.\u201d Gendry pushed past her to open the door. \u201cAfter you, milady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that,\u201d Arya scowled, walking to her locker to grab the rest of her equipment. In the other corner, Alys ran through some warm-up stretches while Ygritte angrily wrestled with her arm guard. Gendry rushed to his locker to put on his shoulder pads as Arya unlocked hers. Her bat tumbled out as she rummaged through the disorganized pile of stuff. Hand closing around one of her arm guards, she quickly tied it on as Robb burst through the door followed closely by Harry Harding and Smalljon Umber.</p><p>\u201cAlright, look alive people,\u201d Robb bellowed. The team paused to listen to their captain. \u201cI\u2019m not saying this is the most important game of the season, but this is the most important game of the season. Gryffindor hasn\u2019t beaten Slytherin in six years, but we finally have a chance.\u201d The team gathered around him. \u201cJoffrey is a weak seeker, but the team is good at scoring. Arya, Smalljon, I don\u2019t want to see him anywhere near the snitch until we\u2019re ahead. Chasers, you\u2019ve got your work cut out for you, but I believe in you. Let\u2019s go win this! On three.\u201d The team formed a circle and laid their hands on top of his.</p><p>\u201cOne, two, three, Gryffindor!\u201d They shouted. Arya caught Ygritte\u2019s eye as they all went back to their preparations and sent her a withering glare before turning back to her mess of a locker.</p><p>\u201cNow where is that other guard?\u201d She pulled out a leaf and shrugged. Gendry, already dressed in his keeper\u2019s helmet and pads, reached past her to pull the item in question out of the recesses of her locker and dangle it in front of her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d He smirked.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Arya snarked, snatching it from his hands. She slapped it on and grabbed her broom and bat. \u201cLet\u2019s roll.\u201d They joined the other players at the tent flaps and looked out over the pitch. Students from all house filled the stands. Arya quickly scanned the crowd for the rest of her siblings. Sure enough, Rickon and Bran, decked out in red and gold, cheered loudly when they spotted her. Sansa, much more subdued but still loyal to their house, looked quite cozy curled on Jon\u2019s arm. She waved and gave them a big thumbs up. As Arya waved back, she noticed Ygritte glaring at Sansa; Arya\u2019s blood boiled.</p><p>A whistle blew. Coach Tarth, in referee robes, stood in the center of the pitch, gesturing for the teams to come out.</p><p>\u201cWelcome, students and teachers,\u201d Margaery\u2019s best announcer voice echoed across the stadium as both teams entered the field \u201cto today'a match. Gryffindor, lead by seventh-year Robb Stark, faces off against Slytherin, captained by seventh-year Ramsay Bolton. Robb is joined on Gryffindor by Ygritte Wild, Harry Hardyng, Alys Karstark, Gendry Waters, Smalljon Umber and Arya Stark.\u201d Arya gave a wave to the roaring crowd when Margaery said her name. \u201cRamsay is joined by Joffrey Baratheon, Myranda Kennel, Elinor Tyrell, Little Walder Frey, Big Walder Frey, and Elmar Frey.\u201d</p><p>The two teams circled around Coach Tarth.</p><p>\u201cAlright, you lot, I want a clean game and no serious injuries. Mount your brooms please.\u201d Arya scrambled to her assigned position on the field and climbed onto her broom.</p><p>The whistle blew, and they were off.</p><hr><p>Arya soared above the pitch to get a better look at the game. For the past two hours, the two houses had been neck and neck. Every time a Gryffindor chaser managed to sink the quaffle through the ring, Slytherin came right back with their own point. She wiped the sweat from her brow. Below, Robb, a blur of red, zipped after Joffrey. They\u2019d spotted the snitch sometime after the first half hour but managed to lose it in the ensuing scuffle. A red-headed speck that Arya assumed was Alys had possession of the quaffle. She dodged a bludger before lobbing the quaffle through a hoop. The faint sounds of cheering and Margaery\u2019s magnified voice echoed over the stadium. \u201cThat\u2019s another ten points for Gryffindor, bringing the score up to 120 v. 120.\u201d Joffrey suddenly veered off in a different direction, with Robb following close behind. They had spotted the snitch again.</p><p>\u201cSeven help me,\u201d Arya muttered before dropping back into the fray. The air rushed past her as she fell, whipping her ponytail into her face until she kicked on the brakes, landing right in the middle of the action. The snitch zipped past her ear.</p><p>\"Out of the way, Stark bench.\u201d Joffrey elbowed her as he zipped past, sending her spinning. She braked in time to see Robb zoom after his rival. On her other side, Elinor rocketed by holding the quaffle, dogged by the other chasers as she headed straight for the center hoop.</p><p>\u201cTyrell\u2019s on her way to the goalpost and Joffrey\u2019s gaining on the snitch, with Robb hot on his tail. Unless Gryffindor can pull a miracle, it looks like it\u2019s Slytherin\u2019s game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrat,\u201d Arya cursed. In no way could she stop Joffrey and prevent Elinor from scoring at the same time. She didn\u2019t even have a bludger to hit. She squinted down the field at Smalljon before signaling him. He sent a bludger careening down the pitch. In the split second before the bludger arrived, she glanced once more at the Goalposts at the end of the field. Gendry nodded. Arya knew what she had to do.</p><p>As the bludger rushed toward her, she readied herself, twirling the bat handle to find the right grip. With all her might, she swung at the approaching ball, sending it ricocheting off the bat straight toward Joffrey. The force of her swing knocked her back a meter. She glanced back at the goalpost where Elinor readied to toss in the quaffle. Time almost seemed to slow down as the Quaffle soared through the air toward the empty hoop and Joffrey reached for the snitch. Arya held her breath. Gendry zoomed in from the side to block the shot with his broom as the bludger smacked into Joffrey\u2019s shoulder with a sickening crack that she heard all the way across the field. The bludger snapped back, sailing into the group of chasers crowded around the goal. It smacked Ygritte in the face. Arya laughed; it served her right.</p><p>Arya turned back to the seekers. As Joffrey crumpled and almost fell off his broom, the crowd roared behind her. Robb soared past Joffrey, stretching his fingers past the edge of the broom until they closed around the snitch. Arya let out her breath and sighed in relief.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe this!\u201d Margaery shouted into her microphone as Robb brandished the snitch on a victory lap. \u201cRobb Stark\u2019s caught the snitch! Gryffindor wins!\u201d Arya took a deep breath before diving to join the rest of her celebrating team on the ground. Ygritte was still rubbing her face where the bludger left a red indent.</p><p>\u201cWe did it!\u201d She shouted with a wide grin as she alighted on the grass and ran to Gendry. He dropped his broom when she vaulted into his arms. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we did it!\u201d She giggled as he twirled her around before setting her down.</p><p>\u201cGood call, Stark,\u201d Smalljon pounded her fist.</p><p>Robb finally alighted on the pitch, still holding the winning snitch. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of all of you,\u201d He pulled her into a side hug, \u201cespecially you two.\u201d Arya beamed at Gendry on her other side. \u201cWhat a play!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a team effort,\u201d Arya smirked.</p><p>\u201cNevertheless, you did a fantastic job.\u201d Robb ruffled her hair. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s wash up before the party that they\u2019re definitely not throwing for us in the common room tonight.\u201d</p><hr><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get more butterbeer; do you want any? \u201d Gendry asked over the din of the crowd.</p><p>\u201cNope, I\u2019m good,\u201d Arya glanced down at her mostly full mug. \u201cDon\u2019t take too long, though. You know I can\u2019t stand half the people here.\u201d She scanned the crowd and smirked. Ygritte\u2019s bruise from the bludger was starting to purple through her makeup.</p><p>\u201c I promise,\u201d Gendry winked as he turned. \u201cMilady.\u201d He plunged into the crowd with a salute.</p><p>\u201cIdiot,\u201d Arya grumbled, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d a voice came from over her shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s got it so bad for you.\u201d</p><p>Arya whirled.</p><p>Well, as much as she could without bumping into someone in the crowded Common Room. Jon\u2019s Aunt Daenerys stood behind her sipping Pumpkin Juice out of a cauldron mug.</p><p>\u201cBy the Old Gods, Dany! And they say I\u2019m the sneaky one. How did you get in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother and sister invited me,\u201d she explained with a wave of her hand. With her regal air, speaking to Daenerys was always like talking to a Queen. An easily excitable Queen, but a queen nonetheless. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you can be so unmoved by his obvious affection. I probably would have swooned in your position.\u201d She craned her neck, searching for someone in the crowd.</p><p>\u201cWhat on Earth are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Daenerys looked at her like she had sprouted two heads.</p><p>\u201cGendry, of course. He\u2019s clearly besotted with you.\u201d</p><p>Arya spat out her butterbeer.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d Arya choked out through bursts of laughter.\u201d\u2014believe\u2014you would even\u2014think that.\u201d She wiped a tear from her eye.</p><p>\u201cSo you really think that he doesn\u2019t have feelings for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, he\u2019s my best friend; it\u2019s crazy to think that.\u201d She let out another giggle.</p><p>\u201cBut he was flirting with you!\u201d</p><p>Arya chortled again. \u201cHe was not flirting with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, you\u2019re clearly the expert on your best friend,\u201d Daenerys tossed her hair smugly in a way that indicated she did not believe a single word she had uttered. She glanced out at the crowd again before her eyes widened.\u201cWell, that was a nice chat, but I think I see your brother and sister calling me over. Ta-ta for now!\u201d Just as quickly as Daenerys had disturbed her thoughts, she had skedaddled away, shimmying through the crowd to join Robb, Sansa, and Jon in front of the fireplace.</p><p>Arya blinked. Where had that come from? Daenerys must clearly be as blind as a bat to think Gendry had any interest in her. She downed the rest of her butterbeer in one swig.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d Gendry asked when he finally reappeared at her side, startling her from her reverie.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, nothing. Dany just wanted to discuss some \u2026 girl things.\u201d</p><p>Gendry snorted.</p><p>\u201cAlright then, if you don\u2019t want to tell me.\u201d He winked.</p><p>This was so stupid.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. It was just some stupid idea she had. Anyway, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Arya!\u201d Their friend Hot Pie sidled up to them and clapped her on the back. \u201cGreat play today!\u201d</p><p>Arya breathed a sigh of relief. Gendry raised an eyebrow but didn\u2019t press the issue any further.</p><p>\u201cThanks, man,\u201d Arya gave him a side hug, trying to avoid crushing the basket he held in his other hand.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019m so late. I was baking these to celebrate your big win.\u201d He grinned as he lifted two steaming lion-shaped loaves of bread from the basket. \u201cI know you\u2019re not too big on lions, but I figured since you both play for Gryffindor it would be appropriate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Arya gasped as she snatched a hot loaf from his hand while Gendry took the other. \u201cYou\u2019ve really outdone yourself. I love it!\u201d The smell of cinnamon and cloves wafted up as she broke her loaf with a satisfying crunch in half to watch the steam rise. \u201cThis smells heavenly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt tastes heavenly,\u201d Gendry moaned with a full mouth.</p><p>Hot Pie beamed.</p><p>She broke off a piece; it almost melted in her mouth.</p><p>\u201cThanks so much! Bread this good deserves more butterbeer. Anybody need some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d Gendry nodded.</p><p>\u201cI could use a mug,\u201d Hot Pie answered.</p><p>\u201cTwo Butterbeers coming up; here, hold my bread while I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>She put the rest of her loaf back into the basket, before diving headlong into the crowd, her own mug in tow. She\u2019d just grab one for Hot Pie up at the keg.</p><p>\u201cHow did all of these people get in here?\u201d she grumbled to herself as she stumbled past a third couple locked in a passionate post-victory embrace. \u201cHalf of them aren\u2019t even in Gryffindor.\u201d At last, she arrived in front of the keg of butterbeer next to the cauldron of pumpkin juice. She grabbed an empty tankard from the pile on the table to stick it under the spigot. The butterscotch scent drifted up as the butterbeer flowed into the metal mug.</p><p>\u201cHey sis,\u201d Robb greeted her.</p><p>\u201cBy the seven!\u201d Arya shouted, almost spilling the butterbeer. \u201cHow can you sneak up on a person in a party?\u201d She glared at her brother as she turned the spigot off and switched mugs.</p><p>\u201cPractice,\u201d Robb shrugged. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve been meaning to ask you: what do you think about Gendry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear old gods, why does everyone want to know about Gendry today? We\u2019re just friends.\u201d</p><p>She turned the spout off again.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Robb raised a brow. \u201cThen it doesn\u2019t bother you that he\u2019s talking to Elinor Tyrell right now? I heard she just broke up with Alyn Ambrose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Arya whirled back toward the party. She found her friends back in the corner she had left them in, talking with Elinor. She rocked nervously back in forth of Gendry, twirling a strand of her curly mouse brown hair. \u201cHow did she get in? We just beat her.\u201d</p><p>Elinor said something to Gendry. Arya could hear her giggle from across the room.</p><p>\u201cOh you know, Sansa invited Margaery and Margaery invited her cousin.\u201d</p><p>Gendry flushed pink at something Elinor said, before nodding. Megga squealed and hugged him before flouncing back to her friends.</p><p>\u201cWonder what that was about,\u201d Robb commented. \u201cWell, it shouldn\u2019t matter, since you guys are just friends.\u201d He clapped Arya on the shoulder. \u201cKeep up the good work on the pitch. I\u2019ll see you in the library tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Arya muttered. She grabbed the two full mugs and headed back to her friends, trying to ignore that weird tight feeling in her stomach.</p>",

Gryffindor, lead by seventh-year Robb Stark, faces off against Slytherin, captained by seventh-year Ramsay Bolton. Robb is joined on Gryffindor by Ygritte Wild, Harry Hardyng, Alys Karstark, Gendry Waters, Smalljon Umber and Arya Stark.&rdquo; Arya gave a wave to the roaring crowd when Margaery said her name. &ldquo;Ramsay is joined by Joffrey Baratheon, Myranda Kennel, Elinor Tyrell, Little Walder Frey, Big Walder Frey, and Elmar Frey.&rdquo;</p><p>The two teams circled around Coach Tarth.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, you lot, I want a clean game and no serious injuries. Mount your brooms please.&rdquo; Arya scrambled to her assigned position on the field and climbed onto her broom.</p><p>The whistle blew, and they were off.</p><hr /><p>Arya soared above the pitch to get a better look at the game. For the past two hours, the two houses had been neck and neck. Every time a Gryffindor chaser managed to sink the quaffle through the ring, Slytherin came right back with their own point. She wiped the sweat from her brow. Below, Robb, a blur of red, zipped after Joffrey. They&rsquo;d spotted the snitch sometime after the first half hour but managed to lose it in the ensuing scuffle. A red-headed speck that Arya assumed was Alys had possession of the quaffle. She dodged a bludger before lobbing the quaffle through a hoop. The faint sounds of cheering and Margaery&rsquo;s magnified voice echoed over the stadium. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s another ten points for Gryffindor, bringing the score up to 120 v. 120.&rdquo; Joffrey suddenly veered off in a different direction, with Robb following close behind. They had spotted the snitch again.</p><p>&ldquo;Seven help me,&rdquo; Arya muttered before dropping back into the fray. The air rushed past her as she fell, whipping her ponytail into her face until she kicked on the brakes, landing right in the middle of the action. The snitch zipped past her ear.</p><p>\"Out of the way, Stark bench.&rdquo; Joffrey elbowed her as he zipped past, sending her spinning. She braked in time to see Robb zoom after his rival. On her other side, Elinor rocketed by holding the quaffle, dogged by the other chasers as she headed straight for the center hoop.</p><p>&ldquo;Tyrell&rsquo;s on her way to the goalpost and Joffrey&rsquo;s gaining on the snitch, with Robb hot on his tail. Unless Gryffindor can pull a miracle, it looks like it&rsquo;s Slytherin&rsquo;s game.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Drat,&rdquo; Arya cursed. In no way could she stop Joffrey and prevent Elinor from scoring at the same time. She didn&rsquo;t even have a bludger to hit. She squinted down the field at Smalljon before signaling him. He sent a bludger careening down the pitch. In the split second before the bludger arrived, she glanced once more at the Goalposts at the end of the field. Gendry nodded. Arya knew what she had to do.</p><p>As the bludger rushed toward her, she readied herself, twirling the bat handle to find the right grip. With all her might, she swung at the approaching ball, sending it ricocheting off the bat straight toward Joffrey. The force of her swing knocked her back a meter. She glanced back at the goalpost where Elinor readied to toss in the quaffle. Time almost seemed to slow down as the Quaffle soared through the air toward the empty hoop and Joffrey reached for the snitch. Arya held her breath. Gendry zoomed in from the side to block the shot with his broom as the bludger smacked into Joffrey&rsquo;s shoulder with a sickening crack that she heard all the way across the field. The bludger snapped back, sailing into the group of chasers crowded around the goal. It smacked Ygritte in the face. Arya laughed; it served her right.</p><p>Arya turned back to the seekers. As Joffrey crumpled and almost fell off his broom, the crowd roared behind her. Robb soared past Joffrey, stretching his fingers past the edge of the broom until they closed around the snitch. Arya let out her breath and sighed in relief.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe this!&rdquo; Margaery shouted into her microphone as Robb brandished the snitch on a victory lap. &ldquo;Robb Stark&rsquo;s caught the snitch! Gryffindor wins!&rdquo; Arya took a deep breath before diving to join the rest of her celebrating team on the ground. Ygritte was still rubbing her face where the bludger left a red indent.</p><p>&ldquo;We did it!&rdquo; She shouted with a wide grin as she alighted on the grass and ran to Gendry. He dropped his broom when she vaulted into his arms. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe we did it!&rdquo; She giggled as he twirled her around before setting her down.</p><p>&ldquo;Good call, Stark,&rdquo; Smalljon pounded her fist.</p><p>Robb finally alighted on the pitch, still holding the winning snitch. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so proud of all of you,&rdquo; He pulled her into a side hug, &ldquo;especially you two.&rdquo; Arya beamed at Gendry on her other side. &ldquo;What a play!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was a team effort,&rdquo; Arya smirked.</p><p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, you did a fantastic job.&rdquo; Robb ruffled her hair. &ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s wash up before the party that they&rsquo;re definitely not throwing for us in the common room tonight.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get more butterbeer; do you want any? &rdquo; Gendry asked over the din of the crowd.</p><p>&ldquo;Nope, I&rsquo;m good,&rdquo; Arya glanced down at her mostly full mug. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take too long, though. You know I can&rsquo;t stand half the people here.&rdquo; She scanned the crowd and smirked. Ygritte&rsquo;s bruise from the bludger was starting to purple through her makeup.</p><p>&ldquo; I promise,&rdquo; Gendry winked as he turned. &ldquo;Milady.&rdquo; He plunged into the crowd with a salute.</p><p>&ldquo;Idiot,&rdquo; Arya grumbled, shaking her head.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; a voice came from over her shoulder. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got it so bad for you.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya whirled.</p><p>Well, as much as she could without bumping into someone in the crowded Common Room. Jon&rsquo;s Aunt Daenerys stood behind her sipping Pumpkin Juice out of a cauldron mug.</p><p>&ldquo;By the Old Gods, Dany! And they say I&rsquo;m the sneaky one. How did you get in here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your brother and sister invited me,&rdquo; she explained with a wave of her hand. With her regal air, speaking to Daenerys was always like talking to a Queen. An easily excitable Queen, but a queen nonetheless. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you can be so unmoved by his obvious affection. I probably would have swooned in your position.&rdquo; She craned her neck, searching for someone in the crowd.</p><p>&ldquo;What on Earth are you talking about?&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys looked at her like she had sprouted two heads.</p><p>&ldquo;Gendry, of course. He&rsquo;s clearly besotted with you.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya spat out her butterbeer.</p><p>&ldquo;What? I can&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; Arya choked out through bursts of laughter.&rdquo;&mdash;believe&mdash;you would even&mdash;think that.&rdquo; She wiped a tear from her eye.</p><p>&ldquo;So you really think that he doesn&rsquo;t have feelings for you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nope, he&rsquo;s my best friend; it&rsquo;s crazy to think that.&rdquo; She let out another giggle.</p><p>&ldquo;But he was flirting with you!&rdquo;</p><p>Arya chortled again. &ldquo;He was not flirting with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, you&rsquo;re clearly the expert on your best friend,&rdquo; Daenerys tossed her hair smugly in a way that indicated she did not believe a single word she had uttered. She glanced out at the crowd again before her eyes widened.&ldquo;Well, that was a nice chat, but I think I see your brother and sister calling me over. Ta-ta for now!&rdquo; Just as quickly as Daenerys had disturbed her thoughts, she had skedaddled away, shimmying through the crowd to join Robb, Sansa, and Jon in front of the fireplace.</p><p>Arya blinked. Where had that come from? Daenerys must clearly be as blind as a bat to think Gendry had any interest in her. She downed the rest of her butterbeer in one swig.</p><p>&ldquo;What was that about?&rdquo; Gendry asked when he finally reappeared at her side, startling her from her reverie.</p><p>&ldquo;What? Oh, nothing. Dany just wanted to discuss some &hellip; girl things.&rdquo;</p><p>Gendry snorted.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright then, if you don&rsquo;t want to tell me.&rdquo; He winked.</p><p>This was so stupid.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it. It was just some stupid idea she had. Anyway, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Arya!&rdquo; Their friend Hot Pie sidled up to them and clapped her on the back. &ldquo;Great play today!&rdquo;</p><p>Arya breathed a sigh of relief. Gendry raised an eyebrow but didn&rsquo;t press the issue any further.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, man,&rdquo; Arya gave him a side hug, trying to avoid crushing the basket he held in his other hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, I&rsquo;m so late. I was baking these to celebrate your big win.&rdquo; He grinned as he lifted two steaming lion-shaped loaves of bread from the basket. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re not too big on lions, but I figured since you both play for Gryffindor it would be appropriate.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; Arya gasped as she snatched a hot loaf from his hand while Gendry took the other. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve really outdone yourself. I love it!&rdquo; The smell of cinnamon and cloves wafted up as she broke her loaf with a satisfying crunch in half to watch the steam rise. &ldquo;This smells heavenly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It tastes heavenly,&rdquo; Gendry moaned with a full mouth.</p><p>Hot Pie beamed.</p><p>She broke off a piece; it almost melted in her mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks so much! Bread this good deserves more butterbeer. Anybody need some?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m good.&rdquo; Gendry nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;I could use a mug,&rdquo; Hot Pie answered.</p><p>&ldquo;Two Butterbeers coming up; here, hold my bread while I&rsquo;m gone.&rdquo;</p><p>She put the rest of her loaf back into the basket, before diving headlong into the crowd, her own mug in tow. She&rsquo;d just grab one for Hot Pie up at the keg.</p><p>&ldquo;How did all of these people get in here?&rdquo; she grumbled to herself as she stumbled past a third couple locked in a passionate post-victory embrace. &ldquo;Half of them aren&rsquo;t even in Gryffindor.&rdquo; At last, she arrived in front of the keg of butterbeer next to the cauldron of pumpkin juice. She grabbed an empty tankard from the pile on the table to stick it under the spigot. The butterscotch scent drifted up as the butterbeer flowed into the metal mug.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey sis,&rdquo; Robb greeted her.</p><p>&ldquo;By the seven!&rdquo; Arya shouted, almost spilling the butterbeer. &ldquo;How can you sneak up on a person in a party?&rdquo; She glared at her brother as she turned the spigot off and switched mugs.</p><p>&ldquo;Practice,&rdquo; Robb shrugged. &ldquo;So, I&rsquo;ve been meaning to ask you: what do you think about Gendry?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dear old gods, why does everyone want to know about Gendry today? We&rsquo;re just friends.&rdquo;</p><p>She turned the spout off again.</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Robb raised a brow. &ldquo;Then it doesn&rsquo;t bother you that he&rsquo;s talking to Elinor Tyrell right now? I heard she just broke up with Alyn Ambrose.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Arya whirled back toward the party. She found her friends back in the corner she had left them in, talking with Elinor. She rocked nervously back in forth of Gendry, twirling a strand of her curly mouse brown hair. &ldquo;How did she get in? We just beat her.&rdquo;</p><p>Elinor said something to Gendry. Arya could hear her giggle from across the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh you know, Sansa invited Margaery and Margaery invited her cousin.&rdquo;</p><p>Gendry flushed pink at something Elinor said, before nodding. Megga squealed and hugged him before flouncing back to her friends.</p><p>&ldquo;Wonder what that was about,&rdquo; Robb commented. &ldquo;Well, it shouldn&rsquo;t matter, since you guys are just friends.&rdquo; He clapped Arya on the shoulder. &ldquo;Keep up the good work on the pitch. I&rsquo;ll see you in the library tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Arya muttered. She grabbed the two full mugs and headed back to her friends, trying to ignore that weird tight feeling in her stomach.</p>",

Robb would kill her if she were late for their most crucial match of the season. They finally had a shot at beating Slytherin since Margaery&rsquo;s brother Loras had graduated. She slowed her pace as she approached the door that lead to the Gryffindor team tent where they kept their brooms and equipment when she noticed that her boot laces had come untied. As she bent to tie them, she heard Alys&rsquo; voice come muffled through the door.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look now, but it looks like Jon&rsquo;s moved on.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Someone muttered unintelligible curse words. Arya heard the soft pitter-patter of footsteps on turf as that person crossed the tent. Arya rose without a sound to peer through the glass pane at the tent. Ygritte and Alys stood at the flap of the tent, staring into the crowd.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;By the old gods, I knew he had a thing for that insufferable Ice Queen Stark bench,&rdquo; Ygritte growled, knuckles white and shaking. Arya clenched the doorknob tightly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand her. She&rsquo;s probably only after him for the &rsquo;prestige&rsquo;,&rdquo; Ygritte gagged.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; Arya muttered to herself. Flushed, she clenched her fist and prepared to storm through the door to give Ygritte the punch in the face she deserved. As she twisted the doorknob, a strong arm wrapped around her waist and yanked her back.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oof!&rdquo; She landed against a broad chest. Smoke wafted over her; she recognized her best friend instantly.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Arya grumbled, struggling to loosen his grip. &ldquo;Let me go, you stupid bull!&rdquo;<br /></p>\n</p>",
