And then get exactly what he wanted. Like what the fuck?!</p><p>Bakugou was strong enough to say &lsquo;no&rsquo;. Shout it even. Repeat it again and again and again until it got engraved over his moronic forehead. He was good at this, did it every day, with anyone.</p><p>Anyone that wasn&rsquo;t Deku, of course.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not decorating the entire house,&rdquo; were his words every single time Deku asked. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give a rat&rsquo;s ass if it&rsquo;s Christmas or not, I don&rsquo;t need or want to waste time putting up things all over the goddamn flat only to waste even more time taking them down.&rdquo; All rough words, all clear. Should&rsquo;ve sent the message across but, judging what followed next, wasn&rsquo;t the case.</p><p>&ldquo;But, Kacchan, it&rsquo;ll just be a tree. Please&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Big eyes, green and shiny and pleading, hoping and waiting for Bakugou to give in.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give me that shit, Deku. Why the hell would we even need a tree?&rdquo; They were both in the hallway, fully dressed in their hero costumes, ready to go. Someone was in danger a few streets away from them and here they were, proper, licensed heroes, talking about freaking decorations.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s traditional. Besides, everyone will have one.&rdquo; A short pause before he moved his eyes to the floor and his smile turned into that curve of insecurity and awkwardness that Bakugou could not stand. &ldquo;And&hellip;I thought\u00a0 it would be nice to have one as well&rdquo;</p><p>He hated that look. Despised seeing Deku make himself smaller instead of looking right up into Bakugou&rsquo;s eyes, shouting and demanding loud and clear what he felt like he deserved. He wasn&rsquo;t a kid anymore. He wasn&rsquo;t Bakugou&rsquo;s inferior like, maybe once, they felt he was. He was a hero in his own right and he was strong. Incredibly so. If he could stand up against an army of villains, he sure as hell could stand up for himself in front of Bakugou for some stupid tree.</p><p>Not that Bakugou would make things easier for him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what the others are doing. This is my flat.&rdquo;</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t a fight, just a mere discussion. It was constructive - for both of them, it always was. They stopped fighting for real, leaving all that toxicity in the past.</p><p>&ldquo;This is also my flat and I want a Christmas tree, Kacchan,&rdquo; replied Izuku, his eyes staring at Bakugou steadily, holding his gaze with confidence. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ll be getting one.&rdquo;</p><p>That&rsquo;s what Bakugou liked to see. Sometimes it took some time for Izuku to speak up properly, even with him, especially to him, but he was getting better. That 'I&rsquo;ll be getting one&rsquo; was a statement. It didn&rsquo;t leave any space for rejection or doubts. It wasn&rsquo;t as if Bakugou could just say 'No, you&rsquo;re not&rsquo; or 'I won&rsquo;t let you&rsquo;.\u00a0 It was Izuku&rsquo;s decision. Bakugou had no power over him or over what he wanted. And, to be honest, he quite enjoyed having Izuku in charge from now and then, even if for something as trivial as decorating the flat.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t say anything in return to Izuku&rsquo;s words, but a tiny, tiny smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>That small gesture was what did it. Made that contagious grin resurface, just as blinding as always. And, just like that, the word 'no&rsquo; disappeared from Bakugou&rsquo;s vocabulary completely. There was going to be a tree, end of story.</p><p>Damned be that smile. Damned be the way it made Bakugou feel. And damned be the fact that he didn&rsquo;t regret it one bit.</p><p>Thankfully, they had to go, leaving behind this whole discussion for a bit. Bakugou might&rsquo;ve agreed to the idea but he sure didn&rsquo;t want to say it out loud. Some things were meant to be kept inside. Besides, Deku was smart enough to understand him properly.</p><p>Most of the time.</p><p>Stubborn was a good word to describe Izuku - stubbornly ambitious to be exact. That&rsquo;s what brought him to UA and what made him surpass every single obstacle life has thrown his way. Bakugou remembered himself laughing and mocking that ambition constantly, not being able to understand him or accept those qualities. He couldn&rsquo;t get how someone could be just as ambitious as him, maybe even more so, while still staring at him and everyone else from thousands of steps below with an almost frightening determination.</p><p>The same stubbornness was what made him bring up the Christmas tree problem again later that day, as soon as they saw the two villains they had to take care of locked up appropriately.</p><p>He was taking off the gloves of his hero costume, still covered in mud and slightly burned at the edge of his index finger when he asked: &ldquo;Do you want to buy it on our way back or during the weekend? They might be cheaper now.&rdquo;</p><p>Bakugou stopped what he was doing and looked at Izuku, a blank expression on his face. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not even December.&rdquo; Then, he moved his head to the side, not meeting Izuku&rsquo;s eyes, and muttered: &ldquo;Besides, we&rsquo;re not buying one.&rdquo;</p><p>Disappointment hit Izuku instantly. He opened his mouth to protest, but he only managed to let out a cried out &ldquo;Kacchan, we&rsquo;ve already-&rdquo; before he got interrupted by Bakugou.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be building the shit.&rdquo;</p><p>If Izuku seemed confused before, his confusion only intensified after this. It was clear in his posture.</p><p>And, this once, Bakugou didn&rsquo;t waste any more time waiting to explain himself.</p><p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t just use a tree some barbarian cut from the forests, Deku. Fucking hell, I like the smell, but I refuse to destroy the future of our goddamn planet for some shitty tradition. And the plastic ones are just as bad for the environment.&rdquo;</p><p>For the millionth time that year, Izuku rolled his eyes fondly at Bakugou&rsquo;s antics, a small, soft smile, curving the edge of his lips. Because of some documentary they have watched a couple weeks after they moved in together, years after they left UA behind and started their careers, Bakugou became obsessed with the idea of preserving the nature, recycling and, as he, himself, would&rsquo;ve said it, 'all the other crap.&rsquo; It shouldn&rsquo;t have surprised him, especially considering how he always went way out of his way when something interested him. And since he had started focusing more of on helping people rather than his own pride and desire for a position that mattered less than saving lives, Bakugou did the same thing. He didn&rsquo;t limit himself to wanting to protect citizens. He also used his energy to save the very earth they walked on and everything in between.</p><p>Because, as he liked to say, 'what was the point of rescuing them now if they were only going to suffer and live in ruin in the years to come?&rsquo;</p><p>A valid question and one that many heroes never came across even after decades of calling themselves pros.</p><p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Izuku, smiling at him, all traces of confusion and doubt gone. Because despite how practical Bakugou&rsquo;s idea seemed, they were both disasters when it came to building things from scratch.</p><p>They rarely had the patience to stay put for more than a couple of minutes and they both knew it.</p><p>&ldquo;Hell if I know,&rdquo; admitted Bakugou. But, somehow, this time there was a light in his eyes that told Izuku he was more than a little excited to try. After all, there were few things in existence that Bakugou loved more than a good challenge.</p><p>Gathering all the materials for it took less than they expected. In just two days they had an entire bag full of paper, ready to be painted, cut and reassembled. They had only needed to send a message to one of their old UA chats, asking for any kind of unwanted paper they might have around the house and in less than an hour, they had both Kirishima and Kaminari donating every single one of their notebooks and test papers. Which was a lot.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you donating them all, dipshits?&rdquo; Bakugou had asked them when they met personally to give them to him.</p><p>&ldquo;We just wanted to help, dude,&rdquo; answered Kaminari with a shit-eating grin and with the most innocent look in his eyes. But all three of them knew better than to believe that lie.</p><p>&ldquo;Just take them, Bakugou. And send us all a picture when the tree is up,&rdquo; said Kirishima instead, beating Bakugou&rsquo;s back twice before saying goodbye, hurrying to get to his own hero agency.</p><p>Painting every single page in green took the longest. It was horrible and unexpectedly expensive. Bakugou almost gave up twice, growling at the paint, before remembering that he couldn&rsquo;t ever give up on anything. Just looking at him exhausted Izuku sometimes.</p><p>How Bakugou could manage so much energy was one of his life&rsquo;s biggest wonders.</p><p>They stopped from time to time for a snack or to stare at the old tests in their hands, remembering fondly (or pridefully, in Bakugou&rsquo;s case) the old days in which passing a harsh test with flying colors had been one of the most stressful things they had to deal with. Of course, Kaminari&rsquo;s answers on certain tests made them both laugh whenever he tried to answer a question by inventing equations or formulas.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Pikachu, this symbol doesn&rsquo;t even fucking exist,&rdquo; smiled Bakugou, his eyes moving over the page. There was such an unguarded expression on his face, just looking back at messed up things their friends (God, how long it had taken for Bakugou to acknowledge that fact) used to do back in the day. Having him on the ground, in his socks and the embarrassing t-shirt and pants that were too worn up to wear outside but Bakugou refused to give up on, holding those papers, some filled with greens, some barely touched by paint, and with that smile all over his features, made Izuku happy. Truly, stupidly happy.</p><p>So happy that he wanted to jump on him in a less than elegant way and kiss him profoundly until Bakugou had no other choice but to step back, his cheeks tainted with that soft pink that Izuku adored.</p><p>He wanted to do it, so he did. And the result was just as wonderful as he had expected.</p><p>It has taken them a week to complete the tree. They had used some YouTube tutorials in order to learn how to create origami for the decorations and that brought them close to tears after the 43rd crane they had folded, their hands tired and full of cuts, but the end result had been worth it.</p><p>It was standing confidently in the middle of the room, neon colored bits of paper in the shape of animals clearly seen between the two shades of green they have chosen for the tree. Of course, it wasn&rsquo;t perfect - the position not straight enough, the paint job messy in certain places, the paper folded asymmetrically in some cases - but it was theirs. And it wasn&rsquo;t like they were perfect either.</p><p>They shouted at each other often, said things they regretted due to pride and fear. But when they stopped to think, hours after, the end result was the same. They&rsquo;d come together right there, in the living room, either shouting apologies at each other - often full of curses in Bakugou&rsquo;s case - or showing their remorse through touch alone. And every single time, they&rsquo;d end up cuddled on the couch, too close for comfort on that tiny piece of furniture, a superhero movie displayed in the background that they rarely paid attention to. Instead, they listened to each other, their own heartbeat, their rhythmic breathing.</p><p>They grounded each other. And the tree showed their story well enough.</p><p>As they stepped back to look at the construction, pride rang loudly in their hearts.</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t wait to put your gift under this fucking mess,&rdquo; said Bakugou, turning towards Izuku, one of his rough hands searching for his.</p><p>(The greens of his fingers blended with Izuku&rsquo;s own orange ones, creating a mix of brown that should&rsquo;ve been muddy and disgusting but, instead, looked warm and complex.)</p><p>Izuku held his hand tighter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure mine will be better this year.&rdquo;</p><p>God, how they loved to compete over the smallest things. Affection often ended up being the one they played around with the most.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re fucking with me. There&rsquo;s no chance you&rsquo;ll win this time.&rdquo; So quietly whispered. So aggressive in wording but so completely different in message.</p><p>Izuku smiled, letting his head rest on Bakugou&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t fair.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t fair how Izuku only needed to look at him once and ask for what he wanted, leaving Bakugou no possibility to deny him anything. It wasn&rsquo;t fair how he could use this weakness anytime, anywhere, and Bakugou would still say yes on every occasion.</p><p>The small twist he came up with didn&rsquo;t change reality at all.</p><p>The worst part? That Izuku could one day ask for the very last bit of Bakugou&rsquo;s heart that he hadn&rsquo;t owned yet and Bakugou&hellip; Bakugou would have no choice but to give it to him - without regrets, without any hesitation.</p><p>And he&rsquo;d still find more to offer.</p>",

And then get exactly what he wanted. Like what the fuck?!</p><p>Bakugou was strong enough to say \u2018no\u2019. Shout it even. Repeat it again and again and again until it got engraved over his moronic forehead. He was good at this, did it every day, with anyone.</p><p>Anyone that wasn\u2019t Deku, of course.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not decorating the entire house,\u201d were his words every single time Deku asked. \u201cI don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass if it\u2019s Christmas or not, I don\u2019t need or want to waste time putting up things all over the goddamn flat only to waste even more time taking them down.\u201d All rough words, all clear.

Please\u2026\u201d</p><p>Big eyes, green and shiny and pleading, hoping and waiting for Bakugou to give in.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that shit, Deku. Why the hell would we even need a tree?\u201d They were both in the hallway, fully dressed in their hero costumes, ready to go. Someone was in danger a few streets away from them and here they were, proper, licensed heroes, talking about freaking decorations.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s traditional. Besides, everyone will have one.\u201d A short pause before he moved his eyes to the floor and his smile turned into that curve of insecurity and awkwardness that Bakugou could not stand. \u201cAnd\u2026I thought\u00a0 it would be nice to have one as well\u201d</p><p>He hated that look. Despised seeing Deku make himself smaller instead of looking right up into Bakugou\u2019s eyes, shouting and demanding loud and clear what he felt like he deserved. He wasn\u2019t a kid anymore. He wasn\u2019t Bakugou\u2019s inferior like, maybe once, they felt he was. He was a hero in his own right and he was strong. Incredibly so. If he could stand up against an army of villains, he sure as hell could stand up for himself in front of Bakugou for some stupid tree.</p><p>Not that Bakugou would make things easier for him. \u201cI don\u2019t care what the others are doing. This is my flat.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a fight, just a mere discussion. It was constructive - for both of them, it always was. They stopped fighting for real, leaving all that toxicity in the past.</p><p>\u201cThis is also my flat and I want a Christmas tree, Kacchan,\u201d replied Izuku, his eyes staring at Bakugou steadily, holding his gaze with confidence. \u201cSo I\u2019ll be getting one.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s what Bakugou liked to see. Sometimes it took some time for Izuku to speak up properly, even with him, especially to him, but he was getting better. That 'I\u2019ll be getting one\u2019 was a statement. It didn\u2019t leave any space for rejection or doubts. It wasn\u2019t as if Bakugou could just say 'No, you\u2019re not\u2019 or 'I won\u2019t let you\u2019.\u00a0 It was Izuku\u2019s decision. Bakugou had no power over him or over what he wanted. And, to be honest, he quite enjoyed having Izuku in charge from now and then, even if for something as trivial as decorating the flat.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything in return to Izuku\u2019s words, but a tiny, tiny smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>That small gesture was what did it. Made that contagious grin resurface, just as blinding as always. And, just like that, the word 'no\u2019 disappeared from Bakugou\u2019s vocabulary completely. There was going to be a tree, end of story.</p><p>Damned be that smile. Damned be the way it made Bakugou feel. And damned be the fact that he didn\u2019t regret it one bit.</p><p>Thankfully, they had to go, leaving behind this whole discussion for a bit. Bakugou might\u2019ve agreed to the idea but he sure didn\u2019t want to say it out loud. Some things were meant to be kept inside. Besides, Deku was smart enough to understand him properly.</p><p>Most of the time.</p><p>Stubborn was a good word to describe Izuku - stubbornly ambitious to be exact. That\u2019s what brought him to UA and what made him surpass every single obstacle life has thrown his way. Bakugou remembered himself laughing and mocking that ambition constantly, not being able to understand him or accept those qualities. He couldn\u2019t get how someone could be just as ambitious as him, maybe even more so, while still staring at him and everyone else from thousands of steps below with an almost frightening determination.</p><p>The same stubbornness was what made him bring up the Christmas tree problem again later that day, as soon as they saw the two villains they had to take care of locked up appropriately.</p><p>He was taking off the gloves of his hero costume, still covered in mud and slightly burned at the edge of his index finger when he asked: \u201cDo you want to buy it on our way back or during the weekend? They might be cheaper now.\u201d</p><p>Bakugou stopped what he was doing and looked at Izuku, a blank expression on his face. \u201cIt\u2019s not even December.\u201d Then, he moved his head to the side, not meeting Izuku\u2019s eyes, and muttered: \u201cBesides, we\u2019re not buying one.\u201d</p><p>Disappointment hit Izuku instantly. He opened his mouth to protest, but he only managed to let out a cried out \u201cKacchan, we\u2019ve already-\u201d before he got interrupted by Bakugou.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be building the shit.\u201d</p><p>If Izuku seemed confused before, his confusion only intensified after this. It was clear in his posture.</p><p>And, this once, Bakugou didn\u2019t waste any more time waiting to explain himself.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t just use a tree some barbarian cut from the forests, Deku. Fucking hell, I like the smell, but I refuse to destroy the future of our goddamn planet for some shitty tradition. And the plastic ones are just as bad for the environment.\u201d</p><p>For the millionth time that year, Izuku rolled his eyes fondly at Bakugou\u2019s antics, a small, soft smile, curving the edge of his lips. Because of some documentary they have watched a couple weeks after they moved in together, years after they left UA behind and started their careers, Bakugou became obsessed with the idea of preserving the nature, recycling and, as he, himself, would\u2019ve said it, 'all the other crap.\u2019 It shouldn\u2019t have surprised him, especially considering how he always went way out of his way when something interested him. And since he had started focusing more of on helping people rather than his own pride and desire for a position that mattered less than saving lives, Bakugou did the same thing. He didn\u2019t limit himself to wanting to protect citizens. He also used his energy to save the very earth they walked on and everything in between.</p><p>Because, as he liked to say, 'what was the point of rescuing them now if they were only going to suffer and live in ruin in the years to come?\u2019</p><p>A valid question and one that many heroes never came across even after decades of calling themselves pros.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d asked Izuku, smiling at him, all traces of confusion and doubt gone. Because despite how practical Bakugou\u2019s idea seemed, they were both disasters when it came to building things from scratch.</p><p>They rarely had the patience to stay put for more than a couple of minutes and they both knew it.</p><p>\u201cHell if I know,\u201d admitted Bakugou. But, somehow, this time there was a light in his eyes that told Izuku he was more than a little excited to try. After all, there were few things in existence that Bakugou loved more than a good challenge.</p><p>Gathering all the materials for it took less than they expected. In just two days they had an entire bag full of paper, ready to be painted, cut and reassembled. They had only needed to send a message to one of their old UA chats, asking for any kind of unwanted paper they might have around the house and in less than an hour, they had both Kirishima and Kaminari donating every single one of their notebooks and test papers. Which was a lot.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you donating them all, dipshits?\u201d Bakugou had asked them when they met personally to give them to him.</p><p>\u201cWe just wanted to help, dude,\u201d answered Kaminari with a shit-eating grin and with the most innocent look in his eyes. But all three of them knew better than to believe that lie.</p><p>\u201cJust take them, Bakugou. And send us all a picture when the tree is up,\u201d said Kirishima instead, beating Bakugou\u2019s back twice before saying goodbye, hurrying to get to his own hero agency.</p><p>Painting every single page in green took the longest. It was horrible and unexpectedly expensive. Bakugou almost gave up twice, growling at the paint, before remembering that he couldn\u2019t ever give up on anything. Just looking at him exhausted Izuku sometimes.</p><p>How Bakugou could manage so much energy was one of his life\u2019s biggest wonders.</p><p>They stopped from time to time for a snack or to stare at the old tests in their hands, remembering fondly (or pridefully, in Bakugou\u2019s case) the old days in which passing a harsh test with flying colors had been one of the most stressful things they had to deal with. Of course, Kaminari\u2019s answers on certain tests made them both laugh whenever he tried to answer a question by inventing equations or formulas.</p><p>\u201cOh, Pikachu, this symbol doesn\u2019t even fucking exist,\u201d smiled Bakugou, his eyes moving over the page. There was such an unguarded expression on his face, just looking back at messed up things their friends (God, how long it had taken for Bakugou to acknowledge that fact) used to do back in the day. Having him on the ground, in his socks and the embarrassing t-shirt and pants that were too worn up to wear outside but Bakugou refused to give up on, holding those papers, some filled with greens, some barely touched by paint, and with that smile all over his features, made Izuku happy. Truly, stupidly happy.</p><p>So happy that he wanted to jump on him in a less than elegant way and kiss him profoundly until Bakugou had no other choice but to step back, his cheeks tainted with that soft pink that Izuku adored.</p><p>He wanted to do it, so he did. And the result was just as wonderful as he had expected.</p><p>It has taken them a week to complete the tree. They had used some YouTube tutorials in order to learn how to create origami for the decorations and that brought them close to tears after the 43rd crane they had folded, their hands tired and full of cuts, but the end result had been worth it.</p><p>It was standing confidently in the middle of the room, neon colored bits of paper in the shape of animals clearly seen between the two shades of green they have chosen for the tree. Of course, it wasn\u2019t perfect - the position not straight enough, the paint job messy in certain places, the paper folded asymmetrically in some cases - but it was theirs. And it wasn\u2019t like they were perfect either.</p><p>They shouted at each other often, said things they regretted due to pride and fear. But when they stopped to think, hours after, the end result was the same. They\u2019d come together right there, in the living room, either shouting apologies at each other - often full of curses in Bakugou\u2019s case - or showing their remorse through touch alone. And every single time, they\u2019d end up cuddled on the couch, too close for comfort on that tiny piece of furniture, a superhero movie displayed in the background that they rarely paid attention to. Instead, they listened to each other, their own heartbeat, their rhythmic breathing.</p><p>They grounded each other. And the tree showed their story well enough.</p><p>As they stepped back to look at the construction, pride rang loudly in their hearts.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait to put your gift under this fucking mess,\u201d said Bakugou, turning towards Izuku, one of his rough hands searching for his.</p><p>(The greens of his fingers blended with Izuku\u2019s own orange ones, creating a mix of brown that should\u2019ve been muddy and disgusting but, instead, looked warm and complex.)</p><p>Izuku held his hand tighter. \u201cI\u2019m sure mine will be better this year.\u201d</p><p>God, how they loved to compete over the smallest things. Affection often ended up being the one they played around with the most.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fucking with me. There\u2019s no chance you\u2019ll win this time.\u201d So quietly whispered. So aggressive in wording but so completely different in message.</p><p>Izuku smiled, letting his head rest on Bakugou\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t fair.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t fair how Izuku only needed to look at him once and ask for what he wanted, leaving Bakugou no possibility to deny him anything. It wasn\u2019t fair how he could use this weakness anytime, anywhere, and Bakugou would still say yes on every occasion.</p><p>The small twist he came up with didn\u2019t change reality at all.</p><p>The worst part? That Izuku could one day ask for the very last bit of Bakugou\u2019s heart that he hadn\u2019t owned yet and Bakugou\u2026 Bakugou would have no choice but to give it to him - without regrets, without any hesitation.</p><p>And he\u2019d still find more to offer.</p></p>",

They stopped fighting for real, leaving all that toxicity in the past.</p><p>\u201cThis is also my flat and I want a Christmas tree, Kacchan,\u201d replied Izuku, his eyes staring at Bakugou steadily, holding his gaze with confidence. \u201cSo I\u2019ll be getting one.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s what Bakugou liked to see. Sometimes it took some time for Izuku to speak up properly, even with him, especially to him, but he was getting better. That 'I\u2019ll be getting one\u2019 was a statement. It didn\u2019t leave any space for rejection or doubts. It wasn\u2019t as if Bakugou could just say 'No, you\u2019re not\u2019 or 'I won\u2019t let you\u2019.\u00a0 It was Izuku\u2019s decision. Bakugou had no power over him or over what he wanted. And, to be honest, he quite enjoyed having Izuku in charge from now and then, even if for something as trivial as decorating the flat.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything in return to Izuku\u2019s words, but a tiny, tiny smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>That small gesture was what did it. Made that contagious grin resurface, just as blinding as always. And, just like that, the word 'no\u2019 disappeared from Bakugou\u2019s vocabulary completely. There was going to be a tree, end of story.</p><p>Damned be that smile. Damned be the way it made Bakugou feel. And damned be the fact that he didn\u2019t regret it one bit.</p><p>Thankfully, they had to go, leaving behind this whole discussion for a bit. Bakugou might\u2019ve agreed to the idea but he sure didn\u2019t want to say it out loud. Some things were meant to be kept inside. Besides, Deku was smart enough to understand him properly.</p><p>Most of the time.</p><p>Stubborn was a good word to describe Izuku - stubbornly ambitious to be exact. That\u2019s what brought him to UA and what made him surpass every single obstacle life has thrown his way. Bakugou remembered himself laughing and mocking that ambition constantly, not being able to understand him or accept those qualities. He couldn\u2019t get how someone could be just as ambitious as him, maybe even more so, while still staring at him and everyone else from thousands of steps below with an almost frightening determination.</p><p>The same stubbornness was what made him bring up the Christmas tree problem again later that day, as soon as they saw the two villains they had to take care of locked up appropriately.</p><p>He was taking off the gloves of his hero costume, still covered in mud and slightly burned at the edge of his index finger when he asked: \u201cDo you want to buy it on our way back or during the weekend? They might be cheaper now.\u201d</p><p>Bakugou stopped what he was doing and looked at Izuku, a blank expression on his face. \u201cIt\u2019s not even December.\u201d Then, he moved his head to the side, not meeting Izuku\u2019s eyes, and muttered: \u201cBesides, we\u2019re not buying one.\u201d</p><p>Disappointment hit Izuku instantly. He opened his mouth to protest, but he only managed to let out a cried out \u201cKacchan, we\u2019ve already-\u201d before he got interrupted by Bakugou.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be building the shit.\u201d</p><p>If Izuku seemed confused before, his confusion only intensified after this. It was clear in his posture.</p><p>And, this once, Bakugou didn\u2019t waste any more time waiting to explain himself.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t just use a tree some barbarian cut from the forests, Deku. Fucking hell, I like the smell, but I refuse to destroy the future of our goddamn planet for some shitty tradition. And the plastic ones are just as bad for the environment.\u201d</p><p>For the millionth time that year, Izuku rolled his eyes fondly at Bakugou\u2019s antics, a small, soft smile, curving the edge of his lips. Because of some documentary they have watched a couple weeks after they moved in together, years after they left UA behind and started their careers, Bakugou became obsessed with the idea of preserving the nature, recycling and, as he, himself, would\u2019ve said it, 'all the other crap.\u2019 It shouldn\u2019t have surprised him, especially considering how he always went way out of his way when something interested him. And since he had started focusing more of on helping people rather than his own pride and desire for a position that mattered less than saving lives, Bakugou did the same thing. He didn\u2019t limit himself to wanting to protect citizens. He also used his energy to save the very earth they walked on and everything in between.</p><p>Because, as he liked to say, 'what was the point of rescuing them now if they were only going to suffer and live in ruin in the years to come?\u2019</p><p>A valid question and one that many heroes never came across even after decades of calling themselves pros.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d asked Izuku, smiling at him, all traces of confusion and doubt gone. Because despite how practical Bakugou\u2019s idea seemed, they were both disasters when it came to building things from scratch.</p><p>They rarely had the patience to stay put for more than a couple of minutes and they both knew it.</p><p>\u201cHell if I know,\u201d admitted Bakugou. But, somehow, this time there was a light in his eyes that told Izuku he was more than a little excited to try. After all, there were few things in existence that Bakugou loved more than a good challenge.</p><p>Gathering all the materials for it took less than they expected. In just two days they had an entire bag full of paper, ready to be painted, cut and reassembled. They had only needed to send a message to one of their old UA chats, asking for any kind of unwanted paper they might have around the house and in less than an hour, they had both Kirishima and Kaminari donating every single one of their notebooks and test papers. Which was a lot.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you donating them all, dipshits?\u201d Bakugou had asked them when they met personally to give them to him.</p><p>\u201cWe just wanted to help, dude,\u201d answered Kaminari with a shit-eating grin and with the most innocent look in his eyes. But all three of them knew better than to believe that lie.</p><p>\u201cJust take them, Bakugou. And send us all a picture when the tree is up,\u201d said Kirishima instead, beating Bakugou\u2019s back twice before saying goodbye, hurrying to get to his own hero agency.</p><p>Painting every single page in green took the longest. It was horrible and unexpectedly expensive. Bakugou almost gave up twice, growling at the paint, before remembering that he couldn\u2019t ever give up on anything. Just looking at him exhausted Izuku sometimes.</p><p>How Bakugou could manage so much energy was one of his life\u2019s biggest wonders.</p><p>They stopped from time to time for a snack or to stare at the old tests in their hands, remembering fondly (or pridefully, in Bakugou\u2019s case) the old days in which passing a harsh test with flying colors had been one of the most stressful things they had to deal with. Of course, Kaminari\u2019s answers on certain tests made them both laugh whenever he tried to answer a question by inventing equations or formulas.</p><p>\u201cOh, Pikachu, this symbol doesn\u2019t even fucking exist,\u201d smiled Bakugou, his eyes moving over the page. There was such an unguarded expression on his face, just looking back at messed up things their friends (God, how long it had taken for Bakugou to acknowledge that fact) used to do back in the day. Having him on the ground, in his socks and the embarrassing t-shirt and pants that were too worn up to wear outside but Bakugou refused to give up on, holding those papers, some filled with greens, some barely touched by paint, and with that smile all over his features, made Izuku happy. Truly, stupidly happy.</p><p>So happy that he wanted to jump on him in a less than elegant way and kiss him profoundly until Bakugou had no other choice but to step back, his cheeks tainted with that soft pink that Izuku adored.</p><p>He wanted to do it, so he did. And the result was just as wonderful as he had expected.</p><p>It has taken them a week to complete the tree. They had used some YouTube tutorials in order to learn how to create origami for the decorations and that brought them close to tears after the 43rd crane they had folded, their hands tired and full of cuts, but the end result had been worth it.</p><p>It was standing confidently in the middle of the room, neon colored bits of paper in the shape of animals clearly seen between the two shades of green they have chosen for the tree. Of course, it wasn\u2019t perfect - the position not straight enough, the paint job messy in certain places, the paper folded asymmetrically in some cases - but it was theirs. And it wasn\u2019t like they were perfect either.</p><p>They shouted at each other often, said things they regretted due to pride and fear. But when they stopped to think, hours after, the end result was the same. They\u2019d come together right there, in the living room, either shouting apologies at each other - often full of curses in Bakugou\u2019s case - or showing their remorse through touch alone. And every single time, they\u2019d end up cuddled on the couch, too close for comfort on that tiny piece of furniture, a superhero movie displayed in the background that they rarely paid attention to. Instead, they listened to each other, their own heartbeat, their rhythmic breathing.</p><p>They grounded each other. And the tree showed their story well enough.</p><p>As they stepped back to look at the construction, pride rang loudly in their hearts.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait to put your gift under this fucking mess,\u201d said Bakugou, turning towards Izuku, one of his rough hands searching for his.</p><p>(The greens of his fingers blended with Izuku\u2019s own orange ones, creating a mix of brown that should\u2019ve been muddy and disgusting but, instead, looked warm and complex.)</p><p>Izuku held his hand tighter. \u201cI\u2019m sure mine will be better this year.\u201d</p><p>God, how they loved to compete over the smallest things. Affection often ended up being the one they played around with the most.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fucking with me. There\u2019s no chance you\u2019ll win this time.\u201d So quietly whispered. So aggressive in wording but so completely different in message.</p><p>Izuku smiled, letting his head rest on Bakugou\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t fair.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t fair how Izuku only needed to look at him once and ask for what he wanted, leaving Bakugou no possibility to deny him anything. It wasn\u2019t fair how he could use this weakness anytime, anywhere, and Bakugou would still say yes on every occasion.</p><p>The small twist he came up with didn\u2019t change reality at all.</p><p>The worst part? That Izuku could one day ask for the very last bit of Bakugou\u2019s heart that he hadn\u2019t owned yet and Bakugou\u2026 Bakugou would have no choice but to give it to him - without regrets, without any hesitation.</p><p>And he\u2019d still find more to offer.</p></p>",

And then get exactly what he wanted. Like what the fuck?!</p><p>Bakugou was strong enough to say &lsquo;no&rsquo;. Shout it even. Repeat it again and again and again until it got engraved over his moronic forehead. He was good at this, did it every day, with anyone.</p><p>Anyone that wasn&rsquo;t Deku, of course.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not decorating the entire house,&rdquo; were his words every single time Deku asked. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give a rat&rsquo;s ass if it&rsquo;s Christmas or not, I don&rsquo;t need or want to waste time putting up things all over the goddamn flat only to waste even more time taking them down.&rdquo; All rough words, all clear. Should&rsquo;ve sent the message across but, judging what followed next, wasn&rsquo;t the case.</p><p>&ldquo;But, Kacchan, it&rsquo;ll just be a tree. Please&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Big eyes, green and shiny and pleading, hoping and waiting for Bakugou to give in.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give me that shit, Deku. Why the hell would we even need a tree?&rdquo; They were both in the hallway, fully dressed in their hero costumes, ready to go. Someone was in danger a few streets away from them and here they were, proper, licensed heroes, talking about freaking decorations.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s traditional. Besides, everyone will have one.&rdquo; A short pause before he moved his eyes to the floor and his smile turned into that curve of insecurity and awkwardness that Bakugou could not stand. &ldquo;And&hellip;I thought&nbsp; it would be nice to have one as well&rdquo;</p><p>He hated that look. Despised seeing Deku make himself smaller instead of looking right up into Bakugou&rsquo;s eyes, shouting and demanding loud and clear what he felt like he deserved. He wasn&rsquo;t a kid anymore. He wasn&rsquo;t Bakugou&rsquo;s inferior like, maybe once, they felt he was. He was a hero in his own right and he was strong. Incredibly so. If he could stand up against an army of villains, he sure as hell could stand up for himself in front of Bakugou for some stupid tree.</p><p>Not that Bakugou would make things easier for him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what the others are doing.
