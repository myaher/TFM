Her freckles remind me of the stars, you know. Sometimes, when we&rsquo;d stargaze I&rsquo;d tell her that the stars have nothing on her. And her hands, oh, her hands. I&rsquo;d sometimes get distracted, staring at them. They&rsquo;re rough, you can tell how hard she works from all the scars, and covered in tiny freckles, too.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nott sits in the corner of the camp, getting greener and greener as Yeza speaks. She knows that Yeza has always seen the best in her, even when she didn&rsquo;t see it herself. You&rsquo;d think she&rsquo;d hung the moon, listening to him go on! As he speaks, she stares at her hands. They&rsquo;re a deep forest green, mottled through with other, lighter shades. They&rsquo;re even rougher than what they were when she was a halfling, thanks to a mixture of her tougher goblin skin and the efforts of loading a hand crossbow all the time. Still covered in freckles, though they&rsquo;re a light green instead of the dark brown they used to be. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looks up to see Yeza has wandered over. The group has dispersed, lingering suspiciously long on the other side of the camp. &ldquo;Do you- um, do you really still think all of that?&rdquo; she asks quietly, the words barely audible. Yeza cups her face in his hands. &ldquo;Vethy, I thought you&rsquo;d died. You did die. For a year, I wished I could bring you back, even for just a second. To actually have you back? It&rsquo;s a dream come true! I love you, Veth, no matter if you&rsquo;ve got claws or not,&rdquo; both of their eyes are shining when he finishes. Slowly, making sure that she can move away if she wants, Yeza leans forward to kiss her. She wraps her arms gently around his neck, before gently pulling away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed you so much, Yeza,&rdquo; she whispers. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad to have you back, Veth.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></p>",
