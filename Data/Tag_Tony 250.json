What would you call Sokovia? Yeah, they defeated Ultron, but did they win? Can a war with that many casualties be labelled a victory? The mess that revolved around the Sokovian Accords? They only made the things worse. No one won. Everyone lost. Everyone lost a part of their family. </p><p>But this was different. This time, it wasn&rsquo;t even a fight that could be fixed. Last time, everyone was alive, just scattered around the world. Now?</p><p>Now half the world is dead.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wanna go, Mr Stark please, I don&rsquo;t-&ldquo; </i></p><p>That&rsquo;s it. He opened his eyes, tossed the covers on the floor, standing up and leaving the room. He entered the kitchen to make himself a cup of coffee. </p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you just install one in your room? Less walking every damn night.&rdquo; She called from the couch.</p><p>Tony grinned slightly, filling his cup. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s keeping you up?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>Y/N looked at him, leaning her head sideways, &ldquo;Can you believe it was a year ago?&rdquo;</p><p>He took a sip from his coffee, popping on the couch next to her. She brought her legs closer to herself only to let them land in his lap. &ldquo;Seems like yesterday.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unbelievable how the world went to shit so quickly.&rdquo;</p><p>Sipping from his coffee again, his stare unfocused in the dark of the room. His mind was constantly replaying everything that happened over and over again.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop beating yourself over it.&rdquo; she finally said, breaking the silence. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I could&rsquo;ve done more.&rdquo; he said, swallowing a thick nothing.</p><p>&ldquo;We all could&rsquo;ve. No point beating yourself over it now.&rdquo; she said, supporting her head with her hand against the back of the couch.</p><p>&ldquo;You think it&rsquo;ll get better?&rdquo; he asked, glancing in her direction.</p><p>She raised an eyebrow &ldquo;Only if we stop swimming in the shallow ends of what happened. I&rsquo;m not saying forget it, of course, because it defined the future but just stop living in what would&rsquo;ve happened if we stopped him.&rdquo; she curled a corner of her lips, before shrugging her shoulders &ldquo;We gotta work on what we can do now, not what we could do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s actually not a that bad point.&rdquo; he said, in a serious tone.</p><p>&ldquo;Not a that bad point?&rdquo; she replied &ldquo;You really need sleep.&rdquo;</p><p>He sighed, getting up and walking towards the coffee machine again &ldquo;Which you&rsquo;re not gonna get if you continue drinking coffee in such unhealthy amounts.&rdquo; she warned.</p><p>&ldquo;Trust me, I would love to sleep more than anything. I just can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He said eyeing the fluid filling his cup. &ldquo;I see him every time I close my eyes. Every time, I return there, to that day. I see him turning to dust. I see May&rsquo;s face once she realised he won&rsquo;t be coming home and&hellip; I&rsquo;m tired.&rdquo;</p><p>Out of all the deaths that happened a year ago, Peter&rsquo;s was the most traumatising one. He couldn&rsquo;t help but feel like the fact that he brought him in on the team contributed to his death, even though it wasn&rsquo;t being on the team that had killed him.</p><p>But again, if he hadn&rsquo;t been on the team, he would&rsquo;ve died at home. He wouldn&rsquo;t be scattered around an abandoned planet in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>Y/N got up from the couch, and walked towards Tony, embracing him in a reassuring hug. </p><p>&ldquo;C-coffee.&rdquo; he muttered under his breath, balancing the mug between them. </p><p>She rolled her eyes, taking the mug away and spilling it in the sink. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to bed, stat.&rdquo;</p><p>He stared at her, not sure if she had listened to anything he had just said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I don&rsquo;t feel like reliving everything again.&rdquo;</p><p>She took his hand in hers &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be alone.&rdquo;</p><p>He hesitated, trying to turn around on his heel.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious, Tones.&rdquo; she said, in a voice with a hint of anger. &ldquo;This&hellip; I know what it feels like when you can&rsquo;t sleep.

The show opened with glimpses of interviews, showing funny or memorable moments in a retrospective, many famous faces appearing on the screen.<br/><br/>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you don&rsquo;t remember giving this interview,&rdquo; Steve murmured, looking at his husband with gentle bewilderment, that hid a lot of fondness. Actually, he could believe that. Tony seemed to never pay a lot of mind about what he was telling to the press, almost as if he didn&rsquo;t have any filter. He probably didn&rsquo;t.</p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Tony called, mouth stretched into a smile, as he was safely nestled in Steve&rsquo;s arms, the couple taking up their favorite spot on the couch. &ldquo;I give a lot of interviews, don&rsquo;t expect me to remember each and one of them&mdash;&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Hope you said some dirty details!&rdquo; Clint grinned, making himself more comfortable between Nat and Bruce, the three of them seated on the second couch. <br/><br/>&ldquo;Thought you hated hearing about that,&rdquo; Natasha pointed out.<br/><br/>&ldquo;No, I hate when I walk on them because neither of them can keep it in their pants. Hearing about it on national TV is different.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t count on it, Tony is always so suave and discreet,&rdquo; Bruce added in a serious tone, that contradicted a teasing smile. <br/><br/>&ldquo;Unlike Steve. He can&rsquo;t handle a camera in his face,&rdquo; Bucky murmured from his splayed on the floor position, with his face smushed into Sam&rsquo;s bicep. The Winter Soldier didn&rsquo;t sleep well in the last days. <br/><br/>Sam laughed, jostling Bucky a bit who grumbled loudly in protest. Like a sleepy bear. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t wait to see him get all red and splutter words out. Please tell me that will happen.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Hey, shhh!&rdquo; Natasha shushed her friends when the name of the show disappeared from the screen and the blonde host showed, smiling in greeting.<br/><br/>&ldquo;<i>Welcome to the Celebrity Couples Interview! This time we have a real treat for you, the first superhero couple who public deemed with the proud name Superhusbands, also known as Stony&mdash;</i>&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Aw, Stony is a cute name,&rdquo; Sam laughed, sending Steve a wide smile. &ldquo;Kinda makes you imagine stone statues of you two all over New York.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Steve said quickly, shaking his head for double emphasis, just at the moment Tony opened his mouth. No statues. <br/><br/>&ldquo;It is a noble term, my friends,&rdquo; Thor rumbled from his favorite armchair.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Hey, there goes Steve!&rdquo; Sam yelled, ceasing the chatter and pointing at the screen with the image of a path in the park. It was almost empty and the sun wasn&rsquo;t too high yet and dew was sparkling on the grass.<br/><br/>&ldquo;<i>Hey! There he is! Go go go!</i>&rdquo;<br/><br/>The camera angle changed and the pace quickened as two people started running. Soon, Steve&rsquo;s silhouette appeared in the camera&rsquo;s view, as he was during his morning jog, wearing a grey, clingy t-shirt and drawstring pants.<br/><br/>The team whistled, and Steve blushed a bit at that. Captain America looked good in tight clothes.<br/><br/>&ldquo;<i>Captain! Captain Rogers! May we have a word with you?!</i>&rdquo;<br/><br/>Steve turned around, temporarily jogging in place, blinking surprised at the camera. Usually when people jog they turn red and sweaty and disgusting. Steve wasn&rsquo;t one of them. His face was just a bit pink, and his hair got a little bit damp near the hairline. His lips were flushed, as Steve had a habit of licking his lips while working out. It wasn&rsquo;t a typical workout look. Steve looked hot and sweet, like a freshly baked cinabbon. <br/><br/>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my husband,&rdquo; Tony said proudly, grunting at the elbow aimed at his stomach from the said husband.<br/><br/>Back on the screen, Steve showed all of his teeth in a wide smile, a quite unusual reaction at seeing a camera when it came to him. <br/><br/>&ldquo;<i>Sure! If you can catch me, that is!</i>&rdquo; after the words, Steve turned around and zoomed out from the view, camera soon on him, showing his silhouette getting smaller and smaller.<br/><br/>&ldquo;<i>Noo! Captain, please wait!</i>&rdquo; more footsteps and the clinking of high heels the presenter wore was perfectly hearable. The image of the presenter and cameraman, chasing Captain America made the team laugh.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Little shit,&rdquo; Sam commented the behavior and Tony smiled at Steve&rsquo;s mischievous, yet somehow proud smile. <br/><br/>&ldquo;<i>Mister Stark!</i>&rdquo;<br/><br/>The TV showed Tony, walking out of one of the coffee places in downtown, holding a stainless steel coffee cup with an outline of Captain America shield pressed on the side. He was in a formal, dark blue suit, with a white shirt underneath and a tie. There was even a handkerchief in his breast pocket, and the look was completed with expensive sunglasses and even more expensive wristwatch, matching the whole set. A true businessman at his finest.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Oh, were you between meetings?&rdquo; Steve asked, and Tony paused for a second, before looking away.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Yeah, between meetings,&rdquo; Tony agreed, not sounding too convincing and Steve only narrowed eyes. Tony better hope that Pepper was not watching this show.<br/><br/>&ldquo;<i>Mister Stark, can we have a word with you?</i>&rdquo;<br/><br/>The on-screen Tony slowly lowered his sunglasses, brown eyes sparkling in the sun. He smiled slowly, one corner of his lips going higher than the other, accented by the sharp and fresh angles of his goatee.<br/><br/>&ldquo;<i>Sure.</i>&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;You would just agree to anything to stay away from SI meetings,&rdquo; Natasha chimed in, clearly seeing how on-screen Tony planned to take his sweet time with answering questions and having an excuse for being late. <br/><br/>&ldquo;Time for the questions!&rdquo; Wanda called, holding a bowl of popcorn for her and Pietro to share. The formula of the show was with the presenter asking questions sent by fans to the couple in a separate time and finding out if the answers matched. Sometimes there was some task at the end, but not always. <br/><br/>&ldquo;<i>What would your partner take with him to a deserted island?</i>&rdquo;<br/><br/>The first question showed on the screen on a polka dot background, written out in colorful letters. Classic one, really.<br/><br/>Steve was the first one to answer. The cameraman finally caught on him, and the interview was filmed with Steve leaning over a barrier, on a background of rising sun and its reflection in a nearby pond. The sun rays sparkled in Steve&rsquo;s hair and the blue in his eyes looked calm, giving a serene feeling. <br/><br/>&ldquo;Hey, he is not blushing and stuttering,&rdquo; Bucky complained, disappointed with the lack of Steve&rsquo;s usual nervousness in front of the camera. On contrary, his friend looked good and surprisingly relaxed.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Maybe they photoshopped him,&rdquo; Sam said, getting a chuckle out of the team.<br/><br/>&ldquo;It is just good camera work,&rdquo; Tony added, hearing Steve grunt behind him. &ldquo;What? We both know you get camera shy. Don&rsquo;t worry, not everyone can look so effortlessly pretty like me during filming.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Effortlessly,&rdquo; Steve repeated in a mocking voice. He knew first hand the long hours Tony spent in the bathroom each evening, rubbing numerous oils and lotions into different body parts. Tony just shook his head in warning, not allowing the other man to expand that topic.<br/><br/>&ldquo;<i>Well, Tony can make pretty amazing things from basically nothing\u2026</i>&rdquo;<br/><br/>The voice coming from the TV focused everyone&rsquo;s attention back on the screen. The on-screen Steve started to talk.<br/><br/>&ldquo;<i>I think he would take a rope, a knife and&mdash; that&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s all he needs. He could get the rest on the island.</i>&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Good thing you didn&rsquo;t say matches, I could make a fire on my own,&rdquo; Tony grinned, pleased with the answer.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Of course you could,&rdquo; Steve agreed for the sake of agreeing, hearing a displeased murmur from their teammates. Where was the dirt?<br/><br/>&ldquo;<i>Hmmm\u2026 Steve would take\u2026</i>&rdquo;<br/><br/>The screen switched showing Tony. Everyone looked hopeful, hoping for some juicer answer.<br/><br/>&ldquo;<i>He would take a rope&mdash;</i>&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Boring!&rdquo; Clint hollered, as it seemed that the question would be answered in the same practical way as Steve did. <br/><br/>&ldquo;<i>&mdash; and lube and me.</i>&rdquo;<br/><br/>Oh.<br/><br/>&ldquo;<i>We would have some good time.</i>&rdquo;<br/><br/>The on-screen Tony nonchalantly sipped his coffee, while the real-life Tony opened his mouth in shock in a general murmur of approval coming from the team. He didn&rsquo;t remember saying that. Steve also gaped at the TV, feeling his face burn.<br/><br/>From that point, it only got worse. <br/><br/>&ldquo;<i>What is your favorite thing in your partner?</i>&rdquo; the second question showed in bold letters.<br/><br/>&ldquo;<i>Oh gosh,</i>&rdquo; Steve smiled sweetly and scratched the back of his head, looking shy. It would be innocent if the movement didn&rsquo;t pronounce his enormous biceps, which seemed like a very fan-service moment. &ldquo;<i>Tony is smart, caring and funny. He is a whole package. I love everything about him, so I guess Tony altogether is my favorite thing.</i>&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Sappy,&rdquo; Pietro gruffed, while Wanda cooed, like most of the team. Bucky made some gagging noise over the sweetness, and Steve aimed a light kick at his friend&rsquo;s back. <br/><br/>Then the TV showed Tony.<br/><br/>&ldquo;<i>His *BLEEP*,</i>&rdquo; the on-screen Tony blurted out without a second of hesitation. Although the word was censored, the mouth movement was clear and the whole team burst into laughter. &ldquo;<i>Okay, I am joking,</i>&rdquo; Tony backtracked, smiling charmingly. &ldquo;<i>His heart. He is a good man. But he does have an amazing *BLEEP*.</i>&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Tony asked in a shaky voice, getting nervous under Steve&rsquo;s reprimanding look. &ldquo;I fixed it!&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;You definitely did,&rdquo; Clint cackled. <br/><br/>Steve feared for the last question. Well, not a question\u2026<br/><br/>&ldquo;<i>Whaaat?</i>&rdquo; the on-screen Steve laughed nervously, his eyes crinkling. &ldquo;<i>No, no way. I am not doing it.</i>&rdquo;<br/><br/>Ah, so it was a task.<br/><br/>&ldquo;<i>Really?</i>&rdquo; Tony said, lowering his sunglasses again. &ldquo;<i>You really want me to do it?</i>&rdquo; he asked, his smile and whole posture giving away that he would.<br/><br/>The team held its breath waiting for the reveal what the task could be.<br/><br/>On the screen on a cheerful background of colorful stripes showed the last question of the interview. A task. <br/><br/>&ldquo;<i>Pretend that what you are holding is your partner and make out with it.</i>&rdquo;<br/><br/>The on-screen Steve looked at the water bottle in his hand. <br/><br/>&ldquo;<i>No,</i>&rdquo; he denied taking part in the challenge looking harshly into the camera, an embarrassed smile quickly following. &ldquo;<i>No,</i>&rdquo; he repeated, shaking his head. <br/><br/>&ldquo;<i>Alright,</i>&rdquo; the on-screen Tony nodded enthusiastically. &ldquo;<i>Just come with the camera closer. Like, get my whole face in. Closer. Perfect.</i>&rdquo;<br/><br/>And so on the background of a busy New York street, Tony put the coffee cup closer to his face and closed his eyes. A tip of a pink tongue touched the bottom and then slowly traced all the way up, going up the middle of the shield on the cup, lingering at the rim and doing a half circle. Then he tipped the cup all the way up, holding it almost vertically, downing down the contents in big gulps, his neck stretched and Adam&rsquo;s apple moving temptingly.<br/><br/>The room turned very, very quiet. When Tony was done, he lowered the cup with a satisfied breath and wiped his shiny lips with a top of a hand. All the time looking into the camera.<br/><br/>There would be gifsets of this for sure all over the Internet soon.<br/><br/>The show was ending and the team started cheering and commenting, congratulating the couple a good show. Both Steve and Tony remained speechless, although for entirely different reasons. <br/><br/>Tony found himself burying his face into hands, a guilty aura all around him. He didn&rsquo;t remember that interview. He really didn&rsquo;t. He was caught off guard in an early hour. Maybe the coffee he was drinking was his first and Steve should know better than to let him out of the house without his morning coffee. Yes, he should just blame it all on Steve, it was a good plan&mdash;<br/><br/>It was a terrible, terrible plan. He should man up and just apologize. And then call the network and cease the transmission and burn the tape. Maybe Pepper was already on it.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Steve, I&mdash;&rdquo; Tony turned to his husband, a profound apology already forming on the tip of his tongue which he was not given a permission to say. There were hands on his cheeks, warm lips on his lips, and a tongue breaching in, claiming every inch. Through half-lidded eyes Tony saw how narrowed and dark Steve&rsquo;s eyes were, a clear sign of&mdash;<br/><br/>Oh. Oooh.<br/><br/>Maybe he should give interviews while half asleep more often.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Booo! Get a room!&rdquo;<br/><br/>They didn&rsquo;t have to hear it twice.

Actually, he could believe that. Tony seemed to never pay a lot of mind about what he was telling to the press, almost as if he didn\u2019t have any filter. He probably didn\u2019t.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t!\u201d Tony called, mouth stretched into a smile, as he was safely nestled in Steve\u2019s arms, the couple taking up their favorite spot on the couch. \u201cI give a lot of interviews, don\u2019t expect me to remember each and one of them\u2014\u201d<br><br>\u201cHope you said some dirty details!\u201d Clint grinned, making himself more comfortable between Nat and Bruce, the three of them seated on the second couch. <br><br>\u201cThought you hated hearing about that,\u201d Natasha pointed out.<br><br>\u201cNo, I hate when I walk on them because neither of them can keep it in their pants. Hearing about it on national TV is different.\u201d<br><br>\u201cDon\u2019t count on it, Tony is always so suave and discreet,\u201d Bruce added in a serious tone, that contradicted a teasing smile. <br><br>\u201cUnlike Steve. He can\u2019t handle a camera in his face,\u201d Bucky murmured from his splayed on the floor position, with his face smushed into Sam\u2019s bicep. The Winter Soldier didn\u2019t sleep well in the last days. <br><br>Sam laughed, jostling Bucky a bit who grumbled loudly in protest. Like a sleepy bear. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see him get all red and splutter words out. Please tell me that will happen.\u201d<br><br>\u201cHey, shhh!\u201d Natasha shushed her friends when the name of the show disappeared from the screen and the blonde host showed, smiling in greeting.<br><br>\u201c<i>Welcome to the Celebrity Couples Interview! This time we have a real treat for you, the first superhero couple who public deemed with the proud name Superhusbands, also known as Stony\u2014</i>\u201d<br><br>\u201cAw, Stony is a cute name,\u201d Sam laughed, sending Steve a wide smile. \u201cKinda makes you imagine stone statues of you two all over New York.\u201d<br><br>\u201cNo,\u201d Steve said quickly, shaking his head for double emphasis, just at the moment Tony opened his mouth. No statues. <br><br>\u201cIt is a noble term, my friends,\u201d Thor rumbled from his favorite armchair.<br><br>\u201cHey, there goes Steve!\u201d Sam yelled, ceasing the chatter and pointing at the screen with the image of a path in the park. It was almost empty and the sun wasn\u2019t too high yet and dew was sparkling on the grass.<br><br>\u201c<i>Hey! There he is! Go go go!</i>\u201d<br><br>The camera angle changed and the pace quickened as two people started running. Soon, Steve\u2019s silhouette appeared in the camera\u2019s view, as he was during his morning jog, wearing a grey, clingy t-shirt and drawstring pants.<br><br>The team whistled, and Steve blushed a bit at that. Captain America looked good in tight clothes.<br><br>\u201c<i>Captain! Captain Rogers! May we have a word with you?!</i>\u201d<br><br>Steve turned around, temporarily jogging in place, blinking surprised at the camera. Usually when people jog they turn red and sweaty and disgusting. Steve wasn\u2019t one of them. His face was just a bit pink, and his hair got a little bit damp near the hairline. His lips were flushed, as Steve had a habit of licking his lips while working out. It wasn\u2019t a typical workout look. Steve looked hot and sweet, like a freshly baked cinabbon. <br><br>\u201cThat\u2019s my husband,\u201d Tony said proudly, grunting at the elbow aimed at his stomach from the said husband.<br><br>Back on the screen, Steve showed all of his teeth in a wide smile, a quite unusual reaction at seeing a camera when it came to him. <br><br>\u201c<i>Sure! If you can catch me, that is!</i>\u201d after the words, Steve turned around and zoomed out from the view, camera soon on him, showing his silhouette getting smaller and smaller.<br><br>\u201c<i>Noo! Captain, please wait!</i>\u201d more footsteps and the clinking of high heels the presenter wore was perfectly hearable. The image of the presenter and cameraman, chasing Captain America made the team laugh.<br><br>\u201cLittle shit,\u201d Sam commented the behavior and Tony smiled at Steve\u2019s mischievous, yet somehow proud smile. <br><br>\u201c<i>Mister Stark!</i>\u201d<br><br>The TV showed Tony, walking out of one of the coffee places in downtown, holding a stainless steel coffee cup with an outline of Captain America shield pressed on the side. He was in a formal, dark blue suit, with a white shirt underneath and a tie. There was even a handkerchief in his breast pocket, and the look was completed with expensive sunglasses and even more expensive wristwatch, matching the whole set. A true businessman at his finest.<br><br>\u201cOh, were you between meetings?\u201d Steve asked, and Tony paused for a second, before looking away.<br><br>\u201cYeah, between meetings,\u201d Tony agreed, not sounding too convincing and Steve only narrowed eyes. Tony better hope that Pepper was not watching this show.<br><br>\u201c<i>Mister Stark, can we have a word with you?</i>\u201d<br><br>The on-screen Tony slowly lowered his sunglasses, brown eyes sparkling in the sun. He smiled slowly, one corner of his lips going higher than the other, accented by the sharp and fresh angles of his goatee.<br><br>\u201c<i>Sure.</i>\u201d<br><br>\u201cYou would just agree to anything to stay away from SI meetings,\u201d Natasha chimed in, clearly seeing how on-screen Tony planned to take his sweet time with answering questions and having an excuse for being late. <br><br>\u201cTime for the questions!\u201d Wanda called, holding a bowl of popcorn for her and Pietro to share. The formula of the show was with the presenter asking questions sent by fans to the couple in a separate time and finding out if the answers matched. Sometimes there was some task at the end, but not always. <br><br>\u201c<i>What would your partner take with him to a deserted island?</i>\u201d<br><br>The first question showed on the screen on a polka dot background, written out in colorful letters. Classic one, really.<br><br>Steve was the first one to answer. The cameraman finally caught on him, and the interview was filmed with Steve leaning over a barrier, on a background of rising sun and its reflection in a nearby pond. The sun rays sparkled in Steve\u2019s hair and the blue in his eyes looked calm, giving a serene feeling. <br><br>\u201cHey, he is not blushing and stuttering,\u201d Bucky complained, disappointed with the lack of Steve\u2019s usual nervousness in front of the camera. On contrary, his friend looked good and surprisingly relaxed.<br><br>\u201cMaybe they photoshopped him,\u201d Sam said, getting a chuckle out of the team.<br><br>\u201cIt is just good camera work,\u201d Tony added, hearing Steve grunt behind him. \u201cWhat? We both know you get camera shy. Don\u2019t worry, not everyone can look so effortlessly pretty like me during filming.\u201d<br><br>\u201cEffortlessly,\u201d Steve repeated in a mocking voice. He knew first hand the long hours Tony spent in the bathroom each evening, rubbing numerous oils and lotions into different body parts. Tony just shook his head in warning, not allowing the other man to expand that topic.<br><br>\u201c<i>Well, Tony can make pretty amazing things from basically nothing\u2026</i>\u201d<br><br>The voice coming from the TV focused everyone\u2019s attention back on the screen. The on-screen Steve started to talk.<br><br>\u201c<i>I think he would take a rope, a knife and\u2014 that\u2019s it. That\u2019s all he needs. He could get the rest on the island.</i>\u201d<br><br>\u201cGood thing you didn\u2019t say matches, I could make a fire on my own,\u201d Tony grinned, pleased with the answer.<br><br>\u201cOf course you could,\u201d Steve agreed for the sake of agreeing, hearing a displeased murmur from their teammates. Where was the dirt?<br><br>\u201c<i>Hmmm\u2026 Steve would take\u2026</i>\u201d<br><br>The screen switched showing Tony. Everyone looked hopeful, hoping for some juicer answer.<br><br>\u201c<i>He would take a rope\u2014</i>\u201d<br><br>\u201cBoring!\u201d Clint hollered, as it seemed that the question would be answered in the same practical way as Steve did. <br><br>\u201c<i>\u2014 and lube and me.</i>\u201d<br><br>Oh.<br><br>\u201c<i>We would have some good time.</i>\u201d<br><br>The on-screen Tony nonchalantly sipped his coffee, while the real-life Tony opened his mouth in shock in a general murmur of approval coming from the team. He didn\u2019t remember saying that. Steve also gaped at the TV, feeling his face burn.<br><br>From that point, it only got worse. <br><br>\u201c<i>What is your favorite thing in your partner?</i>\u201d the second question showed in bold letters.<br><br>\u201c<i>Oh gosh,</i>\u201d Steve smiled sweetly and scratched the back of his head, looking shy. It would be innocent if the movement didn\u2019t pronounce his enormous biceps, which seemed like a very fan-service moment. \u201c<i>Tony is smart, caring and funny. He is a whole package. I love everything about him, so I guess Tony altogether is my favorite thing.</i>\u201d<br><br>\u201cSappy,\u201d Pietro gruffed, while Wanda cooed, like most of the team. Bucky made some gagging noise over the sweetness, and Steve aimed a light kick at his friend\u2019s back. <br><br>Then the TV showed Tony.<br><br>\u201c<i>His *BLEEP*,</i>\u201d the on-screen Tony blurted out without a second of hesitation. Although the word was censored, the mouth movement was clear and the whole team burst into laughter. \u201c<i>Okay, I am joking,</i>\u201d Tony backtracked, smiling charmingly. \u201c<i>His heart. He is a good man. But he does have an amazing *BLEEP*.</i>\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony asked in a shaky voice, getting nervous under Steve\u2019s reprimanding look. \u201cI fixed it!\u201d<br><br>\u201cYou definitely did,\u201d Clint cackled. <br><br>Steve feared for the last question. Well, not a question\u2026<br><br>\u201c<i>Whaaat?</i>\u201d the on-screen Steve laughed nervously, his eyes crinkling. \u201c<i>No, no way. I am not doing it.</i>\u201d<br><br>Ah, so it was a task.<br><br>\u201c<i>Really?</i>\u201d Tony said, lowering his sunglasses again. \u201c<i>You really want me to do it?</i>\u201d he asked, his smile and whole posture giving away that he would.<br><br>The team held its breath waiting for the reveal what the task could be.<br><br>On the screen on a cheerful background of colorful stripes showed the last question of the interview. A task. <br><br>\u201c<i>Pretend that what you are holding is your partner and make out with it.</i>\u201d<br><br>The on-screen Steve looked at the water bottle in his hand. <br><br>\u201c<i>No,</i>\u201d he denied taking part in the challenge looking harshly into the camera, an embarrassed smile quickly following. \u201c<i>No,</i>\u201d he repeated, shaking his head. <br><br>\u201c<i>Alright,</i>\u201d the on-screen Tony nodded enthusiastically. \u201c<i>Just come with the camera closer. Like, get my whole face in. Closer. Perfect.</i>\u201d<br><br>And so on the background of a busy New York street, Tony put the coffee cup closer to his face and closed his eyes. A tip of a pink tongue touched the bottom and then slowly traced all the way up, going up the middle of the shield on the cup, lingering at the rim and doing a half circle. Then he tipped the cup all the way up, holding it almost vertically, downing down the contents in big gulps, his neck stretched and Adam\u2019s apple moving temptingly.<br><br>The room turned very, very quiet. When Tony was done, he lowered the cup with a satisfied breath and wiped his shiny lips with a top of a hand. All the time looking into the camera.<br><br>There would be gifsets of this for sure all over the Internet soon.<br><br>The show was ending and the team started cheering and commenting, congratulating the couple a good show. Both Steve and Tony remained speechless, although for entirely different reasons. <br><br>Tony found himself burying his face into hands, a guilty aura all around him. He didn\u2019t remember that interview. He really didn\u2019t. He was caught off guard in an early hour. Maybe the coffee he was drinking was his first and Steve should know better than to let him out of the house without his morning coffee. Yes, he should just blame it all on Steve, it was a good plan\u2014<br><br>It was a terrible, terrible plan. He should man up and just apologize. And then call the network and cease the transmission and burn the tape. Maybe Pepper was already on it.<br><br>\u201cSteve, I\u2014\u201d Tony turned to his husband, a profound apology already forming on the tip of his tongue which he was not given a permission to say. There were hands on his cheeks, warm lips on his lips, and a tongue breaching in, claiming every inch. Through half-lidded eyes Tony saw how narrowed and dark Steve\u2019s eyes were, a clear sign of\u2014<br><br>Oh. Oooh.<br><br>Maybe he should give interviews while half asleep more often.<br><br>\u201cBooo! Get a room!\u201d<br><br>They didn\u2019t have to hear it twice. With a laugh, Tony felt himself being hoisted up and carried away bridal style by Steve, clearly in a hurry to get to their bedroom.<br><br>Tony couldn\u2019t stop the goofy smile.<br><br>\u201cYou are still in trouble for that interview,\u201d Steve huffed out, muting other voices and not paying attention to what their team was yelling after them.<br><br>\u201cOh, I know,\u201d Tony confirmed. He had a feeling it was a good kind of being in trouble. \u00a0<br></p>",

He smiled slowly, one corner of his lips going higher than the other, accented by the sharp and fresh angles of his goatee.<br><br>\u201c<i>Sure.</i>\u201d<br><br>\u201cYou would just agree to anything to stay away from SI meetings,\u201d Natasha chimed in, clearly seeing how on-screen Tony planned to take his sweet time with answering questions and having an excuse for being late. <br><br>\u201cTime for the questions!\u201d Wanda called, holding a bowl of popcorn for her and Pietro to share. The formula of the show was with the presenter asking questions sent by fans to the couple in a separate time and finding out if the answers matched. Sometimes there was some task at the end, but not always. <br><br>\u201c<i>What would your partner take with him to a deserted island?</i>\u201d<br><br>The first question showed on the screen on a polka dot background, written out in colorful letters. Classic one, really.<br><br>Steve was the first one to answer. The cameraman finally caught on him, and the interview was filmed with Steve leaning over a barrier, on a background of rising sun and its reflection in a nearby pond. The sun rays sparkled in Steve\u2019s hair and the blue in his eyes looked calm, giving a serene feeling. <br><br>\u201cHey, he is not blushing and stuttering,\u201d Bucky complained, disappointed with the lack of Steve\u2019s usual nervousness in front of the camera. On contrary, his friend looked good and surprisingly relaxed.<br><br>\u201cMaybe they photoshopped him,\u201d Sam said, getting a chuckle out of the team.<br><br>\u201cIt is just good camera work,\u201d Tony added, hearing Steve grunt behind him. \u201cWhat? We both know you get camera shy. Don\u2019t worry, not everyone can look so effortlessly pretty like me during filming.\u201d<br><br>\u201cEffortlessly,\u201d Steve repeated in a mocking voice. He knew first hand the long hours Tony spent in the bathroom each evening, rubbing numerous oils and lotions into different body parts. Tony just shook his head in warning, not allowing the other man to expand that topic.<br><br>\u201c<i>Well, Tony can make pretty amazing things from basically nothing\u2026</i>\u201d<br><br>The voice coming from the TV focused everyone\u2019s attention back on the screen. The on-screen Steve started to talk.<br><br>\u201c<i>I think he would take a rope, a knife and\u2014 that\u2019s it. That\u2019s all he needs. He could get the rest on the island.</i>\u201d<br><br>\u201cGood thing you didn\u2019t say matches, I could make a fire on my own,\u201d Tony grinned, pleased with the answer.<br><br>\u201cOf course you could,\u201d Steve agreed for the sake of agreeing, hearing a displeased murmur from their teammates. Where was the dirt?<br><br>\u201c<i>Hmmm\u2026 Steve would take\u2026</i>\u201d<br><br>The screen switched showing Tony. Everyone looked hopeful, hoping for some juicer answer.<br><br>\u201c<i>He would take a rope\u2014</i>\u201d<br><br>\u201cBoring!\u201d Clint hollered, as it seemed that the question would be answered in the same practical way as Steve did. <br><br>\u201c<i>\u2014 and lube and me.</i>\u201d<br><br>Oh.<br><br>\u201c<i>We would have some good time.</i>\u201d<br><br>The on-screen Tony nonchalantly sipped his coffee, while the real-life Tony opened his mouth in shock in a general murmur of approval coming from the team. He didn\u2019t remember saying that. Steve also gaped at the TV, feeling his face burn.<br><br>From that point, it only got worse. <br><br>\u201c<i>What is your favorite thing in your partner?</i>\u201d the second question showed in bold letters.<br><br>\u201c<i>Oh gosh,</i>\u201d Steve smiled sweetly and scratched the back of his head, looking shy. It would be innocent if the movement didn\u2019t pronounce his enormous biceps, which seemed like a very fan-service moment. \u201c<i>Tony is smart, caring and funny. He is a whole package. I love everything about him, so I guess Tony altogether is my favorite thing.</i>\u201d<br><br>\u201cSappy,\u201d Pietro gruffed, while Wanda cooed, like most of the team. Bucky made some gagging noise over the sweetness, and Steve aimed a light kick at his friend\u2019s back. <br><br>Then the TV showed Tony.<br><br>\u201c<i>His *BLEEP*,</i>\u201d the on-screen Tony blurted out without a second of hesitation. Although the word was censored, the mouth movement was clear and the whole team burst into laughter. \u201c<i>Okay, I am joking,</i>\u201d Tony backtracked, smiling charmingly. \u201c<i>His heart. He is a good man. But he does have an amazing *BLEEP*.</i>\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony asked in a shaky voice, getting nervous under Steve\u2019s reprimanding look. \u201cI fixed it!\u201d<br><br>\u201cYou definitely did,\u201d Clint cackled. <br><br>Steve feared for the last question. Well, not a question\u2026<br><br>\u201c<i>Whaaat?</i>\u201d the on-screen Steve laughed nervously, his eyes crinkling. \u201c<i>No, no way. I am not doing it.</i>\u201d<br><br>Ah, so it was a task.<br><br>\u201c<i>Really?</i>\u201d Tony said, lowering his sunglasses again. \u201c<i>You really want me to do it?</i>\u201d he asked, his smile and whole posture giving away that he would.<br><br>The team held its breath waiting for the reveal what the task could be.<br><br>On the screen on a cheerful background of colorful stripes showed the last question of the interview. A task. <br><br>\u201c<i>Pretend that what you are holding is your partner and make out with it.</i>\u201d<br><br>The on-screen Steve looked at the water bottle in his hand. <br><br>\u201c<i>No,</i>\u201d he denied taking part in the challenge looking harshly into the camera, an embarrassed smile quickly following. \u201c<i>No,</i>\u201d he repeated, shaking his head. <br><br>\u201c<i>Alright,</i>\u201d the on-screen Tony nodded enthusiastically. \u201c<i>Just come with the camera closer. Like, get my whole face in. Closer. Perfect.</i>\u201d<br><br>And so on the background of a busy New York street, Tony put the coffee cup closer to his face and closed his eyes. A tip of a pink tongue touched the bottom and then slowly traced all the way up, going up the middle of the shield on the cup, lingering at the rim and doing a half circle. Then he tipped the cup all the way up, holding it almost vertically, downing down the contents in big gulps, his neck stretched and Adam\u2019s apple moving temptingly.<br><br>The room turned very, very quiet. When Tony was done, he lowered the cup with a satisfied breath and wiped his shiny lips with a top of a hand. All the time looking into the camera.<br><br>There would be gifsets of this for sure all over the Internet soon.<br><br>The show was ending and the team started cheering and commenting, congratulating the couple a good show. Both Steve and Tony remained speechless, although for entirely different reasons. <br><br>Tony found himself burying his face into hands, a guilty aura all around him. He didn\u2019t remember that interview. He really didn\u2019t. He was caught off guard in an early hour. Maybe the coffee he was drinking was his first and Steve should know better than to let him out of the house without his morning coffee. Yes, he should just blame it all on Steve, it was a good plan\u2014<br><br>It was a terrible, terrible plan. He should man up and just apologize. And then call the network and cease the transmission and burn the tape. Maybe Pepper was already on it.<br><br>\u201cSteve, I\u2014\u201d Tony turned to his husband, a profound apology already forming on the tip of his tongue which he was not given a permission to say. There were hands on his cheeks, warm lips on his lips, and a tongue breaching in, claiming every inch. Through half-lidded eyes Tony saw how narrowed and dark Steve\u2019s eyes were, a clear sign of\u2014<br><br>Oh. Oooh.<br><br>Maybe he should give interviews while half asleep more often.<br><br>\u201cBooo! Get a room!\u201d<br><br>They didn\u2019t have to hear it twice. With a laugh, Tony felt himself being hoisted up and carried away bridal style by Steve, clearly in a hurry to get to their bedroom.<br><br>Tony couldn\u2019t stop the goofy smile.<br><br>\u201cYou are still in trouble for that interview,\u201d Steve huffed out, muting other voices and not paying attention to what their team was yelling after them.<br><br>\u201cOh, I know,\u201d Tony confirmed. He had a feeling it was a good kind of being in trouble. \u00a0<br></p>",

The show opened with glimpses of interviews, showing funny or memorable moments in a retrospective, many famous faces appearing on the screen.<br /><br />&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you don&rsquo;t remember giving this interview,&rdquo; Steve murmured, looking at his husband with gentle bewilderment, that hid a lot of fondness. Actually, he could believe that. Tony seemed to never pay a lot of mind about what he was telling to the press, almost as if he didn&rsquo;t have any filter. He probably didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Tony called, mouth stretched into a smile, as he was safely nestled in Steve&rsquo;s arms, the couple taking up their favorite spot on the couch. &ldquo;I give a lot of interviews, don&rsquo;t expect me to remember each and one of them&mdash;&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Hope you said some dirty details!&rdquo; Clint grinned, making himself more comfortable between Nat and Bruce, the three of them seated on the second couch. <br /><br />&ldquo;Thought you hated hearing about that,&rdquo; Natasha pointed out.<br /><br />&ldquo;No, I hate when I walk on them because neither of them can keep it in their pants. Hearing about it on national TV is different.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t count on it, Tony is always so suave and discreet,&rdquo; Bruce added in a serious tone, that contradicted a teasing smile. <br /><br />&ldquo;Unlike Steve. He can&rsquo;t handle a camera in his face,&rdquo; Bucky murmured from his splayed on the floor position, with his face smushed into Sam&rsquo;s bicep. The Winter Soldier didn&rsquo;t sleep well in the last days. <br /><br />Sam laughed, jostling Bucky a bit who grumbled loudly in protest. Like a sleepy bear. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t wait to see him get all red and splutter words out. Please tell me that will happen.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Hey, shhh!&rdquo; Natasha shushed her friends when the name of the show disappeared from the screen and the blonde host showed, smiling in greeting.<br /><br />&ldquo;<i>Welcome to the Celebrity Couples Interview! This time we have a real treat for you, the first superhero couple who public deemed with the proud name Superhusbands, also known as Stony&mdash;</i>&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Aw, Stony is a cute name,&rdquo; Sam laughed, sending Steve a wide smile. &ldquo;Kinda makes you imagine stone statues of you two all over New York.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Steve said quickly, shaking his head for double emphasis, just at the moment Tony opened his mouth. No statues. <br /><br />&ldquo;It is a noble term, my friends,&rdquo; Thor rumbled from his favorite armchair.<br /><br />&ldquo;Hey, there goes Steve!&rdquo; Sam yelled, ceasing the chatter and pointing at the screen with the image of a path in the park. It was almost empty and the sun wasn&rsquo;t too high yet and dew was sparkling on the grass.<br /><br />&ldquo;<i>Hey! There he is! Go go go!</i>&rdquo;<br /><br />The camera angle changed and the pace quickened as two people started running. Soon, Steve&rsquo;s silhouette appeared in the camera&rsquo;s view, as he was during his morning jog, wearing a grey, clingy t-shirt and drawstring pants.<br /><br />The team whistled, and Steve blushed a bit at that. Captain America looked good in tight clothes.<br /><br />&ldquo;<i>Captain! Captain Rogers! May we have a word with you?!</i>&rdquo;<br /><br />Steve turned around, temporarily jogging in place, blinking surprised at the camera. Usually when people jog they turn red and sweaty and disgusting. Steve wasn&rsquo;t one of them. His face was just a bit pink, and his hair got a little bit damp near the hairline. His lips were flushed, as Steve had a habit of licking his lips while working out. It wasn&rsquo;t a typical workout look. Steve looked hot and sweet, like a freshly baked cinabbon. <br /><br />&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my husband,&rdquo; Tony said proudly, grunting at the elbow aimed at his stomach from the said husband.<br /><br />Back on the screen, Steve showed all of his teeth in a wide smile, a quite unusual reaction at seeing a camera when it came to him. <br /><br />&ldquo;<i>Sure! If you can catch me, that is!</i>&rdquo; after the words, Steve turned around and zoomed out from the view, camera soon on him, showing his silhouette getting smaller and smaller.<br /><br />&ldquo;<i>Noo! Captain, please wait!</i>&rdquo; more footsteps and the clinking of high heels the presenter wore was perfectly hearable. The image of the presenter and cameraman, chasing Captain America made the team laugh.<br /><br />&ldquo;Little shit,&rdquo; Sam commented the behavior and Tony smiled at Steve&rsquo;s mischievous, yet somehow proud smile. <br /><br />&ldquo;<i>Mister Stark!</i>&rdquo;<br /><br />The TV showed Tony, walking out of one of the coffee places in downtown, holding a stainless steel coffee cup with an outline of Captain America shield pressed on the side. He was in a formal, dark blue suit, with a white shirt underneath and a tie. There was even a handkerchief in his breast pocket, and the look was completed with expensive sunglasses and even more expensive wristwatch, matching the whole set. A true businessman at his finest.<br /><br />&ldquo;Oh, were you between meetings?&rdquo; Steve asked, and Tony paused for a second, before looking away.<br /><br />&ldquo;Yeah, between meetings,&rdquo; Tony agreed, not sounding too convincing and Steve only narrowed eyes. Tony better hope that Pepper was not watching this show.<br /><br />&ldquo;<i>Mister Stark, can we have a word with you?</i>&rdquo;<br /><br />The on-screen Tony slowly lowered his sunglasses, brown eyes sparkling in the sun. He smiled slowly, one corner of his lips going higher than the other, accented by the sharp and fresh angles of his goatee.<br /><br />&ldquo;<i>Sure.</i>&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;You would just agree to anything to stay away from SI meetings,&rdquo; Natasha chimed in, clearly seeing how on-screen Tony planned to take his sweet time with answering questions and having an excuse for being late. <br /><br />&ldquo;Time for the questions!&rdquo; Wanda called, holding a bowl of popcorn for her and Pietro to share. The formula of the show was with the presenter asking questions sent by fans to the couple in a separate time and finding out if the answers matched.
