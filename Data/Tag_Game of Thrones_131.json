        "answer": "<p><b>my time has come</b><br/></p><p>Sansa\n starts out as a young, pampered 13 year old girl, who was born to a wealthy, \npowerful, respected family. She was raised to believe in very specific \n(feminine) parameters of who she should be, what she should want, and \nwhat she should do. And she was <i>good</i> (if not great) at everything she was taught to be and do.</p><p>So,\n like a high-class girl raised the way she was raised, she got the \nattention of a prince and wanted to be a princess; she was a romantic \nwho believed in knights and songs and - of course, that\u2019s what she \nwanted. And no, she didn\u2019t think critically about political or social \nmatters at that time - not because she <i>couldn\u2019t</i> but because she was never taught that she should. <br/></p><p>And yes, in season one when she was a child, she made mistakes because she <i>was</i> spoiled and could be bratty. And yes, her mistakes did contribute to some of the events that followed, like her father\u2019s fate (but honestly, his death was essentially sealed no matter what because of what a psychopath Joffrey was). And my god, did she pay for it. <br/></p><p>She was forced - literally <i>held up - </i>to watch her father get beheaded in front of her while she screams and cries and eventually passes out from the trauma of it. <br/></p><p>Then she\u2019s held hostage in King\u2019s Landing, a place so very, very far from home, with the family who is literally killing her own. Physically abused by adult men, emotionally and mentally abused (including forced to look at her father and septa\u2019s beheaded heads). Is forced to constantly put-down and renounce her family as traitors when all she wants is to see them again. <br/></p><p>She finds out that her ancestral family <i>home</i> is taken from her family, that her little brothers are dead (yes we know they aren\u2019t but she doesn\u2019t). She\u2019s forced to marry a man over twice her age. She hears about how her brother and mother - the last hope she had to come and rescue her - are brutally murdered. <br/></p><p>And not only has to hear about it, but is literally forced to live with the people responsible for killing her entire family. The people who rub her face in the fact that not only is her family dead but that <i>they</i> killed them, who make her watch plays and sing songs glorifying the death of everyone she loved. <br/></p><p>All of this while she is only a teenager. <br/></p><p>You know what she does? She survives. <br/></p><p>She wields her courtesy like armor; she holds her tongue when she wants to lash out and puts up a facade that she isn\u2019t breaking inside. <br/></p><p>She starts learning to use her words as her weapons. When Joffrey taunts her, she gives subtle reserved rejoinders that insult him just enough to toe the line (Joffrey: I\u2019ll tell you \nwhat. I\u2019m going to give you a present. After I raise my armies and kill \nyour traitor brother, I\u2019ll give you his head as well. <br/>Sansa: Or maybe he\u2019ll give me yours.)<br/></p><p>She adapts and evolves in a world where she feels incredibly alone. Not only alone but feels guilty and <i>stupid.</i><br/></p><p>Then she leaves King\u2019s Landing - after being framed for murder - and is taken into the custody of a creepy man who was in love with her mother and is now in love with her (ugh) and yet, he is all she has at the time to rely on. And from there?</p><p>She learns even more; she starts to understand truly how to move the pieces of the game that she\u2019s been thrown into. <br/></p><p>But before she even has a say in her own life, she gets brought to Winterfell and is forced to be there with the family who betrayed hers and helped lead them to their deaths before <i>stealing their home</i>. She\u2019s forced to marry the craziest, most monstrous character on the entire show (a man who rapes her, who locks her in a room, who plays mind games with her).</p><p>And, she never backs down from him \u2013 making comments to plant seeds of doubt about his status as a bastard, \u201cI am Sansa Stark of Winterfell. This is my home. And you can\u2019t frighten me.\u201d<br/></p><p>Still, she survives. She jumps off of a literal fucking castle to escape him, goes through feet of snow, through frozen waters and escapes him. <br/></p><p>And when she\u2019s finally reunited with her remaining family and Jon presents her with the opportunity to run away from this mess - because he is sick of fighting - it\u2019s Sansa who now has grown this spine of steel. It\u2019s Sansa who stands up for herself, to all of the men in the room who are older who are more familiar with wars and fighting, and asserts that she needs to take the Stark home back from the monster who lives there. <br/></p><p>Who wins that war against Ramsay Bolton? Yes Jon - at Sansa\u2019s insistence and while also not consulting her - fought in the war, but he would have been dead if Sansa hadn\u2019t gotten the soldiers from the Vale to help them.</p><p>Let\u2019s take the moment to reflect on that, too \u2013 Sansa wanted nothing more in the beginning of the show to leave the North. That the North was boring, wanted a new life, wanted to go south, and now? Now all she wants is her home. The home she left behind became all she longed for (it\u2019s also why I\u2019m so absolutely bullshit about Jon bending the knee and giving the North to Dany without even <i>consulting</i> Sansa).<br/></p><p>In the end, it\u2019s Sansa - the Northern girl who wanted nothing more than to leave the North when she was a child - who wins back the Stark home. It\u2019s Sansa who underwent that development, that growth, to appreciate where she was from and the life she used to have. <br/></p><p>And it\u2019s also Sansa who has the knowledge and the understanding of politics, now, to actually rule the North when the Starks take back Winterfell, let\u2019s be real. Sansa knows how to play the game, now. She knows how to manipulate and how to be diplomatic and how to reign in her emotions. <br/></p><p>She plays Littlefinger - one of the smartest players in the game - like a fiddle, using the knowledge she took partly from him, while also cutting him off at the knees with the wit and cutting remarks that she\u2019s learned over the years (\u201cNo need to seize the last word, Lord Baelish. I\u2019ll assume it was something clever.\u201d)</p><p>When he tries to manipulate her in the last season? She saw through it and orchestrated a plan to double-cross <i>him</i>. Her last words to him - \n\u201cI\u2019m a slow learner, it\u2019s true. But I learn. Thank you for all your many lessons, Lord Baelish. I will never forget them.\u201d before she gives the nod for Arya to fucking kill him in a court Sansa called?! <br/></p><p>A Fucking Queen. <br/></p><p>(though I will always contest that she is a slow learner; she was learning and surviving on the tips of her toes at every turn since the end of the first season)<br/></p><p>Sansa went through <i>hell</i> and clawed her way back. She did start off as a spoiled child, and she more than paid any kind of \u201cprice.\u201d <br/></p><p>Sansa lost everything, was held captive, and survived by learning. Using her mind, her words, her politics. She isn\u2019t like Arya and Jon and Bran who had the ability to physically leave the bad situation she was stuck in and find her own path. She isn\u2019t like them in that she doesn\u2019t have the ability to physically <i>fight</i> back. <br/></p><p>She is flawed, she\u2019s made mistakes, she\u2019s human. But she has grown. She\u2019s learned from her - and other people\u2019s - mistakes, to become a smart, willful, strategic, diplomatic leader. She takes the best parts of her parents (their courage, their intelligence, their loyalty) and can look back and understand the mistakes they made to try to make sure she and her siblings don\u2019t repeat them.</p><p>Sansa Stark is a beautiful, strong, well-developed character, and she deserves the world. <br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"741\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f523bf6fa42c56b1711d8573abc0b74d/tumblr_inline_pl24fzyXgw1rdq1qe_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"741\"/></figure>",

She was raised to believe in very specific \n(feminine) parameters of who she should be, what she should want, and \nwhat she should do. And she was <i>good</i> (if not great) at everything she was taught to be and do.</p><p>So,\n like a high-class girl raised the way she was raised, she got the \nattention of a prince and wanted to be a princess; she was a romantic \nwho believed in knights and songs and - of course, that\u2019s what she \nwanted. And no, she didn\u2019t think critically about political or social \nmatters at that time - not because she <i>couldn\u2019t</i> but because she was never taught that she should. <br></p><p>And yes, in season one when she was a child, she made mistakes because she <i>was</i> spoiled and could be bratty. And yes, her mistakes did contribute to some of the events that followed, like her father\u2019s fate (but honestly, his death was essentially sealed no matter what because of what a psychopath Joffrey was). And my god, did she pay for it. <br></p><p>She was forced - literally <i>held up - </i>to watch her father get beheaded in front of her while she screams and cries and eventually passes out from the trauma of it. <br></p><p>Then she\u2019s held hostage in King\u2019s Landing, a place so very, very far from home, with the family who is literally killing her own. Physically abused by adult men, emotionally and mentally abused (including forced to look at her father and septa\u2019s beheaded heads). Is forced to constantly put-down and renounce her family as traitors when all she wants is to see them again. <br></p><p>She finds out that her ancestral family <i>home</i> is taken from her family, that her little brothers are dead (yes we know they aren\u2019t but she doesn\u2019t). She\u2019s forced to marry a man over twice her age. She hears about how her brother and mother - the last hope she had to come and rescue her - are brutally murdered. <br></p><p>And not only has to hear about it, but is literally forced to live with the people responsible for killing her entire family. The people who rub her face in the fact that not only is her family dead but that <i>they</i> killed them, who make her watch plays and sing songs glorifying the death of everyone she loved. <br></p><p>All of this while she is only a teenager. <br></p><p>You know what she does? She survives. <br></p><p>She wields her courtesy like armor; she holds her tongue when she wants to lash out and puts up a facade that she isn\u2019t breaking inside. <br></p><p>She starts learning to use her words as her weapons. When Joffrey taunts her, she gives subtle reserved rejoinders that insult him just enough to toe the line (Joffrey: I\u2019ll tell you \nwhat. I\u2019m going to give you a present. After I raise my armies and kill \nyour traitor brother, I\u2019ll give you his head as well. <br>Sansa: Or maybe he\u2019ll give me yours.)<br></p><p>She adapts and evolves in a world where she feels incredibly alone. Not only alone but feels guilty and <i>stupid.</i><br></p><p>Then she leaves King\u2019s Landing - after being framed for murder - and is taken into the custody of a creepy man who was in love with her mother and is now in love with her (ugh) and yet, he is all she has at the time to rely on. And from there?</p><p>She learns even more; she starts to understand truly how to move the pieces of the game that she\u2019s been thrown into. <br></p><p>But before she even has a say in her own life, she gets brought to Winterfell and is forced to be there with the family who betrayed hers and helped lead them to their deaths before <i>stealing their home</i>. She\u2019s forced to marry the craziest, most monstrous character on the entire show (a man who rapes her, who locks her in a room, who plays mind games with her).</p><p>And, she never backs down from him \u2013 making comments to plant seeds of doubt about his status as a bastard, \u201cI am Sansa Stark of Winterfell. This is my home. And you can\u2019t frighten me.\u201d<br></p><p>Still, she survives. She jumps off of a literal fucking castle to escape him, goes through feet of snow, through frozen waters and escapes him. <br></p><p>And when she\u2019s finally reunited with her remaining family and Jon presents her with the opportunity to run away from this mess - because he is sick of fighting - it\u2019s Sansa who now has grown this spine of steel. It\u2019s Sansa who stands up for herself, to all of the men in the room who are older who are more familiar with wars and fighting, and asserts that she needs to take the Stark home back from the monster who lives there. <br></p><p>Who wins that war against Ramsay Bolton? Yes Jon - at Sansa\u2019s insistence and while also not consulting her - fought in the war, but he would have been dead if Sansa hadn\u2019t gotten the soldiers from the Vale to help them.</p><p>Let\u2019s take the moment to reflect on that, too \u2013 Sansa wanted nothing more in the beginning of the show to leave the North. That the North was boring, wanted a new life, wanted to go south, and now? Now all she wants is her home. The home she left behind became all she longed for (it\u2019s also why I\u2019m so absolutely bullshit about Jon bending the knee and giving the North to Dany without even <i>consulting</i> Sansa).<br></p><p>In the end, it\u2019s Sansa - the Northern girl who wanted nothing more than to leave the North when she was a child - who wins back the Stark home. It\u2019s Sansa who underwent that development, that growth, to appreciate where she was from and the life she used to have. <br></p><p>And it\u2019s also Sansa who has the knowledge and the understanding of politics, now, to actually rule the North when the Starks take back Winterfell, let\u2019s be real. Sansa knows how to play the game, now. She knows how to manipulate and how to be diplomatic and how to reign in her emotions. <br></p><p>She plays Littlefinger - one of the smartest players in the game - like a fiddle, using the knowledge she took partly from him, while also cutting him off at the knees with the wit and cutting remarks that she\u2019s learned over the years (\u201cNo need to seize the last word, Lord Baelish. I\u2019ll assume it was something clever.\u201d)</p><p>When he tries to manipulate her in the last season? She saw through it and orchestrated a plan to double-cross <i>him</i>. Her last words to him - \n\u201cI\u2019m a slow learner, it\u2019s true. But I learn. Thank you for all your many lessons, Lord Baelish. I will never forget them.\u201d before she gives the nod for Arya to fucking kill him in a court Sansa called?! <br></p><p>A Fucking Queen. <br></p><p>(though I will always contest that she is a slow learner; she was learning and surviving on the tips of her toes at every turn since the end of the first season)<br></p><p>Sansa went through <i>hell</i> and clawed her way back. She did start off as a spoiled child, and she more than paid any kind of \u201cprice.\u201d <br></p><p>Sansa lost everything, was held captive, and survived by learning. Using her mind, her words, her politics. She isn\u2019t like Arya and Jon and Bran who had the ability to physically leave the bad situation she was stuck in and find her own path. She isn\u2019t like them in that she doesn\u2019t have the ability to physically <i>fight</i> back. <br></p><p>She is flawed, she\u2019s made mistakes, she\u2019s human. But she has grown. She\u2019s learned from her - and other people\u2019s - mistakes, to become a smart, willful, strategic, diplomatic leader. She takes the best parts of her parents (their courage, their intelligence, their loyalty) and can look back and understand the mistakes they made to try to make sure she and her siblings don\u2019t repeat them.</p><p>Sansa Stark is a beautiful, strong, well-developed character, and she deserves the world. <br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"741\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f523bf6fa42c56b1711d8573abc0b74d/tumblr_inline_pl24fzyXgw1rdq1qe_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"741\"></figure></p>",
