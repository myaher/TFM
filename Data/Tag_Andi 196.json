He swore it was far too early to be this cold outside, and spent a moment silently cursing American midwestern weather.<br/><br/>\u201cHey, Cy!\u201d Andi jogged up to him, and Cyrus hugged her hello.<br/><br/>\u201cHey, Andi! Happy, like, almost birthday!\u201d he exclaimed.<br/><br/>\u201cYou do know you\u2019re like two weeks early, right?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cWell, yeah. But I\u2019m within the month! Plus, you and Buffy always get three weeks of birthday celebration- two weeks before your birthdays and one after!\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cYou\u2019re a ridiculously good friend,\u201d Andi said, leading him towards their seats as Bowie jogged onstage to announce the singing competition. Cyrus took a seat in between Buffy and TJ, Amber and Andi to his right, on the other side of Buffy.<br/><br/>\u201cHey, everybody! Welcome to the First Annual Probably Never to Happen Again Red Rooster Singing Competition!\u201d Bowie greeted cheerily, a clipboard under his arm. \u201cWe have a lot of great acts on the list today, starting with\u2026 Jonah Beck!\u201d<br/><br/>Jonah walked onstage, guitar in hand as he sat down.<br/><br/>\u201cHey everybody, this is an original song,\u201d he said as he began to strum his guitar.<br/><br/>To Cyrus\u2019s relief, Jonah managed to get through the entire performance without a glance in Andi\u2019s direction, or even a particularly familiar line. The competition continued for nearly an hour, before Bowie stepped onstage to announce the last act.<br/><br/>\u201cAlright, last but not least, Cyrus Goodman and TJ Kippen!\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cWhoa, plot twist,\u201d Buffy whispered, turning to look in wonder at Cyrus, who was staring at TJ.<br/><br/>\u201cWhat did you do?!\u201d he hissed. TJ shrugged, his eyes wide as he spluttered something about not having had anything to do with this. Cyrus slowly turned around to stare at Andi, who was currently grinning sheepishly at them.<br/><br/>\u201cAndi!\u201d<br/><br/>\u201c\u2026For my birthday?\u201d Andi asked with a grin. Cyrus huffed, turning to TJ.<br/><br/>\u201cWhat do you say to singing a duet?\u201d</p><hr><p>\u201cSo\u2026 what are you two singing?\u201d Bowie asked as Cyrus and TJ reluctantly took the stage.<br/><br/>\u201cI- I have no idea,\u201d Cyrus stuttered, looking to Andi, who quickly stood up from her seat. She whispered something in Bowie\u2019s ear, and her dad nodded, gesturing something to someone behind him before turning back to Cyrus and TJ. <br/><br/>\u201cWell, break a leg?\u201d he offered, before jogging offstage. Cyrus and TJ\u2019s eyes both widened as the beginning notes of Can\u2019t Help Falling in Love played over the music shop. <br/><br/>\u2018What do we do?\u2019 Cyrus mouthed frantically to TJ, who shrugged and opened his mouth to sing.</p><hr><p>They miraculously made it through the song, staring at each other the entire time, without a single glance at the crowd. Unbeknownst to them, the entirety of the crowd was cooing over their clear chemistry. <br/><br/>When they walked offstage, handing the microphones to Bowie, Buffy and Andi were staring intensely at TJ and Amber at Cyrus.<br/><br/>\u201cAre you seeing this?\u201d TJ asked quietly.<br/><br/>\u201cOh I\u2019m seeing this,\u201d Cyrus responded, leading TJ back to their seats. Bowie stepped back onstage after a few moments of talking to someone whom Cyrus presumed was a judge. <br/><br/>\u201cAlright, everybody! We\u2019ve made our decision!\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cis it just me or is this the worst planned competition ever conceived?\u201d Cyrus whispered to TJ.<br/><br/>\u201cOh, it\u2019s definitely not just you.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cAnd the runner-up is\u2026\u201d Bowie paused for dramatic effect. \u201cJonah Beck!\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cDocious,\u201d Jonah said from the second row, letting his mom pull him into a hug.<br/><br/>\u201cGreat job, Jonah! And the winner, and recipient of 50 dollars-the winners, actually, are\u2026Cyrus Goodman and TJ Kippen!\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Cyrus whispered, hugging TJ in disbelief. When he pulled away, TJ, overcome with excitement, kissed him. He held Cyrus\u2019s jaw as the younger instinctively wrapped his arms around his neck. They were luckily about the same height sitting down, so Cyrus\u2019s neck didn\u2019t suffer too terribly.<br/><br/>\u201cAndi,\u201d Bowie hissed, crouching next to her as TJ and Cyrus kissed.<br/><br/>\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cAm I supposed to interrupt them to give them the 50 bucks or\u2026?\u201d <br/></p>",

                "content": "<p>Cyrus stepped into the Red Rooster, slowly beginning to thaw the chill that had settled into his bones as he searched for Andi. He swore it was far too early to be this cold outside, and spent a moment silently cursing American midwestern weather.<br /><br />&ldquo;Hey, Cy!&rdquo; Andi jogged up to him, and Cyrus hugged her hello.<br /><br />&ldquo;Hey, Andi! Happy, like, almost birthday!&rdquo; he exclaimed.<br /><br />&ldquo;You do know you&rsquo;re like two weeks early, right?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Well, yeah. But I&rsquo;m within the month! Plus, you and Buffy always get three weeks of birthday celebration- two weeks before your birthdays and one after!&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a ridiculously good friend,&rdquo; Andi said, leading him towards their seats as Bowie jogged onstage to announce the singing competition. Cyrus took a seat in between Buffy and TJ, Amber and Andi to his right, on the other side of Buffy.<br /><br />&ldquo;Hey, everybody! Welcome to the First Annual Probably Never to Happen Again Red Rooster Singing Competition!&rdquo; Bowie greeted cheerily, a clipboard under his arm. &ldquo;We have a lot of great acts on the list today, starting with&hellip; Jonah Beck!&rdquo;<br /><br />Jonah walked onstage, guitar in hand as he sat down.<br /><br />&ldquo;Hey everybody, this is an original song,&rdquo; he said as he began to strum his guitar.<br /><br />To Cyrus&rsquo;s relief, Jonah managed to get through the entire performance without a glance in Andi&rsquo;s direction, or even a particularly familiar line. The competition continued for nearly an hour, before Bowie stepped onstage to announce the last act.<br /><br />&ldquo;Alright, last but not least, Cyrus Goodman and TJ Kippen!&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Whoa, plot twist,&rdquo; Buffy whispered, turning to look in wonder at Cyrus, who was staring at TJ.<br /><br />&ldquo;What did you do?!&rdquo; he hissed. TJ shrugged, his eyes wide as he spluttered something about not having had anything to do with this. Cyrus slowly turned around to stare at Andi, who was currently grinning sheepishly at them.<br /><br />&ldquo;Andi!&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;&hellip;For my birthday?&rdquo; Andi asked with a grin. Cyrus huffed, turning to TJ.<br /><br />&ldquo;What do you say to singing a duet?&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;So&hellip; what are you two singing?&rdquo; Bowie asked as Cyrus and TJ reluctantly took the stage.<br /><br />&ldquo;I- I have no idea,&rdquo; Cyrus stuttered, looking to Andi, who quickly stood up from her seat. She whispered something in Bowie&rsquo;s ear, and her dad nodded, gesturing something to someone behind him before turning back to Cyrus and TJ. <br /><br />&ldquo;Well, break a leg?&rdquo; he offered, before jogging offstage. Cyrus and TJ&rsquo;s eyes both widened as the beginning notes of Can&rsquo;t Help Falling in Love played over the music shop. <br /><br />&lsquo;What do we do?&rsquo; Cyrus mouthed frantically to TJ, who shrugged and opened his mouth to sing.</p><hr /><p>They miraculously made it through the song, staring at each other the entire time, without a single glance at the crowd. Unbeknownst to them, the entirety of the crowd was cooing over their clear chemistry. <br /><br />When they walked offstage, handing the microphones to Bowie, Buffy and Andi were staring intensely at TJ and Amber at Cyrus.<br /><br />&ldquo;Are you seeing this?&rdquo; TJ asked quietly.<br /><br />&ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m seeing this,&rdquo; Cyrus responded, leading TJ back to their seats.

When Cyrus\u2019 mother\n learns \u00a0that this kid might be rolling with the wrong crowds, she \ndecides that \u00a0it\u2019s best that the two of them stop hanging out, \ndetermined to remain \u00a0friends, Cyrus and the new boy, TJ, create their \nown club called TJ and \u00a0Cyrus\u2019 Totally No Fun Club, an undercover tutor \nclub, where they \u00a0actually go on adventures, get into some not too \ntroublesome trouble, \u00a0and fall in love. <br/></p><!-- more --><p>The days that followed were nothing short of exciting in every \nsecond. Cyrus felt as if he\u2019d been reborn into a world that flipped \nupside down from his own. His shoulders weren\u2019t tense anymore, and he \nsuddenly had all the energy in the world. He\u2019d stay up all hours of the \nnight talking to TJ via walkie talkies while they\u2019d make funny faces at \neach other from the window.</p><p>It was nearly 3am, and Cyrus was still wide awake, sitting propped up by his window, cozied up in his dinosaur pajamas. </p><p>\u201cGetting tired yet, Goodman?\u201d TJ teased, the crackle of static following.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 heart swam. \u201cIn your dreams, Kippen.\u201d He replied, his cheeks growing suddenly warm. </p><p>\u201cI think you mean in your dreams, you know, because you\u2019re about to fall asleep.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus didn\u2019t have a reply. Instead he sank his face into his curtains, in vein attempt to wash away the heat. </p><p>\u201cCy,\n I just got a text from Reed.\u201d TJ crackled. Well that worked, Cyrus \nthought, because all of a sudden his chest wasn\u2019t flipping. \u201cHe wants to\n meet up right now.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus popped up through his window, facing \nTJ. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that sound a little weird to you? Like it\u2019s the worst \npossible idea ever?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDude,\u201d TJ said into the device. \u201cThis is \nReed we\u2019re talking about. He\u2019s always weird. Get ready, b\u2019cause we\u2019re \nleaving in five.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus gulped, looking at his clock. Maybe TJ \nwas right. All Reed had been lately, was really good. He hadn\u2019t bullied \nGus, or anyone else, he let Cyrus sit with him at lunch, he helped a \ncouple kids with their homework, which thinking back, Cyrus assumed it \nwas most likely just cheating. </p><p>Giving in, he slid on a pair of \nreal clothes and tiptoed down the steps and onto the lawn where he \nwaited for TJ to appear. Butterflies swarmed in his stomach, but not \nbecause of TJ. Cyrus had snuck out of his house a total of three times, \nsince he\u2019d met TJ on Monday, and it was only Friday. </p><p>TJ wheeled \nout, and Cyrus climbed on behind him. It was natural to him, now. He \ndidn\u2019t worry about hugging too tight, or feeling awkward. His hands \nfound TJ\u2019s waist like imprints of his arms had been carved into his \nstomach.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s rock n roll,\u201d TJ whispered to himself as he went off, Cyrus leaning his chin into the other boy\u2019s shoulder. </p><p>The\n world passing by seemed like it belonged to them. They were the kings \nand planet earth was their palace, street lights like torches raised to \ntheir dignified reign. They painted the city in the colors they chose, \nand the people would one day see Cyrus the way TJ did, strong and brave,\n loyal and worthy to be seen. Cyrus appreciated TJ in a way that was \nbeyond comprehensible words. He saw wonderment and the avant-garde in \nhim, like nobody else ever had. TJ somehow made Cyrus leave behind his \ncaution and uncover his capriciousness and he was unconditionally \ngrateful. </p><p>When TJ stopped and climbed off the bike, Cyrus could \nbarely see anything until his eyes adjusted. Soon he discovered they \nstood in the mouth of a big, foul smelling alleyway. </p><p>\u201cWhat are doing here, TJ?\u201d Cyrus whispered, grabbing his sleeve nervously.</p><p>TJ shook his head, sucking in a deep breath. \u201cNo idea. Said it was urgent.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus gulped, \u201cDoesn\u2019t look urgent to me. It looks like an alleyway.\u201d</p><p>From\n the opposite end of the alley, Reed peaked his head around the corner \nand waved them over. Cyrus and TJ looked at each other before following \nafter him their shoes echoing on the concrete. </p><p>When the two of \nthem rounded the corner, Cyrus\u2019 heart stopped. Reed and two other boys \nwere spray painting the front of a building with big fat letters, \nspelling out their hatred of the less fortunate people of the city. They\n were laughing while playing less than respectful music, their words \ncontinuing into a brand new set of vocabulary words that Cyrus wasn\u2019t \neven sure he knew. </p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing man?\u201d TJ said, \nafter reading their artwork. He knocked the spray can out of Reed\u2019s hand\n and shoved him back. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDude,\u201d Reed said, stumbling. \u201cWe thought you guys were cool.\u201d He liked his lips angrily, \u201cBut I guess we were wrong, huh.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou said we were hanging out.\u201d TJ shook his head in betrayal, stepping forward towards Reed, towering over him. </p><p>\u201cWell what the fuck does it look like we\u2019re doing?\u201d </p><p>TJ\n laughed, anger boiling in his voice, and Cyrus stepped forward, ready \nto break them apart, when one of Reed\u2019s goons grabbed his collar and \nswung him around. </p><p>\u201cHey, keep your hands off him.\u201d TJ called, and \nwithout a second thought, his fist flew into the boys face, knocking him\n over. Within the span of seconds, boys were kicking, hitting and \npunching each other, yells flying, words being aggressively exchanged. \nCyrus stepped away from the group, his heart racing. TJ was on the \nfloor, practically getting his head kicked in, three against one. </p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Cyrus screamed, his voice cracking. \u201cPlease!\u201d </p><p>Suddenly, sirens began to blare and a police car peeled down the alley.</p><p>\u201cRat\n on us, Goodman, and you\u2019re both fuckin\u2019 dead.\u201d Reed said frantically as\n he and his friends picked themselves up and shoved passed Cyrus. </p><p>Cyrus quickly slid over to TJ, and helped him up from the ground, his eye puffy and his lip sliced.<br/>\n\u201cStep away from the paint cans and put your hands up.\u201d The cop shouted \nover his flashlight. TJ and Cyrus looked at each other. All TJ could get\n out was a broken \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019. </p><p>&mdash;</p><p>After being called back \nto the station, the boys\u2019 mothers\u2019 arrived to pick them up. TJ\u2019s mother \narrived in a hurricane of yells and crying. Cyrus\u2019 mother came silently,\n icy and distant. She didn\u2019t say a word. The ride home was equally as \nsilent. Cyrus cried softly, his headache against the chilly glass of the\n car window. The street lights were no longer torches raised to his \ndignified reign. They were simply street lights, dimly lighting the \nsuburban neighborhood where he lived.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 mother put him to \nbed, and the next morning, woke him with a cup of tea and a piece of \npaper. Cyrus sat up and rubbed his eyes confusedly, his headache droning\n on in the background of his thoughts. </p><p>\u201cMorning, Cyrus.\u201d Leslie \nsaid, sitting at the foot of his bed. She usually greeted him with a \ngoodmorning and a kiss on the forehead, but that morning she refrained. </p><p>Cyrus\n looked around, remembering the previous night, stomach sinking. \u201cCan I \ngo see if TJ\u2019s okay?\u201d He asked suddenly, the image of his beaten up face\n flashing in his mind. </p><p>Leslie sighed, folding her hands over her knees. \u201cThat\u2019s what I came in here to talk about,\u201d </p><p>Stomach dropping, Cyrus sat up straight. \u201cIs he okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just fine.\u201d His mother said flatly. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you a story, and you\u2019re going to drink your tea and listen.\u201d </p><p>Confused, Cyrus nodded, grasping the warm mug in his hands. </p><p>\u201cWhen\n I was your age, I had a friend named Marcus. I thought Marcus was the \nmost amazing thing ever. He showed me music I\u2019d never heard, places I \nnever knew existed. He showed me the world from his painting palette, \nand I was never the same. I got into bad things, I met bad people, and I\n went down the wrong path. I got addicted to the feeling of rarity and \nthe charisma of life.<br/>\nOne day, I realized the people around me were hurting from decisions I\u2019d\n made. I knew I had to let him go. It was like I was sawing through my \nown heart.\u201d She smiled sadly into the distance. \u201cI want you to let go \nbefore you have to saw your own heart in half.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Cyrus asked, welling. </p><p>\u201cStarting today, you and TJ will not be allowed to see each other. Kate and I believe it\u2019s best for the both of you.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus\n stood up, slamming his tea onto his desk. \u201cNo! That\u2019s so unfair. TJ \nwould never hurt me, or get me to do bad things. Last night wasn\u2019t him \nand you know it!\u201d </p><p>\u201cCyrus,\u201d Leslie said calmly, with a firm \ndiction to it. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m an idiot? I know you\u2019ve snuck out three\n nights this week. I know you stay up until three in the morning every \nnight. All your life you\u2019ve made it a personal goal to get all A\u2019s, and \nyou know I don\u2019t care about grades, but you got a C in your math test \nthis week.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus didn\u2019t say anything, he knew he\u2019d cry if he did. </p><p>\u201cHoney,\n if TJ really cares about you, he wouldn\u2019t be putting you in harms way. \nThat\u2019s not what love is. So, from here on out, you won\u2019t be speaking \nwith him over walkie talkie, no texting or phone calls, and no hanging \nout, before or after school.\u201d </p><p>He didn\u2019t care anymore. He let his tears fall. Maybe she\u2019d change her mind if she saw how torn up he really was. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\n going to join a school club, and find a hobby. Make some new friends, \nand find some new people you click with while your other friends are \ngetting ready for Battle of the Bands.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus whirled around \ngrabbing his shoes and jacket. Leslie laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re grounded until \nMonday. You\u2019re not leaving this house until then. If you want friends \nover, fine, but you\u2019re staying put. Two days isn\u2019t torture.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus,\n almost bursting with emotion didn\u2019t know what to do. He yelled at his \nmother, face flooding with tears. \u201cGet out of my room!\u201d He roared, \nturning to yank open the curtains. The window across the street was \nlocked, blinds newly installed, curtains drawn. </p><p>Hours later, \nCyrus\u2019 face still buried in his pillow, a knock sounded on his bedroom \ndoor. \u201cGo away mom,\u201d He said through a muffled facefull of pillowcase.</p><p>The\n door creaked open and footsteps tiptoed to his bedside. \u201cNot mom,\u201d A \nsoft voice, which he knew belonged to Buffy, said. She rolled on top of \nhim, enveloping him in a big bear hug. A second pair of arms found him. \nAndi. </p><p>Cyrus sat up, embarrassed from his tears. \u201cHey guys,\u201d He \nslumped over, leaning on Andi\u2019s shoulder, taking Buffy\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m \nbeing over dramatic, aren\u2019t I?\u201d </p><p>Buffy giggled. \u201cMaybe just a teeny weeny bit.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\n just feel so, I don\u2019t know, present, when I\u2019m hanging out with him. \nWith everyone else, I feel invisible, and unimportant.\u201d He looked over \nhis shoulder to the window. </p><p>Andi sighed. \u201cYou know that isn\u2019t the case, Cyrus. We love you so much.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus\n pushed off from the bed, ignoring Andi\u2019s statement. He stood up and \nbegan pacing. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta fix this. This is totally unfair, its \ninjustice! He did nothing wrong, and I won&rsquo;t stand for this tyranny.\u201d \nCyrus shouted, as if he was giving an important speech. </p><p>Buffy and Andi looked at each other with knowing smiles.<br/>\nCyrus pulled out his colored coordinated glitter pens and a pad of plain paper and set to work out a plan. </p><p>&mdash;</p><p>The\n next morning Cyrus waited outside for Jonah as per usual. Across the \nstreet, the garage door opened, and Cyrus jumped. At least he\u2019d be able \nto see TJ and hang out with him before and during school. But TJ didn\u2019t \nemerge. Instead, the car rolled out, and from the opened car window, \nCyrus caught a glimpse of TJ in the side mirrors. He looked distraught, \nhis forehead creased into lines of worry and frustration. Cyrus\u2019 stomach\n ached. It really was the end, huh?</p><p>Jonah approached Cyrus, his face falling as soon as he captured a glimpse of him. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, man? You look terrible.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\n huffed out a frustrated laugh. \u201cThanks, Jo.\u201d He drawled sarcastically. \n\u201cI got in trouble with the police this weekend, so I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll \nbe seeing much of TJ anymore either.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWoah, dude,\u201d Jonah \nbreathed out, shaking his head lightly. \u201cTJ\u2019s in jail? I always knew \nthat guy was a bad influence but&hellip;\u201d The two boys began their trek to \nschool. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not in jail, Jonah, we\u2019re just not allowed to hang out anymore.\u201d Cyrus kicked up a rock and it clattered on the sidewalk. </p><p>\u201cDude, that totally sucks. He\u2019s sick, and not the good kind.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus\n shook his head, clenching his backpack straps in his palms. \u201cIt just \nnot fair. Imagine if you were just suddenly not allowed to hang out \nwith, I dunno, Walker.\u201d</p><p>Jonah furrowed his brow and a breath hitched. \u201cThat\u2019s different,\u201d Jonah muttered softly. </p><p>Cyrus scanned his friend\u2019s face, and knowingly nodded. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure it is.\u201d </p><p>A\n sad smile quirked at the side of Jonah\u2019s mouth as he tossed his arm \naround Cyrus\u2019 shoulder and nuzzled his head against the other\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019ll\n figure this out, Cy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI sure hope so,\u201d Cyrus sighed before he and Jonah parted ways. </p><p>A\n moment later, Cyrus spotted TJ talking to one of his basketball \nfriends. He started to walk over to approach him, but as soon as TJ saw \nhim, he turned away, walking in the opposite direction with his friend. \nConfused and hurt, Cyrus sank. Great, he thought, now he was avoiding \nhim. His mother had probably ruined everything. He knew her intentions \nwere pure, but he boiled inwardly. </p><p>Cyrus hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d \nbeen staring until Buffy and Andi swooped him up, towing Walker and \nMarty behind them. The two girls looped their arms through his and \nguided him in the direction to their first class. Cyrus was grateful to \nnever be left alone in his classes. He had Buffy and Andi sitting beside\n him in first period English, Marty took Spanish with him in second \nperiod. Third period was biology with Jonah and Andi, History with Buffy\n and Walker, Math with TJ and Buffy and so on. </p><p>As they lead him \nto class, Cyrus passed TJ, and with Buffy and Andi by his side, they \nslid by with their heads held high, arms interlocked. Cyrus\u2019 stomach \nturned anyway. He wasn\u2019t good at being petty, though his best friends \nwere connoisseurs of the art. The day continued to drag on and on, as if\n it had taken place and whole new realm of time. Every time he passed \nTJ, his friends would force him in the opposite direction, and everytime\n he was without them, TJ seemed to avoid him just as equally. </p><p>Every\n passing day was the same. He\u2019d walk to school with Jonah, see TJ, who \nwould ultimately see him, and turn away. His friends would wrestle him \nthrough the halls and force his eyes away at lunch. He\u2019d go home, look \nout the window to see the mirroring one closed tight, and no matter \nwhere he looked, he couldn\u2019t find where his mother had hidden his walkie\n talkie. </p><p>The Sunday of that heart achingly long week, Cyrus paced\n his bedroom floors until he\u2019d practically dug a ditch. Picking at his \nfingernails and focusing his breath, he finally decided to do what \nneeded to be done. He grabbed the folded up piece of paper on his desk \nand shoved it in his back pocket.</p><p>Cyrus peaked out his door, ready\n to leave, but his mother and stepfather were sitting right on the couch\n watching a scary movie. Knowing they\u2019d have to watch a second, more \nlight hearted movie afterwards, both of them would be staying up for \nhours. Cyrus decided to use another method. </p><p>Heart racing, he \npushed away his anxieties in his urgency and shimmied out of his window,\n climbing down tree limbs and roofs until he was close enough to jump to\n the ground, which, instead of leaping to the ground gracefully as he\u2019d \npreviously planned, he fell flat on his face. Brushing himself off, he \nran across the street and did his best to climb up to TJ\u2019s window, \nslipping a couple times. He wiggled out onto a thick limb and hopped \nonto the sloping roof that lead to the windowsill. </p><p>Cyrus closed \nhis eyes and sucked in a deep breath, and with a thundering chest, he \nknocked lightly on the window. Within a minute, the glass panes slipped \nopened. </p><p>TJ peaked out through the curtains, confusion painted \nbrightly across his eyes, a small smile twitching at the corner of his \nlips. His hair was messy and he was wearing his glasses. Cyrus tried not\n to sway too much, in fear of diving straight off the roof. </p><p>After\n finally registering, TJ practically pulled Cyrus through the window and\n pushed him into his desk chair. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here, \nman?\u201d He whispered harshly, shuffling over to lock his door. </p><p>Cyrus\n stood up, frustrated. \u201cI needed to see you. I wanted to make sure you \nwere okay. That&hellip;we are okay.\u201d Cyrus studied TJ\u2019s face. The cut on his \nlip was still visible, but he looked okay other than that. Better than \nokay, Cyrus thought. Just looking at him his stomach do backflips and \ntwists and front walkovers and every other kind of gymnastics too. </p><p>TJ\n drug his hands over his face, clearly distraught. \u201cYou realize, you \ncoming here is just making things worse. If we just let things blow \nover, it\u2019ll all be okay in a month.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus stepped closer. \u201cIt won\u2019t. I know my mother and if she thinks I\u2019m in danger in anyway, she won\u2019t relent.\u201d </p><p>TJ,\n inched forward as well. \u201cThen that\u2019s just what\u2019s going to have to \nhappen. Your friends and your mother and your goodie-two-shoes guilty \nconscience will tell you to stay away from me, and you will. And I\u2019ll go\n on, pretending not to see you in the halls, or in math class. And when \nyou pass me at lunch, you won\u2019t exist, and neither will I.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTJ,\u201d Cyrus sighed. </p><p>TJ\n shook his head, jaw tightening. \u201cIt\u2019s what\u2019s best. You shouldn\u2019t hang \nout with people like me. They\u2019re all right, Cyrus.\u201d Cyrus noted how \nsoftly his name tumbled from TJ\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cBut I want to.\u201d Cyrus \nsaid, searching TJ\u2019s eyes, unafraid of what he might uncover. \u201cWhat\u2019s \nbest for me, is you. You\u2019ve given me more than anyone else ever has, \nyou\u2019ve shown me what the world can really be. And I won\u2019t go down \nwithout a fight.\u201d </p><p>TJ softened, a twinkle blossoming in his eye. \u201cSo what do you suggest, Goodman?\u201d </p><p>Cyrus shrugged, \u201cDid I tell you my mother wants me to join a school club to avoid you?\u201d </p><p>TJ\n smiled, catching on. \u201cI suppose now that I can\u2019t hang out with my best \nfriend, I need something to fill my time, and my mother wouldn\u2019t be \nopposed to me focusing my energy on something involving school and my \ncommunity.\u201d </p><p>Grinning, Cyrus reached into his back pocket, and \npulled out a neatly folded piece of paper. Written neatly in glitter \npen, was an organized (alphabetically, of course) list of every school \nclub that Jefferson Middle had to offer.</p>",

Cyrus felt as if he\u2019d been reborn into a world that flipped \nupside down from his own. His shoulders weren\u2019t tense anymore, and he \nsuddenly had all the energy in the world. He\u2019d stay up all hours of the \nnight talking to TJ via walkie talkies while they\u2019d make funny faces at \neach other from the window.</p><p>It was nearly 3am, and Cyrus was still wide awake, sitting propped up by his window, cozied up in his dinosaur pajamas. </p><p>\u201cGetting tired yet, Goodman?\u201d TJ teased, the crackle of static following.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 heart swam. \u201cIn your dreams, Kippen.\u201d He replied, his cheeks growing suddenly warm. </p><p>\u201cI think you mean in your dreams, you know, because you\u2019re about to fall asleep.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus didn\u2019t have a reply. Instead he sank his face into his curtains, in vein attempt to wash away the heat. </p><p>\u201cCy,\n I just got a text from Reed.\u201d TJ crackled. Well that worked, Cyrus \nthought, because all of a sudden his chest wasn\u2019t flipping. \u201cHe wants to\n meet up right now.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus popped up through his window, facing \nTJ. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that sound a little weird to you? Like it\u2019s the worst \npossible idea ever?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDude,\u201d TJ said into the device. \u201cThis is \nReed we\u2019re talking about. He\u2019s always weird. Get ready, b\u2019cause we\u2019re \nleaving in five.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus gulped, looking at his clock. Maybe TJ \nwas right. All Reed had been lately, was really good. He hadn\u2019t bullied \nGus, or anyone else, he let Cyrus sit with him at lunch, he helped a \ncouple kids with their homework, which thinking back, Cyrus assumed it \nwas most likely just cheating. </p><p>Giving in, he slid on a pair of \nreal clothes and tiptoed down the steps and onto the lawn where he \nwaited for TJ to appear. Butterflies swarmed in his stomach, but not \nbecause of TJ. Cyrus had snuck out of his house a total of three times, \nsince he\u2019d met TJ on Monday, and it was only Friday. </p><p>TJ wheeled \nout, and Cyrus climbed on behind him. It was natural to him, now. He \ndidn\u2019t worry about hugging too tight, or feeling awkward. His hands \nfound TJ\u2019s waist like imprints of his arms had been carved into his \nstomach.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s rock n roll,\u201d TJ whispered to himself as he went off, Cyrus leaning his chin into the other boy\u2019s shoulder. </p><p>The\n world passing by seemed like it belonged to them. They were the kings \nand planet earth was their palace, street lights like torches raised to \ntheir dignified reign. They painted the city in the colors they chose, \nand the people would one day see Cyrus the way TJ did, strong and brave,\n loyal and worthy to be seen. Cyrus appreciated TJ in a way that was \nbeyond comprehensible words. He saw wonderment and the avant-garde in \nhim, like nobody else ever had. TJ somehow made Cyrus leave behind his \ncaution and uncover his capriciousness and he was unconditionally \ngrateful. </p><p>When TJ stopped and climbed off the bike, Cyrus could \nbarely see anything until his eyes adjusted. Soon he discovered they \nstood in the mouth of a big, foul smelling alleyway. </p><p>\u201cWhat are doing here, TJ?\u201d Cyrus whispered, grabbing his sleeve nervously.</p><p>TJ shook his head, sucking in a deep breath. \u201cNo idea. Said it was urgent.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus gulped, \u201cDoesn\u2019t look urgent to me. It looks like an alleyway.\u201d</p><p>From\n the opposite end of the alley, Reed peaked his head around the corner \nand waved them over. Cyrus and TJ looked at each other before following \nafter him their shoes echoing on the concrete. </p><p>When the two of \nthem rounded the corner, Cyrus\u2019 heart stopped. Reed and two other boys \nwere spray painting the front of a building with big fat letters, \nspelling out their hatred of the less fortunate people of the city. They\n were laughing while playing less than respectful music, their words \ncontinuing into a brand new set of vocabulary words that Cyrus wasn\u2019t \neven sure he knew. </p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing man?\u201d TJ said, \nafter reading their artwork. He knocked the spray can out of Reed\u2019s hand\n and shoved him back. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDude,\u201d Reed said, stumbling. \u201cWe thought you guys were cool.\u201d He liked his lips angrily, \u201cBut I guess we were wrong, huh.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou said we were hanging out.\u201d TJ shook his head in betrayal, stepping forward towards Reed, towering over him. </p><p>\u201cWell what the fuck does it look like we\u2019re doing?\u201d </p><p>TJ\n laughed, anger boiling in his voice, and Cyrus stepped forward, ready \nto break them apart, when one of Reed\u2019s goons grabbed his collar and \nswung him around. </p><p>\u201cHey, keep your hands off him.\u201d TJ called, and \nwithout a second thought, his fist flew into the boys face, knocking him\n over. Within the span of seconds, boys were kicking, hitting and \npunching each other, yells flying, words being aggressively exchanged. \nCyrus stepped away from the group, his heart racing. TJ was on the \nfloor, practically getting his head kicked in, three against one. </p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Cyrus screamed, his voice cracking. \u201cPlease!\u201d </p><p>Suddenly, sirens began to blare and a police car peeled down the alley.</p><p>\u201cRat\n on us, Goodman, and you\u2019re both fuckin\u2019 dead.\u201d Reed said frantically as\n he and his friends picked themselves up and shoved passed Cyrus. </p><p>Cyrus quickly slid over to TJ, and helped him up from the ground, his eye puffy and his lip sliced.<br>\n\u201cStep away from the paint cans and put your hands up.\u201d The cop shouted \nover his flashlight. TJ and Cyrus looked at each other. All TJ could get\n out was a broken \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>After being called back \nto the station, the boys\u2019 mothers\u2019 arrived to pick them up. TJ\u2019s mother \narrived in a hurricane of yells and crying. Cyrus\u2019 mother came silently,\n icy and distant. She didn\u2019t say a word. The ride home was equally as \nsilent. Cyrus cried softly, his headache against the chilly glass of the\n car window. The street lights were no longer torches raised to his \ndignified reign. They were simply street lights, dimly lighting the \nsuburban neighborhood where he lived.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 mother put him to \nbed, and the next morning, woke him with a cup of tea and a piece of \npaper. Cyrus sat up and rubbed his eyes confusedly, his headache droning\n on in the background of his thoughts. </p><p>\u201cMorning, Cyrus.\u201d Leslie \nsaid, sitting at the foot of his bed. She usually greeted him with a \ngoodmorning and a kiss on the forehead, but that morning she refrained. </p><p>Cyrus\n looked around, remembering the previous night, stomach sinking. \u201cCan I \ngo see if TJ\u2019s okay?\u201d He asked suddenly, the image of his beaten up face\n flashing in his mind. </p><p>Leslie sighed, folding her hands over her knees. \u201cThat\u2019s what I came in here to talk about,\u201d </p><p>Stomach dropping, Cyrus sat up straight. \u201cIs he okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just fine.\u201d His mother said flatly. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you a story, and you\u2019re going to drink your tea and listen.\u201d </p><p>Confused, Cyrus nodded, grasping the warm mug in his hands. </p><p>\u201cWhen\n I was your age, I had a friend named Marcus. I thought Marcus was the \nmost amazing thing ever. He showed me music I\u2019d never heard, places I \nnever knew existed. He showed me the world from his painting palette, \nand I was never the same. I got into bad things, I met bad people, and I\n went down the wrong path. I got addicted to the feeling of rarity and \nthe charisma of life.<br>\nOne day, I realized the people around me were hurting from decisions I\u2019d\n made. I knew I had to let him go. It was like I was sawing through my \nown heart.\u201d She smiled sadly into the distance. \u201cI want you to let go \nbefore you have to saw your own heart in half.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Cyrus asked, welling. </p><p>\u201cStarting today, you and TJ will not be allowed to see each other. Kate and I believe it\u2019s best for the both of you.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus\n stood up, slamming his tea onto his desk. \u201cNo! That\u2019s so unfair. TJ \nwould never hurt me, or get me to do bad things. Last night wasn\u2019t him \nand you know it!\u201d </p><p>\u201cCyrus,\u201d Leslie said calmly, with a firm \ndiction to it. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m an idiot? I know you\u2019ve snuck out three\n nights this week. I know you stay up until three in the morning every \nnight. All your life you\u2019ve made it a personal goal to get all A\u2019s, and \nyou know I don\u2019t care about grades, but you got a C in your math test \nthis week.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus didn\u2019t say anything, he knew he\u2019d cry if he did. </p><p>\u201cHoney,\n if TJ really cares about you, he wouldn\u2019t be putting you in harms way. \nThat\u2019s not what love is. So, from here on out, you won\u2019t be speaking \nwith him over walkie talkie, no texting or phone calls, and no hanging \nout, before or after school.\u201d </p><p>He didn\u2019t care anymore. He let his tears fall. Maybe she\u2019d change her mind if she saw how torn up he really was. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\n going to join a school club, and find a hobby. Make some new friends, \nand find some new people you click with while your other friends are \ngetting ready for Battle of the Bands.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus whirled around \ngrabbing his shoes and jacket. Leslie laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re grounded until \nMonday. You\u2019re not leaving this house until then. If you want friends \nover, fine, but you\u2019re staying put. Two days isn\u2019t torture.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus,\n almost bursting with emotion didn\u2019t know what to do. He yelled at his \nmother, face flooding with tears. \u201cGet out of my room!\u201d He roared, \nturning to yank open the curtains. The window across the street was \nlocked, blinds newly installed, curtains drawn. </p><p>Hours later, \nCyrus\u2019 face still buried in his pillow, a knock sounded on his bedroom \ndoor. \u201cGo away mom,\u201d He said through a muffled facefull of pillowcase.</p><p>The\n door creaked open and footsteps tiptoed to his bedside. \u201cNot mom,\u201d A \nsoft voice, which he knew belonged to Buffy, said. She rolled on top of \nhim, enveloping him in a big bear hug. A second pair of arms found him. \nAndi. </p><p>Cyrus sat up, embarrassed from his tears. \u201cHey guys,\u201d He \nslumped over, leaning on Andi\u2019s shoulder, taking Buffy\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m \nbeing over dramatic, aren\u2019t I?\u201d </p><p>Buffy giggled. \u201cMaybe just a teeny weeny bit.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\n just feel so, I don\u2019t know, present, when I\u2019m hanging out with him. \nWith everyone else, I feel invisible, and unimportant.\u201d He looked over \nhis shoulder to the window. </p><p>Andi sighed. \u201cYou know that isn\u2019t the case, Cyrus. We love you so much.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus\n pushed off from the bed, ignoring Andi\u2019s statement. He stood up and \nbegan pacing. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta fix this. This is totally unfair, its \ninjustice! He did nothing wrong, and I won\u2019t stand for this tyranny.\u201d \nCyrus shouted, as if he was giving an important speech. </p><p>Buffy and Andi looked at each other with knowing smiles.<br>\nCyrus pulled out his colored coordinated glitter pens and a pad of plain paper and set to work out a plan. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>The\n next morning Cyrus waited outside for Jonah as per usual. Across the \nstreet, the garage door opened, and Cyrus jumped. At least he\u2019d be able \nto see TJ and hang out with him before and during school. But TJ didn\u2019t \nemerge. Instead, the car rolled out, and from the opened car window, \nCyrus caught a glimpse of TJ in the side mirrors. He looked distraught, \nhis forehead creased into lines of worry and frustration. Cyrus\u2019 stomach\n ached. It really was the end, huh?</p><p>Jonah approached Cyrus, his face falling as soon as he captured a glimpse of him. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, man? You look terrible.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\n huffed out a frustrated laugh. \u201cThanks, Jo.\u201d He drawled sarcastically. \n\u201cI got in trouble with the police this weekend, so I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll \nbe seeing much of TJ anymore either.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWoah, dude,\u201d Jonah \nbreathed out, shaking his head lightly. \u201cTJ\u2019s in jail? I always knew \nthat guy was a bad influence but\u2026\u201d The two boys began their trek to \nschool. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not in jail, Jonah, we\u2019re just not allowed to hang out anymore.\u201d Cyrus kicked up a rock and it clattered on the sidewalk. </p><p>\u201cDude, that totally sucks. He\u2019s sick, and not the good kind.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus\n shook his head, clenching his backpack straps in his palms. \u201cIt just \nnot fair. Imagine if you were just suddenly not allowed to hang out \nwith, I dunno, Walker.\u201d</p><p>Jonah furrowed his brow and a breath hitched. \u201cThat\u2019s different,\u201d Jonah muttered softly. </p><p>Cyrus scanned his friend\u2019s face, and knowingly nodded. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure it is.\u201d </p><p>A\n sad smile quirked at the side of Jonah\u2019s mouth as he tossed his arm \naround Cyrus\u2019 shoulder and nuzzled his head against the other\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019ll\n figure this out, Cy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI sure hope so,\u201d Cyrus sighed before he and Jonah parted ways. </p><p>A\n moment later, Cyrus spotted TJ talking to one of his basketball \nfriends. He started to walk over to approach him, but as soon as TJ saw \nhim, he turned away, walking in the opposite direction with his friend. \nConfused and hurt, Cyrus sank. Great, he thought, now he was avoiding \nhim. His mother had probably ruined everything. He knew her intentions \nwere pure, but he boiled inwardly. </p><p>Cyrus hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d \nbeen staring until Buffy and Andi swooped him up, towing Walker and \nMarty behind them. The two girls looped their arms through his and \nguided him in the direction to their first class. Cyrus was grateful to \nnever be left alone in his classes. He had Buffy and Andi sitting beside\n him in first period English, Marty took Spanish with him in second \nperiod. Third period was biology with Jonah and Andi, History with Buffy\n and Walker, Math with TJ and Buffy and so on. </p><p>As they lead him \nto class, Cyrus passed TJ, and with Buffy and Andi by his side, they \nslid by with their heads held high, arms interlocked. Cyrus\u2019 stomach \nturned anyway. He wasn\u2019t good at being petty, though his best friends \nwere connoisseurs of the art. The day continued to drag on and on, as if\n it had taken place and whole new realm of time. Every time he passed \nTJ, his friends would force him in the opposite direction, and everytime\n he was without them, TJ seemed to avoid him just as equally. </p><p>Every\n passing day was the same. He\u2019d walk to school with Jonah, see TJ, who \nwould ultimately see him, and turn away. His friends would wrestle him \nthrough the halls and force his eyes away at lunch. He\u2019d go home, look \nout the window to see the mirroring one closed tight, and no matter \nwhere he looked, he couldn\u2019t find where his mother had hidden his walkie\n talkie. </p><p>The Sunday of that heart achingly long week, Cyrus paced\n his bedroom floors until he\u2019d practically dug a ditch. Picking at his \nfingernails and focusing his breath, he finally decided to do what \nneeded to be done. He grabbed the folded up piece of paper on his desk \nand shoved it in his back pocket.</p><p>Cyrus peaked out his door, ready\n to leave, but his mother and stepfather were sitting right on the couch\n watching a scary movie. Knowing they\u2019d have to watch a second, more \nlight hearted movie afterwards, both of them would be staying up for \nhours. Cyrus decided to use another method. </p><p>Heart racing, he \npushed away his anxieties in his urgency and shimmied out of his window,\n climbing down tree limbs and roofs until he was close enough to jump to\n the ground, which, instead of leaping to the ground gracefully as he\u2019d \npreviously planned, he fell flat on his face. Brushing himself off, he \nran across the street and did his best to climb up to TJ\u2019s window, \nslipping a couple times. He wiggled out onto a thick limb and hopped \nonto the sloping roof that lead to the windowsill. </p><p>Cyrus closed \nhis eyes and sucked in a deep breath, and with a thundering chest, he \nknocked lightly on the window. Within a minute, the glass panes slipped \nopened. </p><p>TJ peaked out through the curtains, confusion painted \nbrightly across his eyes, a small smile twitching at the corner of his \nlips. His hair was messy and he was wearing his glasses. Cyrus tried not\n to sway too much, in fear of diving straight off the roof. </p><p>After\n finally registering, TJ practically pulled Cyrus through the window and\n pushed him into his desk chair. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here, \nman?\u201d He whispered harshly, shuffling over to lock his door. </p><p>Cyrus\n stood up, frustrated. \u201cI needed to see you. I wanted to make sure you \nwere okay. That\u2026we are okay.\u201d Cyrus studied TJ\u2019s face. The cut on his \nlip was still visible, but he looked okay other than that. Better than \nokay, Cyrus thought. Just looking at him his stomach do backflips and \ntwists and front walkovers and every other kind of gymnastics too. </p><p>TJ\n drug his hands over his face, clearly distraught. \u201cYou realize, you \ncoming here is just making things worse. If we just let things blow \nover, it\u2019ll all be okay in a month.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus stepped closer. \u201cIt won\u2019t. I know my mother and if she thinks I\u2019m in danger in anyway, she won\u2019t relent.\u201d </p><p>TJ,\n inched forward as well. \u201cThen that\u2019s just what\u2019s going to have to \nhappen. Your friends and your mother and your goodie-two-shoes guilty \nconscience will tell you to stay away from me, and you will. And I\u2019ll go\n on, pretending not to see you in the halls, or in math class. And when \nyou pass me at lunch, you won\u2019t exist, and neither will I.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTJ,\u201d Cyrus sighed. </p><p>TJ\n shook his head, jaw tightening. \u201cIt\u2019s what\u2019s best. You shouldn\u2019t hang \nout with people like me. They\u2019re all right, Cyrus.\u201d Cyrus noted how \nsoftly his name tumbled from TJ\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cBut I want to.\u201d Cyrus \nsaid, searching TJ\u2019s eyes, unafraid of what he might uncover. \u201cWhat\u2019s \nbest for me, is you. You\u2019ve given me more than anyone else ever has, \nyou\u2019ve shown me what the world can really be. And I won\u2019t go down \nwithout a fight.\u201d </p><p>TJ softened, a twinkle blossoming in his eye. \u201cSo what do you suggest, Goodman?\u201d </p><p>Cyrus shrugged, \u201cDid I tell you my mother wants me to join a school club to avoid you?\u201d </p><p>TJ\n smiled, catching on. \u201cI suppose now that I can\u2019t hang out with my best \nfriend, I need something to fill my time, and my mother wouldn\u2019t be \nopposed to me focusing my energy on something involving school and my \ncommunity.\u201d </p><p>Grinning, Cyrus reached into his back pocket, and \npulled out a neatly folded piece of paper. Written neatly in glitter \npen, was an organized (alphabetically, of course) list of every school \nclub that Jefferson Middle had to offer.</p>",

When Cyrus\u2019 mother\n learns \u00a0that this kid might be rolling with the wrong crowds, she \ndecides that \u00a0it\u2019s best that the two of them stop hanging out, \ndetermined to remain \u00a0friends, Cyrus and the new boy, TJ, create their \nown club called TJ and \u00a0Cyrus\u2019 Totally No Fun Club, an undercover tutor \nclub, where they \u00a0actually go on adventures, get into some not too \ntroublesome trouble, \u00a0and fall in love. <br></p>[[MORE]]<p>The days that followed were nothing short of exciting in every \nsecond. Cyrus felt as if he\u2019d been reborn into a world that flipped \nupside down from his own. His shoulders weren\u2019t tense anymore, and he \nsuddenly had all the energy in the world. He\u2019d stay up all hours of the \nnight talking to TJ via walkie talkies while they\u2019d make funny faces at \neach other from the window.</p><p>It was nearly 3am, and Cyrus was still wide awake, sitting propped up by his window, cozied up in his dinosaur pajamas. </p><p>\u201cGetting tired yet, Goodman?\u201d TJ teased, the crackle of static following.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 heart swam. \u201cIn your dreams, Kippen.\u201d He replied, his cheeks growing suddenly warm. </p><p>\u201cI think you mean in your dreams, you know, because you\u2019re about to fall asleep.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus didn\u2019t have a reply. Instead he sank his face into his curtains, in vein attempt to wash away the heat. </p><p>\u201cCy,\n I just got a text from Reed.\u201d TJ crackled. Well that worked, Cyrus \nthought, because all of a sudden his chest wasn\u2019t flipping. \u201cHe wants to\n meet up right now.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus popped up through his window, facing \nTJ. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that sound a little weird to you? Like it\u2019s the worst \npossible idea ever?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDude,\u201d TJ said into the device. \u201cThis is \nReed we\u2019re talking about. He\u2019s always weird. Get ready, b\u2019cause we\u2019re \nleaving in five.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus gulped, looking at his clock. Maybe TJ \nwas right. All Reed had been lately, was really good. He hadn\u2019t bullied \nGus, or anyone else, he let Cyrus sit with him at lunch, he helped a \ncouple kids with their homework, which thinking back, Cyrus assumed it \nwas most likely just cheating. </p><p>Giving in, he slid on a pair of \nreal clothes and tiptoed down the steps and onto the lawn where he \nwaited for TJ to appear. Butterflies swarmed in his stomach, but not \nbecause of TJ. Cyrus had snuck out of his house a total of three times, \nsince he\u2019d met TJ on Monday, and it was only Friday. </p><p>TJ wheeled \nout, and Cyrus climbed on behind him. It was natural to him, now. He \ndidn\u2019t worry about hugging too tight, or feeling awkward. His hands \nfound TJ\u2019s waist like imprints of his arms had been carved into his \nstomach.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s rock n roll,\u201d TJ whispered to himself as he went off, Cyrus leaning his chin into the other boy\u2019s shoulder. </p><p>The\n world passing by seemed like it belonged to them. They were the kings \nand planet earth was their palace, street lights like torches raised to \ntheir dignified reign. They painted the city in the colors they chose, \nand the people would one day see Cyrus the way TJ did, strong and brave,\n loyal and worthy to be seen. Cyrus appreciated TJ in a way that was \nbeyond comprehensible words. He saw wonderment and the avant-garde in \nhim, like nobody else ever had. TJ somehow made Cyrus leave behind his \ncaution and uncover his capriciousness and he was unconditionally \ngrateful. </p><p>When TJ stopped and climbed off the bike, Cyrus could \nbarely see anything until his eyes adjusted. Soon he discovered they \nstood in the mouth of a big, foul smelling alleyway. </p><p>\u201cWhat are doing here, TJ?\u201d Cyrus whispered, grabbing his sleeve nervously.</p><p>TJ shook his head, sucking in a deep breath. \u201cNo idea. Said it was urgent.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus gulped, \u201cDoesn\u2019t look urgent to me. It looks like an alleyway.\u201d</p><p>From\n the opposite end of the alley, Reed peaked his head around the corner \nand waved them over. Cyrus and TJ looked at each other before following \nafter him their shoes echoing on the concrete. </p><p>When the two of \nthem rounded the corner, Cyrus\u2019 heart stopped. Reed and two other boys \nwere spray painting the front of a building with big fat letters, \nspelling out their hatred of the less fortunate people of the city. They\n were laughing while playing less than respectful music, their words \ncontinuing into a brand new set of vocabulary words that Cyrus wasn\u2019t \neven sure he knew. </p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing man?\u201d TJ said, \nafter reading their artwork. He knocked the spray can out of Reed\u2019s hand\n and shoved him back. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDude,\u201d Reed said, stumbling. \u201cWe thought you guys were cool.\u201d He liked his lips angrily, \u201cBut I guess we were wrong, huh.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou said we were hanging out.\u201d TJ shook his head in betrayal, stepping forward towards Reed, towering over him. </p><p>\u201cWell what the fuck does it look like we\u2019re doing?\u201d </p><p>TJ\n laughed, anger boiling in his voice, and Cyrus stepped forward, ready \nto break them apart, when one of Reed\u2019s goons grabbed his collar and \nswung him around. </p><p>\u201cHey, keep your hands off him.\u201d TJ called, and \nwithout a second thought, his fist flew into the boys face, knocking him\n over. Within the span of seconds, boys were kicking, hitting and \npunching each other, yells flying, words being aggressively exchanged. \nCyrus stepped away from the group, his heart racing. TJ was on the \nfloor, practically getting his head kicked in, three against one. </p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Cyrus screamed, his voice cracking. \u201cPlease!\u201d </p><p>Suddenly, sirens began to blare and a police car peeled down the alley.</p><p>\u201cRat\n on us, Goodman, and you\u2019re both fuckin\u2019 dead.\u201d Reed said frantically as\n he and his friends picked themselves up and shoved passed Cyrus. </p><p>Cyrus quickly slid over to TJ, and helped him up from the ground, his eye puffy and his lip sliced.<br>\n\u201cStep away from the paint cans and put your hands up.\u201d The cop shouted \nover his flashlight. TJ and Cyrus looked at each other. All TJ could get\n out was a broken \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>After being called back \nto the station, the boys\u2019 mothers\u2019 arrived to pick them up. TJ\u2019s mother \narrived in a hurricane of yells and crying. Cyrus\u2019 mother came silently,\n icy and distant. She didn\u2019t say a word. The ride home was equally as \nsilent. Cyrus cried softly, his headache against the chilly glass of the\n car window. The street lights were no longer torches raised to his \ndignified reign. They were simply street lights, dimly lighting the \nsuburban neighborhood where he lived.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 mother put him to \nbed, and the next morning, woke him with a cup of tea and a piece of \npaper. Cyrus sat up and rubbed his eyes confusedly, his headache droning\n on in the background of his thoughts. </p><p>\u201cMorning, Cyrus.\u201d Leslie \nsaid, sitting at the foot of his bed. She usually greeted him with a \ngoodmorning and a kiss on the forehead, but that morning she refrained. </p><p>Cyrus\n looked around, remembering the previous night, stomach sinking. \u201cCan I \ngo see if TJ\u2019s okay?\u201d He asked suddenly, the image of his beaten up face\n flashing in his mind. </p><p>Leslie sighed, folding her hands over her knees. \u201cThat\u2019s what I came in here to talk about,\u201d </p><p>Stomach dropping, Cyrus sat up straight. \u201cIs he okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just fine.\u201d His mother said flatly. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you a story, and you\u2019re going to drink your tea and listen.\u201d </p><p>Confused, Cyrus nodded, grasping the warm mug in his hands. </p><p>\u201cWhen\n I was your age, I had a friend named Marcus. I thought Marcus was the \nmost amazing thing ever. He showed me music I\u2019d never heard, places I \nnever knew existed. He showed me the world from his painting palette, \nand I was never the same. I got into bad things, I met bad people, and I\n went down the wrong path. I got addicted to the feeling of rarity and \nthe charisma of life.<br>\nOne day, I realized the people around me were hurting from decisions I\u2019d\n made. I knew I had to let him go. It was like I was sawing through my \nown heart.\u201d She smiled sadly into the distance. \u201cI want you to let go \nbefore you have to saw your own heart in half.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Cyrus asked, welling. </p><p>\u201cStarting today, you and TJ will not be allowed to see each other. Kate and I believe it\u2019s best for the both of you.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus\n stood up, slamming his tea onto his desk. \u201cNo! That\u2019s so unfair. TJ \nwould never hurt me, or get me to do bad things. Last night wasn\u2019t him \nand you know it!\u201d </p><p>\u201cCyrus,\u201d Leslie said calmly, with a firm \ndiction to it. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m an idiot? I know you\u2019ve snuck out three\n nights this week. I know you stay up until three in the morning every \nnight. All your life you\u2019ve made it a personal goal to get all A\u2019s, and \nyou know I don\u2019t care about grades, but you got a C in your math test \nthis week.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus didn\u2019t say anything, he knew he\u2019d cry if he did. </p><p>\u201cHoney,\n if TJ really cares about you, he wouldn\u2019t be putting you in harms way. \nThat\u2019s not what love is. So, from here on out, you won\u2019t be speaking \nwith him over walkie talkie, no texting or phone calls, and no hanging \nout, before or after school.\u201d </p><p>He didn\u2019t care anymore. He let his tears fall. Maybe she\u2019d change her mind if she saw how torn up he really was. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\n going to join a school club, and find a hobby. Make some new friends, \nand find some new people you click with while your other friends are \ngetting ready for Battle of the Bands.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus whirled around \ngrabbing his shoes and jacket. Leslie laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re grounded until \nMonday. You\u2019re not leaving this house until then. If you want friends \nover, fine, but you\u2019re staying put. Two days isn\u2019t torture.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus,\n almost bursting with emotion didn\u2019t know what to do. He yelled at his \nmother, face flooding with tears. \u201cGet out of my room!\u201d He roared, \nturning to yank open the curtains. The window across the street was \nlocked, blinds newly installed, curtains drawn. </p><p>Hours later, \nCyrus\u2019 face still buried in his pillow, a knock sounded on his bedroom \ndoor. \u201cGo away mom,\u201d He said through a muffled facefull of pillowcase.</p><p>The\n door creaked open and footsteps tiptoed to his bedside. \u201cNot mom,\u201d A \nsoft voice, which he knew belonged to Buffy, said. She rolled on top of \nhim, enveloping him in a big bear hug. A second pair of arms found him. \nAndi. </p><p>Cyrus sat up, embarrassed from his tears. \u201cHey guys,\u201d He \nslumped over, leaning on Andi\u2019s shoulder, taking Buffy\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m \nbeing over dramatic, aren\u2019t I?\u201d </p><p>Buffy giggled. \u201cMaybe just a teeny weeny bit.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\n just feel so, I don\u2019t know, present, when I\u2019m hanging out with him. \nWith everyone else, I feel invisible, and unimportant.\u201d He looked over \nhis shoulder to the window. </p><p>Andi sighed. \u201cYou know that isn\u2019t the case, Cyrus. We love you so much.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus\n pushed off from the bed, ignoring Andi\u2019s statement. He stood up and \nbegan pacing. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta fix this. This is totally unfair, its \ninjustice! He did nothing wrong, and I won\u2019t stand for this tyranny.\u201d \nCyrus shouted, as if he was giving an important speech. </p><p>Buffy and Andi looked at each other with knowing smiles.<br>\nCyrus pulled out his colored coordinated glitter pens and a pad of plain paper and set to work out a plan. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>The\n next morning Cyrus waited outside for Jonah as per usual. Across the \nstreet, the garage door opened, and Cyrus jumped. At least he\u2019d be able \nto see TJ and hang out with him before and during school. But TJ didn\u2019t \nemerge. Instead, the car rolled out, and from the opened car window, \nCyrus caught a glimpse of TJ in the side mirrors. He looked distraught, \nhis forehead creased into lines of worry and frustration. Cyrus\u2019 stomach\n ached. It really was the end, huh?</p><p>Jonah approached Cyrus, his face falling as soon as he captured a glimpse of him. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, man? You look terrible.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\n huffed out a frustrated laugh. \u201cThanks, Jo.\u201d He drawled sarcastically. \n\u201cI got in trouble with the police this weekend, so I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll \nbe seeing much of TJ anymore either.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWoah, dude,\u201d Jonah \nbreathed out, shaking his head lightly. \u201cTJ\u2019s in jail? I always knew \nthat guy was a bad influence but\u2026\u201d The two boys began their trek to \nschool. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not in jail, Jonah, we\u2019re just not allowed to hang out anymore.\u201d Cyrus kicked up a rock and it clattered on the sidewalk. </p><p>\u201cDude, that totally sucks. He\u2019s sick, and not the good kind.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus\n shook his head, clenching his backpack straps in his palms. \u201cIt just \nnot fair. Imagine if you were just suddenly not allowed to hang out \nwith, I dunno, Walker.\u201d</p><p>Jonah furrowed his brow and a breath hitched. \u201cThat\u2019s different,\u201d Jonah muttered softly. </p><p>Cyrus scanned his friend\u2019s face, and knowingly nodded. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure it is.\u201d </p><p>A\n sad smile quirked at the side of Jonah\u2019s mouth as he tossed his arm \naround Cyrus\u2019 shoulder and nuzzled his head against the other\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019ll\n figure this out, Cy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI sure hope so,\u201d Cyrus sighed before he and Jonah parted ways. </p><p>A\n moment later, Cyrus spotted TJ talking to one of his basketball \nfriends. He started to walk over to approach him, but as soon as TJ saw \nhim, he turned away, walking in the opposite direction with his friend. \nConfused and hurt, Cyrus sank. Great, he thought, now he was avoiding \nhim. His mother had probably ruined everything. He knew her intentions \nwere pure, but he boiled inwardly. </p><p>Cyrus hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d \nbeen staring until Buffy and Andi swooped him up, towing Walker and \nMarty behind them. The two girls looped their arms through his and \nguided him in the direction to their first class. Cyrus was grateful to \nnever be left alone in his classes. He had Buffy and Andi sitting beside\n him in first period English, Marty took Spanish with him in second \nperiod. Third period was biology with Jonah and Andi, History with Buffy\n and Walker, Math with TJ and Buffy and so on. </p><p>As they lead him \nto class, Cyrus passed TJ, and with Buffy and Andi by his side, they \nslid by with their heads held high, arms interlocked. Cyrus\u2019 stomach \nturned anyway. He wasn\u2019t good at being petty, though his best friends \nwere connoisseurs of the art. The day continued to drag on and on, as if\n it had taken place and whole new realm of time. Every time he passed \nTJ, his friends would force him in the opposite direction, and everytime\n he was without them, TJ seemed to avoid him just as equally. </p><p>Every\n passing day was the same. He\u2019d walk to school with Jonah, see TJ, who \nwould ultimately see him, and turn away. His friends would wrestle him \nthrough the halls and force his eyes away at lunch. He\u2019d go home, look \nout the window to see the mirroring one closed tight, and no matter \nwhere he looked, he couldn\u2019t find where his mother had hidden his walkie\n talkie. </p><p>The Sunday of that heart achingly long week, Cyrus paced\n his bedroom floors until he\u2019d practically dug a ditch. Picking at his \nfingernails and focusing his breath, he finally decided to do what \nneeded to be done. He grabbed the folded up piece of paper on his desk \nand shoved it in his back pocket.</p><p>Cyrus peaked out his door, ready\n to leave, but his mother and stepfather were sitting right on the couch\n watching a scary movie. Knowing they\u2019d have to watch a second, more \nlight hearted movie afterwards, both of them would be staying up for \nhours. Cyrus decided to use another method. </p><p>Heart racing, he \npushed away his anxieties in his urgency and shimmied out of his window,\n climbing down tree limbs and roofs until he was close enough to jump to\n the ground, which, instead of leaping to the ground gracefully as he\u2019d \npreviously planned, he fell flat on his face. Brushing himself off, he \nran across the street and did his best to climb up to TJ\u2019s window, \nslipping a couple times. He wiggled out onto a thick limb and hopped \nonto the sloping roof that lead to the windowsill. </p><p>Cyrus closed \nhis eyes and sucked in a deep breath, and with a thundering chest, he \nknocked lightly on the window. Within a minute, the glass panes slipped \nopened. </p><p>TJ peaked out through the curtains, confusion painted \nbrightly across his eyes, a small smile twitching at the corner of his \nlips. His hair was messy and he was wearing his glasses. Cyrus tried not\n to sway too much, in fear of diving straight off the roof. </p><p>After\n finally registering, TJ practically pulled Cyrus through the window and\n pushed him into his desk chair. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here, \nman?\u201d He whispered harshly, shuffling over to lock his door. </p><p>Cyrus\n stood up, frustrated. \u201cI needed to see you. I wanted to make sure you \nwere okay. That\u2026we are okay.\u201d Cyrus studied TJ\u2019s face. The cut on his \nlip was still visible, but he looked okay other than that. Better than \nokay, Cyrus thought. Just looking at him his stomach do backflips and \ntwists and front walkovers and every other kind of gymnastics too. </p><p>TJ\n drug his hands over his face, clearly distraught. \u201cYou realize, you \ncoming here is just making things worse. If we just let things blow \nover, it\u2019ll all be okay in a month.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus stepped closer. \u201cIt won\u2019t. I know my mother and if she thinks I\u2019m in danger in anyway, she won\u2019t relent.\u201d </p><p>TJ,\n inched forward as well. \u201cThen that\u2019s just what\u2019s going to have to \nhappen. Your friends and your mother and your goodie-two-shoes guilty \nconscience will tell you to stay away from me, and you will. And I\u2019ll go\n on, pretending not to see you in the halls, or in math class. And when \nyou pass me at lunch, you won\u2019t exist, and neither will I.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTJ,\u201d Cyrus sighed. </p><p>TJ\n shook his head, jaw tightening. \u201cIt\u2019s what\u2019s best. You shouldn\u2019t hang \nout with people like me. They\u2019re all right, Cyrus.\u201d Cyrus noted how \nsoftly his name tumbled from TJ\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cBut I want to.\u201d Cyrus \nsaid, searching TJ\u2019s eyes, unafraid of what he might uncover. \u201cWhat\u2019s \nbest for me, is you. You\u2019ve given me more than anyone else ever has, \nyou\u2019ve shown me what the world can really be. And I won\u2019t go down \nwithout a fight.\u201d </p><p>TJ softened, a twinkle blossoming in his eye. \u201cSo what do you suggest, Goodman?\u201d </p><p>Cyrus shrugged, \u201cDid I tell you my mother wants me to join a school club to avoid you?\u201d </p><p>TJ\n smiled, catching on. \u201cI suppose now that I can\u2019t hang out with my best \nfriend, I need something to fill my time, and my mother wouldn\u2019t be \nopposed to me focusing my energy on something involving school and my \ncommunity.\u201d </p><p>Grinning, Cyrus reached into his back pocket, and \npulled out a neatly folded piece of paper. Written neatly in glitter \npen, was an organized (alphabetically, of course) list of every school \nclub that Jefferson Middle had to offer.</p>",

When Cyrus&rsquo; mother\n learns &nbsp;that this kid might be rolling with the wrong crowds, she \ndecides that &nbsp;it&rsquo;s best that the two of them stop hanging out, \ndetermined to remain &nbsp;friends, Cyrus and the new boy, TJ, create their \nown club called TJ and &nbsp;Cyrus&rsquo; Totally No Fun Club, an undercover tutor \nclub, where they &nbsp;actually go on adventures, get into some not too \ntroublesome trouble, &nbsp;and fall in love. <br /></p><p>The days that followed were nothing short of exciting in every \nsecond. Cyrus felt as if he&rsquo;d been reborn into a world that flipped \nupside down from his own. His shoulders weren&rsquo;t tense anymore, and he \nsuddenly had all the energy in the world. He&rsquo;d stay up all hours of the \nnight talking to TJ via walkie talkies while they&rsquo;d make funny faces at \neach other from the window.</p><p>It was nearly 3am, and Cyrus was still wide awake, sitting propped up by his window, cozied up in his dinosaur pajamas. </p><p>&ldquo;Getting tired yet, Goodman?&rdquo; TJ teased, the crackle of static following.</p><p>Cyrus&rsquo; heart swam. &ldquo;In your dreams, Kippen.&rdquo; He replied, his cheeks growing suddenly warm. </p><p>&ldquo;I think you mean in your dreams, you know, because you&rsquo;re about to fall asleep.&rdquo; </p><p>Cyrus didn&rsquo;t have a reply. Instead he sank his face into his curtains, in vein attempt to wash away the heat. </p><p>&ldquo;Cy,\n I just got a text from Reed.&rdquo; TJ crackled. Well that worked, Cyrus \nthought, because all of a sudden his chest wasn&rsquo;t flipping. &ldquo;He wants to\n meet up right now.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus popped up through his window, facing \nTJ. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that sound a little weird to you? Like it&rsquo;s the worst \npossible idea ever?&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Dude,&rdquo; TJ said into the device. &ldquo;This is \nReed we&rsquo;re talking about. He&rsquo;s always weird. Get ready, b&rsquo;cause we&rsquo;re \nleaving in five.&rdquo; </p><p>Cyrus gulped, looking at his clock. Maybe TJ \nwas right. All Reed had been lately, was really good. He hadn&rsquo;t bullied \nGus, or anyone else, he let Cyrus sit with him at lunch, he helped a \ncouple kids with their homework, which thinking back, Cyrus assumed it \nwas most likely just cheating. </p><p>Giving in, he slid on a pair of \nreal clothes and tiptoed down the steps and onto the lawn where he \nwaited for TJ to appear. Butterflies swarmed in his stomach, but not \nbecause of TJ. Cyrus had snuck out of his house a total of three times, \nsince he&rsquo;d met TJ on Monday, and it was only Friday. </p><p>TJ wheeled \nout, and Cyrus climbed on behind him. It was natural to him, now. He \ndidn&rsquo;t worry about hugging too tight, or feeling awkward. His hands \nfound TJ&rsquo;s waist like imprints of his arms had been carved into his \nstomach.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s rock n roll,&rdquo; TJ whispered to himself as he went off, Cyrus leaning his chin into the other boy&rsquo;s shoulder. </p><p>The\n world passing by seemed like it belonged to them. They were the kings \nand planet earth was their palace, street lights like torches raised to \ntheir dignified reign. They painted the city in the colors they chose, \nand the people would one day see Cyrus the way TJ did, strong and brave,\n loyal and worthy to be seen. Cyrus appreciated TJ in a way that was \nbeyond comprehensible words. He saw wonderment and the avant-garde in \nhim, like nobody else ever had. TJ somehow made Cyrus leave behind his \ncaution and uncover his capriciousness and he was unconditionally \ngrateful. </p><p>When TJ stopped and climbed off the bike, Cyrus could \nbarely see anything until his eyes adjusted. Soon he discovered they \nstood in the mouth of a big, foul smelling alleyway. </p><p>&ldquo;What are doing here, TJ?&rdquo; Cyrus whispered, grabbing his sleeve nervously.</p><p>TJ shook his head, sucking in a deep breath. &ldquo;No idea. Said it was urgent.&rdquo; </p><p>Cyrus gulped, &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t look urgent to me. It looks like an alleyway.&rdquo;</p><p>From\n the opposite end of the alley, Reed peaked his head around the corner \nand waved them over. Cyrus and TJ looked at each other before following \nafter him their shoes echoing on the concrete. </p><p>When the two of \nthem rounded the corner, Cyrus&rsquo; heart stopped. Reed and two other boys \nwere spray painting the front of a building with big fat letters, \nspelling out their hatred of the less fortunate people of the city. They\n were laughing while playing less than respectful music, their words \ncontinuing into a brand new set of vocabulary words that Cyrus wasn&rsquo;t \neven sure he knew. </p><p>&ldquo;What the hell are you doing man?&rdquo; TJ said, \nafter reading their artwork. He knocked the spray can out of Reed&rsquo;s hand\n and shoved him back. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Dude,&rdquo; Reed said, stumbling. &ldquo;We thought you guys were cool.&rdquo; He liked his lips angrily, &ldquo;But I guess we were wrong, huh.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You said we were hanging out.&rdquo; TJ shook his head in betrayal, stepping forward towards Reed, towering over him. </p><p>&ldquo;Well what the fuck does it look like we&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo; </p><p>TJ\n laughed, anger boiling in his voice, and Cyrus stepped forward, ready \nto break them apart, when one of Reed&rsquo;s goons grabbed his collar and \nswung him around. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, keep your hands off him.&rdquo; TJ called, and \nwithout a second thought, his fist flew into the boys face, knocking him\n over. Within the span of seconds, boys were kicking, hitting and \npunching each other, yells flying, words being aggressively exchanged. \nCyrus stepped away from the group, his heart racing. TJ was on the \nfloor, practically getting his head kicked in, three against one. </p><p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Cyrus screamed, his voice cracking. &ldquo;Please!&rdquo; </p><p>Suddenly, sirens began to blare and a police car peeled down the alley.</p><p>&ldquo;Rat\n on us, Goodman, and you&rsquo;re both fuckin&rsquo; dead.&rdquo; Reed said frantically as\n he and his friends picked themselves up and shoved passed Cyrus. </p><p>Cyrus quickly slid over to TJ, and helped him up from the ground, his eye puffy and his lip sliced.<br />\n&ldquo;Step away from the paint cans and put your hands up.&rdquo; The cop shouted \nover his flashlight. TJ and Cyrus looked at each other. All TJ could get\n out was a broken &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rsquo;. </p><p>&mdash;</p><p>After being called back \nto the station, the boys&rsquo; mothers&rsquo; arrived to pick them up. TJ&rsquo;s mother \narrived in a hurricane of yells and crying. Cyrus&rsquo; mother came silently,\n icy and distant. She didn&rsquo;t say a word. The ride home was equally as \nsilent. Cyrus cried softly, his headache against the chilly glass of the\n car window. The street lights were no longer torches raised to his \ndignified reign. They were simply street lights, dimly lighting the \nsuburban neighborhood where he lived.</p><p>Cyrus&rsquo; mother put him to \nbed, and the next morning, woke him with a cup of tea and a piece of \npaper. Cyrus sat up and rubbed his eyes confusedly, his headache droning\n on in the background of his thoughts. </p><p>&ldquo;Morning, Cyrus.&rdquo; Leslie \nsaid, sitting at the foot of his bed. She usually greeted him with a \ngoodmorning and a kiss on the forehead, but that morning she refrained. </p><p>Cyrus\n looked around, remembering the previous night, stomach sinking. &ldquo;Can I \ngo see if TJ&rsquo;s okay?&rdquo; He asked suddenly, the image of his beaten up face\n flashing in his mind. </p><p>Leslie sighed, folding her hands over her knees. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I came in here to talk about,&rdquo; </p><p>Stomach dropping, Cyrus sat up straight. &ldquo;Is he okay?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just fine.&rdquo; His mother said flatly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tell you a story, and you&rsquo;re going to drink your tea and listen.&rdquo; </p><p>Confused, Cyrus nodded, grasping the warm mug in his hands. </p><p>&ldquo;When\n I was your age, I had a friend named Marcus. I thought Marcus was the \nmost amazing thing ever. He showed me music I&rsquo;d never heard, places I \nnever knew existed. He showed me the world from his painting palette, \nand I was never the same. I got into bad things, I met bad people, and I\n went down the wrong path. I got addicted to the feeling of rarity and \nthe charisma of life.<br />\nOne day, I realized the people around me were hurting from decisions I&rsquo;d\n made. I knew I had to let him go. It was like I was sawing through my \nown heart.&rdquo; She smiled sadly into the distance. &ldquo;I want you to let go \nbefore you have to saw your own heart in half.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Cyrus asked, welling. </p><p>&ldquo;Starting today, you and TJ will not be allowed to see each other. Kate and I believe it&rsquo;s best for the both of you.&rdquo; </p><p>Cyrus\n stood up, slamming his tea onto his desk. &ldquo;No! That&rsquo;s so unfair. TJ \nwould never hurt me, or get me to do bad things. Last night wasn&rsquo;t him \nand you know it!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus,&rdquo; Leslie said calmly, with a firm \ndiction to it. &ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m an idiot? I know you&rsquo;ve snuck out three\n nights this week. I know you stay up until three in the morning every \nnight. All your life you&rsquo;ve made it a personal goal to get all A&rsquo;s, and \nyou know I don&rsquo;t care about grades, but you got a C in your math test \nthis week.&rdquo; </p><p>Cyrus didn&rsquo;t say anything, he knew he&rsquo;d cry if he did. </p><p>&ldquo;Honey,\n if TJ really cares about you, he wouldn&rsquo;t be putting you in harms way. \nThat&rsquo;s not what love is. So, from here on out, you won&rsquo;t be speaking \nwith him over walkie talkie, no texting or phone calls, and no hanging \nout, before or after school.&rdquo; </p><p>He didn&rsquo;t care anymore. He let his tears fall. Maybe she&rsquo;d change her mind if she saw how torn up he really was. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re\n going to join a school club, and find a hobby. Make some new friends, \nand find some new people you click with while your other friends are \ngetting ready for Battle of the Bands.&rdquo; </p><p>Cyrus whirled around \ngrabbing his shoes and jacket. Leslie laughed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re grounded until \nMonday. You&rsquo;re not leaving this house until then. If you want friends \nover, fine, but you&rsquo;re staying put. Two days isn&rsquo;t torture.&rdquo; </p><p>Cyrus,\n almost bursting with emotion didn&rsquo;t know what to do. He yelled at his \nmother, face flooding with tears. &ldquo;Get out of my room!&rdquo; He roared, \nturning to yank open the curtains. The window across the street was \nlocked, blinds newly installed, curtains drawn. </p><p>Hours later, \nCyrus&rsquo; face still buried in his pillow, a knock sounded on his bedroom \ndoor. &ldquo;Go away mom,&rdquo; He said through a muffled facefull of pillowcase.</p><p>The\n door creaked open and footsteps tiptoed to his bedside. &ldquo;Not mom,&rdquo; A \nsoft voice, which he knew belonged to Buffy, said. She rolled on top of \nhim, enveloping him in a big bear hug. A second pair of arms found him. \nAndi. </p><p>Cyrus sat up, embarrassed from his tears. &ldquo;Hey guys,&rdquo; He \nslumped over, leaning on Andi&rsquo;s shoulder, taking Buffy&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m \nbeing over dramatic, aren&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; </p><p>Buffy giggled. &ldquo;Maybe just a teeny weeny bit.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I\n just feel so, I don&rsquo;t know, present, when I&rsquo;m hanging out with him. \nWith everyone else, I feel invisible, and unimportant.&rdquo; He looked over \nhis shoulder to the window. </p><p>Andi sighed. &ldquo;You know that isn&rsquo;t the case, Cyrus. We love you so much.&rdquo; </p><p>Cyrus\n pushed off from the bed, ignoring Andi&rsquo;s statement. He stood up and \nbegan pacing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gotta fix this. This is totally unfair, its \ninjustice! He did nothing wrong, and I won&rsquo;t stand for this tyranny.&rdquo; \nCyrus shouted, as if he was giving an important speech. </p><p>Buffy and Andi looked at each other with knowing smiles.<br />\nCyrus pulled out his colored coordinated glitter pens and a pad of plain paper and set to work out a plan. </p><p>&mdash;</p><p>The\n next morning Cyrus waited outside for Jonah as per usual. Across the \nstreet, the garage door opened, and Cyrus jumped. At least he&rsquo;d be able \nto see TJ and hang out with him before and during school. But TJ didn&rsquo;t \nemerge. Instead, the car rolled out, and from the opened car window, \nCyrus caught a glimpse of TJ in the side mirrors. He looked distraught, \nhis forehead creased into lines of worry and frustration. Cyrus&rsquo; stomach\n ached. It really was the end, huh?</p><p>Jonah approached Cyrus, his face falling as soon as he captured a glimpse of him. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, man? You look terrible.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus\n huffed out a frustrated laugh. &ldquo;Thanks, Jo.&rdquo; He drawled sarcastically. \n&ldquo;I got in trouble with the police this weekend, so I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll \nbe seeing much of TJ anymore either.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Woah, dude,&rdquo; Jonah \nbreathed out, shaking his head lightly. &ldquo;TJ&rsquo;s in jail? I always knew \nthat guy was a bad influence but&hellip;&rdquo; The two boys began their trek to \nschool. </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not in jail, Jonah, we&rsquo;re just not allowed to hang out anymore.&rdquo; Cyrus kicked up a rock and it clattered on the sidewalk. </p><p>&ldquo;Dude, that totally sucks. He&rsquo;s sick, and not the good kind.&rdquo; </p><p>Cyrus\n shook his head, clenching his backpack straps in his palms. &ldquo;It just \nnot fair. Imagine if you were just suddenly not allowed to hang out \nwith, I dunno, Walker.&rdquo;</p><p>Jonah furrowed his brow and a breath hitched. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s different,&rdquo; Jonah muttered softly. </p><p>Cyrus scanned his friend&rsquo;s face, and knowingly nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure it is.&rdquo; </p><p>A\n sad smile quirked at the side of Jonah&rsquo;s mouth as he tossed his arm \naround Cyrus&rsquo; shoulder and nuzzled his head against the other&rsquo;s. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll\n figure this out, Cy.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I sure hope so,&rdquo; Cyrus sighed before he and Jonah parted ways. </p><p>A\n moment later, Cyrus spotted TJ talking to one of his basketball \nfriends. He started to walk over to approach him, but as soon as TJ saw \nhim, he turned away, walking in the opposite direction with his friend. \nConfused and hurt, Cyrus sank. Great, he thought, now he was avoiding \nhim. His mother had probably ruined everything. He knew her intentions \nwere pure, but he boiled inwardly. </p><p>Cyrus hadn&rsquo;t realized he&rsquo;d \nbeen staring until Buffy and Andi swooped him up, towing Walker and \nMarty behind them. The two girls looped their arms through his and \nguided him in the direction to their first class. Cyrus was grateful to \nnever be left alone in his classes. He had Buffy and Andi sitting beside\n him in first period English, Marty took Spanish with him in second \nperiod. Third period was biology with Jonah and Andi, History with Buffy\n and Walker, Math with TJ and Buffy and so on. </p><p>As they lead him \nto class, Cyrus passed TJ, and with Buffy and Andi by his side, they \nslid by with their heads held high, arms interlocked. Cyrus&rsquo; stomach \nturned anyway. He wasn&rsquo;t good at being petty, though his best friends \nwere connoisseurs of the art. The day continued to drag on and on, as if\n it had taken place and whole new realm of time. Every time he passed \nTJ, his friends would force him in the opposite direction, and everytime\n he was without them, TJ seemed to avoid him just as equally. </p><p>Every\n passing day was the same. He&rsquo;d walk to school with Jonah, see TJ, who \nwould ultimately see him, and turn away. His friends would wrestle him \nthrough the halls and force his eyes away at lunch. He&rsquo;d go home, look \nout the window to see the mirroring one closed tight, and no matter \nwhere he looked, he couldn&rsquo;t find where his mother had hidden his walkie\n talkie. </p><p>The Sunday of that heart achingly long week, Cyrus paced\n his bedroom floors until he&rsquo;d practically dug a ditch. Picking at his \nfingernails and focusing his breath, he finally decided to do what \nneeded to be done. He grabbed the folded up piece of paper on his desk \nand shoved it in his back pocket.</p><p>Cyrus peaked out his door, ready\n to leave, but his mother and stepfather were sitting right on the couch\n watching a scary movie. Knowing they&rsquo;d have to watch a second, more \nlight hearted movie afterwards, both of them would be staying up for \nhours. Cyrus decided to use another method. </p><p>Heart racing, he \npushed away his anxieties in his urgency and shimmied out of his window,\n climbing down tree limbs and roofs until he was close enough to jump to\n the ground, which, instead of leaping to the ground gracefully as he&rsquo;d \npreviously planned, he fell flat on his face. Brushing himself off, he \nran across the street and did his best to climb up to TJ&rsquo;s window, \nslipping a couple times. He wiggled out onto a thick limb and hopped \nonto the sloping roof that lead to the windowsill. </p><p>Cyrus closed \nhis eyes and sucked in a deep breath, and with a thundering chest, he \nknocked lightly on the window. Within a minute, the glass panes slipped \nopened. </p><p>TJ peaked out through the curtains, confusion painted \nbrightly across his eyes, a small smile twitching at the corner of his \nlips. His hair was messy and he was wearing his glasses. Cyrus tried not\n to sway too much, in fear of diving straight off the roof. </p><p>After\n finally registering, TJ practically pulled Cyrus through the window and\n pushed him into his desk chair. &ldquo;What the hell are you doing here, \nman?&rdquo; He whispered harshly, shuffling over to lock his door. </p><p>Cyrus\n stood up, frustrated. &ldquo;I needed to see you. I wanted to make sure you \nwere okay. That&hellip;we are okay.&rdquo; Cyrus studied TJ&rsquo;s face. The cut on his \nlip was still visible, but he looked okay other than that. Better than \nokay, Cyrus thought. Just looking at him his stomach do backflips and \ntwists and front walkovers and every other kind of gymnastics too. </p><p>TJ\n drug his hands over his face, clearly distraught. &ldquo;You realize, you \ncoming here is just making things worse. If we just let things blow \nover, it&rsquo;ll all be okay in a month.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus stepped closer. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t. I know my mother and if she thinks I&rsquo;m in danger in anyway, she won&rsquo;t relent.&rdquo; </p><p>TJ,\n inched forward as well. &ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s just what&rsquo;s going to have to \nhappen. Your friends and your mother and your goodie-two-shoes guilty \nconscience will tell you to stay away from me, and you will. And I&rsquo;ll go\n on, pretending not to see you in the halls, or in math class. And when \nyou pass me at lunch, you won&rsquo;t exist, and neither will I.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;TJ,&rdquo; Cyrus sighed. </p><p>TJ\n shook his head, jaw tightening. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s best. You shouldn&rsquo;t hang \nout with people like me. They&rsquo;re all right, Cyrus.&rdquo; Cyrus noted how \nsoftly his name tumbled from TJ&rsquo;s mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;But I want to.&rdquo; Cyrus \nsaid, searching TJ&rsquo;s eyes, unafraid of what he might uncover. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s \nbest for me, is you. You&rsquo;ve given me more than anyone else ever has, \nyou&rsquo;ve shown me what the world can really be. And I won&rsquo;t go down \nwithout a fight.&rdquo; </p><p>TJ softened, a twinkle blossoming in his eye. &ldquo;So what do you suggest, Goodman?&rdquo; </p><p>Cyrus shrugged, &ldquo;Did I tell you my mother wants me to join a school club to avoid you?&rdquo; </p><p>TJ\n smiled, catching on. &ldquo;I suppose now that I can&rsquo;t hang out with my best \nfriend, I need something to fill my time, and my mother wouldn&rsquo;t be \nopposed to me focusing my energy on something involving school and my \ncommunity.&rdquo; </p><p>Grinning, Cyrus reached into his back pocket, and \npulled out a neatly folded piece of paper. Written neatly in glitter \npen, was an organized (alphabetically, of course) list of every school \nclub that Jefferson Middle had to offer.</p>",

                "content": "<p>There was a lot Cyrus didn&rsquo;t know about TJ.<b><br /></b></p><p>He never mentioned his older sister in high school, his extensive vinyl collection, and his job at a children&rsquo;s gym until far into their friendship, making it seem to Cyrus like he hid things. It was secretive, like he had this whole world buzzing inside him that Cyrus couldn&rsquo;t get into.</p><p>The biggest problem came when he took action. He had ideas, bad ones, that Cyrus couldn&rsquo;t predict until it was too late. His poker face was solid.</p><p>However, on Saturday night, he fidgeted in fear.</p><p>They sat on the edge of TJ&rsquo;s bed, Cyrus rubbing his back comfortingly.</p><p>&ldquo;Breathe. Everything is going to work out fine,&rdquo; he assured him.</p><p>TJ&rsquo;s eyes were locked outside his window. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t possibly know that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;ll be bad, either,&rdquo; Cyrus argued, shifting closer.</p><p>He remained silent, lost in thought.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you thinking about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus bit his tongue so he didn&rsquo;t scream at him and decided to change the subject. &nbsp;&ldquo;So you remember the plan we talked about?&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded simply, and Cyrus stared at him until he recited it back. &ldquo;We walk downstairs and ask them to pause their movie. I say &lsquo;Mom and Dad, I have something important I want to tell you.&rsquo; to get their attention politely. Then, I just come out to them using words from my heart.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus was fidgety, himself. How would TJ&rsquo;s mom and dad react? Would they be okay with their son, the student athlete since diapers wanting to marry a boy? All Cyrus could do was help him learn the social cues of an emotional, serious conversation and hope to goes well. He gripped TJ&rsquo;s arm, forcing him to look up.</p><p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re sure they&rsquo;re watching some stupid comedy movie down there they wouldn&rsquo;t mind you interrupting?&rdquo; </p><p>TJ chuckled, laying a hand on his shoulder. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Cyrus, they are. Trust me, okay. I&rsquo;ve practiced for hours today, and I&rsquo;m not gonna mess up any part of the plan, let alone the most obvious.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus nodded and steadied his breath, trusting him for the first time in a while. Of course he knew what he was doing, he convinced himself. He&rsquo;s coming out to his parents and he was always one to get the results he wanted. </p><p>&ldquo;You ready to go?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ready as I&rsquo;ll ever be.&rdquo;</p><p>He tiptoed down the dark, wooden stairwell behind TJ, careful not to misstep and fall. Nearing the doorway to the living room, an indiscernible conversation played out between characters as soft lights flashed from the screen. Adam Sandler, he expected.</p><p>However when the screen emerged into full view, all the breath left Cyrus&rsquo;s lungs.</p><p><i>Fucking Schindler&rsquo;s List</i></p><p>Before he could yank the dumbass back up to the second story, the room lit up and the screen went black. His heart broke for TJ&rsquo;s mother and father, curled up together on the couch, their faces wet with Liam Neeson induced tears, while TJ stood chest puffed out in front of them ready to take more of the touching moment and crumble it under his socks. </p><p>But the biggest shard to the rib was Jefferson Middle School offering Beginning Spanish as an elective that year. </p><p>&ldquo;Madre, &lsquo;Fadre&rsquo;, I have something important I want to tell you.&rdquo;</p><p>He imagined TJ chucking the script they wrote together in the garbage can.</p><p>&ldquo;Honey, what is it?&rdquo; his mother asked through her sniffles.</p><p>Cyrus&rsquo;s heart hammered in his chest and he felt himself go dizzy thinking about what the next words coming out of his mouth would be. There was too much freedom in the plan; too much wiggle room for TJ to do something stupid. His parents were frozen, waiting expectantly. </p><p>Then, TJ took a breath.</p><p>It was a small and insignificant, but Cyrus recognized it. He had the same small inhale and exhale, along with the somber look in his eyes, months prior when he and Cyrus were starting to get close. It was one of the first of many unexpected talents he revealed to him.</p><p>And now, he was going to come out to his parents that way, and there was nothing Cyrus could do to stop him.</p><p>&ldquo;Kaitlyn, Jenny, Clarissa, and Jane;</p><p>All the girls you used to tease me &lsquo;bout like Lois Lane.</p><p>Had them whip-smart, pretty faces, home after school.</p><p>Now they dating round Jefferson with boo boo the fools.</p><p>I never really subscribed, never kept up with the drama,</p><p>But I&rsquo;ve been hecka hearin&rsquo; Jenny&rsquo;s hecka grounded by her mama.</p><p>Kaitlin&rsquo;s in some trouble, Lester says she been suspended.</p><p>And Jane and Clary both got B.F.&rsquo;s driving with no license.</p><p>Nothing &lsquo;gainst the straight girls but I know that things be different</p><p>If I&rsquo;d gone to dating them, my life would turn rebellious.</p><p>Yeah, they dummy influences, but that&rsquo;s really not the point.</p><p>The problem is they female, and girls just not my type.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ&rsquo;s parents only gave each other warm smiles, still curled up between blankets on the couch.</p><p>&ldquo;Lookit, Mom and Dad,</p><p>I&rsquo;m gay and &lsquo;aint no synonym</p><p>For the gritty love I got for you from L.A., York, and Texas, even</p><p>Cheering hard at soccer games</p><p>B-ball, football, frisbee winning</p><p>Got my C-plus on the fridge before I saw the grade, myself, last season.</p><p>I&rsquo;m reaching for the boys living in all of little Shady County.</p><p>Cy and I are swinging crazy, but not the way you&rsquo;re thinking, really.</p><p>I know it won&rsquo;t be peasy,</p><p>But it&rsquo;s dudes that make me cheesy,</p><p>And I know my folks believe me,</p><p>Cause they wake up every morning loving me like all the world is easy.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ regained his breath and sighed in relief, baffled at himself. Cyrus watched as Mr. and Mrs. Kippen, looking nothing but proud, ran over to their son to hold him tightly at the same time, his arms locked down by theirs. </p><p>It appeared that there was no one method to do it, after all. Cyrus laughed to himself, thinking about the absurdity of his precious plan. TJ was one of a kind, and when there was no stopping him, it was probably best anyway that he let him do his own thing.</p><p>When TJ finally broke free, he jogged over to Cyrus and, surprisingly, hugged him, too. As he let go, he hoped he didn&rsquo;t see his cheeks go red.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, I made a few minor adjustments. I hope that wasn&rsquo;t too weird or unpredictable for you.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus laughed, because it totally was. &ldquo;It was perfect.&rdquo;</p>",

Did you talk to your parents about it last night?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d TJ shakes his head with his gaze pointed at the ground as he walks, \u201cIt was late last night&hellip; I\u2019ll ask tonight though.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d Cyrus nods and he\u00a0tries to build the courage to bring up what he really wanted to talk about. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d TJ agrees unsuspectingly. </p><p>\u201cWhy is it you don\u2019t like Christmas?\u201d Cyrus finally questions. </p><p>\u201cLike I said at lunch-\u201c </p><p>\u201cI heard what you said at lunch and at dinner with my family,\u201d Cyrus looks to TJ as they walk before having to look forward again, \u201cBut I want to know the real reason.\u201d </p><p>TJ rolls his eyes, \u201cYou know you can be so ann-\u201c </p><p>\u201cAnnoying, judgey, yeah I know.\u201d Cyrus says, \u201cYou also said I was the only person you could talk to like this.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou open up to someone once or twice and then they get all pushy about it.\u201d TJ says with a huff. \u201cI just don\u2019t like Christmas okay? Most of my memories surrounding Christmas are bad and I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it would make you feel better?\u201d Cyrus insists,\u00a0\u201cMaybe I could help?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do, cry about my family issues?\u201d TJ snips.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had problems at home.\u201d Cyrus frowns.\u00a0\u201cI never go to your house.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah and there\u2019s a reason for that.\u201d TJ continues to be brash,\u00a0\u201c<i>Poor TJ has family issues.</i>\u201d He snaps,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019d make something out of nothing.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t feel like nothing.\u201d Cyrus stops walking and he forces TJ to as well.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt must be exhausting trying to fix everyone all the time.\u201d TJ shakes his head with a sigh.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTJ that\u2019s not what I\u2019m-\u201d Cyrus drops his sentence with a frown.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to walk home together anymore.\u201d TJ states with a frustrated breath.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTJ, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Cyrus says almost desperately.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cForget it.\u201d TJ shakes his head before leaving Cyrus there alone.<br/></p><p>Although Cyrus wanted to, he knew there was no use chasing after TJ, instead he remains in place and watches as TJ disappears down the street.\u00a0</p><p>-</p><p>The following day after school Cyrus is at the busy mall in town donating his time to wrap presents, the proceeds from the stall go towards Christmas gifts for children from families in need. Ever since Cyrus was old enough to understand the concept of paying it forward, he had made an effort to give back. It was something Cyrus tries to do all the time but come the holiday season, he makes a conscious effort to do at least one good thing that gives back to the community. This is a ritual of sorts that he shares with his father.</p><p>Cyrus had been at the stall for an hour now and whilst he wrapped he also vented to the lady in charge about how TJ had been avoiding him all day. \u201cI just wish he\u2019d speak to me,\u201d Cyrus exhales heavily and then as if he had wished it into existence, Cyrus spots TJ coming out of a small store not too far from the booth he is at. Cyrus asks the lady for permission to take a five minute break and after listening to him go on for an hour she welcomed the idea of a quiet five minutes. </p><p>Cyrus quickly make his way over to the store and TJ looks surprised and a little uncomfortable when he notices Cyrus. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d TJ asks. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not stalking you even though it may look like I am,\u201d Cyrus laughs nervously, \u201cI\u2019m over at the gift wrapping stall.\u201d </p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d TJ still comes across as distant.</p><p>\u201cYou avoided me at school today and haven\u2019t been answering any of my texts since we had a,<i> fight?</i>\u201d Cyrus poses it like a question because he wasn\u2019t really sure what that exchange of words yesterday afternoon was.</p><p>\u201cBeing ignored kind of sucks, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d TJ scoffs. </p><p>A frown falls on Cyrus\u2019 face as he knew TJ was referring to the all too troubling gun incident. \u201cI wanted to talk to you.\u201d Cyrus is firm. \u201cI went to text you a dozen times but Andi and Buffy wouldn\u2019t let me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI was worried you were just as happy to avoid me.\u201d TJ goes a little mumbly. </p><p>\u201cYou noticed the part where they physically stopped me from going over to you, right?\u201d Cyrus lets out a single laugh. </p><p>TJ breaks his annoyed look with a hint of a smile although he squashes it quickly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNewsflash, TJ, I like you-\u201c Cyrus frets at his choice of words, \u201cYou\u2019re my friend\u2026 And I just wanted to know if something was wrong. I can be pushy and I was yesterday so I am sorry for prying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that is?\u201d TJ asks and Cyrus\u2019 pained expression deepens, he didn\u2019t know what else to be sorry for. </p><p>\u201cMaybe I do have a habit of trying to fix things and I can definitely be pushy so I genuinely apologise for that. I hope you know I\u2019d <i>never </i>want to force you to talk about something you didn\u2019t want to but I can\u2019t apologise for wanting to help. I don\u2019t see people - <i>you</i> - as broken or needing improvement, I just don\u2019t like seeing people I care about upset. So I can\u2019t say sorry for that because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad quality to have.\u201d </p><p>TJ\u2019s annoyed look is now completely foiled by a soft smile even despite his best efforts to squash it again. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad quality either.\u201d</p><p>A smiley moment passes by before Cyrus breaks sheepishly, \u201cSo, what brings you to the mall on a Tuesday afternoon?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the twins birthday tomorrow. I had to pick something up for them for my mom.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWow, their birthday is so close to the holidays, that must be an expensive time of year for your family.\u201d Cyrus says and immediately his face falls with a worried expression, \u201cThat wasn\u2019t me prying I swear.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d TJ says. \u201cIt is an expensive time of year.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to..\u201d Cyrus shakes his head as he didn\u2019t mean to seem like he wanted an explanation from TJ.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to.\u201d TJ says,\u00a0\u201cIt was the worst Christmas ever and I don\u2019t really feel like reliving that right now.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI respect that.\u201d Cyrus nods.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m really sorry for whatever it is and I am here to talk if and whenever you want.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d TJ nods slightly with a weak smile.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cEven though I\u2019m respecting your boundaries can I still say something to try and\u00a0\u2018fix\u2019 it?\u201d Cyrus uses air quotes and this makes TJ smile.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou can try.\u201d TJ shrugs.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve already had the worst Christmas ever, that means every Christmas is potentially the best one yet.\u201d Cyrus smiles,\u00a0\u201cIt would be a shame to miss out on that because you don\u2019t give the holidays a chance.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>TJ coaxes his head with furrowed brows and looks like he\u2019s absorbing what Cyrus said.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cToo fortune cookie sounding?\u201d Cyrus questions.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d TJ straightens his head with a nod and shares a soft chuckle.<br/></p><p>\u201cI can do better.\u201d Cyrus assures,\u00a0\u201cLet me try again.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even celebrate Christmas,\u201d TJ highlights,\u00a0\u201cWhy does it matter to you if I want to hate it?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Cyrus is quiet for a moment, he\u2019s deep in thought about a past memory and was a little unsure if he should share it or not. Ultimately Cyrus decides to open up and continues,\u00a0\u201cWhen I was about six years old I went to the beach with my mom and I was playing in the shallow bit of the water but a wave coming in made me loose my balance and I nearly downed.\u201d Cyrus explains,\u00a0\u201cIt was awful, the most horrible moment in my life and I hated the beach after that, I thought it was the worst place in the entire world.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s terrible.\u201d TJ says genuinely,\u00a0\u201c..But I\u2019m not sure what that has to do with me and Christmas?\u201d His tone is careful not to suggest Cyrus\u2019 worst memory ever was anything less than that.<br/></p><p>\u201cMy parents took me back to the beach one day even though I begged them not to,\u201d Cyrus continues.\u00a0\u201cBut what my parents did was show me that it wasn\u2019t the beach I hated, it was that one awful memory of it.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou think sipping eggnog by the fire is going to make me feel better about my dad leaving?\u201d TJ asks and he wasn\u2019t snippy or huffy like he was the previous afternoon, he looked more defeated.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Cyrus tries not to react too much to the information TJ shared, nor does he try to push for more. If TJ wanted to open up about it he would. Instead Cyrus wears a soft and small smile,\u00a0\u201cNo but maybe it will make you happier for the ones who stayed.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>After a quiet moment passes between the two TJ lets out a heavy sigh,\u00a0\u201cDammit.\u201d He says softly under his breath.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cyrus questions.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThat made me feel better.\u201d TJ mumbles and Cyrus smiles proudly.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cSorry for being a jerk.\u201d TJ says sheepishly.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t completely undeserving.\u201d\u00a0Cyrus shrugs,\u00a0\u201c&hellip;I should probably get back to the gift stall.. Want to wrap presents with me?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs it a paid job?\u201d TJ questions.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for charity.\u201d Cyrus explains.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d TJ says,\u00a0\u201cSure, I\u2019ll help but I\u2019m lousy at gift wrapping.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>TJ\u2019s statement about his wrapping skills proved to be true as Cyrus looks at TJ\u2019s poor handiwork.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should stick to rapping apologies instead of presents.\u201d Cyrus grimaces and TJ nudges him playfully with his elbow.\u00a0</p><p>Then TJ moves on to bow duty instead and even though TJ wasn\u2019t exactly able to open up to Cyrus about his home life, somehow the two still felt closer than before.</p><hr><p><b>End Notes: </b>I hope everyone is enjoying the story so far!

Cyrus is in luck and reaches TJ just as he\u2019s leaving to exit. </p><p>\u201cWanna walk home together?\u201d Cyrus asks now by TJ\u2019s side. </p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d TJ favours the idea with a smile. </p><p>The two exit Jefferson Middle School together and both let out quiet gasps when they\u2019re hit with a gust of cold wind. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already freezing and it hasn\u2019t even started snowing yet.\u201d TJ\u2019s teeth almost chatter and he buries his hands in the pockets of his windbreaker. </p><p>\u201cYou know they say the longer it takes for first snowfall the worse the snow will be?\u201d Cyrus also hides his hands in his coat pockets. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard that before.\u201d TJ says with a laugh. </p><p>Cyrus laughs too, \u201cGood thing the ski lodge is in the mountain so it\u2019s already snowing there. Did you talk to your parents about it last night?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d TJ shakes his head with his gaze pointed at the ground as he walks, \u201cIt was late last night\u2026 I\u2019ll ask tonight though.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d Cyrus nods and he\u00a0tries to build the courage to bring up what he really wanted to talk about. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d TJ agrees unsuspectingly. </p><p>\u201cWhy is it you don\u2019t like Christmas?\u201d Cyrus finally questions. </p><p>\u201cLike I said at lunch-\u201c </p><p>\u201cI heard what you said at lunch and at dinner with my family,\u201d Cyrus looks to TJ as they walk before having to look forward again, \u201cBut I want to know the real reason.\u201d </p><p>TJ rolls his eyes, \u201cYou know you can be so ann-\u201c </p><p>\u201cAnnoying, judgey, yeah I know.\u201d Cyrus says, \u201cYou also said I was the only person you could talk to like this.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou open up to someone once or twice and then they get all pushy about it.\u201d TJ says with a huff. \u201cI just don\u2019t like Christmas okay? Most of my memories surrounding Christmas are bad and I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it would make you feel better?\u201d Cyrus insists,\u00a0\u201cMaybe I could help?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do, cry about my family issues?\u201d TJ snips.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had problems at home.\u201d Cyrus frowns.\u00a0\u201cI never go to your house.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah and there\u2019s a reason for that.\u201d TJ continues to be brash,\u00a0\u201c<i>Poor TJ has family issues.</i>\u201d He snaps,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019d make something out of nothing.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t feel like nothing.\u201d Cyrus stops walking and he forces TJ to as well.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt must be exhausting trying to fix everyone all the time.\u201d TJ shakes his head with a sigh.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTJ that\u2019s not what I\u2019m-\u201d Cyrus drops his sentence with a frown.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to walk home together anymore.\u201d TJ states with a frustrated breath.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTJ, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Cyrus says almost desperately.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cForget it.\u201d TJ shakes his head before leaving Cyrus there alone.<br></p><p>Although Cyrus wanted to, he knew there was no use chasing after TJ, instead he remains in place and watches as TJ disappears down the street.\u00a0</p><p>-</p><p>The following day after school Cyrus is at the busy mall in town donating his time to wrap presents, the proceeds from the stall go towards Christmas gifts for children from families in need. Ever since Cyrus was old enough to understand the concept of paying it forward, he had made an effort to give back. It was something Cyrus tries to do all the time but come the holiday season, he makes a conscious effort to do at least one good thing that gives back to the community. This is a ritual of sorts that he shares with his father.</p><p>Cyrus had been at the stall for an hour now and whilst he wrapped he also vented to the lady in charge about how TJ had been avoiding him all day. \u201cI just wish he\u2019d speak to me,\u201d Cyrus exhales heavily and then as if he had wished it into existence, Cyrus spots TJ coming out of a small store not too far from the booth he is at. Cyrus asks the lady for permission to take a five minute break and after listening to him go on for an hour she welcomed the idea of a quiet five minutes. </p><p>Cyrus quickly make his way over to the store and TJ looks surprised and a little uncomfortable when he notices Cyrus. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d TJ asks. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not stalking you even though it may look like I am,\u201d Cyrus laughs nervously, \u201cI\u2019m over at the gift wrapping stall.\u201d </p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d TJ still comes across as distant.</p><p>\u201cYou avoided me at school today and haven\u2019t been answering any of my texts since we had a,<i> fight?</i>\u201d Cyrus poses it like a question because he wasn\u2019t really sure what that exchange of words yesterday afternoon was.</p><p>\u201cBeing ignored kind of sucks, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d TJ scoffs. </p><p>A frown falls on Cyrus\u2019 face as he knew TJ was referring to the all too troubling gun incident. \u201cI wanted to talk to you.\u201d Cyrus is firm. \u201cI went to text you a dozen times but Andi and Buffy wouldn\u2019t let me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI was worried you were just as happy to avoid me.\u201d TJ goes a little mumbly. </p><p>\u201cYou noticed the part where they physically stopped me from going over to you, right?\u201d Cyrus lets out a single laugh. </p><p>TJ breaks his annoyed look with a hint of a smile although he squashes it quickly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNewsflash, TJ, I like you-\u201c Cyrus frets at his choice of words, \u201cYou\u2019re my friend\u2026 And I just wanted to know if something was wrong. I can be pushy and I was yesterday so I am sorry for prying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that is?\u201d TJ asks and Cyrus\u2019 pained expression deepens, he didn\u2019t know what else to be sorry for. </p><p>\u201cMaybe I do have a habit of trying to fix things and I can definitely be pushy so I genuinely apologise for that. I hope you know I\u2019d <i>never </i>want to force you to talk about something you didn\u2019t want to but I can\u2019t apologise for wanting to help. I don\u2019t see people - <i>you</i> - as broken or needing improvement, I just don\u2019t like seeing people I care about upset. So I can\u2019t say sorry for that because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad quality to have.\u201d </p><p>TJ\u2019s annoyed look is now completely foiled by a soft smile even despite his best efforts to squash it again. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad quality either.\u201d</p><p>A smiley moment passes by before Cyrus breaks sheepishly, \u201cSo, what brings you to the mall on a Tuesday afternoon?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the twins birthday tomorrow. I had to pick something up for them for my mom.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWow, their birthday is so close to the holidays, that must be an expensive time of year for your family.\u201d Cyrus says and immediately his face falls with a worried expression, \u201cThat wasn\u2019t me prying I swear.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d TJ says. \u201cIt is an expensive time of year.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to..\u201d Cyrus shakes his head as he didn\u2019t mean to seem like he wanted an explanation from TJ.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to.\u201d TJ says,\u00a0\u201cIt was the worst Christmas ever and I don\u2019t really feel like reliving that right now.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI respect that.\u201d Cyrus nods.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m really sorry for whatever it is and I am here to talk if and whenever you want.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d TJ nods slightly with a weak smile.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cEven though I\u2019m respecting your boundaries can I still say something to try and\u00a0\u2018fix\u2019 it?\u201d Cyrus uses air quotes and this makes TJ smile.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou can try.\u201d TJ shrugs.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve already had the worst Christmas ever, that means every Christmas is potentially the best one yet.\u201d Cyrus smiles,\u00a0\u201cIt would be a shame to miss out on that because you don\u2019t give the holidays a chance.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ coaxes his head with furrowed brows and looks like he\u2019s absorbing what Cyrus said.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cToo fortune cookie sounding?\u201d Cyrus questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d TJ straightens his head with a nod and shares a soft chuckle.<br></p><p>\u201cI can do better.\u201d Cyrus assures,\u00a0\u201cLet me try again.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even celebrate Christmas,\u201d TJ highlights,\u00a0\u201cWhy does it matter to you if I want to hate it?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus is quiet for a moment, he\u2019s deep in thought about a past memory and was a little unsure if he should share it or not. Ultimately Cyrus decides to open up and continues,\u00a0\u201cWhen I was about six years old I went to the beach with my mom and I was playing in the shallow bit of the water but a wave coming in made me loose my balance and I nearly downed.\u201d Cyrus explains,\u00a0\u201cIt was awful, the most horrible moment in my life and I hated the beach after that, I thought it was the worst place in the entire world.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s terrible.\u201d TJ says genuinely,\u00a0\u201c..But I\u2019m not sure what that has to do with me and Christmas?\u201d His tone is careful not to suggest Cyrus\u2019 worst memory ever was anything less than that.<br></p><p>\u201cMy parents took me back to the beach one day even though I begged them not to,\u201d Cyrus continues.\u00a0\u201cBut what my parents did was show me that it wasn\u2019t the beach I hated, it was that one awful memory of it.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou think sipping eggnog by the fire is going to make me feel better about my dad leaving?\u201d TJ asks and he wasn\u2019t snippy or huffy like he was the previous afternoon, he looked more defeated.\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus tries not to react too much to the information TJ shared, nor does he try to push for more. If TJ wanted to open up about it he would. Instead Cyrus wears a soft and small smile,\u00a0\u201cNo but maybe it will make you happier for the ones who stayed.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>After a quiet moment passes between the two TJ lets out a heavy sigh,\u00a0\u201cDammit.\u201d He says softly under his breath.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cyrus questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThat made me feel better.\u201d TJ mumbles and Cyrus smiles proudly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSorry for being a jerk.\u201d TJ says sheepishly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t completely undeserving.\u201d\u00a0Cyrus shrugs,\u00a0\u201c\u2026I should probably get back to the gift stall.. Want to wrap presents with me?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs it a paid job?\u201d TJ questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for charity.\u201d Cyrus explains.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d TJ says,\u00a0\u201cSure, I\u2019ll help but I\u2019m lousy at gift wrapping.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ\u2019s statement about his wrapping skills proved to be true as Cyrus looks at TJ\u2019s poor handiwork.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should stick to rapping apologies instead of presents.\u201d Cyrus grimaces and TJ nudges him playfully with his elbow.\u00a0</p><p>Then TJ moves on to bow duty instead and even though TJ wasn\u2019t exactly able to open up to Cyrus about his home life, somehow the two still felt closer than before.</p><hr><p><b>End Notes: </b>I hope everyone is enjoying the story so far!

Most of my memories surrounding Christmas are bad and I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it would make you feel better?\u201d Cyrus insists,\u00a0\u201cMaybe I could help?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do, cry about my family issues?\u201d TJ snips.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had problems at home.\u201d Cyrus frowns.\u00a0\u201cI never go to your house.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah and there\u2019s a reason for that.\u201d TJ continues to be brash,\u00a0\u201c<i>Poor TJ has family issues.</i>\u201d He snaps,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019d make something out of nothing.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t feel like nothing.\u201d Cyrus stops walking and he forces TJ to as well.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt must be exhausting trying to fix everyone all the time.\u201d TJ shakes his head with a sigh.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTJ that\u2019s not what I\u2019m-\u201d Cyrus drops his sentence with a frown.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to walk home together anymore.\u201d TJ states with a frustrated breath.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTJ, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Cyrus says almost desperately.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cForget it.\u201d TJ shakes his head before leaving Cyrus there alone.<br></p><p>Although Cyrus wanted to, he knew there was no use chasing after TJ, instead he remains in place and watches as TJ disappears down the street.\u00a0</p><p>-</p><p>The following day after school Cyrus is at the busy mall in town donating his time to wrap presents, the proceeds from the stall go towards Christmas gifts for children from families in need. Ever since Cyrus was old enough to understand the concept of paying it forward, he had made an effort to give back. It was something Cyrus tries to do all the time but come the holiday season, he makes a conscious effort to do at least one good thing that gives back to the community. This is a ritual of sorts that he shares with his father.</p><p>Cyrus had been at the stall for an hour now and whilst he wrapped he also vented to the lady in charge about how TJ had been avoiding him all day. \u201cI just wish he\u2019d speak to me,\u201d Cyrus exhales heavily and then as if he had wished it into existence, Cyrus spots TJ coming out of a small store not too far from the booth he is at. Cyrus asks the lady for permission to take a five minute break and after listening to him go on for an hour she welcomed the idea of a quiet five minutes. </p><p>Cyrus quickly make his way over to the store and TJ looks surprised and a little uncomfortable when he notices Cyrus. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d TJ asks. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not stalking you even though it may look like I am,\u201d Cyrus laughs nervously, \u201cI\u2019m over at the gift wrapping stall.\u201d </p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d TJ still comes across as distant.</p><p>\u201cYou avoided me at school today and haven\u2019t been answering any of my texts since we had a,<i> fight?</i>\u201d Cyrus poses it like a question because he wasn\u2019t really sure what that exchange of words yesterday afternoon was.</p><p>\u201cBeing ignored kind of sucks, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d TJ scoffs. </p><p>A frown falls on Cyrus\u2019 face as he knew TJ was referring to the all too troubling gun incident. \u201cI wanted to talk to you.\u201d Cyrus is firm. \u201cI went to text you a dozen times but Andi and Buffy wouldn\u2019t let me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI was worried you were just as happy to avoid me.\u201d TJ goes a little mumbly. </p><p>\u201cYou noticed the part where they physically stopped me from going over to you, right?\u201d Cyrus lets out a single laugh. </p><p>TJ breaks his annoyed look with a hint of a smile although he squashes it quickly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNewsflash, TJ, I like you-\u201c Cyrus frets at his choice of words, \u201cYou\u2019re my friend\u2026 And I just wanted to know if something was wrong. I can be pushy and I was yesterday so I am sorry for prying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that is?\u201d TJ asks and Cyrus\u2019 pained expression deepens, he didn\u2019t know what else to be sorry for. </p><p>\u201cMaybe I do have a habit of trying to fix things and I can definitely be pushy so I genuinely apologise for that. I hope you know I\u2019d <i>never </i>want to force you to talk about something you didn\u2019t want to but I can\u2019t apologise for wanting to help. I don\u2019t see people - <i>you</i> - as broken or needing improvement, I just don\u2019t like seeing people I care about upset. So I can\u2019t say sorry for that because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad quality to have.\u201d </p><p>TJ\u2019s annoyed look is now completely foiled by a soft smile even despite his best efforts to squash it again. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad quality either.\u201d</p><p>A smiley moment passes by before Cyrus breaks sheepishly, \u201cSo, what brings you to the mall on a Tuesday afternoon?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the twins birthday tomorrow. I had to pick something up for them for my mom.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWow, their birthday is so close to the holidays, that must be an expensive time of year for your family.\u201d Cyrus says and immediately his face falls with a worried expression, \u201cThat wasn\u2019t me prying I swear.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d TJ says. \u201cIt is an expensive time of year.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to..\u201d Cyrus shakes his head as he didn\u2019t mean to seem like he wanted an explanation from TJ.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to.\u201d TJ says,\u00a0\u201cIt was the worst Christmas ever and I don\u2019t really feel like reliving that right now.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI respect that.\u201d Cyrus nods.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m really sorry for whatever it is and I am here to talk if and whenever you want.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d TJ nods slightly with a weak smile.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cEven though I\u2019m respecting your boundaries can I still say something to try and\u00a0\u2018fix\u2019 it?\u201d Cyrus uses air quotes and this makes TJ smile.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou can try.\u201d TJ shrugs.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve already had the worst Christmas ever, that means every Christmas is potentially the best one yet.\u201d Cyrus smiles,\u00a0\u201cIt would be a shame to miss out on that because you don\u2019t give the holidays a chance.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ coaxes his head with furrowed brows and looks like he\u2019s absorbing what Cyrus said.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cToo fortune cookie sounding?\u201d Cyrus questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d TJ straightens his head with a nod and shares a soft chuckle.<br></p><p>\u201cI can do better.\u201d Cyrus assures,\u00a0\u201cLet me try again.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even celebrate Christmas,\u201d TJ highlights,\u00a0\u201cWhy does it matter to you if I want to hate it?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus is quiet for a moment, he\u2019s deep in thought about a past memory and was a little unsure if he should share it or not. Ultimately Cyrus decides to open up and continues,\u00a0\u201cWhen I was about six years old I went to the beach with my mom and I was playing in the shallow bit of the water but a wave coming in made me loose my balance and I nearly downed.\u201d Cyrus explains,\u00a0\u201cIt was awful, the most horrible moment in my life and I hated the beach after that, I thought it was the worst place in the entire world.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s terrible.\u201d TJ says genuinely,\u00a0\u201c..But I\u2019m not sure what that has to do with me and Christmas?\u201d His tone is careful not to suggest Cyrus\u2019 worst memory ever was anything less than that.<br></p><p>\u201cMy parents took me back to the beach one day even though I begged them not to,\u201d Cyrus continues.\u00a0\u201cBut what my parents did was show me that it wasn\u2019t the beach I hated, it was that one awful memory of it.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou think sipping eggnog by the fire is going to make me feel better about my dad leaving?\u201d TJ asks and he wasn\u2019t snippy or huffy like he was the previous afternoon, he looked more defeated.\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus tries not to react too much to the information TJ shared, nor does he try to push for more. If TJ wanted to open up about it he would. Instead Cyrus wears a soft and small smile,\u00a0\u201cNo but maybe it will make you happier for the ones who stayed.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>After a quiet moment passes between the two TJ lets out a heavy sigh,\u00a0\u201cDammit.\u201d He says softly under his breath.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cyrus questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThat made me feel better.\u201d TJ mumbles and Cyrus smiles proudly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSorry for being a jerk.\u201d TJ says sheepishly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t completely undeserving.\u201d\u00a0Cyrus shrugs,\u00a0\u201c\u2026I should probably get back to the gift stall.. Want to wrap presents with me?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs it a paid job?\u201d TJ questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for charity.\u201d Cyrus explains.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d TJ says,\u00a0\u201cSure, I\u2019ll help but I\u2019m lousy at gift wrapping.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ\u2019s statement about his wrapping skills proved to be true as Cyrus looks at TJ\u2019s poor handiwork.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should stick to rapping apologies instead of presents.\u201d Cyrus grimaces and TJ nudges him playfully with his elbow.\u00a0</p><p>Then TJ moves on to bow duty instead and even though TJ wasn\u2019t exactly able to open up to Cyrus about his home life, somehow the two still felt closer than before.</p><hr><p><b>End Notes: </b>I hope everyone is enjoying the story so far!

I just don&rsquo;t really like Christmas.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like Christmas? Everybody likes Christmas!&rdquo; Andi exclaims. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, not everybody.&rdquo; Cyrus tosses his head from side to side. </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t count.&rdquo; Andi says with a scrunched expression. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just hurtful.&rdquo; Cyrus mumbles with folded arms.</p><p>&ldquo;How can you not like Christmas?&rdquo; Buffy asks just as dumbfounded as Andi. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; TJ shrugs, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an over commercialised holiday.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Christmas is about spending time with your family. Buffy states matter of factly and TJ continues to be dismissive and avoid any solid eye contact. &ldquo;Even my mom has never missed a Christmas with me and my dad.&rdquo; Buffy adds.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The commercial side of it is kind of fun too.&rdquo; Jonah admits with a dimple exposing smirk. </p><p>&ldquo;So much fun.&rdquo; Andi seconds that with a nod. &ldquo;I even decorated my phone case,&rdquo; she shows off her handiwork.</p><p>TJ just shrugs his shoulders again in response and Cyrus sends his friends a silent look telling them to lay off. </p><p>&ldquo;If you change your mind, you&rsquo;re still welcome to come.&rdquo; Andi says.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; TJ mumbles.</p><p>-</p><p>After final bell for the day, Cyrus quickly gathers his things and makes his way towards TJ&rsquo;s locker in hope that he&rsquo;ll catch the basketball captain before he leaves for the day. Cyrus is in luck and reaches TJ just as he&rsquo;s leaving to exit. </p><p>&ldquo;Wanna walk home together?&rdquo; Cyrus asks now by TJ&rsquo;s side. </p><p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; TJ favours the idea with a smile. </p><p>The two exit Jefferson Middle School together and both let out quiet gasps when they&rsquo;re hit with a gust of cold wind. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s already freezing and it hasn&rsquo;t even started snowing yet.&rdquo; TJ&rsquo;s teeth almost chatter and he buries his hands in the pockets of his windbreaker. </p><p>&ldquo;You know they say the longer it takes for first snowfall the worse the snow will be?&rdquo; Cyrus also hides his hands in his coat pockets. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard that before.&rdquo; TJ says with a laugh. </p><p>Cyrus laughs too, &ldquo;Good thing the ski lodge is in the mountain so it&rsquo;s already snowing there. Did you talk to your parents about it last night?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo; TJ shakes his head with his gaze pointed at the ground as he walks, &ldquo;It was late last night&hellip; I&rsquo;ll ask tonight though.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Cool.&rdquo; Cyrus nods and he&nbsp;tries to build the courage to bring up what he really wanted to talk about. &ldquo;Can I ask you something?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; TJ agrees unsuspectingly. </p><p>&ldquo;Why is it you don&rsquo;t like Christmas?&rdquo; Cyrus finally questions. </p><p>&ldquo;Like I said at lunch-&ldquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I heard what you said at lunch and at dinner with my family,&rdquo; Cyrus looks to TJ as they walk before having to look forward again, &ldquo;But I want to know the real reason.&rdquo; </p><p>TJ rolls his eyes, &ldquo;You know you can be so ann-&ldquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Annoying, judgey, yeah I know.&rdquo; Cyrus says, &ldquo;You also said I was the only person you could talk to like this.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You open up to someone once or twice and then they get all pushy about it.&rdquo; TJ says with a huff. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t like Christmas okay? Most of my memories surrounding Christmas are bad and I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe it would make you feel better?&rdquo; Cyrus insists,&nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe I could help?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What do you want me to do, cry about my family issues?&rdquo; TJ snips.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you had problems at home.&rdquo; Cyrus frowns.&nbsp;&ldquo;I never go to your house.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah and there&rsquo;s a reason for that.&rdquo; TJ continues to be brash,&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>Poor TJ has family issues.</i>&rdquo; He snaps,&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;d make something out of nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;This doesn&rsquo;t feel like nothing.&rdquo; Cyrus stops walking and he forces TJ to as well.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It must be exhausting trying to fix everyone all the time.&rdquo; TJ shakes his head with a sigh.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;TJ that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m-&rdquo; Cyrus drops his sentence with a frown.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to walk home together anymore.&rdquo; TJ states with a frustrated breath.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;TJ, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; Cyrus says almost desperately.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Forget it.&rdquo; TJ shakes his head before leaving Cyrus there alone.<br /></p><p>Although Cyrus wanted to, he knew there was no use chasing after TJ, instead he remains in place and watches as TJ disappears down the street.&nbsp;</p><p>-</p><p>The following day after school Cyrus is at the busy mall in town donating his time to wrap presents, the proceeds from the stall go towards Christmas gifts for children from families in need. Ever since Cyrus was old enough to understand the concept of paying it forward, he had made an effort to give back. It was something Cyrus tries to do all the time but come the holiday season, he makes a conscious effort to do at least one good thing that gives back to the community. This is a ritual of sorts that he shares with his father.</p><p>Cyrus had been at the stall for an hour now and whilst he wrapped he also vented to the lady in charge about how TJ had been avoiding him all day. &ldquo;I just wish he&rsquo;d speak to me,&rdquo; Cyrus exhales heavily and then as if he had wished it into existence, Cyrus spots TJ coming out of a small store not too far from the booth he is at. Cyrus asks the lady for permission to take a five minute break and after listening to him go on for an hour she welcomed the idea of a quiet five minutes. </p><p>Cyrus quickly make his way over to the store and TJ looks surprised and a little uncomfortable when he notices Cyrus. &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; TJ asks. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not stalking you even though it may look like I am,&rdquo; Cyrus laughs nervously, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m over at the gift wrapping stall.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo; TJ still comes across as distant.</p><p>&ldquo;You avoided me at school today and haven&rsquo;t been answering any of my texts since we had a,<i> fight?</i>&rdquo; Cyrus poses it like a question because he wasn&rsquo;t really sure what that exchange of words yesterday afternoon was.</p><p>&ldquo;Being ignored kind of sucks, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; TJ scoffs. </p><p>A frown falls on Cyrus&rsquo; face as he knew TJ was referring to the all too troubling gun incident. &ldquo;I wanted to talk to you.&rdquo; Cyrus is firm. &ldquo;I went to text you a dozen times but Andi and Buffy wouldn&rsquo;t let me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I was worried you were just as happy to avoid me.&rdquo; TJ goes a little mumbly. </p><p>&ldquo;You noticed the part where they physically stopped me from going over to you, right?&rdquo; Cyrus lets out a single laugh. </p><p>TJ breaks his annoyed look with a hint of a smile although he squashes it quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Newsflash, TJ, I like you-&ldquo; Cyrus frets at his choice of words, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my friend&hellip; And I just wanted to know if something was wrong. I can be pushy and I was yesterday so I am sorry for prying.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that is?&rdquo; TJ asks and Cyrus&rsquo; pained expression deepens, he didn&rsquo;t know what else to be sorry for. </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe I do have a habit of trying to fix things and I can definitely be pushy so I genuinely apologise for that. I hope you know I&rsquo;d <i>never </i>want to force you to talk about something you didn&rsquo;t want to but I can&rsquo;t apologise for wanting to help. I don&rsquo;t see people - <i>you</i> - as broken or needing improvement, I just don&rsquo;t like seeing people I care about upset. So I can&rsquo;t say sorry for that because I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a bad quality to have.&rdquo; </p><p>TJ&rsquo;s annoyed look is now completely foiled by a soft smile even despite his best efforts to squash it again. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a bad quality either.&rdquo;</p><p>A smiley moment passes by before Cyrus breaks sheepishly, &ldquo;So, what brings you to the mall on a Tuesday afternoon?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the twins birthday tomorrow. I had to pick something up for them for my mom.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Wow, their birthday is so close to the holidays, that must be an expensive time of year for your family.&rdquo; Cyrus says and immediately his face falls with a worried expression, &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t me prying I swear.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; TJ says. &ldquo;It is an expensive time of year.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to..&rdquo; Cyrus shakes his head as he didn&rsquo;t mean to seem like he wanted an explanation from TJ.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to.&rdquo; TJ says,&nbsp;&ldquo;It was the worst Christmas ever and I don&rsquo;t really feel like reliving that right now.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I respect that.&rdquo; Cyrus nods.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry for whatever it is and I am here to talk if and whenever you want.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; TJ nods slightly with a weak smile.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Even though I&rsquo;m respecting your boundaries can I still say something to try and&nbsp;&lsquo;fix&rsquo; it?&rdquo; Cyrus uses air quotes and this makes TJ smile.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You can try.&rdquo; TJ shrugs.</p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve already had the worst Christmas ever, that means every Christmas is potentially the best one yet.&rdquo; Cyrus smiles,&nbsp;&ldquo;It would be a shame to miss out on that because you don&rsquo;t give the holidays a chance.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>TJ coaxes his head with furrowed brows and looks like he&rsquo;s absorbing what Cyrus said.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Too fortune cookie sounding?&rdquo; Cyrus questions.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;A little.&rdquo; TJ straightens his head with a nod and shares a soft chuckle.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I can do better.&rdquo; Cyrus assures,&nbsp;&ldquo;Let me try again.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even celebrate Christmas,&rdquo; TJ highlights,&nbsp;&ldquo;Why does it matter to you if I want to hate it?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Cyrus is quiet for a moment, he&rsquo;s deep in thought about a past memory and was a little unsure if he should share it or not. Ultimately Cyrus decides to open up and continues,&nbsp;&ldquo;When I was about six years old I went to the beach with my mom and I was playing in the shallow bit of the water but a wave coming in made me loose my balance and I nearly downed.&rdquo; Cyrus explains,&nbsp;&ldquo;It was awful, the most horrible moment in my life and I hated the beach after that, I thought it was the worst place in the entire world.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s terrible.&rdquo; TJ says genuinely,&nbsp;&ldquo;..But I&rsquo;m not sure what that has to do with me and Christmas?&rdquo; His tone is careful not to suggest Cyrus&rsquo; worst memory ever was anything less than that.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;My parents took me back to the beach one day even though I begged them not to,&rdquo; Cyrus continues.&nbsp;&ldquo;But what my parents did was show me that it wasn&rsquo;t the beach I hated, it was that one awful memory of it.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You think sipping eggnog by the fire is going to make me feel better about my dad leaving?&rdquo; TJ asks and he wasn&rsquo;t snippy or huffy like he was the previous afternoon, he looked more defeated.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Cyrus tries not to react too much to the information TJ shared, nor does he try to push for more. If TJ wanted to open up about it he would. Instead Cyrus wears a soft and small smile,&nbsp;&ldquo;No but maybe it will make you happier for the ones who stayed.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>After a quiet moment passes between the two TJ lets out a heavy sigh,&nbsp;&ldquo;Dammit.&rdquo; He says softly under his breath.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Cyrus questions.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That made me feel better.&rdquo; TJ mumbles and Cyrus smiles proudly.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sorry for being a jerk.&rdquo; TJ says sheepishly.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t completely undeserving.&rdquo;&nbsp;Cyrus shrugs,&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;I should probably get back to the gift stall.. Want to wrap presents with me?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it a paid job?&rdquo; TJ questions.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for charity.&rdquo; Cyrus explains.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; TJ says,&nbsp;&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ll help but I&rsquo;m lousy at gift wrapping.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>TJ&rsquo;s statement about his wrapping skills proved to be true as Cyrus looks at TJ&rsquo;s poor handiwork.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe you should stick to rapping apologies instead of presents.&rdquo; Cyrus grimaces and TJ nudges him playfully with his elbow.&nbsp;</p><p>Then TJ moves on to bow duty instead and even though TJ wasn&rsquo;t exactly able to open up to Cyrus about his home life, somehow the two still felt closer than before.</p><hr /><p><b>End Notes: </b>I hope everyone is enjoying the story so far!
