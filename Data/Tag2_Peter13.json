Your school presentation was not what you hoped it would be, you embarrassed yourself in front of all your friends, training was a disaster, and to make it all worse, you just heard that your crush was falling for someone who was clearly not you. It felt like the day was just a slap in the face. You were overwhelmed with how terrible the day has been.</p><p>You let out a shaky breath as you continued to hit the punching bag. You knew this was the best way to release all your stress and anxiety so you have been doing this for the past few hours. The more you punched, the angrier you got. Tears started to fall, you didn&rsquo;t know why but it was kind of helping. You didn&rsquo;t notice how intense your punching had gotten before you were interrupted.</p><p>&ldquo;<b>[Y/N]</b>?&rdquo; A voice spoke out.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t need to see his face in order to know it was your best friend. You quickly wiped your tears before Peter could see.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Peter?&rdquo; You whispered then continued to punch the bag. You did <i>not </i>want him to see you crying. If he saw you crying he&rsquo;d insist on you telling him and that won&rsquo;t end well for you.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; He questioned with concern as he stood next to you with sweat covering his shirtless body. You avoided eye contact, not wanting it to be harder on yourself.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; You answered as you punched the bag. You noticed that you started to punch harder and pictured <i>her</i> as the bag.</p><p>&ldquo;<b>[Y/N]</b>,&rdquo; Peter urged. He saw your facial expression, your puffy eyes and how exhausted you looked. &ldquo;We both know there&rsquo;s something wrong. Please, tell me. We tell each other everything.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Not this time.</i> You thought in your head. You didn&rsquo;t want to admit that you had feelings for him. Every time you saw his face you saw <i>her</i>.<i> </i>You hated it.</p><p>You were both interrupted by someone clearing their throat. You and Peter turned to see Wanda with her arms crossed in front of her chest. You dropped your hands, the two of you giving her full attention. She gave the two of you a quirked eyebrow, &ldquo;I need to speak with <b>[Y/N]</b>.&rdquo;</p><p>You looked at Peter before grabbing your things. As you were about to leave you felt Peter grab your hand. &ldquo;You know I care. I&rsquo;ll always be there for you,&rdquo; Peter whispered to you. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be in my room if you want to talk.&rdquo; You stared at him, not knowing what to say. He sighed then let go of your hand and walked away.</p><p>You felt chills run down your spine as you then walked to Wanda&rsquo;s room. Before you could sit down you heard the door shut. You jumped in surprise then relaxed on her bed.</p><p>&ldquo;So, did Steve talk to you about training me?&rdquo; You asked as you started to play with a stress ball she had sitting to the side of her desk. Your eyes wandered around her room, taking in all her decorations and pictures she had hung up.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Wanda started. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I wanted to talk about.&rdquo; She sat on the corner of her bed directly in front of you. Your knees were basically touching.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; You questioned, your eyes now focused on her. &ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I need to ask you a question and I need you to be completely honest with me. No questions, just answer.&rdquo; Wanda spoke sternly.</p><p>&ldquo;Uhh&hellip; alright?&rdquo; You whispered as your heart started to race. Every single bad thing you have ever done started popping up in your head. You stealing Vision&rsquo;s food for the past 2 weeks, you pranking Tony every other day, you hacking into Steve&rsquo;s computer and creating dating profiles, you talking to Thor about-</p><p>&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you told Peter about your feelings towards him?&rdquo; Wanda finally asked.</p><p>This threw you off completely. You would like to say you were shocked, but at the same time you should&rsquo;ve known, she has the ability to read minds. You mentally slapped yourself.</p><p>&ldquo;Look, it&rsquo;s not as easy as it seems&hellip;&rdquo; You blushed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what traditions you had in Sokovia but here in America, girls don&rsquo;t really say they like someone unless they&rsquo;re willing to take the risk of being humiliated. Today has not been my day either so, I&rsquo;d rather not.&rdquo;</p><p>Wanda smirked, &ldquo;<b>[Y/N]</b>, I think you should tell him. Trust me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no way.&rdquo; You shook your head as you stood up.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to regret it,<b> [Y/N]</b>.&rdquo; Wanda continued. &ldquo;At least think about it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the thing! I don&rsquo;t want to! Just thinking about it makes me want to throw up.&rdquo; You started speaking. You then thought about it, the embarrassment it would bring. &ldquo;I actually think I&rsquo;m going to throw up&hellip;&rdquo; You gripped your stomach and hunched over her desk.</p><p>Wanda laughed lightly at your hysteria, &ldquo;<b>[Y/N]</b> you are young and have so much to look forward to. Take this risk!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the thing, Wanda knew it wasn&rsquo;t a risk. She can read Peter&rsquo;s mind and see how much he loves you.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; You stuttered as you violently clawed at the stress ball.</p><p>Wanda tried not to laugh, biting her lip before continuing, &ldquo;What if you write how you feel about him on a piece of paper like if you&rsquo;re talking to him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So, a love letter?&rdquo; You questioned as you stopped squishing the ball to death.</p><p>Wanda shrugged, &ldquo;If you want to call it that.&rdquo;</p><p>You gave her a look, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Wanda adjusted herself to face you properly, &ldquo;Just say everything, pour everything out.&rdquo;</p><p>You thought for a moment. Maybe you should, what could go wrong? You&rsquo;re just letting your feelings out so you don&rsquo;t burst out all your emotions at anyone&rsquo;s face.</p><p>You slowly nodded, &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s not a bad idea&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Before the conversation could continue, FRIDAY spoke into the room. &ldquo;I apologize for interrupting your conversation with Miss <b>[L/N]</b>. Miss Maximoff, Rogers is urging an emergency mission. You will report to the hanger immediately. Miss <b>[L/N] </b>and Mr. Parker will remain at the base until further notice.&rdquo;</p><p>Wanda looked over at you as you stood up, &ldquo;Look, I want you to know that it&rsquo;s fine to have feelings for someone. Please don&rsquo;t be ashamed of your feelings. Love is a beautiful thing, embrace it!&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled weakly at her and nodded. Before you left the room, you looked back at her, &ldquo;Good luck on the mission, I know you&rsquo;ll do amazing!&rdquo; You encouraged. Wanda smiled and left the area while you walked to your room.</p><p>You looked around the room before deciding to start on the letter. It&rsquo;s the least you can do for Wanda. You didn&rsquo;t know why she was urging you to express your feelings so badly, but you assumed she just wanted to have some sort of entertainment out of this. You shook your head before you started writing.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Dear Pete,&rdquo;</i> You wrote down. You shook your head and erased the two words. <g class=\"gr_ gr_549 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"549\" data-gr-id=\"549\">Too</g> clich\u00e9. <i>&ldquo;Hey! Peter&hellip;.&rdquo;</i> No. &ldquo;<i>Heeey!&rdquo;</i> Ew, no. <i>&ldquo;Penis Parker!&rdquo;</i> Ugh, he&rsquo;d hate it. The eraser was your new best friend. The shards of that pink rubber were scattered all over your desk.<i> &ldquo;Yo, Peter&hellip;&rdquo;</i> NO! You sighed in frustration and laid your head down.</p><p><i>Focus, </i><b><i>[Y/N]</i></b><i>!</i> You thought. <i>Gather your thoughts together and relax.</i></p><p>You exhaled deeply as you thought about the times you spent with Peter. From the day you met, til now. You felt your heart flutter and your face flush. Wow, you really were falling for him. You were falling hard. Gosh, you hoped this would help. You opened your eyes and got a new paper. You felt your hands moving, letting your heart do the talking. It was as if it was perfect timing when FRIDAY began to speak after you closed off the letter.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark is requesting you and Mr. Parker to immediately leave the base and assist the team for back up,&rdquo; FRIDAY spoke. You nodded to yourself and quickly started to change into your suit. Before you left, you saw the letter was still on your desk. You snatched it and shoved it into your suit before leaving.</p><p>The mission was rough. The team anticipated the HYDRA base would be smaller and contain only a few agents. Little did they know that the remainder of their base was underground. In other words, it was their second biggest base.</p><p>&ldquo;Fall back!&rdquo; Steve called into the comms. It was getting too chaotic. Even with you and Peter as backups, it wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p><p>You were all heading back when you heard Steve shout in pain. Everyone didn&rsquo;t notice and tried to adjust themselves in the jet. You looked out to see Steve hiding behind a bin. He was wounded, bleeding from being shot at.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back <g class=\"gr_ gr_535 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"535\" data-gr-id=\"535\">for</g> Steve!&rdquo; You called out to the team.</p><p>&ldquo;<b>[Y/N]</b> no!&rdquo; Tony rejected.</p><p>&ldquo;<b>[Y/N]</b> STOP!&rdquo; Peter called out.</p><p>You sprinted out the Quinjet without a second thought. You went back to where Steve was last seen. Unfortunately, he wasn&rsquo;t there. You quickly scanned the area and found him hiding behind a tree. You sprinted as you dodged the bullets flying at you. You threw yourself to the ground and saw Steve staring at you with wide eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;You should&rsquo;ve stayed on the ship,&rdquo; Steve grunted.</p><p>You gave out a laugh, &ldquo;And let our captain get captured by HYDRA? I don&rsquo;t think that will be a fun reunion.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve laughed before allowing you to help him up. He let some of his weight onto you but knew your body wouldn&rsquo;t be able to handle all of his weight so he attempted to keep most of his weight to himself.</p><p>You struggled as you tried to balance his weight onto you as bullets were raining down on the two of you. Thankfully, Steve&rsquo;s shield took the hits. You both struggled while getting closer to the ship. The team urged the two of you to pick up the pace as the ship began to get ready to leave.</p><p>Just as you were about to step foot on the platform, you felt a sharp pain shooting up your spin. You gasped in shock and felt your body go weak. You fell to the floor, along with Steve who was leaning against you.</p><p>&ldquo;<b>[Y/N]</b>!&rdquo; Peter cried out as the team was quick to bring the two of you into the ship and take off.</p><p>You struggled to breathe as you felt the unbearable pain all around your body. Peter pulled you deeper into the ship as everyone was scattered around.</p><p>&ldquo;No no no!&rdquo; Peter cried as the team tried to help you and Steve. Tony was by your side and pressed down on your wound to prevent it from bleeding out. You screeched in pain as you now began choking on the blood coming out of your mouth.</p><p>Peter began sobbing as Bruce tried his best to treat your bullet wound. Steve was fine by the time Bruce began to do an emergency surgery with the tools on the ship. Natasha was pulling her hair in anxiety as Clint set the jet to autopilot. Tony pulled Peter into his chest as Peter still held a tight grip on your hand.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be fine!&rdquo; Bruce assured as he shakily tried pulling out the bullet from your body. &ldquo;Focus on Peter!&rdquo;</p><p>You cried as you felt the sharp pain shooting up your spine once again. More blood began to leave your wound making the team freak out. Peter was now cupping both of your cheeks, his face near yours, &ldquo;<b>[Y/N] </b>look at me! Yes! You&rsquo;re doing great, just look at me okay? We&rsquo;re going to be okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I need bandages and towels!&rdquo; You heard Bruce shout. Everyone scrambled to their feet and tried to collect anything that could help. You knew the wound had damaged something inside of you. You were all hours away from the base, you weren&rsquo;t going to make it. You accepted your fate.</p><p>You stared into Peter&rsquo;s eyes. The same beautiful eyes you met all those months ago. The same eyes you fell in love with. The same eyes you dreamed about every night. You almost forgot how magical they were. It was as if you were being hypnotized.</p><p>You panted as you looked up at Peter. Your eyes never breaking eye contact. Your hands shook as you reached for the letter in your suit. A bloodstained paper was firm in your hands as you gave it to Peter. He held onto your hand and paper. Tears fell down his face as he shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;I I-I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; You whispered.</p><p>With that, you took your last breath. Your eyes drifted off as the team stared in horror.</p><p>&ldquo;No no no!&rdquo; Peter shouted. &ldquo;<b>[Y/N]</b> open your eyes! Love, open your eyes!&rdquo;</p><p>He pulled your bloody, wounded body onto his lap as he shook you. With every shake, he hoped you would miraculously wake up. Peter shouted in agony when he realized you weren&rsquo;t going to wake up. He lost one of the only people he truly cared for. He would never get you back. He shouted in pain as the team looked away in shame as their tears fell down their faces. Peter sobbed into your lifeless body as the team silently reflected on what just happened for the rest of the trip back to the base.</p><p>Hours went by and the team was back at the base. Workers from the infirmary tried grabbing your body from Peter&rsquo;s grip.</p><p>&ldquo;N-No!&rdquo; Peter cried as he tried to pull you closer to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, please&hellip;&rdquo; Tony whispered as he slowly released Peter&rsquo;s grip from you. The workers grabbed your body from him and placed you on the table that would wheel you out.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <g class=\"gr_ gr_533 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"533\" data-gr-id=\"533\">sorry</g> kid,&rdquo; Tony whispered as he had tears fall down. Peter stared at your pale, lifeless body. He didn&rsquo;t know what to do. It was as if there were no tears left to cry. Your body was taken to the morgue as the team stared in silence. A few moments passed when Peter silently left the area. The team stared at him in sorrow. They knew he was broken.</p><p>Peter clung onto the paper in his hand and stared down at it as he maneuvered his way to his room on the residential level. He was terrified to open it. There were endless possibilities of what that paper held. His mind rambled on as he stood at the door to his room.</p><p>&ldquo;Password?&rdquo; FRIDAY spoke out.</p><p>Peter froze. He felt his body tense up as his mind went blank. Peter&rsquo;s lips trembled as his breath shook, he was silent for a while. He couldn&rsquo;t say it.</p><p>&ldquo;Password?&rdquo; FRIDAY repeated.</p><p>Peter choked out a sob,&ldquo;<b>[Y- [Y/N]</b>.&rdquo; He leaned his forehead against the door as he cried.</p><p>&ldquo;Password accepted,&rdquo; FRIDAY responded. A click flickered and the door was open.</p><p>Peter closed the door behind him and finally threw himself on his bed. He allowed himself to fully release all the emotions his body was going through. Anger. Fear. Anxiety. Sorrow. Grief. Love. It felt like hours before he decided to calm down. He silently leaned against the frame of his head and stared out the window.</p><p>Wanda quietly walked into his room. She took in the scene and felt her mind going crazy with the emotions and thoughts running through Peter&rsquo;s head. Peter was staring out the window silently, eyes puffy and his chest shaking lightly from the lack of oxygen he received from sobbing a moment ago. No one knew what to say to Peter so they sent Wanda to check up on him. Since she can read minds, it would help her take the right steps on what to say.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey&hellip;&rdquo; Wanda whispered.</p><p>Peter looked up at her, his eyes drooping with pain. He turned around again and stared out the window, the letter in his tight grip. He still hasn&rsquo;t opened the letter, he wanted to hold onto a piece of you for as long as he could.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you read it yet?&rdquo; Wanda finally spoke.</p><p>Peter lightly shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;I think you should read it.&rdquo; She urged.</p><p>Peter felt tears falling, &ldquo;This is the last thing she gave me. The last piece of her. She died while giving it to me. I don&rsquo;t think I can handle reading it, not yet.&rdquo;</p><p>Wanda sighed, &ldquo;She had a purpose for it, Peter. Trust me.&rdquo;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t respond, instead, he continued to stare out the window. Wanda exhaled deeply and sat on the bed with Peter. She was going to stay with Peter the whole day to make sure he was safe. She also wanted to make sure he would be fine after reading what was in that letter.</p><p>After a few hours, he finally had the courage of opening the letter. He looked at the letter in hesitation. Wanda peered up at him and waited. He sighed before opening the envelope and seeing the folded paper.</p><p>He teared up seeing your beautiful handwriting covering the entire page. Your perfume illuminated from the paper. It was as if you were still there. Peter felt his hands shake as he fixed his eyes onto the letter. He took a deep breath before starting to read.</p><p><i>Peter,</i></p><p><i>The first time we spoke was when you asked me where the training room was. I remember laughing because you looked lost. It was adorable. You were so confused by all the levels and would silently freak out when we would pass by any of the team members. I smiled as I gave you a tour of the base, showing you all the short cuts and the best hideouts whenever we needed time alone. It was honestly the best day of my life. You were so shy but I knew that we were going to be best friends. I felt the connection from that day.</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 The second time we spoke was when Tony assigned us to train together later that week. I remember walking into the training room to see you starstruck at Natasha. You wouldn&rsquo;t stop stuttering! It was the funniest thing to happen, especially when she tackled you on the mat. Unfortunately, you got hurt and I had to take you to the infirmary. The whole way there, I couldn&rsquo;t stop staring at you. The way your eyes wandered around the base and observed all the things we passed by. You looked beautiful, I knew that I was falling for you. Even as you were getting your arm brace, the small smile you gave me made my heart flip. Who was I to let Peter Parker steal my heart? I don&rsquo;t regret it one bit.</i></p><p><i>When we went for our mission, we were already hanging out for a while. We were both terrified. Your hands were shaking. It was our first mission with The Avengers. I stared at your hands, the way you gripped onto your suit, your knuckles were as white as a snowflake. I wanted to hold them. I wanted to tell you that everything was going to be fine. I chose not to. Instead, I called you a snowflake to help you ease your nerves. You smiled at the nickname. That damn smile. That smile healed my nerves as if we were on any other mission.</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 After that day, we started talking more than before. That mission helped us connect better. The team was happy we were getting along so well, little did they know was how hard I was falling for you. We had more missions together. We were technically forced to talk to each other by the team but it didn&rsquo;t feel that way. It felt like home. As weird as it sounded, I knew you were meant to be in my life. It was no coincidence.</i></p><p><i>Since that time, I started caring for you more than I did for myself. It was different. Even now, as I&rsquo;m writing this my heart is flipping out of its chest. Do you see how in love I am with you? I felt like we were meant to be something more than just friends. That&rsquo;s the sad part, I knew there would be nothing else. I know you only want to be friends. This letter is only to help me release my feelings, to help me release the tension. Even today at the training room, I know you saw me crying. I was crying for you, Peter. Don&rsquo;t feel bad, now. I was crying because I know you have feelings for her. Yes, her. Don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;ll always be there for you, no matter what. Peter Parker understand that I will never leave your side.</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 If you&rsquo;re reading this, that means I suddenly had the courage to show how I truly felt. That, or something bad happened. I don&rsquo;t know what it is but I&rsquo;m sure it was for the best. I hope this letter finds you well.</i></p><p><i>P.S. I love you Peter Parker</i></p><p><i>- <b>[Y/N]</b></i></p><p>A cry escaped Peter&rsquo;s lips. He pulled the letter to his chest as he sobbed into his room. Wanda gave him a pained smile as she pulled him into her chest, stroking his hair. She waited as she felt Peter&rsquo;s mind racing. He continued crying and sobbing as he thought about all the moments you two had. How it was all being ripped away from him.</p><p>&ldquo;She loved you, Peter,&rdquo; Wanda finally spoke. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame yourself for a decision she made.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shook his head and felt tears falling down his cheeks, &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t she tell me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She was scared of your rejection.&rdquo; Wanda sighed.</p><p>He cried, he never felt so guilty in his entire life. He looked up at Wanda, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the thing. I loved her. I was head over heels for her. From the day we met, I couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about her. I-I was just too scared to admit it&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Wanda sighed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I wanted her to write you this letter. I was planning on giving it to you at the end of the day. I was hoping you two would realize your feelings for one another.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter covered his face and began to sob uncontrollably. Wanda sighed in sorrow, she knew exactly what Peter was feeling. Peter continued to cry at the thought of you. He knew he can&rsquo;t have you. He will never have you. Everything he loves always dies, he just never thought it would be you too. He fell hard for you and you never even knew.</p>",

Your school presentation was not what you hoped it would be, you embarrassed yourself in front of all your friends, training was a disaster, and to make it all worse, you just heard that your crush was falling for someone who was clearly not you. It felt like the day was just a slap in the face. You were overwhelmed with how terrible the day has been.</p><p>You let out a shaky breath as you continued to hit the punching bag. You knew this was the best way to release all your stress and anxiety so you have been doing this for the past few hours. The more you punched, the angrier you got. Tears started to fall, you didn\u2019t know why but it was kind of helping. You didn\u2019t notice how intense your punching had gotten before you were interrupted.</p><p>\u201c<b>[Y/N]</b>?\u201d A voice spoke out.</p><p>You didn\u2019t need to see his face in order to know it was your best friend. You quickly wiped your tears before Peter could see.</p><p>\u201cYes, Peter?\u201d You whispered then continued to punch the bag. You did <i>not </i>want him to see you crying. If he saw you crying he\u2019d insist on you telling him and that won\u2019t end well for you.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He questioned with concern as he stood next to you with sweat covering his shirtless body. You avoided eye contact, not wanting it to be harder on yourself.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d You answered as you punched the bag. You noticed that you started to punch harder and pictured <i>her</i> as the bag.</p><p>\u201c<b>[Y/N]</b>,\u201d Peter urged. He saw your facial expression, your puffy eyes and how exhausted you looked. \u201cWe both know there\u2019s something wrong. Please, tell me. We tell each other everything.\u201d</p><p><i>Not this time.</i> You thought in your head. You didn\u2019t want to admit that you had feelings for him. Every time you saw his face you saw <i>her</i>.<i> </i>You hated it.</p><p>You were both interrupted by someone clearing their throat. You and Peter turned to see Wanda with her arms crossed in front of her chest. You dropped your hands, the two of you giving her full attention. She gave the two of you a quirked eyebrow, \u201cI need to speak with <b>[Y/N]</b>.\u201d</p><p>You looked at Peter before grabbing your things. As you were about to leave you felt Peter grab your hand. \u201cYou know I care. I\u2019ll always be there for you,\u201d Peter whispered to you. \u201cI\u2019ll be in my room if you want to talk.\u201d You stared at him, not knowing what to say. He sighed then let go of your hand and walked away.</p><p>You felt chills run down your spine as you then walked to Wanda\u2019s room. Before you could sit down you heard the door shut. You jumped in surprise then relaxed on her bed.</p><p>\u201cSo, did Steve talk to you about training me?\u201d You asked as you started to play with a stress ball she had sitting to the side of her desk. Your eyes wandered around her room, taking in all her decorations and pictures she had hung up.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Wanda started. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I wanted to talk about.\u201d She sat on the corner of her bed directly in front of you. Your knees were basically touching.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d You questioned, your eyes now focused on her. \u201cSo, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to ask you a question and I need you to be completely honest with me. No questions, just answer.\u201d Wanda spoke sternly.</p><p>\u201cUhh\u2026 alright?\u201d You whispered as your heart started to race. Every single bad thing you have ever done started popping up in your head. You stealing Vision\u2019s food for the past 2 weeks, you pranking Tony every other day, you hacking into Steve\u2019s computer and creating dating profiles, you talking to Thor about-</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you told Peter about your feelings towards him?\u201d Wanda finally asked.</p><p>This threw you off completely. You would like to say you were shocked, but at the same time you should\u2019ve known, she has the ability to read minds. You mentally slapped yourself.</p><p>\u201cLook, it\u2019s not as easy as it seems\u2026\u201d You blushed. \u201cI don\u2019t know what traditions you had in Sokovia but here in America, girls don\u2019t really say they like someone unless they\u2019re willing to take the risk of being humiliated. Today has not been my day either so, I\u2019d rather not.\u201d</p><p>Wanda smirked, \u201c<b>[Y/N]</b>, I think you should tell him. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no way.\u201d You shook your head as you stood up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to regret it,<b> [Y/N]</b>.\u201d Wanda continued. \u201cAt least think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing! I don\u2019t want to! Just thinking about it makes me want to throw up.\u201d You started speaking. You then thought about it, the embarrassment it would bring. \u201cI actually think I\u2019m going to throw up\u2026\u201d You gripped your stomach and hunched over her desk.</p><p>Wanda laughed lightly at your hysteria, \u201c<b>[Y/N]</b> you are young and have so much to look forward to. Take this risk!\u201d That\u2019s the thing, Wanda knew it wasn\u2019t a risk. She can read Peter\u2019s mind and see how much he loves you.</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t,\u201d You stuttered as you violently clawed at the stress ball.</p><p>Wanda tried not to laugh, biting her lip before continuing, \u201cWhat if you write how you feel about him on a piece of paper like if you\u2019re talking to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, a love letter?\u201d You questioned as you stopped squishing the ball to death.</p><p>Wanda shrugged, \u201cIf you want to call it that.\u201d</p><p>You gave her a look, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d</p><p>Wanda adjusted herself to face you properly, \u201cJust say everything, pour everything out.\u201d</p><p>You thought for a moment. Maybe you should, what could go wrong? You\u2019re just letting your feelings out so you don\u2019t burst out all your emotions at anyone\u2019s face.</p><p>You slowly nodded, \u201cI guess it\u2019s not a bad idea\u2026\u201d</p><p>Before the conversation could continue, FRIDAY spoke into the room. \u201cI apologize for interrupting your conversation with Miss <b>[L/N]</b>. Miss Maximoff, Rogers is urging an emergency mission. You will report to the hanger immediately. Miss <b>[L/N] </b>and Mr. Parker will remain at the base until further notice.\u201d</p><p>Wanda looked over at you as you stood up, \u201cLook, I want you to know that it\u2019s fine to have feelings for someone. Please don\u2019t be ashamed of your feelings. Love is a beautiful thing, embrace it!\u201d</p><p>You smiled weakly at her and nodded. Before you left the room, you looked back at her, \u201cGood luck on the mission, I know you\u2019ll do amazing!\u201d You encouraged. Wanda smiled and left the area while you walked to your room.</p><p>You looked around the room before deciding to start on the letter. It\u2019s the least you can do for Wanda. You didn\u2019t know why she was urging you to express your feelings so badly, but you assumed she just wanted to have some sort of entertainment out of this. You shook your head before you started writing.</p><p><i>\u201cDear Pete,\u201d</i> You wrote down. You shook your head and erased the two words. <g class=\"gr_ gr_549 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"549\" data-gr-id=\"549\">Too</g> clich\u00e9. <i>\u201cHey! Peter\u2026.\u201d</i> No. \u201c<i>Heeey!\u201d</i> Ew, no. <i>\u201cPenis Parker!\u201d</i> Ugh, he\u2019d hate it. The eraser was your new best friend. The shards of that pink rubber were scattered all over your desk.<i> \u201cYo, Peter\u2026\u201d</i> NO! You sighed in frustration and laid your head down.</p><p><i>Focus, </i><b><i>[Y/N]</i></b><i>!</i> You thought. <i>Gather your thoughts together and relax.</i></p><p>You exhaled deeply as you thought about the times you spent with Peter. From the day you met, til now. You felt your heart flutter and your face flush. Wow, you really were falling for him. You were falling hard. Gosh, you hoped this would help. You opened your eyes and got a new paper. You felt your hands moving, letting your heart do the talking. It was as if it was perfect timing when FRIDAY began to speak after you closed off the letter.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark is requesting you and Mr. Parker to immediately leave the base and assist the team for back up,\u201d FRIDAY spoke. You nodded to yourself and quickly started to change into your suit. Before you left, you saw the letter was still on your desk. You snatched it and shoved it into your suit before leaving.</p><p>The mission was rough. The team anticipated the HYDRA base would be smaller and contain only a few agents. Little did they know that the remainder of their base was underground. In other words, it was their second biggest base.</p><p>\u201cFall back!\u201d Steve called into the comms. It was getting too chaotic. Even with you and Peter as backups, it wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>You were all heading back when you heard Steve shout in pain. Everyone didn\u2019t notice and tried to adjust themselves in the jet. You looked out to see Steve hiding behind a bin. He was wounded, bleeding from being shot at.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going back <g class=\"gr_ gr_535 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"535\" data-gr-id=\"535\">for</g> Steve!\u201d You called out to the team.</p><p>\u201c<b>[Y/N]</b> no!\u201d Tony rejected.</p><p>\u201c<b>[Y/N]</b> STOP!\u201d Peter called out.</p><p>You sprinted out the Quinjet without a second thought. You went back to where Steve was last seen. Unfortunately, he wasn\u2019t there. You quickly scanned the area and found him hiding behind a tree. You sprinted as you dodged the bullets flying at you. You threw yourself to the ground and saw Steve staring at you with wide eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve stayed on the ship,\u201d Steve grunted.</p><p>You gave out a laugh, \u201cAnd let our captain get captured by HYDRA? I don\u2019t think that will be a fun reunion.\u201d</p><p>Steve laughed before allowing you to help him up. He let some of his weight onto you but knew your body wouldn\u2019t be able to handle all of his weight so he attempted to keep most of his weight to himself.</p><p>You struggled as you tried to balance his weight onto you as bullets were raining down on the two of you. Thankfully, Steve\u2019s shield took the hits. You both struggled while getting closer to the ship. The team urged the two of you to pick up the pace as the ship began to get ready to leave.</p><p>Just as you were about to step foot on the platform, you felt a sharp pain shooting up your spin. You gasped in shock and felt your body go weak. You fell to the floor, along with Steve who was leaning against you.</p><p>\u201c<b>[Y/N]</b>!\u201d Peter cried out as the team was quick to bring the two of you into the ship and take off.</p><p>You struggled to breathe as you felt the unbearable pain all around your body. Peter pulled you deeper into the ship as everyone was scattered around.</p><p>\u201cNo no no!\u201d Peter cried as the team tried to help you and Steve. Tony was by your side and pressed down on your wound to prevent it from bleeding out. You screeched in pain as you now began choking on the blood coming out of your mouth.</p><p>Peter began sobbing as Bruce tried his best to treat your bullet wound. Steve was fine by the time Bruce began to do an emergency surgery with the tools on the ship. Natasha was pulling her hair in anxiety as Clint set the jet to autopilot. Tony pulled Peter into his chest as Peter still held a tight grip on your hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine!\u201d Bruce assured as he shakily tried pulling out the bullet from your body. \u201cFocus on Peter!\u201d</p><p>You cried as you felt the sharp pain shooting up your spine once again. More blood began to leave your wound making the team freak out. Peter was now cupping both of your cheeks, his face near yours, \u201c<b>[Y/N] </b>look at me! Yes! You\u2019re doing great, just look at me okay? We\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need bandages and towels!\u201d You heard Bruce shout. Everyone scrambled to their feet and tried to collect anything that could help. You knew the wound had damaged something inside of you. You were all hours away from the base, you weren\u2019t going to make it. You accepted your fate.</p><p>You stared into Peter\u2019s eyes. The same beautiful eyes you met all those months ago. The same eyes you fell in love with. The same eyes you dreamed about every night. You almost forgot how magical they were. It was as if you were being hypnotized.</p><p>You panted as you looked up at Peter. Your eyes never breaking eye contact. Your hands shook as you reached for the letter in your suit. A bloodstained paper was firm in your hands as you gave it to Peter. He held onto your hand and paper. Tears fell down his face as he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI I-I\u2019m sorry,\u201d You whispered.</p><p>With that, you took your last breath. Your eyes drifted off as the team stared in horror.</p><p>\u201cNo no no!\u201d Peter shouted. \u201c<b>[Y/N]</b> open your eyes! Love, open your eyes!\u201d</p><p>He pulled your bloody, wounded body onto his lap as he shook you. With every shake, he hoped you would miraculously wake up. Peter shouted in agony when he realized you weren\u2019t going to wake up. He lost one of the only people he truly cared for. He would never get you back. He shouted in pain as the team looked away in shame as their tears fell down their faces. Peter sobbed into your lifeless body as the team silently reflected on what just happened for the rest of the trip back to the base.</p><p>Hours went by and the team was back at the base. Workers from the infirmary tried grabbing your body from Peter\u2019s grip.</p><p>\u201cN-No!\u201d Peter cried as he tried to pull you closer to him.</p><p>\u201cPeter, please\u2026\u201d Tony whispered as he slowly released Peter\u2019s grip from you. The workers grabbed your body from him and placed you on the table that would wheel you out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m <g class=\"gr_ gr_533 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"533\" data-gr-id=\"533\">sorry</g> kid,\u201d Tony whispered as he had tears fall down. Peter stared at your pale, lifeless body. He didn\u2019t know what to do. It was as if there were no tears left to cry. Your body was taken to the morgue as the team stared in silence. A few moments passed when Peter silently left the area. The team stared at him in sorrow. They knew he was broken.</p><p>Peter clung onto the paper in his hand and stared down at it as he maneuvered his way to his room on the residential level. He was terrified to open it. There were endless possibilities of what that paper held. His mind rambled on as he stood at the door to his room.</p><p>\u201cPassword?\u201d FRIDAY spoke out.</p><p>Peter froze. He felt his body tense up as his mind went blank. Peter\u2019s lips trembled as his breath shook, he was silent for a while. He couldn\u2019t say it.</p><p>\u201cPassword?\u201d FRIDAY repeated.</p><p>Peter choked out a sob,\u201c<b>[Y- [Y/N]</b>.\u201d He leaned his forehead against the door as he cried.</p><p>\u201cPassword accepted,\u201d FRIDAY responded. A click flickered and the door was open.</p><p>Peter closed the door behind him and finally threw himself on his bed. He allowed himself to fully release all the emotions his body was going through. Anger. Fear. Anxiety. Sorrow. Grief. Love. It felt like hours before he decided to calm down. He silently leaned against the frame of his head and stared out the window.</p><p>Wanda quietly walked into his room. She took in the scene and felt her mind going crazy with the emotions and thoughts running through Peter\u2019s head. Peter was staring out the window silently, eyes puffy and his chest shaking lightly from the lack of oxygen he received from sobbing a moment ago. No one knew what to say to Peter so they sent Wanda to check up on him. Since she can read minds, it would help her take the right steps on what to say.</p><p>\u201cHey\u2026\u201d Wanda whispered.</p><p>Peter looked up at her, his eyes drooping with pain. He turned around again and stared out the window, the letter in his tight grip. He still hasn\u2019t opened the letter, he wanted to hold onto a piece of you for as long as he could.</p><p>\u201cHave you read it yet?\u201d Wanda finally spoke.</p><p>Peter lightly shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI think you should read it.\u201d She urged.</p><p>Peter felt tears falling, \u201cThis is the last thing she gave me. The last piece of her. She died while giving it to me. I don\u2019t think I can handle reading it, not yet.\u201d</p><p>Wanda sighed, \u201cShe had a purpose for it, Peter. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, instead, he continued to stare out the window. Wanda exhaled deeply and sat on the bed with Peter. She was going to stay with Peter the whole day to make sure he was safe. She also wanted to make sure he would be fine after reading what was in that letter.</p><p>After a few hours, he finally had the courage of opening the letter. He looked at the letter in hesitation. Wanda peered up at him and waited. He sighed before opening the envelope and seeing the folded paper.</p><p>He teared up seeing your beautiful handwriting covering the entire page. Your perfume illuminated from the paper. It was as if you were still there. Peter felt his hands shake as he fixed his eyes onto the letter. He took a deep breath before starting to read.</p><p><i>Peter,</i></p><p><i>The first time we spoke was when you asked me where the training room was. I remember laughing because you looked lost. It was adorable. You were so confused by all the levels and would silently freak out when we would pass by any of the team members. I smiled as I gave you a tour of the base, showing you all the short cuts and the best hideouts whenever we needed time alone. It was honestly the best day of my life. You were so shy but I knew that we were going to be best friends. I felt the connection from that day.</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 The second time we spoke was when Tony assigned us to train together later that week. I remember walking into the training room to see you starstruck at Natasha. You wouldn\u2019t stop stuttering! It was the funniest thing to happen, especially when she tackled you on the mat. Unfortunately, you got hurt and I had to take you to the infirmary. The whole way there, I couldn\u2019t stop staring at you. The way your eyes wandered around the base and observed all the things we passed by. You looked beautiful, I knew that I was falling for you. Even as you were getting your arm brace, the small smile you gave me made my heart flip. Who was I to let Peter Parker steal my heart? I don\u2019t regret it one bit.</i></p><p><i>When we went for our mission, we were already hanging out for a while. We were both terrified. Your hands were shaking. It was our first mission with The Avengers. I stared at your hands, the way you gripped onto your suit, your knuckles were as white as a snowflake. I wanted to hold them. I wanted to tell you that everything was going to be fine. I chose not to. Instead, I called you a snowflake to help you ease your nerves. You smiled at the nickname. That damn smile. That smile healed my nerves as if we were on any other mission.</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 After that day, we started talking more than before. That mission helped us connect better. The team was happy we were getting along so well, little did they know was how hard I was falling for you. We had more missions together. We were technically forced to talk to each other by the team but it didn\u2019t feel that way. It felt like home. As weird as it sounded, I knew you were meant to be in my life. It was no coincidence.</i></p><p><i>Since that time, I started caring for you more than I did for myself. It was different. Even now, as I\u2019m writing this my heart is flipping out of its chest. Do you see how in love I am with you? I felt like we were meant to be something more than just friends. That\u2019s the sad part, I knew there would be nothing else. I know you only want to be friends. This letter is only to help me release my feelings, to help me release the tension. Even today at the training room, I know you saw me crying. I was crying for you, Peter. Don\u2019t feel bad, now. I was crying because I know you have feelings for her. Yes, her. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll always be there for you, no matter what. Peter Parker understand that I will never leave your side.</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 If you\u2019re reading this, that means I suddenly had the courage to show how I truly felt. That, or something bad happened. I don\u2019t know what it is but I\u2019m sure it was for the best. I hope this letter finds you well.</i></p><p><i>P.S. I love you Peter Parker</i></p><p><i>- <b>[Y/N]</b></i></p><p>A cry escaped Peter\u2019s lips. He pulled the letter to his chest as he sobbed into his room. Wanda gave him a pained smile as she pulled him into her chest, stroking his hair. She waited as she felt Peter\u2019s mind racing. He continued crying and sobbing as he thought about all the moments you two had. How it was all being ripped away from him.</p><p>\u201cShe loved you, Peter,\u201d Wanda finally spoke. \u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself for a decision she made.\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head and felt tears falling down his cheeks, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was scared of your rejection.\u201d Wanda sighed.</p><p>He cried, he never felt so guilty in his entire life. He looked up at Wanda, \u201cThat\u2019s the thing. I loved her. I was head over heels for her. From the day we met, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her. I-I was just too scared to admit it\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Wanda sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted her to write you this letter. I was planning on giving it to you at the end of the day. I was hoping you two would realize your feelings for one another.\u201d</p><p>Peter covered his face and began to sob uncontrollably. Wanda sighed in sorrow, she knew exactly what Peter was feeling. Peter continued to cry at the thought of you. He knew he can\u2019t have you. He will never have you. Everything he loves always dies, he just never thought it would be you too. He fell hard for you and you never even knew.</p>",

Your school presentation was not what you hoped it would be, you embarrassed yourself in front of all your friends, training was a disaster, and to make it all worse, you just heard that your crush was falling for someone who was clearly not you. It felt like the day was just a slap in the face. You were overwhelmed with how terrible the day has been.</p><p>You let out a shaky breath as you continued to hit the punching bag. You knew this was the best way to release all your stress and anxiety so you have been doing this for the past few hours. The more you punched, the angrier you got. Tears started to fall, you didn\u2019t know why but it was kind of helping. You didn\u2019t notice how intense your punching had gotten before you were interrupted.</p><p>\u201c<b>[Y/N]</b>?\u201d A voice spoke out.</p><p>You didn\u2019t need to see his face in order to know it was your best friend. You quickly wiped your tears before Peter could see.</p><p>\u201cYes, Peter?\u201d You whispered then continued to punch the bag. You did <i>not </i>want him to see you crying. If he saw you crying he\u2019d insist on you telling him and that won\u2019t end well for you.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He questioned with concern as he stood next to you with sweat covering his shirtless body. You avoided eye contact, not wanting it to be harder on yourself.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d You answered as you punched the bag. You noticed that you started to punch harder and pictured <i>her</i> as the bag.</p><p>\u201c<b>[Y/N]</b>,\u201d Peter urged. He saw your facial expression, your puffy eyes and how exhausted you looked. \u201cWe both know there\u2019s something wrong. Please, tell me. We tell each other everything.\u201d</p><p><i>Not this time.</i> You thought in your head. You didn\u2019t want to admit that you had feelings for him. Every time you saw his face you saw <i>her</i>.<i> </i>You hated it.</p><p>You were both interrupted by someone clearing their throat. You and Peter turned to see Wanda with her arms crossed in front of her chest. You dropped your hands, the two of you giving her full attention. She gave the two of you a quirked eyebrow, \u201cI need to speak with <b>[Y/N]</b>.\u201d</p><p>You looked at Peter before grabbing your things. As you were about to leave you felt Peter grab your hand. \u201cYou know I care. I\u2019ll always be there for you,\u201d Peter whispered to you. \u201cI\u2019ll be in my room if you want to talk.\u201d You stared at him, not knowing what to say. He sighed then let go of your hand and walked away.</p><p>You felt chills run down your spine as you then walked to Wanda\u2019s room. Before you could sit down you heard the door shut. You jumped in surprise then relaxed on her bed.</p><p>\u201cSo, did Steve talk to you about training me?\u201d You asked as you started to play with a stress ball she had sitting to the side of her desk. Your eyes wandered around her room, taking in all her decorations and pictures she had hung up.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Wanda started. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I wanted to talk about.\u201d She sat on the corner of her bed directly in front of you. Your knees were basically touching.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d You questioned, your eyes now focused on her. \u201cSo, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to ask you a question and I need you to be completely honest with me. No questions, just answer.\u201d Wanda spoke sternly.</p><p>\u201cUhh\u2026 alright?\u201d You whispered as your heart started to race. Every single bad thing you have ever done started popping up in your head. You stealing Vision\u2019s food for the past 2 weeks, you pranking Tony every other day, you hacking into Steve\u2019s computer and creating dating profiles, you talking to Thor about-</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you told Peter about your feelings towards him?\u201d Wanda finally asked.</p><p>This threw you off completely. You would like to say you were shocked, but at the same time you should\u2019ve known, she has the ability to read minds. You mentally slapped yourself.</p><p>\u201cLook, it\u2019s not as easy as it seems\u2026\u201d You blushed. \u201cI don\u2019t know what traditions you had in Sokovia but here in America, girls don\u2019t really say they like someone unless they\u2019re willing to take the risk of being humiliated. Today has not been my day either so, I\u2019d rather not.\u201d</p><p>Wanda smirked, \u201c<b>[Y/N]</b>, I think you should tell him. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no way.\u201d You shook your head as you stood up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to regret it,<b> [Y/N]</b>.\u201d Wanda continued. \u201cAt least think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing! I don\u2019t want to! Just thinking about it makes me want to throw up.\u201d You started speaking. You then thought about it, the embarrassment it would bring. \u201cI actually think I\u2019m going to throw up\u2026\u201d You gripped your stomach and hunched over her desk.</p><p>Wanda laughed lightly at your hysteria, \u201c<b>[Y/N]</b> you are young and have so much to look forward to. Take this risk!\u201d That\u2019s the thing, Wanda knew it wasn\u2019t a risk. She can read Peter\u2019s mind and see how much he loves you.</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t,\u201d You stuttered as you violently clawed at the stress ball.</p><p>Wanda tried not to laugh, biting her lip before continuing, \u201cWhat if you write how you feel about him on a piece of paper like if you\u2019re talking to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, a love letter?\u201d You questioned as you stopped squishing the ball to death.</p><p>Wanda shrugged, \u201cIf you want to call it that.\u201d</p><p>You gave her a look, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d</p><p>Wanda adjusted herself to face you properly, \u201cJust say everything, pour everything out.\u201d</p><p>You thought for a moment. Maybe you should, what could go wrong? You\u2019re just letting your feelings out so you don\u2019t burst out all your emotions at anyone\u2019s face.</p><p>You slowly nodded, \u201cI guess it\u2019s not a bad idea\u2026\u201d</p><p>Before the conversation could continue, FRIDAY spoke into the room. \u201cI apologize for interrupting your conversation with Miss <b>[L/N]</b>. Miss Maximoff, Rogers is urging an emergency mission. You will report to the hanger immediately. Miss <b>[L/N] </b>and Mr. Parker will remain at the base until further notice.\u201d</p><p>Wanda looked over at you as you stood up, \u201cLook, I want you to know that it\u2019s fine to have feelings for someone. Please don\u2019t be ashamed of your feelings. Love is a beautiful thing, embrace it!\u201d</p><p>You smiled weakly at her and nodded. Before you left the room, you looked back at her, \u201cGood luck on the mission, I know you\u2019ll do amazing!\u201d You encouraged. Wanda smiled and left the area while you walked to your room.</p><p>You looked around the room before deciding to start on the letter. It\u2019s the least you can do for Wanda. You didn\u2019t know why she was urging you to express your feelings so badly, but you assumed she just wanted to have some sort of entertainment out of this. You shook your head before you started writing.</p><p><i>\u201cDear Pete,\u201d</i> You wrote down. You shook your head and erased the two words. <g class=\"gr_ gr_549 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"549\" data-gr-id=\"549\">Too</g> clich\u00e9. <i>\u201cHey! Peter\u2026.\u201d</i> No. \u201c<i>Heeey!\u201d</i> Ew, no. <i>\u201cPenis Parker!\u201d</i> Ugh, he\u2019d hate it. The eraser was your new best friend. The shards of that pink rubber were scattered all over your desk.<i> \u201cYo, Peter\u2026\u201d</i> NO! You sighed in frustration and laid your head down.</p><p><i>Focus, </i><b><i>[Y/N]</i></b><i>!</i> You thought. <i>Gather your thoughts together and relax.</i></p><p>You exhaled deeply as you thought about the times you spent with Peter. From the day you met, til now. You felt your heart flutter and your face flush. Wow, you really were falling for him. You were falling hard. Gosh, you hoped this would help. You opened your eyes and got a new paper. You felt your hands moving, letting your heart do the talking. It was as if it was perfect timing when FRIDAY began to speak after you closed off the letter.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark is requesting you and Mr. Parker to immediately leave the base and assist the team for back up,\u201d FRIDAY spoke. You nodded to yourself and quickly started to change into your suit. Before you left, you saw the letter was still on your desk. You snatched it and shoved it into your suit before leaving.</p><p>The mission was rough. The team anticipated the HYDRA base would be smaller and contain only a few agents. Little did they know that the remainder of their base was underground. In other words, it was their second biggest base.</p><p>\u201cFall back!\u201d Steve called into the comms. It was getting too chaotic. Even with you and Peter as backups, it wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>You were all heading back when you heard Steve shout in pain. Everyone didn\u2019t notice and tried to adjust themselves in the jet. You looked out to see Steve hiding behind a bin. He was wounded, bleeding from being shot at.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going back <g class=\"gr_ gr_535 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"535\" data-gr-id=\"535\">for</g> Steve!\u201d You called out to the team.</p><p>\u201c<b>[Y/N]</b> no!\u201d Tony rejected.</p><p>\u201c<b>[Y/N]</b> STOP!\u201d Peter called out.</p><p>You sprinted out the Quinjet without a second thought. You went back to where Steve was last seen. Unfortunately, he wasn\u2019t there. You quickly scanned the area and found him hiding behind a tree. You sprinted as you dodged the bullets flying at you. You threw yourself to the ground and saw Steve staring at you with wide eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve stayed on the ship,\u201d Steve grunted.</p><p>You gave out a laugh, \u201cAnd let our captain get captured by HYDRA? I don\u2019t think that will be a fun reunion.\u201d</p><p>Steve laughed before allowing you to help him up. He let some of his weight onto you but knew your body wouldn\u2019t be able to handle all of his weight so he attempted to keep most of his weight to himself.</p><p>You struggled as you tried to balance his weight onto you as bullets were raining down on the two of you. Thankfully, Steve\u2019s shield took the hits. You both struggled while getting closer to the ship. The team urged the two of you to pick up the pace as the ship began to get ready to leave.</p><p>Just as you were about to step foot on the platform, you felt a sharp pain shooting up your spin. You gasped in shock and felt your body go weak. You fell to the floor, along with Steve who was leaning against you.</p><p>\u201c<b>[Y/N]</b>!\u201d Peter cried out as the team was quick to bring the two of you into the ship and take off.</p><p>You struggled to breathe as you felt the unbearable pain all around your body. Peter pulled you deeper into the ship as everyone was scattered around.</p><p>\u201cNo no no!\u201d Peter cried as the team tried to help you and Steve. Tony was by your side and pressed down on your wound to prevent it from bleeding out. You screeched in pain as you now began choking on the blood coming out of your mouth.</p><p>Peter began sobbing as Bruce tried his best to treat your bullet wound. Steve was fine by the time Bruce began to do an emergency surgery with the tools on the ship. Natasha was pulling her hair in anxiety as Clint set the jet to autopilot. Tony pulled Peter into his chest as Peter still held a tight grip on your hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine!\u201d Bruce assured as he shakily tried pulling out the bullet from your body. \u201cFocus on Peter!\u201d</p><p>You cried as you felt the sharp pain shooting up your spine once again. More blood began to leave your wound making the team freak out. Peter was now cupping both of your cheeks, his face near yours, \u201c<b>[Y/N] </b>look at me! Yes! You\u2019re doing great, just look at me okay? We\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need bandages and towels!\u201d You heard Bruce shout. Everyone scrambled to their feet and tried to collect anything that could help. You knew the wound had damaged something inside of you. You were all hours away from the base, you weren\u2019t going to make it. You accepted your fate.</p><p>You stared into Peter\u2019s eyes. The same beautiful eyes you met all those months ago. The same eyes you fell in love with. The same eyes you dreamed about every night. You almost forgot how magical they were. It was as if you were being hypnotized.</p><p>You panted as you looked up at Peter. Your eyes never breaking eye contact. Your hands shook as you reached for the letter in your suit. A bloodstained paper was firm in your hands as you gave it to Peter. He held onto your hand and paper. Tears fell down his face as he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI I-I\u2019m sorry,\u201d You whispered.</p><p>With that, you took your last breath. Your eyes drifted off as the team stared in horror.</p><p>\u201cNo no no!\u201d Peter shouted. \u201c<b>[Y/N]</b> open your eyes! Love, open your eyes!\u201d</p><p>He pulled your bloody, wounded body onto his lap as he shook you. With every shake, he hoped you would miraculously wake up. Peter shouted in agony when he realized you weren\u2019t going to wake up. He lost one of the only people he truly cared for. He would never get you back. He shouted in pain as the team looked away in shame as their tears fell down their faces. Peter sobbed into your lifeless body as the team silently reflected on what just happened for the rest of the trip back to the base.</p><p>Hours went by and the team was back at the base. Workers from the infirmary tried grabbing your body from Peter\u2019s grip.</p><p>\u201cN-No!\u201d Peter cried as he tried to pull you closer to him.</p><p>\u201cPeter, please\u2026\u201d Tony whispered as he slowly released Peter\u2019s grip from you. The workers grabbed your body from him and placed you on the table that would wheel you out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m <g class=\"gr_ gr_533 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"533\" data-gr-id=\"533\">sorry</g> kid,\u201d Tony whispered as he had tears fall down. Peter stared at your pale, lifeless body. He didn\u2019t know what to do. It was as if there were no tears left to cry. Your body was taken to the morgue as the team stared in silence. A few moments passed when Peter silently left the area. The team stared at him in sorrow. They knew he was broken.</p><p>Peter clung onto the paper in his hand and stared down at it as he maneuvered his way to his room on the residential level. He was terrified to open it. There were endless possibilities of what that paper held. His mind rambled on as he stood at the door to his room.</p><p>\u201cPassword?\u201d FRIDAY spoke out.</p><p>Peter froze. He felt his body tense up as his mind went blank. Peter\u2019s lips trembled as his breath shook, he was silent for a while.

A click flickered and the door was open.</p><p>Peter closed the door behind him and finally threw himself on his bed. He allowed himself to fully release all the emotions his body was going through. Anger. Fear. Anxiety. Sorrow. Grief. Love. It felt like hours before he decided to calm down. He silently leaned against the frame of his head and stared out the window.</p><p>Wanda quietly walked into his room. She took in the scene and felt her mind going crazy with the emotions and thoughts running through Peter\u2019s head. Peter was staring out the window silently, eyes puffy and his chest shaking lightly from the lack of oxygen he received from sobbing a moment ago. No one knew what to say to Peter so they sent Wanda to check up on him. Since she can read minds, it would help her take the right steps on what to say.</p><p>\u201cHey\u2026\u201d Wanda whispered.</p><p>Peter looked up at her, his eyes drooping with pain. He turned around again and stared out the window, the letter in his tight grip. He still hasn\u2019t opened the letter, he wanted to hold onto a piece of you for as long as he could.</p><p>\u201cHave you read it yet?\u201d Wanda finally spoke.</p><p>Peter lightly shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI think you should read it.\u201d She urged.</p><p>Peter felt tears falling, \u201cThis is the last thing she gave me. The last piece of her. She died while giving it to me. I don\u2019t think I can handle reading it, not yet.\u201d</p><p>Wanda sighed, \u201cShe had a purpose for it, Peter. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, instead, he continued to stare out the window. Wanda exhaled deeply and sat on the bed with Peter. She was going to stay with Peter the whole day to make sure he was safe. She also wanted to make sure he would be fine after reading what was in that letter.</p><p>After a few hours, he finally had the courage of opening the letter. He looked at the letter in hesitation. Wanda peered up at him and waited. He sighed before opening the envelope and seeing the folded paper.</p><p>He teared up seeing your beautiful handwriting covering the entire page. Your perfume illuminated from the paper. It was as if you were still there. Peter felt his hands shake as he fixed his eyes onto the letter. He took a deep breath before starting to read.</p><p><i>Peter,</i></p><p><i>The first time we spoke was when you asked me where the training room was. I remember laughing because you looked lost. It was adorable. You were so confused by all the levels and would silently freak out when we would pass by any of the team members. I smiled as I gave you a tour of the base, showing you all the short cuts and the best hideouts whenever we needed time alone. It was honestly the best day of my life. You were so shy but I knew that we were going to be best friends. I felt the connection from that day.</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 The second time we spoke was when Tony assigned us to train together later that week. I remember walking into the training room to see you starstruck at Natasha. You wouldn\u2019t stop stuttering! It was the funniest thing to happen, especially when she tackled you on the mat. Unfortunately, you got hurt and I had to take you to the infirmary. The whole way there, I couldn\u2019t stop staring at you. The way your eyes wandered around the base and observed all the things we passed by. You looked beautiful, I knew that I was falling for you. Even as you were getting your arm brace, the small smile you gave me made my heart flip. Who was I to let Peter Parker steal my heart? I don\u2019t regret it one bit.</i></p><p><i>When we went for our mission, we were already hanging out for a while. We were both terrified. Your hands were shaking. It was our first mission with The Avengers. I stared at your hands, the way you gripped onto your suit, your knuckles were as white as a snowflake. I wanted to hold them. I wanted to tell you that everything was going to be fine. I chose not to. Instead, I called you a snowflake to help you ease your nerves. You smiled at the nickname. That damn smile. That smile healed my nerves as if we were on any other mission.</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 After that day, we started talking more than before. That mission helped us connect better. The team was happy we were getting along so well, little did they know was how hard I was falling for you. We had more missions together.

I know you only want to be friends. This letter is only to help me release my feelings, to help me release the tension. Even today at the training room, I know you saw me crying. I was crying for you, Peter. Don\u2019t feel bad, now. I was crying because I know you have feelings for her. Yes, her. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll always be there for you, no matter what.

I love you Peter Parker</i></p><p><i>- <b>[Y/N]</b></i></p><p>A cry escaped Peter\u2019s lips. He pulled the letter to his chest as he sobbed into his room. Wanda gave him a pained smile as she pulled him into her chest, stroking his hair. She waited as she felt Peter\u2019s mind racing. He continued crying and sobbing as he thought about all the moments you two had. How it was all being ripped away from him.</p><p>\u201cShe loved you, Peter,\u201d Wanda finally spoke. \u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself for a decision she made.\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head and felt tears falling down his cheeks, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was scared of your rejection.\u201d Wanda sighed.</p><p>He cried, he never felt so guilty in his entire life. He looked up at Wanda, \u201cThat\u2019s the thing. I loved her. I was head over heels for her. From the day we met, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her. I-I was just too scared to admit it\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Wanda sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted her to write you this letter. I was planning on giving it to you at the end of the day. I was hoping you two would realize your feelings for one another.\u201d</p><p>Peter covered his face and began to sob uncontrollably. Wanda sighed in sorrow, she knew exactly what Peter was feeling. Peter continued to cry at the thought of you. He knew he can\u2019t have you. He will never have you. Everything he loves always dies, he just never thought it would be you too. He fell hard for you and you never even knew.</p>",

Your school presentation was not what you hoped it would be, you embarrassed yourself in front of all your friends, training was a disaster, and to make it all worse, you just heard that your crush was falling for someone who was clearly not you. It felt like the day was just a slap in the face. You were overwhelmed with how terrible the day has been.</p><p>You let out a shaky breath as you continued to hit the punching bag. You knew this was the best way to release all your stress and anxiety so you have been doing this for the past few hours. The more you punched, the angrier you got. Tears started to fall, you didn&rsquo;t know why but it was kind of helping. You didn&rsquo;t notice how intense your punching had gotten before you were interrupted.</p><p>&ldquo;<b>[Y/N]</b>?&rdquo; A voice spoke out.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t need to see his face in order to know it was your best friend. You quickly wiped your tears before Peter could see.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Peter?&rdquo; You whispered then continued to punch the bag. You did <i>not </i>want him to see you crying. If he saw you crying he&rsquo;d insist on you telling him and that won&rsquo;t end well for you.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; He questioned with concern as he stood next to you with sweat covering his shirtless body. You avoided eye contact, not wanting it to be harder on yourself.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; You answered as you punched the bag. You noticed that you started to punch harder and pictured <i>her</i> as the bag.</p><p>&ldquo;<b>[Y/N]</b>,&rdquo; Peter urged. He saw your facial expression, your puffy eyes and how exhausted you looked. &ldquo;We both know there&rsquo;s something wrong. Please, tell me. We tell each other everything.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Not this time.</i> You thought in your head. You didn&rsquo;t want to admit that you had feelings for him. Every time you saw his face you saw <i>her</i>.<i> </i>You hated it.</p><p>You were both interrupted by someone clearing their throat. You and Peter turned to see Wanda with her arms crossed in front of her chest. You dropped your hands, the two of you giving her full attention. She gave the two of you a quirked eyebrow, &ldquo;I need to speak with <b>[Y/N]</b>.&rdquo;</p><p>You looked at Peter before grabbing your things. As you were about to leave you felt Peter grab your hand. &ldquo;You know I care. I&rsquo;ll always be there for you,&rdquo; Peter whispered to you. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be in my room if you want to talk.&rdquo; You stared at him, not knowing what to say. He sighed then let go of your hand and walked away.</p><p>You felt chills run down your spine as you then walked to Wanda&rsquo;s room. Before you could sit down you heard the door shut. You jumped in surprise then relaxed on her bed.</p><p>&ldquo;So, did Steve talk to you about training me?&rdquo; You asked as you started to play with a stress ball she had sitting to the side of her desk. Your eyes wandered around her room, taking in all her decorations and pictures she had hung up.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Wanda started. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I wanted to talk about.&rdquo; She sat on the corner of her bed directly in front of you. Your knees were basically touching.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; You questioned, your eyes now focused on her. &ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I need to ask you a question and I need you to be completely honest with me. No questions, just answer.&rdquo; Wanda spoke sternly.</p><p>&ldquo;Uhh&hellip; alright?&rdquo; You whispered as your heart started to race. Every single bad thing you have ever done started popping up in your head. You stealing Vision&rsquo;s food for the past 2 weeks, you pranking Tony every other day, you hacking into Steve&rsquo;s computer and creating dating profiles, you talking to Thor about-</p><p>&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you told Peter about your feelings towards him?&rdquo; Wanda finally asked.</p><p>This threw you off completely. You would like to say you were shocked, but at the same time you should&rsquo;ve known, she has the ability to read minds. You mentally slapped yourself.</p><p>&ldquo;Look, it&rsquo;s not as easy as it seems&hellip;&rdquo; You blushed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what traditions you had in Sokovia but here in America, girls don&rsquo;t really say they like someone unless they&rsquo;re willing to take the risk of being humiliated. Today has not been my day either so, I&rsquo;d rather not.&rdquo;</p><p>Wanda smirked, &ldquo;<b>[Y/N]</b>, I think you should tell him. Trust me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no way.&rdquo; You shook your head as you stood up.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to regret it,<b> [Y/N]</b>.&rdquo; Wanda continued. &ldquo;At least think about it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the thing! I don&rsquo;t want to! Just thinking about it makes me want to throw up.&rdquo; You started speaking. You then thought about it, the embarrassment it would bring. &ldquo;I actually think I&rsquo;m going to throw up&hellip;&rdquo; You gripped your stomach and hunched over her desk.</p><p>Wanda laughed lightly at your hysteria, &ldquo;<b>[Y/N]</b> you are young and have so much to look forward to. Take this risk!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the thing, Wanda knew it wasn&rsquo;t a risk. She can read Peter&rsquo;s mind and see how much he loves you.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; You stuttered as you violently clawed at the stress ball.</p><p>Wanda tried not to laugh, biting her lip before continuing, &ldquo;What if you write how you feel about him on a piece of paper like if you&rsquo;re talking to him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So, a love letter?&rdquo; You questioned as you stopped squishing the ball to death.</p><p>Wanda shrugged, &ldquo;If you want to call it that.&rdquo;</p><p>You gave her a look, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Wanda adjusted herself to face you properly, &ldquo;Just say everything, pour everything out.&rdquo;</p><p>You thought for a moment. Maybe you should, what could go wrong? You&rsquo;re just letting your feelings out so you don&rsquo;t burst out all your emotions at anyone&rsquo;s face.</p><p>You slowly nodded, &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s not a bad idea&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Before the conversation could continue, FRIDAY spoke into the room. &ldquo;I apologize for interrupting your conversation with Miss <b>[L/N]</b>. Miss Maximoff, Rogers is urging an emergency mission. You will report to the hanger immediately. Miss <b>[L/N] </b>and Mr. Parker will remain at the base until further notice.&rdquo;</p><p>Wanda looked over at you as you stood up, &ldquo;Look, I want you to know that it&rsquo;s fine to have feelings for someone. Please don&rsquo;t be ashamed of your feelings. Love is a beautiful thing, embrace it!&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled weakly at her and nodded. Before you left the room, you looked back at her, &ldquo;Good luck on the mission, I know you&rsquo;ll do amazing!&rdquo; You encouraged. Wanda smiled and left the area while you walked to your room.</p><p>You looked around the room before deciding to start on the letter. It&rsquo;s the least you can do for Wanda. You didn&rsquo;t know why she was urging you to express your feelings so badly, but you assumed she just wanted to have some sort of entertainment out of this. You shook your head before you started writing.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Dear Pete,&rdquo;</i> You wrote down. You shook your head and erased the two words. Too clich&eacute;. <i>&ldquo;Hey! Peter&hellip;.&rdquo;</i> No. &ldquo;<i>Heeey!&rdquo;</i> Ew, no. <i>&ldquo;Penis Parker!&rdquo;</i> Ugh, he&rsquo;d hate it. The eraser was your new best friend. The shards of that pink rubber were scattered all over your desk.<i> &ldquo;Yo, Peter&hellip;&rdquo;</i> NO! You sighed in frustration and laid your head down.</p><p><i>Focus, </i><b><i>[Y/N]</i></b><i>!</i> You thought. <i>Gather your thoughts together and relax.</i></p><p>You exhaled deeply as you thought about the times you spent with Peter. From the day you met, til now. You felt your heart flutter and your face flush. Wow, you really were falling for him. You were falling hard. Gosh, you hoped this would help. You opened your eyes and got a new paper. You felt your hands moving, letting your heart do the talking. It was as if it was perfect timing when FRIDAY began to speak after you closed off the letter.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark is requesting you and Mr. Parker to immediately leave the base and assist the team for back up,&rdquo; FRIDAY spoke. You nodded to yourself and quickly started to change into your suit. Before you left, you saw the letter was still on your desk. You snatched it and shoved it into your suit before leaving.</p><p>The mission was rough. The team anticipated the HYDRA base would be smaller and contain only a few agents. Little did they know that the remainder of their base was underground. In other words, it was their second biggest base.</p><p>&ldquo;Fall back!&rdquo; Steve called into the comms. It was getting too chaotic. Even with you and Peter as backups, it wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p><p>You were all heading back when you heard Steve shout in pain. Everyone didn&rsquo;t notice and tried to adjust themselves in the jet. You looked out to see Steve hiding behind a bin. He was wounded, bleeding from being shot at.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back for Steve!&rdquo; You called out to the team.</p><p>&ldquo;<b>[Y/N]</b> no!&rdquo; Tony rejected.</p><p>&ldquo;<b>[Y/N]</b> STOP!&rdquo; Peter called out.</p><p>You sprinted out the Quinjet without a second thought. You went back to where Steve was last seen. Unfortunately, he wasn&rsquo;t there. You quickly scanned the area and found him hiding behind a tree. You sprinted as you dodged the bullets flying at you. You threw yourself to the ground and saw Steve staring at you with wide eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;You should&rsquo;ve stayed on the ship,&rdquo; Steve grunted.</p><p>You gave out a laugh, &ldquo;And let our captain get captured by HYDRA? I don&rsquo;t think that will be a fun reunion.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve laughed before allowing you to help him up. He let some of his weight onto you but knew your body wouldn&rsquo;t be able to handle all of his weight so he attempted to keep most of his weight to himself.</p><p>You struggled as you tried to balance his weight onto you as bullets were raining down on the two of you. Thankfully, Steve&rsquo;s shield took the hits. You both struggled while getting closer to the ship. The team urged the two of you to pick up the pace as the ship began to get ready to leave.</p><p>Just as you were about to step foot on the platform, you felt a sharp pain shooting up your spin. You gasped in shock and felt your body go weak. You fell to the floor, along with Steve who was leaning against you.</p><p>&ldquo;<b>[Y/N]</b>!&rdquo; Peter cried out as the team was quick to bring the two of you into the ship and take off.</p><p>You struggled to breathe as you felt the unbearable pain all around your body. Peter pulled you deeper into the ship as everyone was scattered around.</p><p>&ldquo;No no no!&rdquo; Peter cried as the team tried to help you and Steve. Tony was by your side and pressed down on your wound to prevent it from bleeding out. You screeched in pain as you now began choking on the blood coming out of your mouth.</p><p>Peter began sobbing as Bruce tried his best to treat your bullet wound. Steve was fine by the time Bruce began to do an emergency surgery with the tools on the ship. Natasha was pulling her hair in anxiety as Clint set the jet to autopilot. Tony pulled Peter into his chest as Peter still held a tight grip on your hand.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be fine!&rdquo; Bruce assured as he shakily tried pulling out the bullet from your body. &ldquo;Focus on Peter!&rdquo;</p><p>You cried as you felt the sharp pain shooting up your spine once again. More blood began to leave your wound making the team freak out. Peter was now cupping both of your cheeks, his face near yours, &ldquo;<b>[Y/N] </b>look at me! Yes! You&rsquo;re doing great, just look at me okay? We&rsquo;re going to be okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I need bandages and towels!&rdquo; You heard Bruce shout. Everyone scrambled to their feet and tried to collect anything that could help. You knew the wound had damaged something inside of you. You were all hours away from the base, you weren&rsquo;t going to make it. You accepted your fate.</p><p>You stared into Peter&rsquo;s eyes. The same beautiful eyes you met all those months ago. The same eyes you fell in love with. The same eyes you dreamed about every night. You almost forgot how magical they were. It was as if you were being hypnotized.</p><p>You panted as you looked up at Peter. Your eyes never breaking eye contact. Your hands shook as you reached for the letter in your suit. A bloodstained paper was firm in your hands as you gave it to Peter. He held onto your hand and paper. Tears fell down his face as he shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;I I-I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; You whispered.</p><p>With that, you took your last breath. Your eyes drifted off as the team stared in horror.</p><p>&ldquo;No no no!&rdquo; Peter shouted. &ldquo;<b>[Y/N]</b> open your eyes! Love, open your eyes!&rdquo;</p><p>He pulled your bloody, wounded body onto his lap as he shook you. With every shake, he hoped you would miraculously wake up. Peter shouted in agony when he realized you weren&rsquo;t going to wake up. He lost one of the only people he truly cared for. He would never get you back. He shouted in pain as the team looked away in shame as their tears fell down their faces. Peter sobbed into your lifeless body as the team silently reflected on what just happened for the rest of the trip back to the base.</p><p>Hours went by and the team was back at the base. Workers from the infirmary tried grabbing your body from Peter&rsquo;s grip.</p><p>&ldquo;N-No!&rdquo; Peter cried as he tried to pull you closer to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, please&hellip;&rdquo; Tony whispered as he slowly released Peter&rsquo;s grip from you. The workers grabbed your body from him and placed you on the table that would wheel you out.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry kid,&rdquo; Tony whispered as he had tears fall down. Peter stared at your pale, lifeless body. He didn&rsquo;t know what to do. It was as if there were no tears left to cry. Your body was taken to the morgue as the team stared in silence. A few moments passed when Peter silently left the area. The team stared at him in sorrow. They knew he was broken.</p><p>Peter clung onto the paper in his hand and stared down at it as he maneuvered his way to his room on the residential level. He was terrified to open it. There were endless possibilities of what that paper held. His mind rambled on as he stood at the door to his room.</p><p>&ldquo;Password?&rdquo; FRIDAY spoke out.</p><p>Peter froze. He felt his body tense up as his mind went blank. Peter&rsquo;s lips trembled as his breath shook, he was silent for a while. He couldn&rsquo;t say it.</p><p>&ldquo;Password?&rdquo; FRIDAY repeated.</p><p>Peter choked out a sob,&ldquo;<b>[Y- [Y/N]</b>.&rdquo; He leaned his forehead against the door as he cried.</p><p>&ldquo;Password accepted,&rdquo; FRIDAY responded. A click flickered and the door was open.</p><p>Peter closed the door behind him and finally threw himself on his bed. He allowed himself to fully release all the emotions his body was going through. Anger. Fear. Anxiety. Sorrow. Grief. Love. It felt like hours before he decided to calm down. He silently leaned against the frame of his head and stared out the window.</p><p>Wanda quietly walked into his room. She took in the scene and felt her mind going crazy with the emotions and thoughts running through Peter&rsquo;s head. Peter was staring out the window silently, eyes puffy and his chest shaking lightly from the lack of oxygen he received from sobbing a moment ago. No one knew what to say to Peter so they sent Wanda to check up on him.

She was going to stay with Peter the whole day to make sure he was safe.

I was planning on giving it to you at the end of the day. I was hoping you two would realize your feelings for one another.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter covered his face and began to sob uncontrollably. Wanda sighed in sorrow, she knew exactly what Peter was feeling. Peter continued to cry at the thought of you. He knew he can&rsquo;t have you. He will never have you. Everything he loves always dies, he just never thought it would be you too. He fell hard for you and you never even knew.</p>",

He was more awake than he was right now. She carried on a whole conversation, tried her best to get Peter to take a break from it all. At least until the end of the semester. Anything to allow Peter to rest, feel like somewhat of a regular college student instead of saving people and not himself.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Pete, honey,&rdquo; May said while she bent over, her lips hovering over his forehead as Peter&rsquo;s body went ridged.

She knew the answer, and the way if Peter were awake, he would come up with some excuse as to why he avoided telling you for so long. In the same way, he would have avoided telling her if it wasn&rsquo;t for Pepper calling her that night. &ldquo;Of course you didn&rsquo;t, I knew the second she looked at your yesterday morning she had no idea about it.&rdquo;</i></p>\n<p><i>May&rsquo;s fingers lingered over the scar, much like they had the same night he was in here a couple of weeks ago. He was more awake than he was right now. She carried on a whole conversation, tried her best to get Peter to take a break from it all. At least until the end of the semester. Anything to allow Peter to rest, feel like somewhat of a regular college student instead of saving people and not himself.</i></p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;Pete, honey,&rdquo; May said while she bent over, her lips hovering over his forehead as Peter&rsquo;s body went ridged. But when she pressed a delicate kiss on him, he relaxed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to wake up.&rdquo;</i></p>\n</p>",

You looked at your dad&rsquo;s face seeing the sad look and the guilt in his eyes. You knew what he was thinking and you were determined to do it before him. You turned invisible, running towards Thanos before he could. You stopped in front of him, figuring out how you could do this. You gripped the gauntlet, looking at his confused face. You grabbed all the stones without him knowing, turning visible. </p><p>He pushed you off of him, holding up the gauntlet. &ldquo;You thought you could defeat me?&rdquo; He scoffed. &ldquo;I am inevitable.&rdquo; You knew some were watching, you knew Tony was on his way, you knew what was going to happen. He snapped his fingers and nothing happened. </p><p>He looked at the gauntlet with confusion, turning it to see that the stones weren&rsquo;t there. He looked at you with wide eyes, seeing you holding up your hand while panting, tears falling. </p><p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; you panted looking over at your dad, smiling at him. You looked back at Thanos, a determined look on your face. &ldquo;Am a Stark.&rdquo; With that you snapped, hearing your father scream no. A bright flash illuminated around you and you stumbled to a big rock after seeing Thanos vanish. </p><p>Rhodey came over to you, cupping your cheek and nodding to you. &ldquo;You did good kid, you did good.&rdquo; You smiled weakly hearing someone else. You felt eyes on you from every direction, hearing the gasps of people. </p><p>Peter landed in front of you. &ldquo;Y/n?&rdquo; He shakily said looking in your eyes. You lazily turned your head, &ldquo;Hey, Y/n we won. We won Y/n. You did it Y/n.&rdquo; He was crying, scared because he was losing the girl who was like a sister to him. </p><p>Pepper lifted him from you, as he cried into his hands next to Rhodey. Tony and Pepper squatted in front of you, tears in both of their eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Tony whimpered, scanning his eyes over your charred skin, holding his hand against your arc reactor. He took a deep breath, casting his eyes away from you as you put your hand over his.</p><p>&ldquo;Friday,&rdquo; Pepper said, looking at you with teary eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;All life functions critical,&rdquo; Friday replied. She looked down, letting the tears trickle down her cheeks as she knew her daughter wasn&rsquo;t going to make it out of this.</p><p>&ldquo;Dad.&rdquo; You whispered lightly, sounding only like a released breath. He looked at your eyes, seeing them crinkle as you smiled weakly. &ldquo;I love you 3000.&rdquo; You said.</p><p>He let out a choked sob, shaking his head. &ldquo;No, please.&rdquo;</p><p>Pepper put her hand over yours and Tony&rsquo;s &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be okay.&rdquo; She said, looking at you. &ldquo;You can rest.&rdquo; The arc reactor dimmed and Pepper sobbed while looking at the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;Please.&rdquo; Tony whispered, &ldquo;God.&rdquo; He choked out, holding onto Pepper. &ldquo;How are we going to tell her?&rdquo; </p><p>Pepper took a deep breath as she looked up to the dark sky. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p>-</p><p>The dark sky reflected across the lake, a small sprinkle of rain dusting the grass and fell into the lake, a soft drip drop sound resonating on this day of mourning. Tony and Pepper held onto each of Morgan&rsquo;s hands, a floral float on the other hand of each. Tony held a small float for you while Pepper held one for Natasha. Each replicated your superhero persona but still captured your essence as yourselves.  </p><p>Peter stood directly behind the three, May next to him for support. Harley stood behind them looking down at his feet, staring at the tears that dripped down his face and hit the wooden boards. Rhodey and Happy&rsquo;s eyes fell onto the six in front of them, hugging each other for support. Steve and Thor stood next to each other, Bruce behind them, all having solemn faces as they watched them float down the lake. Many other people stood behind, from people you had known for most of your life, to a person you&rsquo;ve only met only a day ago. Carol, Nick, and Maria stood the farthest, already missing your bright sarcastic humor they had gotten accustomed to. </p><p>-</p><p>&ldquo;She left this for you,&rdquo; Tony said as he handed Harley a black velvet box. He opened it as Tony turned to Peter, lifting out a necklace that had a heart pendant attached. He opened it seeing a picture of you and him from his graduation. He let out a sad chuckle as he hooked it around his neck looking at it in his palm.</p><p>Peter opened his box, a spider charm and a thunderbolt hanging on a necklace. He smiled softly at it, turning to Harley who had the same expression as him. He looped it around his neck, looking up to the sky and smiling.</p><p>The closest to you sat in the living room of the lakehouse, Pepper, Peter, Harley, Tony, and Morgan sat on the couch, everyone else spread across the other loveseats and benches. </p><p>\u201cUm, is this thing on? I hope it is because if it isn\u2019t this is going to be really awkward to find out it wasn\u2019t,\u201d you paused resting your head on the back of the chair.\u00a0\u201cWell, the only reason you would see this is because I\u2019m gone. Whether it be an untimely death, my stark sacrificing genes or something completely natural and out of fixing.\u201d You hid your face in your arms for a moment.\u00a0\u201cOh god. So as you guys know, I\u2019m terrible at talking so I\u2019ll end up ranting or something. But um, yeah part of the journey is the end y\u2019 know? All just a part of the hero gig.\u201d you repositioned yourself on the chair.\u00a0\u201cI know my journey came up a little short but I know I was going to do it for someone. Maybe, in this case, it was for everyone who\u2019s watching this.\u201d You sat on the ground cross-legged, Morgan sitting across from your hologram.\u00a0\u201cMorgan, I\u2019m sorry I won\u2019t be there for you. But you have some pretty cool aunts and uncles and mom and dad who would be happy to help you with anything, well except first-degree murder cause that\u2019s a no-no. You also have some pretty cool brothers, no I am not admitting that you two are cool you guys are absolute dorks,\u201d they chuckled giving each other a high five.\u00a0\u201cand you also have me. Cause I will always be right here.\u201d You pointed to her heart giving a smile.\u00a0\u201cI love you all 3000.\u201d your hologram reached behind Morgan, stopping the recording.\u00a0</p><p>There was a heavy feeling in the room, some had tears, some had small smiles, some didn\u2019t know what to feel.\u00a0Morgan climbed back onto her dad&rsquo;s lap, tearing up. Steve had walked out, the other slowly dispersing so they could be alone together. All was silent until Harley spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you guys remember at my graduation when she tackled me and ended up breaking her arm?&rdquo; He smiled, looking at the picture in the locket. They laughed softly, smiling at the memory.</p><p>&ldquo;What about when she first tried calamari?&rdquo; They laughed, remembering how you ate most of the plate.</p><p>The rest of the day wasn&rsquo;t spent mourning you. It was spent remembering you.</p><p>Xxx xxX</p><p>A/n; honestly could have ended it better. I\u2019m sorry if I broke your heart, I\u2019m gonna break it again in the next part beautiful things. :(:</p>",

She&rsquo;ll marry the prince, and she&rsquo;ll stay here with Peter, and Peter&hellip;</p><p>It won&rsquo;t be over, Peter realizes. He&rsquo;ll watch his love, watch him love his sister. Watch him have babies with his sister. Watch him forget Peter.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;I stand before you today, the people of my court, to make a wonderful and joyous announcement.&rdquo; Peter starts. May looks at him curiously, pausing her conversation with the prince. &ldquo;Today, I bring the news that my sister is to be married before her 25th birthday, despite my meddling.&rdquo; That earns him several laughs. He looks at his sister, who is now beaming excitedly. &ldquo;Prince Anthony, from the kingdom of Stark, is to take my sister&rsquo;s hand in marriage.&rdquo; He refuses to look at the prince. If he did, he would see only sadness and regret. &ldquo;The wedding is to be after my birthday, and I invite the entire kingdom to bear witness of this beautiful matrimony. Please spread my word to the common people who are not here. That is all.&quot;\u00a0</p><p>Peter hears people start talking excitedly, but he turns his back on them. He hears Tony walking up to him, shouting about thanking the King himself to May. He doesn&rsquo;t stop, he goes to his gardens.\u00a0</p><p>&quot;My King,&rdquo; Tony says softly.\u00a0</p><p>Peter pauses, eyes filling with tears. He turns to Tony, forcing a smile on his face. &ldquo;Prince Tony.&rdquo; he says back.</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t&ndash;this can&rsquo;t be serious,&rdquo; he whispers, stepping closer.</p><p>Peter takes a step back. &ldquo;I have to do this. She loves you, and I know you can love her back. If you just try,&rdquo; he says softly.</p><p>&ldquo;My heart and soul belong to you, my King,&rdquo; Tony says firmly, stepping closer.</p><p>Peter backs into the wall, breath hitching. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t. I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t steal you from her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I never belonged to her!&rdquo; Tony says, voice rising. He takes another step closer, arms on either side of his head. &ldquo;You can not steal something of which has no owner.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter feels more tears fall down his face. &ldquo;Please, don&rsquo;t make this so hard.&rdquo; He whispers. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re hurting me.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony tilts Peter&rsquo;s chin up. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurt. Just say yes to me, just let me love you.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter closes his eyes, breath hiccupping. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s too late now. I can&rsquo;t take it back, I told the entire kingdom.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony pulls back, his own tears falling. &ldquo;But I love you&hellip;&rdquo; He whispers. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t love her. She&rsquo;s wonderful and kind and sweet and beautiful, but she isn&rsquo;t you.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter swallows thickly, shaking his head. &ldquo;You must try to love her. You must move on from me. You cannot hurt her.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony leans forward, pulling Peter&rsquo;s face towards his own and resting their foreheads together, noses touching. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t do this.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter holds Tony&rsquo;s hands to his face, letting himself feel it, for just a moment. It&rsquo;s only a moment. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s already done.&rdquo; He opens his eyes, pushing Tony&rsquo;s hands away and to Tony&rsquo;s chest. &ldquo;You will own my heart until the end of time, my prince, but you must give yours to my sister. She deserves to be happy. More than anyone, she deserves to be happy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you chase her suitors away then? Until now? Why will you let me take her away, but no one else?&rdquo; He asks.\u00a0</p><p>Peter smiles sadly.\u00a0Because she won&rsquo;t be leaving. She&rsquo;ll be here, and so will you.\u00a0&quot;She loves you, like I said. She has never loved anyone before you,&ldquo; he steps around Tony, wiping his tears. &quot;Come, Prince Tony. The part awaits our presence.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony dances with May. May smiles and laughs and blushes. She is happier than Peter can ever remember her being. He cannot, will not, take this away from her.\u00a0</p><p>He retires early, tossing and turning in his chambers. He sneaks out of his room, stalking out into his gardens once again. He goes to his favorite spot; a grassy area under his tree. It&rsquo;s secluded, invisible to anyone who isn&rsquo;t ten feet in front of him. He doesn&rsquo;t expect the prince to be there. &ldquo;Tony?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony startles and looks up, holding up a bottle of wine. &ldquo;I was hoping you would come.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be here anymore. What are you-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please. I&rsquo;m getting married soon, I want your company for as long as I can have it.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter reluctantly sits, taking a sip from the bottle. He hums happily. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the good wine. How did you sneak that out?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I told them the truth. I was going to give it to you.&rdquo; He takes his own sip, sighing softly.\u00a0</p><p>Peter leans into Tony&rsquo;s chest. As they finish the bottle together, they talk endlessly. About everything they can think of. Peter completely regrets it. He&rsquo;s fallen even harder for the prince. He hangs onto every word, every battle story. Every whisper of breath against his ear. His stories are making the young king full of lust. Peter stands when the sun rises, helping the prince up as well. &ldquo;I will see you at breakfast.&rdquo; He whispers, almost as if he doesn&rsquo;t want to disrupt the moment.\u00a0</p><p>Tony leans forward, kissing Peter&rsquo;s cheek softly. &ldquo;Until then, my king.&rdquo; He whispers.\u00a0</p><p>He meets the prince there the next night, and the next, and the next.\u00a0</p><p>On Peter&rsquo;s 18th birthday, he is coronated as the official King, able to make his own decisions for the kingdom. He sets to work on changing laws to get his sister in his place. He has to start small, work his way up. First, he must pass a law citing women have the right to any job a man has the right to. Then he must force his council to listen to reason, to open them up to the idea of women leaders.\u00a0</p><p>It&rsquo;s a long road ahead, and he has much work to do.\u00a0</p><p>He&rsquo;s exhausted, and emotional, and the wedding is set for a month&rsquo;s time.</p><p>Peter starts to go to his chambers. &ldquo;Guards, I want to be left alone. I don&rsquo;t want anyone even in this hall.&rdquo; He says. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to hear.&rdquo; He says. His guards nod and leave the hall. Peter opens his door, falling to his bed. He wants to cry. King&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t cry, he always heard his father said. He misses his father.\u00a0</p><p>He almost screams when a figure comes through his window, but he relaxes when he sees it&rsquo;s just Tony. &ldquo;What on earth-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I saw you come here and not the gardens.&rdquo; He whispers.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;So you decided to come here?&rdquo; Peter asks, eyes wide.</p><p>Tony nods, walking over. &ldquo;I did not want to sleep without you.&rdquo; He whispers. They&rsquo;ve been sleeping together in the gardens these past few nights.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;You must get used to it, my prince. In one month&rsquo;s time, you will be sharing your bed with the princess.&rdquo; Hopefully queen by then.\u00a0</p><p>Tony tears up at the thought. &ldquo;Tonight is your birthday.&rdquo; He says.\u00a0</p><p>Peter swallows thickly and nods. &ldquo;It is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I want to give you a present.&rdquo; Tony whispers.\u00a0</p><p>Peter sits on the bed. &ldquo;I need no presents, I have everything money can buy.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony sits next to him, kissing his forehead. &ldquo;Money can&rsquo;t buy my present for you.&rdquo; He whispers, kissing Peter&rsquo;s nose. He moves his lips to Peter&rsquo;s cheek.</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s breath hitches, feeling himself grow aroused. &ldquo;Tony, my love-&rdquo;</p><p>Tony kisses him. &ldquo;Please.&rdquo; He whispers against Peter&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;Just once. Let me make love to you just once, please. Please, for your birthday. Just the one time.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter cups Tony&rsquo;s cheeks, leaning their foreheads together. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be just once.&rdquo; He whispers, already knowing.</p><p>Tony kisses him again. &ldquo;Please.&rdquo; He whispers so softly against Peter&rsquo;s lips.</p><p>Peter feels like he&rsquo;s on fire.\u00a0</p><p>Tony kisses him every where after disrobing them both. He kisses him and touches him all over and Peter is a trembling, sweaty, crying mess before Tony even pushes inside him.\u00a0</p><p>It hurts at first, but Tony goes slow and he uses so much olive oil Peter will have to come up with a reason as to why his bed sheets are so wet.\u00a0</p><p>Tony makes love to him so sweet and slow, whispering about how much he loves Peter. How he wants to spend the rest of his life with Peter, how he&rsquo;ll never let Peter go.\u00a0</p><p>Peter kisses him, wrapping his legs around Tony&rsquo;s hips. He pants into his mouth, holding Tony close by his cheeks. &ldquo;I love you so much, my prince. I love you, I-&rdquo; He swallows thickly, closing his eyes. &ldquo;Make me finish, I am so aroused it hurts.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony had reached between them, grabbing Peter by his manhood and stroking quickly. Peter had keened, arcing his back and crying as he finished over his stomach.\u00a0</p><p>Tony had finished inside Peter, kissing Peter lovingly.\u00a0</p><p>Peter fell asleep in Tony&rsquo;s arms, and woke up there too.\u00a0</p><p>He also woke with soreness and guilt and regret. How will he possibly watch his sister marry Tony, knowing what it feels like to have Tony inside him? How will he be able to look his sister in the eye, knowing she&rsquo;ll be making love to the prince he loves so much? How will he be able to ever be happy again, knowing Tony will never be his?</p><p>He makes Tony leave through the window like he came in, then washes himself and cries. He is so irreversibly in love with the prince, and the prince loves him just as much. But he&rsquo;ll be marrying his sister, not him.\u00a0</p><p>He gets dressed, and skips breakfast. He has much work to do before the wedding in a month, if he wants to keep his sister here.\u00a0</p>",

He turns to Tony, forcing a smile on his face. \u201cPrince Tony.\u201d he says back.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t\u2013this can\u2019t be serious,\u201d he whispers, stepping closer.</p><p>Peter takes a step back. \u201cI have to do this. She loves you, and I know you can love her back. If you just try,\u201d he says softly.</p><p>\u201cMy heart and soul belong to you, my King,\u201d Tony says firmly, stepping closer.</p><p>Peter backs into the wall, breath hitching. \u201cI can\u2019t. I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t steal you from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never belonged to her!\u201d Tony says, voice rising. He takes another step closer, arms on either side of his head. \u201cYou can not steal something of which has no owner.\u201d</p><p>Peter feels more tears fall down his face. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t make this so hard.\u201d He whispers. \u201cYou\u2019re hurting me.\u201d</p><p>Tony tilts Peter\u2019s chin up. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt. Just say yes to me, just let me love you.\u201d</p><p>Peter closes his eyes, breath hiccupping. \u201cI can\u2019t. It\u2019s too late now. I can\u2019t take it back, I told the entire kingdom.\u201d</p><p>Tony pulls back, his own tears falling. \u201cBut I love you\u2026\u201d He whispers. \u201cI don\u2019t love her. She\u2019s wonderful and kind and sweet and beautiful, but she isn\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>Peter swallows thickly, shaking his head. \u201cYou must try to love her. You must move on from me. You cannot hurt her.\u201d</p><p>Tony leans forward, pulling Peter\u2019s face towards his own and resting their foreheads together, noses touching. \u201cPlease don\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>Peter holds Tony\u2019s hands to his face, letting himself feel it, for just a moment. It\u2019s only a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s already done.\u201d He opens his eyes, pushing Tony\u2019s hands away and to Tony\u2019s chest. \u201cYou will own my heart until the end of time, my prince, but you must give yours to my sister. She deserves to be happy. More than anyone, she deserves to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you chase her suitors away then? Until now? Why will you let me take her away, but no one else?\u201d He asks.\u00a0</p><p>Peter smiles sadly.\u00a0Because she won\u2019t be leaving. She\u2019ll be here, and so will you.\u00a0\"She loves you, like I said. She has never loved anyone before you,\u201c he steps around Tony, wiping his tears. \"Come, Prince Tony. The part awaits our presence.\u201d</p><p>Tony dances with May. May smiles and laughs and blushes. She is happier than Peter can ever remember her being. He cannot, will not, take this away from her.\u00a0</p><p>He retires early, tossing and turning in his chambers. He sneaks out of his room, stalking out into his gardens once again. He goes to his favorite spot; a grassy area under his tree. It\u2019s secluded, invisible to anyone who isn\u2019t ten feet in front of him. He doesn\u2019t expect the prince to be there. \u201cTony?\u201d</p><p>Tony startles and looks up, holding up a bottle of wine. \u201cI was hoping you would come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be here anymore. What are you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. I\u2019m getting married soon, I want your company for as long as I can have it.\u201d</p><p>Peter reluctantly sits, taking a sip from the bottle. He hums happily. \u201cThat\u2019s the good wine. How did you sneak that out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told them the truth. I was going to give it to you.\u201d He takes his own sip, sighing softly.\u00a0</p><p>Peter leans into Tony\u2019s chest. As they finish the bottle together, they talk endlessly. About everything they can think of. Peter completely regrets it. He\u2019s fallen even harder for the prince. He hangs onto every word, every battle story. Every whisper of breath against his ear. His stories are making the young king full of lust. Peter stands when the sun rises, helping the prince up as well. \u201cI will see you at breakfast.\u201d He whispers, almost as if he doesn\u2019t want to disrupt the moment.\u00a0</p><p>Tony leans forward, kissing Peter\u2019s cheek softly. \u201cUntil then, my king.\u201d He whispers.\u00a0</p><p>He meets the prince there the next night, and the next, and the next.\u00a0</p><p>On Peter\u2019s 18th birthday, he is coronated as the official King, able to make his own decisions for the kingdom. He sets to work on changing laws to get his sister in his place. He has to start small, work his way up. First, he must pass a law citing women have the right to any job a man has the right to. Then he must force his council to listen to reason, to open them up to the idea of women leaders.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s a long road ahead, and he has much work to do.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s exhausted, and emotional, and the wedding is set for a month\u2019s time.</p><p>Peter starts to go to his chambers. \u201cGuards, I want to be left alone. I don\u2019t want anyone even in this hall.\u201d He says. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to hear.\u201d He says. His guards nod and leave the hall. Peter opens his door, falling to his bed. He wants to cry. King\u2019s don\u2019t cry, he always heard his father said. He misses his father.\u00a0</p><p>He almost screams when a figure comes through his window, but he relaxes when he sees it\u2019s just Tony. \u201cWhat on earth-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw you come here and not the gardens.\u201d He whispers.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo you decided to come here?\u201d Peter asks, eyes wide.</p><p>Tony nods, walking over. \u201cI did not want to sleep without you.\u201d He whispers. They\u2019ve been sleeping together in the gardens these past few nights.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou must get used to it, my prince. In one month\u2019s time, you will be sharing your bed with the princess.\u201d Hopefully queen by then.\u00a0</p><p>Tony tears up at the thought. \u201cTonight is your birthday.\u201d He says.\u00a0</p><p>Peter swallows thickly and nods. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to give you a present.\u201d Tony whispers.\u00a0</p><p>Peter sits on the bed. \u201cI need no presents, I have everything money can buy.\u201d</p><p>Tony sits next to him, kissing his forehead. \u201cMoney can\u2019t buy my present for you.\u201d He whispers, kissing Peter\u2019s nose. He moves his lips to Peter\u2019s cheek.</p><p>Peter\u2019s breath hitches, feeling himself grow aroused. \u201cTony, my love-\u201d</p><p>Tony kisses him. \u201cPlease.\u201d He whispers against Peter\u2019s lips. \u201cJust once. Let me make love to you just once, please. Please, for your birthday. Just the one time.\u201d</p><p>Peter cups Tony\u2019s cheeks, leaning their foreheads together. \u201cIt won\u2019t be just once.\u201d He whispers, already knowing.</p><p>Tony kisses him again. \u201cPlease.\u201d He whispers so softly against Peter\u2019s lips.</p><p>Peter feels like he\u2019s on fire.\u00a0</p><p>Tony kisses him every where after disrobing them both. He kisses him and touches him all over and Peter is a trembling, sweaty, crying mess before Tony even pushes inside him.\u00a0</p><p>It hurts at first, but Tony goes slow and he uses so much olive oil Peter will have to come up with a reason as to why his bed sheets are so wet.\u00a0</p><p>Tony makes love to him so sweet and slow, whispering about how much he loves Peter. How he wants to spend the rest of his life with Peter, how he\u2019ll never let Peter go.\u00a0</p><p>Peter kisses him, wrapping his legs around Tony\u2019s hips. He pants into his mouth, holding Tony close by his cheeks. \u201cI love you so much, my prince. I love you, I-\u201d He swallows thickly, closing his eyes. \u201cMake me finish, I am so aroused it hurts.\u201d</p><p>Tony had reached between them, grabbing Peter by his manhood and stroking quickly. Peter had keened, arcing his back and crying as he finished over his stomach.\u00a0</p><p>Tony had finished inside Peter, kissing Peter lovingly.\u00a0</p><p>Peter fell asleep in Tony\u2019s arms, and woke up there too.\u00a0</p><p>He also woke with soreness and guilt and regret. How will he possibly watch his sister marry Tony, knowing what it feels like to have Tony inside him? How will he be able to look his sister in the eye, knowing she\u2019ll be making love to the prince he loves so much? How will he be able to ever be happy again, knowing Tony will never be his?</p><p>He makes Tony leave through the window like he came in, then washes himself and cries. He is so irreversibly in love with the prince, and the prince loves him just as much. But he\u2019ll be marrying his sister, not him.\u00a0</p><p>He gets dressed, and skips breakfast. He has much work to do before the wedding in a month, if he wants to keep his sister here.\u00a0</p>",

May looks at him curiously, pausing her conversation with the prince. &ldquo;Today, I bring the news that my sister is to be married before her 25th birthday, despite my meddling.&rdquo; That earns him several laughs. He looks at his sister, who is now beaming excitedly. &ldquo;Prince Anthony, from the kingdom of Stark, is to take my sister&rsquo;s hand in marriage.&rdquo; He refuses to look at the prince. If he did, he would see only sadness and regret. &ldquo;The wedding is to be after my birthday, and I invite the entire kingdom to bear witness of this beautiful matrimony.

You can read them on my A03 or on here @LoveUStylinson. Anyways, I have always been a fan of Marvel movies but it wasn't until i watched Spider-man H that I shipped anyone. That's when I fell down head first into the starker rabbit hole, and alas here I am. Expect some fics soon!

He\u2019d seen the look on the wizard\u2019s face, a look that he didn\u2019t get as often as he should. The look was one that he had only ever seen on the face of the people closest to him, like Pepper who has witnessed all of his lowest moment. <i>Sympathy</i>. And maybe also a little apologetic. </p><p>So he knew. And he planned for what he was certain was coming, though he hoped with all of his heart that it wasn\u2019t true. Tony laid out plans for his funeral - something small, the guest list up to who Pepper decided was worthy. And he wrote up a will that was entrusted in only Happy\u2019s hands. </p><p>When he plans, Tony doesn\u2019t know that the last thought on Pepper\u2019s mind is the <i>guest list</i> of his funeral because she\u2019s too busy trying not to cry. He doesn\u2019t know that Peter - his baby spider, his <i>son</i> - will cry for hours after Happy tells him that Tony has left him the rights to all of his tech and enough money to help him and Aung May live comfortably. Peter almost refuses to spend any of the money because it feels like a trade. Tony for worthless - in Peter\u2019s mind - money. </p><p>Tony couldn\u2019t have possibly known then that the letter he left to Natasha was put on her grave instead of into her hands. The letter would remain forever unopened - along with instructions to watch over his family like she watches over Clint\u2019s falling onto deaf ears. The new shield that he offers Steve - because if ain\u2019t broke it still needs fixing - is appreciated but never used. So is the lab he leaves Bruce. </p><p>There\u2019s more in his will, so much that Happy has a hard time ever finishing the distribution. Eventually, Tony finishes and lays down his pen with a heavy sigh. He doesn\u2019t even look it over, just folds all the paper into an envelope that is sealed for too short an amount of time. </p><p>He spends five years waiting for the moment that his time comes and when Morgan is born, he awaits it with a new sense of dread. And when his old friends show up at his doorstep looking grim as ever, he refuses even though he knows it\u2019s inevitable if the world is to ever be fixed. So he goes. </p><p>And as Tony looks into the eyes of the creature who made him do this, he understands that this is the only way. And so he utters those final words. They\u2019re a random choice, the only thing he hasn\u2019t planned for, and they don\u2019t mean much to anybody he knows - he couldn\u2019t have realized the impact they would truly make - but they mean almost everything to him.  </p><p>\u201cI am Iron Man.\u201d</p><p><i>And an entire world mourns. </i></p>",

Maybe, if he\u2019s lucky, he\u2019ll even have a summer fling, and there\u2019ll be no need to put on the suit safely tucked away underneath a pile of old t-shirts. He isn\u2019t planning on finding Emerson, an old friend, still looking exactly the same as he remembered, and yet so completely different.
