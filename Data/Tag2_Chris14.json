It\u2019s a real mess, I gave up a little bit. If you wanna rewrite the smut pls do - I can\u2019t write smut apparently. What more do you guys want to see? What are you thinking?</p><p><b>Warning:</b> SMUT - do not read if under 18!</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>Chris was right when he said some of the costumes had been ruined. Someone had taken a knife to yours, Seb\u2019s and Chris\u2019 more iconic costumes. The costume department were so apologetic, saying only cast members and stylists had access, they had no idea how someone would have been able to do this. \u00a0</p><p>Of course, the three of you were more worried about increasing their workload than the state of your costumes. No one could figure out why this would ever happen, it\u2019s never even crossed your mind as a possibility. \u00a0</p><p>The next few hours were spent working through all of your costumes with a fine-toothed comb, seeing which had been damaged and which were fine to be put back in their box. By the time you had finished for the night, emotions were running high. It was frustrating to have to restart on some costumes but also worrying and somewhat scary that someone would do such a thing. </p><p>Getting back to the house, it was the early hours of the morning and the overarching emotion was exhaustion. After the long day on set, the adrenaline rush from finally having a moment alone with Chris, and then the emotional rollercoaster of the costume department had left you drained both emotionally and physically. There was no chance of your earlier activities continuing, with both Chris and yourself looking, frankly, awful. Saying goodnight to the boys, you headed upstairs to get ready for bed. \u00a0</p><p>Coming out of the bathroom you bumped into Chris as he came up the stairs. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your suit Chris, I know how attached you are to it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright darling, they seemed to think it could be repaired. I\u2019m sorry about yours though.\u201d Several of your costumes had been shredded, they would need to be fully remade. </p><p>Shaking your head you responded. \u201cI\u2019m more worried about how much time that\u2019s going to take all the people in costume, they\u2019ve enough work without all of this.\u201d </p><p>Chris pulled you in for a hug, head resting on the top of yours. You didn\u2019t want this hug to end, always feeling safer in his arms. You had to say that the destruction of your costumes had shaken you up more than you would like to admit. </p><p>\u201cCan you stay with me tonight?\u201d You squeaked out, your voice close to cracking. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course, I\u2019ll get ready and come straight over to your room okay?\u201d Nodding, you let go of Chris and headed to your room. </p><p>True to his word, Chris was over very quickly, climbing under the covers and pulling you into his arms. Just as the night before, sleep took hold soon after settling into Chris\u2019 arms. \u00a0</p><p>It was intimate, but not in the same way you had experienced before. There was no lust or other intentions behind tonight. It was comforting, Chris made you relax enough to sleep. He was your safety. </p><!-- more --><p>&mdash; </p><p>\u201cIt was him. I know it was.\u201d You announced to Seb, having sat silently next to him for the last ten minutes. </p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWho else could it be? He obviously dislikes me still, and you two were the only ones to be, uh, particularly aggressive with him.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go talk to the Russo\u2019s this afternoon, see if any CCTV has arrived to charge him with.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCharge him?!\u201d </p><p>\u201cCriminal damage.\u201d </p><p>Guilt swirled inside, you began questioning whether it was right to potentially ruin Dave\u2019s job prospects with charges. On the other hand it was unnecessary, aggressive and illegal. Would doing that affect things with Chris though? What would he think of it all? </p><p>Sensing the overwhelming thoughts spiralling, Seb tried to calm you down, turning the conversation towards the blossoming romance. </p><p>\u201cChris would support you in this. It\u2019s no secret that you care for the other, anyone with eyes can see it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd we thought we were being subtle.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot a hope in hell. Anyway, my point is that you shouldn\u2019t let your shitty ex-boyfriends criminal behaviour get in the way of whatever is going on, he\u2019s worried about you and you know he wants the best for you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll chat to him about it at some point.\u201d </p><p>\u201cmhm, go get him.\u201d </p><p>Just as you got up to head to hair and makeup, prepping for your next scene, you spotted Chris wandering around set. </p><p>\u201cFancy going to the gym after work today?\u201d You asked Chris innocently. </p><p>\u201cHmm, any workout you fancy in particular?\u201d Chris mused. </p><p>\u201cMore into a stretching and light sparring mood. Don\u2019t want to overdo it today.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me, anyone else planning on going?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t asked anyone else.\u201d You winked and walked back to your spot at hair and makeup. </p><p>&mdash; </p><p>Your trip to the gym was uneventful, you sparred together for a half hour, followed by an extensive stretching session that Chris led, resulting in more body contact than you had thought legal in public. Getting back to the house, you had a sense of deja vu. \u00a0</p><p>As you headed to the bathroom, once again wrapped in only your towel you noticed Chris in a similar state, leaning against his door frame. </p><p>&ldquo;Fancy saving the environment?\u201d Something in Chris\u2019 voice made you think his intentions had nothing to do with the environment. </p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t dare do anything else.\u201d You smirked up at him. \u00a0</p><p>Chris moved forwards and crashed his lips onto yours, pushing you into the bathroom. The door lazily shut behind you, the temperature in the room rose more than just as a result of the steamy water now noisily flowing in the shower. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cCome on gorgeous, let me see you again.\u201d You couldn\u2019t help but nod to his towel, eyebrow raised as if to say \u2018you first\u2019. </p><p>Ever the gentleman, Chris took the lead, dropping the towel without breaking eye contact, even when your towel dropped shortly after. \u00a0</p><p>Time seemed to slow down, and as if in slow motion Chris reached out to cup your cheek in his palm, your head leaning into him without a second thought. Your eyes fluttered shut as his lips placed a soft kiss on your forehead. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou are so incredible,\u201d Chris whispered. \u00a0</p><p>With this, your eyes opened once more and time came back to full speed. You had to reach out to Chris, not finding the words on your tongue. Pulling him towards you, conveying your emotion in the kiss that followed. \u00a0</p><p>Eventually and without breaking the kiss, you moved into the shower and under the stream of water. Hands were wandering everywhere, lips tracing jaws, necks and collarbones. The noises Chris was making as you brushed against him, leaning up to connect your lips to his again, were addicting. Chris felt the same about the gasps and moans escaping you as he kissed down your neck, pulling your hips towards his. Both trying anything to hear more. </p><p>\u201cSugar, you are driving me wild.\u201d Chris breathed into your ear, voice husky and adding to so many of the feelings you were experiencing. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cTouch me.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Chris\u2019 eyes were darker than you had ever seen, pupils blown wild. A hand dropping down to cup your sex immediately. It was almost shameful, your moan that followed Chris\u2019 movement. </p><p>His fingers rubbing light circles on your clit before slipping in you, pulling a gasp from your lips, fists tightening on both his hair and shoulders. Placing his thumb on your clit once more, he slowly added a second finger. The pleasure was more than you had ever thought possible from something so simple. Connecting your lips with his once more, moaning against him as his fingers curled expertly. </p><p>Releasing your grip on Chris\u2019 hair, you lower a hand, tracing the outline of his body as you went. Hand finally grasping at his erection, you moaned at the feeling of him bucking up against your touch. As your hand worked him, slowly at first, finding what made Chris whisper the filthiest things in your ear, the moans and unfiltered filth was nothing fuel to the fire growing in the pit of your stomach. </p><p>\u201cNeed you.\u201d You mewled into his ear. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI want to make you cum first sugar.\u201d Whilst you loved Chris thinking of your needs first, you needed him more than you cared about chasing your own high. </p><p>\u201cLater, need to feel you in me.\u201d You moaned back, breathlessly. \u00a0</p><p>Chris had stilled, the movement of your hips the only thing keeping you on the edge. Your hands still worked him slowly, not wanting to stop but needing to focus on him. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t last long baby, I can\u2019t give you that once I feel you.\u201d God damn was this man perfect. </p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t your only chance Chris, I want this, I want you if you want me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Chris asked, asking for your consent once more. </p><p>\u201cMore than anything else.\u201d </p><p>Chris didn\u2019t need telling twice. His lips crashed against yours with more passion and lust than before. You kept your grip on his twitching member, pulling it towards your sex. </p><p>The fullness you felt as your two bodies became one for the first time was unlike anything you had ever imagined it being. Chris had pulled one of your legs up and placed in on his hip, allowing him to thrust deeper and deeper. \u00a0</p><p>Your head was thrown back, resting against the wall, loud moans escaping you. You could only hope the noise of the shower and fan would cover the utter porn being created within the bathroom. \u00a0</p><p>Needing to see Chris, you look up through your lashes to see him, muscles tense as he repeatedly thrust into you. Chris was an attractive man normally; with sweat on his brow and muscles glistening with water pouring down around him, mouth agape as he thrust into you, he was godly. Just looking at him helped push you further towards your high. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good, baby.\u201d You purred out, the response almost sob-like as Chris tried not to give into his climax too soon. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t -\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet go.\u201d Chris couldn\u2019t help it, the build-up and interruptions contributing to the overwhelming pleasure he had felt from even the first thrust into you. \u00a0</p><p>He knew his feelings were becoming unavoidable but he could barely function and think whilst buried inside you. Hearing you purr and moan at his actions had him desperate for release and he could hold on no more. </p><p>Still clinging onto Chris as he came down from his high was something you never wanted to end; the feeling of his chest rising and falling against yours was so intimate and reassuring.

I know it was.\u201d You announced to Seb, having sat silently next to him for the last ten minutes. </p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWho else could it be? He obviously dislikes me still, and you two were the only ones to be, uh, particularly aggressive with him.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go talk to the Russo\u2019s this afternoon, see if any CCTV has arrived to charge him with.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCharge him?!\u201d </p><p>\u201cCriminal damage.\u201d </p><p>Guilt swirled inside, you began questioning whether it was right to potentially ruin Dave\u2019s job prospects with charges. On the other hand it was unnecessary, aggressive and illegal. Would doing that affect things with Chris though? What would he think of it all? </p><p>Sensing the overwhelming thoughts spiralling, Seb tried to calm you down, turning the conversation towards the blossoming romance. </p><p>\u201cChris would support you in this. It\u2019s no secret that you care for the other, anyone with eyes can see it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd we thought we were being subtle.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot a hope in hell. Anyway, my point is that you shouldn\u2019t let your shitty ex-boyfriends criminal behaviour get in the way of whatever is going on, he\u2019s worried about you and you know he wants the best for you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll chat to him about it at some point.\u201d </p><p>\u201cmhm, go get him.\u201d </p><p>Just as you got up to head to hair and makeup, prepping for your next scene, you spotted Chris wandering around set. </p><p>\u201cFancy going to the gym after work today?\u201d You asked Chris innocently. </p><p>\u201cHmm, any workout you fancy in particular?\u201d Chris mused. </p><p>\u201cMore into a stretching and light sparring mood. Don\u2019t want to overdo it today.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me, anyone else planning on going?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t asked anyone else.\u201d You winked and walked back to your spot at hair and makeup. </p><p>\u2014 </p><p>Your trip to the gym was uneventful, you sparred together for a half hour, followed by an extensive stretching session that Chris led, resulting in more body contact than you had thought legal in public. Getting back to the house, you had a sense of deja vu. \u00a0</p><p>As you headed to the bathroom, once again wrapped in only your towel you noticed Chris in a similar state, leaning against his door frame. </p><p>\u201cFancy saving the environment?\u201d Something in Chris\u2019 voice made you think his intentions had nothing to do with the environment. </p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t dare do anything else.\u201d You smirked up at him. \u00a0</p><p>Chris moved forwards and crashed his lips onto yours, pushing you into the bathroom. The door lazily shut behind you, the temperature in the room rose more than just as a result of the steamy water now noisily flowing in the shower. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cCome on gorgeous, let me see you again.\u201d You couldn\u2019t help but nod to his towel, eyebrow raised as if to say \u2018you first\u2019. </p><p>Ever the gentleman, Chris took the lead, dropping the towel without breaking eye contact, even when your towel dropped shortly after. \u00a0</p><p>Time seemed to slow down, and as if in slow motion Chris reached out to cup your cheek in his palm, your head leaning into him without a second thought. Your eyes fluttered shut as his lips placed a soft kiss on your forehead. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou are so incredible,\u201d Chris whispered. \u00a0</p><p>With this, your eyes opened once more and time came back to full speed. You had to reach out to Chris, not finding the words on your tongue. Pulling him towards you, conveying your emotion in the kiss that followed. \u00a0</p><p>Eventually and without breaking the kiss, you moved into the shower and under the stream of water. Hands were wandering everywhere, lips tracing jaws, necks and collarbones. The noises Chris was making as you brushed against him, leaning up to connect your lips to his again, were addicting. Chris felt the same about the gasps and moans escaping you as he kissed down your neck, pulling your hips towards his. Both trying anything to hear more. </p><p>\u201cSugar, you are driving me wild.\u201d Chris breathed into your ear, voice husky and adding to so many of the feelings you were experiencing. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cTouch me.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Chris\u2019 eyes were darker than you had ever seen, pupils blown wild. A hand dropping down to cup your sex immediately. It was almost shameful, your moan that followed Chris\u2019 movement. </p><p>His fingers rubbing light circles on your clit before slipping in you, pulling a gasp from your lips, fists tightening on both his hair and shoulders. Placing his thumb on your clit once more, he slowly added a second finger. The pleasure was more than you had ever thought possible from something so simple. Connecting your lips with his once more, moaning against him as his fingers curled expertly. </p><p>Releasing your grip on Chris\u2019 hair, you lower a hand, tracing the outline of his body as you went. Hand finally grasping at his erection, you moaned at the feeling of him bucking up against your touch. As your hand worked him, slowly at first, finding what made Chris whisper the filthiest things in your ear, the moans and unfiltered filth was nothing fuel to the fire growing in the pit of your stomach. </p><p>\u201cNeed you.\u201d You mewled into his ear. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI want to make you cum first sugar.\u201d Whilst you loved Chris thinking of your needs first, you needed him more than you cared about chasing your own high. </p><p>\u201cLater, need to feel you in me.\u201d You moaned back, breathlessly. \u00a0</p><p>Chris had stilled, the movement of your hips the only thing keeping you on the edge. Your hands still worked him slowly, not wanting to stop but needing to focus on him. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t last long baby, I can\u2019t give you that once I feel you.\u201d God damn was this man perfect. </p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t your only chance Chris, I want this, I want you if you want me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Chris asked, asking for your consent once more. </p><p>\u201cMore than anything else.\u201d </p><p>Chris didn\u2019t need telling twice. His lips crashed against yours with more passion and lust than before. You kept your grip on his twitching member, pulling it towards your sex. </p><p>The fullness you felt as your two bodies became one for the first time was unlike anything you had ever imagined it being. Chris had pulled one of your legs up and placed in on his hip, allowing him to thrust deeper and deeper. \u00a0</p><p>Your head was thrown back, resting against the wall, loud moans escaping you. You could only hope the noise of the shower and fan would cover the utter porn being created within the bathroom. \u00a0</p><p>Needing to see Chris, you look up through your lashes to see him, muscles tense as he repeatedly thrust into you. Chris was an attractive man normally; with sweat on his brow and muscles glistening with water pouring down around him, mouth agape as he thrust into you, he was godly. Just looking at him helped push you further towards your high. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good, baby.\u201d You purred out, the response almost sob-like as Chris tried not to give into his climax too soon. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t -\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet go.\u201d Chris couldn\u2019t help it, the build-up and interruptions contributing to the overwhelming pleasure he had felt from even the first thrust into you. \u00a0</p><p>He knew his feelings were becoming unavoidable but he could barely function and think whilst buried inside you. Hearing you purr and moan at his actions had him desperate for release and he could hold on no more. </p><p>Still clinging onto Chris as he came down from his high was something you never wanted to end; the feeling of his chest rising and falling against yours was so intimate and reassuring. The peppered kisses wherever his lips could reach left sparked the fire that was only just being tamed. The soft kiss shared after you finally looked the other in the eye again, said everything that needed to be. </p><p>Eventually, you broke apart, becoming two bodies once more. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think we saved much water.\u201d Chris joked, his eyes soft and warm \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo I don\u2019t think we did, I do know a way to warm us up that will genuinely save some energy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLead the way, my hero\u201d Chris winked, his arm gesturing to the door.\u00a0</p><p>\u2014</p><p><b>Story Tag list: </b><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcLOYJeBTusyWsPGyNkB5yw\" target=\"_blank\">@dsakita</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg-4osze2vpDLniSin6j2Hg\" target=\"_blank\">@i-just-wanna-live-gc</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXBgOf5a5jAb6kqjciZlfqg\" target=\"_blank\">@dlb113</a> @greyeyedowl01\u00a0\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbMjLzeZOiw097UfkLMIxIw\" target=\"_blank\">@coffeebooksandfandom</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLol1OcHL2rmi9B4PNj0NWQ\" target=\"_blank\">@torntaltos</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3CsTvSzu7Bm9Ac_fPn0U2g\" target=\"_blank\">@captainsherlockwinchester110283</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmLMnPRszQHTeVcAqL5Wodg\" target=\"_blank\">@socially-awkward101</a> @humandasater <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1pE6jnNBtu9vWUBTI4EjMQ\" target=\"_blank\">@fanfic-hypewomen</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-Q3kbVsZuib76SEphChmLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@evanstush</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVEwhn86ayxflqwPeR-9EMA\" target=\"_blank\">@mother-dearest-loves-me</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBb4kX5ZjREpJq2bNqumg4g\" target=\"_blank\">@ajosieface</a><br></p>",

It\u2019s a real mess, I gave up a little bit. If you wanna rewrite the smut pls do - I can\u2019t write smut apparently. What more do you guys want to see? What are you thinking?</p><p><b>Warning:</b> SMUT - do not read if under 18!</p><p>\u2014</p><p>Chris was right when he said some of the costumes had been ruined. Someone had taken a knife to yours, Seb\u2019s and Chris\u2019 more iconic costumes. The costume department were so apologetic, saying only cast members and stylists had access, they had no idea how someone would have been able to do this. \u00a0</p><p>Of course, the three of you were more worried about increasing their workload than the state of your costumes. No one could figure out why this would ever happen, it\u2019s never even crossed your mind as a possibility. \u00a0</p><p>The next few hours were spent working through all of your costumes with a fine-toothed comb, seeing which had been damaged and which were fine to be put back in their box. By the time you had finished for the night, emotions were running high. It was frustrating to have to restart on some costumes but also worrying and somewhat scary that someone would do such a thing. </p><p>Getting back to the house, it was the early hours of the morning and the overarching emotion was exhaustion. After the long day on set, the adrenaline rush from finally having a moment alone with Chris, and then the emotional rollercoaster of the costume department had left you drained both emotionally and physically. There was no chance of your earlier activities continuing, with both Chris and yourself looking, frankly, awful. Saying goodnight to the boys, you headed upstairs to get ready for bed. \u00a0</p><p>Coming out of the bathroom you bumped into Chris as he came up the stairs. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your suit Chris, I know how attached you are to it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright darling, they seemed to think it could be repaired. I\u2019m sorry about yours though.\u201d Several of your costumes had been shredded, they would need to be fully remade. </p><p>Shaking your head you responded. \u201cI\u2019m more worried about how much time that\u2019s going to take all the people in costume, they\u2019ve enough work without all of this.\u201d </p><p>Chris pulled you in for a hug, head resting on the top of yours. You didn\u2019t want this hug to end, always feeling safer in his arms. You had to say that the destruction of your costumes had shaken you up more than you would like to admit. </p><p>\u201cCan you stay with me tonight?\u201d You squeaked out, your voice close to cracking. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course, I\u2019ll get ready and come straight over to your room okay?\u201d Nodding, you let go of Chris and headed to your room. </p><p>True to his word, Chris was over very quickly, climbing under the covers and pulling you into his arms. Just as the night before, sleep took hold soon after settling into Chris\u2019 arms. \u00a0</p><p>It was intimate, but not in the same way you had experienced before. There was no lust or other intentions behind tonight. It was comforting, Chris made you relax enough to sleep. He was your safety. </p>[[MORE]]<p>\u2014 </p><p>\u201cIt was him. I know it was.\u201d You announced to Seb, having sat silently next to him for the last ten minutes. </p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWho else could it be? He obviously dislikes me still, and you two were the only ones to be, uh, particularly aggressive with him.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go talk to the Russo\u2019s this afternoon, see if any CCTV has arrived to charge him with.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCharge him?!\u201d </p><p>\u201cCriminal damage.\u201d </p><p>Guilt swirled inside, you began questioning whether it was right to potentially ruin Dave\u2019s job prospects with charges. On the other hand it was unnecessary, aggressive and illegal. Would doing that affect things with Chris though? What would he think of it all? </p><p>Sensing the overwhelming thoughts spiralling, Seb tried to calm you down, turning the conversation towards the blossoming romance. </p><p>\u201cChris would support you in this. It\u2019s no secret that you care for the other, anyone with eyes can see it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd we thought we were being subtle.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot a hope in hell. Anyway, my point is that you shouldn\u2019t let your shitty ex-boyfriends criminal behaviour get in the way of whatever is going on, he\u2019s worried about you and you know he wants the best for you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll chat to him about it at some point.\u201d </p><p>\u201cmhm, go get him.\u201d </p><p>Just as you got up to head to hair and makeup, prepping for your next scene, you spotted Chris wandering around set. </p><p>\u201cFancy going to the gym after work today?\u201d You asked Chris innocently. </p><p>\u201cHmm, any workout you fancy in particular?\u201d Chris mused. </p><p>\u201cMore into a stretching and light sparring mood. Don\u2019t want to overdo it today.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me, anyone else planning on going?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t asked anyone else.\u201d You winked and walked back to your spot at hair and makeup. </p><p>\u2014 </p><p>Your trip to the gym was uneventful, you sparred together for a half hour, followed by an extensive stretching session that Chris led, resulting in more body contact than you had thought legal in public. Getting back to the house, you had a sense of deja vu. \u00a0</p><p>As you headed to the bathroom, once again wrapped in only your towel you noticed Chris in a similar state, leaning against his door frame. </p><p>\u201cFancy saving the environment?\u201d Something in Chris\u2019 voice made you think his intentions had nothing to do with the environment. </p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t dare do anything else.\u201d You smirked up at him. \u00a0</p><p>Chris moved forwards and crashed his lips onto yours, pushing you into the bathroom. The door lazily shut behind you, the temperature in the room rose more than just as a result of the steamy water now noisily flowing in the shower. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cCome on gorgeous, let me see you again.\u201d You couldn\u2019t help but nod to his towel, eyebrow raised as if to say \u2018you first\u2019. </p><p>Ever the gentleman, Chris took the lead, dropping the towel without breaking eye contact, even when your towel dropped shortly after. \u00a0</p><p>Time seemed to slow down, and as if in slow motion Chris reached out to cup your cheek in his palm, your head leaning into him without a second thought. Your eyes fluttered shut as his lips placed a soft kiss on your forehead. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou are so incredible,\u201d Chris whispered. \u00a0</p><p>With this, your eyes opened once more and time came back to full speed. You had to reach out to Chris, not finding the words on your tongue. Pulling him towards you, conveying your emotion in the kiss that followed. \u00a0</p><p>Eventually and without breaking the kiss, you moved into the shower and under the stream of water. Hands were wandering everywhere, lips tracing jaws, necks and collarbones. The noises Chris was making as you brushed against him, leaning up to connect your lips to his again, were addicting. Chris felt the same about the gasps and moans escaping you as he kissed down your neck, pulling your hips towards his. Both trying anything to hear more. </p><p>\u201cSugar, you are driving me wild.\u201d Chris breathed into your ear, voice husky and adding to so many of the feelings you were experiencing. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cTouch me.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Chris\u2019 eyes were darker than you had ever seen, pupils blown wild. A hand dropping down to cup your sex immediately. It was almost shameful, your moan that followed Chris\u2019 movement. </p><p>His fingers rubbing light circles on your clit before slipping in you, pulling a gasp from your lips, fists tightening on both his hair and shoulders. Placing his thumb on your clit once more, he slowly added a second finger. The pleasure was more than you had ever thought possible from something so simple. Connecting your lips with his once more, moaning against him as his fingers curled expertly. </p><p>Releasing your grip on Chris\u2019 hair, you lower a hand, tracing the outline of his body as you went. Hand finally grasping at his erection, you moaned at the feeling of him bucking up against your touch. As your hand worked him, slowly at first, finding what made Chris whisper the filthiest things in your ear, the moans and unfiltered filth was nothing fuel to the fire growing in the pit of your stomach. </p><p>\u201cNeed you.\u201d You mewled into his ear. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI want to make you cum first sugar.\u201d Whilst you loved Chris thinking of your needs first, you needed him more than you cared about chasing your own high. </p><p>\u201cLater, need to feel you in me.\u201d You moaned back, breathlessly. \u00a0</p><p>Chris had stilled, the movement of your hips the only thing keeping you on the edge. Your hands still worked him slowly, not wanting to stop but needing to focus on him. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t last long baby, I can\u2019t give you that once I feel you.\u201d God damn was this man perfect. </p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t your only chance Chris, I want this, I want you if you want me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Chris asked, asking for your consent once more. </p><p>\u201cMore than anything else.\u201d </p><p>Chris didn\u2019t need telling twice. His lips crashed against yours with more passion and lust than before. You kept your grip on his twitching member, pulling it towards your sex. </p><p>The fullness you felt as your two bodies became one for the first time was unlike anything you had ever imagined it being. Chris had pulled one of your legs up and placed in on his hip, allowing him to thrust deeper and deeper. \u00a0</p><p>Your head was thrown back, resting against the wall, loud moans escaping you. You could only hope the noise of the shower and fan would cover the utter porn being created within the bathroom. \u00a0</p><p>Needing to see Chris, you look up through your lashes to see him, muscles tense as he repeatedly thrust into you. Chris was an attractive man normally; with sweat on his brow and muscles glistening with water pouring down around him, mouth agape as he thrust into you, he was godly. Just looking at him helped push you further towards your high. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good, baby.\u201d You purred out, the response almost sob-like as Chris tried not to give into his climax too soon. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t -\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet go.\u201d Chris couldn\u2019t help it, the build-up and interruptions contributing to the overwhelming pleasure he had felt from even the first thrust into you. \u00a0</p><p>He knew his feelings were becoming unavoidable but he could barely function and think whilst buried inside you. Hearing you purr and moan at his actions had him desperate for release and he could hold on no more. </p><p>Still clinging onto Chris as he came down from his high was something you never wanted to end; the feeling of his chest rising and falling against yours was so intimate and reassuring. The peppered kisses wherever his lips could reach left sparked the fire that was only just being tamed. The soft kiss shared after you finally looked the other in the eye again, said everything that needed to be. </p><p>Eventually, you broke apart, becoming two bodies once more. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think we saved much water.\u201d Chris joked, his eyes soft and warm \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo I don\u2019t think we did, I do know a way to warm us up that will genuinely save some energy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLead the way, my hero\u201d Chris winked, his arm gesturing to the door.\u00a0</p><p>\u2014</p><p><b>Story Tag list: </b><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcLOYJeBTusyWsPGyNkB5yw\" target=\"_blank\">@dsakita</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg-4osze2vpDLniSin6j2Hg\" target=\"_blank\">@i-just-wanna-live-gc</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXBgOf5a5jAb6kqjciZlfqg\" target=\"_blank\">@dlb113</a> @greyeyedowl01\u00a0\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbMjLzeZOiw097UfkLMIxIw\" target=\"_blank\">@coffeebooksandfandom</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLol1OcHL2rmi9B4PNj0NWQ\" target=\"_blank\">@torntaltos</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3CsTvSzu7Bm9Ac_fPn0U2g\" target=\"_blank\">@captainsherlockwinchester110283</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmLMnPRszQHTeVcAqL5Wodg\" target=\"_blank\">@socially-awkward101</a> @humandasater <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1pE6jnNBtu9vWUBTI4EjMQ\" target=\"_blank\">@fanfic-hypewomen</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-Q3kbVsZuib76SEphChmLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@evanstush</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVEwhn86ayxflqwPeR-9EMA\" target=\"_blank\">@mother-dearest-loves-me</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBb4kX5ZjREpJq2bNqumg4g\" target=\"_blank\">@ajosieface</a><br></p>",

The soft kiss shared after you finally looked the other in the eye again, said everything that needed to be. </p><p>Eventually, you broke apart, becoming two bodies once more. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think we saved much water.&rdquo; Chris joked, his eyes soft and warm &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;No I don&rsquo;t think we did, I do know a way to warm us up that will genuinely save some energy.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Lead the way, my hero&rdquo; Chris winked, his arm gesturing to the door.&nbsp;</p><p>&mdash;</p><p><b>Story Tag list: </b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcLOYJeBTusyWsPGyNkB5yw\" target=\"_blank\">@dsakita</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg-4osze2vpDLniSin6j2Hg\" target=\"_blank\">@i-just-wanna-live-gc</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXBgOf5a5jAb6kqjciZlfqg\" target=\"_blank\">@dlb113</a> @greyeyedowl01&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbMjLzeZOiw097UfkLMIxIw\" target=\"_blank\">@coffeebooksandfandom</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLol1OcHL2rmi9B4PNj0NWQ\" target=\"_blank\">@torntaltos</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3CsTvSzu7Bm9Ac_fPn0U2g\" target=\"_blank\">@captainsherlockwinchester110283</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmLMnPRszQHTeVcAqL5Wodg\" target=\"_blank\">@socially-awkward101</a> @humandasater <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1pE6jnNBtu9vWUBTI4EjMQ\" target=\"_blank\">@fanfic-hypewomen</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-Q3kbVsZuib76SEphChmLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@evanstush</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVEwhn86ayxflqwPeR-9EMA\" target=\"_blank\">@mother-dearest-loves-me</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBb4kX5ZjREpJq2bNqumg4g\" target=\"_blank\">@ajosieface</a><br /></p>",

It&rsquo;s a real mess, I gave up a little bit. If you wanna rewrite the smut pls do - I can&rsquo;t write smut apparently. What more do you guys want to see? What are you thinking?</p>\n<p><b>Warning:</b> SMUT - do not read if under 18!</p>\n<p>&mdash;</p>\n<p>Chris was right when he said some of the costumes had been ruined. Someone had taken a knife to yours, Seb&rsquo;s and Chris&rsquo; more iconic costumes. The costume department were so apologetic, saying only cast members and stylists had access, they had no idea how someone would have been able to do this. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Of course, the three of you were more worried about increasing their workload than the state of your costumes. No one could figure out why this would ever happen, it&rsquo;s never even crossed your mind as a possibility. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The next few hours were spent working through all of your costumes with a fine-toothed comb, seeing which had been damaged and which were fine to be put back in their box. By the time you had finished for the night, emotions were running high. It was frustrating to have to restart on some costumes but also worrying and somewhat scary that someone would do such a thing. </p>\n<p>Getting back to the house, it was the early hours of the morning and the overarching emotion was exhaustion. After the long day on set, the adrenaline rush from finally having a moment alone with Chris, and then the emotional rollercoaster of the costume department had left you drained both emotionally and physically. There was no chance of your earlier activities continuing, with both Chris and yourself looking, frankly, awful. Saying goodnight to the boys, you headed upstairs to get ready for bed. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Coming out of the bathroom you bumped into Chris as he came up the stairs. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about your suit Chris, I know how attached you are to it.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright darling, they seemed to think it could be repaired. I&rsquo;m sorry about yours though.&rdquo; Several of your costumes had been shredded, they would need to be fully remade. </p>\n<p>Shaking your head you responded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m more worried about how much time that&rsquo;s going to take all the people in costume, they&rsquo;ve enough work without all of this.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>Chris pulled you in for a hug, head resting on the top of yours. You didn&rsquo;t want this hug to end, always feeling safer in his arms. You had to say that the destruction of your costumes had shaken you up more than you would like to admit. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Can you stay with me tonight?&rdquo; You squeaked out, your voice close to cracking. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;ll get ready and come straight over to your room okay?&rdquo; Nodding, you let go of Chris and headed to your room. </p>\n<p>True to his word, Chris was over very quickly, climbing under the covers and pulling you into his arms. Just as the night before, sleep took hold soon after settling into Chris&rsquo; arms. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was intimate, but not in the same way you had experienced before. There was no lust or other intentions behind tonight. It was comforting, Chris made you relax enough to sleep. He was your safety. </p>\n</p>",

I don\u2019t even know who\u2019s worse,\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAn unstoppable team for sure,\u201d Sebastian agreed and closed his eyes as he realised how worn out Dodger and Mya had made him.</p><p>Between chasing the small human being and the pet all day (as he had volunteered to look after them whilst Chris went for his production meeting), he\u2019d gotten his week\u2019s worth of a work out for sure.</p><p>\u201cGotta give you a bath missy,\u201d Chris said scooping up his daughter, Mya, off the floor from her Lego brick building and onto his lap, giving her a forehead kiss. \u201cAnd wash your hair&hellip;what are we gonna do with your hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo baff-time,\u201d she shook her head at her dad, pouting her lips as she pleaded.</p><p>\u201cNo bath? What if daddy puts in lots of bubbles in the tub?\u201d</p><p>Mya covered her face with her hands and buried her face in his chest, her \u2018no\u2019 coming out muffled.</p><p>\u201cAnd then bedtime story?\u201d</p><p>Still a no.</p><p>\u201cWe can watch <i>Curious George</i> after?\u201d</p><p>Mya considered this momentarily; internally bargaining with herself, that maybe she could compromise on the bath in order to stay up longer to watch <i>Curious George</i> on the iPad with her dad and Dodger. Even better, she could throw in a request for uncle Sebastian to join in. Then thought against it, <i>Curious George </i>wasn\u2019t worth it, she hated bath time. She shook her head again pulling away from Chris and looked up at him with the saddest face she could muster.</p><p> \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt my hair,\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes daddy hurt your hair?\u201d Chris asked softly, she nodded. He looked at her apologetically, pulling her back into another hug, this time kissing the top of her curls. \u201cAaaw no bubba, daddy doesn\u2019t mean to hurt your hair. You want uncle Sebastian to do your hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Sebastian protested. \u201cMy babysitting shift is over, that\u2019s on you. I do the nice things, I\u2019m not going to make her cry after the good day we had,\u201d</p><p>Chris rolled his eyes at his unhelpful friend, \u201cOkay, bubba, you gotta have a bath though. I won\u2019t do your hair. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd bedtime stowee?\u201d She bargained.</p><p>\u201cAnd bedtime story,\u201d Chris confirmed, patting her back gently before planting her back on the floor and standing up to stretch. \u201cYou need to tidy up the Lego first,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to head off,\u201d Sebastian announced, even though he looked as though he had no single ounce of intention to get up anytime soon. \u201cI got a date,\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, a date?\u201d Chris said, caught off-guard mid-stretch.</p><p>Seb huffed, \u201cI knew you\u2019d have something to say. I wasn\u2019t going to even tell you,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d Chris commented innocently.</p><p>\u201cYeah but your tone said enough. I\u2019m single now. I can go on dates,\u201d he argued defensively.</p><p>Chris said carefully, \u201cIsn\u2019t it still fresh Seb?\u201d</p><p>Sebastian shrugged and immediately avoided eye contact because he knew Chris was right and his intentions pure. But that\u2019s not what he needed right now; he needed Chris to co-sign the idea of him going on rebound dates to speed up the healing process of a heartbreak.</p><p>\u201cNot for me, maybe for <i>her </i>but she\u2019s history, I couldn\u2019t care less.\u201d</p><p>Chris opened his mouth to speak and then stopped himself, \u201cY\u2019know what, you\u2019re right, whatever makes you happy\u2026just don\u2019t hurt anyone else along the way,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need my friend Chris Evans on this, not Steve Rogers, please?\u201d Sebastian\u2019s eyebrows furrowed.</p><p>Chris nodded in agreement, \u201cSure, I\u2019m sorry. You got it man. So are you going out looking like that though? You look like death,\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because of your kid and Dodger,\u201d Sebastian retorted with a playful middle finger that Mya missed because she was busy fighting Dodger for a Lego piece. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re so up in my love life, y\u2019gotta get back out there as well man,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, I have responsibilities. I don\u2019t have the time and I\u2019m not interested,\u201d defensive as always whenever the topic came up, Chris rolled his eyes and folded his arms in front of his chest.</p><p>\u201cI get that,\u201d Sebastian commented, nodding pointedly at Mya, acknowledging Chris\u2019 commitment. \u201cBut your life can\u2019t be all about scripts and her, \u201d</p><p>Chris bit his bottom lip and looked at his daughter, considering Sebastian\u2019s words. Had he been too engrossed in scripts and his daughter? And was that such a bad thing to prioritise her and career? He had been doing it for so long he had never stopped to think about it in depth, and often when someone had brought it up, he would dismiss it. Especially if it came from a childless friend; writing off their lack of experience.\u00a0</p><p>As if Mya knew she was the topic of conversation, she locked eyes with her dad as she carried the toys to their designated spot, flashing him a gapy smile. His heart melted.</p><p>\u201cWe are fine Seb,\u201d Chris smiled back at her.</p><p>\u201cWe are fine,\u201d she echoed mindlessly.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I won\u2019t push it tonight, not in front of her, but y\u2019know&hellip;it won\u2019t hurt to have someone around. It\u2019d be good for her too, to have a female figure around. Plus, you need to get laid,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat <i>laid</i> mean?\u201d Mya asked inquisitively.</p><p>Sebastian pinched the bridge of his nose; Chris\u2019 grimace turned into laughter as and then said, \u201cIt means, uncle Seb has to go now. Say bye, baby,\u201d</p><p>Mya ran over to Seb, hugging him and cupping his bearded face as he told her that he had thoroughly enjoyed spending the day with her and Dodger, and how he couldn\u2019t wait to have her come over again to his apartment, so she could finish the drawing on his wall with her colouring pens. She laughed shyly and hid her face in her tiny hands; Chris didn\u2019t intervene to tell her off \u2013 that was between them, if Sebastian wanted to be the good cop, that was his prerogative.</p><p>Seb stood up with the girl in his arms, transferring her into her dad\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow princess,\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow?\u201d Chris asked, confused.</p><p>\u201cYes, tomorrow, she and I have an ice cream date, I promised her,\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when do you make plans with my daughter without telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince she called me <i>\u2018the best person in the whole wide world</i>\u2019\u201d Sebastian slapped a hand on Chris\u2019 shoulder. \u201cWhat can I say? Your daughter has taste,\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come anywhere near my daughter,\u201d Chris joked.</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow,\u201d Sebastian ignored Chris\u2019 protest, ruffled Mya\u2019s hair and left the family to their devices.</p><p>\u201cI see uncle Sebastian\u2019s your favourite person in the whole world, I thought it was daddy?\u201d Chris feigned sadness, pouting his lip at Mya.</p><p>She giggled, and kissed his cheek, \u201cNo silly, \u2018<i>your\u2019</i> my favourite,\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood! I <i>am</i> your favourite, I should be. Hear that Dodger? I\u2019m her favourite.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p><a href=\"https://chrisevansbabymama.tumblr.com/post/185868765896/daddy-hair-care-chapter-2\">Chapter 2</a></p><p>_______________</p><p><b>Disclaimer: </b>Image Not My Own</p><p><b>Tagged As Requested: </b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maLh-Z_n-WYz5Bi4f6bAp6A\">@mississippifangirl</a></p>",

I don\u2019t even know who\u2019s worse,\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAn unstoppable team for sure,\u201d Sebastian agreed and closed his eyes as he realised how worn out Dodger and Mya had made him.</p><p>Between chasing the small human being and the pet all day (as he had volunteered to look after them whilst Chris went for his production meeting), he\u2019d gotten his week\u2019s worth of a work out for sure.</p><p>\u201cGotta give you a bath missy,\u201d Chris said scooping up his daughter, Mya, off the floor from her Lego brick building and onto his lap, giving her a forehead kiss. \u201cAnd wash your hair\u2026what are we gonna do with your hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo baff-time,\u201d she shook her head at her dad, pouting her lips as she pleaded.</p><p>\u201cNo bath? What if daddy puts in lots of bubbles in the tub?\u201d</p><p>Mya covered her face with her hands and buried her face in his chest, her \u2018no\u2019 coming out muffled.</p><p>\u201cAnd then bedtime story?\u201d</p><p>Still a no.</p><p>\u201cWe can watch <i>Curious George</i> after?\u201d</p><p>Mya considered this momentarily; internally bargaining with herself, that maybe she could compromise on the bath in order to stay up longer to watch <i>Curious George</i> on the iPad with her dad and Dodger. Even better, she could throw in a request for uncle Sebastian to join in. Then thought against it, <i>Curious George </i>wasn\u2019t worth it, she hated bath time. She shook her head again pulling away from Chris and looked up at him with the saddest face she could muster.</p><p> \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt my hair,\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes daddy hurt your hair?\u201d Chris asked softly, she nodded. He looked at her apologetically, pulling her back into another hug, this time kissing the top of her curls. \u201cAaaw no bubba, daddy doesn\u2019t mean to hurt your hair. You want uncle Sebastian to do your hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Sebastian protested. \u201cMy babysitting shift is over, that\u2019s on you. I do the nice things, I\u2019m not going to make her cry after the good day we had,\u201d</p><p>Chris rolled his eyes at his unhelpful friend, \u201cOkay, bubba, you gotta have a bath though. I won\u2019t do your hair. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd bedtime stowee?\u201d She bargained.</p><p>\u201cAnd bedtime story,\u201d Chris confirmed, patting her back gently before planting her back on the floor and standing up to stretch. \u201cYou need to tidy up the Lego first,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to head off,\u201d Sebastian announced, even though he looked as though he had no single ounce of intention to get up anytime soon. \u201cI got a date,\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, a date?\u201d Chris said, caught off-guard mid-stretch.</p><p>Seb huffed, \u201cI knew you\u2019d have something to say. I wasn\u2019t going to even tell you,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d Chris commented innocently.</p><p>\u201cYeah but your tone said enough. I\u2019m single now. I can go on dates,\u201d he argued defensively.</p><p>Chris said carefully, \u201cIsn\u2019t it still fresh Seb?\u201d</p><p>Sebastian shrugged and immediately avoided eye contact because he knew Chris was right and his intentions pure. But that\u2019s not what he needed right now; he needed Chris to co-sign the idea of him going on rebound dates to speed up the healing process of a heartbreak.</p><p>\u201cNot for me, maybe for <i>her </i>but she\u2019s history, I couldn\u2019t care less.\u201d</p><p>Chris opened his mouth to speak and then stopped himself, \u201cY\u2019know what, you\u2019re right, whatever makes you happy\u2026just don\u2019t hurt anyone else along the way,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need my friend Chris Evans on this, not Steve Rogers, please?\u201d Sebastian\u2019s eyebrows furrowed.</p><p>Chris nodded in agreement, \u201cSure, I\u2019m sorry. You got it man. So are you going out looking like that though? You look like death,\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because of your kid and Dodger,\u201d Sebastian retorted with a playful middle finger that Mya missed because she was busy fighting Dodger for a Lego piece. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re so up in my love life, y\u2019gotta get back out there as well man,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, I have responsibilities. I don\u2019t have the time and I\u2019m not interested,\u201d defensive as always whenever the topic came up, Chris rolled his eyes and folded his arms in front of his chest.</p><p>\u201cI get that,\u201d Sebastian commented, nodding pointedly at Mya, acknowledging Chris\u2019 commitment. \u201cBut your life can\u2019t be all about scripts and her, \u201d</p><p>Chris bit his bottom lip and looked at his daughter, considering Sebastian\u2019s words. Had he been too engrossed in scripts and his daughter? And was that such a bad thing to prioritise her and career? He had been doing it for so long he had never stopped to think about it in depth, and often when someone had brought it up, he would dismiss it. Especially if it came from a childless friend; writing off their lack of experience.\u00a0</p><p>As if Mya knew she was the topic of conversation, she locked eyes with her dad as she carried the toys to their designated spot, flashing him a gapy smile. His heart melted.</p><p>\u201cWe are fine Seb,\u201d Chris smiled back at her.</p><p>\u201cWe are fine,\u201d she echoed mindlessly.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I won\u2019t push it tonight, not in front of her, but y\u2019know\u2026it won\u2019t hurt to have someone around. It\u2019d be good for her too, to have a female figure around. Plus, you need to get laid,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat <i>laid</i> mean?\u201d Mya asked inquisitively.</p><p>Sebastian pinched the bridge of his nose; Chris\u2019 grimace turned into laughter as and then said, \u201cIt means, uncle Seb has to go now. Say bye, baby,\u201d</p><p>Mya ran over to Seb, hugging him and cupping his bearded face as he told her that he had thoroughly enjoyed spending the day with her and Dodger, and how he couldn\u2019t wait to have her come over again to his apartment, so she could finish the drawing on his wall with her colouring pens. She laughed shyly and hid her face in her tiny hands; Chris didn\u2019t intervene to tell her off \u2013 that was between them, if Sebastian wanted to be the good cop, that was his prerogative.</p><p>Seb stood up with the girl in his arms, transferring her into her dad\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow princess,\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow?\u201d Chris asked, confused.</p><p>\u201cYes, tomorrow, she and I have an ice cream date, I promised her,\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when do you make plans with my daughter without telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince she called me <i>\u2018the best person in the whole wide world</i>\u2019\u201d Sebastian slapped a hand on Chris\u2019 shoulder. \u201cWhat can I say? Your daughter has taste,\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come anywhere near my daughter,\u201d Chris joked.</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow,\u201d Sebastian ignored Chris\u2019 protest, ruffled Mya\u2019s hair and left the family to their devices.</p><p>\u201cI see uncle Sebastian\u2019s your favourite person in the whole world, I thought it was daddy?\u201d Chris feigned sadness, pouting his lip at Mya.</p><p>She giggled, and kissed his cheek, \u201cNo silly, \u2018<i>your\u2019</i> my favourite,\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood!

It didn&rsquo;t worked, not even the cold wind could drop the hotness off his face. Suddenly he felt his phone vibrate in his pocket. He knew it was you and had no intention to pick it up. He let the call go to voicemail. Calling a cab, he checked his pockets if he had any change to pay the driver and his eyes caught a glimpse on his screen phone. A surprised expression caught his features. It wasn&rsquo;t your number but an unknown one. He pressed play on the voice mail and his eyes went wide after he heard the message. &ldquo;She did what??&rdquo;, he told himself after replaying it several times until the driver caught his attention. &ldquo;Yeah sorry&rdquo;, said Chris. He gave the driver the address and arrived 10 minutes later. At the counter, he asked for you. &ldquo;Name?&rdquo;, replied the man in front of him. &ldquo;Y/N /YL/N&rdquo;. The man checked his computer and chuckled. &ldquo;Yeah she&rsquo;s here.&rdquo; &ldquo;Can I see her&rdquo;, asked Chris. &ldquo;Only close family.&rdquo; &ldquo;Look you called me ok and I&rsquo;m- I&rsquo;m her boyfriend&rdquo;, his voice cracked. &ldquo;Follow me&rdquo;, the man instructed. He led Chris to your cell and saw you crunched on the corner. &ldquo;ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?&rdquo;, Chris voice filled the police station, scaring you. </p><p>Your makeup smudged and your bruised hand on display were the least of your worries at the moment and you stood up like a fury. &ldquo;ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? You left me there, not even giving me the chance to explain myself and now you dare say I&rsquo;m loosing my shit. Fuck you Chris, fuck you. I never did anything to make you doubt of my feelings. Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry that I&rsquo;m only human and couldn&rsquo;t figure out it wasn\u2019t you&rdquo;, you counterattacked getting everyone&rsquo;s attention, your voice increasing. </p><p>Chris sighed heavily, rubbing his face like if he could just rub off his frustrations right on the spot. You paced back and forth on the tiny cell and exclaimed emotionally, &ldquo;I love you from the bottom of my heart. I would never do anything to compromise and lose what makes me happy. It hurts me that you even consider that I would do such a thing.&rdquo; He stood there watching at you, tears welled up his eyes, not knowing what to do. &ldquo;I - I&rsquo;m sorry, I thought. It drove me insane seeing him all over you. I should have let you explain yourself instead of bursting out like that. I&rsquo;m so sorr-&rdquo; &ldquo;I know, I&rsquo;m sorry too if I gave you the impression that you weren&rsquo;t the only one.&rdquo; Chris craved you, to feel you against him. He went to the nearest police officer and asked him how much was the caution to get you released. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Sir but considering that she has alcohol in her blood and that she broke a glass on a man&rsquo;s face before punching him, we can&rsquo;t release her until tomorrow morning.&rdquo; Chris sighed heavily once again before facing the police officer. &ldquo;What do I have to do to get next to her?&rdquo;, he asked. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t, you have to commit a felony to be behind bars.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry about this&rdquo;, mumbled Chris before punching the officer in the face. You gasped out loud not believing his gesture. The cop groaned in pain and put him roughly against the bars of your cell, opening it and dropping him inside. Chris didn&rsquo;t hesitate a second and grabbed your face, kissing you passionately. &ldquo;What did you do?

It didn\u2019t worked, not even the cold wind could drop the hotness off his face. Suddenly he felt his phone vibrate in his pocket. He knew it was you and had no intention to pick it up. He let the call go to voicemail. Calling a cab, he checked his pockets if he had any change to pay the driver and his eyes caught a glimpse on his screen phone. A surprised expression caught his features. It wasn\u2019t your number but an unknown one. He pressed play on the voice mail and his eyes went wide after he heard the message. \u201cShe did what??\u201d, he told himself after replaying it several times until the driver caught his attention. \u201cYeah sorry\u201d, said Chris. He gave the driver the address and arrived 10 minutes later. At the counter, he asked for you. \u201cName?\u201d, replied the man in front of him. \u201cY/N /YL/N\u201d. The man checked his computer and chuckled. \u201cYeah she\u2019s here.\u201d \u201cCan I see her\u201d, asked Chris. \u201cOnly close family.\u201d \u201cLook you called me ok and I\u2019m- I\u2019m her boyfriend\u201d, his voice cracked. \u201cFollow me\u201d, the man instructed. He led Chris to your cell and saw you crunched on the corner. \u201cARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?\u201d, Chris voice filled the police station, scaring you. </p><p>Your makeup smudged and your bruised hand on display were the least of your worries at the moment and you stood up like a fury. \u201cARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? You left me there, not even giving me the chance to explain myself and now you dare say I\u2019m loosing my shit. Fuck you Chris, fuck you. I never did anything to make you doubt of my feelings. Oh, I\u2019m sorry that I\u2019m only human and couldn\u2019t figure out it wasn\u2019t you\u201d, you counterattacked getting everyone\u2019s attention, your voice increasing. </p><p>Chris sighed heavily, rubbing his face like if he could just rub off his frustrations right on the spot. You paced back and forth on the tiny cell and exclaimed emotionally, \u201cI love you from the bottom of my heart. I would never do anything to compromise and lose what makes me happy. It hurts me that you even consider that I would do such a thing.\u201d He stood there watching at you, tears welled up his eyes, not knowing what to do. \u201cI - I\u2019m sorry, I thought.

He went to the nearest police officer and asked him how much was the caution to get you released. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Sir but considering that she has alcohol in her blood and that she broke a glass on a man\u2019s face before punching him, we can\u2019t release her until tomorrow morning.\u201d Chris sighed heavily once again before facing the police officer. \u201cWhat do I have to do to get next to her?\u201d, he asked. \u201cYou can\u2019t, you have to commit a felony to be behind bars.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about this\u201d, mumbled Chris before punching the officer in the face. You gasped out loud not believing his gesture. The cop groaned in pain and put him roughly against the bars of your cell, opening it and dropping him inside. Chris didn\u2019t hesitate a second and grabbed your face, kissing you passionately. \u201cWhat did you do? You\u2019re crazy\u201d, you breathed out. \u201cI\u2019m spending my birthday with my best girl\u201d, he replied slowly. </p><p>\u201cHey lovebirds, wake up\u201d, a deep male voice exclaimed.

It didn&rsquo;t worked, not even the cold wind could drop the hotness off his face. Suddenly he felt his phone vibrate in his pocket. He knew it was you and had no intention to pick it up. He let the call go to voicemail. Calling a cab, he checked his pockets if he had any change to pay the driver and his eyes caught a glimpse on his screen phone. A surprised expression caught his features. It wasn&rsquo;t your number but an unknown one. He pressed play on the voice mail and his eyes went wide after he heard the message. &ldquo;She did what??&rdquo;, he told himself after replaying it several times until the driver caught his attention. &ldquo;Yeah sorry&rdquo;, said Chris. He gave the driver the address and arrived 10 minutes later. At the counter, he asked for you. &ldquo;Name?&rdquo;, replied the man in front of him. &ldquo;Y/N /YL/N&rdquo;. The man checked his computer and chuckled. &ldquo;Yeah she&rsquo;s here.&rdquo; &ldquo;Can I see her&rdquo;, asked Chris. &ldquo;Only close family.&rdquo; &ldquo;Look you called me ok and I&rsquo;m- I&rsquo;m her boyfriend&rdquo;, his voice cracked. &ldquo;Follow me&rdquo;, the man instructed. He led Chris to your cell and saw you crunched on the corner. &ldquo;ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?&rdquo;, Chris voice filled the police station, scaring you. </p><p>Your makeup smudged and your bruised hand on display were the least of your worries at the moment and you stood up like a fury. &ldquo;ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? You left me there, not even giving me the chance to explain myself and now you dare say I&rsquo;m loosing my shit. Fuck you Chris, fuck you. I never did anything to make you doubt of my feelings. Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry that I&rsquo;m only human and couldn&rsquo;t figure out it wasn&rsquo;t you&rdquo;, you counterattacked getting everyone&rsquo;s attention, your voice increasing. </p><p>Chris sighed heavily, rubbing his face like if he could just rub off his frustrations right on the spot. You paced back and forth on the tiny cell and exclaimed emotionally, &ldquo;I love you from the bottom of my heart. I would never do anything to compromise and lose what makes me happy. It hurts me that you even consider that I would do such a thing.&rdquo; He stood there watching at you, tears welled up his eyes, not knowing what to do. &ldquo;I - I&rsquo;m sorry, I thought. It drove me insane seeing him all over you. I should have let you explain yourself instead of bursting out like that. I&rsquo;m so sorr-&rdquo; &ldquo;I know, I&rsquo;m sorry too if I gave you the impression that you weren&rsquo;t the only one.&rdquo; Chris craved you, to feel you against him. He went to the nearest police officer and asked him how much was the caution to get you released. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Sir but considering that she has alcohol in her blood and that she broke a glass on a man&rsquo;s face before punching him, we can&rsquo;t release her until tomorrow morning.&rdquo; Chris sighed heavily once again before facing the police officer. &ldquo;What do I have to do to get next to her?&rdquo;, he asked. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t, you have to commit a felony to be behind bars.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry about this&rdquo;, mumbled Chris before punching the officer in the face. You gasped out loud not believing his gesture. The cop groaned in pain and put him roughly against the bars of your cell, opening it and dropping him inside. Chris didn&rsquo;t hesitate a second and grabbed your face, kissing you passionately. &ldquo;What did you do? You&rsquo;re crazy&rdquo;, you breathed out. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m spending my birthday with my best girl&rdquo;, he replied slowly. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey lovebirds, wake up&rdquo;, a deep male voice exclaimed. You and Chris woke up and realized you spend the night at the station, it being already morning. They let you out and you asked what would happen next. &ldquo;My colleague decided to not press charges or let the little incident spread out but he wished one thing in exchange.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes anything&rdquo;, replied Chris. &ldquo;His little son&rsquo;s birthday is in a couple of days. Let&rsquo;s say that if he got the opportunity to meet his favorite superhero it would leave him ecstatic.&rdquo; &ldquo;He will be there&rdquo;, you answered and thanked them for not pressing charges. You left the station and took a cab home. &ldquo;Breakfast?&rdquo;, asked Chris once entering home. You marched towards him and kissed him deeply, pouring all your feelings for him in the kiss. &ldquo;Yeah, but first I&rsquo;m gonna give you that juice baby&rdquo;, you smirked and kissed him once more before starting the fun part. </p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><b>PERMANENT</b> <b>TAG</b> <b>LIST</b> : <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVNnuCxaSr0DKoNjYpQkM7g\" target=\"_blank\">@arrowswithwifi</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXCQXLBP-e3ar0rrwHcWggg\" target=\"_blank\">@poetic-pixie</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mevyaZrgR8GtBkdROGoPYAw\" target=\"_blank\">@theshortegg</a> &nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muqRvbe0mEj95uNt_yVzXuw\" target=\"_blank\">@kyber-hearts-and-stardust-souls</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVFWgbxy6uE7nyh7nrquQPw\" target=\"_blank\">@prettybubblesintheair</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFmpGRjCwmu-OpV-wKJ_kwA\" target=\"_blank\">@yafriendlyfangirl</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAFfKJc5cRm1VdTDpK4e3FQ\" target=\"_blank\">@marshmallow-witch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLHxzHDO4l4FZl6LBenK8Jw\" target=\"_blank\">@ms-cellanies</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcSY5dkyLEarvd9khMIHCLg\" target=\"_blank\">@the-feckless-wonder</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfPEU5UnBolUmhNiBp0BcDw\" target=\"_blank\">@cfisher290</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m98boJ2QskB9tCvhYvexAng\" target=\"_blank\">@thefangirltheycallviolet</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQbXOvBF-Wk6l3VnFl6P4UA\" target=\"_blank\">@river-fics</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrJYCPIxFCybo6-CKfVfAzg\" target=\"_blank\">@lilulo-12</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw12zrVmzmGtZLdQ-0rIYTA\" target=\"_blank\">@fanfictionrecommendations-com</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myNyZ5OjH2V2A_8CxhT8JHg\" target=\"_blank\">@spetzerfehn</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmvRpuSWzlyumW0TxBEvYGg\" target=\"_blank\">@angieptt</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muIMbGBGHBRBSh_vW3WaBYg\" target=\"_blank\">@wayward-timetravel-collecter</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLRpNUWZa7qH-ulOAQGrqnA\" target=\"_blank\">@ashley17jacobs</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4yiskJOcz7k_nOLRaHq7iQ\" target=\"_blank\">@lokithedancingqueen</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_7rXAgLvNHsSUkb8lGnyeg\" target=\"_blank\">@wildsoul1221@introvertedsin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYVHoOn4Mp7db-vSptBegww\" target=\"_blank\">@robertconradjr</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6e0nhW809mI7ErYzKY-7ag\" target=\"_blank\">@francezka10</a> &nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9nHaXHEK2rAR_IE_wt-3Yg\" target=\"_blank\">@titty-teetee</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/meLZRtVe8rmhaXM2aukkAAA\" target=\"_blank\">@breezy1415</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu4hgsF4i798HIjruF4pvbw\" target=\"_blank\">@lunarprincess3977</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mL_UtBTYsol3fJHhaYm5hqQ\" target=\"_blank\">@thelostallycat</a>&nbsp;</p></p>",
