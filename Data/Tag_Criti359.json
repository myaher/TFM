Instead of lost very far away, Caleb feels himself hovering very close to his body, nearly grounded, almost there. The ceiling to the room is cobwebbed and the beams have expanded and warped from the brief summers of&hellip;</p><p>&hellip;of wherever he is.</p><!-- more --><p>The voice stops briefly, and Caleb feels a strange panic rise up from his gut to his throat. In his hand he can feel a knot of bed sheets, gripped too tightly, and then the voice is back, and Caleb is sitting up, and something is being pressed to his lips. It\u2019s unpleasant. The rim of a mug? He turns and faces the wall. Soon, he is laying down again.</p><p>Someone is humming as they eat. Someone is talking. It is a male voice. It is not his father. His father is dead.</p><p>\u201cCaleb,\u201d he hears, and he tries to get back into his body to say something or turn his head toward the voice. It\u2019s a pleasant one, calm and patient, and he would like to respond to it. He feels his mouth twist in frustration.<br/></p><p>The voice is closer, and his hand is warm. Someone is holding it. They keep talking, and Caleb wants to be there with this person, wants to listen, wants to ensure this person is not talking alone to no-one. He tries to remember what he would do with Nott to-</p><p>-Nott-</p><p>-he shuts his eyes tightly and thinks about the prison and the breakout and the circus and&hellip; and&hellip;</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Molly,\u201d Caleb says, understanding washing over him like the tide. He forces his eyes to focus and there is a brightly colored something next to the bed, next to an empty plate and a full one on a little table. The something is smiling and it is <i>someone</i>; it is Mollymauk.<br/></p><p>\u201cUsually,\u201d Molly agrees, and squeezes Caleb\u2019s hand.\u00a0\u201cCan you tell me where you are?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cInside,\u201d Caleb says. His body feels leaden and sluggish, as if he\u2019s been running for days.<br/></p><p>\u201cCan you be more specific?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThe inn, the, the Blushing Bride.\u201d He thinks back.\u00a0\u201cI&hellip; floated here?\u201d That can\u2019t be right.<br/></p><p>Molly\u2019s glowing red eyes blink a few times.\u00a0\u201cI called Yasha over to the snowbank you walked into, and had her carry you here.\u201d</p><p>Caleb tries to replay the event without letting himself fall into it.\u00a0\u201cThat&hellip; makes more sense.\u201d Yasha. The others.\u00a0\u201cI made some sort of scene, didn\u2019t I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was nobody around.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>You all</i>\u00a0were around.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYes, and a good thing, or you\u2019d have hypothermia right now, I think.\u201d Molly lets go of his hand, leaning forward a little and pointing to Caleb\u2019s legs.\u00a0\u201cSpeaking of, what do you think of switching to some dry trousers? I dug some out of your pack.\u201d<br/></p><p>There is a blanket over his legs and the one underneath them feels damp and tepid. Caleb pushes himself up to sit and begins unlacing his boots, which are&hellip; soaked through, and his feet are the painful kind of numb. How did he not notice before?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an idiot,\u201d Caleb mutters to himself.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d Molly replies calmly, and lays the trousers and socks out next to Caleb on the bed. He then turns around, busying himself with the plates and the mugs. Caleb falters on his laces and watches Molly for a while, realizing that there is nothing to do with the plates or the mugs, and Molly has just&hellip; turned. Molly has taken care of him but has not gotten him out of his soaking clothes.</p><p>Caleb tries to think of what to say - <i>I trust you to undress me while I\u2019m unresponsive - </i>how does one phrase that less awkwardly? He kicks his boots to the ground, frustrated with himself, hanging his socks and trousers on the nearby chair and changing into the ones Molly\u2019s provided.\u00a0\u201cYou are very kind to me,\u201d he says.</p><p>Molly turns and nods at his dry clothes.\u00a0\u201cI try.\u201d He strips the soaked blanket off the bed, tossing it in the corner of the room.\u00a0\u201cWill you eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just had breakfast.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWe had breakfast at breakfast.\u201d Molly tilts his head. \u201cIt\u2019s past dinner.\u201d<br/></p><p>Caleb looks at the two plates and frowns. Then he glances outside, to the opaque gray sky and&hellip;\u00a0\u201cHave you been singing and minding me since midday?\u201d</p><p>Molly\u2019s quiet for a while, and Caleb stares at him, which Molly seems to mistake for a demand for an answer.\u00a0\u201cNott gave me a break for a little while, but then she called downstairs and said you were getting worse.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s not sure what\u00a0\u2018worse\u2019 means. Was he doing something or not doing something or&hellip;? He just remembers being still.</p><p>\u201cFjord and Beau went back to the mayor and got our pay,\u201d Molly says, pushing on.\u00a0\u201cThe storehouse burned down fine. The foundation is old brick so I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll have a rough time building it again when the spring comes.\u201d<br/></p><p>Caleb tries to remember what they were even trying to do.\u00a0\u201cDid we find the weaver\u2019s&hellip;?\u201d</p><p>Molly shakes his head.\u00a0\u201cBut I bet that asshole we took out in the storehouse had it. We\u2019re going to check tomorrow when everything\u2019s cooled down and see if we can dig up the bodies. It wouldn\u2019t have been hot enough to melt down silver, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Caleb agrees, and feels heavier.</p><p>The silence fills the room, and with a start Caleb looks down to see Molly\u2019s hand taking his again. Molly looks like he\u2019s not sure if this is alright, and Caleb finds himself forcing a smile and squeezing tightly.</p><p>\u201cAh, you remember Hand Time.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cHand&hellip;?\u201d Molly tilts his head, confused (but clearly a little relieved that the gesture was taken well. Caleb must be calming down if he isn\u2019t having to struggle quite so much to read emotions.)<br/></p><p>\u201cI, you didn\u2019t understand words at the time,\u201d Caleb says, gesturing with his other hand.\u00a0\u201cAnd, also, I was saying it in Zemnian. When you were getting anxious I would tell you it was Hand Time.\u201d He jiggles their joined hands in illustration.<br/></p><p>Molly breaks out into laughter. Caleb\u2019s smile grows warmer and more easy to wear on his face.\u00a0\u201cYasha told me,\u201d Molly says, and then sobers up a little.\u00a0\u201cAfter we got out of there, Yasha kind of caught me up. She said you\u2019d been talking to me in Zemnian and that nobody had heard you talk so much in all the time they\u2019d known you. Nott included.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can babble when there\u2019s good reason,\u201d Caleb murmurs into his lap.\u00a0\u201cI, um. For a while I told you about how to cook traditional dishes, mostly one-pot recipes of stews and roast hare&hellip; and then I got a little bolder and told you what I thought of everyone in the group, and later on,\u201d Sensing the opportunity to lighten the mood with a funny anecdote,\u00a0\u201cI, um, I told you that you would not want to rut on a shabby loser like me!\u201d</p><p>Caleb is smiling at the joke, waiting for Molly to smile back, because nothing would make Caleb happier right now than for Molly to look back at that memory and find it to be a comedy of errors, a beautiful fae creature doting on a donkey - but Molly\u2019s face has fallen, deeply hurt, and Caleb kicks himself and tries to dig himself out.</p><p>\u201cIt was a joke,\u201d Caleb says hurriedly.\u00a0\u201cThat is, I <i>did </i>say that, because, obviously, but, I meant it for us to, to laugh at, because everything turned out fine&hellip; you did not&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>Molly\u2019s voice is so soft. \u201cDid you really say that to me?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Caleb confirms, because he still isn\u2019t sure how this <i>wouldn\u2019t</i>\u00a0assure Molly that everything is as it should be, Caleb did not misread Molly\u2019s temporary interest, and Molly\u2019s dignity is still intact. He racks his brain for what else he blathered about.\u00a0\u201cI said you didn\u2019t really want to; I knew that, of course, and-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cCaleb.\u201d<br/></p><p>Caleb looks back at the clothes drying on the chair and grimaces.\u00a0\u201cI just mean, Molly, last week we hauled Fjord out of that bog and had to take <i>everything</i>\u00a0off him, remember? And we, you know, we definitely learned that everything they say about half-orcs is true, but we did it because he was paralyzed and that ooze was acidic. Even Jester did not say anything to him afterward. I, I just mean we all trust each other, and, that includes me trusting you, so-\u201d Caleb\u2019s cut off by a knock on the door.</p><p>\u201cNott?\u201d Molly calls, standing up.<br/></p><p>\u201cYes, I heard voices, is he up?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cCome on in,\u201d Molly says, and he\u2019s barely finished his sentence before Nott has rushed through the door and leaped onto the bed, standing at Caleb\u2019s side and hands over his face, hair, briefly squishing his cheeks.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake! I mean, you\u2019re aware! Caleb, can you hear me?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Caleb confirms through forced ducky lips, and gently takes Nott\u2019s hands in his to bring them down.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It sounds like I gave you all a. A very bad scare.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIt was <i>horrible</i>,\u201d Nott whispers, tears welling in her eyes. She looks at their joined hands a moment, biting her lip, before pulling herself free so she can throw her tiny arms around his neck.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m <i>so sorry</i>. I\u2019m so, so sorry&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>Caleb shoots a look to Molly, who\u2019s shutting the door, as he hugs her back.\u00a0\u201cNone of that was your fault, Nott. I thought I was okay, and I stayed there, and then I, um.\u201d He swallows.\u00a0\u201cThen I was not okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have been with you. I should have had my eye on you. Molly didn\u2019t catch up with you until you were a quarter mile away-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201c-it was only a few steps!\u201d Caleb looks to Molly again for backup.<br/></p><p>\u201cCloser to a quarter mile than a couple steps,\u201d Molly hedges, and shrugs.<br/></p><p>\u201c-and then Yasha had to carry you back and you were crying and you wouldn\u2019t respond, and I knew, I knew I\u2019d totally failed you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNott.\u201d Caleb pulls back just enough to kiss the crown of her head.\u00a0\u201cYou didn\u2019t fail me. Nobody failed me.\u201d He holds her tightly.\u00a0\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for you, and for the rest of the Nein, I. I\u2019d probably be in a gutter right now. Or still rotting away in that cell.\u201d<br/></p><p>Nott sniffs and presses her cheek to Caleb\u2019s before releasing him. She looks across the room.\u00a0\u201cYou didn\u2019t eat your dinner,\u201d she says finally.</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t even drink,\u201d Molly murmurs.\u00a0\u201cHe only\u00a0\u2018woke up\u2019 a couple minutes ago.\u201d He looks out the window at the growing snowdrift.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve just been catching up and talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Nott frowns at Molly, and then at Caleb.\u00a0\u201cIf I go take your wet clothes downstairs and put them up by the hearth to dry, do you promise to eat?\u201d<br/></p><p>Caleb smiles.\u00a0\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Everything</i>\u00a0on the plate,\u201d she adds.<br/></p><p>There is a warm glow in his heart that Caleb can\u2019t quite put to words.\u00a0\u201cEvery crumb.\u201d</p><p>Nott seems satisfied, pushing some strands of hair behind Caleb\u2019s ears and fixing his part in a rare moment of motherly grooming. After a moment\u2019s hesitation, she makes sure Molly is still looking out the window as she licks her thumb and swipes it firmly across Caleb\u2019s jawline.</p><p>\u201cZum Tuefel, Nott.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou had <i>dirt</i>\u00a0on you,\u201d the little goblin explains, unapologetic. She hops off the mattress, gathering the socks and trousers up in her arms, nodding to them both before walking out the door and shutting it behind her. Caleb waits until her little footsteps are disappearing down the hall to look down to his lap and smile to himself.</p>",

He forces his eyes to focus and there is a brightly colored something next to the bed, next to an empty plate and a full one on a little table. The something is smiling and it is <i>someone</i>; it is Mollymauk.<br></p><p>\u201cUsually,\u201d Molly agrees, and squeezes Caleb\u2019s hand.\u00a0\u201cCan you tell me where you are?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cInside,\u201d Caleb says.

I dug some out of your pack.\u201d<br></p><p>There is a blanket over his legs and the one underneath them feels damp and tepid. Caleb pushes himself up to sit and begins unlacing his boots, which are\u2026 soaked through, and his feet are the painful kind of numb. How did he not notice before?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an idiot,\u201d Caleb mutters to himself.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d Molly replies calmly, and lays the trousers and socks out next to Caleb on the bed. He then turns around, busying himself with the plates and the mugs. Caleb falters on his laces and watches Molly for a while, realizing that there is nothing to do with the plates or the mugs, and Molly has just\u2026 turned. Molly has taken care of him but has not gotten him out of his soaking clothes.</p><p>Caleb tries to think of what to say - <i>I trust you to undress me while I\u2019m unresponsive - </i>how does one phrase that less awkwardly? He kicks his boots to the ground, frustrated with himself, hanging his socks and trousers on the nearby chair and changing into the ones Molly\u2019s provided.\u00a0\u201cYou are very kind to me,\u201d he says.</p><p>Molly turns and nods at his dry clothes.\u00a0\u201cI try.\u201d He strips the soaked blanket off the bed, tossing it in the corner of the room.\u00a0\u201cWill you eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just had breakfast.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWe had breakfast at breakfast.\u201d Molly tilts his head. \u201cIt\u2019s past dinner.\u201d<br></p><p>Caleb looks at the two plates and frowns. Then he glances outside, to the opaque gray sky and\u2026\u00a0\u201cHave you been singing and minding me since midday?\u201d</p><p>Molly\u2019s quiet for a while, and Caleb stares at him, which Molly seems to mistake for a demand for an answer.\u00a0\u201cNott gave me a break for a little while, but then she called downstairs and said you were getting worse.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s not sure what\u00a0\u2018worse\u2019 means. Was he doing something or not doing something or\u2026? He just remembers being still.</p><p>\u201cFjord and Beau went back to the mayor and got our pay,\u201d Molly says, pushing on.\u00a0\u201cThe storehouse burned down fine. The foundation is old brick so I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll have a rough time building it again when the spring comes.\u201d<br></p><p>Caleb tries to remember what they were even trying to do.\u00a0\u201cDid we find the weaver\u2019s\u2026?\u201d</p><p>Molly shakes his head.\u00a0\u201cBut I bet that asshole we took out in the storehouse had it. We\u2019re going to check tomorrow when everything\u2019s cooled down and see if we can dig up the bodies. It wouldn\u2019t have been hot enough to melt down silver, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Caleb agrees, and feels heavier.</p><p>The silence fills the room, and with a start Caleb looks down to see Molly\u2019s hand taking his again. Molly looks like he\u2019s not sure if this is alright, and Caleb finds himself forcing a smile and squeezing tightly.</p><p>\u201cAh, you remember Hand Time.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHand\u2026?\u201d Molly tilts his head, confused (but clearly a little relieved that the gesture was taken well. Caleb must be calming down if he isn\u2019t having to struggle quite so much to read emotions.)<br></p><p>\u201cI, you didn\u2019t understand words at the time,\u201d Caleb says, gesturing with his other hand.\u00a0\u201cAnd, also, I was saying it in Zemnian. When you were getting anxious I would tell you it was Hand Time.\u201d He jiggles their joined hands in illustration.<br></p><p>Molly breaks out into laughter. Caleb\u2019s smile grows warmer and more easy to wear on his face.\u00a0\u201cYasha told me,\u201d Molly says, and then sobers up a little.\u00a0\u201cAfter we got out of there, Yasha kind of caught me up. She said you\u2019d been talking to me in Zemnian and that nobody had heard you talk so much in all the time they\u2019d known you.

He forces his eyes to focus and there is a brightly colored something next to the bed, next to an empty plate and a full one on a little table. The something is smiling and it is <i>someone</i>; it is Mollymauk.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Usually,&rdquo; Molly agrees, and squeezes Caleb&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp;&ldquo;Can you tell me where you are?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Inside,&rdquo; Caleb says. His body feels leaden and sluggish, as if he&rsquo;s been running for days.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Can you be more specific?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;The inn, the, the Blushing Bride.&rdquo; He thinks back.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&hellip; floated here?&rdquo; That can&rsquo;t be right.<br /></p><p>Molly&rsquo;s glowing red eyes blink a few times.&nbsp;&ldquo;I called Yasha over to the snowbank you walked into, and had her carry you here.&rdquo;</p><p>Caleb tries to replay the event without letting himself fall into it.&nbsp;&ldquo;That&hellip; makes more sense.&rdquo; Yasha. The others.&nbsp;&ldquo;I made some sort of scene, didn&rsquo;t I.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There was nobody around.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>You all</i>&nbsp;were around.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes, and a good thing, or you&rsquo;d have hypothermia right now, I think.&rdquo; Molly lets go of his hand, leaning forward a little and pointing to Caleb&rsquo;s legs.&nbsp;&ldquo;Speaking of, what do you think of switching to some dry trousers? I dug some out of your pack.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>There is a blanket over his legs and the one underneath them feels damp and tepid. Caleb pushes himself up to sit and begins unlacing his boots, which are&hellip; soaked through, and his feet are the painful kind of numb. How did he not notice before?</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an idiot,&rdquo; Caleb mutters to himself.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; Molly replies calmly, and lays the trousers and socks out next to Caleb on the bed. He then turns around, busying himself with the plates and the mugs. Caleb falters on his laces and watches Molly for a while, realizing that there is nothing to do with the plates or the mugs, and Molly has just&hellip; turned. Molly has taken care of him but has not gotten him out of his soaking clothes.</p><p>Caleb tries to think of what to say - <i>I trust you to undress me while I&rsquo;m unresponsive - </i>how does one phrase that less awkwardly? He kicks his boots to the ground, frustrated with himself, hanging his socks and trousers on the nearby chair and changing into the ones Molly&rsquo;s provided.&nbsp;&ldquo;You are very kind to me,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>Molly turns and nods at his dry clothes.&nbsp;&ldquo;I try.&rdquo; He strips the soaked blanket off the bed, tossing it in the corner of the room.&nbsp;&ldquo;Will you eat?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We just had breakfast.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We had breakfast at breakfast.&rdquo; Molly tilts his head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s past dinner.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Caleb looks at the two plates and frowns. Then he glances outside, to the opaque gray sky and&hellip;&nbsp;&ldquo;Have you been singing and minding me since midday?&rdquo;</p><p>Molly&rsquo;s quiet for a while, and Caleb stares at him, which Molly seems to mistake for a demand for an answer.&nbsp;&ldquo;Nott gave me a break for a little while, but then she called downstairs and said you were getting worse.&rdquo;</p><p>Caleb&rsquo;s not sure what&nbsp;&lsquo;worse&rsquo; means. Was he doing something or not doing something or&hellip;? He just remembers being still.</p><p>&ldquo;Fjord and Beau went back to the mayor and got our pay,&rdquo; Molly says, pushing on.&nbsp;&ldquo;The storehouse burned down fine. The foundation is old brick so I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll have a rough time building it again when the spring comes.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Caleb tries to remember what they were even trying to do.&nbsp;&ldquo;Did we find the weaver&rsquo;s&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>Molly shakes his head.&nbsp;&ldquo;But I bet that asshole we took out in the storehouse had it. We&rsquo;re going to check tomorrow when everything&rsquo;s cooled down and see if we can dig up the bodies. It wouldn&rsquo;t have been hot enough to melt down silver, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Caleb agrees, and feels heavier.</p><p>The silence fills the room, and with a start Caleb looks down to see Molly&rsquo;s hand taking his again. Molly looks like he&rsquo;s not sure if this is alright, and Caleb finds himself forcing a smile and squeezing tightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, you remember Hand Time.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hand&hellip;?&rdquo; Molly tilts his head, confused (but clearly a little relieved that the gesture was taken well. Caleb must be calming down if he isn&rsquo;t having to struggle quite so much to read emotions.)<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I, you didn&rsquo;t understand words at the time,&rdquo; Caleb says, gesturing with his other hand.&nbsp;&ldquo;And, also, I was saying it in Zemnian. When you were getting anxious I would tell you it was Hand Time.&rdquo; He jiggles their joined hands in illustration.<br /></p><p>Molly breaks out into laughter. Caleb&rsquo;s smile grows warmer and more easy to wear on his face.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yasha told me,&rdquo; Molly says, and then sobers up a little.&nbsp;&ldquo;After we got out of there, Yasha kind of caught me up. She said you&rsquo;d been talking to me in Zemnian and that nobody had heard you talk so much in all the time they&rsquo;d known you. Nott included.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can babble when there&rsquo;s good reason,&rdquo; Caleb murmurs into his lap.&nbsp;&ldquo;I, um. For a while I told you about how to cook traditional dishes, mostly one-pot recipes of stews and roast hare&hellip; and then I got a little bolder and told you what I thought of everyone in the group, and later on,&rdquo; Sensing the opportunity to lighten the mood with a funny anecdote,&nbsp;&ldquo;I, um, I told you that you would not want to rut on a shabby loser like me!&rdquo;</p><p>Caleb is smiling at the joke, waiting for Molly to smile back, because nothing would make Caleb happier right now than for Molly to look back at that memory and find it to be a comedy of errors, a beautiful fae creature doting on a donkey - but Molly&rsquo;s face has fallen, deeply hurt, and Caleb kicks himself and tries to dig himself out.</p><p>&ldquo;It was a joke,&rdquo; Caleb says hurriedly.&nbsp;&ldquo;That is, I <i>did </i>say that, because, obviously, but, I meant it for us to, to laugh at, because everything turned out fine&hellip; you did not&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Molly&rsquo;s voice is so soft. &ldquo;Did you really say that to me?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Caleb confirms, because he still isn&rsquo;t sure how this <i>wouldn&rsquo;t</i>&nbsp;assure Molly that everything is as it should be, Caleb did not misread Molly&rsquo;s temporary interest, and Molly&rsquo;s dignity is still intact. He racks his brain for what else he blathered about.&nbsp;&ldquo;I said you didn&rsquo;t really want to; I knew that, of course, and-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Caleb.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Caleb looks back at the clothes drying on the chair and grimaces.&nbsp;&ldquo;I just mean, Molly, last week we hauled Fjord out of that bog and had to take <i>everything</i>&nbsp;off him, remember? And we, you know, we definitely learned that everything they say about half-orcs is true, but we did it because he was paralyzed and that ooze was acidic. Even Jester did not say anything to him afterward. I, I just mean we all trust each other, and, that includes me trusting you, so-&rdquo; Caleb&rsquo;s cut off by a knock on the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Nott?&rdquo; Molly calls, standing up.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard voices, is he up?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Come on in,&rdquo; Molly says, and he&rsquo;s barely finished his sentence before Nott has rushed through the door and leaped onto the bed, standing at Caleb&rsquo;s side and hands over his face, hair, briefly squishing his cheeks.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re awake! I mean, you&rsquo;re aware! Caleb, can you hear me?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; Caleb confirms through forced ducky lips, and gently takes Nott&rsquo;s hands in his to bring them down.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. It sounds like I gave you all a. A very bad scare.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It was <i>horrible</i>,&rdquo; Nott whispers, tears welling in her eyes. She looks at their joined hands a moment, biting her lip, before pulling herself free so she can throw her tiny arms around his neck.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>so sorry</i>. I&rsquo;m so, so sorry&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Caleb shoots a look to Molly, who&rsquo;s shutting the door, as he hugs her back.&nbsp;&ldquo;None of that was your fault, Nott. I thought I was okay, and I stayed there, and then I, um.&rdquo; He swallows.&nbsp;&ldquo;Then I was not okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I should have been with you. I should have had my eye on you. Molly didn&rsquo;t catch up with you until you were a quarter mile away-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;-it was only a few steps!&rdquo; Caleb looks to Molly again for backup.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Closer to a quarter mile than a couple steps,&rdquo; Molly hedges, and shrugs.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;-and then Yasha had to carry you back and you were crying and you wouldn&rsquo;t respond, and I knew, I knew I&rsquo;d totally failed you-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nott.&rdquo; Caleb pulls back just enough to kiss the crown of her head.&nbsp;&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t fail me. Nobody failed me.&rdquo; He holds her tightly.&nbsp;&ldquo;If it weren&rsquo;t for you, and for the rest of the Nein, I. I&rsquo;d probably be in a gutter right now. Or still rotting away in that cell.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Nott sniffs and presses her cheek to Caleb&rsquo;s before releasing him. She looks across the room.&nbsp;&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t eat your dinner,&rdquo; she says finally.</p><p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t even drink,&rdquo; Molly murmurs.&nbsp;&ldquo;He only&nbsp;&lsquo;woke up&rsquo; a couple minutes ago.&rdquo; He looks out the window at the growing snowdrift.&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just been catching up and talking.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Nott frowns at Molly, and then at Caleb.&nbsp;&ldquo;If I go take your wet clothes downstairs and put them up by the hearth to dry, do you promise to eat?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Caleb smiles.&nbsp;&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Everything</i>&nbsp;on the plate,&rdquo; she adds.<br /></p><p>There is a warm glow in his heart that Caleb can&rsquo;t quite put to words.&nbsp;&ldquo;Every crumb.&rdquo;</p><p>Nott seems satisfied, pushing some strands of hair behind Caleb&rsquo;s ears and fixing his part in a rare moment of motherly grooming. After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, she makes sure Molly is still looking out the window as she licks her thumb and swipes it firmly across Caleb&rsquo;s jawline.</p><p>&ldquo;Zum Tuefel, Nott.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You had <i>dirt</i>&nbsp;on you,&rdquo; the little goblin explains, unapologetic. She hops off the mattress, gathering the socks and trousers up in her arms, nodding to them both before walking out the door and shutting it behind her. Caleb waits until her little footsteps are disappearing down the hall to look down to his lap and smile to himself.</p>",
