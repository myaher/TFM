It wasn\u2019t that Harry was particularly proud of that fact, although there had been a certain sense of satisfaction when Hermione had beamed up at him. No, this reminder played on loop for one simple purpose \u2013 to remind him not to hex the Dursley\u2019s. It seemed like an innocent enough initiative. It would be a way for those that participated in the war to reach out to the muggles that had been \u2013 unknowingly \u2013 affected. Hermione had thought the idea brilliant, Ron had thought it a better alternative to fixing up the school before returning for their eighth and final year. The Weasley\u2019s didn\u2019t say as much, but none of them were quite ready to return to the place where they had lost Fred. Perhaps if Harry had known exactly <i>which</i> muggles he would be saddled with, he would have gladly signed up for manual labor.</p><p>Although he and Dudley had an amicable goodbye, Harry\u2019s Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia didn\u2019t seemed to want to forget that fact that it was <i>Harry</i> that had drove them away from their home. Never mind the sadistic wizard that wanted them all dead. At first, it had almost been amusing\u2026 familiar. Perhaps the war had done something to Harry\u2019s brain if he listened in on Uncle Vernon\u2019s complaining with anything other than contempt. Although it had been the first time he had seen them since his daring escape from number 4 Privet Drive, they had apparently seen <i>him</i> before then. Harry had thought it safe \u2013 to date in muggle London. After all, most wizards kept to themselves these days, and those that dared venture into the realm of muggles tended to stick to less crowded areas. Maybe that\u2019s why Harry had grown complacent enough to bring Andrei Petrov to dinner there. It hadn\u2019t been serious, not on Harry\u2019s part anyway. He was fresh out of the war and simply looking to explore the feelings he had pushed aside for years. Between his aunt and uncle\u2019s bigoted views and the threat on his life, Harry had been weary to explore his sexuality. Andrei was nice enough, and more than pleasant to look at. He had arrived with the other good will ambassadors from Durmstrang after the war. It had lasted three weeks and ended after a public yet questionable romp in an alley before Andrei departed. Although the relationship (if it could be called that) was short, it had confirmed two things for Harry. The first, was that he most certainly <i>was</i> bi-sexual. The second\u2026 well, perhaps he wasn\u2019t as safe in muggle London as he liked to hope. </p><p>To Uncle Vernon\u2019s credit, he waited until Harry\u2019s second visit to bring up the fact that he and Aunt Petunia had seen him kissing Andrei. Harry waited for the shame and embarrassment to come \u2013 like it always had when they judged him with those beady eyes of theirs \u2013 but it didn\u2019t. Dudley said nothing on the subject, but Harry noticed he kept his distance. As if he would <i>catch</i> something. Harry had managed to avoid his Uncle\u2019s half-hearted words of warning by tending to Aunt Petunia\u2019s garden.</p><p>By the fourth visit to the Dursley\u2019s, Harry was forgetting why he ever wanted to help them in the first place. The program was set up for six visits per muggle family, so it was almost over\u2026 another fact Harry had to mentally repeat numerous times. At least now, walking down the streets of the busiest shopping district in London, Uncle Vernon\u2019s condescending tone was low and manageable. Part of Harry almost wished he was still seeing Andrei, if only to have a way of getting Uncle Vernon to <i>shut up</i>. Long gone were the days where Harry strived to be loved and accepted by the Dursley\u2019s. Now, he just wondered how he could make this whole ordeal as uncomfortable for them as they had made it for him.</p><p>As Aunt Petunia worked to coddle her ever-reddening husband, Harry\u2019s attention was stolen by a familiar flash of white. It had been months since he had seen any of the Malfoy\u2019s. He had spoken at their trial \u2013 at least on behalf of Narcissa and Draco. The last he heard from the <i>Profit</i> was that Lucius was looking at life in Azkaban. Harry wasn\u2019t sure if it was the shock of seeing Draco Malfoy amongst the busy muggles going about their day, or simply the sight of him alone, but his feet froze. Hermione had mentioned something about Malfoy being forced by the Ministry to join the program, but he didn\u2019t think for a moment that they would actually allow a <i>death eater </i>near muggles. He looked better than he did at the trial, but that wasn\u2019t saying much. Harry remembered thinking that it was the only time Draco Malfoy had ever appeared small to him. Yes, he was an annoying git, and he hardly ever played fair, but after the war he was just\u2026 broken.</p><p>Harry watched as Draco spoke in a low voice to a young boy, pointing to something in a shop window before brushing a strand of hair behind his ear. It was longer now \u2013 Harry realized. It seemed Malfoy had forgone his trademark style of slicking his hair to skull and simply let it grow out. Harry wanted to come up with a quip \u2013 if only for the fact that Malfoy had always made fun of his own unkempt hair \u2013 but he found he couldn\u2019t. The look suited Malfoy. It softened some of his sharp edges. Or perhaps it was the fact that Harry had only ever seen hatred on Malfoy\u2019s features. It wasn\u2019t until those sharp, mercury eyes shot to him that Harry realized he was walking over. His step faltered at the realization, but he could hardly stop now.</p><p><i> </i></p><p>\u201cMalfoy.\u201d Harry greeted with a small nod, trying to pretend that this was all just perfectly normal.</p><p>\u201cPotter.\u201d Malfoy\u2019s voice was cool an assessing, but his eyes moved curiously over Harry\u2019s face. His top lip twitch in a mockery of the sneer that was once so at home on Malfoy\u2019s mouth, making Harry wonder if he <i>was</i> as broken as he had looked at the Wizengamot.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as if we\u2026,\u201c Uncle Vernon\u2019s voice seemed to roar over the murmur of hundreds of bustling shoppers as the Dursley\u2019s descended on them. For a moment, Harry had forgotten they were there. He seemed to remember Harry just as Harry was remembering him. \u201cWhat\u2019s this then, boy?\u201d He gruffed, his eyes narrowing in a way that reminded Harry all too well of his younger years. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be helping us, not socializing!\u201d His eyes never left Draco, as if he believed if he stared hard enough, he\u2019d be able to <i>see</i> the magic.</p><p>\u201cIs this your boyfriend then, Harry?\u201d He was sure that Dudley had meant it to be an insult of sorts, but there was a genuine curiosity in his tone. Harry opened his mouth to reply that of course <i>Malfoy</i> was not the type he would date when he noticed his aunt and uncle go stiff. For the first time since these <i>meetings</i> started, they were quiet. Malfoy might not have what he had in mind, but he would do well enough.</p><p>\u201cRemember that life-debt you owe me, Malfoy?\u201d Harry mumbled, his bright jade eyes skidding over to Draco\u2019s. \u201cConsider it paid in full after this&hellip;\u201d Before Malfoy could protest, or maybe hex him, Harry grabbed either side of his sharp jaw and hauled him forward until their lips met in the middle.</p><p>It was hardly a scandalous kiss, though Harry had a feeling that if Malfoy decided to haul back and punch him, it would certainly seem that way. Nonetheless, he heard Aunt Petunia\u2019s gasp and Uncle Vernon\u2019s sputter behind him. When it became clear that Malfoy <i>wasn\u2019t</i> going to break his nose (again), Harry stepped into him more fully. It was only when Harry\u2019s calloused fingers landed on the fine silk of Malfoy\u2019s shirt that it sunk in. He was kissing <i>Draco - sodding - Malfoy</i>. It wasn\u2019t that Malfoy was bad looking - if you were into that whole pointy, toned, blond haired, and otherworldly eyes thing\u2026. Harry wasn\u2019t. At all. So what if Malfoy was fit? So what if he tasted like something akin to treacle tart? So what if he was kissing Harry back\u2026 wait, what!? As Harry\u2019s gasped lightly in surprise, he felt Malfoy\u2019s thin lips curve up around his. Those boney fingers that usually only formed fists in his presence dug into the sides of Harry\u2019s too-large jumper before rounding to cup Harry\u2019s arse. He was sure he heard Aunt Petunia faint behind him, but the last thing he wanted to do was turn and check.</p><p>This had all gone sideways rather quickly\u2026</p><p><b><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fko-fi.com%2Fmymindsmadness&amp;t=ODQyNjE0YmM1Y2Q0ZGExZjNhZThlMWRjMjQ1Njk5NjY4MzE4Y2EyYSxQVW9JYmpGQw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AqkgbfVug6R4Kp2-fHC-OHw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fmymindsmadness.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182638337318%2Fdrarry-plot-idea-harry-has-figured-out-that&amp;m=1\">Buy me a coffee</a> \u00a0|| <a href=\"http://mymindsmadness.tumblr.com/ask\">Drop me an ask</a> </b></p>",

For a moment, Harry had forgotten they were there. He seemed to remember Harry just as Harry was remembering him. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this then, boy?&rdquo; He gruffed, his eyes narrowing in a way that reminded Harry all too well of his younger years. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re supposed to be helping us, not socializing!&rdquo; His eyes never left Draco, as if he believed if he stared hard enough, he&rsquo;d be able to <i>see</i> the magic.</p><p>&ldquo;Is this your boyfriend then, Harry?&rdquo; He was sure that Dudley had meant it to be an insult of sorts, but there was a genuine curiosity in his tone. Harry opened his mouth to reply that of course <i>Malfoy</i> was not the type he would date when he noticed his aunt and uncle go stiff. For the first time since these <i>meetings</i> started, they were quiet. Malfoy might not have what he had in mind, but he would do well enough.</p><p>&ldquo;Remember that life-debt you owe me, Malfoy?&rdquo; Harry mumbled, his bright jade eyes skidding over to Draco&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Consider it paid in full after this&hellip;&rdquo; Before Malfoy could protest, or maybe hex him, Harry grabbed either side of his sharp jaw and hauled him forward until their lips met in the middle.</p><p>It was hardly a scandalous kiss, though Harry had a feeling that if Malfoy decided to haul back and punch him, it would certainly seem that way. Nonetheless, he heard Aunt Petunia&rsquo;s gasp and Uncle Vernon&rsquo;s sputter behind him. When it became clear that Malfoy <i>wasn&rsquo;t</i> going to break his nose (again), Harry stepped into him more fully. It was only when Harry&rsquo;s calloused fingers landed on the fine silk of Malfoy&rsquo;s shirt that it sunk in. He was kissing <i>Draco - sodding - Malfoy</i>. It wasn&rsquo;t that Malfoy was bad looking - if you were into that whole pointy, toned, blond haired, and otherworldly eyes thing&hellip;. Harry wasn&rsquo;t. At all. So what if Malfoy was fit? So what if he tasted like something akin to treacle tart? So what if he was kissing Harry back&hellip; wait, what!? As Harry&rsquo;s gasped lightly in surprise, he felt Malfoy&rsquo;s thin lips curve up around his. Those boney fingers that usually only formed fists in his presence dug into the sides of Harry&rsquo;s too-large jumper before rounding to cup Harry&rsquo;s arse. He was sure he heard Aunt Petunia faint behind him, but the last thing he wanted to do was turn and check.</p><p>This had all gone sideways rather quickly&hellip;</p><p><b><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fko-fi.com%2Fmymindsmadness&amp;t=ODQyNjE0YmM1Y2Q0ZGExZjNhZThlMWRjMjQ1Njk5NjY4MzE4Y2EyYSxQVW9JYmpGQw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AqkgbfVug6R4Kp2-fHC-OHw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fmymindsmadness.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182638337318%2Fdrarry-plot-idea-harry-has-figured-out-that&amp;m=1\">Buy me a coffee</a> &nbsp;|| <a href=\"http://mymindsmadness.tumblr.com/ask\">Drop me an ask</a> </b></p></p>",
