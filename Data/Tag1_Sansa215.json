Luckily not all his customers acted like this and even more luckily he had delivered all meals for today and could finally return to his dorm, to the warmth and his astronomy homework. </p><p>When he had started his studies a few years ago student\u2019s life had all seemed very exciting. He had heard stories about the wild parties, the illegal drinking and the making friends for life. He had most of all heard that most people found their true love while being in college. </p><p>None of it had happened. Even among students astronomy was considered boring, which meant that his classmates didn\u2019t even wanna be found anywhere near a wild party and none of them would ever cross the line of illegal drinking. And that meant that the other students had simply stopped inviting them.</p><p>Even Robb Stark, his dorm mate, had stopped mentioning the parties as soon as he had discovered that Jon was not exactly the most interesting conversationalist to introduce to his football friends when they were drunk. Or actually, Jon was the most interesting conversationalist, which was exactly the problem.</p><p>If he had known that the real student life looked like this, he might have considered finding a normal job right away. That normal job couldn\u2019t possibly be worse that delivering meals to elder people who had too much money and no one who cared about them anymore.</p><p>He pulled his hat over his dark black curls and needed three attempts to get his gloves on. His student loan was barely enough to cover his rent and food, so he didn\u2019t have money for a motorbike or a car. Which meant that he was still stuck with his cargo bike, both in summer and winter.</p><p>It really was not as exciting as he had once imagined it to be. </p><p>But Jon didn\u2019t know that his entire life was about to be changed.</p><!-- more --><p>Just before Jon stepped on his bike to ride back to campus, a big yellow bus stopped at the bus sign. Normally the bus, that once a day brought people from this small middle of nowhere to the nearest big city and once a day made the trip backwards, arrived here empty, but today a girl carrying two suitcases stepped out. </p><p>She wore a white hat over her strawberry blond, or was it even red, hair. The hat barely covered her ears, but maybe the hat was not supposed to be functional. The dark black coat keeping her body warm at least looked far more expensive than anything Jon could ever pay for. Not to mention her bright red boots reaching her knee caps with a logo on it that in itself was already worth more than Jon had ever earned in his life.</p><p>But it was her smile that really made him lose his grip on his bike. Just when his jaw dropped, the cargo bike slipped from his hand, fell in the snow, bruised his ankles and tipped him over. It all happened within a few seconds, but it didn\u2019t really happen in silence. </p><p>The pretty red haired girl looked up and with her suitcases in her gloved hands she rushed towards him, kneeling down next to him as soon as she\u2019d reached him. \u201cIs everything alright?\u201d </p><p>Jon laid flat on his back in the ice cold snow with bruised ankles, but he still nodded. \u201cYeah, yeah\u2026\u201d He sat up and pushed his glasses a little further on his nose. \u201cI&rsquo;m fine.\u201d</p><p>The girl furrowed her eyebrows, but she didn\u2019t say anything and just watched him. \u201cDo we know each other? For some reason I have the feeling we\u2019ve already met, but I have no idea where and when.\u201d</p><p>Jon shrugged and he stood up before he reached out his hand to help the girl stand up too. \u201cI&rsquo;m pretty sure I would\u2019ve remembered it if we\u2019ve met.\u201d He didn\u2019t let go of her hand, but instead shook it a little awkwardly. \u201cJon, Jon Snow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO!\u201d Her eyes widened and a smile spread across her angelic face while she pulled her hand back. \u201cThat\u2019s it! You must be THE Jon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Jon?\u201d Jon swallowed. All of a sudden he was not sure anymore if this girl knowing him was a good or a bad thing. Did he have a reputation? Were there rumors going around he knew nothing about?</p><p>The pretty girl rolled her eyes. \u201cAre you now telling me that my brother forced me to listen to all his stories about you, but never mentioned me in a conversation with you?\u201d She crossed her arms in front of her chest and cocked her head. In a weird way it was cute and attractive at once. \u201cI\u2019m Sansa, Sansa Stark. I\u2019m here to spend the holidays with my brother Robb. And, if I\u2019m not mistaken you\u2019re his dorm mate Jon.\u201d</p><p>Jon wasn\u2019t sure if this was the right moment to let out a sigh of relief or not. At least there was no weird story going around that was most likely not true, but he was not sure what Robb had told his sister about him.</p><p>And where that normally wouldn\u2019t have mattered, it now seemed to be one of the most important things in the world. </p><p>\u201cOnly good things, I hope?\u201d Jon swallowed and he scratched the back of his neck. </p><p>He and Robb were great friends and he couldn\u2019t have wished for a better dorm mate, but he did know that Robb sometimes thought he was boring or too intelligent for his own good. </p><p>Sansa licked her dry lips. \u201cYou know how Robb wears his heart on his tongue, but over all he pictured you as a very brave and intelligent young man.\u201d She grinned. \u201cOne who doesn\u2019t drink because he\u2019s not yet twenty-one. One who doesn\u2019t smoke because it increases the risks to catch countless of life threatening diseases. And one who has a job that actually benefits people in our society who barely get attention.\u201d</p><p>Jon left out a chuckle, partly because the whole fact that she seemed to know exactly who he was while he had no idea who she was made him feel uncomfortable, partly because strictly everything she knew about him was somehow correct. \u201cI sound kinda boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO no!\u201d Sansa raised her voice and shook her head. \u201cThat&rsquo;s absolutely not how I\u2019ve always interpreted it!\u201d She placed a hand on his shoulder and it felt surprisingly comforting to have her touch him. \u201cIt\u2019s actually refreshing. There are already more than enough men in this world who think the key to masculinity is drinking too much and talking as many girls as possible into their beds.\u201d</p><p>Jon rolled his eyes. \u201cIf this speech ends with but you\u2019re different, it sounds like it walked straight out of a Jane Austen book.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\u2019s smile brightened and Jon felt his heart skip a few beats in his chest. \u201cRobb never told me you are into literature too.\u201d She cocked her head. \u201cYou&rsquo;re getting more and more interesting with every word you speak, Jon Snow.\u201d</p><p>For a moment Jon didn\u2019t know what to say. He felt a shiver, one of the good and pleasant kind, rolling down his spine and his entire skin tingled. If this really had been some kind of Jane Austen book, he would\u2019ve known the right thing to say. But he wasn\u2019t in a Jane Austen book and nothing even remotely good crossed his mind. </p><p>Instead he eventually decided to change the subject entirely. \u201cSo, you\u2019re here to spend the Christmas days with Robb?\u201d</p><p>Sansa nodded. \u201cAnd with you, it seems. I actually thought you would go home to your family, like most students do, but I\u2019m sure Robb won\u2019t mind me inviting you to our dinner too.\u201d</p><p>Jon bent his head and all of a sudden he saw his cargo bike still lying in the snow. He had almost forgotten about it. Quickly he bent down to grab his bike and once it stood up again he made sure to hold it firmly this time. \u201cYeah, if Robb doesn\u2019t mind, I\u2019d love to come over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;re coming over then. I don\u2019t even care if he minds. No one should be alone with Christmas and especially not intelligent and charming young men like you.\u201d She winked and a pleasant warmth spread through his entire body. </p><p>Even if he had not worn a scarf, hat and gloves right now, he would have stopped noticing the cold. Who could be bothered by snow and wind and ice, when a beautiful girl like Sansa Stark delivered one compliment after the other? Who could be bothered by winter, when a pretty lady like Sansa Stark was there to warm your heart?</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d He cleared his throat and coughed. \u201cHow are you gonna get to campus?\u201d</p><p>In summer time it was a nice walk from the city centre to the campus, but with all the snow and cold right now it would be a long and nasty one. Especially on those high heeled boots Sansa was wearing. </p><p>\u201cI was planning on calling Robb to come and pick me up, but\u2026\u201d Sansa looked at the bike and raised her eyebrows. \u201cIf you have better ideas, I\u2019m all ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could\u2026\u201d Jon looked at his bike, at the pretty girl and back at his bike. \u201cYou can put your suitcases in the cargo and jump on the back?\u201d</p><p>It was not as comfortable and warm as a car, but it would save her some waiting time. And it would mean she would be very very close to him and forced to hold onto him very tightly. </p><p>\u201cThat sounds like an excellent idea!\u201d Sansa pecked his cheek, but before she could see how his cheeks colored a bright pink she already reached for her suitcases and threw them in the cargo. \u201cI&rsquo;m glad we\u2019ve met, Jon Snow.\u201d She waited until he swung one leg over his bike and stabilized it even more. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t wait to get to know you even better. It\u2019s going to be a wonderful Christmas time, I already feel it.\u201d</p><p>Jon smiled and he took a deep breath when she jumped on the back of his bike and wrapped her arms firmly around his waist. \u201cI hope you mean it\u2019s gonna be a great life.\u201d He murmured, but the wind did carry his words to the girl on the back of his bike anyway.</p><p>And Jon maybe couldn\u2019t see it. But she smiled. She smiled brightly and let her head rest to his back while she already envisioned their wedding day.</p>",

It all happened within a few seconds, but it didn\u2019t really happen in silence. </p><p>The pretty red haired girl looked up and with her suitcases in her gloved hands she rushed towards him, kneeling down next to him as soon as she\u2019d reached him. \u201cIs everything alright?\u201d </p><p>Jon laid flat on his back in the ice cold snow with bruised ankles, but he still nodded. \u201cYeah, yeah\u2026\u201d He sat up and pushed his glasses a little further on his nose. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>The girl furrowed her eyebrows, but she didn\u2019t say anything and just watched him. \u201cDo we know each other? For some reason I have the feeling we\u2019ve already met, but I have no idea where and when.\u201d</p><p>Jon shrugged and he stood up before he reached out his hand to help the girl stand up too. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I would\u2019ve remembered it if we\u2019ve met.\u201d He didn\u2019t let go of her hand, but instead shook it a little awkwardly. \u201cJon, Jon Snow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO!\u201d Her eyes widened and a smile spread across her angelic face while she pulled her hand back. \u201cThat\u2019s it! You must be THE Jon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Jon?\u201d Jon swallowed. All of a sudden he was not sure anymore if this girl knowing him was a good or a bad thing. Did he have a reputation? Were there rumors going around he knew nothing about?</p><p>The pretty girl rolled her eyes. \u201cAre you now telling me that my brother forced me to listen to all his stories about you, but never mentioned me in a conversation with you?\u201d She crossed her arms in front of her chest and cocked her head. In a weird way it was cute and attractive at once. \u201cI\u2019m Sansa, Sansa Stark. I\u2019m here to spend the holidays with my brother Robb. And, if I\u2019m not mistaken you\u2019re his dorm mate Jon.\u201d</p><p>Jon wasn\u2019t sure if this was the right moment to let out a sigh of relief or not. At least there was no weird story going around that was most likely not true, but he was not sure what Robb had told his sister about him.</p><p>And where that normally wouldn\u2019t have mattered, it now seemed to be one of the most important things in the world. </p><p>\u201cOnly good things, I hope?\u201d Jon swallowed and he scratched the back of his neck. </p><p>He and Robb were great friends and he couldn\u2019t have wished for a better dorm mate, but he did know that Robb sometimes thought he was boring or too intelligent for his own good. </p><p>Sansa licked her dry lips. \u201cYou know how Robb wears his heart on his tongue, but over all he pictured you as a very brave and intelligent young man.\u201d She grinned. \u201cOne who doesn\u2019t drink because he\u2019s not yet twenty-one. One who doesn\u2019t smoke because it increases the risks to catch countless of life threatening diseases. And one who has a job that actually benefits people in our society who barely get attention.\u201d</p><p>Jon left out a chuckle, partly because the whole fact that she seemed to know exactly who he was while he had no idea who she was made him feel uncomfortable, partly because strictly everything she knew about him was somehow correct. \u201cI sound kinda boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO no!\u201d Sansa raised her voice and shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely not how I\u2019ve always interpreted it!\u201d She placed a hand on his shoulder and it felt surprisingly comforting to have her touch him. \u201cIt\u2019s actually refreshing. There are already more than enough men in this world who think the key to masculinity is drinking too much and talking as many girls as possible into their beds.\u201d</p><p>Jon rolled his eyes. \u201cIf this speech ends with but you\u2019re different, it sounds like it walked straight out of a Jane Austen book.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\u2019s smile brightened and Jon felt his heart skip a few beats in his chest. \u201cRobb never told me you are into literature too.\u201d She cocked her head. \u201cYou\u2019re getting more and more interesting with every word you speak, Jon Snow.\u201d</p><p>For a moment Jon didn\u2019t know what to say. He felt a shiver, one of the good and pleasant kind, rolling down his spine and his entire skin tingled. If this really had been some kind of Jane Austen book, he would\u2019ve known the right thing to say. But he wasn\u2019t in a Jane Austen book and nothing even remotely good crossed his mind. </p><p>Instead he eventually decided to change the subject entirely. \u201cSo, you\u2019re here to spend the Christmas days with Robb?\u201d</p><p>Sansa nodded. \u201cAnd with you, it seems. I actually thought you would go home to your family, like most students do, but I\u2019m sure Robb won\u2019t mind me inviting you to our dinner too.\u201d</p><p>Jon bent his head and all of a sudden he saw his cargo bike still lying in the snow. He had almost forgotten about it. Quickly he bent down to grab his bike and once it stood up again he made sure to hold it firmly this time. \u201cYeah, if Robb doesn\u2019t mind, I\u2019d love to come over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming over then. I don\u2019t even care if he minds. No one should be alone with Christmas and especially not intelligent and charming young men like you.\u201d She winked and a pleasant warmth spread through his entire body. </p><p>Even if he had not worn a scarf, hat and gloves right now, he would have stopped noticing the cold. Who could be bothered by snow and wind and ice, when a beautiful girl like Sansa Stark delivered one compliment after the other? Who could be bothered by winter, when a pretty lady like Sansa Stark was there to warm your heart?</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d He cleared his throat and coughed. \u201cHow are you gonna get to campus?\u201d</p><p>In summer time it was a nice walk from the city centre to the campus, but with all the snow and cold right now it would be a long and nasty one. Especially on those high heeled boots Sansa was wearing. </p><p>\u201cI was planning on calling Robb to come and pick me up, but\u2026\u201d Sansa looked at the bike and raised her eyebrows. \u201cIf you have better ideas, I\u2019m all ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could\u2026\u201d Jon looked at his bike, at the pretty girl and back at his bike. \u201cYou can put your suitcases in the cargo and jump on the back?\u201d</p><p>It was not as comfortable and warm as a car, but it would save her some waiting time. And it would mean she would be very very close to him and forced to hold onto him very tightly. </p><p>\u201cThat sounds like an excellent idea!\u201d Sansa pecked his cheek, but before she could see how his cheeks colored a bright pink she already reached for her suitcases and threw them in the cargo. \u201cI\u2019m glad we\u2019ve met, Jon Snow.\u201d She waited until he swung one leg over his bike and stabilized it even more. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t wait to get to know you even better. It\u2019s going to be a wonderful Christmas time, I already feel it.\u201d</p><p>Jon smiled and he took a deep breath when she jumped on the back of his bike and wrapped her arms firmly around his waist. \u201cI hope you mean it\u2019s gonna be a great life.\u201d He murmured, but the wind did carry his words to the girl on the back of his bike anyway.</p><p>And Jon maybe couldn\u2019t see it. But she smiled. She smiled brightly and let her head rest to his back while she already envisioned their wedding day.</p></p>",

Luckily not all his customers acted like this and even more luckily he had delivered all meals for today and could finally return to his dorm, to the warmth and his astronomy homework. </p><p>When he had started his studies a few years ago student\u2019s life had all seemed very exciting. He had heard stories about the wild parties, the illegal drinking and the making friends for life. He had most of all heard that most people found their true love while being in college. </p><p>None of it had happened. Even among students astronomy was considered boring, which meant that his classmates didn\u2019t even wanna be found anywhere near a wild party and none of them would ever cross the line of illegal drinking. And that meant that the other students had simply stopped inviting them.</p><p>Even Robb Stark, his dorm mate, had stopped mentioning the parties as soon as he had discovered that Jon was not exactly the most interesting conversationalist to introduce to his football friends when they were drunk. Or actually, Jon was the most interesting conversationalist, which was exactly the problem.</p><p>If he had known that the real student life looked like this, he might have considered finding a normal job right away. That normal job couldn\u2019t possibly be worse that delivering meals to elder people who had too much money and no one who cared about them anymore.</p><p>He pulled his hat over his dark black curls and needed three attempts to get his gloves on. His student loan was barely enough to cover his rent and food, so he didn\u2019t have money for a motorbike or a car. Which meant that he was still stuck with his cargo bike, both in summer and winter.</p><p>It really was not as exciting as he had once imagined it to be. </p><p>But Jon didn\u2019t know that his entire life was about to be changed.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Just before Jon stepped on his bike to ride back to campus, a big yellow bus stopped at the bus sign. Normally the bus, that once a day brought people from this small middle of nowhere to the nearest big city and once a day made the trip backwards, arrived here empty, but today a girl carrying two suitcases stepped out. </p><p>She wore a white hat over her strawberry blond, or was it even red, hair. The hat barely covered her ears, but maybe the hat was not supposed to be functional. The dark black coat keeping her body warm at least looked far more expensive than anything Jon could ever pay for. Not to mention her bright red boots reaching her knee caps with a logo on it that in itself was already worth more than Jon had ever earned in his life.</p><p>But it was her smile that really made him lose his grip on his bike. Just when his jaw dropped, the cargo bike slipped from his hand, fell in the snow, bruised his ankles and tipped him over. It all happened within a few seconds, but it didn\u2019t really happen in silence. </p><p>The pretty red haired girl looked up and with her suitcases in her gloved hands she rushed towards him, kneeling down next to him as soon as she\u2019d reached him. \u201cIs everything alright?\u201d </p><p>Jon laid flat on his back in the ice cold snow with bruised ankles, but he still nodded. \u201cYeah, yeah\u2026\u201d He sat up and pushed his glasses a little further on his nose. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>The girl furrowed her eyebrows, but she didn\u2019t say anything and just watched him. \u201cDo we know each other?

It all happened within a few seconds, but it didn&rsquo;t really happen in silence. </p><p>The pretty red haired girl looked up and with her suitcases in her gloved hands she rushed towards him, kneeling down next to him as soon as she&rsquo;d reached him. &ldquo;Is everything alright?&rdquo; </p><p>Jon laid flat on his back in the ice cold snow with bruised ankles, but he still nodded. &ldquo;Yeah, yeah&hellip;&rdquo; He sat up and pushed his glasses a little further on his nose. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;</p><p>The girl furrowed her eyebrows, but she didn&rsquo;t say anything and just watched him. &ldquo;Do we know each other? For some reason I have the feeling we&rsquo;ve already met, but I have no idea where and when.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon shrugged and he stood up before he reached out his hand to help the girl stand up too. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure I would&rsquo;ve remembered it if we&rsquo;ve met.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t let go of her hand, but instead shook it a little awkwardly. &ldquo;Jon, Jon Snow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;O!&rdquo; Her eyes widened and a smile spread across her angelic face while she pulled her hand back. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! You must be THE Jon!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Jon?&rdquo; Jon swallowed. All of a sudden he was not sure anymore if this girl knowing him was a good or a bad thing. Did he have a reputation? Were there rumors going around he knew nothing about?</p><p>The pretty girl rolled her eyes. &ldquo;Are you now telling me that my brother forced me to listen to all his stories about you, but never mentioned me in a conversation with you?&rdquo; She crossed her arms in front of her chest and cocked her head. In a weird way it was cute and attractive at once. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Sansa, Sansa Stark. I&rsquo;m here to spend the holidays with my brother Robb. And, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken you&rsquo;re his dorm mate Jon.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon wasn&rsquo;t sure if this was the right moment to let out a sigh of relief or not. At least there was no weird story going around that was most likely not true, but he was not sure what Robb had told his sister about him.</p><p>And where that normally wouldn&rsquo;t have mattered, it now seemed to be one of the most important things in the world. </p><p>&ldquo;Only good things, I hope?&rdquo; Jon swallowed and he scratched the back of his neck. </p><p>He and Robb were great friends and he couldn&rsquo;t have wished for a better dorm mate, but he did know that Robb sometimes thought he was boring or too intelligent for his own good. </p><p>Sansa licked her dry lips. &ldquo;You know how Robb wears his heart on his tongue, but over all he pictured you as a very brave and intelligent young man.&rdquo; She grinned. &ldquo;One who doesn&rsquo;t drink because he&rsquo;s not yet twenty-one. One who doesn&rsquo;t smoke because it increases the risks to catch countless of life threatening diseases. And one who has a job that actually benefits people in our society who barely get attention.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon left out a chuckle, partly because the whole fact that she seemed to know exactly who he was while he had no idea who she was made him feel uncomfortable, partly because strictly everything she knew about him was somehow correct. &ldquo;I sound kinda boring.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;O no!&rdquo; Sansa raised her voice and shook her head. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s absolutely not how I&rsquo;ve always interpreted it!&rdquo; She placed a hand on his shoulder and it felt surprisingly comforting to have her touch him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually refreshing. There are already more than enough men in this world who think the key to masculinity is drinking too much and talking as many girls as possible into their beds.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon rolled his eyes. &ldquo;If this speech ends with but you&rsquo;re different, it sounds like it walked straight out of a Jane Austen book.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa&rsquo;s smile brightened and Jon felt his heart skip a few beats in his chest. &ldquo;Robb never told me you are into literature too.&rdquo; She cocked her head. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting more and more interesting with every word you speak, Jon Snow.&rdquo;</p><p>For a moment Jon didn&rsquo;t know what to say. He felt a shiver, one of the good and pleasant kind, rolling down his spine and his entire skin tingled. If this really had been some kind of Jane Austen book, he would&rsquo;ve known the right thing to say. But he wasn&rsquo;t in a Jane Austen book and nothing even remotely good crossed his mind. </p><p>Instead he eventually decided to change the subject entirely. &ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re here to spend the Christmas days with Robb?&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa nodded. &ldquo;And with you, it seems. I actually thought you would go home to your family, like most students do, but I&rsquo;m sure Robb won&rsquo;t mind me inviting you to our dinner too.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon bent his head and all of a sudden he saw his cargo bike still lying in the snow. He had almost forgotten about it. Quickly he bent down to grab his bike and once it stood up again he made sure to hold it firmly this time. &ldquo;Yeah, if Robb doesn&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;d love to come over.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re coming over then. I don&rsquo;t even care if he minds. No one should be alone with Christmas and especially not intelligent and charming young men like you.&rdquo; She winked and a pleasant warmth spread through his entire body. </p><p>Even if he had not worn a scarf, hat and gloves right now, he would have stopped noticing the cold. Who could be bothered by snow and wind and ice, when a beautiful girl like Sansa Stark delivered one compliment after the other? Who could be bothered by winter, when a pretty lady like Sansa Stark was there to warm your heart?</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip;&rdquo; He cleared his throat and coughed. &ldquo;How are you gonna get to campus?&rdquo;</p><p>In summer time it was a nice walk from the city centre to the campus, but with all the snow and cold right now it would be a long and nasty one. Especially on those high heeled boots Sansa was wearing. </p><p>&ldquo;I was planning on calling Robb to come and pick me up, but&hellip;&rdquo; Sansa looked at the bike and raised her eyebrows. &ldquo;If you have better ideas, I&rsquo;m all ears.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I could&hellip;&rdquo; Jon looked at his bike, at the pretty girl and back at his bike. &ldquo;You can put your suitcases in the cargo and jump on the back?&rdquo;</p><p>It was not as comfortable and warm as a car, but it would save her some waiting time. And it would mean she would be very very close to him and forced to hold onto him very tightly. </p><p>&ldquo;That sounds like an excellent idea!&rdquo; Sansa pecked his cheek, but before she could see how his cheeks colored a bright pink she already reached for her suitcases and threw them in the cargo. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;ve met, Jon Snow.&rdquo; She waited until he swung one leg over his bike and stabilized it even more. &ldquo;And I can&rsquo;t wait to get to know you even better. It&rsquo;s going to be a wonderful Christmas time, I already feel it.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon smiled and he took a deep breath when she jumped on the back of his bike and wrapped her arms firmly around his waist. &ldquo;I hope you mean it&rsquo;s gonna be a great life.&rdquo; He murmured, but the wind did carry his words to the girl on the back of his bike anyway.</p><p>And Jon maybe couldn&rsquo;t see it. But she smiled. She smiled brightly and let her head rest to his back while she already envisioned their wedding day.</p></p>",

Luckily not all his customers acted like this and even more luckily he had delivered all meals for today and could finally return to his dorm, to the warmth and his astronomy homework. </p>\n<p>When he had started his studies a few years ago student&rsquo;s life had all seemed very exciting. He had heard stories about the wild parties, the illegal drinking and the making friends for life. He had most of all heard that most people found their true love while being in college. </p>\n<p>None of it had happened. Even among students astronomy was considered boring, which meant that his classmates didn&rsquo;t even wanna be found anywhere near a wild party and none of them would ever cross the line of illegal drinking. And that meant that the other students had simply stopped inviting them.</p>\n<p>Even Robb Stark, his dorm mate, had stopped mentioning the parties as soon as he had discovered that Jon was not exactly the most interesting conversationalist to introduce to his football friends when they were drunk. Or actually, Jon was the most interesting conversationalist, which was exactly the problem.</p>\n<p>If he had known that the real student life looked like this, he might have considered finding a normal job right away. That normal job couldn&rsquo;t possibly be worse that delivering meals to elder people who had too much money and no one who cared about them anymore.</p>\n<p>He pulled his hat over his dark black curls and needed three attempts to get his gloves on. His student loan was barely enough to cover his rent and food, so he didn&rsquo;t have money for a motorbike or a car. Which meant that he was still stuck with his cargo bike, both in summer and winter.</p>\n<p>It really was not as exciting as he had once imagined it to be. </p>\n<p>But Jon didn&rsquo;t know that his entire life was about to be changed.</p>\n</p>",

I read a lot of analysis of the series and so often run into Sansa-hatred that is utterly bewildering and also, to me, demonstrates a lack of understanding of what GRRM set out to say, big picture, with the series. But a lot of people do hate her (for whatever reason) so I also really appreciate that, in various asks, you do not back down on your points about her.",
        "answer": "<p>Well, thanks! I understand gravitating initially more towards POVs like Arya and Tyrion, who at least partially see through the lies of the chivalric tropes undergirding the feudal power structures. (Partially, I emphasize.) But for me, Sansa is the best POV in AGOT because her early chapters provide such a ravishing image of the world through the eyes of someone who takes the songs 100% seriously. That\u2019s what makes the fall from grace that is that first book\u2019s primary subject (from Bran\u2019s very literal fall forward) work so well. You need the Hand\u2019s Tourney to start out \u201cbetter than the songs,\u201d or it doesn\u2019t <i>mean </i>anything when Ser Hugh dies and Sansa reflects that no songs will be sung of him. By the time you get to her final chapter in AGOT, it\u2019s so damn clear what GRRM is going for with her character: <b><br/></b></p><blockquote><p>Sansa stared at him, seeing him for the first time. He was wearing a \npadded crimson doublet patterned with lions and a cloth-of-gold cape \nwith a high collar that framed his face. She wondered how she could ever\n have thought him handsome. His lips were as soft and red as the worms \nyou found after a rain, and his eyes were vain and cruel. \u201cI hate you,\u201d she whispered.\n \u00a0\u00a0 <br/></p></blockquote><p>She has learned the truth: a padded crimson doublet and a cloth-of-gold cape don\u2019t make you a hero, which has implications for both the social structure (in that all this wealth and power is orbiting around a sadistic child who just cut off Dad\u2019s head) and the chivalric worldview (in that the imagery falling apart here bolstered that worldview earlier in the book). Sansa is literally seeing the world anew, and she has to start off in a bubble for that to qualify as an arc. <br/></p><p>Moreover, her story in the following book (ACOK) is not about her deciding that the corruption of the intertwined society and song justifies nihilism, but rather a growing conviction on her part that she has to live out the values in the songs even as they are rejected by the world at large. That comes through most clearly at the Blackwater, when she internally defies Cersei\u2019s rule through fear in favor of ruling through love, as well as singing for mercy to and from Sandor. I think this is meant to reflect the journey taken by both author and audience from naivete to disillusionment to resolve, and that it\u2019s also meant as a pointed contrast to Littlefinger\u2019s story, not a continuation of it. <br/></p>",

                "content": "<p>I can forgive George for not hating his more&hellip; unsavory male characters (he has no similar problem with characters like Cersei which is interesting) but calling him a bad boy when Sandor is almost 30 and when Sandor spent 2 books attracted to a preteen, it&rsquo;s not a good look. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not the first time we get a *dubious* relationship involving someone as young as Sansa (Rhaella at 12 and Bonifer at maybe hopefully but still ickily 16).&nbsp;</p><p>The thing is while George is obviously (when you really examine the text) critical of older characters preying on young children, he&rsquo;s also too subtle and he doesn&rsquo;t apply it across the board. He sexualises Dany and Elia Sand a lot and while he doesn&rsquo;t buy into ~romantic~ overtones of Sansa and Sandor, he goes on to give Sandor redemption, thereby retroactively cleansing the previous creepy behaviour Sandor display especially when combined with the Unkiss.</p><p>Not to mention his many child brides in a story that, like you said, seems to either consider them children in one part and grown women in others. This leads to fans assuming that the story doesn&rsquo;t call their favourite characters paedophiles which leads to further misinterpretation of canon events. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve heard people saying&nbsp;&lsquo;it&rsquo;s normal in Westeros&rsquo; when we bring up age differences. If GRRM can come out and talk about Dany&rsquo;s disastrous rule in Meereen because people don&rsquo;t see it as such, then he can come out and say,&nbsp;&ldquo;Feeling attraction to minors is paedophilia and something this story doesn&rsquo;t support.&rdquo; Then again if he did, will the Rhaegar x Lyanna mystery remain a mystery when the only conclusion is that Rhaegar preyed on a 14-15 year old?</p>",
