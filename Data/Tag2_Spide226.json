It had been an exhausting week with numerous amount of homework (it\u2019ll be this way in college get used to it now teachers said or claimed) You still had homework, but it wouldn\u2019t be due until the end of the next week, so Saturday was officially for you. </p><p>Your boyfriend of a year had promised you two would hang out at your place and watch a movie, but after his nightly activities. You knew Peter was Spider-man, an internet sensation everyone was crazy about including yourself. The only way you found out is because Peter has never been great at keeping secrets. He saw you on the street one time, and just waved, \u201cHey (y/n)!\u201d He yelled, completely forgetting he was Spider-Man and not another high school student who can nonchalantly say hi to their significant other. You were hella confused and had awkwardly waved back, recognizing his voice but not quite sure if you heard it right. </p><p>It took you all night before you had put two and two together. From those late nights he wouldn\u2019t answer your texts or would answer your text, weird bruises and aches he sometimes had, and his ability to climb through your window despite the fire escape being farther away from your 7th floor bedroom. And his <i>voice</i>. You quickly got to work and went to school the next day wearing custom made Spider-Man gear to see if he catches on that you know and he looked completely touched by the fact you were wearing it. </p><p>\u201cDid you- figure it out when I said hi to you?\u201d Peter asked one day underneath the bleachers during lunch before Ned came to join you two. You had smirked and said, \u201cI thought the point of the mask was for people to not know who you are, especially the ones you know.\u201d He blushed of embarrassment and you kissed him on the cheek and said, \u201cSecrets safe with me&hellip;\u201d with a wink. </p><!-- more --><p>It was after that when Peter would come to you after nearly every night patrol he did, he\u2019d come into your room in the full suit to tell you about his day, what he had done, what kind of crime he fought and other times he\u2019d come when he\u2019s injured. Those were the nights that worried you the most and made you lecture him on being much, much more careful. You didn\u2019t care if he\u2019d heal fast- he\u2019s <i>not invincible</i>.</p><p>You hadn\u2019t expected him in early today though, knowing he was spending the entire day with his Aunt May before going on \u201cpatrol\u201d. So you spent most your Saturday laying sround, sleeping on and off and texting Peter. Your mom was out all day working and you didn\u2019t expect your dad home till the next morning because he\u2019d just left for the graveyard shift. You were bored out of your mind after every favorite movie was watched and decided to clean up the mess in your room you ignored the past week. </p><p>An hour of picking up and vacuuming later, you then decided to organize your closet. That\u2019s when you found it- a medium sized white wooden jewelry box with flower and swan designs on it your mother had gifted to you when you were eight. After putting all your clothes back and some in a box, you sat down on your bed, legs crossed as you wound up the music and then opened the box, the melody of Swan Lake playing the moment you lifted the lid. You smiled at the swan figurine that slowly spun along to the music. A feeling of nostalgia bursted through you as you were reminded of being a child, humming the tune wherever you went and drawing swans randomly. Your eyes shifted to look at the contents inside, letting the music continue to play. </p><p>There was anything but jewelry in there, In there was instead a few notes you and your best friend from middle school used to give each other, filled with silly stuff and inside jokes. There was even old letters from a pen pal you had in 5th grade! Her name was Elizabeth and she was from the UK. About a half hour had passed with you reading through them when you eyes caught the light pink, folded paper that was at the very bottom. You picked it up, setting the others aside. </p><p>You flipped it around, not remembering what the letter was, what it contained or who it was for right until you saw the name \u201cPeter Parker\u201d with a heart around it. Instantly your eyes widened, the happy nostalgic memories being replaced with the cringey memory of that one afternoon on the bus ride home writing out your feelings for your new friend from Science class. You felt your cheeks heat up at the memory, and slowly small tidbits of what you wrote were coming back to you. </p><p>Just as you moved to open it, there was a sudden loud knock on your window. You jumped in your spot, the letter falling from your hand and you turned to see the man himself in his Spider-Man suit, waving at you and pointing at the window asking you to let him in. Instantly you relaxed and quickly shoved the letters back into the box and shut it, the room becoming silent.</p><p>Hopping to your feet, you went to unlock the window, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re here early did May-\u201c but your words got caught in your throat when you saw he was cut up and bleeding. He pulled his mask off, his brown locks of short hair sticking up in nearly every direction. </p><p>\u201cPeter what the hell!\u201d You cried, gently touching around a bruise on his left cheek and then looking down at his cut up suit to see the damage. It was pretty bad, but he just gave a pained toothy smile that you glared at, already knowing what he was going to say.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll heal- I dunno about the suit- but ill heal I just need to get kisses from you and lay down for a while and I\u2019ll be better in no time,\u201d he said, pecking your lips then walking passed you. You were baffled as he had one hand over his side and used the other to grab a towel to put over your bed before sitting down on it. You\u2019d honestly never seen him this hurt- you\u2019ve seen bruises, mega painful looking bruises, and few cuts but this was just bad. His <i>suit</i> was cut up. What kind of people did he run into for them to do that? He noticed you staring and sighed, \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking (y/n), but really I\u2019m okay! You should\u2019ve seen the other guys.\u201d He joked but you crossed your arms not amused.</p><p>\u201cOther guys? Looking at how you ended up- I can only assume you killed them,\u201d you said in a serious tone, but he laughed like it was a joke. When he saw you weren\u2019t laughing he let his head fall downwards for a moment. </p><p>\u201cCan you not lecture me right now- this really hurts,\u201d he motioned over his wounds and you sighed once more, hands falling to the side as he gave you those puppy dog eyes now. You didn\u2019t say anything as you wandered over to your door and went to retrieve some things to clean his wounds. He may heal pretty fast, but you\u2019ll be damned if he\u2019s going to lay there all bloodied up and in pain. Peter watched you go and pushed himself more onto the bed, before swinging his feet up and knocking over the music box on your bed. He raised a brow, and grabbed it, realizing it was a music box when he saw the wound up in the back. He opened it after twisting it, smiling at the soft tune that began to play out like you had done. He curiously looked at its contents and he would\u2019ve left it alone because it was clearly private if they were in a box, but his eyes caught sight of a \u201c-rker\u201d and when he moved the other papers he saw it was his name. Curiosity got the best of him as he pulled out the pink, folded sheet of paper and laughed softly when he saw it was his name written in your handwriting in the center of a near perfect looking heart. </p><p>He glanced at the door to see if you were coming back, and saw you still werent back so he gently opened it, seeing a full page of writing and a date at the top, Peter recognizing the year as freshman year, the year you transferred to Midtown High and the first year you met. He felt his heart warm up as he realized what this was.</p><p>It was a love letter.  </p><p><i>Dear Peter Parker, </i></p><p><i>I know we\u2019ve only just met, but every time I\u2019m around you I feel butterflies in my stomach and my heart races 100 beats per minute. You\u2019re very sweet, funny, and really smart and I couldn\u2019t help but feel these feelings for you even if we\u2019ve only known each other for a month or two. Everyday spent with you has been the best days of my life! I came to this school with no friends and dreaded having to have to do a partner project in biology. You were kind enough to sit by me and ask me to work with you. After that, I couldn\u2019t stop myself from falling in love with you. I feel silly for writing a letter, but I\u2019m not really good with words and I am not sure you feel the same. I\u2019m currently writing on the bus ride home, hoping to god the person behind me isn\u2019t looking over the seat. I would be so embarrassed! But- I really hope you do feel the same way, I\u2019ll be crushed if you didn\u2019t. Please don\u2019t think I\u2019m a fool for writing this letter </i></p><p><i>With love,</i></p><p><i>(y/n) </i></p><p>By the time Peter got to the end, the smile on his lips were so wide. He found this completely touching and adorable because it was dated about 3 months before you two even began to date towards the middle of freshman year. The fact that you already liked him so much before then also made him a bit giddy. </p><p>You had just gotten out from your parents bathroom, having been in there a while trying to find the first aid kit. When you walking back down the hall towards your bedroom you stopped when you heard Swan Lake. </p><p>\u201cOh&hellip;oh no-\u201c your heart dropped as you remember what was in that box and you ran into your room, eyes widen when you saw Peter holding the letter in his hands, \u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d The music ended on queue and Peter snapped his head in your direction, seeing your horrified expression. You set the first aid kit onto the dresser near the door and reached to take the note away from him but he dodged your hand, \u201cGive it! Please don\u2019t read it! It\u2019s from a year ago please Peter!\u201d You begged, \u201cI don\u2019t even know what\u2019s in it, it\u2019s probably horrible!\u201d Peter hadn\u2019t said anything, just smiling playfully and keeping the note away from you as you leaned over him, still being aware of his injuries. Although he\u2019d forgotten about his own injuries being distracted by your letter. He fell backwards and groaned in pain swinging his legs over the side of your bed. Your eyes widened. </p><p>\u201cI already read it by the way,\u201d Peter said, looking up at where you sat next to him, one leg crossed over the other, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t give it to me! We could\u2019ve been dating way sooner!\u201d You tilted your head, cheeks heating up as you snatched the letter from him and scanned over it quickly.</p><p>\u201cDear god no- this would\u2019ve slowed things down! This is so- so bad,\u201d you claimed and looked back at him with a major cringe on your face. Peter shook his head disagreeing with you, \u201cI barely knew you- are you telling me you wouldn\u2019t of been freaked out by this? It\u2019s kind of stalkerish.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNope!\u201d </p><p>You shook your head in disbelief, and looked back down at the paper, embarrassed by the horrible confession of love whereas Peter was grinning like a child next to you. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cute that you\u2019ve always had a crush on me,\u201d he teased you, you became flushed and began to fold the sides of the paper nervously, \u201chey, hey why are you so embarrassed? I liked you too you know.\u201d He admitted, pushing himself up now clenching his side lightly. You set the letter down and got the first aid kit.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m so embarrassed,\u201d you admitted as you took the same spot next to him, \u201cWe\u2019re literally dating. And I feel like I can\u2019t even look at you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell- you got what you wanted,\u201d Peter said as he tapped on the spider logo on his, his suit loosing up and falling off his shoulders to reveal the bloody wounds. Normally when he had his shirt off you wouldn\u2019t able to concentrate, no one should let the nerd demeanor throw them off, he was pretty built and it was nice. The wounds were your main focus, along with that embarrassing letter though, there was no time to ogle. </p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d You asked, a smirk on your lips as you got out the supplies, \u201cAnd what was it I wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me to return your feelings, thus us beginning to date, you got it all!\u201d he explained, wincing when you began to clean around his wounds, \u201cWhy did you never give me the letter? It was really sweet&hellip;\u201d he said in a strain voice, you pursed your lips together and looked at him. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I remember coming home that day and just setting it into the music box and never letting it see the light of day again.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThere must\u2019ve been a- ow,\u201d he closed his eyes and bit his bottom lip and you seized cleaning one of the bigger wounds, looking at him with a sorry look, \u201ca reason!\u201d You licked your lip as you began to think back to that day, and it suddenly hit you. You laughed sadly.</p><p>\u201cThe next day, I ran into this girl and she was crying. And I asked her what was wrong and she said that she sent a long text to her crush about how much she liked him and he completely ignored her, and that he wouldn\u2019t talk to her,\u201d you explained, Peter frowned, \u201cSo as you can tell&hellip;that really discouraged me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a damn jerk,\u201d Peter said raising a brow, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t of done that to you, I mean- look at us now-\u201c</p><p>\u201cMe cleaning up your wounds after a year of dating?\u201d You chirped and he smiled fondly. </p><p>\u201cWell- we could be doing more!\u201d He teased and wiggled his eyebrows and you rolled your eyes, \u201cWoah! I meant watching a movie together and cuddling! What were you thinking?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThere will be no cuddling because you\u2019re hurt,\u201d you gestured to his wounds and he scoffed and put out his bottom lip. You continued to clean up in wounds in silence, suppressing that smile on your lips. </p><p>When he was all clean and bandaged up, you dug into your extra clothes and handed him a pair of sweatpants and then gave him one of your large sweatshirts you wore in the colder weather. You helped him get it on, pulling the sweatshirt gently over his back and stomach. He wasn\u2019t hiding the fact that it hurt, and you pat the spot next to you. </p><p>\u201cThought we were going to watch a movie,\u201d he said, crawling next to you onto your bed and settling down facing you, propping his head up with his right arm. You shook your head. </p><p>\u201cM\u2019 kind of tired,\u201d you mumbled, fluffing your pillow. Peter blinked, and noticed that he was pretty tired too, Aunt May knew he was going over to your place, so sleeping over wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing. He leaned over, catching your lips into a kiss and with a cheeky grin he said, \u201cThank you for taking care of me (y/n), I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you. Everyday spent with you has been the best days of my life and I can\u2019t wait for more!\u201d Your eyes widen and you flicked him in the shoulder as he laughed loudly, falling into his back. You nuzzled your head into his arm, not wanting to lay on him due to his injuries.</p><p>\u201cEverything in that letter was true by the way, Peter.\u201d You said, closing your eyes. Peters eyes were already closed, but there was a smile on lips before both of you fell asleep. </p>",

You should\u2019ve seen the other guys.\u201d He joked but you crossed your arms not amused.</p><p>\u201cOther guys? Looking at how you ended up- I can only assume you killed them,\u201d you said in a serious tone, but he laughed like it was a joke. When he saw you weren\u2019t laughing he let his head fall downwards for a moment. </p><p>\u201cCan you not lecture me right now- this really hurts,\u201d he motioned over his wounds and you sighed once more, hands falling to the side as he gave you those puppy dog eyes now. You didn\u2019t say anything as you wandered over to your door and went to retrieve some things to clean his wounds. He may heal pretty fast, but you\u2019ll be damned if he\u2019s going to lay there all bloodied up and in pain. Peter watched you go and pushed himself more onto the bed, before swinging his feet up and knocking over the music box on your bed. He raised a brow, and grabbed it, realizing it was a music box when he saw the wound up in the back. He opened it after twisting it, smiling at the soft tune that began to play out like you had done. He curiously looked at its contents and he would\u2019ve left it alone because it was clearly private if they were in a box, but his eyes caught sight of a \u201c-rker\u201d and when he moved the other papers he saw it was his name. Curiosity got the best of him as he pulled out the pink, folded sheet of paper and laughed softly when he saw it was his name written in your handwriting in the center of a near perfect looking heart. </p><p>He glanced at the door to see if you were coming back, and saw you still werent back so he gently opened it, seeing a full page of writing and a date at the top, Peter recognizing the year as freshman year, the year you transferred to Midtown High and the first year you met. He felt his heart warm up as he realized what this was.</p><p>It was a love letter.  </p><p><i>Dear Peter Parker, </i></p><p><i>I know we\u2019ve only just met, but every time I\u2019m around you I feel butterflies in my stomach and my heart races 100 beats per minute. You\u2019re very sweet, funny, and really smart and I couldn\u2019t help but feel these feelings for you even if we\u2019ve only known each other for a month or two. Everyday spent with you has been the best days of my life! I came to this school with no friends and dreaded having to have to do a partner project in biology. You were kind enough to sit by me and ask me to work with you. After that, I couldn\u2019t stop myself from falling in love with you. I feel silly for writing a letter, but I\u2019m not really good with words and I am not sure you feel the same. I\u2019m currently writing on the bus ride home, hoping to god the person behind me isn\u2019t looking over the seat. I would be so embarrassed! But- I really hope you do feel the same way, I\u2019ll be crushed if you didn\u2019t. Please don\u2019t think I\u2019m a fool for writing this letter </i></p><p><i>With love,</i></p><p><i>(y/n) </i></p><p>By the time Peter got to the end, the smile on his lips were so wide. He found this completely touching and adorable because it was dated about 3 months before you two even began to date towards the middle of freshman year. The fact that you already liked him so much before then also made him a bit giddy. </p><p>You had just gotten out from your parents bathroom, having been in there a while trying to find the first aid kit. When you walking back down the hall towards your bedroom you stopped when you heard Swan Lake. </p><p>\u201cOh\u2026oh no-\u201c your heart dropped as you remember what was in that box and you ran into your room, eyes widen when you saw Peter holding the letter in his hands, \u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d The music ended on queue and Peter snapped his head in your direction, seeing your horrified expression. You set the first aid kit onto the dresser near the door and reached to take the note away from him but he dodged your hand, \u201cGive it! Please don\u2019t read it! It\u2019s from a year ago please Peter!\u201d You begged, \u201cI don\u2019t even know what\u2019s in it, it\u2019s probably horrible!\u201d Peter hadn\u2019t said anything, just smiling playfully and keeping the note away from you as you leaned over him, still being aware of his injuries. Although he\u2019d forgotten about his own injuries being distracted by your letter. He fell backwards and groaned in pain swinging his legs over the side of your bed. Your eyes widened. </p><p>\u201cI already read it by the way,\u201d Peter said, looking up at where you sat next to him, one leg crossed over the other, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t give it to me! We could\u2019ve been dating way sooner!\u201d You tilted your head, cheeks heating up as you snatched the letter from him and scanned over it quickly.</p><p>\u201cDear god no- this would\u2019ve slowed things down! This is so- so bad,\u201d you claimed and looked back at him with a major cringe on your face. Peter shook his head disagreeing with you, \u201cI barely knew you- are you telling me you wouldn\u2019t of been freaked out by this? It\u2019s kind of stalkerish.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNope!\u201d </p><p>You shook your head in disbelief, and looked back down at the paper, embarrassed by the horrible confession of love whereas Peter was grinning like a child next to you. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cute that you\u2019ve always had a crush on me,\u201d he teased you, you became flushed and began to fold the sides of the paper nervously, \u201chey, hey why are you so embarrassed? I liked you too you know.\u201d He admitted, pushing himself up now clenching his side lightly. You set the letter down and got the first aid kit.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m so embarrassed,\u201d you admitted as you took the same spot next to him, \u201cWe\u2019re literally dating. And I feel like I can\u2019t even look at you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell- you got what you wanted,\u201d Peter said as he tapped on the spider logo on his, his suit loosing up and falling off his shoulders to reveal the bloody wounds. Normally when he had his shirt off you wouldn\u2019t able to concentrate, no one should let the nerd demeanor throw them off, he was pretty built and it was nice. The wounds were your main focus, along with that embarrassing letter though, there was no time to ogle. </p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d You asked, a smirk on your lips as you got out the supplies, \u201cAnd what was it I wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me to return your feelings, thus us beginning to date, you got it all!\u201d he explained, wincing when you began to clean around his wounds, \u201cWhy did you never give me the letter? It was really sweet\u2026\u201d he said in a strain voice, you pursed your lips together and looked at him. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I remember coming home that day and just setting it into the music box and never letting it see the light of day again.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThere must\u2019ve been a- ow,\u201d he closed his eyes and bit his bottom lip and you seized cleaning one of the bigger wounds, looking at him with a sorry look, \u201ca reason!\u201d You licked your lip as you began to think back to that day, and it suddenly hit you. You laughed sadly.</p><p>\u201cThe next day, I ran into this girl and she was crying. And I asked her what was wrong and she said that she sent a long text to her crush about how much she liked him and he completely ignored her, and that he wouldn\u2019t talk to her,\u201d you explained, Peter frowned, \u201cSo as you can tell\u2026that really discouraged me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a damn jerk,\u201d Peter said raising a brow, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t of done that to you, I mean- look at us now-\u201c</p><p>\u201cMe cleaning up your wounds after a year of dating?\u201d You chirped and he smiled fondly. </p><p>\u201cWell- we could be doing more!\u201d He teased and wiggled his eyebrows and you rolled your eyes, \u201cWoah! I meant watching a movie together and cuddling! What were you thinking?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThere will be no cuddling because you\u2019re hurt,\u201d you gestured to his wounds and he scoffed and put out his bottom lip. You continued to clean up in wounds in silence, suppressing that smile on your lips. </p><p>When he was all clean and bandaged up, you dug into your extra clothes and handed him a pair of sweatpants and then gave him one of your large sweatshirts you wore in the colder weather. You helped him get it on, pulling the sweatshirt gently over his back and stomach. He wasn\u2019t hiding the fact that it hurt, and you pat the spot next to you. </p><p>\u201cThought we were going to watch a movie,\u201d he said, crawling next to you onto your bed and settling down facing you, propping his head up with his right arm. You shook your head. </p><p>\u201cM\u2019 kind of tired,\u201d you mumbled, fluffing your pillow. Peter blinked, and noticed that he was pretty tired too, Aunt May knew he was going over to your place, so sleeping over wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing. He leaned over, catching your lips into a kiss and with a cheeky grin he said, \u201cThank you for taking care of me (y/n), I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you. Everyday spent with you has been the best days of my life and I can\u2019t wait for more!\u201d Your eyes widen and you flicked him in the shoulder as he laughed loudly, falling into his back. You nuzzled your head into his arm, not wanting to lay on him due to his injuries.</p><p>\u201cEverything in that letter was true by the way, Peter.\u201d You said, closing your eyes. Peters eyes were already closed, but there was a smile on lips before both of you fell asleep. </p></p>",

It had been an exhausting week with numerous amount of homework (it\u2019ll be this way in college get used to it now teachers said or claimed) You still had homework, but it wouldn\u2019t be due until the end of the next week, so Saturday was officially for you. </p><p>Your boyfriend of a year had promised you two would hang out at your place and watch a movie, but after his nightly activities. You knew Peter was Spider-man, an internet sensation everyone was crazy about including yourself. The only way you found out is because Peter has never been great at keeping secrets. He saw you on the street one time, and just waved, \u201cHey (y/n)!\u201d He yelled, completely forgetting he was Spider-Man and not another high school student who can nonchalantly say hi to their significant other. You were hella confused and had awkwardly waved back, recognizing his voice but not quite sure if you heard it right. </p><p>It took you all night before you had put two and two together. From those late nights he wouldn\u2019t answer your texts or would answer your text, weird bruises and aches he sometimes had, and his ability to climb through your window despite the fire escape being farther away from your 7th floor bedroom. And his <i>voice</i>. You quickly got to work and went to school the next day wearing custom made Spider-Man gear to see if he catches on that you know and he looked completely touched by the fact you were wearing it. </p><p>\u201cDid you- figure it out when I said hi to you?\u201d Peter asked one day underneath the bleachers during lunch before Ned came to join you two. You had smirked and said, \u201cI thought the point of the mask was for people to not know who you are, especially the ones you know.\u201d He blushed of embarrassment and you kissed him on the cheek and said, \u201cSecrets safe with me\u2026\u201d with a wink. </p>[[MORE]]<p>It was after that when Peter would come to you after nearly every night patrol he did, he\u2019d come into your room in the full suit to tell you about his day, what he had done, what kind of crime he fought and other times he\u2019d come when he\u2019s injured. Those were the nights that worried you the most and made you lecture him on being much, much more careful. You didn\u2019t care if he\u2019d heal fast- he\u2019s <i>not invincible</i>.</p><p>You hadn\u2019t expected him in early today though, knowing he was spending the entire day with his Aunt May before going on \u201cpatrol\u201d. So you spent most your Saturday laying sround, sleeping on and off and texting Peter. Your mom was out all day working and you didn\u2019t expect your dad home till the next morning because he\u2019d just left for the graveyard shift. You were bored out of your mind after every favorite movie was watched and decided to clean up the mess in your room you ignored the past week. </p><p>An hour of picking up and vacuuming later, you then decided to organize your closet. That\u2019s when you found it- a medium sized white wooden jewelry box with flower and swan designs on it your mother had gifted to you when you were eight. After putting all your clothes back and some in a box, you sat down on your bed, legs crossed as you wound up the music and then opened the box, the melody of Swan Lake playing the moment you lifted the lid. You smiled at the swan figurine that slowly spun along to the music. A feeling of nostalgia bursted through you as you were reminded of being a child, humming the tune wherever you went and drawing swans randomly. Your eyes shifted to look at the contents inside, letting the music continue to play. </p><p>There was anything but jewelry in there, In there was instead a few notes you and your best friend from middle school used to give each other, filled with silly stuff and inside jokes. There was even old letters from a pen pal you had in 5th grade! Her name was Elizabeth and she was from the UK. About a half hour had passed with you reading through them when you eyes caught the light pink, folded paper that was at the very bottom. You picked it up, setting the others aside. </p><p>You flipped it around, not remembering what the letter was, what it contained or who it was for right until you saw the name \u201cPeter Parker\u201d with a heart around it. Instantly your eyes widened, the happy nostalgic memories being replaced with the cringey memory of that one afternoon on the bus ride home writing out your feelings for your new friend from Science class. You felt your cheeks heat up at the memory, and slowly small tidbits of what you wrote were coming back to you. </p><p>Just as you moved to open it, there was a sudden loud knock on your window. You jumped in your spot, the letter falling from your hand and you turned to see the man himself in his Spider-Man suit, waving at you and pointing at the window asking you to let him in. Instantly you relaxed and quickly shoved the letters back into the box and shut it, the room becoming silent.</p><p>Hopping to your feet, you went to unlock the window, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re here early did May-\u201c but your words got caught in your throat when you saw he was cut up and bleeding. He pulled his mask off, his brown locks of short hair sticking up in nearly every direction. </p><p>\u201cPeter what the hell!\u201d You cried, gently touching around a bruise on his left cheek and then looking down at his cut up suit to see the damage. It was pretty bad, but he just gave a pained toothy smile that you glared at, already knowing what he was going to say.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll heal- I dunno about the suit- but ill heal I just need to get kisses from you and lay down for a while and I\u2019ll be better in no time,\u201d he said, pecking your lips then walking passed you. You were baffled as he had one hand over his side and used the other to grab a towel to put over your bed before sitting down on it. You\u2019d honestly never seen him this hurt- you\u2019ve seen bruises, mega painful looking bruises, and few cuts but this was just bad. His <i>suit</i> was cut up. What kind of people did he run into for them to do that? He noticed you staring and sighed, \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking (y/n), but really I\u2019m okay! You should\u2019ve seen the other guys.\u201d He joked but you crossed your arms not amused.</p><p>\u201cOther guys? Looking at how you ended up- I can only assume you killed them,\u201d you said in a serious tone, but he laughed like it was a joke. When he saw you weren\u2019t laughing he let his head fall downwards for a moment. </p><p>\u201cCan you not lecture me right now- this really hurts,\u201d he motioned over his wounds and you sighed once more, hands falling to the side as he gave you those puppy dog eyes now. You didn\u2019t say anything as you wandered over to your door and went to retrieve some things to clean his wounds. He may heal pretty fast, but you\u2019ll be damned if he\u2019s going to lay there all bloodied up and in pain. Peter watched you go and pushed himself more onto the bed, before swinging his feet up and knocking over the music box on your bed. He raised a brow, and grabbed it, realizing it was a music box when he saw the wound up in the back. He opened it after twisting it, smiling at the soft tune that began to play out like you had done. He curiously looked at its contents and he would\u2019ve left it alone because it was clearly private if they were in a box, but his eyes caught sight of a \u201c-rker\u201d and when he moved the other papers he saw it was his name. Curiosity got the best of him as he pulled out the pink, folded sheet of paper and laughed softly when he saw it was his name written in your handwriting in the center of a near perfect looking heart. </p><p>He glanced at the door to see if you were coming back, and saw you still werent back so he gently opened it, seeing a full page of writing and a date at the top, Peter recognizing the year as freshman year, the year you transferred to Midtown High and the first year you met. He felt his heart warm up as he realized what this was.</p><p>It was a love letter.  </p><p><i>Dear Peter Parker, </i></p><p><i>I know we\u2019ve only just met, but every time I\u2019m around you I feel butterflies in my stomach and my heart races 100 beats per minute.

The wounds were your main focus, along with that embarrassing letter though, there was no time to ogle. </p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d You asked, a smirk on your lips as you got out the supplies, \u201cAnd what was it I wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me to return your feelings, thus us beginning to date, you got it all!\u201d he explained, wincing when you began to clean around his wounds, \u201cWhy did you never give me the letter? It was really sweet\u2026\u201d he said in a strain voice, you pursed your lips together and looked at him. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I remember coming home that day and just setting it into the music box and never letting it see the light of day again.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThere must\u2019ve been a- ow,\u201d he closed his eyes and bit his bottom lip and you seized cleaning one of the bigger wounds, looking at him with a sorry look, \u201ca reason!\u201d You licked your lip as you began to think back to that day, and it suddenly hit you. You laughed sadly.</p><p>\u201cThe next day, I ran into this girl and she was crying. And I asked her what was wrong and she said that she sent a long text to her crush about how much she liked him and he completely ignored her, and that he wouldn\u2019t talk to her,\u201d you explained, Peter frowned, \u201cSo as you can tell\u2026that really discouraged me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a damn jerk,\u201d Peter said raising a brow, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t of done that to you, I mean- look at us now-\u201c</p><p>\u201cMe cleaning up your wounds after a year of dating?\u201d You chirped and he smiled fondly. </p><p>\u201cWell- we could be doing more!\u201d He teased and wiggled his eyebrows and you rolled your eyes, \u201cWoah! I meant watching a movie together and cuddling! What were you thinking?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThere will be no cuddling because you\u2019re hurt,\u201d you gestured to his wounds and he scoffed and put out his bottom lip. You continued to clean up in wounds in silence, suppressing that smile on your lips. </p><p>When he was all clean and bandaged up, you dug into your extra clothes and handed him a pair of sweatpants and then gave him one of your large sweatshirts you wore in the colder weather. You helped him get it on, pulling the sweatshirt gently over his back and stomach. He wasn\u2019t hiding the fact that it hurt, and you pat the spot next to you. </p><p>\u201cThought we were going to watch a movie,\u201d he said, crawling next to you onto your bed and settling down facing you, propping his head up with his right arm. You shook your head. </p><p>\u201cM\u2019 kind of tired,\u201d you mumbled, fluffing your pillow. Peter blinked, and noticed that he was pretty tired too, Aunt May knew he was going over to your place, so sleeping over wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing. He leaned over, catching your lips into a kiss and with a cheeky grin he said, \u201cThank you for taking care of me (y/n), I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you. Everyday spent with you has been the best days of my life and I can\u2019t wait for more!\u201d Your eyes widen and you flicked him in the shoulder as he laughed loudly, falling into his back. You nuzzled your head into his arm, not wanting to lay on him due to his injuries.</p><p>\u201cEverything in that letter was true by the way, Peter.\u201d You said, closing your eyes. Peters eyes were already closed, but there was a smile on lips before both of you fell asleep. </p></p>",

It had been an exhausting week with numerous amount of homework (it&rsquo;ll be this way in college get used to it now teachers said or claimed) You still had homework, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be due until the end of the next week, so Saturday was officially for you. </p><p>Your boyfriend of a year had promised you two would hang out at your place and watch a movie, but after his nightly activities. You knew Peter was Spider-man, an internet sensation everyone was crazy about including yourself. The only way you found out is because Peter has never been great at keeping secrets. He saw you on the street one time, and just waved, &ldquo;Hey (y/n)!&rdquo; He yelled, completely forgetting he was Spider-Man and not another high school student who can nonchalantly say hi to their significant other. You were hella confused and had awkwardly waved back, recognizing his voice but not quite sure if you heard it right. </p><p>It took you all night before you had put two and two together. From those late nights he wouldn&rsquo;t answer your texts or would answer your text, weird bruises and aches he sometimes had, and his ability to climb through your window despite the fire escape being farther away from your 7th floor bedroom. And his <i>voice</i>. You quickly got to work and went to school the next day wearing custom made Spider-Man gear to see if he catches on that you know and he looked completely touched by the fact you were wearing it. </p><p>&ldquo;Did you- figure it out when I said hi to you?&rdquo; Peter asked one day underneath the bleachers during lunch before Ned came to join you two. You had smirked and said, &ldquo;I thought the point of the mask was for people to not know who you are, especially the ones you know.&rdquo; He blushed of embarrassment and you kissed him on the cheek and said, &ldquo;Secrets safe with me&hellip;&rdquo; with a wink. </p><p>It was after that when Peter would come to you after nearly every night patrol he did, he&rsquo;d come into your room in the full suit to tell you about his day, what he had done, what kind of crime he fought and other times he&rsquo;d come when he&rsquo;s injured. Those were the nights that worried you the most and made you lecture him on being much, much more careful. You didn&rsquo;t care if he&rsquo;d heal fast- he&rsquo;s <i>not invincible</i>.</p><p>You hadn&rsquo;t expected him in early today though, knowing he was spending the entire day with his Aunt May before going on &ldquo;patrol&rdquo;. So you spent most your Saturday laying sround, sleeping on and off and texting Peter. Your mom was out all day working and you didn&rsquo;t expect your dad home till the next morning because he&rsquo;d just left for the graveyard shift. You were bored out of your mind after every favorite movie was watched and decided to clean up the mess in your room you ignored the past week. </p><p>An hour of picking up and vacuuming later, you then decided to organize your closet. That&rsquo;s when you found it- a medium sized white wooden jewelry box with flower and swan designs on it your mother had gifted to you when you were eight. After putting all your clothes back and some in a box, you sat down on your bed, legs crossed as you wound up the music and then opened the box, the melody of Swan Lake playing the moment you lifted the lid. You smiled at the swan figurine that slowly spun along to the music. A feeling of nostalgia bursted through you as you were reminded of being a child, humming the tune wherever you went and drawing swans randomly. Your eyes shifted to look at the contents inside, letting the music continue to play. </p><p>There was anything but jewelry in there, In there was instead a few notes you and your best friend from middle school used to give each other, filled with silly stuff and inside jokes. There was even old letters from a pen pal you had in 5th grade! Her name was Elizabeth and she was from the UK. About a half hour had passed with you reading through them when you eyes caught the light pink, folded paper that was at the very bottom. You picked it up, setting the others aside. </p><p>You flipped it around, not remembering what the letter was, what it contained or who it was for right until you saw the name &ldquo;Peter Parker&rdquo; with a heart around it. Instantly your eyes widened, the happy nostalgic memories being replaced with the cringey memory of that one afternoon on the bus ride home writing out your feelings for your new friend from Science class. You felt your cheeks heat up at the memory, and slowly small tidbits of what you wrote were coming back to you. </p><p>Just as you moved to open it, there was a sudden loud knock on your window. You jumped in your spot, the letter falling from your hand and you turned to see the man himself in his Spider-Man suit, waving at you and pointing at the window asking you to let him in. Instantly you relaxed and quickly shoved the letters back into the box and shut it, the room becoming silent.</p><p>Hopping to your feet, you went to unlock the window, saying, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re here early did May-&ldquo; but your words got caught in your throat when you saw he was cut up and bleeding. He pulled his mask off, his brown locks of short hair sticking up in nearly every direction. </p><p>&ldquo;Peter what the hell!&rdquo; You cried, gently touching around a bruise on his left cheek and then looking down at his cut up suit to see the damage. It was pretty bad, but he just gave a pained toothy smile that you glared at, already knowing what he was going to say.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll heal- I dunno about the suit- but ill heal I just need to get kisses from you and lay down for a while and I&rsquo;ll be better in no time,&rdquo; he said, pecking your lips then walking passed you. You were baffled as he had one hand over his side and used the other to grab a towel to put over your bed before sitting down on it. You&rsquo;d honestly never seen him this hurt- you&rsquo;ve seen bruises, mega painful looking bruises, and few cuts but this was just bad. His <i>suit</i> was cut up. What kind of people did he run into for them to do that? He noticed you staring and sighed, &ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re thinking (y/n), but really I&rsquo;m okay! You should&rsquo;ve seen the other guys.&rdquo; He joked but you crossed your arms not amused.</p><p>&ldquo;Other guys? Looking at how you ended up- I can only assume you killed them,&rdquo; you said in a serious tone, but he laughed like it was a joke. When he saw you weren&rsquo;t laughing he let his head fall downwards for a moment. </p><p>&ldquo;Can you not lecture me right now- this really hurts,&rdquo; he motioned over his wounds and you sighed once more, hands falling to the side as he gave you those puppy dog eyes now. You didn&rsquo;t say anything as you wandered over to your door and went to retrieve some things to clean his wounds. He may heal pretty fast, but you&rsquo;ll be damned if he&rsquo;s going to lay there all bloodied up and in pain. Peter watched you go and pushed himself more onto the bed, before swinging his feet up and knocking over the music box on your bed. He raised a brow, and grabbed it, realizing it was a music box when he saw the wound up in the back. He opened it after twisting it, smiling at the soft tune that began to play out like you had done. He curiously looked at its contents and he would&rsquo;ve left it alone because it was clearly private if they were in a box, but his eyes caught sight of a &ldquo;-rker&rdquo; and when he moved the other papers he saw it was his name. Curiosity got the best of him as he pulled out the pink, folded sheet of paper and laughed softly when he saw it was his name written in your handwriting in the center of a near perfect looking heart. </p><p>He glanced at the door to see if you were coming back, and saw you still werent back so he gently opened it, seeing a full page of writing and a date at the top, Peter recognizing the year as freshman year, the year you transferred to Midtown High and the first year you met. He felt his heart warm up as he realized what this was.</p><p>It was a love letter.  </p><p><i>Dear Peter Parker, </i></p><p><i>I know we&rsquo;ve only just met, but every time I&rsquo;m around you I feel butterflies in my stomach and my heart races 100 beats per minute. You&rsquo;re very sweet, funny, and really smart and I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel these feelings for you even if we&rsquo;ve only known each other for a month or two. Everyday spent with you has been the best days of my life! I came to this school with no friends and dreaded having to have to do a partner project in biology. You were kind enough to sit by me and ask me to work with you. After that, I couldn&rsquo;t stop myself from falling in love with you. I feel silly for writing a letter, but I&rsquo;m not really good with words and I am not sure you feel the same. I&rsquo;m currently writing on the bus ride home, hoping to god the person behind me isn&rsquo;t looking over the seat. I would be so embarrassed! But- I really hope you do feel the same way, I&rsquo;ll be crushed if you didn&rsquo;t. Please don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m a fool for writing this letter </i></p><p><i>With love,</i></p><p><i>(y/n) </i></p><p>By the time Peter got to the end, the smile on his lips were so wide. He found this completely touching and adorable because it was dated about 3 months before you two even began to date towards the middle of freshman year. The fact that you already liked him so much before then also made him a bit giddy. </p><p>You had just gotten out from your parents bathroom, having been in there a while trying to find the first aid kit. When you walking back down the hall towards your bedroom you stopped when you heard Swan Lake. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip;oh no-&ldquo; your heart dropped as you remember what was in that box and you ran into your room, eyes widen when you saw Peter holding the letter in his hands, &ldquo;What are you doing?!&rdquo; The music ended on queue and Peter snapped his head in your direction, seeing your horrified expression. You set the first aid kit onto the dresser near the door and reached to take the note away from him but he dodged your hand, &ldquo;Give it! Please don&rsquo;t read it! It&rsquo;s from a year ago please Peter!&rdquo; You begged, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know what&rsquo;s in it, it&rsquo;s probably horrible!&rdquo; Peter hadn&rsquo;t said anything, just smiling playfully and keeping the note away from you as you leaned over him, still being aware of his injuries. Although he&rsquo;d forgotten about his own injuries being distracted by your letter. He fell backwards and groaned in pain swinging his legs over the side of your bed. Your eyes widened. </p><p>&ldquo;I already read it by the way,&rdquo; Peter said, looking up at where you sat next to him, one leg crossed over the other, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you didn&rsquo;t give it to me! We could&rsquo;ve been dating way sooner!&rdquo; You tilted your head, cheeks heating up as you snatched the letter from him and scanned over it quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;Dear god no- this would&rsquo;ve slowed things down! This is so- so bad,&rdquo; you claimed and looked back at him with a major cringe on your face. Peter shook his head disagreeing with you, &ldquo;I barely knew you- are you telling me you wouldn&rsquo;t of been freaked out by this? It&rsquo;s kind of stalkerish.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Nope!&rdquo; </p><p>You shook your head in disbelief, and looked back down at the paper, embarrassed by the horrible confession of love whereas Peter was grinning like a child next to you. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s cute that you&rsquo;ve always had a crush on me,&rdquo; he teased you, you became flushed and began to fold the sides of the paper nervously, &ldquo;hey, hey why are you so embarrassed? I liked you too you know.&rdquo; He admitted, pushing himself up now clenching his side lightly. You set the letter down and got the first aid kit.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m so embarrassed,&rdquo; you admitted as you took the same spot next to him, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re literally dating. And I feel like I can&rsquo;t even look at you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well- you got what you wanted,&rdquo; Peter said as he tapped on the spider logo on his, his suit loosing up and falling off his shoulders to reveal the bloody wounds. Normally when he had his shirt off you wouldn&rsquo;t able to concentrate, no one should let the nerd demeanor throw them off, he was pretty built and it was nice. The wounds were your main focus, along with that embarrassing letter though, there was no time to ogle. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah?&rdquo; You asked, a smirk on your lips as you got out the supplies, &ldquo;And what was it I wanted?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For me to return your feelings, thus us beginning to date, you got it all!&rdquo; he explained, wincing when you began to clean around his wounds, &ldquo;Why did you never give me the letter? It was really sweet&hellip;&rdquo; he said in a strain voice, you pursed your lips together and looked at him. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I remember coming home that day and just setting it into the music box and never letting it see the light of day again.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;There must&rsquo;ve been a- ow,&rdquo; he closed his eyes and bit his bottom lip and you seized cleaning one of the bigger wounds, looking at him with a sorry look, &ldquo;a reason!&rdquo; You licked your lip as you began to think back to that day, and it suddenly hit you. You laughed sadly.</p><p>&ldquo;The next day, I ran into this girl and she was crying.
