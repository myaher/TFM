What makes this issue even worse is how the series, via Arya, goes on about Sansa being the smartest woman she&rsquo;s knows, and fans talking about how well Sansa plays the game.</p><p>Lets unpack this, Sansa had a handful of moments where she was smart, but her surviving as long as she did was due to others; whether it be because of promises they made to others, their natural inclinations to protect young girls, or because of their deprived feelings. This isn&rsquo;t to say that Sansa is an idiot and lacks any smarts, but even that LF situation is questionable. We\u2019ve seen nothing that shows that Sansa is the smartest woman in the series (or person) or that she has the acumen to play the game on the level of a high player. If Sansa operated like Margaery, I\u2019d believe those claims, but she doesn\u2019t.\u00a0</p><p>And how she is dealing with Dany, proves this even more.\u00a0</p><p>What purpose does it serve to be openly antagonistic to Dany? What purpose does it serve to actively undermine someone as a war against the undead looms. Fans say that Dany could be mad and Sansa knows how fucked up the royals are, which makes her antagonism even more groan worthy.\u00a0</p><p>Dany has fucking dragons.\u00a0</p><p>Why would you antagonize someone with dragons because you distrust them?</p><p>Instead of questioning Dany in front of other Lords, she should\u2019ve done like Dany did and talk privately with her&ndash;as Dany did with Jon.</p><p>People also cite Sansa\u2019s past abuse, but let\u2019s keep in mind that Sansa wouldn\u2019t tolerate disrespect from someone beneath her either&ndash;she\u2019d also be demanding respect as well. No matter how distrustful you are, that doesn\u2019t mean question them in public and behave standoff-ish. I mean, it\u2019d make sense for her not to do this if she was the smart and politically savvy person she\u2019s said to be, right???\u00a0</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t pull this shit with Cersei and only is doing it because she knows Dany and Jon has something going on. And I don\u2019t believe she believes Dany is this mad woman either.</p><p>Let\u2019s circle back to the abuse. I notice that people keep framing Dany and Sansa in an oppressor/oppressed light as if Sansa has only known nothing, but struggle and her entire life and as if she is the only one.</p><p>Before people get upset, hear me out: Sansa grew up with privilege, which was yanked away from her. She was then held as prison, forced to marry, and eventually raped and tortured, in addition to seeing her father get beheaded. That\u2019s fucked up. But, let\u2019s not forget Dany\u2019s origin story: she was a poor orphan raised on the streets and abused by her brother. Married away without her consent, raped, lost her husband and child, and was rendered barren.</p><p>I\u2019m not comparing to show who has it worse, but rather, to show that they both been through some fucked up shit. Just because Dany is in a position of extreme power now doesn\u2019t mean she hasn\u2019t had her own trials and tribulations to get where she is now. Nothing was handed to her. She fought for everything she has.</p><p>My problem isn&rsquo;t that Sansa distrusts Dany, it\u2019s that Sansa isn\u2019t being the cunning or savvy person the series and fans claims she is.\u00a0</p><p>Jon wasn\u2019t an idiot for bending knee to Dany. Outside of Dany, he is one of the few people who truly understand what they are battling. Jon is trying to save humanity not battle over a title and power that comes with it.</p><p>Jon also doesn&rsquo;t have to consult with Sansa either just like Sansa wouldn\u2019t have to consult with Jon if the shoe was on the other foot. I think Sansa is driven by wanting the greater good for the North, but she\u2019s also more so driven by having power to protect herself. That\u2019s reasonable, but she is playing her hand all wrong.</p><p>There are people who say that Dany should\u2019ve handled her entrance into Winterfell differently and&hellip;maybe. But, also, she doesn\u2019t have time to have the North warm up to her. Sansa was better off playing nice, regardless of if she actually liked Dany or not, and scheming in the background for what comes after the battle. Being openly antagonistic to an ally as a major threat looms only causes division and doesn\u2019t nothing to help the effort.</p><p>She was better off asking that food question in private because what does she gain from asking it in front of the lords? Minus making herself look better to them.</p><p>Sans is all tell and no show in the series.</p><p>I think we\u2019re also forgetting that, regardless of how Sansa feels, Dany is queen now. People have been killed over less and, as poor as it may seen, Dany is trying to work with her. All she is asking to be respected, not that Sansa likes her. That would make the transition of power\u00a0\u201ceasier.\u201d</p><p>Also, regardless of if the North is independent or not, the North has mostly always operated independent of the crown because royals rarely come up there.
