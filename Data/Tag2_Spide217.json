The air was wrapping all\naround her, making the jacket she had on totally useless. Shivers ran through\nher body and she could feel how her cheeks and nose had gotten red. Autumn was\nher favorite season of all, and (Y/N) could\u2019ve appreciated it at least a little\nbit more, if it wasn\u2019t for the fight that was happening right in front of her. It\nwas a battle between Peter and Harry. \nSpider-Man against Green Goblin. </p><p>They were\nin the top of an abandoned building just outside the city, the perfect place so\nshe couldn\u2019t get help. (Y/N) blamed herself because if it wasn\u2019t for her\nstupidity, she wouldn\u2019t have gotten herself kidnapped, and there would be no\nfight right now. But of course, she ran straight to the trap Harry planted for\nher.</p><p>Peter\nlooked exhausted, (Y/N) could tell, by the way he slowed down a bit. He punched\nHarry in the face and he, quick on his feet, returned the punch, making Peter\nfall back a little. (Y/N) recognized Harry\u2019s strength equals Peter\u2019s, making a\ntie between them, but the way Peter looked and moved; one could easily tell he\nwas getting tired.</p><p>Peter made\na false move and Harry got him under his grip, strangling him. He looked\nterrifying, with crazy eyes and a horrid grin across Harry\u2019s face that showed\nhow much he was enjoying \u00a0 having his\nneck in between his hands while constricting it. (Y/N) was terrified by the\nsight and saw that Peter wasn\u2019t going to get out of it soon enough, she grown\nanxious and she instantly knew she had to do something as quick as possible.\nHer nerves got worse when she saw Peter started to black out.</p><p>She grabbed\nthe first thing she saw on the ground that was heavy enough and, with all her\nstrength, threw it at Harry, successfully hitting him in the head and letting\ngo of Peter, who fell to the ground unconscious.</p><p>\u201cLeave him\nalone!\u201d her voice was crisp.</p><p>Harry,\nfilled with even more anger, wiped out the blood that dripped down to his\nforehead, and chuckled. With his glider, he rapidly flew to where (Y/N) was\nand, before she had a chance to run away, he grabbed her by the neck and lifted\nher up. Meanwhile, Peter slowly started to regain consciousness.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve\nalways been a pain in the ass, you knew that?\u201d (Y/N) looked at him, twitching\nin his hands, trying oh-so desperately to catch some air. Harry smiled at the spectacle.\n\u201cEven in high school, trying so hard to be head of the class.\u201d he scoffed\ncynically.</p><p>(Y/N), in\ndesperation, reaches out to one of the pumpkin grenades from Harry\u2019s belt and turned\none on. She took in a sharp breath. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve always been a fucking idiot.\u201d she\ngrowled.</p><p>Harry\nfinally unconstrained her, dropping her at the very edge of the tall building,\nwhere she stayed still, trying to catch her breath, and holding her bruised neck.\nHarry managed to take the grenade off his suit and throw it away from him, but\nit still blew up very close, knocking him out of the glider, where he hit his\nhead and lost awareness. </p><p>Unfortunately,\nthe grenade was also close to (Y/N) and the magnitude of the explosion pushed\nher away and, consequently, fell off the building. At the exact moment, Peter\nregained conscious and, as he saw how she propelled off the building, got up in\nan instant, threw himself off of the roof, and fired his web shooter at her, in\nhopes of catching her.</p><p>Everything\nwent in slow motion.</p><p>(Y/N)\nglared at Peter, still falling. She saw how the web kept coming at her, but it\nwasn\u2019t fast enough. She felt how the cold air, that she just noticed a few\nmoments ago, hit her body brutally as she descended.</p><p>Suddenly,\nthe face of her mom passed through her mind, at how she fought with her before\nshe left the house earlier that evening, and it was a stupid fight about\nsomething she can no longer remember. She regretted that. And so, the first tear\ncame out of her eyes.</p><p>Her sister,\nher tiny little sister, who she loved immensely. She remembered that one time\nwhere she got her for a present in her birthday a doll she just couldn\u2019t stop\ntalking about. She got so happy with the sight of her baby sister playing and\nhumming with that doll every day. The giggles made everyday a happy day. More\ntears came along.</p><p>And Peter.</p><p>The person\nshe loved the most.</p><p>The person\nshe would do anything for.</p><p>She\nremembered the first time she met him. They were still at high school and one\nday, she was on her way to return some books, when all of the sudden, she\nstumbled on Peter. They were both distracted, her still reading one of the\nbooks and him writing something on a notebook, which he revealed later on in\ntheir relationship was a new web formula.</p><p>The first\ntime they kissed was one of her favorite days of her life. Peter was really\nnervous and couldn\u2019t stop blushing, but (Y/N) was calm, wanting it to happen,\nbecause she was already falling for him. When they finally did it, it was the\nmost amazing kiss of all, she never felt something like that in her life and\nshe loved it. After that, Peter stopped being nervous around her, and even\nthough she liked that about him, she accepted with open arms that he finally\ngot to be comfortable around her.</p><p>She really\nloved him.</p><p>She loved\nthe way his curly hair felt so soft in between her fingers, she loved the color\nof his eyes and how much they would shine whenever the sunlight hit them,\ncreating the most amazing golden eyes. She loved his smile and the way he would\nonly smile at her, and only her. She loved his jaw, his ears, and his nose.\nEverything about him she loved. Everything.</p><p>She still\ngazed at Peter and the web, which still was making its way at her.</p><p>But she\nknew, <i>she just knew</i>, it wasn\u2019t going to catch her on time. Peter wasn\u2019t going\nto catch her.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t\ngoing to make it.</p><p>So, she\ngave up and closed her eyes, warm tears still coming out of them. She wasn\u2019t\nsure, but she might have heard Peter screaming at her. All she could really\nhear was her heart pounding hard in her chest and the rush of the air in her\nears.</p><p>She opened\nher eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nsorry.\u201d she whispers.</p><p>And\nfinally, everything went dark.</p><p>Peter\nstopped immediately at a window sill after hearing the horrendous thud. His\nbreath caught in his lungs, while paralyzed, seeing (Y/N)\u2019s motionless body on\nthe ground.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\nno\u2026\u201d he kept repeating himself, barely as a whisper.</p><p>He jumped\nand landed softly next to (Y/N), picking her up in his arms instantly as gentle\nas possible. Everything was silent, except for the sound of Peter\u2019s sob and his\nintake of sharp breaths. His eyes were red and burning, tears overflowing them,\nalmost making it impossible for him to see.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N),\nhoney\u2026\u201d he trembled, while he tried to swallow the big rock that was stuck in his\nthroat, \u201cC\u2019mon baby, wake up.\u201d he commanded, taking harsh breaths.</p><p>Blood\ndripped from her head and came out of her nose and mouth. Peter, with all his\nstrength being pulled out of him, sat down, her still in his arms. He stroked\nher hair, letting the blood soak his hands. It was still warm and that hurt him\neven more.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he\nbawled, tears running wild across his cheeks. \u201c(Y/N), come back, please!\u201d he\npleaded.</p><p>He hugged\nher as tight as he could, putting his head in her chest, trying to hear a\nsingle heart beat, but only silence met him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d\nhe wept, crushed. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p>",

The air was wrapping all\naround her, making the jacket she had on totally useless. Shivers ran through\nher body and she could feel how her cheeks and nose had gotten red. Autumn was\nher favorite season of all, and (Y/N) could\u2019ve appreciated it at least a little\nbit more, if it wasn\u2019t for the fight that was happening right in front of her. It\nwas a battle between Peter and Harry. \nSpider-Man against Green Goblin. </p><p>They were\nin the top of an abandoned building just outside the city, the perfect place so\nshe couldn\u2019t get help. (Y/N) blamed herself because if it wasn\u2019t for her\nstupidity, she wouldn\u2019t have gotten herself kidnapped, and there would be no\nfight right now. But of course, she ran straight to the trap Harry planted for\nher.</p><p>Peter\nlooked exhausted, (Y/N) could tell, by the way he slowed down a bit. He punched\nHarry in the face and he, quick on his feet, returned the punch, making Peter\nfall back a little. (Y/N) recognized Harry\u2019s strength equals Peter\u2019s, making a\ntie between them, but the way Peter looked and moved; one could easily tell he\nwas getting tired.</p><p>Peter made\na false move and Harry got him under his grip, strangling him. He looked\nterrifying, with crazy eyes and a horrid grin across Harry\u2019s face that showed\nhow much he was enjoying \u00a0 having his\nneck in between his hands while constricting it. (Y/N) was terrified by the\nsight and saw that Peter wasn\u2019t going to get out of it soon enough, she grown\nanxious and she instantly knew she had to do something as quick as possible.\nHer nerves got worse when she saw Peter started to black out.</p><p>She grabbed\nthe first thing she saw on the ground that was heavy enough and, with all her\nstrength, threw it at Harry, successfully hitting him in the head and letting\ngo of Peter, who fell to the ground unconscious.</p><p>\u201cLeave him\nalone!\u201d her voice was crisp.</p><p>Harry,\nfilled with even more anger, wiped out the blood that dripped down to his\nforehead, and chuckled. With his glider, he rapidly flew to where (Y/N) was\nand, before she had a chance to run away, he grabbed her by the neck and lifted\nher up. Meanwhile, Peter slowly started to regain consciousness.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve\nalways been a pain in the ass, you knew that?\u201d (Y/N) looked at him, twitching\nin his hands, trying oh-so desperately to catch some air. Harry smiled at the spectacle.\n\u201cEven in high school, trying so hard to be head of the class.\u201d he scoffed\ncynically.</p><p>(Y/N), in\ndesperation, reaches out to one of the pumpkin grenades from Harry\u2019s belt and turned\none on. She took in a sharp breath. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve always been a fucking idiot.\u201d she\ngrowled.</p><p>Harry\nfinally unconstrained her, dropping her at the very edge of the tall building,\nwhere she stayed still, trying to catch her breath, and holding her bruised neck.\nHarry managed to take the grenade off his suit and throw it away from him, but\nit still blew up very close, knocking him out of the glider, where he hit his\nhead and lost awareness. </p><p>Unfortunately,\nthe grenade was also close to (Y/N) and the magnitude of the explosion pushed\nher away and, consequently, fell off the building. At the exact moment, Peter\nregained conscious and, as he saw how she propelled off the building, got up in\nan instant, threw himself off of the roof, and fired his web shooter at her, in\nhopes of catching her.</p><p>Everything\nwent in slow motion.</p><p>(Y/N)\nglared at Peter, still falling. She saw how the web kept coming at her, but it\nwasn\u2019t fast enough. She felt how the cold air, that she just noticed a few\nmoments ago, hit her body brutally as she descended.</p><p>Suddenly,\nthe face of her mom passed through her mind, at how she fought with her before\nshe left the house earlier that evening, and it was a stupid fight about\nsomething she can no longer remember. She regretted that. And so, the first tear\ncame out of her eyes.</p><p>Her sister,\nher tiny little sister, who she loved immensely. She remembered that one time\nwhere she got her for a present in her birthday a doll she just couldn\u2019t stop\ntalking about. She got so happy with the sight of her baby sister playing and\nhumming with that doll every day. The giggles made everyday a happy day. More\ntears came along.</p><p>And Peter.</p><p>The person\nshe loved the most.</p><p>The person\nshe would do anything for.</p><p>She\nremembered the first time she met him. They were still at high school and one\nday, she was on her way to return some books, when all of the sudden, she\nstumbled on Peter. They were both distracted, her still reading one of the\nbooks and him writing something on a notebook, which he revealed later on in\ntheir relationship was a new web formula.</p><p>The first\ntime they kissed was one of her favorite days of her life. Peter was really\nnervous and couldn\u2019t stop blushing, but (Y/N) was calm, wanting it to happen,\nbecause she was already falling for him. When they finally did it, it was the\nmost amazing kiss of all, she never felt something like that in her life and\nshe loved it. After that, Peter stopped being nervous around her, and even\nthough she liked that about him, she accepted with open arms that he finally\ngot to be comfortable around her.</p><p>She really\nloved him.</p><p>She loved\nthe way his curly hair felt so soft in between her fingers, she loved the color\nof his eyes and how much they would shine whenever the sunlight hit them,\ncreating the most amazing golden eyes. She loved his smile and the way he would\nonly smile at her, and only her. She loved his jaw, his ears, and his nose.\nEverything about him she loved. Everything.</p><p>She still\ngazed at Peter and the web, which still was making its way at her.</p><p>But she\nknew, <i>she just knew</i>, it wasn\u2019t going to catch her on time. Peter wasn\u2019t going\nto catch her.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t\ngoing to make it.</p><p>So, she\ngave up and closed her eyes, warm tears still coming out of them. She wasn\u2019t\nsure, but she might have heard Peter screaming at her. All she could really\nhear was her heart pounding hard in her chest and the rush of the air in her\nears.</p><p>She opened\nher eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nsorry.\u201d she whispers.</p><p>And\nfinally, everything went dark.</p><p>Peter\nstopped immediately at a window sill after hearing the horrendous thud. His\nbreath caught in his lungs, while paralyzed, seeing (Y/N)\u2019s motionless body on\nthe ground.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\nno\u2026\u201d he kept repeating himself, barely as a whisper.</p><p>He jumped\nand landed softly next to (Y/N), picking her up in his arms instantly as gentle\nas possible. Everything was silent, except for the sound of Peter\u2019s sob and his\nintake of sharp breaths. His eyes were red and burning, tears overflowing them,\nalmost making it impossible for him to see.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N),\nhoney\u2026\u201d he trembled, while he tried to swallow the big rock that was stuck in his\nthroat, \u201cC\u2019mon baby, wake up.\u201d he commanded, taking harsh breaths.</p><p>Blood\ndripped from her head and came out of her nose and mouth. Peter, with all his\nstrength being pulled out of him, sat down, her still in his arms. He stroked\nher hair, letting the blood soak his hands. It was still warm and that hurt him\neven more.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he\nbawled, tears running wild across his cheeks. \u201c(Y/N), come back, please!\u201d he\npleaded.</p><p>He hugged\nher as tight as he could, putting his head in her chest, trying to hear a\nsingle heart beat, but only silence met him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d\nhe wept, crushed. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p></p>",

She saw how the web kept coming at her, but it\nwasn\u2019t fast enough. She felt how the cold air, that she just noticed a few\nmoments ago, hit her body brutally as she descended.</p><p>Suddenly,\nthe face of her mom passed through her mind, at how she fought with her before\nshe left the house earlier that evening, and it was a stupid fight about\nsomething she can no longer remember. She regretted that. And so, the first tear\ncame out of her eyes.</p><p>Her sister,\nher tiny little sister, who she loved immensely. She remembered that one time\nwhere she got her for a present in her birthday a doll she just couldn\u2019t stop\ntalking about. She got so happy with the sight of her baby sister playing and\nhumming with that doll every day. The giggles made everyday a happy day. More\ntears came along.</p><p>And Peter.</p><p>The person\nshe loved the most.</p><p>The person\nshe would do anything for.</p><p>She\nremembered the first time she met him. They were still at high school and one\nday, she was on her way to return some books, when all of the sudden, she\nstumbled on Peter. They were both distracted, her still reading one of the\nbooks and him writing something on a notebook, which he revealed later on in\ntheir relationship was a new web formula.</p><p>The first\ntime they kissed was one of her favorite days of her life. Peter was really\nnervous and couldn\u2019t stop blushing, but (Y/N) was calm, wanting it to happen,\nbecause she was already falling for him. When they finally did it, it was the\nmost amazing kiss of all, she never felt something like that in her life and\nshe loved it. After that, Peter stopped being nervous around her, and even\nthough she liked that about him, she accepted with open arms that he finally\ngot to be comfortable around her.</p><p>She really\nloved him.</p><p>She loved\nthe way his curly hair felt so soft in between her fingers, she loved the color\nof his eyes and how much they would shine whenever the sunlight hit them,\ncreating the most amazing golden eyes. She loved his smile and the way he would\nonly smile at her, and only her. She loved his jaw, his ears, and his nose.\nEverything about him she loved. Everything.</p><p>She still\ngazed at Peter and the web, which still was making its way at her.</p><p>But she\nknew, <i>she just knew</i>, it wasn\u2019t going to catch her on time. Peter wasn\u2019t going\nto catch her.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t\ngoing to make it.</p><p>So, she\ngave up and closed her eyes, warm tears still coming out of them. She wasn\u2019t\nsure, but she might have heard Peter screaming at her. All she could really\nhear was her heart pounding hard in her chest and the rush of the air in her\nears.</p><p>She opened\nher eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nsorry.\u201d she whispers.</p><p>And\nfinally, everything went dark.</p><p>Peter\nstopped immediately at a window sill after hearing the horrendous thud. His\nbreath caught in his lungs, while paralyzed, seeing (Y/N)\u2019s motionless body on\nthe ground.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\nno\u2026\u201d he kept repeating himself, barely as a whisper.</p><p>He jumped\nand landed softly next to (Y/N), picking her up in his arms instantly as gentle\nas possible. Everything was silent, except for the sound of Peter\u2019s sob and his\nintake of sharp breaths. His eyes were red and burning, tears overflowing them,\nalmost making it impossible for him to see.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N),\nhoney\u2026\u201d he trembled, while he tried to swallow the big rock that was stuck in his\nthroat, \u201cC\u2019mon baby, wake up.\u201d he commanded, taking harsh breaths.</p><p>Blood\ndripped from her head and came out of her nose and mouth. Peter, with all his\nstrength being pulled out of him, sat down, her still in his arms. He stroked\nher hair, letting the blood soak his hands. It was still warm and that hurt him\neven more.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he\nbawled, tears running wild across his cheeks. \u201c(Y/N), come back, please!\u201d he\npleaded.</p><p>He hugged\nher as tight as he could, putting his head in her chest, trying to hear a\nsingle heart beat, but only silence met him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d\nhe wept, crushed. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p></p>",

The air was wrapping all\naround her, making the jacket she had on totally useless. Shivers ran through\nher body and she could feel how her cheeks and nose had gotten red. Autumn was\nher favorite season of all, and (Y/N) could&rsquo;ve appreciated it at least a little\nbit more, if it wasn&rsquo;t for the fight that was happening right in front of her. It\nwas a battle between Peter and Harry. \nSpider-Man against Green Goblin. </p><p>They were\nin the top of an abandoned building just outside the city, the perfect place so\nshe couldn&rsquo;t get help. (Y/N) blamed herself because if it wasn&rsquo;t for her\nstupidity, she wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten herself kidnapped, and there would be no\nfight right now. But of course, she ran straight to the trap Harry planted for\nher.</p><p>Peter\nlooked exhausted, (Y/N) could tell, by the way he slowed down a bit. He punched\nHarry in the face and he, quick on his feet, returned the punch, making Peter\nfall back a little. (Y/N) recognized Harry&rsquo;s strength equals Peter&rsquo;s, making a\ntie between them, but the way Peter looked and moved; one could easily tell he\nwas getting tired.</p><p>Peter made\na false move and Harry got him under his grip, strangling him. He looked\nterrifying, with crazy eyes and a horrid grin across Harry&rsquo;s face that showed\nhow much he was enjoying &nbsp; having his\nneck in between his hands while constricting it. (Y/N) was terrified by the\nsight and saw that Peter wasn&rsquo;t going to get out of it soon enough, she grown\nanxious and she instantly knew she had to do something as quick as possible.\nHer nerves got worse when she saw Peter started to black out.</p><p>She grabbed\nthe first thing she saw on the ground that was heavy enough and, with all her\nstrength, threw it at Harry, successfully hitting him in the head and letting\ngo of Peter, who fell to the ground unconscious.</p><p>&ldquo;Leave him\nalone!&rdquo; her voice was crisp.</p><p>Harry,\nfilled with even more anger, wiped out the blood that dripped down to his\nforehead, and chuckled. With his glider, he rapidly flew to where (Y/N) was\nand, before she had a chance to run away, he grabbed her by the neck and lifted\nher up. Meanwhile, Peter slowly started to regain consciousness.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve\nalways been a pain in the ass, you knew that?&rdquo; (Y/N) looked at him, twitching\nin his hands, trying oh-so desperately to catch some air. Harry smiled at the spectacle.\n&ldquo;Even in high school, trying so hard to be head of the class.&rdquo; he scoffed\ncynically.</p><p>(Y/N), in\ndesperation, reaches out to one of the pumpkin grenades from Harry&rsquo;s belt and turned\none on. She took in a sharp breath. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve always been a fucking idiot.&rdquo; she\ngrowled.</p><p>Harry\nfinally unconstrained her, dropping her at the very edge of the tall building,\nwhere she stayed still, trying to catch her breath, and holding her bruised neck.\nHarry managed to take the grenade off his suit and throw it away from him, but\nit still blew up very close, knocking him out of the glider, where he hit his\nhead and lost awareness. </p><p>Unfortunately,\nthe grenade was also close to (Y/N) and the magnitude of the explosion pushed\nher away and, consequently, fell off the building.
