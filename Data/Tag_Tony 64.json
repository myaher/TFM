NO! He is fat because The Russos! wanted him to be funny! That was the only purpose for Chubby Thor! </p><p>Even in that video i could hear the audience laughing!!!! The little kids found it hilarious and i was sitting here at home and crying!!!! </p><p>You could see Thor&rsquo;s pain and anger when Banner said Thanos name but&hellip;</p><p>The Camera focused on his belly so much like &ldquo;LOOK AT IT ITS FUNNY!!&rdquo;</p><p>and I&rsquo;m in floods of tears going &ldquo;\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d NO it&rsquo;s not!!! Leave me alone please! \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d&rdquo; It was painful!!! How could that they do this to him! </p><p>And he gives a little speech that he&rsquo;s fine and that he has no wish to be involved in helping the Avengers and he tells Rocket and Prof. Hulk to leave&hellip;but then Rocket says &ldquo;there&rsquo;s beer on the ship&rdquo; and Thor ups and goes with them????? Huuuuuuhhhhh!??????</p><p>And then for most of the movie the focus is on his beer belly and making him sound like an idiot!!! </p><p>Should Thor be depressed? of course!!! After everything he&rsquo;s gone through of course!! Should he gain weight being depressed? Yes! I GAIN WEIGHT WHEN I&rsquo;M DEPRESSED!!! Being depressed and using junk food, alcohol, playing games all day will have this effect on you. But is him gaining weight!!! Something to laugh at??? NO!!!! </p><p>And Valkyrie???? In Ragnarok she went through the same situation Thor is in now. She was depressed and drowned her sadness in Alcohol. And then Thor came along and gave her her purpose back. Made her realise she can do so much more than wasting away on the Trash Planet. </p><p>And now Thor is in the same situation as her and&hellip;what? Valkyrie has been helping the Asgardians settle in Tonnsberg while Thor was drinking and eating junk food and worried about cable!! </p><p>But you know what Thor was never a dumbass!!! After what happened in the first Thor movie he was everything a good king would be. The reason he didn&rsquo;t want the Throne of Asgard on TDW was because he felt he could protect the nine realms better when he&rsquo;s not sitting on the Throne of Asgard. But when peace reigns he will gladly take care of his people.</p><p><b>What was all that character development in Thor 2011 and Thor: The Dark World and even in shitty Ragnarok all about?!!!! Actually i blame partly Ragnarok for Thor ending up.like this. Ragnarok was what started Thor as a comical character. The Russo just went &ldquo;Its free real estate&rdquo; and renovated on it and gave us Chubby Thor who couldn&rsquo;t even speak a complete sentence properly.</b></p><p>And that&rsquo;s not even it, what bothers me is that in the 5 years no one was helping Thor get better. Korg and Meik were pretty much enablers. <b>Looking at things Valkyrie most probably tried to talk to him but he didn&rsquo;t bother to listen.</b> And after a while she let him be hoping he comes out of his grief on his own. But, You know what pre Ragnarok Thor would listen to her. Pre Ragnarok Thor would not hide away and pretend nothing happened! Pre Ragnarok Thor would be grateful that he has people who care about him. He would do his best for the Asgardians he has with him now. Valkyrie and Korg and Miek are his closest people and he has their shoulder to cry on!! Especially Val. She does understand! and the entire time he was shutting himself away from the world, she helps the Asgardians get used to this new place. She also has hopes Thor will heal in time. She hasn&rsquo;t given up hope. I mean when all the Avengers were giving Thor looks of &ldquo;oh, that is sad&rdquo;, she in the end has confidence in him. The movie never showed her thinking Thor is lesser of a man and king than he was before. She actually hopes for him to finally do right by his people.</p><p>What pisses me off is that Thor just goes off onto another adventure leaving Valkyrie with more responsibility than she already has (<i>considering that now the whole human population is back and recovering from the IW events you can guarantee a whole host of problems are going to arise for the Asgardians. Considering how humans are you can bet on that.</i>) The only way I can forgive Thor is if they give us a Thor 4 where he comes back to Earth with the remaining Asgardians (Hulk does say &ldquo;we can bring them back&rdquo;) and finally decides to do some good for his people. Helps them have a better life, navigating human culture, learning new skills.</p><p>The Russos make Thor&rsquo;s grieve look like a joke! LIKE THOR DOESN&rsquo;T EVEN CARE!!! RESPONSIBILITY??? NOPE THOR DOESN&rsquo;T KNOW ANY OF THAT!  you don&rsquo;t even feel sorry anymore or sympathise with Thor. You just feel ANGRY!! At the Russos and at Thor himself!!</p><p><b>Other things that hurt me&hellip;</b></p><p>Tony&rsquo;s death. It hurts just thinking about it! I feel it was unnecessary. There&rsquo;s no need for him to die. The Russos with all their imagination should have given him a happy ending! Natasha&rsquo;s death broke me first! Yeah you&rsquo;re gonna be a weeping mess after this. Steve was&hellip;*sigh*!!! It was sad and bittersweet. Did i like that ending for him? Not really \ud83d\ude22</p><p>Wanda doesn&rsquo;t get back Vision. Recently Elizabeth Olsen gave hints that the WandaVision series will be set in 1950s. I don&rsquo;t even know how that works out \ud83d\ude10</p><p>And Loki!!! You know how we thought he was ooc in Ragnarok? Nah! The Loki we see in Endgames New York 2012 is competing side by side with Ragnarok Loki on who is more ooc . I mean! He actually shape-shifted into Steve to mock him. He waved bye bye at the Hulk!! What??!! And then he just disappears and you&rsquo;re sitting there like &ldquo;what the hell happen???&rdquo;</p><p><b>What was good about Endgame?&hellip;.</b></p><ol><li>The rest of the movie was good. The humour was great when it didn&rsquo;t involve Thor. I&rsquo;ll never get over Scott in ant size sticking his ass out and saying &ldquo;Flick me&rdquo; at Tony\ud83d\ude02 There were a lot of ass jokes. But it was find. <b>Rocket and Prof. Hulk are my faves.</b></li><li>Thor meeting his mother was very emotional. Since she&rsquo;s a witch she immediately knew he was from the future. She doesn&rsquo;t judge him at all. She&rsquo;s just happy to see him.Their reunion was very sweet. A lot of tears and hugs. \ud83d\ude22In the end Frigga gives him a hug just before he leaves tells him in her sweet motherly voice &ldquo;<i>eat a salad&rdquo; </i>\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 The only thing that was irritating here is Thor calling her &ldquo;mom&rdquo; \ud83d\ude15</li><li>For those who have been asking, there&rsquo;s a reason Thor had to sneak pass Loki &lsquo;cause of the time travel thing he can&rsquo;t allow himself to be seen by anyone. And Loki would definitely know this is Thor from the future. That would mess things up a lot.</li><li>Thor looked sort of better at the end when he was fighting Thanos. It would seem him summoning his armour, Mjolnier and the lighting also took care of his beard and hair. It&rsquo;s still long but braided \ud83d\ude15 He fought good. He was cool at the end.</li><li>Gamora is alive (<i>Gamora from the past entered the 2018 timeline because of Thanos</i>) !! \ud83d\ude04 And Quill is looking for her (<i>He gotta make her fall in love with him all over)</i></li><li>And of course the fighting was epic as is expected. Cap wielding Mjolnier! When everybody showed up through Strange&rsquo;s portal!, Steve&rsquo;s &ldquo;Avengers Assemble&rdquo;, Tony and Pepper fighting together!!! Wanda!! The Ladies of Marvel!! Captain Marvel!! <b>10/10</b>(<i>Tbh, Carol does look a little impatient the few times she was in the movie. Like she needed to be somewhere. I guess she has priorities. Other planets to protect. The moment she was sure Earth was safe she was gone.</i>)</li></ol><p><b>Not gonna lie, Endgame is epic and it is brilliant and amazing even with its flaws.</b></p><p>What&rsquo;s interesting is according to the Ancient One, <b>if you move the stones from their proper place in the timeline it would result in a parallel reality being created.</b> And of all the stone only the Space Stone has been moved from its place..by Loki. So that could mean a new alternate  reality/universe has been created. And you know what&hellip;..That is actually scary. I wonder if the present universe Thor even knows that this other reality even exists where Loki is most probably alive. But even if he knows he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do anything anyway.</p><p><b>Watching the movie, and seeing everybody fight together side by side, makes me miss Loki.</b> It&rsquo;s like that scene where he takes the Space Stone and vanished sealed his fate somewhat. He&rsquo;s no longer connected to the timeline or universe we know. A new story exists for him. He&rsquo;s completely separated. And He&rsquo;s different now. He&rsquo;s probably still somewhat a villain with no redemption. He was never meant to fight side by side with the Avengers in this universe at least. Who knows how he turns out in the other universe. As matter of fact i wonder how everyone in the other universe turns out. </p><p>Looking at things i feel if Loki had been alive after IW, he will never be able to just settle down on Earth. And now Thor is the same too. They will probably just up and leave and travel. 'Cause for Loki especially, he&rsquo;s never going to be able to adjust with humans. The restrictions on him would be huge. I see him as the type who would leave through a hidden portal to other worlds.</p><p>I do feel like everybody&rsquo;s story hasn&rsquo;t really ended. Especially for Thor. He calls himself and Quills team as &ldquo;Asgardians of The Galaxy&rdquo; and if I&rsquo;m not wrong there&rsquo;s a comic book of that name. Aside from that he, Quill and the team need to find Gamora and other Asgardians and return to Earth. And there better be a movie for that.</p><p>*Insert The Avengers theme song by Alan Silvestri*</p>",

NO! He is fat because The Russos! wanted him to be funny! That was the only purpose for Chubby Thor! </p><p>Even in that video i could hear the audience laughing!!!! The little kids found it hilarious and i was sitting here at home and crying!!!! </p><p>You could see Thor\u2019s pain and anger when Banner said Thanos name but\u2026</p><p>The Camera focused on his belly so much like \u201cLOOK AT IT ITS FUNNY!!\u201d</p><p>and I\u2019m in floods of tears going \u201c\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d NO it\u2019s not!!! Leave me alone please! \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\u201d It was painful!!! How could that they do this to him! </p><p>And he gives a little speech that he\u2019s fine and that he has no wish to be involved in helping the Avengers and he tells Rocket and Prof. Hulk to leave\u2026but then Rocket says \u201cthere\u2019s beer on the ship\u201d and Thor ups and goes with them????? Huuuuuuhhhhh!??????</p><p>And then for most of the movie the focus is on his beer belly and making him sound like an idiot!!! </p><p>Should Thor be depressed? of course!!! After everything he\u2019s gone through of course!! Should he gain weight being depressed? Yes! I GAIN WEIGHT WHEN I\u2019M DEPRESSED!!! Being depressed and using junk food, alcohol, playing games all day will have this effect on you. But is him gaining weight!!! Something to laugh at??? NO!!!! </p><p>And Valkyrie???? In Ragnarok she went through the same situation Thor is in now. She was depressed and drowned her sadness in Alcohol. And then Thor came along and gave her her purpose back. Made her realise she can do so much more than wasting away on the Trash Planet. </p><p>And now Thor is in the same situation as her and\u2026what? Valkyrie has been helping the Asgardians settle in Tonnsberg while Thor was drinking and eating junk food and worried about cable!! </p><p>But you know what Thor was never a dumbass!!! After what happened in the first Thor movie he was everything a good king would be. The reason he didn\u2019t want the Throne of Asgard on TDW was because he felt he could protect the nine realms better when he\u2019s not sitting on the Throne of Asgard. But when peace reigns he will gladly take care of his people.</p><p><b>What was all that character development in Thor 2011 and Thor: The Dark World and even in shitty Ragnarok all about?!!!! Actually i blame partly Ragnarok for Thor ending up.like this. Ragnarok was what started Thor as a comical character. The Russo just went \u201cIts free real estate\u201d and renovated on it and gave us Chubby Thor who couldn\u2019t even speak a complete sentence properly.</b></p><p>And that\u2019s not even it, what bothers me is that in the 5 years no one was helping Thor get better. Korg and Meik were pretty much enablers. <b>Looking at things Valkyrie most probably tried to talk to him but he didn\u2019t bother to listen.</b> And after a while she let him be hoping he comes out of his grief on his own. But, You know what pre Ragnarok Thor would listen to her. Pre Ragnarok Thor would not hide away and pretend nothing happened! Pre Ragnarok Thor would be grateful that he has people who care about him. He would do his best for the Asgardians he has with him now. Valkyrie and Korg and Miek are his closest people and he has their shoulder to cry on!! Especially Val. She does understand! and the entire time he was shutting himself away from the world, she helps the Asgardians get used to this new place. She also has hopes Thor will heal in time. She hasn\u2019t given up hope. I mean when all the Avengers were giving Thor looks of \u201coh, that is sad\u201d, she in the end has confidence in him. The movie never showed her thinking Thor is lesser of a man and king than he was before. She actually hopes for him to finally do right by his people.</p><p>What pisses me off is that Thor just goes off onto another adventure leaving Valkyrie with more responsibility than she already has (<i>considering that now the whole human population is back and recovering from the IW events you can guarantee a whole host of problems are going to arise for the Asgardians. Considering how humans are you can bet on that.</i>) The only way I can forgive Thor is if they give us a Thor 4 where he comes back to Earth with the remaining Asgardians (Hulk does say \u201cwe can bring them back\u201d) and finally decides to do some good for his people. Helps them have a better life, navigating human culture, learning new skills.</p><p>The Russos make Thor\u2019s grieve look like a joke! LIKE THOR DOESN\u2019T EVEN CARE!!! RESPONSIBILITY??? NOPE THOR DOESN\u2019T KNOW ANY OF THAT!  you don\u2019t even feel sorry anymore or sympathise with Thor. You just feel ANGRY!! At the Russos and at Thor himself!!</p><p><b>Other things that hurt me\u2026</b></p><p>Tony\u2019s death. It hurts just thinking about it! I feel it was unnecessary. There\u2019s no need for him to die. The Russos with all their imagination should have given him a happy ending! Natasha\u2019s death broke me first! Yeah you\u2019re gonna be a weeping mess after this. Steve was\u2026*sigh*!!! It was sad and bittersweet. Did i like that ending for him? Not really \ud83d\ude22</p><p>Wanda doesn\u2019t get back Vision. Recently Elizabeth Olsen gave hints that the WandaVision series will be set in 1950s. I don\u2019t even know how that works out \ud83d\ude10</p><p>And Loki!!! You know how we thought he was ooc in Ragnarok? Nah! The Loki we see in Endgames New York 2012 is competing side by side with Ragnarok Loki on who is more ooc . I mean! He actually shape-shifted into Steve to mock him. He waved bye bye at the Hulk!! What??!! And then he just disappears and you\u2019re sitting there like \u201cwhat the hell happen???\u201d</p><p><b>What was good about Endgame?\u2026.</b></p><ol><li>The rest of the movie was good. The humour was great when it didn\u2019t involve Thor. I\u2019ll never get over Scott in ant size sticking his ass out and saying \u201cFlick me\u201d at Tony\ud83d\ude02 There were a lot of ass jokes. But it was find. <b>Rocket and Prof. Hulk are my faves.</b></li><li>Thor meeting his mother was very emotional. Since she\u2019s a witch she immediately knew he was from the future. She doesn\u2019t judge him at all. She\u2019s just happy to see him.Their reunion was very sweet. A lot of tears and hugs. \ud83d\ude22In the end Frigga gives him a hug just before he leaves tells him in her sweet motherly voice \u201c<i>eat a salad\u201d </i>\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 The only thing that was irritating here is Thor calling her \u201cmom\u201d \ud83d\ude15</li><li>For those who have been asking, there\u2019s a reason Thor had to sneak pass Loki \u2018cause of the time travel thing he can\u2019t allow himself to be seen by anyone. And Loki would definitely know this is Thor from the future. That would mess things up a lot.</li><li>Thor looked sort of better at the end when he was fighting Thanos. It would seem him summoning his armour, Mjolnier and the lighting also took care of his beard and hair. It\u2019s still long but braided \ud83d\ude15 He fought good. He was cool at the end.</li><li>Gamora is alive (<i>Gamora from the past entered the 2018 timeline because of Thanos</i>) !! \ud83d\ude04 And Quill is looking for her (<i>He gotta make her fall in love with him all over)</i></li><li>And of course the fighting was epic as is expected. Cap wielding Mjolnier! When everybody showed up through Strange\u2019s portal!, Steve\u2019s \u201cAvengers Assemble\u201d, Tony and Pepper fighting together!!! Wanda!! The Ladies of Marvel!! Captain Marvel!! <b>10/10</b>(<i>Tbh, Carol does look a little impatient the few times she was in the movie. Like she needed to be somewhere. I guess she has priorities. Other planets to protect. The moment she was sure Earth was safe she was gone.</i>)</li></ol><p><b>Not gonna lie, Endgame is epic and it is brilliant and amazing even with its flaws.</b></p><p>What\u2019s interesting is according to the Ancient One, <b>if you move the stones from their proper place in the timeline it would result in a parallel reality being created.</b> And of all the stone only the Space Stone has been moved from its place..by Loki. So that could mean a new alternate  reality/universe has been created. And you know what\u2026..That is actually scary. I wonder if the present universe Thor even knows that this other reality even exists where Loki is most probably alive. But even if he knows he wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything anyway.</p><p><b>Watching the movie, and seeing everybody fight together side by side, makes me miss Loki.</b> It\u2019s like that scene where he takes the Space Stone and vanished sealed his fate somewhat. He\u2019s no longer connected to the timeline or universe we know. A new story exists for him. He\u2019s completely separated. And He\u2019s different now. He\u2019s probably still somewhat a villain with no redemption. He was never meant to fight side by side with the Avengers in this universe at least. Who knows how he turns out in the other universe. As matter of fact i wonder how everyone in the other universe turns out. </p><p>Looking at things i feel if Loki had been alive after IW, he will never be able to just settle down on Earth. And now Thor is the same too. They will probably just up and leave and travel. 'Cause for Loki especially, he\u2019s never going to be able to adjust with humans. The restrictions on him would be huge. I see him as the type who would leave through a hidden portal to other worlds.</p><p>I do feel like everybody\u2019s story hasn\u2019t really ended. Especially for Thor. He calls himself and Quills team as \u201cAsgardians of The Galaxy\u201d and if I\u2019m not wrong there\u2019s a comic book of that name. Aside from that he, Quill and the team need to find Gamora and other Asgardians and return to Earth. And there better be a movie for that.</p><p>*Insert The Avengers theme song by Alan Silvestri*</p></p>",

Makeshift, because someone had scribbled \u20180.9%\u2019 with a Sharpie or space Sharpie or whatever aliens used instead of Sharpies on the bag.

Instead, he just croaked.</p>\n\n<p>This roused his attendant, who had been dozing on a stool with her head lolling against the doorframe and her knees pulled two inches from his nose. This was a really, really small space.</p>\n\n<p>His eyes drifted down towards the doorstopper in her arms.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d he rasped.</p>\n\n<p>Nebula slammed the three-ring binder shut and, quite deliberately, dropped it on his leg.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOw,\u201d he said sulkily. He squinted at the backdrop. Less than a metre of space separated his bed from the threshold. Nebula occupied one end of this gap. What looked like a pile of cannibalized monitors were stacked haphazardly at the other end, towards his feet.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat, no\u2026tech support?\u201d he said weakly.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTech support was unconscious.\u201d Nebula bent down and picked something off the floor. He heard the sound of Velcro ripping as Nebula straightened up and loomed over him. \u201cTake off your shirt.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cRoll up my sleeve,\u201d he said, eyeing the blood pressure cuff without moving.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI want to examine that\u2026thing.\u201d She gestured vaguely at the nanite patch.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t move,\u201d Tony said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI can <em>give</em> you a reason not to move,\u201d Nebula said darkly. \u201cI\u2019ve been in your position before. You can move.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tony compromised with the scary blue lady. He moved.</p>\n\n<p>He let Nebula help him strip off his jacket and shirt, which hurt like the devil, then lay back down on the bed and watched her apprehensively. This was, after all, a stranger. That they shared an enemy in Thanos did not necessarily make them friends.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re medically trained?\u201d he asked, watching her strap the cuff to his arm and slip a stethoscope under its lip.</p>\n\n<p>Her lips thinned. \u201cNo.\u201d She began inflating the cuff.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSo you have <em>no</em> training?\u201d Tony\u2019s eyes darted towards the unknown fluid in a Ziploc bag slowly dripping into his veins. \u201cWhat did you MacGyver that <em>with</em>?\u201d he asked, voice rising with a strangled hitch.</p>\n\n<p>He had subconsciously risen to a half-sitting position, with his weight propped on his elbows.

Be still.\u201d She released the air and started over.</p>\n\n<p>When she was done, Nebula said nothing to him. Her face was impassive. Inexplicably, Tony felt reasonable assuming this meant good news. He watched her unstrap the cuff and roll it neatly around the sphygmomanometer and stethoscope, then dipped out of sight. When she crawled back out from beneath the bed, she was holding\u2026a box of syringes and a cooler.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Tony asked.

He was to consume only what she provided; and what she provided, he was to consume \u2013 no more, no less. If he felt sharp pain, he was to tell her immediately. If he felt radiating pain, she didn\u2019t want to hear about it. If he felt disorientation, shortness of breath, chills, or a fever, he was to tell her immediately. If he had to urinate \u2013</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u2013 he was to tell her immediately, and record the volume each time. She handed him a 500 mL glass beaker and a pencil, which Tony mutely accepted. She administered a round of medications without telling him the name of a single one. He felt like a pincushion.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYour bedside manner sucks.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>She pulled a handwritten regimen out of her breast pocket, handed it to Tony, and made him swear on Terra\u2019s continued existence \u2013</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s called Earth, sweetheart.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u2013 That he would never, ever call her that again, or she would break his jaw. Furthermore, he would swear to adhere to this regimen even if she was made unavailable by the thankless task of keeping his worthless hide alive, which necessitated that she occasionally leave him to his own devices; which, in turn, was to say nothing and do nothing unless otherwise instructed.</p>\n\n<p>She dropped to her knees so that her nose was level with his throbbing abdomen, and stuck a needle into that, too. Then she instructed him to pick up where he left off.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLeft off what?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAbout the nanites, idiot.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI thought I was supposed to \u2018say nothing\u2019 and \u2018do nothing\u2019.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Nebula decided then and there it would be prudent to take a second sample for blood analysis.

Makeshift, because someone had scribbled \u20180.9%\u2019 with a Sharpie or space Sharpie or whatever aliens used instead of Sharpies on the bag.

Instead, he just croaked.</p>\n\n<p>This roused his attendant, who had been dozing on a stool with her head lolling against the doorframe and her knees pulled two inches from his nose. This was a really, really small space.</p>\n\n<p>His eyes drifted down towards the doorstopper in her arms.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d he rasped.</p>\n\n<p>Nebula slammed the three-ring binder shut and, quite deliberately, dropped it on his leg.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOw,\u201d he said sulkily. He squinted at the backdrop. Less than a metre of space separated his bed from the threshold. Nebula occupied one end of this gap. What looked like a pile of cannibalized monitors were stacked haphazardly at the other end, towards his feet.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat, no\u2026tech support?\u201d he said weakly.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTech support was unconscious.\u201d Nebula bent down and picked something off the floor. He heard the sound of Velcro ripping as Nebula straightened up and loomed over him. \u201cTake off your shirt.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cRoll up my sleeve,\u201d he said, eyeing the blood pressure cuff without moving.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI want to examine that\u2026thing.\u201d She gestured vaguely at the nanite patch.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t move,\u201d Tony said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI can <em>give</em> you a reason not to move,\u201d Nebula said darkly. \u201cI\u2019ve been in your position before. You can move.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tony compromised with the scary blue lady. He moved.</p>\n\n<p>He let Nebula help him strip off his jacket and shirt, which hurt like the devil, then lay back down on the bed and watched her apprehensively. This was, after all, a stranger. That they shared an enemy in Thanos did not necessarily make them friends.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re medically trained?\u201d he asked, watching her strap the cuff to his arm and slip a stethoscope under its lip.</p>\n\n<p>Her lips thinned. \u201cNo.\u201d She began inflating the cuff.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSo you have <em>no</em> training?\u201d Tony\u2019s eyes darted towards the unknown fluid in a Ziploc bag slowly dripping into his veins. \u201cWhat did you MacGyver that <em>with</em>?\u201d he asked, voice rising with a strangled hitch.</p>\n\n<p>He had subconsciously risen to a half-sitting position, with his weight propped on his elbows.

Be still.\u201d She released the air and started over.</p>\n\n<p>When she was done, Nebula said nothing to him. Her face was impassive. Inexplicably, Tony felt reasonable assuming this meant good news. He watched her unstrap the cuff and roll it neatly around the sphygmomanometer and stethoscope, then dipped out of sight. When she crawled back out from beneath the bed, she was holding\u2026a box of syringes and a cooler.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Tony asked.

He was to consume only what she provided; and what she provided, he was to consume \u2013 no more, no less. If he felt sharp pain, he was to tell her immediately. If he felt radiating pain, she didn\u2019t want to hear about it. If he felt disorientation, shortness of breath, chills, or a fever, he was to tell her immediately. If he had to urinate \u2013</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u2013 he was to tell her immediately, and record the volume each time.

He felt like a pincushion.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYour bedside manner sucks.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>She pulled a handwritten regimen out of her breast pocket, handed it to Tony, and made him swear on Terra\u2019s continued existence \u2013</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s called Earth, sweetheart.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u2013 That he would never, ever call her that again, or she would break his jaw. Furthermore, he would swear to adhere to this regimen even if she was made unavailable by the thankless task of keeping his worthless hide alive, which necessitated that she occasionally leave him to his own devices; which, in turn, was to say nothing and do nothing unless otherwise instructed.</p>\n\n<p>She dropped to her knees so that her nose was level with his throbbing abdomen, and stuck a needle into that, too.
