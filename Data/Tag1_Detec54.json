Also, since this villain is bringing people in, they don\u2019t need to dedicate a separate movie to each character before hand, we the audience will understand \u201coh, all these things are from different places and have different powers, they don\u2019t know each other and are being forced to fight\u201d if the movie wants to focus on the select backstory of 1 or 2 characters, cool - but since Smash Bros has so many characters, the fun will be getting to at least see some of them fight - like if there\u2019s a big final fight scene at the end. </p><p>It would make since to give a separate movie to the franchises that would either have a lot of characters here, or who\u2019s lead would be a major focus. Like from the Pok\u00e9mon movie alone we\u2019d have at least 3 Pok\u00e9mon playing (possibly a joke of the villain saying they picked Jigglypuff b/c it\u2019s just so gosh darn cute). </p><p>Also, this Smash Tournament they would be forced to fight in could be from any of the games past. If certain characters where not there, it could be because they were added in a later version. </p><p>** there are so many potential story routes this could take. Heroes and villains from their series being forced to team up. - friends being forced to fight each other b/c there can only be 1 winner. - will someone make a sacrific and jump off the platform so a loved one can win and not have to finish them off themself? </p><p>\u2014 I see such a good story for Luigi that could go 1 of 2 ways. Either A) he has to rise up to \u2018player 1\u2019 and be the hero of the day when they need him the most instead of relying on his brother (a more loving story about believing in yourself and the bond between brothers with no hate between him and Mario).  Or  B) he is manipulated by the bad guys like Wario, Dr. Robotnik, etc, to betray Mario and fight him full strength in a battle instead of using teamwork, b/c he\u2019s tired of always being \u2018player 2\u2019 (a redemption story about his jealousy blinding his decision and how he helps his brother in the end) </p><p>- also some great potential scenes, like maybe Wario is pitted against a bunch of female characters (who granted most Nintendo female characters don\u2019t look threatening), where he mocks them, the guy is a villain so makes since for him to be this way, he laughs while all the guys who know these ladies duck down&hellip;.and they unleash devastation. I mean, Zelda &amp; Peach may be princesses, but they will destroy you without wrinkling their dress &amp; before their next court meeting lol. </p><p>- just a thought but I think this has some real potential. There really hasn\u2019t been a crossover between games aside from Smash, except for the Olympic Games &hellip;.. I could just see something cute at the end like with the credits that the Mario guys meet the Sonic gang, it looks like a big show down, then the credits are just them failing at various sports with like Pikachu there (somehow) ref-ing and commentating. Funny scene = any race against sonic. Figure skating with Bowser being surprisingly graceful and Pikachu quietly doing the play by play \u201cand here he is getting ready for a triple flip, so graceful. I\u2019m gonna be honest people I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s a dinosaur, a turtle or some firebreathing nightmare I\u2019ve had since I was 4, but right now he is the picture of perfection\u201d. - someone like Wario &amp; Waluigi are the pool and won\u2019t get out \u201cOk guys, you get out of there right now, or so help me I will drag you out myself. (They laugh). Okay, here I come. Just lil old me. Small bundle of yellow fuzz&hellip;comeplely charged with electricity&hellip;coming directly to you in the pool filled with water&hellip;\u201d</p>",

Also, since this villain is bringing people in, they don\u2019t need to dedicate a separate movie to each character before hand, we the audience will understand \u201coh, all these things are from different places and have different powers, they don\u2019t know each other and are being forced to fight\u201d if the movie wants to focus on the select backstory of 1 or 2 characters, cool - but since Smash Bros has so many characters, the fun will be getting to at least see some of them fight - like if there\u2019s a big final fight scene at the end. </p><p>It would make since to give a separate movie to the franchises that would either have a lot of characters here, or who\u2019s lead would be a major focus. Like from the Pok\u00e9mon movie alone we\u2019d have at least 3 Pok\u00e9mon playing (possibly a joke of the villain saying they picked Jigglypuff b/c it\u2019s just so gosh darn cute). </p><p>Also, this Smash Tournament they would be forced to fight in could be from any of the games past. If certain characters where not there, it could be because they were added in a later version. </p><p>** there are so many potential story routes this could take. Heroes and villains from their series being forced to team up. - friends being forced to fight each other b/c there can only be 1 winner. - will someone make a sacrific and jump off the platform so a loved one can win and not have to finish them off themself? </p><p>\u2014 I see such a good story for Luigi that could go 1 of 2 ways. Either A) he has to rise up to \u2018player 1\u2019 and be the hero of the day when they need him the most instead of relying on his brother (a more loving story about believing in yourself and the bond between brothers with no hate between him and Mario).  Or  B) he is manipulated by the bad guys like Wario, Dr. Robotnik, etc, to betray Mario and fight him full strength in a battle instead of using teamwork, b/c he\u2019s tired of always being \u2018player 2\u2019 (a redemption story about his jealousy blinding his decision and how he helps his brother in the end) </p><p>- also some great potential scenes, like maybe Wario is pitted against a bunch of female characters (who granted most Nintendo female characters don\u2019t look threatening), where he mocks them, the guy is a villain so makes since for him to be this way, he laughs while all the guys who know these ladies duck down\u2026.and they unleash devastation. I mean, Zelda &amp; Peach may be princesses, but they will destroy you without wrinkling their dress &amp; before their next court meeting lol. </p><p>- just a thought but I think this has some real potential. There really hasn\u2019t been a crossover between games aside from Smash, except for the Olympic Games \u2026.. I could just see something cute at the end like with the credits that the Mario guys meet the Sonic gang, it looks like a big show down, then the credits are just them failing at various sports with like Pikachu there (somehow) ref-ing and commentating.
