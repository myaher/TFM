After lubing up the strap on, you enter him slowly, feeling a slight resistance. He whimpers, fists balling into the sheets, not used to something so large up his ass. </p><p>It isn&rsquo;t long before you are able to move in and out of him though, and his crying out for you in no time. He&rsquo;s so hot underneath you, writhing and moaning, looking back at you from time to time. It makes you bite your lip, and while you aren&rsquo;t physically receiving any stimulation from this, you are beyond turned on and horny from this. </p><p>&ldquo;How do you feel?&rdquo; You ask him through slow thrusts. </p><p>&ldquo;Amazing,&rdquo; he whispers. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t stop.&rdquo; So you don&rsquo;t, and you plunge into him again and again, nails digging into his hips, breath heavy as you work your body in all new ways. </p>",
