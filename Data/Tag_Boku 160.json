Mirio knows you never mean to sound rude, he knows that you are a sweet and lovable person! Mirio knows how to handle anxiety, being a hero you have to learn how to help others remain calm. He has a handful of techniques to help anxiety and he is always there to listen if you need him too. Though Mirio tends to be more of an energetic person, he can totally get behind just sleeping next to each other after a long day! He can also enjoy occasional competitive video game session! He also adores your cats and is practically always covered in cat hair now. Though you may have a hard time showing affection, it\u2019s fine! Mirio easily understands how much you care about him and you\u2019ll be able to understand how much you matter to him!</p><p><br/></p><p>I hope you enjoyed and have a great day! </p><p>Ophelia</p>",

        "question": "Heey is it okay if you match me up with someone? Im black haired ( shoulder length) and I'm pretty round too. Im an introvert but I'll always encourage a conversation with anyone that tries to talk to me, I love books and would love to be a writer someday. I'd rather listen to people's complaints than share my own insecirities. Yes I suck at opening up. The people around me think that I'm this carefree jokester but I'm just really, really lonely.",
        "answer": "<p>I would match you up with Midoriya! He a soft and gentle personality, one that is easy to talk to and he would most certainly love entertaining a conversation with you! Midoriya is a huge bookworm so you have to let him read your writings one day, and he\u2019ll most certainly encourage you to become a writer. He\u2019ll be your personal cheerleader the whole way! Midoriya can definitely appreciate that you can be the type of person that lets him have a shoulder to cry on, though one day he would like to do the same for you! Midoriya knows the feeling of being alone, he will offer you as much love, affection and friendship you need. He\u2019ll always be reassuring you, that he cares a whole ton about you as well!<b><br/></b></p><p><br/></p><p>I hope you enjoyed and have a great day!

Congrats for being my 100th post as well!</p><p><br/></p><p>Mirio:</p><p>-Mirio isn\u2019t the type of person who teases their lover for their height but, he most definitely secretly loves being much taller than his S/O.<br/></p><p>- He likes watching their cute expression when the stand on their tiptoes to kiss him. </p><p>-Mirio is the type of boyfriend that lets your sit on his shoulders so you can see up higher. Makes concerts or public events much easier since you two can now see with much ease. You most certainly kiss him when you sit upon his shoulders!</p><p>-When you two end up walking for a long time, Mirio will eventually end up giving you a piggyback ride. Doesn\u2019t matter where you two are, you are getting an impromptu piggyback ride.</p><p>-One time you two played hide and seek. Yeah Mirio still never knows where you went to hide that eventful day! You\u2019re also the pro at hide and seek since you can easily spot and tall people (aka Mirio) attempting to hide!</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>All Might:</p><p>-All Might always found it slightly funny to compare him and his lover\u2019s heights. He\u2019s always found their short stature to be cute (yes, he found it so cute he has coughed out blood a few times.)</p><p>-All Might most certainly loves to pick them up bridal style and pepper their face in kisses. </p><p>-Whenever his S/O wears one of his shirts, he has to be rushed to Recovery Girl because they look so cute since his shirt is practically a dress on them.</p><p>-S/O permanently has to carry around a mini first aid kit with them, since poor Toshinori ends up bonking his head on so many door frames. Though luckily a few kisses can help ease Toshinori\u2019s pain.</p><p>-If it\u2019s ever sunny, just hide behind your tall boyfriend and perfect shade! Toshinori does find that action quite adorable, especially if you end up hugging him from behind as well as avoiding the sunlight.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Aizawa:</p><p>-Aizawa most certainly teases his S/O for their height. He snickers when they can\u2019t reach the food in a cabinet or that one time they weren\u2019t allowed on a ride. Though he most certainly chuckles when they can\u2019t reach his lips to kiss him. </p><p>-Probably has asked \u2018how the weather is down there\u2019 at least once before their S/O groaned and Aizawa then proceeded to kiss them on top of their head.</p><p>-On the plus side, you two can share a sleeping bag, which makes for perfect cuddles!</p><p>-If it\u2019s raining, Aizawa is the one holding the umbrella and probably discreetly wraps his arm around your shoulder.</p><p>-Even though you may be short, you are most certainly the big spoon. Aizawa hates to admit it but, he enjoys being surrounded by your affection and love!</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>I hope you enjoyed and have a great day!</p><p>Ophelia</p>",

The feeling of being watched was putting a serious strain on your nerves; you weren\u2019t sure how much more of their attention you could take.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBaby, don\u2019t be like that!\u201d He laughed, knocking on your front door.</p>\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<p>The other hunters had all but abandoned you when it became clear you were essentially a homing beacon to the pair. It was a sore subject, but there was nothing that could be done. You weren\u2019t willing to hunt them down \u2014 Jirou more than anyone understood that \u2014 and so you had resigned yourself to being an evening shut-in. As long as you were in your own home, they couldn\u2019t get to you at night; during the day, you just had to be sure to be armed and stay close to your dwindling group of friends.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cY/N,\u201d Shinsou called, and you could practically feel his smirk when your heart stuttered uncomfortably. If it was just Kaminari, you wouldn\u2019t have been nearly as nervous. He was a young vampire, more interested in teasing you than feeding off you \u2014 at least, you <em>hoped</em> so, since he apparently had very violent feeding habits \u2014 but Shinsou? Shinsou would love nothing more than to feed from you, and you couldn\u2019t risk being compelled.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou could at least come to the door and talk to us.\u201d You scoffed, making yourself more comfortable on the couch. There was no earthly way you would be able to look at them and hold a conversation. Even thinking about Kaminaris fate made you nauseous, but your strange attraction to Shinsou? Not something you ever wanted to deal with. It had been wrong when you&rsquo;d been with Kaminari, and it was <em>just </em>as wrong now that you weren&rsquo;t. The flirting never seemed to bother your boyfriend, but the guilt always ate at you later. It was always harmless, because you would <em>never </em>have hooked up with him or anything, but it was haunting you even a month later.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to either of you.\u201d It was stupid to even humor the conversation. All it did was make you ache for a simpler time, before all the bloodshed and drama. When it was just you and Kaminari and your weird friendliness with Shinsou wasn\u2019t anything more than a bit of an adrenaline rush.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLiar.\u201d Kaminari purred, and you almost choked, feeling blood rush to your face. It wasn\u2019t often that he called you out like that; the embarrassment at having been caught in your silent pining sent a shiver down your spine.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou guys need to leave me alone.\u201d You whispered, knowing they could still hear you even through the wall.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou could always make us.\u201d Shinsou offered, mockingly. \u201cThat\u2019s what you do, right? Or are you still too scared to face us?\u201d Anger ignited in you at that, and before you\u2019d thought your plan all the way through you\u2019d stormed to your door and nearly ripped it off its hinges in your hurry to open it. You regretted that decision instantly when two matching, predatory grins were suddenly directed at you. Just as quickly as your anger had ignited, it was gone, and you were standing awkwardly on the safe side of the threshold feeling your heartbeat hammering away at your rib cage. Blood rushed to your face, embarrassment and shame prickling against your skin as you attempted to come up with something threatening to say.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLeave.\u201d You hated that it came out a somewhat choked warble, even as you moved to slam the door in their smug faces.</p>\n\n<p>Ever the smart one, Shinsou blocked it from closing with his coat; Kaminari caught on quickly enough to go fetch a stick from nearby and replace the offending garment with it. Even though they couldn\u2019t cross the threshold, apparently they were smart enough to keep the door open. You attempted several more times \u2014 only to be stopped by a fucking <em>stick</em> \u2014 to slam it before surrendering and stumbling back. The door creaked open slowly and you made sure to glare at the men on the other side.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d A ringing in your ears suddenly chilled you to your core, and your previous irritation gave way to legitimate fear as Shinsou leaned forward, leveling his face with yours.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to invite us in?\u201d Panic settled over you.<em> Panic. Scream. Run.</em> Your body didn\u2019t move. Compulsion was a tricky thing, though; Shinsou didn\u2019t really even need to use it, considering his own special ability. You stayed silent, staring at him with a scowl despite the low thrum in your mind. They couldn\u2019t make you invite them in. You didn\u2019t have even the <em>slightest</em> inclination to let them into your safe space. Nobody even had a key to your little house, thanks to your paranoia.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Y/N, don\u2019t be like that!\u201d Kaminari whined, still grinning over Shinsous shoulder and you grit your teeth. Shinsou stared into your eyes thoughtfully, obviously weighing his options.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you missed us?\u201d A pang in your chest. You<em> had</em> missed Kaminari. Even Shinsou, in a weird sort of way. You\u2019d come into the fold after Shinsou had been turned \u2014 essentially his replacement \u2014 but you and Kaminari had hit it off and despite everything, their lingering friendship had remained and ruined everything for you. Jirou had told you, offhandedly, about how close they were; you could see now it had been a warning.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThen come here.\u201d Their grins grew when you inched over the threshold at the soft command, only amplified by the teasing beckoning motion Kaminari used. Before your sudden change in situation even full processed, you were sandwiched between the vampires; caged between them by two sets of arms coiled around you. You could feel your heart in your throat, beating wildly as you trashed and squirmed about, letting out a soft curse for having been so stupid.</p>\n\n<p>And then Kaminari was <em>kissing</em> you.</p>\n\n<p>It was hard and fast and needy, and you could taste the <em>want</em> on his tongue. You hadn&rsquo;t even noticed you\u2019d went limp in Shinsous grip until he chuckled and nuzzled at your neck. Your fingers dug into the front of Kaminari\u2019s shirt, torn between pulling him closer and pushing him away. Luckily, the blond made the decision for you and pulled back, licking his lips and pressing his forehead to yours. He didn\u2019t even spare a glance at Shinsou, who\u2019d taken to peppering feather light kisses at your pulse; you were admittedly dazed but <em>thoroughly</em> enjoying the sensation.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSee? Not that bad, is it?\u201d Kaminari purred. Shinsou scoffed out a laugh against your skin and you flinched when something sharp \u2014 presumably his fangs \u2014 dragged along your neck.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cY/N?!\u201d Jirous voice garnered your attention, and everybody seemed to freeze at the interruption. How the pair of <em>vampires</em> had missed the arrival of your hunter friends was beyond you, but after Shinsou released you with a sigh and stepped off the porch, Kaminari pressed another kiss to your cheek before following. You were a flustered, blushing mess on your front porch as they shouldered by the hunters and headed on their merry way.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cUh\u2014\u201d You couldn\u2019t look at any of your friends as they hurried to fuss over you, looking for any signs of being bitten.</p>\n\n<p>It took several seconds of their pestering before you worked up the nerve to tell them that they hadn\u2019t bitten you, much less tried anything else even remotely sinister. They&rsquo;d just been toying with you, like you and Kaminari had toyed with Shinsou. Jirou had looked at you with something akin to understanding; you realized that the two of you had a very heavy cross to bare. You knew your affection for your vampiric lovers would bring nothing but trouble, and wondered what exactly it would mean for you in the future.</p>",

It wasn\u2019t often that he called you out like that; the embarrassment at having been caught in your silent pining sent a shiver down your spine.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou guys need to leave me alone.\u201d You whispered, knowing they could still hear you even through the wall.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou could always make us.\u201d Shinsou offered, mockingly. \u201cThat\u2019s what you do, right? Or are you still too scared to face us?\u201d Anger ignited in you at that, and before you\u2019d thought your plan all the way through you\u2019d stormed to your door and nearly ripped it off its hinges in your hurry to open it. You regretted that decision instantly when two matching, predatory grins were suddenly directed at you. Just as quickly as your anger had ignited, it was gone, and you were standing awkwardly on the safe side of the threshold feeling your heartbeat hammering away at your rib cage. Blood rushed to your face, embarrassment and shame prickling against your skin as you attempted to come up with something threatening to say.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLeave.\u201d You hated that it came out a somewhat choked warble, even as you moved to slam the door in their smug faces.</p>\n\n<p>Ever the smart one, Shinsou blocked it from closing with his coat; Kaminari caught on quickly enough to go fetch a stick from nearby and replace the offending garment with it. Even though they couldn\u2019t cross the threshold, apparently they were smart enough to keep the door open. You attempted several more times \u2014 only to be stopped by a fucking <em>stick</em> \u2014 to slam it before surrendering and stumbling back. The door creaked open slowly and you made sure to glare at the men on the other side.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d A ringing in your ears suddenly chilled you to your core, and your previous irritation gave way to legitimate fear as Shinsou leaned forward, leveling his face with yours.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to invite us in?\u201d Panic settled over you.<em> Panic. Scream. Run.</em> Your body didn\u2019t move. Compulsion was a tricky thing, though; Shinsou didn\u2019t really even need to use it, considering his own special ability. You stayed silent, staring at him with a scowl despite the low thrum in your mind. They couldn\u2019t make you invite them in. You didn\u2019t have even the <em>slightest</em> inclination to let them into your safe space. Nobody even had a key to your little house, thanks to your paranoia.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Y/N, don\u2019t be like that!\u201d Kaminari whined, still grinning over Shinsous shoulder and you grit your teeth. Shinsou stared into your eyes thoughtfully, obviously weighing his options.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you missed us?\u201d A pang in your chest. You<em> had</em> missed Kaminari. Even Shinsou, in a weird sort of way. You\u2019d come into the fold after Shinsou had been turned \u2014 essentially his replacement \u2014 but you and Kaminari had hit it off and despite everything, their lingering friendship had remained and ruined everything for you. Jirou had told you, offhandedly, about how close they were; you could see now it had been a warning.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThen come here.\u201d Their grins grew when you inched over the threshold at the soft command, only amplified by the teasing beckoning motion Kaminari used. Before your sudden change in situation even full processed, you were sandwiched between the vampires; caged between them by two sets of arms coiled around you. You could feel your heart in your throat, beating wildly as you trashed and squirmed about, letting out a soft curse for having been so stupid.</p>\n\n<p>And then Kaminari was <em>kissing</em> you.</p>\n\n<p>It was hard and fast and needy, and you could taste the <em>want</em> on his tongue. You hadn\u2019t even noticed you\u2019d went limp in Shinsous grip until he chuckled and nuzzled at your neck. Your fingers dug into the front of Kaminari\u2019s shirt, torn between pulling him closer and pushing him away. Luckily, the blond made the decision for you and pulled back, licking his lips and pressing his forehead to yours. He didn\u2019t even spare a glance at Shinsou, who\u2019d taken to peppering feather light kisses at your pulse; you were admittedly dazed but <em>thoroughly</em> enjoying the sensation.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSee? Not that bad, is it?\u201d Kaminari purred. Shinsou scoffed out a laugh against your skin and you flinched when something sharp \u2014 presumably his fangs \u2014 dragged along your neck.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cY/N?!\u201d Jirous voice garnered your attention, and everybody seemed to freeze at the interruption. How the pair of <em>vampires</em> had missed the arrival of your hunter friends was beyond you, but after Shinsou released you with a sigh and stepped off the porch, Kaminari pressed another kiss to your cheek before following. You were a flustered, blushing mess on your front porch as they shouldered by the hunters and headed on their merry way.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cUh\u2014\u201d You couldn\u2019t look at any of your friends as they hurried to fuss over you, looking for any signs of being bitten.</p>\n\n<p>It took several seconds of their pestering before you worked up the nerve to tell them that they hadn\u2019t bitten you, much less tried anything else even remotely sinister. They\u2019d just been toying with you, like you and Kaminari had toyed with Shinsou. Jirou had looked at you with something akin to understanding; you realized that the two of you had a very heavy cross to bare. You knew your affection for your vampiric lovers would bring nothing but trouble, and wondered what exactly it would mean for you in the future.</p>",

Too nervous and <em>weak</em> to look at either man, especially now that Kaminari had been turned. The pair of you had probably been tempting fate with your playful, borderline friendly banter with the violet-eyed vampire, but you&rsquo;d never imagined you&rsquo;d actually be in a position where your boyfriend had been turned and you were left the minority of the weird relationship.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Y/N!&rdquo; His cheerful call made you flinch from your position on the couch. He couldn&rsquo;t get in &mdash; neither of them could &mdash; but that didn&rsquo;t mean they weren&rsquo;t relentless with their tormenting.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Fuck off, Denki!&rdquo; You shouted, returning to your phone game with a heavy heart. Anything to make the hairs on the back of your neck lie down. The feeling of being watched was putting a serious strain on your nerves; you weren&rsquo;t sure how much more of their attention you could take.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Baby, don&rsquo;t be like that!&rdquo; He laughed, knocking on your front door.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other hunters had all but abandoned you when it became clear you were essentially a homing beacon to the pair. It was a sore subject, but there was nothing that could be done. You weren&rsquo;t willing to hunt them down &mdash; Jirou more than anyone understood that &mdash; and so you had resigned yourself to being an evening shut-in. As long as you were in your own home, they couldn&rsquo;t get to you at night; during the day, you just had to be sure to be armed and stay close to your dwindling group of friends.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Y/N,&rdquo; Shinsou called, and you could practically feel his smirk when your heart stuttered uncomfortably. If it was just Kaminari, you wouldn&rsquo;t have been nearly as nervous. He was a young vampire, more interested in teasing you than feeding off you &mdash; at least, you <em>hoped</em> so, since he apparently had very violent feeding habits &mdash; but Shinsou? Shinsou would love nothing more than to feed from you, and you couldn&rsquo;t risk being compelled.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You could at least come to the door and talk to us.&rdquo; You scoffed, making yourself more comfortable on the couch. There was no earthly way you would be able to look at them and hold a conversation. Even thinking about Kaminaris fate made you nauseous, but your strange attraction to Shinsou? Not something you ever wanted to deal with. It had been wrong when you&rsquo;d been with Kaminari, and it was <em>just </em>as wrong now that you weren&rsquo;t. The flirting never seemed to bother your boyfriend, but the guilt always ate at you later. It was always harmless, because you would <em>never </em>have hooked up with him or anything, but it was haunting you even a month later.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to talk to either of you.&rdquo; It was stupid to even humor the conversation. All it did was make you ache for a simpler time, before all the bloodshed and drama. When it was just you and Kaminari and your weird friendliness with Shinsou wasn&rsquo;t anything more than a bit of an adrenaline rush.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Liar.&rdquo; Kaminari purred, and you almost choked, feeling blood rush to your face.

Not even bothering to assess the damage, you forced yourself up to a standing position with a wince, turning to glare at him with what you were sure was a mangled face.</p>\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<p><span class=\"npf_color_niles\">\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to be so rou\u2014\u201d</span> His scent washed over you like a calming wave and your knees wobbled; the whiny reprimand you were about to release forgotten instantaneously. His nostrils flared, obviously having caught your scent too, and you could honestly say you\u2019d never wanted to flee a situation more. <em>He</em> was your alpha? A goody-goody hero? Life sure was funny sometimes.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"npf_color_niles\">\u201cOh Hell no.\u201d</span> You sputtered; watching the heros gaze sharpen as you hurriedly backed away ignited something in you. A deep, primal sensation that you hated and loved all at once. He reached you in a few large steps, grasping your chin with his ungloved hand and you wanted to melt. Your body was practically vibrating with excitement that you had <em>finally</em> found your partner \u2014 your other half; your <em>perfect match</em>. It all seemed so cliche and your rational mind hated it.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"npf_color_rachel\">\u201cYou would deny me?\u201d</span> The question was said gruffly, the underlying scent of <em>alpha</em> hitting you full force. His distress at the idea hurt you; the omega in you wanted to soothe him and assure him that <em>you would never</em> but it was a lie. That\u2019s exactly what you were doing. Denying your alpha. Denying your bond. Running from your mate.</p>\n\n<p>Rather than respond to his loaded question, you teleported to the rooftop and took off in a sprint, flashing between buildings with unnatural precision; silently cursing that you had such awful luck.</p>\n\n<h2>* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  </h2>\n\n<p><span class=\"npf_color_rachel\">\u201cYou never answered me, omega!\u201d</span> The next time you\u2019re unfortunate to have a run in with the windy hero, the two of you recognize each other immediately. His voice was too loud, booming down on you and everyone else not unlike a loud speaker. You glared up at him before turning and taking off in a run, admittedly feeling <em>humiliated</em> that all eyes in the area had zeroed in on you. <em>Omega</em>. It was a curse. Being seen as a dainty little creature in need of saving, or worse, a toy for alpha gratification. The twisted system is what had set you on the path to villainy in the first place.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"npf_color_rachel\">\u201cYou can\u2019t outrun me!\u201d</span> He called down, keeping pace with you with little effort, thanks to the fact he could practically <em>fly</em>. You rolled your eyes, teleporting between buildings in the hopes of losing him, and being unfortunate enough not to.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"npf_color_niles\">\u201cBuzz off, hero!\u201d</span> You shouted back, finally, as you began to tire of trying to escape him. It was exhausting sprinting through town like some kind of mad woman.</p>\n\n<p>Inasa dropped down in front of you suddenly and you let out a curse as you toppled into his arms, moving too fast to stop yourself. You hated that when his arms wrapped around you it felt so safe, but more than that you hated the fact that you instinctively nuzzled your face into his chest, breathing him in. There was a rumble that sounded almost like a purr; when it evolved into laughter is when you angrily untangled yourself from his hold, glaring.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"npf_color_rachel\">\u201cYou\u2019re fiery,\u201d</span> His smile when he spoke was disarming. <span class=\"npf_color_rachel\">\u201cI like that!\u201d</span> If he hadn\u2019t said it quite so loud, it might have been endearing. But the fact he was practically shouting it out for the world to hear was mortifying; you could feel your face warming in embarrassment.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"npf_color_niles\">\u201cYou\u2019re too loud.\u201d</span> You grumbled back, and his boisterous laughter actually made you smile a bit before you teleported away this time. You outright laughed at his surprised shout.</p>\n\n<h2>* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  </h2>\n\n<p>When you see him in civilian wear for the first time, you actually laugh so hard you cry. Typically you would have shied away from the attention, snarling at anyone who so much as glanced at you, but the sheer <em>shock</em> of how ridiculous the <em>powerful</em> Gale Force looked had you howling. It was clear he had no sense of style; every glance back to make sure you were, in fact, seeing him and not some unfortunate look-alike just made you laugh harder. It only got worse when he spotted you and joyously joined your laughter, completely unaware that you were laughing <em>at him</em>.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"npf_color_rachel\">\u201cOmega!

The acknowledgment probably meant a lot to him, considering how deliberately distant you had chosen to be. When he nuzzled against your neck, you let out a huff of amusement. Scenting your partner was typically reserved for <em>later</em> in the relationship, but you figured you could let him get away with it, considering how many times he\u2019d let you off the hook when you most definitely should have been in handcuffs.</p>\n\n<p>You didn\u2019t even argue when he literally carried you out of the of the store, rambling in his booming voice about how the two of you would <em>definitely</em> need to discuss your line of work.</p>",
