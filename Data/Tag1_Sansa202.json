It got me thinking about another part about the recent script article in VF that bothered me. The treatment of the Stark sisters arc! It wasn\u2019t the part that annoyed me the most&hellip;but it did annoy me. AND I was frustrated by the arc at first. I\u2019ve started to come around to it despite the problems I think it still has.\u00a0<br/>I added this as a continuation of my thoughts on the article and scripts from yesterday. <a href=\"https://castaliareed.tumblr.com/post/180902446430/how-many-season-7-scripts-are-there-my-thoughts\">Here is part 1</a>.\u00a0</p><p><b>The tension</b></p><p>The sisters argue over the letter Sansa was forced to write while captive in King\u2019s Landing, whether or not she sufficiently supports Jon, that she likes nice things. Arya pretty much attacks her for everything.\u00a0</p><p><b>What the show got right:</b> Some tension between the sisters having to do with Jon. This was the same when they were kids. The first argument we ever see them have is about Jon! Arya coming home to find out that Sansa and Jon now have a trusting relationship and work together&hellip;well that was never going to sit well with her at first. They are probably going to have some tension over all kinds of things forever, always. They are too alike and too different&hellip;and they love each other.\u00a0<br/><b>What it got wrong:</b> They missed a chance to highlight Arya\u2019s jealousy over all this. And Sansa\u2019s inability to put her sister at ease. Because really that\u2019s what it is in this particular edition of the Stark girls argue. This doesn\u2019t make Arya bad. Honestly, it makes her human. She missed out on retaking Winterfell. That\u2019s gotta sting for her. Sansa\u2019s proud of the help she gave in the battle, of Jon\u2019s trust in her, it\u2019s what she wanted from him. It\u2019s hard for her to explain this to Arya in a way that her sister will believe that it\u2019s all genuine.\u00a0<br/></p><p><b>The threats</b><br/>We know Arya threatens Sansa with the Valyrian steel dagger.\u00a0</p><p><b>What the show got right:\u00a0</b>The physicality of Arya\u2019s reactions to Sansa. She has always been physical in showing her frustration towards her sister. Throwing snowballs, a blood orange&hellip;even the show had her throw food at Sansa in the first episode. So yea it\u2019s easy to see that Arya might still behave in a physical way with Sansa.\u00a0</p><p><b>What the show got wrong:</b> The hostility of these physical threats. Arya\u2019s throwing things at Sansa was more about her either trying to get Sansa to notice her or they were moments of frustration. An older but still young Arya would probably do the same thing. Her threat with the dagger seemed way to calculated. <br/>***<br/>Now about the script outtakes from the article.</p><p><b>Appeasing the Lords \u00a0</b></p><p>Arya overhears Sansa appeasing the Northern Lords when they want to crown her Queen over Jon. She reminds them they choice Jon and is generally decent during the exchange. Arya thinks this means Sansa wants Jon\u2019s crown especially if he doesn\u2019t return.\u00a0</p><p><b>What the show got right:</b> Sansa would totally appease the Lords and yea Arya would hate that. <br/><br/><b>What the show/scripts or article got wrong:</b> First off, Sansa is totally within her rights to appease the Northern Lords to keep them on side, to\u00a0keep them on the Stark side. Because you know what? Jon might not come back. Half her family never came back after going South. Look what happened to a young Bran when he was still at Winterfell after his family didn\u2019t come back. Later, she even says that she hasn\u2019t heard from Jon in weeks. When Arya accuses her of appeasing the Lords because Jon might not come back and she might need to rule well&hellip;There is nothing wrong with her for thinking that, for preparing for that. Because there is a decent chance that could happen. It doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s what she wants it to happen.</p><p>Another point the show or scripts or article didn\u2019t take the opporunity to make is that if Sansa hoped to get rid of Littlefinger, she need the Northern Lords more specifically the Vale Lords on her side. She had to know they would ride or die for her and not because Littlefinger was telling them to support House Stark. She knows the Vale has no particularly loyalty to Jon not like the North does. So, yea, communicating in some way that Sansa was aware she needed their support not to usurpy Jon but to get rid of LF&hellip;would have be the smart move.\u00a0 \u00a0<br/><b>The Game of Faces</b></p><p>A fan video theorizes that Arya is playing the Game of Faces with Sansa to test her.</p><p><b>What the show gets right: </b>If this was the case, this makes the Stark sister arc in season 7 a little bit better. The theory was compelling and Arya even says she is playing the game with Sansa.</p><p><b>What the show/scripts or article get wrong: </b>The article doesn\u2019t mention this at all. So, either the scripts don\u2019t go into detail about it beyond the dialogue Sansa and Arya have about the game. <br/></p><p><b>The realization</b><br/>Sansa realized Littlefinger was up to no good when he suggests Arya wants to be Lady of Winterfell.</p><p><b>What the show gets right:</b> Sansa would start to put all of Littlefinger\u2019s machinations together. He finally goes one or two steps too far and she eliminates the threat. Yea, I could see it all going that way.</p><p><b>What the show/scripts or article get wrong: </b>There is a cutscene somewhere of her going to Bran for help. Sansa would definitely have done this. She tells Jon in season 6 \u2018Only a fool would trust Littlefinger.\u2019 In the beginning of season 7, she is wary of him and pretty rude to him. Then she appears to start to listen to him more while still be a bit cold to him? This really doesn\u2019t make a ton of sense. Why would she stop taking her own advice? She\u2019s not an idiot. The source of Cersei\u2019s letter had to be Littlefinger. He was there when she was forced to write it. It\u2019s possible the longer Jon is gone the more vulnerable Sansa feels. Or the tension with Arya is making her forget her earlier caution. Or she could be keeping him close to try to figure things out. The scripts and/or article seem to suggest she was almost tricked by him&hellip;<br/><br/>And on screen it\u2019s still a bit confusing, it seemed like she decided to get rid of Littlefinger not just when he suggests Arya might want to be Lady of Winterfell but when he suggests Jon might want to marry Daenerys. Do the scripts mention Sansa\u2019s internal thoughts around this? Why not discuss both these things as the red flags that push Sansa to take out Littlefinger. And furthermore, it seems more probable that these were the things that push Sansa to act verse make her realize Littlefinger is trying to come between her family. She knew he couldn\u2019t be trusted from day 1. It was deciding when to act on that mistrust that Sansa had to determine. That she did it before Jon came back with a \u2018queen\u2019 with two dragons who is sure to cause her own amount of mistrust and drama, should show Sansa\u2019s prudence. It\u2019s more compelling to believe she was worried about the havoc Littlefinger might create in that situation. But again, the scripts, article, and Sansa\u2019s speech at his trial seem to suggest she was almost duped.</p><p><b>The make-up</b></p><p>They kill Littlefinger together and then makeup\u00a0with Sansa saying \u2018the pack survives\u2019. More like the pack kills&hellip;but I digress.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><b>What the show got right:</b> The sisters work it out. We get the sense that they are stronger for it. We\u2019re all here for Team Stark! Yay!</p><p><b>What the show/scripts or article got wrong: </b>The article makes no mention of the making it up part. That in this way the sisters learned how they can work together.\u00a0<br/></p><p>The article had its purpose. It was clearly part of the PR machine that was in effect. It dropped the same day as the new teaser. The writer may have their GoT biases but let\u2019s be real we all have our biases. You know which writers are going to take which angles if they are written about GoT before. It\u2019s possible they didn\u2019t choose which writer wrote the article&hellip;<br/><br/>I would say that the way the scripts or the article casts the Stark sisters arc leaves you wanting. The bright light here is that the sisters end up working together. And whether you like it or not, we are now clear on when Sansa figured out Littlefinger was trying to screw her family&hellip;again. This isn\u2019t exactly in line with what the show seemed to present.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0Again like the way the scripts present Jon Snow\u2019s internal thoughts, you are left wondering are they presenting this person as way out of character OR are they trolling us? Another option is that these are later scripts. Scripts that are telling parts of the story after the fact. Did they add bits and parts to make certain things that were unclear in the show clearer. It\u2019s possible. Anything is possible. It then becomes our choice, do we accept these intrepretations at face value&gt; Do we say&hellip;yup this is how the story goes? We might have too.\u00a0<br/>Season 8 might surprise or it might disappoint us. In the end we might have to live with our head canon versions. I for one much perferred it when I thought Sansa was on to Littlefinger\u2019s manipulations from the start and just had to find a moment in which to act.\u00a0</p>",

It\u2019s hard for her to explain this to Arya in a way that her sister will believe that it\u2019s all genuine.\u00a0<br></p><p><b>The threats</b><br>We know Arya threatens Sansa with the Valyrian steel dagger.\u00a0</p><p><b>What the show got right:\u00a0</b>The physicality of Arya\u2019s reactions to Sansa. She has always been physical in showing her frustration towards her sister. Throwing snowballs, a blood orange\u2026even the show had her throw food at Sansa in the first episode. So yea it\u2019s easy to see that Arya might still behave in a physical way with Sansa.\u00a0</p><p><b>What the show got wrong:</b> The hostility of these physical threats. Arya\u2019s throwing things at Sansa was more about her either trying to get Sansa to notice her or they were moments of frustration. An older but still young Arya would probably do the same thing. Her threat with the dagger seemed way to calculated. <br>***<br>Now about the script outtakes from the article.</p><p><b>Appeasing the Lords \u00a0</b></p><p>Arya overhears Sansa appeasing the Northern Lords when they want to crown her Queen over Jon. She reminds them they choice Jon and is generally decent during the exchange. Arya thinks this means Sansa wants Jon\u2019s crown especially if he doesn\u2019t return.\u00a0</p><p><b>What the show got right:</b> Sansa would totally appease the Lords and yea Arya would hate that. <br><br><b>What the show/scripts or article got wrong:</b> First off, Sansa is totally within her rights to appease the Northern Lords to keep them on side, to\u00a0keep them on the Stark side. Because you know what? Jon might not come back. Half her family never came back after going South. Look what happened to a young Bran when he was still at Winterfell after his family didn\u2019t come back. Later, she even says that she hasn\u2019t heard from Jon in weeks. When Arya accuses her of appeasing the Lords because Jon might not come back and she might need to rule well\u2026There is nothing wrong with her for thinking that, for preparing for that. Because there is a decent chance that could happen. It doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s what she wants it to happen.</p><p>Another point the show or scripts or article didn\u2019t take the opporunity to make is that if Sansa hoped to get rid of Littlefinger, she need the Northern Lords more specifically the Vale Lords on her side. She had to know they would ride or die for her and not because Littlefinger was telling them to support House Stark. She knows the Vale has no particularly loyalty to Jon not like the North does. So, yea, communicating in some way that Sansa was aware she needed their support not to usurpy Jon but to get rid of LF\u2026would have be the smart move.\u00a0 \u00a0<br><b>The Game of Faces</b></p><p>A fan video theorizes that Arya is playing the Game of Faces with Sansa to test her.</p><p><b>What the show gets right: </b>If this was the case, this makes the Stark sister arc in season 7 a little bit better. The theory was compelling and Arya even says she is playing the game with Sansa.</p><p><b>What the show/scripts or article get wrong: </b>The article doesn\u2019t mention this at all. So, either the scripts don\u2019t go into detail about it beyond the dialogue Sansa and Arya have about the game. <br></p><p><b>The realization</b><br>Sansa realized Littlefinger was up to no good when he suggests Arya wants to be Lady of Winterfell.</p><p><b>What the show gets right:</b> Sansa would start to put all of Littlefinger\u2019s machinations together.

Yea, I could see it all going that way.</p><p><b>What the show/scripts or article get wrong: </b>There is a cutscene somewhere of her going to Bran for help. Sansa would definitely have done this. She tells Jon in season 6 \u2018Only a fool would trust Littlefinger.\u2019 In the beginning of season 7, she is wary of him and pretty rude to him. Then she appears to start to listen to him more while still be a bit cold to him? This really doesn\u2019t make a ton of sense. Why would she stop taking her own advice? She\u2019s not an idiot. The source of Cersei\u2019s letter had to be Littlefinger. He was there when she was forced to write it. It\u2019s possible the longer Jon is gone the more vulnerable Sansa feels. Or the tension with Arya is making her forget her earlier caution. Or she could be keeping him close to try to figure things out. The scripts and/or article seem to suggest she was almost tricked by him\u2026<br><br>And on screen it\u2019s still a bit confusing, it seemed like she decided to get rid of Littlefinger not just when he suggests Arya might want to be Lady of Winterfell but when he suggests Jon might want to marry Daenerys. Do the scripts mention Sansa\u2019s internal thoughts around this? Why not discuss both these things as the red flags that push Sansa to take out Littlefinger. And furthermore, it seems more probable that these were the things that push Sansa to act verse make her realize Littlefinger is trying to come between her family. She knew he couldn\u2019t be trusted from day 1. It was deciding when to act on that mistrust that Sansa had to determine. That she did it before Jon came back with a \u2018queen\u2019 with two dragons who is sure to cause her own amount of mistrust and drama, should show Sansa\u2019s prudence. It\u2019s more compelling to believe she was worried about the havoc Littlefinger might create in that situation.

                "content": "<p>I started to write this as a reblog from <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> post <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/180932201072/wardruna-jon-what-sansa-really-wants-is-jon\">here.</a>&nbsp;I wholeheartedly agree with her that what Sansa really wants is Jon. It got me thinking about another part about the recent script article in VF that bothered me. The treatment of the Stark sisters arc! It wasn&rsquo;t the part that annoyed me the most&hellip;but it did annoy me. AND I was frustrated by the arc at first. I&rsquo;ve started to come around to it despite the problems I think it still has.&nbsp;<br />I added this as a continuation of my thoughts on the article and scripts from yesterday. <a href=\"https://castaliareed.tumblr.com/post/180902446430/how-many-season-7-scripts-are-there-my-thoughts\">Here is part 1</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><b>The tension</b></p><p>The sisters argue over the letter Sansa was forced to write while captive in King&rsquo;s Landing, whether or not she sufficiently supports Jon, that she likes nice things. Arya pretty much attacks her for everything.&nbsp;</p><p><b>What the show got right:</b> Some tension between the sisters having to do with Jon. This was the same when they were kids. The first argument we ever see them have is about Jon! Arya coming home to find out that Sansa and Jon now have a trusting relationship and work together&hellip;well that was never going to sit well with her at first. They are probably going to have some tension over all kinds of things forever, always. They are too alike and too different&hellip;and they love each other.&nbsp;<br /><b>What it got wrong:</b> They missed a chance to highlight Arya&rsquo;s jealousy over all this. And Sansa&rsquo;s inability to put her sister at ease. Because really that&rsquo;s what it is in this particular edition of the Stark girls argue. This doesn&rsquo;t make Arya bad. Honestly, it makes her human. She missed out on retaking Winterfell. That&rsquo;s gotta sting for her. Sansa&rsquo;s proud of the help she gave in the battle, of Jon&rsquo;s trust in her, it&rsquo;s what she wanted from him. It&rsquo;s hard for her to explain this to Arya in a way that her sister will believe that it&rsquo;s all genuine.&nbsp;<br /></p><p><b>The threats</b><br />We know Arya threatens Sansa with the Valyrian steel dagger.&nbsp;</p><p><b>What the show got right:&nbsp;</b>The physicality of Arya&rsquo;s reactions to Sansa.
