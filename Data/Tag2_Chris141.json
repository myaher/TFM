Once you were buckled in, you texted your husband, Chris, letting him know you were on your way home.</p><p>His reply was simple: \u201cMeet me on the roof.\u201d</p><p>You smiled and replied that you would.</p><p>A short while later, the Uber car came to a stop in front of the modest, two story house you and Chris shared. You quickly gathered your belongings and then thanked the driver before getting out.</p><!-- more --><p>Chris had purchased the house before he\u2019d met you and had been in the process of remodeling it when you had started dating. It had been a sign of his faith in your relationship that he had let you help with some of the interior choices, including the big soaking tub in the master bedroom. The rooftop deck, just off the master bedroom, had been his idea, though, as had the telescope that was semi-permanently attached to part of it.</p><p>After entering the house, you headed straight up to the master bedroom, where you dropped your purse onto the bench at the end of the bed and kicked off your shoes. Knowing it was getting chilly outside, you changed out of the outfit you\u2019d worn to the game night at your friends and into a pair of sweatpants and a sweatshirt. Then you opened the door to the patio off the master bedroom and took the spiral stairs up to the rooftop deck.</p><p>The semi-secluded location of the house meant that there weren\u2019t many lights to interfere with the usage of the telescope, stargazing or, like tonight, meteor shower watching. You found Chris laying on top of an air mattress with a blanket on top of it with his face pointed towards the sky.</p><p>\u201cSee anything yet?\u201d You asked as you joined him, thankful he&rsquo;d thought to use the air mattress this time instead of the foam pad that the two of you had used previously.</p><p>\u201cA couple,\u201d he replied, moving his eyes from the sky to look at you. \u201cHow was game night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs fantastic as ever,\u201d you said as you snuggled up against him. For as hot as it had been that day, the night was cooling off quickly. \u201cWe played Cards Against Humanity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the super soldier card come up?\u201d Chris asked as an amused smile tugged on his lips.</p><p>You smirked, but playfully zipped your lips, unwilling to say. Not that you could, anyway.</p><p>Every month or so, you and ten girlfriends (give or take a few) got together for a game night, at a different house each time, with the host choosing the game. As the night was an escape from the real world and a judgement free zone (or rather a zone where everyone\u2019s judgement was free, as one friend liked to put it), you had all agreed that what happened there, stayed between you all.</p><p>\u201cKnowing all of you, I\u2019m going to say it did and that I don\u2019t even want to imagine that card it was played on,\u201d Chris replied, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cProbably for the best,\u201d you admitted as you turned your gaze to the sky above just in time to see a streak of light across the sky. \u201cOooh!\u201d</p><p>Silence fell between you and Chris as you guys watched the sky, oohing and awing over the streaks as they appeared.</p><p>As the night grew cooler, the two of you slipped under the blanket, which he had put on top of an unzipped sleeping bag, so the chill from the air mattress wouldn&rsquo;t make you colder. Eventually, you found yourself wide awake and tired of lying still. Glancing at Chris, you saw his eyes were still pointed to the sky and you smiled as you snaked your hand over to caress his torso over his sweatshirt.</p><p>His eyes flicked down to meet yours, in the dark, and you smiled innocently.</p><p>\u201cJust ignore me,\u201d you told him as you pushed the sweatshirt up, revealing his skin to your hands.</p><p>He scoffed at your instructions, but returned his gaze to the sky, anyway.</p><p>You took your time exploring his body with your left hand as you laid on your side next to him. He shifted his body in response to your touch, but didn\u2019t comment.</p><p>In fact, the only sound that left his mouth, due to what you were doing, was a grunt when your hand slipped under the waistband of his pants and brushed the sensitive flesh of his hard cock. A series of moans and grunts flowed from him as your hand began the familiar pattern you knew he used on himself when the two of you were apart.</p><p>Wanting to do what he couldn\u2019t when he was alone, you pushed back the blank, forcing a gasp from him as the cool night air came in contact with his heated flesh. The gasp came to a strangled end, however, as you replaced your hand with your mouth. His hand found the back of your head and fisted itself in your hair, slowly guiding your movements as you licked and sucked him.</p><p>His cries of ecstasy seemed to be louder than normal as they drowned out the other night sounds. His hips jerked of their own accord as he came, filling your mouth with his seed, before his whole body became limp.</p><p>\u201cPretty sure you\u2019ve killed me,\u201d he muttered, a few minutes later, as you laid tucked up against him again. You\u2019d pulled his pants back into place as he had recovered and had brought the blanket back up to cover the two of you.</p><p>\u201cThat would be a real shame,\u201d you replied. \u201cI had plans for you later tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of plans?\u201d He asked, eyebrow quirked.</p><p>\u201cThe kind where we\u2019re both naked under the stars and making love,\u201d you teased. \u201cBut if you\u2019re dead, I might have to go find one of those high-tech sex toys I use when you\u2019re gone\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey now,\u201d he said, cutting you off. \u201cNo need to go with the artificial when the real thing is right here. Just give me a bit\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe real thing is always better,\u201d you assured him. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting naked might help the process,\u201d he suggested. \u201cSpeed things up a bit, ya know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d you replied.</p><p>The air mattress dipped and shifted as the two of you slipped off your clothes without leaving the warmth of the blanket. Once naked, you pressed your body against Chris\u2019s and asked, \u201cHow\u2019s the process?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch better,\u201d he replied with a slight hitch to his voice. He rolled towards you, rocking you backwards due to the air mattress below you, then gathered you in his arms, his right hand cupping your ass as he leaned in to kiss you.</p><p>The meteor shower was forgotten as the two of you embraced, kissing and caressing each other\u2019s body. Soon, however, you found yourself looking up at the sky as Chris zigzagged his way down your body ultimately nestling himself between your legs. You clutched the blanket to your chest as he kept your lower body warm. And it certainly wasn\u2019t a streak of light in the sky that made you gasp, a moment later.</p><p>Chris was, by far, the best kisser you\u2019d ever experienced and he knew how to transfer those skills to the lips between your legs. Your hips rocked as he lapped at your folds all the while using his fingers to heighten the experience for you. He truly was a man of many talents.</p><p>Your entire body stiffened as your climax hit and you had no control over the sounds that escaped your mouth. A shudder raced through your body as it relaxed, but it was still a moment or two before you seemingly returned to your body.</p><p>\u201cMust have been an amazing show up there,\u201d he teased as he rose to his knees, his beard glistening with your juices.</p><p>\u201cIt was definitely out of this world,\u201d you replied breathlessly, which made a cocky smile spread across his face. \u201cAre you ready yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter what I just witnessed? Damn right I\u2019m ready,\u201d he replied, turning slightly to the side to show off the impressive erection he was sporting.</p><p>\u201cThen give it to me, baby,\u201d you replied, opening your legs wide for him.</p><p>\u201cUh huh, uh huh,\u201d he responded, picking up on your \u2018Pretty Fly for a White Guy\u2019 lyric reference, it was, after all, one of your favorite karaoke songs. He positioned himself back between your legs and teased you both for a second before plunging into you.</p><p>The air mattress sank below you at the combination of yours and Chris\u2019s weight on one section, but didn\u2019t give. At least, not at first. It survived for the first several thrusts, but as Chris dug in and drove into you with an extra umph, you felt the air mattress give and suddenly found yourself with just the sleeping bag between you and the decking.</p><p>Startled, Chris paused in his movements to look down at you before he let out a bark of laughter. You joined him, but then wrapped a leg around his hips, reminding him of the job he was in the middle of doing.</p><p>He gave a brief nod of his head before pulling out and then filling you again quickly. You closed your eyes as you lost yourself in the passion of it all as your body moved in sync with Chris\u2019s. Maybe it was his earlier release or the laughter in the middle of it all, but the two of you came together, his release triggering your own.</p><p>After pulling out of you, he stretched out beside you, his chest rising and falling as much as your own. Common sense told you to get up and go inside, but you didn\u2019t want to leave his side. It became even harder when he pulled the forgotten blanket back over the two of you.</p><p>Sometime later, the first rain drop landed on your forehead, startling you out of the light sleep you\u2019d fallen into. The second and third followed quickly and you heard Chris curse next to you.</p><p>Still naked, the two of you scrambled out of the blankets and what remained of the air mattress and grabbed your phones from the clothes pile before racing down the spiral staircase and into the master bedroom.</p><hr><p>Want to find me off tumblr?

Once you were buckled in, you texted your husband, Chris, letting him know you were on your way home.</p><p>His reply was simple: \u201cMeet me on the roof.\u201d</p><p>You smiled and replied that you would.</p><p>A short while later, the Uber car came to a stop in front of the modest, two story house you and Chris shared. You quickly gathered your belongings and then thanked the driver before getting out.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Chris had purchased the house before he\u2019d met you and had been in the process of remodeling it when you had started dating. It had been a sign of his faith in your relationship that he had let you help with some of the interior choices, including the big soaking tub in the master bedroom. The rooftop deck, just off the master bedroom, had been his idea, though, as had the telescope that was semi-permanently attached to part of it.</p><p>After entering the house, you headed straight up to the master bedroom, where you dropped your purse onto the bench at the end of the bed and kicked off your shoes. Knowing it was getting chilly outside, you changed out of the outfit you\u2019d worn to the game night at your friends and into a pair of sweatpants and a sweatshirt. Then you opened the door to the patio off the master bedroom and took the spiral stairs up to the rooftop deck.</p><p>The semi-secluded location of the house meant that there weren\u2019t many lights to interfere with the usage of the telescope, stargazing or, like tonight, meteor shower watching. You found Chris laying on top of an air mattress with a blanket on top of it with his face pointed towards the sky.</p><p>\u201cSee anything yet?\u201d You asked as you joined him, thankful he\u2019d thought to use the air mattress this time instead of the foam pad that the two of you had used previously.</p><p>\u201cA couple,\u201d he replied, moving his eyes from the sky to look at you. \u201cHow was game night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs fantastic as ever,\u201d you said as you snuggled up against him. For as hot as it had been that day, the night was cooling off quickly. \u201cWe played Cards Against Humanity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the super soldier card come up?\u201d Chris asked as an amused smile tugged on his lips.</p><p>You smirked, but playfully zipped your lips, unwilling to say. Not that you could, anyway.</p><p>Every month or so, you and ten girlfriends (give or take a few) got together for a game night, at a different house each time, with the host choosing the game. As the night was an escape from the real world and a judgement free zone (or rather a zone where everyone\u2019s judgement was free, as one friend liked to put it), you had all agreed that what happened there, stayed between you all.</p><p>\u201cKnowing all of you, I\u2019m going to say it did and that I don\u2019t even want to imagine that card it was played on,\u201d Chris replied, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cProbably for the best,\u201d you admitted as you turned your gaze to the sky above just in time to see a streak of light across the sky. \u201cOooh!\u201d</p><p>Silence fell between you and Chris as you guys watched the sky, oohing and awing over the streaks as they appeared.</p><p>As the night grew cooler, the two of you slipped under the blanket, which he had put on top of an unzipped sleeping bag, so the chill from the air mattress wouldn\u2019t make you colder. Eventually, you found yourself wide awake and tired of lying still. Glancing at Chris, you saw his eyes were still pointed to the sky and you smiled as you snaked your hand over to caress his torso over his sweatshirt.</p><p>His eyes flicked down to meet yours, in the dark, and you smiled innocently.</p><p>\u201cJust ignore me,\u201d you told him as you pushed the sweatshirt up, revealing his skin to your hands.</p><p>He scoffed at your instructions, but returned his gaze to the sky, anyway.</p><p>You took your time exploring his body with your left hand as you laid on your side next to him. He shifted his body in response to your touch, but didn\u2019t comment.</p><p>In fact, the only sound that left his mouth, due to what you were doing, was a grunt when your hand slipped under the waistband of his pants and brushed the sensitive flesh of his hard cock. A series of moans and grunts flowed from him as your hand began the familiar pattern you knew he used on himself when the two of you were apart.</p><p>Wanting to do what he couldn\u2019t when he was alone, you pushed back the blank, forcing a gasp from him as the cool night air came in contact with his heated flesh. The gasp came to a strangled end, however, as you replaced your hand with your mouth. His hand found the back of your head and fisted itself in your hair, slowly guiding your movements as you licked and sucked him.</p><p>His cries of ecstasy seemed to be louder than normal as they drowned out the other night sounds. His hips jerked of their own accord as he came, filling your mouth with his seed, before his whole body became limp.</p><p>\u201cPretty sure you\u2019ve killed me,\u201d he muttered, a few minutes later, as you laid tucked up against him again. You\u2019d pulled his pants back into place as he had recovered and had brought the blanket back up to cover the two of you.</p><p>\u201cThat would be a real shame,\u201d you replied. \u201cI had plans for you later tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of plans?\u201d He asked, eyebrow quirked.</p><p>\u201cThe kind where we\u2019re both naked under the stars and making love,\u201d you teased. \u201cBut if you\u2019re dead, I might have to go find one of those high-tech sex toys I use when you\u2019re gone\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey now,\u201d he said, cutting you off. \u201cNo need to go with the artificial when the real thing is right here. Just give me a bit\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe real thing is always better,\u201d you assured him. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting naked might help the process,\u201d he suggested. \u201cSpeed things up a bit, ya know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d you replied.</p><p>The air mattress dipped and shifted as the two of you slipped off your clothes without leaving the warmth of the blanket. Once naked, you pressed your body against Chris\u2019s and asked, \u201cHow\u2019s the process?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch better,\u201d he replied with a slight hitch to his voice. He rolled towards you, rocking you backwards due to the air mattress below you, then gathered you in his arms, his right hand cupping your ass as he leaned in to kiss you.</p><p>The meteor shower was forgotten as the two of you embraced, kissing and caressing each other\u2019s body. Soon, however, you found yourself looking up at the sky as Chris zigzagged his way down your body ultimately nestling himself between your legs. You clutched the blanket to your chest as he kept your lower body warm. And it certainly wasn\u2019t a streak of light in the sky that made you gasp, a moment later.</p><p>Chris was, by far, the best kisser you\u2019d ever experienced and he knew how to transfer those skills to the lips between your legs. Your hips rocked as he lapped at your folds all the while using his fingers to heighten the experience for you. He truly was a man of many talents.</p><p>Your entire body stiffened as your climax hit and you had no control over the sounds that escaped your mouth. A shudder raced through your body as it relaxed, but it was still a moment or two before you seemingly returned to your body.</p><p>\u201cMust have been an amazing show up there,\u201d he teased as he rose to his knees, his beard glistening with your juices.</p><p>\u201cIt was definitely out of this world,\u201d you replied breathlessly, which made a cocky smile spread across his face. \u201cAre you ready yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter what I just witnessed? Damn right I\u2019m ready,\u201d he replied, turning slightly to the side to show off the impressive erection he was sporting.</p><p>\u201cThen give it to me, baby,\u201d you replied, opening your legs wide for him.</p><p>\u201cUh huh, uh huh,\u201d he responded, picking up on your \u2018Pretty Fly for a White Guy\u2019 lyric reference, it was, after all, one of your favorite karaoke songs. He positioned himself back between your legs and teased you both for a second before plunging into you.</p><p>The air mattress sank below you at the combination of yours and Chris\u2019s weight on one section, but didn\u2019t give. At least, not at first. It survived for the first several thrusts, but as Chris dug in and drove into you with an extra umph, you felt the air mattress give and suddenly found yourself with just the sleeping bag between you and the decking.</p><p>Startled, Chris paused in his movements to look down at you before he let out a bark of laughter. You joined him, but then wrapped a leg around his hips, reminding him of the job he was in the middle of doing.</p><p>He gave a brief nod of his head before pulling out and then filling you again quickly. You closed your eyes as you lost yourself in the passion of it all as your body moved in sync with Chris\u2019s. Maybe it was his earlier release or the laughter in the middle of it all, but the two of you came together, his release triggering your own.</p><p>After pulling out of you, he stretched out beside you, his chest rising and falling as much as your own. Common sense told you to get up and go inside, but you didn\u2019t want to leave his side. It became even harder when he pulled the forgotten blanket back over the two of you.</p><p>Sometime later, the first rain drop landed on your forehead, startling you out of the light sleep you\u2019d fallen into. The second and third followed quickly and you heard Chris curse next to you.</p><p>Still naked, the two of you scrambled out of the blankets and what remained of the air mattress and grabbed your phones from the clothes pile before racing down the spiral staircase and into the master bedroom.</p><hr><p>Want to find me off tumblr?

Just give me a bit\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe real thing is always better,\u201d you assured him. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting naked might help the process,\u201d he suggested. \u201cSpeed things up a bit, ya know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d you replied.</p><p>The air mattress dipped and shifted as the two of you slipped off your clothes without leaving the warmth of the blanket. Once naked, you pressed your body against Chris\u2019s and asked, \u201cHow\u2019s the process?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch better,\u201d he replied with a slight hitch to his voice. He rolled towards you, rocking you backwards due to the air mattress below you, then gathered you in his arms, his right hand cupping your ass as he leaned in to kiss you.</p><p>The meteor shower was forgotten as the two of you embraced, kissing and caressing each other\u2019s body. Soon, however, you found yourself looking up at the sky as Chris zigzagged his way down your body ultimately nestling himself between your legs. You clutched the blanket to your chest as he kept your lower body warm. And it certainly wasn\u2019t a streak of light in the sky that made you gasp, a moment later.</p><p>Chris was, by far, the best kisser you\u2019d ever experienced and he knew how to transfer those skills to the lips between your legs. Your hips rocked as he lapped at your folds all the while using his fingers to heighten the experience for you. He truly was a man of many talents.</p><p>Your entire body stiffened as your climax hit and you had no control over the sounds that escaped your mouth. A shudder raced through your body as it relaxed, but it was still a moment or two before you seemingly returned to your body.</p><p>\u201cMust have been an amazing show up there,\u201d he teased as he rose to his knees, his beard glistening with your juices.</p><p>\u201cIt was definitely out of this world,\u201d you replied breathlessly, which made a cocky smile spread across his face. \u201cAre you ready yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter what I just witnessed? Damn right I\u2019m ready,\u201d he replied, turning slightly to the side to show off the impressive erection he was sporting.</p><p>\u201cThen give it to me, baby,\u201d you replied, opening your legs wide for him.</p><p>\u201cUh huh, uh huh,\u201d he responded, picking up on your \u2018Pretty Fly for a White Guy\u2019 lyric reference, it was, after all, one of your favorite karaoke songs. He positioned himself back between your legs and teased you both for a second before plunging into you.</p><p>The air mattress sank below you at the combination of yours and Chris\u2019s weight on one section, but didn\u2019t give. At least, not at first. It survived for the first several thrusts, but as Chris dug in and drove into you with an extra umph, you felt the air mattress give and suddenly found yourself with just the sleeping bag between you and the decking.</p><p>Startled, Chris paused in his movements to look down at you before he let out a bark of laughter. You joined him, but then wrapped a leg around his hips, reminding him of the job he was in the middle of doing.</p><p>He gave a brief nod of his head before pulling out and then filling you again quickly. You closed your eyes as you lost yourself in the passion of it all as your body moved in sync with Chris\u2019s. Maybe it was his earlier release or the laughter in the middle of it all, but the two of you came together, his release triggering your own.</p><p>After pulling out of you, he stretched out beside you, his chest rising and falling as much as your own. Common sense told you to get up and go inside, but you didn\u2019t want to leave his side. It became even harder when he pulled the forgotten blanket back over the two of you.</p><p>Sometime later, the first rain drop landed on your forehead, startling you out of the light sleep you\u2019d fallen into. The second and third followed quickly and you heard Chris curse next to you.</p><p>Still naked, the two of you scrambled out of the blankets and what remained of the air mattress and grabbed your phones from the clothes pile before racing down the spiral staircase and into the master bedroom.</p><hr><p>Want to find me off tumblr?

Once you were buckled in, you texted your husband, Chris, letting him know you were on your way home.</p><p>His reply was simple: &ldquo;Meet me on the roof.&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled and replied that you would.</p><p>A short while later, the Uber car came to a stop in front of the modest, two story house you and Chris shared. You quickly gathered your belongings and then thanked the driver before getting out.</p><p>Chris had purchased the house before he&rsquo;d met you and had been in the process of remodeling it when you had started dating. It had been a sign of his faith in your relationship that he had let you help with some of the interior choices, including the big soaking tub in the master bedroom. The rooftop deck, just off the master bedroom, had been his idea, though, as had the telescope that was semi-permanently attached to part of it.</p><p>After entering the house, you headed straight up to the master bedroom, where you dropped your purse onto the bench at the end of the bed and kicked off your shoes. Knowing it was getting chilly outside, you changed out of the outfit you&rsquo;d worn to the game night at your friends and into a pair of sweatpants and a sweatshirt. Then you opened the door to the patio off the master bedroom and took the spiral stairs up to the rooftop deck.</p><p>The semi-secluded location of the house meant that there weren&rsquo;t many lights to interfere with the usage of the telescope, stargazing or, like tonight, meteor shower watching. You found Chris laying on top of an air mattress with a blanket on top of it with his face pointed towards the sky.</p><p>&ldquo;See anything yet?&rdquo; You asked as you joined him, thankful he&rsquo;d thought to use the air mattress this time instead of the foam pad that the two of you had used previously.</p><p>&ldquo;A couple,&rdquo; he replied, moving his eyes from the sky to look at you. &ldquo;How was game night?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As fantastic as ever,&rdquo; you said as you snuggled up against him. For as hot as it had been that day, the night was cooling off quickly. &ldquo;We played Cards Against Humanity.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did the super soldier card come up?&rdquo; Chris asked as an amused smile tugged on his lips.</p><p>You smirked, but playfully zipped your lips, unwilling to say. Not that you could, anyway.</p><p>Every month or so, you and ten girlfriends (give or take a few) got together for a game night, at a different house each time, with the host choosing the game. As the night was an escape from the real world and a judgement free zone (or rather a zone where everyone&rsquo;s judgement was free, as one friend liked to put it), you had all agreed that what happened there, stayed between you all.</p><p>&ldquo;Knowing all of you, I&rsquo;m going to say it did and that I don&rsquo;t even want to imagine that card it was played on,&rdquo; Chris replied, shaking his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Probably for the best,&rdquo; you admitted as you turned your gaze to the sky above just in time to see a streak of light across the sky. &ldquo;Oooh!&rdquo;</p><p>Silence fell between you and Chris as you guys watched the sky, oohing and awing over the streaks as they appeared.</p><p>As the night grew cooler, the two of you slipped under the blanket, which he had put on top of an unzipped sleeping bag, so the chill from the air mattress wouldn&rsquo;t make you colder. Eventually, you found yourself wide awake and tired of lying still. Glancing at Chris, you saw his eyes were still pointed to the sky and you smiled as you snaked your hand over to caress his torso over his sweatshirt.</p><p>His eyes flicked down to meet yours, in the dark, and you smiled innocently.</p><p>&ldquo;Just ignore me,&rdquo; you told him as you pushed the sweatshirt up, revealing his skin to your hands.</p><p>He scoffed at your instructions, but returned his gaze to the sky, anyway.</p><p>You took your time exploring his body with your left hand as you laid on your side next to him. He shifted his body in response to your touch, but didn&rsquo;t comment.</p><p>In fact, the only sound that left his mouth, due to what you were doing, was a grunt when your hand slipped under the waistband of his pants and brushed the sensitive flesh of his hard cock. A series of moans and grunts flowed from him as your hand began the familiar pattern you knew he used on himself when the two of you were apart.</p><p>Wanting to do what he couldn&rsquo;t when he was alone, you pushed back the blank, forcing a gasp from him as the cool night air came in contact with his heated flesh. The gasp came to a strangled end, however, as you replaced your hand with your mouth. His hand found the back of your head and fisted itself in your hair, slowly guiding your movements as you licked and sucked him.</p><p>His cries of ecstasy seemed to be louder than normal as they drowned out the other night sounds. His hips jerked of their own accord as he came, filling your mouth with his seed, before his whole body became limp.</p><p>&ldquo;Pretty sure you&rsquo;ve killed me,&rdquo; he muttered, a few minutes later, as you laid tucked up against him again. You&rsquo;d pulled his pants back into place as he had recovered and had brought the blanket back up to cover the two of you.</p><p>&ldquo;That would be a real shame,&rdquo; you replied. &ldquo;I had plans for you later tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What kind of plans?&rdquo; He asked, eyebrow quirked.</p><p>&ldquo;The kind where we&rsquo;re both naked under the stars and making love,&rdquo; you teased. &ldquo;But if you&rsquo;re dead, I might have to go find one of those high-tech sex toys I use when you&rsquo;re gone&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey now,&rdquo; he said, cutting you off. &ldquo;No need to go with the artificial when the real thing is right here.

He&rsquo;d won a majority of the rounds that night and they all knew he wouldn&rsquo;t let them forget anytime soon.</p><p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m out of money,&rdquo; Bryant Gomez stated as he pushed his chair back. They&rsquo;d each come with twenty dollars in change (nickels, dimes and quarters) and, while the others had won at least one round, he hadn&rsquo;t won anything. &ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll head home and let the babysitter go early.&rdquo;</p><!-- more --><p>Chris, Scott and the other three said goodbye to Bryant, each giving him a bro hug, before he made his way to the front door. From the dining room where they were playing, they heard him say something to someone, followed by the closing of the front door.</p><p>A click clack of heels on the wood floor alerted them to the fact that Ellie had returned from her girls&rsquo; night. &ldquo;Hey boys,&rdquo; she greeted from the doorway. &ldquo;Enjoying yourselves?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m having a great time,&rdquo; Chris smirked as he got up to give her a kiss.</p><p>From his seat, Scott watched the two interact and then an idea hit him as Chris made his way back to his seat. &ldquo;Hey, El, you should play with us,&rdquo; he suggested. The last time he&rsquo;d played poker with Ellie was when she and his brother hadn&rsquo;t been talking and she had kicked his ass.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no, that&rsquo;s ok,&rdquo; Ellie replied, waving off the offer. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want to intrude.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; Brock Alexander assured her. &ldquo;Actually, with you here distracting Chris, maybe one of us will get the chance to win.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I bet Chris would even give up some of his winnings for you to buy in,&rdquo; Chucky Kelley said, hiding a smile behind his beer bottle.</p><p>&ldquo;So, what do you say, Chris, you going to let your lady play with us?&rdquo; Ray Locke asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, sure, if she wants to,&rdquo; Chris replied, looking up at her. &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;</p><p>Ellie looked at the five faces unsure of how to answer, but then she saw the very slight nod of Scott&rsquo;s head and a very brief look of pain on his face. Cocking an eyebrow, she slipped her purse from her shoulder and tossed it onto the sideboard. &ldquo;Well, if you guys want me to then I guess deal me in,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Let me grab something to drink and I&rsquo;ll be ready.&rdquo;</p><p>Going into the kitchen, she wasn&rsquo;t surprised at all when Scott followed her. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s being a bad winner again?&rdquo; she assumed, pulling out a bottle of water for herself and a new beer for Scott.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s insufferable,&rdquo; Scott groaned as he used a bottle opener to pull the lid off. &ldquo;Hope you&rsquo;re ready to kick his ass.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m always ready to do that,&rdquo; she stated with a laugh. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do this, shall we?&rdquo;</p><p>An hour later, it was just herself, Chris and Scott sitting at the table still playing. Chris&rsquo;s other friends had left either due to being out of money or because their wives, who Ellie had been out with, had called to find out when they would be home. Chris had still won some of the rounds, but Ellie, or one of the others, had won more.</p><p>&ldquo;Well shit,&rdquo; Scott muttered when he too ran out of money and had to watch Chris collect his winnings. &ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll head out, too.&rdquo;</p><p>After he collected his stuff, Chris and Ellie walked him to the front door where he gave them both a hug and kissed Ellie&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;Kick his ass,&rdquo; he whispered, making her laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;What did he say to you?&rdquo; Chris asked after closing the door behind his brother.</p><p>&ldquo;He told me to kick your ass,&rdquo; Ellie said with a smirk as she headed back to the dining room. &ldquo;Fancy another round?&rdquo; she called over her shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Only if we raise the stakes,&rdquo; Chris told her.</p><p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo; she asked, turning to look at him with her eyebrows raised in interest.</p><p>&ldquo;No money. Just clothes,&rdquo; he stated. Then, being a gentleman, he offered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll even take off my shoes so we start evenly,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Ellie agreed. Then she sassed, &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re ready to get naked,&rdquo; as she sat down in a chair across from the one he&rsquo;d been sitting in.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I plan on getting naked, but only after you,&rdquo; he shot back. &ldquo;My ma raised me to be gentleman. Ladies first, <i>always</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bring it on,&rdquo; Ellie stated as he took his seat. &ldquo;You deal first.&rdquo;</p><p>They split the first four rounds, both choosing to remove their socks, but then choosing other things to remove. Chris removed his flannel shirt while Ellie opted to remove her pants. Chris won the round after that and whistled when Ellie took of her shirt, revealing a strapless black bra that matched her black panties.</p><p>&ldquo;Enjoy it while you can,&rdquo; she snapped as she sat back down. &ldquo;My deal.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You might as well give up now,&rdquo; Chris said, cockily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to lose, it&rsquo;s inevitable.&rdquo;</p><p>Except, it was Chris that lost the next hand and the hand after that. Leaving him in just his black, boxer briefs and secretly glad he hadn&rsquo;t decided to freeball it that day.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to lose this,&rdquo; he stated as she smiled smugly across the table from him as he dealt the next hand. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be the one naked in two hands.&rdquo;</p><p>Putting the deck down, he picked up his cards and internally groaned when he saw that it was complete shit. With his face trained on his cards, he chanced a sidelong glance at Ellie to see if he could tell from her face what her hand was like and regretted it immediately. He could tell from the way she was biting into her lower lip that she was trying to force back a smile.</p><p>With a silent prayer, he squared his shoulders and started the round, knowing he was likely going to be the first one naked. Ellie discarded one card and seemed happy, unfortunate for him, with the exchange. Based on her demeanor, he took a desperate chance and threw out three of his cards, only holding on to the two cards that were in the same suit. It didn&rsquo;t pay off and he ended up with lower cards that he&rsquo;d started with.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; he muttered and tossed his cards onto the table. &ldquo;I know you won, just show me what you had.&rdquo;</p><p>A wide smile broke across Ellie&rsquo;s face as she placed her cards on the table, revealing a pair of fours with three shit cards.</p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck?!&rdquo; Chris exclaimed, jumping to his feet. He gestured to the cards and waved his arms in complete disbelief as Ellie laughed hysterically. &ldquo;You fucking punked me!!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t matter how you win as long as you win,&rdquo; Ellie snickered. &ldquo;Now take 'em off, big boy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This is complete bullshit,&rdquo; Chris glared at her as his fingers found the waistband of his boxers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing this, but it&rsquo;s under protest.&rdquo;</p><p>Ellie rolled her eyes at his words but let out a catcall when he pushed his boxers down. Her cheers were quickly followed by boos when he used one of his hands to hide the part of his anatomy she wanted to see the most. &ldquo;Hey! Move your hand, you&rsquo;re cheating,&rdquo; she complained.</p><p>&ldquo;The deal was to get naked, that doesn&rsquo;t mean I have to give you a show,&rdquo; Chris retorted as he stepped out of his boxers once they hit the floor. &ldquo;Now, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me.&rdquo;</p><p>Ellie watched in partial shock and partial amusement as he left the dining room with one hand covering his front and the other his back. Curious as to where he was going, she followed him into the kitchen and screamed when he grabbed her as she walked into the room.</p><p>&ldquo;I might be the naked one, but we&rsquo;re both going for a swim,&rdquo; he told her as he lifted her off her feet and carried her towards the backdoor.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait! Let me take off my jewelry,&rdquo; Ellie said, grabbing the edge of the island as they passed.</p><p>Chris obliged, only because he knew that she was wearing jewelry passed down from her grandmother, and set her down, but kept himself positioned at her side so she couldn&rsquo;t get away. As he waited, his eyes landed on the hooks that held her bra in place. Without a second&rsquo;s hesitation, he unhooked the bra with a flick of his wrist and grinned when she laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;Damnit, Chris,&rdquo; she said, shaking her head as the bra dropped to the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he said, cajolingly. &ldquo;The pool will be way more fun if we&rsquo;re both naked.&rdquo; His fingers slid down her body to the waistband of her panties. He rested them there, waiting for her ok to proceed. &ldquo;Come on, Ellie.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; she caved and squealed when he yanked the panties down her legs as he did a quick squat.</p><p>&ldquo;Step out and let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; he ordered.</p><p>Ellie obeyed and then found his hand, squeezing it to say she was ready. They made their way out to the pool area, choosing not to turn on the outdoor lights, and soon were standing at the edge of the heated pool, illuminated by lights in the walls.</p><p>&ldquo;You ready?&rdquo; Chris asked, glancing down at her.</p><p>&ldquo;Ready,&rdquo; Ellie nodded.</p><p>Chris counted to three and then they jumped, hands locked together as they hit the water.</p><p><a href=\"https://theycallmebeccawrites.tumblr.com/post/182643499203/chris-ellie-series-episode-15\">Episode 15</a></p><hr><p>Want to find me off tumblr?

From the dining room where they were playing, they heard him say something to someone, followed by the closing of the front door.</p><p>A click clack of heels on the wood floor alerted them to the fact that Ellie had returned from her girls\u2019 night. \u201cHey boys,\u201d she greeted from the doorway. \u201cEnjoying yourselves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having a great time,\u201d Chris smirked as he got up to give her a kiss.</p><p>From his seat, Scott watched the two interact and then an idea hit him as Chris made his way back to his seat. \u201cHey, El, you should play with us,\u201d he suggested. The last time he\u2019d played poker with Ellie was when she and his brother hadn\u2019t been talking and she had kicked his ass.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, that\u2019s ok,\u201d Ellie replied, waving off the offer. \u201cDon\u2019t want to intrude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be,\u201d Brock Alexander assured her. \u201cActually, with you here distracting Chris, maybe one of us will get the chance to win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet Chris would even give up some of his winnings for you to buy in,\u201d Chucky Kelley said, hiding a smile behind his beer bottle.</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you say, Chris, you going to let your lady play with us?\u201d Ray Locke asked.</p><p>\u201cUh, sure, if she wants to,\u201d Chris replied, looking up at her. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>Ellie looked at the five faces unsure of how to answer, but then she saw the very slight nod of Scott\u2019s head and a very brief look of pain on his face. Cocking an eyebrow, she slipped her purse from her shoulder and tossed it onto the sideboard. \u201cWell, if you guys want me to then I guess deal me in,\u201d she replied. \u201cLet me grab something to drink and I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>Going into the kitchen, she wasn\u2019t surprised at all when Scott followed her. \u201cHe\u2019s being a bad winner again?\u201d she assumed, pulling out a bottle of water for herself and a new beer for Scott.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s insufferable,\u201d Scott groaned as he used a bottle opener to pull the lid off. \u201cHope you\u2019re ready to kick his ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m always ready to do that,\u201d she stated with a laugh. \u201cLet\u2019s do this, shall we?\u201d</p><p>An hour later, it was just herself, Chris and Scott sitting at the table still playing. Chris\u2019s other friends had left either due to being out of money or because their wives, who Ellie had been out with, had called to find out when they would be home. Chris had still won some of the rounds, but Ellie, or one of the others, had won more.</p><p>\u201cWell shit,\u201d Scott muttered when he too ran out of money and had to watch Chris collect his winnings. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll head out, too.\u201d</p><p>After he collected his stuff, Chris and Ellie walked him to the front door where he gave them both a hug and kissed Ellie\u2019s cheek. \u201cKick his ass,\u201d he whispered, making her laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say to you?\u201d Chris asked after closing the door behind his brother.</p><p>\u201cHe told me to kick your ass,\u201d Ellie said with a smirk as she headed back to the dining room. \u201cFancy another round?\u201d she called over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cOnly if we raise the stakes,\u201d Chris told her.</p><p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d she asked, turning to look at him with her eyebrows raised in interest.</p><p>\u201cNo money. Just clothes,\u201d he stated. Then, being a gentleman, he offered, \u201cI\u2019ll even take off my shoes so we start evenly,\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Ellie agreed. Then she sassed, \u201cI hope you\u2019re ready to get naked,\u201d as she sat down in a chair across from the one he\u2019d been sitting in.</p><p>\u201cOh, I plan on getting naked, but only after you,\u201d he shot back. \u201cMy ma raised me to be gentleman. Ladies first, <i>always</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring it on,\u201d Ellie stated as he took his seat. \u201cYou deal first.\u201d</p><p>They split the first four rounds, both choosing to remove their socks, but then choosing other things to remove. Chris removed his flannel shirt while Ellie opted to remove her pants. Chris won the round after that and whistled when Ellie took of her shirt, revealing a strapless black bra that matched her black panties.</p><p>\u201cEnjoy it while you can,\u201d she snapped as she sat back down. \u201cMy deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might as well give up now,\u201d Chris said, cockily. \u201cYou\u2019re going to lose, it\u2019s inevitable.\u201d</p><p>Except, it was Chris that lost the next hand and the hand after that. Leaving him in just his black, boxer briefs and secretly glad he hadn\u2019t decided to freeball it that day.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to lose this,\u201d he stated as she smiled smugly across the table from him as he dealt the next hand. \u201cYou\u2019ll be the one naked in two hands.\u201d</p><p>Putting the deck down, he picked up his cards and internally groaned when he saw that it was complete shit. With his face trained on his cards, he chanced a sidelong glance at Ellie to see if he could tell from her face what her hand was like and regretted it immediately. He could tell from the way she was biting into her lower lip that she was trying to force back a smile.</p><p>With a silent prayer, he squared his shoulders and started the round, knowing he was likely going to be the first one naked. Ellie discarded one card and seemed happy, unfortunate for him, with the exchange. Based on her demeanor, he took a desperate chance and threw out three of his cards, only holding on to the two cards that were in the same suit. It didn\u2019t pay off and he ended up with lower cards that he\u2019d started with.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he muttered and tossed his cards onto the table. \u201cI know you won, just show me what you had.\u201d</p><p>A wide smile broke across Ellie\u2019s face as she placed her cards on the table, revealing a pair of fours with three shit cards.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?!\u201d Chris exclaimed, jumping to his feet. He gestured to the cards and waved his arms in complete disbelief as Ellie laughed hysterically. \u201cYou fucking punked me!!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter how you win as long as you win,\u201d Ellie snickered. \u201cNow take 'em off, big boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is complete bullshit,\u201d Chris glared at her as his fingers found the waistband of his boxers. \u201cI\u2019m doing this, but it\u2019s under protest.\u201d</p><p>Ellie rolled her eyes at his words but let out a catcall when he pushed his boxers down. Her cheers were quickly followed by boos when he used one of his hands to hide the part of his anatomy she wanted to see the most. \u201cHey! Move your hand, you\u2019re cheating,\u201d she complained.</p><p>\u201cThe deal was to get naked, that doesn\u2019t mean I have to give you a show,\u201d Chris retorted as he stepped out of his boxers once they hit the floor. \u201cNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me.\u201d</p><p>Ellie watched in partial shock and partial amusement as he left the dining room with one hand covering his front and the other his back. Curious as to where he was going, she followed him into the kitchen and screamed when he grabbed her as she walked into the room.</p><p>\u201cI might be the naked one, but we\u2019re both going for a swim,\u201d he told her as he lifted her off her feet and carried her towards the backdoor.</p><p>\u201cWait! Let me take off my jewelry,\u201d Ellie said, grabbing the edge of the island as they passed.</p><p>Chris obliged, only because he knew that she was wearing jewelry passed down from her grandmother, and set her down, but kept himself positioned at her side so she couldn\u2019t get away. As he waited, his eyes landed on the hooks that held her bra in place. Without a second\u2019s hesitation, he unhooked the bra with a flick of his wrist and grinned when she laughed.</p><p>\u201cDamnit, Chris,\u201d she said, shaking her head as the bra dropped to the floor.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, cajolingly. \u201cThe pool will be way more fun if we\u2019re both naked.\u201d His fingers slid down her body to the waistband of her panties. He rested them there, waiting for her ok to proceed. \u201cCome on, Ellie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she caved and squealed when he yanked the panties down her legs as he did a quick squat.</p><p>\u201cStep out and let\u2019s go,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>Ellie obeyed and then found his hand, squeezing it to say she was ready. They made their way out to the pool area, choosing not to turn on the outdoor lights, and soon were standing at the edge of the heated pool, illuminated by lights in the walls.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Chris asked, glancing down at her.</p><p>\u201cReady,\u201d Ellie nodded.</p><p>Chris counted to three and then they jumped, hands locked together as they hit the water.</p><p><a href=\"https://theycallmebeccawrites.tumblr.com/post/182643499203/chris-ellie-series-episode-15\">Episode 15</a></p><hr><p>Want to find me off tumblr?

The last time he\u2019d played poker with Ellie was when she and his brother hadn\u2019t been talking and she had kicked his ass.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, that\u2019s ok,\u201d Ellie replied, waving off the offer. \u201cDon\u2019t want to intrude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be,\u201d Brock Alexander assured her. \u201cActually, with you here distracting Chris, maybe one of us will get the chance to win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet Chris would even give up some of his winnings for you to buy in,\u201d Chucky Kelley said, hiding a smile behind his beer bottle.</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you say, Chris, you going to let your lady play with us?\u201d Ray Locke asked.</p><p>\u201cUh, sure, if she wants to,\u201d Chris replied, looking up at her. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>Ellie looked at the five faces unsure of how to answer, but then she saw the very slight nod of Scott\u2019s head and a very brief look of pain on his face. Cocking an eyebrow, she slipped her purse from her shoulder and tossed it onto the sideboard. \u201cWell, if you guys want me to then I guess deal me in,\u201d she replied. \u201cLet me grab something to drink and I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>Going into the kitchen, she wasn\u2019t surprised at all when Scott followed her. \u201cHe\u2019s being a bad winner again?\u201d she assumed, pulling out a bottle of water for herself and a new beer for Scott.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s insufferable,\u201d Scott groaned as he used a bottle opener to pull the lid off. \u201cHope you\u2019re ready to kick his ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m always ready to do that,\u201d she stated with a laugh. \u201cLet\u2019s do this, shall we?\u201d</p><p>An hour later, it was just herself, Chris and Scott sitting at the table still playing. Chris\u2019s other friends had left either due to being out of money or because their wives, who Ellie had been out with, had called to find out when they would be home. Chris had still won some of the rounds, but Ellie, or one of the others, had won more.</p><p>\u201cWell shit,\u201d Scott muttered when he too ran out of money and had to watch Chris collect his winnings. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll head out, too.\u201d</p><p>After he collected his stuff, Chris and Ellie walked him to the front door where he gave them both a hug and kissed Ellie\u2019s cheek. \u201cKick his ass,\u201d he whispered, making her laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say to you?\u201d Chris asked after closing the door behind his brother.</p><p>\u201cHe told me to kick your ass,\u201d Ellie said with a smirk as she headed back to the dining room. \u201cFancy another round?\u201d she called over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cOnly if we raise the stakes,\u201d Chris told her.</p><p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d she asked, turning to look at him with her eyebrows raised in interest.</p><p>\u201cNo money. Just clothes,\u201d he stated. Then, being a gentleman, he offered, \u201cI\u2019ll even take off my shoes so we start evenly,\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Ellie agreed. Then she sassed, \u201cI hope you\u2019re ready to get naked,\u201d as she sat down in a chair across from the one he\u2019d been sitting in.</p><p>\u201cOh, I plan on getting naked, but only after you,\u201d he shot back. \u201cMy ma raised me to be gentleman. Ladies first, <i>always</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring it on,\u201d Ellie stated as he took his seat. \u201cYou deal first.\u201d</p><p>They split the first four rounds, both choosing to remove their socks, but then choosing other things to remove. Chris removed his flannel shirt while Ellie opted to remove her pants. Chris won the round after that and whistled when Ellie took of her shirt, revealing a strapless black bra that matched her black panties.</p><p>\u201cEnjoy it while you can,\u201d she snapped as she sat back down. \u201cMy deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might as well give up now,\u201d Chris said, cockily. \u201cYou\u2019re going to lose, it\u2019s inevitable.\u201d</p><p>Except, it was Chris that lost the next hand and the hand after that. Leaving him in just his black, boxer briefs and secretly glad he hadn\u2019t decided to freeball it that day.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to lose this,\u201d he stated as she smiled smugly across the table from him as he dealt the next hand. \u201cYou\u2019ll be the one naked in two hands.\u201d</p><p>Putting the deck down, he picked up his cards and internally groaned when he saw that it was complete shit. With his face trained on his cards, he chanced a sidelong glance at Ellie to see if he could tell from her face what her hand was like and regretted it immediately. He could tell from the way she was biting into her lower lip that she was trying to force back a smile.</p><p>With a silent prayer, he squared his shoulders and started the round, knowing he was likely going to be the first one naked. Ellie discarded one card and seemed happy, unfortunate for him, with the exchange. Based on her demeanor, he took a desperate chance and threw out three of his cards, only holding on to the two cards that were in the same suit. It didn\u2019t pay off and he ended up with lower cards that he\u2019d started with.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he muttered and tossed his cards onto the table. \u201cI know you won, just show me what you had.\u201d</p><p>A wide smile broke across Ellie\u2019s face as she placed her cards on the table, revealing a pair of fours with three shit cards.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?!\u201d Chris exclaimed, jumping to his feet. He gestured to the cards and waved his arms in complete disbelief as Ellie laughed hysterically. \u201cYou fucking punked me!!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter how you win as long as you win,\u201d Ellie snickered. \u201cNow take 'em off, big boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is complete bullshit,\u201d Chris glared at her as his fingers found the waistband of his boxers. \u201cI\u2019m doing this, but it\u2019s under protest.\u201d</p><p>Ellie rolled her eyes at his words but let out a catcall when he pushed his boxers down. Her cheers were quickly followed by boos when he used one of his hands to hide the part of his anatomy she wanted to see the most. \u201cHey! Move your hand, you\u2019re cheating,\u201d she complained.</p><p>\u201cThe deal was to get naked, that doesn\u2019t mean I have to give you a show,\u201d Chris retorted as he stepped out of his boxers once they hit the floor. \u201cNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me.\u201d</p><p>Ellie watched in partial shock and partial amusement as he left the dining room with one hand covering his front and the other his back. Curious as to where he was going, she followed him into the kitchen and screamed when he grabbed her as she walked into the room.</p><p>\u201cI might be the naked one, but we\u2019re both going for a swim,\u201d he told her as he lifted her off her feet and carried her towards the backdoor.</p><p>\u201cWait! Let me take off my jewelry,\u201d Ellie said, grabbing the edge of the island as they passed.</p><p>Chris obliged, only because he knew that she was wearing jewelry passed down from her grandmother, and set her down, but kept himself positioned at her side so she couldn\u2019t get away. As he waited, his eyes landed on the hooks that held her bra in place. Without a second\u2019s hesitation, he unhooked the bra with a flick of his wrist and grinned when she laughed.</p><p>\u201cDamnit, Chris,\u201d she said, shaking her head as the bra dropped to the floor.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, cajolingly. \u201cThe pool will be way more fun if we\u2019re both naked.\u201d His fingers slid down her body to the waistband of her panties. He rested them there, waiting for her ok to proceed. \u201cCome on, Ellie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she caved and squealed when he yanked the panties down her legs as he did a quick squat.</p><p>\u201cStep out and let\u2019s go,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>Ellie obeyed and then found his hand, squeezing it to say she was ready. They made their way out to the pool area, choosing not to turn on the outdoor lights, and soon were standing at the edge of the heated pool, illuminated by lights in the walls.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Chris asked, glancing down at her.</p><p>\u201cReady,\u201d Ellie nodded.</p><p>Chris counted to three and then they jumped, hands locked together as they hit the water.</p><p><a href=\"https://theycallmebeccawrites.tumblr.com/post/182643499203/chris-ellie-series-episode-15\">Episode 15</a></p><hr><p>Want to find me off tumblr?

He&rsquo;d won a majority of the rounds that night and they all knew he wouldn&rsquo;t let them forget anytime soon.</p><p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m out of money,&rdquo; Bryant Gomez stated as he pushed his chair back. They&rsquo;d each come with twenty dollars in change (nickels, dimes and quarters) and, while the others had won at least one round, he hadn&rsquo;t won anything. &ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll head home and let the babysitter go early.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris, Scott and the other three said goodbye to Bryant, each giving him a bro hug, before he made his way to the front door.
