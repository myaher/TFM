        "answer": "<p>Here you go! Thank you for this! xx. - MJ</p><!-- more --><p><b><br/></b>Peter was staring down the barrel of a gun.<b><br/></b></p><p>That\u2019s when it dawned on him, <i>oh, oh yeah, I am neck deep in shit. </i></p><p>See, no matter which way he swung this, he\u2019d still get his ass handed to him on a silver platter. If not by this gunman then by Aunt May or Tony; whichever one got to him first. It was hours passed his curfew but he was awakened by the police scanner beside his bed, reporting a jewelry store heist happening only a few blocks over. Queens was sizable city and a robbery was happening only a few blocks from where he lived. How could he not go? Aunt May couldn\u2019t possibly get mad at him for doing his job. It was only 2 AM and he\u2019d only be around the corner. Come on, that was pure Spider-Man luck. </p><p>It turned out the sensation he thought was luck was apparently indigestion from Aunt May\u2019s meatloaf because so far nothing was going his way. Two armed thieves had been webbed up but the third had ran leaving him alone with one.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bulletproof,\u201d Peter began, throwing his hands in the air. \u201cBut please, don\u2019t shoot me.\u201d The suit was bulletproof, sure, but that didn\u2019t mean getting shot wouldn\u2019t still hurt like hell. There was still flesh under all that nanotechnology. How would he explain bullet indentations to Mr. Stark? </p><p>The gunman smiled behind the ski mask, trailing the gun from his head and to his chest. </p><p>\u201cI will kill you.\u201d He cocked the gun. \u201cAnd history can decide whether I am the hero or the villain.\u201d </p><p>Peter shuddered. That sounded like something out of a James Bond movie. It would be kind of cool, if, <i>y\u2019know</i>, he didn\u2019t have a gun aimed at his chest. </p><p>\u201c<i>Yeahyeahyeah</i>, cool, cool, cool. I hear you, I do. But listen, I just had this suit dry cleaned and it would be a shame if you scuffed it with your bullets. So can we skip all the <i>shooty-shooty</i> stuff and jump to where I arrest you and then disappear into the sunrise?\u201d Peter slowly began tip backwards out of the door frame where the glass had been shattered. Faintly, in the distance, he could hear sirens nearing and behind him repulsors cut out and metal crunched the concrete behind him. Oh no. Papa Bear Stark was on the scene. </p><p>Suddenly, the gun was no longer trained on him but on the figure behind him. Immediately, bullets began to rain around him; the cacophonous <i>ping!</i> of metal bouncing off of metal filling the sleeping city. </p><p>\u201cGet behind me, Peter!\u201d Wait\u2026that was\u2026Peter spared a glance over his shoulder. \u201cUncle Colonel Rhodes?\u201d Peter immediately dove behind the commander. \u201cWhat are you doing here, sir?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSaving your ass, kid, Outta my way.\u201d War Machine stepped around Peter. Within seconds, the gunman was unarmed, cuffed and being guided to the police car out front. Hey, he could\u2019ve done that! </p><p>The fly back to Tower was mostly silence, aside from Peter\u2019s occasional protests that he wasn\u2019t injured and he preferred to sneak back into his apartment and go to bed before school tomorrow. </p><p>\u201cNope, Tony requested that he see you <i>personally</i>.\u201d Any other day, Peter would\u2019ve burst open like a pinata of joy under any other circumstance but he just felt throat constrict with panic. They landed outside on the launching pad, starting for the sliding doors. </p><p>\u201cBut I had it under control, Mr. Rhodes, sir! I mean, you saw!

Hey, he could&rsquo;ve done that! </p><p>The fly back to Tower was mostly silence, aside from Peter&rsquo;s occasional protests that he wasn&rsquo;t injured and he preferred to sneak back into his apartment and go to bed before school tomorrow. </p><p>&ldquo;Nope, Tony requested that he see you <i>personally</i>.&rdquo; Any other day, Peter would&rsquo;ve burst open like a pinata of joy under any other circumstance but he just felt throat constrict with panic. They landed outside on the launching pad, starting for the sliding doors. </p><p>&ldquo;But I had it under control, Mr. Rhodes, sir! I mean, you saw! The dude with the gun was all like &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll make you pay, <i>blargh</i>!&rsquo; and I was like &lsquo;Stop! I&rsquo;m Spider-Man!&rsquo; And then, then you came in! You were like &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve come to steal your thunder, Parker.&rsquo; Then the gun dude started shooting, all like <i>bratatata</i>! <i>Pshhew! Vvvvrr-</i>-&rdquo; Rhodey clapped a hand on Peter&rsquo;s shoulder. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah Peter, I was there.&rdquo; Rhodey disengaged the suit and tugged off Peter&rsquo;s mask. &ldquo;I know what happened.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It sounds like it was a blast!&rdquo; Peter whirled to his left where Tony was leaning against the door frame, clapping slowly. &ldquo;Real bang-up job, kid.&rdquo; Tony sauntered forwards, clapping a hand on James&rsquo; shoulders. &ldquo;Thanks, Rhodey. I got it from here.&rdquo; </p><p>Colonel nodded and cast a bleak glance at Peter before walking inside. </p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark! I was fine and I had everything under control&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pipe down, Minnie Mouse. I don&rsquo;t want to hear it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;But Mr. St&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can it, Squirt!&rdquo; Peter blinked. It was rare that Tony ever raised his voice but it got the job done. Shocked and wide eyed, Peter stood at attention. &ldquo;Riddle me this, Superman. How does a superhero protect his country, his state&ndash;<i> his neighborhood</i>, if he&rsquo;s dead?&rdquo; </p><p>Peter swallowed audibly. It was a rhetorical but Tony seemed to be waiting for an answer. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. He <i>can&rsquo;t</i>. You can&rsquo;t be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man if you let someone use you as target practice.&rdquo; Tony ran a hand over his face. &ldquo;Peter, the 5-0 handle things like this. Theft, vandalism, murder. That&rsquo;s stuff for the civilians. You need to learn to gauge the urgency of a situation. Walk little old ladies across the street, and save kittens from trees. But don&rsquo;t walk into gunfire! You have to stop putting your life on the line unnecessarily! You need to stop putting your life on the line, <i>period</i>!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, where were you, Mr. Stark?&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s voice rose out of him without much thought. &ldquo;<i>Huh</i>? Where were you then?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;At home! Just like you should&rsquo;ve been. I was home with one of my children, praying that my other one made it back safely! Oh, and trying to calm your aunt, who you scared the shit out of, mind you.&rdquo; Tony jabbed a thumb over his shoulder and Peter looked inside. In the doorway, stood Aunt May in her pajamas, holding his police radio. <i>Oh shit. </i>&ldquo;So next time you think it&rsquo;ll be fun to go dance the tango with an armed criminal, please, give someone a warning first.&rdquo;</p><p>The silence hung thickly between the two of them. Peter broke first, hanging his head. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I know you are, but go tell that to your aunt.&rdquo; Tony tugged Peter into a hug. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re home.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter let out a breath he didn&rsquo;t know he was holding. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go talk to May.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna be grounded until you&rsquo;re 30, I can tell you that.&rdquo; Tony snickered. </p><p>Peter winced. Yeah, he had seen that coming. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh goodie.&rdquo; </p>",

All.</p><!-- more --><p>He had been the\nfirst guest to arrive on their first morning in the lakeside house, his leg\nbraces whining slightly as he walked up from his car.</p><p>&ldquo;The kid\nin?&rdquo; Peter heard through the window of the workshop, as he tried to match\nthe description from a design notebook to an object on the shelf, left there\nmid-work by Mr Stark, probably days - maybe hours - before he had worked out\nhow to properly use that time-travel-dimension-skipping-thing.</p><p>&ldquo;There\u2019s always a piece of unfinished work left,&rdquo; he\nsaid softly, trying to recall from where the quote might have come. &ldquo;But\nthen, I suppose, I will be the one to finish these particular pieces.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call\nhim that,&rdquo; Pepper&rsquo;s voice travelled the distance between the main house\nand the shed. &ldquo;He does have a name, you know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony always\ncalled him &lsquo;kid&rsquo;. I&rsquo;d have to focus to remember, what was it, Patrick&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo;\nshe corrected. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;d better remember this, because he is definitely\nnot going away, no matter what various people had suggested recently.&rdquo;</p><p>The man sighed so\nheavily Peter grimaced.</p><p><i>Here it comes, the 'adult male wisdom&rsquo;.</i></p><p>He caught himself\nidentifying things that he had heard Aunt May complain about <i>forever</i>. From being patronised, to being\nconstantly corrected to having things explained to him by people who knew <i>less</i> about it than he did.</p><p>Because he was a\nkid.</p><p>Because being a kid\nput him in the same category as women. He would one day grow out of that\ncategory and <i>become</i> an adult male,\nwhich was apparently the only way one could <i>stop</i>\nbeing patronised, corrected and told stuff.</p><p>MJ, however, had no\nsuch option. And neither had Pepper or Aunt May - they were already quite grown\nup and that didn&rsquo;t deter people from talking to them 'slowly and kindly&rsquo;, which\nwas usually prefaced with a suffering sigh or other adequate sounds.</p><p>If that was a part\nof being an adult, he wanted nothing to do with it.</p><p>MJ hated being\npatronised.</p><p>He wondered whether\nthere was some kind of general amnesia thing that men suffered from when they\ngraduated or if it was more of a kind of a society-wide hazing - with the\noppressed ones getting promoted to the ruling group and finally getting their\nturn.</p><p>&ldquo;Pepper\u2014&rdquo;\nuh-oh, the suggestive pause of wisdom. &ldquo;What the hell are you doing with\nthat kid? He is just some troublemaker from Queens, why would you even\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony wanted\nit,&rdquo; she said simply and Peter felt a wave of warmth wash over him.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony wanted a\nlot of things, not all of them sensible. If you keep this up, who will the kid\ngrow up to be? What is his future? What are his prospects? He will get used to\nthe quality and then&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then, I\nsuppose, if I do everything correctly, my husband&rsquo;s apprentice will become my\nchief designer. \u00a0I can&rsquo;t lose him,\nRhodey. I&rsquo;m not going to suddenly&hellip; just discard him. If for no other reason\nthan that Tony liked him and wanted him around. And with him being the only\nperson bright enough to pick up Tony&rsquo;s unfinished work&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>He blinked.</p><p><i>Oh.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Tony had put\nit in the will,&rdquo; Pepper continued. &ldquo;And you know what? I like the\nboy. I wish we had had more time for him to work with Tony. I see his work -\nI&rsquo;m not a designer, Rhodey. I&rsquo;m a businesswoman. But I recognise good\nengineering ideas when I see them. Tony would have benefited from having Peter\naround for these five years.&rdquo;</p><p>Another Tortured\nMale Sigh.</p><p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you projecting,\njust a tiny bit?&rdquo;</p><p><i>Oh, geez, even I know that sounded like\nthe worst&hellip;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Look\nhere,&rdquo; she clicked something metallic. &ldquo;These are the controls for\nthe Rescue unit. Look at them and tell me I&rsquo;m projecting, or I&rsquo;m delusional or\nthat Tony didn&rsquo;t really want what I&rsquo;m saying right now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mommy\nmode,&rdquo; the Colonel sounded puzzled.</p><p>&ldquo;Override for\nMorgan&rsquo;s capsule. Beacon, homing in and full overrides to steer it in case of\ndanger. And a beacon tracker for Morgan herself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So what? This\nseems perfectly reasonable&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>Click, click.</p><p>&ldquo;Mother\nmode&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Beacon,\npatching in to external and internal sensors, no overrides unless the life\nsigns drop below certain level.&rdquo;</p><p>The man sighed\nagain.</p><p>&ldquo;You had the\nkid chipped?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Both of them.\nPeter&rsquo;s design, in fact. But he wasn&rsquo;t the one to put this in my suit, Rhodey.\nIt was Tony. He added some routine that would discover what Peter works on\nbased on Tony&rsquo;s basic layouts and it ties these things together. And yes, Peter\nknows about them, before you ask. He is the one who wrote all the needed code\nfor the capsule overrides.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Does he know\nabout his suit being on this list?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter could easily\nvisualise Pepper&rsquo;s eyeroll.</p><p>&ldquo;How could he\nnot, since he is rebuilding the next one now - and building the new Rescue unit\n- and he implements the same routines in each of them anew?&rdquo;</p><p>Of course he knew.\nAnd he knew how much it annoyed him when Mr Stark used the override. And he\nknew&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;The overrides\nin Tony&rsquo;s suits are even stronger, up to and including locking or running some\nfunctions independently from Peter&rsquo;s direct orders.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip;\nmessed up, seriously,&rdquo; Colonel Rhodes sounded somewhat upset for some\nreason.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, Iron\nMan One has override for all the suits Tony made,&rdquo; Pepper seemed, in turn,\nsomewhat indifferent.</p><p>A silent breath or\ntwo passed.</p><p>&ldquo;And by Iron\nMan One, which suit do you mean, exactly?&rdquo;</p><p>Low voice. Very low\nvoice.</p><p><i>Adult male threatening tone.</i></p><p>Before he noticed,\nhe was at the door and taking long steps into the living room.</p><p>&ldquo;That would be\nany suit being currently worn by Iron Man,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;It works a\nbit like Air Force One, I suppose. Whichever suit Mr Stark was wearing,\nautomatically became the top of the hierarchy, with Rescue coming as the second\none. Also, I&rsquo;ll enable these overrides in my suit, Pepper. Just in case.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, I\ndon&rsquo;t need you to&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You do. And I\ndon&rsquo;t mind. Mr Stark used them a few times and I must admit it was plenty\nannoying, but what if something happens to me and you have to be there for\nMorgan? You won&rsquo;t be able to take her everywhere and&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine,\nfine,&rdquo; Colonel Rhodes interrupted him harshly. &ldquo;Which of the suits\nhas the Iron Man One priority right now?&rdquo;</p><p>He seemed rather\nintent on the topic and Peter kind of wasn&rsquo;t surprised.</p><p>&ldquo;Friday, which\nunits currently have override control on Rescue unit?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;None of them,\nPeter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There, you\nhave it. Friday says there is no suit with override on Rescue, and since Rescue\nis the second in the hierarchy - becomes automatically the first, with IM One\nnot present. But Rescue only has limited override and&hellip;&rdquo; he looked up at Pepper.\n&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s going to have.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Friday,&rdquo;\nthe colonel said, when Peter paused. &ldquo;Which of the inactive units had the\npotential to override Rescue unit?&rdquo;</p><p>A beat.</p><p>Until Peter nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;All of the\nsuits in the Iron Man category have this potential, colonel.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What would be\nneeded to activate that functionality?&rdquo;</p><p>Another pause.</p><p>Another nod.</p><p>&ldquo;It would\nrequire Mr Stark&rsquo;s presence or a delegated individual of Mr Stark&rsquo;s choosing to\nactivate.&rdquo;</p><p>Rhodes raised his\neyebrows and looked at Pepper questioningly. She shrugged and nodded at Peter,\nwho smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,\nGod,&rdquo; the colonel sighed. &ldquo;One last question then&hellip; Who the heck\nmade that highly intelligent decision?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony,&rdquo;\n&ldquo;Mr Stark,&rdquo; &ldquo;The boss&rdquo; they spoke at the same time.</p><p>The big man moaned.</p><p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s\nonly the Iron Man suits,&rdquo; Pepper said reassuringly. &ldquo;Right now Peter\nis using his own, which is not in the same cate&hellip;&rdquo; she trailed off, her\neyes widening slightly as the sight of Peter&rsquo;s wrists. &ldquo;Category,&rdquo;\nshe swallowed and coughed. &ldquo;Sorry. Peter, could you bring me the water?\nThe pollen makes my throat dry out in seconds.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo;\nhe smiled and nodded at Rhodes. &ldquo;Anything for you, sir?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Something\nthat will make me forget what I&rsquo;ve just heard,&rdquo; the man groaned. &ldquo;But\nin the absence of hard liquor, anything cold will be fine. Thank you,\nParker.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Call me\nPeter, sir. Parker is what my teachers call me and this is supposed to be a\nvacation&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>The moment he\ncrossed the doorway, Rhodes turned towards Pepper and started whispering\nfuriously. Peter sighed and tried not to listen, but, as usual, all his senses\nsharpened immediately. Stress always made his hearing much stronger, after all.</p><p>And he froze.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;formalised!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t.\nI mean, seriously, Rhodey, what would you have done?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.\nNot like I am Tony Stark, am I?&rdquo;</p><p>Pepper sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;I know what\nhe&hellip; what he&hellip;&rdquo; she swallowed, he could <i>hear</i> it, even from across the building. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure if there\nis a procedure for this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Adopting\nsomeone? There is a whole department of Child Protective Services for this,\nPepper, don&rsquo;t be obtuse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But there was\nno procedure for adopting a non-existent seventeen-year-old&hellip;!&rdquo;</p><p>A miniature\nsupernova went off in Peter&rsquo;s brain.</p><p>&ldquo;It would have\nworked before the Decimation - he was at school and Tony was alive and&hellip; and\nnow he is too old for this,&rdquo; he heard Pepper say. &ldquo;And it wasn&rsquo;t even\nabout that, really. I mean, Tony did write a will that puts Peter as the main\nbeneficiary - well, after Morgan and me, but a big chunk of mine is shared with\nPeter, for management purposes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dear God, did\nhe mean to sign off everything to that kid&hellip;!?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you\nnever seen them together?&rdquo; Pepper countered softly. &ldquo;I wish I had had\nthis kind of relationship with my own parents&hellip;! And no, definitely not\neverything, since the company is <i>mine</i>.\nPeter has a large chunk of shares which mainly wait until he turns twenty-five,\nas per Tony&rsquo;s directions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not\nsure I won&rsquo;t be signing the control over to Pepper at the very second I get\nit,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I am completely serious. Code? Nanites? AI? I can\nwork with that. Finances and arguing with the stakeholders&hellip; not that much.\nAnd I&rsquo;m not being coy <i>or</i> cocky,&rdquo;\nhe sniffed and shrugged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m being realistic. And, well, I&rsquo;m not angling\nat Pepper&rsquo;s job. Not in this universe or any other. And I will do whatever is\nneeded to make sure she keeps it, too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Enhanced\nsenses then, kid?&rdquo; the colonel took over the jug of lemonade Peter had\ncarried to the table, leaving Peter with just Pepper&rsquo;s water bottle, which\nPeter proceeded to toss towards her, making the soldier flinch, just a bit.\nPepper fetched it from the air with the tiniest possible smirk.</p><p>&ldquo;Sir, I can\nhear everything in the radius of&hellip; Maybe a mile. More or less. If I&rsquo;m in fight\nmode, it&rsquo;s more, expands with stress. I can tell you how many people there are\nnow around the property and that one of your accompanying drivers is playing\nCandy Crush with his sound on. Also, I am now disturbingly sure that bears do\nin fact shit in the woods, which is not something I was at any point wishing I\ncould confirm. There are seventeen mice and three lizards living in the\nbasement. Sorry, Pepper. There is a nest of crows nearby, and there are several\nsmaller animals I&rsquo;m not familiar with, living in the growth around the lake. I\nknow what your people are gossipping about - mostly celebrities, I think.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pepper, did\nyou know about this&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pepper knows,\nCaptain Wilson knows, doctor Banner knows, director Fury knows&hellip;&rdquo; he\nshrugged.</p><p>It seemed that\nsomething had come to a stop. The whole visit, it was supposed to be about\nsomething, about Rhodey and him and about - somehow - the older man assuming\nsome kind of responsibility for something.</p><p><i>Fuck me if I&rsquo;m going to make it easy for\nhim. I may not be Iron Man, but I am his bloody apprentice and if there is one\nthing I will prove to all of them&hellip; is that I&rsquo;m not going to be an easy\ntarget.</i></p><p>He looked up at\nPepper, who nodded slightly.</p><p><i>OK then. Ladies first.</i></p><p>&ldquo;What exactly\ndo you want from Peter, Rhodey?&rdquo; she asked bluntly, putting her bottle\naway. &ldquo;Because if you want to somehow impose on him - get him to\nparticipate in some military stunt or, even worse, provide materials for\nsomething&hellip;&rdquo; she leaned forward, &ldquo;I will boot you out of this house\nwithout remorse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not <i>exactly</i> that,&rdquo; the colonel\nprevaricated and Peter saw his host roll her eyes at the claim.</p><p><i>Oh,\nboy. Here goes my afternoon. I just hope Morgan will be willing to spill some\njuice on him after dinner. </i><i>It should make him\nleave.</i></p><p><i><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJUF9-OuH82Ubc6_Jnje_BA\" target=\"_blank\">@bad-poetry-rants-and-fandoms</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlNFARFgjS__4PgiS6zAhcw\" target=\"_blank\">@hpswl-cumbercookie</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m11ThvfqEUttsb1G9K6aNHA\" target=\"_blank\">@all-the-fangeekiness</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUO_V5vLoYStzfXuSRokSnQ\" target=\"_blank\">@jessieblackwood</a></i></p>",

At. All.</p>[[MORE]]<p>He had been the\nfirst guest to arrive on their first morning in the lakeside house, his leg\nbraces whining slightly as he walked up from his car.</p><p>\u201cThe kid\nin?\u201d Peter heard through the window of the workshop, as he tried to match\nthe description from a design notebook to an object on the shelf, left there\nmid-work by Mr Stark, probably days - maybe hours - before he had worked out\nhow to properly use that time-travel-dimension-skipping-thing.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a piece of unfinished work left,\u201d he\nsaid softly, trying to recall from where the quote might have come. \u201cBut\nthen, I suppose, I will be the one to finish these particular pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call\nhim that,\u201d Pepper\u2019s voice travelled the distance between the main house\nand the shed. \u201cHe does have a name, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony always\ncalled him \u2018kid\u2019. I\u2019d have to focus to remember, what was it, Patrick\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d\nshe corrected. \u201cAnd you\u2019d better remember this, because he is definitely\nnot going away, no matter what various people had suggested recently.\u201d</p><p>The man sighed so\nheavily Peter grimaced.</p><p><i>Here it comes, the 'adult male wisdom\u2019.</i></p><p>He caught himself\nidentifying things that he had heard Aunt May complain about <i>forever</i>. From being patronised, to being\nconstantly corrected to having things explained to him by people who knew <i>less</i> about it than he did.</p><p>Because he was a\nkid.</p><p>Because being a kid\nput him in the same category as women. He would one day grow out of that\ncategory and <i>become</i> an adult male,\nwhich was apparently the only way one could <i>stop</i>\nbeing patronised, corrected and told stuff.</p><p>MJ, however, had no\nsuch option. And neither had Pepper or Aunt May - they were already quite grown\nup and that didn\u2019t deter people from talking to them 'slowly and kindly\u2019, which\nwas usually prefaced with a suffering sigh or other adequate sounds.</p><p>If that was a part\nof being an adult, he wanted nothing to do with it.</p><p>MJ hated being\npatronised.</p><p>He wondered whether\nthere was some kind of general amnesia thing that men suffered from when they\ngraduated or if it was more of a kind of a society-wide hazing - with the\noppressed ones getting promoted to the ruling group and finally getting their\nturn.</p><p>\u201cPepper\u2014\u201d\nuh-oh, the suggestive pause of wisdom. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing with\nthat kid? He is just some troublemaker from Queens, why would you even\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony wanted\nit,\u201d she said simply and Peter felt a wave of warmth wash over him.</p><p>\u201cTony wanted a\nlot of things, not all of them sensible. If you keep this up, who will the kid\ngrow up to be? What is his future? What are his prospects? He will get used to\nthe quality and then\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, I\nsuppose, if I do everything correctly, my husband\u2019s apprentice will become my\nchief designer. \u00a0I can\u2019t lose him,\nRhodey. I\u2019m not going to suddenly\u2026 just discard him. If for no other reason\nthan that Tony liked him and wanted him around. And with him being the only\nperson bright enough to pick up Tony\u2019s unfinished work\u2026\u201d</p><p>He blinked.</p><p><i>Oh.</i></p><p>\u201cTony had put\nit in the will,\u201d Pepper continued. \u201cAnd you know what? I like the\nboy. I wish we had had more time for him to work with Tony. I see his work -\nI\u2019m not a designer, Rhodey. I\u2019m a businesswoman. But I recognise good\nengineering ideas when I see them. Tony would have benefited from having Peter\naround for these five years.\u201d</p><p>Another Tortured\nMale Sigh.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you projecting,\njust a tiny bit?\u201d</p><p><i>Oh, geez, even I know that sounded like\nthe worst\u2026</i></p><p>\u201cLook\nhere,\u201d she clicked something metallic. \u201cThese are the controls for\nthe Rescue unit. Look at them and tell me I\u2019m projecting, or I\u2019m delusional or\nthat Tony didn\u2019t really want what I\u2019m saying right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMommy\nmode,\u201d the Colonel sounded puzzled.</p><p>\u201cOverride for\nMorgan\u2019s capsule. Beacon, homing in and full overrides to steer it in case of\ndanger. And a beacon tracker for Morgan herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what? This\nseems perfectly reasonable\u2026?\u201d</p><p>Click, click.</p><p>\u201cMother\nmode\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeacon,\npatching in to external and internal sensors, no overrides unless the life\nsigns drop below certain level.\u201d</p><p>The man sighed\nagain.</p><p>\u201cYou had the\nkid chipped?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth of them.\nPeter\u2019s design, in fact. But he wasn\u2019t the one to put this in my suit, Rhodey.\nIt was Tony. He added some routine that would discover what Peter works on\nbased on Tony\u2019s basic layouts and it ties these things together. And yes, Peter\nknows about them, before you ask. He is the one who wrote all the needed code\nfor the capsule overrides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he know\nabout his suit being on this list?\u201d</p><p>Peter could easily\nvisualise Pepper\u2019s eyeroll.</p><p>\u201cHow could he\nnot, since he is rebuilding the next one now - and building the new Rescue unit\n- and he implements the same routines in each of them anew?\u201d</p><p>Of course he knew.\nAnd he knew how much it annoyed him when Mr Stark used the override. And he\nknew\u2026</p><p>\u201cThe overrides\nin Tony\u2019s suits are even stronger, up to and including locking or running some\nfunctions independently from Peter\u2019s direct orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\nmessed up, seriously,\u201d Colonel Rhodes sounded somewhat upset for some\nreason.</p><p>\u201cWell, Iron\nMan One has override for all the suits Tony made,\u201d Pepper seemed, in turn,\nsomewhat indifferent.</p><p>A silent breath or\ntwo passed.</p><p>\u201cAnd by Iron\nMan One, which suit do you mean, exactly?\u201d</p><p>Low voice. Very low\nvoice.</p><p><i>Adult male threatening tone.</i></p><p>Before he noticed,\nhe was at the door and taking long steps into the living room.</p><p>\u201cThat would be\nany suit being currently worn by Iron Man,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt works a\nbit like Air Force One, I suppose. Whichever suit Mr Stark was wearing,\nautomatically became the top of the hierarchy, with Rescue coming as the second\none. Also, I\u2019ll enable these overrides in my suit, Pepper. Just in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, I\ndon\u2019t need you to\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do. And I\ndon\u2019t mind. Mr Stark used them a few times and I must admit it was plenty\nannoying, but what if something happens to me and you have to be there for\nMorgan? You won\u2019t be able to take her everywhere and\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\nfine,\u201d Colonel Rhodes interrupted him harshly. \u201cWhich of the suits\nhas the Iron Man One priority right now?\u201d</p><p>He seemed rather\nintent on the topic and Peter kind of wasn\u2019t surprised.</p><p>\u201cFriday, which\nunits currently have override control on Rescue unit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of them,\nPeter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere, you\nhave it. Friday says there is no suit with override on Rescue, and since Rescue\nis the second in the hierarchy - becomes automatically the first, with IM One\nnot present. But Rescue only has limited override and\u2026\u201d he looked up at Pepper.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s going to have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriday,\u201d\nthe colonel said, when Peter paused. \u201cWhich of the inactive units had the\npotential to override Rescue unit?\u201d</p><p>A beat.</p><p>Until Peter nodded.</p><p>\u201cAll of the\nsuits in the Iron Man category have this potential, colonel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would be\nneeded to activate that functionality?\u201d</p><p>Another pause.</p><p>Another nod.</p><p>\u201cIt would\nrequire Mr Stark\u2019s presence or a delegated individual of Mr Stark\u2019s choosing to\nactivate.\u201d</p><p>Rhodes raised his\neyebrows and looked at Pepper questioningly. She shrugged and nodded at Peter,\nwho smiled.</p><p>\u201cOh,\nGod,\u201d the colonel sighed. \u201cOne last question then\u2026 Who the heck\nmade that highly intelligent decision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d\n\u201cMr Stark,\u201d \u201cThe boss\u201d they spoke at the same time.</p><p>The big man moaned.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s\nonly the Iron Man suits,\u201d Pepper said reassuringly. \u201cRight now Peter\nis using his own, which is not in the same cate\u2026\u201d she trailed off, her\neyes widening slightly as the sight of Peter\u2019s wrists. \u201cCategory,\u201d\nshe swallowed and coughed. \u201cSorry. Peter, could you bring me the water?\nThe pollen makes my throat dry out in seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d\nhe smiled and nodded at Rhodes. \u201cAnything for you, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething\nthat will make me forget what I\u2019ve just heard,\u201d the man groaned. \u201cBut\nin the absence of hard liquor, anything cold will be fine. Thank you,\nParker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me\nPeter, sir. Parker is what my teachers call me and this is supposed to be a\nvacation\u2026\u201d</p><p>The moment he\ncrossed the doorway, Rhodes turned towards Pepper and started whispering\nfuriously. Peter sighed and tried not to listen, but, as usual, all his senses\nsharpened immediately. Stress always made his hearing much stronger, after all.</p><p>And he froze.</p><p>\u201c\u2026formalised!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t.\nI mean, seriously, Rhodey, what would you have done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\nNot like I am Tony Stark, am I?\u201d</p><p>Pepper sighed.</p><p>\u201cI know what\nhe\u2026 what he\u2026\u201d she swallowed, he could <i>hear</i> it, even from across the building. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if there\nis a procedure for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdopting\nsomeone?

At. All.</p><p>He had been the\nfirst guest to arrive on their first morning in the lakeside house, his leg\nbraces whining slightly as he walked up from his car.</p><p>&ldquo;The kid\nin?&rdquo; Peter heard through the window of the workshop, as he tried to match\nthe description from a design notebook to an object on the shelf, left there\nmid-work by Mr Stark, probably days - maybe hours - before he had worked out\nhow to properly use that time-travel-dimension-skipping-thing.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s always a piece of unfinished work left,&rdquo; he\nsaid softly, trying to recall from where the quote might have come. &ldquo;But\nthen, I suppose, I will be the one to finish these particular pieces.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call\nhim that,&rdquo; Pepper&rsquo;s voice travelled the distance between the main house\nand the shed. &ldquo;He does have a name, you know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony always\ncalled him &lsquo;kid&rsquo;. I&rsquo;d have to focus to remember, what was it, Patrick&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo;\nshe corrected. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;d better remember this, because he is definitely\nnot going away, no matter what various people had suggested recently.&rdquo;</p><p>The man sighed so\nheavily Peter grimaced.</p><p><i>Here it comes, the 'adult male wisdom&rsquo;.</i></p><p>He caught himself\nidentifying things that he had heard Aunt May complain about <i>forever</i>. From being patronised, to being\nconstantly corrected to having things explained to him by people who knew <i>less</i> about it than he did.</p><p>Because he was a\nkid.</p><p>Because being a kid\nput him in the same category as women. He would one day grow out of that\ncategory and <i>become</i> an adult male,\nwhich was apparently the only way one could <i>stop</i>\nbeing patronised, corrected and told stuff.</p><p>MJ, however, had no\nsuch option. And neither had Pepper or Aunt May - they were already quite grown\nup and that didn&rsquo;t deter people from talking to them 'slowly and kindly&rsquo;, which\nwas usually prefaced with a suffering sigh or other adequate sounds.</p><p>If that was a part\nof being an adult, he wanted nothing to do with it.</p><p>MJ hated being\npatronised.</p><p>He wondered whether\nthere was some kind of general amnesia thing that men suffered from when they\ngraduated or if it was more of a kind of a society-wide hazing - with the\noppressed ones getting promoted to the ruling group and finally getting their\nturn.</p><p>&ldquo;Pepper&mdash;&rdquo;\nuh-oh, the suggestive pause of wisdom. &ldquo;What the hell are you doing with\nthat kid? He is just some troublemaker from Queens, why would you even&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony wanted\nit,&rdquo; she said simply and Peter felt a wave of warmth wash over him.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony wanted a\nlot of things, not all of them sensible. If you keep this up, who will the kid\ngrow up to be? What is his future? What are his prospects? He will get used to\nthe quality and then&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then, I\nsuppose, if I do everything correctly, my husband&rsquo;s apprentice will become my\nchief designer. &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t lose him,\nRhodey. I&rsquo;m not going to suddenly&hellip; just discard him. If for no other reason\nthan that Tony liked him and wanted him around. And with him being the only\nperson bright enough to pick up Tony&rsquo;s unfinished work&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>He blinked.</p><p><i>Oh.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Tony had put\nit in the will,&rdquo; Pepper continued. &ldquo;And you know what? I like the\nboy. I wish we had had more time for him to work with Tony. I see his work -\nI&rsquo;m not a designer, Rhodey. I&rsquo;m a businesswoman. But I recognise good\nengineering ideas when I see them. Tony would have benefited from having Peter\naround for these five years.&rdquo;</p><p>Another Tortured\nMale Sigh.</p><p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you projecting,\njust a tiny bit?&rdquo;</p><p><i>Oh, geez, even I know that sounded like\nthe worst&hellip;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Look\nhere,&rdquo; she clicked something metallic. &ldquo;These are the controls for\nthe Rescue unit. Look at them and tell me I&rsquo;m projecting, or I&rsquo;m delusional or\nthat Tony didn&rsquo;t really want what I&rsquo;m saying right now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mommy\nmode,&rdquo; the Colonel sounded puzzled.</p><p>&ldquo;Override for\nMorgan&rsquo;s capsule. Beacon, homing in and full overrides to steer it in case of\ndanger. And a beacon tracker for Morgan herself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So what? This\nseems perfectly reasonable&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>Click, click.</p><p>&ldquo;Mother\nmode&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Beacon,\npatching in to external and internal sensors, no overrides unless the life\nsigns drop below certain level.&rdquo;</p><p>The man sighed\nagain.</p><p>&ldquo;You had the\nkid chipped?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Both of them.\nPeter&rsquo;s design, in fact. But he wasn&rsquo;t the one to put this in my suit, Rhodey.\nIt was Tony. He added some routine that would discover what Peter works on\nbased on Tony&rsquo;s basic layouts and it ties these things together. And yes, Peter\nknows about them, before you ask. He is the one who wrote all the needed code\nfor the capsule overrides.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Does he know\nabout his suit being on this list?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter could easily\nvisualise Pepper&rsquo;s eyeroll.</p><p>&ldquo;How could he\nnot, since he is rebuilding the next one now - and building the new Rescue unit\n- and he implements the same routines in each of them anew?&rdquo;</p><p>Of course he knew.\nAnd he knew how much it annoyed him when Mr Stark used the override. And he\nknew&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;The overrides\nin Tony&rsquo;s suits are even stronger, up to and including locking or running some\nfunctions independently from Peter&rsquo;s direct orders.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip;\nmessed up, seriously,&rdquo; Colonel Rhodes sounded somewhat upset for some\nreason.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, Iron\nMan One has override for all the suits Tony made,&rdquo; Pepper seemed, in turn,\nsomewhat indifferent.</p><p>A silent breath or\ntwo passed.</p><p>&ldquo;And by Iron\nMan One, which suit do you mean, exactly?&rdquo;</p><p>Low voice. Very low\nvoice.</p><p><i>Adult male threatening tone.</i></p><p>Before he noticed,\nhe was at the door and taking long steps into the living room.</p><p>&ldquo;That would be\nany suit being currently worn by Iron Man,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;It works a\nbit like Air Force One, I suppose. Whichever suit Mr Stark was wearing,\nautomatically became the top of the hierarchy, with Rescue coming as the second\none. Also, I&rsquo;ll enable these overrides in my suit, Pepper. Just in case.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, I\ndon&rsquo;t need you to&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You do. And I\ndon&rsquo;t mind. Mr Stark used them a few times and I must admit it was plenty\nannoying, but what if something happens to me and you have to be there for\nMorgan? You won&rsquo;t be able to take her everywhere and&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine,\nfine,&rdquo; Colonel Rhodes interrupted him harshly. &ldquo;Which of the suits\nhas the Iron Man One priority right now?&rdquo;</p><p>He seemed rather\nintent on the topic and Peter kind of wasn&rsquo;t surprised.</p><p>&ldquo;Friday, which\nunits currently have override control on Rescue unit?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;None of them,\nPeter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There, you\nhave it. Friday says there is no suit with override on Rescue, and since Rescue\nis the second in the hierarchy - becomes automatically the first, with IM One\nnot present. But Rescue only has limited override and&hellip;&rdquo; he looked up at Pepper.\n&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s going to have.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Friday,&rdquo;\nthe colonel said, when Peter paused. &ldquo;Which of the inactive units had the\npotential to override Rescue unit?&rdquo;</p><p>A beat.</p><p>Until Peter nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;All of the\nsuits in the Iron Man category have this potential, colonel.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What would be\nneeded to activate that functionality?&rdquo;</p><p>Another pause.</p><p>Another nod.</p><p>&ldquo;It would\nrequire Mr Stark&rsquo;s presence or a delegated individual of Mr Stark&rsquo;s choosing to\nactivate.&rdquo;</p><p>Rhodes raised his\neyebrows and looked at Pepper questioningly. She shrugged and nodded at Peter,\nwho smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,\nGod,&rdquo; the colonel sighed. &ldquo;One last question then&hellip; Who the heck\nmade that highly intelligent decision?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony,&rdquo;\n&ldquo;Mr Stark,&rdquo; &ldquo;The boss&rdquo; they spoke at the same time.</p><p>The big man moaned.</p><p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s\nonly the Iron Man suits,&rdquo; Pepper said reassuringly. &ldquo;Right now Peter\nis using his own, which is not in the same cate&hellip;&rdquo; she trailed off, her\neyes widening slightly as the sight of Peter&rsquo;s wrists. &ldquo;Category,&rdquo;\nshe swallowed and coughed. &ldquo;Sorry. Peter, could you bring me the water?\nThe pollen makes my throat dry out in seconds.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo;\nhe smiled and nodded at Rhodes. &ldquo;Anything for you, sir?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Something\nthat will make me forget what I&rsquo;ve just heard,&rdquo; the man groaned. &ldquo;But\nin the absence of hard liquor, anything cold will be fine. Thank you,\nParker.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Call me\nPeter, sir. Parker is what my teachers call me and this is supposed to be a\nvacation&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>The moment he\ncrossed the doorway, Rhodes turned towards Pepper and started whispering\nfuriously. Peter sighed and tried not to listen, but, as usual, all his senses\nsharpened immediately. Stress always made his hearing much stronger, after all.</p><p>And he froze.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;formalised!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t.\nI mean, seriously, Rhodey, what would you have done?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.\nNot like I am Tony Stark, am I?&rdquo;</p><p>Pepper sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;I know what\nhe&hellip; what he&hellip;&rdquo; she swallowed, he could <i>hear</i> it, even from across the building. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure if there\nis a procedure for this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Adopting\nsomeone? There is a whole department of Child Protective Services for this,\nPepper, don&rsquo;t be obtuse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But there was\nno procedure for adopting a non-existent seventeen-year-old&hellip;!&rdquo;</p><p>A miniature\nsupernova went off in Peter&rsquo;s brain.</p><p>&ldquo;It would have\nworked before the Decimation - he was at school and Tony was alive and&hellip; and\nnow he is too old for this,&rdquo; he heard Pepper say. &ldquo;And it wasn&rsquo;t even\nabout that, really. I mean, Tony did write a will that puts Peter as the main\nbeneficiary - well, after Morgan and me, but a big chunk of mine is shared with\nPeter, for management purposes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dear God, did\nhe mean to sign off everything to that kid&hellip;!?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you\nnever seen them together?&rdquo; Pepper countered softly. &ldquo;I wish I had had\nthis kind of relationship with my own parents&hellip;! And no, definitely not\neverything, since the company is <i>mine</i>.\nPeter has a large chunk of shares which mainly wait until he turns twenty-five,\nas per Tony&rsquo;s directions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not\nsure I won&rsquo;t be signing the control over to Pepper at the very second I get\nit,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I am completely serious. Code? Nanites? AI? I can\nwork with that. Finances and arguing with the stakeholders&hellip; not that much.\nAnd I&rsquo;m not being coy <i>or</i> cocky,&rdquo;\nhe sniffed and shrugged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m being realistic. And, well, I&rsquo;m not angling\nat Pepper&rsquo;s job. Not in this universe or any other. And I will do whatever is\nneeded to make sure she keeps it, too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Enhanced\nsenses then, kid?&rdquo; the colonel took over the jug of lemonade Peter had\ncarried to the table, leaving Peter with just Pepper&rsquo;s water bottle, which\nPeter proceeded to toss towards her, making the soldier flinch, just a bit.\nPepper fetched it from the air with the tiniest possible smirk.</p><p>&ldquo;Sir, I can\nhear everything in the radius of&hellip; Maybe a mile. More or less. If I&rsquo;m in fight\nmode, it&rsquo;s more, expands with stress. I can tell you how many people there are\nnow around the property and that one of your accompanying drivers is playing\nCandy Crush with his sound on. Also, I am now disturbingly sure that bears do\nin fact shit in the woods, which is not something I was at any point wishing I\ncould confirm. There are seventeen mice and three lizards living in the\nbasement. Sorry, Pepper. There is a nest of crows nearby, and there are several\nsmaller animals I&rsquo;m not familiar with, living in the growth around the lake. I\nknow what your people are gossipping about - mostly celebrities, I think.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pepper, did\nyou know about this&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pepper knows,\nCaptain Wilson knows, doctor Banner knows, director Fury knows&hellip;&rdquo; he\nshrugged.</p><p>It seemed that\nsomething had come to a stop. The whole visit, it was supposed to be about\nsomething, about Rhodey and him and about - somehow - the older man assuming\nsome kind of responsibility for something.</p><p><i>Fuck me if I&rsquo;m going to make it easy for\nhim. I may not be Iron Man, but I am his bloody apprentice and if there is one\nthing I will prove to all of them&hellip; is that I&rsquo;m not going to be an easy\ntarget.</i></p><p>He looked up at\nPepper, who nodded slightly.</p><p><i>OK then. Ladies first.</i></p><p>&ldquo;What exactly\ndo you want from Peter, Rhodey?&rdquo; she asked bluntly, putting her bottle\naway. &ldquo;Because if you want to somehow impose on him - get him to\nparticipate in some military stunt or, even worse, provide materials for\nsomething&hellip;&rdquo; she leaned forward, &ldquo;I will boot you out of this house\nwithout remorse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not <i>exactly</i> that,&rdquo; the colonel\nprevaricated and Peter saw his host roll her eyes at the claim.</p><p><i>Oh,\nboy.
