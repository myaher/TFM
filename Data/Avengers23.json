There were a few things I would have done differently but hey that\u2019s what fanfics are for! So here it is a little fic with a different ending for endgame :) and a certain god of mischief </p><p>OBVIOUS WARNING, IF YOU HAVEN\u2019T SEEN ENDGAME THERE ARE MAJOR SPOILERS SO BE WARNED</p><!-- more --><p>You had a family. You were fighting to keep this family safe. All these years ago when you first joined the Avengers you never imagine all these people would become the most important things in the world, and that you would be ready to die for them. But it hopefully wouldn\u2019t come to that today seeing as you were currently winning. Tony had just snapped his fingers and Thanos and his army were slowly disappearing along with all your nightmares. Or so you thought. </p><p>\u201cMr Stark&hellip; we won&hellip; please&hellip; Tony&hellip;\u201d you heard Peter say before breaking down in tears in Rhodey\u2019s arms. You couldn\u2019t comprehend what was happening until you saw Tony laying on the ground holding Pepper\u2019s hand while she told him he could rest. You ran towards them just as Tony took his last breath. </p><p>\u201cNo no no Tony!\u201d You cried \u201cWhat are you doing?! I can bring him back!\u201d </p><p>\u201c(Y/N) it\u2019s too dangerous, you could die\u201d Rhodey said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care, I have to try\u201d you said putting your hand on Tony\u2019s arch reactor no longer glowing and closing your eyes. </p><p>You opened your eyes and looked around searching for Tony. You never liked coming here but it was necessary, you were the only one with a connection with \u201cthe other side\u201d, the land of the dead. This always made you a freak, you could see the dead and travel to their world. Everyone treated you like an abomination, until you met Tony who took you to the Avengers compound where you discovered the true meaning of family, of love, this was ten years ago. Now here you were on the other side looking for the person who changed your life forever. You were strong but you never brought anyone back but you had to try. For Tony, for family, for love.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N) what are you doing here?\u201d You heard Tony say.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think? I\u2019m here to bring you home\u201d you said with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous, I won\u2019t let you\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking for you permission\u201d </p><p>\u201c(Y/N) I\u2019m serious, I won\u2019t let you die trying to save me. Just tell Pep and Morgan I love them\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou can tell them yourself, now take my hand.\u201d You said holding out your hand, but Tony wouldn\u2019t take it. \u201cDo you really think I\u2019m going to let Morgan grow up fatherless? Tony, you changed my life, now it\u2019s time for me to do something for you, I\u2019m strong, I can do this I promise. Now take my hand\u201d you said firmly.</p><p>Tony looked at you and hesitantly put his hand in yours. After that you both woke up in the normal world and took a deep breath like you had been drowning. You fell to your side into Peter\u2019s arms. </p><p>\u201cTony! You\u2019re alive!\u201d Pepper said in tears before kissing her husband. </p><p>\u201c(Y/N) are you okay??\u201d Peter asked and they all looked at you.</p><p>\u201cI have a massive headache but besides from that I\u2019m peachy\u201d you said chuckling.</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d Tony said looking deep into your eyes, you could see how grateful he felt, because that\u2019s how you felt every single day. </p><p>\u201cThere is no need to thank me, I just did what you would have done\u201d you answered with a smile before being pulled into an embrace with Pepper, Tony, Peter and Rhodey. </p><p>You were all outside Tony\u2019s house, dressed in black, for Natasha and those who didn\u2019t make it out of this terrible fight, looking at the lake. Everyone later went inside to talk about their fondest memories of their friend. You saw Clint and Wanda on the side near the lake and decided it was time to talk to them. </p><p>\u201cI just wish I could tell her we won\u201d Clint said. You put your hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cShe knows. They both do\u201d said Wanda </p><p>\u201cOr you could tell them&hellip; when they come back..\u201d you said hesitantly. The both looked at you wondering if you were playing a horrible prank, but you would never joke about something like this. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been having trouble finding Nat, but that may be a good thing, it can mean she is still alive&hellip; and I have a pretty good idea of where she is and how to get her back\u201d </p><p>\u201cI swear (Y/N) if you\u2019re fucking with me..\u201d Clint said but you interrupted him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, I wouldn\u2019t tell you if I wasn\u2019t sure, I know how to get her back I just need to convince Steve\u201d Clint looked at you with tears forming in the corner of his eyes. You had just given him hope&hellip; and if you were wrong, you would break his heart. But you were sure.</p><p>\u201cAnd while I can\u2019t talk to Vision because he wasn\u2019t technically a human being I do have this\u201d you said showing Wanda a little artifact you had in your back pocket. \u201cIt\u2019s his conscious, all you need to do is make a body for it, and I know a certain princess from Wakanda who would be more than happy to help\u201d you said handing her the artifact. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say&hellip; thanks you!\u201d said Wanda with tears in her eyes</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me, it was Tony, all I did was put two and two together, now, go to talk to Shuri\u201d you answered with a smile.</p><p>You watched her go before looking back towards the lake.</p><p>\u201cSo you really have a plan?\u201d Clint asked</p><p>\u201cI do, and it\u2019s going to work, I promise\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy (Y/N)\u201d said Clint with a laugh \u201cbut God I love you, I\u2019m so happy you\u2019re part of this family of crazies\u201d you both laughed before going in to join the others. </p><p>\u201cSteve it\u2019s gonna work just let me go with you\u201d you said annoyingly</p><p>\u201cAnd what if it doesn\u2019t? What then? Will we ever be forgiven for giving them hope?\u201d He answered raising his voice.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the attitude Rogers\u201d said Bucky \u201cNot a lot of people know about this, only us three and Clint and Wanda and they won\u2019t tell anyone in case we don\u2019t succeed. And are you really telling me you don\u2019t want to try? For once in your life listen to us and stop being so damn stubborn\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanks Buck, couldn\u2019t have said it better myself\u201d you said crossing your hands over your chest \u201cSo are we going to put the stones and get our friend back or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine let\u2019s go\u201d Steve finally said.</p><p>You both mounted the platform a few hours later, all suited up with the suitcase containing the stones safely in hand. Bruce activated the devise and you looked at Buck and Sam smiling and said \u201cSee you in five seconds\u201d </p><p>You and Steve were putting the stones back in the time you took them, deciding to leave the soul one for last, dreading to see if you could get Nat back. You only had the tesseract left and you were now in the military camp in 1970 dressed accordingly to blend in. As you passed the hallways, you saw a door with the name \u201cAgent Carter\u201d, Steve immediately stopped dead in his tracks. You knew what he was thinking and you pulled him into an empty room.</p><p>\u201cI know what you want to do Steve, I overheard you and Bucky, you want to stay here&hellip; to have a life with Peggy\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)&hellip; I.. \u201c</p><p>\u201cHey I\u2019m not trying to stop you I just want you to listen to what I have to say, then you can do what you want\u201d </p><p>\u201cOk I\u2019m listening\u201d Steve said</p><p>\u201cI know Bucky convinced you to do this, and I understand why you want to do it.\u201d You took a deep breath \u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is why&hellip; why you didn\u2019t tell us&hellip; everyone.. me\u201d you could feel tears trying to escape but fought them back \u201cwe would have supported you but you were ready to leave without saying goodbye, you were ready to leave your friends and family without a second glance. And while Bucky might be okay with this, I\u2019m not.\u201d Steve opened his lips to say something but you put your finger up motioning him to stay quiet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not finished. Steve you are one of the most important people in my life, I am who I am today because of you and living without you would be fucking painful but what\u2019s worst is living knowing I meant so little to you that I didn\u2019t even deserve a goodbye\u201d. There was a silence now that you were finished. You wanted to break sown and cry but managed to keep your cool and a single tear rolled down your cheeks. </p><p>Steve brushed his hand on your face to wipe away the tear.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N).. I didn\u2019t tell you because&hellip;. because if I had to say goodbye to you, I would stay, I didn\u2019t tell you because you\u2019re the only person who could convince me to stay, that\u2019s how much you mean to me\u201d he said with tears before hugging you. You both cried in each other\u2019s arms pulling closer until you couldn\u2019t breathe. When you broke apart you were so close you whispered in Steve\u2019s ear \u201cI have an idea&hellip;\u201d </p><p>You were now on Vormir, to get Natasha back&hellip; alone. Steve had stayed behind, with Peggy to live a normal life like he wanted but you weren\u2019t mad, like always you had a plan. You approached Red Scull and said firmly \u201cthe stone for a soul\u201d </p><p>\u201c(Y/L/N) come to bargain? You know it doesn\u2019t work like that\u201d he said with a laugh</p><p>\u201cAnd you know I\u2019m not leaving till I get my friend and correctly if I\u2019m wrong but you need this stone, so just give me Natasha and we\u2019ll be on our way\u201d. </p><p>\u201c(Y/N)?\u201d You heard a familiar voice behind you.</p><p>\u201cNat!\u201d You said running to hug her</p><p>\u201cNow the stone, a deal is a deal\u201d said Red Scull.</p><p>\u201cHere it is\u201d you said tossing the stone.</p><p>Nat and you both appeared on the platform of the machine. Bruce and Sam were both surprised to see Nat, wondering if they were dreaming. Bruce brought Natasha into a tight embrace as tears started running down both their faces.</p><p>\u201cHow did you do that??\u201d Asked Sam</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just talented\u201d you answered with a laugh</p><p>\u201cHey where\u2019s Steve? Did he forget something?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAbout that&hellip; Steve.. decided to stay in 1970 to have a life with Peggy\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can ask him yourself\u201d interrupted Bucky pointing to a bench near the lake with an old man sitting on it. </p><p>Sam went to him and you stayed with Bucky.</p><p>\u201cYou knew\u201d he said calmly </p><p>\u201cDid you think I wouldn\u2019t find out?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d find out, I knew you would talk to him and say exactly the right thing, not before giving a proper tell off\u201d Bucky said with a laugh</p><p>\u201cOh, that I did, made him cry even\u201d you answered laughing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna miss him\u201d said Bucky</p><p>\u201cWho said he\u2019s leaving?\u201d You said with a smirk</p><p>\u201cWell he\u2019s old.. wait what did you do?\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say I have more than one trick up my sleeve and that our beloved Captain is going to stick around for a while\u201d</p><p>Sam approached you both holding the captain america shield in his hand. Bucky left to go talk to Steve, unable to understand what you had done. You watched him go a sneaky smile on your face.</p><p>\u201cSo how old are you now?\u201d Asked Bucky with a grin</p><p>\u201cOlder than you, punk\u201d answered Steve with a smile</p><p>\u201cSo&hellip; how was it?

I mean how great a life can be without a best friend to share it with?\u201d Steve looked at Bucky who was sitting next to him and put his hand on top of his. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna miss you old man\u201d Bucky said trying to keep the tears in the corner of his eyes. </p><p>\u201cOld man yourself.

You were fighting to keep this family safe. All these years ago when you first joined the Avengers you never imagine all these people would become the most important things in the world, and that you would be ready to die for them. But it hopefully wouldn\u2019t come to that today seeing as you were currently winning. Tony had just snapped his fingers and Thanos and his army were slowly disappearing along with all your nightmares. Or so you thought. </p><p>\u201cMr Stark\u2026 we won\u2026 please\u2026 Tony\u2026\u201d you heard Peter say before breaking down in tears in Rhodey\u2019s arms. You couldn\u2019t comprehend what was happening until you saw Tony laying on the ground holding Pepper\u2019s hand while she told him he could rest. You ran towards them just as Tony took his last breath. </p><p>\u201cNo no no Tony!\u201d You cried \u201cWhat are you doing?! I can bring him back!\u201d </p><p>\u201c(Y/N) it\u2019s too dangerous, you could die\u201d Rhodey said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care, I have to try\u201d you said putting your hand on Tony\u2019s arch reactor no longer glowing and closing your eyes. </p><p>You opened your eyes and looked around searching for Tony. You never liked coming here but it was necessary, you were the only one with a connection with \u201cthe other side\u201d, the land of the dead. This always made you a freak, you could see the dead and travel to their world. Everyone treated you like an abomination, until you met Tony who took you to the Avengers compound where you discovered the true meaning of family, of love, this was ten years ago. Now here you were on the other side looking for the person who changed your life forever. You were strong but you never brought anyone back but you had to try. For Tony, for family, for love.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N) what are you doing here?\u201d You heard Tony say.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think? I\u2019m here to bring you home\u201d you said with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous, I won\u2019t let you\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking for you permission\u201d </p><p>\u201c(Y/N) I\u2019m serious, I won\u2019t let you die trying to save me. Just tell Pep and Morgan I love them\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou can tell them yourself, now take my hand.\u201d You said holding out your hand, but Tony wouldn\u2019t take it. \u201cDo you really think I\u2019m going to let Morgan grow up fatherless? Tony, you changed my life, now it\u2019s time for me to do something for you, I\u2019m strong, I can do this I promise. Now take my hand\u201d you said firmly.</p><p>Tony looked at you and hesitantly put his hand in yours. After that you both woke up in the normal world and took a deep breath like you had been drowning. You fell to your side into Peter\u2019s arms. </p><p>\u201cTony! You\u2019re alive!\u201d Pepper said in tears before kissing her husband. </p><p>\u201c(Y/N) are you okay??\u201d Peter asked and they all looked at you.</p><p>\u201cI have a massive headache but besides from that I\u2019m peachy\u201d you said chuckling.</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d Tony said looking deep into your eyes, you could see how grateful he felt, because that\u2019s how you felt every single day. </p><p>\u201cThere is no need to thank me, I just did what you would have done\u201d you answered with a smile before being pulled into an embrace with Pepper, Tony, Peter and Rhodey. </p><p>You were all outside Tony\u2019s house, dressed in black, for Natasha and those who didn\u2019t make it out of this terrible fight, looking at the lake. Everyone later went inside to talk about their fondest memories of their friend. You saw Clint and Wanda on the side near the lake and decided it was time to talk to them. </p><p>\u201cI just wish I could tell her we won\u201d Clint said. You put your hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cShe knows. They both do\u201d said Wanda </p><p>\u201cOr you could tell them\u2026 when they come back..\u201d you said hesitantly. The both looked at you wondering if you were playing a horrible prank, but you would never joke about something like this. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been having trouble finding Nat, but that may be a good thing, it can mean she is still alive\u2026 and I have a pretty good idea of where she is and how to get her back\u201d </p><p>\u201cI swear (Y/N) if you\u2019re fucking with me..\u201d Clint said but you interrupted him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, I wouldn\u2019t tell you if I wasn\u2019t sure, I know how to get her back I just need to convince Steve\u201d Clint looked at you with tears forming in the corner of his eyes. You had just given him hope\u2026 and if you were wrong, you would break his heart. But you were sure.</p><p>\u201cAnd while I can\u2019t talk to Vision because he wasn\u2019t technically a human being I do have this\u201d you said showing Wanda a little artifact you had in your back pocket. \u201cIt\u2019s his conscious, all you need to do is make a body for it, and I know a certain princess from Wakanda who would be more than happy to help\u201d you said handing her the artifact. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say\u2026 thanks you!\u201d said Wanda with tears in her eyes</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me, it was Tony, all I did was put two and two together, now, go to talk to Shuri\u201d you answered with a smile.</p><p>You watched her go before looking back towards the lake.</p><p>\u201cSo you really have a plan?\u201d Clint asked</p><p>\u201cI do, and it\u2019s going to work, I promise\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy (Y/N)\u201d said Clint with a laugh \u201cbut God I love you, I\u2019m so happy you\u2019re part of this family of crazies\u201d you both laughed before going in to join the others. </p><p>\u201cSteve it\u2019s gonna work just let me go with you\u201d you said annoyingly</p><p>\u201cAnd what if it doesn\u2019t? What then? Will we ever be forgiven for giving them hope?\u201d He answered raising his voice.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the attitude Rogers\u201d said Bucky \u201cNot a lot of people know about this, only us three and Clint and Wanda and they won\u2019t tell anyone in case we don\u2019t succeed. And are you really telling me you don\u2019t want to try? For once in your life listen to us and stop being so damn stubborn\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanks Buck, couldn\u2019t have said it better myself\u201d you said crossing your hands over your chest \u201cSo are we going to put the stones and get our friend back or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine let\u2019s go\u201d Steve finally said.</p><p>You both mounted the platform a few hours later, all suited up with the suitcase containing the stones safely in hand. Bruce activated the devise and you looked at Buck and Sam smiling and said \u201cSee you in five seconds\u201d </p><p>You and Steve were putting the stones back in the time you took them, deciding to leave the soul one for last, dreading to see if you could get Nat back. You only had the tesseract left and you were now in the military camp in 1970 dressed accordingly to blend in. As you passed the hallways, you saw a door with the name \u201cAgent Carter\u201d, Steve immediately stopped dead in his tracks. You knew what he was thinking and you pulled him into an empty room.</p><p>\u201cI know what you want to do Steve, I overheard you and Bucky, you want to stay here\u2026 to have a life with Peggy\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)\u2026 I.. \u201c</p><p>\u201cHey I\u2019m not trying to stop you I just want you to listen to what I have to say, then you can do what you want\u201d </p><p>\u201cOk I\u2019m listening\u201d Steve said</p><p>\u201cI know Bucky convinced you to do this, and I understand why you want to do it.\u201d You took a deep breath \u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is why\u2026 why you didn\u2019t tell us\u2026 everyone.. me\u201d you could feel tears trying to escape but fought them back \u201cwe would have supported you but you were ready to leave without saying goodbye, you were ready to leave your friends and family without a second glance. And while Bucky might be okay with this, I\u2019m not.\u201d Steve opened his lips to say something but you put your finger up motioning him to stay quiet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not finished. Steve you are one of the most important people in my life, I am who I am today because of you and living without you would be fucking painful but what\u2019s worst is living knowing I meant so little to you that I didn\u2019t even deserve a goodbye\u201d. There was a silence now that you were finished. You wanted to break sown and cry but managed to keep your cool and a single tear rolled down your cheeks. </p><p>Steve brushed his hand on your face to wipe away the tear.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N).. I didn\u2019t tell you because\u2026. because if I had to say goodbye to you, I would stay, I didn\u2019t tell you because you\u2019re the only person who could convince me to stay, that\u2019s how much you mean to me\u201d he said with tears before hugging you. You both cried in each other\u2019s arms pulling closer until you couldn\u2019t breathe. When you broke apart you were so close you whispered in Steve\u2019s ear \u201cI have an idea\u2026\u201d </p><p>You were now on Vormir, to get Natasha back\u2026 alone. Steve had stayed behind, with Peggy to live a normal life like he wanted but you weren\u2019t mad, like always you had a plan. You approached Red Scull and said firmly \u201cthe stone for a soul\u201d </p><p>\u201c(Y/L/N) come to bargain? You know it doesn\u2019t work like that\u201d he said with a laugh</p><p>\u201cAnd you know I\u2019m not leaving till I get my friend and correctly if I\u2019m wrong but you need this stone, so just give me Natasha and we\u2019ll be on our way\u201d. </p><p>\u201c(Y/N)?\u201d You heard a familiar voice behind you.</p><p>\u201cNat!\u201d You said running to hug her</p><p>\u201cNow the stone, a deal is a deal\u201d said Red Scull.</p><p>\u201cHere it is\u201d you said tossing the stone.</p><p>Nat and you both appeared on the platform of the machine. Bruce and Sam were both surprised to see Nat, wondering if they were dreaming. Bruce brought Natasha into a tight embrace as tears started running down both their faces.</p><p>\u201cHow did you do that??\u201d Asked Sam</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just talented\u201d you answered with a laugh</p><p>\u201cHey where\u2019s Steve? Did he forget something?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAbout that\u2026 Steve.. decided to stay in 1970 to have a life with Peggy\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can ask him yourself\u201d interrupted Bucky pointing to a bench near the lake with an old man sitting on it. </p><p>Sam went to him and you stayed with Bucky.</p><p>\u201cYou knew\u201d he said calmly </p><p>\u201cDid you think I wouldn\u2019t find out?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d find out, I knew you would talk to him and say exactly the right thing, not before giving a proper tell off\u201d Bucky said with a laugh</p><p>\u201cOh, that I did, made him cry even\u201d you answered laughing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna miss him\u201d said Bucky</p><p>\u201cWho said he\u2019s leaving?\u201d You said with a smirk</p><p>\u201cWell he\u2019s old.. wait what did you do?\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say I have more than one trick up my sleeve and that our beloved Captain is going to stick around for a while\u201d</p><p>Sam approached you both holding the captain america shield in his hand. Bucky left to go talk to Steve, unable to understand what you had done. You watched him go a sneaky smile on your face.</p><p>\u201cSo how old are you now?\u201d Asked Bucky with a grin</p><p>\u201cOlder than you, punk\u201d answered Steve with a smile</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026 how was it? To have a life I mean\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt was simple, repetitive, no monsters, no HYDRA, you could almost say it became boring\u201d Steve and Bucky chuckled </p><p>\u201cWas it what you always wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was, but it also wasn\u2019t. I mean how great a life can be without a best friend to share it with?\u201d Steve looked at Bucky who was sitting next to him and put his hand on top of his. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna miss you old man\u201d Bucky said trying to keep the tears in the corner of his eyes. </p><p>\u201cOld man yourself. And I would miss you too, if I was leaving but since I\u2019m not, you\u2019re stuck with me\u201d Steve said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, aren\u2019t you dying soon? Wait does this have something to do with why (Y/N) was so happy?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt does, she came up with it actually, after yelling at me for while\u201d they both chuckled \u201cwhen we were trying out the suits we did something to Scott, so (Y/N) said if I wanted we could do the same to me when I was old\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth did you do to Scott?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait and see\u201d answered Steve before getting up.

But it hopefully wouldn\u2019t come to that today seeing as you were currently winning. Tony had just snapped his fingers and Thanos and his army were slowly disappearing along with all your nightmares. Or so you thought. </p><p>\u201cMr Stark\u2026 we won\u2026 please\u2026 Tony\u2026\u201d you heard Peter say before breaking down in tears in Rhodey\u2019s arms. You couldn\u2019t comprehend what was happening until you saw Tony laying on the ground holding Pepper\u2019s hand while she told him he could rest. You ran towards them just as Tony took his last breath. </p><p>\u201cNo no no Tony!\u201d You cried \u201cWhat are you doing?! I can bring him back!\u201d </p><p>\u201c(Y/N) it\u2019s too dangerous, you could die\u201d Rhodey said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care, I have to try\u201d you said putting your hand on Tony\u2019s arch reactor no longer glowing and closing your eyes. </p><p>You opened your eyes and looked around searching for Tony. You never liked coming here but it was necessary, you were the only one with a connection with \u201cthe other side\u201d, the land of the dead. This always made you a freak, you could see the dead and travel to their world. Everyone treated you like an abomination, until you met Tony who took you to the Avengers compound where you discovered the true meaning of family, of love, this was ten years ago. Now here you were on the other side looking for the person who changed your life forever. You were strong but you never brought anyone back but you had to try. For Tony, for family, for love.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N) what are you doing here?\u201d You heard Tony say.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think? I\u2019m here to bring you home\u201d you said with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous, I won\u2019t let you\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking for you permission\u201d </p><p>\u201c(Y/N) I\u2019m serious, I won\u2019t let you die trying to save me. Just tell Pep and Morgan I love them\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou can tell them yourself, now take my hand.\u201d You said holding out your hand, but Tony wouldn\u2019t take it. \u201cDo you really think I\u2019m going to let Morgan grow up fatherless? Tony, you changed my life, now it\u2019s time for me to do something for you, I\u2019m strong, I can do this I promise. Now take my hand\u201d you said firmly.</p><p>Tony looked at you and hesitantly put his hand in yours. After that you both woke up in the normal world and took a deep breath like you had been drowning. You fell to your side into Peter\u2019s arms. </p><p>\u201cTony! You\u2019re alive!\u201d Pepper said in tears before kissing her husband. </p><p>\u201c(Y/N) are you okay??\u201d Peter asked and they all looked at you.</p><p>\u201cI have a massive headache but besides from that I\u2019m peachy\u201d you said chuckling.</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d Tony said looking deep into your eyes, you could see how grateful he felt, because that\u2019s how you felt every single day. </p><p>\u201cThere is no need to thank me, I just did what you would have done\u201d you answered with a smile before being pulled into an embrace with Pepper, Tony, Peter and Rhodey. </p><p>You were all outside Tony\u2019s house, dressed in black, for Natasha and those who didn\u2019t make it out of this terrible fight, looking at the lake. Everyone later went inside to talk about their fondest memories of their friend. You saw Clint and Wanda on the side near the lake and decided it was time to talk to them. </p><p>\u201cI just wish I could tell her we won\u201d Clint said. You put your hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cShe knows. They both do\u201d said Wanda </p><p>\u201cOr you could tell them\u2026 when they come back..\u201d you said hesitantly. The both looked at you wondering if you were playing a horrible prank, but you would never joke about something like this. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been having trouble finding Nat, but that may be a good thing, it can mean she is still alive\u2026 and I have a pretty good idea of where she is and how to get her back\u201d </p><p>\u201cI swear (Y/N) if you\u2019re fucking with me..\u201d Clint said but you interrupted him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, I wouldn\u2019t tell you if I wasn\u2019t sure, I know how to get her back I just need to convince Steve\u201d Clint looked at you with tears forming in the corner of his eyes. You had just given him hope\u2026 and if you were wrong, you would break his heart. But you were sure.</p><p>\u201cAnd while I can\u2019t talk to Vision because he wasn\u2019t technically a human being I do have this\u201d you said showing Wanda a little artifact you had in your back pocket. \u201cIt\u2019s his conscious, all you need to do is make a body for it, and I know a certain princess from Wakanda who would be more than happy to help\u201d you said handing her the artifact. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say\u2026 thanks you!\u201d said Wanda with tears in her eyes</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me, it was Tony, all I did was put two and two together, now, go to talk to Shuri\u201d you answered with a smile.</p><p>You watched her go before looking back towards the lake.</p><p>\u201cSo you really have a plan?\u201d Clint asked</p><p>\u201cI do, and it\u2019s going to work, I promise\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy (Y/N)\u201d said Clint with a laugh \u201cbut God I love you, I\u2019m so happy you\u2019re part of this family of crazies\u201d you both laughed before going in to join the others. </p><p>\u201cSteve it\u2019s gonna work just let me go with you\u201d you said annoyingly</p><p>\u201cAnd what if it doesn\u2019t? What then? Will we ever be forgiven for giving them hope?\u201d He answered raising his voice.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the attitude Rogers\u201d said Bucky \u201cNot a lot of people know about this, only us three and Clint and Wanda and they won\u2019t tell anyone in case we don\u2019t succeed. And are you really telling me you don\u2019t want to try? For once in your life listen to us and stop being so damn stubborn\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanks Buck, couldn\u2019t have said it better myself\u201d you said crossing your hands over your chest \u201cSo are we going to put the stones and get our friend back or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine let\u2019s go\u201d Steve finally said.</p><p>You both mounted the platform a few hours later, all suited up with the suitcase containing the stones safely in hand. Bruce activated the devise and you looked at Buck and Sam smiling and said \u201cSee you in five seconds\u201d </p><p>You and Steve were putting the stones back in the time you took them, deciding to leave the soul one for last, dreading to see if you could get Nat back. You only had the tesseract left and you were now in the military camp in 1970 dressed accordingly to blend in. As you passed the hallways, you saw a door with the name \u201cAgent Carter\u201d, Steve immediately stopped dead in his tracks. You knew what he was thinking and you pulled him into an empty room.</p><p>\u201cI know what you want to do Steve, I overheard you and Bucky, you want to stay here\u2026 to have a life with Peggy\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)\u2026 I.. \u201c</p><p>\u201cHey I\u2019m not trying to stop you I just want you to listen to what I have to say, then you can do what you want\u201d </p><p>\u201cOk I\u2019m listening\u201d Steve said</p><p>\u201cI know Bucky convinced you to do this, and I understand why you want to do it.\u201d You took a deep breath \u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is why\u2026 why you didn\u2019t tell us\u2026 everyone.. me\u201d you could feel tears trying to escape but fought them back \u201cwe would have supported you but you were ready to leave without saying goodbye, you were ready to leave your friends and family without a second glance. And while Bucky might be okay with this, I\u2019m not.\u201d Steve opened his lips to say something but you put your finger up motioning him to stay quiet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not finished. Steve you are one of the most important people in my life, I am who I am today because of you and living without you would be fucking painful but what\u2019s worst is living knowing I meant so little to you that I didn\u2019t even deserve a goodbye\u201d. There was a silence now that you were finished. You wanted to break sown and cry but managed to keep your cool and a single tear rolled down your cheeks. </p><p>Steve brushed his hand on your face to wipe away the tear.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N).. I didn\u2019t tell you because\u2026. because if I had to say goodbye to you, I would stay, I didn\u2019t tell you because you\u2019re the only person who could convince me to stay, that\u2019s how much you mean to me\u201d he said with tears before hugging you. You both cried in each other\u2019s arms pulling closer until you couldn\u2019t breathe. When you broke apart you were so close you whispered in Steve\u2019s ear \u201cI have an idea\u2026\u201d </p><p>You were now on Vormir, to get Natasha back\u2026 alone. Steve had stayed behind, with Peggy to live a normal life like he wanted but you weren\u2019t mad, like always you had a plan. You approached Red Scull and said firmly \u201cthe stone for a soul\u201d </p><p>\u201c(Y/L/N) come to bargain? You know it doesn\u2019t work like that\u201d he said with a laugh</p><p>\u201cAnd you know I\u2019m not leaving till I get my friend and correctly if I\u2019m wrong but you need this stone, so just give me Natasha and we\u2019ll be on our way\u201d. </p><p>\u201c(Y/N)?\u201d You heard a familiar voice behind you.</p><p>\u201cNat!\u201d You said running to hug her</p><p>\u201cNow the stone, a deal is a deal\u201d said Red Scull.</p><p>\u201cHere it is\u201d you said tossing the stone.</p><p>Nat and you both appeared on the platform of the machine. Bruce and Sam were both surprised to see Nat, wondering if they were dreaming. Bruce brought Natasha into a tight embrace as tears started running down both their faces.</p><p>\u201cHow did you do that??\u201d Asked Sam</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just talented\u201d you answered with a laugh</p><p>\u201cHey where\u2019s Steve? Did he forget something?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAbout that\u2026 Steve.. decided to stay in 1970 to have a life with Peggy\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can ask him yourself\u201d interrupted Bucky pointing to a bench near the lake with an old man sitting on it. </p><p>Sam went to him and you stayed with Bucky.</p><p>\u201cYou knew\u201d he said calmly </p><p>\u201cDid you think I wouldn\u2019t find out?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d find out, I knew you would talk to him and say exactly the right thing, not before giving a proper tell off\u201d Bucky said with a laugh</p><p>\u201cOh, that I did, made him cry even\u201d you answered laughing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna miss him\u201d said Bucky</p><p>\u201cWho said he\u2019s leaving?\u201d You said with a smirk</p><p>\u201cWell he\u2019s old.. wait what did you do?\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say I have more than one trick up my sleeve and that our beloved Captain is going to stick around for a while\u201d</p><p>Sam approached you both holding the captain america shield in his hand. Bucky left to go talk to Steve, unable to understand what you had done. You watched him go a sneaky smile on your face.</p><p>\u201cSo how old are you now?\u201d Asked Bucky with a grin</p><p>\u201cOlder than you, punk\u201d answered Steve with a smile</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026 how was it? To have a life I mean\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt was simple, repetitive, no monsters, no HYDRA, you could almost say it became boring\u201d Steve and Bucky chuckled </p><p>\u201cWas it what you always wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was, but it also wasn\u2019t. I mean how great a life can be without a best friend to share it with?\u201d Steve looked at Bucky who was sitting next to him and put his hand on top of his. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna miss you old man\u201d Bucky said trying to keep the tears in the corner of his eyes. </p><p>\u201cOld man yourself. And I would miss you too, if I was leaving but since I\u2019m not, you\u2019re stuck with me\u201d Steve said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, aren\u2019t you dying soon? Wait does this have something to do with why (Y/N) was so happy?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt does, she came up with it actually, after yelling at me for while\u201d they both chuckled \u201cwhen we were trying out the suits we did something to Scott, so (Y/N) said if I wanted we could do the same to me when I was old\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth did you do to Scott?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait and see\u201d answered Steve before getting up. Bucky took his arm and helped him reach the machine where (Y/N) was standing with Sam. </p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d You asked.</p><p>\u201cReady\u201d said old Steve as he activated the suit. </p><p>Whoosh. A few seconds later, he was back, but he wasn\u2019t the same, he was the Steve you always knew, the \u2018young\u2019 Steve he was only 10 minutes ago. </p><p>\u201cThis is really confusing, did you just have an entire life, became old and then young again in the space of a few minutes?\u201d Asked Sam.</p><p>\u201cTime machine, baby!\u201d You answered. You all laughed and hugged each other, this sure had been a long and crazy day for everyone. </p><p>All the avengers sat in the newly rebuilt compound, you were celebrating your win against Thanos and the return of all your loved ones. As you celebrated you noticed Thor standing in a corner drinking beer by himself, and you remembered, Loki was still dead. You had forgotten about the god of mischief with everything that had happened but he always did have a special place in your heart and you wanted to save him last to make sure it was possible, save the best for last. You approached Thor and gave him a smile before sitting next to him on a bar stool. </p><p>\u201cHello lady (Y/N), enjoying the celebrations?\u201d He asked</p><p>\u201cI am, but I can\u2019t help but feel you\u2019re not enjoying it yourself, maybe someone\u2019s missing, I was sure we had invited everyone though. Hmmm I wonder who it could be..\u201d you said trying to hide the grin forming on your face.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this brother? Drinking alone instead of enjoying the party? That doesn\u2019t sound like the Thor I know\u201d said a familiar voice behind you.</p><p>\u201cLoki!!\u201d Said Thor before running to catch his brother in a tight embrace</p><p>\u201cNow this is the Thor I remember\u201d whispered Loki who was being held so tight he could barely breathe. \u201cAlthough, you have let yourself go a little haven\u2019t you?\u201d He asked with a grin when they parted looking at his brother up and down.</p><p>\u201cOnly a little, but I have discovered the most amazing midgardian artifacts, I mist show you but before let me tell you about Mother, I saw her\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou did??\u201d Asked Loki eyes full of surprise.</p><p>You felt this was your cue to leave, so you left the too brothers to talk in peace and rejoined the party. You looked around and saw everyone was happy, no one was missing, as you looked around tears of happiness started forming in your eyes, and to say you might not have had this if Scott hasn\u2019t escaped the quantum realm. Maybe entire life could change in a single second, like Tony deciding to go into the building where he found you and take you home, or Steve murmuring \u2018Bucky\u2019 to the winter soldier and thus bringing back his best friend, or simply a rat playing on the console of an abandoned car and pushing just the right button to reunite a family. </p><p><br></p><p>Feedback is always appreciated!!</p></p>",

You know it doesn&rsquo;t work like that&rdquo; he said with a laugh</p><p>&ldquo;And you know I&rsquo;m not leaving till I get my friend and correctly if I&rsquo;m wrong but you need this stone, so just give me Natasha and we&rsquo;ll be on our way&rdquo;. </p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N)?&rdquo; You heard a familiar voice behind you.</p><p>&ldquo;Nat!&rdquo; You said running to hug her</p><p>&ldquo;Now the stone, a deal is a deal&rdquo; said Red Scull.</p><p>&ldquo;Here it is&rdquo; you said tossing the stone.</p><p>Nat and you both appeared on the platform of the machine. Bruce and Sam were both surprised to see Nat, wondering if they were dreaming. Bruce brought Natasha into a tight embrace as tears started running down both their faces.</p><p>&ldquo;How did you do that??&rdquo; Asked Sam</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just talented&rdquo; you answered with a laugh</p><p>&ldquo;Hey where&rsquo;s Steve? Did he forget something?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;About that&hellip; Steve.. decided to stay in 1970 to have a life with Peggy&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can ask him yourself&rdquo; interrupted Bucky pointing to a bench near the lake with an old man sitting on it. </p><p>Sam went to him and you stayed with Bucky.</p><p>&ldquo;You knew&rdquo; he said calmly </p><p>&ldquo;Did you think I wouldn&rsquo;t find out?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d find out, I knew you would talk to him and say exactly the right thing, not before giving a proper tell off&rdquo; Bucky said with a laugh</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, that I did, made him cry even&rdquo; you answered laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna miss him&rdquo; said Bucky</p><p>&ldquo;Who said he&rsquo;s leaving?&rdquo; You said with a smirk</p><p>&ldquo;Well he&rsquo;s old.. wait what did you do?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just say I have more than one trick up my sleeve and that our beloved Captain is going to stick around for a while&rdquo;</p><p>Sam approached you both holding the captain america shield in his hand. Bucky left to go talk to Steve, unable to understand what you had done. You watched him go a sneaky smile on your face.</p><p>&ldquo;So how old are you now?&rdquo; Asked Bucky with a grin</p><p>&ldquo;Older than you, punk&rdquo; answered Steve with a smile</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip; how was it? To have a life I mean&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It was simple, repetitive, no monsters, no HYDRA, you could almost say it became boring&rdquo; Steve and Bucky chuckled </p><p>&ldquo;Was it what you always wanted?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was, but it also wasn&rsquo;t. I mean how great a life can be without a best friend to share it with?&rdquo; Steve looked at Bucky who was sitting next to him and put his hand on top of his. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna miss you old man&rdquo; Bucky said trying to keep the tears in the corner of his eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Old man yourself. And I would miss you too, if I was leaving but since I&rsquo;m not, you&rsquo;re stuck with me&rdquo; Steve said with a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean, aren&rsquo;t you dying soon? Wait does this have something to do with why (Y/N) was so happy?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It does, she came up with it actually, after yelling at me for while&rdquo; they both chuckled &ldquo;when we were trying out the suits we did something to Scott, so (Y/N) said if I wanted we could do the same to me when I was old&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What on earth did you do to Scott?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait and see&rdquo; answered Steve before getting up. Bucky took his arm and helped him reach the machine where (Y/N) was standing with Sam. </p><p>&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; You asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Ready&rdquo; said old Steve as he activated the suit. </p><p>Whoosh. A few seconds later, he was back, but he wasn&rsquo;t the same, he was the Steve you always knew, the &lsquo;young&rsquo; Steve he was only 10 minutes ago. </p><p>&ldquo;This is really confusing, did you just have an entire life, became old and then young again in the space of a few minutes?&rdquo; Asked Sam.</p><p>&ldquo;Time machine, baby!&rdquo; You answered. You all laughed and hugged each other, this sure had been a long and crazy day for everyone. </p><p>All the avengers sat in the newly rebuilt compound, you were celebrating your win against Thanos and the return of all your loved ones. As you celebrated you noticed Thor standing in a corner drinking beer by himself, and you remembered, Loki was still dead. You had forgotten about the god of mischief with everything that had happened but he always did have a special place in your heart and you wanted to save him last to make sure it was possible, save the best for last. You approached Thor and gave him a smile before sitting next to him on a bar stool. </p><p>&ldquo;Hello lady (Y/N), enjoying the celebrations?&rdquo; He asked</p><p>&ldquo;I am, but I can&rsquo;t help but feel you&rsquo;re not enjoying it yourself, maybe someone&rsquo;s missing, I was sure we had invited everyone though. Hmmm I wonder who it could be..&rdquo; you said trying to hide the grin forming on your face.</p><p>&ldquo;What is this brother? Drinking alone instead of enjoying the party? That doesn&rsquo;t sound like the Thor I know&rdquo; said a familiar voice behind you.</p><p>&ldquo;Loki!!&rdquo; Said Thor before running to catch his brother in a tight embrace</p><p>&ldquo;Now this is the Thor I remember&rdquo; whispered Loki who was being held so tight he could barely breathe. &ldquo;Although, you have let yourself go a little haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; He asked with a grin when they parted looking at his brother up and down.</p><p>&ldquo;Only a little, but I have discovered the most amazing midgardian artifacts, I mist show you but before let me tell you about Mother, I saw her&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You did??&rdquo; Asked Loki eyes full of surprise.</p><p>You felt this was your cue to leave, so you left the too brothers to talk in peace and rejoined the party. You looked around and saw everyone was happy, no one was missing, as you looked around tears of happiness started forming in your eyes, and to say you might not have had this if Scott hasn&rsquo;t escaped the quantum realm. Maybe entire life could change in a single second, like Tony deciding to go into the building where he found you and take you home, or Steve murmuring &lsquo;Bucky&rsquo; to the winter soldier and thus bringing back his best friend, or simply a rat playing on the console of an abandoned car and pushing just the right button to reunite a family. </p><p><br /></p><p>Feedback is always appreciated!!</p></p>",
