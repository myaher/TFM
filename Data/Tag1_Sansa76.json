I was originally hopeful about Sansa&rsquo;s S5 storyline because S4 was so strong and because I knew where Jeyne&rsquo;s story was headed in the books. I didn&rsquo;t expect Littlefinger to bounce so quickly and let Sansa actually marry Ramsay but I did see it as a chance for Sansa to win back Winterfell, have some romanticish moment with Jon coming to rescue her, and for a truly epic take on the Northern Conspiracy.</p><p>And that last part? About the Northern Conspiracy? That&rsquo;s why I have no hope that Jonsa is ever going to be on even though I was right about a lot of things and so were many other people. The show&rsquo;s Northern Conspiracy was one old woman. And I kept hoping that wasn&rsquo;t the case, that the Umbers were double-crossing Ramsay, that there really was a plan instead of Dumb and Dumber putting up spectacle after spectacle without any coherent plan or guiding purpose. </p><p>But nope. Just like they bungled Dorne and their conspiracy, just like the entire mess that was the Stark Kids vs. Littlefinger in S7, Dumb and Dumber really had the Umbers betray the Starks like that because they&rsquo;re all flash and no substance. They can&rsquo;t do conspiracies, they can&rsquo;t do intrigue, they can&rsquo;t do subtle?</p><p>Jon shows no sign of being in love with Daenerys? Maybe he feels awkward because he and EC allegedly had a fling back in the start of the show. (This is not a pro-Kimilia account so don&rsquo;t start.) Or maybe KH is just a weak actor and the only reason Jon/Ygritte worked was because of RL&rsquo;s charisma and the chemistry between the two actors. Take your pick. Speaking of Ygritte, I&rsquo;m pretty sure the idea is that like with Ygritte, Jon has his own motives with Dany but eventually falls in love. The songs they picked for their Spotify playlist? &ldquo;Sister&rdquo; is probably Jaime/Cersei and &ldquo;Girl From the North Country&rdquo; could be Jon/Ygritte, Gendry/Arya, or most likely Sam/Gilly as I do expect them to get married and probably be the only wedding next season. The original triangle of Jon/Arya/Tyrion? It&rsquo;s probably been replaced with Jon/Dany/Tyrion and that plays into Frikidoctor&rsquo;s leaks regarding Tyrion&rsquo;s fate. The Ashford Tourney Theory? Applies more to the books and is already a stretch as it includes the attempted betrothal to Willas/Loras but doesn&rsquo;t mention the similar attempted betrothal to Robert/Robyn Arryn and it ignores her marriage to Ramsay Bolton in the show. Liam Cunningham liked a Jonsa vid? I&rsquo;m old enough to remember when Lena Headey posted a picture on her Instagram of a heart made out of rocks with the title &ldquo;my stone heart&rdquo;. This was right before the S4 episode called &ldquo;Oathkeeper&rdquo; a clear and obvious reference to Brienne who had made an oath to whom? That&rsquo;s right. Even when Lady Stoneheart did not appear, we kept hope all through the season.

I didn\u2019t expect Littlefinger to bounce so quickly and let Sansa actually marry Ramsay but I did see it as a chance for Sansa to win back Winterfell, have some romanticish moment with Jon coming to rescue her, and for a truly epic take on the Northern Conspiracy.</p><p>And that last part? About the Northern Conspiracy? That\u2019s why I have no hope that Jonsa is ever going to be on even though I was right about a lot of things and so were many other people. The show\u2019s Northern Conspiracy was one old woman.

Just like they bungled Dorne and their conspiracy, just like the entire mess that was the Stark Kids vs. Littlefinger in S7, Dumb and Dumber really had the Umbers betray the Starks like that because they\u2019re all flash and no substance.

Maybe he feels awkward because he and EC allegedly had a fling back in the start of the show. (This is not a pro-Kimilia account so don\u2019t start.) Or maybe KH is just a weak actor and the only reason Jon/Ygritte worked was because of RL\u2019s charisma and the chemistry between the two actors. Take your pick. Speaking of Ygritte, I\u2019m pretty sure the idea is that like with Ygritte, Jon has his own motives with Dany but eventually falls in love. The songs they picked for their Spotify playlist? \u201cSister\u201d is probably Jaime/Cersei and \u201cGirl From the North Country\u201d could be Jon/Ygritte, Gendry/Arya, or most likely Sam/Gilly as I do expect them to get married and probably be the only wedding next season. The original triangle of Jon/Arya/Tyrion? It\u2019s probably been replaced with Jon/Dany/Tyrion and that plays into Frikidoctor\u2019s leaks regarding Tyrion\u2019s fate. The Ashford Tourney Theory? Applies more to the books and is already a stretch as it includes the attempted betrothal to Willas/Loras but doesn\u2019t mention the similar attempted betrothal to Robert/Robyn Arryn and it ignores her marriage to Ramsay Bolton in the show.
