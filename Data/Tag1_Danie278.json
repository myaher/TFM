Between the trial and working with Dan, she was really running herself thin. The day she testified she had gone home and cried herself to sleep. She truly didn&rsquo;t think either Dan or Phil deserved any of this. She struggled with guilt as Phil situation was partially her fault. If she hadn\u2019t of alerted the police then Phil wouldn\u2019t be on trial but if she hadn\u2019t said anything then she would have been in violation of the Hippocratic oath she had taken when she had become a doctor. Dan didn\u2019t help matters any he spent most of his day\u2019s sulking and crying which made her feel even more guilty for the whole thing.</p><p>Lela had been working with Dan every moment she could to progress his therapy in hope\u2019s he might feel comfortable to regress back to his normal state. They had made a little progress but not a ton.</p><p>The other doctors frowned upon her trying to switch group therapy time for personal therapy so she fit it whenever she could. Of course, that was probably the best course of action as much as she hoped Dan would get better soon she didn\u2019t want to push him too hard. She had read several studies on how pushing a regressed person too much could lead to permanent side effects.</p><p>But the one thing she had tried was hypnosis. It was a controversial thing in her field but she felt the benefits would outweigh the cons. Dan seemed to be responding well to them, not much had been accomplished but she had been able to learn more of what had happened well Dan had been held captive. The things she heard where heartbreaking and in fact made her feel sick but she knew that this is what Dan needed to get better.</p><p>During these sessions, Dan would almost become inconsolable but she was able to control it enough so that he hadn\u2019t tried to hurt himself again. When she would bring Dan out of hypnosis, she would ask him if he remembered anything he had told her and he said no, but from the look in his eyes she knew that was probably not the full truth. But she didn\u2019t push him in confiding in her, she would wait until he was ready to talk about it out of his hypnotized state.</p><p>Today Lela had another session with Dan. She walked over to the closet in her office and drug out the container of toys she had. It made Dan feel more comfortable to have toys and similar things around. There was a knock on her office door, \u201cCome in.\u201d she yelled.</p><p>A young nurse opened the door with Dan in tow, \u201cHere he is Lela.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank\u2019s Rose.\u201d she waved her hand to signal she could go.</p><p>\u201cHi Danny how are you doing this morning?\u201d she smiled brightly.</p><p>She elected to use Danny because she had recently learned Dan responded to it better.</p><p>\u201cGood mommy,\u201d he said happily as he flopped down on the couch with Pooh bear. Clearly, he had gotten used to their routine.</p><p>Lela sighed, eventually they would have to work on that but at the moment if calling her mommy made Dan happy then she wasn\u2019t going to rock the boat.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very good.\u201d she smiled.</p><p>He started pulling toys out of the container \u201cEric and Kate said tonight after dinner we can watch a movie.\u201d he said excitedly.</p><p>\u201cOh, that sounds like fun.\u201d pausing for a moment, \u201cSo Danny do you remember what we have been doing in our sessions?\u201d</p><p>Dan refused to look up, \u201cYes.\u201d he mumbled. Clearly not excited about doing this again.</p><p>\u201cOk, Dan I want you to lay back on the couch and get comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan Pooh bear lay down with me?\u201d he asked as he laid down.</p><p>\u201cOf course whatever makes you feel more comfortable.\u201d</p><p>He sighed as he laid his head on the pillow pulling Pooh bear closer to his body.</p><p>\u201cOk, Dan close your eyes and relax. And as you relax, imagine yourself drifting on a calm and beautiful river. Picture your muscles becoming loose and limp, feeling completely relaxed as you enjoy the sound of my voice. Your eyelids may feel rather heavy&hellip; almost like you deeply asleep&hellip; almost glued together&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Dan breathing evened out signifying they were ready to begin.</p><p>\u201cDan I want you to remember back to when Sir held you and your daddy captive.\u201d</p><p>A whimper escaped his mouth, \u201dI don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>Using her calmest voice, \u201cIt\u2019s ok Dan there is nothing to worry about I\u2019m right here and Sir can\u2019t hurt you anymore.\u201d she reassured him.</p><p>\u201cOk do you remember when your daddy hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he whined.</p><p>\u201cOk walk me through what you remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir walked into the room and I was so scared but daddy told me it would be ok. Sir made daddy eat something, he didn\u2019t want to but sir said he would hurt me.\u201d Lela saw tears forming in the corner of his eyes. \u201cSir was saying all this stuff about how bad I was and how I deserved to be punished. He said everything was my fault.\u201d his voice started to get shaky. \u201cSir gave daddy this sharp thing and told him he had to punish me. Sir said if he didn\u2019t that he would punish me even worse.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes were still closed but there were tears now freely falling down his face.</p><p>\u201cSir held me down and daddy hurt me. Daddy told me I was a good boy but it hurt so much!\u201d he sobbed.</p><p>\u201cDaddy stop why you hurt me? Daddy, Daddy, Daddy! It hurts! I\u2019m sorry I was a bad boy! I\u2019ll be good I promise!\u201d</p><p>Dan was withering back and forth on the couch clenching Pooh bear to his chest as he whimpered, whined and sobbed.</p><p>\u201cDan it\u2019s ok it\u2019s your real your not back there,\u201d Lela said trying to calm him down.</p><p>Dan let out an ear piercing scream with, \u201dI\u2019m sorry daddy!\u201d before he stopped moving and laid crumpled and curled in a ball on the couch.</p><p>\u201cDan I need you to listen closely it&rsquo;s almost time to come back to the room and fully awaken&hellip; is that you&rsquo;ll notice you become more aware of my voice again&hellip;it&rsquo;s time to come out of trance&hellip; when you are ready in a few moments&hellip; As you come out of trance&hellip; you can notice just how relaxed and comfortable you are going to feel&hellip; both now and later&hellip; when you really need come back.\u201d</p><p>Dan whimpered as he slowly opened his eyes. The room was quiet for a minute.</p><p>\u201cMommy why you make me do that?\u201d he whispered refusing to met Lela\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Her heart broke she hated that she had to do this to him. But making him relive what happened was the first step in him accepting what happened and accepting that it wasn\u2019t his fault.</p><p>She sighed \u201cI\u2019m so sorry Danny but we have to do this.\u201d</p><p>Whimpered again Dan rolled himself into a tighter ball it looked like he was trying to disappear.</p><p>She continued, \u201cDan nothing that happened is your fault. Sir was a very bad man who did bad things to you and he made your daddy do bad things to you too. \u201c</p><p>\u201cBut sir said I was bad and that I deserved this,\u201d he whispered lifting up his shirt to reveal the scars on his stomach.</p><p>Lela felt bile coming up her throat. This was the second time she was seeing the scars on Dan\u2019s body and she was just as horrified as the first. She couldn\u2019t believe what she saw carved across his upper torso. In big jagged lettering it read, Daddy hates you whore .</p><p>Lela quickly wiped the tears away that were forming in her eyes and got up from her desk and sat next to him on the couch. Putting her hand on his knee she whispered, \u201cDan what sir said was wrong. Never do you deserve to be punished nor is any of this your fault.\u201d</p><p>Dan flung his arms around her and sobbed, \u201dNot my fault, not my fault.\u201d</p><p>It took a good ten minutes for Dan to calm down enough to be taken back to his room. Lela accompanied the nurse who took him just to make sure he got there alright.</p><p>The first thing Dan did was lay down on his bed and quickly fell into slumber with his pacifier in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Eric asked coming into the room and seeing Dan.</p><p>Lela sighed, \u201dDan had a pretty rough therapy session and it exhausted him quite a bit.\u201d</p><p>Eric looked down at Dan\u2019s sleeping form, \u201cOh. Is he going to be ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will be in due time. Right now we need to focus on letting Dan know that none of this was his fault.\u201d</p><p>Eric nodded his head, \u201dI\u2019ll tell Kate and we will make sure to remind him of that every now and again.\u201d</p><p>Lela smiled, \u201dThanks Eric you&rsquo;re such a good friend to Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan\u2019s sweet I like having him as a friend,\u201d he shrugged his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWill Dan be able to watch a movie with me and Kate tonight?\u201d</p><p>Lela whipped a strand of hair out of Dan\u2019s eyes, she really did feel like his mom sometimes. \u201cAs long as Dan is up for it it should be fine.\u201d</p><p>Eric nodded his head, \u201cOk, I will check with him when he wakes up.\u201d</p><p>Lela said goodbye to Eric and left. She and Dan still had lots of progress to make but today was a good start. Dan being able to say it wasn\u2019t his fault was a big step in the right direction.</p>",

Between the trial and working with Dan, she was really running herself thin. The day she testified she had gone home and cried herself to sleep. She truly didn\u2019t think either Dan or Phil deserved any of this. She struggled with guilt as Phil situation was partially her fault. If she hadn\u2019t of alerted the police then Phil wouldn\u2019t be on trial but if she hadn\u2019t said anything then she would have been in violation of the Hippocratic oath she had taken when she had become a doctor. Dan didn\u2019t help matters any he spent most of his day\u2019s sulking and crying which made her feel even more guilty for the whole thing.</p><p>Lela had been working with Dan every moment she could to progress his therapy in hope\u2019s he might feel comfortable to regress back to his normal state. They had made a little progress but not a ton.</p><p>The other doctors frowned upon her trying to switch group therapy time for personal therapy so she fit it whenever she could. Of course, that was probably the best course of action as much as she hoped Dan would get better soon she didn\u2019t want to push him too hard. She had read several studies on how pushing a regressed person too much could lead to permanent side effects.</p><p>But the one thing she had tried was hypnosis. It was a controversial thing in her field but she felt the benefits would outweigh the cons. Dan seemed to be responding well to them, not much had been accomplished but she had been able to learn more of what had happened well Dan had been held captive. The things she heard where heartbreaking and in fact made her feel sick but she knew that this is what Dan needed to get better.</p><p>During these sessions, Dan would almost become inconsolable but she was able to control it enough so that he hadn\u2019t tried to hurt himself again. When she would bring Dan out of hypnosis, she would ask him if he remembered anything he had told her and he said no, but from the look in his eyes she knew that was probably not the full truth. But she didn\u2019t push him in confiding in her, she would wait until he was ready to talk about it out of his hypnotized state.</p><p>Today Lela had another session with Dan. She walked over to the closet in her office and drug out the container of toys she had. It made Dan feel more comfortable to have toys and similar things around. There was a knock on her office door, \u201cCome in.\u201d she yelled.</p><p>A young nurse opened the door with Dan in tow, \u201cHere he is Lela.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank\u2019s Rose.\u201d she waved her hand to signal she could go.</p><p>\u201cHi Danny how are you doing this morning?\u201d she smiled brightly.</p><p>She elected to use Danny because she had recently learned Dan responded to it better.</p><p>\u201cGood mommy,\u201d he said happily as he flopped down on the couch with Pooh bear. Clearly, he had gotten used to their routine.</p><p>Lela sighed, eventually they would have to work on that but at the moment if calling her mommy made Dan happy then she wasn\u2019t going to rock the boat.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very good.\u201d she smiled.</p><p>He started pulling toys out of the container \u201cEric and Kate said tonight after dinner we can watch a movie.\u201d he said excitedly.</p><p>\u201cOh, that sounds like fun.\u201d pausing for a moment, \u201cSo Danny do you remember what we have been doing in our sessions?\u201d</p><p>Dan refused to look up, \u201cYes.\u201d he mumbled. Clearly not excited about doing this again.</p><p>\u201cOk, Dan I want you to lay back on the couch and get comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan Pooh bear lay down with me?\u201d he asked as he laid down.</p><p>\u201cOf course whatever makes you feel more comfortable.\u201d</p><p>He sighed as he laid his head on the pillow pulling Pooh bear closer to his body.</p><p>\u201cOk, Dan close your eyes and relax. And as you relax, imagine yourself drifting on a calm and beautiful river. Picture your muscles becoming loose and limp, feeling completely relaxed as you enjoy the sound of my voice. Your eyelids may feel rather heavy\u2026 almost like you deeply asleep\u2026 almost glued together\u2026\u201d</p><p>Dan breathing evened out signifying they were ready to begin.</p><p>\u201cDan I want you to remember back to when Sir held you and your daddy captive.\u201d</p><p>A whimper escaped his mouth, \u201dI don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>Using her calmest voice, \u201cIt\u2019s ok Dan there is nothing to worry about I\u2019m right here and Sir can\u2019t hurt you anymore.\u201d she reassured him.</p><p>\u201cOk do you remember when your daddy hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he whined.</p><p>\u201cOk walk me through what you remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir walked into the room and I was so scared but daddy told me it would be ok. Sir made daddy eat something, he didn\u2019t want to but sir said he would hurt me.\u201d Lela saw tears forming in the corner of his eyes. \u201cSir was saying all this stuff about how bad I was and how I deserved to be punished. He said everything was my fault.\u201d his voice started to get shaky. \u201cSir gave daddy this sharp thing and told him he had to punish me. Sir said if he didn\u2019t that he would punish me even worse.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes were still closed but there were tears now freely falling down his face.</p><p>\u201cSir held me down and daddy hurt me. Daddy told me I was a good boy but it hurt so much!\u201d he sobbed.</p><p>\u201cDaddy stop why you hurt me? Daddy, Daddy, Daddy! It hurts! I\u2019m sorry I was a bad boy! I\u2019ll be good I promise!\u201d</p><p>Dan was withering back and forth on the couch clenching Pooh bear to his chest as he whimpered, whined and sobbed.</p><p>\u201cDan it\u2019s ok it\u2019s your real your not back there,\u201d Lela said trying to calm him down.</p><p>Dan let out an ear piercing scream with, \u201dI\u2019m sorry daddy!\u201d before he stopped moving and laid crumpled and curled in a ball on the couch.</p><p>\u201cDan I need you to listen closely it\u2019s almost time to come back to the room and fully awaken\u2026 is that you\u2019ll notice you become more aware of my voice again\u2026it\u2019s time to come out of trance\u2026 when you are ready in a few moments\u2026 As you come out of trance\u2026 you can notice just how relaxed and comfortable you are going to feel\u2026 both now and later\u2026 when you really need come back.\u201d</p><p>Dan whimpered as he slowly opened his eyes. The room was quiet for a minute.</p><p>\u201cMommy why you make me do that?\u201d he whispered refusing to met Lela\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Her heart broke she hated that she had to do this to him. But making him relive what happened was the first step in him accepting what happened and accepting that it wasn\u2019t his fault.</p><p>She sighed \u201cI\u2019m so sorry Danny but we have to do this.\u201d</p><p>Whimpered again Dan rolled himself into a tighter ball it looked like he was trying to disappear.</p><p>She continued, \u201cDan nothing that happened is your fault. Sir was a very bad man who did bad things to you and he made your daddy do bad things to you too. \u201c</p><p>\u201cBut sir said I was bad and that I deserved this,\u201d he whispered lifting up his shirt to reveal the scars on his stomach.</p><p>Lela felt bile coming up her throat. This was the second time she was seeing the scars on Dan\u2019s body and she was just as horrified as the first. She couldn\u2019t believe what she saw carved across his upper torso. In big jagged lettering it read, Daddy hates you whore .</p><p>Lela quickly wiped the tears away that were forming in her eyes and got up from her desk and sat next to him on the couch. Putting her hand on his knee she whispered, \u201cDan what sir said was wrong. Never do you deserve to be punished nor is any of this your fault.\u201d</p><p>Dan flung his arms around her and sobbed, \u201dNot my fault, not my fault.\u201d</p><p>It took a good ten minutes for Dan to calm down enough to be taken back to his room. Lela accompanied the nurse who took him just to make sure he got there alright.</p><p>The first thing Dan did was lay down on his bed and quickly fell into slumber with his pacifier in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Eric asked coming into the room and seeing Dan.</p><p>Lela sighed, \u201dDan had a pretty rough therapy session and it exhausted him quite a bit.\u201d</p><p>Eric looked down at Dan\u2019s sleeping form, \u201cOh. Is he going to be ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will be in due time. Right now we need to focus on letting Dan know that none of this was his fault.\u201d</p><p>Eric nodded his head, \u201dI\u2019ll tell Kate and we will make sure to remind him of that every now and again.\u201d</p><p>Lela smiled, \u201dThanks Eric you\u2019re such a good friend to Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan\u2019s sweet I like having him as a friend,\u201d he shrugged his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWill Dan be able to watch a movie with me and Kate tonight?\u201d</p><p>Lela whipped a strand of hair out of Dan\u2019s eyes, she really did feel like his mom sometimes. \u201cAs long as Dan is up for it it should be fine.\u201d</p><p>Eric nodded his head, \u201cOk, I will check with him when he wakes up.\u201d</p><p>Lela said goodbye to Eric and left. She and Dan still had lots of progress to make but today was a good start. Dan being able to say it wasn\u2019t his fault was a big step in the right direction.</p>",

Sophie&rsquo;s Curse- a jumpscare-tacular game where you have to keep&nbsp; different lights charged and if any go out, Sophie jumps out at you. Also you have to do different things depending on different noises she makes. I imagine they&rsquo;d be really spooked.</p><p>3. Bendy and the Ink Machine- a 30&prime;s inspired horror about an animation studio (I&rsquo;m sure most of you have heard of it)</p><p>4. Donut County- a funny game about creating a hole and getting bigger by making things fall into the hole. It&rsquo;s quite katamari like and also has a story to it.</p><p>5. Baldi&rsquo;s Basics- You collect 7 notebooks while being chased down by low quality and yet terrifying characters in a school.</p><p>6. Night in the Woods- A young college student named Mae drops out of college and goes back to her home town to see her friends have grown up while she hasn&rsquo;t. And there&rsquo;s something disturbing going on in her small hometown. (not quite a scary game but with scary elements. Also wonderful characters and super funny and full of emotion. Reminds me of Undertale in a small way. <br /></p><p>7. Oh Sir the Insult Simulator- You see who can come up with the best insults toward the other person, using a list of words. Only one person can use each word and you have to use proper grammar. Most of the insults are old time-y and not that bad but it&rsquo;s quite funny. <br /></p>",
