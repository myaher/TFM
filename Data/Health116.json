            "description": "[Support This Blog:\n*Patreon*]\nI am a PROGRESSIVE (on most issues).  I am NOT a liberal.  If you are a liberal, then I wouldn't suggest following me.  There's going to come a point when we don't see eye-to-eye, debate or discussion will ensue, and in my experience, liberals can't handle the discourse.  So know your limits and be responsible for your own choices.  If you don't want to be called out on your bullshit, then don't comment on my posts.  And no one forces you to follow me or engage with me.  If what I say upsets you, then just unfollow.  You don't need to message me, pleading with me to change my views in order to keep you around.  And you don't need to pick a fight and scream about blocking me when you don't like my refusal to cater to your personal preferences.  I don't appreciate the drama liberals bring on my blog because they can't handle disagreement and rigorous debate.  IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE DISCOURSE, THEN DON'T ENGAGE IN IT!  \nI am critical of BOTH the left wing and the right wing.  (This does not mean I think \"both sides\" are equal.)  If you can't handle the criticisms, then leave.  \nMy main sources of news are Secular Talk, The Humanist Report, The Jimmy Dore Show, The Young Turks, The Young Turks - Investigates, and The Young Turks - Politics (now known as Rebel HQ).  You can find their channels on Youtube.  I highly recommend them.\nI am very mistrustful of mainstream media.  So posting an article does not mean I endorse the source, or that I agree with all aspects of the article.  If I do post an article I really disagree with (not uncommon for me to do), I try to say so (in the tags, at the very least), but sometimes I forget.  I wish I had the time to write up well thought out responses to articles, but unfortunately, that's just not possible right now.  And just FYI: not a lot of thought goes into my tag commentary.\nAlso, tumblr sometimes autofills tags on posts.  I don't have time to manually delete all of the autofilled-tags.  So I can't swear to their accuracy.  \nAll my relevant commentary is tagged with the #me tag.  I can be extremely aggressive, honest, and impatient.  So peruse with caution.  I do reblog my own commentary multiple times.  I can put a lot of work into it and I want it to actually be seen.    \nSatirical posts are tagged with the #satire tag.  \nPosts are scheduled throughout the day.  I do my best to schedule posts, but sometimes I make a mistake.  So if you see a post with a deadline or date that's passed, it's probably because I made a mistake when scheduling it.  \nIf you don't like the way I run my blog, then LEAVE.  If you don't like the way I format my posts, then LEAVE.  If you don't like the language I use, then LEAVE.  If you don't like my anger, then LEAVE. \n Sending me messages giving me unsolicited \"suggestions\" about how I should run MY blog is NOT YOUR PLACE.  It is intensely rude and very presumptuous.  If you want to have discussions about issues, fine.  But tone policing and nitpicking over formatting preferences is not welcome.\nI do block blogs that don't appear to be run by an actual person (this is roughly 50% to 75% of all blogs that follow me).  This includes porn blogs, blogs that are attempting to sell you something, etc.  Blocking REAL accounts is a very rare occurrence.  If I do block, these are the general guidelines. If you're responding to my posts with troll-like comments, saying the same shit over and over again, or making it difficult for me to get through my activity feed by clogging it up, then I may block you.  Disagreement is fine, but if you're engaging in death threats, inciting violence, excusing violence, being pro-violence in any way, engaging in hate speech, doxxing, etc., then I may block you.  If we're having a debate, please actually respond to my replies.  Don't be shady and try to hide my replies.  If you reblog my posts, DO NOT edit or delete anything I write.  I don't care if it's just the excerpted part of the article I include, or my own commentary.  If you want to reblog my article without the excerpt, then please just copy the link to the article and post it to your own blog.  DO NOT PLAGIARIZE ANYTHING I WRITE.  I don't care if it's my tag commentary or whatever.  If you want to use my words, all you have to do is cite me.   \n Do not advertise or promote your blogs/products/services on my posts.  Blocks may be temporary or permanent.  If I accidentally blocked you, please feel free to message me on one of my other blogs (listed below) and I can unblock you.  \nSome of my other blogs: \nMel-Esprit\nPolitics-Junkie\nMostly Obscure Quotes \nMel-Colors \nMel-Words \nMy goodreads account: Here.",
