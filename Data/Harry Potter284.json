In a way that made him angry almost. He had chased after Lily Evans for as long as he remembered, only for her to deny him and fall in love with James Potter, and now that he had someone who truly and genuinely loved him, he couldn\u2019t- <i>didn\u2019t</i>- want to let go.</p><!-- more --><p>He found himself in Hagrid\u2019s pumpkin patch, being greeted by an adolescent Buckbeak. The air had gotten warmer, moist even, making the pumpkins grow much more. His plan was to simply take a walk through the Forbbiden Forest, greet the foreboding trees and mossy earth. Most would be frightened and nervous about it, due to its uncontrolled magic and unguarded creatures, but he didn\u2019t feel the disappeal of it. It was peaceful to him, platonically welcoming.</p><p>But now as he stood in front of Buckbeak, he reminded himself of his mission- his end goal. There was no more avoidance for this, only face-front endurance. He expected you to be here, staying with Hagrid. He knew he was the closest thing to family for you right now. In fact, he could hear you talking to him, he just couldn\u2019t get himself to knock on the door. Something so simple seemed so hard, it was almost comical, had it not been for the utter truth that lay in every thread of it.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He turned, and there you stood, eyes glazed and red, nose red, cheeks the same. And yet, how <i>breathtaking </i>you were.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful, even like this,\u201d he said softly, watching you wipe underneath your eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d you bite, sniffing a bit.</p><p>\u201cTo apologize, make an amends\u2026\u201d he replies in the same soft tone while walking toward you, \u201cYou gave me a choice, and it made me realize- quite a lot. About myself, about my life\u2026</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, for not realizing you were the first person to love me- to <i>genuinely </i>love me. Even though I am so, <i>utterly </i>broken in places that can\u2019t be fixed, you still took me the way that I am and disregarded what everyone saw as bad, the rumors, the glares, and odd glances. You understood me without asking, you let me in without wanting <i>anything </i>in return besides an equal amount of love and time you put into me- and I was <i>stupid </i>enough to deny you of that. I know that I don\u2019t deserve you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2026 I also know that I want you in my life, with me, <i>always</i>.\u201d he finished, looking at his feet, playing with his fingernails. They were cropped and dirty, bloody from the nervous tick he had made himself of biting them. He heard the sigh you gave before he felt you envelop him in a hug around his midsection. He missed this, <i>you</i>. The warmth and feelings that came with you, the comforting simplicity of your being, it all made him forget the bad and still made his heart skip beats and stomach jump for joy.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me a lot more than an apology, Silly Snape,\u201d you said in his chest, making him chuckle.</p><p>\u201cI know, love,\u201d he replied, pressing a kiss to the top of your head before resting his cheek against it, sighing and closing his eyes. You leaned your head back, meeting his now open-eyed gaze and cupped his face with both your hands before pressing your lips to his softly, tears intertwining with mouths, leaving a salty taste on his tongue.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank <i>Merlin</i>, I didn\u2019t know how long I\u2019d be able to handle the two of yer mopin\u2019!\u201d Hagrid\u2019s voice boomed, surprising Snape a bit and making you laugh.</p><p>\u201cGo away you goofy giant!\u201d you groaned in a joking way.</p><hr><p>He woke up in the middle of the night, you wrapped completely around him. He could hear the soft breathes you gave in your sleep. The two of you didn\u2019t make love that night, just thrived in the comfort of being together again, sleep hitting the both of you hard from <i>months </i>of emotional exhaustion. He slowly unwrapped you from his body, going into the living room and sitting at an open window, observing the forest and Black Lake. Such beautiful things, given a dark name. He couldn\u2019t understand it. Chills ran up his body as the wind blew, giving a cool breeze compared the warm springtime air. School would be out soon, the students would be sent back home for a few months and then a new semester would start once more. The muggle saying of time flying when you were happy was true, he supposed. He remembered how you introduced him to it, <i>\u2018Time flies by when you\u2019re having a good time,\u2019</i>. You didn\u2019t mean happiness in that moment, but he supposed it was fitting as well, he thought with a chuckle.</p><p>The floorboards creaked softly before he felt your hands snake around his bare waist, nails trailing his stomach before retreating to his back, rubbing it as your lips met the skin between his shoulders- a favorite spot of yours, and his as well.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you leave bed, darling?\u201d you asked sleepily, pressing your cheek to his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cTo think a bit\u2026 it\u2019s odd, how one little thing-\u201d he says turning around and placing his hands on your hips, \u201c-can change a person\u2019s life so drastically.\u201d his lifts your chin with his hand, smiling down at you, gaining a tired smile from you. You leaned up, kissing the side of his chin before taking his hand, mumbling something incoherent about being sleepy before dragging him back to bed.</p>",

He could hear the soft breathes you gave in your sleep. The two of you didn&rsquo;t make love that night, just thrived in the comfort of being together again, sleep hitting the both of you hard from <i>months </i>of emotional exhaustion. He slowly unwrapped you from his body, going into the living room and sitting at an open window, observing the forest and Black Lake. Such beautiful things, given a dark name. He couldn&rsquo;t understand it. Chills ran up his body as the wind blew, giving a cool breeze compared the warm springtime air. School would be out soon, the students would be sent back home for a few months and then a new semester would start once more. The muggle saying of time flying when you were happy was true, he supposed. He remembered how you introduced him to it, <i>&lsquo;Time flies by when you&rsquo;re having a good time,&rsquo;</i>. You didn&rsquo;t mean happiness in that moment, but he supposed it was fitting as well, he thought with a chuckle.</p><p>The floorboards creaked softly before he felt your hands snake around his bare waist, nails trailing his stomach before retreating to his back, rubbing it as your lips met the skin between his shoulders- a favorite spot of yours, and his as well.</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you leave bed, darling?&rdquo; you asked sleepily, pressing your cheek to his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;To think a bit&hellip; it&rsquo;s odd, how one little thing-&rdquo; he says turning around and placing his hands on your hips, &ldquo;-can change a person&rsquo;s life so drastically.&rdquo; his lifts your chin with his hand, smiling down at you, gaining a tired smile from you. You leaned up, kissing the side of his chin before taking his hand, mumbling something incoherent about being sleepy before dragging him back to bed.</p>",
