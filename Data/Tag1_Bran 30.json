I said, \u201cWhat?! You\u2019re joking.\u201d It was the very last thing I expected to happen. I was convinced they had sent a script to everyone in which they become king or queen, so I still didn\u2019t believe it until the read-through.</p>\n\n<p>But I think he is a great character to take on that role. You never thought of him in that way, but what more could you ask for in a king than to have no personal attachments, no agenda, but have a calm understanding of the entire universe? He\u2019s the ideal person to be in charge.</p>\n\n<p>[Creators] David [Benioff] and Dan [Weiss] told me there were two things [author] George R.R. Martin had planned for Bran, and that was the Hodor revelation, and that he would be king. So that\u2019s pretty special to be directly involved in something that is part of George\u2019s vision. It was a really nice way to wrap it up.</p>",

He always gave blurry answers, half baked truths, definitely lied about seeing the future and God knows what else! So I was putting all these pieces together and figured that he was plotting everything since Season 4 actually! here's my summary of it:- He decides to reveal the secret his father kept for 18 years. He first reveals it to Jon (knowing Jon's identity will mean nothing in the end). He then makes Jon decide whether to tell Sansa or not. Knowing he would, Sansa reveals it to Tyrion &gt; Varys &gt; The World, thus creating trust issues between Jon &amp; Dany. He then offers to be used as bait for NK - which got Theon, Jorah and more killed. He then kept creating situations where Dany would lose everything one by one. He literally saw what's happening everywhere yet didn\u2019t warn about Euron's fleet - got Rhaegal and Missandei killed.\\n\\nNow we come to his final move - He doesn't go to KL because he already visioned drogon flying over KL, IN SEASON 4! He knew what happens because of the situation he creates for Dany. So he sits tight with his mouth shut and basically gets all the civilians in KL killed along with Cersei. After that, he knew Tyrion would talk Jon into murdering Dany, breaking Jon's faith completely. With Jon in prison, he shows up in KL and changes the governmental system of choosing rulers through Tyrion (a prisoner\u2019s) words and manages to Crown himself the King. What's even ridiculous is nobody bothered to ask Bran how he knew all of this as he downright admitted \\&quot;Why do you think I came all this way?\\&quot; No questions asked. everyone becomes a mute. Bran then sends the last potential threat to his rule, Jon, beyond the wall with condition that he will take no wives, hold no land and father no children therefore stipping Jon off his Targaryen heritage completely. With Jon &amp; Dany gone, he reigns over the world stress free. Bran used everyone as puppets to his show. He\u2019s not \u201cBran the broken\u201d. He is \u201cBran the Puppeteer\u201d (except the threat of Drogon - an inconclusive end)\\n*video credits to Drew Belmor on YT (with some extra edited scenes) #got #GameofThrones #daenerys #jonerys #jonsnow&quot;}}\"><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BxzfX4EH-EM/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

He always gave blurry answers, half baked truths, definitely lied about seeing the future and God knows what else! So I was putting all these pieces together and figured that he was plotting everything since Season 4 actually! here's my summary of it:- He decides to reveal the secret his father kept for 18 years. He first reveals it to Jon (knowing Jon's identity will mean nothing in the end). He then makes Jon decide whether to tell Sansa or not. Knowing he would, Sansa reveals it to Tyrion &gt; Varys &gt; The World, thus creating trust issues between Jon &amp; Dany. He then offers to be used as bait for NK - which got Theon, Jorah and more killed. He then kept creating situations where Dany would lose everything one by one. He literally saw what's happening everywhere yet didn\u2019t warn about Euron's fleet - got Rhaegal and Missandei killed.\\n\\nNow we come to his final move - He doesn't go to KL because he already visioned drogon flying over KL, IN SEASON 4! He knew what happens because of the situation he creates for Dany. So he sits tight with his mouth shut and basically gets all the civilians in KL killed along with Cersei. After that, he knew Tyrion would talk Jon into murdering Dany, breaking Jon's faith completely. With Jon in prison, he shows up in KL and changes the governmental system of choosing rulers through Tyrion (a prisoner\u2019s) words and manages to Crown himself the King. What's even ridiculous is nobody bothered to ask Bran how he knew all of this as he downright admitted \\&quot;Why do you think I came all this way?\\&quot; No questions asked. everyone becomes a mute. Bran then sends the last potential threat to his rule, Jon, beyond the wall with condition that he will take no wives, hold no land and father no children therefore stipping Jon off his Targaryen heritage completely. With Jon &amp; Dany gone, he reigns over the world stress free. Bran used everyone as puppets to his show. He\u2019s not \u201cBran the broken\u201d. He is \u201cBran the Puppeteer\u201d (except the threat of Drogon - an inconclusive end)\\n*video credits to Drew Belmor on YT (with some extra edited scenes) #got #GameofThrones #daenerys #jonerys #jonsnow&quot;}}\"><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BxzfX4EH-EM/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

He always gave blurry answers, half baked truths, definitely lied about seeing the future and God knows what else! So I was putting all these pieces together and figured that he was plotting everything since Season 4 actually! here's my summary of it:- He decides to reveal the secret his father kept for 18 years. He first reveals it to Jon (knowing Jon's identity will mean nothing in the end). He then makes Jon decide whether to tell Sansa or not. Knowing he would, Sansa reveals it to Tyrion &gt; Varys &gt; The World, thus creating trust issues between Jon &amp; Dany. He then offers to be used as bait for NK - which got Theon, Jorah and more killed. He then kept creating situations where Dany would lose everything one by one. He literally saw what's happening everywhere yet didn\u2019t warn about Euron's fleet - got Rhaegal and Missandei killed.\\n\\nNow we come to his final move - He doesn't go to KL because he already visioned drogon flying over KL, IN SEASON 4! He knew what happens because of the situation he creates for Dany. So he sits tight with his mouth shut and basically gets all the civilians in KL killed along with Cersei. After that, he knew Tyrion would talk Jon into murdering Dany, breaking Jon's faith completely. With Jon in prison, he shows up in KL and changes the governmental system of choosing rulers through Tyrion (a prisoner\u2019s) words and manages to Crown himself the King. What's even ridiculous is nobody bothered to ask Bran how he knew all of this as he downright admitted \\&quot;Why do you think I came all this way?\\&quot; No questions asked. everyone becomes a mute. Bran then sends the last potential threat to his rule, Jon, beyond the wall with condition that he will take no wives, hold no land and father no children therefore stipping Jon off his Targaryen heritage completely. With Jon &amp; Dany gone, he reigns over the world stress free. Bran used everyone as puppets to his show. He\u2019s not \u201cBran the broken\u201d. He is \u201cBran the Puppeteer\u201d (except the threat of Drogon - an inconclusive end)\\n*video credits to Drew Belmor on YT (with some extra edited scenes) #got #GameofThrones #daenerys #jonerys #jonsnow&quot;}}\"><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BxzfX4EH-EM/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

He always gave blurry answers, half baked truths, definitely lied about seeing the future and God knows what else! So I was putting all these pieces together and figured that he was plotting everything since Season 4 actually! here's my summary of it:- He decides to reveal the secret his father kept for 18 years. He first reveals it to Jon (knowing Jon's identity will mean nothing in the end). He then makes Jon decide whether to tell Sansa or not. Knowing he would, Sansa reveals it to Tyrion &gt; Varys &gt; The World, thus creating trust issues between Jon &amp; Dany. He then offers to be used as bait for NK - which got Theon, Jorah and more killed. He then kept creating situations where Dany would lose everything one by one. He literally saw what's happening everywhere yet didn&rsquo;t warn about Euron's fleet - got Rhaegal and Missandei killed.\\n\\nNow we come to his final move - He doesn't go to KL because he already visioned drogon flying over KL, IN SEASON 4! He knew what happens because of the situation he creates for Dany. So he sits tight with his mouth shut and basically gets all the civilians in KL killed along with Cersei. After that, he knew Tyrion would talk Jon into murdering Dany, breaking Jon's faith completely. With Jon in prison, he shows up in KL and changes the governmental system of choosing rulers through Tyrion (a prisoner&rsquo;s) words and manages to Crown himself the King. What's even ridiculous is nobody bothered to ask Bran how he knew all of this as he downright admitted \\&quot;Why do you think I came all this way?\\&quot; No questions asked. everyone becomes a mute. Bran then sends the last potential threat to his rule, Jon, beyond the wall with condition that he will take no wives, hold no land and father no children therefore stipping Jon off his Targaryen heritage completely. With Jon &amp; Dany gone, he reigns over the world stress free. Bran used everyone as puppets to his show. He&rsquo;s not &ldquo;Bran the broken&rdquo;. He is &ldquo;Bran the Puppeteer&rdquo; (except the threat of Drogon - an inconclusive end)\\n*video credits to Drew Belmor on YT (with some extra edited scenes) #got #GameofThrones #daenerys #jonerys #jonsnow&quot;}}\"><blockquote> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BxzfX4EH-EM/\" target=\"_blank\">        View this post on Instagram            </a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BxzfX4EH-EM/\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Jonerys Starkgaryen (@jonerys.starkgaryen)</a> on May 23, 2019 at 5:10am PDT</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"#\"><img src=\"https://assets.tumblr.com/images/inline_placeholder.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"14\"/></a></p></figure><p>A ending where bran has always been the hidden puppet master/ the true villan of it all.

        "body": "<h1>Game of Thrones S8xE04 Part 1</h1><p>Previous:  <a href=\"https://ellipsis05.tumblr.com/post/184970289841/game-of-thrones-s8xe03-the-long-night\">https://ellipsis05.tumblr.com/post/184970289841/game-of-thrones-s8xe03-the-long-night</a> </p><p>There were two children, one girl and the other a boy. Both had beautiful golden hair and were inseparable from each other. Bran watched them run and play around the empty halls of the castle in broad daylight. The castle was large and beautiful it sat atop a tall rock and overlooked the sea. The furniture and covers all were painted gold and red with embroidered lions on them and utensils were in shining gold with lions engraved. He followed the two children in the bowels of the castle. In the middle of the room there appears to be an enormous box covered by red fabric with golden tassels on the edges. The little girl pulled the fabric slowly revealing a large lion licking its paws sitting in the corner of the cage. The lion set eyes on the little girl. It started growling at her and tried to pounce on the little girl. The lion was clawing its cage trying to get out but the steel was thick and strong enough to even withstand the large lions strength. This frightened the little girl and made her jump. The little boy giggled at the sight of his scared sister. Angry with her brother, the girl tempted the boy and dared him to climb the cage. When the lion finally stopped clawing and went back to the corner to lick his paws again. The little boy prideful enough to not turn down a challenge from his sister took a stool and started to grab hold of the steel bars. He managed to push himself up to the top part of the cage. But the lion starts grunting again. Roaring, the lion jumped to reach the boy. And the words \u201cLannisters don\u2019t act like fools!\u201d starts echoing in his vision in a deep angry voice. His vision shifts again. </p><p>This time it was the throne room at the red keep. It looked different, there was no Iron throne only a thousand swords sitting in a pile in the dark empty room. The swords were dirty and ruined, some were broken and the others looked old and beat. The swords were either covered in dirt or in blood,  and sometimes even both.</p><p>There was something dark around the aura of the swords, something that highlighted power that was raw and without shape. Bran has also noticed the sigil on the stained glass window that used to overlook the throne has changed too, instead of a roaring lion it was a red three headed dragon with a black background. Bran wanted to look at the other rooms as well, but stopped when he saw a young girl. The little girl had silver hair and skin as white as milk, she was looking with the same wonder and astonishment as Bran was at the large pile of swords. The vision begins to shift again, this time he hears the words in a deep loud and rather raspy voice \u201cBurn them all! Burn them!\u201d. </p><p>He was now back in Winterfell, only it was the old Winterfell. A young man was standing in the middle of the muddy courtyard with a little boy. His wife rushed to the courtyard to meet him after a very long time. But instead of warm embraces to welcome the man she gave him a cold dead stare. She was shocked to see him with the little boy. But her expression  changed from surprise to anger very quickly. She looked at the man with anger and then to the little boy with hate. The man and the boy could read her expressions like a book not that she was trying to hide it from the start. Which was the point\u2014 she didn\u2019t, she had no intention to. She wanted the boy to feel that he was not welcome here. When the night came, the man\u2019s family gathered to eat dinner. Bran saw the little boy sat at a separate table in the corner of the room. He was eating alone while the others shared food on the long table. The candlelight formed shadows on his face which exposed his sadness even more. Bran seemed that this vision was not the fruit of his power but his very own memory in the past when he was still Bran Stark. A soft weak voice  of a woman spoke in the background once more \u201cHis name is Aegon Targaryen\u201d.</p><p>His vision stopped and he was back at the present again. He was still under the tree, the wights had still surrounded him and the Night King was still at his front. His mark started to sting even more. Bran realized the Night King has been watching his visions too. He begins to worry that even his mind is no longer safe. He observed the wights around him but stopped to search once he had laid eyes on Arya. Whom he thought was dead the minute the Night King tossed her away. She was tied down by the Night King\u2019s henchmen. She was covered with blood and snow. She was tugging on to them trying to resist but was still whimpering because of her broken arm. The Night King started speaking in Valerian and to Bran\u2019s surprise he could understand him. </p><p>\u201cThe Long Night has finally begun, we have brought back the darkness and snow that was destined to envelope the realm for centuries! We have finally captured the Three Eyed Raven! The memory of the realm and the key to our great conquest!\u201d,</p><p>The Night Kings voice was deep and loud his words echoed in the Godswood. The other wights started making random noises an excuse for a cheer. They were thumping their weapons in the ground and some were waving their weapons up in the air. </p><p>\u201cBut the war is not over. There are others who have fled this battle\u201d, with these words he halted their cheering. </p><p>\u201cCowards who have run away from the fight and have escaped conversion. We have been gone for far too long! They now possess the powers of dragons, witches and many more that will rival our abilities greatly. We must continue our great conquest. We must not let our enemies flee from us so lightly, that is why we will not stop here! We will keep fighting until we have conquered all of Westeros!\u201d There was nothing but silence in the Godswood. The wights have stopped cheering and moving their weapons. Heck they even stopped moving for some reason. They just stood like statues in the snow staring at the Night King. The Night King then turns to Bran this time lowering his voice. </p><p>\u201c&hellip;And that is why you will find them for me\u201d. He raises his hand in front of him and Bran begins to warg into ravens, wolves and then into rats at a dark conceited tunnel.</p><p>They kept marching in the cramped tunnel for almost half an hour. There were turns left and right even staircases that led up and down. This made it harder to predict the route of where they are now. Are they going further North or the opposite? Troubled by where it may lead to or its possibility to actually not lead to anything. All relying on luck that maybe it could lead them to safety. Wounded and tired, the only thing guiding them were fire from the torches and Ser Davos\u2019 voice ordering them to continue walking. </p><p>Further up North, Jon and Daenerys were exhausted from the great battle. They could barely keep their eyes open. Luckily, none of them showed signs of falling of the dragon. But the dragons kept cruising  the clouds. Regardless of direction, they were brought further and further into the North. But the dragons were also tired, their wings could barely fly anymore and were gradually sinking to the ground leaving the misty clouds and crashing to the trees. The two awoke immediately when the feeling of flying suddenly shifted into falling and crashing. She halted Drogon and Rhaegal and have decided to camp there for the night. Jon gathered some wood to set a fire. The weakened Rhaegal was kind enough to light up the firewood to keep them warm. They huddled around the campfire. Drogon shielded Daenerys with his wing to protect her from the cold. Soon everyone was asleep except for Jon who was sitting at a log and was calmly staring at the fire. He watched the fire eat all the bits and pieces of the wood, burning them to a crisp and then disappearing into smoke. He was worried about what would happen to Bran. He finally got to meet him all this years after waking from a coma and then another tragedy has taken him away from his family again. He doesn\u2019t know the Night King\u2019s plan for Bran or if his sisters are alive which made him worry even more. He looked at Dany, she was calm and sleeping like a child under the dragon\u2019s wing.  The forest was quiet and only the sound of fire was breaking its silence. But not even the most quiet and tranquil of nights could put him to sleep after what he has experienced.</p><p>The people kept walking in the tunnel. Gendry who was already being weighed down by his heavy hammer was helping assist Sam who was trampled on by wights during the battle. He was whimpering and could barely walk. He had large bruises in his arms and was clutching on to a piece of dragon stone. The other Northerners in the back claimed to have heard a noise. It was a crashing sound that echoed through the halls of the tunnel. Out of curiosity two of the Northerners stopped and starred at the back end of the tunnel. They shone their torch at it but failed to illuminate the dark passageway. They couldn\u2019t see anything thats possibly making the sound so they turned back to try and catch up with the others.</p><p>A few minutes later, the two men noticed something. They were too far away from the others but they were hearing stepping sounds coming toward them. They shone the lamp once more. Finally they sight something, something they rather had wished wasn\u2019t there. It was a woman, her clothes were in tatters covered in dirt and her hair black and long it draped over her face. She was just standing there with her back against the wall. They couldn\u2019t see her face, she had her head down the whole time, so the men started talking to her but no answer came. The two decided to take steps back frightened by how just the thought of how a wight have managed to wander in a place like this. The woman raises her head. Revealing two eyes closed and a face resembling that of a corpse. The two Northerners  let out gasps and were shaking vigorously that the man holding the torch almost drops it. She opened her eyes.

Both had beautiful golden hair and were inseparable from each other. Bran watched them run and play around the empty halls of the castle in broad daylight. The castle was large and beautiful it sat atop a tall rock and overlooked the sea. The furniture and covers all were painted gold and red with embroidered lions on them and utensils were in shining gold with lions engraved. He followed the two children in the bowels of the castle. In the middle of the room there appears to be an enormous box covered by red fabric with golden tassels on the edges. The little girl pulled the fabric slowly revealing a large lion licking its paws sitting in the corner of the cage. The lion set eyes on the little girl. It started growling at her and tried to pounce on the little girl. The lion was clawing its cage trying to get out but the steel was thick and strong enough to even withstand the large lions strength. This frightened the little girl and made her jump. The little boy giggled at the sight of his scared sister. Angry with her brother, the girl tempted the boy and dared him to climb the cage. When the lion finally stopped clawing and went back to the corner to lick his paws again. The little boy prideful enough to not turn down a challenge from his sister took a stool and started to grab hold of the steel bars. He managed to push himself up to the top part of the cage. But the lion starts grunting again. Roaring, the lion jumped to reach the boy. And the words \u201cLannisters don\u2019t act like fools!\u201d starts echoing in his vision in a deep angry voice. His vision shifts again. </p><p>This time it was the throne room at the red keep. It looked different, there was no Iron throne only a thousand swords sitting in a pile in the dark empty room. The swords were dirty and ruined, some were broken and the others looked old and beat. The swords were either covered in dirt or in blood,  and sometimes even both.</p><p>There was something dark around the aura of the swords, something that highlighted power that was raw and without shape. Bran has also noticed the sigil on the stained glass window that used to overlook the throne has changed too, instead of a roaring lion it was a red three headed dragon with a black background. Bran wanted to look at the other rooms as well, but stopped when he saw a young girl. The little girl had silver hair and skin as white as milk, she was looking with the same wonder and astonishment as Bran was at the large pile of swords. The vision begins to shift again, this time he hears the words in a deep loud and rather raspy voice \u201cBurn them all! Burn them!\u201d. </p><p>He was now back in Winterfell, only it was the old Winterfell. A young man was standing in the middle of the muddy courtyard with a little boy. His wife rushed to the courtyard to meet him after a very long time. But instead of warm embraces to welcome the man she gave him a cold dead stare. She was shocked to see him with the little boy. But her expression  changed from surprise to anger very quickly. She looked at the man with anger and then to the little boy with hate. The man and the boy could read her expressions like a book not that she was trying to hide it from the start. Which was the point\u2014 she didn\u2019t, she had no intention to. She wanted the boy to feel that he was not welcome here. When the night came, the man\u2019s family gathered to eat dinner. Bran saw the little boy sat at a separate table in the corner of the room. He was eating alone while the others shared food on the long table. The candlelight formed shadows on his face which exposed his sadness even more. Bran seemed that this vision was not the fruit of his power but his very own memory in the past when he was still Bran Stark. A soft weak voice  of a woman spoke in the background once more \u201cHis name is Aegon Targaryen\u201d.</p><p>His vision stopped and he was back at the present again. He was still under the tree, the wights had still surrounded him and the Night King was still at his front. His mark started to sting even more. Bran realized the Night King has been watching his visions too. He begins to worry that even his mind is no longer safe. He observed the wights around him but stopped to search once he had laid eyes on Arya. Whom he thought was dead the minute the Night King tossed her away. She was tied down by the Night King\u2019s henchmen. She was covered with blood and snow. She was tugging on to them trying to resist but was still whimpering because of her broken arm. The Night King started speaking in Valerian and to Bran\u2019s surprise he could understand him. </p><p>\u201cThe Long Night has finally begun, we have brought back the darkness and snow that was destined to envelope the realm for centuries! We have finally captured the Three Eyed Raven! The memory of the realm and the key to our great conquest!\u201d,</p><p>The Night Kings voice was deep and loud his words echoed in the Godswood. The other wights started making random noises an excuse for a cheer. They were thumping their weapons in the ground and some were waving their weapons up in the air. </p><p>\u201cBut the war is not over. There are others who have fled this battle\u201d, with these words he halted their cheering. </p><p>\u201cCowards who have run away from the fight and have escaped conversion. We have been gone for far too long! They now possess the powers of dragons, witches and many more that will rival our abilities greatly. We must continue our great conquest. We must not let our enemies flee from us so lightly, that is why we will not stop here! We will keep fighting until we have conquered all of Westeros!\u201d There was nothing but silence in the Godswood. The wights have stopped cheering and moving their weapons. Heck they even stopped moving for some reason. They just stood like statues in the snow staring at the Night King. The Night King then turns to Bran this time lowering his voice. </p><p>\u201c\u2026And that is why you will find them for me\u201d. He raises his hand in front of him and Bran begins to warg into ravens, wolves and then into rats at a dark conceited tunnel.</p><p>They kept marching in the cramped tunnel for almost half an hour. There were turns left and right even staircases that led up and down. This made it harder to predict the route of where they are now. Are they going further North or the opposite? Troubled by where it may lead to or its possibility to actually not lead to anything. All relying on luck that maybe it could lead them to safety. Wounded and tired, the only thing guiding them were fire from the torches and Ser Davos\u2019 voice ordering them to continue walking. </p><p>Further up North, Jon and Daenerys were exhausted from the great battle. They could barely keep their eyes open. Luckily, none of them showed signs of falling of the dragon. But the dragons kept cruising  the clouds. Regardless of direction, they were brought further and further into the North. But the dragons were also tired, their wings could barely fly anymore and were gradually sinking to the ground leaving the misty clouds and crashing to the trees. The two awoke immediately when the feeling of flying suddenly shifted into falling and crashing. She halted Drogon and Rhaegal and have decided to camp there for the night. Jon gathered some wood to set a fire. The weakened Rhaegal was kind enough to light up the firewood to keep them warm. They huddled around the campfire. Drogon shielded Daenerys with his wing to protect her from the cold. Soon everyone was asleep except for Jon who was sitting at a log and was calmly staring at the fire. He watched the fire eat all the bits and pieces of the wood, burning them to a crisp and then disappearing into smoke. He was worried about what would happen to Bran. He finally got to meet him all this years after waking from a coma and then another tragedy has taken him away from his family again. He doesn\u2019t know the Night King\u2019s plan for Bran or if his sisters are alive which made him worry even more. He looked at Dany, she was calm and sleeping like a child under the dragon\u2019s wing.  The forest was quiet and only the sound of fire was breaking its silence. But not even the most quiet and tranquil of nights could put him to sleep after what he has experienced.</p><p>The people kept walking in the tunnel. Gendry who was already being weighed down by his heavy hammer was helping assist Sam who was trampled on by wights during the battle. He was whimpering and could barely walk. He had large bruises in his arms and was clutching on to a piece of dragon stone. The other Northerners in the back claimed to have heard a noise. It was a crashing sound that echoed through the halls of the tunnel. Out of curiosity two of the Northerners stopped and starred at the back end of the tunnel. They shone their torch at it but failed to illuminate the dark passageway. They couldn\u2019t see anything thats possibly making the sound so they turned back to try and catch up with the others.</p><p>A few minutes later, the two men noticed something. They were too far away from the others but they were hearing stepping sounds coming toward them. They shone the lamp once more. Finally they sight something, something they rather had wished wasn\u2019t there. It was a woman, her clothes were in tatters covered in dirt and her hair black and long it draped over her face. She was just standing there with her back against the wall. They couldn\u2019t see her face, she had her head down the whole time, so the men started talking to her but no answer came. The two decided to take steps back frightened by how just the thought of how a wight have managed to wander in a place like this. The woman raises her head. Revealing two eyes closed and a face resembling that of a corpse. The two Northerners  let out gasps and were shaking vigorously that the man holding the torch almost drops it. She opened her eyes. They were cold, dead and blue. </p></p>",

Regardless of direction, they were brought further and further into the North. But the dragons were also tired, their wings could barely fly anymore and were gradually sinking to the ground leaving the misty clouds and crashing to the trees. The two awoke immediately when the feeling of flying suddenly shifted into falling and crashing. She halted Drogon and Rhaegal and have decided to camp there for the night. Jon gathered some wood to set a fire. The weakened Rhaegal was kind enough to light up the firewood to keep them warm. They huddled around the campfire. Drogon shielded Daenerys with his wing to protect her from the cold. Soon everyone was asleep except for Jon who was sitting at a log and was calmly staring at the fire. He watched the fire eat all the bits and pieces of the wood, burning them to a crisp and then disappearing into smoke. He was worried about what would happen to Bran. He finally got to meet him all this years after waking from a coma and then another tragedy has taken him away from his family again. He doesn&rsquo;t know the Night King&rsquo;s plan for Bran or if his sisters are alive which made him worry even more. He looked at Dany, she was calm and sleeping like a child under the dragon&rsquo;s wing.  The forest was quiet and only the sound of fire was breaking its silence. But not even the most quiet and tranquil of nights could put him to sleep after what he has experienced.</p><p>The people kept walking in the tunnel. Gendry who was already being weighed down by his heavy hammer was helping assist Sam who was trampled on by wights during the battle. He was whimpering and could barely walk. He had large bruises in his arms and was clutching on to a piece of dragon stone. The other Northerners in the back claimed to have heard a noise. It was a crashing sound that echoed through the halls of the tunnel. Out of curiosity two of the Northerners stopped and starred at the back end of the tunnel. They shone their torch at it but failed to illuminate the dark passageway. They couldn&rsquo;t see anything thats possibly making the sound so they turned back to try and catch up with the others.</p><p>A few minutes later, the two men noticed something. They were too far away from the others but they were hearing stepping sounds coming toward them. They shone the lamp once more. Finally they sight something, something they rather had wished wasn&rsquo;t there. It was a woman, her clothes were in tatters covered in dirt and her hair black and long it draped over her face. She was just standing there with her back against the wall. They couldn&rsquo;t see her face, she had her head down the whole time, so the men started talking to her but no answer came. The two decided to take steps back frightened by how just the thought of how a wight have managed to wander in a place like this. The woman raises her head. Revealing two eyes closed and a face resembling that of a corpse. The two Northerners  let out gasps and were shaking vigorously that the man holding the torch almost drops it. She opened her eyes. They were cold, dead and blue. </p></p>",

Martin</a>\u2018s <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> and watch HBO\u2019s <em>Game of Thrones</em>, both series. It only seemed right, then, that I finish off my \u201cYear of Thrones\u201d with Season 8, even though it is well after my year ended.</p>\n<p><strong>Why I Chose it:</strong> I had tried watching the series a few times and only ever reached the half-way point of the first season. Then I was in Calgary visiting my friend, and she wanted to watch <em>Game of Thrones</em>. I was curious to see it, and it was fantastic. I had to know everything that happened. But I\u2019m not just satisfied with the TV show. I love to know all the details from the books too. I expect this is going to be a momentous task, and I hope I\u2019m up for the challenge.</p>\n<p>If you haven\u2019t seen the series, <strong>there will be spoilers</strong> as we go along. If you have seen it, I\u2019d love to hear what you think in the comments.</p>\n\n<p>Episode 1 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5924366/?ref_=ttep_ep1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Winterfell</a></p>\n<p>This was a decent set-up for what\u2019s to come. Bran is just weird and cryptic, which is annoying but fine. I thought too much time was spent with Jon and Danaerys flying the dragons. I know the point was to emphasize to us that Jon is a Targaryen because only Targaryens can fly dragons. Given there are only six episodes in this season, every second counts and this could have been shortened. However, I did enjoy that when Jon and Dany are kissing, Drogon (I think? I could never keep them straight) growls like a dog protecting his mama.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"20858\" data-permalink=\"http://speculativechic.com/2019/05/29/a-year-of-thrones-game-of-thrones-season-8/episode-1-1/\" data-orig-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Episode-1.1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1777,999\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Episode 1.1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Episode-1.1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Episode-1.1.jpg?w=676\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-20858\" src=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Episode-1.1-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\"/></p>\n<p>Two other points on this episode. That bit with Lord Umber at the end, when he\u2019s been killed and then he wakes up as a wight and screams, was amazing and horrifying. I really want to know what the symbols mean! The other is that I liked the encounter between Bran and Jaime. It just kind of brought them full circle, though there really wasn\u2019t anywhere it could go.</p>\n<p>Episode 2 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6027908/?ref_=tt_ep_nx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms</a></p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"20857\" data-permalink=\"http://speculativechic.com/2019/05/29/a-year-of-thrones-game-of-thrones-season-8/episode-2-1/\" data-orig-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Episode-2.1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1280,738\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Episode 2.1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Episode-2.1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Episode-2.1.jpg?w=676\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-20857\" src=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Episode-2.1-300x173.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"346\"/></p>\n<p>Apparently obsidian can be melted and reformed into weapons. That\u2019s a fun thing to know. Magic, I guess? A preparation episode was inevitable when you\u2019re gearing up for a battle with the undead. I kind of liked the reminiscing. I felt their anxiety, their anticipation that they may not make it through. I would love to know what Bran and Tyrion talked about, though given what happens in future episodes, it appears they didn\u2019t talk at all.</p>\n<p>I was most disappointed that Arya and Gendry slept together. I saw it coming, but I\u2019m still disappointed. Arya\u2019s warrior-ness, her disinterest in sex, set her apart from everyone, and now she\u2019s no different from anyone else.</p>\n<p>Episode 3 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6027912/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Long Night</a></p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"20856\" data-permalink=\"http://speculativechic.com/2019/05/29/a-year-of-thrones-game-of-thrones-season-8/episode3-1/\" data-orig-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Episode3.1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1500,1000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Episode3.1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Episode3.1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Episode3.1.jpg?w=676\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-20856 alignleft\" src=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Episode3.1-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\"/>I don\u2019t even know where to begin with this one. I wish I had something new to say, but I\u2019m pretty sure my complaints are the same as everyone else\u2019s. And there is a lot to complain about. My biggest problem is with Bran. I totally blame the writers for this. He separates himself from everyone else and goes to the Godswood to lure the Night King. There are two dragons in Winterfell, but Bran wargs up into a raven, basically to say \u201chey\u201d to the Night King, and that\u2019s it. The rest of the episode, he\u2019s in the Godswood while everyone around him dies trying to protect him. He didn\u2019t lure the Night King anywhere. Instead of using his magic to be useful, the writers chose to do nothing with it.</p>\n<p>The whole episode was reminiscent, or maybe more of a rip-off, of the Battle of Helms Deep in <em><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167261/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</a></em>. Right down to the women and children huddling below while the terror of battle happens above. Though, really, was putting them in the crypts with the bones of the deceased really the best idea when Jon knew the Night King had the ability to raise them?</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"20855\" data-permalink=\"http://speculativechic.com/2019/05/29/a-year-of-thrones-game-of-thrones-season-8/episode-3-2/\" data-orig-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Episode-3.2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1777,999\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Episode 3.2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Episode-3.2.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Episode-3.2.jpg?w=676\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-20855 alignright\" src=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Episode-3.2-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\"/>All of that aside, I did like that the Hound overcame his fear of fire to save Arya. Those two have an interesting dynamic. I did like that Arya killed the Night King. She did serve the god of death for some time, so maybe it was fitting. I didn\u2019t expect it, and I don\u2019t agree with them killing the Night King in Episode 3. But I did like that it was Arya who killed him.</p>\n<p>Episode 4 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6027914/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Last of the Starks</a></p>\n<p>I could go on about all the bad decisions made in this episode, but my overwhelming thought was: Fuck the Patriarchy! I absolutely hate that Dany is now being portrayed as unstable, unsuitable, irrational, that she shouldn\u2019t be Queen. Tyrion, Jorah, and Varys have all stood by her, believing her to be the best leader for the Seven Kingdoms.

I was as excited as everyone else to watch it. I\u2019d read the books, I\u2019d watched every episode. I\u2019d taken a university class on <em>Game of Thrones</em>. I had co-workers I could talk to about the show. We seem to have formed a bit of a lunch-club around our discussions. I\u2019ll admit, it was weird not to be able to binge an entire season in a weekend. I think that made it easier to recover, but I also think it gave me too much time to analyze.</p>\n<p>Season 8 was a season of missed opportunities and lazy writing. I don\u2019t think David Benioff or D.B. Weiss, or any of the other writers, knew what to do with the elements of magic, as few and far between as they already are, and so for the last few seasons have done their best to eliminate them, and in doing so, couldn\u2019t see what could have been. Instead, they opted for action and epic battle scenes with extra blood and gore, just because.</p>\n<p>I couldn\u2019t cover everything, and I think I\u2019m still processing.

Then I was in Calgary visiting my friend, and she wanted to watch <em>Game of Thrones</em>. I was curious to see it, and it was fantastic. I had to know everything that happened.

Given there are only six episodes in this season, every second counts and this could have been shortened. However, I did enjoy that when Jon and Dany are kissing, Drogon (I think?

I totally blame the writers for this. He separates himself from everyone else and goes to the Godswood to lure the Night King. There are two dragons in Winterfell, but Bran wargs up into a raven, basically to say \u201chey\u201d to the Night King, and that\u2019s it. The rest of the episode, he\u2019s in the Godswood while everyone around him dies trying to protect him. He didn\u2019t lure the Night King anywhere.

Those two have an interesting dynamic. I did like that Arya killed the Night King. She did serve the god of death for some time, so maybe it was fitting. I didn\u2019t expect it, and I don\u2019t agree with them killing the Night King in Episode 3.

I think they just didn\u2019t know what to do with her and so they decided to make her go crazy so they wouldn\u2019t have to have a woman on the throne.

Given that Targaryens marry family, I\u2019m not as surprised by her lack of concern in this, though she has been away from her family culture for several years by this point, so it ought to seem a little off.

I had co-workers I could talk to about the show. We seem to have formed a bit of a lunch-club around our discussions. I\u2019ll admit, it was weird not to be able to binge an entire season in a weekend. I think that made it easier to recover, but I also think it gave me too much time to analyze.</p>\n<p>Season 8 was a season of missed opportunities and lazy writing. I don\u2019t think David Benioff or D.B. Weiss, or any of the other writers, knew what to do with the elements of magic, as few and far between as they already are, and so for the last few seasons have done their best to eliminate them, and in doing so, couldn\u2019t see what could have been. Instead, they opted for action and epic battle scenes with extra blood and gore, just because.</p>\n<p>I couldn\u2019t cover everything, and I think I\u2019m still processing.

Given there are only six episodes in this season, every second counts and this could have been shortened. However, I did enjoy that when Jon and Dany are kissing, Drogon (I think? I could never keep them straight) growls like a dog protecting his mama.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"20858\" data-permalink=\"http://speculativechic.com/2019/05/29/a-year-of-thrones-game-of-thrones-season-8/episode-1-1/\" data-orig-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Episode-1.1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1777,999\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Episode 1.1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Episode-1.1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Episode-1.1.jpg?w=676\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-20858\" src=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Episode-1.1-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\"></p>\n<p>Two other points on this episode.

That\u2019s a fun thing to know. Magic, I guess? A preparation episode was inevitable when you\u2019re gearing up for a battle with the undead. I kind of liked the reminiscing. I felt their anxiety, their anticipation that they may not make it through. I would love to know what Bran and Tyrion talked about, though given what happens in future episodes, it appears they didn\u2019t talk at all.</p>\n<p>I was most disappointed that Arya and Gendry slept together. I saw it coming, but I\u2019m still disappointed.

I wish I had something new to say, but I\u2019m pretty sure my complaints are the same as everyone else\u2019s. And there is a lot to complain about. My biggest problem is with Bran. I totally blame the writers for this. He separates himself from everyone else and goes to the Godswood to lure the Night King. There are two dragons in Winterfell, but Bran wargs up into a raven, basically to say \u201chey\u201d to the Night King, and that\u2019s it. The rest of the episode, he\u2019s in the Godswood while everyone around him dies trying to protect him. He didn\u2019t lure the Night King anywhere. Instead of using his magic to be useful, the writers chose to do nothing with it.</p>\n<p>The whole episode was reminiscent, or maybe more of a rip-off, of the Battle of Helms Deep in <em><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167261/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</a></em>.

Those two have an interesting dynamic. I did like that Arya killed the Night King. She did serve the god of death for some time, so maybe it was fitting.

I absolutely hate that Dany is now being portrayed as unstable, unsuitable, irrational, that she shouldn\u2019t be Queen.

I think they just didn\u2019t know what to do with her and so they decided to make her go crazy so they wouldn\u2019t have to have a woman on the throne.

Given that Targaryens marry family, I\u2019m not as surprised by her lack of concern in this, though she has been away from her family culture for several years by this point, so it ought to seem a little off.

I expect this is going to be a momentous task, and I hope I&rsquo;m up for the challenge.</p>\n<p>If you haven&rsquo;t seen the series, <strong>there will be spoilers</strong> as we go along. If you have seen it, I&rsquo;d love to hear what you think in the comments.</p>\n\n<p>Episode 1 &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5924366/?ref_=ttep_ep1\" target=\"_blank\">Winterfell</a></p>\n<p>This was a decent set-up for what&rsquo;s to come. Bran is just weird and cryptic, which is annoying but fine. I thought too much time was spent with Jon and Danaerys flying the dragons. I know the point was to emphasize to us that Jon is a Targaryen because only Targaryens can fly dragons. Given there are only six episodes in this season, every second counts and this could have been shortened. However, I did enjoy that when Jon and Dany are kissing, Drogon (I think? I could never keep them straight) growls like a dog protecting his mama.</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Episode-1.1-300x169.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>Two other points on this episode. That bit with Lord Umber at the end, when he&rsquo;s been killed and then he wakes up as a wight and screams, was amazing and horrifying. I really want to know what the symbols mean! The other is that I liked the encounter between Bran and Jaime. It just kind of brought them full circle, though there really wasn&rsquo;t anywhere it could go.</p>\n<p>Episode 2 &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6027908/?ref_=tt_ep_nx\" target=\"_blank\">A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms</a></p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Episode-2.1-300x173.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>Apparently obsidian can be melted and reformed into weapons. That&rsquo;s a fun thing to know. Magic, I guess? A preparation episode was inevitable when you&rsquo;re gearing up for a battle with the undead. I kind of liked the reminiscing. I felt their anxiety, their anticipation that they may not make it through. I would love to know what Bran and Tyrion talked about, though given what happens in future episodes, it appears they didn&rsquo;t talk at all.</p>\n<p>I was most disappointed that Arya and Gendry slept together. I saw it coming, but I&rsquo;m still disappointed. Arya&rsquo;s warrior-ness, her disinterest in sex, set her apart from everyone, and now she&rsquo;s no different from anyone else.</p>\n<p>Episode 3 &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6027912/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis\" target=\"_blank\">The Long Night</a></p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Episode3.1-300x200.jpg\">External image</div>I don&rsquo;t even know where to begin with this one. I wish I had something new to say, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure my complaints are the same as everyone else&rsquo;s. And there is a lot to complain about. My biggest problem is with Bran. I totally blame the writers for this. He separates himself from everyone else and goes to the Godswood to lure the Night King. There are two dragons in Winterfell, but Bran wargs up into a raven, basically to say &ldquo;hey&rdquo; to the Night King, and that&rsquo;s it. The rest of the episode, he&rsquo;s in the Godswood while everyone around him dies trying to protect him. He didn&rsquo;t lure the Night King anywhere. Instead of using his magic to be useful, the writers chose to do nothing with it.</p>\n<p>The whole episode was reminiscent, or maybe more of a rip-off, of the Battle of Helms Deep in <em><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167261/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1\" target=\"_blank\">The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</a></em>. Right down to the women and children huddling below while the terror of battle happens above. Though, really, was putting them in the crypts with the bones of the deceased really the best idea when Jon knew the Night King had the ability to raise them?</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Episode-3.2-300x169.jpg\">External image</div>All of that aside, I did like that the Hound overcame his fear of fire to save Arya. Those two have an interesting dynamic. I did like that Arya killed the Night King. She did serve the god of death for some time, so maybe it was fitting. I didn&rsquo;t expect it, and I don&rsquo;t agree with them killing the Night King in Episode 3. But I did like that it was Arya who killed him.</p>\n<p>Episode 4 &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6027914/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis\" target=\"_blank\">The Last of the Starks</a></p>\n<p>I could go on about all the bad decisions made in this episode, but my overwhelming thought was: Fuck the Patriarchy! I absolutely hate that Dany is now being portrayed as unstable, unsuitable, irrational, that she shouldn&rsquo;t be Queen. Tyrion, Jorah, and Varys have all stood by her, believing her to be the best leader for the Seven Kingdoms. But oh no, now there&rsquo;s a male, so let&rsquo;s make the woman crazy.</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Episode-4.2-300x169.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>You could justify this decision by saying that it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;ve been saying all along that she isn&rsquo;t like her father that of course they would inevitably make her the &ldquo;Mad Queen,&rdquo; or you could say that there is something in the water in Westeros that makes Targaryens mad. I think they just didn&rsquo;t know what to do with her and so they decided to make her go crazy so they wouldn&rsquo;t have to have a woman on the throne. The writers had already done it with Cersei, who, by the way, has done nothing a male leader hadn&rsquo;t done before her and been praised for it.</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Episode-4.1-300x169.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>I will say that I found it amusing that when Jon tells Dany that he&rsquo;s really Aegon Targaryen, I found it interesting that her only concern is that he has a better claim to the throne, not that he&rsquo;s her nephew. Given that Targaryens marry family, I&rsquo;m not as surprised by her lack of concern in this, though she has been away from her family culture for several years by this point, so it ought to seem a little off. But given that Jon grew up a Stark, I&rsquo;d have thought this would have weighed a little more on him. Maybe not. Maybe knowing he&rsquo;s a Targaryen he&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Ah, well, it&rsquo;s all right that I&rsquo;m in love with my aunt. I&rsquo;m not a Stark any more.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Episode 5 &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6027916/?ref_=tt_ep_nx\" target=\"_blank\">The Bells</a></p>\n<p>This episode really should have been titled &ldquo;Dracarys.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Episode-5.2-300x167.jpg\">External image</div>I know everyone is upset that Dany burned the entirety of King&rsquo;s Landing. I&rsquo;m not. It was what the writers were leading up to, and since they already threw everything off and have gone the easiest route with the storytelling, it was inevitable. And given that I&rsquo;m still very much thinking Fuck the Patriarchy, given what they&rsquo;re doing to Dany, and the current political situation in real life, I kind of feel like all of us women are ready to burn everything down too.</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Episode5.1-300x169.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>The thing is, it was an easy way for the writers to justify getting rid of Dany, removing any remaining fans who wanted to see her on the throne because they thought she belonged on it. You can&rsquo;t cheer for anyone who commits genocide. It was just a cheap way of doing it. Had they taken a season or two to get us there, to slowly show her character change into madness, even a few more episodes of the impact of having lost everything and everyone she loved could have brought the audience along to at least saying she did it because&hellip;</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Episode-5.3-300x201.jpg\">External image</div>I did like that the Hound finally convinced Arya to not be so filled with hatred, so we got to see a little softness, a little bit of humanity, return to her. But again, it happened so fast. And I&rsquo;m kind of disappointed she didn&rsquo;t get to finish her kill list. And what the fuck was up with the white horse?</p>\n<p>Episode 6 &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6027920/?ref_=tt_ep_nx\" target=\"_blank\">The Iron Throne</a></p>\n<p>I was surprised, and not surprised, at this. In talking to some co-workers about <em>Game of Thrones</em> a few weeks before this episode aired, I said that Jon was going to go North and be with Ghost. There was no way Dany could sit on the throne, but at least she got to see it. I liked the dragon melting the Iron Throne, though given Jon&rsquo;s proximity to it at the time, how did he not get incinerated at the same time?</p>\n    <div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"http://i0.wp.com/speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Episode-6.1.jpg?w=332&amp;h=187\">External image</div>      <div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"http://i0.wp.com/speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Episode-6.3.jpg?w=336&amp;h=187\">External image</div>      \n<p>Sansa as Queen of the North made sense. One of my co-workers wanted Sansa to be made Queen of Westeros, so I guess this was a good compromise. But Bran as King? Are you fucking kidding me? He may be all-knowing now, but he doesn&rsquo;t tell anyone anything! At best he should be a Maester in the Citadel. Tyrion as Hand makes sense. I thought he should be made king, and he kind of is, because let&rsquo;s face it, Bran isn&rsquo;t going to make any decisions. In fact, he gets wheeled into the Small Council, asks about the whereabouts of Drogon, then leaves to go warging to find him. Why? Why is he concerning himself with the dragon, when he should be rebuilding the kingdom?</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Episode-6.2-300x168.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<h2>General Thoughts</h2>\n<p>This was the first time I was watching the series with everyone else. I was as excited as everyone else to watch it. I&rsquo;d read the books, I&rsquo;d watched every episode. I&rsquo;d taken a university class on <em>Game of Thrones</em>. I had co-workers I could talk to about the show. We seem to have formed a bit of a lunch-club around our discussions. I&rsquo;ll admit, it was weird not to be able to binge an entire season in a weekend. I think that made it easier to recover, but I also think it gave me too much time to analyze.</p>\n<p>Season 8 was a season of missed opportunities and lazy writing. I don&rsquo;t think David Benioff or D.B. Weiss, or any of the other writers, knew what to do with the elements of magic, as few and far between as they already are, and so for the last few seasons have done their best to eliminate them, and in doing so, couldn&rsquo;t see what could have been. Instead, they opted for action and epic battle scenes with extra blood and gore, just because.</p>\n<p>I couldn&rsquo;t cover everything, and I think I&rsquo;m still processing. Did I miss something you loved, or hated? Let&rsquo;s talk season 8!</p>\n<a href=\"http://speculativechic.com/2019/05/29/a-year-of-thrones-game-of-thrones-season-8/\">A Year of Thrones: Game of Thrones, Season&nbsp;8</a>\n\nIn 2018&nbsp;I resolved to read&nbsp;George R.R.
