None of his depth was explored and he was left as a plot device. </p><p>It hurts me that show watchers actually were made to believe Jon ever considered any place other than Winterfell home or that he would truly be happy with the Night\u2019s Watch or the free folk. Bookwise it\u2019s clear he\u2019s not, even as he makes friends and respects some of these people. But they had watered him down so much that by the end the fact that he had his direwolf and Tormund was considered his bestfriend took away from the fact that Jon was driven away again from the place where he wanted to belong.

                "content": "<p>Apart from fanservice for Jon/Dany and fear of backlash from Dany stans that played into the sidelining, blocking of POV and ooc writing of Jon, D&amp;D really tried to cut off Jon&rsquo;s interactions with the Starks and made it seem like he didn&rsquo;t care about Sansa most of the season mostly for their finale twist.&nbsp;</p><p>Like the season 7 Winterhell plot, they really wanted to make it seem like Jon could possibly choose Dany over Sansa and the Starks although the anyone who knows his character knows the choice would be obvious. He would always choose Sansa over her - even if just platonically - because he would always choose the Starks. And part of the whole&nbsp;&ldquo;bending the knee&rdquo; bullshit was to play into that idea too - while blocking out his POV and sidelining him.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, by the finale, the context of Jon&rsquo;s behaviour contradicted his behaviour in the previous episode to make him feel more conflicted about it than he would be after witnessing that mass murder. He followed her out of fear but all of a sudden, he believed in her to break the fourth wall to contain backlash and also to make it seem like he could go the other way. Sadly, like the Winterhell plot, it came at the price of watering down his character to the point where he was a shell of himself. They didn&rsquo;t just dumb him down. They robbed him of his moral <i>integrity</i> for this highly predictable twist. A choice that should&rsquo;ve been a lot more poignant got lost in trying appease Dany stans&rsquo; backlash and in romanticising Dany&rsquo;s death more than it needed to be.&nbsp;</p><p>All it did was make people hate him and make him a laughing stock when he was actually treated the worst in the season for supposedly being a main.

There was no one in the North left alive who had not lost someone during everything that had happened after King Robert Baratheon had arrived here at Winterfell. The Lannister Army, the Iron fleet, the Boltons, the Army of the Death, they had all taken lives of people who had been fighting for the North and the Kings they believed in.

But it would still lead to more scars and more empty places at the dinner table. And she wanted the people to know that despite everything she felt and needed herself, their safety and wellbeing would always be her priority.</p><p>Once she had encouraged everyone that the North was in good hands in her absence and that she wouldn&rsquo;t be gone for too long, she crossed the courtyard and entered the crypt.</p><p>As a kid she had never quite liked this place, where the death felt too near and the air felt too musty. And all the horrors she had witnessed when the Night King had raised the death from their tombs were sometimes still haunting her in the middle of the night. But this was also the place where she could be the closest to her parents and the siblings she had lost.</p><p>It had been one of the first things she had done after she had been crowned Queen. </p><p>All the statues that had been heavily damaged during the battle, among which the ones of her father and her aunt Lyanna, had been restored to their former glory. Her little brother Rickon, who had only been buried here but had never gotten a statue of his own, was now smiling at her whenever she entered. And even her mother and brother, although their remeins were gone and lost forever, had gotten the honour they deserved after everything they had been through and had done for the North. And even though this meant some traditional rules were at the very least stretched, no one had complained or protested when she had given the order.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to say that I will not visit during the upcoming two months, mother.&rdquo; Sansa bent her hand when she halted in front of Catelyn&rsquo;s statue. &ldquo;I will be visiting Jon.&rdquo; She softened her voice when she said his name out loud.</p><p>The journey from Winterfell to Castle Black would most likely take about three weeks and she would also need three weeks to get back. Her time with Jon was limited to one or maybe two weeks if they were lucky. But it would have to be enough for a while. It would have to be enough until Bran knew for sure that pardoning Jon wouldn&rsquo;t enrage what was left of Daenerys&rsquo; army anymore.</p><p>&ldquo;I wish you had known that he was not a bastard and that father has never betrayed you.&rdquo; Sansa stretched out her hand and the tips of her fingers touched the rough stone. &ldquo;Maybe you would have been able to love him, just like I do.&rdquo; Sansa smiled. &ldquo;He is everything I always wanted my husband to be.
