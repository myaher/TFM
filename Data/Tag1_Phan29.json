What if his hair was the source of his power, like some weird modern day Samson? </p><p>Dan kept telling him he would and did look great with a quiff, and even if he got one bad haircut, it wasn\u2019t the end of the world, hair grew back and people wouldn\u2019t stop watching him over that. But Phil still worried. He knew it wasn\u2019t entirely rational, but his appearance played a key role in his job, and he did depend financially on people watching his videos and buying his merch.</p><p>So he eased into it. </p><p>He kept the fringe for videos and public appearances, but he started wearing it differently at home. Just to try it out. He styled it out of his forehead and tried giving it some volume, and it worked out pretty well. He liked it. He liked that he had both options open, either leaving the fringe down or styling it up into a quiff. It felt safer than jumping off the deep end with a more radical change he might regret and then would be stuck having to deal with. </p><p>It turned out to be the right choice, because wearing his hair up in a quiff sometimes turned into wearing it into a quiff all the time off-camera, which got him so accustomed to it that it started to feel natural, and styling it down into the fringe started to feel weird and contrived. It made the final step - finally getting a haircut specifically to wear as a quiff - feel organic and right, a small step rather than the extremely radical change it had felt like at the beginning. </p><p>And his viewers actually liked it! It was a relief, as he couldn\u2019t imagine going back at that point.</p><p>He was even more pleased to find out that Dan really, <i>really</i> liked it.</p><p>*</p><p>Dan had liked it when Phil started wearing his hair differently around the house. He hadn&rsquo;t made a big deal out of it, because he knew Phil and his anxiety intimately well by now, and he was a sweetheart who overthought everything and would never purposefully make another person self-conscious, least of all his favourite person in the world, so he played it cool. He did comment on how he liked it, and Phil caught him staring a few times, but when caught Dan just smiled at him, or gave him one of those cheeky suggestive grins that always got under Phil\u2019s skin in the best of ways, or he complimented Phil\u2019s shiny pale forehead (this happened several times, the dork). </p><p>As it got more and more common for Phil to wear his hair in a quiff, Dan started bringing up the subject, always full of patience and understanding, always encouraging. Well, almost always, Dan was only human and he had bad days, too. Phil had fond memories of the one time Dan had been so done with him for wanting to change his hair but being too scared to actually do it that he\u2019d resorted to pontificating about how great Phil looked, how could he think anyone wouldn\u2019t like it, he was so fit, what was he thinking, and so on.\n\n It had ended up with Dan pushing him down to sit on his lap, slipping one of his hands down into his pants and pumping his cock fast and hard while he told him just how much he liked various physical attributes of his in a low, sultry voice and watched him come apart under his ministrations. \n\nHe hadn\u2019t let Phil kiss him while he did it because he wanted to watch him, he\u2019d said. And he had. Watched. Intently.\n\n\n\n </p><p>It hadn\u2019t really undone the knot of anxiety in his head, but it had helped.</p><p>And it made for a lovely fantasy to come back to when they were apart.</p><p>*</p><p>Eventually, it happened, right in the middle of the exhausting preparations for their second tour, Phil made the decision to cut his hair. Not just wear it up, but actually get a haircut specifically to wear as a quiff. He was pretty happy with the results.</p><p>He posted a picture online, and it was a roaring success, which calmed the worries that persisted in the back of his mind, and just like that, it was done. </p><p>*</p><p>It was only a few weeks after his haircut, they had carved out a full hour and a half to relax and do nothing after dinner, maybe watch a movie before they had to turn in to get enough sleep to hopefully fuel them through another intense 12-hour workday of setting up, rehearsing and fine-tuning the show, not to mention making far too many little decisions about literally everything. People didn\u2019t talk enough about how exhausting it was to make decisions constantly, and these were decisions that would shape their show, which they had been working on for so long and wanted so bad to make the best they could. Phil was grateful every day that Dan was right there alongside him, he didn\u2019t think he could be doing this alone. </p><p>\n\nIt had been a good day, despite the tiredness wearing down on them both. They\u2019d been vlogging all week for a video that they\u2019d be posting some time the following week to promote the show, and even though there was still a lot to get done, it seemed the worst of it was behind them and this huge project of theirs was actually going to work out fine after all. Dan was no longer feeling (too) overwhelmed by it, and Phil had officially crossed the threshold from scared to excited.\n\n</p><p>\n\n Of course, despite plans to relax and put work aside for the evening, they really couldn\u2019t help themselves from talking about it. They ended up lounging in their living room sofa and shuffling around ideas and expectations, their hopes and fears for the coming tour.\n\n</p><p>\n\n \n\n Phil was babbling, jumping from subject to subject as he often did, going through different details from parts of the show and laying out his thoughts in a jumble that would be hard for someone who wasn\u2019t familiar with him to follow. He never had to make an effort to spell out his thoughts for Dan, he\u2019d been able to follow Phil\u2019s ramblings almost from day one. As it was, Phil was caught up enough on his own train of thought, and his excitement for the coming months, that it took him a while to notice the way Dan was staring at him.\n\n\n\n </p><p>Dan stared at him all the time, of course. It had stopped being something that made him feel embarrassed or self-conscious years ago, although it still caught him off guard sometimes. It still made him blush sometimes, made him want to hide his face behind whatever was at hand, bashful even after all these years. But that was rare. Mostly it filled him with a slow, treacly feeling of warmth; it made his chest coil and his stomach flutter. </p><p>Dan had always spent an inordinate amount of time looking at him, yes, but ever since Phil had finally decided to cut his hair a few weeks ago, it had become ridiculous. Dan was ridiculous, staring at him like that, with such painfully obvious affection that it made Phil bashful. Dan, this breathtakingly beautiful man, with his warm eyes and soft, puffy lips, and his lovely cheek \u201cdeficiencies\u201d; Dan, who could charm anyone, who had a way of drawing eyes wherever he went; Dan, who at 26 was every bit as irresistible to Phil as he had been as a gorgeous, nervous teen taking a wild chance. This Dan, Phil\u2019s Dan, had never quite broken the habit of staring at Phil, but lately it was less like he was indulging in it and more like he physically couldn\u2019t stop himself. </p><p>Phil raised an eyebrow at him. </p><p>Then raised the other one. </p><p>Then he waggled them.</p><p>Dan burst out laughing. <i>Success!</i>, though Phil triumphantly.</p><p>\u201cYou really like it this much?\u201d Phil asked, running a hand through his hair. </p><p>He was expecting a \u201cyes\u201d. He was expecting a heated look, a flirtatious remark, a teasing touch. Maybe a kiss.</p><p>Instead, Dan held his gaze, tender, enamoured, and softly said, \u201cI like <i>you</i>.\u201d </p><p>It wasn\u2019t often these days that Dan could make him blush. But it still happened sometimes.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>The stubble</b></h2><p>He\u2019d been thinking about it for ages. </p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d like it, could he even pull it off? He <i>was </i>curious. </p><p>He liked how he looked clean-shaven, so he\u2019d probably not change his everyday look. But it <i>would </i>be nice to feel comfortable with not shaving when he was really busy (or really lazy). </p><p>\n\n If he was being honest, he was more worried about what his audience would think of it, he knew how much they can dislike change. And he often wonders if all of them would still watch him if the professional lights and carefully chosen camera angles didn\u2019t make him look younger.\n\n </p><p>Less pressing but even more important to him was the question of what Dan would think of it. Phil knows Dan would never ask him to change something about himself, but if Dan didn\u2019t like it there was no way in hell that Phil would want to keep it. Some might say that was unhealthy, or wrong, or inadvisable, but Phil didn\u2019t care about any of that. He\u2019d been shaving this long, and he liked how he looked without facial hair, to continue shaving would be no hardship and he still, after all these years, wanted to look good for his partner. If Dan had a preference, Phil would want to indulge him. They were both like that. </p><p>Phil smiled a secret little smile whenever he was reminded of a much younger Dan grudgingly giving his natural curls free reign as a gift to Phil on certain special occasions - or sometimes just because. Just because \u201cI love you\u201d. Just because \u201cI like to spoil you\u201d. Just because \u201cI know how much you enjoy it, you weirdo,\u201d said with a happy, dimpled smile and soft eyes that always made Phil melt, without exception. \u00a0</p><p>So if Dan didn\u2019t like it, he\u2019d most likely scrap it. If his audience didn\u2019t like it\u2026 well, he\u2019d have to be careful to shave before videos and liveshows and any kind of public appearance (not that there were many of those, thank god, he\u2019d got a better handle on his anxiety over the years, but it could still be exhausting). But he was still curious to try it out. He\u2019d been turning it over in his head for ages before he finally made the decision. </p><p>*</p><p>As it turns out, he needn\u2019t have worried.</p><p>Dan liked it. </p><p>Not just liked it, but <i>liked </i>it. </p><p>The first day he forewent shaving yielded no visible results and so life went on as normal.</p><p>The second day it just looked like barely there five o\u2019clock shadow, and them making out lazily on the sofa had somehow devolved into Dan rubbing his own cheek against Phil\u2019s because he said he liked the feeling. It had made Phil laugh, amused, yeah, but also happy that he had a person, that he had <i>this specific person</i>, who he was so close with that they could be weird and silly together without a care in the world. They could do and say bizarre or absurd things and trust that the other would just go with it, maybe they\u2019d have to endure some light-hearted teasing for it, but even that felt like a blessing most days. Dan always looked so fond when he poked fun at him.</p><p>The third day, there was the beginnings of visible stubble, but they were so busy that Phil actually mostly forgot about it, focused as he was on everything they had to get done, and by the time they were finished they were both so exhausted they just collapsed in bed and went directly to sleep.</p><p>The fourth day, though. The fourth day was. Eventful.</p><p>Phil woke up first, to his slight disappointment, and he got up to the siren song of the coffeemaker resonating through his veins. </p><p>He was on his second cup when Dan joined him, looking sleep soft and ruffled in his oversized t-shirt and fuzzy slippers, long legs bare to the slightly chill air of the morning.</p><p>Phil did not get to <i>finish </i>his second cup of coffee that morning.</p><p>He was very much okay with that. </p><p>Having a sleepy Dan burrow into his arms and leaving soft kisses all over his jaw that turned to playful nips that turned to Dan grabbing his face to lick into his mouth was a very nice way to start the day, and you would hear no complaints from Phil about it.</p><p>Phil, distracted by Dan\u2019s pretty lips and big, clever hands and still only about 36% awake, failed to connect the dots until after Dan had peeled most of Phil\u2019s clothes off him, hands running over Phil\u2019s bare chest, and had gone back to bite his jaw. </p><p>Dan liked his jaw, but he didn\u2019t normally give it this much attention.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\n\n \u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Dan hummed, causing vibrations to travel up the side of his face he was nibbling on, then licked a stripe up his neck, all the way to his chin. It should have been weird, but Phil had never concerned himself with weird when something felt good, and Dan\u2019s tongue on him felt fantastic. \u201cI want to feel the scratch all over,\u201d Dan said softly into his cheek. The words suddenly opened up a whole new genre of fantasies in Phil\u2019s mind. Dan\u2019s effect on him had always been remarkable.\n\n </p><p>Dan was back to kissing him before Phil recovered from this revelation, sucking gently on his tongue one second and biting on his bottom lip the next, exactly as hard as Phil liked it, one hand running down his spine, slow but with intent, tracing the curve of his ass and squeezing. Phil let out a soft moan and rubbed up against him, chest bare against Dan\u2019s thin t-shirt. They had moved automatically to line up their cocks together as they kissed against the kitchen counter, so in tune with each other\u2019s bodies after all these years, and Phil could feel Dan hardening against him. He loved that, had always loved that, there was something so intimate about being able to track his partner\u2019s desire this way, to get to partake in the experience with them.</p><p>Dan dragged his mouth down to his neck, wet and sloppy and leaving a burning trail with his tongue, and he <i>sucked</i>, hard enough that Phil wasn\u2019t sure he wouldn\u2019t leave a mark, teeth grazing the sensitive flesh and making Phil\u2019s knees weak. And as he did this, he moved the hand grabbing one of his asscheeks possessively down to Phil\u2019s thigh and lifted it until Phil instinctively wrapped it around him, and he moved his hips in maddening tight little circles that were shooting sparks under his skin, and Phil wanted to touch skin, wanted it <i>now</i>, so he grabbed a handful of oversized t-shirt and pulled, and pulled, until the fabric had bunched up in between their chests, and Phil could feel the soft skin of Dan\u2019s bare stomach against his own, and Dan\u2019s bare cock rubbing against Phil\u2019s where it was still trapped in his pants. Phil was whining a little, the combination of Dan\u2019s far too clever mouth on his neck and Dan draped all over him, the intoxicating way they moved together, then Dan reached between them with the hand that wasn\u2019t holding Phil\u2019s thigh firmly in place around him and in a practised move he had pulled Phil\u2019s leaking cock from the confines of the tight, restrictive fabric and just like that he was stroking them together, tight and slick in his big hand, the slide made easier by the precome sliding down their cocks, and before long they were thrusting up into Dan\u2019s fist in a perfect rhythm. </p><p>One of Phil\u2019s hands was holding on to Dan\u2019s back for leverage as they rutted against each other right there, under the brightness of the morning sun against the shiny kitchen they had both liked so much when they first visited this house looking to rent, and the great acoustics of the room meant that all their little sounds of pleasure felt a little too loud, and the too bright light coming in through the huge glass door made Phil feel a little too exposed, made this feel wonderfully dirty, and then Dan let go of his neck with a little pop that drew a thrill down Phil\u2019s spine because that felt amazing, and there was no way Dan had been careful enough, he knew he was going to find a purple bruise on his neck when he checked later.</p><p>Dan sucked on his earlobe, kissed right under it wetly in that one spot he knew made Phil all tingly, and then said right next to his ear, \u201cYou\u2019re so hot. I can\u2019t wait to sit on your face later,\u201d he was interrupted by a little moan, god Phil loved every little sound Dan made during sex, they never failed to make his cock twitch with want and now was no exception. </p><p>\n\n \u201cYeah? You gonna let me eat you out later?\u201d Phil was surprised how hoarse he sounded, voice tight and breathless with how close he was to coming all over Dan\u2019s fist and Dan\u2019s cock and Dan\u2019s soft, pliant stomach. \u201cYou wanna see how the burn feels there? On your inner thighs? How it feels around your hole while my tongue pushes inside?\u201d\n\n</p><p>\n\n Dan whined, high and desperate and seconds later he was coming in his hand, still thrusting maddeningly against him. Phil could feel Dan\u2019s cock twitch against his own, could feel his come hit their stomachs and spill down to where his hand was still tugging on both their cocks, and the sounds and the suddenly slicker slide and the fantasy running through Phil\u2019s mind, overimposed to this reality that was just as erotic as the thought of spreading Dan open with his tongue and leaving stubble burn between his cheeks, the fact that Dan hadn\u2019t stopped moving his hand even though he must be starting to feel oversensitive by now, it all coalesced together to wring a very intense orgasm out of him, which had Phil adding into the mess on their stomachs and groins less than a minute after Dan.\n\n </p><p>\n\n Dan milked every last tendril of pleasure out of him, and then gently guided his leg to the ground. And they stood there, messy and a little high on hormones as they caught their breath, hanging off each other. Seems they\u2019d be taking a shower before Phil got to finish breakfast.\n\n</p><p>\n\n He wrapped both arms around Dan\u2019s broad back and squeezed him in a weak bear hug. He looked so pretty like this, the skin around his mouth looked tender, a bit red from Dan kissing all over his face and rubbing his own face against Phil\u2019s stubble. His face was flushed and his hair was a mess, lips a dark pink and so shiny Phil wanted to kiss them forever. He indulged himself in planting one short but heartfelt kiss on them, making Dan smile, and he nuzzled their noses together, feeling euphoric and drunk on love.\n\n</p><p>\u201cSo I take it you like the stubble, then?\u201d</p><p>That earned him a proper, too loud laugh from Dan. Phil would never get enough of Dan laughing like this, so sincere and carefree, with deep dimples and crinkly eyes and a happiness that reached his eyes. \u201cYes, Phil, I like it,\u201d he pronounced once he had finished laughing, a wide grin still on his face and audible on his words.</p><p>Phil was grinning just as wide, arms full of the man he loved and endorphins still rushing through his system. </p><p>\u201cBut we need to shower now. And then breakfast. And then and only then will I tell you more about how much I like your stubble, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil was smiling too wide, too open, too happy. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u201cCome on, we\u2019re disgusting,\u201d Dan said, but he wasn\u2019t bothered.

What if his hair was the source of his power, like some weird modern day Samson? </p><p>Dan kept telling him he would and did look great with a quiff, and even if he got one bad haircut, it wasn\u2019t the end of the world, hair grew back and people wouldn\u2019t stop watching him over that. But Phil still worried. He knew it wasn\u2019t entirely rational, but his appearance played a key role in his job, and he did depend financially on people watching his videos and buying his merch.</p><p>So he eased into it. </p><p>He kept the fringe for videos and public appearances, but he started wearing it differently at home. Just to try it out. He styled it out of his forehead and tried giving it some volume, and it worked out pretty well. He liked it. He liked that he had both options open, either leaving the fringe down or styling it up into a quiff. It felt safer than jumping off the deep end with a more radical change he might regret and then would be stuck having to deal with. </p><p>It turned out to be the right choice, because wearing his hair up in a quiff sometimes turned into wearing it into a quiff all the time off-camera, which got him so accustomed to it that it started to feel natural, and styling it down into the fringe started to feel weird and contrived. It made the final step - finally getting a haircut specifically to wear as a quiff - feel organic and right, a small step rather than the extremely radical change it had felt like at the beginning. </p><p>And his viewers actually liked it! It was a relief, as he couldn\u2019t imagine going back at that point.</p><p>He was even more pleased to find out that Dan really, <i>really</i> liked it.</p><p>*</p><p>Dan had liked it when Phil started wearing his hair differently around the house. He hadn\u2019t made a big deal out of it, because he knew Phil and his anxiety intimately well by now, and he was a sweetheart who overthought everything and would never purposefully make another person self-conscious, least of all his favourite person in the world, so he played it cool. He did comment on how he liked it, and Phil caught him staring a few times, but when caught Dan just smiled at him, or gave him one of those cheeky suggestive grins that always got under Phil\u2019s skin in the best of ways, or he complimented Phil\u2019s shiny pale forehead (this happened several times, the dork). </p><p>As it got more and more common for Phil to wear his hair in a quiff, Dan started bringing up the subject, always full of patience and understanding, always encouraging. Well, almost always, Dan was only human and he had bad days, too. Phil had fond memories of the one time Dan had been so done with him for wanting to change his hair but being too scared to actually do it that he\u2019d resorted to pontificating about how great Phil looked, how could he think anyone wouldn\u2019t like it, he was so fit, what was he thinking, and so on.\n\n It had ended up with Dan pushing him down to sit on his lap, slipping one of his hands down into his pants and pumping his cock fast and hard while he told him just how much he liked various physical attributes of his in a low, sultry voice and watched him come apart under his ministrations. \n\nHe hadn\u2019t let Phil kiss him while he did it because he wanted to watch him, he\u2019d said. And he had. Watched. Intently.\n\n\n\n </p><p>It hadn\u2019t really undone the knot of anxiety in his head, but it had helped.</p><p>And it made for a lovely fantasy to come back to when they were apart.</p><p>*</p><p>Eventually, it happened, right in the middle of the exhausting preparations for their second tour, Phil made the decision to cut his hair. Not just wear it up, but actually get a haircut specifically to wear as a quiff. He was pretty happy with the results.</p><p>He posted a picture online, and it was a roaring success, which calmed the worries that persisted in the back of his mind, and just like that, it was done. </p><p>*</p><p>It was only a few weeks after his haircut, they had carved out a full hour and a half to relax and do nothing after dinner, maybe watch a movie before they had to turn in to get enough sleep to hopefully fuel them through another intense 12-hour workday of setting up, rehearsing and fine-tuning the show, not to mention making far too many little decisions about literally everything. People didn\u2019t talk enough about how exhausting it was to make decisions constantly, and these were decisions that would shape their show, which they had been working on for so long and wanted so bad to make the best they could. Phil was grateful every day that Dan was right there alongside him, he didn\u2019t think he could be doing this alone. </p><p>\n\nIt had been a good day, despite the tiredness wearing down on them both. They\u2019d been vlogging all week for a video that they\u2019d be posting some time the following week to promote the show, and even though there was still a lot to get done, it seemed the worst of it was behind them and this huge project of theirs was actually going to work out fine after all. Dan was no longer feeling (too) overwhelmed by it, and Phil had officially crossed the threshold from scared to excited.\n\n</p><p>\n\n Of course, despite plans to relax and put work aside for the evening, they really couldn\u2019t help themselves from talking about it. They ended up lounging in their living room sofa and shuffling around ideas and expectations, their hopes and fears for the coming tour.\n\n</p><p>\n\n \n\n Phil was babbling, jumping from subject to subject as he often did, going through different details from parts of the show and laying out his thoughts in a jumble that would be hard for someone who wasn\u2019t familiar with him to follow. He never had to make an effort to spell out his thoughts for Dan, he\u2019d been able to follow Phil\u2019s ramblings almost from day one. As it was, Phil was caught up enough on his own train of thought, and his excitement for the coming months, that it took him a while to notice the way Dan was staring at him.\n\n\n\n </p><p>Dan stared at him all the time, of course. It had stopped being something that made him feel embarrassed or self-conscious years ago, although it still caught him off guard sometimes. It still made him blush sometimes, made him want to hide his face behind whatever was at hand, bashful even after all these years. But that was rare. Mostly it filled him with a slow, treacly feeling of warmth; it made his chest coil and his stomach flutter. </p><p>Dan had always spent an inordinate amount of time looking at him, yes, but ever since Phil had finally decided to cut his hair a few weeks ago, it had become ridiculous. Dan was ridiculous, staring at him like that, with such painfully obvious affection that it made Phil bashful. Dan, this breathtakingly beautiful man, with his warm eyes and soft, puffy lips, and his lovely cheek \u201cdeficiencies\u201d; Dan, who could charm anyone, who had a way of drawing eyes wherever he went; Dan, who at 26 was every bit as irresistible to Phil as he had been as a gorgeous, nervous teen taking a wild chance. This Dan, Phil\u2019s Dan, had never quite broken the habit of staring at Phil, but lately it was less like he was indulging in it and more like he physically couldn\u2019t stop himself. </p><p>Phil raised an eyebrow at him. </p><p>Then raised the other one. </p><p>Then he waggled them.</p><p>Dan burst out laughing. <i>Success!</i>, though Phil triumphantly.</p><p>\u201cYou really like it this much?\u201d Phil asked, running a hand through his hair. </p><p>He was expecting a \u201cyes\u201d. He was expecting a heated look, a flirtatious remark, a teasing touch. Maybe a kiss.</p><p>Instead, Dan held his gaze, tender, enamoured, and softly said, \u201cI like <i>you</i>.\u201d </p><p>It wasn\u2019t often these days that Dan could make him blush. But it still happened sometimes.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>The stubble</b></h2><p>He\u2019d been thinking about it for ages. </p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d like it, could he even pull it off? He <i>was </i>curious. </p><p>He liked how he looked clean-shaven, so he\u2019d probably not change his everyday look. But it <i>would </i>be nice to feel comfortable with not shaving when he was really busy (or really lazy). </p><p>\n\n If he was being honest, he was more worried about what his audience would think of it, he knew how much they can dislike change. And he often wonders if all of them would still watch him if the professional lights and carefully chosen camera angles didn\u2019t make him look younger.\n\n </p><p>Less pressing but even more important to him was the question of what Dan would think of it. Phil knows Dan would never ask him to change something about himself, but if Dan didn\u2019t like it there was no way in hell that Phil would want to keep it. Some might say that was unhealthy, or wrong, or inadvisable, but Phil didn\u2019t care about any of that. He\u2019d been shaving this long, and he liked how he looked without facial hair, to continue shaving would be no hardship and he still, after all these years, wanted to look good for his partner. If Dan had a preference, Phil would want to indulge him. They were both like that. </p><p>Phil smiled a secret little smile whenever he was reminded of a much younger Dan grudgingly giving his natural curls free reign as a gift to Phil on certain special occasions - or sometimes just because. Just because \u201cI love you\u201d. Just because \u201cI like to spoil you\u201d. Just because \u201cI know how much you enjoy it, you weirdo,\u201d said with a happy, dimpled smile and soft eyes that always made Phil melt, without exception. \u00a0</p><p>So if Dan didn\u2019t like it, he\u2019d most likely scrap it. If his audience didn\u2019t like it\u2026 well, he\u2019d have to be careful to shave before videos and liveshows and any kind of public appearance (not that there were many of those, thank god, he\u2019d got a better handle on his anxiety over the years, but it could still be exhausting). But he was still curious to try it out. He\u2019d been turning it over in his head for ages before he finally made the decision. </p><p>*</p><p>As it turns out, he needn\u2019t have worried.</p><p>Dan liked it. </p><p>Not just liked it, but <i>liked </i>it. </p><p>The first day he forewent shaving yielded no visible results and so life went on as normal.</p><p>The second day it just looked like barely there five o\u2019clock shadow, and them making out lazily on the sofa had somehow devolved into Dan rubbing his own cheek against Phil\u2019s because he said he liked the feeling. It had made Phil laugh, amused, yeah, but also happy that he had a person, that he had <i>this specific person</i>, who he was so close with that they could be weird and silly together without a care in the world. They could do and say bizarre or absurd things and trust that the other would just go with it, maybe they\u2019d have to endure some light-hearted teasing for it, but even that felt like a blessing most days. Dan always looked so fond when he poked fun at him.</p><p>The third day, there was the beginnings of visible stubble, but they were so busy that Phil actually mostly forgot about it, focused as he was on everything they had to get done, and by the time they were finished they were both so exhausted they just collapsed in bed and went directly to sleep.</p><p>The fourth day, though. The fourth day was. Eventful.</p><p>Phil woke up first, to his slight disappointment, and he got up to the siren song of the coffeemaker resonating through his veins. </p><p>He was on his second cup when Dan joined him, looking sleep soft and ruffled in his oversized t-shirt and fuzzy slippers, long legs bare to the slightly chill air of the morning.</p><p>Phil did not get to <i>finish </i>his second cup of coffee that morning.</p><p>He was very much okay with that. </p><p>Having a sleepy Dan burrow into his arms and leaving soft kisses all over his jaw that turned to playful nips that turned to Dan grabbing his face to lick into his mouth was a very nice way to start the day, and you would hear no complaints from Phil about it.</p><p>Phil, distracted by Dan\u2019s pretty lips and big, clever hands and still only about 36% awake, failed to connect the dots until after Dan had peeled most of Phil\u2019s clothes off him, hands running over Phil\u2019s bare chest, and had gone back to bite his jaw. </p><p>Dan liked his jaw, but he didn\u2019t normally give it this much attention.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\n\n \u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Dan hummed, causing vibrations to travel up the side of his face he was nibbling on, then licked a stripe up his neck, all the way to his chin. It should have been weird, but Phil had never concerned himself with weird when something felt good, and Dan\u2019s tongue on him felt fantastic. \u201cI want to feel the scratch all over,\u201d Dan said softly into his cheek. The words suddenly opened up a whole new genre of fantasies in Phil\u2019s mind. Dan\u2019s effect on him had always been remarkable.\n\n </p><p>Dan was back to kissing him before Phil recovered from this revelation, sucking gently on his tongue one second and biting on his bottom lip the next, exactly as hard as Phil liked it, one hand running down his spine, slow but with intent, tracing the curve of his ass and squeezing. Phil let out a soft moan and rubbed up against him, chest bare against Dan\u2019s thin t-shirt. They had moved automatically to line up their cocks together as they kissed against the kitchen counter, so in tune with each other\u2019s bodies after all these years, and Phil could feel Dan hardening against him. He loved that, had always loved that, there was something so intimate about being able to track his partner\u2019s desire this way, to get to partake in the experience with them.</p><p>Dan dragged his mouth down to his neck, wet and sloppy and leaving a burning trail with his tongue, and he <i>sucked</i>, hard enough that Phil wasn\u2019t sure he wouldn\u2019t leave a mark, teeth grazing the sensitive flesh and making Phil\u2019s knees weak. And as he did this, he moved the hand grabbing one of his asscheeks possessively down to Phil\u2019s thigh and lifted it until Phil instinctively wrapped it around him, and he moved his hips in maddening tight little circles that were shooting sparks under his skin, and Phil wanted to touch skin, wanted it <i>now</i>, so he grabbed a handful of oversized t-shirt and pulled, and pulled, until the fabric had bunched up in between their chests, and Phil could feel the soft skin of Dan\u2019s bare stomach against his own, and Dan\u2019s bare cock rubbing against Phil\u2019s where it was still trapped in his pants. Phil was whining a little, the combination of Dan\u2019s far too clever mouth on his neck and Dan draped all over him, the intoxicating way they moved together, then Dan reached between them with the hand that wasn\u2019t holding Phil\u2019s thigh firmly in place around him and in a practised move he had pulled Phil\u2019s leaking cock from the confines of the tight, restrictive fabric and just like that he was stroking them together, tight and slick in his big hand, the slide made easier by the precome sliding down their cocks, and before long they were thrusting up into Dan\u2019s fist in a perfect rhythm. </p><p>One of Phil\u2019s hands was holding on to Dan\u2019s back for leverage as they rutted against each other right there, under the brightness of the morning sun against the shiny kitchen they had both liked so much when they first visited this house looking to rent, and the great acoustics of the room meant that all their little sounds of pleasure felt a little too loud, and the too bright light coming in through the huge glass door made Phil feel a little too exposed, made this feel wonderfully dirty, and then Dan let go of his neck with a little pop that drew a thrill down Phil\u2019s spine because that felt amazing, and there was no way Dan had been careful enough, he knew he was going to find a purple bruise on his neck when he checked later.</p><p>Dan sucked on his earlobe, kissed right under it wetly in that one spot he knew made Phil all tingly, and then said right next to his ear, \u201cYou\u2019re so hot. I can\u2019t wait to sit on your face later,\u201d he was interrupted by a little moan, god Phil loved every little sound Dan made during sex, they never failed to make his cock twitch with want and now was no exception. </p><p>\n\n \u201cYeah? You gonna let me eat you out later?\u201d Phil was surprised how hoarse he sounded, voice tight and breathless with how close he was to coming all over Dan\u2019s fist and Dan\u2019s cock and Dan\u2019s soft, pliant stomach. \u201cYou wanna see how the burn feels there? On your inner thighs? How it feels around your hole while my tongue pushes inside?\u201d\n\n</p><p>\n\n Dan whined, high and desperate and seconds later he was coming in his hand, still thrusting maddeningly against him. Phil could feel Dan\u2019s cock twitch against his own, could feel his come hit their stomachs and spill down to where his hand was still tugging on both their cocks, and the sounds and the suddenly slicker slide and the fantasy running through Phil\u2019s mind, overimposed to this reality that was just as erotic as the thought of spreading Dan open with his tongue and leaving stubble burn between his cheeks, the fact that Dan hadn\u2019t stopped moving his hand even though he must be starting to feel oversensitive by now, it all coalesced together to wring a very intense orgasm out of him, which had Phil adding into the mess on their stomachs and groins less than a minute after Dan.\n\n </p><p>\n\n Dan milked every last tendril of pleasure out of him, and then gently guided his leg to the ground.

He looked so pretty like this, the skin around his mouth looked tender, a bit red from Dan kissing all over his face and rubbing his own face against Phil\u2019s stubble. His face was flushed and his hair was a mess, lips a dark pink and so shiny Phil wanted to kiss them forever. He indulged himself in planting one short but heartfelt kiss on them, making Dan smile, and he nuzzled their noses together, feeling euphoric and drunk on love.\n\n</p><p>\u201cSo I take it you like the stubble, then?\u201d</p><p>That earned him a proper, too loud laugh from Dan. Phil would never get enough of Dan laughing like this, so sincere and carefree, with deep dimples and crinkly eyes and a happiness that reached his eyes. \u201cYes, Phil, I like it,\u201d he pronounced once he had finished laughing, a wide grin still on his face and audible on his words.</p><p>Phil was grinning just as wide, arms full of the man he loved and endorphins still rushing through his system. </p><p>\u201cBut we need to shower now.

What if his hair was the source of his power, like some weird modern day Samson? </p><p>Dan kept telling him he would and did look great with a quiff, and even if he got one bad haircut, it wasn\u2019t the end of the world, hair grew back and people wouldn\u2019t stop watching him over that. But Phil still worried. He knew it wasn\u2019t entirely rational, but his appearance played a key role in his job, and he did depend financially on people watching his videos and buying his merch.</p><p>So he eased into it. </p><p>He kept the fringe for videos and public appearances, but he started wearing it differently at home. Just to try it out. He styled it out of his forehead and tried giving it some volume, and it worked out pretty well. He liked it. He liked that he had both options open, either leaving the fringe down or styling it up into a quiff. It felt safer than jumping off the deep end with a more radical change he might regret and then would be stuck having to deal with. </p><p>It turned out to be the right choice, because wearing his hair up in a quiff sometimes turned into wearing it into a quiff all the time off-camera, which got him so accustomed to it that it started to feel natural, and styling it down into the fringe started to feel weird and contrived. It made the final step - finally getting a haircut specifically to wear as a quiff - feel organic and right, a small step rather than the extremely radical change it had felt like at the beginning. </p><p>And his viewers actually liked it! It was a relief, as he couldn\u2019t imagine going back at that point.</p><p>He was even more pleased to find out that Dan really, <i>really</i> liked it.</p><p>*</p><p>Dan had liked it when Phil started wearing his hair differently around the house. He hadn\u2019t made a big deal out of it, because he knew Phil and his anxiety intimately well by now, and he was a sweetheart who overthought everything and would never purposefully make another person self-conscious, least of all his favourite person in the world, so he played it cool. He did comment on how he liked it, and Phil caught him staring a few times, but when caught Dan just smiled at him, or gave him one of those cheeky suggestive grins that always got under Phil\u2019s skin in the best of ways, or he complimented Phil\u2019s shiny pale forehead (this happened several times, the dork). </p><p>As it got more and more common for Phil to wear his hair in a quiff, Dan started bringing up the subject, always full of patience and understanding, always encouraging. Well, almost always, Dan was only human and he had bad days, too. Phil had fond memories of the one time Dan had been so done with him for wanting to change his hair but being too scared to actually do it that he\u2019d resorted to pontificating about how great Phil looked, how could he think anyone wouldn\u2019t like it, he was so fit, what was he thinking, and so on.\n\n It had ended up with Dan pushing him down to sit on his lap, slipping one of his hands down into his pants and pumping his cock fast and hard while he told him just how much he liked various physical attributes of his in a low, sultry voice and watched him come apart under his ministrations. \n\nHe hadn\u2019t let Phil kiss him while he did it because he wanted to watch him, he\u2019d said. And he had. Watched. Intently.\n\n\n\n </p><p>It hadn\u2019t really undone the knot of anxiety in his head, but it had helped.</p><p>And it made for a lovely fantasy to come back to when they were apart.</p><p>*</p><p>Eventually, it happened, right in the middle of the exhausting preparations for their second tour, Phil made the decision to cut his hair. Not just wear it up, but actually get a haircut specifically to wear as a quiff. He was pretty happy with the results.</p><p>He posted a picture online, and it was a roaring success, which calmed the worries that persisted in the back of his mind, and just like that, it was done. </p><p>*</p><p>It was only a few weeks after his haircut, they had carved out a full hour and a half to relax and do nothing after dinner, maybe watch a movie before they had to turn in to get enough sleep to hopefully fuel them through another intense 12-hour workday of setting up, rehearsing and fine-tuning the show, not to mention making far too many little decisions about literally everything. People didn\u2019t talk enough about how exhausting it was to make decisions constantly, and these were decisions that would shape their show, which they had been working on for so long and wanted so bad to make the best they could. Phil was grateful every day that Dan was right there alongside him, he didn\u2019t think he could be doing this alone. </p><p>\n\nIt had been a good day, despite the tiredness wearing down on them both. They\u2019d been vlogging all week for a video that they\u2019d be posting some time the following week to promote the show, and even though there was still a lot to get done, it seemed the worst of it was behind them and this huge project of theirs was actually going to work out fine after all. Dan was no longer feeling (too) overwhelmed by it, and Phil had officially crossed the threshold from scared to excited.\n\n</p><p>\n\n Of course, despite plans to relax and put work aside for the evening, they really couldn\u2019t help themselves from talking about it. They ended up lounging in their living room sofa and shuffling around ideas and expectations, their hopes and fears for the coming tour.\n\n</p><p>\n\n \n\n Phil was babbling, jumping from subject to subject as he often did, going through different details from parts of the show and laying out his thoughts in a jumble that would be hard for someone who wasn\u2019t familiar with him to follow. He never had to make an effort to spell out his thoughts for Dan, he\u2019d been able to follow Phil\u2019s ramblings almost from day one. As it was, Phil was caught up enough on his own train of thought, and his excitement for the coming months, that it took him a while to notice the way Dan was staring at him.\n\n\n\n </p><p>Dan stared at him all the time, of course. It had stopped being something that made him feel embarrassed or self-conscious years ago, although it still caught him off guard sometimes. It still made him blush sometimes, made him want to hide his face behind whatever was at hand, bashful even after all these years. But that was rare. Mostly it filled him with a slow, treacly feeling of warmth; it made his chest coil and his stomach flutter. </p><p>Dan had always spent an inordinate amount of time looking at him, yes, but ever since Phil had finally decided to cut his hair a few weeks ago, it had become ridiculous. Dan was ridiculous, staring at him like that, with such painfully obvious affection that it made Phil bashful. Dan, this breathtakingly beautiful man, with his warm eyes and soft, puffy lips, and his lovely cheek \u201cdeficiencies\u201d; Dan, who could charm anyone, who had a way of drawing eyes wherever he went; Dan, who at 26 was every bit as irresistible to Phil as he had been as a gorgeous, nervous teen taking a wild chance. This Dan, Phil\u2019s Dan, had never quite broken the habit of staring at Phil, but lately it was less like he was indulging in it and more like he physically couldn\u2019t stop himself. </p><p>Phil raised an eyebrow at him. </p><p>Then raised the other one. </p><p>Then he waggled them.</p><p>Dan burst out laughing. <i>Success!</i>, though Phil triumphantly.</p><p>\u201cYou really like it this much?\u201d Phil asked, running a hand through his hair. </p><p>He was expecting a \u201cyes\u201d. He was expecting a heated look, a flirtatious remark, a teasing touch. Maybe a kiss.</p><p>Instead, Dan held his gaze, tender, enamoured, and softly said, \u201cI like <i>you</i>.\u201d </p><p>It wasn\u2019t often these days that Dan could make him blush. But it still happened sometimes.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>The stubble</b></h2><p>He\u2019d been thinking about it for ages. </p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d like it, could he even pull it off? He <i>was </i>curious. </p><p>He liked how he looked clean-shaven, so he\u2019d probably not change his everyday look. But it <i>would </i>be nice to feel comfortable with not shaving when he was really busy (or really lazy). </p><p>\n\n If he was being honest, he was more worried about what his audience would think of it, he knew how much they can dislike change. And he often wonders if all of them would still watch him if the professional lights and carefully chosen camera angles didn\u2019t make him look younger.\n\n </p><p>Less pressing but even more important to him was the question of what Dan would think of it. Phil knows Dan would never ask him to change something about himself, but if Dan didn\u2019t like it there was no way in hell that Phil would want to keep it. Some might say that was unhealthy, or wrong, or inadvisable, but Phil didn\u2019t care about any of that. He\u2019d been shaving this long, and he liked how he looked without facial hair, to continue shaving would be no hardship and he still, after all these years, wanted to look good for his partner. If Dan had a preference, Phil would want to indulge him. They were both like that. </p><p>Phil smiled a secret little smile whenever he was reminded of a much younger Dan grudgingly giving his natural curls free reign as a gift to Phil on certain special occasions - or sometimes just because. Just because \u201cI love you\u201d. Just because \u201cI like to spoil you\u201d. Just because \u201cI know how much you enjoy it, you weirdo,\u201d said with a happy, dimpled smile and soft eyes that always made Phil melt, without exception. \u00a0</p><p>So if Dan didn\u2019t like it, he\u2019d most likely scrap it. If his audience didn\u2019t like it\u2026 well, he\u2019d have to be careful to shave before videos and liveshows and any kind of public appearance (not that there were many of those, thank god, he\u2019d got a better handle on his anxiety over the years, but it could still be exhausting). But he was still curious to try it out. He\u2019d been turning it over in his head for ages before he finally made the decision. </p><p>*</p><p>As it turns out, he needn\u2019t have worried.</p><p>Dan liked it. </p><p>Not just liked it, but <i>liked </i>it. </p><p>The first day he forewent shaving yielded no visible results and so life went on as normal.</p><p>The second day it just looked like barely there five o\u2019clock shadow, and them making out lazily on the sofa had somehow devolved into Dan rubbing his own cheek against Phil\u2019s because he said he liked the feeling. It had made Phil laugh, amused, yeah, but also happy that he had a person, that he had <i>this specific person</i>, who he was so close with that they could be weird and silly together without a care in the world. They could do and say bizarre or absurd things and trust that the other would just go with it, maybe they\u2019d have to endure some light-hearted teasing for it, but even that felt like a blessing most days. Dan always looked so fond when he poked fun at him.</p><p>The third day, there was the beginnings of visible stubble, but they were so busy that Phil actually mostly forgot about it, focused as he was on everything they had to get done, and by the time they were finished they were both so exhausted they just collapsed in bed and went directly to sleep.</p><p>The fourth day, though. The fourth day was. Eventful.</p><p>Phil woke up first, to his slight disappointment, and he got up to the siren song of the coffeemaker resonating through his veins. </p><p>He was on his second cup when Dan joined him, looking sleep soft and ruffled in his oversized t-shirt and fuzzy slippers, long legs bare to the slightly chill air of the morning.</p><p>Phil did not get to <i>finish </i>his second cup of coffee that morning.</p><p>He was very much okay with that. </p><p>Having a sleepy Dan burrow into his arms and leaving soft kisses all over his jaw that turned to playful nips that turned to Dan grabbing his face to lick into his mouth was a very nice way to start the day, and you would hear no complaints from Phil about it.</p><p>Phil, distracted by Dan\u2019s pretty lips and big, clever hands and still only about 36% awake, failed to connect the dots until after Dan had peeled most of Phil\u2019s clothes off him, hands running over Phil\u2019s bare chest, and had gone back to bite his jaw. </p><p>Dan liked his jaw, but he didn\u2019t normally give it this much attention.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\n\n \u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Dan hummed, causing vibrations to travel up the side of his face he was nibbling on, then licked a stripe up his neck, all the way to his chin. It should have been weird, but Phil had never concerned himself with weird when something felt good, and Dan\u2019s tongue on him felt fantastic. \u201cI want to feel the scratch all over,\u201d Dan said softly into his cheek. The words suddenly opened up a whole new genre of fantasies in Phil\u2019s mind. Dan\u2019s effect on him had always been remarkable.\n\n </p><p>Dan was back to kissing him before Phil recovered from this revelation, sucking gently on his tongue one second and biting on his bottom lip the next, exactly as hard as Phil liked it, one hand running down his spine, slow but with intent, tracing the curve of his ass and squeezing. Phil let out a soft moan and rubbed up against him, chest bare against Dan\u2019s thin t-shirt. They had moved automatically to line up their cocks together as they kissed against the kitchen counter, so in tune with each other\u2019s bodies after all these years, and Phil could feel Dan hardening against him. He loved that, had always loved that, there was something so intimate about being able to track his partner\u2019s desire this way, to get to partake in the experience with them.</p><p>Dan dragged his mouth down to his neck, wet and sloppy and leaving a burning trail with his tongue, and he <i>sucked</i>, hard enough that Phil wasn\u2019t sure he wouldn\u2019t leave a mark, teeth grazing the sensitive flesh and making Phil\u2019s knees weak. And as he did this, he moved the hand grabbing one of his asscheeks possessively down to Phil\u2019s thigh and lifted it until Phil instinctively wrapped it around him, and he moved his hips in maddening tight little circles that were shooting sparks under his skin, and Phil wanted to touch skin, wanted it <i>now</i>, so he grabbed a handful of oversized t-shirt and pulled, and pulled, until the fabric had bunched up in between their chests, and Phil could feel the soft skin of Dan\u2019s bare stomach against his own, and Dan\u2019s bare cock rubbing against Phil\u2019s where it was still trapped in his pants. Phil was whining a little, the combination of Dan\u2019s far too clever mouth on his neck and Dan draped all over him, the intoxicating way they moved together, then Dan reached between them with the hand that wasn\u2019t holding Phil\u2019s thigh firmly in place around him and in a practised move he had pulled Phil\u2019s leaking cock from the confines of the tight, restrictive fabric and just like that he was stroking them together, tight and slick in his big hand, the slide made easier by the precome sliding down their cocks, and before long they were thrusting up into Dan\u2019s fist in a perfect rhythm. </p><p>One of Phil\u2019s hands was holding on to Dan\u2019s back for leverage as they rutted against each other right there, under the brightness of the morning sun against the shiny kitchen they had both liked so much when they first visited this house looking to rent, and the great acoustics of the room meant that all their little sounds of pleasure felt a little too loud, and the too bright light coming in through the huge glass door made Phil feel a little too exposed, made this feel wonderfully dirty, and then Dan let go of his neck with a little pop that drew a thrill down Phil\u2019s spine because that felt amazing, and there was no way Dan had been careful enough, he knew he was going to find a purple bruise on his neck when he checked later.</p><p>Dan sucked on his earlobe, kissed right under it wetly in that one spot he knew made Phil all tingly, and then said right next to his ear, \u201cYou\u2019re so hot. I can\u2019t wait to sit on your face later,\u201d he was interrupted by a little moan, god Phil loved every little sound Dan made during sex, they never failed to make his cock twitch with want and now was no exception. </p><p>\n\n \u201cYeah? You gonna let me eat you out later?\u201d Phil was surprised how hoarse he sounded, voice tight and breathless with how close he was to coming all over Dan\u2019s fist and Dan\u2019s cock and Dan\u2019s soft, pliant stomach. \u201cYou wanna see how the burn feels there? On your inner thighs? How it feels around your hole while my tongue pushes inside?\u201d\n\n</p><p>\n\n Dan whined, high and desperate and seconds later he was coming in his hand, still thrusting maddeningly against him. Phil could feel Dan\u2019s cock twitch against his own, could feel his come hit their stomachs and spill down to where his hand was still tugging on both their cocks, and the sounds and the suddenly slicker slide and the fantasy running through Phil\u2019s mind, overimposed to this reality that was just as erotic as the thought of spreading Dan open with his tongue and leaving stubble burn between his cheeks, the fact that Dan hadn\u2019t stopped moving his hand even though he must be starting to feel oversensitive by now, it all coalesced together to wring a very intense orgasm out of him, which had Phil adding into the mess on their stomachs and groins less than a minute after Dan.\n\n </p><p>\n\n Dan milked every last tendril of pleasure out of him, and then gently guided his leg to the ground. And they stood there, messy and a little high on hormones as they caught their breath, hanging off each other. Seems they\u2019d be taking a shower before Phil got to finish breakfast.\n\n</p><p>\n\n He wrapped both arms around Dan\u2019s broad back and squeezed him in a weak bear hug. He looked so pretty like this, the skin around his mouth looked tender, a bit red from Dan kissing all over his face and rubbing his own face against Phil\u2019s stubble. His face was flushed and his hair was a mess, lips a dark pink and so shiny Phil wanted to kiss them forever. He indulged himself in planting one short but heartfelt kiss on them, making Dan smile, and he nuzzled their noses together, feeling euphoric and drunk on love.\n\n</p><p>\u201cSo I take it you like the stubble, then?\u201d</p><p>That earned him a proper, too loud laugh from Dan. Phil would never get enough of Dan laughing like this, so sincere and carefree, with deep dimples and crinkly eyes and a happiness that reached his eyes. \u201cYes, Phil, I like it,\u201d he pronounced once he had finished laughing, a wide grin still on his face and audible on his words.</p><p>Phil was grinning just as wide, arms full of the man he loved and endorphins still rushing through his system. </p><p>\u201cBut we need to shower now. And then breakfast. And then and only then will I tell you more about how much I like your stubble, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil was smiling too wide, too open, too happy. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u201cCome on, we\u2019re disgusting,\u201d Dan said, but he wasn\u2019t bothered. It was just the usual banter. Phil knew all of Dan\u2019s hard limits and dislikes, and he knew Dan didn\u2019t really mind them standing half naked and covered in drying come in their too bright kitchen.\n\n </p><p>He had a point, though. And so Phil let himself be pulled to their main bathroom for a joint shower.</p><p>And as he let Dan gently wash the soap off him, he let himself think about later, and how he might use this newfound, unexpected advantage to give Dan everything he wanted, and then some.</p></p>",

Phil had fond memories of the one time Dan had been so done with him for wanting to change his hair but being too scared to actually do it that he&rsquo;d resorted to pontificating about how great Phil looked, how could he think anyone wouldn&rsquo;t like it, he was so fit, what was he thinking, and so on.\n\n It had ended up with Dan pushing him down to sit on his lap, slipping one of his hands down into his pants and pumping his cock fast and hard while he told him just how much he liked various physical attributes of his in a low, sultry voice and watched him come apart under his ministrations. \n\nHe hadn&rsquo;t let Phil kiss him while he did it because he wanted to watch him, he&rsquo;d said. And he had. Watched. Intently.\n\n\n\n </p><p>It hadn&rsquo;t really undone the knot of anxiety in his head, but it had helped.</p><p>And it made for a lovely fantasy to come back to when they were apart.</p><p>*</p><p>Eventually, it happened, right in the middle of the exhausting preparations for their second tour, Phil made the decision to cut his hair. Not just wear it up, but actually get a haircut specifically to wear as a quiff. He was pretty happy with the results.</p><p>He posted a picture online, and it was a roaring success, which calmed the worries that persisted in the back of his mind, and just like that, it was done. </p><p>*</p><p>It was only a few weeks after his haircut, they had carved out a full hour and a half to relax and do nothing after dinner, maybe watch a movie before they had to turn in to get enough sleep to hopefully fuel them through another intense 12-hour workday of setting up, rehearsing and fine-tuning the show, not to mention making far too many little decisions about literally everything. People didn&rsquo;t talk enough about how exhausting it was to make decisions constantly, and these were decisions that would shape their show, which they had been working on for so long and wanted so bad to make the best they could. Phil was grateful every day that Dan was right there alongside him, he didn&rsquo;t think he could be doing this alone. </p><p>\n\nIt had been a good day, despite the tiredness wearing down on them both. They&rsquo;d been vlogging all week for a video that they&rsquo;d be posting some time the following week to promote the show, and even though there was still a lot to get done, it seemed the worst of it was behind them and this huge project of theirs was actually going to work out fine after all. Dan was no longer feeling (too) overwhelmed by it, and Phil had officially crossed the threshold from scared to excited.\n\n</p><p>\n\n Of course, despite plans to relax and put work aside for the evening, they really couldn&rsquo;t help themselves from talking about it. They ended up lounging in their living room sofa and shuffling around ideas and expectations, their hopes and fears for the coming tour.\n\n</p><p>\n\n \n\n Phil was babbling, jumping from subject to subject as he often did, going through different details from parts of the show and laying out his thoughts in a jumble that would be hard for someone who wasn&rsquo;t familiar with him to follow. He never had to make an effort to spell out his thoughts for Dan, he&rsquo;d been able to follow Phil&rsquo;s ramblings almost from day one. As it was, Phil was caught up enough on his own train of thought, and his excitement for the coming months, that it took him a while to notice the way Dan was staring at him.\n\n\n\n </p><p>Dan stared at him all the time, of course. It had stopped being something that made him feel embarrassed or self-conscious years ago, although it still caught him off guard sometimes. It still made him blush sometimes, made him want to hide his face behind whatever was at hand, bashful even after all these years. But that was rare. Mostly it filled him with a slow, treacly feeling of warmth; it made his chest coil and his stomach flutter. </p><p>Dan had always spent an inordinate amount of time looking at him, yes, but ever since Phil had finally decided to cut his hair a few weeks ago, it had become ridiculous. Dan was ridiculous, staring at him like that, with such painfully obvious affection that it made Phil bashful. Dan, this breathtakingly beautiful man, with his warm eyes and soft, puffy lips, and his lovely cheek &ldquo;deficiencies&rdquo;; Dan, who could charm anyone, who had a way of drawing eyes wherever he went; Dan, who at 26 was every bit as irresistible to Phil as he had been as a gorgeous, nervous teen taking a wild chance. This Dan, Phil&rsquo;s Dan, had never quite broken the habit of staring at Phil, but lately it was less like he was indulging in it and more like he physically couldn&rsquo;t stop himself. </p><p>Phil raised an eyebrow at him. </p><p>Then raised the other one. </p><p>Then he waggled them.</p><p>Dan burst out laughing. <i>Success!</i>, though Phil triumphantly.</p><p>&ldquo;You really like it this much?&rdquo; Phil asked, running a hand through his hair. </p><p>He was expecting a &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. He was expecting a heated look, a flirtatious remark, a teasing touch. Maybe a kiss.</p><p>Instead, Dan held his gaze, tender, enamoured, and softly said, &ldquo;I like <i>you</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t often these days that Dan could make him blush. But it still happened sometimes.</p><p><br /></p><h2><b>The stubble</b></h2><p>He&rsquo;d been thinking about it for ages. </p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t sure if he&rsquo;d like it, could he even pull it off? He <i>was </i>curious. </p><p>He liked how he looked clean-shaven, so he&rsquo;d probably not change his everyday look. But it <i>would </i>be nice to feel comfortable with not shaving when he was really busy (or really lazy). </p><p>\n\n If he was being honest, he was more worried about what his audience would think of it, he knew how much they can dislike change. And he often wonders if all of them would still watch him if the professional lights and carefully chosen camera angles didn&rsquo;t make him look younger.\n\n </p><p>Less pressing but even more important to him was the question of what Dan would think of it. Phil knows Dan would never ask him to change something about himself, but if Dan didn&rsquo;t like it there was no way in hell that Phil would want to keep it. Some might say that was unhealthy, or wrong, or inadvisable, but Phil didn&rsquo;t care about any of that. He&rsquo;d been shaving this long, and he liked how he looked without facial hair, to continue shaving would be no hardship and he still, after all these years, wanted to look good for his partner. If Dan had a preference, Phil would want to indulge him. They were both like that. </p><p>Phil smiled a secret little smile whenever he was reminded of a much younger Dan grudgingly giving his natural curls free reign as a gift to Phil on certain special occasions - or sometimes just because. Just because &ldquo;I love you&rdquo;. Just because &ldquo;I like to spoil you&rdquo;. Just because &ldquo;I know how much you enjoy it, you weirdo,&rdquo; said with a happy, dimpled smile and soft eyes that always made Phil melt, without exception. &nbsp;</p><p>So if Dan didn&rsquo;t like it, he&rsquo;d most likely scrap it. If his audience didn&rsquo;t like it&hellip; well, he&rsquo;d have to be careful to shave before videos and liveshows and any kind of public appearance (not that there were many of those, thank god, he&rsquo;d got a better handle on his anxiety over the years, but it could still be exhausting). But he was still curious to try it out. He&rsquo;d been turning it over in his head for ages before he finally made the decision. </p><p>*</p><p>As it turns out, he needn&rsquo;t have worried.</p><p>Dan liked it. </p><p>Not just liked it, but <i>liked </i>it. </p><p>The first day he forewent shaving yielded no visible results and so life went on as normal.</p><p>The second day it just looked like barely there five o&rsquo;clock shadow, and them making out lazily on the sofa had somehow devolved into Dan rubbing his own cheek against Phil&rsquo;s because he said he liked the feeling. It had made Phil laugh, amused, yeah, but also happy that he had a person, that he had <i>this specific person</i>, who he was so close with that they could be weird and silly together without a care in the world. They could do and say bizarre or absurd things and trust that the other would just go with it, maybe they&rsquo;d have to endure some light-hearted teasing for it, but even that felt like a blessing most days. Dan always looked so fond when he poked fun at him.</p><p>The third day, there was the beginnings of visible stubble, but they were so busy that Phil actually mostly forgot about it, focused as he was on everything they had to get done, and by the time they were finished they were both so exhausted they just collapsed in bed and went directly to sleep.</p><p>The fourth day, though. The fourth day was. Eventful.</p><p>Phil woke up first, to his slight disappointment, and he got up to the siren song of the coffeemaker resonating through his veins. </p><p>He was on his second cup when Dan joined him, looking sleep soft and ruffled in his oversized t-shirt and fuzzy slippers, long legs bare to the slightly chill air of the morning.</p><p>Phil did not get to <i>finish </i>his second cup of coffee that morning.</p><p>He was very much okay with that. </p><p>Having a sleepy Dan burrow into his arms and leaving soft kisses all over his jaw that turned to playful nips that turned to Dan grabbing his face to lick into his mouth was a very nice way to start the day, and you would hear no complaints from Phil about it.</p><p>Phil, distracted by Dan&rsquo;s pretty lips and big, clever hands and still only about 36% awake, failed to connect the dots until after Dan had peeled most of Phil&rsquo;s clothes off him, hands running over Phil&rsquo;s bare chest, and had gone back to bite his jaw. </p><p>Dan liked his jaw, but he didn&rsquo;t normally give it this much attention.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Phil said.</p><p>\n\n &ldquo;Hmm&hellip;&rdquo; Dan hummed, causing vibrations to travel up the side of his face he was nibbling on, then licked a stripe up his neck, all the way to his chin. It should have been weird, but Phil had never concerned himself with weird when something felt good, and Dan&rsquo;s tongue on him felt fantastic. &ldquo;I want to feel the scratch all over,&rdquo; Dan said softly into his cheek. The words suddenly opened up a whole new genre of fantasies in Phil&rsquo;s mind. Dan&rsquo;s effect on him had always been remarkable.\n\n </p><p>Dan was back to kissing him before Phil recovered from this revelation, sucking gently on his tongue one second and biting on his bottom lip the next, exactly as hard as Phil liked it, one hand running down his spine, slow but with intent, tracing the curve of his ass and squeezing. Phil let out a soft moan and rubbed up against him, chest bare against Dan&rsquo;s thin t-shirt. They had moved automatically to line up their cocks together as they kissed against the kitchen counter, so in tune with each other&rsquo;s bodies after all these years, and Phil could feel Dan hardening against him. He loved that, had always loved that, there was something so intimate about being able to track his partner&rsquo;s desire this way, to get to partake in the experience with them.</p><p>Dan dragged his mouth down to his neck, wet and sloppy and leaving a burning trail with his tongue, and he <i>sucked</i>, hard enough that Phil wasn&rsquo;t sure he wouldn&rsquo;t leave a mark, teeth grazing the sensitive flesh and making Phil&rsquo;s knees weak. And as he did this, he moved the hand grabbing one of his asscheeks possessively down to Phil&rsquo;s thigh and lifted it until Phil instinctively wrapped it around him, and he moved his hips in maddening tight little circles that were shooting sparks under his skin, and Phil wanted to touch skin, wanted it <i>now</i>, so he grabbed a handful of oversized t-shirt and pulled, and pulled, until the fabric had bunched up in between their chests, and Phil could feel the soft skin of Dan&rsquo;s bare stomach against his own, and Dan&rsquo;s bare cock rubbing against Phil&rsquo;s where it was still trapped in his pants. Phil was whining a little, the combination of Dan&rsquo;s far too clever mouth on his neck and Dan draped all over him, the intoxicating way they moved together, then Dan reached between them with the hand that wasn&rsquo;t holding Phil&rsquo;s thigh firmly in place around him and in a practised move he had pulled Phil&rsquo;s leaking cock from the confines of the tight, restrictive fabric and just like that he was stroking them together, tight and slick in his big hand, the slide made easier by the precome sliding down their cocks, and before long they were thrusting up into Dan&rsquo;s fist in a perfect rhythm. </p><p>One of Phil&rsquo;s hands was holding on to Dan&rsquo;s back for leverage as they rutted against each other right there, under the brightness of the morning sun against the shiny kitchen they had both liked so much when they first visited this house looking to rent, and the great acoustics of the room meant that all their little sounds of pleasure felt a little too loud, and the too bright light coming in through the huge glass door made Phil feel a little too exposed, made this feel wonderfully dirty, and then Dan let go of his neck with a little pop that drew a thrill down Phil&rsquo;s spine because that felt amazing, and there was no way Dan had been careful enough, he knew he was going to find a purple bruise on his neck when he checked later.</p><p>Dan sucked on his earlobe, kissed right under it wetly in that one spot he knew made Phil all tingly, and then said right next to his ear, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so hot. I can&rsquo;t wait to sit on your face later,&rdquo; he was interrupted by a little moan, god Phil loved every little sound Dan made during sex, they never failed to make his cock twitch with want and now was no exception. </p><p>\n\n &ldquo;Yeah? You gonna let me eat you out later?&rdquo; Phil was surprised how hoarse he sounded, voice tight and breathless with how close he was to coming all over Dan&rsquo;s fist and Dan&rsquo;s cock and Dan&rsquo;s soft, pliant stomach. &ldquo;You wanna see how the burn feels there? On your inner thighs? How it feels around your hole while my tongue pushes inside?&rdquo;\n\n</p><p>\n\n Dan whined, high and desperate and seconds later he was coming in his hand, still thrusting maddeningly against him. Phil could feel Dan&rsquo;s cock twitch against his own, could feel his come hit their stomachs and spill down to where his hand was still tugging on both their cocks, and the sounds and the suddenly slicker slide and the fantasy running through Phil&rsquo;s mind, overimposed to this reality that was just as erotic as the thought of spreading Dan open with his tongue and leaving stubble burn between his cheeks, the fact that Dan hadn&rsquo;t stopped moving his hand even though he must be starting to feel oversensitive by now, it all coalesced together to wring a very intense orgasm out of him, which had Phil adding into the mess on their stomachs and groins less than a minute after Dan.\n\n </p><p>\n\n Dan milked every last tendril of pleasure out of him, and then gently guided his leg to the ground. And they stood there, messy and a little high on hormones as they caught their breath, hanging off each other. Seems they&rsquo;d be taking a shower before Phil got to finish breakfast.\n\n</p><p>\n\n He wrapped both arms around Dan&rsquo;s broad back and squeezed him in a weak bear hug. He looked so pretty like this, the skin around his mouth looked tender, a bit red from Dan kissing all over his face and rubbing his own face against Phil&rsquo;s stubble. His face was flushed and his hair was a mess, lips a dark pink and so shiny Phil wanted to kiss them forever. He indulged himself in planting one short but heartfelt kiss on them, making Dan smile, and he nuzzled their noses together, feeling euphoric and drunk on love.\n\n</p><p>&ldquo;So I take it you like the stubble, then?&rdquo;</p><p>That earned him a proper, too loud laugh from Dan. Phil would never get enough of Dan laughing like this, so sincere and carefree, with deep dimples and crinkly eyes and a happiness that reached his eyes. &ldquo;Yes, Phil, I like it,&rdquo; he pronounced once he had finished laughing, a wide grin still on his face and audible on his words.</p><p>Phil was grinning just as wide, arms full of the man he loved and endorphins still rushing through his system. </p><p>&ldquo;But we need to shower now. And then breakfast. And then and only then will I tell you more about how much I like your stubble, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Phil was smiling too wide, too open, too happy. &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &ldquo;Come on, we&rsquo;re disgusting,&rdquo; Dan said, but he wasn&rsquo;t bothered. It was just the usual banter. Phil knew all of Dan&rsquo;s hard limits and dislikes, and he knew Dan didn&rsquo;t really mind them standing half naked and covered in drying come in their too bright kitchen.\n\n </p><p>He had a point, though. And so Phil let himself be pulled to their main bathroom for a joint shower.</p><p>And as he let Dan gently wash the soap off him, he let himself think about later, and how he might use this newfound, unexpected advantage to give Dan everything he wanted, and then some.</p></p>",

He added a direct mention at Phil\u2019s name in one of the last jokes on the script. He learned last year that if he wants to get their attention focused on something, it should peak at the end of the video - as if they wouldn\u2019t focus on this particular bit even if he put it in a small comic sans writing on the bottom left of his video for a brief second at the beginning. They would eventually find it and freak out, their audience is like that sometimes, he knows and appreciates how fucking weird and dedicated they are.</p><p>It slightly worried him that people might label it as a coming out video. It\u2019s not. At least Dan doesn\u2019t see it like that; he doesn\u2019t want it to be. He never saw himself making a coming out video, he thinks they\u2019re already as out and they could be. There are no labels to be put there, Dan\u2019s just not heterosexual and he thinks he\u2019s made it pretty clear so far. He just wants to be officially there for people. Like with his depression video, after he talked about it, he felt like he could help and make a difference. This time it\u2019s another thing completely, but the feeling is there.</p><p>The mainstream media might be stronger about calling it coming out video. Another gay youtuber, even though he wouldn\u2019t label himself as gay. A non-straight guy in a homosexual relationship, it\u2019s more about it, but that\u2019s too complicated for a headline written by someone that doesn\u2019t care. So why should he care?</p><p>Their fanbase on the other hand, they know. It\u2019s more of a \u201ccoming clear\u201d video to them rather than a \u201ccome out\u201d sort of thing. It\u2019s a community video where he\u2019ll use some of his experiences and eventually clarify some stuff.</p><p>Dan prepares his background for it. He writes a \u201cguess what?\u201d on the little square sign with the letters. He organizes stuff around, sets the lighting, places the camera and sits in front of it.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he looks back at the script on his macbook \u201cshit this will be harder than I expected\u201d. He feels like he\u2019s learning to film a scripted video all over again, Takes a deep breath in, and out\u2026and in, and out. Fine, once he starts he can do it, he\u2019s been doing it for years, just let go and\u2026he presses play.</p><p>-</p><p>(if you thought that I would attempt to write what Dan would say in a video like this, that he theoretically took more than a year and creative writing lessons to reach perfection for, then you thought wrong)</p><p>-</p><p>And pause. Stop.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s it\u201d.</p><p>Or maybe not.</p><p>There\u2019s still editing on the way, and uploading.</p><p>Then posting.</p><p>What will kill him first from the anxiety it caused? He should have accepted Phil\u2019s old idea and filmed it together. Or maybe not, it would seem weird. Or is it already weird by being him alone? What if while rewatching and editing it, Dan cringed so hard he died from that and not the anxiety? He decided right there that if he cringed even once he wouldn\u2019t post it. No, he\u2019s already cringing. There must be another way. He already wanted to delete the whole thing and only post a cryptic pic on instagram. On their wedding day. Where people couldn\u2019t be exactly sure what was happening but also magically know everything. And never talk about it again.</p><p>His thoughts were racing and he stood up, almost kicking the butt chair to the floor on his way, not even bothering to close or turning off anything. He grabbed his phone on his way to the kitchen and called Phil. Hopefully he wouldn\u2019t be too busy doing fun Florida stuff. He braced himself against the kitchen counter while waiting for his fianc\u00e9 to answer the call.</p><p>\u201cPhil!\u201d Dan said, before Phil could even place the phone by his ear. He only heard the end \u201c-il\u201d part of his name and he instantly knew what happened to cause Dan to call him on the phone so soon after he hung up a skype call on a confident smiling Daniel.</p><p>He had filmed the video. And he freaked out.</p><p>\u201cShhhh, it\u2019s alright\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo it\u2019s not, it\u2019s horrible and cringy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve read that script Dan, it was so good. There is no way it\u2019s any of these things.\u201d</p><p>He heard Dan trying to even his breathing.</p><p>\u201cHave you watched it yet?\u201d Phil asked, to understand what he was dealing with.</p><p>\u201cNo. I just finished filming\u2026I think I didn\u2019t even turn the lighting off.\u201d</p><p>Oh, so he freaked out in capital letters and many scared emojis.</p><p>\u201cRight. Do you want me to watch it first and see how it is?\u201d</p><p>Dan stayed silent for a while, ruminating on the possibility. After about ten seconds Dan let out a sigh.</p><p>\u201cNo? I don\u2019t know\u2026maybe? You\u2019re enjoying time with your family Phil, it\u2019s not fair to bring you back to these problems we willingly got into, you\u2019ll have enough shit to deal with when you come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see it as a problem. It\u2019s supposed to be freeing, the scary bits are just part of this new way we\u2019re heading to, but everything will be fine at the end. We will be able to lean over and kiss on a gaming channel video and won\u2019t have to cut it out\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will probably cut it out anyway\u201d Dan had a hint of laugh in his voice now. That was better.</p><p>\u201cWe probably will, but not with the feeling that this is some sort of dirty secret.\u201d Phil sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s not bothering me at all to help you with this. It\u2019s your mental health, Dan, I care about you and I want to be here for you when you need me, like I said many times. You are the first one putting you face out there, alone-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mentioned you\u201d Dan cut him off.</p><p>\u201cGood. But still, you wanted to film it alone, it\u2019s your face and only that. I\u2019m proud that you were brave enough to kick it first, but it also worries me a bit. You\u2019re freaking out already. And I don\u2019t want you to feel alone in this, because you\u2019re not. You\u2019re definitely not. I shouldn\u2019t have left you physically alone before it all to begin with-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked you to go while I stayed in London, Phil\u201d Dan said, emphasizing the \u2018I\u2019.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re geniuses\u201d Phil said. Dan could almost see Phil running a hand through his quiff, worrying over this whole thing. Dan didn\u2019t want to get him worked up over him and his malfunctioning hormone producing brain while he was spending time with his family. Phil kept talking. \u201cPlease send me what you filmed. The way it is, you don\u2019t even have to look at it too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, but I want to edit it. Just tell me if it\u2019s good or if I have to change anything, if I\u2019m too nervous or if it\u2019s-\u201c Dan was starting to speak faster already.</p><p>\u201cDan\u2026\u201d Phil interrupted him. \u201c\u2026Breath. Please don\u2019t go there again; it\u2019s going to be fine. And please send me the thing.\u201d</p><p>Dan chuckled \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll hang up now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright. Don\u2019t hesitate to call me again if you need\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Phil wasn\u2019t sure if this answer was about not hesitating or about calling back, but it was for Dan to decide at this point.</p><p>\u201cLove you\u201d he heard Dan say.</p><p>\u201cLove you too.\u201d</p><p>And they hang up.</p><p>-</p><p>He had sent the file to Phil, about 15 minutes ago.</p><p>And now he was sat on the couch, with eyes closed and head thrown back, trying to relax while he waited for Phil\u2019s verdict. Just the idea of his almost 28 year old self feeling nervous and expectant for Phil to give an input about a video he\u2019d just filmed and had the potential to change everything made him laugh at himself. Feels like a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, like he has been in this position before.</p><p>And he has.</p><p>The good nostalgia feeling fills him again, but this time it\u2019s a memory so far away he couldn\u2019t remember details. Waiting for Phil\u2019s opinion on Hello Internet was something else, entirely, though he could swear it felt the same right now. But does he remember that feeling? Of trying to impress Phil and only him, to get his approval on something, using his \u201cediting tips\u201d. There really were editing tips after all, but most of it was just plain flirting on his part.</p><p>Phil had approved of Hello Internet though, and look what happened. That thing is majestically cringy. Maybe he shouldn\u2019t trust Phil with that, he was the one that assured Dan that Hello Internet was GrEaT! The thought made Dan laugh though. They were still tip toeing around each other at this point, so madly in love and anxious to finally meet soon, all the possibilities opening new paths for them. Phil wouldn\u2019t think Hello Internet was cringy because he was in love and Dan knows love can blind your judgment sometimes.</p><p>He knows because he eventually paid a price for exposing himself online more than he wish he had. Again, it\u2019s so sad that their love life was publicly exposed, that they had to delete part of their history together on the internet. Dan can\u2019t even revisit their first interactions on twitter. But part of it was their own fault, actually. What were they thinking when they came up with that \u201cwe met through a mutual friend\u201d lie is beyond his comprehension now, but they surely thought there was something too telling about Dan being a fan and meeting Phil by being a massive fanboy on main.</p><p>Lying about it and later coming back to the original story was even more telling, but as always they just made a point of not addressing it. What would they say anyway? \u201cOh yeah, that time, funny story. You were being too much and we freaked out because I was in love with Phil from day one and it was too clear while I publicly flirted with him on twitter, so we pretended it was nothing much\u201d. No way, not then. Maybe at some point from now on they will be able to laugh with them at all those things they did\u2026now that it can be funny.</p><p>And let\u2019s be honest, the real version of it is way too good of a love story. Dan still remembered the feeling of getting a reply from Phil on twitter, and then another one a couple of days later. Felt accomplishing and exciting. Then Phil slid into his DM\u2019s and he was being all flirty. Suddenly it didn\u2019t feel so right and yet he reciprocated some of it. He had a girlfriend when he met Phil. It was ok when he was just silently confused and curious about that guy making videos for youtube, someone he virtually would never meet. It was completely different when Phil started do show interest back. He fell so hard for Phil, there was no stopping it. Like Loki falling for 30 minutes, Dan\u2019s been falling for 10 years, and had no desire for it to stop.</p><p>He obviously broke up with his girlfriend when he understood how dangerously in trouble he was. And then went off to meet Phil in Manchester. Oh when he met his now fianc\u00e9 in person, how they hugged like they were made to fit together, for so long in the middle of the train station with lots of people around, probably looking suspiciously at them sometimes. Probably, as Dan just wondered about it sometimes, because in that moment they didn\u2019t noticed or cared whether people were looking or not. Phil was there and Dan was hugging him, clutching at the back of his hoodie like his life depended on it, like Phil could vanish from his fingers if he didn\u2019t hold him tight enough.</p><p>They weren\u2019t officially dating yet \u2013 and by official he means between the two of them \u2013 but they\u2019ve been crossing lines on the flirting etiquette for a while at this point. Deep down they knew Dan wouldn\u2019t embark on that train back to Wokigham without some hickey marks around his clavicle and sweet promises in his mind.</p><p>He remembers that they filmed the first PINOF that week, such a delicious memory that is, the first Phil is Not on Fire. He can hardly believe it\u2019s over for good, by number ten. Oh so much happened during the filming of the first one, with the camera on, and after they turned it off. He still has the original footage saved somewhere. But Dan could remember so much of it with some many details that it\u2019s already making him feel hotter. Was it that long ago?</p><p>He felt his phone buzz by his side. Great, Phil finished watching it, time to have his ass dragged, maybe he\u2019ll forget about those terribly dirty memories.</p><p>He reached for his phone without looking. Who\u2019d be calling him at this time except someone in America? He answered with a grunt, which earned him a laugh from the other side.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been up and down with that mood of yours today, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh, don\u2019t even mention. Have you watched it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Wanna skype for that? I think it would be better if you look me in the eyes when I tell you it\u2019s perfect and you did a great job at it, as always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I trust you with that, though? You once told me Hello Internet was good and that I should post it. Then that shit happened.\u201d<br/>They laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt became a classic, Dan. Come on\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor all the wrong reasons!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good first video. Have you seen mine? Hello Internet is art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust your concept of art now too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat hurt. My concept of art is flawless. Ask Corn.\u201d</p><p>Dan let out a bark laugh at that. Phil continued.</p><p>\u201cCan we skype, please. It\u2019s weird talking to you through the phone, it makes me anxious. I know I was the one that called you like this, but I had to know if you were still awake.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s fair. Dan couldn\u2019t blame him for feeling weird about talking through a regular call. Usually they only talk to each other like this when they\u2019re having a problem, when Dan is having a break down or something of the sort.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019d still be awake, do you think I\u2019d be able to sleep before having your input, luv? But I don\u2019t really trust myself to skype you right now, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026let\u2019s ay that I was here alone\u2026thinking about Phil is Not on Fire\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Phil sounded genuinely confused.</p><p>\u201cThe first one you spoon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026OH!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019re horny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now I\u2019m horny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting\u201d</p><p>At that, Dan heard the unmistakable sound of an incoming call on skype from his laptop.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nasty\u201d and hung up the phone call, then turned to answer the skype one.</p><p>The first thing Phil said when he appeared on the screen was \u201cthanks\u201d with that cheeky smile.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said wanking wasn\u2019t included in my alone time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh it definitely is!\u201d Dan laughed at that. \u201cI meant like, us doing it together. And it\u2019s up for you to decide at this point, love. You are already in the situation.\u201d</p><p>Oh Dan had decided, that\u2019s for sure.</p><p>_</p><p>\u201cFuck, why you do me like that?\u201d</p><p>Phil laughed at Dan\u2019s nonsensical post-orgasm mumbled question. He was definitely going to sleep after that.</p><p>\u201cYou started it. I just wanted to tell you that your video is good and you have nothing to worry about.\u201d Phil said while distracted cleaning his hand with some tissue paper. \u201cThere are actually not many mistakes to cut out, you went pretty straight with it\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was nothing straight about that video, Phil. If there was, then I missed my point\u201d</p><p>Phil laughed and rolled his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re insufferable. You know what I meant, you went pretty NOT straight with it, in the most accurate way possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Not much to edit, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, some cuts here and there, in long pauses and that, some effects that you pointed out and might want to add, artistic decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-hum\u201d It was Dan\u2019s turn to be distracted, looking down. \u201cYikes, my pajama is moist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo change\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s alright. I\u2019ll have take a bath before going to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He said, while he lifted the waist band to put some space between the clammy fabric and his skin.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026when are you planning to post the video?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext month, probably. I\u2019ve filmed it, the hardest part is done. And I kept my plan from last year, seeing as it\u2019s already May. They\u2019ve waited this long, they can wait less than a month now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know how much more they\u2019ll have to wait, Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell sucks to be them I guess\u201d</p><p>\u201cDa-an!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he laughed \u201cI\u2019ll talk about it at some point before my birthday, so they\u2019ll know it\u2019s coming. But I\u2019ll post it only after my birthday, around the anniversary of the first time we talked. They are curious and extra, they will theorize and this time it\u2019s going to be it. Will be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvil mastermind. They\u2019ll love it. Give the people what they want!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh, don\u2019t say that. I\u2019m having war flashback now.\u201d</p><p>They snorted. When the laugh died, they stayed in silence for a bit. Dan looked sadly to his moist clothing, his eyes already looked droopy.</p><p>\u201cI have to go, love\u201d Phil said, even though he didn\u2019t really had to. He knew Dan would stay as long as Phil could, but someone had to compromise. His sleep schedule was already slightly ruined by their late night talks while Phil was in America, and they knew it was important for his mental health.</p><p>\u201cGo have your shower and a good night\u2019s sleep. You\u2019re almost asleep sitting in the middle of our living room\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry about that\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, it\u2019s good that you\u2019re not feeling like staying awake until you hear birds chirping outside\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess. Talk to you later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll move to Antarctica, to live with penguins. There\u2019s no internet there so-\u201c</p><p>\u201cOh shut up, bitch\u201d</p><p>Phil was laughing that laugh where he pokes his tongue off.</p><p>\u201cSorry. But I\u2019ll probably be embarking back to London when you wake up, so we\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright. Love you bub, have a good night\u2019s sleep\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too love. Bye.\u201d</p><p>And they disconnected.</p><p>_</p><p>Phil was right. When Dan woke up, he had some messages from Phil on his phone, telling him that he was embarking. Probably the internet on board was shit, or he was enjoying the last few hours with his parents for now, for he\u2019ll only see them again next month. He made a mental note to only talk to Phil if he messaged him first.</p><p>He moved to a sitting position on the bed and looked around. Dan wasn\u2019t used to sleeping alone anymore, but if he had to, he\u2019d use the whole bed, sleeping right in the middle because \u201cwhy not?\u201d right? There were pillows all around him, like a little fort, where he could hug them whenever through the night, if he needed.</p><p>As comfortable as it was, he terribly missed Phil already, even though they could talk all the time if they wanted, it wasn\u2019t the same. When you spend so much time together, you get used to the person, it\u2019s a happy habit, you grow addicted to people. There was no way they could move from this status anymore, it wouldn\u2019t be easy if they had any desire to do so.</p><p>Perhaps that\u2019s another something they did wrong while trying to keep their relationship hidden. Because it was easy and casual when Phil was living in an apartment he could share with someone and their audience was still very young. Or when they moved to London with little to no money, just a job perspective ahead, they had to share an apartment because they couldn\u2019t afford two.</p><p>But when things started to work out for them and nothing changed, when they moved to a bigger place together and absolutely nothing changed \u2013 and if it did it was that they\u2019ve got even closer after that \u2013 then it got weird. When part of their audience grew up and became adults with their own significant others, seeing them still living together after so many years became as clear as water from the source.</p><p>Because this section of their audience wasn\u2019t just wishful thinking, they were properly seeing real things there. When you live with someone for this long, you smooth the sides of your personality to fit in with the smoothen sides of the other person\u2019s own personality. You get used to their quirks, habits and little things. And you get used to having them around, like it\u2019s how life is in its natural form. Right now, Phil is not here and it feels weird. It\u2019s important for Dan to have his alone time, but Phil doesn\u2019t count. Or if he\u2019s feeling like being literally alone then Phil might as well be in the next room, Dan will feel his presence around, like it is home and it\u2019s warmer. Wherever Phil is, it\u2019s home.</p><p>He didn\u2019t go with Phil to America because it wasn\u2019t going to be just them. And even though he absolutely loved the Lesters, they do count as other people. They certainly are family and have welcomed him into their circle better than he expected. Just because Phil had known for a while that he felt attraction for man at the time, it didn\u2019t mean his family knew it too. Phil handled it all so naturally, though. Dan on the other hand was scared shitless, everything his parents knew was that Dan had just broken up a long term relationship with a girl, and even though bi and pan sexuality are real, people tend to forget that.</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t want to dwell on the aftermath of his \u201ccoming out\u201d to his family anymore. It had plagued him for years, but he mended it with Phil\u2019s help and some therapy, as much as he could. As their career took off and they gained more audience and opportunity, things started get easier with his family.</p><p>But Phil\u2019s family had received him with open arms from the beginning, treating his like as much of a Lester as anyone of them. That\u2019s why Dan had decided to add Phil\u2019s surname to his own. \u201cDaniel James Howell-Lester\u201d sounded great to his ears. Not excluding his own name, but adding Phil\u2019s.</p><p>This thought led him to the wedding planning ideas. He had some calls to make, some stuff to research, still. It was the next big thing to do. Maybe the wedding stuff had held him back on the script writing for a while, but he didn\u2019t regret it. Planning a wedding was stressful, yes, but they\u2019ve planned two world tours so far, which made \u201cwedding planning\u201d sound like a kid\u2019s game. After Interactive Introverts Dan decided to relax a bit, so if he felt like hiring someone to help them and handle all this stuff he would jump right into it, but once he started he felt like he could do it, it was good, kept his mind busy but not overwhelmed. So far so good, flowing smoothly and inside the schedule.</p><p>There was no reason to wait more. Phil didn\u2019t propose just because he felt like they were together for long enough, he did it because he wanted to get married already. They already lived like a married couple, so not much would change in their day to day life. They will officially refer to each other as \u201cmy husband\u201d and they refuse keep going with the \u201conly friends\u201d anymore. That\u2019s a massive change once you let it out of the secrecy of your own home. There will also be some great memories to treasure forever of the day they swore their love for each other. That\u2019s ridiculously sweet, but true.</p><p>The business part of their life though, that will change a lot. How they deal with their shared businesses, their taxes, and even Dan\u2019s signature in those papers will have to be updated. They would never take this step if they didn\u2019t intend to come clear with their audience about it, because the business side of their lives was very much public and of easy access to anyone.</p><p>Dan grabbed his laptop from his side \u2013 he had taken it with him back from the living room last night and written some ideas down until he felt like he couldn\u2019t keep his eyes open \u2013 and his phone from the other and started to call places and schedule visits. They weren\u2019t visiting locations yet, they didn\u2019t want to be seen there together, it would ruin the damn surprise. They were deliberately blindsiding their audience. Their audience sort of knew, but maybe, by staying silent, they might slightly doubt it too. Was it mean? Probably. But that\u2019s what they deserve.</p><p>After he finished this bit, he went through the bakeries. That was important, not only to look pretty but for that cake to be delicious. They love their food, but mostly when it comes to the desert. They had narrowed the bakeries down to the ones they knew and loved, each one had their number one favorite flavors. Thinking about food just reminded him of the fact that he hadn\u2019t eaten yet. Shit. Dan looked at his phone, 11:30 am. Again, shit. If it\u2019s this late, he might as well get some lunch delivered. He grabbed back him phone and noticed a new message. From Phil.</p><p>They talked a bit about nothing, then about something weird Phil did at the airport \u2013 he, in fact, attracts crazy people, they had concluded \u2013 and how he thought he had seen Sam the Surfer again, but he wasn\u2019t sure, so it didn\u2019t count in Dan\u2019s opinion. Phil also informed that there would take just a couple more hours until he was home. Good, Dan was missing him a bit too much for his liking today.</p><p>Dan had a vegan healthy snack delivered for lunch. Phil was a bad meat-fluence in his eating sometimes, so when he was away Dan took the opportunity to try and eat less food of animal origin. It made him feel good whenever he accomplished a whole day without any meat, dairy or eggs. Sometimes Dan would get Phil into it, sometimes each one chose a thing to eat at the same place, so Dan could stay inside his guidelines and Phil would go off on his stuff. But when it was food for sharing, like a pizza, it was hard to say no to stuff he already liked.</p><p>He happily eat his vegan meal from the new place his brother had recommended to him. It was fucking delicious, indeed. Then he decided to just turn off his brain until Phil was home, by playing some Guild Wars II, of course.</p><p>_</p><p>Phil arrived home some hours later. He had messaged Dan when he landed, but got no response all the way back home. Dan was probably deep into some videogame, for not looking through his phone for the last hour at least. Phil wasn\u2019t too worried, he had seen this behavior before in two scenarios. It\u2019s been some months since Dan had left the house without his phone during a crisis, but they are heading to uncharted situation now, so who know? But he wanted to believe that it was more likely that he was playing.</p><p>When he walked up the stairs to the living room and saw Dan sprawled on the couch playing Guild Wars II, he definitely threw any doubt through the window. He entered Dan\u2019s view, and Dan jerked up on reflex. Like, how scared Dan would be if someone entered their apartment before he noticed it was Phil.</p><p>\u201cPhiiiil!\u201d Dan shrieked annoyed and amused at the same time.</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d Phil had that tongue-poking smile of his. \u201cI tried to tell you I was home, but you didn\u2019t answer my messages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas it really been this long?\u201d He grabbed his phone, whilst still trying to keep playing properly, he wasn\u2019t finished with his gaming. \u201cDamn, what?\u201d Yes, it has been this long.</p><p>Phil got closer to him and placed a kiss to his temple. Dan turned his face and gave him a peck on the lips. \u201cHi\u201d he smiled.</p><p>\u201cHey you\u201d, Phil answered. \u201cI\u2019ll go undo my luggage, put some clothes to wash and leave you alone a bit more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just finish here and I\u2019ll come for you\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Phil had a sly grin on now. That smile alone made Dan sound dirtier than intended.</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up you dirty bitch. I can\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>Phil was properly laughing now. \u201cCome for me later then\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that, I\u2019ve been without sex for too long now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. What a coincidence, Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say.\u201d Dan talked, but with his eyes glued to his game.\u201dThat\u2019s really a weird coincidence. We should do something about that.\u201d He says, as he seems to finish whatever he\u2019s doing, because he takes his laptop and put it aside, then grab Phil to his lap.</p><p>Phil noticed what Dan intended, and before he could fall awkwardly on his fianc\u00e9\u2019s lap and risking hurting him, he turned and lifted one leg, andd placed it by Dan\u2019s side, falling on his knees, on each side of the younger man&rsquo;s hips, and sitting right on his crotch.</p><p>The older man grabbed Dan\u2019s hands, intertwined their fingers and pushed them above Dan\u2019s head, while he lowered his body, gluing every inch he could to the other man\u2019s body. Phil wanted to savor Dan\u2019s delicious smell that he missed so much, and went right for his neck, kissing, nibbling and slightly biting it. He got Dan panting already, while he moved to under his ear, then the jaw, cheek, and then he finally found his mouth.</p><p>Phil let go of Dan\u2019s hands in favor of sliding it under his shirt, savoring slowly every inch of his skin, tantalizing with the tip of his fingers, on the brink of becoming ticklish. Dan, on his part, used his new found freedom to grab his fianc\u00e9 through the waist, pulling him closer and place the other hand on his neck, tangling his fingers in short locks of hair. Then, slightly, he pulled Phil\u2019s hair until they stopped kissing and Dan could look him in the eyes.</p><p>Phil\u2019s lips were very much red from kissing, and he could already feel how happy Dan was to see him, as he was grinding down against him.<br/>\u201cOh god\u201d Phil buckled forward, he was losing track of his thoughts way too fast.</p><p>Dan shushed Phil while he kept pulling the hair on the back of the other man\u2019s head, and kissing down his neck, over Adam\u2019s apple.</p><p>\u201cI missed you so much\u201d Phil murmured.</p><p>\u201cPhil\u201d Dan said as he let go of him and started to unbuckle his belt \u201cShush. Now&hellip; please fuck me.\u201d</p>",

He added a direct mention at Phil\u2019s name in one of the last jokes on the script. He learned last year that if he wants to get their attention focused on something, it should peak at the end of the video - as if they wouldn\u2019t focus on this particular bit even if he put it in a small comic sans writing on the bottom left of his video for a brief second at the beginning. They would eventually find it and freak out, their audience is like that sometimes, he knows and appreciates how fucking weird and dedicated they are.</p><p>It slightly worried him that people might label it as a coming out video. It\u2019s not. At least Dan doesn\u2019t see it like that; he doesn\u2019t want it to be. He never saw himself making a coming out video, he thinks they\u2019re already as out and they could be. There are no labels to be put there, Dan\u2019s just not heterosexual and he thinks he\u2019s made it pretty clear so far. He just wants to be officially there for people. Like with his depression video, after he talked about it, he felt like he could help and make a difference. This time it\u2019s another thing completely, but the feeling is there.</p><p>The mainstream media might be stronger about calling it coming out video. Another gay youtuber, even though he wouldn\u2019t label himself as gay. A non-straight guy in a homosexual relationship, it\u2019s more about it, but that\u2019s too complicated for a headline written by someone that doesn\u2019t care. So why should he care?</p><p>Their fanbase on the other hand, they know. It\u2019s more of a \u201ccoming clear\u201d video to them rather than a \u201ccome out\u201d sort of thing. It\u2019s a community video where he\u2019ll use some of his experiences and eventually clarify some stuff.</p><p>Dan prepares his background for it. He writes a \u201cguess what?\u201d on the little square sign with the letters. He organizes stuff around, sets the lighting, places the camera and sits in front of it.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he looks back at the script on his macbook \u201cshit this will be harder than I expected\u201d. He feels like he\u2019s learning to film a scripted video all over again, Takes a deep breath in, and out\u2026and in, and out. Fine, once he starts he can do it, he\u2019s been doing it for years, just let go and\u2026he presses play.</p><p>-</p><p>(if you thought that I would attempt to write what Dan would say in a video like this, that he theoretically took more than a year and creative writing lessons to reach perfection for, then you thought wrong)</p><p>-</p><p>And pause. Stop.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s it\u201d.</p><p>Or maybe not.</p><p>There\u2019s still editing on the way, and uploading.</p><p>Then posting.</p><p>What will kill him first from the anxiety it caused? He should have accepted Phil\u2019s old idea and filmed it together. Or maybe not, it would seem weird. Or is it already weird by being him alone? What if while rewatching and editing it, Dan cringed so hard he died from that and not the anxiety? He decided right there that if he cringed even once he wouldn\u2019t post it. No, he\u2019s already cringing. There must be another way. He already wanted to delete the whole thing and only post a cryptic pic on instagram. On their wedding day. Where people couldn\u2019t be exactly sure what was happening but also magically know everything. And never talk about it again.</p><p>His thoughts were racing and he stood up, almost kicking the butt chair to the floor on his way, not even bothering to close or turning off anything. He grabbed his phone on his way to the kitchen and called Phil. Hopefully he wouldn\u2019t be too busy doing fun Florida stuff. He braced himself against the kitchen counter while waiting for his fianc\u00e9 to answer the call.</p><p>\u201cPhil!\u201d Dan said, before Phil could even place the phone by his ear. He only heard the end \u201c-il\u201d part of his name and he instantly knew what happened to cause Dan to call him on the phone so soon after he hung up a skype call on a confident smiling Daniel.</p><p>He had filmed the video. And he freaked out.</p><p>\u201cShhhh, it\u2019s alright\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo it\u2019s not, it\u2019s horrible and cringy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve read that script Dan, it was so good. There is no way it\u2019s any of these things.\u201d</p><p>He heard Dan trying to even his breathing.</p><p>\u201cHave you watched it yet?\u201d Phil asked, to understand what he was dealing with.</p><p>\u201cNo. I just finished filming\u2026I think I didn\u2019t even turn the lighting off.\u201d</p><p>Oh, so he freaked out in capital letters and many scared emojis.</p><p>\u201cRight. Do you want me to watch it first and see how it is?\u201d</p><p>Dan stayed silent for a while, ruminating on the possibility. After about ten seconds Dan let out a sigh.</p><p>\u201cNo? I don\u2019t know\u2026maybe? You\u2019re enjoying time with your family Phil, it\u2019s not fair to bring you back to these problems we willingly got into, you\u2019ll have enough shit to deal with when you come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see it as a problem. It\u2019s supposed to be freeing, the scary bits are just part of this new way we\u2019re heading to, but everything will be fine at the end. We will be able to lean over and kiss on a gaming channel video and won\u2019t have to cut it out\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will probably cut it out anyway\u201d Dan had a hint of laugh in his voice now. That was better.</p><p>\u201cWe probably will, but not with the feeling that this is some sort of dirty secret.\u201d Phil sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s not bothering me at all to help you with this. It\u2019s your mental health, Dan, I care about you and I want to be here for you when you need me, like I said many times. You are the first one putting you face out there, alone-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mentioned you\u201d Dan cut him off.</p><p>\u201cGood. But still, you wanted to film it alone, it\u2019s your face and only that. I\u2019m proud that you were brave enough to kick it first, but it also worries me a bit. You\u2019re freaking out already. And I don\u2019t want you to feel alone in this, because you\u2019re not. You\u2019re definitely not. I shouldn\u2019t have left you physically alone before it all to begin with-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked you to go while I stayed in London, Phil\u201d Dan said, emphasizing the \u2018I\u2019.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re geniuses\u201d Phil said. Dan could almost see Phil running a hand through his quiff, worrying over this whole thing. Dan didn\u2019t want to get him worked up over him and his malfunctioning hormone producing brain while he was spending time with his family. Phil kept talking. \u201cPlease send me what you filmed. The way it is, you don\u2019t even have to look at it too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, but I want to edit it. Just tell me if it\u2019s good or if I have to change anything, if I\u2019m too nervous or if it\u2019s-\u201c Dan was starting to speak faster already.</p><p>\u201cDan\u2026\u201d Phil interrupted him. \u201c\u2026Breath. Please don\u2019t go there again; it\u2019s going to be fine. And please send me the thing.\u201d</p><p>Dan chuckled \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll hang up now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright. Don\u2019t hesitate to call me again if you need\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Phil wasn\u2019t sure if this answer was about not hesitating or about calling back, but it was for Dan to decide at this point.</p><p>\u201cLove you\u201d he heard Dan say.</p><p>\u201cLove you too.\u201d</p><p>And they hang up.</p><p>-</p><p>He had sent the file to Phil, about 15 minutes ago.</p><p>And now he was sat on the couch, with eyes closed and head thrown back, trying to relax while he waited for Phil\u2019s verdict. Just the idea of his almost 28 year old self feeling nervous and expectant for Phil to give an input about a video he\u2019d just filmed and had the potential to change everything made him laugh at himself. Feels like a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, like he has been in this position before.</p><p>And he has.</p><p>The good nostalgia feeling fills him again, but this time it\u2019s a memory so far away he couldn\u2019t remember details. Waiting for Phil\u2019s opinion on Hello Internet was something else, entirely, though he could swear it felt the same right now. But does he remember that feeling? Of trying to impress Phil and only him, to get his approval on something, using his \u201cediting tips\u201d. There really were editing tips after all, but most of it was just plain flirting on his part.</p><p>Phil had approved of Hello Internet though, and look what happened. That thing is majestically cringy. Maybe he shouldn\u2019t trust Phil with that, he was the one that assured Dan that Hello Internet was GrEaT! The thought made Dan laugh though. They were still tip toeing around each other at this point, so madly in love and anxious to finally meet soon, all the possibilities opening new paths for them. Phil wouldn\u2019t think Hello Internet was cringy because he was in love and Dan knows love can blind your judgment sometimes.</p><p>He knows because he eventually paid a price for exposing himself online more than he wish he had. Again, it\u2019s so sad that their love life was publicly exposed, that they had to delete part of their history together on the internet. Dan can\u2019t even revisit their first interactions on twitter. But part of it was their own fault, actually. What were they thinking when they came up with that \u201cwe met through a mutual friend\u201d lie is beyond his comprehension now, but they surely thought there was something too telling about Dan being a fan and meeting Phil by being a massive fanboy on main.</p><p>Lying about it and later coming back to the original story was even more telling, but as always they just made a point of not addressing it. What would they say anyway? \u201cOh yeah, that time, funny story. You were being too much and we freaked out because I was in love with Phil from day one and it was too clear while I publicly flirted with him on twitter, so we pretended it was nothing much\u201d. No way, not then. Maybe at some point from now on they will be able to laugh with them at all those things they did\u2026now that it can be funny.</p><p>And let\u2019s be honest, the real version of it is way too good of a love story. Dan still remembered the feeling of getting a reply from Phil on twitter, and then another one a couple of days later. Felt accomplishing and exciting. Then Phil slid into his DM\u2019s and he was being all flirty. Suddenly it didn\u2019t feel so right and yet he reciprocated some of it. He had a girlfriend when he met Phil. It was ok when he was just silently confused and curious about that guy making videos for youtube, someone he virtually would never meet. It was completely different when Phil started do show interest back. He fell so hard for Phil, there was no stopping it. Like Loki falling for 30 minutes, Dan\u2019s been falling for 10 years, and had no desire for it to stop.</p><p>He obviously broke up with his girlfriend when he understood how dangerously in trouble he was. And then went off to meet Phil in Manchester. Oh when he met his now fianc\u00e9 in person, how they hugged like they were made to fit together, for so long in the middle of the train station with lots of people around, probably looking suspiciously at them sometimes. Probably, as Dan just wondered about it sometimes, because in that moment they didn\u2019t noticed or cared whether people were looking or not. Phil was there and Dan was hugging him, clutching at the back of his hoodie like his life depended on it, like Phil could vanish from his fingers if he didn\u2019t hold him tight enough.</p><p>They weren\u2019t officially dating yet \u2013 and by official he means between the two of them \u2013 but they\u2019ve been crossing lines on the flirting etiquette for a while at this point. Deep down they knew Dan wouldn\u2019t embark on that train back to Wokigham without some hickey marks around his clavicle and sweet promises in his mind.</p><p>He remembers that they filmed the first PINOF that week, such a delicious memory that is, the first Phil is Not on Fire. He can hardly believe it\u2019s over for good, by number ten. Oh so much happened during the filming of the first one, with the camera on, and after they turned it off. He still has the original footage saved somewhere. But Dan could remember so much of it with some many details that it\u2019s already making him feel hotter. Was it that long ago?</p><p>He felt his phone buzz by his side. Great, Phil finished watching it, time to have his ass dragged, maybe he\u2019ll forget about those terribly dirty memories.</p><p>He reached for his phone without looking. Who\u2019d be calling him at this time except someone in America? He answered with a grunt, which earned him a laugh from the other side.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been up and down with that mood of yours today, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh, don\u2019t even mention. Have you watched it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Wanna skype for that? I think it would be better if you look me in the eyes when I tell you it\u2019s perfect and you did a great job at it, as always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I trust you with that, though? You once told me Hello Internet was good and that I should post it. Then that shit happened.\u201d<br>They laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt became a classic, Dan. Come on\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor all the wrong reasons!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good first video. Have you seen mine? Hello Internet is art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust your concept of art now too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat hurt. My concept of art is flawless. Ask Corn.\u201d</p><p>Dan let out a bark laugh at that. Phil continued.</p><p>\u201cCan we skype, please. It\u2019s weird talking to you through the phone, it makes me anxious. I know I was the one that called you like this, but I had to know if you were still awake.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s fair. Dan couldn\u2019t blame him for feeling weird about talking through a regular call. Usually they only talk to each other like this when they\u2019re having a problem, when Dan is having a break down or something of the sort.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019d still be awake, do you think I\u2019d be able to sleep before having your input, luv? But I don\u2019t really trust myself to skype you right now, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026let\u2019s ay that I was here alone\u2026thinking about Phil is Not on Fire\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Phil sounded genuinely confused.</p><p>\u201cThe first one you spoon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026OH!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019re horny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now I\u2019m horny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting\u201d</p><p>At that, Dan heard the unmistakable sound of an incoming call on skype from his laptop.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nasty\u201d and hung up the phone call, then turned to answer the skype one.</p><p>The first thing Phil said when he appeared on the screen was \u201cthanks\u201d with that cheeky smile.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said wanking wasn\u2019t included in my alone time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh it definitely is!\u201d Dan laughed at that. \u201cI meant like, us doing it together. And it\u2019s up for you to decide at this point, love. You are already in the situation.\u201d</p><p>Oh Dan had decided, that\u2019s for sure.</p><p>_</p><p>\u201cFuck, why you do me like that?\u201d</p><p>Phil laughed at Dan\u2019s nonsensical post-orgasm mumbled question. He was definitely going to sleep after that.</p><p>\u201cYou started it. I just wanted to tell you that your video is good and you have nothing to worry about.\u201d Phil said while distracted cleaning his hand with some tissue paper. \u201cThere are actually not many mistakes to cut out, you went pretty straight with it\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was nothing straight about that video, Phil. If there was, then I missed my point\u201d</p><p>Phil laughed and rolled his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re insufferable. You know what I meant, you went pretty NOT straight with it, in the most accurate way possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Not much to edit, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, some cuts here and there, in long pauses and that, some effects that you pointed out and might want to add, artistic decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-hum\u201d It was Dan\u2019s turn to be distracted, looking down. \u201cYikes, my pajama is moist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo change\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s alright. I\u2019ll have take a bath before going to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He said, while he lifted the waist band to put some space between the clammy fabric and his skin.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026when are you planning to post the video?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext month, probably. I\u2019ve filmed it, the hardest part is done. And I kept my plan from last year, seeing as it\u2019s already May. They\u2019ve waited this long, they can wait less than a month now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know how much more they\u2019ll have to wait, Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell sucks to be them I guess\u201d</p><p>\u201cDa-an!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he laughed \u201cI\u2019ll talk about it at some point before my birthday, so they\u2019ll know it\u2019s coming. But I\u2019ll post it only after my birthday, around the anniversary of the first time we talked. They are curious and extra, they will theorize and this time it\u2019s going to be it. Will be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvil mastermind. They\u2019ll love it. Give the people what they want!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh, don\u2019t say that. I\u2019m having war flashback now.\u201d</p><p>They snorted. When the laugh died, they stayed in silence for a bit. Dan looked sadly to his moist clothing, his eyes already looked droopy.</p><p>\u201cI have to go, love\u201d Phil said, even though he didn\u2019t really had to. He knew Dan would stay as long as Phil could, but someone had to compromise. His sleep schedule was already slightly ruined by their late night talks while Phil was in America, and they knew it was important for his mental health.</p><p>\u201cGo have your shower and a good night\u2019s sleep. You\u2019re almost asleep sitting in the middle of our living room\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry about that\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, it\u2019s good that you\u2019re not feeling like staying awake until you hear birds chirping outside\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess. Talk to you later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll move to Antarctica, to live with penguins. There\u2019s no internet there so-\u201c</p><p>\u201cOh shut up, bitch\u201d</p><p>Phil was laughing that laugh where he pokes his tongue off.</p><p>\u201cSorry. But I\u2019ll probably be embarking back to London when you wake up, so we\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright. Love you bub, have a good night\u2019s sleep\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too love. Bye.\u201d</p><p>And they disconnected.</p><p>_</p><p>Phil was right. When Dan woke up, he had some messages from Phil on his phone, telling him that he was embarking. Probably the internet on board was shit, or he was enjoying the last few hours with his parents for now, for he\u2019ll only see them again next month. He made a mental note to only talk to Phil if he messaged him first.</p><p>He moved to a sitting position on the bed and looked around. Dan wasn\u2019t used to sleeping alone anymore, but if he had to, he\u2019d use the whole bed, sleeping right in the middle because \u201cwhy not?\u201d right? There were pillows all around him, like a little fort, where he could hug them whenever through the night, if he needed.</p><p>As comfortable as it was, he terribly missed Phil already, even though they could talk all the time if they wanted, it wasn\u2019t the same. When you spend so much time together, you get used to the person, it\u2019s a happy habit, you grow addicted to people. There was no way they could move from this status anymore, it wouldn\u2019t be easy if they had any desire to do so.</p><p>Perhaps that\u2019s another something they did wrong while trying to keep their relationship hidden. Because it was easy and casual when Phil was living in an apartment he could share with someone and their audience was still very young. Or when they moved to London with little to no money, just a job perspective ahead, they had to share an apartment because they couldn\u2019t afford two.</p><p>But when things started to work out for them and nothing changed, when they moved to a bigger place together and absolutely nothing changed \u2013 and if it did it was that they\u2019ve got even closer after that \u2013 then it got weird. When part of their audience grew up and became adults with their own significant others, seeing them still living together after so many years became as clear as water from the source.</p><p>Because this section of their audience wasn\u2019t just wishful thinking, they were properly seeing real things there. When you live with someone for this long, you smooth the sides of your personality to fit in with the smoothen sides of the other person\u2019s own personality. You get used to their quirks, habits and little things. And you get used to having them around, like it\u2019s how life is in its natural form. Right now, Phil is not here and it feels weird. It\u2019s important for Dan to have his alone time, but Phil doesn\u2019t count. Or if he\u2019s feeling like being literally alone then Phil might as well be in the next room, Dan will feel his presence around, like it is home and it\u2019s warmer. Wherever Phil is, it\u2019s home.</p><p>He didn\u2019t go with Phil to America because it wasn\u2019t going to be just them. And even though he absolutely loved the Lesters, they do count as other people. They certainly are family and have welcomed him into their circle better than he expected. Just because Phil had known for a while that he felt attraction for man at the time, it didn\u2019t mean his family knew it too. Phil handled it all so naturally, though. Dan on the other hand was scared shitless, everything his parents knew was that Dan had just broken up a long term relationship with a girl, and even though bi and pan sexuality are real, people tend to forget that.</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t want to dwell on the aftermath of his \u201ccoming out\u201d to his family anymore. It had plagued him for years, but he mended it with Phil\u2019s help and some therapy, as much as he could. As their career took off and they gained more audience and opportunity, things started get easier with his family.</p><p>But Phil\u2019s family had received him with open arms from the beginning, treating his like as much of a Lester as anyone of them. That\u2019s why Dan had decided to add Phil\u2019s surname to his own. \u201cDaniel James Howell-Lester\u201d sounded great to his ears. Not excluding his own name, but adding Phil\u2019s.</p><p>This thought led him to the wedding planning ideas. He had some calls to make, some stuff to research, still. It was the next big thing to do. Maybe the wedding stuff had held him back on the script writing for a while, but he didn\u2019t regret it. Planning a wedding was stressful, yes, but they\u2019ve planned two world tours so far, which made \u201cwedding planning\u201d sound like a kid\u2019s game. After Interactive Introverts Dan decided to relax a bit, so if he felt like hiring someone to help them and handle all this stuff he would jump right into it, but once he started he felt like he could do it, it was good, kept his mind busy but not overwhelmed. So far so good, flowing smoothly and inside the schedule.</p><p>There was no reason to wait more. Phil didn\u2019t propose just because he felt like they were together for long enough, he did it because he wanted to get married already. They already lived like a married couple, so not much would change in their day to day life. They will officially refer to each other as \u201cmy husband\u201d and they refuse keep going with the \u201conly friends\u201d anymore. That\u2019s a massive change once you let it out of the secrecy of your own home. There will also be some great memories to treasure forever of the day they swore their love for each other. That\u2019s ridiculously sweet, but true.</p><p>The business part of their life though, that will change a lot. How they deal with their shared businesses, their taxes, and even Dan\u2019s signature in those papers will have to be updated. They would never take this step if they didn\u2019t intend to come clear with their audience about it, because the business side of their lives was very much public and of easy access to anyone.</p><p>Dan grabbed his laptop from his side \u2013 he had taken it with him back from the living room last night and written some ideas down until he felt like he couldn\u2019t keep his eyes open \u2013 and his phone from the other and started to call places and schedule visits. They weren\u2019t visiting locations yet, they didn\u2019t want to be seen there together, it would ruin the damn surprise. They were deliberately blindsiding their audience. Their audience sort of knew, but maybe, by staying silent, they might slightly doubt it too. Was it mean? Probably. But that\u2019s what they deserve.</p><p>After he finished this bit, he went through the bakeries. That was important, not only to look pretty but for that cake to be delicious. They love their food, but mostly when it comes to the desert. They had narrowed the bakeries down to the ones they knew and loved, each one had their number one favorite flavors. Thinking about food just reminded him of the fact that he hadn\u2019t eaten yet. Shit. Dan looked at his phone, 11:30 am. Again, shit. If it\u2019s this late, he might as well get some lunch delivered. He grabbed back him phone and noticed a new message. From Phil.</p><p>They talked a bit about nothing, then about something weird Phil did at the airport \u2013 he, in fact, attracts crazy people, they had concluded \u2013 and how he thought he had seen Sam the Surfer again, but he wasn\u2019t sure, so it didn\u2019t count in Dan\u2019s opinion. Phil also informed that there would take just a couple more hours until he was home. Good, Dan was missing him a bit too much for his liking today.</p><p>Dan had a vegan healthy snack delivered for lunch. Phil was a bad meat-fluence in his eating sometimes, so when he was away Dan took the opportunity to try and eat less food of animal origin. It made him feel good whenever he accomplished a whole day without any meat, dairy or eggs. Sometimes Dan would get Phil into it, sometimes each one chose a thing to eat at the same place, so Dan could stay inside his guidelines and Phil would go off on his stuff. But when it was food for sharing, like a pizza, it was hard to say no to stuff he already liked.</p><p>He happily eat his vegan meal from the new place his brother had recommended to him. It was fucking delicious, indeed. Then he decided to just turn off his brain until Phil was home, by playing some Guild Wars II, of course.</p><p>_</p><p>Phil arrived home some hours later. He had messaged Dan when he landed, but got no response all the way back home. Dan was probably deep into some videogame, for not looking through his phone for the last hour at least. Phil wasn\u2019t too worried, he had seen this behavior before in two scenarios. It\u2019s been some months since Dan had left the house without his phone during a crisis, but they are heading to uncharted situation now, so who know? But he wanted to believe that it was more likely that he was playing.</p><p>When he walked up the stairs to the living room and saw Dan sprawled on the couch playing Guild Wars II, he definitely threw any doubt through the window. He entered Dan\u2019s view, and Dan jerked up on reflex. Like, how scared Dan would be if someone entered their apartment before he noticed it was Phil.</p><p>\u201cPhiiiil!\u201d Dan shrieked annoyed and amused at the same time.</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d Phil had that tongue-poking smile of his. \u201cI tried to tell you I was home, but you didn\u2019t answer my messages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas it really been this long?\u201d He grabbed his phone, whilst still trying to keep playing properly, he wasn\u2019t finished with his gaming. \u201cDamn, what?\u201d Yes, it has been this long.</p><p>Phil got closer to him and placed a kiss to his temple. Dan turned his face and gave him a peck on the lips. \u201cHi\u201d he smiled.</p><p>\u201cHey you\u201d, Phil answered. \u201cI\u2019ll go undo my luggage, put some clothes to wash and leave you alone a bit more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just finish here and I\u2019ll come for you\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Phil had a sly grin on now. That smile alone made Dan sound dirtier than intended.</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up you dirty bitch. I can\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>Phil was properly laughing now. \u201cCome for me later then\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that, I\u2019ve been without sex for too long now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. What a coincidence, Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say.\u201d Dan talked, but with his eyes glued to his game.\u201dThat\u2019s really a weird coincidence. We should do something about that.\u201d He says, as he seems to finish whatever he\u2019s doing, because he takes his laptop and put it aside, then grab Phil to his lap.</p><p>Phil noticed what Dan intended, and before he could fall awkwardly on his fianc\u00e9\u2019s lap and risking hurting him, he turned and lifted one leg, andd placed it by Dan\u2019s side, falling on his knees, on each side of the younger man\u2019s hips, and sitting right on his crotch.</p><p>The older man grabbed Dan\u2019s hands, intertwined their fingers and pushed them above Dan\u2019s head, while he lowered his body, gluing every inch he could to the other man\u2019s body. Phil wanted to savor Dan\u2019s delicious smell that he missed so much, and went right for his neck, kissing, nibbling and slightly biting it. He got Dan panting already, while he moved to under his ear, then the jaw, cheek, and then he finally found his mouth.</p><p>Phil let go of Dan\u2019s hands in favor of sliding it under his shirt, savoring slowly every inch of his skin, tantalizing with the tip of his fingers, on the brink of becoming ticklish. Dan, on his part, used his new found freedom to grab his fianc\u00e9 through the waist, pulling him closer and place the other hand on his neck, tangling his fingers in short locks of hair. Then, slightly, he pulled Phil\u2019s hair until they stopped kissing and Dan could look him in the eyes.</p><p>Phil\u2019s lips were very much red from kissing, and he could already feel how happy Dan was to see him, as he was grinding down against him.<br>\u201cOh god\u201d Phil buckled forward, he was losing track of his thoughts way too fast.</p><p>Dan shushed Phil while he kept pulling the hair on the back of the other man\u2019s head, and kissing down his neck, over Adam\u2019s apple.</p><p>\u201cI missed you so much\u201d Phil murmured.</p><p>\u201cPhil\u201d Dan said as he let go of him and started to unbuckle his belt \u201cShush. Now\u2026 please fuck me.\u201d</p>",

He added a direct mention at Phil\u2019s name in one of the last jokes on the script. He learned last year that if he wants to get their attention focused on something, it should peak at the end of the video - as if they wouldn\u2019t focus on this particular bit even if he put it in a small comic sans writing on the bottom left of his video for a brief second at the beginning. They would eventually find it and freak out, their audience is like that sometimes, he knows and appreciates how fucking weird and dedicated they are.</p><p>It slightly worried him that people might label it as a coming out video. It\u2019s not. At least Dan doesn\u2019t see it like that; he doesn\u2019t want it to be. He never saw himself making a coming out video, he thinks they\u2019re already as out and they could be. There are no labels to be put there, Dan\u2019s just not heterosexual and he thinks he\u2019s made it pretty clear so far. He just wants to be officially there for people. Like with his depression video, after he talked about it, he felt like he could help and make a difference. This time it\u2019s another thing completely, but the feeling is there.</p><p>The mainstream media might be stronger about calling it coming out video. Another gay youtuber, even though he wouldn\u2019t label himself as gay. A non-straight guy in a homosexual relationship, it\u2019s more about it, but that\u2019s too complicated for a headline written by someone that doesn\u2019t care. So why should he care?</p><p>Their fanbase on the other hand, they know. It\u2019s more of a \u201ccoming clear\u201d video to them rather than a \u201ccome out\u201d sort of thing. It\u2019s a community video where he\u2019ll use some of his experiences and eventually clarify some stuff.</p><p>Dan prepares his background for it. He writes a \u201cguess what?\u201d on the little square sign with the letters. He organizes stuff around, sets the lighting, places the camera and sits in front of it.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he looks back at the script on his macbook \u201cshit this will be harder than I expected\u201d. He feels like he\u2019s learning to film a scripted video all over again, Takes a deep breath in, and out\u2026and in, and out. Fine, once he starts he can do it, he\u2019s been doing it for years, just let go and\u2026he presses play.</p><p>-</p><p>(if you thought that I would attempt to write what Dan would say in a video like this, that he theoretically took more than a year and creative writing lessons to reach perfection for, then you thought wrong)</p><p>-</p><p>And pause. Stop.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s it\u201d.</p><p>Or maybe not.</p><p>There\u2019s still editing on the way, and uploading.</p><p>Then posting.</p><p>What will kill him first from the anxiety it caused? He should have accepted Phil\u2019s old idea and filmed it together. Or maybe not, it would seem weird. Or is it already weird by being him alone? What if while rewatching and editing it, Dan cringed so hard he died from that and not the anxiety? He decided right there that if he cringed even once he wouldn\u2019t post it. No, he\u2019s already cringing. There must be another way. He already wanted to delete the whole thing and only post a cryptic pic on instagram. On their wedding day. Where people couldn\u2019t be exactly sure what was happening but also magically know everything. And never talk about it again.</p><p>His thoughts were racing and he stood up, almost kicking the butt chair to the floor on his way, not even bothering to close or turning off anything. He grabbed his phone on his way to the kitchen and called Phil. Hopefully he wouldn\u2019t be too busy doing fun Florida stuff. He braced himself against the kitchen counter while waiting for his fianc\u00e9 to answer the call.</p><p>\u201cPhil!\u201d Dan said, before Phil could even place the phone by his ear. He only heard the end \u201c-il\u201d part of his name and he instantly knew what happened to cause Dan to call him on the phone so soon after he hung up a skype call on a confident smiling Daniel.</p><p>He had filmed the video. And he freaked out.</p><p>\u201cShhhh, it\u2019s alright\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo it\u2019s not, it\u2019s horrible and cringy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve read that script Dan, it was so good. There is no way it\u2019s any of these things.\u201d</p><p>He heard Dan trying to even his breathing.</p><p>\u201cHave you watched it yet?\u201d Phil asked, to understand what he was dealing with.</p><p>\u201cNo. I just finished filming\u2026I think I didn\u2019t even turn the lighting off.\u201d</p><p>Oh, so he freaked out in capital letters and many scared emojis.</p><p>\u201cRight. Do you want me to watch it first and see how it is?\u201d</p><p>Dan stayed silent for a while, ruminating on the possibility. After about ten seconds Dan let out a sigh.</p><p>\u201cNo? I don\u2019t know\u2026maybe? You\u2019re enjoying time with your family Phil, it\u2019s not fair to bring you back to these problems we willingly got into, you\u2019ll have enough shit to deal with when you come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see it as a problem. It\u2019s supposed to be freeing, the scary bits are just part of this new way we\u2019re heading to, but everything will be fine at the end. We will be able to lean over and kiss on a gaming channel video and won\u2019t have to cut it out\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will probably cut it out anyway\u201d Dan had a hint of laugh in his voice now. That was better.</p><p>\u201cWe probably will, but not with the feeling that this is some sort of dirty secret.\u201d Phil sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s not bothering me at all to help you with this. It\u2019s your mental health, Dan, I care about you and I want to be here for you when you need me, like I said many times. You are the first one putting you face out there, alone-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mentioned you\u201d Dan cut him off.</p><p>\u201cGood. But still, you wanted to film it alone, it\u2019s your face and only that. I\u2019m proud that you were brave enough to kick it first, but it also worries me a bit. You\u2019re freaking out already. And I don\u2019t want you to feel alone in this, because you\u2019re not. You\u2019re definitely not. I shouldn\u2019t have left you physically alone before it all to begin with-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked you to go while I stayed in London, Phil\u201d Dan said, emphasizing the \u2018I\u2019.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re geniuses\u201d Phil said. Dan could almost see Phil running a hand through his quiff, worrying over this whole thing. Dan didn\u2019t want to get him worked up over him and his malfunctioning hormone producing brain while he was spending time with his family. Phil kept talking. \u201cPlease send me what you filmed. The way it is, you don\u2019t even have to look at it too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, but I want to edit it. Just tell me if it\u2019s good or if I have to change anything, if I\u2019m too nervous or if it\u2019s-\u201c Dan was starting to speak faster already.</p><p>\u201cDan\u2026\u201d Phil interrupted him. \u201c\u2026Breath. Please don\u2019t go there again; it\u2019s going to be fine. And please send me the thing.\u201d</p><p>Dan chuckled \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll hang up now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright. Don\u2019t hesitate to call me again if you need\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Phil wasn\u2019t sure if this answer was about not hesitating or about calling back, but it was for Dan to decide at this point.</p><p>\u201cLove you\u201d he heard Dan say.</p><p>\u201cLove you too.\u201d</p><p>And they hang up.</p><p>-</p><p>He had sent the file to Phil, about 15 minutes ago.</p><p>And now he was sat on the couch, with eyes closed and head thrown back, trying to relax while he waited for Phil\u2019s verdict. Just the idea of his almost 28 year old self feeling nervous and expectant for Phil to give an input about a video he\u2019d just filmed and had the potential to change everything made him laugh at himself. Feels like a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, like he has been in this position before.</p><p>And he has.</p><p>The good nostalgia feeling fills him again, but this time it\u2019s a memory so far away he couldn\u2019t remember details. Waiting for Phil\u2019s opinion on Hello Internet was something else, entirely, though he could swear it felt the same right now. But does he remember that feeling? Of trying to impress Phil and only him, to get his approval on something, using his \u201cediting tips\u201d. There really were editing tips after all, but most of it was just plain flirting on his part.</p><p>Phil had approved of Hello Internet though, and look what happened. That thing is majestically cringy. Maybe he shouldn\u2019t trust Phil with that, he was the one that assured Dan that Hello Internet was GrEaT! The thought made Dan laugh though. They were still tip toeing around each other at this point, so madly in love and anxious to finally meet soon, all the possibilities opening new paths for them. Phil wouldn\u2019t think Hello Internet was cringy because he was in love and Dan knows love can blind your judgment sometimes.</p><p>He knows because he eventually paid a price for exposing himself online more than he wish he had. Again, it\u2019s so sad that their love life was publicly exposed, that they had to delete part of their history together on the internet. Dan can\u2019t even revisit their first interactions on twitter. But part of it was their own fault, actually. What were they thinking when they came up with that \u201cwe met through a mutual friend\u201d lie is beyond his comprehension now, but they surely thought there was something too telling about Dan being a fan and meeting Phil by being a massive fanboy on main.</p><p>Lying about it and later coming back to the original story was even more telling, but as always they just made a point of not addressing it. What would they say anyway? \u201cOh yeah, that time, funny story. You were being too much and we freaked out because I was in love with Phil from day one and it was too clear while I publicly flirted with him on twitter, so we pretended it was nothing much\u201d. No way, not then. Maybe at some point from now on they will be able to laugh with them at all those things they did\u2026now that it can be funny.</p><p>And let\u2019s be honest, the real version of it is way too good of a love story. Dan still remembered the feeling of getting a reply from Phil on twitter, and then another one a couple of days later. Felt accomplishing and exciting. Then Phil slid into his DM\u2019s and he was being all flirty. Suddenly it didn\u2019t feel so right and yet he reciprocated some of it. He had a girlfriend when he met Phil. It was ok when he was just silently confused and curious about that guy making videos for youtube, someone he virtually would never meet. It was completely different when Phil started do show interest back. He fell so hard for Phil, there was no stopping it. Like Loki falling for 30 minutes, Dan\u2019s been falling for 10 years, and had no desire for it to stop.</p><p>He obviously broke up with his girlfriend when he understood how dangerously in trouble he was. And then went off to meet Phil in Manchester. Oh when he met his now fianc\u00e9 in person, how they hugged like they were made to fit together, for so long in the middle of the train station with lots of people around, probably looking suspiciously at them sometimes. Probably, as Dan just wondered about it sometimes, because in that moment they didn\u2019t noticed or cared whether people were looking or not. Phil was there and Dan was hugging him, clutching at the back of his hoodie like his life depended on it, like Phil could vanish from his fingers if he didn\u2019t hold him tight enough.</p><p>They weren\u2019t officially dating yet \u2013 and by official he means between the two of them \u2013 but they\u2019ve been crossing lines on the flirting etiquette for a while at this point. Deep down they knew Dan wouldn\u2019t embark on that train back to Wokigham without some hickey marks around his clavicle and sweet promises in his mind.</p><p>He remembers that they filmed the first PINOF that week, such a delicious memory that is, the first Phil is Not on Fire. He can hardly believe it\u2019s over for good, by number ten. Oh so much happened during the filming of the first one, with the camera on, and after they turned it off. He still has the original footage saved somewhere. But Dan could remember so much of it with some many details that it\u2019s already making him feel hotter. Was it that long ago?</p><p>He felt his phone buzz by his side. Great, Phil finished watching it, time to have his ass dragged, maybe he\u2019ll forget about those terribly dirty memories.</p><p>He reached for his phone without looking. Who\u2019d be calling him at this time except someone in America? He answered with a grunt, which earned him a laugh from the other side.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been up and down with that mood of yours today, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh, don\u2019t even mention. Have you watched it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Wanna skype for that? I think it would be better if you look me in the eyes when I tell you it\u2019s perfect and you did a great job at it, as always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I trust you with that, though? You once told me Hello Internet was good and that I should post it. Then that shit happened.\u201d<br>They laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt became a classic, Dan. Come on\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor all the wrong reasons!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good first video. Have you seen mine? Hello Internet is art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust your concept of art now too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat hurt. My concept of art is flawless. Ask Corn.\u201d</p><p>Dan let out a bark laugh at that. Phil continued.</p><p>\u201cCan we skype, please. It\u2019s weird talking to you through the phone, it makes me anxious. I know I was the one that called you like this, but I had to know if you were still awake.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s fair. Dan couldn\u2019t blame him for feeling weird about talking through a regular call. Usually they only talk to each other like this when they\u2019re having a problem, when Dan is having a break down or something of the sort.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019d still be awake, do you think I\u2019d be able to sleep before having your input, luv? But I don\u2019t really trust myself to skype you right now, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026let\u2019s ay that I was here alone\u2026thinking about Phil is Not on Fire\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Phil sounded genuinely confused.</p><p>\u201cThe first one you spoon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026OH!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019re horny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now I\u2019m horny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting\u201d</p><p>At that, Dan heard the unmistakable sound of an incoming call on skype from his laptop.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nasty\u201d and hung up the phone call, then turned to answer the skype one.</p><p>The first thing Phil said when he appeared on the screen was \u201cthanks\u201d with that cheeky smile.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said wanking wasn\u2019t included in my alone time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh it definitely is!\u201d Dan laughed at that. \u201cI meant like, us doing it together. And it\u2019s up for you to decide at this point, love. You are already in the situation.\u201d</p><p>Oh Dan had decided, that\u2019s for sure.</p><p>_</p><p>\u201cFuck, why you do me like that?\u201d</p><p>Phil laughed at Dan\u2019s nonsensical post-orgasm mumbled question. He was definitely going to sleep after that.</p><p>\u201cYou started it. I just wanted to tell you that your video is good and you have nothing to worry about.\u201d Phil said while distracted cleaning his hand with some tissue paper. \u201cThere are actually not many mistakes to cut out, you went pretty straight with it\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was nothing straight about that video, Phil. If there was, then I missed my point\u201d</p><p>Phil laughed and rolled his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re insufferable. You know what I meant, you went pretty NOT straight with it, in the most accurate way possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Not much to edit, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, some cuts here and there, in long pauses and that, some effects that you pointed out and might want to add, artistic decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-hum\u201d It was Dan\u2019s turn to be distracted, looking down. \u201cYikes, my pajama is moist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo change\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s alright. I\u2019ll have take a bath before going to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He said, while he lifted the waist band to put some space between the clammy fabric and his skin.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026when are you planning to post the video?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext month, probably. I\u2019ve filmed it, the hardest part is done. And I kept my plan from last year, seeing as it\u2019s already May. They\u2019ve waited this long, they can wait less than a month now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know how much more they\u2019ll have to wait, Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell sucks to be them I guess\u201d</p><p>\u201cDa-an!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he laughed \u201cI\u2019ll talk about it at some point before my birthday, so they\u2019ll know it\u2019s coming. But I\u2019ll post it only after my birthday, around the anniversary of the first time we talked. They are curious and extra, they will theorize and this time it\u2019s going to be it. Will be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvil mastermind. They\u2019ll love it. Give the people what they want!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh, don\u2019t say that. I\u2019m having war flashback now.\u201d</p><p>They snorted. When the laugh died, they stayed in silence for a bit. Dan looked sadly to his moist clothing, his eyes already looked droopy.</p><p>\u201cI have to go, love\u201d Phil said, even though he didn\u2019t really had to. He knew Dan would stay as long as Phil could, but someone had to compromise. His sleep schedule was already slightly ruined by their late night talks while Phil was in America, and they knew it was important for his mental health.</p><p>\u201cGo have your shower and a good night\u2019s sleep. You\u2019re almost asleep sitting in the middle of our living room\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry about that\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, it\u2019s good that you\u2019re not feeling like staying awake until you hear birds chirping outside\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess. Talk to you later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll move to Antarctica, to live with penguins. There\u2019s no internet there so-\u201c</p><p>\u201cOh shut up, bitch\u201d</p><p>Phil was laughing that laugh where he pokes his tongue off.</p><p>\u201cSorry. But I\u2019ll probably be embarking back to London when you wake up, so we\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright. Love you bub, have a good night\u2019s sleep\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too love. Bye.\u201d</p><p>And they disconnected.</p><p>_</p><p>Phil was right. When Dan woke up, he had some messages from Phil on his phone, telling him that he was embarking. Probably the internet on board was shit, or he was enjoying the last few hours with his parents for now, for he\u2019ll only see them again next month. He made a mental note to only talk to Phil if he messaged him first.</p><p>He moved to a sitting position on the bed and looked around. Dan wasn\u2019t used to sleeping alone anymore, but if he had to, he\u2019d use the whole bed, sleeping right in the middle because \u201cwhy not?\u201d right? There were pillows all around him, like a little fort, where he could hug them whenever through the night, if he needed.</p><p>As comfortable as it was, he terribly missed Phil already, even though they could talk all the time if they wanted, it wasn\u2019t the same. When you spend so much time together, you get used to the person, it\u2019s a happy habit, you grow addicted to people. There was no way they could move from this status anymore, it wouldn\u2019t be easy if they had any desire to do so.</p><p>Perhaps that\u2019s another something they did wrong while trying to keep their relationship hidden. Because it was easy and casual when Phil was living in an apartment he could share with someone and their audience was still very young. Or when they moved to London with little to no money, just a job perspective ahead, they had to share an apartment because they couldn\u2019t afford two.</p><p>But when things started to work out for them and nothing changed, when they moved to a bigger place together and absolutely nothing changed \u2013 and if it did it was that they\u2019ve got even closer after that \u2013 then it got weird. When part of their audience grew up and became adults with their own significant others, seeing them still living together after so many years became as clear as water from the source.</p><p>Because this section of their audience wasn\u2019t just wishful thinking, they were properly seeing real things there. When you live with someone for this long, you smooth the sides of your personality to fit in with the smoothen sides of the other person\u2019s own personality. You get used to their quirks, habits and little things. And you get used to having them around, like it\u2019s how life is in its natural form. Right now, Phil is not here and it feels weird. It\u2019s important for Dan to have his alone time, but Phil doesn\u2019t count. Or if he\u2019s feeling like being literally alone then Phil might as well be in the next room, Dan will feel his presence around, like it is home and it\u2019s warmer. Wherever Phil is, it\u2019s home.</p><p>He didn\u2019t go with Phil to America because it wasn\u2019t going to be just them. And even though he absolutely loved the Lesters, they do count as other people. They certainly are family and have welcomed him into their circle better than he expected. Just because Phil had known for a while that he felt attraction for man at the time, it didn\u2019t mean his family knew it too. Phil handled it all so naturally, though. Dan on the other hand was scared shitless, everything his parents knew was that Dan had just broken up a long term relationship with a girl, and even though bi and pan sexuality are real, people tend to forget that.</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t want to dwell on the aftermath of his \u201ccoming out\u201d to his family anymore. It had plagued him for years, but he mended it with Phil\u2019s help and some therapy, as much as he could. As their career took off and they gained more audience and opportunity, things started get easier with his family.</p><p>But Phil\u2019s family had received him with open arms from the beginning, treating his like as much of a Lester as anyone of them. That\u2019s why Dan had decided to add Phil\u2019s surname to his own. \u201cDaniel James Howell-Lester\u201d sounded great to his ears. Not excluding his own name, but adding Phil\u2019s.</p><p>This thought led him to the wedding planning ideas. He had some calls to make, some stuff to research, still. It was the next big thing to do. Maybe the wedding stuff had held him back on the script writing for a while, but he didn\u2019t regret it. Planning a wedding was stressful, yes, but they\u2019ve planned two world tours so far, which made \u201cwedding planning\u201d sound like a kid\u2019s game. After Interactive Introverts Dan decided to relax a bit, so if he felt like hiring someone to help them and handle all this stuff he would jump right into it, but once he started he felt like he could do it, it was good, kept his mind busy but not overwhelmed. So far so good, flowing smoothly and inside the schedule.</p><p>There was no reason to wait more. Phil didn\u2019t propose just because he felt like they were together for long enough, he did it because he wanted to get married already. They already lived like a married couple, so not much would change in their day to day life. They will officially refer to each other as \u201cmy husband\u201d and they refuse keep going with the \u201conly friends\u201d anymore. That\u2019s a massive change once you let it out of the secrecy of your own home. There will also be some great memories to treasure forever of the day they swore their love for each other. That\u2019s ridiculously sweet, but true.</p><p>The business part of their life though, that will change a lot. How they deal with their shared businesses, their taxes, and even Dan\u2019s signature in those papers will have to be updated. They would never take this step if they didn\u2019t intend to come clear with their audience about it, because the business side of their lives was very much public and of easy access to anyone.</p><p>Dan grabbed his laptop from his side \u2013 he had taken it with him back from the living room last night and written some ideas down until he felt like he couldn\u2019t keep his eyes open \u2013 and his phone from the other and started to call places and schedule visits. They weren\u2019t visiting locations yet, they didn\u2019t want to be seen there together, it would ruin the damn surprise. They were deliberately blindsiding their audience. Their audience sort of knew, but maybe, by staying silent, they might slightly doubt it too. Was it mean? Probably. But that\u2019s what they deserve.</p><p>After he finished this bit, he went through the bakeries. That was important, not only to look pretty but for that cake to be delicious. They love their food, but mostly when it comes to the desert. They had narrowed the bakeries down to the ones they knew and loved, each one had their number one favorite flavors. Thinking about food just reminded him of the fact that he hadn\u2019t eaten yet. Shit. Dan looked at his phone, 11:30 am. Again, shit. If it\u2019s this late, he might as well get some lunch delivered. He grabbed back him phone and noticed a new message. From Phil.</p><p>They talked a bit about nothing, then about something weird Phil did at the airport \u2013 he, in fact, attracts crazy people, they had concluded \u2013 and how he thought he had seen Sam the Surfer again, but he wasn\u2019t sure, so it didn\u2019t count in Dan\u2019s opinion. Phil also informed that there would take just a couple more hours until he was home. Good, Dan was missing him a bit too much for his liking today.</p><p>Dan had a vegan healthy snack delivered for lunch. Phil was a bad meat-fluence in his eating sometimes, so when he was away Dan took the opportunity to try and eat less food of animal origin. It made him feel good whenever he accomplished a whole day without any meat, dairy or eggs. Sometimes Dan would get Phil into it, sometimes each one chose a thing to eat at the same place, so Dan could stay inside his guidelines and Phil would go off on his stuff. But when it was food for sharing, like a pizza, it was hard to say no to stuff he already liked.</p><p>He happily eat his vegan meal from the new place his brother had recommended to him. It was fucking delicious, indeed. Then he decided to just turn off his brain until Phil was home, by playing some Guild Wars II, of course.</p><p>_</p><p>Phil arrived home some hours later. He had messaged Dan when he landed, but got no response all the way back home. Dan was probably deep into some videogame, for not looking through his phone for the last hour at least. Phil wasn\u2019t too worried, he had seen this behavior before in two scenarios. It\u2019s been some months since Dan had left the house without his phone during a crisis, but they are heading to uncharted situation now, so who know? But he wanted to believe that it was more likely that he was playing.</p><p>When he walked up the stairs to the living room and saw Dan sprawled on the couch playing Guild Wars II, he definitely threw any doubt through the window. He entered Dan\u2019s view, and Dan jerked up on reflex. Like, how scared Dan would be if someone entered their apartment before he noticed it was Phil.</p><p>\u201cPhiiiil!\u201d Dan shrieked annoyed and amused at the same time.</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d Phil had that tongue-poking smile of his. \u201cI tried to tell you I was home, but you didn\u2019t answer my messages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas it really been this long?\u201d He grabbed his phone, whilst still trying to keep playing properly, he wasn\u2019t finished with his gaming. \u201cDamn, what?\u201d Yes, it has been this long.</p><p>Phil got closer to him and placed a kiss to his temple. Dan turned his face and gave him a peck on the lips. \u201cHi\u201d he smiled.</p><p>\u201cHey you\u201d, Phil answered. \u201cI\u2019ll go undo my luggage, put some clothes to wash and leave you alone a bit more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just finish here and I\u2019ll come for you\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Phil had a sly grin on now. That smile alone made Dan sound dirtier than intended.</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up you dirty bitch. I can\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>Phil was properly laughing now. \u201cCome for me later then\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that, I\u2019ve been without sex for too long now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. What a coincidence, Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say.\u201d Dan talked, but with his eyes glued to his game.\u201dThat\u2019s really a weird coincidence. We should do something about that.\u201d He says, as he seems to finish whatever he\u2019s doing, because he takes his laptop and put it aside, then grab Phil to his lap.</p><p>Phil noticed what Dan intended, and before he could fall awkwardly on his fianc\u00e9\u2019s lap and risking hurting him, he turned and lifted one leg, andd placed it by Dan\u2019s side, falling on his knees, on each side of the younger man\u2019s hips, and sitting right on his crotch.</p><p>The older man grabbed Dan\u2019s hands, intertwined their fingers and pushed them above Dan\u2019s head, while he lowered his body, gluing every inch he could to the other man\u2019s body. Phil wanted to savor Dan\u2019s delicious smell that he missed so much, and went right for his neck, kissing, nibbling and slightly biting it. He got Dan panting already, while he moved to under his ear, then the jaw, cheek, and then he finally found his mouth.</p><p>Phil let go of Dan\u2019s hands in favor of sliding it under his shirt, savoring slowly every inch of his skin, tantalizing with the tip of his fingers, on the brink of becoming ticklish. Dan, on his part, used his new found freedom to grab his fianc\u00e9 through the waist, pulling him closer and place the other hand on his neck, tangling his fingers in short locks of hair. Then, slightly, he pulled Phil\u2019s hair until they stopped kissing and Dan could look him in the eyes.</p><p>Phil\u2019s lips were very much red from kissing, and he could already feel how happy Dan was to see him, as he was grinding down against him.<br>\u201cOh god\u201d Phil buckled forward, he was losing track of his thoughts way too fast.</p><p>Dan shushed Phil while he kept pulling the hair on the back of the other man\u2019s head, and kissing down his neck, over Adam\u2019s apple.</p><p>\u201cI missed you so much\u201d Phil murmured.</p><p>\u201cPhil\u201d Dan said as he let go of him and started to unbuckle his belt \u201cShush. Now\u2026 please fuck me.\u201d</p>",
                "content": "<p><b>\n\nChapter 2</b><br /><b>Rating:</b> Mature<br /><b>Relationships:</b> Dan Howell/Phil Lester<br /><b>Characters:</b> Dan Howell, Phil Lester<br /><b>Additional Tags: </b>Marriage Proposal, Domestic Fluff, Implied/Referenced Homophobia, Mental Health Issues<br /><b>Summary:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;Dan decided that he would use the determination he had just found to film the damn video.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/18937387/chapters/45178519#workskin\">Read it on AO3</a></p><p>Dan decided that he would use the determination he had just found to film the damn video. He added a direct mention at Phil&rsquo;s name in one of the last jokes on the script. He learned last year that if he wants to get their attention focused on something, it should peak at the end of the video - as if they wouldn&rsquo;t focus on this particular bit even if he put it in a small comic sans writing on the bottom left of his video for a brief second at the beginning. They would eventually find it and freak out, their audience is like that sometimes, he knows and appreciates how fucking weird and dedicated they are.</p><p>It slightly worried him that people might label it as a coming out video. It&rsquo;s not. At least Dan doesn&rsquo;t see it like that; he doesn&rsquo;t want it to be. He never saw himself making a coming out video, he thinks they&rsquo;re already as out and they could be. There are no labels to be put there, Dan&rsquo;s just not heterosexual and he thinks he&rsquo;s made it pretty clear so far. He just wants to be officially there for people. Like with his depression video, after he talked about it, he felt like he could help and make a difference. This time it&rsquo;s another thing completely, but the feeling is there.</p><p>The mainstream media might be stronger about calling it coming out video. Another gay youtuber, even though he wouldn&rsquo;t label himself as gay. A non-straight guy in a homosexual relationship, it&rsquo;s more about it, but that&rsquo;s too complicated for a headline written by someone that doesn&rsquo;t care. So why should he care?</p><p>Their fanbase on the other hand, they know. It&rsquo;s more of a &ldquo;coming clear&rdquo; video to them rather than a &ldquo;come out&rdquo; sort of thing. It&rsquo;s a community video where he&rsquo;ll use some of his experiences and eventually clarify some stuff.</p><p>Dan prepares his background for it. He writes a &ldquo;guess what?&rdquo; on the little square sign with the letters. He organizes stuff around, sets the lighting, places the camera and sits in front of it.</p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; he looks back at the script on his macbook &ldquo;shit this will be harder than I expected&rdquo;. He feels like he&rsquo;s learning to film a scripted video all over again, Takes a deep breath in, and out&hellip;and in, and out. Fine, once he starts he can do it, he&rsquo;s been doing it for years, just let go and&hellip;he presses play.</p><p>-</p><p>(if you thought that I would attempt to write what Dan would say in a video like this, that he theoretically took more than a year and creative writing lessons to reach perfection for, then you thought wrong)</p><p>-</p><p>And pause. Stop.</p><p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s it&rdquo;.</p><p>Or maybe not.</p><p>There&rsquo;s still editing on the way, and uploading.</p><p>Then posting.</p><p>What will kill him first from the anxiety it caused? He should have accepted Phil&rsquo;s old idea and filmed it together. Or maybe not, it would seem weird. Or is it already weird by being him alone? What if while rewatching and editing it, Dan cringed so hard he died from that and not the anxiety? He decided right there that if he cringed even once he wouldn&rsquo;t post it. No, he&rsquo;s already cringing. There must be another way. He already wanted to delete the whole thing and only post a cryptic pic on instagram. On their wedding day. Where people couldn&rsquo;t be exactly sure what was happening but also magically know everything. And never talk about it again.</p><p>His thoughts were racing and he stood up, almost kicking the butt chair to the floor on his way, not even bothering to close or turning off anything. He grabbed his phone on his way to the kitchen and called Phil. Hopefully he wouldn&rsquo;t be too busy doing fun Florida stuff. He braced himself against the kitchen counter while waiting for his fianc&eacute; to answer the call.</p><p>&ldquo;Phil!&rdquo; Dan said, before Phil could even place the phone by his ear. He only heard the end &ldquo;-il&rdquo; part of his name and he instantly knew what happened to cause Dan to call him on the phone so soon after he hung up a skype call on a confident smiling Daniel.</p><p>He had filmed the video. And he freaked out.</p><p>&ldquo;Shhhh, it&rsquo;s alright&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s horrible and cringy!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read that script Dan, it was so good. There is no way it&rsquo;s any of these things.&rdquo;</p><p>He heard Dan trying to even his breathing.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you watched it yet?&rdquo; Phil asked, to understand what he was dealing with.</p><p>&ldquo;No. I just finished filming&hellip;I think I didn&rsquo;t even turn the lighting off.&rdquo;</p><p>Oh, so he freaked out in capital letters and many scared emojis.</p><p>&ldquo;Right. Do you want me to watch it first and see how it is?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan stayed silent for a while, ruminating on the possibility. After about ten seconds Dan let out a sigh.</p><p>&ldquo;No? I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;maybe? You&rsquo;re enjoying time with your family Phil, it&rsquo;s not fair to bring you back to these problems we willingly got into, you&rsquo;ll have enough shit to deal with when you come back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see it as a problem. It&rsquo;s supposed to be freeing, the scary bits are just part of this new way we&rsquo;re heading to, but everything will be fine at the end. We will be able to lean over and kiss on a gaming channel video and won&rsquo;t have to cut it out&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We will probably cut it out anyway&rdquo; Dan had a hint of laugh in his voice now. That was better.</p><p>&ldquo;We probably will, but not with the feeling that this is some sort of dirty secret.&rdquo; Phil sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not bothering me at all to help you with this. It&rsquo;s your mental health, Dan, I care about you and I want to be here for you when you need me, like I said many times. You are the first one putting you face out there, alone-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I mentioned you&rdquo; Dan cut him off.</p><p>&ldquo;Good. But still, you wanted to film it alone, it&rsquo;s your face and only that. I&rsquo;m proud that you were brave enough to kick it first, but it also worries me a bit. You&rsquo;re freaking out already. And I don&rsquo;t want you to feel alone in this, because you&rsquo;re not. You&rsquo;re definitely not. I shouldn&rsquo;t have left you physically alone before it all to begin with-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I asked you to go while I stayed in London, Phil&rdquo; Dan said, emphasizing the &lsquo;I&rsquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, we&rsquo;re geniuses&rdquo; Phil said. Dan could almost see Phil running a hand through his quiff, worrying over this whole thing. Dan didn&rsquo;t want to get him worked up over him and his malfunctioning hormone producing brain while he was spending time with his family. Phil kept talking. &ldquo;Please send me what you filmed. The way it is, you don&rsquo;t even have to look at it too much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok, but I want to edit it. Just tell me if it&rsquo;s good or if I have to change anything, if I&rsquo;m too nervous or if it&rsquo;s-&ldquo; Dan was starting to speak faster already.</p><p>&ldquo;Dan&hellip;&rdquo; Phil interrupted him. &ldquo;&hellip;Breath. Please don&rsquo;t go there again; it&rsquo;s going to be fine. And please send me the thing.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan chuckled &ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;ll do it. I&rsquo;ll hang up now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright. Don&rsquo;t hesitate to call me again if you need&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil wasn&rsquo;t sure if this answer was about not hesitating or about calling back, but it was for Dan to decide at this point.</p><p>&ldquo;Love you&rdquo; he heard Dan say.</p><p>&ldquo;Love you too.&rdquo;</p><p>And they hang up.</p><p>-</p><p>He had sent the file to Phil, about 15 minutes ago.</p><p>And now he was sat on the couch, with eyes closed and head thrown back, trying to relax while he waited for Phil&rsquo;s verdict. Just the idea of his almost 28 year old self feeling nervous and expectant for Phil to give an input about a video he&rsquo;d just filmed and had the potential to change everything made him laugh at himself. Feels like a d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, like he has been in this position before.</p><p>And he has.</p><p>The good nostalgia feeling fills him again, but this time it&rsquo;s a memory so far away he couldn&rsquo;t remember details. Waiting for Phil&rsquo;s opinion on Hello Internet was something else, entirely, though he could swear it felt the same right now. But does he remember that feeling? Of trying to impress Phil and only him, to get his approval on something, using his &ldquo;editing tips&rdquo;. There really were editing tips after all, but most of it was just plain flirting on his part.</p><p>Phil had approved of Hello Internet though, and look what happened. That thing is majestically cringy. Maybe he shouldn&rsquo;t trust Phil with that, he was the one that assured Dan that Hello Internet was GrEaT! The thought made Dan laugh though. They were still tip toeing around each other at this point, so madly in love and anxious to finally meet soon, all the possibilities opening new paths for them. Phil wouldn&rsquo;t think Hello Internet was cringy because he was in love and Dan knows love can blind your judgment sometimes.</p><p>He knows because he eventually paid a price for exposing himself online more than he wish he had. Again, it&rsquo;s so sad that their love life was publicly exposed, that they had to delete part of their history together on the internet. Dan can&rsquo;t even revisit their first interactions on twitter. But part of it was their own fault, actually. What were they thinking when they came up with that &ldquo;we met through a mutual friend&rdquo; lie is beyond his comprehension now, but they surely thought there was something too telling about Dan being a fan and meeting Phil by being a massive fanboy on main.</p><p>Lying about it and later coming back to the original story was even more telling, but as always they just made a point of not addressing it. What would they say anyway? &ldquo;Oh yeah, that time, funny story. You were being too much and we freaked out because I was in love with Phil from day one and it was too clear while I publicly flirted with him on twitter, so we pretended it was nothing much&rdquo;. No way, not then. Maybe at some point from now on they will be able to laugh with them at all those things they did&hellip;now that it can be funny.</p><p>And let&rsquo;s be honest, the real version of it is way too good of a love story. Dan still remembered the feeling of getting a reply from Phil on twitter, and then another one a couple of days later. Felt accomplishing and exciting. Then Phil slid into his DM&rsquo;s and he was being all flirty. Suddenly it didn&rsquo;t feel so right and yet he reciprocated some of it. He had a girlfriend when he met Phil. It was ok when he was just silently confused and curious about that guy making videos for youtube, someone he virtually would never meet. It was completely different when Phil started do show interest back. He fell so hard for Phil, there was no stopping it. Like Loki falling for 30 minutes, Dan&rsquo;s been falling for 10 years, and had no desire for it to stop.</p><p>He obviously broke up with his girlfriend when he understood how dangerously in trouble he was. And then went off to meet Phil in Manchester. Oh when he met his now fianc&eacute; in person, how they hugged like they were made to fit together, for so long in the middle of the train station with lots of people around, probably looking suspiciously at them sometimes. Probably, as Dan just wondered about it sometimes, because in that moment they didn&rsquo;t noticed or cared whether people were looking or not. Phil was there and Dan was hugging him, clutching at the back of his hoodie like his life depended on it, like Phil could vanish from his fingers if he didn&rsquo;t hold him tight enough.</p><p>They weren&rsquo;t officially dating yet &ndash; and by official he means between the two of them &ndash; but they&rsquo;ve been crossing lines on the flirting etiquette for a while at this point. Deep down they knew Dan wouldn&rsquo;t embark on that train back to Wokigham without some hickey marks around his clavicle and sweet promises in his mind.</p><p>He remembers that they filmed the first PINOF that week, such a delicious memory that is, the first Phil is Not on Fire. He can hardly believe it&rsquo;s over for good, by number ten. Oh so much happened during the filming of the first one, with the camera on, and after they turned it off. He still has the original footage saved somewhere. But Dan could remember so much of it with some many details that it&rsquo;s already making him feel hotter. Was it that long ago?</p><p>He felt his phone buzz by his side. Great, Phil finished watching it, time to have his ass dragged, maybe he&rsquo;ll forget about those terribly dirty memories.</p><p>He reached for his phone without looking. Who&rsquo;d be calling him at this time except someone in America? He answered with a grunt, which earned him a laugh from the other side.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been up and down with that mood of yours today, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh, don&rsquo;t even mention. Have you watched it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Wanna skype for that? I think it would be better if you look me in the eyes when I tell you it&rsquo;s perfect and you did a great job at it, as always.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Should I trust you with that, though? You once told me Hello Internet was good and that I should post it. Then that shit happened.&rdquo;<br />They laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;It became a classic, Dan. Come on&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For all the wrong reasons!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good first video. Have you seen mine? Hello Internet is art.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust your concept of art now too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That hurt. My concept of art is flawless. Ask Corn.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan let out a bark laugh at that. Phil continued.</p><p>&ldquo;Can we skype, please. It&rsquo;s weird talking to you through the phone, it makes me anxious. I know I was the one that called you like this, but I had to know if you were still awake.&rdquo;</p><p>That&rsquo;s fair. Dan couldn&rsquo;t blame him for feeling weird about talking through a regular call. Usually they only talk to each other like this when they&rsquo;re having a problem, when Dan is having a break down or something of the sort.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;d still be awake, do you think I&rsquo;d be able to sleep before having your input, luv? But I don&rsquo;t really trust myself to skype you right now, though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;let&rsquo;s ay that I was here alone&hellip;thinking about Phil is Not on Fire&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Phil sounded genuinely confused.</p><p>&ldquo;The first one you spoon!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip;OH!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And now you&rsquo;re horny.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And now I&rsquo;m horny.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Interesting&rdquo;</p><p>At that, Dan heard the unmistakable sound of an incoming call on skype from his laptop.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re nasty&rdquo; and hung up the phone call, then turned to answer the skype one.</p><p>The first thing Phil said when he appeared on the screen was &ldquo;thanks&rdquo; with that cheeky smile.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you said wanking wasn&rsquo;t included in my alone time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh it definitely is!&rdquo; Dan laughed at that. &ldquo;I meant like, us doing it together. And it&rsquo;s up for you to decide at this point, love. You are already in the situation.&rdquo;</p><p>Oh Dan had decided, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p><p>_</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, why you do me like that?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil laughed at Dan&rsquo;s nonsensical post-orgasm mumbled question. He was definitely going to sleep after that.</p><p>&ldquo;You started it. I just wanted to tell you that your video is good and you have nothing to worry about.&rdquo; Phil said while distracted cleaning his hand with some tissue paper. &ldquo;There are actually not many mistakes to cut out, you went pretty straight with it&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There was nothing straight about that video, Phil. If there was, then I missed my point&rdquo;</p><p>Phil laughed and rolled his eyes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re insufferable. You know what I meant, you went pretty NOT straight with it, in the most accurate way possible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good. Not much to edit, then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, some cuts here and there, in long pauses and that, some effects that you pointed out and might want to add, artistic decisions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh-hum&rdquo; It was Dan&rsquo;s turn to be distracted, looking down. &ldquo;Yikes, my pajama is moist.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go change&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nah, it&rsquo;s alright. I&rsquo;ll have take a bath before going to sleep.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You sure?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; He said, while he lifted the waist band to put some space between the clammy fabric and his skin.</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip;when are you planning to post the video?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Next month, probably. I&rsquo;ve filmed it, the hardest part is done. And I kept my plan from last year, seeing as it&rsquo;s already May. They&rsquo;ve waited this long, they can wait less than a month now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t know how much more they&rsquo;ll have to wait, Dan.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well sucks to be them I guess&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Da-an!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he laughed &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk about it at some point before my birthday, so they&rsquo;ll know it&rsquo;s coming. But I&rsquo;ll post it only after my birthday, around the anniversary of the first time we talked. They are curious and extra, they will theorize and this time it&rsquo;s going to be it. Will be fun.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Evil mastermind. They&rsquo;ll love it. Give the people what they want!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh, don&rsquo;t say that. I&rsquo;m having war flashback now.&rdquo;</p><p>They snorted. When the laugh died, they stayed in silence for a bit. Dan looked sadly to his moist clothing, his eyes already looked droopy.</p><p>&ldquo;I have to go, love&rdquo; Phil said, even though he didn&rsquo;t really had to. He knew Dan would stay as long as Phil could, but someone had to compromise. His sleep schedule was already slightly ruined by their late night talks while Phil was in America, and they knew it was important for his mental health.</p><p>&ldquo;Go have your shower and a good night&rsquo;s sleep. You&rsquo;re almost asleep sitting in the middle of our living room&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry about that&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be sorry, it&rsquo;s good that you&rsquo;re not feeling like staying awake until you hear birds chirping outside&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I guess. Talk to you later?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ll move to Antarctica, to live with penguins. There&rsquo;s no internet there so-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh shut up, bitch&rdquo;</p><p>Phil was laughing that laugh where he pokes his tongue off.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry. But I&rsquo;ll probably be embarking back to London when you wake up, so we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright. Love you bub, have a good night&rsquo;s sleep&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You too love. Bye.&rdquo;</p><p>And they disconnected.</p><p>_</p><p>Phil was right. When Dan woke up, he had some messages from Phil on his phone, telling him that he was embarking. Probably the internet on board was shit, or he was enjoying the last few hours with his parents for now, for he&rsquo;ll only see them again next month. He made a mental note to only talk to Phil if he messaged him first.</p><p>He moved to a sitting position on the bed and looked around. Dan wasn&rsquo;t used to sleeping alone anymore, but if he had to, he&rsquo;d use the whole bed, sleeping right in the middle because &ldquo;why not?&rdquo; right? There were pillows all around him, like a little fort, where he could hug them whenever through the night, if he needed.</p><p>As comfortable as it was, he terribly missed Phil already, even though they could talk all the time if they wanted, it wasn&rsquo;t the same. When you spend so much time together, you get used to the person, it&rsquo;s a happy habit, you grow addicted to people. There was no way they could move from this status anymore, it wouldn&rsquo;t be easy if they had any desire to do so.</p><p>Perhaps that&rsquo;s another something they did wrong while trying to keep their relationship hidden. Because it was easy and casual when Phil was living in an apartment he could share with someone and their audience was still very young. Or when they moved to London with little to no money, just a job perspective ahead, they had to share an apartment because they couldn&rsquo;t afford two.</p><p>But when things started to work out for them and nothing changed, when they moved to a bigger place together and absolutely nothing changed &ndash; and if it did it was that they&rsquo;ve got even closer after that &ndash; then it got weird. When part of their audience grew up and became adults with their own significant others, seeing them still living together after so many years became as clear as water from the source.</p><p>Because this section of their audience wasn&rsquo;t just wishful thinking, they were properly seeing real things there. When you live with someone for this long, you smooth the sides of your personality to fit in with the smoothen sides of the other person&rsquo;s own personality. You get used to their quirks, habits and little things. And you get used to having them around, like it&rsquo;s how life is in its natural form. Right now, Phil is not here and it feels weird. It&rsquo;s important for Dan to have his alone time, but Phil doesn&rsquo;t count. Or if he&rsquo;s feeling like being literally alone then Phil might as well be in the next room, Dan will feel his presence around, like it is home and it&rsquo;s warmer. Wherever Phil is, it&rsquo;s home.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t go with Phil to America because it wasn&rsquo;t going to be just them. And even though he absolutely loved the Lesters, they do count as other people. They certainly are family and have welcomed him into their circle better than he expected. Just because Phil had known for a while that he felt attraction for man at the time, it didn&rsquo;t mean his family knew it too. Phil handled it all so naturally, though. Dan on the other hand was scared shitless, everything his parents knew was that Dan had just broken up a long term relationship with a girl, and even though bi and pan sexuality are real, people tend to forget that.</p><p>Dan didn&rsquo;t want to dwell on the aftermath of his &ldquo;coming out&rdquo; to his family anymore. It had plagued him for years, but he mended it with Phil&rsquo;s help and some therapy, as much as he could. As their career took off and they gained more audience and opportunity, things started get easier with his family.</p><p>But Phil&rsquo;s family had received him with open arms from the beginning, treating his like as much of a Lester as anyone of them. That&rsquo;s why Dan had decided to add Phil&rsquo;s surname to his own. &ldquo;Daniel James Howell-Lester&rdquo; sounded great to his ears. Not excluding his own name, but adding Phil&rsquo;s.</p><p>This thought led him to the wedding planning ideas. He had some calls to make, some stuff to research, still. It was the next big thing to do. Maybe the wedding stuff had held him back on the script writing for a while, but he didn&rsquo;t regret it. Planning a wedding was stressful, yes, but they&rsquo;ve planned two world tours so far, which made &ldquo;wedding planning&rdquo; sound like a kid&rsquo;s game. After Interactive Introverts Dan decided to relax a bit, so if he felt like hiring someone to help them and handle all this stuff he would jump right into it, but once he started he felt like he could do it, it was good, kept his mind busy but not overwhelmed. So far so good, flowing smoothly and inside the schedule.</p><p>There was no reason to wait more. Phil didn&rsquo;t propose just because he felt like they were together for long enough, he did it because he wanted to get married already. They already lived like a married couple, so not much would change in their day to day life. They will officially refer to each other as &ldquo;my husband&rdquo; and they refuse keep going with the &ldquo;only friends&rdquo; anymore. That&rsquo;s a massive change once you let it out of the secrecy of your own home. There will also be some great memories to treasure forever of the day they swore their love for each other. That&rsquo;s ridiculously sweet, but true.</p><p>The business part of their life though, that will change a lot. How they deal with their shared businesses, their taxes, and even Dan&rsquo;s signature in those papers will have to be updated. They would never take this step if they didn&rsquo;t intend to come clear with their audience about it, because the business side of their lives was very much public and of easy access to anyone.</p><p>Dan grabbed his laptop from his side &ndash; he had taken it with him back from the living room last night and written some ideas down until he felt like he couldn&rsquo;t keep his eyes open &ndash; and his phone from the other and started to call places and schedule visits. They weren&rsquo;t visiting locations yet, they didn&rsquo;t want to be seen there together, it would ruin the damn surprise. They were deliberately blindsiding their audience. Their audience sort of knew, but maybe, by staying silent, they might slightly doubt it too. Was it mean? Probably. But that&rsquo;s what they deserve.</p><p>After he finished this bit, he went through the bakeries. That was important, not only to look pretty but for that cake to be delicious. They love their food, but mostly when it comes to the desert. They had narrowed the bakeries down to the ones they knew and loved, each one had their number one favorite flavors. Thinking about food just reminded him of the fact that he hadn&rsquo;t eaten yet. Shit. Dan looked at his phone, 11:30 am. Again, shit. If it&rsquo;s this late, he might as well get some lunch delivered. He grabbed back him phone and noticed a new message. From Phil.</p><p>They talked a bit about nothing, then about something weird Phil did at the airport &ndash; he, in fact, attracts crazy people, they had concluded &ndash; and how he thought he had seen Sam the Surfer again, but he wasn&rsquo;t sure, so it didn&rsquo;t count in Dan&rsquo;s opinion. Phil also informed that there would take just a couple more hours until he was home. Good, Dan was missing him a bit too much for his liking today.</p><p>Dan had a vegan healthy snack delivered for lunch. Phil was a bad meat-fluence in his eating sometimes, so when he was away Dan took the opportunity to try and eat less food of animal origin. It made him feel good whenever he accomplished a whole day without any meat, dairy or eggs. Sometimes Dan would get Phil into it, sometimes each one chose a thing to eat at the same place, so Dan could stay inside his guidelines and Phil would go off on his stuff. But when it was food for sharing, like a pizza, it was hard to say no to stuff he already liked.</p><p>He happily eat his vegan meal from the new place his brother had recommended to him. It was fucking delicious, indeed. Then he decided to just turn off his brain until Phil was home, by playing some Guild Wars II, of course.</p><p>_</p><p>Phil arrived home some hours later. He had messaged Dan when he landed, but got no response all the way back home. Dan was probably deep into some videogame, for not looking through his phone for the last hour at least. Phil wasn&rsquo;t too worried, he had seen this behavior before in two scenarios. It&rsquo;s been some months since Dan had left the house without his phone during a crisis, but they are heading to uncharted situation now, so who know? But he wanted to believe that it was more likely that he was playing.</p><p>When he walked up the stairs to the living room and saw Dan sprawled on the couch playing Guild Wars II, he definitely threw any doubt through the window. He entered Dan&rsquo;s view, and Dan jerked up on reflex. Like, how scared Dan would be if someone entered their apartment before he noticed it was Phil.</p><p>&ldquo;Phiiiil!&rdquo; Dan shrieked annoyed and amused at the same time.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry!&rdquo; Phil had that tongue-poking smile of his. &ldquo;I tried to tell you I was home, but you didn&rsquo;t answer my messages.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Has it really been this long?&rdquo; He grabbed his phone, whilst still trying to keep playing properly, he wasn&rsquo;t finished with his gaming. &ldquo;Damn, what?&rdquo; Yes, it has been this long.</p><p>Phil got closer to him and placed a kiss to his temple. Dan turned his face and gave him a peck on the lips. &ldquo;Hi&rdquo; he smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey you&rdquo;, Phil answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go undo my luggage, put some clothes to wash and leave you alone a bit more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just finish here and I&rsquo;ll come for you&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Phil had a sly grin on now. That smile alone made Dan sound dirtier than intended.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, shut up you dirty bitch. I can&rsquo;t believe you.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil was properly laughing now. &ldquo;Come for me later then&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that, I&rsquo;ve been without sex for too long now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Me too. What a coincidence, Dan.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say.&rdquo; Dan talked, but with his eyes glued to his game.&rdquo;That&rsquo;s really a weird coincidence. We should do something about that.&rdquo; He says, as he seems to finish whatever he&rsquo;s doing, because he takes his laptop and put it aside, then grab Phil to his lap.</p><p>Phil noticed what Dan intended, and before he could fall awkwardly on his fianc&eacute;&rsquo;s lap and risking hurting him, he turned and lifted one leg, andd placed it by Dan&rsquo;s side, falling on his knees, on each side of the younger man&rsquo;s hips, and sitting right on his crotch.</p><p>The older man grabbed Dan&rsquo;s hands, intertwined their fingers and pushed them above Dan&rsquo;s head, while he lowered his body, gluing every inch he could to the other man&rsquo;s body. Phil wanted to savor Dan&rsquo;s delicious smell that he missed so much, and went right for his neck, kissing, nibbling and slightly biting it. He got Dan panting already, while he moved to under his ear, then the jaw, cheek, and then he finally found his mouth.</p><p>Phil let go of Dan&rsquo;s hands in favor of sliding it under his shirt, savoring slowly every inch of his skin, tantalizing with the tip of his fingers, on the brink of becoming ticklish. Dan, on his part, used his new found freedom to grab his fianc&eacute; through the waist, pulling him closer and place the other hand on his neck, tangling his fingers in short locks of hair. Then, slightly, he pulled Phil&rsquo;s hair until they stopped kissing and Dan could look him in the eyes.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s lips were very much red from kissing, and he could already feel how happy Dan was to see him, as he was grinding down against him.<br />&ldquo;Oh god&rdquo; Phil buckled forward, he was losing track of his thoughts way too fast.</p><p>Dan shushed Phil while he kept pulling the hair on the back of the other man&rsquo;s head, and kissing down his neck, over Adam&rsquo;s apple.</p><p>&ldquo;I missed you so much&rdquo; Phil murmured.</p><p>&ldquo;Phil&rdquo; Dan said as he let go of him and started to unbuckle his belt &ldquo;Shush. Now&hellip; please fuck me.&rdquo;</p>",
