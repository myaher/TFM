Unfortunately, privacy is a coveted thing, and as Dan soon finds out, the hotel harbours one guest who values it more than most.</i></p><p>Rating: Explicit<br/>Tags: Enemies to lovers, snow, mountains, skiing, hostility, slow burn, secrecy, longing, repression, nobility, classism, cheating, eventual sex</p><h2><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F17623067%2Fchapters%2F41549267&amp;t=ZGI4Y2FkYTk0YzcxYWZiYmQxYTRlMWE1MzMwMzI2MzRkYjU2OWZmYyxicUQwS0w4Zg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQLX6-A1TlJpHUmJGXd-m-w&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fdanfanciesphil.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182663419145%2Ftoo-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil&amp;m=1\"><b>Ao3 Link</b></a></h2><p><b><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182478016430/new\">Chapter One</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182479290320/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Two</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182663419145/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Three</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182830239889/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Four</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182985976557/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Five</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183146088513/too-high-cant-come-down\">Chapter Six</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183318327771/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Seven</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183478354475/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Eight</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183634739921/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Nine</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183801485578/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Ten</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183968016711/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Eleven</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/184138802035/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Twelve</a><br/></b><b><a href=\"https://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/184301494045/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Thirteen</a><br/></b><b><a href=\"https://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/184463426719/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Fourteen</a><br/></b><b><a href=\"https://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/184632676790/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Fifteen</a><br/></b><b><a href=\"https://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/184786820304/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Sixteen</a><br/></b><b><a href=\"https://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/184947755280/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Seventeen</a><br/></b><b><a href=\"https://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/185111534550/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Eighteen</a><br/></b><b><a href=\"https://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/185275679644/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Nineteen</a></b></p><p><b>Chapter Twenty\u00a0(Final Chapter!) *NSFW*</b></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><b>[Three Months Later]</b></p><p><i>\u2018&hellip;on Friday, Philip Lester (formerly Novokoric) spoke at the Refuge Centre for Domestic Abuse Victims, where he opened up about his own experience with emotional marital abuse. Since his scandalous divorce from Sir Nikolai Novokoric of Switzerland, Lester has become a dedicated philanthropist, using his notoriety which arose during the controversial coverage of the split to spread awareness about domestic abuse, LGBTQ+ discrimination, homelessness, poverty, and many other important global issues. This Tuesday, Lester is expected to appear at the United Nations conference to discuss Third World Poverty\u2026\u2019</i></p><p>The folding seat beside Dan\u2019s is wrenched down, and a young woman with badly-dyed pink hair plops into it, holding a Starbucks cup and an Urban Outfitters tote bag stuffed with books and papers. Dan lowers the lid of his laptop to shift some of his stuff out of the way of her feet. </p><!-- more --><p>\u201cIs it just me or does it get more rammed in here every week?\u201d the girl says. Dan stares at her in mild dismay; usually he projects such a cold, unfriendly aura that nobody dares sit within two seats of him. He\u2019s seen this girl in a few classes before, but he can only barely remember her name. It\u2019s something like Ramona, or Rowena&hellip; Or maybe it\u2019s neither. She turns to Dan, brandishing a strong, confident smile. \u201cI\u2019m Roshina.\u201d <i>Ah. Neither.</i> \u201cYou\u2019re Dan, right? The guy who dropped out and then&hellip; dropped in again.\u201d </p><p>She tips her head back and cackles for a second, then begins pulling various things out of the tote bag. Dan grimaces, staring at the little cacti prints decorating the bag. What is it with hipster girls and succulents?\u00a0</p><p>Whilst he\u2019s not thrilled that he\u2019s apparently earned a reputation amongst the student body as the notorious failed quitter, he hasn\u2019t the energy to challenge her on it.</p><p>\u201cGuess so,\u201d he replies in a mutter.\u00a0</p><p>He opens his laptop again, hoping it might signal to her that he\u2019s busy, and not up for a conversation. Of course, every line of the article is like having someone plunge a fresh, thin needle into his chest, slowly stitching the word\u00a0\u2018fool\u2019 into his skin. But his need for information about Phil is as urgent as his need for water. He can\u2019t look away.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOoh, I love that guy,\u201d Roshina says, leaning in towards Dan to read the article as well. She leans her elbow on the back of his seat, the coffee in her hand hovering close to Dan\u2019s nose; it\u2019s something chai-spiced. Dan recoils as subtly as he can, pressing himself into the opposite edge of the chair.\u00a0</p><p>The article includes a photo of Phil behind a podium, his glasses on, wearing an impassioned expression, mouth open halfway through some dramatic statement or other.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf I were as famous as him and I\u2019d just, like, lost my hot rich husband,\u201d Roshina says, loudly, right into Dan\u2019s ear,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d have no shame. I\u2019d be applying to Big Brother or Love Island. Just shows there are some blokes willing to do the decent thing after all!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Dan cannot imagine why Roshina thinks he\u2019d care what she might hypothetically get up to in her fantasy version of Phil\u2019s life. He imagines Phil sneering at this girl\u2019s audacity, saying something snippy and derisive like: <i>\u2018And if I were as vapid as you, I\u2019d perhaps rethink my decision to pursue a career in the legal field, as it\u2019s highly unlikely anyone\u2019s going to hire a solicitor with bubblegum pink hair</i><i>.\u2019 </i>It makes Dan smile, just a bit, and then in the next second, he\u2019s back to being a bitter old maid.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t give him too much credit,\u201d Dan grumbles, eyes stuck to the photo of Phil, spewing some boring line about domestic abuse like he didn\u2019t need to be practically dragged to his own divorce settlement by the cuff of his ear.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s probably getting a buttload for all these appearances.\u201d</p><p>She snorts at him, rather loudly and obnoxiously considering this is, as far as Dan remembers, their first conversation. \u201cDon\u2019t you read Perez Hilton? He keeps zilch. All profits from his public appearances go to the charity he\u2019s promoting at the time.\u201d</p><p>Dan throat suddenly feels very dry. <i>All profits? What\u2019s he living on? </i>He scrolls down the page a bit more; Roshina jabs at his screen suddenly with a short, green fingernail. She\u2019s pointing to another article advertised at the side of this one, with the headline: <i>\u2018Give and Thou Shalt Receive: Phil Lester spotted with Possible New Man\u2019.</i></p><p>\u201cClick that one!\u201d Roshina squeals excitedly. \u201cIt was just posted!\u201d</p><p>Dan is about to tell Roshina in a clipped, irritable tone that he would rather pick up her fluffy pen and drive it into his eye, but she\u2019s already batting his hand away, apparently oblivious to social etiquette. He\u2019s trapped in his seat, forced to watch as she clicks the baiting link. A photo pops up at once, taken through an open car door, of Phil crammed into the back seat with Martyn and a \u2018mystery\u2019 person. Except it\u2019s not a mystery-person. Not to Dan, and not to the author of this article, who has, to their credit, obviously done their homework.\u00a0</p><p>Dan shifts uncomfortably as Roshina laps up the photo, eyes round and gleaming. He feels nauseous, and the smell wafting from her latte is not helping. Not that anything helps the sickness that sits at the bottom of his belly perpetually nowadays. Ever since he re-enrolled, courtesy of his doting and quietly ecstatic parents, Dan has been off food, off socialising, off anything much except sitting in his room scrolling through the endless media cycle of Phil-related articles.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSays here this dude used to be Nikolai\u2019s\u00a0photographer!\u201d Roshina exclaims. Dan says nothing. He doesn\u2019t want to entertain speculative notions that just because PJ, who used to work for Nikolai, has been papped in Phil\u2019s proximity, that it means they\u2019re dating. Even the idea of it has Dan gripping the hard plastic of his armrest to staunch his wave of paranoia.\u00a0\u201cPJ Ligouri is a UK-based photographer that jumped ship from Nikolai\u2019s press team alongside his former PA Cornelia Dahlgren. The latter is currently dating Martyn Lester, Phil\u2019s older brother. Suspicions of PJ\u2019s involvement with the younger Lester were first aroused when he was noticed photographing Phil\u2019s appearance at last month\u2019s Climate Change Festival-\u201d</p><p>Dan slams the lid of the laptop closed so suddenly that Roshina squeaks, yanking her fingers away just in time.\u00a0\u201cBattery\u2019s low,\u201d he mutters, folding his arms across his chest. He sinks down in his seat, intending to stay that way until the lecture starts, letting the white noise of Roshina\u2019s indignant voice keep his intrusive and unpleasant thoughts of Phil and PJ, and all the things they might be doing, at bay.\u00a0</p><p>*<br/></p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Martyn says, \u201cit\u2019s Corn for you. She wants a private word.\u201d </p><p>Phil frowns, not looking up. \u201cTell her I\u2019m the wrong brother to call for that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe says it\u2019s pretty serious,\u201d Martyn says, ignoring him.\u00a0</p><p>Phil lets out a frustrated sigh, letting the open file he\u2019s been reading fall to the couch cushion beside him. The Red Cross have sent him a buttload of information that he needs to know inside out before his address at the United Nations conference later today. He\u2019s been back and forth with the Red Cross for weeks through phone calls and emails trying to get up to speed, but there\u2019s so much to know in such a short space of time. He has to look like he\u2019s dedicated to this project, and he is, but the UN invited him last minute - he hasn\u2019t had a lot of time to prepare.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019ll have even less time if Cornelia keeps pestering him about schedules and meetings or whatever this is about. Of course, despite her constant bothering, Phil would lick the soles of her comfortable-but-cool sneakers to keep her around. She\u2019s a scarily good Press Agent, Phil has no idea how Martyn ever took her on back when they were rivals. They work much better as a team, sharing the role for Phil on a voluntary basis, whilst working a few other part-time jobs.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSomething about a girl with blue hair?\u201d Martyn prompts, and Phil\u2019s heart skips.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHand it over.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSay please to your big brother,\u201d PJ scolds from the other end of the couch, though he doesn\u2019t look away from his phone screen, which he\u2019s been Skyping his girlfriend on for the past half hour. He angles the phone at Phil, pulling his headphones out of the jack; Sophie\u2019s round, sweet face fills the screen.\u00a0\u201cSoph, tell him to use his manners. You\u2019re a lady.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUse manners,\u201d Sophie says, then pulls up her nostrils to look like a snout.\u00a0\u201cBut I\u2019m no lady.\u201d<br/></p><p>Phil smiles at her, but his heart is pounding too violently to give her a proper response. He holds his hand out for the phone in Martyn\u2019s hand instead. PJ plugs his headphones back in, voice lowering.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, Corn,\u201d Phil says as soon as the phone is against his ear. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Cornelia says, then clears her throat. She\u2019s not diving straight in to whatever she has to say, so Phil immediately knows this is a sensitive topic. He stands from the uncomfortable sofa he\u2019s sat on, moving over to the window, as far away from Martyn and PJ as he can get in this tiny room. \u201cSo, Mona Kemp just contacted me. You remember her? From The Secret of the Alps hotel.\u201d </p><p>Phil rolls his eyes. \u201cYes, I remember the manager of my prison cell, funnily enough.\u201d </p><p>She clears her throat again. \u201cRight. Yeah. Well, apparently they\u2019ve just rented out your suite for the first time since you left.\u201d </p><p>Phil waits, but Cornelia seems to need prompting. \u201cUh huh\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the new guests, um, found something.\u201d </p><p>The tiny workers controlling Phil\u2019s brain are suddenly thrown into uproar, frantically combing through his memory for any inkling of what incriminating item he might have left in that godforsaken place. His jaw clenches so hard he can feel a twitch, but he stoically stares through the glass pane to hide his panic from the other people in the room.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was like a\u2026 recording device?\u201d Cornelia says, and Phil wishes he could see her in the flesh, read her expression to know how bad it is.\u00a0</p><p>Although they\u2019re both technically in the same building, the United Nations Headquarters are impossibly huge. She\u2019s downstairs somewhere amongst the thousands of behind-the-scenes worker bees, making arrangements with press and security for the conference. It\u2019ll be hours before she finds her way back up to this bare, lifeless green room they\u2019ve been given use of.\u00a0</p><p>His eyes flutter closed, picturing Dan, stood defiantly at the foot of a four-poster bed in his wrongly-buttoned shirt, his soft cheeks pink from exertion, spewing garbled information about a thieving girl with blue hair, and how she\u2019d recorded him arguing on the phone.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMona seemed to know who\u2019d put it there somehow, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Cornelia continues in a harried voice. \u201cShe said it was the daughter of some family that won a holiday up there. Anyway, obviously this device is a serious breach of privacy, and I\u2019m sure that if you wanted to press charges-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d </p><p>Phil pinches the bridge of his nose between his forefinger and thumb, conscious of saying too much in case he alerts Martyn, who is already at maximum stress level, and probably listening right behind him. The seams of Phil\u2019s head are bursting, still crammed with straggles of information about water filtration systems and monthly overseas school supplies. He can\u2019t take this in right now, can\u2019t be bothered to give an annoying fangirl brat with an inflated ego the time of day. And on top of that, he cannot listen to Cornelia pretend she hasn\u2019t already listened to that recording, whatever it is, from start to finish.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on it, Cornelia? Don\u2019t play dumb.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause; Phil looks over his shoulder and catches Martyn\u2019s eye. He immediately tries to busy himself with meaningless tasks, neatening files and shoving PJ\u2019s lighting equipment into the corner of the room. Phil turns back to the window, shaking his head. Martyn is just as much of a dirty snoop as his fianc\u00e9 is. They\u2019re made for each other. </p><p>At last, Cornelia speaks. She sounds like she\u2019s moved somewhere with less people in the background. \u201cThere\u2019s a few. They\u2019re\u2026 mostly x-rated.\u201d </p><p>A deep, dizzying flush sweeps down Phil\u2019s body, and he feels his mind threatening to fold inwards on itself. Thanks to a herd of mediation and personal response trainers that Nikolai had him spend weeks with years prior, Phil is able to keep himself relatively calm. He breathes in through his nose, out through his mouth, and stays quiet for a minute whilst he thinks of something to say that will help the situation. </p><p>\u201cSend the recordings to me,\u201d Phil instructs after a moment. He keeps expecting a sudden surge of anger to well up inside of him - at the blue-haired girl, at Nikolai, at Dan, at himself even - but all that floods through him is a deep, swirling melancholy, dappled with peaks of intense regret. \u201cAnd for the love of God don\u2019t show anyone else. Especially my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd tell Mona thank you for\u2026 being discreet.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t need to check that Mona had quickly and quietly taken the recording device down with a crisp, dismissive explanation to the new guests. He also doesn\u2019t need to check that she hadn\u2019t listened to them herself; Mona is an honest, rule-abiding woman, and would never dream of such a thing. He should send her a fruit basket one day. &hellip;When he can afford fruit baskets again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Cornelia assures him. \u201cWhat do you want to do about the girl?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe blue-haired girl. She could have really messed things up-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do anything,\u201d Phil says sternly. \u201cShe wants attention. Notoriety. Don\u2019t give her any.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust send me those recordings. Then get rid of any copies you or anyone else has, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d He hesitates. \u201cPerv.\u201d </p><p>She giggles.\u00a0\u201cSounds to me like you\u2019re the perv, mate. Not sure I\u2019d have let someone blindfold me on the first shag, he must\u2019ve been really into you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off, Corn,\u201d Phil says tiredly, no venom in his voice, then hangs up.\u00a0</p><p>He goes back to his case files with a weight in his chest. They\u2019re suddenly a lot harder to take in.\u00a0<br/></p><p>*</p><p>The bed Phil currently calls his own is far less luxurious than the one he used to sprawl out in when he was a resident of The Secret of the Alps hotel. It\u2019s barely even a bed, really, as it pulls out from a couch, but Phil never bothers folding it away, as he\u2019s only ever in here to sleep. Sleep is what he should be doing right now, in fact, but there\u2019s no way he could drift off right now, not after hearing what he\u2019s just heard. </p><p>Phil stares at the battered play button on the audio player window that\u2019s open on his laptop, which balances on his knee. If he clicks it again, it will be the fifth time he\u2019s heard the final recording Cornelia sent over, which is far too many times to be reasonable. She certainly hadn\u2019t been wrong in her description of the audio. X-rated is possibly even a little demure.\u00a0</p><p>He worries his lower lip between his teeth, hand long ago having reached beneath the covers to ease some of the intense pressure between his legs. He shouldn\u2019t click play again. The other person in this recording is long gone, and his quick exit was more than enough of a message that he doesn\u2019t want to be found. There\u2019s no point in torturing himself with Dan\u2019s ghost. His&hellip; incredibly hot ghost. His fingers press more insistently against his crotch.\u00a0</p><p>Just then, an email from Cornelia pings up in the corner of Phil\u2019s screen. He whips his hand away from his pyjama trousers, feeling very weird about doing any such thing whilst his sister-in-law-to-be is contacting him. To distract himself from the urgent pulses of arousal coming from beneath the covers, he clicks the email.<br/></p><p><b>From: Mona Kemp<br/>To: Cornelia Dahlgren<br/><br/></b></p><p><b>Fwd: Phil Lester</b></p><p><i>Dear Ms Dahlgren,</i></p><p><i>On my first attempt to send over the recordings, it appears the hotel\u2019s rather dated computer system failed to include this final, rather short one. I\u2019ve attached it in this email. Once I\u2019ve confirmed you have received it, I shall dispose of the recordings altogether. </i></p><p><i>Please send Mr Lester my sincerest apologies again for the atrocious breach of privacy. I no longer have his contact information, but he is welcome to get in touch with me for a formal apology, and we would be more than happy to compensate him with a free stay whenever he might choose to return. </i></p><p><i>Sincerely,</i></p><p><i>Mona Kemp<br/>Hotel Manager of The Secret of the Alps</i></p><p>Upon reading the line \u2018free stay whenever he might choose to return\u2019, Phil lets out a loud snort. Poor Mona. He\u2019ll never tell her, but he\u2019d have to be dragged back onto that cable car kicking and screaming. Even then, he\u2019d probably beg Kaspar to hurl him out of it before they reached the summit. He\u2019ll see how he feels about another trip up there in a few years, perhaps with time his stint there won\u2019t feel as traumatising.\u00a0</p><p>He clicks the attached recording, readying himself for yet another auditory reminder of his sordid, expletive-riddled, excruciatingly hot fling with Dan. There\u2019s a crackle as it begins playing, and Phil turns up the volume, straining to hear anything more than a few vague rustles. This doesn\u2019t sound like the other recordings. Perhaps the device had just picked up Phil talking in his sleep or something.</p><p>And then, he hears Dan\u2019s voice.\u00a0<i>\u201cPhil?\u201d</i> It\u2019s quiet, but clear as a bell.\u00a0<i>\u201cPhil.\u201d</i></p><p> Phil sucks in a breath. It\u2019s not that three months have wiped the memory of Dan\u2019s voice from his mind, but when he hears it echo through his eardrums, it\u2019s usually the words he spat in that last argument, when he\u2019d announced he was leaving, as if Phil wouldn\u2019t give a damn. He hasn\u2019t thought of Dan\u2019s softer, sweeter voice in some time. He\u2019d forgotten how Dan could sound, at times, without the strain of lust or fury warping his vocal chords.\u00a0</p><p>Then there comes a muffled \u2018thump\u2019, followed by a grunt of pain. </p><p><i>\u201cWha?\u201d</i> Phil\u2019s voice says. </p><p>Phil clicks pause and checks the timestamp for the recording. It reads 02:01am on 14th April. That\u2019s the day Dan left. Early in the morning. How come he can\u2019t remember this? </p><p>His heart thuds, coming to the gradual realisation that he\u2019s listening to a conversation he\u2019s never heard before. One he never even knew had taken place. Had Dan come to say goodbye to him after all? Has Phil been living under the impression that Dan had snubbed him, ran off without a word, when really\u2026</p><p>Phil sits up straighter, turning the volume up to the highest level. He clicks play again.\u00a0</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cDid you watch the stream of your fave giving his rousing speech at the UN?\u201d Roshina asks as she settles herself into the seat beside Dan\u2019s again. </p><p>Silently, Dan begs her to sit literally anywhere else, but her mind is apparently closed to telepathy. He wonders if she\u2019d believe he\u2019s suddenly been struck totally deaf. Unlikely, but it might be worth a try if it meant he didn\u2019t have to\u00a0talk about Phil again today; he\u2019s only just stopped crying for long enough intervals to make it to class. </p><p>\u201cYeah, uh, think I saw some clips on Twitter,\u201d Dan replies, aiming for the sweet spot between vague and already-up-to-speed.\u00a0</p><p>In truth, he watched it start to finish, at 1am because of the time difference, hunkered over his laptop in bed, tears streaming down his face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGod, wasn\u2019t he marvellous?\u201d she sighs, hauling a load of books and pens she won\u2019t use out of her tote again. <i>Yes, he was.</i> \u201cHe can hold a room for sure. I think it\u2019s \u2018cause you can tell he\u2019s passionate about this. \u201d She grins at him.\u00a0\u201cOr maybe it\u2019s because of his deep, sexy voice. D\u2019you think?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Dan stares back at her, wondering if she genuinely expects him to respond with words.\u00a0\u201cUh&hellip;\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Luckily, she doesn\u2019t seem too bothered about Dan agreeing. She pulls out her phone and begins cycling through her social media apps with the concentration of an atomic physicist.\u00a0\u201cOh look,\u201d Roshina exclaims just when Dan thought he might get a moment of peace, \u201cour man is trending.\u201d</p><p>Dan digs his fingernails into his palm. <i>Don\u2019t look. Just don\u2019t look.</i> \u201cCan I see?\u201d he asks, hating himself. </p><p>She angles her phone at him. There are two hashtags pertaining to Phil. The first is #AmazingPhil. The second is #PhilsUNSpeech. Roshina clicks the first, and scrolls slowly down a timeline of people enthusing about Phil\u2019s fiery yet intelligent speech which he gave at the United Nations headquarters yesterday afternoon, about the poverty crisis in several African countries. He seems to have really knocked it out of the park, judging by the response he\u2019s getting. Dan drinks the raining compliments down greedily, trying to glean, selfish though it may be, what Phil\u2019s mental state might be right now, in reaction to all the sudden attention directed his way. One particular tweet catches his attention.\u00a0</p><p>@nikolaischmikolai: saw #amazingphil at the airport after the conference! such a cool guy, didnt get a selfie cos he was in a hurry to get his flight but he signed my ticket with a Muse quote! #inspiration</p><p>Back at the airport, Dan notes. Already jet-setting off to his next glamorous public appearance. It won\u2019t take long until people start throwing money at him for all this\u00a0\u2018charity work\u2019. They\u2019ll give him a Netflix documentary series, or a book deal, or any of the other wank that just gets handed to celebrities.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLucky guy, seeing him IRL. I wonder what he\u2019s like in person,\u201d Roshina ponders, scrolling through more tweets.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAn emotionally stunted, obnoxious adrenaline junkie with no filter on the silver spoon stuck in his gob,\u201d Dan mutters, before realising he said that slightly too loud. Roshina is staring at him oddly. He shrugs, pinkening. \u201cI imagine, anyway.\u201d </p><p>Thankfully, before Roshina can respond, Professor Warren calls the class to attention, flicking the PowerPoint to the title page, which reads, \u2018Marital Dissolution: The Litigation of Separation and Divorce\u2019. The irony is stifling. </p><p>*</p><p>Sleep is closing in on Dan from all sides. He\u2019s trying to resist the urge to slip into blissful unconsciousness, but Professor Warren\u2019s baritone voice is making it so difficult to stay alert. His eyelids sag, then shut entirely. It\u2019s just as the waves of promised unconsciousness are beginning to draw him out into that sweet, deep void that the door of the lecture hall opens with its hideous squeak. Dan frowns, inching down further in his uncomfortable chair to try and get away from the noise. </p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d a loud, plummy voice calls, interrupting Professor Warren mid-flow. Dan frowns harder; the voice is instantly grating, as if it knows to burrow straight beneath Dan\u2019s skin. It skims along the shores of his half-dream, splashing through the shallows in the distance, but Dan is too far out to be reached. \u201cIs Dan Howell in this class?\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes snap open. </p><p>\u201cYoung man, I am in the middle of a lecture!\u201d Professor Warren replies in his gruff, incredulous voice, the one he uses in seminars to pick on students who haven\u2019t done the reading. Dan\u2019s been on the receiving end of this voice rather too often. \u201cI must insist that you wait outside until-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Professor, but this can\u2019t wait,\u201d the voice says, even louder. \u201cDan Howell? Dan, are you in here?\u201d </p><p>A slight Northern tinge is detectable beneath the upper-class overtones. Chills course down Dan\u2019s arms. This cannot be happening. He sneaks a glance at Roshina; her mouth is a round, pink circle, eyes bugged out so far it looks almost cartoonish. He looks left and right, noting that several people are also turning his way, alight with excitable intrigue. It\u2019s no use. He\u2019s going to have to confront this&hellip; situation. Dan sits up just enough that he can peer through the shoulders of the people in front of him, to the short flight of stairs that lead up to the lecture hall door. </p><p>It\u2019s beyond surreal, to take in the sight of Phil, here, in this dingy light-less hall, looking exactly the same as ever, but somehow startlingly different. He feels as though the image of him has smacked sharply into the back of his head. In the next moment, Dan realises that Roshina has literally smacked him. </p><p>\u201cYou <i>know</i> him?!\u201d she hisses, incensed. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you <i>say</i>?\u201d</p><p>Phil lets out a suffering sigh that makes Dan\u2019s teeth grit together. He\u2019s gazing out across the rows of students as if he were surveying his Kingdom. Dan hunches over, trying to hide. There must be a hundred people in here, thank heavens.\u00a0Suddenly, Roshina has her green-taloned claw on his upper arm; she hauls him up with surprising strength, though he does his best to struggle free.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil calls out a second time to the general room, ignoring the fact that Professor Warren looks to be on the verge of spontaneous combustion, \u201cI kind of <i>know</i> you\u2019re in here. Could you just\u2026 I need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Dan swallows, feeling the back of his neck prickle from how many eyes are on him now. Phil isn\u2019t wearing his glasses; perhaps he\u2019s blinder than Dan assumed he was, as Roshina now has him in a vice grip, ensuring he stays bolt upright in the chair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just dawned on me who you are, young man,\u201d Professor Warren says then, cold, \u201cand I\u2019m sure in your world this kind of disruptive behaviour is tolerated. But this is an academic setting, not a press interview. Please leave my lecture. You may speak with whomever you like in an hour.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDan, I know you\u2019re in love with me,\u201d Phil says, with a sweet, butter-wouldn\u2019t-melt smile. \u201cI think we should talk about that, maybe.\u201d </p><p>Cheeks furiously flaming, Dan looks down at his folding desk covered in meagre study tools for some kind of murder weapon. The best he has is a laptop charger, which he might be able to fashion into some kind of lasso and choke Phil from afar if he really tried. Stifled snickers erupt behind people\u2019s hands, and practically everyone is staring at him now. With little other option, Dan shoots to his feet, stuffing everything in his bag. He doesn\u2019t give Phil the satisfaction of meeting his eye, but as he\u2019s finally shut his gob, Dan reckons the dickhead has spotted him at last. </p><p>Bag slung over one shoulder, Dan forces his way past Roshina\u2019s fishnet-wrapped knees, then past a few other amused students to the aisle. He stalks down the stairs as quickly as possible, head down. He can sense Professor Warren\u2019s disapproving glare on him; this little stunt will not earn him any favours, and he\u2019s already on the Prof\u2019s list of ne\u2019er-do-wells. Once he begins the climb of stairs towards the hall doors, Dan finally lifts his head to aim his icy expression at the infuriating human that has inexplicably decided to saunter in and humiliate Dan like no time at all has passed. The corner of Phil\u2019s mouth is lifted just a tad. Dan had honestly forgotten, what with all the heartache, just how punchable he is. </p><p>He says nothing, just grabs Phil by the upper arm and marches him up the remainder of stairs, then through the doors. Once they\u2019re outside the lecture hall, which opens directly onto the main outdoor campus, Dan lets go of Phil like he\u2019s burning, and strides across the tarmac, feeling the burn of mortification stinging him from all sides. Of course it\u2019s raining, Dan thinks as he walks, the scent of rain-soaked concrete misting the air.</p><p>It\u2019s not long before he hears footsteps hurrying after him. \u201cDan, wait!\u201d </p><p>Furious, Dan stops in his tracks and whirls around. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d </p><p>Phil comes to an abrupt halt in front of him, eyes round. He blinks at Dan, mouth parted; for a moment, Dan is equally dumbstruck. Seeing him so close, after months of only glimpsing him through a screen, is disconcerting. Was he always this stunning? Did Dan really somehow grow used to the vivid, swirling blue of his eyes?\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 could ask you the same question,\u201d Phil says after a while.\u00a0<br/></p><p>The annoying non-answer immediately slaps Dan back from gooey-ville. He gives Phil a withering look. \u201cI\u2019m a student here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought you dropped out.\u201d</p><p>Dan grits his teeth again. How is it that Phil always knows to pick at the very knots Dan doesn\u2019t want to unravel?\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, I dropped in again.\u201d\u00a0He folds his arms across his chest. To his utter dismay, a smattering of the students milling around the campus plaza have begun to look up from their phones and tablets. There\u2019s a lot of pointing and murmuring going on, presumably because \u2018Amazing Phil\u2019 has appeared out of the blue to fight with some normie. \u201cWhy\u2019d you have to announce to the entire hall that I\u2019m \u2018in love\u2019 with you?\u201d Dan demands, pointedly using air quotes to convey the ridiculousness of that concept. \u201cI have to finish out the year with the people in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, you <i>don\u2019t</i> have to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start with the whole \u2018you gave up on giving up\u2019 thing. I know, okay? I\u2019m back exactly where I was before we met, hating every aspect of my life. But we can\u2019t all be famous charitable heartthrobs.\u201d</p><p>Phil smirks, his lowered eyelashes catching tiny droplets of rain. \u201cHeartthrob?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Dan says, one hand coming to his damp forehead, \u201cwhat do you <i>want</i>?\u201d</p><p>An actual crowd of people is forming around them, seemingly oblivious to the fact they\u2019re all steadily getting soaked. Dan wants rather badly to bolt far away from this spot. But that would mean leaving Phil behind, again, and annoyed though he is, he just can\u2019t wrench himself away a second time, not when he\u2019s only just reappeared. Phil shifts, pulling his smart jacket tighter, eyeing the people gathering around them. Several of them have unsubtly pulled out their phones to film this exchange.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI had this dream,\u201d Phil says, inexplicably.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, Martin Luther King,\u201d Dan says dryly,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure your doting fans would love to hear all about it, so just look into one of these nice people\u2019s lenses and remember to speak clearly-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had this dream that you crawled into bed with me,\u201d Phil interrupts, continuing as if Dan hadn\u2019t spoken. An eruption of titters spills from their group of onlookers; Dan has to close his eyes and breathe to stop himself from stepping forwards and kicking Phil in the kneecap. \u201cIn the middle of the night. And you asked me to give you a reason to stay with me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Immediately, the backs of Dan\u2019s eyes strain and ache, pushing tears into his ducts. He wills the rain to fall harder, to disguise his reaction in case he can\u2019t keep the tears from spilling over.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd in my dream,\u201d Phil continues, \u201cI couldn\u2019t think of a reason. I just thought&hellip; you must already know how much I like you. I\u2019d told you so many times that you were constantly on my mind. I\u2019d done stupid, reckless things to be with you for just a few hours. I\u2019d left my husband. But there you were, in my dream, asking me for something more. I couldn\u2019t understand what it was you wanted me to say. I didn\u2019t have anything left. Nothing I could think of that might stop you leaving.\u201d<br/></p><p>The rain is soaking through Dan\u2019s t-shirt, sticking it to his skin. He shivers, trying to let the alien words fold into his drizzled, muddy mind.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late for this,\u201d Dan points out, toeing the tarmac with the tip of his trainer, watching the light grey slabs slowly pinpricking with dark circles. \u201cAnd it was just a dream, like you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought of a reason, though.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes lift. He wants to say he doesn\u2019t care, that their brief attempt to grasp at the wisp of some connection that sparked between them was doomed from the start. The chance has passed them by - they\u2019re no longer up a mountain with only each other for company, they\u2019re back in the gritty rainy reality of their starkly different lives.\u00a0</p><p>But he also aches, body and soul, to know that reason. The thing Phil never said, that Dan has imagined him saying every day since. God help him, he yearns to hear it more than he yearns for oxygen in his next breath. So he says nothing, lips pressing tight.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI was really lonely,\u201d Phil says, grimacing as a fat raindrop strikes his pale cheek. \u201cI spent three years in a far off retreat nobody knew about, cut off from everything I\u2019d known. The cold of that place, along with the isolation&hellip; I think it seeped into my bones. I just went numb. I forgot how to feel anything.\u201d </p><p>Dan looks away, casting his gaze around the people on the periphery of this strange conversation, all of them listening intently, so ready for some dramatic story to add to their social media timeline. </p><p>\u201cAnd then you came,\u201d Phil says, apparently oblivious to the entourage. \u201cLike you\u2019d been flung up the mountain by mistake. You had no more clue why you were there than anyone else. And you were so\u2026\u201d he heaves a sigh, running fingers through damp, dark hair. \u201cSo fucking <i>annoying</i>.\u201d</p><p>A ripple of laughter goes up around them; Dan chokes out a cough of indignation. \u201cIsn\u2019t this supposed to be a reason you wanted me to stay?\u201d </p><p>Phil smiles, showing the barest hint of teeth. \u201cYou got on every single one of my nerves. It was like you\u2019d specifically been planted there to piss me off. Everything about you was just\u2026 so frustrating.\u201d </p><p>Dan cocks a suggestive eyebrow, because it\u2019s decidedly his turn to embarrass Phil after the many things he\u2019s inferred about Dan so far. On camera.\u00a0\u201cThere were occasions where Louise had to pull me aside and cool me off so I wouldn\u2019t beat you with your ski pole. So don\u2019t think it was one-sided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s just it,\u201d Phil says, taking a teensy step closer. Dan\u2019s backpack strap is sodden, and his face is misted with moisture, but he can\u2019t seem to make himself move an inch, because Phil - god damn him - looks fucking incredible all wet, in a Mr Darcy-emerging-from-the-lake sort of way. \u201cYou made me feel things again. Sure, most of the feelings were anger and exasperation, but it was still better than the void that was there before.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWow. I don\u2019t know what to say. This is all so romantic,\u201d Dan says scornfully; their audience titters, and Dan feels a small surge of pride that this time they\u2019re laughing with him. \u201cAre you getting to some kind of point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil says, laughing. \u201cI was so alone, and I owe you so much.\u201d</p><p>Dan snorts, turning on his heel. <i>Enough.</i> \u201cThat\u2019s a line from Sherlock, you dick-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m fucking about, I can do better,\u201d Phil pleads, grabbing his arm. Dan thinks about pulling away, but he settles for just turning to glare some more, very aware of Phil\u2019s touch, how his warm, wet fingers feel even through the soggy material of his t-shirt.\u00a0\u201cHow about\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil is really close to him now, his deep thinking cutting a crease between his brows. The rain has deflated his quiff, making it stick to his forehead. Somehow, even with a makeshift emo fringe, he looks infinitely radiant. Dan imagines that in comparison, he resembles a drowned rat, his hair frizzed and unattractive, and it\u2019s all being caught on film, which is fantastic. Phil drops his voice to a murmur, presumably so it can\u2019t be picked up by people\u2019s shitty phone mics.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cArguing with you every day, up in the heavens of fucking nowhere\u2026\u201d Phil shrugs, smiling. \u201cThat was the most fun I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>A droplet spills from Dan\u2019s left eye, and he wipes it away, furious with himself for allowing it to leak out. \u201cWow,\u201d he chokes out. \u201cYou must have been really bored up there.\u201d </p><p>Phil nods, eyes trained on Dan\u2019s traitorous smile. \u201cIs that&hellip; your way of saying you don\u2019t hate my guts?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan feels himself tense. Phil\u2019s hand is still on his arm, and his thumb strokes gently over the damp skin just below his sleeve. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t provide you with, like, champagne or- or um, suites in fancy hotels or\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He trails off, because he\u2019s allowed himself to look into Phil\u2019s eyes properly for the first time; they really are so many separate shades of blue. There must be dozens of colours in their depths. He\u2019d have a job naming them all.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll settle for the occasional kiss between battles,\u201d Phil replies.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Dan splutters softly, cheeks warm against the shivering rest of his body. His eyes flit to their audience, several of whom have their hands over their hearts and mouths. </p><p>\u201cNot here,\u201d Dan replies, taking a hasty step backwards. \u201cLet\u2019s, uh,\u201d he glances around for a break in the crowd, \u201clet\u2019s go somewhere\u2026 less here.\u201d </p><p>He turns before Phil can answer, pushing through a throng of camera-faced people, letting Phil find his way to catch up. They get halfway across the campus main square before Phil says coolly, \u201cnot to ruin the theatricality of this moment, but where are we going?\u201d </p><p>Dan looks at him, then stops in his tracks. <i>Crap.</i> \u201cY-you can\u2019t come back to mine.\u201d He blushes, fidgeting. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 living with my parents. At the moment.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Phil says, dithering.\u00a0\u201cNot ideal.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhere are you staying?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil hesitates, and Dan has to prod him in his damp ribs to make him answer aloud. He sighs eventually. \u201cSusan.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s eyebrows shoot towards the rainclouds above them. \u201cYour plane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. S\u2019all I\u2019ve got to my name right now, pretty much.\u201d </p><p>Dan nods, considering this for all of about five seconds. He can already sense that they\u2019re beginning to be followed. Dan grabs Phil by the wrist. \u201cShe\u2019ll do.\u201d </p><p>*</p><p>Considering what a smooth, relaxed pilot Phil is, Dan is genuinely baffled by how terrifying he is as a driver.\u00a0Phil has parked Susan on some farmland about two miles from campus; the owner of the plot had recognised Phil\u2019s plane when he\u2019d landed it in the local airport and practically jumped at the chance to offer him a place to stow it - presumably to earn himself some bragging rights for bestowing his hospitality on a semi-celebrity. </p><p>This suspiciously good samaritan also gave Phil use of his truck for the day, as the farm is in the middle of nowhere, and Phil needed a way to get to Dan\u2019s university campus. The truck is an old, squeaky thing caked in mud; as far as keeping a low profile goes it does a grand job, but it doesn\u2019t reek of safety. For most of the journey, Dan is clutching the ceiling handle, shrieking whenever another car comes the other way as Phil careers them down narrow country lanes at sixty miles per hour. </p><p>Eventually, after Dan has come worryingly close to crapping his pants, they reach the field where Phil\u2019s plane is sat, less shiny than Dan remembers her, but just as intimidating. The rain is easing up, but it\u2019s left the green countryside dripping and muddy; Dan is not particularly looking forward to trekking across the wet grass.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m literally never getting in a car with you again,\u201d Dan states vehemently, legs shaking as he steps out of the truck. </p><p>\u201cWimp,\u201d Phil says dismissively, slamming his door closed. The sound echoes around them, bouncing off the trees that fringe the field. \u201cI\u2019m just a little rusty. There\u2019s less traffic in the sky.\u201d </p><p>As his heart settles back into its normal rhythm, Dan shuts his own door and follows Phil across the grass to the plane. Phil presses a button as they approach and a short set of steps protrude in a neat glide from Susan\u2019s door. </p><p>\u201cMissed you, babe,\u201d Phil says, hopping onto the first step before it\u2019s completely extended. </p><p>Dan blanches, nearly slipping on a patch of wet grass. \u201cUh, what?\u201d</p><p>Phil looks over his shoulder, amusement coating his expression. \u201cI\u2019m talking to Susan.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh. Yeah. I- I know.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughs and ducks inside the plane. Dan looks around at the vast, endless fields that surround them, startlingly green and lush from the burst of rainfall. There\u2019s nothing for miles aside from a tiny farmhouse in the distance; they\u2019re alone together again. It\u2019s a different kind of deserted expanse to the snow-covered mountains, but a familiar sense of isolation hovers in the air.\u00a0</p><p>Susan\u2019s sleek interior has changed since Dan saw it last. For one thing, what little floor space had been at the back of the plane has been largely taken up by a pull-out bed. It\u2019s unmade, the covers rucked and creased, which in the cramped area makes the whole place look messy. Phil shimmies around the bed to a what looks like the counter of a small bar, opening a neat pull-out contraption that reveals a sink. There\u2019s a kettle too, which Phil holds under the faucet.</p><p>\u201cUh, so you live here? Permanently?\u201d </p><p>Phil nods.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Dan mutters, toeing the empty red bull can on the floor near the bed. \u201cQuite the fall from grace. How are you coping without 24-hour maid service?\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u2019not so bad,\u201d Phil says with no apparent hint at insincerity. He kneels on the bed and leans over to grab the red bull can, which he then throws into the bin, rather stylishly. \u201cAt least here I\u2019m not in debt to anyone.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo you own the plane, then?\u201d </p><p>Dan sits gingerly on the bed, mainly because there is nowhere else to sit apart from the two seats in the cockpit, and he can\u2019t even look in that direction without blushing. It seems both long ago and entirely too recent that he was sat there with Phil knelt before him, high above the peaks of the Swiss mountains. He seems to remember, from his last visit, more seating in the back here, but as he studies the bed he\u2019s perched on, he realises that this <i>is</i> the seating, folded out into a small double bed. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil replies, pouring boiling water into mugs. \u201cNikolai let me have this and the ring.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyebrows raise. \u201cYou\u2019d think he could\u2019ve spared a couple of\u2026 million.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t, actually. It would\u2019ve detracted from my trustworthiness, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean about all the charity stuff you\u2019re doing?\u201d </p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Phil affirms, lifting both mugs and carefully sitting on the bed beside Dan. He hands one over, and Dan takes it. He doesn\u2019t particularly feel like tea, but then he is wet and slightly chilly from the rain, so it will probably help chase the cold from his bones. \u201cSo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Dan echoes. </p><p>They lapse into silence, blowing on their scorching drinks. Eventually, Dan abandons his, knowing it will be too hot to drink for some time. He places it carefully on the shelf beside the bed. \u201cI need to ask you something,\u201d Dan says. </p><p>\u201cYes, the theories are right, I am naturally ginger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>Dan shakes his head. \u201cNot&hellip; what I was gonna ask. It\u2019s about that dream you mentioned.\u201d He hesitates, heart squeezing tightly.\u00a0\u201cDid you&hellip; remember anything else about it?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Strangely, Phil shifts away from him. It\u2019s a telling movement, and even though Dan\u2019s not been around him for some time, he\u2019s ninety percent sure that the expression Phil\u2019s features are forming is something like \u2018sheepishness\u2019. He squints at the older man as a gut feeling blooms that he\u2019s going to want to throttle him within the next few minutes.</p><p>Phil swallows tightly, placing his own mug on the floor. \u201cWell. I don\u2019t really need to, um. Remember.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d </p><p>Phil grimaces, seeming wary of Dan\u2019s reaction, then reaches beneath the bed, drawing out a Macbook. \u201cThis is Martyn\u2019s old one,\u201d Phil says when he catches Dan\u2019s raised eyebrow. \u201cNik kept mine.\u201d </p><p>A wave of sympathy washes over Dan from head to toe, swiftly followed by a surge of anger for Nikolai Novokoric. Phil opens the Mac and clicks around a bit, then turns to Dan, clear concern dressing his face. </p><p>\u201cSo, you remember that girl? With the blue hair?\u201d </p><p>*</p><p>Ten minutes later, Dan is sat in gobsmacked silence, his own confession of love reverberating through the air. No use denying it now. \u201cThat little fucker.\u201d </p><p>Phil winces. \u201cYeah.\u00a0Well, anyway, Mona and Cornelia destroyed all the copies.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes bulge. \u201cExcept this one!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell yeah,\u201d Phil says. His mouth twitches, and Dan zeroes in on it. \u201cBut\u2026 I reckon I\u2019m allowed to have one.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sweet.\u201d Phil nudges him with his elbow. \u201cAnd, y\u2019know\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, please enlighten me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 pretty hot.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s frown deepens. \u201cThat\u2019s a strange choice of adjective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe not the part where you bear your soul to me in a largely embarrassing midnight confession,\u201d Phil says, so Dan hits him in the arm, \u201cbut the other recordings-\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Other</i> recordings?!\u201d </p><p>Phil pauses, caught out. \u201cOh. Uh, yeah. From what I can gather the recording device began recording any time it picked up noise, so there are a few\u2026\u201d </p><p>He trails off, and Dan buries his face in his hands for a few seconds, then takes a deep inhale, straightening up. \u201cShow me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot sure this is the best time-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil, that\u2019s a recording of me doing a variety of explicit deeds. Fucking play it to me.\u201d </p><p>Phil hesitates, scanning Dan\u2019s face, then shrugs, pulls up a different recording, moves the play bar to the middle, and hits the space key. </p><p>\u201c<i>Kiss me,</i>\u201d Dan\u2019s voice says, husky and breathless. \u201c<i>Kiss me and then fuck me.</i>\u201d </p><p><i>Regret, regret, regret- </i>Dan lunges for the laptop, slamming the space bar. Unfortunately, he manages to press another key as well, and a different recording pops up. Before either he or Phil can do anything to stop it, Nikolai\u2019s voice is pouring from the speaker.</p><p><i>\u201c&hellip;my God, don\u2019t tell me you actually top in this-\u201d</i></p><p>Phil slams the lid of his laptop shut smartly, two pink spots appearing on his high cheeks. \u201cI\u2019ll delete these, I think.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s fingers push into his temple, massaging the spot. \u201cSo good of you to hang onto them until now, you wanker.\u201d</p><p>Silence falls, and for a moment the tension is taut to the point of being unbearable. Then, Dan hears a quiet, barely audible giggle. He looks at Phil, incredulous, and immediately upon seeing the creases of laughter around his glinting eyes, feels a swell of laughter bubbling up in his own chest. The tension snaps, and they let their streams of laughter spill out. Phil cards a hand through his hair, reaching for his tea again. </p><p>\u201cY\u2019know,\u201d Dan says, eyes glazed as he watches Phil\u2019s plump, pink lips seal over the rim of his mug, \u201cyou\u2019ve already lured me into your\u2026\u201d he gestures to the plane interior. \u201cDen. Kind of redundant at this point to play it cool.\u201d</p><p>Phil looks at him quizzically, sipping. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, as you have clear, recorded evidence of my unfortunate attachment to you right there,\u201d Dan says, stretching out on the bed a little more, settling into the familiar atmosphere of mildly absurd, irritation-fuelled hysteria, \u201cand I willingly endured your death-defying driving skills, then followed you into your plane in the middle of nowhere, it might be a reasonable assumption that I\u2019m, like,\u201d Dan waves a hand in the air between them, \u201cD.T.F.\u201d </p><p>Phil chokes around a mouthful of tea. He places the mug down sharply, eyes wide. It makes Dan laugh, and he leans back onto his hands. As it turns out, having every last scrap of his dignity laid out before them both is rather empowering. He has nothing left to hide, no reason to be coy, and it\u2019s now up to Phil whether he takes advantage or not. Dan really hasn\u2019t anything else to lose, at this point, sad though that thought might be.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to <i>assume</i>,\u201d Phil objects, scandalised, \u201cI\u2019m trying to be a gentleman!\u201d</p><p>Dan nods gravely. \u201cBy playing me audio recordings of me asking you to \u2018kiss and fuck me\u2019?\u201d </p><p>Phil\u2019s mouth opens, as if he\u2019s about to retort, but at the sight of Dan\u2019s smirk, he closes it again, a laugh escaping. \u201cIf I do one of those things now, can you pretend I waited until, y\u2019know, a respectable amount of time had passed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could pretend I had a sudden urge to shuck off my wet clothes,\u201d Dan suggests with a hand thrown across his forehead for emphasis; he\u2019s enjoying the unusual sensation of having the power over this situation, and as usual when he feels even a lick of power, his theatric flair rears its head. It doesn\u2019t matter that his heart doubled in speed as soon as Phil hinted at physical contact. \u201cAnd then,\u201d Dan continues, voice as dramatic as if he were addressing a theatre-ful of patrons, \u201cas you\u2019re finding me a spare shirt to cover my immodesty, you can\u2019t help your gaze lingering on my bare skin - you try to stop yourself, but your hand reaches out of its own accord to stroke across my chest - my breath hitches, and-\u201d</p><p>Phil dives across the bed, pinning Dan to the mattress and kissing him. \u201cHmm,\u201d he mumbles into the seam of Dan\u2019s lips, \u201cI forgot you never shut up.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s arms come up to wind around Phil\u2019s neck, a zing of pure joy ricocheting through his body as his familiar weight settles on top of him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten that you\u2019re ten times more tolerable to listen to when you\u2019re naked,\u201d Dan says, turning his head to urge Phil to kiss along his jaw. \u201cPlease comply.\u201d </p><p>Phil chuckles, leaning up to pull his shirt off. \u201cBetter?\u201d </p><p>A punch of air leaves Dan\u2019s chest; his hands spread themselves over Phil\u2019s toned stomach, re-learning the crevices either side of his belly, the smooth curvature of his hips.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMuch.\u201d His index fingers trace the line of hair that leads from Phil\u2019s tummy button beneath the waistband of his trousers. He pulls at the waistband impatiently. \u201cEven better without these though, I reckon.\u201d </p><p>Phil sits back on his haunches, positioning himself on top of Dan\u2019s thighs. \u201cYeah?\u201d he asks, already sliding the zipper down. Dan\u2019s cock pulses, still trapped by his jeans. Phil is putting on a show, but Dan no longer has the ability to call him out on it. His eyes won\u2019t unstick themselves from the sight of Phil shimmying his trousers down his thighs, revealing a pair of black boxer briefs so tight that they might as well be nonexistent for all they manage to conceal. \u201cHow\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>Dan shoots him what he intends to be a\u00a0withering look\u00a0that probably doesn\u2019t come across very menacing. \u201cI don\u2019t remember you being this vocal.\u201d</p><p>Phil smiles, using Dan\u2019s shoulder to steady himself as he peels the trousers off entirely. \u201cShut me up, then.\u201d </p><p>Not needing to be told twice, Dan grabs the backs of Phil\u2019s thighs and manoeuvres him back until he\u2019s sprawled on his back. He pulls off his own t-shirt, getting more impatient by the minute to entwine himself in Phil as deeply as possible; he\u2019s been starving himself of this, for months, and now he wants to feast. As soon as he\u2019s free of his t-shirt, Dan begins pushing his lips against the miles of bare skin covering Phil\u2019s upper body. Phil\u2019s breathing goes strange and stuttery, and his hand loses itself in Dan\u2019s hair. </p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he whispers as Dan seals his mouth over a nipple, \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill talking to Susan?\u201d Dan asks with a snort, and Phil smacks him lightly in the back of the head. </p><p>\u201cSusan doesn\u2019t talk back nearly as much.\u201d</p><p>In response, Dan chooses to trail a line of kisses downwards, through the valley of Phil\u2019s pectoral muscles, over the plane of his stomach, nipping gently at that tantalising rivulet of hair slicing through his pelvic region. When he gets to the boxer briefs, he pauses, lifting his gaze as he tucks his fingertips into the waistband. </p><p>Phil makes a sort of choking noise as their eyes meet, which is pleasant to hear. \u201cLift,\u201d Dan tells him, and when his hips rise, pulls them off in a flourish. Dan had thought the thick, gorgeous shape of Phil\u2019s cock was deeply ingrained into his memory, but even the image he\u2019d conjured up in the dead of night, when he couldn\u2019t stop himself from indulging in nostalgia, had been lacking in the exquisite detail of reality. He takes hold of the base in one hand, letting the warm, pulsing flesh push all thought from his mind. \u201cI missed you too,\u201d he says, and Phil whimpers. </p><p>Dan takes his time blowing Phil, letting him glide in and out of his mouth as he lifts his head and sinks down again and again. Phil\u2019s body slackens, sinking into the hard mattress so totally that it\u2019s as if he hasn\u2019t relaxed once in all the time that\u2019s passed since they last did this. The sensation of Phil atop Dan\u2019s tongue is comforting in its thickness, stretching his lips wide, reminding him of how it feels to be so open. He would like for Phil to know this, wants to share the intoxicating power of utter vulnerability. He pulls off, suddenly alight with an idea, and sits up, crawling over Phil\u2019s spread body until his face hovers above Phil\u2019s.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know what Nikolai mentioned,\u201d Dan begins, testing the waters.\u00a0</p><p>Instantly, Phil\u2019s hands stop wandering over his back. \u201cAre you seriously bringing up my ex-husband right now?\u201d</p><p>Dan chuckles, then sweeps a tongue over his lower lip, tasting Phil there, salty and sour; Phil\u2019s eyes fall to the movement with obvious interest.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just been thinking,\u201d Dan continues, determined to persevere with the thought if it could lead where he hopes it might. To soften the blow of blindsiding Phil with Nikolai\u2019s name, Dan dots a few light kisses over his jaw. \u201cWhen we\u2026 did things before. Were you just indulging me, because I suggested we try it a certain way, and it was my first time?\u201d</p><p>Phil arches his head backwards, wordlessly encouraging Dan to move his lips to his neck. \u201cW-what do you mean? It was always amazing with you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Dan says, sucking gently at the spot right below Phil\u2019s ear. \u201cSo you never wanted to do it a different way? Like\u2026\u201d His hand, which has been resting on Phil\u2019s hip, trickles over his thigh, dipping into the cavern between Phil\u2019s legs. He lets his fingers wander even lower, past the swell of his balls. He watches Phil\u2019s face intently, trying to gauge the reaction, and presses the tip of one finger to the tight, puckered entrance at his rear. \u201cThis way?\u201d </p><p>For the first time, Dan is able to witness the crystal blue of Phil\u2019s irises thinning and nearly disappearing entirely, swallowed up by the black holes widening in their centres. It\u2019s not until Dan removes his finger that Phil is able to summon a response. </p><p>\u201cI- I don\u2019t have much of a preference,\u201d he whispers, stammering. \u201cIs\u2026 is that something you\u2019d want to try, or-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil,\u201d Dan interrupts, feeling the smile teasing the corner of his mouth as he sees through Phil\u2019s poor attempt at nonchalance, \u201cdo you want me to fuck you?\u201d </p><p>Phil is quiet for a moment, but Dan holds his gaze, one eyebrow cocked, hopefully looking far more in control of himself than he feels. The elbow he\u2019s using to hold himself up begins to tremble, threatening to give way, but he holds steady, needing to hear Phil speak the words. </p><p>Then, Phil nods, just once. \u201cYes.\u201d </p><p>Dan smiles, leaning in to seal their mouths together. The eagerness with which Phil responds conveys his excitement, and Dan lets him twine their tongues together, allows Phil\u2019s arms to draw him in around the neck. After a few minutes however, Dan\u2019s self-control is reaching its very peak, what with Phil\u2019s cock trapped between their bodies still, and the anticipation of what it might be like to slip inside of him lurking so tantalisingly on the horizon. </p><p>Dan unwinds himself carefully, sitting up and reaching for the button of his own jeans. \u201cDo you have, um, stuff?\u201d </p><p>His question prompts Phil into immediate action; he sits up, peeling himself off the bed in order to stagger over to an overhead cupboard, which he reaches up to open. Dan\u2019s fingers stumble on the zipper of his jeans, attention ensnared by the sight of the lean, naked body in front of him, stretched out in a delicious long line of pale, pure skin, hiding terrains of thick muscle, tightened by years of diligent workouts. His cock strains against the fly of his trousers, imagining what it might be like to bury himself inside of such a temple; his fingers work frantically to open the zip. Eventually, Phil finds what he\u2019s looking for, and throws a bottle of lube and a four condom packets onto the bed. </p><p>Dan picks a few of the foil packets up, eyebrows raised. \u201cI\u2019m flattered that you presume so highly of my stamina, but-\u201d</p><p>Phil shuts him up using the method he seems to be realising is the most effective - jumping back on the bed and kissing him hard. \u201cThought we could take it in turns,\u201d Phil growls into Dan\u2019s mouth, because obviously he\u2019s intent on driving Dan to the brink of insanity.\u00a0</p><p>A strangled noise escapes Dan\u2019s throat, and he pushes Phil backwards until he\u2019s astride him again, back to pulling off his jeans, which thankfully goes a lot more smoothly this time. He slides his underwear off too, then reaches for the condom packet, ten steps ahead of himself; Phil\u2019s hand on his arm makes him pause. </p><p>\u201cWoah, uh, it\u2019s not my first rodeo but I\u2019m probably gonna need a little prep before-\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Dan mutters, throwing the condom aside for a moment. He shakes his head, blood thrumming in his ears, and smooths his hands up Phil\u2019s gorgeous thighs. \u201cSorry. Okay, what do I do?\u201d </p><p>Phil sits up, reaching for the lube, and un-pops the cap. \u201cWant me to do it?\u201d</p><p>Dan snatches the bottle from him. \u201cFuck right off.\u201d </p><p>He pours some of the gloop onto his fingers, remembering how, when they\u2019d done this before, Phil had warmed the substance before letting it touch his skin. He copies the action, coating his hands with it, then looking to Phil for further instruction. Phil opens his legs wider, allowing Dan to fit himself between them.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever done this to yourself?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOnly since you did it to me,\u201d Dan admits before he can stop himself. </p><p>Phil grins, unsubtly conveying his thoughts around this, and Dan only barely resists the urge to flick him in the balls. \u201cSame thing, then,\u201d Phil says.</p><p>\u201cWill it hurt?\u201d</p><p>Phil eases himself back down onto his elbows. \u201cDoubt it,\u201d Phil answers in a soft sigh. He lets out a little moan as Dan\u2019s fingertips press against him. \u201cFuck. No, I don\u2019t think this is gonna hurt at all.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s fingers slide into Phil as easily as if he were pushing them into warm bread dough. The walls of hot, soft muscle close in around him, drawing each finger deeper as he adds them one at a time. Phil murmurs vaguely bossy commands, telling him to scissor and stretch, but half the words are lost to his groans of bliss, each one making Dan shudder more violently than the last. </p><p>\u201cUgh, Dan,\u201d he says, voice desperate despite it seeming like barely any time has passed. He has one hand wrapped around the back of his right thigh, holding it up to allow Dan better access. Dan moves closer, brushes Phil\u2019s hand away and lets the crook of Phil\u2019s knee drape over his shoulder. \u201cFuck,\u201d Phil mutters, but doesn\u2019t protest. \u201cY-you can stop now,\u201d he urges, but Dan keeps on, wanting to be totally sure. Phil seems so tight, so <i>impossibly</i> tight, and whilst it is maddening to picture thrusting inside of such tightness, the thought of hurting Phil without meaning to is terrible enough to keep Dan stretching with his fingers, just in case. He changes the angle just slightly when his wrist threatens to cramp, and Phil swears, louder than he has so far. \u201cFff-<i>uck</i>. Do that again.\u201d </p><p>Dan does do it again. He does it many more times, pressing the pads of his fingers to that same spot until Phil is writhing against the covers, until his gasps sound more like gurgles, until his hands are scrabbling at Dan\u2019s wrist to pull his fingers free. </p><p>\u201cFuck, Dan please, I\u2019m ready, I\u2019m ready,\u201d he garbles. </p><p>For a long moment, Dan is too hypnotised by the wrecked, flushed mess that\u2019s become of the Adonis-like man sprawled out naked before him to react. He stares at Phil\u2019s reddened, slick lips, puffy from where he\u2019s been biting them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil chokes out, desperate. </p><p>The sound of his name slaps Dan back into coherence. He pats the space around him, searching for the condom packet he\u2019d thrown aside before. It seems to elude him for a while, but eventually he finds it, and rips the packet with his teeth. Thankfully, condoms are a part of sexual experience that he is not out of his depth with, as Beth had insisted on him using at least one, sometimes more, whenever they slept together. </p><p>He rolls it on with ease, thankful for the many opportunities he\u2019s had to practice for this moment, and takes hold of Phil by the hips, dragging him forwards with a sharp tug, until the head of his cock is aligned with Phil\u2019s slick opening. Phil is staring at him in amazement, and Dan doesn\u2019t blame him - he\u2019s exuding a confidence born purely of adrenaline, and it\u2019s making him into someone unrecognisable, someone composed and assertive. Someone hot.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asks; his shaky voice somewhat shatters the illusion. </p><p>\u201cGod, yes,\u201d Phil replies, apparently not noticing.\u00a0</p><p>Dan inches his hips forwards, letting the head of his cock press past the outer rim; Phil\u2019s head tips backwards, a sigh of ecstasy spilling from his throat. His hand releases its grip on the covers, and he brings his long fingers to wrap around his cock. </p><p>Even the sight is intoxicating. Ignoring all other sensation for now, Phil looks maddeningly good this way; Dan\u2019s hips almost lock in place, just watching him <i>feel</i>. The thin branches of Phil\u2019s neck bones are protruding beneath the skin, mottled from where Dan has nipped and bitten. His puffed chest is rising and falling rapidly, his shoulders trembling, misted with a sheen of rainwater and sweat. He ducks his head again, meeting Dan\u2019s eyes, and Dan remembers he\u2019s supposed to be moving, that he is supposed to be the one in control of this. He doesn\u2019t feel very in control, suddenly, too shaken by the onslaught of sensation attacking from all angles. </p><p>As if he\u2019s gleaned these concerns from Dan\u2019s mind through osmosis, Phil says, \u201cwait,\u201d and Dan pauses, terrified he\u2019s done something wrong. Phil sits up, glazed and sluggish, then pushes Dan backwards with a hand against his shoulder. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wr-\u201d </p><p>Dan lands back on his tailbone, and suddenly Phil is astride him, piled in his lap like a huge, gorgeous, naked gift. He angles himself without needing to look, keeping his eyes locked on Dan\u2019s the whole time, and sinks himself back down onto Dan\u2019s cock, lips parted, eyes fluttering. A moan pours out of Dan\u2019s throat as the unexpected bliss crashes over him, as the sensation of slick, hot, closeness grips him by the soul. He is buried inside of Phil\u2019s pure, angelic body, as far as he can get. It\u2019s agony, because Phil has gone still, letting himself adjust to the intrusion. Dan\u2019s head falls against Phil\u2019s chest, trying to keep calm when he wants so badly to shout at Phil to move even slightly, would trade everything he owns for the relief of it. </p><p>And then, miraculously, Phil does. </p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Dan whispers, brokenly, as Phil\u2019s hips begin rolling forwards. </p><p>His fingers dig themselves into Phil\u2019s arms, and he buries his face deeper into Phil\u2019s chest. Phil\u2019s arms wind around his shoulders. He lifts his hips up until Dan almost slips out of him entirely, then spears himself back down with a shudder. </p><p>\u201cGod, <i>Dan</i>,\u201d Phil groans, speeding up the pace. He uses his grip on Dan\u2019s shoulders to keep steady, bouncing up and down in Dan\u2019s lap faster and faster, barely letting Dan gasp even a snatch of air. \u201cDan- Dan, would you touch me?\u201d</p><p>Delirious, Dan mentally berates himself for not having the common sense to do this before now. He reaches clumsily between their bodies, barely holding himself together, and closes a fist around Phil\u2019s cock, which is hot and rigid to the touch. He pumps his hand in time with the thrust of Phil\u2019s hips, and in less than a minute Phil is crying out, biting down on Dan\u2019s neck so hard that Dan wonders if he might bleed. Phil\u2019s come splashes Dan\u2019s chest and stomach, coating his hand, and all Dan can think is how he wishes he could taste it.</p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t last much longer after that, as Phil doesn\u2019t so much as stutter in his rhythm. He manages to push his hips upwards a few times, to make the most of this miraculous moment, locked together with Phil in the most intimate possible way. As the tip of his cock presses once again into that spot that makes Phil weak, Phil jerks and gasps in his arms. That\u2019s the moment that Dan is unable to hold on any longer. He squeezes Phil\u2019s arm, groaning into the crook of his neck as he feels his own release fill the condom, a hundred white-hot stars scorching over his skin in a brilliant, blinding shower. </p><p>For a minute after, they don\u2019t move, draped over one another in various ways, just reorienting themselves as they float back to this dimension. Dan pushes his lips against Phil\u2019s damp skin in a way that doesn\u2019t feel chaste enough to be kisses. Eventually, Phil leans backwards, slowly lifting himself off Dan\u2019s lap, letting him slip out. With a shaky, fumbling hand, Dan pulls off the condom, putting it carefully on the floor because he\u2019s too spent to dispose of it properly just yet. </p><p>In the next moment, he feels damp fingers around his wrist, and then Dan is being pulled, until he\u2019s flat on his back, Phil\u2019s arm stretched out beneath his neck. They both stare at the ceiling, listening to the sound of their own gradually slowing breaths. </p><p>Dan rolls onto his side towards Phil, trailing fingers up his ribs, then into the cavern of his underarm, twisting the snatch of hair there between his fingers. He\u2019s sweaty, and it\u2019s still confusing to Dan that it doesn\u2019t gross him out; instead, the musky, heavy scent of Phil\u2019s perspiration is intoxicating, makes him want to bury his face in Phil\u2019s shoulder and lick the moisture from his skin. So he does. </p><p>Phil turns to peer at him, amusedly. \u201cPerv.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan smiles, not caring that it seems peculiar, because he knows Phil doesn\u2019t really care.\u00a0\u201cWas it okay?\u201d Dan asks, as if he isn\u2019t fully aware of how beyond incredible the last half hour had been for both of them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAmazing,\u201d Phil replies, rolling onto his side to kiss him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m as good as you at\u2026 that.\u201d </p><p>Phil\u2019s mouth twitches, and he leans back to stare into Dan\u2019s eyes. His pupils are returning to a more even size, though they\u2019re still taking up most of the space in Phil\u2019s irises. The ring of azure around them glimmers brightly. </p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t sell yourself short, mate,\u201d Phil says. \u201cI had a <i>very</i> good time.\u201d</p><p>Dan snorts, mostly at Phil\u2019s use of the word \u2018mate\u2019. \u201cSo you prefer it, then? Being like\u2026 the one who\u2026 um.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBottoms?\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s only response is a mortifyingly quick blush. </p><p>Phil laughs, prodding Dan\u2019s red cheek with his finger-tip. \u201cI mean it. I don\u2019t have a strong preference for either way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just Nikolai seemed so, like, surprised when he found out-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil says, already grimacing, \u201cI\u2019m only gonna address this once with you, because I don\u2019t particularly want you thinking about this in detail, but having sex with Nikolai is a very different experience to having sex with you. And not in a good way. Could you ever imagine him being as considerate of my preferences as you\u2019re being right now?\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s nose wrinkles. \u201cYou have a point. So\u2026 you\u2019re good with either? Top or bottom?\u201d </p><p>The flame in Dan\u2019s cheeks is fanned even saying the words. \u201cHmm,\u201d Phil says, then leans in to kiss Dan again, harder this time, knocking him backwards until he\u2019s on his back again. \u201cThink I might need a reminder of what it\u2019s like to top again. Y\u2019know, just so I have all the evidence before I make up my mind.\u201d </p><p>\u201cJesus, you\u2019re more of a horn-dog than I remember,\u201d Dan laughs, though he\u2019s already winding a leg around Phil\u2019s to pull him closer. </p><p>*</p><p>They\u2019ve been holed up in Phil\u2019s tiny living space, at the back of a stationary plane, mostly naked, for almost twelve hours. They\u2019d napped for a while, but now they\u2019re awake, watching an episode of Parks and Recreation because Phil has never seen it and Dan simply cannot allow anyone he associates with to not get his references to the show. </p><p>Somewhere in the middle of one of Leslie\u2019s rousing speeches, Phil\u2019s phone beeps. It\u2019s not the first beep they\u2019ve both pretended not to hear, and it\u2019s perhaps for this reason that now Phil sighs and reaches for it, his other arm around Dan\u2019s shoulders, fingers tickling idly across his upper arm. He frowns at the many messages filling the screen, scrolling through a few, then placing the phone upside down on the bedside shelf again. The amusing dialogue of the show loses its potency; Dan waits, breath held, for the inevitable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna have to get back to work soon,\u201d Phil says, just as Dan predicted. \u201cI kind of\u2026 ran off on Martyn and Cornelia and PJ after the UN thing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI figured,\u201d Dan says, already resigned. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It was, um. Good to see you, and stuff. Weird without all the snow and altitude. But good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d Phil says. From the way he has the offer so readily at hand, Dan knows he\u2019s been holding it back for a while. He pretends he hasn\u2019t heard, instead focusing on the screen, where Leslie has just fallen into a giant pit. <i>Relatable</i>. Phil nudges him beneath the blanket with one foot. \u201cDan, did you hear me?\u201d </p><p>Dan sighs, struggling out of Phil\u2019s embrace. They should have talked about this sooner. Now they\u2019re going to fight, and one of them\u2019s going to hurt the other, and then they\u2019ll split apart again for an indeterminably long bout of miserable, awful separation. </p><p>\u201cI heard you.\u201d </p><p>Dan runs a hand through his still-damp hair. They\u2019d had showers a while ago in Phil\u2019s tiny closet-shower. Though it would have been extremely nice to have stood beneath the spray together, there was no possible way they could both fit, so they took it in turns. Dan had gone first, and when he\u2019d emerged, Phil had made more tea, and produced a packet of biscuits. He\u2019d given Dan a robe - stolen from The Secret of the Alps, he noticed - for him to dry off and set him up with the laptop to watch Parks and Rec until he\u2019d cleaned himself of the evidence of their debauchery too. It had been wholesome and unusually soft behaviour; entirely too easy to fall into, and forget that their circumstances didn\u2019t allow for such kind, sweet interludes without a price. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even want to be a lawyer,\u201d Phil says, like it\u2019s as simple as that. \u201cJust think it over a bit more-\u201d </p><p>\u201cI did that,\u201d Dan snaps, then checks himself, breathing deeply. If he can avoid getting upset and defensive, that would be ideal. \u201cI already did the freaking out and running off to re-evaluate my choices. It didn\u2019t work. You were there, you <i>know</i> it didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>Phil shuts the laptop, cutting off the peppy American voices of the Parks and Rec cast. \u201cWhat exactly didn\u2019t work, though? What did you expect to happen up there?\u201d </p><p>Dan laughs humourlessly, gesturing between them. \u201cNot this.\u201d He winces. It came out meaner than he intended it to. \u201cI mean, obviously I\u2019m glad I met you and we dragged each other into a destructive pattern of secretly bonking behind closed doors&hellip;\u201d </p><p>\u201cHeartfelt,\u201d Phil replies; even though it\u2019s sarcasm, Dan can tell without looking over at him that he\u2019s smiling. </p><p>\u201c..but, even you have to admit it probably wasn\u2019t the smartest decision on my part. Or yours, come to that.\u201d Dan picks at the thin, messy bedclothes, frowning. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m very good at the self-reflective stuff. S\u2019just better if I crack on, stop fantasising that there\u2019s some dream career waiting in the wings somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving a job that makes you happy isn\u2019t a crazy fantasy, Dan,\u201d Phil says. He makes everything sound so easy. Dan kind of misses that about him, dangerous and seductive though it is. \u201cYou could come with me. We could work it out together.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCome with you where?\u201d Dan asks, turning to him incredulously. \u201cNo offence, mate, but you\u2019ve got no more clue than I have right now. You have no money or plans, you said it yourself. It\u2019s very admirable, all the charity stuff, but what\u2019re you gonna do when the public grow bored of you without all the divorce drama? How are you gonna fund your humanitarian schemes?\u201d</p><p>Phil shrugs, a composed, slightly amused smile gracing his features. He looks entirely unbothered by these questions, and Dan is suddenly so envious of his ability to shrug off anxiety that it makes a spurt of anger shoot through his chest. He rolls his eyes, throwing the covers off his legs. He\u2019s about to get up, to find his clothes and put an end to this brief day-cation from reality, when Phil\u2019s hand on his arm, gentle and cautious, gives him pause. </p><p>He waits, the warmth of Phil\u2019s fingers draining the frustration from his bones, easing the tension in his body. Phil shuffles closer, hands sliding to rest on Dan\u2019s shoulders, then rubbing gently, thumbs digging into the knots of taut muscle. It&rsquo;s so glorious that Dan sinks back into him, immediately slackening, his mind abruptly washed of every concern that had just been plaguing it. </p><p>\u201cHas anyone ever told you that you think too much?\u201d Phil murmurs into his ear. </p><p>\u201cI get the feeling you\u2019re about to,\u201d Dan retorts, then feels a satisfied sigh slip out as Phil digs his clever fingers in deeper. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to Africa,\u201d he says in a low, soothing voice that Dan knows is probably one he\u2019s been trained to use in stressful situations, but works so well that he can\u2019t be bothered to protest. \u201cThere\u2019s a cluster of villages in Kenya that need a lot of help. Installing water filtration systems, building schools, that sort of thing. That\u2019s where I\u2019m going next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right.\u201d Dan\u2019s shoulders tense up again. <i>Africa. Could he be jetting off further?</i> \u201cHow long f-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should come with me,\u201d Phil says for the third time. His hands become still on Dan\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m serious. We could use you out there.\u201d</p><p>Dan rolls his eyes, though Phil is behind him and can\u2019t see. \u201cAs convincing as that is, we both know I have the muscles of a cooked noodle, so I doubt I\u2019d be much use to you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not always about physical labour,\u201d Phil interrupts, like he\u2019s prepared this argument months in advance. He\u2019s too good at debating, that\u2019s the trouble. Dan\u2019s never stood a chance trying to last in the ring with him. \u201cYou\u2019ve got other hugely beneficial skills, I\u2019ve seen it myself. You can fix pretty much anything you put your mind to. That\u2019s kind of extraordinary.\u201d</p><p>Dan blinks, not sure how to react to the unexpected praise. \u201cWell&hellip; I don\u2019t know about \u2018anything I put my mind to\u2019-\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven so, you\u2019d probably have a hell of a lot more clue than I would,\u201d Phil points out, and Dan has to admit, although he\u2019s never witnessed Phil attempt to repair or even patch up anything beyond his own fragile ego, he doubts very much that he\u2019d be particularly skilled at it. He tries to imagine Phil with a spanner in his hand, tightening the joins in the municipal pipe under the blaring, scorching African sun. He has to hide his bubble of absurd laughter. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of the heat,\u201d Dan protests, weakly.\u00a0</p><p>Whilst this is true, and he\u2019d deliberately chosen the destination of his last runaway attempt to be the opposite of somewhere hot, Dan can feel his soul yearning for the adventure. For being with Phil, daily, their perpetual bickering exacerbated by the blazing sun, and then soothed by the cool night air, locked away in some dark room they\u2019d built together, free to kiss each other\u2019s sun-blistered skin all night long. His fingers itch for the fantasy, and he clenches them into fists, knowing he shouldn\u2019t dare to so much as want it.</p><p>Phil places a kiss to his shoulder, then leans away. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d Phil says, making Dan\u2019s heart sink. \u201cI mean, when you\u2019re so passionate about law, a little sunshine seems laughable doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Dan rolls his eyes, but a laugh escapes anyway, so he turns to whack Phil in the arm. Phil lets him, then catches him by the wrists, holding Dan\u2019s gaze. \u201cI think you could be happy. I think we could make each other happy.\u201d </p><p>One of Dan\u2019s eyebrows arches. \u201cI think we\u2019d drive each other bonkers.\u201d </p><p>Phil smiles. \u201cSame thing, I reckon.\u201d </p><p>Dan shakes his head, knowing in every cell of his being that this is completely mental, to abandon his life again for a man who infuriates him daily. But he also knows, perhaps even more strongly, that he\u2019s as in love with Phil as he is exasperated with him. \u201cIf I leave again\u2026 I won\u2019t be able to come back.\u201d</p><p>Phil squeezes his hands around Dan\u2019s. \u201cNo,\u201d he agrees. \u201cMe neither.\u201d</p><p>Dan chews his lip, though his resistance has more or less melted away. \u201cAre you only offering to take me with you because you feel sorry for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil says, teasingly.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m rescuing you from a life of paperwork and office parties.\u201d A smile breaks across his gorgeous face, making his eyes soften, crinkle at the sides. His voice drops into its rare tone of sincerity. \u201cDan, I\u2019m asking you if you\u2019d come with me. Because I watched you attempt to ski away from me up a hill and fall straight down it, and somehow managed to fall tragically, pathetically in love with you in the same instant. I want you to come. Because don\u2019t really fancy trying to stay away from you anymore.\u201d </p><p>*</p><p>Dan\u2019s not sure how it happens really. One minute, he\u2019s in a lecture hall with the most annoying girl on the planet talking his ear off about succulents and her hot personal tutor, and the next he\u2019s in the front seat of a fully-fuelled plane, beside a stunningly handsome philanthropist-slash-ski-enthusiast-slash-pilot, headed for a continent halfway around the world. He hasn\u2019t told his parents where they\u2019re going yet. Phil hasn\u2019t told the public, or Pj or Cornelia or Martyn. It\u2019s all a bit\u00a0\u2018up in the air\u2019. They\u2019ll tell anyone who needs to know when they land again, when the intense rays of sun are soaking into their pale skin, flooding their veins with Vitamin D. </p><p>Dan reaches across the chasm between his and Phil\u2019s seats, letting his hand dangle invitingly until Phil notices and takes it, rolling his eyes and telling Dan he\u2019s a \u201cright sap\u201d. But he threads their fingers together anyway, angling the yoke towards the sky, and Dan leans back in his chair as the clouds zoom closer, welcoming the oncoming oblivion. A wild thought swims at him from nowhere, as if it fell straight out of the Heavens:\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019d be just fine if they never had to come down.</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>The End.</b></p><p><br/></p><p><b>(Yes, there will be an epilogue.

Unfortunately, privacy is a coveted thing, and as Dan soon finds out, the hotel harbours one guest who values it more than most.</i></p><p>Rating: Explicit<br>Tags: Enemies to lovers, snow, mountains, skiing, hostility, slow burn, secrecy, longing, repression, nobility, classism, cheating, eventual sex</p><h2><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F17623067%2Fchapters%2F41549267&amp;t=ZGI4Y2FkYTk0YzcxYWZiYmQxYTRlMWE1MzMwMzI2MzRkYjU2OWZmYyxicUQwS0w4Zg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQLX6-A1TlJpHUmJGXd-m-w&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fdanfanciesphil.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182663419145%2Ftoo-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil&amp;m=1\"><b>Ao3 Link</b></a></h2><p><b><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182478016430/new\">Chapter One</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182479290320/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Two</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182663419145/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Three</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182830239889/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Four</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182985976557/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Five</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183146088513/too-high-cant-come-down\">Chapter Six</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183318327771/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Seven</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183478354475/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Eight</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183634739921/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Nine</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183801485578/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Ten</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183968016711/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Eleven</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/184138802035/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Twelve</a><br></b><b><a href=\"https://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/184301494045/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Thirteen</a><br></b><b><a href=\"https://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/184463426719/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Fourteen</a><br></b><b><a href=\"https://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/184632676790/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Fifteen</a><br></b><b><a href=\"https://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/184786820304/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Sixteen</a><br></b><b><a href=\"https://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/184947755280/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Seventeen</a><br></b><b><a href=\"https://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/185111534550/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Eighteen</a><br></b><b><a href=\"https://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/185275679644/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Nineteen</a></b></p><p><b>Chapter Twenty\u00a0(Final Chapter!) *NSFW*</b></p><p><i><br></i></p><p><b>[Three Months Later]</b></p><p><i>\u2018\u2026on Friday, Philip Lester (formerly Novokoric) spoke at the Refuge Centre for Domestic Abuse Victims, where he opened up about his own experience with emotional marital abuse. Since his scandalous divorce from Sir Nikolai Novokoric of Switzerland, Lester has become a dedicated philanthropist, using his notoriety which arose during the controversial coverage of the split to spread awareness about domestic abuse, LGBTQ+ discrimination, homelessness, poverty, and many other important global issues. This Tuesday, Lester is expected to appear at the United Nations conference to discuss Third World Poverty\u2026\u2019</i></p><p>The folding seat beside Dan\u2019s is wrenched down, and a young woman with badly-dyed pink hair plops into it, holding a Starbucks cup and an Urban Outfitters tote bag stuffed with books and papers. Dan lowers the lid of his laptop to shift some of his stuff out of the way of her feet. </p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cIs it just me or does it get more rammed in here every week?\u201d the girl says. Dan stares at her in mild dismay; usually he projects such a cold, unfriendly aura that nobody dares sit within two seats of him. He\u2019s seen this girl in a few classes before, but he can only barely remember her name. It\u2019s something like Ramona, or Rowena\u2026 Or maybe it\u2019s neither. She turns to Dan, brandishing a strong, confident smile. \u201cI\u2019m Roshina.\u201d <i>Ah. Neither.</i> \u201cYou\u2019re Dan, right? The guy who dropped out and then\u2026 dropped in again.\u201d </p><p>She tips her head back and cackles for a second, then begins pulling various things out of the tote bag. Dan grimaces, staring at the little cacti prints decorating the bag. What is it with hipster girls and succulents?\u00a0</p><p>Whilst he\u2019s not thrilled that he\u2019s apparently earned a reputation amongst the student body as the notorious failed quitter, he hasn\u2019t the energy to challenge her on it.</p><p>\u201cGuess so,\u201d he replies in a mutter.\u00a0</p><p>He opens his laptop again, hoping it might signal to her that he\u2019s busy, and not up for a conversation. Of course, every line of the article is like having someone plunge a fresh, thin needle into his chest, slowly stitching the word\u00a0\u2018fool\u2019 into his skin. But his need for information about Phil is as urgent as his need for water. He can\u2019t look away.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOoh, I love that guy,\u201d Roshina says, leaning in towards Dan to read the article as well. She leans her elbow on the back of his seat, the coffee in her hand hovering close to Dan\u2019s nose; it\u2019s something chai-spiced. Dan recoils as subtly as he can, pressing himself into the opposite edge of the chair.\u00a0</p><p>The article includes a photo of Phil behind a podium, his glasses on, wearing an impassioned expression, mouth open halfway through some dramatic statement or other.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf I were as famous as him and I\u2019d just, like, lost my hot rich husband,\u201d Roshina says, loudly, right into Dan\u2019s ear,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d have no shame. I\u2019d be applying to Big Brother or Love Island. Just shows there are some blokes willing to do the decent thing after all!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Dan cannot imagine why Roshina thinks he\u2019d care what she might hypothetically get up to in her fantasy version of Phil\u2019s life. He imagines Phil sneering at this girl\u2019s audacity, saying something snippy and derisive like: <i>\u2018And if I were as vapid as you, I\u2019d perhaps rethink my decision to pursue a career in the legal field, as it\u2019s highly unlikely anyone\u2019s going to hire a solicitor with bubblegum pink hair</i><i>.\u2019 </i>It makes Dan smile, just a bit, and then in the next second, he\u2019s back to being a bitter old maid.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t give him too much credit,\u201d Dan grumbles, eyes stuck to the photo of Phil, spewing some boring line about domestic abuse like he didn\u2019t need to be practically dragged to his own divorce settlement by the cuff of his ear.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s probably getting a buttload for all these appearances.\u201d</p><p>She snorts at him, rather loudly and obnoxiously considering this is, as far as Dan remembers, their first conversation. \u201cDon\u2019t you read Perez Hilton? He keeps zilch. All profits from his public appearances go to the charity he\u2019s promoting at the time.\u201d</p><p>Dan throat suddenly feels very dry. <i>All profits? What\u2019s he living on? </i>He scrolls down the page a bit more; Roshina jabs at his screen suddenly with a short, green fingernail. She\u2019s pointing to another article advertised at the side of this one, with the headline: <i>\u2018Give and Thou Shalt Receive: Phil Lester spotted with Possible New Man\u2019.</i></p><p>\u201cClick that one!\u201d Roshina squeals excitedly. \u201cIt was just posted!\u201d</p><p>Dan is about to tell Roshina in a clipped, irritable tone that he would rather pick up her fluffy pen and drive it into his eye, but she\u2019s already batting his hand away, apparently oblivious to social etiquette. He\u2019s trapped in his seat, forced to watch as she clicks the baiting link. A photo pops up at once, taken through an open car door, of Phil crammed into the back seat with Martyn and a \u2018mystery\u2019 person. Except it\u2019s not a mystery-person. Not to Dan, and not to the author of this article, who has, to their credit, obviously done their homework.\u00a0</p><p>Dan shifts uncomfortably as Roshina laps up the photo, eyes round and gleaming. He feels nauseous, and the smell wafting from her latte is not helping. Not that anything helps the sickness that sits at the bottom of his belly perpetually nowadays. Ever since he re-enrolled, courtesy of his doting and quietly ecstatic parents, Dan has been off food, off socialising, off anything much except sitting in his room scrolling through the endless media cycle of Phil-related articles.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSays here this dude used to be Nikolai\u2019s\u00a0photographer!\u201d Roshina exclaims. Dan says nothing. He doesn\u2019t want to entertain speculative notions that just because PJ, who used to work for Nikolai, has been papped in Phil\u2019s proximity, that it means they\u2019re dating. Even the idea of it has Dan gripping the hard plastic of his armrest to staunch his wave of paranoia.\u00a0\u201cPJ Ligouri is a UK-based photographer that jumped ship from Nikolai\u2019s press team alongside his former PA Cornelia Dahlgren. The latter is currently dating Martyn Lester, Phil\u2019s older brother. Suspicions of PJ\u2019s involvement with the younger Lester were first aroused when he was noticed photographing Phil\u2019s appearance at last month\u2019s Climate Change Festival-\u201d</p><p>Dan slams the lid of the laptop closed so suddenly that Roshina squeaks, yanking her fingers away just in time.\u00a0\u201cBattery\u2019s low,\u201d he mutters, folding his arms across his chest. He sinks down in his seat, intending to stay that way until the lecture starts, letting the white noise of Roshina\u2019s indignant voice keep his intrusive and unpleasant thoughts of Phil and PJ, and all the things they might be doing, at bay.\u00a0</p><p>*<br></p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Martyn says, \u201cit\u2019s Corn for you. She wants a private word.\u201d </p><p>Phil frowns, not looking up. \u201cTell her I\u2019m the wrong brother to call for that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe says it\u2019s pretty serious,\u201d Martyn says, ignoring him.\u00a0</p><p>Phil lets out a frustrated sigh, letting the open file he\u2019s been reading fall to the couch cushion beside him. The Red Cross have sent him a buttload of information that he needs to know inside out before his address at the United Nations conference later today. He\u2019s been back and forth with the Red Cross for weeks through phone calls and emails trying to get up to speed, but there\u2019s so much to know in such a short space of time. He has to look like he\u2019s dedicated to this project, and he is, but the UN invited him last minute - he hasn\u2019t had a lot of time to prepare.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019ll have even less time if Cornelia keeps pestering him about schedules and meetings or whatever this is about. Of course, despite her constant bothering, Phil would lick the soles of her comfortable-but-cool sneakers to keep her around. She\u2019s a scarily good Press Agent, Phil has no idea how Martyn ever took her on back when they were rivals. They work much better as a team, sharing the role for Phil on a voluntary basis, whilst working a few other part-time jobs.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSomething about a girl with blue hair?\u201d Martyn prompts, and Phil\u2019s heart skips.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHand it over.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSay please to your big brother,\u201d PJ scolds from the other end of the couch, though he doesn\u2019t look away from his phone screen, which he\u2019s been Skyping his girlfriend on for the past half hour. He angles the phone at Phil, pulling his headphones out of the jack; Sophie\u2019s round, sweet face fills the screen.\u00a0\u201cSoph, tell him to use his manners. You\u2019re a lady.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUse manners,\u201d Sophie says, then pulls up her nostrils to look like a snout.\u00a0\u201cBut I\u2019m no lady.\u201d<br></p><p>Phil smiles at her, but his heart is pounding too violently to give her a proper response. He holds his hand out for the phone in Martyn\u2019s hand instead. PJ plugs his headphones back in, voice lowering.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, Corn,\u201d Phil says as soon as the phone is against his ear. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Cornelia says, then clears her throat. She\u2019s not diving straight in to whatever she has to say, so Phil immediately knows this is a sensitive topic. He stands from the uncomfortable sofa he\u2019s sat on, moving over to the window, as far away from Martyn and PJ as he can get in this tiny room. \u201cSo, Mona Kemp just contacted me. You remember her? From The Secret of the Alps hotel.\u201d </p><p>Phil rolls his eyes. \u201cYes, I remember the manager of my prison cell, funnily enough.\u201d </p><p>She clears her throat again. \u201cRight. Yeah. Well, apparently they\u2019ve just rented out your suite for the first time since you left.\u201d </p><p>Phil waits, but Cornelia seems to need prompting. \u201cUh huh\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the new guests, um, found something.\u201d </p><p>The tiny workers controlling Phil\u2019s brain are suddenly thrown into uproar, frantically combing through his memory for any inkling of what incriminating item he might have left in that godforsaken place. His jaw clenches so hard he can feel a twitch, but he stoically stares through the glass pane to hide his panic from the other people in the room.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was like a\u2026 recording device?\u201d Cornelia says, and Phil wishes he could see her in the flesh, read her expression to know how bad it is.\u00a0</p><p>Although they\u2019re both technically in the same building, the United Nations Headquarters are impossibly huge. She\u2019s downstairs somewhere amongst the thousands of behind-the-scenes worker bees, making arrangements with press and security for the conference. It\u2019ll be hours before she finds her way back up to this bare, lifeless green room they\u2019ve been given use of.\u00a0</p><p>His eyes flutter closed, picturing Dan, stood defiantly at the foot of a four-poster bed in his wrongly-buttoned shirt, his soft cheeks pink from exertion, spewing garbled information about a thieving girl with blue hair, and how she\u2019d recorded him arguing on the phone.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMona seemed to know who\u2019d put it there somehow, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Cornelia continues in a harried voice. \u201cShe said it was the daughter of some family that won a holiday up there. Anyway, obviously this device is a serious breach of privacy, and I\u2019m sure that if you wanted to press charges-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d </p><p>Phil pinches the bridge of his nose between his forefinger and thumb, conscious of saying too much in case he alerts Martyn, who is already at maximum stress level, and probably listening right behind him. The seams of Phil\u2019s head are bursting, still crammed with straggles of information about water filtration systems and monthly overseas school supplies. He can\u2019t take this in right now, can\u2019t be bothered to give an annoying fangirl brat with an inflated ego the time of day. And on top of that, he cannot listen to Cornelia pretend she hasn\u2019t already listened to that recording, whatever it is, from start to finish.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on it, Cornelia? Don\u2019t play dumb.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause; Phil looks over his shoulder and catches Martyn\u2019s eye. He immediately tries to busy himself with meaningless tasks, neatening files and shoving PJ\u2019s lighting equipment into the corner of the room. Phil turns back to the window, shaking his head. Martyn is just as much of a dirty snoop as his fianc\u00e9 is. They\u2019re made for each other. </p><p>At last, Cornelia speaks. She sounds like she\u2019s moved somewhere with less people in the background. \u201cThere\u2019s a few. They\u2019re\u2026 mostly x-rated.\u201d </p><p>A deep, dizzying flush sweeps down Phil\u2019s body, and he feels his mind threatening to fold inwards on itself. Thanks to a herd of mediation and personal response trainers that Nikolai had him spend weeks with years prior, Phil is able to keep himself relatively calm. He breathes in through his nose, out through his mouth, and stays quiet for a minute whilst he thinks of something to say that will help the situation. </p><p>\u201cSend the recordings to me,\u201d Phil instructs after a moment. He keeps expecting a sudden surge of anger to well up inside of him - at the blue-haired girl, at Nikolai, at Dan, at himself even - but all that floods through him is a deep, swirling melancholy, dappled with peaks of intense regret. \u201cAnd for the love of God don\u2019t show anyone else. Especially my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd tell Mona thank you for\u2026 being discreet.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t need to check that Mona had quickly and quietly taken the recording device down with a crisp, dismissive explanation to the new guests. He also doesn\u2019t need to check that she hadn\u2019t listened to them herself; Mona is an honest, rule-abiding woman, and would never dream of such a thing. He should send her a fruit basket one day. \u2026When he can afford fruit baskets again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Cornelia assures him. \u201cWhat do you want to do about the girl?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe blue-haired girl. She could have really messed things up-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do anything,\u201d Phil says sternly. \u201cShe wants attention. Notoriety. Don\u2019t give her any.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust send me those recordings. Then get rid of any copies you or anyone else has, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d He hesitates. \u201cPerv.\u201d </p><p>She giggles.\u00a0\u201cSounds to me like you\u2019re the perv, mate. Not sure I\u2019d have let someone blindfold me on the first shag, he must\u2019ve been really into you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off, Corn,\u201d Phil says tiredly, no venom in his voice, then hangs up.\u00a0</p><p>He goes back to his case files with a weight in his chest. They\u2019re suddenly a lot harder to take in.\u00a0<br></p><p>*</p><p>The bed Phil currently calls his own is far less luxurious than the one he used to sprawl out in when he was a resident of The Secret of the Alps hotel. It\u2019s barely even a bed, really, as it pulls out from a couch, but Phil never bothers folding it away, as he\u2019s only ever in here to sleep. Sleep is what he should be doing right now, in fact, but there\u2019s no way he could drift off right now, not after hearing what he\u2019s just heard. </p><p>Phil stares at the battered play button on the audio player window that\u2019s open on his laptop, which balances on his knee. If he clicks it again, it will be the fifth time he\u2019s heard the final recording Cornelia sent over, which is far too many times to be reasonable. She certainly hadn\u2019t been wrong in her description of the audio. X-rated is possibly even a little demure.\u00a0</p><p>He worries his lower lip between his teeth, hand long ago having reached beneath the covers to ease some of the intense pressure between his legs. He shouldn\u2019t click play again. The other person in this recording is long gone, and his quick exit was more than enough of a message that he doesn\u2019t want to be found. There\u2019s no point in torturing himself with Dan\u2019s ghost. His\u2026 incredibly hot ghost. His fingers press more insistently against his crotch.\u00a0</p><p>Just then, an email from Cornelia pings up in the corner of Phil\u2019s screen. He whips his hand away from his pyjama trousers, feeling very weird about doing any such thing whilst his sister-in-law-to-be is contacting him. To distract himself from the urgent pulses of arousal coming from beneath the covers, he clicks the email.<br></p><p><b>From: Mona Kemp<br>To: Cornelia Dahlgren<br><br></b></p><p><b>Fwd: Phil Lester</b></p><p><i>Dear Ms Dahlgren,</i></p><p><i>On my first attempt to send over the recordings, it appears the hotel\u2019s rather dated computer system failed to include this final, rather short one. I\u2019ve attached it in this email. Once I\u2019ve confirmed you have received it, I shall dispose of the recordings altogether. </i></p><p><i>Please send Mr Lester my sincerest apologies again for the atrocious breach of privacy. I no longer have his contact information, but he is welcome to get in touch with me for a formal apology, and we would be more than happy to compensate him with a free stay whenever he might choose to return. </i></p><p><i>Sincerely,</i></p><p><i>Mona Kemp<br>Hotel Manager of The Secret of the Alps</i></p><p>Upon reading the line \u2018free stay whenever he might choose to return\u2019, Phil lets out a loud snort. Poor Mona. He\u2019ll never tell her, but he\u2019d have to be dragged back onto that cable car kicking and screaming. Even then, he\u2019d probably beg Kaspar to hurl him out of it before they reached the summit. He\u2019ll see how he feels about another trip up there in a few years, perhaps with time his stint there won\u2019t feel as traumatising.\u00a0</p><p>He clicks the attached recording, readying himself for yet another auditory reminder of his sordid, expletive-riddled, excruciatingly hot fling with Dan. There\u2019s a crackle as it begins playing, and Phil turns up the volume, straining to hear anything more than a few vague rustles. This doesn\u2019t sound like the other recordings. Perhaps the device had just picked up Phil talking in his sleep or something.</p><p>And then, he hears Dan\u2019s voice.\u00a0<i>\u201cPhil?\u201d</i> It\u2019s quiet, but clear as a bell.\u00a0<i>\u201cPhil.\u201d</i></p><p> Phil sucks in a breath. It\u2019s not that three months have wiped the memory of Dan\u2019s voice from his mind, but when he hears it echo through his eardrums, it\u2019s usually the words he spat in that last argument, when he\u2019d announced he was leaving, as if Phil wouldn\u2019t give a damn. He hasn\u2019t thought of Dan\u2019s softer, sweeter voice in some time. He\u2019d forgotten how Dan could sound, at times, without the strain of lust or fury warping his vocal chords.\u00a0</p><p>Then there comes a muffled \u2018thump\u2019, followed by a grunt of pain. </p><p><i>\u201cWha?\u201d</i> Phil\u2019s voice says. </p><p>Phil clicks pause and checks the timestamp for the recording. It reads 02:01am on 14th April. That\u2019s the day Dan left. Early in the morning. How come he can\u2019t remember this? </p><p>His heart thuds, coming to the gradual realisation that he\u2019s listening to a conversation he\u2019s never heard before. One he never even knew had taken place. Had Dan come to say goodbye to him after all? Has Phil been living under the impression that Dan had snubbed him, ran off without a word, when really\u2026</p><p>Phil sits up straighter, turning the volume up to the highest level. He clicks play again.\u00a0</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cDid you watch the stream of your fave giving his rousing speech at the UN?\u201d Roshina asks as she settles herself into the seat beside Dan\u2019s again. </p><p>Silently, Dan begs her to sit literally anywhere else, but her mind is apparently closed to telepathy. He wonders if she\u2019d believe he\u2019s suddenly been struck totally deaf. Unlikely, but it might be worth a try if it meant he didn\u2019t have to\u00a0talk about Phil again today; he\u2019s only just stopped crying for long enough intervals to make it to class. </p><p>\u201cYeah, uh, think I saw some clips on Twitter,\u201d Dan replies, aiming for the sweet spot between vague and already-up-to-speed.\u00a0</p><p>In truth, he watched it start to finish, at 1am because of the time difference, hunkered over his laptop in bed, tears streaming down his face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGod, wasn\u2019t he marvellous?\u201d she sighs, hauling a load of books and pens she won\u2019t use out of her tote again. <i>Yes, he was.</i> \u201cHe can hold a room for sure. I think it\u2019s \u2018cause you can tell he\u2019s passionate about this. \u201d She grins at him.\u00a0\u201cOr maybe it\u2019s because of his deep, sexy voice. D\u2019you think?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Dan stares back at her, wondering if she genuinely expects him to respond with words.\u00a0\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Luckily, she doesn\u2019t seem too bothered about Dan agreeing. She pulls out her phone and begins cycling through her social media apps with the concentration of an atomic physicist.\u00a0\u201cOh look,\u201d Roshina exclaims just when Dan thought he might get a moment of peace, \u201cour man is trending.\u201d</p><p>Dan digs his fingernails into his palm. <i>Don\u2019t look. Just don\u2019t look.</i> \u201cCan I see?\u201d he asks, hating himself. </p><p>She angles her phone at him. There are two hashtags pertaining to Phil. The first is #AmazingPhil. The second is #PhilsUNSpeech. Roshina clicks the first, and scrolls slowly down a timeline of people enthusing about Phil\u2019s fiery yet intelligent speech which he gave at the United Nations headquarters yesterday afternoon, about the poverty crisis in several African countries. He seems to have really knocked it out of the park, judging by the response he\u2019s getting. Dan drinks the raining compliments down greedily, trying to glean, selfish though it may be, what Phil\u2019s mental state might be right now, in reaction to all the sudden attention directed his way. One particular tweet catches his attention.\u00a0</p><p>@nikolaischmikolai: saw #amazingphil at the airport after the conference! such a cool guy, didnt get a selfie cos he was in a hurry to get his flight but he signed my ticket with a Muse quote! #inspiration</p><p>Back at the airport, Dan notes. Already jet-setting off to his next glamorous public appearance. It won\u2019t take long until people start throwing money at him for all this\u00a0\u2018charity work\u2019. They\u2019ll give him a Netflix documentary series, or a book deal, or any of the other wank that just gets handed to celebrities.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLucky guy, seeing him IRL. I wonder what he\u2019s like in person,\u201d Roshina ponders, scrolling through more tweets.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAn emotionally stunted, obnoxious adrenaline junkie with no filter on the silver spoon stuck in his gob,\u201d Dan mutters, before realising he said that slightly too loud. Roshina is staring at him oddly. He shrugs, pinkening. \u201cI imagine, anyway.\u201d </p><p>Thankfully, before Roshina can respond, Professor Warren calls the class to attention, flicking the PowerPoint to the title page, which reads, \u2018Marital Dissolution: The Litigation of Separation and Divorce\u2019. The irony is stifling. </p><p>*</p><p>Sleep is closing in on Dan from all sides. He\u2019s trying to resist the urge to slip into blissful unconsciousness, but Professor Warren\u2019s baritone voice is making it so difficult to stay alert. His eyelids sag, then shut entirely. It\u2019s just as the waves of promised unconsciousness are beginning to draw him out into that sweet, deep void that the door of the lecture hall opens with its hideous squeak. Dan frowns, inching down further in his uncomfortable chair to try and get away from the noise. </p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d a loud, plummy voice calls, interrupting Professor Warren mid-flow. Dan frowns harder; the voice is instantly grating, as if it knows to burrow straight beneath Dan\u2019s skin. It skims along the shores of his half-dream, splashing through the shallows in the distance, but Dan is too far out to be reached. \u201cIs Dan Howell in this class?\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes snap open. </p><p>\u201cYoung man, I am in the middle of a lecture!\u201d Professor Warren replies in his gruff, incredulous voice, the one he uses in seminars to pick on students who haven\u2019t done the reading. Dan\u2019s been on the receiving end of this voice rather too often. \u201cI must insist that you wait outside until-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Professor, but this can\u2019t wait,\u201d the voice says, even louder. \u201cDan Howell? Dan, are you in here?\u201d </p><p>A slight Northern tinge is detectable beneath the upper-class overtones. Chills course down Dan\u2019s arms. This cannot be happening. He sneaks a glance at Roshina; her mouth is a round, pink circle, eyes bugged out so far it looks almost cartoonish. He looks left and right, noting that several people are also turning his way, alight with excitable intrigue. It\u2019s no use. He\u2019s going to have to confront this\u2026 situation. Dan sits up just enough that he can peer through the shoulders of the people in front of him, to the short flight of stairs that lead up to the lecture hall door. </p><p>It\u2019s beyond surreal, to take in the sight of Phil, here, in this dingy light-less hall, looking exactly the same as ever, but somehow startlingly different. He feels as though the image of him has smacked sharply into the back of his head. In the next moment, Dan realises that Roshina has literally smacked him. </p><p>\u201cYou <i>know</i> him?!\u201d she hisses, incensed. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you <i>say</i>?\u201d</p><p>Phil lets out a suffering sigh that makes Dan\u2019s teeth grit together. He\u2019s gazing out across the rows of students as if he were surveying his Kingdom. Dan hunches over, trying to hide. There must be a hundred people in here, thank heavens.\u00a0Suddenly, Roshina has her green-taloned claw on his upper arm; she hauls him up with surprising strength, though he does his best to struggle free.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil calls out a second time to the general room, ignoring the fact that Professor Warren looks to be on the verge of spontaneous combustion, \u201cI kind of <i>know</i> you\u2019re in here. Could you just\u2026 I need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Dan swallows, feeling the back of his neck prickle from how many eyes are on him now. Phil isn\u2019t wearing his glasses; perhaps he\u2019s blinder than Dan assumed he was, as Roshina now has him in a vice grip, ensuring he stays bolt upright in the chair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just dawned on me who you are, young man,\u201d Professor Warren says then, cold, \u201cand I\u2019m sure in your world this kind of disruptive behaviour is tolerated. But this is an academic setting, not a press interview. Please leave my lecture. You may speak with whomever you like in an hour.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDan, I know you\u2019re in love with me,\u201d Phil says, with a sweet, butter-wouldn\u2019t-melt smile. \u201cI think we should talk about that, maybe.\u201d </p><p>Cheeks furiously flaming, Dan looks down at his folding desk covered in meagre study tools for some kind of murder weapon. The best he has is a laptop charger, which he might be able to fashion into some kind of lasso and choke Phil from afar if he really tried. Stifled snickers erupt behind people\u2019s hands, and practically everyone is staring at him now. With little other option, Dan shoots to his feet, stuffing everything in his bag. He doesn\u2019t give Phil the satisfaction of meeting his eye, but as he\u2019s finally shut his gob, Dan reckons the dickhead has spotted him at last. </p><p>Bag slung over one shoulder, Dan forces his way past Roshina\u2019s fishnet-wrapped knees, then past a few other amused students to the aisle. He stalks down the stairs as quickly as possible, head down. He can sense Professor Warren\u2019s disapproving glare on him; this little stunt will not earn him any favours, and he\u2019s already on the Prof\u2019s list of ne\u2019er-do-wells. Once he begins the climb of stairs towards the hall doors, Dan finally lifts his head to aim his icy expression at the infuriating human that has inexplicably decided to saunter in and humiliate Dan like no time at all has passed. The corner of Phil\u2019s mouth is lifted just a tad. Dan had honestly forgotten, what with all the heartache, just how punchable he is. </p><p>He says nothing, just grabs Phil by the upper arm and marches him up the remainder of stairs, then through the doors. Once they\u2019re outside the lecture hall, which opens directly onto the main outdoor campus, Dan lets go of Phil like he\u2019s burning, and strides across the tarmac, feeling the burn of mortification stinging him from all sides. Of course it\u2019s raining, Dan thinks as he walks, the scent of rain-soaked concrete misting the air.</p><p>It\u2019s not long before he hears footsteps hurrying after him. \u201cDan, wait!\u201d </p><p>Furious, Dan stops in his tracks and whirls around. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d </p><p>Phil comes to an abrupt halt in front of him, eyes round. He blinks at Dan, mouth parted; for a moment, Dan is equally dumbstruck. Seeing him so close, after months of only glimpsing him through a screen, is disconcerting. Was he always this stunning? Did Dan really somehow grow used to the vivid, swirling blue of his eyes?\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 could ask you the same question,\u201d Phil says after a while.\u00a0<br></p><p>The annoying non-answer immediately slaps Dan back from gooey-ville. He gives Phil a withering look. \u201cI\u2019m a student here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought you dropped out.\u201d</p><p>Dan grits his teeth again. How is it that Phil always knows to pick at the very knots Dan doesn\u2019t want to unravel?\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, I dropped in again.\u201d\u00a0He folds his arms across his chest. To his utter dismay, a smattering of the students milling around the campus plaza have begun to look up from their phones and tablets. There\u2019s a lot of pointing and murmuring going on, presumably because \u2018Amazing Phil\u2019 has appeared out of the blue to fight with some normie. \u201cWhy\u2019d you have to announce to the entire hall that I\u2019m \u2018in love\u2019 with you?\u201d Dan demands, pointedly using air quotes to convey the ridiculousness of that concept. \u201cI have to finish out the year with the people in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, you <i>don\u2019t</i> have to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start with the whole \u2018you gave up on giving up\u2019 thing. I know, okay? I\u2019m back exactly where I was before we met, hating every aspect of my life. But we can\u2019t all be famous charitable heartthrobs.\u201d</p><p>Phil smirks, his lowered eyelashes catching tiny droplets of rain. \u201cHeartthrob?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Dan says, one hand coming to his damp forehead, \u201cwhat do you <i>want</i>?\u201d</p><p>An actual crowd of people is forming around them, seemingly oblivious to the fact they\u2019re all steadily getting soaked. Dan wants rather badly to bolt far away from this spot. But that would mean leaving Phil behind, again, and annoyed though he is, he just can\u2019t wrench himself away a second time, not when he\u2019s only just reappeared. Phil shifts, pulling his smart jacket tighter, eyeing the people gathering around them. Several of them have unsubtly pulled out their phones to film this exchange.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI had this dream,\u201d Phil says, inexplicably.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, Martin Luther King,\u201d Dan says dryly,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure your doting fans would love to hear all about it, so just look into one of these nice people\u2019s lenses and remember to speak clearly-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had this dream that you crawled into bed with me,\u201d Phil interrupts, continuing as if Dan hadn\u2019t spoken. An eruption of titters spills from their group of onlookers; Dan has to close his eyes and breathe to stop himself from stepping forwards and kicking Phil in the kneecap. \u201cIn the middle of the night. And you asked me to give you a reason to stay with me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Immediately, the backs of Dan\u2019s eyes strain and ache, pushing tears into his ducts. He wills the rain to fall harder, to disguise his reaction in case he can\u2019t keep the tears from spilling over.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd in my dream,\u201d Phil continues, \u201cI couldn\u2019t think of a reason. I just thought\u2026 you must already know how much I like you. I\u2019d told you so many times that you were constantly on my mind. I\u2019d done stupid, reckless things to be with you for just a few hours. I\u2019d left my husband. But there you were, in my dream, asking me for something more. I couldn\u2019t understand what it was you wanted me to say. I didn\u2019t have anything left. Nothing I could think of that might stop you leaving.\u201d<br></p><p>The rain is soaking through Dan\u2019s t-shirt, sticking it to his skin. He shivers, trying to let the alien words fold into his drizzled, muddy mind.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late for this,\u201d Dan points out, toeing the tarmac with the tip of his trainer, watching the light grey slabs slowly pinpricking with dark circles. \u201cAnd it was just a dream, like you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought of a reason, though.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes lift. He wants to say he doesn\u2019t care, that their brief attempt to grasp at the wisp of some connection that sparked between them was doomed from the start. The chance has passed them by - they\u2019re no longer up a mountain with only each other for company, they\u2019re back in the gritty rainy reality of their starkly different lives.\u00a0</p><p>But he also aches, body and soul, to know that reason. The thing Phil never said, that Dan has imagined him saying every day since. God help him, he yearns to hear it more than he yearns for oxygen in his next breath. So he says nothing, lips pressing tight.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI was really lonely,\u201d Phil says, grimacing as a fat raindrop strikes his pale cheek. \u201cI spent three years in a far off retreat nobody knew about, cut off from everything I\u2019d known. The cold of that place, along with the isolation\u2026 I think it seeped into my bones. I just went numb. I forgot how to feel anything.\u201d </p><p>Dan looks away, casting his gaze around the people on the periphery of this strange conversation, all of them listening intently, so ready for some dramatic story to add to their social media timeline. </p><p>\u201cAnd then you came,\u201d Phil says, apparently oblivious to the entourage. \u201cLike you\u2019d been flung up the mountain by mistake. You had no more clue why you were there than anyone else. And you were so\u2026\u201d he heaves a sigh, running fingers through damp, dark hair. \u201cSo fucking <i>annoying</i>.\u201d</p><p>A ripple of laughter goes up around them; Dan chokes out a cough of indignation. \u201cIsn\u2019t this supposed to be a reason you wanted me to stay?\u201d </p><p>Phil smiles, showing the barest hint of teeth. \u201cYou got on every single one of my nerves. It was like you\u2019d specifically been planted there to piss me off. Everything about you was just\u2026 so frustrating.\u201d </p><p>Dan cocks a suggestive eyebrow, because it\u2019s decidedly his turn to embarrass Phil after the many things he\u2019s inferred about Dan so far. On camera.\u00a0\u201cThere were occasions where Louise had to pull me aside and cool me off so I wouldn\u2019t beat you with your ski pole. So don\u2019t think it was one-sided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s just it,\u201d Phil says, taking a teensy step closer. Dan\u2019s backpack strap is sodden, and his face is misted with moisture, but he can\u2019t seem to make himself move an inch, because Phil - god damn him - looks fucking incredible all wet, in a Mr Darcy-emerging-from-the-lake sort of way. \u201cYou made me feel things again. Sure, most of the feelings were anger and exasperation, but it was still better than the void that was there before.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWow. I don\u2019t know what to say. This is all so romantic,\u201d Dan says scornfully; their audience titters, and Dan feels a small surge of pride that this time they\u2019re laughing with him. \u201cAre you getting to some kind of point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil says, laughing. \u201cI was so alone, and I owe you so much.\u201d</p><p>Dan snorts, turning on his heel. <i>Enough.</i> \u201cThat\u2019s a line from Sherlock, you dick-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m fucking about, I can do better,\u201d Phil pleads, grabbing his arm. Dan thinks about pulling away, but he settles for just turning to glare some more, very aware of Phil\u2019s touch, how his warm, wet fingers feel even through the soggy material of his t-shirt.\u00a0\u201cHow about\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil is really close to him now, his deep thinking cutting a crease between his brows. The rain has deflated his quiff, making it stick to his forehead. Somehow, even with a makeshift emo fringe, he looks infinitely radiant. Dan imagines that in comparison, he resembles a drowned rat, his hair frizzed and unattractive, and it\u2019s all being caught on film, which is fantastic. Phil drops his voice to a murmur, presumably so it can\u2019t be picked up by people\u2019s shitty phone mics.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cArguing with you every day, up in the heavens of fucking nowhere\u2026\u201d Phil shrugs, smiling. \u201cThat was the most fun I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>A droplet spills from Dan\u2019s left eye, and he wipes it away, furious with himself for allowing it to leak out. \u201cWow,\u201d he chokes out. \u201cYou must have been really bored up there.\u201d </p><p>Phil nods, eyes trained on Dan\u2019s traitorous smile. \u201cIs that\u2026 your way of saying you don\u2019t hate my guts?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan feels himself tense. Phil\u2019s hand is still on his arm, and his thumb strokes gently over the damp skin just below his sleeve. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t provide you with, like, champagne or- or um, suites in fancy hotels or\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He trails off, because he\u2019s allowed himself to look into Phil\u2019s eyes properly for the first time; they really are so many separate shades of blue. There must be dozens of colours in their depths. He\u2019d have a job naming them all.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll settle for the occasional kiss between battles,\u201d Phil replies.\u00a0<br></p><p>Dan splutters softly, cheeks warm against the shivering rest of his body. His eyes flit to their audience, several of whom have their hands over their hearts and mouths. </p><p>\u201cNot here,\u201d Dan replies, taking a hasty step backwards. \u201cLet\u2019s, uh,\u201d he glances around for a break in the crowd, \u201clet\u2019s go somewhere\u2026 less here.\u201d </p><p>He turns before Phil can answer, pushing through a throng of camera-faced people, letting Phil find his way to catch up. They get halfway across the campus main square before Phil says coolly, \u201cnot to ruin the theatricality of this moment, but where are we going?\u201d </p><p>Dan looks at him, then stops in his tracks. <i>Crap.</i> \u201cY-you can\u2019t come back to mine.\u201d He blushes, fidgeting. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 living with my parents. At the moment.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Phil says, dithering.\u00a0\u201cNot ideal.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhere are you staying?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil hesitates, and Dan has to prod him in his damp ribs to make him answer aloud. He sighs eventually. \u201cSusan.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s eyebrows shoot towards the rainclouds above them. \u201cYour plane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. S\u2019all I\u2019ve got to my name right now, pretty much.\u201d </p><p>Dan nods, considering this for all of about five seconds. He can already sense that they\u2019re beginning to be followed. Dan grabs Phil by the wrist. \u201cShe\u2019ll do.\u201d </p><p>*</p><p>Considering what a smooth, relaxed pilot Phil is, Dan is genuinely baffled by how terrifying he is as a driver.\u00a0Phil has parked Susan on some farmland about two miles from campus; the owner of the plot had recognised Phil\u2019s plane when he\u2019d landed it in the local airport and practically jumped at the chance to offer him a place to stow it - presumably to earn himself some bragging rights for bestowing his hospitality on a semi-celebrity. </p><p>This suspiciously good samaritan also gave Phil use of his truck for the day, as the farm is in the middle of nowhere, and Phil needed a way to get to Dan\u2019s university campus. The truck is an old, squeaky thing caked in mud; as far as keeping a low profile goes it does a grand job, but it doesn\u2019t reek of safety. For most of the journey, Dan is clutching the ceiling handle, shrieking whenever another car comes the other way as Phil careers them down narrow country lanes at sixty miles per hour. </p><p>Eventually, after Dan has come worryingly close to crapping his pants, they reach the field where Phil\u2019s plane is sat, less shiny than Dan remembers her, but just as intimidating. The rain is easing up, but it\u2019s left the green countryside dripping and muddy; Dan is not particularly looking forward to trekking across the wet grass.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m literally never getting in a car with you again,\u201d Dan states vehemently, legs shaking as he steps out of the truck. </p><p>\u201cWimp,\u201d Phil says dismissively, slamming his door closed. The sound echoes around them, bouncing off the trees that fringe the field. \u201cI\u2019m just a little rusty. There\u2019s less traffic in the sky.\u201d </p><p>As his heart settles back into its normal rhythm, Dan shuts his own door and follows Phil across the grass to the plane. Phil presses a button as they approach and a short set of steps protrude in a neat glide from Susan\u2019s door. </p><p>\u201cMissed you, babe,\u201d Phil says, hopping onto the first step before it\u2019s completely extended. </p><p>Dan blanches, nearly slipping on a patch of wet grass. \u201cUh, what?\u201d</p><p>Phil looks over his shoulder, amusement coating his expression. \u201cI\u2019m talking to Susan.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh. Yeah. I- I know.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughs and ducks inside the plane. Dan looks around at the vast, endless fields that surround them, startlingly green and lush from the burst of rainfall. There\u2019s nothing for miles aside from a tiny farmhouse in the distance; they\u2019re alone together again. It\u2019s a different kind of deserted expanse to the snow-covered mountains, but a familiar sense of isolation hovers in the air.\u00a0</p><p>Susan\u2019s sleek interior has changed since Dan saw it last. For one thing, what little floor space had been at the back of the plane has been largely taken up by a pull-out bed. It\u2019s unmade, the covers rucked and creased, which in the cramped area makes the whole place look messy. Phil shimmies around the bed to a what looks like the counter of a small bar, opening a neat pull-out contraption that reveals a sink. There\u2019s a kettle too, which Phil holds under the faucet.</p><p>\u201cUh, so you live here? Permanently?\u201d </p><p>Phil nods.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Dan mutters, toeing the empty red bull can on the floor near the bed. \u201cQuite the fall from grace. How are you coping without 24-hour maid service?\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u2019not so bad,\u201d Phil says with no apparent hint at insincerity. He kneels on the bed and leans over to grab the red bull can, which he then throws into the bin, rather stylishly. \u201cAt least here I\u2019m not in debt to anyone.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo you own the plane, then?\u201d </p><p>Dan sits gingerly on the bed, mainly because there is nowhere else to sit apart from the two seats in the cockpit, and he can\u2019t even look in that direction without blushing. It seems both long ago and entirely too recent that he was sat there with Phil knelt before him, high above the peaks of the Swiss mountains. He seems to remember, from his last visit, more seating in the back here, but as he studies the bed he\u2019s perched on, he realises that this <i>is</i> the seating, folded out into a small double bed. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil replies, pouring boiling water into mugs. \u201cNikolai let me have this and the ring.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyebrows raise. \u201cYou\u2019d think he could\u2019ve spared a couple of\u2026 million.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t, actually. It would\u2019ve detracted from my trustworthiness, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean about all the charity stuff you\u2019re doing?\u201d </p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Phil affirms, lifting both mugs and carefully sitting on the bed beside Dan. He hands one over, and Dan takes it. He doesn\u2019t particularly feel like tea, but then he is wet and slightly chilly from the rain, so it will probably help chase the cold from his bones. \u201cSo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Dan echoes. </p><p>They lapse into silence, blowing on their scorching drinks. Eventually, Dan abandons his, knowing it will be too hot to drink for some time. He places it carefully on the shelf beside the bed. \u201cI need to ask you something,\u201d Dan says. </p><p>\u201cYes, the theories are right, I am naturally ginger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>Dan shakes his head. \u201cNot\u2026 what I was gonna ask. It\u2019s about that dream you mentioned.\u201d He hesitates, heart squeezing tightly.\u00a0\u201cDid you\u2026 remember anything else about it?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Strangely, Phil shifts away from him. It\u2019s a telling movement, and even though Dan\u2019s not been around him for some time, he\u2019s ninety percent sure that the expression Phil\u2019s features are forming is something like \u2018sheepishness\u2019. He squints at the older man as a gut feeling blooms that he\u2019s going to want to throttle him within the next few minutes.</p><p>Phil swallows tightly, placing his own mug on the floor. \u201cWell. I don\u2019t really need to, um. Remember.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d </p><p>Phil grimaces, seeming wary of Dan\u2019s reaction, then reaches beneath the bed, drawing out a Macbook. \u201cThis is Martyn\u2019s old one,\u201d Phil says when he catches Dan\u2019s raised eyebrow. \u201cNik kept mine.\u201d </p><p>A wave of sympathy washes over Dan from head to toe, swiftly followed by a surge of anger for Nikolai Novokoric. Phil opens the Mac and clicks around a bit, then turns to Dan, clear concern dressing his face. </p><p>\u201cSo, you remember that girl? With the blue hair?\u201d </p><p>*</p><p>Ten minutes later, Dan is sat in gobsmacked silence, his own confession of love reverberating through the air. No use denying it now. \u201cThat little fucker.\u201d </p><p>Phil winces. \u201cYeah.\u00a0Well, anyway, Mona and Cornelia destroyed all the copies.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes bulge. \u201cExcept this one!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell yeah,\u201d Phil says. His mouth twitches, and Dan zeroes in on it. \u201cBut\u2026 I reckon I\u2019m allowed to have one.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sweet.\u201d Phil nudges him with his elbow. \u201cAnd, y\u2019know\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, please enlighten me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 pretty hot.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s frown deepens. \u201cThat\u2019s a strange choice of adjective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe not the part where you bear your soul to me in a largely embarrassing midnight confession,\u201d Phil says, so Dan hits him in the arm, \u201cbut the other recordings-\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Other</i> recordings?!\u201d </p><p>Phil pauses, caught out. \u201cOh. Uh, yeah. From what I can gather the recording device began recording any time it picked up noise, so there are a few\u2026\u201d </p><p>He trails off, and Dan buries his face in his hands for a few seconds, then takes a deep inhale, straightening up. \u201cShow me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot sure this is the best time-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil, that\u2019s a recording of me doing a variety of explicit deeds. Fucking play it to me.\u201d </p><p>Phil hesitates, scanning Dan\u2019s face, then shrugs, pulls up a different recording, moves the play bar to the middle, and hits the space key. </p><p>\u201c<i>Kiss me,</i>\u201d Dan\u2019s voice says, husky and breathless. \u201c<i>Kiss me and then fuck me.</i>\u201d </p><p><i>Regret, regret, regret- </i>Dan lunges for the laptop, slamming the space bar. Unfortunately, he manages to press another key as well, and a different recording pops up. Before either he or Phil can do anything to stop it, Nikolai\u2019s voice is pouring from the speaker.</p><p><i>\u201c\u2026my God, don\u2019t tell me you actually top in this-\u201d</i></p><p>Phil slams the lid of his laptop shut smartly, two pink spots appearing on his high cheeks. \u201cI\u2019ll delete these, I think.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s fingers push into his temple, massaging the spot. \u201cSo good of you to hang onto them until now, you wanker.\u201d</p><p>Silence falls, and for a moment the tension is taut to the point of being unbearable. Then, Dan hears a quiet, barely audible giggle. He looks at Phil, incredulous, and immediately upon seeing the creases of laughter around his glinting eyes, feels a swell of laughter bubbling up in his own chest. The tension snaps, and they let their streams of laughter spill out. Phil cards a hand through his hair, reaching for his tea again. </p><p>\u201cY\u2019know,\u201d Dan says, eyes glazed as he watches Phil\u2019s plump, pink lips seal over the rim of his mug, \u201cyou\u2019ve already lured me into your\u2026\u201d he gestures to the plane interior. \u201cDen. Kind of redundant at this point to play it cool.\u201d</p><p>Phil looks at him quizzically, sipping. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, as you have clear, recorded evidence of my unfortunate attachment to you right there,\u201d Dan says, stretching out on the bed a little more, settling into the familiar atmosphere of mildly absurd, irritation-fuelled hysteria, \u201cand I willingly endured your death-defying driving skills, then followed you into your plane in the middle of nowhere, it might be a reasonable assumption that I\u2019m, like,\u201d Dan waves a hand in the air between them, \u201cD.T.F.\u201d </p><p>Phil chokes around a mouthful of tea. He places the mug down sharply, eyes wide. It makes Dan laugh, and he leans back onto his hands. As it turns out, having every last scrap of his dignity laid out before them both is rather empowering. He has nothing left to hide, no reason to be coy, and it\u2019s now up to Phil whether he takes advantage or not. Dan really hasn\u2019t anything else to lose, at this point, sad though that thought might be.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to <i>assume</i>,\u201d Phil objects, scandalised, \u201cI\u2019m trying to be a gentleman!\u201d</p><p>Dan nods gravely. \u201cBy playing me audio recordings of me asking you to \u2018kiss and fuck me\u2019?\u201d </p><p>Phil\u2019s mouth opens, as if he\u2019s about to retort, but at the sight of Dan\u2019s smirk, he closes it again, a laugh escaping. \u201cIf I do one of those things now, can you pretend I waited until, y\u2019know, a respectable amount of time had passed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could pretend I had a sudden urge to shuck off my wet clothes,\u201d Dan suggests with a hand thrown across his forehead for emphasis; he\u2019s enjoying the unusual sensation of having the power over this situation, and as usual when he feels even a lick of power, his theatric flair rears its head. It doesn\u2019t matter that his heart doubled in speed as soon as Phil hinted at physical contact. \u201cAnd then,\u201d Dan continues, voice as dramatic as if he were addressing a theatre-ful of patrons, \u201cas you\u2019re finding me a spare shirt to cover my immodesty, you can\u2019t help your gaze lingering on my bare skin - you try to stop yourself, but your hand reaches out of its own accord to stroke across my chest - my breath hitches, and-\u201d</p><p>Phil dives across the bed, pinning Dan to the mattress and kissing him. \u201cHmm,\u201d he mumbles into the seam of Dan\u2019s lips, \u201cI forgot you never shut up.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s arms come up to wind around Phil\u2019s neck, a zing of pure joy ricocheting through his body as his familiar weight settles on top of him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten that you\u2019re ten times more tolerable to listen to when you\u2019re naked,\u201d Dan says, turning his head to urge Phil to kiss along his jaw. \u201cPlease comply.\u201d </p><p>Phil chuckles, leaning up to pull his shirt off. \u201cBetter?\u201d </p><p>A punch of air leaves Dan\u2019s chest; his hands spread themselves over Phil\u2019s toned stomach, re-learning the crevices either side of his belly, the smooth curvature of his hips.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMuch.\u201d His index fingers trace the line of hair that leads from Phil\u2019s tummy button beneath the waistband of his trousers. He pulls at the waistband impatiently. \u201cEven better without these though, I reckon.\u201d </p><p>Phil sits back on his haunches, positioning himself on top of Dan\u2019s thighs. \u201cYeah?\u201d he asks, already sliding the zipper down. Dan\u2019s cock pulses, still trapped by his jeans. Phil is putting on a show, but Dan no longer has the ability to call him out on it. His eyes won\u2019t unstick themselves from the sight of Phil shimmying his trousers down his thighs, revealing a pair of black boxer briefs so tight that they might as well be nonexistent for all they manage to conceal. \u201cHow\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>Dan shoots him what he intends to be a\u00a0withering look\u00a0that probably doesn\u2019t come across very menacing. \u201cI don\u2019t remember you being this vocal.\u201d</p><p>Phil smiles, using Dan\u2019s shoulder to steady himself as he peels the trousers off entirely. \u201cShut me up, then.\u201d </p><p>Not needing to be told twice, Dan grabs the backs of Phil\u2019s thighs and manoeuvres him back until he\u2019s sprawled on his back. He pulls off his own t-shirt, getting more impatient by the minute to entwine himself in Phil as deeply as possible; he\u2019s been starving himself of this, for months, and now he wants to feast. As soon as he\u2019s free of his t-shirt, Dan begins pushing his lips against the miles of bare skin covering Phil\u2019s upper body. Phil\u2019s breathing goes strange and stuttery, and his hand loses itself in Dan\u2019s hair. </p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he whispers as Dan seals his mouth over a nipple, \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill talking to Susan?\u201d Dan asks with a snort, and Phil smacks him lightly in the back of the head. </p><p>\u201cSusan doesn\u2019t talk back nearly as much.\u201d</p><p>In response, Dan chooses to trail a line of kisses downwards, through the valley of Phil\u2019s pectoral muscles, over the plane of his stomach, nipping gently at that tantalising rivulet of hair slicing through his pelvic region. When he gets to the boxer briefs, he pauses, lifting his gaze as he tucks his fingertips into the waistband. </p><p>Phil makes a sort of choking noise as their eyes meet, which is pleasant to hear. \u201cLift,\u201d Dan tells him, and when his hips rise, pulls them off in a flourish. Dan had thought the thick, gorgeous shape of Phil\u2019s cock was deeply ingrained into his memory, but even the image he\u2019d conjured up in the dead of night, when he couldn\u2019t stop himself from indulging in nostalgia, had been lacking in the exquisite detail of reality. He takes hold of the base in one hand, letting the warm, pulsing flesh push all thought from his mind. \u201cI missed you too,\u201d he says, and Phil whimpers. </p><p>Dan takes his time blowing Phil, letting him glide in and out of his mouth as he lifts his head and sinks down again and again. Phil\u2019s body slackens, sinking into the hard mattress so totally that it\u2019s as if he hasn\u2019t relaxed once in all the time that\u2019s passed since they last did this. The sensation of Phil atop Dan\u2019s tongue is comforting in its thickness, stretching his lips wide, reminding him of how it feels to be so open. He would like for Phil to know this, wants to share the intoxicating power of utter vulnerability. He pulls off, suddenly alight with an idea, and sits up, crawling over Phil\u2019s spread body until his face hovers above Phil\u2019s.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know what Nikolai mentioned,\u201d Dan begins, testing the waters.\u00a0</p><p>Instantly, Phil\u2019s hands stop wandering over his back. \u201cAre you seriously bringing up my ex-husband right now?\u201d</p><p>Dan chuckles, then sweeps a tongue over his lower lip, tasting Phil there, salty and sour; Phil\u2019s eyes fall to the movement with obvious interest.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just been thinking,\u201d Dan continues, determined to persevere with the thought if it could lead where he hopes it might. To soften the blow of blindsiding Phil with Nikolai\u2019s name, Dan dots a few light kisses over his jaw. \u201cWhen we\u2026 did things before. Were you just indulging me, because I suggested we try it a certain way, and it was my first time?\u201d</p><p>Phil arches his head backwards, wordlessly encouraging Dan to move his lips to his neck. \u201cW-what do you mean? It was always amazing with you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Dan says, sucking gently at the spot right below Phil\u2019s ear. \u201cSo you never wanted to do it a different way? Like\u2026\u201d His hand, which has been resting on Phil\u2019s hip, trickles over his thigh, dipping into the cavern between Phil\u2019s legs. He lets his fingers wander even lower, past the swell of his balls. He watches Phil\u2019s face intently, trying to gauge the reaction, and presses the tip of one finger to the tight, puckered entrance at his rear. \u201cThis way?\u201d </p><p>For the first time, Dan is able to witness the crystal blue of Phil\u2019s irises thinning and nearly disappearing entirely, swallowed up by the black holes widening in their centres. It\u2019s not until Dan removes his finger that Phil is able to summon a response. </p><p>\u201cI- I don\u2019t have much of a preference,\u201d he whispers, stammering. \u201cIs\u2026 is that something you\u2019d want to try, or-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil,\u201d Dan interrupts, feeling the smile teasing the corner of his mouth as he sees through Phil\u2019s poor attempt at nonchalance, \u201cdo you want me to fuck you?\u201d </p><p>Phil is quiet for a moment, but Dan holds his gaze, one eyebrow cocked, hopefully looking far more in control of himself than he feels. The elbow he\u2019s using to hold himself up begins to tremble, threatening to give way, but he holds steady, needing to hear Phil speak the words. </p><p>Then, Phil nods, just once. \u201cYes.\u201d </p><p>Dan smiles, leaning in to seal their mouths together. The eagerness with which Phil responds conveys his excitement, and Dan lets him twine their tongues together, allows Phil\u2019s arms to draw him in around the neck. After a few minutes however, Dan\u2019s self-control is reaching its very peak, what with Phil\u2019s cock trapped between their bodies still, and the anticipation of what it might be like to slip inside of him lurking so tantalisingly on the horizon. </p><p>Dan unwinds himself carefully, sitting up and reaching for the button of his own jeans. \u201cDo you have, um, stuff?\u201d </p><p>His question prompts Phil into immediate action; he sits up, peeling himself off the bed in order to stagger over to an overhead cupboard, which he reaches up to open. Dan\u2019s fingers stumble on the zipper of his jeans, attention ensnared by the sight of the lean, naked body in front of him, stretched out in a delicious long line of pale, pure skin, hiding terrains of thick muscle, tightened by years of diligent workouts. His cock strains against the fly of his trousers, imagining what it might be like to bury himself inside of such a temple; his fingers work frantically to open the zip. Eventually, Phil finds what he\u2019s looking for, and throws a bottle of lube and a four condom packets onto the bed. </p><p>Dan picks a few of the foil packets up, eyebrows raised. \u201cI\u2019m flattered that you presume so highly of my stamina, but-\u201d</p><p>Phil shuts him up using the method he seems to be realising is the most effective - jumping back on the bed and kissing him hard. \u201cThought we could take it in turns,\u201d Phil growls into Dan\u2019s mouth, because obviously he\u2019s intent on driving Dan to the brink of insanity.\u00a0</p><p>A strangled noise escapes Dan\u2019s throat, and he pushes Phil backwards until he\u2019s astride him again, back to pulling off his jeans, which thankfully goes a lot more smoothly this time. He slides his underwear off too, then reaches for the condom packet, ten steps ahead of himself; Phil\u2019s hand on his arm makes him pause. </p><p>\u201cWoah, uh, it\u2019s not my first rodeo but I\u2019m probably gonna need a little prep before-\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Dan mutters, throwing the condom aside for a moment. He shakes his head, blood thrumming in his ears, and smooths his hands up Phil\u2019s gorgeous thighs. \u201cSorry. Okay, what do I do?\u201d </p><p>Phil sits up, reaching for the lube, and un-pops the cap. \u201cWant me to do it?\u201d</p><p>Dan snatches the bottle from him. \u201cFuck right off.\u201d </p><p>He pours some of the gloop onto his fingers, remembering how, when they\u2019d done this before, Phil had warmed the substance before letting it touch his skin. He copies the action, coating his hands with it, then looking to Phil for further instruction. Phil opens his legs wider, allowing Dan to fit himself between them.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever done this to yourself?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOnly since you did it to me,\u201d Dan admits before he can stop himself. </p><p>Phil grins, unsubtly conveying his thoughts around this, and Dan only barely resists the urge to flick him in the balls. \u201cSame thing, then,\u201d Phil says.</p><p>\u201cWill it hurt?\u201d</p><p>Phil eases himself back down onto his elbows. \u201cDoubt it,\u201d Phil answers in a soft sigh. He lets out a little moan as Dan\u2019s fingertips press against him. \u201cFuck. No, I don\u2019t think this is gonna hurt at all.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s fingers slide into Phil as easily as if he were pushing them into warm bread dough. The walls of hot, soft muscle close in around him, drawing each finger deeper as he adds them one at a time. Phil murmurs vaguely bossy commands, telling him to scissor and stretch, but half the words are lost to his groans of bliss, each one making Dan shudder more violently than the last. </p><p>\u201cUgh, Dan,\u201d he says, voice desperate despite it seeming like barely any time has passed. He has one hand wrapped around the back of his right thigh, holding it up to allow Dan better access. Dan moves closer, brushes Phil\u2019s hand away and lets the crook of Phil\u2019s knee drape over his shoulder. \u201cFuck,\u201d Phil mutters, but doesn\u2019t protest. \u201cY-you can stop now,\u201d he urges, but Dan keeps on, wanting to be totally sure. Phil seems so tight, so <i>impossibly</i> tight, and whilst it is maddening to picture thrusting inside of such tightness, the thought of hurting Phil without meaning to is terrible enough to keep Dan stretching with his fingers, just in case. He changes the angle just slightly when his wrist threatens to cramp, and Phil swears, louder than he has so far. \u201cFff-<i>uck</i>. Do that again.\u201d </p><p>Dan does do it again. He does it many more times, pressing the pads of his fingers to that same spot until Phil is writhing against the covers, until his gasps sound more like gurgles, until his hands are scrabbling at Dan\u2019s wrist to pull his fingers free. </p><p>\u201cFuck, Dan please, I\u2019m ready, I\u2019m ready,\u201d he garbles. </p><p>For a long moment, Dan is too hypnotised by the wrecked, flushed mess that\u2019s become of the Adonis-like man sprawled out naked before him to react. He stares at Phil\u2019s reddened, slick lips, puffy from where he\u2019s been biting them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil chokes out, desperate. </p><p>The sound of his name slaps Dan back into coherence. He pats the space around him, searching for the condom packet he\u2019d thrown aside before. It seems to elude him for a while, but eventually he finds it, and rips the packet with his teeth. Thankfully, condoms are a part of sexual experience that he is not out of his depth with, as Beth had insisted on him using at least one, sometimes more, whenever they slept together. </p><p>He rolls it on with ease, thankful for the many opportunities he\u2019s had to practice for this moment, and takes hold of Phil by the hips, dragging him forwards with a sharp tug, until the head of his cock is aligned with Phil\u2019s slick opening. Phil is staring at him in amazement, and Dan doesn\u2019t blame him - he\u2019s exuding a confidence born purely of adrenaline, and it\u2019s making him into someone unrecognisable, someone composed and assertive. Someone hot.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asks; his shaky voice somewhat shatters the illusion. </p><p>\u201cGod, yes,\u201d Phil replies, apparently not noticing.\u00a0</p><p>Dan inches his hips forwards, letting the head of his cock press past the outer rim; Phil\u2019s head tips backwards, a sigh of ecstasy spilling from his throat. His hand releases its grip on the covers, and he brings his long fingers to wrap around his cock. </p><p>Even the sight is intoxicating. Ignoring all other sensation for now, Phil looks maddeningly good this way; Dan\u2019s hips almost lock in place, just watching him <i>feel</i>. The thin branches of Phil\u2019s neck bones are protruding beneath the skin, mottled from where Dan has nipped and bitten. His puffed chest is rising and falling rapidly, his shoulders trembling, misted with a sheen of rainwater and sweat. He ducks his head again, meeting Dan\u2019s eyes, and Dan remembers he\u2019s supposed to be moving, that he is supposed to be the one in control of this. He doesn\u2019t feel very in control, suddenly, too shaken by the onslaught of sensation attacking from all angles. </p><p>As if he\u2019s gleaned these concerns from Dan\u2019s mind through osmosis, Phil says, \u201cwait,\u201d and Dan pauses, terrified he\u2019s done something wrong. Phil sits up, glazed and sluggish, then pushes Dan backwards with a hand against his shoulder. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wr-\u201d </p><p>Dan lands back on his tailbone, and suddenly Phil is astride him, piled in his lap like a huge, gorgeous, naked gift. He angles himself without needing to look, keeping his eyes locked on Dan\u2019s the whole time, and sinks himself back down onto Dan\u2019s cock, lips parted, eyes fluttering. A moan pours out of Dan\u2019s throat as the unexpected bliss crashes over him, as the sensation of slick, hot, closeness grips him by the soul. He is buried inside of Phil\u2019s pure, angelic body, as far as he can get. It\u2019s agony, because Phil has gone still, letting himself adjust to the intrusion. Dan\u2019s head falls against Phil\u2019s chest, trying to keep calm when he wants so badly to shout at Phil to move even slightly, would trade everything he owns for the relief of it. </p><p>And then, miraculously, Phil does. </p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Dan whispers, brokenly, as Phil\u2019s hips begin rolling forwards. </p><p>His fingers dig themselves into Phil\u2019s arms, and he buries his face deeper into Phil\u2019s chest. Phil\u2019s arms wind around his shoulders. He lifts his hips up until Dan almost slips out of him entirely, then spears himself back down with a shudder. </p><p>\u201cGod, <i>Dan</i>,\u201d Phil groans, speeding up the pace. He uses his grip on Dan\u2019s shoulders to keep steady, bouncing up and down in Dan\u2019s lap faster and faster, barely letting Dan gasp even a snatch of air. \u201cDan- Dan, would you touch me?\u201d</p><p>Delirious, Dan mentally berates himself for not having the common sense to do this before now. He reaches clumsily between their bodies, barely holding himself together, and closes a fist around Phil\u2019s cock, which is hot and rigid to the touch. He pumps his hand in time with the thrust of Phil\u2019s hips, and in less than a minute Phil is crying out, biting down on Dan\u2019s neck so hard that Dan wonders if he might bleed. Phil\u2019s come splashes Dan\u2019s chest and stomach, coating his hand, and all Dan can think is how he wishes he could taste it.</p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t last much longer after that, as Phil doesn\u2019t so much as stutter in his rhythm. He manages to push his hips upwards a few times, to make the most of this miraculous moment, locked together with Phil in the most intimate possible way. As the tip of his cock presses once again into that spot that makes Phil weak, Phil jerks and gasps in his arms. That\u2019s the moment that Dan is unable to hold on any longer. He squeezes Phil\u2019s arm, groaning into the crook of his neck as he feels his own release fill the condom, a hundred white-hot stars scorching over his skin in a brilliant, blinding shower. </p><p>For a minute after, they don\u2019t move, draped over one another in various ways, just reorienting themselves as they float back to this dimension. Dan pushes his lips against Phil\u2019s damp skin in a way that doesn\u2019t feel chaste enough to be kisses. Eventually, Phil leans backwards, slowly lifting himself off Dan\u2019s lap, letting him slip out. With a shaky, fumbling hand, Dan pulls off the condom, putting it carefully on the floor because he\u2019s too spent to dispose of it properly just yet. </p><p>In the next moment, he feels damp fingers around his wrist, and then Dan is being pulled, until he\u2019s flat on his back, Phil\u2019s arm stretched out beneath his neck. They both stare at the ceiling, listening to the sound of their own gradually slowing breaths. </p><p>Dan rolls onto his side towards Phil, trailing fingers up his ribs, then into the cavern of his underarm, twisting the snatch of hair there between his fingers. He\u2019s sweaty, and it\u2019s still confusing to Dan that it doesn\u2019t gross him out; instead, the musky, heavy scent of Phil\u2019s perspiration is intoxicating, makes him want to bury his face in Phil\u2019s shoulder and lick the moisture from his skin. So he does. </p><p>Phil turns to peer at him, amusedly. \u201cPerv.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan smiles, not caring that it seems peculiar, because he knows Phil doesn\u2019t really care.\u00a0\u201cWas it okay?\u201d Dan asks, as if he isn\u2019t fully aware of how beyond incredible the last half hour had been for both of them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAmazing,\u201d Phil replies, rolling onto his side to kiss him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m as good as you at\u2026 that.\u201d </p><p>Phil\u2019s mouth twitches, and he leans back to stare into Dan\u2019s eyes. His pupils are returning to a more even size, though they\u2019re still taking up most of the space in Phil\u2019s irises. The ring of azure around them glimmers brightly. </p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t sell yourself short, mate,\u201d Phil says. \u201cI had a <i>very</i> good time.\u201d</p><p>Dan snorts, mostly at Phil\u2019s use of the word \u2018mate\u2019. \u201cSo you prefer it, then? Being like\u2026 the one who\u2026 um.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBottoms?\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s only response is a mortifyingly quick blush. </p><p>Phil laughs, prodding Dan\u2019s red cheek with his finger-tip. \u201cI mean it. I don\u2019t have a strong preference for either way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just Nikolai seemed so, like, surprised when he found out-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil says, already grimacing, \u201cI\u2019m only gonna address this once with you, because I don\u2019t particularly want you thinking about this in detail, but having sex with Nikolai is a very different experience to having sex with you. And not in a good way. Could you ever imagine him being as considerate of my preferences as you\u2019re being right now?\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s nose wrinkles. \u201cYou have a point. So\u2026 you\u2019re good with either? Top or bottom?\u201d </p><p>The flame in Dan\u2019s cheeks is fanned even saying the words. \u201cHmm,\u201d Phil says, then leans in to kiss Dan again, harder this time, knocking him backwards until he\u2019s on his back again. \u201cThink I might need a reminder of what it\u2019s like to top again. Y\u2019know, just so I have all the evidence before I make up my mind.\u201d </p><p>\u201cJesus, you\u2019re more of a horn-dog than I remember,\u201d Dan laughs, though he\u2019s already winding a leg around Phil\u2019s to pull him closer. </p><p>*</p><p>They\u2019ve been holed up in Phil\u2019s tiny living space, at the back of a stationary plane, mostly naked, for almost twelve hours. They\u2019d napped for a while, but now they\u2019re awake, watching an episode of Parks and Recreation because Phil has never seen it and Dan simply cannot allow anyone he associates with to not get his references to the show. </p><p>Somewhere in the middle of one of Leslie\u2019s rousing speeches, Phil\u2019s phone beeps. It\u2019s not the first beep they\u2019ve both pretended not to hear, and it\u2019s perhaps for this reason that now Phil sighs and reaches for it, his other arm around Dan\u2019s shoulders, fingers tickling idly across his upper arm. He frowns at the many messages filling the screen, scrolling through a few, then placing the phone upside down on the bedside shelf again. The amusing dialogue of the show loses its potency; Dan waits, breath held, for the inevitable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna have to get back to work soon,\u201d Phil says, just as Dan predicted. \u201cI kind of\u2026 ran off on Martyn and Cornelia and PJ after the UN thing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI figured,\u201d Dan says, already resigned. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It was, um. Good to see you, and stuff. Weird without all the snow and altitude. But good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d Phil says. From the way he has the offer so readily at hand, Dan knows he\u2019s been holding it back for a while. He pretends he hasn\u2019t heard, instead focusing on the screen, where Leslie has just fallen into a giant pit. <i>Relatable</i>. Phil nudges him beneath the blanket with one foot. \u201cDan, did you hear me?\u201d </p><p>Dan sighs, struggling out of Phil\u2019s embrace. They should have talked about this sooner. Now they\u2019re going to fight, and one of them\u2019s going to hurt the other, and then they\u2019ll split apart again for an indeterminably long bout of miserable, awful separation. </p><p>\u201cI heard you.\u201d </p><p>Dan runs a hand through his still-damp hair. They\u2019d had showers a while ago in Phil\u2019s tiny closet-shower. Though it would have been extremely nice to have stood beneath the spray together, there was no possible way they could both fit, so they took it in turns. Dan had gone first, and when he\u2019d emerged, Phil had made more tea, and produced a packet of biscuits. He\u2019d given Dan a robe - stolen from The Secret of the Alps, he noticed - for him to dry off and set him up with the laptop to watch Parks and Rec until he\u2019d cleaned himself of the evidence of their debauchery too. It had been wholesome and unusually soft behaviour; entirely too easy to fall into, and forget that their circumstances didn\u2019t allow for such kind, sweet interludes without a price. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even want to be a lawyer,\u201d Phil says, like it\u2019s as simple as that. \u201cJust think it over a bit more-\u201d </p><p>\u201cI did that,\u201d Dan snaps, then checks himself, breathing deeply. If he can avoid getting upset and defensive, that would be ideal. \u201cI already did the freaking out and running off to re-evaluate my choices. It didn\u2019t work. You were there, you <i>know</i> it didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>Phil shuts the laptop, cutting off the peppy American voices of the Parks and Rec cast. \u201cWhat exactly didn\u2019t work, though? What did you expect to happen up there?\u201d </p><p>Dan laughs humourlessly, gesturing between them. \u201cNot this.\u201d He winces. It came out meaner than he intended it to. \u201cI mean, obviously I\u2019m glad I met you and we dragged each other into a destructive pattern of secretly bonking behind closed doors\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cHeartfelt,\u201d Phil replies; even though it\u2019s sarcasm, Dan can tell without looking over at him that he\u2019s smiling. </p><p>\u201c..but, even you have to admit it probably wasn\u2019t the smartest decision on my part. Or yours, come to that.\u201d Dan picks at the thin, messy bedclothes, frowning. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m very good at the self-reflective stuff. S\u2019just better if I crack on, stop fantasising that there\u2019s some dream career waiting in the wings somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving a job that makes you happy isn\u2019t a crazy fantasy, Dan,\u201d Phil says. He makes everything sound so easy. Dan kind of misses that about him, dangerous and seductive though it is. \u201cYou could come with me. We could work it out together.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCome with you where?\u201d Dan asks, turning to him incredulously. \u201cNo offence, mate, but you\u2019ve got no more clue than I have right now. You have no money or plans, you said it yourself. It\u2019s very admirable, all the charity stuff, but what\u2019re you gonna do when the public grow bored of you without all the divorce drama? How are you gonna fund your humanitarian schemes?\u201d</p><p>Phil shrugs, a composed, slightly amused smile gracing his features. He looks entirely unbothered by these questions, and Dan is suddenly so envious of his ability to shrug off anxiety that it makes a spurt of anger shoot through his chest. He rolls his eyes, throwing the covers off his legs. He\u2019s about to get up, to find his clothes and put an end to this brief day-cation from reality, when Phil\u2019s hand on his arm, gentle and cautious, gives him pause. </p><p>He waits, the warmth of Phil\u2019s fingers draining the frustration from his bones, easing the tension in his body. Phil shuffles closer, hands sliding to rest on Dan\u2019s shoulders, then rubbing gently, thumbs digging into the knots of taut muscle. It\u2019s so glorious that Dan sinks back into him, immediately slackening, his mind abruptly washed of every concern that had just been plaguing it. </p><p>\u201cHas anyone ever told you that you think too much?\u201d Phil murmurs into his ear. </p><p>\u201cI get the feeling you\u2019re about to,\u201d Dan retorts, then feels a satisfied sigh slip out as Phil digs his clever fingers in deeper. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to Africa,\u201d he says in a low, soothing voice that Dan knows is probably one he\u2019s been trained to use in stressful situations, but works so well that he can\u2019t be bothered to protest. \u201cThere\u2019s a cluster of villages in Kenya that need a lot of help. Installing water filtration systems, building schools, that sort of thing. That\u2019s where I\u2019m going next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right.\u201d Dan\u2019s shoulders tense up again. <i>Africa. Could he be jetting off further?</i> \u201cHow long f-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should come with me,\u201d Phil says for the third time. His hands become still on Dan\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m serious. We could use you out there.\u201d</p><p>Dan rolls his eyes, though Phil is behind him and can\u2019t see. \u201cAs convincing as that is, we both know I have the muscles of a cooked noodle, so I doubt I\u2019d be much use to you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not always about physical labour,\u201d Phil interrupts, like he\u2019s prepared this argument months in advance. He\u2019s too good at debating, that\u2019s the trouble. Dan\u2019s never stood a chance trying to last in the ring with him. \u201cYou\u2019ve got other hugely beneficial skills, I\u2019ve seen it myself. You can fix pretty much anything you put your mind to. That\u2019s kind of extraordinary.\u201d</p><p>Dan blinks, not sure how to react to the unexpected praise. \u201cWell\u2026 I don\u2019t know about \u2018anything I put my mind to\u2019-\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven so, you\u2019d probably have a hell of a lot more clue than I would,\u201d Phil points out, and Dan has to admit, although he\u2019s never witnessed Phil attempt to repair or even patch up anything beyond his own fragile ego, he doubts very much that he\u2019d be particularly skilled at it. He tries to imagine Phil with a spanner in his hand, tightening the joins in the municipal pipe under the blaring, scorching African sun. He has to hide his bubble of absurd laughter. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of the heat,\u201d Dan protests, weakly.\u00a0</p><p>Whilst this is true, and he\u2019d deliberately chosen the destination of his last runaway attempt to be the opposite of somewhere hot, Dan can feel his soul yearning for the adventure. For being with Phil, daily, their perpetual bickering exacerbated by the blazing sun, and then soothed by the cool night air, locked away in some dark room they\u2019d built together, free to kiss each other\u2019s sun-blistered skin all night long. His fingers itch for the fantasy, and he clenches them into fists, knowing he shouldn\u2019t dare to so much as want it.</p><p>Phil places a kiss to his shoulder, then leans away. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d Phil says, making Dan\u2019s heart sink. \u201cI mean, when you\u2019re so passionate about law, a little sunshine seems laughable doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Dan rolls his eyes, but a laugh escapes anyway, so he turns to whack Phil in the arm. Phil lets him, then catches him by the wrists, holding Dan\u2019s gaze. \u201cI think you could be happy. I think we could make each other happy.\u201d </p><p>One of Dan\u2019s eyebrows arches. \u201cI think we\u2019d drive each other bonkers.\u201d </p><p>Phil smiles. \u201cSame thing, I reckon.\u201d </p><p>Dan shakes his head, knowing in every cell of his being that this is completely mental, to abandon his life again for a man who infuriates him daily. But he also knows, perhaps even more strongly, that he\u2019s as in love with Phil as he is exasperated with him. \u201cIf I leave again\u2026 I won\u2019t be able to come back.\u201d</p><p>Phil squeezes his hands around Dan\u2019s. \u201cNo,\u201d he agrees. \u201cMe neither.\u201d</p><p>Dan chews his lip, though his resistance has more or less melted away. \u201cAre you only offering to take me with you because you feel sorry for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil says, teasingly.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m rescuing you from a life of paperwork and office parties.\u201d A smile breaks across his gorgeous face, making his eyes soften, crinkle at the sides. His voice drops into its rare tone of sincerity. \u201cDan, I\u2019m asking you if you\u2019d come with me. Because I watched you attempt to ski away from me up a hill and fall straight down it, and somehow managed to fall tragically, pathetically in love with you in the same instant. I want you to come. Because don\u2019t really fancy trying to stay away from you anymore.\u201d </p><p>*</p><p>Dan\u2019s not sure how it happens really. One minute, he\u2019s in a lecture hall with the most annoying girl on the planet talking his ear off about succulents and her hot personal tutor, and the next he\u2019s in the front seat of a fully-fuelled plane, beside a stunningly handsome philanthropist-slash-ski-enthusiast-slash-pilot, headed for a continent halfway around the world. He hasn\u2019t told his parents where they\u2019re going yet. Phil hasn\u2019t told the public, or Pj or Cornelia or Martyn. It\u2019s all a bit\u00a0\u2018up in the air\u2019. They\u2019ll tell anyone who needs to know when they land again, when the intense rays of sun are soaking into their pale skin, flooding their veins with Vitamin D. </p><p>Dan reaches across the chasm between his and Phil\u2019s seats, letting his hand dangle invitingly until Phil notices and takes it, rolling his eyes and telling Dan he\u2019s a \u201cright sap\u201d. But he threads their fingers together anyway, angling the yoke towards the sky, and Dan leans back in his chair as the clouds zoom closer, welcoming the oncoming oblivion. A wild thought swims at him from nowhere, as if it fell straight out of the Heavens:\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019d be just fine if they never had to come down.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>The End.</b></p><p><br></p><p><b>(Yes, there will be an epilogue.

Since his scandalous divorce from Sir Nikolai Novokoric of Switzerland, Lester has become a dedicated philanthropist, using his notoriety which arose during the controversial coverage of the split to spread awareness about domestic abuse, LGBTQ+ discrimination, homelessness, poverty, and many other important global issues. This Tuesday, Lester is expected to appear at the United Nations conference to discuss Third World Poverty\u2026\u2019</i></p><p>The folding seat beside Dan\u2019s is wrenched down, and a young woman with badly-dyed pink hair plops into it, holding a Starbucks cup and an Urban Outfitters tote bag stuffed with books and papers. Dan lowers the lid of his laptop to shift some of his stuff out of the way of her feet. </p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cIs it just me or does it get more rammed in here every week?\u201d the girl says. Dan stares at her in mild dismay; usually he projects such a cold, unfriendly aura that nobody dares sit within two seats of him. He\u2019s seen this girl in a few classes before, but he can only barely remember her name. It\u2019s something like Ramona, or Rowena\u2026 Or maybe it\u2019s neither. She turns to Dan, brandishing a strong, confident smile. \u201cI\u2019m Roshina.\u201d <i>Ah. Neither.</i> \u201cYou\u2019re Dan, right? The guy who dropped out and then\u2026 dropped in again.\u201d </p><p>She tips her head back and cackles for a second, then begins pulling various things out of the tote bag. Dan grimaces, staring at the little cacti prints decorating the bag. What is it with hipster girls and succulents?\u00a0</p><p>Whilst he\u2019s not thrilled that he\u2019s apparently earned a reputation amongst the student body as the notorious failed quitter, he hasn\u2019t the energy to challenge her on it.</p><p>\u201cGuess so,\u201d he replies in a mutter.\u00a0</p><p>He opens his laptop again, hoping it might signal to her that he\u2019s busy, and not up for a conversation. Of course, every line of the article is like having someone plunge a fresh, thin needle into his chest, slowly stitching the word\u00a0\u2018fool\u2019 into his skin. But his need for information about Phil is as urgent as his need for water. He can\u2019t look away.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOoh, I love that guy,\u201d Roshina says, leaning in towards Dan to read the article as well. She leans her elbow on the back of his seat, the coffee in her hand hovering close to Dan\u2019s nose; it\u2019s something chai-spiced. Dan recoils as subtly as he can, pressing himself into the opposite edge of the chair.\u00a0</p><p>The article includes a photo of Phil behind a podium, his glasses on, wearing an impassioned expression, mouth open halfway through some dramatic statement or other.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf I were as famous as him and I\u2019d just, like, lost my hot rich husband,\u201d Roshina says, loudly, right into Dan\u2019s ear,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d have no shame. I\u2019d be applying to Big Brother or Love Island. Just shows there are some blokes willing to do the decent thing after all!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Dan cannot imagine why Roshina thinks he\u2019d care what she might hypothetically get up to in her fantasy version of Phil\u2019s life. He imagines Phil sneering at this girl\u2019s audacity, saying something snippy and derisive like: <i>\u2018And if I were as vapid as you, I\u2019d perhaps rethink my decision to pursue a career in the legal field, as it\u2019s highly unlikely anyone\u2019s going to hire a solicitor with bubblegum pink hair</i><i>.\u2019 </i>It makes Dan smile, just a bit, and then in the next second, he\u2019s back to being a bitter old maid.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t give him too much credit,\u201d Dan grumbles, eyes stuck to the photo of Phil, spewing some boring line about domestic abuse like he didn\u2019t need to be practically dragged to his own divorce settlement by the cuff of his ear.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s probably getting a buttload for all these appearances.\u201d</p><p>She snorts at him, rather loudly and obnoxiously considering this is, as far as Dan remembers, their first conversation. \u201cDon\u2019t you read Perez Hilton? He keeps zilch. All profits from his public appearances go to the charity he\u2019s promoting at the time.\u201d</p><p>Dan throat suddenly feels very dry. <i>All profits? What\u2019s he living on? </i>He scrolls down the page a bit more; Roshina jabs at his screen suddenly with a short, green fingernail. She\u2019s pointing to another article advertised at the side of this one, with the headline: <i>\u2018Give and Thou Shalt Receive: Phil Lester spotted with Possible New Man\u2019.</i></p><p>\u201cClick that one!\u201d Roshina squeals excitedly. \u201cIt was just posted!\u201d</p><p>Dan is about to tell Roshina in a clipped, irritable tone that he would rather pick up her fluffy pen and drive it into his eye, but she\u2019s already batting his hand away, apparently oblivious to social etiquette. He\u2019s trapped in his seat, forced to watch as she clicks the baiting link. A photo pops up at once, taken through an open car door, of Phil crammed into the back seat with Martyn and a \u2018mystery\u2019 person. Except it\u2019s not a mystery-person. Not to Dan, and not to the author of this article, who has, to their credit, obviously done their homework.\u00a0</p><p>Dan shifts uncomfortably as Roshina laps up the photo, eyes round and gleaming. He feels nauseous, and the smell wafting from her latte is not helping. Not that anything helps the sickness that sits at the bottom of his belly perpetually nowadays. Ever since he re-enrolled, courtesy of his doting and quietly ecstatic parents, Dan has been off food, off socialising, off anything much except sitting in his room scrolling through the endless media cycle of Phil-related articles.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSays here this dude used to be Nikolai\u2019s\u00a0photographer!\u201d Roshina exclaims. Dan says nothing. He doesn\u2019t want to entertain speculative notions that just because PJ, who used to work for Nikolai, has been papped in Phil\u2019s proximity, that it means they\u2019re dating. Even the idea of it has Dan gripping the hard plastic of his armrest to staunch his wave of paranoia.\u00a0\u201cPJ Ligouri is a UK-based photographer that jumped ship from Nikolai\u2019s press team alongside his former PA Cornelia Dahlgren. The latter is currently dating Martyn Lester, Phil\u2019s older brother. Suspicions of PJ\u2019s involvement with the younger Lester were first aroused when he was noticed photographing Phil\u2019s appearance at last month\u2019s Climate Change Festival-\u201d</p><p>Dan slams the lid of the laptop closed so suddenly that Roshina squeaks, yanking her fingers away just in time.\u00a0\u201cBattery\u2019s low,\u201d he mutters, folding his arms across his chest. He sinks down in his seat, intending to stay that way until the lecture starts, letting the white noise of Roshina\u2019s indignant voice keep his intrusive and unpleasant thoughts of Phil and PJ, and all the things they might be doing, at bay.\u00a0</p><p>*<br></p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Martyn says, \u201cit\u2019s Corn for you. She wants a private word.\u201d </p><p>Phil frowns, not looking up. \u201cTell her I\u2019m the wrong brother to call for that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe says it\u2019s pretty serious,\u201d Martyn says, ignoring him.\u00a0</p><p>Phil lets out a frustrated sigh, letting the open file he\u2019s been reading fall to the couch cushion beside him. The Red Cross have sent him a buttload of information that he needs to know inside out before his address at the United Nations conference later today. He\u2019s been back and forth with the Red Cross for weeks through phone calls and emails trying to get up to speed, but there\u2019s so much to know in such a short space of time. He has to look like he\u2019s dedicated to this project, and he is, but the UN invited him last minute - he hasn\u2019t had a lot of time to prepare.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019ll have even less time if Cornelia keeps pestering him about schedules and meetings or whatever this is about. Of course, despite her constant bothering, Phil would lick the soles of her comfortable-but-cool sneakers to keep her around. She\u2019s a scarily good Press Agent, Phil has no idea how Martyn ever took her on back when they were rivals. They work much better as a team, sharing the role for Phil on a voluntary basis, whilst working a few other part-time jobs.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSomething about a girl with blue hair?\u201d Martyn prompts, and Phil\u2019s heart skips.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHand it over.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSay please to your big brother,\u201d PJ scolds from the other end of the couch, though he doesn\u2019t look away from his phone screen, which he\u2019s been Skyping his girlfriend on for the past half hour. He angles the phone at Phil, pulling his headphones out of the jack; Sophie\u2019s round, sweet face fills the screen.\u00a0\u201cSoph, tell him to use his manners. You\u2019re a lady.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUse manners,\u201d Sophie says, then pulls up her nostrils to look like a snout.\u00a0\u201cBut I\u2019m no lady.\u201d<br></p><p>Phil smiles at her, but his heart is pounding too violently to give her a proper response. He holds his hand out for the phone in Martyn\u2019s hand instead. PJ plugs his headphones back in, voice lowering.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, Corn,\u201d Phil says as soon as the phone is against his ear. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Cornelia says, then clears her throat. She\u2019s not diving straight in to whatever she has to say, so Phil immediately knows this is a sensitive topic. He stands from the uncomfortable sofa he\u2019s sat on, moving over to the window, as far away from Martyn and PJ as he can get in this tiny room. \u201cSo, Mona Kemp just contacted me. You remember her? From The Secret of the Alps hotel.\u201d </p><p>Phil rolls his eyes. \u201cYes, I remember the manager of my prison cell, funnily enough.\u201d </p><p>She clears her throat again. \u201cRight. Yeah. Well, apparently they\u2019ve just rented out your suite for the first time since you left.\u201d </p><p>Phil waits, but Cornelia seems to need prompting. \u201cUh huh\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the new guests, um, found something.\u201d </p><p>The tiny workers controlling Phil\u2019s brain are suddenly thrown into uproar, frantically combing through his memory for any inkling of what incriminating item he might have left in that godforsaken place. His jaw clenches so hard he can feel a twitch, but he stoically stares through the glass pane to hide his panic from the other people in the room.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was like a\u2026 recording device?\u201d Cornelia says, and Phil wishes he could see her in the flesh, read her expression to know how bad it is.\u00a0</p><p>Although they\u2019re both technically in the same building, the United Nations Headquarters are impossibly huge. She\u2019s downstairs somewhere amongst the thousands of behind-the-scenes worker bees, making arrangements with press and security for the conference. It\u2019ll be hours before she finds her way back up to this bare, lifeless green room they\u2019ve been given use of.\u00a0</p><p>His eyes flutter closed, picturing Dan, stood defiantly at the foot of a four-poster bed in his wrongly-buttoned shirt, his soft cheeks pink from exertion, spewing garbled information about a thieving girl with blue hair, and how she\u2019d recorded him arguing on the phone.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMona seemed to know who\u2019d put it there somehow, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Cornelia continues in a harried voice. \u201cShe said it was the daughter of some family that won a holiday up there. Anyway, obviously this device is a serious breach of privacy, and I\u2019m sure that if you wanted to press charges-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d </p><p>Phil pinches the bridge of his nose between his forefinger and thumb, conscious of saying too much in case he alerts Martyn, who is already at maximum stress level, and probably listening right behind him. The seams of Phil\u2019s head are bursting, still crammed with straggles of information about water filtration systems and monthly overseas school supplies. He can\u2019t take this in right now, can\u2019t be bothered to give an annoying fangirl brat with an inflated ego the time of day. And on top of that, he cannot listen to Cornelia pretend she hasn\u2019t already listened to that recording, whatever it is, from start to finish.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on it, Cornelia? Don\u2019t play dumb.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause; Phil looks over his shoulder and catches Martyn\u2019s eye. He immediately tries to busy himself with meaningless tasks, neatening files and shoving PJ\u2019s lighting equipment into the corner of the room. Phil turns back to the window, shaking his head. Martyn is just as much of a dirty snoop as his fianc\u00e9 is. They\u2019re made for each other. </p><p>At last, Cornelia speaks. She sounds like she\u2019s moved somewhere with less people in the background. \u201cThere\u2019s a few. They\u2019re\u2026 mostly x-rated.\u201d </p><p>A deep, dizzying flush sweeps down Phil\u2019s body, and he feels his mind threatening to fold inwards on itself. Thanks to a herd of mediation and personal response trainers that Nikolai had him spend weeks with years prior, Phil is able to keep himself relatively calm. He breathes in through his nose, out through his mouth, and stays quiet for a minute whilst he thinks of something to say that will help the situation. </p><p>\u201cSend the recordings to me,\u201d Phil instructs after a moment. He keeps expecting a sudden surge of anger to well up inside of him - at the blue-haired girl, at Nikolai, at Dan, at himself even - but all that floods through him is a deep, swirling melancholy, dappled with peaks of intense regret. \u201cAnd for the love of God don\u2019t show anyone else. Especially my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd tell Mona thank you for\u2026 being discreet.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t need to check that Mona had quickly and quietly taken the recording device down with a crisp, dismissive explanation to the new guests. He also doesn\u2019t need to check that she hadn\u2019t listened to them herself; Mona is an honest, rule-abiding woman, and would never dream of such a thing. He should send her a fruit basket one day. \u2026When he can afford fruit baskets again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Cornelia assures him. \u201cWhat do you want to do about the girl?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe blue-haired girl. She could have really messed things up-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do anything,\u201d Phil says sternly. \u201cShe wants attention. Notoriety. Don\u2019t give her any.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust send me those recordings. Then get rid of any copies you or anyone else has, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d He hesitates. \u201cPerv.\u201d </p><p>She giggles.\u00a0\u201cSounds to me like you\u2019re the perv, mate. Not sure I\u2019d have let someone blindfold me on the first shag, he must\u2019ve been really into you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off, Corn,\u201d Phil says tiredly, no venom in his voice, then hangs up.\u00a0</p><p>He goes back to his case files with a weight in his chest. They\u2019re suddenly a lot harder to take in.\u00a0<br></p><p>*</p><p>The bed Phil currently calls his own is far less luxurious than the one he used to sprawl out in when he was a resident of The Secret of the Alps hotel. It\u2019s barely even a bed, really, as it pulls out from a couch, but Phil never bothers folding it away, as he\u2019s only ever in here to sleep. Sleep is what he should be doing right now, in fact, but there\u2019s no way he could drift off right now, not after hearing what he\u2019s just heard. </p><p>Phil stares at the battered play button on the audio player window that\u2019s open on his laptop, which balances on his knee. If he clicks it again, it will be the fifth time he\u2019s heard the final recording Cornelia sent over, which is far too many times to be reasonable. She certainly hadn\u2019t been wrong in her description of the audio. X-rated is possibly even a little demure.\u00a0</p><p>He worries his lower lip between his teeth, hand long ago having reached beneath the covers to ease some of the intense pressure between his legs. He shouldn\u2019t click play again. The other person in this recording is long gone, and his quick exit was more than enough of a message that he doesn\u2019t want to be found. There\u2019s no point in torturing himself with Dan\u2019s ghost. His\u2026 incredibly hot ghost. His fingers press more insistently against his crotch.\u00a0</p><p>Just then, an email from Cornelia pings up in the corner of Phil\u2019s screen. He whips his hand away from his pyjama trousers, feeling very weird about doing any such thing whilst his sister-in-law-to-be is contacting him. To distract himself from the urgent pulses of arousal coming from beneath the covers, he clicks the email.<br></p><p><b>From: Mona Kemp<br>To: Cornelia Dahlgren<br><br></b></p><p><b>Fwd: Phil Lester</b></p><p><i>Dear Ms Dahlgren,</i></p><p><i>On my first attempt to send over the recordings, it appears the hotel\u2019s rather dated computer system failed to include this final, rather short one. I\u2019ve attached it in this email. Once I\u2019ve confirmed you have received it, I shall dispose of the recordings altogether. </i></p><p><i>Please send Mr Lester my sincerest apologies again for the atrocious breach of privacy. I no longer have his contact information, but he is welcome to get in touch with me for a formal apology, and we would be more than happy to compensate him with a free stay whenever he might choose to return. </i></p><p><i>Sincerely,</i></p><p><i>Mona Kemp<br>Hotel Manager of The Secret of the Alps</i></p><p>Upon reading the line \u2018free stay whenever he might choose to return\u2019, Phil lets out a loud snort. Poor Mona. He\u2019ll never tell her, but he\u2019d have to be dragged back onto that cable car kicking and screaming. Even then, he\u2019d probably beg Kaspar to hurl him out of it before they reached the summit. He\u2019ll see how he feels about another trip up there in a few years, perhaps with time his stint there won\u2019t feel as traumatising.\u00a0</p><p>He clicks the attached recording, readying himself for yet another auditory reminder of his sordid, expletive-riddled, excruciatingly hot fling with Dan. There\u2019s a crackle as it begins playing, and Phil turns up the volume, straining to hear anything more than a few vague rustles. This doesn\u2019t sound like the other recordings. Perhaps the device had just picked up Phil talking in his sleep or something.</p><p>And then, he hears Dan\u2019s voice.\u00a0<i>\u201cPhil?\u201d</i> It\u2019s quiet, but clear as a bell.\u00a0<i>\u201cPhil.\u201d</i></p><p> Phil sucks in a breath. It\u2019s not that three months have wiped the memory of Dan\u2019s voice from his mind, but when he hears it echo through his eardrums, it\u2019s usually the words he spat in that last argument, when he\u2019d announced he was leaving, as if Phil wouldn\u2019t give a damn. He hasn\u2019t thought of Dan\u2019s softer, sweeter voice in some time. He\u2019d forgotten how Dan could sound, at times, without the strain of lust or fury warping his vocal chords.\u00a0</p><p>Then there comes a muffled \u2018thump\u2019, followed by a grunt of pain. </p><p><i>\u201cWha?\u201d</i> Phil\u2019s voice says. </p><p>Phil clicks pause and checks the timestamp for the recording. It reads 02:01am on 14th April. That\u2019s the day Dan left. Early in the morning. How come he can\u2019t remember this? </p><p>His heart thuds, coming to the gradual realisation that he\u2019s listening to a conversation he\u2019s never heard before. One he never even knew had taken place. Had Dan come to say goodbye to him after all? Has Phil been living under the impression that Dan had snubbed him, ran off without a word, when really\u2026</p><p>Phil sits up straighter, turning the volume up to the highest level. He clicks play again.\u00a0</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cDid you watch the stream of your fave giving his rousing speech at the UN?\u201d Roshina asks as she settles herself into the seat beside Dan\u2019s again. </p><p>Silently, Dan begs her to sit literally anywhere else, but her mind is apparently closed to telepathy. He wonders if she\u2019d believe he\u2019s suddenly been struck totally deaf. Unlikely, but it might be worth a try if it meant he didn\u2019t have to\u00a0talk about Phil again today; he\u2019s only just stopped crying for long enough intervals to make it to class. </p><p>\u201cYeah, uh, think I saw some clips on Twitter,\u201d Dan replies, aiming for the sweet spot between vague and already-up-to-speed.\u00a0</p><p>In truth, he watched it start to finish, at 1am because of the time difference, hunkered over his laptop in bed, tears streaming down his face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGod, wasn\u2019t he marvellous?\u201d she sighs, hauling a load of books and pens she won\u2019t use out of her tote again. <i>Yes, he was.</i> \u201cHe can hold a room for sure. I think it\u2019s \u2018cause you can tell he\u2019s passionate about this. \u201d She grins at him.\u00a0\u201cOr maybe it\u2019s because of his deep, sexy voice. D\u2019you think?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Dan stares back at her, wondering if she genuinely expects him to respond with words.\u00a0\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Luckily, she doesn\u2019t seem too bothered about Dan agreeing. She pulls out her phone and begins cycling through her social media apps with the concentration of an atomic physicist.\u00a0\u201cOh look,\u201d Roshina exclaims just when Dan thought he might get a moment of peace, \u201cour man is trending.\u201d</p><p>Dan digs his fingernails into his palm. <i>Don\u2019t look. Just don\u2019t look.</i> \u201cCan I see?\u201d he asks, hating himself. </p><p>She angles her phone at him. There are two hashtags pertaining to Phil. The first is #AmazingPhil. The second is #PhilsUNSpeech. Roshina clicks the first, and scrolls slowly down a timeline of people enthusing about Phil\u2019s fiery yet intelligent speech which he gave at the United Nations headquarters yesterday afternoon, about the poverty crisis in several African countries. He seems to have really knocked it out of the park, judging by the response he\u2019s getting. Dan drinks the raining compliments down greedily, trying to glean, selfish though it may be, what Phil\u2019s mental state might be right now, in reaction to all the sudden attention directed his way. One particular tweet catches his attention.\u00a0</p><p>@nikolaischmikolai: saw #amazingphil at the airport after the conference! such a cool guy, didnt get a selfie cos he was in a hurry to get his flight but he signed my ticket with a Muse quote! #inspiration</p><p>Back at the airport, Dan notes. Already jet-setting off to his next glamorous public appearance. It won\u2019t take long until people start throwing money at him for all this\u00a0\u2018charity work\u2019. They\u2019ll give him a Netflix documentary series, or a book deal, or any of the other wank that just gets handed to celebrities.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLucky guy, seeing him IRL. I wonder what he\u2019s like in person,\u201d Roshina ponders, scrolling through more tweets.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAn emotionally stunted, obnoxious adrenaline junkie with no filter on the silver spoon stuck in his gob,\u201d Dan mutters, before realising he said that slightly too loud. Roshina is staring at him oddly. He shrugs, pinkening. \u201cI imagine, anyway.\u201d </p><p>Thankfully, before Roshina can respond, Professor Warren calls the class to attention, flicking the PowerPoint to the title page, which reads, \u2018Marital Dissolution: The Litigation of Separation and Divorce\u2019. The irony is stifling. </p><p>*</p><p>Sleep is closing in on Dan from all sides. He\u2019s trying to resist the urge to slip into blissful unconsciousness, but Professor Warren\u2019s baritone voice is making it so difficult to stay alert. His eyelids sag, then shut entirely. It\u2019s just as the waves of promised unconsciousness are beginning to draw him out into that sweet, deep void that the door of the lecture hall opens with its hideous squeak. Dan frowns, inching down further in his uncomfortable chair to try and get away from the noise. </p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d a loud, plummy voice calls, interrupting Professor Warren mid-flow. Dan frowns harder; the voice is instantly grating, as if it knows to burrow straight beneath Dan\u2019s skin. It skims along the shores of his half-dream, splashing through the shallows in the distance, but Dan is too far out to be reached. \u201cIs Dan Howell in this class?\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes snap open. </p><p>\u201cYoung man, I am in the middle of a lecture!\u201d Professor Warren replies in his gruff, incredulous voice, the one he uses in seminars to pick on students who haven\u2019t done the reading. Dan\u2019s been on the receiving end of this voice rather too often. \u201cI must insist that you wait outside until-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Professor, but this can\u2019t wait,\u201d the voice says, even louder. \u201cDan Howell? Dan, are you in here?\u201d </p><p>A slight Northern tinge is detectable beneath the upper-class overtones. Chills course down Dan\u2019s arms. This cannot be happening. He sneaks a glance at Roshina; her mouth is a round, pink circle, eyes bugged out so far it looks almost cartoonish. He looks left and right, noting that several people are also turning his way, alight with excitable intrigue. It\u2019s no use. He\u2019s going to have to confront this\u2026 situation. Dan sits up just enough that he can peer through the shoulders of the people in front of him, to the short flight of stairs that lead up to the lecture hall door. </p><p>It\u2019s beyond surreal, to take in the sight of Phil, here, in this dingy light-less hall, looking exactly the same as ever, but somehow startlingly different. He feels as though the image of him has smacked sharply into the back of his head. In the next moment, Dan realises that Roshina has literally smacked him. </p><p>\u201cYou <i>know</i> him?!\u201d she hisses, incensed. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you <i>say</i>?\u201d</p><p>Phil lets out a suffering sigh that makes Dan\u2019s teeth grit together. He\u2019s gazing out across the rows of students as if he were surveying his Kingdom. Dan hunches over, trying to hide. There must be a hundred people in here, thank heavens.\u00a0Suddenly, Roshina has her green-taloned claw on his upper arm; she hauls him up with surprising strength, though he does his best to struggle free.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil calls out a second time to the general room, ignoring the fact that Professor Warren looks to be on the verge of spontaneous combustion, \u201cI kind of <i>know</i> you\u2019re in here. Could you just\u2026 I need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Dan swallows, feeling the back of his neck prickle from how many eyes are on him now. Phil isn\u2019t wearing his glasses; perhaps he\u2019s blinder than Dan assumed he was, as Roshina now has him in a vice grip, ensuring he stays bolt upright in the chair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just dawned on me who you are, young man,\u201d Professor Warren says then, cold, \u201cand I\u2019m sure in your world this kind of disruptive behaviour is tolerated. But this is an academic setting, not a press interview. Please leave my lecture. You may speak with whomever you like in an hour.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDan, I know you\u2019re in love with me,\u201d Phil says, with a sweet, butter-wouldn\u2019t-melt smile. \u201cI think we should talk about that, maybe.\u201d </p><p>Cheeks furiously flaming, Dan looks down at his folding desk covered in meagre study tools for some kind of murder weapon. The best he has is a laptop charger, which he might be able to fashion into some kind of lasso and choke Phil from afar if he really tried. Stifled snickers erupt behind people\u2019s hands, and practically everyone is staring at him now. With little other option, Dan shoots to his feet, stuffing everything in his bag. He doesn\u2019t give Phil the satisfaction of meeting his eye, but as he\u2019s finally shut his gob, Dan reckons the dickhead has spotted him at last. </p><p>Bag slung over one shoulder, Dan forces his way past Roshina\u2019s fishnet-wrapped knees, then past a few other amused students to the aisle. He stalks down the stairs as quickly as possible, head down. He can sense Professor Warren\u2019s disapproving glare on him; this little stunt will not earn him any favours, and he\u2019s already on the Prof\u2019s list of ne\u2019er-do-wells. Once he begins the climb of stairs towards the hall doors, Dan finally lifts his head to aim his icy expression at the infuriating human that has inexplicably decided to saunter in and humiliate Dan like no time at all has passed. The corner of Phil\u2019s mouth is lifted just a tad. Dan had honestly forgotten, what with all the heartache, just how punchable he is. </p><p>He says nothing, just grabs Phil by the upper arm and marches him up the remainder of stairs, then through the doors. Once they\u2019re outside the lecture hall, which opens directly onto the main outdoor campus, Dan lets go of Phil like he\u2019s burning, and strides across the tarmac, feeling the burn of mortification stinging him from all sides. Of course it\u2019s raining, Dan thinks as he walks, the scent of rain-soaked concrete misting the air.</p><p>It\u2019s not long before he hears footsteps hurrying after him. \u201cDan, wait!\u201d </p><p>Furious, Dan stops in his tracks and whirls around. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d </p><p>Phil comes to an abrupt halt in front of him, eyes round. He blinks at Dan, mouth parted; for a moment, Dan is equally dumbstruck. Seeing him so close, after months of only glimpsing him through a screen, is disconcerting. Was he always this stunning? Did Dan really somehow grow used to the vivid, swirling blue of his eyes?\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 could ask you the same question,\u201d Phil says after a while.\u00a0<br></p><p>The annoying non-answer immediately slaps Dan back from gooey-ville. He gives Phil a withering look. \u201cI\u2019m a student here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought you dropped out.\u201d</p><p>Dan grits his teeth again. How is it that Phil always knows to pick at the very knots Dan doesn\u2019t want to unravel?\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, I dropped in again.\u201d\u00a0He folds his arms across his chest. To his utter dismay, a smattering of the students milling around the campus plaza have begun to look up from their phones and tablets. There\u2019s a lot of pointing and murmuring going on, presumably because \u2018Amazing Phil\u2019 has appeared out of the blue to fight with some normie. \u201cWhy\u2019d you have to announce to the entire hall that I\u2019m \u2018in love\u2019 with you?\u201d Dan demands, pointedly using air quotes to convey the ridiculousness of that concept. \u201cI have to finish out the year with the people in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, you <i>don\u2019t</i> have to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start with the whole \u2018you gave up on giving up\u2019 thing. I know, okay? I\u2019m back exactly where I was before we met, hating every aspect of my life. But we can\u2019t all be famous charitable heartthrobs.\u201d</p><p>Phil smirks, his lowered eyelashes catching tiny droplets of rain. \u201cHeartthrob?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Dan says, one hand coming to his damp forehead, \u201cwhat do you <i>want</i>?\u201d</p><p>An actual crowd of people is forming around them, seemingly oblivious to the fact they\u2019re all steadily getting soaked. Dan wants rather badly to bolt far away from this spot. But that would mean leaving Phil behind, again, and annoyed though he is, he just can\u2019t wrench himself away a second time, not when he\u2019s only just reappeared. Phil shifts, pulling his smart jacket tighter, eyeing the people gathering around them. Several of them have unsubtly pulled out their phones to film this exchange.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI had this dream,\u201d Phil says, inexplicably.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, Martin Luther King,\u201d Dan says dryly,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure your doting fans would love to hear all about it, so just look into one of these nice people\u2019s lenses and remember to speak clearly-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had this dream that you crawled into bed with me,\u201d Phil interrupts, continuing as if Dan hadn\u2019t spoken. An eruption of titters spills from their group of onlookers; Dan has to close his eyes and breathe to stop himself from stepping forwards and kicking Phil in the kneecap. \u201cIn the middle of the night. And you asked me to give you a reason to stay with me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Immediately, the backs of Dan\u2019s eyes strain and ache, pushing tears into his ducts. He wills the rain to fall harder, to disguise his reaction in case he can\u2019t keep the tears from spilling over.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd in my dream,\u201d Phil continues, \u201cI couldn\u2019t think of a reason. I just thought\u2026 you must already know how much I like you. I\u2019d told you so many times that you were constantly on my mind. I\u2019d done stupid, reckless things to be with you for just a few hours. I\u2019d left my husband. But there you were, in my dream, asking me for something more. I couldn\u2019t understand what it was you wanted me to say. I didn\u2019t have anything left. Nothing I could think of that might stop you leaving.\u201d<br></p><p>The rain is soaking through Dan\u2019s t-shirt, sticking it to his skin. He shivers, trying to let the alien words fold into his drizzled, muddy mind.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late for this,\u201d Dan points out, toeing the tarmac with the tip of his trainer, watching the light grey slabs slowly pinpricking with dark circles. \u201cAnd it was just a dream, like you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought of a reason, though.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes lift. He wants to say he doesn\u2019t care, that their brief attempt to grasp at the wisp of some connection that sparked between them was doomed from the start. The chance has passed them by - they\u2019re no longer up a mountain with only each other for company, they\u2019re back in the gritty rainy reality of their starkly different lives.\u00a0</p><p>But he also aches, body and soul, to know that reason. The thing Phil never said, that Dan has imagined him saying every day since. God help him, he yearns to hear it more than he yearns for oxygen in his next breath. So he says nothing, lips pressing tight.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI was really lonely,\u201d Phil says, grimacing as a fat raindrop strikes his pale cheek. \u201cI spent three years in a far off retreat nobody knew about, cut off from everything I\u2019d known. The cold of that place, along with the isolation\u2026 I think it seeped into my bones. I just went numb. I forgot how to feel anything.\u201d </p><p>Dan looks away, casting his gaze around the people on the periphery of this strange conversation, all of them listening intently, so ready for some dramatic story to add to their social media timeline. </p><p>\u201cAnd then you came,\u201d Phil says, apparently oblivious to the entourage. \u201cLike you\u2019d been flung up the mountain by mistake. You had no more clue why you were there than anyone else. And you were so\u2026\u201d he heaves a sigh, running fingers through damp, dark hair. \u201cSo fucking <i>annoying</i>.\u201d</p><p>A ripple of laughter goes up around them; Dan chokes out a cough of indignation. \u201cIsn\u2019t this supposed to be a reason you wanted me to stay?\u201d </p><p>Phil smiles, showing the barest hint of teeth. \u201cYou got on every single one of my nerves. It was like you\u2019d specifically been planted there to piss me off. Everything about you was just\u2026 so frustrating.\u201d </p><p>Dan cocks a suggestive eyebrow, because it\u2019s decidedly his turn to embarrass Phil after the many things he\u2019s inferred about Dan so far. On camera.\u00a0\u201cThere were occasions where Louise had to pull me aside and cool me off so I wouldn\u2019t beat you with your ski pole. So don\u2019t think it was one-sided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s just it,\u201d Phil says, taking a teensy step closer. Dan\u2019s backpack strap is sodden, and his face is misted with moisture, but he can\u2019t seem to make himself move an inch, because Phil - god damn him - looks fucking incredible all wet, in a Mr Darcy-emerging-from-the-lake sort of way. \u201cYou made me feel things again. Sure, most of the feelings were anger and exasperation, but it was still better than the void that was there before.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWow. I don\u2019t know what to say. This is all so romantic,\u201d Dan says scornfully; their audience titters, and Dan feels a small surge of pride that this time they\u2019re laughing with him. \u201cAre you getting to some kind of point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil says, laughing. \u201cI was so alone, and I owe you so much.\u201d</p><p>Dan snorts, turning on his heel. <i>Enough.</i> \u201cThat\u2019s a line from Sherlock, you dick-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m fucking about, I can do better,\u201d Phil pleads, grabbing his arm. Dan thinks about pulling away, but he settles for just turning to glare some more, very aware of Phil\u2019s touch, how his warm, wet fingers feel even through the soggy material of his t-shirt.\u00a0\u201cHow about\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil is really close to him now, his deep thinking cutting a crease between his brows. The rain has deflated his quiff, making it stick to his forehead. Somehow, even with a makeshift emo fringe, he looks infinitely radiant. Dan imagines that in comparison, he resembles a drowned rat, his hair frizzed and unattractive, and it\u2019s all being caught on film, which is fantastic. Phil drops his voice to a murmur, presumably so it can\u2019t be picked up by people\u2019s shitty phone mics.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cArguing with you every day, up in the heavens of fucking nowhere\u2026\u201d Phil shrugs, smiling. \u201cThat was the most fun I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>A droplet spills from Dan\u2019s left eye, and he wipes it away, furious with himself for allowing it to leak out. \u201cWow,\u201d he chokes out. \u201cYou must have been really bored up there.\u201d </p><p>Phil nods, eyes trained on Dan\u2019s traitorous smile. \u201cIs that\u2026 your way of saying you don\u2019t hate my guts?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan feels himself tense. Phil\u2019s hand is still on his arm, and his thumb strokes gently over the damp skin just below his sleeve. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t provide you with, like, champagne or- or um, suites in fancy hotels or\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He trails off, because he\u2019s allowed himself to look into Phil\u2019s eyes properly for the first time; they really are so many separate shades of blue. There must be dozens of colours in their depths. He\u2019d have a job naming them all.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll settle for the occasional kiss between battles,\u201d Phil replies.\u00a0<br></p><p>Dan splutters softly, cheeks warm against the shivering rest of his body. His eyes flit to their audience, several of whom have their hands over their hearts and mouths. </p><p>\u201cNot here,\u201d Dan replies, taking a hasty step backwards. \u201cLet\u2019s, uh,\u201d he glances around for a break in the crowd, \u201clet\u2019s go somewhere\u2026 less here.\u201d </p><p>He turns before Phil can answer, pushing through a throng of camera-faced people, letting Phil find his way to catch up. They get halfway across the campus main square before Phil says coolly, \u201cnot to ruin the theatricality of this moment, but where are we going?\u201d </p><p>Dan looks at him, then stops in his tracks. <i>Crap.</i> \u201cY-you can\u2019t come back to mine.\u201d He blushes, fidgeting. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 living with my parents. At the moment.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Phil says, dithering.\u00a0\u201cNot ideal.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhere are you staying?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil hesitates, and Dan has to prod him in his damp ribs to make him answer aloud. He sighs eventually. \u201cSusan.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s eyebrows shoot towards the rainclouds above them. \u201cYour plane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. S\u2019all I\u2019ve got to my name right now, pretty much.\u201d </p><p>Dan nods, considering this for all of about five seconds. He can already sense that they\u2019re beginning to be followed. Dan grabs Phil by the wrist. \u201cShe\u2019ll do.\u201d </p><p>*</p><p>Considering what a smooth, relaxed pilot Phil is, Dan is genuinely baffled by how terrifying he is as a driver.\u00a0Phil has parked Susan on some farmland about two miles from campus; the owner of the plot had recognised Phil\u2019s plane when he\u2019d landed it in the local airport and practically jumped at the chance to offer him a place to stow it - presumably to earn himself some bragging rights for bestowing his hospitality on a semi-celebrity. </p><p>This suspiciously good samaritan also gave Phil use of his truck for the day, as the farm is in the middle of nowhere, and Phil needed a way to get to Dan\u2019s university campus. The truck is an old, squeaky thing caked in mud; as far as keeping a low profile goes it does a grand job, but it doesn\u2019t reek of safety. For most of the journey, Dan is clutching the ceiling handle, shrieking whenever another car comes the other way as Phil careers them down narrow country lanes at sixty miles per hour. </p><p>Eventually, after Dan has come worryingly close to crapping his pants, they reach the field where Phil\u2019s plane is sat, less shiny than Dan remembers her, but just as intimidating. The rain is easing up, but it\u2019s left the green countryside dripping and muddy; Dan is not particularly looking forward to trekking across the wet grass.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m literally never getting in a car with you again,\u201d Dan states vehemently, legs shaking as he steps out of the truck. </p><p>\u201cWimp,\u201d Phil says dismissively, slamming his door closed. The sound echoes around them, bouncing off the trees that fringe the field. \u201cI\u2019m just a little rusty. There\u2019s less traffic in the sky.\u201d </p><p>As his heart settles back into its normal rhythm, Dan shuts his own door and follows Phil across the grass to the plane. Phil presses a button as they approach and a short set of steps protrude in a neat glide from Susan\u2019s door. </p><p>\u201cMissed you, babe,\u201d Phil says, hopping onto the first step before it\u2019s completely extended. </p><p>Dan blanches, nearly slipping on a patch of wet grass. \u201cUh, what?\u201d</p><p>Phil looks over his shoulder, amusement coating his expression. \u201cI\u2019m talking to Susan.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh. Yeah. I- I know.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughs and ducks inside the plane. Dan looks around at the vast, endless fields that surround them, startlingly green and lush from the burst of rainfall. There\u2019s nothing for miles aside from a tiny farmhouse in the distance; they\u2019re alone together again. It\u2019s a different kind of deserted expanse to the snow-covered mountains, but a familiar sense of isolation hovers in the air.\u00a0</p><p>Susan\u2019s sleek interior has changed since Dan saw it last. For one thing, what little floor space had been at the back of the plane has been largely taken up by a pull-out bed. It\u2019s unmade, the covers rucked and creased, which in the cramped area makes the whole place look messy. Phil shimmies around the bed to a what looks like the counter of a small bar, opening a neat pull-out contraption that reveals a sink. There\u2019s a kettle too, which Phil holds under the faucet.</p><p>\u201cUh, so you live here? Permanently?\u201d </p><p>Phil nods.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Dan mutters, toeing the empty red bull can on the floor near the bed. \u201cQuite the fall from grace. How are you coping without 24-hour maid service?\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u2019not so bad,\u201d Phil says with no apparent hint at insincerity. He kneels on the bed and leans over to grab the red bull can, which he then throws into the bin, rather stylishly. \u201cAt least here I\u2019m not in debt to anyone.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo you own the plane, then?\u201d </p><p>Dan sits gingerly on the bed, mainly because there is nowhere else to sit apart from the two seats in the cockpit, and he can\u2019t even look in that direction without blushing. It seems both long ago and entirely too recent that he was sat there with Phil knelt before him, high above the peaks of the Swiss mountains. He seems to remember, from his last visit, more seating in the back here, but as he studies the bed he\u2019s perched on, he realises that this <i>is</i> the seating, folded out into a small double bed. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil replies, pouring boiling water into mugs. \u201cNikolai let me have this and the ring.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyebrows raise. \u201cYou\u2019d think he could\u2019ve spared a couple of\u2026 million.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t, actually. It would\u2019ve detracted from my trustworthiness, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean about all the charity stuff you\u2019re doing?\u201d </p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Phil affirms, lifting both mugs and carefully sitting on the bed beside Dan. He hands one over, and Dan takes it. He doesn\u2019t particularly feel like tea, but then he is wet and slightly chilly from the rain, so it will probably help chase the cold from his bones. \u201cSo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Dan echoes. </p><p>They lapse into silence, blowing on their scorching drinks. Eventually, Dan abandons his, knowing it will be too hot to drink for some time. He places it carefully on the shelf beside the bed. \u201cI need to ask you something,\u201d Dan says. </p><p>\u201cYes, the theories are right, I am naturally ginger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>Dan shakes his head. \u201cNot\u2026 what I was gonna ask. It\u2019s about that dream you mentioned.\u201d He hesitates, heart squeezing tightly.\u00a0\u201cDid you\u2026 remember anything else about it?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Strangely, Phil shifts away from him. It\u2019s a telling movement, and even though Dan\u2019s not been around him for some time, he\u2019s ninety percent sure that the expression Phil\u2019s features are forming is something like \u2018sheepishness\u2019. He squints at the older man as a gut feeling blooms that he\u2019s going to want to throttle him within the next few minutes.</p><p>Phil swallows tightly, placing his own mug on the floor. \u201cWell. I don\u2019t really need to, um. Remember.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d </p><p>Phil grimaces, seeming wary of Dan\u2019s reaction, then reaches beneath the bed, drawing out a Macbook. \u201cThis is Martyn\u2019s old one,\u201d Phil says when he catches Dan\u2019s raised eyebrow. \u201cNik kept mine.\u201d </p><p>A wave of sympathy washes over Dan from head to toe, swiftly followed by a surge of anger for Nikolai Novokoric. Phil opens the Mac and clicks around a bit, then turns to Dan, clear concern dressing his face. </p><p>\u201cSo, you remember that girl? With the blue hair?\u201d </p><p>*</p><p>Ten minutes later, Dan is sat in gobsmacked silence, his own confession of love reverberating through the air. No use denying it now. \u201cThat little fucker.\u201d </p><p>Phil winces. \u201cYeah.\u00a0Well, anyway, Mona and Cornelia destroyed all the copies.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes bulge. \u201cExcept this one!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell yeah,\u201d Phil says. His mouth twitches, and Dan zeroes in on it. \u201cBut\u2026 I reckon I\u2019m allowed to have one.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sweet.\u201d Phil nudges him with his elbow. \u201cAnd, y\u2019know\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, please enlighten me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 pretty hot.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s frown deepens. \u201cThat\u2019s a strange choice of adjective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe not the part where you bear your soul to me in a largely embarrassing midnight confession,\u201d Phil says, so Dan hits him in the arm, \u201cbut the other recordings-\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Other</i> recordings?!\u201d </p><p>Phil pauses, caught out. \u201cOh. Uh, yeah. From what I can gather the recording device began recording any time it picked up noise, so there are a few\u2026\u201d </p><p>He trails off, and Dan buries his face in his hands for a few seconds, then takes a deep inhale, straightening up. \u201cShow me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot sure this is the best time-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil, that\u2019s a recording of me doing a variety of explicit deeds. Fucking play it to me.\u201d </p><p>Phil hesitates, scanning Dan\u2019s face, then shrugs, pulls up a different recording, moves the play bar to the middle, and hits the space key. </p><p>\u201c<i>Kiss me,</i>\u201d Dan\u2019s voice says, husky and breathless. \u201c<i>Kiss me and then fuck me.</i>\u201d </p><p><i>Regret, regret, regret- </i>Dan lunges for the laptop, slamming the space bar. Unfortunately, he manages to press another key as well, and a different recording pops up. Before either he or Phil can do anything to stop it, Nikolai\u2019s voice is pouring from the speaker.</p><p><i>\u201c\u2026my God, don\u2019t tell me you actually top in this-\u201d</i></p><p>Phil slams the lid of his laptop shut smartly, two pink spots appearing on his high cheeks. \u201cI\u2019ll delete these, I think.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s fingers push into his temple, massaging the spot. \u201cSo good of you to hang onto them until now, you wanker.\u201d</p><p>Silence falls, and for a moment the tension is taut to the point of being unbearable. Then, Dan hears a quiet, barely audible giggle. He looks at Phil, incredulous, and immediately upon seeing the creases of laughter around his glinting eyes, feels a swell of laughter bubbling up in his own chest. The tension snaps, and they let their streams of laughter spill out. Phil cards a hand through his hair, reaching for his tea again. </p><p>\u201cY\u2019know,\u201d Dan says, eyes glazed as he watches Phil\u2019s plump, pink lips seal over the rim of his mug, \u201cyou\u2019ve already lured me into your\u2026\u201d he gestures to the plane interior. \u201cDen. Kind of redundant at this point to play it cool.\u201d</p><p>Phil looks at him quizzically, sipping. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, as you have clear, recorded evidence of my unfortunate attachment to you right there,\u201d Dan says, stretching out on the bed a little more, settling into the familiar atmosphere of mildly absurd, irritation-fuelled hysteria, \u201cand I willingly endured your death-defying driving skills, then followed you into your plane in the middle of nowhere, it might be a reasonable assumption that I\u2019m, like,\u201d Dan waves a hand in the air between them, \u201cD.T.F.\u201d </p><p>Phil chokes around a mouthful of tea. He places the mug down sharply, eyes wide. It makes Dan laugh, and he leans back onto his hands. As it turns out, having every last scrap of his dignity laid out before them both is rather empowering. He has nothing left to hide, no reason to be coy, and it\u2019s now up to Phil whether he takes advantage or not. Dan really hasn\u2019t anything else to lose, at this point, sad though that thought might be.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to <i>assume</i>,\u201d Phil objects, scandalised, \u201cI\u2019m trying to be a gentleman!\u201d</p><p>Dan nods gravely. \u201cBy playing me audio recordings of me asking you to \u2018kiss and fuck me\u2019?\u201d </p><p>Phil\u2019s mouth opens, as if he\u2019s about to retort, but at the sight of Dan\u2019s smirk, he closes it again, a laugh escaping. \u201cIf I do one of those things now, can you pretend I waited until, y\u2019know, a respectable amount of time had passed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could pretend I had a sudden urge to shuck off my wet clothes,\u201d Dan suggests with a hand thrown across his forehead for emphasis; he\u2019s enjoying the unusual sensation of having the power over this situation, and as usual when he feels even a lick of power, his theatric flair rears its head. It doesn\u2019t matter that his heart doubled in speed as soon as Phil hinted at physical contact. \u201cAnd then,\u201d Dan continues, voice as dramatic as if he were addressing a theatre-ful of patrons, \u201cas you\u2019re finding me a spare shirt to cover my immodesty, you can\u2019t help your gaze lingering on my bare skin - you try to stop yourself, but your hand reaches out of its own accord to stroke across my chest - my breath hitches, and-\u201d</p><p>Phil dives across the bed, pinning Dan to the mattress and kissing him. \u201cHmm,\u201d he mumbles into the seam of Dan\u2019s lips, \u201cI forgot you never shut up.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s arms come up to wind around Phil\u2019s neck, a zing of pure joy ricocheting through his body as his familiar weight settles on top of him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten that you\u2019re ten times more tolerable to listen to when you\u2019re naked,\u201d Dan says, turning his head to urge Phil to kiss along his jaw. \u201cPlease comply.\u201d </p><p>Phil chuckles, leaning up to pull his shirt off. \u201cBetter?\u201d </p><p>A punch of air leaves Dan\u2019s chest; his hands spread themselves over Phil\u2019s toned stomach, re-learning the crevices either side of his belly, the smooth curvature of his hips.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMuch.\u201d His index fingers trace the line of hair that leads from Phil\u2019s tummy button beneath the waistband of his trousers. He pulls at the waistband impatiently. \u201cEven better without these though, I reckon.\u201d </p><p>Phil sits back on his haunches, positioning himself on top of Dan\u2019s thighs. \u201cYeah?\u201d he asks, already sliding the zipper down. Dan\u2019s cock pulses, still trapped by his jeans. Phil is putting on a show, but Dan no longer has the ability to call him out on it. His eyes won\u2019t unstick themselves from the sight of Phil shimmying his trousers down his thighs, revealing a pair of black boxer briefs so tight that they might as well be nonexistent for all they manage to conceal. \u201cHow\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>Dan shoots him what he intends to be a\u00a0withering look\u00a0that probably doesn\u2019t come across very menacing. \u201cI don\u2019t remember you being this vocal.\u201d</p><p>Phil smiles, using Dan\u2019s shoulder to steady himself as he peels the trousers off entirely. \u201cShut me up, then.\u201d </p><p>Not needing to be told twice, Dan grabs the backs of Phil\u2019s thighs and manoeuvres him back until he\u2019s sprawled on his back. He pulls off his own t-shirt, getting more impatient by the minute to entwine himself in Phil as deeply as possible; he\u2019s been starving himself of this, for months, and now he wants to feast. As soon as he\u2019s free of his t-shirt, Dan begins pushing his lips against the miles of bare skin covering Phil\u2019s upper body. Phil\u2019s breathing goes strange and stuttery, and his hand loses itself in Dan\u2019s hair. </p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he whispers as Dan seals his mouth over a nipple, \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill talking to Susan?\u201d Dan asks with a snort, and Phil smacks him lightly in the back of the head. </p><p>\u201cSusan doesn\u2019t talk back nearly as much.\u201d</p><p>In response, Dan chooses to trail a line of kisses downwards, through the valley of Phil\u2019s pectoral muscles, over the plane of his stomach, nipping gently at that tantalising rivulet of hair slicing through his pelvic region. When he gets to the boxer briefs, he pauses, lifting his gaze as he tucks his fingertips into the waistband. </p><p>Phil makes a sort of choking noise as their eyes meet, which is pleasant to hear. \u201cLift,\u201d Dan tells him, and when his hips rise, pulls them off in a flourish. Dan had thought the thick, gorgeous shape of Phil\u2019s cock was deeply ingrained into his memory, but even the image he\u2019d conjured up in the dead of night, when he couldn\u2019t stop himself from indulging in nostalgia, had been lacking in the exquisite detail of reality. He takes hold of the base in one hand, letting the warm, pulsing flesh push all thought from his mind. \u201cI missed you too,\u201d he says, and Phil whimpers. </p><p>Dan takes his time blowing Phil, letting him glide in and out of his mouth as he lifts his head and sinks down again and again. Phil\u2019s body slackens, sinking into the hard mattress so totally that it\u2019s as if he hasn\u2019t relaxed once in all the time that\u2019s passed since they last did this. The sensation of Phil atop Dan\u2019s tongue is comforting in its thickness, stretching his lips wide, reminding him of how it feels to be so open. He would like for Phil to know this, wants to share the intoxicating power of utter vulnerability. He pulls off, suddenly alight with an idea, and sits up, crawling over Phil\u2019s spread body until his face hovers above Phil\u2019s.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know what Nikolai mentioned,\u201d Dan begins, testing the waters.\u00a0</p><p>Instantly, Phil\u2019s hands stop wandering over his back. \u201cAre you seriously bringing up my ex-husband right now?\u201d</p><p>Dan chuckles, then sweeps a tongue over his lower lip, tasting Phil there, salty and sour; Phil\u2019s eyes fall to the movement with obvious interest.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just been thinking,\u201d Dan continues, determined to persevere with the thought if it could lead where he hopes it might. To soften the blow of blindsiding Phil with Nikolai\u2019s name, Dan dots a few light kisses over his jaw. \u201cWhen we\u2026 did things before. Were you just indulging me, because I suggested we try it a certain way, and it was my first time?\u201d</p><p>Phil arches his head backwards, wordlessly encouraging Dan to move his lips to his neck. \u201cW-what do you mean? It was always amazing with you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Dan says, sucking gently at the spot right below Phil\u2019s ear. \u201cSo you never wanted to do it a different way? Like\u2026\u201d His hand, which has been resting on Phil\u2019s hip, trickles over his thigh, dipping into the cavern between Phil\u2019s legs. He lets his fingers wander even lower, past the swell of his balls. He watches Phil\u2019s face intently, trying to gauge the reaction, and presses the tip of one finger to the tight, puckered entrance at his rear. \u201cThis way?\u201d </p><p>For the first time, Dan is able to witness the crystal blue of Phil\u2019s irises thinning and nearly disappearing entirely, swallowed up by the black holes widening in their centres. It\u2019s not until Dan removes his finger that Phil is able to summon a response. </p><p>\u201cI- I don\u2019t have much of a preference,\u201d he whispers, stammering. \u201cIs\u2026 is that something you\u2019d want to try, or-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil,\u201d Dan interrupts, feeling the smile teasing the corner of his mouth as he sees through Phil\u2019s poor attempt at nonchalance, \u201cdo you want me to fuck you?\u201d </p><p>Phil is quiet for a moment, but Dan holds his gaze, one eyebrow cocked, hopefully looking far more in control of himself than he feels. The elbow he\u2019s using to hold himself up begins to tremble, threatening to give way, but he holds steady, needing to hear Phil speak the words. </p><p>Then, Phil nods, just once. \u201cYes.\u201d </p><p>Dan smiles, leaning in to seal their mouths together. The eagerness with which Phil responds conveys his excitement, and Dan lets him twine their tongues together, allows Phil\u2019s arms to draw him in around the neck. After a few minutes however, Dan\u2019s self-control is reaching its very peak, what with Phil\u2019s cock trapped between their bodies still, and the anticipation of what it might be like to slip inside of him lurking so tantalisingly on the horizon. </p><p>Dan unwinds himself carefully, sitting up and reaching for the button of his own jeans. \u201cDo you have, um, stuff?\u201d </p><p>His question prompts Phil into immediate action; he sits up, peeling himself off the bed in order to stagger over to an overhead cupboard, which he reaches up to open. Dan\u2019s fingers stumble on the zipper of his jeans, attention ensnared by the sight of the lean, naked body in front of him, stretched out in a delicious long line of pale, pure skin, hiding terrains of thick muscle, tightened by years of diligent workouts. His cock strains against the fly of his trousers, imagining what it might be like to bury himself inside of such a temple; his fingers work frantically to open the zip. Eventually, Phil finds what he\u2019s looking for, and throws a bottle of lube and a four condom packets onto the bed. </p><p>Dan picks a few of the foil packets up, eyebrows raised. \u201cI\u2019m flattered that you presume so highly of my stamina, but-\u201d</p><p>Phil shuts him up using the method he seems to be realising is the most effective - jumping back on the bed and kissing him hard. \u201cThought we could take it in turns,\u201d Phil growls into Dan\u2019s mouth, because obviously he\u2019s intent on driving Dan to the brink of insanity.\u00a0</p><p>A strangled noise escapes Dan\u2019s throat, and he pushes Phil backwards until he\u2019s astride him again, back to pulling off his jeans, which thankfully goes a lot more smoothly this time. He slides his underwear off too, then reaches for the condom packet, ten steps ahead of himself; Phil\u2019s hand on his arm makes him pause. </p><p>\u201cWoah, uh, it\u2019s not my first rodeo but I\u2019m probably gonna need a little prep before-\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Dan mutters, throwing the condom aside for a moment. He shakes his head, blood thrumming in his ears, and smooths his hands up Phil\u2019s gorgeous thighs. \u201cSorry. Okay, what do I do?\u201d </p><p>Phil sits up, reaching for the lube, and un-pops the cap. \u201cWant me to do it?\u201d</p><p>Dan snatches the bottle from him. \u201cFuck right off.\u201d </p><p>He pours some of the gloop onto his fingers, remembering how, when they\u2019d done this before, Phil had warmed the substance before letting it touch his skin. He copies the action, coating his hands with it, then looking to Phil for further instruction. Phil opens his legs wider, allowing Dan to fit himself between them.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever done this to yourself?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOnly since you did it to me,\u201d Dan admits before he can stop himself. </p><p>Phil grins, unsubtly conveying his thoughts around this, and Dan only barely resists the urge to flick him in the balls. \u201cSame thing, then,\u201d Phil says.</p><p>\u201cWill it hurt?\u201d</p><p>Phil eases himself back down onto his elbows. \u201cDoubt it,\u201d Phil answers in a soft sigh. He lets out a little moan as Dan\u2019s fingertips press against him. \u201cFuck. No, I don\u2019t think this is gonna hurt at all.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s fingers slide into Phil as easily as if he were pushing them into warm bread dough. The walls of hot, soft muscle close in around him, drawing each finger deeper as he adds them one at a time. Phil murmurs vaguely bossy commands, telling him to scissor and stretch, but half the words are lost to his groans of bliss, each one making Dan shudder more violently than the last. </p><p>\u201cUgh, Dan,\u201d he says, voice desperate despite it seeming like barely any time has passed. He has one hand wrapped around the back of his right thigh, holding it up to allow Dan better access. Dan moves closer, brushes Phil\u2019s hand away and lets the crook of Phil\u2019s knee drape over his shoulder. \u201cFuck,\u201d Phil mutters, but doesn\u2019t protest. \u201cY-you can stop now,\u201d he urges, but Dan keeps on, wanting to be totally sure. Phil seems so tight, so <i>impossibly</i> tight, and whilst it is maddening to picture thrusting inside of such tightness, the thought of hurting Phil without meaning to is terrible enough to keep Dan stretching with his fingers, just in case. He changes the angle just slightly when his wrist threatens to cramp, and Phil swears, louder than he has so far. \u201cFff-<i>uck</i>. Do that again.\u201d </p><p>Dan does do it again. He does it many more times, pressing the pads of his fingers to that same spot until Phil is writhing against the covers, until his gasps sound more like gurgles, until his hands are scrabbling at Dan\u2019s wrist to pull his fingers free. </p><p>\u201cFuck, Dan please, I\u2019m ready, I\u2019m ready,\u201d he garbles. </p><p>For a long moment, Dan is too hypnotised by the wrecked, flushed mess that\u2019s become of the Adonis-like man sprawled out naked before him to react. He stares at Phil\u2019s reddened, slick lips, puffy from where he\u2019s been biting them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil chokes out, desperate. </p><p>The sound of his name slaps Dan back into coherence. He pats the space around him, searching for the condom packet he\u2019d thrown aside before. It seems to elude him for a while, but eventually he finds it, and rips the packet with his teeth. Thankfully, condoms are a part of sexual experience that he is not out of his depth with, as Beth had insisted on him using at least one, sometimes more, whenever they slept together. </p><p>He rolls it on with ease, thankful for the many opportunities he\u2019s had to practice for this moment, and takes hold of Phil by the hips, dragging him forwards with a sharp tug, until the head of his cock is aligned with Phil\u2019s slick opening. Phil is staring at him in amazement, and Dan doesn\u2019t blame him - he\u2019s exuding a confidence born purely of adrenaline, and it\u2019s making him into someone unrecognisable, someone composed and assertive. Someone hot.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asks; his shaky voice somewhat shatters the illusion. </p><p>\u201cGod, yes,\u201d Phil replies, apparently not noticing.\u00a0</p><p>Dan inches his hips forwards, letting the head of his cock press past the outer rim; Phil\u2019s head tips backwards, a sigh of ecstasy spilling from his throat. His hand releases its grip on the covers, and he brings his long fingers to wrap around his cock. </p><p>Even the sight is intoxicating. Ignoring all other sensation for now, Phil looks maddeningly good this way; Dan\u2019s hips almost lock in place, just watching him <i>feel</i>. The thin branches of Phil\u2019s neck bones are protruding beneath the skin, mottled from where Dan has nipped and bitten. His puffed chest is rising and falling rapidly, his shoulders trembling, misted with a sheen of rainwater and sweat. He ducks his head again, meeting Dan\u2019s eyes, and Dan remembers he\u2019s supposed to be moving, that he is supposed to be the one in control of this. He doesn\u2019t feel very in control, suddenly, too shaken by the onslaught of sensation attacking from all angles. </p><p>As if he\u2019s gleaned these concerns from Dan\u2019s mind through osmosis, Phil says, \u201cwait,\u201d and Dan pauses, terrified he\u2019s done something wrong. Phil sits up, glazed and sluggish, then pushes Dan backwards with a hand against his shoulder. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wr-\u201d </p><p>Dan lands back on his tailbone, and suddenly Phil is astride him, piled in his lap like a huge, gorgeous, naked gift. He angles himself without needing to look, keeping his eyes locked on Dan\u2019s the whole time, and sinks himself back down onto Dan\u2019s cock, lips parted, eyes fluttering. A moan pours out of Dan\u2019s throat as the unexpected bliss crashes over him, as the sensation of slick, hot, closeness grips him by the soul. He is buried inside of Phil\u2019s pure, angelic body, as far as he can get. It\u2019s agony, because Phil has gone still, letting himself adjust to the intrusion. Dan\u2019s head falls against Phil\u2019s chest, trying to keep calm when he wants so badly to shout at Phil to move even slightly, would trade everything he owns for the relief of it. </p><p>And then, miraculously, Phil does. </p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Dan whispers, brokenly, as Phil\u2019s hips begin rolling forwards. </p><p>His fingers dig themselves into Phil\u2019s arms, and he buries his face deeper into Phil\u2019s chest. Phil\u2019s arms wind around his shoulders. He lifts his hips up until Dan almost slips out of him entirely, then spears himself back down with a shudder. </p><p>\u201cGod, <i>Dan</i>,\u201d Phil groans, speeding up the pace. He uses his grip on Dan\u2019s shoulders to keep steady, bouncing up and down in Dan\u2019s lap faster and faster, barely letting Dan gasp even a snatch of air. \u201cDan- Dan, would you touch me?\u201d</p><p>Delirious, Dan mentally berates himself for not having the common sense to do this before now. He reaches clumsily between their bodies, barely holding himself together, and closes a fist around Phil\u2019s cock, which is hot and rigid to the touch. He pumps his hand in time with the thrust of Phil\u2019s hips, and in less than a minute Phil is crying out, biting down on Dan\u2019s neck so hard that Dan wonders if he might bleed. Phil\u2019s come splashes Dan\u2019s chest and stomach, coating his hand, and all Dan can think is how he wishes he could taste it.</p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t last much longer after that, as Phil doesn\u2019t so much as stutter in his rhythm. He manages to push his hips upwards a few times, to make the most of this miraculous moment, locked together with Phil in the most intimate possible way. As the tip of his cock presses once again into that spot that makes Phil weak, Phil jerks and gasps in his arms. That\u2019s the moment that Dan is unable to hold on any longer. He squeezes Phil\u2019s arm, groaning into the crook of his neck as he feels his own release fill the condom, a hundred white-hot stars scorching over his skin in a brilliant, blinding shower. </p><p>For a minute after, they don\u2019t move, draped over one another in various ways, just reorienting themselves as they float back to this dimension. Dan pushes his lips against Phil\u2019s damp skin in a way that doesn\u2019t feel chaste enough to be kisses. Eventually, Phil leans backwards, slowly lifting himself off Dan\u2019s lap, letting him slip out. With a shaky, fumbling hand, Dan pulls off the condom, putting it carefully on the floor because he\u2019s too spent to dispose of it properly just yet. </p><p>In the next moment, he feels damp fingers around his wrist, and then Dan is being pulled, until he\u2019s flat on his back, Phil\u2019s arm stretched out beneath his neck. They both stare at the ceiling, listening to the sound of their own gradually slowing breaths. </p><p>Dan rolls onto his side towards Phil, trailing fingers up his ribs, then into the cavern of his underarm, twisting the snatch of hair there between his fingers. He\u2019s sweaty, and it\u2019s still confusing to Dan that it doesn\u2019t gross him out; instead, the musky, heavy scent of Phil\u2019s perspiration is intoxicating, makes him want to bury his face in Phil\u2019s shoulder and lick the moisture from his skin. So he does. </p><p>Phil turns to peer at him, amusedly. \u201cPerv.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan smiles, not caring that it seems peculiar, because he knows Phil doesn\u2019t really care.\u00a0\u201cWas it okay?\u201d Dan asks, as if he isn\u2019t fully aware of how beyond incredible the last half hour had been for both of them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAmazing,\u201d Phil replies, rolling onto his side to kiss him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m as good as you at\u2026 that.\u201d </p><p>Phil\u2019s mouth twitches, and he leans back to stare into Dan\u2019s eyes. His pupils are returning to a more even size, though they\u2019re still taking up most of the space in Phil\u2019s irises. The ring of azure around them glimmers brightly. </p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t sell yourself short, mate,\u201d Phil says. \u201cI had a <i>very</i> good time.\u201d</p><p>Dan snorts, mostly at Phil\u2019s use of the word \u2018mate\u2019. \u201cSo you prefer it, then? Being like\u2026 the one who\u2026 um.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBottoms?\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s only response is a mortifyingly quick blush. </p><p>Phil laughs, prodding Dan\u2019s red cheek with his finger-tip. \u201cI mean it. I don\u2019t have a strong preference for either way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just Nikolai seemed so, like, surprised when he found out-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil says, already grimacing, \u201cI\u2019m only gonna address this once with you, because I don\u2019t particularly want you thinking about this in detail, but having sex with Nikolai is a very different experience to having sex with you. And not in a good way. Could you ever imagine him being as considerate of my preferences as you\u2019re being right now?\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s nose wrinkles. \u201cYou have a point. So\u2026 you\u2019re good with either? Top or bottom?\u201d </p><p>The flame in Dan\u2019s cheeks is fanned even saying the words. \u201cHmm,\u201d Phil says, then leans in to kiss Dan again, harder this time, knocking him backwards until he\u2019s on his back again. \u201cThink I might need a reminder of what it\u2019s like to top again. Y\u2019know, just so I have all the evidence before I make up my mind.\u201d </p><p>\u201cJesus, you\u2019re more of a horn-dog than I remember,\u201d Dan laughs, though he\u2019s already winding a leg around Phil\u2019s to pull him closer. </p><p>*</p><p>They\u2019ve been holed up in Phil\u2019s tiny living space, at the back of a stationary plane, mostly naked, for almost twelve hours. They\u2019d napped for a while, but now they\u2019re awake, watching an episode of Parks and Recreation because Phil has never seen it and Dan simply cannot allow anyone he associates with to not get his references to the show. </p><p>Somewhere in the middle of one of Leslie\u2019s rousing speeches, Phil\u2019s phone beeps. It\u2019s not the first beep they\u2019ve both pretended not to hear, and it\u2019s perhaps for this reason that now Phil sighs and reaches for it, his other arm around Dan\u2019s shoulders, fingers tickling idly across his upper arm. He frowns at the many messages filling the screen, scrolling through a few, then placing the phone upside down on the bedside shelf again. The amusing dialogue of the show loses its potency; Dan waits, breath held, for the inevitable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna have to get back to work soon,\u201d Phil says, just as Dan predicted. \u201cI kind of\u2026 ran off on Martyn and Cornelia and PJ after the UN thing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI figured,\u201d Dan says, already resigned. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It was, um. Good to see you, and stuff. Weird without all the snow and altitude. But good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d Phil says. From the way he has the offer so readily at hand, Dan knows he\u2019s been holding it back for a while. He pretends he hasn\u2019t heard, instead focusing on the screen, where Leslie has just fallen into a giant pit. <i>Relatable</i>. Phil nudges him beneath the blanket with one foot. \u201cDan, did you hear me?\u201d </p><p>Dan sighs, struggling out of Phil\u2019s embrace. They should have talked about this sooner. Now they\u2019re going to fight, and one of them\u2019s going to hurt the other, and then they\u2019ll split apart again for an indeterminably long bout of miserable, awful separation. </p><p>\u201cI heard you.\u201d </p><p>Dan runs a hand through his still-damp hair. They\u2019d had showers a while ago in Phil\u2019s tiny closet-shower. Though it would have been extremely nice to have stood beneath the spray together, there was no possible way they could both fit, so they took it in turns. Dan had gone first, and when he\u2019d emerged, Phil had made more tea, and produced a packet of biscuits. He\u2019d given Dan a robe - stolen from The Secret of the Alps, he noticed - for him to dry off and set him up with the laptop to watch Parks and Rec until he\u2019d cleaned himself of the evidence of their debauchery too. It had been wholesome and unusually soft behaviour; entirely too easy to fall into, and forget that their circumstances didn\u2019t allow for such kind, sweet interludes without a price. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even want to be a lawyer,\u201d Phil says, like it\u2019s as simple as that. \u201cJust think it over a bit more-\u201d </p><p>\u201cI did that,\u201d Dan snaps, then checks himself, breathing deeply. If he can avoid getting upset and defensive, that would be ideal. \u201cI already did the freaking out and running off to re-evaluate my choices. It didn\u2019t work. You were there, you <i>know</i> it didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>Phil shuts the laptop, cutting off the peppy American voices of the Parks and Rec cast. \u201cWhat exactly didn\u2019t work, though? What did you expect to happen up there?\u201d </p><p>Dan laughs humourlessly, gesturing between them. \u201cNot this.\u201d He winces. It came out meaner than he intended it to. \u201cI mean, obviously I\u2019m glad I met you and we dragged each other into a destructive pattern of secretly bonking behind closed doors\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cHeartfelt,\u201d Phil replies; even though it\u2019s sarcasm, Dan can tell without looking over at him that he\u2019s smiling. </p><p>\u201c..but, even you have to admit it probably wasn\u2019t the smartest decision on my part. Or yours, come to that.\u201d Dan picks at the thin, messy bedclothes, frowning. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m very good at the self-reflective stuff. S\u2019just better if I crack on, stop fantasising that there\u2019s some dream career waiting in the wings somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving a job that makes you happy isn\u2019t a crazy fantasy, Dan,\u201d Phil says. He makes everything sound so easy. Dan kind of misses that about him, dangerous and seductive though it is. \u201cYou could come with me. We could work it out together.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCome with you where?\u201d Dan asks, turning to him incredulously. \u201cNo offence, mate, but you\u2019ve got no more clue than I have right now. You have no money or plans, you said it yourself. It\u2019s very admirable, all the charity stuff, but what\u2019re you gonna do when the public grow bored of you without all the divorce drama? How are you gonna fund your humanitarian schemes?\u201d</p><p>Phil shrugs, a composed, slightly amused smile gracing his features. He looks entirely unbothered by these questions, and Dan is suddenly so envious of his ability to shrug off anxiety that it makes a spurt of anger shoot through his chest. He rolls his eyes, throwing the covers off his legs. He\u2019s about to get up, to find his clothes and put an end to this brief day-cation from reality, when Phil\u2019s hand on his arm, gentle and cautious, gives him pause. </p><p>He waits, the warmth of Phil\u2019s fingers draining the frustration from his bones, easing the tension in his body. Phil shuffles closer, hands sliding to rest on Dan\u2019s shoulders, then rubbing gently, thumbs digging into the knots of taut muscle. It\u2019s so glorious that Dan sinks back into him, immediately slackening, his mind abruptly washed of every concern that had just been plaguing it. </p><p>\u201cHas anyone ever told you that you think too much?\u201d Phil murmurs into his ear. </p><p>\u201cI get the feeling you\u2019re about to,\u201d Dan retorts, then feels a satisfied sigh slip out as Phil digs his clever fingers in deeper. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to Africa,\u201d he says in a low, soothing voice that Dan knows is probably one he\u2019s been trained to use in stressful situations, but works so well that he can\u2019t be bothered to protest. \u201cThere\u2019s a cluster of villages in Kenya that need a lot of help. Installing water filtration systems, building schools, that sort of thing. That\u2019s where I\u2019m going next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right.\u201d Dan\u2019s shoulders tense up again. <i>Africa. Could he be jetting off further?</i> \u201cHow long f-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should come with me,\u201d Phil says for the third time. His hands become still on Dan\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m serious. We could use you out there.\u201d</p><p>Dan rolls his eyes, though Phil is behind him and can\u2019t see. \u201cAs convincing as that is, we both know I have the muscles of a cooked noodle, so I doubt I\u2019d be much use to you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not always about physical labour,\u201d Phil interrupts, like he\u2019s prepared this argument months in advance. He\u2019s too good at debating, that\u2019s the trouble. Dan\u2019s never stood a chance trying to last in the ring with him. \u201cYou\u2019ve got other hugely beneficial skills, I\u2019ve seen it myself. You can fix pretty much anything you put your mind to. That\u2019s kind of extraordinary.\u201d</p><p>Dan blinks, not sure how to react to the unexpected praise. \u201cWell\u2026 I don\u2019t know about \u2018anything I put my mind to\u2019-\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven so, you\u2019d probably have a hell of a lot more clue than I would,\u201d Phil points out, and Dan has to admit, although he\u2019s never witnessed Phil attempt to repair or even patch up anything beyond his own fragile ego, he doubts very much that he\u2019d be particularly skilled at it. He tries to imagine Phil with a spanner in his hand, tightening the joins in the municipal pipe under the blaring, scorching African sun. He has to hide his bubble of absurd laughter. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of the heat,\u201d Dan protests, weakly.\u00a0</p><p>Whilst this is true, and he\u2019d deliberately chosen the destination of his last runaway attempt to be the opposite of somewhere hot, Dan can feel his soul yearning for the adventure. For being with Phil, daily, their perpetual bickering exacerbated by the blazing sun, and then soothed by the cool night air, locked away in some dark room they\u2019d built together, free to kiss each other\u2019s sun-blistered skin all night long. His fingers itch for the fantasy, and he clenches them into fists, knowing he shouldn\u2019t dare to so much as want it.</p><p>Phil places a kiss to his shoulder, then leans away. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d Phil says, making Dan\u2019s heart sink. \u201cI mean, when you\u2019re so passionate about law, a little sunshine seems laughable doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Dan rolls his eyes, but a laugh escapes anyway, so he turns to whack Phil in the arm. Phil lets him, then catches him by the wrists, holding Dan\u2019s gaze. \u201cI think you could be happy. I think we could make each other happy.\u201d </p><p>One of Dan\u2019s eyebrows arches. \u201cI think we\u2019d drive each other bonkers.\u201d </p><p>Phil smiles. \u201cSame thing, I reckon.\u201d </p><p>Dan shakes his head, knowing in every cell of his being that this is completely mental, to abandon his life again for a man who infuriates him daily. But he also knows, perhaps even more strongly, that he\u2019s as in love with Phil as he is exasperated with him. \u201cIf I leave again\u2026 I won\u2019t be able to come back.\u201d</p><p>Phil squeezes his hands around Dan\u2019s. \u201cNo,\u201d he agrees. \u201cMe neither.\u201d</p><p>Dan chews his lip, though his resistance has more or less melted away. \u201cAre you only offering to take me with you because you feel sorry for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil says, teasingly.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m rescuing you from a life of paperwork and office parties.\u201d A smile breaks across his gorgeous face, making his eyes soften, crinkle at the sides. His voice drops into its rare tone of sincerity. \u201cDan, I\u2019m asking you if you\u2019d come with me. Because I watched you attempt to ski away from me up a hill and fall straight down it, and somehow managed to fall tragically, pathetically in love with you in the same instant. I want you to come. Because don\u2019t really fancy trying to stay away from you anymore.\u201d </p><p>*</p><p>Dan\u2019s not sure how it happens really. One minute, he\u2019s in a lecture hall with the most annoying girl on the planet talking his ear off about succulents and her hot personal tutor, and the next he\u2019s in the front seat of a fully-fuelled plane, beside a stunningly handsome philanthropist-slash-ski-enthusiast-slash-pilot, headed for a continent halfway around the world. He hasn\u2019t told his parents where they\u2019re going yet. Phil hasn\u2019t told the public, or Pj or Cornelia or Martyn. It\u2019s all a bit\u00a0\u2018up in the air\u2019. They\u2019ll tell anyone who needs to know when they land again, when the intense rays of sun are soaking into their pale skin, flooding their veins with Vitamin D. </p><p>Dan reaches across the chasm between his and Phil\u2019s seats, letting his hand dangle invitingly until Phil notices and takes it, rolling his eyes and telling Dan he\u2019s a \u201cright sap\u201d. But he threads their fingers together anyway, angling the yoke towards the sky, and Dan leans back in his chair as the clouds zoom closer, welcoming the oncoming oblivion. A wild thought swims at him from nowhere, as if it fell straight out of the Heavens:\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019d be just fine if they never had to come down.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>The End.</b></p><p><br></p><p><b>(Yes, there will be an epilogue.

Since his scandalous divorce from Sir Nikolai Novokoric of Switzerland, Lester has become a dedicated philanthropist, using his notoriety which arose during the controversial coverage of the split to spread awareness about domestic abuse, LGBTQ+ discrimination, homelessness, poverty, and many other important global issues. This Tuesday, Lester is expected to appear at the United Nations conference to discuss Third World Poverty&hellip;&rsquo;</i></p><p>The folding seat beside Dan&rsquo;s is wrenched down, and a young woman with badly-dyed pink hair plops into it, holding a Starbucks cup and an Urban Outfitters tote bag stuffed with books and papers. Dan lowers the lid of his laptop to shift some of his stuff out of the way of her feet. </p><p>&ldquo;Is it just me or does it get more rammed in here every week?&rdquo; the girl says. Dan stares at her in mild dismay; usually he projects such a cold, unfriendly aura that nobody dares sit within two seats of him. He&rsquo;s seen this girl in a few classes before, but he can only barely remember her name. It&rsquo;s something like Ramona, or Rowena&hellip; Or maybe it&rsquo;s neither. She turns to Dan, brandishing a strong, confident smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Roshina.&rdquo; <i>Ah. Neither.</i> &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Dan, right? The guy who dropped out and then&hellip; dropped in again.&rdquo; </p><p>She tips her head back and cackles for a second, then begins pulling various things out of the tote bag. Dan grimaces, staring at the little cacti prints decorating the bag. What is it with hipster girls and succulents?&nbsp;</p><p>Whilst he&rsquo;s not thrilled that he&rsquo;s apparently earned a reputation amongst the student body as the notorious failed quitter, he hasn&rsquo;t the energy to challenge her on it.</p><p>&ldquo;Guess so,&rdquo; he replies in a mutter.&nbsp;</p><p>He opens his laptop again, hoping it might signal to her that he&rsquo;s busy, and not up for a conversation. Of course, every line of the article is like having someone plunge a fresh, thin needle into his chest, slowly stitching the word&nbsp;&lsquo;fool&rsquo; into his skin. But his need for information about Phil is as urgent as his need for water. He can&rsquo;t look away.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ooh, I love that guy,&rdquo; Roshina says, leaning in towards Dan to read the article as well. She leans her elbow on the back of his seat, the coffee in her hand hovering close to Dan&rsquo;s nose; it&rsquo;s something chai-spiced. Dan recoils as subtly as he can, pressing himself into the opposite edge of the chair.&nbsp;</p><p>The article includes a photo of Phil behind a podium, his glasses on, wearing an impassioned expression, mouth open halfway through some dramatic statement or other.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;If I were as famous as him and I&rsquo;d just, like, lost my hot rich husband,&rdquo; Roshina says, loudly, right into Dan&rsquo;s ear,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have no shame. I&rsquo;d be applying to Big Brother or Love Island. Just shows there are some blokes willing to do the decent thing after all!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Dan cannot imagine why Roshina thinks he&rsquo;d care what she might hypothetically get up to in her fantasy version of Phil&rsquo;s life. He imagines Phil sneering at this girl&rsquo;s audacity, saying something snippy and derisive like: <i>&lsquo;And if I were as vapid as you, I&rsquo;d perhaps rethink my decision to pursue a career in the legal field, as it&rsquo;s highly unlikely anyone&rsquo;s going to hire a solicitor with bubblegum pink hair</i><i>.&rsquo; </i>It makes Dan smile, just a bit, and then in the next second, he&rsquo;s back to being a bitter old maid.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t give him too much credit,&rdquo; Dan grumbles, eyes stuck to the photo of Phil, spewing some boring line about domestic abuse like he didn&rsquo;t need to be practically dragged to his own divorce settlement by the cuff of his ear.&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s probably getting a buttload for all these appearances.&rdquo;</p><p>She snorts at him, rather loudly and obnoxiously considering this is, as far as Dan remembers, their first conversation. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you read Perez Hilton? He keeps zilch. All profits from his public appearances go to the charity he&rsquo;s promoting at the time.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan throat suddenly feels very dry. <i>All profits? What&rsquo;s he living on? </i>He scrolls down the page a bit more; Roshina jabs at his screen suddenly with a short, green fingernail. She&rsquo;s pointing to another article advertised at the side of this one, with the headline: <i>&lsquo;Give and Thou Shalt Receive: Phil Lester spotted with Possible New Man&rsquo;.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Click that one!&rdquo; Roshina squeals excitedly. &ldquo;It was just posted!&rdquo;</p><p>Dan is about to tell Roshina in a clipped, irritable tone that he would rather pick up her fluffy pen and drive it into his eye, but she&rsquo;s already batting his hand away, apparently oblivious to social etiquette. He&rsquo;s trapped in his seat, forced to watch as she clicks the baiting link. A photo pops up at once, taken through an open car door, of Phil crammed into the back seat with Martyn and a &lsquo;mystery&rsquo; person. Except it&rsquo;s not a mystery-person. Not to Dan, and not to the author of this article, who has, to their credit, obviously done their homework.&nbsp;</p><p>Dan shifts uncomfortably as Roshina laps up the photo, eyes round and gleaming. He feels nauseous, and the smell wafting from her latte is not helping. Not that anything helps the sickness that sits at the bottom of his belly perpetually nowadays. Ever since he re-enrolled, courtesy of his doting and quietly ecstatic parents, Dan has been off food, off socialising, off anything much except sitting in his room scrolling through the endless media cycle of Phil-related articles.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Says here this dude used to be Nikolai&rsquo;s&nbsp;photographer!&rdquo; Roshina exclaims. Dan says nothing. He doesn&rsquo;t want to entertain speculative notions that just because PJ, who used to work for Nikolai, has been papped in Phil&rsquo;s proximity, that it means they&rsquo;re dating. Even the idea of it has Dan gripping the hard plastic of his armrest to staunch his wave of paranoia.&nbsp;&ldquo;PJ Ligouri is a UK-based photographer that jumped ship from Nikolai&rsquo;s press team alongside his former PA Cornelia Dahlgren. The latter is currently dating Martyn Lester, Phil&rsquo;s older brother. Suspicions of PJ&rsquo;s involvement with the younger Lester were first aroused when he was noticed photographing Phil&rsquo;s appearance at last month&rsquo;s Climate Change Festival-&rdquo;</p><p>Dan slams the lid of the laptop closed so suddenly that Roshina squeaks, yanking her fingers away just in time.&nbsp;&ldquo;Battery&rsquo;s low,&rdquo; he mutters, folding his arms across his chest. He sinks down in his seat, intending to stay that way until the lecture starts, letting the white noise of Roshina&rsquo;s indignant voice keep his intrusive and unpleasant thoughts of Phil and PJ, and all the things they might be doing, at bay.&nbsp;</p><p>*<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Martyn says, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Corn for you. She wants a private word.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil frowns, not looking up. &ldquo;Tell her I&rsquo;m the wrong brother to call for that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She says it&rsquo;s pretty serious,&rdquo; Martyn says, ignoring him.&nbsp;</p><p>Phil lets out a frustrated sigh, letting the open file he&rsquo;s been reading fall to the couch cushion beside him. The Red Cross have sent him a buttload of information that he needs to know inside out before his address at the United Nations conference later today. He&rsquo;s been back and forth with the Red Cross for weeks through phone calls and emails trying to get up to speed, but there&rsquo;s so much to know in such a short space of time. He has to look like he&rsquo;s dedicated to this project, and he is, but the UN invited him last minute - he hasn&rsquo;t had a lot of time to prepare.&nbsp;</p><p>He&rsquo;ll have even less time if Cornelia keeps pestering him about schedules and meetings or whatever this is about. Of course, despite her constant bothering, Phil would lick the soles of her comfortable-but-cool sneakers to keep her around. She&rsquo;s a scarily good Press Agent, Phil has no idea how Martyn ever took her on back when they were rivals. They work much better as a team, sharing the role for Phil on a voluntary basis, whilst working a few other part-time jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Something about a girl with blue hair?&rdquo; Martyn prompts, and Phil&rsquo;s heart skips.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hand it over.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Say please to your big brother,&rdquo; PJ scolds from the other end of the couch, though he doesn&rsquo;t look away from his phone screen, which he&rsquo;s been Skyping his girlfriend on for the past half hour. He angles the phone at Phil, pulling his headphones out of the jack; Sophie&rsquo;s round, sweet face fills the screen.&nbsp;&ldquo;Soph, tell him to use his manners. You&rsquo;re a lady.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Use manners,&rdquo; Sophie says, then pulls up her nostrils to look like a snout.&nbsp;&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m no lady.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Phil smiles at her, but his heart is pounding too violently to give her a proper response. He holds his hand out for the phone in Martyn&rsquo;s hand instead. PJ plugs his headphones back in, voice lowering.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Corn,&rdquo; Phil says as soon as the phone is against his ear. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Cornelia says, then clears her throat. She&rsquo;s not diving straight in to whatever she has to say, so Phil immediately knows this is a sensitive topic. He stands from the uncomfortable sofa he&rsquo;s sat on, moving over to the window, as far away from Martyn and PJ as he can get in this tiny room. &ldquo;So, Mona Kemp just contacted me. You remember her? From The Secret of the Alps hotel.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil rolls his eyes. &ldquo;Yes, I remember the manager of my prison cell, funnily enough.&rdquo; </p><p>She clears her throat again. &ldquo;Right. Yeah. Well, apparently they&rsquo;ve just rented out your suite for the first time since you left.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil waits, but Cornelia seems to need prompting. &ldquo;Uh huh&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And the new guests, um, found something.&rdquo; </p><p>The tiny workers controlling Phil&rsquo;s brain are suddenly thrown into uproar, frantically combing through his memory for any inkling of what incriminating item he might have left in that godforsaken place. His jaw clenches so hard he can feel a twitch, but he stoically stares through the glass pane to hide his panic from the other people in the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was like a&hellip; recording device?&rdquo; Cornelia says, and Phil wishes he could see her in the flesh, read her expression to know how bad it is.&nbsp;</p><p>Although they&rsquo;re both technically in the same building, the United Nations Headquarters are impossibly huge. She&rsquo;s downstairs somewhere amongst the thousands of behind-the-scenes worker bees, making arrangements with press and security for the conference. It&rsquo;ll be hours before she finds her way back up to this bare, lifeless green room they&rsquo;ve been given use of.&nbsp;</p><p>His eyes flutter closed, picturing Dan, stood defiantly at the foot of a four-poster bed in his wrongly-buttoned shirt, his soft cheeks pink from exertion, spewing garbled information about a thieving girl with blue hair, and how she&rsquo;d recorded him arguing on the phone.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Mona seemed to know who&rsquo;d put it there somehow, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Cornelia continues in a harried voice. &ldquo;She said it was the daughter of some family that won a holiday up there. Anyway, obviously this device is a serious breach of privacy, and I&rsquo;m sure that if you wanted to press charges-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s on it?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo; </p><p>Phil pinches the bridge of his nose between his forefinger and thumb, conscious of saying too much in case he alerts Martyn, who is already at maximum stress level, and probably listening right behind him. The seams of Phil&rsquo;s head are bursting, still crammed with straggles of information about water filtration systems and monthly overseas school supplies. He can&rsquo;t take this in right now, can&rsquo;t be bothered to give an annoying fangirl brat with an inflated ego the time of day. And on top of that, he cannot listen to Cornelia pretend she hasn&rsquo;t already listened to that recording, whatever it is, from start to finish.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s on it, Cornelia? Don&rsquo;t play dumb.&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s a pause; Phil looks over his shoulder and catches Martyn&rsquo;s eye. He immediately tries to busy himself with meaningless tasks, neatening files and shoving PJ&rsquo;s lighting equipment into the corner of the room. Phil turns back to the window, shaking his head. Martyn is just as much of a dirty snoop as his fianc&eacute; is. They&rsquo;re made for each other. </p><p>At last, Cornelia speaks. She sounds like she&rsquo;s moved somewhere with less people in the background. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a few. They&rsquo;re&hellip; mostly x-rated.&rdquo; </p><p>A deep, dizzying flush sweeps down Phil&rsquo;s body, and he feels his mind threatening to fold inwards on itself. Thanks to a herd of mediation and personal response trainers that Nikolai had him spend weeks with years prior, Phil is able to keep himself relatively calm. He breathes in through his nose, out through his mouth, and stays quiet for a minute whilst he thinks of something to say that will help the situation. </p><p>&ldquo;Send the recordings to me,&rdquo; Phil instructs after a moment. He keeps expecting a sudden surge of anger to well up inside of him - at the blue-haired girl, at Nikolai, at Dan, at himself even - but all that floods through him is a deep, swirling melancholy, dappled with peaks of intense regret. &ldquo;And for the love of God don&rsquo;t show anyone else. Especially my brother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, boss.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And tell Mona thank you for&hellip; being discreet.&rdquo;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t need to check that Mona had quickly and quietly taken the recording device down with a crisp, dismissive explanation to the new guests. He also doesn&rsquo;t need to check that she hadn&rsquo;t listened to them herself; Mona is an honest, rule-abiding woman, and would never dream of such a thing. He should send her a fruit basket one day. &hellip;When he can afford fruit baskets again.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; Cornelia assures him. &ldquo;What do you want to do about the girl?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What girl?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The blue-haired girl. She could have really messed things up-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do anything,&rdquo; Phil says sternly. &ldquo;She wants attention. Notoriety. Don&rsquo;t give her any.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Got it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just send me those recordings. Then get rid of any copies you or anyone else has, for God&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo; He hesitates. &ldquo;Perv.&rdquo; </p><p>She giggles.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sounds to me like you&rsquo;re the perv, mate. Not sure I&rsquo;d have let someone blindfold me on the first shag, he must&rsquo;ve been really into you-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck off, Corn,&rdquo; Phil says tiredly, no venom in his voice, then hangs up.&nbsp;</p><p>He goes back to his case files with a weight in his chest. They&rsquo;re suddenly a lot harder to take in.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>*</p><p>The bed Phil currently calls his own is far less luxurious than the one he used to sprawl out in when he was a resident of The Secret of the Alps hotel. It&rsquo;s barely even a bed, really, as it pulls out from a couch, but Phil never bothers folding it away, as he&rsquo;s only ever in here to sleep. Sleep is what he should be doing right now, in fact, but there&rsquo;s no way he could drift off right now, not after hearing what he&rsquo;s just heard. </p><p>Phil stares at the battered play button on the audio player window that&rsquo;s open on his laptop, which balances on his knee. If he clicks it again, it will be the fifth time he&rsquo;s heard the final recording Cornelia sent over, which is far too many times to be reasonable. She certainly hadn&rsquo;t been wrong in her description of the audio. X-rated is possibly even a little demure.&nbsp;</p><p>He worries his lower lip between his teeth, hand long ago having reached beneath the covers to ease some of the intense pressure between his legs. He shouldn&rsquo;t click play again. The other person in this recording is long gone, and his quick exit was more than enough of a message that he doesn&rsquo;t want to be found. There&rsquo;s no point in torturing himself with Dan&rsquo;s ghost. His&hellip; incredibly hot ghost. His fingers press more insistently against his crotch.&nbsp;</p><p>Just then, an email from Cornelia pings up in the corner of Phil&rsquo;s screen. He whips his hand away from his pyjama trousers, feeling very weird about doing any such thing whilst his sister-in-law-to-be is contacting him. To distract himself from the urgent pulses of arousal coming from beneath the covers, he clicks the email.<br /></p><p><b>From: Mona Kemp<br />To: Cornelia Dahlgren<br /><br /></b></p><p><b>Fwd: Phil Lester</b></p><p><i>Dear Ms Dahlgren,</i></p><p><i>On my first attempt to send over the recordings, it appears the hotel&rsquo;s rather dated computer system failed to include this final, rather short one. I&rsquo;ve attached it in this email. Once I&rsquo;ve confirmed you have received it, I shall dispose of the recordings altogether. </i></p><p><i>Please send Mr Lester my sincerest apologies again for the atrocious breach of privacy. I no longer have his contact information, but he is welcome to get in touch with me for a formal apology, and we would be more than happy to compensate him with a free stay whenever he might choose to return. </i></p><p><i>Sincerely,</i></p><p><i>Mona Kemp<br />Hotel Manager of The Secret of the Alps</i></p><p>Upon reading the line &lsquo;free stay whenever he might choose to return&rsquo;, Phil lets out a loud snort. Poor Mona. He&rsquo;ll never tell her, but he&rsquo;d have to be dragged back onto that cable car kicking and screaming. Even then, he&rsquo;d probably beg Kaspar to hurl him out of it before they reached the summit. He&rsquo;ll see how he feels about another trip up there in a few years, perhaps with time his stint there won&rsquo;t feel as traumatising.&nbsp;</p><p>He clicks the attached recording, readying himself for yet another auditory reminder of his sordid, expletive-riddled, excruciatingly hot fling with Dan. There&rsquo;s a crackle as it begins playing, and Phil turns up the volume, straining to hear anything more than a few vague rustles. This doesn&rsquo;t sound like the other recordings. Perhaps the device had just picked up Phil talking in his sleep or something.</p><p>And then, he hears Dan&rsquo;s voice.&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;Phil?&rdquo;</i> It&rsquo;s quiet, but clear as a bell.&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;Phil.&rdquo;</i></p><p> Phil sucks in a breath. It&rsquo;s not that three months have wiped the memory of Dan&rsquo;s voice from his mind, but when he hears it echo through his eardrums, it&rsquo;s usually the words he spat in that last argument, when he&rsquo;d announced he was leaving, as if Phil wouldn&rsquo;t give a damn. He hasn&rsquo;t thought of Dan&rsquo;s softer, sweeter voice in some time. He&rsquo;d forgotten how Dan could sound, at times, without the strain of lust or fury warping his vocal chords.&nbsp;</p><p>Then there comes a muffled &lsquo;thump&rsquo;, followed by a grunt of pain. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Wha?&rdquo;</i> Phil&rsquo;s voice says. </p><p>Phil clicks pause and checks the timestamp for the recording. It reads 02:01am on 14th April. That&rsquo;s the day Dan left. Early in the morning. How come he can&rsquo;t remember this? </p><p>His heart thuds, coming to the gradual realisation that he&rsquo;s listening to a conversation he&rsquo;s never heard before. One he never even knew had taken place. Had Dan come to say goodbye to him after all? Has Phil been living under the impression that Dan had snubbed him, ran off without a word, when really&hellip;</p><p>Phil sits up straighter, turning the volume up to the highest level. He clicks play again.&nbsp;</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;Did you watch the stream of your fave giving his rousing speech at the UN?&rdquo; Roshina asks as she settles herself into the seat beside Dan&rsquo;s again. </p><p>Silently, Dan begs her to sit literally anywhere else, but her mind is apparently closed to telepathy. He wonders if she&rsquo;d believe he&rsquo;s suddenly been struck totally deaf. Unlikely, but it might be worth a try if it meant he didn&rsquo;t have to&nbsp;talk about Phil again today; he&rsquo;s only just stopped crying for long enough intervals to make it to class. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, uh, think I saw some clips on Twitter,&rdquo; Dan replies, aiming for the sweet spot between vague and already-up-to-speed.&nbsp;</p><p>In truth, he watched it start to finish, at 1am because of the time difference, hunkered over his laptop in bed, tears streaming down his face.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;God, wasn&rsquo;t he marvellous?&rdquo; she sighs, hauling a load of books and pens she won&rsquo;t use out of her tote again. <i>Yes, he was.</i> &ldquo;He can hold a room for sure. I think it&rsquo;s &lsquo;cause you can tell he&rsquo;s passionate about this. &rdquo; She grins at him.&nbsp;&ldquo;Or maybe it&rsquo;s because of his deep, sexy voice. D&rsquo;you think?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Dan stares back at her, wondering if she genuinely expects him to respond with words.&nbsp;&ldquo;Uh&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Luckily, she doesn&rsquo;t seem too bothered about Dan agreeing. She pulls out her phone and begins cycling through her social media apps with the concentration of an atomic physicist.&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh look,&rdquo; Roshina exclaims just when Dan thought he might get a moment of peace, &ldquo;our man is trending.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan digs his fingernails into his palm. <i>Don&rsquo;t look. Just don&rsquo;t look.</i> &ldquo;Can I see?&rdquo; he asks, hating himself. </p><p>She angles her phone at him. There are two hashtags pertaining to Phil. The first is #AmazingPhil. The second is #PhilsUNSpeech. Roshina clicks the first, and scrolls slowly down a timeline of people enthusing about Phil&rsquo;s fiery yet intelligent speech which he gave at the United Nations headquarters yesterday afternoon, about the poverty crisis in several African countries. He seems to have really knocked it out of the park, judging by the response he&rsquo;s getting. Dan drinks the raining compliments down greedily, trying to glean, selfish though it may be, what Phil&rsquo;s mental state might be right now, in reaction to all the sudden attention directed his way. One particular tweet catches his attention.&nbsp;</p><p>@nikolaischmikolai: saw #amazingphil at the airport after the conference! such a cool guy, didnt get a selfie cos he was in a hurry to get his flight but he signed my ticket with a Muse quote! #inspiration</p><p>Back at the airport, Dan notes. Already jet-setting off to his next glamorous public appearance. It won&rsquo;t take long until people start throwing money at him for all this&nbsp;&lsquo;charity work&rsquo;. They&rsquo;ll give him a Netflix documentary series, or a book deal, or any of the other wank that just gets handed to celebrities.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Lucky guy, seeing him IRL. I wonder what he&rsquo;s like in person,&rdquo; Roshina ponders, scrolling through more tweets.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;An emotionally stunted, obnoxious adrenaline junkie with no filter on the silver spoon stuck in his gob,&rdquo; Dan mutters, before realising he said that slightly too loud. Roshina is staring at him oddly. He shrugs, pinkening. &ldquo;I imagine, anyway.&rdquo; </p><p>Thankfully, before Roshina can respond, Professor Warren calls the class to attention, flicking the PowerPoint to the title page, which reads, &lsquo;Marital Dissolution: The Litigation of Separation and Divorce&rsquo;. The irony is stifling. </p><p>*</p><p>Sleep is closing in on Dan from all sides. He&rsquo;s trying to resist the urge to slip into blissful unconsciousness, but Professor Warren&rsquo;s baritone voice is making it so difficult to stay alert. His eyelids sag, then shut entirely. It&rsquo;s just as the waves of promised unconsciousness are beginning to draw him out into that sweet, deep void that the door of the lecture hall opens with its hideous squeak. Dan frowns, inching down further in his uncomfortable chair to try and get away from the noise. </p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; a loud, plummy voice calls, interrupting Professor Warren mid-flow. Dan frowns harder; the voice is instantly grating, as if it knows to burrow straight beneath Dan&rsquo;s skin. It skims along the shores of his half-dream, splashing through the shallows in the distance, but Dan is too far out to be reached. &ldquo;Is Dan Howell in this class?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s eyes snap open. </p><p>&ldquo;Young man, I am in the middle of a lecture!&rdquo; Professor Warren replies in his gruff, incredulous voice, the one he uses in seminars to pick on students who haven&rsquo;t done the reading. Dan&rsquo;s been on the receiving end of this voice rather too often. &ldquo;I must insist that you wait outside until-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Professor, but this can&rsquo;t wait,&rdquo; the voice says, even louder. &ldquo;Dan Howell? Dan, are you in here?&rdquo; </p><p>A slight Northern tinge is detectable beneath the upper-class overtones. Chills course down Dan&rsquo;s arms. This cannot be happening. He sneaks a glance at Roshina; her mouth is a round, pink circle, eyes bugged out so far it looks almost cartoonish. He looks left and right, noting that several people are also turning his way, alight with excitable intrigue. It&rsquo;s no use. He&rsquo;s going to have to confront this&hellip; situation. Dan sits up just enough that he can peer through the shoulders of the people in front of him, to the short flight of stairs that lead up to the lecture hall door. </p><p>It&rsquo;s beyond surreal, to take in the sight of Phil, here, in this dingy light-less hall, looking exactly the same as ever, but somehow startlingly different. He feels as though the image of him has smacked sharply into the back of his head. In the next moment, Dan realises that Roshina has literally smacked him. </p><p>&ldquo;You <i>know</i> him?!&rdquo; she hisses, incensed. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you <i>say</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil lets out a suffering sigh that makes Dan&rsquo;s teeth grit together. He&rsquo;s gazing out across the rows of students as if he were surveying his Kingdom. Dan hunches over, trying to hide. There must be a hundred people in here, thank heavens.&nbsp;Suddenly, Roshina has her green-taloned claw on his upper arm; she hauls him up with surprising strength, though he does his best to struggle free.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Dan,&rdquo; Phil calls out a second time to the general room, ignoring the fact that Professor Warren looks to be on the verge of spontaneous combustion, &ldquo;I kind of <i>know</i> you&rsquo;re in here. Could you just&hellip; I need to talk to you.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan swallows, feeling the back of his neck prickle from how many eyes are on him now. Phil isn&rsquo;t wearing his glasses; perhaps he&rsquo;s blinder than Dan assumed he was, as Roshina now has him in a vice grip, ensuring he stays bolt upright in the chair.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just dawned on me who you are, young man,&rdquo; Professor Warren says then, cold, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m sure in your world this kind of disruptive behaviour is tolerated. But this is an academic setting, not a press interview. Please leave my lecture. You may speak with whomever you like in an hour.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Dan, I know you&rsquo;re in love with me,&rdquo; Phil says, with a sweet, butter-wouldn&rsquo;t-melt smile. &ldquo;I think we should talk about that, maybe.&rdquo; </p><p>Cheeks furiously flaming, Dan looks down at his folding desk covered in meagre study tools for some kind of murder weapon. The best he has is a laptop charger, which he might be able to fashion into some kind of lasso and choke Phil from afar if he really tried. Stifled snickers erupt behind people&rsquo;s hands, and practically everyone is staring at him now. With little other option, Dan shoots to his feet, stuffing everything in his bag. He doesn&rsquo;t give Phil the satisfaction of meeting his eye, but as he&rsquo;s finally shut his gob, Dan reckons the dickhead has spotted him at last. </p><p>Bag slung over one shoulder, Dan forces his way past Roshina&rsquo;s fishnet-wrapped knees, then past a few other amused students to the aisle. He stalks down the stairs as quickly as possible, head down. He can sense Professor Warren&rsquo;s disapproving glare on him; this little stunt will not earn him any favours, and he&rsquo;s already on the Prof&rsquo;s list of ne&rsquo;er-do-wells. Once he begins the climb of stairs towards the hall doors, Dan finally lifts his head to aim his icy expression at the infuriating human that has inexplicably decided to saunter in and humiliate Dan like no time at all has passed. The corner of Phil&rsquo;s mouth is lifted just a tad. Dan had honestly forgotten, what with all the heartache, just how punchable he is. </p><p>He says nothing, just grabs Phil by the upper arm and marches him up the remainder of stairs, then through the doors. Once they&rsquo;re outside the lecture hall, which opens directly onto the main outdoor campus, Dan lets go of Phil like he&rsquo;s burning, and strides across the tarmac, feeling the burn of mortification stinging him from all sides. Of course it&rsquo;s raining, Dan thinks as he walks, the scent of rain-soaked concrete misting the air.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not long before he hears footsteps hurrying after him. &ldquo;Dan, wait!&rdquo; </p><p>Furious, Dan stops in his tracks and whirls around. &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; </p><p>Phil comes to an abrupt halt in front of him, eyes round. He blinks at Dan, mouth parted; for a moment, Dan is equally dumbstruck. Seeing him so close, after months of only glimpsing him through a screen, is disconcerting. Was he always this stunning? Did Dan really somehow grow used to the vivid, swirling blue of his eyes?&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip; could ask you the same question,&rdquo; Phil says after a while.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>The annoying non-answer immediately slaps Dan back from gooey-ville. He gives Phil a withering look. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a student here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thought you dropped out.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan grits his teeth again. How is it that Phil always knows to pick at the very knots Dan doesn&rsquo;t want to unravel?&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I dropped in again.&rdquo;&nbsp;He folds his arms across his chest. To his utter dismay, a smattering of the students milling around the campus plaza have begun to look up from their phones and tablets. There&rsquo;s a lot of pointing and murmuring going on, presumably because &lsquo;Amazing Phil&rsquo; has appeared out of the blue to fight with some normie. &ldquo;Why&rsquo;d you have to announce to the entire hall that I&rsquo;m &lsquo;in love&rsquo; with you?&rdquo; Dan demands, pointedly using air quotes to convey the ridiculousness of that concept. &ldquo;I have to finish out the year with the people in there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Actually, you <i>don&rsquo;t</i> have to do that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t start.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t start with the whole &lsquo;you gave up on giving up&rsquo; thing. I know, okay? I&rsquo;m back exactly where I was before we met, hating every aspect of my life. But we can&rsquo;t all be famous charitable heartthrobs.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil smirks, his lowered eyelashes catching tiny droplets of rain. &ldquo;Heartthrob?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my God,&rdquo; Dan says, one hand coming to his damp forehead, &ldquo;what do you <i>want</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>An actual crowd of people is forming around them, seemingly oblivious to the fact they&rsquo;re all steadily getting soaked. Dan wants rather badly to bolt far away from this spot. But that would mean leaving Phil behind, again, and annoyed though he is, he just can&rsquo;t wrench himself away a second time, not when he&rsquo;s only just reappeared. Phil shifts, pulling his smart jacket tighter, eyeing the people gathering around them. Several of them have unsubtly pulled out their phones to film this exchange.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I had this dream,&rdquo; Phil says, inexplicably.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great, Martin Luther King,&rdquo; Dan says dryly,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure your doting fans would love to hear all about it, so just look into one of these nice people&rsquo;s lenses and remember to speak clearly-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I had this dream that you crawled into bed with me,&rdquo; Phil interrupts, continuing as if Dan hadn&rsquo;t spoken. An eruption of titters spills from their group of onlookers; Dan has to close his eyes and breathe to stop himself from stepping forwards and kicking Phil in the kneecap. &ldquo;In the middle of the night. And you asked me to give you a reason to stay with me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Immediately, the backs of Dan&rsquo;s eyes strain and ache, pushing tears into his ducts. He wills the rain to fall harder, to disguise his reaction in case he can&rsquo;t keep the tears from spilling over.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;And in my dream,&rdquo; Phil continues, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t think of a reason. I just thought&hellip; you must already know how much I like you. I&rsquo;d told you so many times that you were constantly on my mind. I&rsquo;d done stupid, reckless things to be with you for just a few hours. I&rsquo;d left my husband. But there you were, in my dream, asking me for something more. I couldn&rsquo;t understand what it was you wanted me to say. I didn&rsquo;t have anything left. Nothing I could think of that might stop you leaving.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>The rain is soaking through Dan&rsquo;s t-shirt, sticking it to his skin. He shivers, trying to let the alien words fold into his drizzled, muddy mind.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late for this,&rdquo; Dan points out, toeing the tarmac with the tip of his trainer, watching the light grey slabs slowly pinpricking with dark circles. &ldquo;And it was just a dream, like you said.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of a reason, though.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s eyes lift. He wants to say he doesn&rsquo;t care, that their brief attempt to grasp at the wisp of some connection that sparked between them was doomed from the start. The chance has passed them by - they&rsquo;re no longer up a mountain with only each other for company, they&rsquo;re back in the gritty rainy reality of their starkly different lives.&nbsp;</p><p>But he also aches, body and soul, to know that reason. The thing Phil never said, that Dan has imagined him saying every day since. God help him, he yearns to hear it more than he yearns for oxygen in his next breath. So he says nothing, lips pressing tight.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I was really lonely,&rdquo; Phil says, grimacing as a fat raindrop strikes his pale cheek. &ldquo;I spent three years in a far off retreat nobody knew about, cut off from everything I&rsquo;d known. The cold of that place, along with the isolation&hellip; I think it seeped into my bones. I just went numb. I forgot how to feel anything.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan looks away, casting his gaze around the people on the periphery of this strange conversation, all of them listening intently, so ready for some dramatic story to add to their social media timeline. </p><p>&ldquo;And then you came,&rdquo; Phil says, apparently oblivious to the entourage. &ldquo;Like you&rsquo;d been flung up the mountain by mistake. You had no more clue why you were there than anyone else. And you were so&hellip;&rdquo; he heaves a sigh, running fingers through damp, dark hair. &ldquo;So fucking <i>annoying</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>A ripple of laughter goes up around them; Dan chokes out a cough of indignation. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this supposed to be a reason you wanted me to stay?&rdquo; </p><p>Phil smiles, showing the barest hint of teeth. &ldquo;You got on every single one of my nerves. It was like you&rsquo;d specifically been planted there to piss me off. Everything about you was just&hellip; so frustrating.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan cocks a suggestive eyebrow, because it&rsquo;s decidedly his turn to embarrass Phil after the many things he&rsquo;s inferred about Dan so far. On camera.&nbsp;&ldquo;There were occasions where Louise had to pull me aside and cool me off so I wouldn&rsquo;t beat you with your ski pole. So don&rsquo;t think it was one-sided.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; Phil says, taking a teensy step closer. Dan&rsquo;s backpack strap is sodden, and his face is misted with moisture, but he can&rsquo;t seem to make himself move an inch, because Phil - god damn him - looks fucking incredible all wet, in a Mr Darcy-emerging-from-the-lake sort of way. &ldquo;You made me feel things again. Sure, most of the feelings were anger and exasperation, but it was still better than the void that was there before.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Wow. I don&rsquo;t know what to say. This is all so romantic,&rdquo; Dan says scornfully; their audience titters, and Dan feels a small surge of pride that this time they&rsquo;re laughing with him. &ldquo;Are you getting to some kind of point?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Phil says, laughing. &ldquo;I was so alone, and I owe you so much.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan snorts, turning on his heel. <i>Enough.</i> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a line from Sherlock, you dick-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m fucking about, I can do better,&rdquo; Phil pleads, grabbing his arm. Dan thinks about pulling away, but he settles for just turning to glare some more, very aware of Phil&rsquo;s touch, how his warm, wet fingers feel even through the soggy material of his t-shirt.&nbsp;&ldquo;How about&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Phil is really close to him now, his deep thinking cutting a crease between his brows. The rain has deflated his quiff, making it stick to his forehead. Somehow, even with a makeshift emo fringe, he looks infinitely radiant. Dan imagines that in comparison, he resembles a drowned rat, his hair frizzed and unattractive, and it&rsquo;s all being caught on film, which is fantastic. Phil drops his voice to a murmur, presumably so it can&rsquo;t be picked up by people&rsquo;s shitty phone mics.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Arguing with you every day, up in the heavens of fucking nowhere&hellip;&rdquo; Phil shrugs, smiling. &ldquo;That was the most fun I&rsquo;ve ever had.&rdquo;</p><p>A droplet spills from Dan&rsquo;s left eye, and he wipes it away, furious with himself for allowing it to leak out. &ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; he chokes out. &ldquo;You must have been really bored up there.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil nods, eyes trained on Dan&rsquo;s traitorous smile. &ldquo;Is that&hellip; your way of saying you don&rsquo;t hate my guts?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Dan feels himself tense. Phil&rsquo;s hand is still on his arm, and his thumb strokes gently over the damp skin just below his sleeve. &ldquo;You know I can&rsquo;t provide you with, like, champagne or- or um, suites in fancy hotels or&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>He trails off, because he&rsquo;s allowed himself to look into Phil&rsquo;s eyes properly for the first time; they really are so many separate shades of blue. There must be dozens of colours in their depths. He&rsquo;d have a job naming them all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll settle for the occasional kiss between battles,&rdquo; Phil replies.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Dan splutters softly, cheeks warm against the shivering rest of his body. His eyes flit to their audience, several of whom have their hands over their hearts and mouths. </p><p>&ldquo;Not here,&rdquo; Dan replies, taking a hasty step backwards. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s, uh,&rdquo; he glances around for a break in the crowd, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go somewhere&hellip; less here.&rdquo; </p><p>He turns before Phil can answer, pushing through a throng of camera-faced people, letting Phil find his way to catch up. They get halfway across the campus main square before Phil says coolly, &ldquo;not to ruin the theatricality of this moment, but where are we going?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan looks at him, then stops in his tracks. <i>Crap.</i> &ldquo;Y-you can&rsquo;t come back to mine.&rdquo; He blushes, fidgeting. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip; living with my parents. At the moment.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hmm,&rdquo; Phil says, dithering.&nbsp;&ldquo;Not ideal.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you staying?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Phil hesitates, and Dan has to prod him in his damp ribs to make him answer aloud. He sighs eventually. &ldquo;Susan.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s eyebrows shoot towards the rainclouds above them. &ldquo;Your plane?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. S&rsquo;all I&rsquo;ve got to my name right now, pretty much.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan nods, considering this for all of about five seconds. He can already sense that they&rsquo;re beginning to be followed. Dan grabs Phil by the wrist. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo; </p><p>*</p><p>Considering what a smooth, relaxed pilot Phil is, Dan is genuinely baffled by how terrifying he is as a driver.&nbsp;Phil has parked Susan on some farmland about two miles from campus; the owner of the plot had recognised Phil&rsquo;s plane when he&rsquo;d landed it in the local airport and practically jumped at the chance to offer him a place to stow it - presumably to earn himself some bragging rights for bestowing his hospitality on a semi-celebrity. </p><p>This suspiciously good samaritan also gave Phil use of his truck for the day, as the farm is in the middle of nowhere, and Phil needed a way to get to Dan&rsquo;s university campus. The truck is an old, squeaky thing caked in mud; as far as keeping a low profile goes it does a grand job, but it doesn&rsquo;t reek of safety. For most of the journey, Dan is clutching the ceiling handle, shrieking whenever another car comes the other way as Phil careers them down narrow country lanes at sixty miles per hour. </p><p>Eventually, after Dan has come worryingly close to crapping his pants, they reach the field where Phil&rsquo;s plane is sat, less shiny than Dan remembers her, but just as intimidating. The rain is easing up, but it&rsquo;s left the green countryside dripping and muddy; Dan is not particularly looking forward to trekking across the wet grass.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m literally never getting in a car with you again,&rdquo; Dan states vehemently, legs shaking as he steps out of the truck. </p><p>&ldquo;Wimp,&rdquo; Phil says dismissively, slamming his door closed. The sound echoes around them, bouncing off the trees that fringe the field. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just a little rusty. There&rsquo;s less traffic in the sky.&rdquo; </p><p>As his heart settles back into its normal rhythm, Dan shuts his own door and follows Phil across the grass to the plane. Phil presses a button as they approach and a short set of steps protrude in a neat glide from Susan&rsquo;s door. </p><p>&ldquo;Missed you, babe,&rdquo; Phil says, hopping onto the first step before it&rsquo;s completely extended. </p><p>Dan blanches, nearly slipping on a patch of wet grass. &ldquo;Uh, what?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil looks over his shoulder, amusement coating his expression. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking to Susan.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh. Yeah. I- I know.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil laughs and ducks inside the plane. Dan looks around at the vast, endless fields that surround them, startlingly green and lush from the burst of rainfall. There&rsquo;s nothing for miles aside from a tiny farmhouse in the distance; they&rsquo;re alone together again. It&rsquo;s a different kind of deserted expanse to the snow-covered mountains, but a familiar sense of isolation hovers in the air.&nbsp;</p><p>Susan&rsquo;s sleek interior has changed since Dan saw it last. For one thing, what little floor space had been at the back of the plane has been largely taken up by a pull-out bed. It&rsquo;s unmade, the covers rucked and creased, which in the cramped area makes the whole place look messy. Phil shimmies around the bed to a what looks like the counter of a small bar, opening a neat pull-out contraption that reveals a sink. There&rsquo;s a kettle too, which Phil holds under the faucet.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, so you live here? Permanently?&rdquo; </p><p>Phil nods.</p><p>&ldquo;Jesus,&rdquo; Dan mutters, toeing the empty red bull can on the floor near the bed. &ldquo;Quite the fall from grace. How are you coping without 24-hour maid service?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;not so bad,&rdquo; Phil says with no apparent hint at insincerity. He kneels on the bed and leans over to grab the red bull can, which he then throws into the bin, rather stylishly. &ldquo;At least here I&rsquo;m not in debt to anyone.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;So you own the plane, then?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan sits gingerly on the bed, mainly because there is nowhere else to sit apart from the two seats in the cockpit, and he can&rsquo;t even look in that direction without blushing. It seems both long ago and entirely too recent that he was sat there with Phil knelt before him, high above the peaks of the Swiss mountains. He seems to remember, from his last visit, more seating in the back here, but as he studies the bed he&rsquo;s perched on, he realises that this <i>is</i> the seating, folded out into a small double bed. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Phil replies, pouring boiling water into mugs. &ldquo;Nikolai let me have this and the ring.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s eyebrows raise. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d think he could&rsquo;ve spared a couple of&hellip; million.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad he didn&rsquo;t, actually. It would&rsquo;ve detracted from my trustworthiness, I think.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You mean about all the charity stuff you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Phil affirms, lifting both mugs and carefully sitting on the bed beside Dan. He hands one over, and Dan takes it. He doesn&rsquo;t particularly feel like tea, but then he is wet and slightly chilly from the rain, so it will probably help chase the cold from his bones. &ldquo;So.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Dan echoes. </p><p>They lapse into silence, blowing on their scorching drinks. Eventually, Dan abandons his, knowing it will be too hot to drink for some time. He places it carefully on the shelf beside the bed. &ldquo;I need to ask you something,&rdquo; Dan says. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, the theories are right, I am naturally ginger.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan shakes his head. &ldquo;Not&hellip; what I was gonna ask. It&rsquo;s about that dream you mentioned.&rdquo; He hesitates, heart squeezing tightly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Did you&hellip; remember anything else about it?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Strangely, Phil shifts away from him. It&rsquo;s a telling movement, and even though Dan&rsquo;s not been around him for some time, he&rsquo;s ninety percent sure that the expression Phil&rsquo;s features are forming is something like &lsquo;sheepishness&rsquo;. He squints at the older man as a gut feeling blooms that he&rsquo;s going to want to throttle him within the next few minutes.</p><p>Phil swallows tightly, placing his own mug on the floor. &ldquo;Well. I don&rsquo;t really need to, um. Remember.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you mean?&rdquo; </p><p>Phil grimaces, seeming wary of Dan&rsquo;s reaction, then reaches beneath the bed, drawing out a Macbook. &ldquo;This is Martyn&rsquo;s old one,&rdquo; Phil says when he catches Dan&rsquo;s raised eyebrow. &ldquo;Nik kept mine.&rdquo; </p><p>A wave of sympathy washes over Dan from head to toe, swiftly followed by a surge of anger for Nikolai Novokoric. Phil opens the Mac and clicks around a bit, then turns to Dan, clear concern dressing his face. </p><p>&ldquo;So, you remember that girl? With the blue hair?&rdquo; </p><p>*</p><p>Ten minutes later, Dan is sat in gobsmacked silence, his own confession of love reverberating through the air. No use denying it now. &ldquo;That little fucker.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil winces. &ldquo;Yeah.&nbsp;Well, anyway, Mona and Cornelia destroyed all the copies.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s eyes bulge. &ldquo;Except this one!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well yeah,&rdquo; Phil says. His mouth twitches, and Dan zeroes in on it. &ldquo;But&hellip; I reckon I&rsquo;m allowed to have one.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, do you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sweet.&rdquo; Phil nudges him with his elbow. &ldquo;And, y&rsquo;know&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No, please enlighten me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; pretty hot.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s frown deepens. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a strange choice of adjective.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, maybe not the part where you bear your soul to me in a largely embarrassing midnight confession,&rdquo; Phil says, so Dan hits him in the arm, &ldquo;but the other recordings-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Other</i> recordings?!&rdquo; </p><p>Phil pauses, caught out. &ldquo;Oh. Uh, yeah. From what I can gather the recording device began recording any time it picked up noise, so there are a few&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>He trails off, and Dan buries his face in his hands for a few seconds, then takes a deep inhale, straightening up. &ldquo;Show me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Not sure this is the best time-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Phil, that&rsquo;s a recording of me doing a variety of explicit deeds. Fucking play it to me.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil hesitates, scanning Dan&rsquo;s face, then shrugs, pulls up a different recording, moves the play bar to the middle, and hits the space key. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Kiss me,</i>&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s voice says, husky and breathless. &ldquo;<i>Kiss me and then fuck me.</i>&rdquo; </p><p><i>Regret, regret, regret- </i>Dan lunges for the laptop, slamming the space bar. Unfortunately, he manages to press another key as well, and a different recording pops up. Before either he or Phil can do anything to stop it, Nikolai&rsquo;s voice is pouring from the speaker.</p><p><i>&ldquo;&hellip;my God, don&rsquo;t tell me you actually top in this-&rdquo;</i></p><p>Phil slams the lid of his laptop shut smartly, two pink spots appearing on his high cheeks. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll delete these, I think.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s fingers push into his temple, massaging the spot. &ldquo;So good of you to hang onto them until now, you wanker.&rdquo;</p><p>Silence falls, and for a moment the tension is taut to the point of being unbearable. Then, Dan hears a quiet, barely audible giggle. He looks at Phil, incredulous, and immediately upon seeing the creases of laughter around his glinting eyes, feels a swell of laughter bubbling up in his own chest. The tension snaps, and they let their streams of laughter spill out. Phil cards a hand through his hair, reaching for his tea again. </p><p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;know,&rdquo; Dan says, eyes glazed as he watches Phil&rsquo;s plump, pink lips seal over the rim of his mug, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve already lured me into your&hellip;&rdquo; he gestures to the plane interior. &ldquo;Den. Kind of redundant at this point to play it cool.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil looks at him quizzically, sipping. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well, as you have clear, recorded evidence of my unfortunate attachment to you right there,&rdquo; Dan says, stretching out on the bed a little more, settling into the familiar atmosphere of mildly absurd, irritation-fuelled hysteria, &ldquo;and I willingly endured your death-defying driving skills, then followed you into your plane in the middle of nowhere, it might be a reasonable assumption that I&rsquo;m, like,&rdquo; Dan waves a hand in the air between them, &ldquo;D.T.F.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil chokes around a mouthful of tea. He places the mug down sharply, eyes wide. It makes Dan laugh, and he leans back onto his hands. As it turns out, having every last scrap of his dignity laid out before them both is rather empowering. He has nothing left to hide, no reason to be coy, and it&rsquo;s now up to Phil whether he takes advantage or not. Dan really hasn&rsquo;t anything else to lose, at this point, sad though that thought might be.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to <i>assume</i>,&rdquo; Phil objects, scandalised, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to be a gentleman!&rdquo;</p><p>Dan nods gravely. &ldquo;By playing me audio recordings of me asking you to &lsquo;kiss and fuck me&rsquo;?&rdquo; </p><p>Phil&rsquo;s mouth opens, as if he&rsquo;s about to retort, but at the sight of Dan&rsquo;s smirk, he closes it again, a laugh escaping. &ldquo;If I do one of those things now, can you pretend I waited until, y&rsquo;know, a respectable amount of time had passed?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I could pretend I had a sudden urge to shuck off my wet clothes,&rdquo; Dan suggests with a hand thrown across his forehead for emphasis; he&rsquo;s enjoying the unusual sensation of having the power over this situation, and as usual when he feels even a lick of power, his theatric flair rears its head. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that his heart doubled in speed as soon as Phil hinted at physical contact. &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; Dan continues, voice as dramatic as if he were addressing a theatre-ful of patrons, &ldquo;as you&rsquo;re finding me a spare shirt to cover my immodesty, you can&rsquo;t help your gaze lingering on my bare skin - you try to stop yourself, but your hand reaches out of its own accord to stroke across my chest - my breath hitches, and-&rdquo;</p><p>Phil dives across the bed, pinning Dan to the mattress and kissing him. &ldquo;Hmm,&rdquo; he mumbles into the seam of Dan&rsquo;s lips, &ldquo;I forgot you never shut up.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s arms come up to wind around Phil&rsquo;s neck, a zing of pure joy ricocheting through his body as his familiar weight settles on top of him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t forgotten that you&rsquo;re ten times more tolerable to listen to when you&rsquo;re naked,&rdquo; Dan says, turning his head to urge Phil to kiss along his jaw. &ldquo;Please comply.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil chuckles, leaning up to pull his shirt off. &ldquo;Better?&rdquo; </p><p>A punch of air leaves Dan&rsquo;s chest; his hands spread themselves over Phil&rsquo;s toned stomach, re-learning the crevices either side of his belly, the smooth curvature of his hips.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Much.&rdquo; His index fingers trace the line of hair that leads from Phil&rsquo;s tummy button beneath the waistband of his trousers. He pulls at the waistband impatiently. &ldquo;Even better without these though, I reckon.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil sits back on his haunches, positioning himself on top of Dan&rsquo;s thighs. &ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; he asks, already sliding the zipper down. Dan&rsquo;s cock pulses, still trapped by his jeans. Phil is putting on a show, but Dan no longer has the ability to call him out on it. His eyes won&rsquo;t unstick themselves from the sight of Phil shimmying his trousers down his thighs, revealing a pair of black boxer briefs so tight that they might as well be nonexistent for all they manage to conceal. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan shoots him what he intends to be a&nbsp;withering look&nbsp;that probably doesn&rsquo;t come across very menacing. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember you being this vocal.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil smiles, using Dan&rsquo;s shoulder to steady himself as he peels the trousers off entirely. &ldquo;Shut me up, then.&rdquo; </p><p>Not needing to be told twice, Dan grabs the backs of Phil&rsquo;s thighs and manoeuvres him back until he&rsquo;s sprawled on his back. He pulls off his own t-shirt, getting more impatient by the minute to entwine himself in Phil as deeply as possible; he&rsquo;s been starving himself of this, for months, and now he wants to feast. As soon as he&rsquo;s free of his t-shirt, Dan begins pushing his lips against the miles of bare skin covering Phil&rsquo;s upper body. Phil&rsquo;s breathing goes strange and stuttery, and his hand loses itself in Dan&rsquo;s hair. </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; he whispers as Dan seals his mouth over a nipple, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Still talking to Susan?&rdquo; Dan asks with a snort, and Phil smacks him lightly in the back of the head. </p><p>&ldquo;Susan doesn&rsquo;t talk back nearly as much.&rdquo;</p><p>In response, Dan chooses to trail a line of kisses downwards, through the valley of Phil&rsquo;s pectoral muscles, over the plane of his stomach, nipping gently at that tantalising rivulet of hair slicing through his pelvic region. When he gets to the boxer briefs, he pauses, lifting his gaze as he tucks his fingertips into the waistband. </p><p>Phil makes a sort of choking noise as their eyes meet, which is pleasant to hear. &ldquo;Lift,&rdquo; Dan tells him, and when his hips rise, pulls them off in a flourish. Dan had thought the thick, gorgeous shape of Phil&rsquo;s cock was deeply ingrained into his memory, but even the image he&rsquo;d conjured up in the dead of night, when he couldn&rsquo;t stop himself from indulging in nostalgia, had been lacking in the exquisite detail of reality. He takes hold of the base in one hand, letting the warm, pulsing flesh push all thought from his mind. &ldquo;I missed you too,&rdquo; he says, and Phil whimpers. </p><p>Dan takes his time blowing Phil, letting him glide in and out of his mouth as he lifts his head and sinks down again and again. Phil&rsquo;s body slackens, sinking into the hard mattress so totally that it&rsquo;s as if he hasn&rsquo;t relaxed once in all the time that&rsquo;s passed since they last did this. The sensation of Phil atop Dan&rsquo;s tongue is comforting in its thickness, stretching his lips wide, reminding him of how it feels to be so open. He would like for Phil to know this, wants to share the intoxicating power of utter vulnerability. He pulls off, suddenly alight with an idea, and sits up, crawling over Phil&rsquo;s spread body until his face hovers above Phil&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You know what Nikolai mentioned,&rdquo; Dan begins, testing the waters.&nbsp;</p><p>Instantly, Phil&rsquo;s hands stop wandering over his back. &ldquo;Are you seriously bringing up my ex-husband right now?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan chuckles, then sweeps a tongue over his lower lip, tasting Phil there, salty and sour; Phil&rsquo;s eyes fall to the movement with obvious interest.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been thinking,&rdquo; Dan continues, determined to persevere with the thought if it could lead where he hopes it might. To soften the blow of blindsiding Phil with Nikolai&rsquo;s name, Dan dots a few light kisses over his jaw. &ldquo;When we&hellip; did things before. Were you just indulging me, because I suggested we try it a certain way, and it was my first time?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil arches his head backwards, wordlessly encouraging Dan to move his lips to his neck. &ldquo;W-what do you mean? It was always amazing with you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hmm,&rdquo; Dan says, sucking gently at the spot right below Phil&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;So you never wanted to do it a different way? Like&hellip;&rdquo; His hand, which has been resting on Phil&rsquo;s hip, trickles over his thigh, dipping into the cavern between Phil&rsquo;s legs. He lets his fingers wander even lower, past the swell of his balls. He watches Phil&rsquo;s face intently, trying to gauge the reaction, and presses the tip of one finger to the tight, puckered entrance at his rear. &ldquo;This way?&rdquo; </p><p>For the first time, Dan is able to witness the crystal blue of Phil&rsquo;s irises thinning and nearly disappearing entirely, swallowed up by the black holes widening in their centres. It&rsquo;s not until Dan removes his finger that Phil is able to summon a response. </p><p>&ldquo;I- I don&rsquo;t have much of a preference,&rdquo; he whispers, stammering. &ldquo;Is&hellip; is that something you&rsquo;d want to try, or-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Phil,&rdquo; Dan interrupts, feeling the smile teasing the corner of his mouth as he sees through Phil&rsquo;s poor attempt at nonchalance, &ldquo;do you want me to fuck you?&rdquo; </p><p>Phil is quiet for a moment, but Dan holds his gaze, one eyebrow cocked, hopefully looking far more in control of himself than he feels. The elbow he&rsquo;s using to hold himself up begins to tremble, threatening to give way, but he holds steady, needing to hear Phil speak the words. </p><p>Then, Phil nods, just once. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan smiles, leaning in to seal their mouths together. The eagerness with which Phil responds conveys his excitement, and Dan lets him twine their tongues together, allows Phil&rsquo;s arms to draw him in around the neck. After a few minutes however, Dan&rsquo;s self-control is reaching its very peak, what with Phil&rsquo;s cock trapped between their bodies still, and the anticipation of what it might be like to slip inside of him lurking so tantalisingly on the horizon. </p><p>Dan unwinds himself carefully, sitting up and reaching for the button of his own jeans. &ldquo;Do you have, um, stuff?&rdquo; </p><p>His question prompts Phil into immediate action; he sits up, peeling himself off the bed in order to stagger over to an overhead cupboard, which he reaches up to open. Dan&rsquo;s fingers stumble on the zipper of his jeans, attention ensnared by the sight of the lean, naked body in front of him, stretched out in a delicious long line of pale, pure skin, hiding terrains of thick muscle, tightened by years of diligent workouts. His cock strains against the fly of his trousers, imagining what it might be like to bury himself inside of such a temple; his fingers work frantically to open the zip. Eventually, Phil finds what he&rsquo;s looking for, and throws a bottle of lube and a four condom packets onto the bed. </p><p>Dan picks a few of the foil packets up, eyebrows raised. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m flattered that you presume so highly of my stamina, but-&rdquo;</p><p>Phil shuts him up using the method he seems to be realising is the most effective - jumping back on the bed and kissing him hard. &ldquo;Thought we could take it in turns,&rdquo; Phil growls into Dan&rsquo;s mouth, because obviously he&rsquo;s intent on driving Dan to the brink of insanity.&nbsp;</p><p>A strangled noise escapes Dan&rsquo;s throat, and he pushes Phil backwards until he&rsquo;s astride him again, back to pulling off his jeans, which thankfully goes a lot more smoothly this time. He slides his underwear off too, then reaches for the condom packet, ten steps ahead of himself; Phil&rsquo;s hand on his arm makes him pause. </p><p>&ldquo;Woah, uh, it&rsquo;s not my first rodeo but I&rsquo;m probably gonna need a little prep before-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; Dan mutters, throwing the condom aside for a moment. He shakes his head, blood thrumming in his ears, and smooths his hands up Phil&rsquo;s gorgeous thighs. &ldquo;Sorry. Okay, what do I do?&rdquo; </p><p>Phil sits up, reaching for the lube, and un-pops the cap. &ldquo;Want me to do it?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan snatches the bottle from him. &ldquo;Fuck right off.&rdquo; </p><p>He pours some of the gloop onto his fingers, remembering how, when they&rsquo;d done this before, Phil had warmed the substance before letting it touch his skin. He copies the action, coating his hands with it, then looking to Phil for further instruction. Phil opens his legs wider, allowing Dan to fit himself between them.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you ever done this to yourself?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Only since you did it to me,&rdquo; Dan admits before he can stop himself. </p><p>Phil grins, unsubtly conveying his thoughts around this, and Dan only barely resists the urge to flick him in the balls. &ldquo;Same thing, then,&rdquo; Phil says.</p><p>&ldquo;Will it hurt?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil eases himself back down onto his elbows. &ldquo;Doubt it,&rdquo; Phil answers in a soft sigh. He lets out a little moan as Dan&rsquo;s fingertips press against him. &ldquo;Fuck. No, I don&rsquo;t think this is gonna hurt at all.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s fingers slide into Phil as easily as if he were pushing them into warm bread dough. The walls of hot, soft muscle close in around him, drawing each finger deeper as he adds them one at a time. Phil murmurs vaguely bossy commands, telling him to scissor and stretch, but half the words are lost to his groans of bliss, each one making Dan shudder more violently than the last. </p><p>&ldquo;Ugh, Dan,&rdquo; he says, voice desperate despite it seeming like barely any time has passed. He has one hand wrapped around the back of his right thigh, holding it up to allow Dan better access. Dan moves closer, brushes Phil&rsquo;s hand away and lets the crook of Phil&rsquo;s knee drape over his shoulder. &ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; Phil mutters, but doesn&rsquo;t protest. &ldquo;Y-you can stop now,&rdquo; he urges, but Dan keeps on, wanting to be totally sure. Phil seems so tight, so <i>impossibly</i> tight, and whilst it is maddening to picture thrusting inside of such tightness, the thought of hurting Phil without meaning to is terrible enough to keep Dan stretching with his fingers, just in case. He changes the angle just slightly when his wrist threatens to cramp, and Phil swears, louder than he has so far. &ldquo;Fff-<i>uck</i>. Do that again.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan does do it again. He does it many more times, pressing the pads of his fingers to that same spot until Phil is writhing against the covers, until his gasps sound more like gurgles, until his hands are scrabbling at Dan&rsquo;s wrist to pull his fingers free. </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, Dan please, I&rsquo;m ready, I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; he garbles. </p><p>For a long moment, Dan is too hypnotised by the wrecked, flushed mess that&rsquo;s become of the Adonis-like man sprawled out naked before him to react. He stares at Phil&rsquo;s reddened, slick lips, puffy from where he&rsquo;s been biting them.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Dan,&rdquo; Phil chokes out, desperate. </p><p>The sound of his name slaps Dan back into coherence. He pats the space around him, searching for the condom packet he&rsquo;d thrown aside before. It seems to elude him for a while, but eventually he finds it, and rips the packet with his teeth. Thankfully, condoms are a part of sexual experience that he is not out of his depth with, as Beth had insisted on him using at least one, sometimes more, whenever they slept together. </p><p>He rolls it on with ease, thankful for the many opportunities he&rsquo;s had to practice for this moment, and takes hold of Phil by the hips, dragging him forwards with a sharp tug, until the head of his cock is aligned with Phil&rsquo;s slick opening. Phil is staring at him in amazement, and Dan doesn&rsquo;t blame him - he&rsquo;s exuding a confidence born purely of adrenaline, and it&rsquo;s making him into someone unrecognisable, someone composed and assertive. Someone hot.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; he asks; his shaky voice somewhat shatters the illusion. </p><p>&ldquo;God, yes,&rdquo; Phil replies, apparently not noticing.&nbsp;</p><p>Dan inches his hips forwards, letting the head of his cock press past the outer rim; Phil&rsquo;s head tips backwards, a sigh of ecstasy spilling from his throat. His hand releases its grip on the covers, and he brings his long fingers to wrap around his cock. </p><p>Even the sight is intoxicating. Ignoring all other sensation for now, Phil looks maddeningly good this way; Dan&rsquo;s hips almost lock in place, just watching him <i>feel</i>. The thin branches of Phil&rsquo;s neck bones are protruding beneath the skin, mottled from where Dan has nipped and bitten. His puffed chest is rising and falling rapidly, his shoulders trembling, misted with a sheen of rainwater and sweat. He ducks his head again, meeting Dan&rsquo;s eyes, and Dan remembers he&rsquo;s supposed to be moving, that he is supposed to be the one in control of this. He doesn&rsquo;t feel very in control, suddenly, too shaken by the onslaught of sensation attacking from all angles. </p><p>As if he&rsquo;s gleaned these concerns from Dan&rsquo;s mind through osmosis, Phil says, &ldquo;wait,&rdquo; and Dan pauses, terrified he&rsquo;s done something wrong. Phil sits up, glazed and sluggish, then pushes Dan backwards with a hand against his shoulder. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wr-&rdquo; </p><p>Dan lands back on his tailbone, and suddenly Phil is astride him, piled in his lap like a huge, gorgeous, naked gift. He angles himself without needing to look, keeping his eyes locked on Dan&rsquo;s the whole time, and sinks himself back down onto Dan&rsquo;s cock, lips parted, eyes fluttering. A moan pours out of Dan&rsquo;s throat as the unexpected bliss crashes over him, as the sensation of slick, hot, closeness grips him by the soul. He is buried inside of Phil&rsquo;s pure, angelic body, as far as he can get. It&rsquo;s agony, because Phil has gone still, letting himself adjust to the intrusion. Dan&rsquo;s head falls against Phil&rsquo;s chest, trying to keep calm when he wants so badly to shout at Phil to move even slightly, would trade everything he owns for the relief of it. </p><p>And then, miraculously, Phil does. </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; Dan whispers, brokenly, as Phil&rsquo;s hips begin rolling forwards. </p><p>His fingers dig themselves into Phil&rsquo;s arms, and he buries his face deeper into Phil&rsquo;s chest. Phil&rsquo;s arms wind around his shoulders. He lifts his hips up until Dan almost slips out of him entirely, then spears himself back down with a shudder. </p><p>&ldquo;God, <i>Dan</i>,&rdquo; Phil groans, speeding up the pace. He uses his grip on Dan&rsquo;s shoulders to keep steady, bouncing up and down in Dan&rsquo;s lap faster and faster, barely letting Dan gasp even a snatch of air. &ldquo;Dan- Dan, would you touch me?&rdquo;</p><p>Delirious, Dan mentally berates himself for not having the common sense to do this before now. He reaches clumsily between their bodies, barely holding himself together, and closes a fist around Phil&rsquo;s cock, which is hot and rigid to the touch. He pumps his hand in time with the thrust of Phil&rsquo;s hips, and in less than a minute Phil is crying out, biting down on Dan&rsquo;s neck so hard that Dan wonders if he might bleed. Phil&rsquo;s come splashes Dan&rsquo;s chest and stomach, coating his hand, and all Dan can think is how he wishes he could taste it.</p><p>Dan doesn&rsquo;t last much longer after that, as Phil doesn&rsquo;t so much as stutter in his rhythm. He manages to push his hips upwards a few times, to make the most of this miraculous moment, locked together with Phil in the most intimate possible way. As the tip of his cock presses once again into that spot that makes Phil weak, Phil jerks and gasps in his arms. That&rsquo;s the moment that Dan is unable to hold on any longer. He squeezes Phil&rsquo;s arm, groaning into the crook of his neck as he feels his own release fill the condom, a hundred white-hot stars scorching over his skin in a brilliant, blinding shower. </p><p>For a minute after, they don&rsquo;t move, draped over one another in various ways, just reorienting themselves as they float back to this dimension. Dan pushes his lips against Phil&rsquo;s damp skin in a way that doesn&rsquo;t feel chaste enough to be kisses. Eventually, Phil leans backwards, slowly lifting himself off Dan&rsquo;s lap, letting him slip out. With a shaky, fumbling hand, Dan pulls off the condom, putting it carefully on the floor because he&rsquo;s too spent to dispose of it properly just yet. </p><p>In the next moment, he feels damp fingers around his wrist, and then Dan is being pulled, until he&rsquo;s flat on his back, Phil&rsquo;s arm stretched out beneath his neck. They both stare at the ceiling, listening to the sound of their own gradually slowing breaths. </p><p>Dan rolls onto his side towards Phil, trailing fingers up his ribs, then into the cavern of his underarm, twisting the snatch of hair there between his fingers. He&rsquo;s sweaty, and it&rsquo;s still confusing to Dan that it doesn&rsquo;t gross him out; instead, the musky, heavy scent of Phil&rsquo;s perspiration is intoxicating, makes him want to bury his face in Phil&rsquo;s shoulder and lick the moisture from his skin. So he does. </p><p>Phil turns to peer at him, amusedly. &ldquo;Perv.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Dan smiles, not caring that it seems peculiar, because he knows Phil doesn&rsquo;t really care.&nbsp;&ldquo;Was it okay?&rdquo; Dan asks, as if he isn&rsquo;t fully aware of how beyond incredible the last half hour had been for both of them.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Amazing,&rdquo; Phil replies, rolling onto his side to kiss him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m as good as you at&hellip; that.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil&rsquo;s mouth twitches, and he leans back to stare into Dan&rsquo;s eyes. His pupils are returning to a more even size, though they&rsquo;re still taking up most of the space in Phil&rsquo;s irises. The ring of azure around them glimmers brightly. </p><p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t sell yourself short, mate,&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;I had a <i>very</i> good time.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan snorts, mostly at Phil&rsquo;s use of the word &lsquo;mate&rsquo;. &ldquo;So you prefer it, then? Being like&hellip; the one who&hellip; um.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bottoms?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s only response is a mortifyingly quick blush. </p><p>Phil laughs, prodding Dan&rsquo;s red cheek with his finger-tip. &ldquo;I mean it. I don&rsquo;t have a strong preference for either way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just Nikolai seemed so, like, surprised when he found out-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dan,&rdquo; Phil says, already grimacing, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only gonna address this once with you, because I don&rsquo;t particularly want you thinking about this in detail, but having sex with Nikolai is a very different experience to having sex with you. And not in a good way. Could you ever imagine him being as considerate of my preferences as you&rsquo;re being right now?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s nose wrinkles. &ldquo;You have a point. So&hellip; you&rsquo;re good with either? Top or bottom?&rdquo; </p><p>The flame in Dan&rsquo;s cheeks is fanned even saying the words. &ldquo;Hmm,&rdquo; Phil says, then leans in to kiss Dan again, harder this time, knocking him backwards until he&rsquo;s on his back again. &ldquo;Think I might need a reminder of what it&rsquo;s like to top again. Y&rsquo;know, just so I have all the evidence before I make up my mind.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Jesus, you&rsquo;re more of a horn-dog than I remember,&rdquo; Dan laughs, though he&rsquo;s already winding a leg around Phil&rsquo;s to pull him closer. </p><p>*</p><p>They&rsquo;ve been holed up in Phil&rsquo;s tiny living space, at the back of a stationary plane, mostly naked, for almost twelve hours. They&rsquo;d napped for a while, but now they&rsquo;re awake, watching an episode of Parks and Recreation because Phil has never seen it and Dan simply cannot allow anyone he associates with to not get his references to the show. </p><p>Somewhere in the middle of one of Leslie&rsquo;s rousing speeches, Phil&rsquo;s phone beeps. It&rsquo;s not the first beep they&rsquo;ve both pretended not to hear, and it&rsquo;s perhaps for this reason that now Phil sighs and reaches for it, his other arm around Dan&rsquo;s shoulders, fingers tickling idly across his upper arm. He frowns at the many messages filling the screen, scrolling through a few, then placing the phone upside down on the bedside shelf again. The amusing dialogue of the show loses its potency; Dan waits, breath held, for the inevitable.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna have to get back to work soon,&rdquo; Phil says, just as Dan predicted. &ldquo;I kind of&hellip; ran off on Martyn and Cornelia and PJ after the UN thing.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I figured,&rdquo; Dan says, already resigned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. It was, um. Good to see you, and stuff. Weird without all the snow and altitude. But good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; Phil says. From the way he has the offer so readily at hand, Dan knows he&rsquo;s been holding it back for a while. He pretends he hasn&rsquo;t heard, instead focusing on the screen, where Leslie has just fallen into a giant pit. <i>Relatable</i>. Phil nudges him beneath the blanket with one foot. &ldquo;Dan, did you hear me?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan sighs, struggling out of Phil&rsquo;s embrace. They should have talked about this sooner. Now they&rsquo;re going to fight, and one of them&rsquo;s going to hurt the other, and then they&rsquo;ll split apart again for an indeterminably long bout of miserable, awful separation. </p><p>&ldquo;I heard you.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan runs a hand through his still-damp hair. They&rsquo;d had showers a while ago in Phil&rsquo;s tiny closet-shower. Though it would have been extremely nice to have stood beneath the spray together, there was no possible way they could both fit, so they took it in turns. Dan had gone first, and when he&rsquo;d emerged, Phil had made more tea, and produced a packet of biscuits. He&rsquo;d given Dan a robe - stolen from The Secret of the Alps, he noticed - for him to dry off and set him up with the laptop to watch Parks and Rec until he&rsquo;d cleaned himself of the evidence of their debauchery too. It had been wholesome and unusually soft behaviour; entirely too easy to fall into, and forget that their circumstances didn&rsquo;t allow for such kind, sweet interludes without a price. </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even want to be a lawyer,&rdquo; Phil says, like it&rsquo;s as simple as that. &ldquo;Just think it over a bit more-&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I did that,&rdquo; Dan snaps, then checks himself, breathing deeply. If he can avoid getting upset and defensive, that would be ideal. &ldquo;I already did the freaking out and running off to re-evaluate my choices. It didn&rsquo;t work. You were there, you <i>know</i> it didn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil shuts the laptop, cutting off the peppy American voices of the Parks and Rec cast. &ldquo;What exactly didn&rsquo;t work, though? What did you expect to happen up there?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan laughs humourlessly, gesturing between them. &ldquo;Not this.&rdquo; He winces. It came out meaner than he intended it to. &ldquo;I mean, obviously I&rsquo;m glad I met you and we dragged each other into a destructive pattern of secretly bonking behind closed doors&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Heartfelt,&rdquo; Phil replies; even though it&rsquo;s sarcasm, Dan can tell without looking over at him that he&rsquo;s smiling. </p><p>&ldquo;..but, even you have to admit it probably wasn&rsquo;t the smartest decision on my part. Or yours, come to that.&rdquo; Dan picks at the thin, messy bedclothes, frowning. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m very good at the self-reflective stuff. S&rsquo;just better if I crack on, stop fantasising that there&rsquo;s some dream career waiting in the wings somewhere.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Having a job that makes you happy isn&rsquo;t a crazy fantasy, Dan,&rdquo; Phil says. He makes everything sound so easy. Dan kind of misses that about him, dangerous and seductive though it is. &ldquo;You could come with me. We could work it out together.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Come with you where?&rdquo; Dan asks, turning to him incredulously. &ldquo;No offence, mate, but you&rsquo;ve got no more clue than I have right now. You have no money or plans, you said it yourself. It&rsquo;s very admirable, all the charity stuff, but what&rsquo;re you gonna do when the public grow bored of you without all the divorce drama? How are you gonna fund your humanitarian schemes?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil shrugs, a composed, slightly amused smile gracing his features. He looks entirely unbothered by these questions, and Dan is suddenly so envious of his ability to shrug off anxiety that it makes a spurt of anger shoot through his chest. He rolls his eyes, throwing the covers off his legs. He&rsquo;s about to get up, to find his clothes and put an end to this brief day-cation from reality, when Phil&rsquo;s hand on his arm, gentle and cautious, gives him pause. </p><p>He waits, the warmth of Phil&rsquo;s fingers draining the frustration from his bones, easing the tension in his body. Phil shuffles closer, hands sliding to rest on Dan&rsquo;s shoulders, then rubbing gently, thumbs digging into the knots of taut muscle. It&rsquo;s so glorious that Dan sinks back into him, immediately slackening, his mind abruptly washed of every concern that had just been plaguing it. </p><p>&ldquo;Has anyone ever told you that you think too much?&rdquo; Phil murmurs into his ear. </p><p>&ldquo;I get the feeling you&rsquo;re about to,&rdquo; Dan retorts, then feels a satisfied sigh slip out as Phil digs his clever fingers in deeper. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to Africa,&rdquo; he says in a low, soothing voice that Dan knows is probably one he&rsquo;s been trained to use in stressful situations, but works so well that he can&rsquo;t be bothered to protest. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a cluster of villages in Kenya that need a lot of help. Installing water filtration systems, building schools, that sort of thing. That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m going next.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh. Right.&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s shoulders tense up again. <i>Africa. Could he be jetting off further?</i> &ldquo;How long f-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You should come with me,&rdquo; Phil says for the third time. His hands become still on Dan&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious. We could use you out there.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan rolls his eyes, though Phil is behind him and can&rsquo;t see. &ldquo;As convincing as that is, we both know I have the muscles of a cooked noodle, so I doubt I&rsquo;d be much use to you-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not always about physical labour,&rdquo; Phil interrupts, like he&rsquo;s prepared this argument months in advance. He&rsquo;s too good at debating, that&rsquo;s the trouble. Dan&rsquo;s never stood a chance trying to last in the ring with him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got other hugely beneficial skills, I&rsquo;ve seen it myself. You can fix pretty much anything you put your mind to. That&rsquo;s kind of extraordinary.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan blinks, not sure how to react to the unexpected praise. &ldquo;Well&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know about &lsquo;anything I put my mind to&rsquo;-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Even so, you&rsquo;d probably have a hell of a lot more clue than I would,&rdquo; Phil points out, and Dan has to admit, although he&rsquo;s never witnessed Phil attempt to repair or even patch up anything beyond his own fragile ego, he doubts very much that he&rsquo;d be particularly skilled at it. He tries to imagine Phil with a spanner in his hand, tightening the joins in the municipal pipe under the blaring, scorching African sun. He has to hide his bubble of absurd laughter. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a fan of the heat,&rdquo; Dan protests, weakly.&nbsp;</p><p>Whilst this is true, and he&rsquo;d deliberately chosen the destination of his last runaway attempt to be the opposite of somewhere hot, Dan can feel his soul yearning for the adventure. For being with Phil, daily, their perpetual bickering exacerbated by the blazing sun, and then soothed by the cool night air, locked away in some dark room they&rsquo;d built together, free to kiss each other&rsquo;s sun-blistered skin all night long. His fingers itch for the fantasy, and he clenches them into fists, knowing he shouldn&rsquo;t dare to so much as want it.</p><p>Phil places a kiss to his shoulder, then leans away. &ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Phil says, making Dan&rsquo;s heart sink. &ldquo;I mean, when you&rsquo;re so passionate about law, a little sunshine seems laughable doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan rolls his eyes, but a laugh escapes anyway, so he turns to whack Phil in the arm. Phil lets him, then catches him by the wrists, holding Dan&rsquo;s gaze. &ldquo;I think you could be happy. I think we could make each other happy.&rdquo; </p><p>One of Dan&rsquo;s eyebrows arches. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d drive each other bonkers.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil smiles. &ldquo;Same thing, I reckon.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan shakes his head, knowing in every cell of his being that this is completely mental, to abandon his life again for a man who infuriates him daily. But he also knows, perhaps even more strongly, that he&rsquo;s as in love with Phil as he is exasperated with him. &ldquo;If I leave again&hellip; I won&rsquo;t be able to come back.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil squeezes his hands around Dan&rsquo;s. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he agrees. &ldquo;Me neither.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan chews his lip, though his resistance has more or less melted away. &ldquo;Are you only offering to take me with you because you feel sorry for me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Phil says, teasingly.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m rescuing you from a life of paperwork and office parties.&rdquo; A smile breaks across his gorgeous face, making his eyes soften, crinkle at the sides. His voice drops into its rare tone of sincerity. &ldquo;Dan, I&rsquo;m asking you if you&rsquo;d come with me. Because I watched you attempt to ski away from me up a hill and fall straight down it, and somehow managed to fall tragically, pathetically in love with you in the same instant. I want you to come. Because don&rsquo;t really fancy trying to stay away from you anymore.&rdquo; </p><p>*</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s not sure how it happens really. One minute, he&rsquo;s in a lecture hall with the most annoying girl on the planet talking his ear off about succulents and her hot personal tutor, and the next he&rsquo;s in the front seat of a fully-fuelled plane, beside a stunningly handsome philanthropist-slash-ski-enthusiast-slash-pilot, headed for a continent halfway around the world. He hasn&rsquo;t told his parents where they&rsquo;re going yet. Phil hasn&rsquo;t told the public, or Pj or Cornelia or Martyn. It&rsquo;s all a bit&nbsp;&lsquo;up in the air&rsquo;. They&rsquo;ll tell anyone who needs to know when they land again, when the intense rays of sun are soaking into their pale skin, flooding their veins with Vitamin D. </p><p>Dan reaches across the chasm between his and Phil&rsquo;s seats, letting his hand dangle invitingly until Phil notices and takes it, rolling his eyes and telling Dan he&rsquo;s a &ldquo;right sap&rdquo;. But he threads their fingers together anyway, angling the yoke towards the sky, and Dan leans back in his chair as the clouds zoom closer, welcoming the oncoming oblivion. A wild thought swims at him from nowhere, as if it fell straight out of the Heavens:&nbsp;</p><p>He&rsquo;d be just fine if they never had to come down.</p><p><b><br /></b></p><p><b>The End.</b></p><p><br /></p><p><b>(Yes, there will be an epilogue.

Whether it\u2019s your first time posting a work on AO3 or you need a refresher, aka \u201cwhat the fuck am I supposed to put in this field?\u201d, here\u2019s a guide on how to publish on AO3. I\u2019ve posted more than a 100 works, so this is more like an explanation on how I do it, but I\u2019ll try to be as detailed as I can.

Think like a TV show, what rating would they give your story?</p><p>\n\n<b>General Archives</b>\n\nis like a meet-cute thing, nothing much action-wise happens, and/or it\u2019s mostly conversation. </p><p>\n\n<b>Teen and Up </b>\n\nwould be kiss and maybe some heavy petting? Or canon violence. </p><p>\n\n<b>Mature </b>\n\nis implicit sex, more descriptive violence. I personally either use either teen and up or explicit, rarely mature. I think some people use this rating when there\u2019s a trigger warning, like rape/non-con or major character death.</p><p>\n\n<b>Explicit </b>\n\nis explicit description of sex, violence, torture, gore, etc.</p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p><b>Archive Warnings</b></p></blockquote><p>Pretty self-explanatory, but I\u2019ll add the in-depth explanations from AO3.</p><p>\n\n<b>Choose Not To Use Archive Warnings</b>\n\n<br/></p><p>Use this if you don&rsquo;t want to warn for anything. You may also choose this option if you don&rsquo;t know what you should warn for; if you don&rsquo;t like warning for certain topics or warnings in general; if you want to avoid some spoilers, but not others; etc.</p><p>\n\n<b>Graphic Depictions Of Violence</b>\n\n<br/></p><p>This is for gory, graphic, explicitly described violence. Exactly where to draw the line is your call.</p><p>\n\n<b>Major Character Death</b> \n\n<br/></p><p>Please use your best judgment about who counts as a major character.</p><p>\n\n<b>No Archive Warnings Apply</b>\n\n<br/></p><p>Use this if the Archive warnings don&rsquo;t apply to your content. (In other words, if it contains no graphic depictions of violence, major character death, rape/non-con, or underage sexual activity.)</p><p>\n\n<b>Rape/Non-Con</b>\n\n<br/></p><p>This is your call. If you think your content may be seen as containing non-consensual sexual activity, but you don&rsquo;t feel like using this warning or you&rsquo;re not sure if you should, you always have the option of using &ldquo;Choose Not to Use Archive Warnings&rdquo; instead.</p><p>\n\n<b>Underage</b>\n\n<br/></p><p>This is for descriptions or depictions of sexual activity by characters under the age of eighteen. (This doesn&rsquo;t include dating activity like kissing or vague references with no actual description or depiction.) This warning generally applies to humans; if you are creating a pornographic work about space aliens who only live for a month or thousand-year-old vampires with twelve-year-old bodies, please just use your best judgment. You are always free to specify characters&rsquo; ages or to use &ldquo;Choose Not to Use Archive Warnings&rdquo;.</p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p><b>Fandoms</b></p></blockquote><p>So you want to put more than less, and the more specific you go, the better. Don\u2019t just use \u201cAll Media Types\u201d, use the specific video game/movie as well. If you\u2019re not sure, start typing the name and look at the automatic entries.</p><p>For example, let\u2019s say I\u2019m posting a Dorian/Cullen in DAI, I\u2019ll do \u201cDragon Age: Inquisition\u201d, \u201cDragon Age (Video Games)\u201d, and \u201cDragon Age - All Media Types\u201d. </p><p>If I was to publish something on characters from two different movies but in the same universe, like a Thor/Steve from the MCU, I would insert the two movies on top of the universe base tags.</p><p>For an AU of another media, for example a Pirates of the Caribbean AU with Tony as Jack Sparrow and Steve as Elizabeth, I wouldn\u2019t add the PotC fandom, just the Marvel one.</p><p>If it\u2019s a crossover, I tag the two fandoms. Again, this is a personal preference, you could add the two fandoms with an AU, but while it could bring you more visibility, it could be confusing for the readers. </p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p><b>Categories</b></p></blockquote><p>The easiest tag imo, pretty self-explanatory. If it\u2019s more than two persons, it\u2019s automatically multi. This refers only to the main relationship of the story, and if there\u2019s none, it\u2019s \u201cGen\u201d. I never used \u201cOther\u201d, so I don\u2019t know about that one.</p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p><b>\tRelationships</b></p></blockquote><p>The main relationship of the story.</p><p>For polyamorous relationships, first add the full relationship, then combinations of them for more visibility. For example, that\u2019d be \u201cSteve/Tony/Bucky\u201d, then \u201cSteve/Tony\u201d, \u201cSteve/Bucky\u201d and \u201cTony/Bucky\u201d. That way the main relationship is first but your story is shown in the three others pairings. </p><p>If there\u2019s minor relationships, there\u2019s a \u201cMinor or Background Relationship(s)\u201d tag. Depending of the importance of those minor relationships, and if they influence the flow of the story, I would also tag those relationships. If it\u2019s mentioned for two lines, don\u2019t tag it. If it\u2019s been added for diversity, don\u2019t tag it. Don\u2019t tag minor rarepairs for the sake of your story showing in the tag, that gives false hope and is just annoying. </p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p><b>\tCharacters</b></p></blockquote><p>Always tag the characters of your relationship(s) first, then everyone that influences your story. If the person is in there for two lines, depending of the length of your story, don\u2019t tag them.</p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p><b>Additional Tags</b></p></blockquote><p>I think that\u2019s the part people have the most difficulty with. Some don\u2019t tag enough, some tag too much. I personally think there\u2019s a good balance to have so the overall amount of tags doesn\u2019t take more space than the summary. Add tags that characterizes your story and also any trigger warnings.\u00a0</p><p><b>Suggestions/automatic entries</b> for this part are of a great help, and you can always come back later when you get a new tag idea.</p><p>First I\u2019ll tag if it\u2019s an AU with \u201c<b>Alternative Universe</b>\u201d + whatever that AU might be, look up the suggestions because yours might be in here, like \u201cAlternative Universe - Canon Divergence\u201d, etc.</p><p>Tag the <b>overall mood</b> of the fic. Angst, hurt/comfort, fluff, bad ending, angst with happy ending, fluff and smut, etc.</p><p>If it\u2019s a <b>PWP </b>or the story has <b>smut</b>, tag with whatever happens: Anal Sex, Rimming, Blow Job, Size Kink, Top!X, Bottom!Y, etc. Kinks are pretty important. Also \u201cPWP\u201d, \u201cPorn with Feelings\u201d, etc. </p><p>Also tag your <b>tropes</b>! Sharing body warmth, Slow burn, Friends to lovers, Enemies to lovers, Pretending to be a Couple, Soulmate, Fuck or Die, 5+1, and so on. Those are always fun.</p><p>Type the main characters\u2019 names and look up the suggestions, those can always be fun to add or give you other ideas. </p><p>Add the <b>triggers </b>too, like \u201cMajor Character Death\u201d, \u201cRape/Non-Con\u201d, etc. and there\u2019s also one for \u201cAdditional Warnings In Author&rsquo;s Note\u201c.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>PREFACE</b></h2><p>Thus starts the part where we cry a little while writing it.</p><blockquote><p><b>Work Title</b></p></blockquote><p>Either a poetic cute quote of your story or lyrics, I guess? Make sure to credit the song in your author\u2019s notes if you quote it</p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p><b>Summary</b></p></blockquote><p>You can go multiple ways with this, but I find this to be the hardest for me. It can be just a quote, or a combo of a quote of the story and a short description, the quote gives an idea of the general mood of the story. </p><p>There\u2019s also a description + AKA summarized main topic that\u2019s been popular nowadays. </p><p>If it\u2019s a prompt fill, you can put the prompt.</p><p>There\u2019s really no bad summary, unless it\u2019s \u201cI\u2019M REALLY BAD AT SUMMARY PLEASE CLICK AND ENJOY\u201d. Do your best and readers who enjoy your style or the plot will click on your story.</p><p>Summary isn\u2019t the place for the author\u2019s notes either, add those underneath in \u201cNotes\u201d.</p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p><b>Notes</b></p></blockquote><p>Notes are the only option that you have to click on for the bubbles to appear. If you unclick, whatever you wrote in the bubble will be deleted, so be careful. </p><p>Generally, <b>beginning</b> notes are for warnings, shoutouts to the alpha, beta, people who helped you write the story, credits to the song or whatever/whoever inspired you, that sort of things. If the triggers contain spoilers, you can add those to the end notes and mention they\u2019re at the end instead. </p><p>I like to add any links to the <b>end </b>notes, such as my Tumblr or Twitter, any playlist that I listened to while writing the story, what inspired me to write a scene, etc. Also a reminder to leave kudos or comments is always nice.</p><p>\n\n<b>How to add a link: &lt;a href=&ldquo;LINK HERE&rdquo; rel=&ldquo;nofollow&rdquo;&gt;TEXT HERE&lt;/a&gt;</b></p><p><b>How to add an image: \u00a0&lt;img src = \u201cIMAGE URL\u201d alt=\u201cimage\u201d /&gt;</b>\n\n<br/></p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/201\" target=\"_blank\">Full article on how to embed media on AO3</a></p><p><br/></p><h2><b>ASSOCIATIONS</b></h2><p><b>Some things to note about this part:</b></p><p>If you\u2019re writing a multi-chaptered story, check the \u201cThis work has multiple chapters\u201d because it\u2019ll show as a completed story otherwise, and nobody wants that. </p><p>If you choose to save your draft and publish it at a later date, once it\u2019s published, the date will be of when you saved it as a draft, so it\u2019s not going to show on top of the list. You have to manually \u201cset a different publication date\u201d once you\u2019re ready to publish.</p><p>How to save a draft is explained in \u201cWork Text\u201d</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>PRIVACY</b></h2><p>You can choose to <b>show your work only to registered users</b>, that means they have to be logged in in order to see your story. </p><p>You can also d<b>isable comments from guests</b>, so people have to log in to leave you a comment. If your work is seen as \u201cproblematic\u201d or you\u2019ve previously dealt with negative comments, this is a good way to prevent them. Assholes rarely like to sign their shit.</p><p>Last, you can choose to<b> enable moderation on the comments</b>. That means guests and logged in users can leave comments, but they won\u2019t appear on your story until you approve of them. It\u2019s a different way to filter. </p><p><br/></p><h2><b>WORK TITLE</b></h2><p>You have the options to either enter your story in HTML or in Rich Text. Paste or write in Rich Text, then I suggest Previewing. HTML code will automatically adds itself when you do that, and if you want, you can go back to editing and adjust the format.</p><p><b>To save a story or a chapter as a draft </b>and publish it subsequently, you have to \u201cpreview\u201d your work at the bottom, then you\u2019ll have the option to \u201cSave without Posting\u201d. The draft is saved for a month on your account, in the \u201cDrafts\u201d tab on your Dashboard.</p>",

If you\u2019re not sure, start typing the name and look at the automatic entries.</p><p>For example, let\u2019s say I\u2019m posting a Dorian/Cullen in DAI, I\u2019ll do \u201cDragon Age: Inquisition\u201d, \u201cDragon Age (Video Games)\u201d, and \u201cDragon Age - All Media Types\u201d. </p><p>If I was to publish something on characters from two different movies but in the same universe, like a Thor/Steve from the MCU, I would insert the two movies on top of the universe base tags.</p><p>For an AU of another media, for example a Pirates of the Caribbean AU with Tony as Jack Sparrow and Steve as Elizabeth, I wouldn\u2019t add the PotC fandom, just the Marvel one.</p><p>If it\u2019s a crossover, I tag the two fandoms. Again, this is a personal preference, you could add the two fandoms with an AU, but while it could bring you more visibility, it could be confusing for the readers. </p><p><br></p><blockquote><p><b>Categories</b></p></blockquote><p>The easiest tag imo, pretty self-explanatory. If it\u2019s more than two persons, it\u2019s automatically multi. This refers only to the main relationship of the story, and if there\u2019s none, it\u2019s \u201cGen\u201d. I never used \u201cOther\u201d, so I don\u2019t know about that one.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p><b>\tRelationships</b></p></blockquote><p>The main relationship of the story.</p><p>For polyamorous relationships, first add the full relationship, then combinations of them for more visibility. For example, that\u2019d be \u201cSteve/Tony/Bucky\u201d, then \u201cSteve/Tony\u201d, \u201cSteve/Bucky\u201d and \u201cTony/Bucky\u201d. That way the main relationship is first but your story is shown in the three others pairings. </p><p>If there\u2019s minor relationships, there\u2019s a \u201cMinor or Background Relationship(s)\u201d tag. Depending of the importance of those minor relationships, and if they influence the flow of the story, I would also tag those relationships. If it\u2019s mentioned for two lines, don\u2019t tag it. If it\u2019s been added for diversity, don\u2019t tag it. Don\u2019t tag minor rarepairs for the sake of your story showing in the tag, that gives false hope and is just annoying. </p><p><br></p><blockquote><p><b>\tCharacters</b></p></blockquote><p>Always tag the characters of your relationship(s) first, then everyone that influences your story. If the person is in there for two lines, depending of the length of your story, don\u2019t tag them.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p><b>Additional Tags</b></p></blockquote><p>I think that\u2019s the part people have the most difficulty with. Some don\u2019t tag enough, some tag too much. I personally think there\u2019s a good balance to have so the overall amount of tags doesn\u2019t take more space than the summary.

Angst, hurt/comfort, fluff, bad ending, angst with happy ending, fluff and smut, etc.</p><p>If it\u2019s a <b>PWP </b>or the story has <b>smut</b>, tag with whatever happens: Anal Sex, Rimming, Blow Job, Size Kink, Top!X, Bottom!Y, etc. Kinks are pretty important. Also \u201cPWP\u201d, \u201cPorn with Feelings\u201d, etc. </p><p>Also tag your <b>tropes</b>! Sharing body warmth, Slow burn, Friends to lovers, Enemies to lovers, Pretending to be a Couple, Soulmate, Fuck or Die, 5+1, and so on. Those are always fun.</p><p>Type the main characters\u2019 names and look up the suggestions, those can always be fun to add or give you other ideas. </p><p>Add the <b>triggers </b>too, like \u201cMajor Character Death\u201d, \u201cRape/Non-Con\u201d, etc. and there\u2019s also one for \u201cAdditional Warnings In Author\u2019s Note\u201c.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>PREFACE</b></h2><p>Thus starts the part where we cry a little while writing it.</p><blockquote><p><b>Work Title</b></p></blockquote><p>Either a poetic cute quote of your story or lyrics, I guess?

Or canon violence. </p><p>\n\n<b>Mature </b>\n\nis implicit sex, more descriptive violence. I personally either use either teen and up or explicit, rarely mature. I think some people use this rating when there\u2019s a trigger warning, like rape/non-con or major character death.</p><p>\n\n<b>Explicit </b>\n\nis explicit description of sex, violence, torture, gore, etc.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p><b>Archive Warnings</b></p></blockquote><p>Pretty self-explanatory, but I\u2019ll add the in-depth explanations from AO3.</p><p>\n\n<b>Choose Not To Use Archive Warnings</b>\n\n<br></p><p>Use this if you don\u2019t want to warn for anything.

Exactly where to draw the line is your call.</p><p>\n\n<b>Major Character Death</b> \n\n<br></p><p>Please use your best judgment about who counts as a major character.</p><p>\n\n<b>No Archive Warnings Apply</b>\n\n<br></p><p>Use this if the Archive warnings don\u2019t apply to your content. (In other words, if it contains no graphic depictions of violence, major character death, rape/non-con, or underage sexual activity.)</p><p>\n\n<b>Rape/Non-Con</b>\n\n<br></p><p>This is your call. If you think your content may be seen as containing non-consensual sexual activity, but you don\u2019t feel like using this warning or you\u2019re not sure if you should, you always have the option of using \u201cChoose Not to Use Archive Warnings\u201d instead.</p><p>\n\n<b>Underage</b>\n\n<br></p><p>This is for descriptions or depictions of sexual activity by characters under the age of eighteen. (This doesn\u2019t include dating activity like kissing or vague references with no actual description or depiction.) This warning generally applies to humans; if you are creating a pornographic work about space aliens who only live for a month or thousand-year-old vampires with twelve-year-old bodies, please just use your best judgment.

Think like a TV show, what rating would they give your story?</p><p>\n\n<b>General Archives</b>\n\nis like a meet-cute thing, nothing much action-wise happens, and/or it&rsquo;s mostly conversation. </p><p>\n\n<b>Teen and Up </b>\n\nwould be kiss and maybe some heavy petting? Or canon violence. </p><p>\n\n<b>Mature </b>\n\nis implicit sex, more descriptive violence. I personally either use either teen and up or explicit, rarely mature. I think some people use this rating when there&rsquo;s a trigger warning, like rape/non-con or major character death.</p><p>\n\n<b>Explicit </b>\n\nis explicit description of sex, violence, torture, gore, etc.</p><p><br /></p><blockquote><p><b>Archive Warnings</b></p></blockquote><p>Pretty self-explanatory, but I&rsquo;ll add the in-depth explanations from AO3.</p><p>\n\n<b>Choose Not To Use Archive Warnings</b>\n\n<br /></p><p>Use this if you don&rsquo;t want to warn for anything. You may also choose this option if you don&rsquo;t know what you should warn for; if you don&rsquo;t like warning for certain topics or warnings in general; if you want to avoid some spoilers, but not others; etc.</p><p>\n\n<b>Graphic Depictions Of Violence</b>\n\n<br /></p><p>This is for gory, graphic, explicitly described violence. Exactly where to draw the line is your call.</p><p>\n\n<b>Major Character Death</b> \n\n<br /></p><p>Please use your best judgment about who counts as a major character.</p><p>\n\n<b>No Archive Warnings Apply</b>\n\n<br /></p><p>Use this if the Archive warnings don&rsquo;t apply to your content. (In other words, if it contains no graphic depictions of violence, major character death, rape/non-con, or underage sexual activity.)</p><p>\n\n<b>Rape/Non-Con</b>\n\n<br /></p><p>This is your call. If you think your content may be seen as containing non-consensual sexual activity, but you don&rsquo;t feel like using this warning or you&rsquo;re not sure if you should, you always have the option of using &ldquo;Choose Not to Use Archive Warnings&rdquo; instead.</p><p>\n\n<b>Underage</b>\n\n<br /></p><p>This is for descriptions or depictions of sexual activity by characters under the age of eighteen. (This doesn&rsquo;t include dating activity like kissing or vague references with no actual description or depiction.) This warning generally applies to humans; if you are creating a pornographic work about space aliens who only live for a month or thousand-year-old vampires with twelve-year-old bodies, please just use your best judgment. You are always free to specify characters&rsquo; ages or to use &ldquo;Choose Not to Use Archive Warnings&rdquo;.</p><p><br /></p><blockquote><p><b>Fandoms</b></p></blockquote><p>So you want to put more than less, and the more specific you go, the better. Don&rsquo;t just use &ldquo;All Media Types&rdquo;, use the specific video game/movie as well. If you&rsquo;re not sure, start typing the name and look at the automatic entries.</p><p>For example, let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m posting a Dorian/Cullen in DAI, I&rsquo;ll do &ldquo;Dragon Age: Inquisition&rdquo;, &ldquo;Dragon Age (Video Games)&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Dragon Age - All Media Types&rdquo;. </p><p>If I was to publish something on characters from two different movies but in the same universe, like a Thor/Steve from the MCU, I would insert the two movies on top of the universe base tags.</p><p>For an AU of another media, for example a Pirates of the Caribbean AU with Tony as Jack Sparrow and Steve as Elizabeth, I wouldn&rsquo;t add the PotC fandom, just the Marvel one.</p><p>If it&rsquo;s a crossover, I tag the two fandoms. Again, this is a personal preference, you could add the two fandoms with an AU, but while it could bring you more visibility, it could be confusing for the readers. </p><p><br /></p><blockquote><p><b>Categories</b></p></blockquote><p>The easiest tag imo, pretty self-explanatory. If it&rsquo;s more than two persons, it&rsquo;s automatically multi. This refers only to the main relationship of the story, and if there&rsquo;s none, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gen&rdquo;. I never used &ldquo;Other&rdquo;, so I don&rsquo;t know about that one.</p><p><br /></p><blockquote><p><b>\tRelationships</b></p></blockquote><p>The main relationship of the story.</p><p>For polyamorous relationships, first add the full relationship, then combinations of them for more visibility. For example, that&rsquo;d be &ldquo;Steve/Tony/Bucky&rdquo;, then &ldquo;Steve/Tony&rdquo;, &ldquo;Steve/Bucky&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tony/Bucky&rdquo;. That way the main relationship is first but your story is shown in the three others pairings. </p><p>If there&rsquo;s minor relationships, there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;Minor or Background Relationship(s)&rdquo; tag. Depending of the importance of those minor relationships, and if they influence the flow of the story, I would also tag those relationships. If it&rsquo;s mentioned for two lines, don&rsquo;t tag it. If it&rsquo;s been added for diversity, don&rsquo;t tag it. Don&rsquo;t tag minor rarepairs for the sake of your story showing in the tag, that gives false hope and is just annoying. </p><p><br /></p><blockquote><p><b>\tCharacters</b></p></blockquote><p>Always tag the characters of your relationship(s) first, then everyone that influences your story. If the person is in there for two lines, depending of the length of your story, don&rsquo;t tag them.</p><p><br /></p><blockquote><p><b>Additional Tags</b></p></blockquote><p>I think that&rsquo;s the part people have the most difficulty with. Some don&rsquo;t tag enough, some tag too much. I personally think there&rsquo;s a good balance to have so the overall amount of tags doesn&rsquo;t take more space than the summary. Add tags that characterizes your story and also any trigger warnings.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Suggestions/automatic entries</b> for this part are of a great help, and you can always come back later when you get a new tag idea.</p><p>First I&rsquo;ll tag if it&rsquo;s an AU with &ldquo;<b>Alternative Universe</b>&rdquo; + whatever that AU might be, look up the suggestions because yours might be in here, like &ldquo;Alternative Universe - Canon Divergence&rdquo;, etc.</p><p>Tag the <b>overall mood</b> of the fic. Angst, hurt/comfort, fluff, bad ending, angst with happy ending, fluff and smut, etc.</p><p>If it&rsquo;s a <b>PWP </b>or the story has <b>smut</b>, tag with whatever happens: Anal Sex, Rimming, Blow Job, Size Kink, Top!X, Bottom!Y, etc. Kinks are pretty important. Also &ldquo;PWP&rdquo;, &ldquo;Porn with Feelings&rdquo;, etc. </p><p>Also tag your <b>tropes</b>! Sharing body warmth, Slow burn, Friends to lovers, Enemies to lovers, Pretending to be a Couple, Soulmate, Fuck or Die, 5+1, and so on. Those are always fun.</p><p>Type the main characters&rsquo; names and look up the suggestions, those can always be fun to add or give you other ideas. </p><p>Add the <b>triggers </b>too, like &ldquo;Major Character Death&rdquo;, &ldquo;Rape/Non-Con&rdquo;, etc. and there&rsquo;s also one for &ldquo;Additional Warnings In Author&rsquo;s Note&ldquo;.</p><p><br /></p><h2><b>PREFACE</b></h2><p>Thus starts the part where we cry a little while writing it.</p><blockquote><p><b>Work Title</b></p></blockquote><p>Either a poetic cute quote of your story or lyrics, I guess? Make sure to credit the song in your author&rsquo;s notes if you quote it</p><p><br /></p><blockquote><p><b>Summary</b></p></blockquote><p>You can go multiple ways with this, but I find this to be the hardest for me. It can be just a quote, or a combo of a quote of the story and a short description, the quote gives an idea of the general mood of the story. </p><p>There&rsquo;s also a description + AKA summarized main topic that&rsquo;s been popular nowadays. </p><p>If it&rsquo;s a prompt fill, you can put the prompt.</p><p>There&rsquo;s really no bad summary, unless it&rsquo;s &ldquo;I&rsquo;M REALLY BAD AT SUMMARY PLEASE CLICK AND ENJOY&rdquo;. Do your best and readers who enjoy your style or the plot will click on your story.</p><p>Summary isn&rsquo;t the place for the author&rsquo;s notes either, add those underneath in &ldquo;Notes&rdquo;.</p><p><br /></p><blockquote><p><b>Notes</b></p></blockquote><p>Notes are the only option that you have to click on for the bubbles to appear. If you unclick, whatever you wrote in the bubble will be deleted, so be careful. </p><p>Generally, <b>beginning</b> notes are for warnings, shoutouts to the alpha, beta, people who helped you write the story, credits to the song or whatever/whoever inspired you, that sort of things. If the triggers contain spoilers, you can add those to the end notes and mention they&rsquo;re at the end instead. </p><p>I like to add any links to the <b>end </b>notes, such as my Tumblr or Twitter, any playlist that I listened to while writing the story, what inspired me to write a scene, etc. Also a reminder to leave kudos or comments is always nice.</p><p>\n\n<b>How to add a link: &lt;a href=&ldquo;LINK HERE&rdquo; rel=&ldquo;nofollow&rdquo;&gt;TEXT HERE&lt;/a&gt;</b></p><p><b>How to add an image: &nbsp;&lt;img src = &ldquo;IMAGE URL&rdquo; alt=&ldquo;image&rdquo; /&gt;</b>\n\n<br /></p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/201\" target=\"_blank\">Full article on how to embed media on AO3</a></p><p><br /></p><h2><b>ASSOCIATIONS</b></h2><p><b>Some things to note about this part:</b></p><p>If you&rsquo;re writing a multi-chaptered story, check the &ldquo;This work has multiple chapters&rdquo; because it&rsquo;ll show as a completed story otherwise, and nobody wants that. </p><p>If you choose to save your draft and publish it at a later date, once it&rsquo;s published, the date will be of when you saved it as a draft, so it&rsquo;s not going to show on top of the list. You have to manually &ldquo;set a different publication date&rdquo; once you&rsquo;re ready to publish.</p><p>How to save a draft is explained in &ldquo;Work Text&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><h2><b>PRIVACY</b></h2><p>You can choose to <b>show your work only to registered users</b>, that means they have to be logged in in order to see your story. </p><p>You can also d<b>isable comments from guests</b>, so people have to log in to leave you a comment. If your work is seen as &ldquo;problematic&rdquo; or you&rsquo;ve previously dealt with negative comments, this is a good way to prevent them. Assholes rarely like to sign their shit.</p><p>Last, you can choose to<b> enable moderation on the comments</b>. That means guests and logged in users can leave comments, but they won&rsquo;t appear on your story until you approve of them. It&rsquo;s a different way to filter. </p><p><br /></p><h2><b>WORK TITLE</b></h2><p>You have the options to either enter your story in HTML or in Rich Text. Paste or write in Rich Text, then I suggest Previewing. HTML code will automatically adds itself when you do that, and if you want, you can go back to editing and adjust the format.</p><p><b>To save a story or a chapter as a draft </b>and publish it subsequently, you have to &ldquo;preview&rdquo; your work at the bottom, then you&rsquo;ll have the option to &ldquo;Save without Posting&rdquo;. The draft is saved for a month on your account, in the &ldquo;Drafts&rdquo; tab on your Dashboard.</p>",
