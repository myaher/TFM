We\u2019re getting you help I promise.\u201d Tony pretty much broke the doors entering the medbay.

We\u2019ll need to take him for a CT scan as well to see whether or not it is appendicitis.\u201d The doctor told Tony who sighed and nodded his head before turning back to Peter who was still crying from being prodded by the doctor.</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Peter, look there,&rdquo; He pointed at a nurse who was holding Peter&rsquo;s hand and trying to insert a needle. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re giving you the good stuff. You&rsquo;ll feel better soon.&rdquo; Tony wiped at the boy&rsquo;s tears with his thumb. &ldquo;When was the last time he ate?&rdquo; The doctor asked Tony as the nurse told Peter was showing signs of dehydration.</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe last night.\u201d Now that Tony thought about it he hadn\u2019t seen the kid in a few days other than maybe a few minutes a day.

Then straight to CT. We might be looking at appendicitis here mister Stark and if that\u2019s the case then we\u2019ll need to get him into surgery fast.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\" style=\"\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>&ldquo;O- okay,&rdquo; Tony nodded and watched how a nurse hanged up a bag of saline to the pole and prepared another one. Peter whimpered in pain and curled on his side. A tear slid down his nose.</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Tony rubbed his back in comfort. &ldquo;Hey, hey, you&rsquo;re okay, kiddo. It&rsquo;s okay. Look, they&rsquo;re giving you the good stuff.&rdquo; &ldquo;It hurts,&rdquo; Peter sobbed. &ldquo;I know, I know you&rsquo;re in pain but hang with me for a few minutes longer.&rdquo; He brushed Peter&rsquo;s hair from his forehead and frowned. &ldquo;He feels a bit warm, is that normal?&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>\u201cA fever is normal. When it gets too high it\u2019s time to worry because that means it\u2019s burst and an infection has started in.\u201d The doctor informed him as he pressed a thermometer into Peters ear. The kid whimper and Tony shushed him gently reaching down to press a kiss to his head once the doctor was done.</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>\u201c101, this is normal, his body is fighting,&ldquo; the doctor assured Tony who nodded, his fingers caressing Peter&rsquo;s hair. &quot;I am going to inject some pain killers now, Peter,&rdquo; a nurse inserted a needle into the IV port. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll start moving you to the CT-scan. Mr Stark, do you want to accompany him?&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>As if that was even a question. Tony nodded his head and once the nurse injected the pain medication Peters cries dwindled down until they were just whimpers and the occasional sniffle. \u201cThere you go buddy. You\u2019ve got to good stuff now.\u201d Tony commented holding one of Peters hands as they rolled him down for his scan.</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\" style=\"\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s-&rdquo; Peter gulped and Tony squeezed his hand. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bearable now. I&rsquo;ll be okay.&rdquo; &ldquo;Of course you will be,&rdquo; Tony smiled. They finally reached the right room and Peter was lifted from the stretcher to the bed that led to the enormous machine. &ldquo;Peter, we can put on some music, would you like that?&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\" style=\"\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d His voice sounded timid and tony was quick o reassure him that he was not going to leave. \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t take more than a couple minutes Peter. \u201c Peter nodded his head at the doctors words. Tony gave his hand one last squeeze before he was being moved into the machine.</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>Peter was a champion, Tony had to admire him, the boy stayed still the entire time. The machine made a lot of noise. Finally, Peter was released. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s definitely appendicitis,&rdquo; The doctor skimmed the pictures on the Pad. &ldquo;Yeah, I could have told you that,&rdquo; Tony grit his teeth. &ldquo;Seriously, why waste so much time?&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\" style=\"\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>\u201cWe had to make sure mr. stark that it wasn\u2019t anything else. No one would have appreciated us going in cutting him open if we didn\u2019t have to. Right?\u201d Tony huffed and nodded his head before urging them to get him to surgery fast.</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>Tony helped Peter get out of his pajamas and settle into the hospital bed with a thin blanket. &ldquo;I want to stay with him till you put him under,&rdquo; Tony told the doctor as they started walking down the corridor to reach the operation theater. Everything was set up, surgeon had been called and the only thing missing was the patient.</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>The doctor put up no arguments not like Tony would have cared. Once they reached the operating room Tony personally lifted Peter up into his arms and settled him down onto the operating bed. \u201cMister Stark?\u201d Peters scared voice called out for him as the staff started to surround him taping stuff to his chest and strapping his arms down to the side.</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>&ldquo;Easy,&rdquo; Tony crouched to eye-level with the kid and stroked his hair. &ldquo;Ignore everything around you. Just focus on me, okay?&rdquo; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just setting up some monitors, Peter,&rdquo; The surgeon came in and smiled at the boy. &ldquo;This one measures your pulse, this oxygen levels.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do I need a ventilator?&rdquo; Peter asked timidly.</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>\u201cWell put a tube down your throat once the anesthesia kicks in but take it out after the surgery is over and before you wake up bud. So you\u2019ll never notice it at all.\u201d The surgeon explained as gently as possible.

Tony had coffee, tried to read some magazines, he could have done some work but his Pad and phone were at his room and there was no way he was leaving MedBay until Peter woke up. Who knew what could happen during the time? The kid could have a heart failure or the nurses needed to ask Tony some questions about Peter&rsquo;s physiology, allergies- He had not told the doctor Peter was allergic mint. Even traces of it and Peter&rsquo;s skin got a rash</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>It was about an hour after the surgery started that one of the nurses approached Tony in he waiting room and he immediately stood up. \u201cHe\u2019s doing great. Appendix was nearly rupturing but we got in time. If you want you can follow me and we can go to the recovery area. He\u2019s about to start waking up from the anesthesia.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\" style=\"\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>Tony could feel a real, relieved smile and he thanked the nurse multiple times. His steps were light as he followed the woman and did not pay attention to where they were going. He was making a list in his mind, all the things Peter might need or want while in bed rest, he had to call May and tell her how the surgery went, inform Pepper he would have to take time off work to look after the kid.</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>Tony had finished his list by the time they reached the recovery area. The nurse directed him to the only bed at the moment and Tony rushed over to Peters side immediately. True to the nurses word the boy was just starting to stir.</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>&ldquo;He might be groggy and confused at first but that is normal,&rdquo; Nurse told Tony. &ldquo;Just keep him calm. If he is thirsty, give him some ice chips. If he is in pain, push on the morphine pump once, not more without consulting the doctor first.&rdquo; Tony nodded at the instructions, rubbing Peter&rsquo;s arm over the thin blanket. He needed to get the boy a thicker blanket, he must be freezing</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>He asked the nurse to get a warm blanket for his kid and when she returned with it a few minutes later he gently tucked it around Peter leaning over to gently stroke his hair once he was tucked in. That small touch had Peter fluttering his eyes open and Tony encouraged him \u201cCome on kiddo. Time to open your eyes.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>Peter kicked slightly and moaned with a grimace. Tony stroked his cheek. &ldquo;Are you in pain?&rdquo; Peter sniffed and nodded. &ldquo;Okay, kiddo,&rdquo; Tony found the pump and pressed it once. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s must be your metabolism, not to mention you are one organ lighter.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>Peters eyes widened with fear probably thinking he had one or both his kidneys removed. Tony couldn\u2019t help but laught but quickly calmed the kid down. \u201cYour appendix buddy. Remember? It was just about to burst but we got it out and you\u2019re gonna be good as new in a couple days.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Peter muttered and frowned. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; Tony shook his head and tucked the blanket tighter around the child. &ldquo;Your stomach hurt.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; &ldquo;You okay now?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Peter smiled, all loopy and out of it. &ldquo;Tummy well, not a bitch.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>Tony couldn\u2019t help but laugh especially since Peter never really cursed that much around him so hearing this innocent kid swear was funnier than it ought to be. Tony took a seat next to the bed but reach over to continue smoothing Peters hair back offering whatever comfort he could.</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>\u201cYou thirsty? I can get you some icechips if you are.&ldquo; Peter shook his head and tried to stretch but both pain in his stomach stopped him. &quot;Nope, none of that. You need to lay low and rest. Your body went through quite an ordeal.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>Peter sighed. He was alert enough now to begin being tired of having to lay still and cooped up. Tony saw this coming and he was quick to dostract the kid. \u201cHey bud. Let\u2019s watch a movie in the meanwhile huh?\u201d Peter shook his head a pout forming \u201cI want my bed. I want to leave right now.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, no can do,&rdquo; Tony shook his head. &ldquo;You need to stay here for at least a day for observation.&rdquo; Peter kicked his leg. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; &ldquo;And I am so glad for it but you need to rest. Now, which Harry Potter should we watch?</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>\u201cNone of them.\u201d Peter whined his face scrunching up. He huffed trying to sit up because he was tired of laying down but only for his side to shoot up in pain. Tony quickly pushed him back down onto the bed scolding him \u201cYou need to be careful Peter!<br/></p><p>TBC&hellip;maybe?? :)</p><p>-wordscorrupt</p>",

Even traces of it and Peter\u2019s skin got a rash</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>It was about an hour after the surgery started that one of the nurses approached Tony in he waiting room and he immediately stood up. \u201cHe\u2019s doing great. Appendix was nearly rupturing but we got in time. If you want you can follow me and we can go to the recovery area. He\u2019s about to start waking up from the anesthesia.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\" style=\"\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>Tony could feel a real, relieved smile and he thanked the nurse multiple times. His steps were light as he followed the woman and did not pay attention to where they were going. He was making a list in his mind, all the things Peter might need or want while in bed rest, he had to call May and tell her how the surgery went, inform Pepper he would have to take time off work to look after the kid.</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>Tony had finished his list by the time they reached the recovery area. The nurse directed him to the only bed at the moment and Tony rushed over to Peters side immediately. True to the nurses word the boy was just starting to stir.</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>\u201cHe might be groggy and confused at first but that is normal,\u201d Nurse told Tony. \u201cJust keep him calm. If he is thirsty, give him some ice chips. If he is in pain, push on the morphine pump once, not more without consulting the doctor first.\u201d Tony nodded at the instructions, rubbing Peter\u2019s arm over the thin blanket. He needed to get the boy a thicker blanket, he must be freezing</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>He asked the nurse to get a warm blanket for his kid and when she returned with it a few minutes later he gently tucked it around Peter leaning over to gently stroke his hair once he was tucked in. That small touch had Peter fluttering his eyes open and Tony encouraged him \u201cCome on kiddo. Time to open your eyes.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>Peter kicked slightly and moaned with a grimace. Tony stroked his cheek. \u201cAre you in pain?\u201d Peter sniffed and nodded. \u201cOkay, kiddo,\u201d Tony found the pump and pressed it once. \u201cIt\u2019s must be your metabolism, not to mention you are one organ lighter.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>Peters eyes widened with fear probably thinking he had one or both his kidneys removed. Tony couldn\u2019t help but laught but quickly calmed the kid down. \u201cYour appendix buddy. Remember? It was just about to burst but we got it out and you\u2019re gonna be good as new in a couple days.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Peter muttered and frowned. \u201cWhat?\u201d Tony shook his head and tucked the blanket tighter around the child. \u201cYour stomach hurt.\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cYou okay now?\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d Peter smiled, all loopy and out of it. \u201cTummy well, not a bitch.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>Tony couldn\u2019t help but laugh especially since Peter never really cursed that much around him so hearing this innocent kid swear was funnier than it ought to be. Tony took a seat next to the bed but reach over to continue smoothing Peters hair back offering whatever comfort he could.</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>\u201cYou thirsty? I can get you some icechips if you are.\u201c Peter shook his head and tried to stretch but both pain in his stomach stopped him. \"Nope, none of that. You need to lay low and rest. Your body went through quite an ordeal.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>Peter sighed. He was alert enough now to begin being tired of having to lay still and cooped up. Tony saw this coming and he was quick to dostract the kid. \u201cHey bud. Let\u2019s watch a movie in the meanwhile huh?\u201d Peter shook his head a pout forming \u201cI want my bed. I want to leave right now.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>\u201cSorry, no can do,\u201d Tony shook his head. \u201cYou need to stay here for at least a day for observation.\u201d Peter kicked his leg. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d \u201cAnd I am so glad for it but you need to rest. Now, which Harry Potter should we watch?</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>\u201cNone of them.\u201d Peter whined his face scrunching up. He huffed trying to sit up because he was tired of laying down but only for his side to shoot up in pain. Tony quickly pushed him back down onto the bed scolding him \u201cYou need to be careful Peter!<br></p><p>TBC\u2026maybe?? :)</p><p>-wordscorrupt</p>",

But it still ends up with Peter crying in his shoulder. \u201cSshhh\u201d Tony presses a kiss to Peters head before starting the walk down to the medbay having already ordered Friday to notify the doctors down there that they were coming.</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>\"It hurts,\u201d Peter whined and sobbed. \u201cIt hurts so bad!\u201d \u201cI know, kiddo,\u201d Tony sighed as Peter clutched him tighter. \u201cJust be brave for me.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d The boy cried. \u201cHurts, it hurts, Tony, help, hurts!\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>\u201cI know kiddo.

You\u2019ll feel better soon.\u201d Tony wiped at the boy\u2019s tears with his thumb. \u201cWhen was the last time he ate?\u201d The doctor asked Tony as the nurse told Peter was showing signs of dehydration.</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe last night.\u201d Now that Tony thought about it he hadn\u2019t seen the kid in a few days other than maybe a few minutes a day.

Peter whimpered in pain and curled on his side.

When it gets too high it\u2019s time to worry because that means it\u2019s burst and an infection has started in.\u201d The doctor informed him as he pressed a thermometer into Peters ear. The kid whimper and Tony shushed him gently reaching down to press a kiss to his head once the doctor was done.</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>\u201c101, this is normal, his body is fighting,\u201c the doctor assured Tony who nodded, his fingers caressing Peter\u2019s hair. \"I am going to inject some pain killers now, Peter,\u201d a nurse inserted a needle into the IV port. \u201cWe\u2019ll start moving you to the CT-scan.

Tony nodded his head and once the nurse injected the pain medication Peters cries dwindled down until they were just whimpers and the occasional sniffle. \u201cThere you go buddy. You\u2019ve got to good stuff now.\u201d Tony commented holding one of Peters hands as they rolled him down for his scan.</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\" style=\"\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s-\u201d Peter gulped and Tony squeezed his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s bearable now. I\u2019ll be okay.\u201d \u201cOf course you will be,\u201d Tony smiled. They finally reached the right room and Peter was lifted from the stretcher to the bed that led to the enormous machine. \u201cPeter, we can put on some music, would you like that?\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\" style=\"\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d His voice sounded timid and tony was quick o reassure him that he was not going to leave. \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t take more than a couple minutes Peter. \u201c Peter nodded his head at the doctors words.

Once they reached the operating room Tony personally lifted Peter up into his arms and settled him down onto the operating bed. \u201cMister Stark?\u201d Peters scared voice called out for him as the staff started to surround him taping stuff to his chest and strapping his arms down to the side.</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d Tony crouched to eye-level with the kid and stroked his hair. \u201cIgnore everything around you. Just focus on me, okay?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re just setting up some monitors, Peter,\u201d The surgeon came in and smiled at the boy. \u201cThis one measures your pulse, this oxygen levels.\u201d \u201cDo I need a ventilator?\u201d Peter asked timidly.</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>\u201cWell put a tube down your throat once the anesthesia kicks in but take it out after the surgery is over and before you wake up bud. So you\u2019ll never notice it at all.\u201d The surgeon explained as gently as possible. Peters eyes still welled up with tears tonight and he looked up Towards his mentor.</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s not nearly as scary as it sounds,\u201d Tony comforted the boy. \u201cYour throat might be a little sore afterwards but hey, nothing some ice cream won\u2019t cure!\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>Peter managed a little smile at that and nodded his head.

Count to ten,\u201d He pressed the mask on Peter\u2019s face while his other hand caressed the boy\u2019s hair.\u201c Smells funny,\u201d Peter muttered and blinked slowly. His chest moved up and down.

He set his hand on Peter\u2019s chest, finger tapping in rhythm with the boy\u2019s pulse and measuring how deep breaths he took.\u00a0</p><p>Have I ever told how much I love Tony calling Peter buddy? :D</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\" style=\"\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>I love all the little pet names we have tony call peter\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>Buddy always makes it feel like Peter is his special little friend, his sidekick, the one he trusts :D</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\" style=\"\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>Tony stayed as they intubated Peter, holding his breath the entire time. \u201cHe\u2019s in good hands mister Stark.

                "content": "<p>Our thoughts on this as follows!&nbsp;</p><p>He has a bad stomach ache the past couple days but maybe he just ate bad food or something.

But something was wrong because Peter could barely speak and was curled up in a Ball\"what hurts, kid? What hurts?&ldquo; Tony rubbed the boy&rsquo;s limbs, trying to locate a broken bone.</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>Peter curls up tighter and is barely able to wheeze out that his stomach hurts. \"Okay, kiddo.

We&rsquo;re going down go medbay. Can you walk or do you want me to carry you?</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>Tony helps Peter up but the second he tries to swing his legs over the bed he doubles over in pain. &ldquo;Okay kiddo. No walking for you.&rdquo; Tony picks him up ever so gently trying not to jostle him too much. But it still ends up with Peter crying in his shoulder. &ldquo;Sshhh&rdquo; Tony presses a kiss to Peters head before starting the walk down to the medbay having already ordered Friday to notify the doctors down there that they were coming.</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>\"It hurts,&rdquo; Peter whined and sobbed. &ldquo;It hurts so bad!&rdquo; &ldquo;I know, kiddo,&rdquo; Tony sighed as Peter clutched him tighter. &ldquo;Just be brave for me.&rdquo; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; The boy cried. &ldquo;Hurts, it hurts, Tony, help, hurts!&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>&ldquo;I know kiddo.

The boy cried out as soon as fingers touches his skin. &ldquo;Can you give him anything for the pain?&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try to get an IV in and get him some pain medication. We&rsquo;ll need to take him for a CT scan as well to see whether or not it is appendicitis.&rdquo; The doctor told Tony who sighed and nodded his head before turning back to Peter who was still crying from being prodded by the doctor.</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Peter, look there,&rdquo; He pointed at a nurse who was holding Peter&rsquo;s hand and trying to insert a needle. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re giving you the good stuff. You&rsquo;ll feel better soon.&rdquo; Tony wiped at the boy&rsquo;s tears with his thumb. &ldquo;When was the last time he ate?&rdquo; The doctor asked Tony as the nurse told Peter was showing signs of dehydration.</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe last night.&rdquo; Now that Tony thought about it he hadn&rsquo;t seen the kid in a few days other than maybe a few minutes a day. He was rushing to get the latest upgrades done on the teams weapons and his mind had drifted away from the mid</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get him set up with fluids and pain meds. Then straight to CT. We might be looking at appendicitis here mister Stark and if that&rsquo;s the case then we&rsquo;ll need to get him into surgery fast.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>&ldquo;O- okay,&rdquo; Tony nodded and watched how a nurse hanged up a bag of saline to the pole and prepared another one. Peter whimpered in pain and curled on his side. A tear slid down his nose.</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Tony rubbed his back in comfort. &ldquo;Hey, hey, you&rsquo;re okay, kiddo. It&rsquo;s okay. Look, they&rsquo;re giving you the good stuff.&rdquo; &ldquo;It hurts,&rdquo; Peter sobbed. &ldquo;I know, I know you&rsquo;re in pain but hang with me for a few minutes longer.&rdquo; He brushed Peter&rsquo;s hair from his forehead and frowned. &ldquo;He feels a bit warm, is that normal?&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>&ldquo;A fever is normal. When it gets too high it&rsquo;s time to worry because that means it&rsquo;s burst and an infection has started in.&rdquo; The doctor informed him as he pressed a thermometer into Peters ear. The kid whimper and Tony shushed him gently reaching down to press a kiss to his head once the doctor was done.</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>&ldquo;101, this is normal, his body is fighting,&ldquo; the doctor assured Tony who nodded, his fingers caressing Peter&rsquo;s hair. \"I am going to inject some pain killers now, Peter,&rdquo; a nurse inserted a needle into the IV port. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll start moving you to the CT-scan. Mr Stark, do you want to accompany him?&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>As if that was even a question. Tony nodded his head and once the nurse injected the pain medication Peters cries dwindled down until they were just whimpers and the occasional sniffle. &ldquo;There you go buddy. You&rsquo;ve got to good stuff now.&rdquo; Tony commented holding one of Peters hands as they rolled him down for his scan.</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s-&rdquo; Peter gulped and Tony squeezed his hand. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bearable now. I&rsquo;ll be okay.&rdquo; &ldquo;Of course you will be,&rdquo; Tony smiled. They finally reached the right room and Peter was lifted from the stretcher to the bed that led to the enormous machine. &ldquo;Peter, we can put on some music, would you like that?&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; His voice sounded timid and tony was quick o reassure him that he was not going to leave. &ldquo;This shouldn&rsquo;t take more than a couple minutes Peter. &ldquo; Peter nodded his head at the doctors words. Tony gave his hand one last squeeze before he was being moved into the machine.</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>Peter was a champion, Tony had to admire him, the boy stayed still the entire time. The machine made a lot of noise. Finally, Peter was released. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s definitely appendicitis,&rdquo; The doctor skimmed the pictures on the Pad. &ldquo;Yeah, I could have told you that,&rdquo; Tony grit his teeth. &ldquo;Seriously, why waste so much time?&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>&ldquo;We had to make sure mr. stark that it wasn&rsquo;t anything else. No one would have appreciated us going in cutting him open if we didn&rsquo;t have to.

Everything was set up, surgeon had been called and the only thing missing was the patient.</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>The doctor put up no arguments not like Tony would have cared. Once they reached the operating room Tony personally lifted Peter up into his arms and settled him down onto the operating bed. &ldquo;Mister Stark?&rdquo; Peters scared voice called out for him as the staff started to surround him taping stuff to his chest and strapping his arms down to the side.</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>&ldquo;Easy,&rdquo; Tony crouched to eye-level with the kid and stroked his hair. &ldquo;Ignore everything around you. Just focus on me, okay?&rdquo; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just setting up some monitors, Peter,&rdquo; The surgeon came in and smiled at the boy. &ldquo;This one measures your pulse, this oxygen levels.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do I need a ventilator?&rdquo; Peter asked timidly.</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>&ldquo;Well put a tube down your throat once the anesthesia kicks in but take it out after the surgery is over and before you wake up bud. So you&rsquo;ll never notice it at all.&rdquo; The surgeon explained as gently as possible. Peters eyes still welled up with tears tonight and he looked up Towards his mentor.</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, it&rsquo;s not nearly as scary as it sounds,&rdquo; Tony comforted the boy. &ldquo;Your throat might be a little sore afterwards but hey, nothing some ice cream won&rsquo;t cure!&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>Peter managed a little smile at that and nodded his head. Tony saw one of the surgeons come closer with the mask and he took a deep breath. &ldquo;Alright bud. Just have to breathe nice and deep for the doctor now and the next time you wake up I&rsquo;ll be right there.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>Peter panicked once the mask was set over his face. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he moaned and tried to turn away. &ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; Tony grabbed the mask and hovered it over the boy&rsquo;s mouth and nose. &ldquo;Just keep your eyes on me, okay. Count to ten,&rdquo; He pressed the mask on Peter&rsquo;s face while his other hand caressed the boy&rsquo;s hair.&ldquo; Smells funny,&rdquo; Peter muttered and blinked slowly. His chest moved up and down. The boy gulped and paled. &ldquo;Feel sick.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>&ldquo;Shhh, kiddo. That&rsquo;s just the medicine working now. Don&rsquo;t fight it buddy.&rdquo; Tony cooed still keeping the mask pressed against Peters face with the other ran through his hair. Peter was still looking up at him but slowly his eyes started to drift shut until he was completely out of it.</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>&ldquo;I think he is asleep,&rdquo; Tony whispered to the surgeon although there was no danger of Peter hearing them. &ldquo;Good, keep the mask on for a little while longer, maybe pull his head back a little so his airways stay open.&rdquo; Tony obeyed the instructions. He set his hand on Peter&rsquo;s chest, finger tapping in rhythm with the boy&rsquo;s pulse and measuring how deep breaths he took.&nbsp;</p><p>Have I ever told how much I love Tony calling Peter buddy? :D</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>I love all the little pet names we have tony call peter&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://irondadgroupie.tumblr.com/\">irondadgroupie</a></p><p>Buddy always makes it feel like Peter is his special little friend, his sidekick, the one he trusts :D</p><p><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://wordscorrupt.tumblr.com/\">wordscorrupt</a></p><p>Tony stayed as they intubated Peter, holding his breath the entire time. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in good hands mister Stark.

Half a second later, a boy burst into the room.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Mr Stark!&rdquo; He exclaimed, looking around for him. He spotted the man, who was huddled in a corner of the room. Ignoring Steve, he immediately ran towards Tony. He dropped in front of him and whispered softly &ldquo;Mr Stark. It&rsquo;s me, Peter.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>Tony was still shaking. He noticed that he somehow ended up huddled in a corner. But that didn&rsquo;t matter. What mattered was the boy in front of him, trying to talk with him.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Hey man.

Even though he knew he could break out of it, he also knew his mentor needed the comfort.<br/></p><p>Tony saw the boy getting clearer. &ldquo;Kid?&rdquo;<br/></p><p>Peer nodded. &ldquo;Yup. That&rsquo;s me. You back with us?&rdquo;<br/></p><p>There was no answer from Tony. Instead, he tugged Peter towards him, pulling him into a hug. The boy climbed into his lap and Tony hugged him even closer.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay Tony. Everything&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>Tony didn&rsquo;t answer him. He only hugged the boy, trying to ground himself.<br/></p><p>Peter grabbed Tony&rsquo;s hand and put it on his wrist, the man&rsquo;s fingers on his pulse. &ldquo;Feel my pulse Tony? Focus on that. Focus on my pulse.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>Tony could only nod.</p><p>And Steve stood on the side looking at the pair of them and wondering what the hell is going on.</p>",
