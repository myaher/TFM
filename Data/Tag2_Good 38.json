                "content": "<p>Okay but Crowley takes up painting in retirement. Like, imagine he just ends up binge watching Bob Ross on Netflix and then suddenly bursts into Aziraphale&rsquo;s study screaming,&nbsp;&ldquo;ANGEL, I MUST PAINT!&rdquo;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t use any of his&nbsp;&ldquo;magic&rdquo; either, he practices because it&rsquo;s what Bob Ross would have wanted!!</p><p>Yeah, so he fucks up! So what if he smears paint everywhere, on his face, his clothes, Azirphale&rsquo;s clothes (&rdquo;Sorry, love.&rdquo;)? Who cares that he&rsquo;s going through canvasses and sketch pads full of rough drawings? Yeah, he collects palettes. Of course he experiments with watercolors and oil paints!</p><p>Crowley listens to his soul music collection while he paints, too. Blares it the hell up until Aziraphale complains that he can&rsquo;t concentrate on reading. It&rsquo;s cool though because Adam tells him about noise-cancelling headphones and Aziraphale gets to listen to his classical music and read in peace while Sam and Dave play in Crowley&rsquo;s studio.</p><p>Months go by, and every day Crowley wakes up, kisses his husband good morning, gets a GIANT cup of coffee and goes back to painting. He emerges only to have his meals with Aziraphale, and if he can twist his arm a bit, his angel takes him for a walk because&nbsp;&ldquo;Some air would do you good, dear, and perhaps you&rsquo;ll be inspired.&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale buys him books to study and brings him hot cocoa or lemonade to his studio where he has to be careful not to trip on the old bed sheets that are lining the floor. Whenever he brings him refreshments, Crowley quickly throws a sheet over his work, refusing to let his angel see his work in progress. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not quite a painting yet, love,&rdquo; he explains.<br /></p><p>Aziraphale only laughs. &ldquo;Well, do let me know when it&rsquo;s ready.&rdquo;</p><p>One afternoon, Crowley comes into the den, where Aziraphale is reading. He is in his speckled painting smock and his hair is disheveled.</p><p>&ldquo;Angel?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes, dearest?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ready.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What is?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;My painting. You can see it now if you&rsquo;d like.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Aziraphale instantly closes his book and gives him a grin.&nbsp;&ldquo;Of course I want to see it!&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley winces and smirks.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not very good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it is, love,&rdquo; his angel says.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Crowley sighs. &ldquo;Come on, then. Be gentle.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so dramatic.&rdquo; Aziraphale grasps his hand and follows him to the studio.</p><p>He pauses in the door and he softly gasps.</p><p>A huge canvas is resting on the easel and it&rsquo;s an exquisite rendition of a garden.</p><p>No, wait a moment&hellip;it&rsquo;s <i>the </i>Garden.</p><p>Aziraphale steps closer to it.&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh&hellip;darling.&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s just as he remembered it: lush trees of all sorts, animals grazing and frolicking, and fruit-bearing bushes scattered here and there. There was a glorious stream running through the Garden and he could make out the silhouette of a large shoal of fish under the surface, and birds of all kinds in a bright blue sky.</p><p>&ldquo;Crowley&hellip;this is&hellip;marvelous.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Angel&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;ll never believe me, but love, this is&hellip;beautiful.

Here it goes. </p><p>The essay started forming in my head when I wondered why among all my fandoms that get new content this year, Good Omens is the thing I anticipate the most. By far. So of course I started analyzing what made it so special to me and what made this story stand out so much compared to other stories I\u2019ve been following and getting excited about lately.</p><p>First thing I realised was, Good Omens is a story which contains maybe 10% of plot in an ocean of plot-driven stories. Every subplot can be reduced to a one-sentence-long summary. An angel and a demon try to prevent the Apocalypse, rather badly. A descendant of a witch tries to prevent it too, but loses a book of prophecies. The Antichrist spends 11 years of his life not knowing he\u2019s the Antichrist and in the end refuses to start the Apocalypse. And so on. Instead of focusing on spectacular plot twists the so-called shock value, Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett decided to pack the book with brilliant language, humor, well-built characters and what\u2019s most important, complex relationships between them. Therefore, knowing literally every single plot point in Good Omens still won\u2019t spoil the enjoyment of reading it, because the plot - while being very clever - is not the most important thing in the book. Which is not to say Good Omens is boring or predictable - on the contrary. But surprises never scream to you from the book\u2019s pages, \u201cI\u2019m a plot twist! Look! Be surprised!\u201c, rather slip in naturally, in a convincing way, and are carried out incredibly smartly. Reading Good Omens, you never know what will come next, but you won\u2019t feel cheated by things happening out of the blue. There is quite a briliant method to this madnes. </p><p>The next aspect of the book that emerged from my chaotic thoughts was the characters, specifically, to no suprise of anyone reading this, Aziraphale and Crowley. Characters who stay with you long after you\u2019ve finished the book. Characters who, compared to the crowd of cool, flawlessly-looking characters I see everywhere are pretty much their exact opposite. And all I have to say in this matter boils down to one thing - Aziraphale and Crowley, unlike thousands of other fictional characters I\u2019ve seen in my life, are allowed to be genuinely, deeply human. Not the usual, although still greatly appreciated by me,\u00a0\u201cthey messed up really badly and now have to fix it\u201d or\u00a0\u201cthey have to fight their weaknesses\u201d kind of human. It goes deeper than that. Aziraphale and Crowley are allowed not to be cool, they\u2019re allowed to be awkward, embarrassing and <i>natural</i> to the extent that is very rarely seen on the screen or paper. Reading about them you\u2019re not left with the feeling that you could relate to them <i>if only [insert reasons why you can\u2019t relate to them here]</i>. No, in most cases you see yourself in both of them, in their strenghts and weaknesses and beliefs and attitude. They could be someone you meet every day, someone within the very reach of your hand.</p><p>Tying my previous points together, I\u2019d like to move on to another aspect of the book - the plot is just the canvas used as a foundation for character arcs and developing relationships between the characters. What would be the point of the Armageddon almost happening if Aziraphale and Crowley didn\u2019t tell each other, \u201cNice knowing you?\u201c What would be the point if Adam didn\u2019t choose his friends over his powers? What would be left of this scene if we stripped it from Neil and Terry\u2019s thoughts about the very core of what makes us human? In Good Omens, the most important question answered as the story goes is never \u201c<i>what?</i>\u201c. It\u2019s <i>who?</i>, it\u2019s <i>why? </i>and it\u2019s <i>what lies underneath it?</i>. No things happen just for the sake of things happening. Too often do I see creators forgetting that they\u2019re allowed not to push the plot forward all the time. Even if you only stop to make a witty joke or leave a footnote.</p><p>And the very last aspect I wanted to discuss is the book\u2019s message. Few fictional works I\u2019ve read/watched have left me feeling so comforted. Good Omens is a book which is hard to close and feel indifferently towards it, because if there\u2019s one thing it keeps telling you, it is, \u201cIsn\u2019t it wonderful to be human? Isn\u2019t it wonderful to be a part of this world and enjoy it? Isn\u2019t it the point of living your life to love, to try to do the right thing, to fail, to love books and old cars, to form unlikely friendships, and have free will, and cling to this world because it\u2019s a bloody fantastic world?\u201c This is what really stays with the reader. Great plot will leave you delighted, surprised, and amazed by the creator\u2019s brilliant imagination. A meaningful message will affect your everyday life and the way you look at yourself and how you treat other people. A true work of art crosses the border between fiction and reality to dare us to think, to wonder, to feel, and to hope.</p><p>These are the stories that never truly leave us, and Good Omens is one to me.</p><p>To finish this post - I know it was pretty chaotic, and I know I only skimmed the surface of what could have been said here, but I had quite a few things boiling in my mind that I wanted to finally put into words. Still, if you actually got here, to the end of this post, thank you so much for reading. I really appreciate that.</p>",

Instead of focusing on spectacular plot twists the so-called shock value, Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett decided to pack the book with brilliant language, humor, well-built characters and what\u2019s most important, complex relationships between them. Therefore, knowing literally every single plot point in Good Omens still won\u2019t spoil the enjoyment of reading it, because the plot - while being very clever - is not the most important thing in the book.

Be surprised!\u201c, rather slip in naturally, in a convincing way, and are carried out incredibly smartly. Reading Good Omens, you never know what will come next, but you won\u2019t feel cheated by things happening out of the blue. There is quite a briliant method to this madnes. </p><p>The next aspect of the book that emerged from my chaotic thoughts was the characters, specifically, to no suprise of anyone reading this, Aziraphale and Crowley. Characters who stay with you long after you\u2019ve finished the book. Characters who, compared to the crowd of cool, flawlessly-looking characters I see everywhere are pretty much their exact opposite. And all I have to say in this matter boils down to one thing - Aziraphale and Crowley, unlike thousands of other fictional characters I\u2019ve seen in my life, are allowed to be genuinely, deeply human. Not the usual, although still greatly appreciated by me,\u00a0\u201cthey messed up really badly and now have to fix it\u201d or\u00a0\u201cthey have to fight their weaknesses\u201d kind of human. It goes deeper than that. Aziraphale and Crowley are allowed not to be cool, they\u2019re allowed to be awkward, embarrassing and <i>natural</i> to the extent that is very rarely seen on the screen or paper. Reading about them you\u2019re not left with the feeling that you could relate to them <i>if only [insert reasons why you can\u2019t relate to them here]</i>. No, in most cases you see yourself in both of them, in their strenghts and weaknesses and beliefs and attitude. They could be someone you meet every day, someone within the very reach of your hand.</p><p>Tying my previous points together, I\u2019d like to move on to another aspect of the book - the plot is just the canvas used as a foundation for character arcs and developing relationships between the characters. What would be the point of the Armageddon almost happening if Aziraphale and Crowley didn\u2019t tell each other, \u201cNice knowing you?\u201c What would be the point if Adam didn\u2019t choose his friends over his powers? What would be left of this scene if we stripped it from Neil and Terry\u2019s thoughts about the very core of what makes us human? In Good Omens, the most important question answered as the story goes is never \u201c<i>what?</i>\u201c. It\u2019s <i>who?</i>, it\u2019s <i>why? </i>and it\u2019s <i>what lies underneath it?</i>. No things happen just for the sake of things happening. Too often do I see creators forgetting that they\u2019re allowed not to push the plot forward all the time. Even if you only stop to make a witty joke or leave a footnote.</p><p>And the very last aspect I wanted to discuss is the book\u2019s message. Few fictional works I\u2019ve read/watched have left me feeling so comforted. Good Omens is a book which is hard to close and feel indifferently towards it, because if there\u2019s one thing it keeps telling you, it is, \u201cIsn\u2019t it wonderful to be human? Isn\u2019t it wonderful to be a part of this world and enjoy it? Isn\u2019t it the point of living your life to love, to try to do the right thing, to fail, to love books and old cars, to form unlikely friendships, and have free will, and cling to this world because it\u2019s a bloody fantastic world?\u201c This is what really stays with the reader. Great plot will leave you delighted, surprised, and amazed by the creator\u2019s brilliant imagination. A meaningful message will affect your everyday life and the way you look at yourself and how you treat other people. A true work of art crosses the border between fiction and reality to dare us to think, to wonder, to feel, and to hope.</p><p>These are the stories that never truly leave us, and Good Omens is one to me.</p><p>To finish this post - I know it was pretty chaotic, and I know I only skimmed the surface of what could have been said here, but I had quite a few things boiling in my mind that I wanted to finally put into words.
