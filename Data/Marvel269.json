When there aren\u2019t screams, there\u2019s deafening silence. The rooms are supposed to be sound proof, aren\u2019t they? How loud is he screaming?</p><!-- more --><p>Steve twists and fights against his binds until his wrists are raw and he\u2019s panting hard, sweat sticking to his body. His sense of urgency and the sickening churning in his gut isn\u2019t dulled much by the drugs surging through him. They were meant for him, strong enough to make his limbs feel like gelatin and his head swim a little, even with the serum. If it\u2019s making his sense of panic dwindle any, it\u2019s still not enough. Every time a wave of drowsiness washes over him and his eyes grow heavy, vision blurring and spinning, there\u2019s another scream, piercing his ears and making him squeeze his eyes shut like it might make it stop.</p><p>There\u2019s nothing he can do from his cell, locked up like an animal and drugged into a useless mess. No one is even checking on him, opening the doors to do so much as gloat, so he has no chances to escape or even get information. All he can do is sit slumped against the table, hands chained above his head and listen to Bucky scream and scream.</p><p>Half of the time, the noises don\u2019t even sound human. They\u2019re desperate agony, no words, just screams so loud they crack and come out I\u2019m pained howls. It sounds remotely like a wounded cat Steve had found in the ally, back before the war. It\u2019s legs had been broken and all it did was make horrible, gurgling hisses and whining sounds. He\u2019d brought it back to the apartment but it died while Steve slept that night, sprawled in a cardboard box.</p><p>He grits his teeth, trying not to think about what might be happening to cause those noises. If his mind wanders, vague flashes of bloody instruments on steel tables, or purplish, misshapen limbs, would flood his head. He couldn\u2019t handle that, especially knowing there was nothing he could do from here.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t have an even remotely decent sense of time anymore, he lost that almost immediately after he lost consciousness the first time, but after what must be hours, the screaming stops. He holds his breath, waiting for another sound, and suddenly he feels desperate to hear it again, even if it\u2019s awful and pained. Knowing he was alive was better than this endless not knowing.</p><p>He hates not knowing and being so utterly helpless.</p><p>He hates that the drugs make it hard to focus.</p><p>He hates these people.</p><p>Things had been nice before, almost simple. He and Bucky had been living together again like before the war, like before Steve had lost Bucky off a train, before Steve ended up in ice, before Steve woke up and everything had been some insane, impossible loop. None of it really mattered, because Steve was back with Bucky, no matter how fucked things had been, no matter how fucked Bucky was. Really, Bucky opened up again after next to no time with Steve, and everything fell into place, into a nice and steady rhythm. They cooked together, cleaned the house from time to time, slept in the same bed with their legs tangled together and their fingers intertwined on more than one occasion.</p><p>Things were the best that they had been in a very long time, and even now, Steve can\u2019t quite grasp where they went wrong. He doesn\u2019t understand how they found their location that was constantly changing, constantly protected. He doesn\u2019t understand how these people so easily ripped them apart. He shouldn\u2019t trust anyone, he should know not to by now. he should have learnt that after S.H.I.E.L.D. but Steve never learns, apparently.</p><p>\u201cPlease, just be alive,\u201d Steve breathes, hardly even aware the words come out. His throat feels like he swallowed lava, raw and hurting and burning. His own voice sounds strange in the silent confines of the room. His ears started ringing a while ago from the heavy weight of the silence around him, his breathing feeling abnormally loud.</p><p>He passes out eventually, too tired and weak to bother fighting. He doesn\u2019t rest well, it\u2019s cramped and fitful and he wakes up every few minutes, over and over again. When he wakes up again, it\u2019s because there\u2019s a sharp pain rupturing in his neck, sharp and like ice. His body jolts and instinctively fights it before he has a chance to register what\u2019s happening, and a hand clamps down on his bicep, hard enough it\u2019s meant to hurt and steady him.</p><p>\u201cAlright, cap, calm down now, don\u2019t want you hurtin\u2019 yourself, do we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, let go,\u201d Steve spits, yanking away as best as he can. The voice is gruff and he can feel the breath of the man behind him hit his neck, he can smell the bitter whiskey.</p><p>\u201cI was just makin\u2019 sure you got your meds,\u201d he says, voice snide. \u201cNo need to be so rude.\u201d</p><p>Steve grits his teeth, a growl bubbles up in his throat. \u201cWhat are you getting out of drugging me?\u201d</p><p>The man walks to the side of Steve to dispose carelessly of the emptied syringe. He\u2019s dressed casually, in some slacks and a t-shirt, just with a lab coat thrown on over it. He has a gun strapped to his belt, too, off to the side of his hip. \u201cWe get you here, and not out there,\u201d he says, gesturing vaguely to the door. He looks bored and it pisses Steve off. Still, this is an opportunity to get information.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Bucky?\u201d Steve asks and it comes out sharp and more of a demand.</p><p>\u201cYou know where he is, Rogers,\u201d he sighs. \u201cHe\u2019s getting our special care, our very best hospitality.\u201d</p><p>The next question rolls off of Steve\u2019s tongue before he can bite it. It\u2019s a stupid question, such a stupid question, and yet, \u201cWhy are you doing this? What\u2019s the point?\u201d</p><p>He sighs. He runs a hand through his hair, it looks greasy and unkempt. \u201cCap, let\u2019s not play dumb, okay? It\u2019s not appealing on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing with Bucky?\u201d Steve grits out, the rephrasing just earns an amused chuckle from the doctor.</p><p>\u201cThe Winter Soldier is incredibly useful in both combat and in research, you know this. We can easily pick up where Hydra so pathetically left off.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s stomach somersaults. \u201cHe\u2019s not some fucking weapon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what he is, and you have the original serum, so you\u2019ll be rather useful yourself,\u201d he says, simple and matter of fact.</p><p>Steve glares at him, even when his back is turned, like he might be able to burn holes into the back of the guys head. \u201cYou know this isn\u2019t gonna work, right? Do you know how many people and how many times people have tried this shit?\u201d Steve\u2019s only half sure of his words. They were successful before, in ripping Bucky apart from the inside out. Steve couldn\u2019t help him before, either.</p><p>\u201cI suppose we\u2019ll see,\u201d he says far too smugly and places a small vile of the medicine just out of Steve\u2019s reach. \u201cNow, I must go tend to the soldier. Breaking him has been a hassle.\u201d He leaves then, briskly, before Steve can scream at him and thrash uselessly. He hears the mechanics in the door click and lock behind him.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t how it was supposed to go, and Steve feels his chest tighten. There&rsquo;s a clock ticking, invisible and in the back of Steve&rsquo;s head. Every minute he&rsquo;s stuck here, he&rsquo;s loosing his chance to get Bucky out.</p>",

None of it really mattered, because Steve was back with Bucky, no matter how fucked things had been, no matter how fucked Bucky was. Really, Bucky opened up again after next to no time with Steve, and everything fell into place, into a nice and steady rhythm. They cooked together, cleaned the house from time to time, slept in the same bed with their legs tangled together and their fingers intertwined on more than one occasion.</p><p>Things were the best that they had been in a very long time, and even now, Steve can\u2019t quite grasp where they went wrong. He doesn\u2019t understand how they found their location that was constantly changing, constantly protected. He doesn\u2019t understand how these people so easily ripped them apart. He shouldn\u2019t trust anyone, he should know not to by now. he should have learnt that after S.H.I.E.L.D. but Steve never learns, apparently.</p><p>\u201cPlease, just be alive,\u201d Steve breathes, hardly even aware the words come out. His throat feels like he swallowed lava, raw and hurting and burning. His own voice sounds strange in the silent confines of the room. His ears started ringing a while ago from the heavy weight of the silence around him, his breathing feeling abnormally loud.</p><p>He passes out eventually, too tired and weak to bother fighting. He doesn\u2019t rest well, it\u2019s cramped and fitful and he wakes up every few minutes, over and over again. When he wakes up again, it\u2019s because there\u2019s a sharp pain rupturing in his neck, sharp and like ice. His body jolts and instinctively fights it before he has a chance to register what\u2019s happening, and a hand clamps down on his bicep, hard enough it\u2019s meant to hurt and steady him.</p><p>\u201cAlright, cap, calm down now, don\u2019t want you hurtin\u2019 yourself, do we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, let go,\u201d Steve spits, yanking away as best as he can. The voice is gruff and he can feel the breath of the man behind him hit his neck, he can smell the bitter whiskey.</p><p>\u201cI was just makin\u2019 sure you got your meds,\u201d he says, voice snide. \u201cNo need to be so rude.\u201d</p><p>Steve grits his teeth, a growl bubbles up in his throat. \u201cWhat are you getting out of drugging me?\u201d</p><p>The man walks to the side of Steve to dispose carelessly of the emptied syringe. He\u2019s dressed casually, in some slacks and a t-shirt, just with a lab coat thrown on over it. He has a gun strapped to his belt, too, off to the side of his hip. \u201cWe get you here, and not out there,\u201d he says, gesturing vaguely to the door. He looks bored and it pisses Steve off. Still, this is an opportunity to get information.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Bucky?\u201d Steve asks and it comes out sharp and more of a demand.</p><p>\u201cYou know where he is, Rogers,\u201d he sighs. \u201cHe\u2019s getting our special care, our very best hospitality.\u201d</p><p>The next question rolls off of Steve\u2019s tongue before he can bite it. It\u2019s a stupid question, such a stupid question, and yet, \u201cWhy are you doing this? What\u2019s the point?\u201d</p><p>He sighs. He runs a hand through his hair, it looks greasy and unkempt. \u201cCap, let\u2019s not play dumb, okay? It\u2019s not appealing on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing with Bucky?\u201d Steve grits out, the rephrasing just earns an amused chuckle from the doctor.</p><p>\u201cThe Winter Soldier is incredibly useful in both combat and in research, you know this.

Do you know how many people and how many times people have tried this shit?\u201d Steve\u2019s only half sure of his words. They were successful before, in ripping Bucky apart from the inside out. Steve couldn\u2019t help him before, either.</p><p>\u201cI suppose we\u2019ll see,\u201d he says far too smugly and places a small vile of the medicine just out of Steve\u2019s reach. \u201cNow, I must go tend to the soldier. Breaking him has been a hassle.\u201d He leaves then, briskly, before Steve can scream at him and thrash uselessly. He hears the mechanics in the door click and lock behind him.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t how it was supposed to go, and Steve feels his chest tighten.

                "content": "<p><b>Pairing: Bucky Barnes x Steve Rogers</b></p><p><b>Warnings: Torture, non-con drug use, Kidnapping, dark themes.</b></p><p><b>&ndash;Chapter One&ndash;</b></p><p>The screams reverberate off of the stone and metal walls, nearly deafening in the narrowness of the corridors. When there aren&rsquo;t screams, there&rsquo;s deafening silence. The rooms are supposed to be sound proof, aren&rsquo;t they? How loud is he screaming?</p><p>Steve twists and fights against his binds until his wrists are raw and he&rsquo;s panting hard, sweat sticking to his body. His sense of urgency and the sickening churning in his gut isn&rsquo;t dulled much by the drugs surging through him. They were meant for him, strong enough to make his limbs feel like gelatin and his head swim a little, even with the serum. If it&rsquo;s making his sense of panic dwindle any, it&rsquo;s still not enough. Every time a wave of drowsiness washes over him and his eyes grow heavy, vision blurring and spinning, there&rsquo;s another scream, piercing his ears and making him squeeze his eyes shut like it might make it stop.</p><p>There&rsquo;s nothing he can do from his cell, locked up like an animal and drugged into a useless mess. No one is even checking on him, opening the doors to do so much as gloat, so he has no chances to escape or even get information. All he can do is sit slumped against the table, hands chained above his head and listen to Bucky scream and scream.</p><p>Half of the time, the noises don&rsquo;t even sound human. They&rsquo;re desperate agony, no words, just screams so loud they crack and come out I&rsquo;m pained howls. It sounds remotely like a wounded cat Steve had found in the ally, back before the war. It&rsquo;s legs had been broken and all it did was make horrible, gurgling hisses and whining sounds. He&rsquo;d brought it back to the apartment but it died while Steve slept that night, sprawled in a cardboard box.</p><p>He grits his teeth, trying not to think about what might be happening to cause those noises. If his mind wanders, vague flashes of bloody instruments on steel tables, or purplish, misshapen limbs, would flood his head. He couldn&rsquo;t handle that, especially knowing there was nothing he could do from here.</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t have an even remotely decent sense of time anymore, he lost that almost immediately after he lost consciousness the first time, but after what must be hours, the screaming stops. He holds his breath, waiting for another sound, and suddenly he feels desperate to hear it again, even if it&rsquo;s awful and pained. Knowing he was alive was better than this endless not knowing.</p><p>He hates not knowing and being so utterly helpless.</p><p>He hates that the drugs make it hard to focus.</p><p>He hates these people.</p><p>Things had been nice before, almost simple.
