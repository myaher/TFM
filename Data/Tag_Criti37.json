The air was heavy with steam and they could hear some quiet chatting through the walls of their spa room. \u201cI\u2019ve been dreaming of this for weeks. Everytime I had a pool of water in my shoes, everytime I scratched dried mud off my arm, I thought about this.\u201d</p><p>Caleb cleared his throat and nodded, sitting his two towels near the edge and sinking in across the from her. \u201cI\u2019m surprised no one else wanted to join.\u201d</p><p>Beau shrugged. \u201cTheir loss. This is what paradise is.\u201d She opened her eyes and looked over at him, halfway through a word that was barely formed in her mind, but paused. \u201cWhat the fuck is that?\u201d</p><p>He blinked at her in confusion. \u201cWha-What exactly are you talking about right now?\u201d</p><p>Beau pushed herself off the bench and moved towards him through the water, grabbing his arm and turning it around in her hand. \u201cThis, these bruises. Where the fuck did these come from?

I knew you were not doing it on purpose. What am I going to do, complain about a hug just because I bruise easily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! When something hurts you you\u2019re supposed to complain about it. That\u2019s why we invented the word \u2018ow\u2019. Look, will you just tell me if I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, clearly not understanding how serious she was about this, but nodded. \u201cJa, I can do that.\u201d That seemed to be the end of it.

Instead, he was interrupted from his reading only by the feeling of overwhelming tiredness in his eyes hours after he should have gone to sleep. He shuffled down the hall on his own, his arms hanging heavy at his sides.

She nodded, her shoulders tense. He reached up quickly and started pinching hard down his arm. </p><p>She reached out without thinking and grabbed his wrist. \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I bruise like a peach,\u201d he pulled up his sleeve and showed her three brand new, darkening bruises down the line of his arm. \u201cI bruise when I sit down too fast. I bruise when I hit my elbow on door frames. I wake up with bruises and I have no idea what caused them. If the choice is between having bruises and never hugging anyone again, I will choose the bruises.\u201d</p><p>She still seemed unsure. \u201cWhat if I accidentally hurt you worse? What if I break something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.

She paused and gave him a friendly punch on the shoulder. \u201cGet some fucking sleep, you nerd.\u201d Then she left him alone in the room.</p><p>He waited until she was gone to wince and rub the brand new ache on his shoulder.</p>",
