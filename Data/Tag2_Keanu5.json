They had the best brew on the block, better than all of those popular chain outlets. Busy or not, Keanu knew that he wasn\u2019t going anywhere else, he didn&rsquo;t really have any where to be soon, so he wasn\u2019t in a hurry. He pushed open the door, joining the back of the long line. The aroma of fresh coffee filled the air and all around there was people, both standing and at tables, either chatting or staring at their devices. Even he had found himself on his phone as the line moved along slowly. He wasn\u2019t really focusing on everyone around him until he noticed the couple in front of him murmuring and giggling. \u201c Its not. It can\u2019t be.\u201d The guy spoke in a hushed tone.</p><p>\u201cIt is. Look, I\u2019m telling you. What are the odd that there are two celebrities in here.\u201d She squealed quietly.\u00a0\u201cI want to talk to both of them,\u201d She grasped her boyfriend\u2019s arm. Two celebrities? What were they talking about? It was definitely unlike him, but he tore his gaze away from his phone and scanned the room, searching for a familiar face. It took a while but he eventually he did spot one. A woman, sitting at a table in the corner. She was working on her laptop, not paying any mind to her surroundings. Keanu didn\u2019t know her personally, but he knew of her, he had seen her on the internet and on the back of a few of his favorite books. Y/n Y/L/N.</p><p>As the line moved forward, he watched as a few people went up to her, and each time, she stopped her work, giving them her full attention, engaging with them like they were all old friends. Fans came up to him too, and he treated them the same, taking pictures when they asked and even signing things.</p><p>Finally, he reached the counter and gave his order to a very nervous barista who asked him to sign her cap after. He did. Not long after, he got his drink, a mocha latte. Now was his chance. He began walking to her table. The closer he got, the more excited he became. She was just sitting there, here fingers dancing across the keyboard, occasionally taking a sip from her mug. Her glasses rested on the bridge of her nose and a few stray strands of hair fell in her face. She was beautiful, the pictures he had seen of her were great, but seeing her like this, he realized that they barely did her justice.</p><p>When he reached her table, she looked up before he could announce himself. She sucked in a breath, mouth slightly agape and eyes wide. She was a writer, she knew a lot of words, but in that moment, she forgot most of them.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re&hellip;you\u2019re,\u201d That was it, that was all the words she remembered.</p><p>Keanu laughed, running a hand through his long dark hair,\u00a0\u201cYeah&hellip;and you\u2019re you&hellip;\u201d <i>Really, that was the best you could do? </i>He asked himself.</p><p>\u201cSit!\u201d She blurted out suddenly.\u00a0\u201cI mean have a seat. If you want to. You don\u2019t have to though.\u201d Y/n cleared her throat, ready to have a go at attempt number three,\u00a0\u201cWould you like to sit?\u201d Her celebrity crush had just strolled up to her at her favorite coffee shop and it was safe to say that she had been reduced to a star-struck mess.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d As soon as the words made a hurry exit off his lips, Keanu hated himself for sounding so eager. Mentally yelling at himself to get his shit together, he pulled out the empty chair and sat across from her. Y/n closed down her laptop and removed her glasses, securing them at the neck of her blouse. &ldquo;I love your work by the way. I&rsquo;ve read most of your books.\u201d</p><p>She blushed, tucking her y/h/c hair behind her ear,\u00a0\u201cThank you. I love your movies. I\u2019ve probably seen The Lake House almost a dozen times. I mean, your recent work is great too, amazing, but that one is my favorite.\u201d She shifted her gaze down to her mug, embarrassed,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry, you probably hear that kind of thing all the time.\u201d</p><p>Keanu smiled wider,\u00a0\u201cNo, its okay. Really.\u201d He sipped his coffee.\u00a0\u201cAre you working on something new?\u201d He gestured to her laptop and the little notepad that lay beside it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh. Yeah.\u201d Y/n glanced at her scribbled penmanship on the paper,\u00a0\u201cI am, sort of. Its new. I\u2019m not really sure about it yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, whatever it is, I\u2019m sure its going to be great.\u201d She blushed again and thanked him for his confidence in her. After that, it didn\u2019t take long to get past the awkwardness and they fell into easy conversation. They talked until they finished their drinks, then ordered others, then talked some more. Keanu\u2019s warm and excitable personality drew her in and Y/n was refreshingly genuine and so much of an all round delight that he felt like he could spend the entire day with her. Of course, that was not possible as she informed him that she had a late lunch meeting with her editor. So, reluctantly, they parted ways after exchanging numbers and promises that they would meet again, this time on purpose, for a planned date. \u00a0<br/></p>",

He did. Not long after, he got his drink, a mocha latte. Now was his chance. He began walking to her table. The closer he got, the more excited he became. She was just sitting there, here fingers dancing across the keyboard, occasionally taking a sip from her mug. Her glasses rested on the bridge of her nose and a few stray strands of hair fell in her face. She was beautiful, the pictures he had seen of her were great, but seeing her like this, he realized that they barely did her justice.</p><p>When he reached her table, she looked up before he could announce himself.

Mentally yelling at himself to get his shit together, he pulled out the empty chair and sat across from her. Y/n closed down her laptop and removed her glasses, securing them at the neck of her blouse. \u201cI love your work by the way. I\u2019ve read most of your books.\u201d</p><p>She blushed, tucking her y/h/c hair behind her ear,\u00a0\u201cThank you. I love your movies. I\u2019ve probably seen The Lake House almost a dozen times. I mean, your recent work is great too, amazing, but that one is my favorite.\u201d She shifted her gaze down to her mug, embarrassed,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry, you probably hear that kind of thing all the time.\u201d</p><p>Keanu smiled wider,\u00a0\u201cNo, its okay.

After that, it didn\u2019t take long to get past the awkwardness and they fell into easy conversation. They talked until they finished their drinks, then ordered others, then talked some more. Keanu\u2019s warm and excitable personality drew her in and Y/n was refreshingly genuine and so much of an all round delight that he felt like he could spend the entire day with her. Of course, that was not possible as she informed him that she had a late lunch meeting with her editor.

You couldn\u2019t be more excited to be working alongside the legend. You were new to the business. You didn\u2019t have a lot of work under your belt yet so you were grateful for the opportunity to be working on a highly anticipated film. You were playing Keanu\u2019s younger sidekick in the movie so you had been spending a lot of time with the older gentleman. Enough time to make you fall for him. You were 26, which was pretty significant since the man was 54. You hadn\u2019t meant to fall for him. It just sort of happened. Of course you never told him and he didn\u2019t seem to notice. You didn\u2019t expect him to go for someone as young as you anyways.</p><p>You were sat off to the side one particular day, sighing at the scene that was displayed before you. Keanu was chatting with one of the female workers on set. You had noticed him talking with her a lot. She was someone who was closer to his age and she was gorgeous so of course you felt threatened by her. You frowned when you noticed her touch his arm, resulting in a wide smile from Keanu. You certainly hadn\u2019t ever made the man smile like that before. You were frustrated. How were you supposed to make the man notice when she was always around?</p><p>You sat there and though for a few moments before it finally hit you. Keanu was very much into all of the stunts that happened in movies. He performed a lot of his own. The scene you were to be in that day called for some stunts. There was a stunt double in place for you, but you decided to perform it yourself. You\u2019d trained for it, but ultimately had to have a stunt double because you couldn\u2019t land the stunt just right. You were determined to do it though.</p><p>\u201cHey, you doing okay?\u201d Someone asked you.</p><p>You shook the thoughts from your head and looked up, finding Keanu stood there. He looked a bit concerned at you so you put on a reassuring smile for him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing alright,\u201d you told him. \u201cI was actually just thinking&hellip;I\u2019d like to do my own stunt today.\u201d</p><p>Keanu\u2019s brow raised at that as he look at you, questioningly. \u201cAre you sure, Y/N? It\u2019s a hard one and you were struggling with it back in training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I can handle it,\u201d you told Keanu, feeling a bit annoyed that he didn\u2019t believe in you. \u201cIt\u2019s not that hard.\u201d</p><p>He was about to say something, but the director came over and interrupted him. He informed you that he was ready for you so you nodded and stood up. Keanu watched you as you walked off before he followed along with you two. You talked with the director about performing your own stunt. He talked it over with you and made sure you were willing to do it before he approved it.</p><p>\u201cY/N, are you sure about this?\u201d Keanu asked you once the director had walked away.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure,\u201d you told him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything else. You were eventually told to take your mark so you walked up to your place as the stunt coordinator talked with you about what you were about to do. You listened to him carefully and made sure to take his advice. He was the one who had trained you and he was good. All you had to do was jump from the balcony and land on the huge table below <i>just </i>right. Of course there were mats and things around as a percausion. You weren\u2019t too nervous about it.</p><p>\u201cAlright, quiet on the set!\u201d The director called out and everyone became silent. \u201cAction!\u201d</p><p>You looked over the balcony like the script had called for you too before you hopped up on the ledge of it. You were starting to feel a little iffy about this. There was no going back now though. You took a deep breath and jumped off of the balcony.</p><p>You didn\u2019t land how you were supposed to though.</p><p>You landed on the table alright, but you ended up twisting your wrist when you used your hands to brace yourself. You yelped out in pain as you grabbed your injured wrist and held it close to yourself.</p><p>\u201cCut! The director yelled. \u201cY/N, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI twisted my wrist when I landed,\u201d you told him as you moved off of the table.</p><p>The dorector, the stunt coordinator, and Keanu all came over to check on you. It didn\u2019t seem to be broken, but the director told you to go see the medic as a precaution. He also told you they would be using the stunt double for the scene. You sighed and nodded before Keanu lead you off set. The medic ended up checking you out in your trailer with Keanu there as well. Your wrist wasn\u2019t broken, thankfully, but it was mildly sprained. You would have to take it easy on it. He wrapped it up for you and you thanked him before he left.</p><p>You and Keanu were left alone. You were so embarrassed by what had just happened. You didnall of that to impress him and totally screwed it up. So much for that plan. It was a stupid one anyways. You didn\u2019t know what made you think it was such a good idea.</p><p>\u201cY/N, what were you thinking?\u201d Keanu finally asked. \u201cYou knew you couldn\u2019t do that and you still did it. You could\u2019ve been hurt worse that that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, Keanu,\u201d you told him as you looked down at your wrist. \u201cIt was a stupid idea and I totally blew it. I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do it then?\u201d He asked you.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d you replied and shrugged your shoulders. </p><p>\u201cBecause?\u201d He said. \u201cThat\u2019s it? Beacause? You can do better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I thought it might impress you,\u201d you finally told him and mentally facepalmed yourself.</p><p>Keanu was quiet after that. He looked shocked by the admission. You felt like jumping out of a window. Not only have you embarrassed yourself trying to perform a stunt, but you just admitted your feelings to him. Trying to fucking impress him. You sounded like a school girl.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He finally asked and you sighed.</p><p>May as well come out with it.</p><p>\u201cI performed the stunt because I thought it might impress you because I <i>like </i>you, Keanu. I\u2019ve developed feelings for you while we\u2019ve been filming this movie together. I thought that might impress you and make you see me differently. Fuck, I don\u2019t know. I was just being stupid.\u201d</p><p>You felt like running out of there, but it was <i>your </i>trailer, your sanctuary. He should just leave and put you out of your misery. You had embarrassed yourself enough. He didn\u2019t leave though. Instead, he sat down beside you on the couch and sighed. You couldn\u2019t even look at him.</p><p>\u201cY/N, you\u2019re an amazing woman, but-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here we go,\u201d you sighed as you dropped your face in your uninsured hand.</p><p>\u201cNo, listen to me,\u201d he told you and made you look at him. \u201cYou\u2019re an amazing woman. You\u2019re beautiful, talented, kind, amazing&hellip;but you\u2019re too young for me.\u201d</p><p>You frowned at that. \u201cI\u2019m 26, Keanu. Way past the legal age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m 54,\u201d he replied. \u201cThat\u2019s quite the age gap. You still have so much ahead of you and you\u2019re in your prime while I\u2019ve already been past mine. You deserve someone who\u2019s still in their prime too. Someone that you can relate to and have fun with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I relate to you,\u201d you told him. \u201cWe are such a great team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but as friends,\u201d he said with a small smile. \u201cIt just wouldn\u2019t work with us and I know that deep down you know that. Maybe if I were younger&hellip;but the world doesn\u2019t work like that. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>You felt your eyes begin to tear up and tried to hold the tears back, but a few fell. You wiped them away quickly before you nodded and looked at Keanu.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Keanu smiled sadly at you and took your ininjured hand in his, squeezing it. \u201cI would very much like for us to stay friends though. I consider myself lucky to have a friend like you.\u201d</p><p>You smiled a bit and nodded at Keanu. \u201cYeah, of course. I\u2019d like for us to stay friends. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize, Y/N,\u201d he told you. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be sorry for.\u201d He stayed there for a bit longer before he stood up and let go of your hand. \u201cI should probably head back out there. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>You nodded and put on a smile for him. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>Keanu looked at you for a moment longer before he turned away and walked out of your trailer. When he shut the door, you cried some more. You knew he was right, but it still hurt. You would eventually move on, however. Besides, at least you could still stay friends with him because he was an amazing friend.</p>",

You couldn\u2019t be more excited to be working alongside the legend. You were new to the business. You didn\u2019t have a lot of work under your belt yet so you were grateful for the opportunity to be working on a highly anticipated film. You were playing Keanu\u2019s younger sidekick in the movie so you had been spending a lot of time with the older gentleman. Enough time to make you fall for him. You were 26, which was pretty significant since the man was 54. You hadn\u2019t meant to fall for him. It just sort of happened. Of course you never told him and he didn\u2019t seem to notice. You didn\u2019t expect him to go for someone as young as you anyways.</p><p>You were sat off to the side one particular day, sighing at the scene that was displayed before you. Keanu was chatting with one of the female workers on set. You had noticed him talking with her a lot. She was someone who was closer to his age and she was gorgeous so of course you felt threatened by her. You frowned when you noticed her touch his arm, resulting in a wide smile from Keanu. You certainly hadn\u2019t ever made the man smile like that before. You were frustrated. How were you supposed to make the man notice when she was always around?</p><p>You sat there and though for a few moments before it finally hit you. Keanu was very much into all of the stunts that happened in movies. He performed a lot of his own. The scene you were to be in that day called for some stunts. There was a stunt double in place for you, but you decided to perform it yourself. You\u2019d trained for it, but ultimately had to have a stunt double because you couldn\u2019t land the stunt just right. You were determined to do it though.</p><p>\u201cHey, you doing okay?\u201d Someone asked you.</p><p>You shook the thoughts from your head and looked up, finding Keanu stood there. He looked a bit concerned at you so you put on a reassuring smile for him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing alright,\u201d you told him. \u201cI was actually just thinking\u2026I\u2019d like to do my own stunt today.\u201d</p><p>Keanu\u2019s brow raised at that as he look at you, questioningly. \u201cAre you sure, Y/N? It\u2019s a hard one and you were struggling with it back in training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I can handle it,\u201d you told Keanu, feeling a bit annoyed that he didn\u2019t believe in you. \u201cIt\u2019s not that hard.\u201d</p><p>He was about to say something, but the director came over and interrupted him. He informed you that he was ready for you so you nodded and stood up. Keanu watched you as you walked off before he followed along with you two. You talked with the director about performing your own stunt. He talked it over with you and made sure you were willing to do it before he approved it.</p><p>\u201cY/N, are you sure about this?\u201d Keanu asked you once the director had walked away.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure,\u201d you told him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything else. You were eventually told to take your mark so you walked up to your place as the stunt coordinator talked with you about what you were about to do. You listened to him carefully and made sure to take his advice. He was the one who had trained you and he was good. All you had to do was jump from the balcony and land on the huge table below <i>just </i>right. Of course there were mats and things around as a percausion. You weren\u2019t too nervous about it.</p><p>\u201cAlright, quiet on the set!\u201d The director called out and everyone became silent. \u201cAction!\u201d</p><p>You looked over the balcony like the script had called for you too before you hopped up on the ledge of it. You were starting to feel a little iffy about this. There was no going back now though. You took a deep breath and jumped off of the balcony.</p><p>You didn\u2019t land how you were supposed to though.</p><p>You landed on the table alright, but you ended up twisting your wrist when you used your hands to brace yourself. You yelped out in pain as you grabbed your injured wrist and held it close to yourself.</p><p>\u201cCut! The director yelled. \u201cY/N, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI twisted my wrist when I landed,\u201d you told him as you moved off of the table.</p><p>The dorector, the stunt coordinator, and Keanu all came over to check on you. It didn\u2019t seem to be broken, but the director told you to go see the medic as a precaution. He also told you they would be using the stunt double for the scene. You sighed and nodded before Keanu lead you off set. The medic ended up checking you out in your trailer with Keanu there as well. Your wrist wasn\u2019t broken, thankfully, but it was mildly sprained. You would have to take it easy on it. He wrapped it up for you and you thanked him before he left.</p><p>You and Keanu were left alone. You were so embarrassed by what had just happened. You didnall of that to impress him and totally screwed it up. So much for that plan. It was a stupid one anyways. You didn\u2019t know what made you think it was such a good idea.</p><p>\u201cY/N, what were you thinking?\u201d Keanu finally asked. \u201cYou knew you couldn\u2019t do that and you still did it. You could\u2019ve been hurt worse that that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, Keanu,\u201d you told him as you looked down at your wrist. \u201cIt was a stupid idea and I totally blew it. I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do it then?\u201d He asked you.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d you replied and shrugged your shoulders. </p><p>\u201cBecause?\u201d He said. \u201cThat\u2019s it? Beacause? You can do better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I thought it might impress you,\u201d you finally told him and mentally facepalmed yourself.</p><p>Keanu was quiet after that. He looked shocked by the admission. You felt like jumping out of a window. Not only have you embarrassed yourself trying to perform a stunt, but you just admitted your feelings to him. Trying to fucking impress him. You sounded like a school girl.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He finally asked and you sighed.</p><p>May as well come out with it.</p><p>\u201cI performed the stunt because I thought it might impress you because I <i>like </i>you, Keanu. I\u2019ve developed feelings for you while we\u2019ve been filming this movie together. I thought that might impress you and make you see me differently. Fuck, I don\u2019t know. I was just being stupid.\u201d</p><p>You felt like running out of there, but it was <i>your </i>trailer, your sanctuary. He should just leave and put you out of your misery. You had embarrassed yourself enough. He didn\u2019t leave though. Instead, he sat down beside you on the couch and sighed. You couldn\u2019t even look at him.</p><p>\u201cY/N, you\u2019re an amazing woman, but-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here we go,\u201d you sighed as you dropped your face in your uninsured hand.</p><p>\u201cNo, listen to me,\u201d he told you and made you look at him. \u201cYou\u2019re an amazing woman. You\u2019re beautiful, talented, kind, amazing\u2026but you\u2019re too young for me.\u201d</p><p>You frowned at that. \u201cI\u2019m 26, Keanu. Way past the legal age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m 54,\u201d he replied. \u201cThat\u2019s quite the age gap. You still have so much ahead of you and you\u2019re in your prime while I\u2019ve already been past mine. You deserve someone who\u2019s still in their prime too. Someone that you can relate to and have fun with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I relate to you,\u201d you told him. \u201cWe are such a great team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but as friends,\u201d he said with a small smile. \u201cIt just wouldn\u2019t work with us and I know that deep down you know that. Maybe if I were younger\u2026but the world doesn\u2019t work like that. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>You felt your eyes begin to tear up and tried to hold the tears back, but a few fell. You wiped them away quickly before you nodded and looked at Keanu.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Keanu smiled sadly at you and took your ininjured hand in his, squeezing it. \u201cI would very much like for us to stay friends though. I consider myself lucky to have a friend like you.\u201d</p><p>You smiled a bit and nodded at Keanu. \u201cYeah, of course. I\u2019d like for us to stay friends. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize, Y/N,\u201d he told you. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be sorry for.\u201d He stayed there for a bit longer before he stood up and let go of your hand. \u201cI should probably head back out there. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>You nodded and put on a smile for him. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>Keanu looked at you for a moment longer before he turned away and walked out of your trailer. When he shut the door, you cried some more. You knew he was right, but it still hurt. You would eventually move on, however. Besides, at least you could still stay friends with him because he was an amazing friend.</p></p>",
