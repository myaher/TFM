Asking S/o to be his girlfriend was probably the toughest task he had to face in UA. Those two were probably the most famous couple there. Mainly because people were surprised that Bakugo could get with someone as awesome as her. And she could manage to put up with someone as stubborn as him. </p><p>Once the dorms were in place, they would spend even more time with eachother. She would visit his dorm as often as possible to either study or cuddle with him. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>The bell rang, signalling the final lesson had just finished meaning that everyone could pack up and go back to their dorms. S/o was placing her books into her bag, gathering her things. She closed her bag up and headed for the door. She stopped in her tracks when she felt a warm hand grab her wrist, \u201cOi.\u201d She recognised the voice, turning around to face her boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up.\u201d She smiled</p><p>He pulled her towards him, sitting on top of a random desk and holding her hips in his hands, looking up to her e/c eyes. \u201cHow about I come over and we order some pizza hm?\u201d </p><p>She smiled at his soft behaviour, only ever acting like this around her. \u201cOkay.\u201d She pecked his forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at 5.\u201d </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>Bakugo walked down the corridor, checking his phone again to see which dorm it was. This would be the first time Bakugo had ever been to his girlfriends dorm, despite the fact that they had been dating for a few months now. He was interested to see how it looked and how she had decorated it. </p><p>His thoughts were interrupted when he started hearing yelling coming down from further down the hall. He stopped for a moment to see if he could hear it again. Surely enough the yelling continued along with loud cursing. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d He whispered to himself. He walked down quietly to investigate some more.</p><p>As he got closer, the yelling never stopped. Soon enough he realised that it was coming from his girlfriends room. </p><p>\u201cSHIT! FUCKING STOP!\u201d Bakugo stopped, stunned at her words. What could she be possibly be yelling at?</p><p>He figured he wait outside her door and listen carefully for any danger. He pressed his ear onto her door and waited for anything else. </p><p>\u201cOW STOP IT! IM TRYING TO LOVE YOU!\u201d </p><p>Love? The fuck could she be on about?</p><p>\u201cSTOP FUCKING AROUND YOU BASTARD IM TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF YOU DAMMIT!\u201d </p><p>Bakugo had it. He couldn\u2019t stand not knowing what the fuck was going on on the other side of the door. He gripped the handle tightly and turned it, pushing the door open. </p><p>Whatever he was assuming was going on he was dead wrong. He saw his s/o hovering over a glass enclosure, holding a pair of tweezers with a dead mouse on it. In the enclosure was a western hognose snake, it\u2019s head peaking out from the top of the enclosure, hissing at s/o. </p><p>She turned to face him, shock in her eyes as she was exposed in such an awkward position in front of her boyfriend. An awkward smile formed on her face as she laughed nervously. \u201cHey baby. What\u2019s good?\u201d She said attempting to make the situation a little less awkward. </p><p>\u201cWhat the hell s/o?\u201d He cocked his brow, slowly walking into her room. </p><p>\u201cOh, I guess I forgot to tell you about my snake.\u201d She giggled.</p><p>She placed the tweezers down onto the side of the enclosure. The dead mouse still placed in between the tweezers. </p><p>She reached into the enclosure to grab the snake, her hands slowly reaching down to pick him up. The snake however wasn\u2019t having it. It began to lash at her fingers, hissing over and over again. \u201cWILL YOU CALM DOWN! BAKUGO JUST WANTS TO SAY HELLO!\u201d </p><p>Bakugo was taken aback by her anger. She was always so calm and laid back so seeing her this angry with something so small seemed weird to him. </p><p>Seeing her snake lash out so much scared Bakugo a little. He didn\u2019t know if it was venomous or not but seeing the way s/o was handling it, he figured it was okay. Still, he wasn\u2019t going to take any chances. \u201cDoes it bite?\u201d He asked</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She said, she flinched as her snake bite her finger. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t bite.\u201d She held him in her hand, holding it up as the snake began to wrap itself around her forearm, it\u2019s head standing out from the rest of its body as it turned to face s/o. Leaning up to make eye contact with her. She pulled her arm closer to her face to inspect it some more, which resulted in the hognose lashing at her some more, causing her to jerk her head back every time. \u201cCute isn\u2019t he?\u201d She laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou stupid or something? It\u2019s trying to attack you.\u201d He stayed in his spot. Growing more afraid of the snake however, he was impressed by the way she was handling him so well. Unfazed by it\u2019s violent manner. </p><p>\u201cGive me your arm.\u201d She stated. </p><p>Bakugo pulled away for a second, although he trusted his girlfriend, he did not trust the hissy pissed off worm that would strike anything in its sight. He looked at his girlfriend with his brows raised, showing her very clearly how insane she looked right now. \u201cFuck no! That thing is ready to eat you.\u201d \n\u201cKatsuki you\u2019re being a pussy.\u201d She yanked his arm forward without warning, holding it close to the snake. Bakugo leaned his body back a bit however, he let her guide his arm to the snake. </p>\nThe snake slowly hovered over Bakugo\u2019s forearm, almost as if it was inspecting him, sticking out his tongue every so often. Bakugo felt at ease, it didn\u2019t seem that bad but not a second later, the snake lashed at him aswell, resulting Bakugo to let out a yelp and pull his arm away immediately.\nS/o began crying with laughter, tears forming on her eyes as she put the snake back. \u201cOh my god! Bakugo! That was too funny!\u201d She placed the snake down and was recovering from her laughing fit. Putting her head in her hands to hide her red face. Bakugo on the other hand, was beyond pissed. \u201cGo ahead and fucking laugh you weirdo, that shit nearly bit me.\u201d\n\u201cYeah but it was funny.\u201d She spat back.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a dumbass\u201d he scoffed, crossing his arms. He leant on her door, looking away from her with embarrassment.\nS/o noticed how awkward he looked, it was funny but she couldn\u2019t help but feel a little bad for laughing. \nShe let out a sigh, picking up the tweezers and putting the mouse down into the snakes cage, earning one last pissed off hiss from the snake, resulting in a quick and yet serious \u201cshut up\u201d from s/o. \nShe looked over at her boyfriend, who was still looking at the floor with a small pout on his face. Walking over to him, she poked his cheek lovingly and giggled. \n\u201cMy second favourite pissed off baby.\u201d She cooed.\n\u201cthe fuck do you mean second?!\u201d",

This would be the first time Bakugo had ever been to his girlfriends dorm, despite the fact that they had been dating for a few months now. He was interested to see how it looked and how she had decorated it. </p><p>His thoughts were interrupted when he started hearing yelling coming down from further down the hall. He stopped for a moment to see if he could hear it again. Surely enough the yelling continued along with loud cursing. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d He whispered to himself. He walked down quietly to investigate some more.</p><p>As he got closer, the yelling never stopped. Soon enough he realised that it was coming from his girlfriends room. </p><p>\u201cSHIT! FUCKING STOP!\u201d Bakugo stopped, stunned at her words. What could she be possibly be yelling at?</p><p>He figured he wait outside her door and listen carefully for any danger. He pressed his ear onto her door and waited for anything else. </p><p>\u201cOW STOP IT! IM TRYING TO LOVE YOU!\u201d </p><p>Love? The fuck could she be on about?</p><p>\u201cSTOP FUCKING AROUND YOU BASTARD IM TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF YOU DAMMIT!\u201d </p><p>Bakugo had it. He couldn\u2019t stand not knowing what the fuck was going on on the other side of the door. He gripped the handle tightly and turned it, pushing the door open. </p><p>Whatever he was assuming was going on he was dead wrong. He saw his s/o hovering over a glass enclosure, holding a pair of tweezers with a dead mouse on it. In the enclosure was a western hognose snake, it\u2019s head peaking out from the top of the enclosure, hissing at s/o. </p><p>She turned to face him, shock in her eyes as she was exposed in such an awkward position in front of her boyfriend. An awkward smile formed on her face as she laughed nervously. \u201cHey baby. What\u2019s good?\u201d She said attempting to make the situation a little less awkward. </p><p>\u201cWhat the hell s/o?\u201d He cocked his brow, slowly walking into her room. </p><p>\u201cOh, I guess I forgot to tell you about my snake.\u201d She giggled.</p><p>She placed the tweezers down onto the side of the enclosure. The dead mouse still placed in between the tweezers. </p><p>She reached into the enclosure to grab the snake, her hands slowly reaching down to pick him up. The snake however wasn\u2019t having it. It began to lash at her fingers, hissing over and over again. \u201cWILL YOU CALM DOWN! BAKUGO JUST WANTS TO SAY HELLO!\u201d </p><p>Bakugo was taken aback by her anger. She was always so calm and laid back so seeing her this angry with something so small seemed weird to him. </p><p>Seeing her snake lash out so much scared Bakugo a little. He didn\u2019t know if it was venomous or not but seeing the way s/o was handling it, he figured it was okay. Still, he wasn\u2019t going to take any chances. \u201cDoes it bite?\u201d He asked</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She said, she flinched as her snake bite her finger. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t bite.\u201d She held him in her hand, holding it up as the snake began to wrap itself around her forearm, it\u2019s head standing out from the rest of its body as it turned to face s/o. Leaning up to make eye contact with her. She pulled her arm closer to her face to inspect it some more, which resulted in the hognose lashing at her some more, causing her to jerk her head back every time. \u201cCute isn\u2019t he?\u201d She laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou stupid or something? It\u2019s trying to attack you.\u201d He stayed in his spot. Growing more afraid of the snake however, he was impressed by the way she was handling him so well. Unfazed by it\u2019s violent manner. </p><p>\u201cGive me your arm.\u201d She stated. </p><p>Bakugo pulled away for a second, although he trusted his girlfriend, he did not trust the hissy pissed off worm that would strike anything in its sight. He looked at his girlfriend with his brows raised, showing her very clearly how insane she looked right now. \u201cFuck no! That thing is ready to eat you.\u201d \n\u201cKatsuki you\u2019re being a pussy.\u201d She yanked his arm forward without warning, holding it close to the snake. Bakugo leaned his body back a bit however, he let her guide his arm to the snake. </p>\nThe snake slowly hovered over Bakugo\u2019s forearm, almost as if it was inspecting him, sticking out his tongue every so often. Bakugo felt at ease, it didn\u2019t seem that bad but not a second later, the snake lashed at him aswell, resulting Bakugo to let out a yelp and pull his arm away immediately.\nS/o began crying with laughter, tears forming on her eyes as she put the snake back. \u201cOh my god! Bakugo! That was too funny!\u201d She placed the snake down and was recovering from her laughing fit. Putting her head in her hands to hide her red face. Bakugo on the other hand, was beyond pissed. \u201cGo ahead and fucking laugh you weirdo, that shit nearly bit me.\u201d\n\u201cYeah but it was funny.\u201d She spat back.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a dumbass\u201d he scoffed, crossing his arms. He leant on her door, looking away from her with embarrassment.\nS/o noticed how awkward he looked, it was funny but she couldn\u2019t help but feel a little bad for laughing. \nShe let out a sigh, picking up the tweezers and putting the mouse down into the snakes cage, earning one last pissed off hiss from the snake, resulting in a quick and yet serious \u201cshut up\u201d from s/o. \nShe looked over at her boyfriend, who was still looking at the floor with a small pout on his face. Walking over to him, she poked his cheek lovingly and giggled. \n\u201cMy second favourite pissed off baby.\u201d She cooed.\n\u201cthe fuck do you mean second?!\u201d</p>",
