You aren\u2019t dres-\u201d</p><p>Anakin\nlaughed, shrugging. \u201cI don\u2019t mind sparing in jeans and t-shirt,\nI\u2019ll just throw my coat and sweater off for the round.\u201d He winked\nat Ben.</p><p>\u2018\u2026I\ndo hope he\u2019s not lying, cause his confidence is really\u2026 nice.\u2019\nBen bit his lip, smiling up at him. Confidence had always been a\ngood turn-on for him.</p><p>()()()</p><p>\u2018Well\nthat\u2019s good, Obi-Wan smells of attraction\u2026\u2019 Vader\nshifted, wanting to pounce, wanting to cage and contain and hold onto\nhis reptilian demon love.</p><p>Obi-Wan\nand his slender tail wrapped around Vader\u2019s waist, his slitted eyes\nfull of mischievousness as he dug his claws playfully into Vader\u2019s\nshoulder blades while playfully hissing at him as if he was a snake.</p><p>And\nthen \u2018Ben\u2019 stood and reality hit him like a fall to earth from\nthe sky.</p><p>Mortal,\nhuman and no memories.</p><p>Not\nVader\u2019s love, no tail to playfully tug on or wrap around his waist.</p><p>\u2018Want\nmy Obi-Wan, want my love, my sinfully sweet temptation wrapped in\nsilk and\nheat\u2026 wrapped in love.
