        "question": "I was just reading one of the post about how book Arya and book Sansa wouldn\u2019t have survived in each other\u2019s situations. It is hilarious how while everyone agrees that book Sansa wouldn\u2019t survive, they keep fighting that book Arya would survive and Sansa stans are reducing her to a killing machine with no intelligence. No that\u2019s not the the reason Arya wouldn\u2019t survive. We have seen again and again that both Sansa and Arya are intelligent and both have a bit of Sassiness. (1/2)",
        "answer": "<blockquote><p>\n\nThe difference is since the beginning Sansa knew to keep her mouth shut because she was a lady while Arya didn\u2019t have a filter and would say what she thought. It was never about intelligence or cunningness. (2/2)<br/></p></blockquote><p>Arya hiding her identity helped her survive. no one was gunning to imprison or kill her because they didn\u2019t know who she was. You can\u2019t use whatever success she had on the run to claim she would have survived King\u2019s Landing where everyone will know she\u2019s Arya Stark, she\u2019ll have Joffrey\u2019s wrath aimed at her for embarrassing him. In a way Sansa not taking side and hiding her fear of Joffrey saved her life.</p><p>They\u2019re only doing this to discredit Sansa. They are competing with- I mean they think Arya and Sansa are competing and Arya is winning as if their arcs aren\u2019t paced at the same speed (Arya was in the Riverlands the same length of time Sansa was held hostage in KL).\u00a0</p>",

ENJOY xx </b></p><p><b><i>Warning: only Theon saying a swear word </i></b></p><p><i>\u201cI simply do not understand why I must be the one to do this. Especially when Joffrey is of age, you plan to have him marry Ned\u2019s daughter.\u201d You complained to your brother, Robert. \u201cBecause my dear sister, we need to make our alliances stronger than ever.\u201d He answered </i></p><p><i>\u201cNed Stark is beyond loyal to you. You don\u2019t need me to marry his son to solidify that.\u201d You rebutted. \u201cDaenerys Targaryen is being given to Kahl Drogo. She has an army now and if I am to avenge my love then I need this.\u201d Robert said, his voice stern. </i></p><p><i>Robert knew better than to yell at you. Because you may look beautiful and fragile on the outside, the inside is strong and fierce. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou cannot use losing her as probable cause to marry of your younger sister.\u201d You snapped. \u201cIt has already been decided, Y/N. You are marrying Robb Stark and we leave for Winterfell in the morning.\u201d Robert concluded. You glared at your older brother before exiting his chambers, but not without slamming the door. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t even have a say in the matter? You are just deciding that I am to marry Y/N Baratheon?\u201d Robb asked his father, after hearing of the news that you two were to marry. \u201cWe need to strengthen our alliance. The King says it has to be done.\u201d Ned replied. </i></p><p><i>Robb was furious. Not only was he being ordered to do this, but he\u2019d lose his sense of freedom. A wife would stop him from doing all of the things he loved most. \u201cIt\u2019s been decided, Robb. The King and Queen will be leaving Kings Landing in the morning.\u201d His father added. </i></p><p><i>Robb sent him a glare before storming out of the room. </i></p><p>The journey to Winterfell was long and difficult and you didn\u2019t think you could spend another month, trapped in a carriage with your nephew. </p><p>\u201cNow, Y/N, you are betrothed to Robb Stark. Make a good impression.\u201d Cersei told you. \u201cI fully intend to do so.\u201d You replied. \u201cI was betrothed to your brother and now I\u2019m queen.\u201d She added. \u201cYou despise each other. And I am almost certain he\u2019s been with every woman in Lord Baelish\u2019s brothel.\u201d You said. </p><p>Cersei swallowed before she put on her signature fake smile. Call yourself a romantic, but being in a loveless marriage was something you never wanted to face. You wanted to marry someone for love, not power. But Robert had other arrangements for you. </p><p>The carriage stopped in front of what you assumed to be the Stark family. </p><p>\u201cAre you excited?\u201d Sansa whispered to Robb. He looked down at his sister before he returned his gaze to the gold and red carriage. \u201cWhat if she hates me? What if I hate her?\u201d He asked. </p><p>\u201cY/N Baratheon is said to be the most beautiful and gracious member of house Baratheon. It will not be possible for you to hate her.\u201d Sansa told him. \u201cThat will not stop her from hating me.\u201d Robb said. </p><p>Sansa rolled her eyes slightly as Robert greeted her father warmly. Cersei stepped out of the carriage, followed by Joffrey and then you. </p><p>Jamie got off his horse to assist you with exiting the carriage. \u201cYou look nervous.\u201d He whispered to you. You looked up at him and nodded your head, swallowing the lump in your throat. \u201cI am petrified. What if he hates me?\u201d You asked him. </p><p>\u201cIt is nearly impossible to hate you, my lady.\u201d Jamie replied. </p><p>Jamie was a bit of a \u201csuck up\u201d when it came to you. He knew well, as did all of the seven realms, that you were Robert\u2019s favorite sibling. Therefore, a friend of yours is a friend of his, which is a very useful title. </p><p>\u201cMay I present my sister, Y/N Baratheon.\u201d Robert said, grabbing your hand. \u201cY/N, you remember Lord Eddard Stark.\u201d He added. You looked up at Ned and smiled before bowing courteously. </p><p>\u201cYes. Very good to see you, my lord.\u201d You greeted him. \u201cYou as well, Lady Y/N.\u201d Ned replied. \u201cMay I introduce my children. Rickon, our youngest, Bran, Arya, Sansa and Robb.\u201d He added. </p><p>You greeted them all with kind smiles, especially the younger ones, as they seemed a bit overwhelmed. Your eyes landed on Robb and you gave him an even sweeter smile. He looked at you and it felt as if you two were the only people present. <i>\u2018Maybe this won\u2019t be so bad after all\u2019 </i>He thought. </p><p>As everyone dispersed, you noticed Sansa looking longingly at your nephew. </p><p>\u201cI see you have noticed Joffrey.\u201d You said approaching her. She looked over at you, a look of embarrassment etched across her face. \u201cMy apologies, my lady.\u201d She said to you. \u201cIt\u2019s quite alright.\u201d You told her with a smile. </p><p>All the while, Robb was watching you interact with his younger sister. As well as completely ignoring what Jon was saying.</p><p>\u201cCan you keep a secret?\u201d You asked her in a hush tone. Sansa smiled wildly at you as she nodded. \u201cI overheard my brother and the queen talking and I have reason to believe that they are arranging to have you and Joffrey wed when you are both of age.\u201d You said.</p><p>Sansa\u2019s face lit up, giddy with excitement over the thought of marrying Joffrey. She smiled at you even bigger before hugging you and running off. </p><p>You chuckled a bit, coming to the conclusion that she was a very sweet girl. </p><p>\u201cShould you have told her that?\u201d You heard a deep voice ask. You turn around and see the eldest Stark walking slowly towards you. \u201cProbably not, but, I spoke truthfully.\u201d You answered. </p><p>Silence fell upon the two of you before Robb remembered who you were. \u201cUh, apologies, my lady. I am Robb Stark.\u201d He stammered bowing to you. You laughed again, which was music to his ears. </p><p>\u201cPlease, call me Y/N.\u201d You told him. \u201cIf we are to be married, there is no need for titles.\u201d You added. Robb stood up straighter and smiled at you. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d He said. </p><p>\u201cSo tell me, Robb, is it always this cold in Winterfell?\u201d You asked, pulling your cloak tightly around you, trying to keep warm. Robb didn\u2019t give you a verbal response, instead he took off his own furs and wrapped them around your shoulders. </p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t have you freezing to death now can we?\u201d He said to, his face only a few inches from yours. \u201cThank you.\u201d You said. </p><p>Robb backed away from you to make sure he didn\u2019t overstep. \u201cY/N,\u201d You beard Cersei call you. You turned your head to look at your sister-in-law, signaling her to keep speaking. \u201cWe must get you ready for the feast.\u201d She finished.</p><p>You nodded your head to her, before she retreated back inside. \u201cI have been summoned.\u201d You said to Robb. \u201cI will see you at the feast, my lady.\u201d He said. You gave him a playful glare, him laughing slightly. </p><p>\u201cI will see you at the feast, <i>Y/N.\u201d</i> He corrected. You gave him a smile, nodding your head curtly. \u201cMuch better.\u201d You told him before heading towards your chambers. </p><p>\u2014-</p><p>\u201cIs being here as bad as you thought?\u201d Cersei asked you, as your handmaiden was doing your hair. \u201cIt\u2019s freezing, the sun hasn\u2019t been out once and the men here are, uh, unconventional. But, after meeting Robb Stark, all of that has disappeared.\u201d You answered. </p><p>Cersei remained quiet as she nodded her head. She silently envied you. Though you were her sister-in-law and you never did anything to upset her, she envied how lucky you got. You were forced to marry someone and the both of you just so happened to be enamored with each other. </p><p>\u201cWe do not wish to be late.\u201d She spoke as she stood up from her seat. You followed her out of the room and towards where the feast was being held. </p><p>You sat next to Cersei and Lady Catelyn, not being allowed to sit amongst the Stark siblings. Who were soon to become your siblings as well. </p><p>Robb was seated next to Theon Greyjoy. Almost the entire time, his eyes never left you. </p><p>\u201cRobb, are you listening?\u201d Theon asked his friend. \u201cYes, yes, I\u2019m listening.\u201d Robb answered, snapping back into reality. \u201cYou keep staring at Y/N Baratheon.\u201d Theon pointed out. \u201cYou\u2019re one of the lucky ones. There could be uglier whores to marry.\u201d He added. </p><p>Robb slammed his cup onto the table and looked at him. \u201cDo not call her that.\u201d He snapped. Theon glared back at his friend before returning to his food. </p><p>The eldest Stark watched you carefully as you were conversing with his mother, you smiling and genuinely interested in the conversation you were having. He found it impossible not to stare at you. You just took his breath away. </p><p>\u201cTell me, Lady Y/N, how are you enjoying Winterfell?\u201d Lady Catelyn asked you. \u201cIf I may be so bold, your son has made my arrival much better.\u201d You answered. </p><p>Lady Catelyn smiled at you, very relieved to hear that from you. </p><p>As you continued to talk with Lady Catelyn, you noticed Robb get up and leave the feast rather early. You were a bit upset you didn\u2019t get to talk to him as much as you would like, but your brother forbade you from being in the middle of a bunch of drunk men. </p><p>A few minutes have passed, when Sansa approached you. \u201cLady Y/N, Robb wishes to see you in his chambers.\u201d She told you. You smiled at her warmly as you stood up, excusing yourself politely. You wrapped your clock around your body before making your way out of the room.</p><p>You received where to go from Sansa, since you had no idea where to go. When you arrived, you knocked on the door softly. </p><p>It opened quickly and there stood Robb. \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t going to come.\u201d He said. \u201cWhen my future husband requests my presence, it would be rude not to come.\u201d You answered. </p><p>Robb smiled down at you before he moved aside to let you into the room. You removed your cloak due to the fire that was started in the fireplace. \u201cIf you do not mind me asking, why did you ask me here?\u201d You asked facing him. </p><p>\u201cWe never got a the opportunity to talk more before the feast.\u201d Robb answered. You sat on the edge of the bed as Robb sat next to you. It should have been an uncomfortable and awkward situation but it didn\u2019t feel as such to the both of you. </p><p>You talked for hours, telling each other every detail of each other\u2019s lives. It had only been a day and yet you felt like you\u2019ve known Robb your entire life. Of course you knew of each other but never on an intimate level.\u00a0</p><p>Robb had been listening to you talk about growing up with all brothers, when he noticed that the sun was rising.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt looks like you have been here all night.\u201d He commented. Your eyes widened as you turned around to look out the window.\u00a0\u201cOh, I am so sorry.\u201d You apologized standing up from the bed.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s okay, really. I loved being able to talk to you. To get to know you.\u201d Robb said, following suit.\u00a0</p><p>You picked up your cloak and wrapped it around your shoulders. Robb walked towards you and grabbed the strings and began to tie it closed for you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve only known each other for a mere day and yet I have found myself completely enamored with you.\u201d He said. You looked up and smiled at him before you pressed a gentle kiss on his cheek.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m completely enamored with you as well.\u201d You whispered to him before turning to leave.\u00a0</p><p>Robb watched you walk out, a smile forming on his face.\u00a0<i>\u2018This will not be as bad as I thought.\u2019</i></p><p><b>**I\u2019m thinking of doing a part 2 to this, maybe a part 3. So if you\u2019d be interested in that, let me know!! If I don\u2019t get any feedback, I\u2019ll probably leave it at this!**</b></p>",

Very good to see you, my lord.\u201d You greeted him. \u201cYou as well, Lady Y/N.\u201d Ned replied. \u201cMay I introduce my children. Rickon, our youngest, Bran, Arya, Sansa and Robb.\u201d He added. </p><p>You greeted them all with kind smiles, especially the younger ones, as they seemed a bit overwhelmed. Your eyes landed on Robb and you gave him an even sweeter smile. He looked at you and it felt as if you two were the only people present. <i>\u2018Maybe this won\u2019t be so bad after all\u2019 </i>He thought. </p><p>As everyone dispersed, you noticed Sansa looking longingly at your nephew. </p><p>\u201cI see you have noticed Joffrey.\u201d You said approaching her. She looked over at you, a look of embarrassment etched across her face. \u201cMy apologies, my lady.\u201d She said to you. \u201cIt\u2019s quite alright.\u201d You told her with a smile. </p><p>All the while, Robb was watching you interact with his younger sister. As well as completely ignoring what Jon was saying.</p><p>\u201cCan you keep a secret?\u201d You asked her in a hush tone. Sansa smiled wildly at you as she nodded. \u201cI overheard my brother and the queen talking and I have reason to believe that they are arranging to have you and Joffrey wed when you are both of age.\u201d You said.</p><p>Sansa\u2019s face lit up, giddy with excitement over the thought of marrying Joffrey. She smiled at you even bigger before hugging you and running off. </p><p>You chuckled a bit, coming to the conclusion that she was a very sweet girl. </p><p>\u201cShould you have told her that?\u201d You heard a deep voice ask. You turn around and see the eldest Stark walking slowly towards you. \u201cProbably not, but, I spoke truthfully.\u201d You answered. </p><p>Silence fell upon the two of you before Robb remembered who you were. \u201cUh, apologies, my lady. I am Robb Stark.\u201d He stammered bowing to you. You laughed again, which was music to his ears. </p><p>\u201cPlease, call me Y/N.\u201d You told him. \u201cIf we are to be married, there is no need for titles.\u201d You added. Robb stood up straighter and smiled at you. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d He said. </p><p>\u201cSo tell me, Robb, is it always this cold in Winterfell?\u201d You asked, pulling your cloak tightly around you, trying to keep warm. Robb didn\u2019t give you a verbal response, instead he took off his own furs and wrapped them around your shoulders. </p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t have you freezing to death now can we?\u201d He said to, his face only a few inches from yours. \u201cThank you.\u201d You said. </p><p>Robb backed away from you to make sure he didn\u2019t overstep. \u201cY/N,\u201d You beard Cersei call you. You turned your head to look at your sister-in-law, signaling her to keep speaking. \u201cWe must get you ready for the feast.\u201d She finished.</p><p>You nodded your head to her, before she retreated back inside. \u201cI have been summoned.\u201d You said to Robb. \u201cI will see you at the feast, my lady.\u201d He said. You gave him a playful glare, him laughing slightly. </p><p>\u201cI will see you at the feast, <i>Y/N.\u201d</i> He corrected. You gave him a smile, nodding your head curtly. \u201cMuch better.\u201d You told him before heading towards your chambers. </p><p>\u2014-</p><p>\u201cIs being here as bad as you thought?\u201d Cersei asked you, as your handmaiden was doing your hair. \u201cIt\u2019s freezing, the sun hasn\u2019t been out once and the men here are, uh, unconventional. But, after meeting Robb Stark, all of that has disappeared.\u201d You answered. </p><p>Cersei remained quiet as she nodded her head. She silently envied you. Though you were her sister-in-law and you never did anything to upset her, she envied how lucky you got. You were forced to marry someone and the both of you just so happened to be enamored with each other. </p><p>\u201cWe do not wish to be late.\u201d She spoke as she stood up from her seat. You followed her out of the room and towards where the feast was being held. </p><p>You sat next to Cersei and Lady Catelyn, not being allowed to sit amongst the Stark siblings. Who were soon to become your siblings as well. </p><p>Robb was seated next to Theon Greyjoy. Almost the entire time, his eyes never left you. </p><p>\u201cRobb, are you listening?\u201d Theon asked his friend. \u201cYes, yes, I\u2019m listening.\u201d Robb answered, snapping back into reality. \u201cYou keep staring at Y/N Baratheon.\u201d Theon pointed out. \u201cYou\u2019re one of the lucky ones. There could be uglier whores to marry.\u201d He added. </p><p>Robb slammed his cup onto the table and looked at him. \u201cDo not call her that.\u201d He snapped. Theon glared back at his friend before returning to his food. </p><p>The eldest Stark watched you carefully as you were conversing with his mother, you smiling and genuinely interested in the conversation you were having. He found it impossible not to stare at you. You just took his breath away. </p><p>\u201cTell me, Lady Y/N, how are you enjoying Winterfell?\u201d Lady Catelyn asked you. \u201cIf I may be so bold, your son has made my arrival much better.\u201d You answered. </p><p>Lady Catelyn smiled at you, very relieved to hear that from you. </p><p>As you continued to talk with Lady Catelyn, you noticed Robb get up and leave the feast rather early. You were a bit upset you didn\u2019t get to talk to him as much as you would like, but your brother forbade you from being in the middle of a bunch of drunk men. </p><p>A few minutes have passed, when Sansa approached you. \u201cLady Y/N, Robb wishes to see you in his chambers.\u201d She told you. You smiled at her warmly as you stood up, excusing yourself politely. You wrapped your clock around your body before making your way out of the room.</p><p>You received where to go from Sansa, since you had no idea where to go. When you arrived, you knocked on the door softly. </p><p>It opened quickly and there stood Robb. \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t going to come.\u201d He said. \u201cWhen my future husband requests my presence, it would be rude not to come.\u201d You answered. </p><p>Robb smiled down at you before he moved aside to let you into the room. You removed your cloak due to the fire that was started in the fireplace. \u201cIf you do not mind me asking, why did you ask me here?\u201d You asked facing him. </p><p>\u201cWe never got a the opportunity to talk more before the feast.\u201d Robb answered. You sat on the edge of the bed as Robb sat next to you. It should have been an uncomfortable and awkward situation but it didn\u2019t feel as such to the both of you. </p><p>You talked for hours, telling each other every detail of each other\u2019s lives. It had only been a day and yet you felt like you\u2019ve known Robb your entire life. Of course you knew of each other but never on an intimate level.\u00a0</p><p>Robb had been listening to you talk about growing up with all brothers, when he noticed that the sun was rising.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt looks like you have been here all night.\u201d He commented. Your eyes widened as you turned around to look out the window.\u00a0\u201cOh, I am so sorry.\u201d You apologized standing up from the bed.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s okay, really. I loved being able to talk to you. To get to know you.\u201d Robb said, following suit.\u00a0</p><p>You picked up your cloak and wrapped it around your shoulders. Robb walked towards you and grabbed the strings and began to tie it closed for you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve only known each other for a mere day and yet I have found myself completely enamored with you.\u201d He said. You looked up and smiled at him before you pressed a gentle kiss on his cheek.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m completely enamored with you as well.\u201d You whispered to him before turning to leave.\u00a0</p><p>Robb watched you walk out, a smile forming on his face.\u00a0<i>\u2018This will not be as bad as I thought.\u2019</i></p><p><b>**I\u2019m thinking of doing a part 2 to this, maybe a part 3.

Neither of you want it, neither of you know how to get out of it. But maybe that\u2019s not such a bad thing. </i></p><p><b>AN: this is a little different!! i have recently started watching game of thrones and have fallen in love with robb stark. yes i know what happens to him and i\u2019m not okay SO this is my coping mechanism. ENJOY xx </b></p><p><b><i>Warning: only Theon saying a swear word </i></b></p><p><i>\u201cI simply do not understand why I must be the one to do this. Especially when Joffrey is of age, you plan to have him marry Ned\u2019s daughter.\u201d You complained to your brother, Robert. \u201cBecause my dear sister, we need to make our alliances stronger than ever.\u201d He answered </i></p><p><i>\u201cNed Stark is beyond loyal to you. You don\u2019t need me to marry his son to solidify that.\u201d You rebutted. \u201cDaenerys Targaryen is being given to Kahl Drogo. She has an army now and if I am to avenge my love then I need this.\u201d Robert said, his voice stern. </i></p><p><i>Robert knew better than to yell at you. Because you may look beautiful and fragile on the outside, the inside is strong and fierce. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou cannot use losing her as probable cause to marry of your younger sister.\u201d You snapped. \u201cIt has already been decided, Y/N. You are marrying Robb Stark and we leave for Winterfell in the morning.\u201d Robert concluded. You glared at your older brother before exiting his chambers, but not without slamming the door. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t even have a say in the matter? You are just deciding that I am to marry Y/N Baratheon?\u201d Robb asked his father, after hearing of the news that you two were to marry. \u201cWe need to strengthen our alliance. The King says it has to be done.\u201d Ned replied. </i></p><p><i>Robb was furious. Not only was he being ordered to do this, but he\u2019d lose his sense of freedom. A wife would stop him from doing all of the things he loved most. \u201cIt\u2019s been decided, Robb. The King and Queen will be leaving Kings Landing in the morning.\u201d His father added. </i></p><p><i>Robb sent him a glare before storming out of the room. </i></p><p>The journey to Winterfell was long and difficult and you didn\u2019t think you could spend another month, trapped in a carriage with your nephew. </p><p>\u201cNow, Y/N, you are betrothed to Robb Stark. Make a good impression.\u201d Cersei told you. \u201cI fully intend to do so.\u201d You replied. \u201cI was betrothed to your brother and now I\u2019m queen.\u201d She added. \u201cYou despise each other. And I am almost certain he\u2019s been with every woman in Lord Baelish\u2019s brothel.\u201d You said. </p><p>Cersei swallowed before she put on her signature fake smile. Call yourself a romantic, but being in a loveless marriage was something you never wanted to face. You wanted to marry someone for love, not power. But Robert had other arrangements for you. </p><p>The carriage stopped in front of what you assumed to be the Stark family. </p><p>\u201cAre you excited?\u201d Sansa whispered to Robb. He looked down at his sister before he returned his gaze to the gold and red carriage. \u201cWhat if she hates me? What if I hate her?\u201d He asked. </p><p>\u201cY/N Baratheon is said to be the most beautiful and gracious member of house Baratheon. It will not be possible for you to hate her.\u201d Sansa told him. \u201cThat will not stop her from hating me.\u201d Robb said. </p><p>Sansa rolled her eyes slightly as Robert greeted her father warmly. Cersei stepped out of the carriage, followed by Joffrey and then you. </p><p>Jamie got off his horse to assist you with exiting the carriage. \u201cYou look nervous.\u201d He whispered to you. You looked up at him and nodded your head, swallowing the lump in your throat. \u201cI am petrified. What if he hates me?\u201d You asked him. </p><p>\u201cIt is nearly impossible to hate you, my lady.\u201d Jamie replied. </p><p>Jamie was a bit of a \u201csuck up\u201d when it came to you. He knew well, as did all of the seven realms, that you were Robert\u2019s favorite sibling. Therefore, a friend of yours is a friend of his, which is a very useful title. </p><p>\u201cMay I present my sister, Y/N Baratheon.\u201d Robert said, grabbing your hand. \u201cY/N, you remember Lord Eddard Stark.\u201d He added. You looked up at Ned and smiled before bowing courteously. </p><p>\u201cYes.

Robb didn\u2019t give you a verbal response, instead he took off his own furs and wrapped them around your shoulders. </p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t have you freezing to death now can we?\u201d He said to, his face only a few inches from yours. \u201cThank you.\u201d You said. </p><p>Robb backed away from you to make sure he didn\u2019t overstep. \u201cY/N,\u201d You beard Cersei call you.

                "content": "<p><h2>Completely Enamored (r.s.)</h2><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><i>Summary: Your eldest brother, Robert Baratheon, has decided to marry you off to Ned Stark&rsquo;s oldest son. Neither of you want it, neither of you know how to get out of it. But maybe that&rsquo;s not such a bad thing. </i></p><p><b>AN: this is a little different!! i have recently started watching game of thrones and have fallen in love with robb stark. yes i know what happens to him and i&rsquo;m not okay SO this is my coping mechanism. ENJOY xx </b></p><p><b><i>Warning: only Theon saying a swear word </i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;I simply do not understand why I must be the one to do this. Especially when Joffrey is of age, you plan to have him marry Ned&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo; You complained to your brother, Robert. &ldquo;Because my dear sister, we need to make our alliances stronger than ever.&rdquo; He answered </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Ned Stark is beyond loyal to you. You don&rsquo;t need me to marry his son to solidify that.&rdquo; You rebutted. &ldquo;Daenerys Targaryen is being given to Kahl Drogo. She has an army now and if I am to avenge my love then I need this.&rdquo; Robert said, his voice stern. </i></p><p><i>Robert knew better than to yell at you. Because you may look beautiful and fragile on the outside, the inside is strong and fierce. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You cannot use losing her as probable cause to marry of your younger sister.&rdquo; You snapped. &ldquo;It has already been decided, Y/N. You are marrying Robb Stark and we leave for Winterfell in the morning.&rdquo; Robert concluded. You glared at your older brother before exiting his chambers, but not without slamming the door. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even have a say in the matter? You are just deciding that I am to marry Y/N Baratheon?&rdquo; Robb asked his father, after hearing of the news that you two were to marry. &ldquo;We need to strengthen our alliance. The King says it has to be done.&rdquo; Ned replied. </i></p><p><i>Robb was furious. Not only was he being ordered to do this, but he&rsquo;d lose his sense of freedom. A wife would stop him from doing all of the things he loved most. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been decided, Robb. The King and Queen will be leaving Kings Landing in the morning.&rdquo; His father added. </i></p><p><i>Robb sent him a glare before storming out of the room. </i></p><p>The journey to Winterfell was long and difficult and you didn&rsquo;t think you could spend another month, trapped in a carriage with your nephew. </p><p>&ldquo;Now, Y/N, you are betrothed to Robb Stark. Make a good impression.&rdquo; Cersei told you. &ldquo;I fully intend to do so.&rdquo; You replied. &ldquo;I was betrothed to your brother and now I&rsquo;m queen.&rdquo; She added. &ldquo;You despise each other. And I am almost certain he&rsquo;s been with every woman in Lord Baelish&rsquo;s brothel.&rdquo; You said. </p><p>Cersei swallowed before she put on her signature fake smile. Call yourself a romantic, but being in a loveless marriage was something you never wanted to face. You wanted to marry someone for love, not power. But Robert had other arrangements for you. </p><p>The carriage stopped in front of what you assumed to be the Stark family. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you excited?&rdquo; Sansa whispered to Robb. He looked down at his sister before he returned his gaze to the gold and red carriage. &ldquo;What if she hates me? What if I hate her?&rdquo; He asked. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N Baratheon is said to be the most beautiful and gracious member of house Baratheon. It will not be possible for you to hate her.&rdquo; Sansa told him. &ldquo;That will not stop her from hating me.&rdquo; Robb said. </p><p>Sansa rolled her eyes slightly as Robert greeted her father warmly. Cersei stepped out of the carriage, followed by Joffrey and then you. </p><p>Jamie got off his horse to assist you with exiting the carriage. &ldquo;You look nervous.&rdquo; He whispered to you. You looked up at him and nodded your head, swallowing the lump in your throat. &ldquo;I am petrified. What if he hates me?&rdquo; You asked him. </p><p>&ldquo;It is nearly impossible to hate you, my lady.&rdquo; Jamie replied. </p><p>Jamie was a bit of a &ldquo;suck up&rdquo; when it came to you. He knew well, as did all of the seven realms, that you were Robert&rsquo;s favorite sibling. Therefore, a friend of yours is a friend of his, which is a very useful title. </p><p>&ldquo;May I present my sister, Y/N Baratheon.&rdquo; Robert said, grabbing your hand. &ldquo;Y/N, you remember Lord Eddard Stark.&rdquo; He added. You looked up at Ned and smiled before bowing courteously. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes. Very good to see you, my lord.&rdquo; You greeted him. &ldquo;You as well, Lady Y/N.&rdquo; Ned replied. &ldquo;May I introduce my children. Rickon, our youngest, Bran, Arya, Sansa and Robb.&rdquo; He added. </p><p>You greeted them all with kind smiles, especially the younger ones, as they seemed a bit overwhelmed. Your eyes landed on Robb and you gave him an even sweeter smile. He looked at you and it felt as if you two were the only people present. <i>&lsquo;Maybe this won&rsquo;t be so bad after all&rsquo; </i>He thought. </p><p>As everyone dispersed, you noticed Sansa looking longingly at your nephew. </p><p>&ldquo;I see you have noticed Joffrey.&rdquo; You said approaching her. She looked over at you, a look of embarrassment etched across her face. &ldquo;My apologies, my lady.&rdquo; She said to you. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite alright.&rdquo; You told her with a smile. </p><p>All the while, Robb was watching you interact with his younger sister. As well as completely ignoring what Jon was saying.</p><p>&ldquo;Can you keep a secret?&rdquo; You asked her in a hush tone. Sansa smiled wildly at you as she nodded. &ldquo;I overheard my brother and the queen talking and I have reason to believe that they are arranging to have you and Joffrey wed when you are both of age.&rdquo; You said.</p><p>Sansa&rsquo;s face lit up, giddy with excitement over the thought of marrying Joffrey. She smiled at you even bigger before hugging you and running off. </p><p>You chuckled a bit, coming to the conclusion that she was a very sweet girl. </p><p>&ldquo;Should you have told her that?&rdquo; You heard a deep voice ask. You turn around and see the eldest Stark walking slowly towards you. &ldquo;Probably not, but, I spoke truthfully.&rdquo; You answered. </p><p>Silence fell upon the two of you before Robb remembered who you were. &ldquo;Uh, apologies, my lady. I am Robb Stark.&rdquo; He stammered bowing to you. You laughed again, which was music to his ears. </p><p>&ldquo;Please, call me Y/N.&rdquo; You told him. &ldquo;If we are to be married, there is no need for titles.&rdquo; You added. Robb stood up straighter and smiled at you. &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; He said. </p><p>&ldquo;So tell me, Robb, is it always this cold in Winterfell?&rdquo; You asked, pulling your cloak tightly around you, trying to keep warm. Robb didn&rsquo;t give you a verbal response, instead he took off his own furs and wrapped them around your shoulders. </p><p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t have you freezing to death now can we?&rdquo; He said to, his face only a few inches from yours. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; You said. </p><p>Robb backed away from you to make sure he didn&rsquo;t overstep. &ldquo;Y/N,&rdquo; You beard Cersei call you. You turned your head to look at your sister-in-law, signaling her to keep speaking. &ldquo;We must get you ready for the feast.&rdquo; She finished.</p><p>You nodded your head to her, before she retreated back inside. &ldquo;I have been summoned.&rdquo; You said to Robb. &ldquo;I will see you at the feast, my lady.&rdquo; He said. You gave him a playful glare, him laughing slightly. </p><p>&ldquo;I will see you at the feast, <i>Y/N.&rdquo;</i> He corrected. You gave him a smile, nodding your head curtly. &ldquo;Much better.&rdquo; You told him before heading towards your chambers. </p><p>&mdash;-</p><p>&ldquo;Is being here as bad as you thought?&rdquo; Cersei asked you, as your handmaiden was doing your hair. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s freezing, the sun hasn&rsquo;t been out once and the men here are, uh, unconventional. But, after meeting Robb Stark, all of that has disappeared.&rdquo; You answered. </p><p>Cersei remained quiet as she nodded her head. She silently envied you. Though you were her sister-in-law and you never did anything to upset her, she envied how lucky you got. You were forced to marry someone and the both of you just so happened to be enamored with each other. </p><p>&ldquo;We do not wish to be late.&rdquo; She spoke as she stood up from her seat. You followed her out of the room and towards where the feast was being held. </p><p>You sat next to Cersei and Lady Catelyn, not being allowed to sit amongst the Stark siblings. Who were soon to become your siblings as well. </p><p>Robb was seated next to Theon Greyjoy. Almost the entire time, his eyes never left you. </p><p>&ldquo;Robb, are you listening?&rdquo; Theon asked his friend. &ldquo;Yes, yes, I&rsquo;m listening.&rdquo; Robb answered, snapping back into reality. &ldquo;You keep staring at Y/N Baratheon.&rdquo; Theon pointed out. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re one of the lucky ones. There could be uglier whores to marry.&rdquo; He added. </p><p>Robb slammed his cup onto the table and looked at him. &ldquo;Do not call her that.&rdquo; He snapped. Theon glared back at his friend before returning to his food. </p><p>The eldest Stark watched you carefully as you were conversing with his mother, you smiling and genuinely interested in the conversation you were having. He found it impossible not to stare at you. You just took his breath away. </p><p>&ldquo;Tell me, Lady Y/N, how are you enjoying Winterfell?&rdquo; Lady Catelyn asked you. &ldquo;If I may be so bold, your son has made my arrival much better.&rdquo; You answered. </p><p>Lady Catelyn smiled at you, very relieved to hear that from you. </p><p>As you continued to talk with Lady Catelyn, you noticed Robb get up and leave the feast rather early. You were a bit upset you didn&rsquo;t get to talk to him as much as you would like, but your brother forbade you from being in the middle of a bunch of drunk men. </p><p>A few minutes have passed, when Sansa approached you. &ldquo;Lady Y/N, Robb wishes to see you in his chambers.&rdquo; She told you. You smiled at her warmly as you stood up, excusing yourself politely. You wrapped your clock around your body before making your way out of the room.</p><p>You received where to go from Sansa, since you had no idea where to go. When you arrived, you knocked on the door softly. </p><p>It opened quickly and there stood Robb. &ldquo;I thought you weren&rsquo;t going to come.&rdquo; He said. &ldquo;When my future husband requests my presence, it would be rude not to come.&rdquo; You answered. </p><p>Robb smiled down at you before he moved aside to let you into the room. You removed your cloak due to the fire that was started in the fireplace. &ldquo;If you do not mind me asking, why did you ask me here?&rdquo; You asked facing him. </p><p>&ldquo;We never got a the opportunity to talk more before the feast.&rdquo; Robb answered. You sat on the edge of the bed as Robb sat next to you. It should have been an uncomfortable and awkward situation but it didn&rsquo;t feel as such to the both of you. </p><p>You talked for hours, telling each other every detail of each other&rsquo;s lives. It had only been a day and yet you felt like you&rsquo;ve known Robb your entire life. Of course you knew of each other but never on an intimate level.&nbsp;</p><p>Robb had been listening to you talk about growing up with all brothers, when he noticed that the sun was rising.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It looks like you have been here all night.&rdquo; He commented. Your eyes widened as you turned around to look out the window.&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, I am so sorry.&rdquo; You apologized standing up from the bed.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, really. I loved being able to talk to you. To get to know you.&rdquo; Robb said, following suit.&nbsp;</p><p>You picked up your cloak and wrapped it around your shoulders. Robb walked towards you and grabbed the strings and began to tie it closed for you.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve only known each other for a mere day and yet I have found myself completely enamored with you.&rdquo; He said. You looked up and smiled at him before you pressed a gentle kiss on his cheek.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m completely enamored with you as well.&rdquo; You whispered to him before turning to leave.&nbsp;</p><p>Robb watched you walk out, a smile forming on his face.&nbsp;<i>&lsquo;This will not be as bad as I thought.&rsquo;</i></p><p><b>**I&rsquo;m thinking of doing a part 2 to this, maybe a part 3.
