Enjoy!\n\n<!-- more --></p>\n<p>CHAPTER 10: So Long, Farewell</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve found a new owner for Ivy!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan stared at Sara. She stood there, huge smile on her face, looking from Dan to Phil and back to Dan again. She was obviously waiting for a response.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Phil said, his voice thick with disbelief and something else.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve found an owner!\u201d Sara repeated. She was still smiling, putting her hands on her hips in a self-assured manner. \u201cI know it took a while, but I finally found someone who is able to take proper care of her!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan was unable to do anything but stare at her. Beside him, Phil was quiet, too. Sara\u2019s smile faded, and she looked at both of them, concerned. \u201cAre you two okay?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan said, just because he felt like he should say something, not because it was the truth.</p>\n\n<p>Sara cocked her head to the side, regarding him with an odd gaze. \u201cDid I walk into something here?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dan said, unsure of what she actually meant. Next to him, Sammy growled and jumped off Phil\u2019s lap. Dan guessed Phil gripped the poor cat a bit too vigorously after the news.</p>\n\n<p>Dan swallowed \u2013 hard \u2013 and asked, \u201cWho did you find?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sara brightened a bit, but there was also something that passed across her face that Dan couldn\u2019t quite put. She sat down next to him and started to go into a detailed recounting of her hunt and the family she found.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe mum is staying at home, and the kids are just old enough to take Ivy out for walks, too. They all had a dog before, but he died a year ago. They feel they are now ready to give another pup a home.\u201d Sara paused, regarding Ivy, who took up residency right at her feet. Looking at her, Dan felt like even Ivy felt the tension that was in the room. Everyone but Sara seemed to have picked up on it.</p>\n\n<p>Sammy was sitting opposite all of them on the rug, watching them carefully. His tail was twitching, like he was just as tense as the rest of them. While Sara launched into an excited speech about how much Ivy would enjoy participating in dog training school, Dan dared to sneak a glance at Phil. Phil\u2019s lips were pressed into a tight line, his gaze trained on Ivy. He must\u2019ve felt Dan looking at him with concern, but he refused to look up. His hands were balled into fists. Dan\u2019s rarely seen Phil like this, and he didn\u2019t like it one bit.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOkay, guys, stop it already and tell me what\u2019s up.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan snapped his head up. Sara had her hands folded in front of her chest, looking at him sternly. \u201cSpill.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>What was Dan supposed to do? Tell her that he\u2019d come to love Ivy so much that now that the time has come to give her away for good, he was terrified and sad beyond belief? That he wanted to keep her, but didn\u2019t know how to do that? That he didn\u2019t feel like he would be able to take proper care of her, especially since Sara had managed to find the picture-perfect family that would be so much better equipped to look after Ivy than he would ever be. They probably even had a large backyard and lived somewhere in the country. Dan already hated them so much just for existing.</p>\n\n<p>But what was he to do? He\u2019d told Sara that he would look after Ivy for just long enough for her to find someone better; she had, and Dan\u2019s job was done now. And besides, he couldn\u2019t tell her that he wanted to keep Ivy so badly now that she didn\u2019t belong to him anymore.</p>\n\n<p>Or could he?</p>\n\n<p>Dan glanced back at Phil. This time, Phil met his gaze. Dan had known Phil for long enough to see everything that he needed on his face alone. Phil\u2019s lips were still pressed into a tight line, but his eyes were set with resolve.</p>\n\n<p>For the last couple of weeks, he and Dan had been able to take care of both a cat and a dog, and were (mostly) successful at that. Both pets were still alive (unlike most of their houseplants), and didn\u2019t seem malnourished or unhappy. Besides for Ivy needing a haircut, she was absolutely fine.</p>\n\n<p>Phil was the clumsiest person Dan knew, and he had to take care of that oaf more often than any one of them would like to admit. Phil was sometimes rash in his decisions, and also way too excited way too easily. Dan, on the other hand, would think thrice as much about any decision to make than any normal person out there and could hardly take care of himself when it came to his bad days.</p>\n\n<p>But then Dan thought of the almost ten years of friendship, and their joint projects, and how much they had managed to achieve together. How much Phil was looking after Dan when he wasn\u2019t up to do it himself, and how organized this bugger could be if he just wanted to. He thought about their channels, their book, their last tour, the tour to come. How could he have possibly missed that they had both achieved so much, and why the heck was he still so damn hesitant to do something that he absolutely wanted?</p>\n\n<p>Dan was, in that moment, utterly baffled by his own stupidity. He was also very grateful for Phil\u2019s friendship. Dan reminded himself that no, he didn\u2019t have to do anything on his own. He would always have Phil by his side, like he\u2019d had for the past ten years.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe want to keep her,\u201d Dan blurted out.</p>\n\n<p>Phil\u2019s eyes went wide, his mouth going slack. The question behind his eyes was clear, and Dan only gave him a small smile in response.</p>\n\n<p>Before Dan could say anything else, Sara gave a sigh and said, \u201cWell, finally, I thought I\u2019d have to go on for another hour.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan\u2019s head snapped around, looking at Sara in disbelief. He was sure Phil\u2019s face matched his own when he heard him say, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sara rolled her eyes at them. \u201cI thought I had to go on about the Brown\u2019s for another hour before you two decided that you would keep Ivy.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Again, Dan was completely unable to say anything and just blinked at her. Eventually, he managed to say, \u201cWhat the fuck, Sara?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sara just looked at him. Then she looked down at Ivy and reached down to scratch her ears. Ivy had been very still up until that moment, but she seemed to lose some of her own tension when Sara scratched that very specific spot right behind her left ear.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m not stupid, I know how much you fell in love with Ivy. You,\u201d she pointed at Dan, \u201cwouldn\u2019t stop sending me pictures of her, and you,\u201d she waved a hand at Phil, \u201cwere going on and on posting tweets about her last hijinks and spaming everyone\u2019s instagram with stories involving her. Honestly, I was waiting for you two to tell me that you wanted to keep her for over a week now.\u201d She cocks her head to the side, thinking about it. \u201cActually, since the last time I came to visit.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan just gaped at her. \u201cWhat about this family?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sara waved her hand dismissively at him. \u201cThey exist, but I haven\u2019t told them that they could have Ivy. I said I had other potential owners.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Dan asked.</p>\n\n<p>She looked up at that. \u201cWell, yes, you.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou utter&hellip;\u201d Dan began, but he was completely drowned by Phil, who had jumped up from the sofa and said, no, exclaimed, \u201cDoes that mean we can keep Ivy?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>She raised an eyebrow at Phil and gave him a Look. \u201cObviously.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Phil\u2019s squeal of joy was drowned in Sara\u2019s hair, as he had jumped in front of her and bent down to squeeze her tight.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAlright, your welcome, you can let go of me now,\u201d Sara said, her voice muffled by Phil\u2019s jumper.</p>\n\n<p>Phil let go of her, but the huge smile plastered across his face stayed. Dan just shook his head at him, but he couldn\u2019t hide the fond smile spreading across his own face.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIvy, did you hear that?\u201d Phil said and grabbed the dog, holding her up to his face. \u201cWe\u2019ll be your new daddies now! You can stay here!\u201d Ivy gave a happy bark, her tail swishing through the air.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t say daddies, that just sounds wrong,\u201d Dan said, rolling his eyes at Phil in exasperation, but he didn\u2019t really mean it. This dog was his precious little daughter now and no one could tell him otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>At that, Phil put Ivy down again and, to Dan\u2019s utter horror, bent down to envelope Dan in a tight hug. \u201cThank you,\u201d Phil said into Dan\u2019s ear.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYes yes,\u201d Dan said and shoved Phil off of him. \u201cDon\u2019t make me regret this.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Phil just grinned. \u201cI feel like we should have a celebratory drink!\u201d And with that Phil was off, followed closely by Ivy and Sammy. They were probably hungry for snacks.</p>\n\n<p>Dan looked over at Sara, and they both shook their heads in unison. \u201cThis guy is unbelievable,\u201d Dan said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAn unbelievable dork, but a happy one.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan laughed at this, but he sobered up quite quickly. He bit his lip. \u201cYou think this is okay?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sara sighed, but she gave him a sympathetic look. \u201cI know this feels weird, but I think you would hate yourself if you\u2019d gave up Ivy. I know she\u2019s a big responsibility. But I know you two are perfect for her, and she is perfect for you. You\u2019ll figure the rest out.\u201d She smiled at him, and Dan felt a bit better. Maybe she was right. \u201cAnd besides, she\u2019s been living with you for a few weeks now and she\u2019s still alive, so that\u2019s something.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t get to reply as Phil came back, carrying three glasses and a bottle of sparkling wine. Dan didn\u2019t know they actually had any.</p>\n\n<p>Ivy and Sammy barreled into the room after Phil, and Dan suspected that they\u2019d had a celebratory treat, too. They looked far too pleased, especially Sammy. Dan didn\u2019t mind that, though. Sammy would only stay with them for about another day, and being pampered a bit in that time seemed kinda appropriate. Dan would have to make sure that Ivy didn\u2019t overeat on treats, though. That posed a bit of a challenge, as Phil loved snacking and, as Dan had the pleasure of discovering over the last few weeks, didn\u2019t like to leave Ivy nor Sammy out when snacking himself.</p>\n\n<p>Phil put down the glasses and started pouring the drinks. Dan and Sara got up and walked over to him, accepting a glass each.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTo Ivy!\u201d Phil said and clinked his glass to Dan\u2019s and Sara\u2019s.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTo Ivy!\u201d Sara said, grinning at Phil. </p>\n\n<p>They all took a sip, and they all couldn\u2019t stop grinning down at the little dog, who had decided to sit right in the centre of their little circle.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYes Ivy, from now on you will be the centre of attention and you will probably hog all of our social media from now on,\u201d Dan said. \u201cI have to say I am looking forward to telling everyone that she\u2019ll stay with us.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe crowds will go wild.\u201d Sara laughed.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIs it just me or is this really disgusting,\u201d Phil said and pulled a face at his glass.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo, it is horrible,\u201d Dan said and took another sip.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh, I almost forgot!\u201d Sara thrust her glass into Dan\u2019s hand and began to rummage through her bag. She then pulled out a stack of what looked like photos. She took two and handed them over to Dan and Phil with an impossibly wide grin on her face. \u201cI hope you are not going on tour again next year!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan exchanged the glass with the card and looked at it. He had to take a double take before he looked up with a mix of surprise and joy. \u201cSave the date? You and Hannah are getting married?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYes!\u201d Sara said and jumped a little. \u201cShe asked me! We\u2019re getting married next year!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is great, congratulations!\u201d Dan said and enveloped her in a hug.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cCongrats!\u201d Phil held his glass up high. \u201cTo Sara and Hannah!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTo Sara and Hannah!\u201d Dan repeated and they all took another sip.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou are right, this stuff is vile,\u201d Sara said and shook herself.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cArf!\u201d Ivy barked and jumped up.</p>\n\n<p>Sara laughed and bent down to ruffle her head. \u201cLook how happy she is! I think you are going to have a great time here, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cArf!\u201d Ivy barked, and Dan wanted to believe that she agreed.</p>\n\n<p>It seemed strange, and somewhat unreal, but Dan felt like this decision might change his whole life. For better, most likely, but no one knew what the future held for each of them. No one could even know what tomorrow would bring. He was, however, glad that Ivy would share part of this journey called life with him and Phil. Hopefully they would all spent a long time together.</p>\n\n<p>Dan watched as Phil sat down on the floor and joined Sara in ruffling Ivy\u2019s fur. Dan smiled to himself. \u201cTo life,\u201d he said, just to himself, and took another sip of the godawful sparkly wine.</p>\n\n<p>*</p>\n\n<p>While Friday had been quite eventful, Saturday had been a quiet affair. Dan and Phil had spent it working on their tour while taking liberal breaks to either go for a walk with their dog (it still felt so unreal, but also so great every time Dan remembered it) or pat Sammy. Dan had made a point of being nice to Sammy, which he had been all along, but he felt like he needed Sammy to know that he would actually miss him when he was gone.</p>\n\n<p>Dan had known all along that Sammy couldn\u2019t stay, both because he probably belonged to someone else already, and because Phil was still very allergic. It wasn\u2019t as bad these days, but the meds just weren\u2019t meant to be a long term solution. Still, Dan had grown fond of Sammy, and he was sorry that he had to leave them. He was certain that not only Phil but Ivy would be devastated, too.</p>\n\n<p>Dan was sitting on the sofa pretending to work on his laptop while actually watching Ivy and Sammy play a weird version of catch. Sammy was lying on the floor, his tail twitching this way and that way, while Ivy, sitting a bit apart from him, tried to catch it with her paw. Every time she managed to swipe at it, Sammy, with lightning speed, swiped his paw at Ivy\u2019s ears. One could think that Sammy was just admonishing Ivy for playing with his tail, but when Ivy did manage to evade Sammy\u2019s paw, he would jump up and try to catch her, then go and sit back down, waiting for Ivy to catch his tail again. It was really adorable.</p>\n\n<p>Phil, who was sitting next to Dan and didn\u2019t even pretend to work anymore, had his phone out and filmed the game, giggling to himself the whole time.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou gonna put it on instagram?\u201d Dan asked, giving up and putting his laptop away.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Phil said.</p>\n\n<p>When hearing their voices, Ivy looked up, tongue rolling out of her snout and wagging her tail at them happily. Sammy looked up, too, but more like he wanted to find out who disturbed this very fun game of his.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh no, now they\u2019ve stopped,\u201d Phil grumbled.</p>\n\n<p>Dan leaned over to look at the footage Phil had managed to get and re-watched to see whether it was usable. It was almost five minutes long, and Phil had actually managed to get the best bits.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDid you even work on anything today?\u201d Dan said, raising an eyebrow at Phil. </p>\n\n<p>Phil looked a bit sheepish at that, but he still gave Dan a smug smile. \u201cSometimes, there are more important things.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan shook his head at his friend. He sat back again and pulled his phone from his pocket. He looked at the time. It was almost 3 pm.</p>\n\n<p>Dan put his phone away and opted to instead watch Phil upload a snippet of the video. They hadn\u2019t announced that they were keeping Ivy, but they planned to do a whole video on it. If they were going to have a new roommate from now on, they wanted to do it properly, and their audience would surely love more dog content. Dan couldn\u2019t quite believe that this was something that he could do from now on. He might as well stop doing any of his usual videos and just post live-updates on Ivy. Most people cared more about dogs than his whiny content anyway. <em>He</em> cared more about dogs than his whiny content.</p>\n\n<p>Dan suspected that he would soon become one of those Youtubers who had separate channels for their pets. He wouldn\u2019t regret it one bit.</p>\n\n<p>When the doorbell rang almost on the dot of the agreed time, all four of them pricked up their ears. Ivy had jumped up, her tail wagging madly. She was on her way to the door before Dan could even react properly.</p>\n\n<p>Sammy didn\u2019t look as interested, but he had gotten up as well and followed Ivy anyway, but at a much more sedate pace.</p>\n\n<p>Dan exchanged a sad look with Phil. They both sighed, then got up and went to open the door.</p>\n\n<p>Ivy and Sammy were already waiting there. Ivy probably thought that Sara was coming back for a surprise visit, or maybe she was just generally excited about visitors. Dan thought that if she knew who was coming to visit, she would be way less excited.</p>\n\n<p>They were all standing at the door, waiting for Kate to come upstairs. Phil was nervously shift from one foot to the other, while Dan had found a bit of string on his jumper and thread it around his fingers again and again. This was just agonizing.</p>\n\n<p>Then Kate came around the corner of the hallway, a small child in tow. She smiled brightly at Dan, who was standing at the door, and extended her hand in greeting. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Kate, you must be Dan?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Dan said and shook hands with her.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAnd this is my daughter Izzy. Say Hi Izzy,\u201d Kate said, nudging her daughter.</p>\n\n<p>Dan directed a small smile towards her, but Izzy just looked down at the floor and hid behind her mother.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, she is very shy,\u201d Kate said.</p>\n\n<p>Ivy chose that moment to wriggle between Dan\u2019s legs and get a good look at their visitors.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIvy, stay!\u201d Dan said, grabbing her by the collar and reeling her back in. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, our dog is very over-excited whenever we get visitors. Come in, please.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He tucked a very wriggly Ivy, who was eyeing Izzy curiously, under his arm and stepped back to let Kate in.</p>\n\n<p>While Dan closed the door and tried to make Ivy understand that she was not to jump on the small child and possibly scare her for life, Phil introduced himself.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cCan I get you something?\u201d Phil said, ever the great host.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo thank you, we won\u2019t be taking up too much of your time,\u201d Kate said.</p>\n\n<p>Phil just nodded, and Dan thought that maybe he was just stalling for time. Which was stupid because Sammy was sitting on the stairs, looking down at them imperiously. It reminded Dan a lot of that very first time he had encountered the cat. He could vividly remember those yellow eyes eyeing him up curiously. How he would miss that impossible cat.</p>\n\n<p>Kate had spotted Sammy, too. \u201cThere he is!\u201d she exclaimed, walking up to him to get a better look. \u201cIzzy, look!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Izzy, who had up until then eyed Phil with worry in her eyes, looked over at Sammy.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPirate!\u201d she said and ran over to the cat, forgetting everything else around her.</p>\n\n<p>Sammy \u2013 no, Pirate \u2013 didn\u2019t even twitch when Izzy threw her arms around him. He stayed almost eerily calm while she hugged him roughly. Dan had, over the past few weeks, never encountered Sammy (no, he simply couldn\u2019t rename him in those last few moments they had together) as patient towards anyone before. Maybe Izzy just had some kind of puppy-bonus.</p>\n\n<p>Kate stepped closer and examined Sammy. \u201cYou know, we adopted Pirate from a couple who used to live in this very building,\u201d she said and stepped back to look at Dan and Phil. \u201cHow did you find him?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cEr, I found him outside our door, and he wouldn\u2019t leave, so I let him in and he has been with us since,\u201d Phil explained.</p>\n\n<p>Kate nodded. \u201cHe probably got lost when he managed to escape our house and went back to where he used to live.\u201d She looked back at Sammy and Izzy and smiled. \u201cIzzy had been devastated. I\u2019m so glad you found him and took care of him. Thank you so much.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo worries,\u201d Dan said. \u201cActually, it was quite nice having him around.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Ivy, who simply couldn\u2019t hold still for more than five minutes, walked past Phil and Kate and up to Izzy and Sammy. She clearly wanted to get some cuddles, too, and sat down at Izzy\u2019s feet, looking up at her expectantly.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDid Pirate get along with your dog? I hope he didn\u2019t cause any trouble,\u201d Kate said and eyed Ivy a bit worriedly.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey became instant best friends,\u201d Phil said. He had an absentminded smile on his face that Dan could always spot when Phil was thinking about something funny. \u201cI think Ivy will be a bit sad about him leaving.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Izzy had let go of Sammy and looked down at Ivy suspiciously. Then, carefully, she extended one hand and placed it on Ivy\u2019s head. Ivy didn\u2019t move, but she wagged her tail more vigorously. Izzy got a bit bolder and patted Ivy.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGood doggy,\u201d she said with a smile. Dan had to admit, this tiny cute child sitting surrounded by a cat and a dog was about the epitome of cuteness.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSo&hellip;I guess this is it?\u201d Phil said. His voice was a bit softer than usual, which Dan immediately picked up on. Dan didn\u2019t really want to bring it up, but it was probably for the best to remove the plaster as fast as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Kate turned around to smile at him. \u201cYes, thank you, really.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>She stepped forward and gently pried Izzy from Sammy, grabbed the cat and put him in the carrier she had brought with her. Sammy just let all of it happen, like he got caught doing something very naughty and accepted his punishment. Although, going home wasn\u2019t a punishment per se, but to Dan it all felt like one.</p>\n\n<p>Dan glanced over at Phil and he looked just as crestfallen as he himself felt. Ivy, on the other hand, was still wagging her tail madly, but she was watching Kate and Sammy.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go and get Sammy chipped first thing in the morning,\u201d Kate said, putting the carrier on the floor and regarding Dan and Phil. \u201cBut we\u2019ll keep an eye on him, so I hope he won\u2019t bother you again.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHonestly, if that ever happens again, he\u2019s more than welcome. And we\u2019ll know who to contact then.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Kate smiled at both of them, then took Izzy\u2019s hand.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cCan I just&hellip;say goodbye?\u201d Phil asked timidly. Kate looked at him in surprise, which quickly turned into something apologetic.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Phil stepped up to the carrier and kneeled down on the floor in front of it. Dan followed suit. They both bumped their heads while trying to get a last glimpse of Sammy.</p>\n\n<p>Sammy was sitting calmly in his box, his huge yellow eyes regarding them carefully. He didn\u2019t seem sorry for leaving. But then again, he was a cat, and being taken from one can opener to the next didn\u2019t bother him much.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGoodbye, Sammy \u2013 I mean Pirate,\u201d Phil said, sticking one of his fingers through the bars of the door. \u201cBe nice.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah, don\u2019t go around stealing more bacon,\u201d Dan added with a smile, and Phil laughed.</p>\n\n<p>Ivy had wandered up to them and squeezed her head between Dan and Phil. She gave a sad kind of yapping. It immediately stirred Sammy. His ears pricked up, and he replied with his own meow.</p>\n\n<p>For some reason that was the tipping point for Dan. He quickly rubbed his sleeve over his stinging eyes and grabbed Ivy before she could make a scene.</p>\n\n<p>He got up, and Phil straightened up, too. Kate took the carrier, then nudged her daughter. \u201cSay bye to Dan and Phil, sweetpea.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Izzy looked up timidly. \u201cBye Mr Dan, bye Mr Phil.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan couldn\u2019t help but smile at her. \u201cBye Izzy. You take good care of Pirate?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said resolutely. \u201cThank you for looking after him.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Kate thanked them both at least ten times more before she and Izzy left. The whole time Ivy was wriggling and whimpering in Dan\u2019s arms. As soon as the door closed and Dan let go of Ivy, she promptly ran to the door, putting her paws up on it and whined.</p>\n\n<p>Dan had trouble keeping the tears at bay. He rubbed at his eyes with his sleeve again, hoping to pass it off as just wearily rubbing at his face. Which was a flimsy excuse, even to himself.</p>\n\n<p>He glanced over at Phil, who was rubbing at his face and trying to hide his tears as well. Dan couldn\u2019t help but grin a little. It was a sad grin, but he felt a bit better about not being the only one tearing up.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Dan asked.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Phil said, his voice thick. \u201cThis is the worst day.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan had to concede that Phil had a point. But then again, there was Ivy, sitting in front of the door and watching it like she expected Sammy to waltz back in any minute.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIvy won\u2019t go anywhere anytime soon,\u201d Dan pointed out.</p>\n\n<p>Phil sniffed, then whipped at his nose with his sleeve. \u201cHm.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Damnit this was depressing. Dan didn\u2019t imagine all of this to bum all three of them out so much; and for some reason, Dan didn\u2019t want this whole day to be ruined. They got Ivy now, so even though Sammy left a tiny cat-shaped hole in all of their hearts, Ivy was the one who would quickly fill it and make sure that Sammy wasn\u2019t gone, but remembered fondly. They couldn\u2019t do anything about it now anyway, except for feeling sorry for themselves, and Dan really didn\u2019t want to do that today.</p>\n\n<p>Which was, to his surprise, something he almost never thought before.</p>\n\n<p>And he really didn\u2019t like seeing neither Ivy nor Phil sad, so he said, \u201cHow about we grab our coats and drive out to the park for a big walk?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Phil sniffed again, then looked up at Dan. His eyes were watery, and his nose red. \u201cOnly if we can stop by Starbucks. I think I need a pumpkin spice latte.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey still do those in February?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThink so. I just need a Starbucks right now.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMe too, to be honest.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan walked over to the cabinet where they kept Ivy\u2019s leash. He grabbed it and waved it in Ivy\u2019s direction. \u201cIvy, let\u2019s go for a walk!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>She turned around, her eyes huge and sad, but her tail swished a bit when she spotted the leash.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll just go and change into something else,\u201d Phil said and disappeared up the stairs.</p>\n\n<p>Dan put on his shoes and coat, grabbed the doggy bags and selected a collection of balls to throw for Ivy. They already had way too many, but he suspected that their collection would grow exponentially from now on.</p>\n\n<p>It was weird to think that, when the year had started, all Dan could think about was the upcoming tour. He was still very preoccupied with that; there was so much to do, and Dan feared they wouldn\u2019t get through in time. He had never imagined that he would soon take care of a dog and cat, and he would have never thought that they would grow on him within just a few days. That he would actually adopt one of them would have made him laugh out loud if someone had told him at the start of the year. Now, though, he was just thankful. He was thankful that he got to experience this, and that he got to fall in love with this tiny dog, who in turn took him and Phil into her heart without a second thought.</p>\n\n<p>The best things, it seemed, happened without you planning them.</p>\n\n<p>And maybe that realization was why Dan felt a lot calmer these days, even considering the work they still had to get done for <em>Interactive Introverts</em>. Or the thought of what would come after it. It would all, Dan was sure, work out one way or another.</p>\n\n<p>Phil came back down the stairs. He slipped into his shoes, then regarded Dan. \u201cReady?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan put the leash on Ivy\u2019s collar. She jumped up and barked at him, obviously happy about their outing.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cReady,\u201d Dan said and all three left the flat.</p>",

She stood there, huge smile on her face, looking from Dan to Phil and back to Dan again. She was obviously waiting for a response.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Phil said, his voice thick with disbelief and something else.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve found an owner!\u201d Sara repeated. She was still smiling, putting her hands on her hips in a self-assured manner. \u201cI know it took a while, but I finally found someone who is able to take proper care of her!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan was unable to do anything but stare at her. Beside him, Phil was quiet, too. Sara\u2019s smile faded, and she looked at both of them, concerned. \u201cAre you two okay?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan said, just because he felt like he should say something, not because it was the truth.</p>\n\n<p>Sara cocked her head to the side, regarding him with an odd gaze. \u201cDid I walk into something here?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dan said, unsure of what she actually meant. Next to him, Sammy growled and jumped off Phil\u2019s lap. Dan guessed Phil gripped the poor cat a bit too vigorously after the news.</p>\n\n<p>Dan swallowed \u2013 hard \u2013 and asked, \u201cWho did you find?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sara brightened a bit, but there was also something that passed across her face that Dan couldn\u2019t quite put. She sat down next to him and started to go into a detailed recounting of her hunt and the family she found.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe mum is staying at home, and the kids are just old enough to take Ivy out for walks, too. They all had a dog before, but he died a year ago. They feel they are now ready to give another pup a home.\u201d Sara paused, regarding Ivy, who took up residency right at her feet. Looking at her, Dan felt like even Ivy felt the tension that was in the room. Everyone but Sara seemed to have picked up on it.</p>\n\n<p>Sammy was sitting opposite all of them on the rug, watching them carefully. His tail was twitching, like he was just as tense as the rest of them. While Sara launched into an excited speech about how much Ivy would enjoy participating in dog training school, Dan dared to sneak a glance at Phil. Phil\u2019s lips were pressed into a tight line, his gaze trained on Ivy. He must\u2019ve felt Dan looking at him with concern, but he refused to look up. His hands were balled into fists. Dan\u2019s rarely seen Phil like this, and he didn\u2019t like it one bit.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOkay, guys, stop it already and tell me what\u2019s up.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan snapped his head up. Sara had her hands folded in front of her chest, looking at him sternly. \u201cSpill.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>What was Dan supposed to do? Tell her that he\u2019d come to love Ivy so much that now that the time has come to give her away for good, he was terrified and sad beyond belief? That he wanted to keep her, but didn\u2019t know how to do that? That he didn\u2019t feel like he would be able to take proper care of her, especially since Sara had managed to find the picture-perfect family that would be so much better equipped to look after Ivy than he would ever be. They probably even had a large backyard and lived somewhere in the country. Dan already hated them so much just for existing.</p>\n\n<p>But what was he to do? He\u2019d told Sara that he would look after Ivy for just long enough for her to find someone better; she had, and Dan\u2019s job was done now. And besides, he couldn\u2019t tell her that he wanted to keep Ivy so badly now that she didn\u2019t belong to him anymore.</p>\n\n<p>Or could he?</p>\n\n<p>Dan glanced back at Phil. This time, Phil met his gaze. Dan had known Phil for long enough to see everything that he needed on his face alone. Phil\u2019s lips were still pressed into a tight line, but his eyes were set with resolve.</p>\n\n<p>For the last couple of weeks, he and Dan had been able to take care of both a cat and a dog, and were (mostly) successful at that. Both pets were still alive (unlike most of their houseplants), and didn\u2019t seem malnourished or unhappy. Besides for Ivy needing a haircut, she was absolutely fine.</p>\n\n<p>Phil was the clumsiest person Dan knew, and he had to take care of that oaf more often than any one of them would like to admit. Phil was sometimes rash in his decisions, and also way too excited way too easily. Dan, on the other hand, would think thrice as much about any decision to make than any normal person out there and could hardly take care of himself when it came to his bad days.</p>\n\n<p>But then Dan thought of the almost ten years of friendship, and their joint projects, and how much they had managed to achieve together. How much Phil was looking after Dan when he wasn\u2019t up to do it himself, and how organized this bugger could be if he just wanted to. He thought about their channels, their book, their last tour, the tour to come. How could he have possibly missed that they had both achieved so much, and why the heck was he still so damn hesitant to do something that he absolutely wanted?</p>\n\n<p>Dan was, in that moment, utterly baffled by his own stupidity. He was also very grateful for Phil\u2019s friendship. Dan reminded himself that no, he didn\u2019t have to do anything on his own. He would always have Phil by his side, like he\u2019d had for the past ten years.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe want to keep her,\u201d Dan blurted out.</p>\n\n<p>Phil\u2019s eyes went wide, his mouth going slack. The question behind his eyes was clear, and Dan only gave him a small smile in response.</p>\n\n<p>Before Dan could say anything else, Sara gave a sigh and said, \u201cWell, finally, I thought I\u2019d have to go on for another hour.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan\u2019s head snapped around, looking at Sara in disbelief. He was sure Phil\u2019s face matched his own when he heard him say, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sara rolled her eyes at them. \u201cI thought I had to go on about the Brown\u2019s for another hour before you two decided that you would keep Ivy.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Again, Dan was completely unable to say anything and just blinked at her. Eventually, he managed to say, \u201cWhat the fuck, Sara?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sara just looked at him. Then she looked down at Ivy and reached down to scratch her ears. Ivy had been very still up until that moment, but she seemed to lose some of her own tension when Sara scratched that very specific spot right behind her left ear.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m not stupid, I know how much you fell in love with Ivy. You,\u201d she pointed at Dan, \u201cwouldn\u2019t stop sending me pictures of her, and you,\u201d she waved a hand at Phil, \u201cwere going on and on posting tweets about her last hijinks and spaming everyone\u2019s instagram with stories involving her. Honestly, I was waiting for you two to tell me that you wanted to keep her for over a week now.\u201d She cocks her head to the side, thinking about it. \u201cActually, since the last time I came to visit.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan just gaped at her. \u201cWhat about this family?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sara waved her hand dismissively at him. \u201cThey exist, but I haven\u2019t told them that they could have Ivy. I said I had other potential owners.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Dan asked.</p>\n\n<p>She looked up at that. \u201cWell, yes, you.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou utter\u2026\u201d Dan began, but he was completely drowned by Phil, who had jumped up from the sofa and said, no, exclaimed, \u201cDoes that mean we can keep Ivy?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>She raised an eyebrow at Phil and gave him a Look. \u201cObviously.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Phil\u2019s squeal of joy was drowned in Sara\u2019s hair, as he had jumped in front of her and bent down to squeeze her tight.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAlright, your welcome, you can let go of me now,\u201d Sara said, her voice muffled by Phil\u2019s jumper.</p>\n\n<p>Phil let go of her, but the huge smile plastered across his face stayed. Dan just shook his head at him, but he couldn\u2019t hide the fond smile spreading across his own face.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIvy, did you hear that?\u201d Phil said and grabbed the dog, holding her up to his face. \u201cWe\u2019ll be your new daddies now! You can stay here!\u201d Ivy gave a happy bark, her tail swishing through the air.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t say daddies, that just sounds wrong,\u201d Dan said, rolling his eyes at Phil in exasperation, but he didn\u2019t really mean it. This dog was his precious little daughter now and no one could tell him otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>At that, Phil put Ivy down again and, to Dan\u2019s utter horror, bent down to envelope Dan in a tight hug. \u201cThank you,\u201d Phil said into Dan\u2019s ear.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYes yes,\u201d Dan said and shoved Phil off of him. \u201cDon\u2019t make me regret this.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Phil just grinned. \u201cI feel like we should have a celebratory drink!\u201d And with that Phil was off, followed closely by Ivy and Sammy. They were probably hungry for snacks.</p>\n\n<p>Dan looked over at Sara, and they both shook their heads in unison. \u201cThis guy is unbelievable,\u201d Dan said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAn unbelievable dork, but a happy one.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan laughed at this, but he sobered up quite quickly. He bit his lip. \u201cYou think this is okay?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sara sighed, but she gave him a sympathetic look. \u201cI know this feels weird, but I think you would hate yourself if you\u2019d gave up Ivy. I know she\u2019s a big responsibility. But I know you two are perfect for her, and she is perfect for you. You\u2019ll figure the rest out.\u201d She smiled at him, and Dan felt a bit better. Maybe she was right. \u201cAnd besides, she\u2019s been living with you for a few weeks now and she\u2019s still alive, so that\u2019s something.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t get to reply as Phil came back, carrying three glasses and a bottle of sparkling wine. Dan didn\u2019t know they actually had any.</p>\n\n<p>Ivy and Sammy barreled into the room after Phil, and Dan suspected that they\u2019d had a celebratory treat, too. They looked far too pleased, especially Sammy. Dan didn\u2019t mind that, though. Sammy would only stay with them for about another day, and being pampered a bit in that time seemed kinda appropriate. Dan would have to make sure that Ivy didn\u2019t overeat on treats, though. That posed a bit of a challenge, as Phil loved snacking and, as Dan had the pleasure of discovering over the last few weeks, didn\u2019t like to leave Ivy nor Sammy out when snacking himself.</p>\n\n<p>Phil put down the glasses and started pouring the drinks. Dan and Sara got up and walked over to him, accepting a glass each.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTo Ivy!\u201d Phil said and clinked his glass to Dan\u2019s and Sara\u2019s.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTo Ivy!\u201d Sara said, grinning at Phil. </p>\n\n<p>They all took a sip, and they all couldn\u2019t stop grinning down at the little dog, who had decided to sit right in the centre of their little circle.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYes Ivy, from now on you will be the centre of attention and you will probably hog all of our social media from now on,\u201d Dan said. \u201cI have to say I am looking forward to telling everyone that she\u2019ll stay with us.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe crowds will go wild.\u201d Sara laughed.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIs it just me or is this really disgusting,\u201d Phil said and pulled a face at his glass.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo, it is horrible,\u201d Dan said and took another sip.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh, I almost forgot!\u201d Sara thrust her glass into Dan\u2019s hand and began to rummage through her bag. She then pulled out a stack of what looked like photos. She took two and handed them over to Dan and Phil with an impossibly wide grin on her face. \u201cI hope you are not going on tour again next year!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan exchanged the glass with the card and looked at it. He had to take a double take before he looked up with a mix of surprise and joy. \u201cSave the date? You and Hannah are getting married?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYes!\u201d Sara said and jumped a little. \u201cShe asked me! We\u2019re getting married next year!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is great, congratulations!\u201d Dan said and enveloped her in a hug.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cCongrats!\u201d Phil held his glass up high. \u201cTo Sara and Hannah!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTo Sara and Hannah!\u201d Dan repeated and they all took another sip.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou are right, this stuff is vile,\u201d Sara said and shook herself.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cArf!\u201d Ivy barked and jumped up.</p>\n\n<p>Sara laughed and bent down to ruffle her head. \u201cLook how happy she is! I think you are going to have a great time here, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cArf!\u201d Ivy barked, and Dan wanted to believe that she agreed.</p>\n\n<p>It seemed strange, and somewhat unreal, but Dan felt like this decision might change his whole life. For better, most likely, but no one knew what the future held for each of them. No one could even know what tomorrow would bring. He was, however, glad that Ivy would share part of this journey called life with him and Phil. Hopefully they would all spent a long time together.</p>\n\n<p>Dan watched as Phil sat down on the floor and joined Sara in ruffling Ivy\u2019s fur. Dan smiled to himself. \u201cTo life,\u201d he said, just to himself, and took another sip of the godawful sparkly wine.</p>\n\n<p>*</p>\n\n<p>While Friday had been quite eventful, Saturday had been a quiet affair. Dan and Phil had spent it working on their tour while taking liberal breaks to either go for a walk with their dog (it still felt so unreal, but also so great every time Dan remembered it) or pat Sammy. Dan had made a point of being nice to Sammy, which he had been all along, but he felt like he needed Sammy to know that he would actually miss him when he was gone.</p>\n\n<p>Dan had known all along that Sammy couldn\u2019t stay, both because he probably belonged to someone else already, and because Phil was still very allergic. It wasn\u2019t as bad these days, but the meds just weren\u2019t meant to be a long term solution. Still, Dan had grown fond of Sammy, and he was sorry that he had to leave them. He was certain that not only Phil but Ivy would be devastated, too.</p>\n\n<p>Dan was sitting on the sofa pretending to work on his laptop while actually watching Ivy and Sammy play a weird version of catch. Sammy was lying on the floor, his tail twitching this way and that way, while Ivy, sitting a bit apart from him, tried to catch it with her paw. Every time she managed to swipe at it, Sammy, with lightning speed, swiped his paw at Ivy\u2019s ears. One could think that Sammy was just admonishing Ivy for playing with his tail, but when Ivy did manage to evade Sammy\u2019s paw, he would jump up and try to catch her, then go and sit back down, waiting for Ivy to catch his tail again. It was really adorable.</p>\n\n<p>Phil, who was sitting next to Dan and didn\u2019t even pretend to work anymore, had his phone out and filmed the game, giggling to himself the whole time.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou gonna put it on instagram?\u201d Dan asked, giving up and putting his laptop away.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Phil said.</p>\n\n<p>When hearing their voices, Ivy looked up, tongue rolling out of her snout and wagging her tail at them happily. Sammy looked up, too, but more like he wanted to find out who disturbed this very fun game of his.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh no, now they\u2019ve stopped,\u201d Phil grumbled.</p>\n\n<p>Dan leaned over to look at the footage Phil had managed to get and re-watched to see whether it was usable. It was almost five minutes long, and Phil had actually managed to get the best bits.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDid you even work on anything today?\u201d Dan said, raising an eyebrow at Phil. </p>\n\n<p>Phil looked a bit sheepish at that, but he still gave Dan a smug smile. \u201cSometimes, there are more important things.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan shook his head at his friend. He sat back again and pulled his phone from his pocket. He looked at the time. It was almost 3 pm.</p>\n\n<p>Dan put his phone away and opted to instead watch Phil upload a snippet of the video. They hadn\u2019t announced that they were keeping Ivy, but they planned to do a whole video on it. If they were going to have a new roommate from now on, they wanted to do it properly, and their audience would surely love more dog content. Dan couldn\u2019t quite believe that this was something that he could do from now on. He might as well stop doing any of his usual videos and just post live-updates on Ivy. Most people cared more about dogs than his whiny content anyway. <em>He</em> cared more about dogs than his whiny content.</p>\n\n<p>Dan suspected that he would soon become one of those Youtubers who had separate channels for their pets. He wouldn\u2019t regret it one bit.</p>\n\n<p>When the doorbell rang almost on the dot of the agreed time, all four of them pricked up their ears. Ivy had jumped up, her tail wagging madly. She was on her way to the door before Dan could even react properly.</p>\n\n<p>Sammy didn\u2019t look as interested, but he had gotten up as well and followed Ivy anyway, but at a much more sedate pace.</p>\n\n<p>Dan exchanged a sad look with Phil. They both sighed, then got up and went to open the door.</p>\n\n<p>Ivy and Sammy were already waiting there. Ivy probably thought that Sara was coming back for a surprise visit, or maybe she was just generally excited about visitors. Dan thought that if she knew who was coming to visit, she would be way less excited.</p>\n\n<p>They were all standing at the door, waiting for Kate to come upstairs. Phil was nervously shift from one foot to the other, while Dan had found a bit of string on his jumper and thread it around his fingers again and again. This was just agonizing.</p>\n\n<p>Then Kate came around the corner of the hallway, a small child in tow. She smiled brightly at Dan, who was standing at the door, and extended her hand in greeting. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Kate, you must be Dan?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Dan said and shook hands with her.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAnd this is my daughter Izzy. Say Hi Izzy,\u201d Kate said, nudging her daughter.</p>\n\n<p>Dan directed a small smile towards her, but Izzy just looked down at the floor and hid behind her mother.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, she is very shy,\u201d Kate said.</p>\n\n<p>Ivy chose that moment to wriggle between Dan\u2019s legs and get a good look at their visitors.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIvy, stay!\u201d Dan said, grabbing her by the collar and reeling her back in. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, our dog is very over-excited whenever we get visitors. Come in, please.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He tucked a very wriggly Ivy, who was eyeing Izzy curiously, under his arm and stepped back to let Kate in.</p>\n\n<p>While Dan closed the door and tried to make Ivy understand that she was not to jump on the small child and possibly scare her for life, Phil introduced himself.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cCan I get you something?\u201d Phil said, ever the great host.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo thank you, we won\u2019t be taking up too much of your time,\u201d Kate said.</p>\n\n<p>Phil just nodded, and Dan thought that maybe he was just stalling for time. Which was stupid because Sammy was sitting on the stairs, looking down at them imperiously. It reminded Dan a lot of that very first time he had encountered the cat. He could vividly remember those yellow eyes eyeing him up curiously. How he would miss that impossible cat.</p>\n\n<p>Kate had spotted Sammy, too. \u201cThere he is!\u201d she exclaimed, walking up to him to get a better look. \u201cIzzy, look!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Izzy, who had up until then eyed Phil with worry in her eyes, looked over at Sammy.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPirate!\u201d she said and ran over to the cat, forgetting everything else around her.</p>\n\n<p>Sammy \u2013 no, Pirate \u2013 didn\u2019t even twitch when Izzy threw her arms around him. He stayed almost eerily calm while she hugged him roughly. Dan had, over the past few weeks, never encountered Sammy (no, he simply couldn\u2019t rename him in those last few moments they had together) as patient towards anyone before. Maybe Izzy just had some kind of puppy-bonus.</p>\n\n<p>Kate stepped closer and examined Sammy. \u201cYou know, we adopted Pirate from a couple who used to live in this very building,\u201d she said and stepped back to look at Dan and Phil. \u201cHow did you find him?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cEr, I found him outside our door, and he wouldn\u2019t leave, so I let him in and he has been with us since,\u201d Phil explained.</p>\n\n<p>Kate nodded. \u201cHe probably got lost when he managed to escape our house and went back to where he used to live.\u201d She looked back at Sammy and Izzy and smiled. \u201cIzzy had been devastated. I\u2019m so glad you found him and took care of him. Thank you so much.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo worries,\u201d Dan said. \u201cActually, it was quite nice having him around.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Ivy, who simply couldn\u2019t hold still for more than five minutes, walked past Phil and Kate and up to Izzy and Sammy. She clearly wanted to get some cuddles, too, and sat down at Izzy\u2019s feet, looking up at her expectantly.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDid Pirate get along with your dog? I hope he didn\u2019t cause any trouble,\u201d Kate said and eyed Ivy a bit worriedly.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey became instant best friends,\u201d Phil said. He had an absentminded smile on his face that Dan could always spot when Phil was thinking about something funny. \u201cI think Ivy will be a bit sad about him leaving.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Izzy had let go of Sammy and looked down at Ivy suspiciously. Then, carefully, she extended one hand and placed it on Ivy\u2019s head. Ivy didn\u2019t move, but she wagged her tail more vigorously. Izzy got a bit bolder and patted Ivy.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGood doggy,\u201d she said with a smile. Dan had to admit, this tiny cute child sitting surrounded by a cat and a dog was about the epitome of cuteness.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026I guess this is it?\u201d Phil said. His voice was a bit softer than usual, which Dan immediately picked up on. Dan didn\u2019t really want to bring it up, but it was probably for the best to remove the plaster as fast as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Kate turned around to smile at him. \u201cYes, thank you, really.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>She stepped forward and gently pried Izzy from Sammy, grabbed the cat and put him in the carrier she had brought with her. Sammy just let all of it happen, like he got caught doing something very naughty and accepted his punishment. Although, going home wasn\u2019t a punishment per se, but to Dan it all felt like one.</p>\n\n<p>Dan glanced over at Phil and he looked just as crestfallen as he himself felt. Ivy, on the other hand, was still wagging her tail madly, but she was watching Kate and Sammy.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go and get Sammy chipped first thing in the morning,\u201d Kate said, putting the carrier on the floor and regarding Dan and Phil. \u201cBut we\u2019ll keep an eye on him, so I hope he won\u2019t bother you again.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHonestly, if that ever happens again, he\u2019s more than welcome. And we\u2019ll know who to contact then.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Kate smiled at both of them, then took Izzy\u2019s hand.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cCan I just\u2026say goodbye?\u201d Phil asked timidly. Kate looked at him in surprise, which quickly turned into something apologetic.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Phil stepped up to the carrier and kneeled down on the floor in front of it. Dan followed suit. They both bumped their heads while trying to get a last glimpse of Sammy.</p>\n\n<p>Sammy was sitting calmly in his box, his huge yellow eyes regarding them carefully. He didn\u2019t seem sorry for leaving. But then again, he was a cat, and being taken from one can opener to the next didn\u2019t bother him much.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGoodbye, Sammy \u2013 I mean Pirate,\u201d Phil said, sticking one of his fingers through the bars of the door. \u201cBe nice.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah, don\u2019t go around stealing more bacon,\u201d Dan added with a smile, and Phil laughed.</p>\n\n<p>Ivy had wandered up to them and squeezed her head between Dan and Phil. She gave a sad kind of yapping. It immediately stirred Sammy. His ears pricked up, and he replied with his own meow.</p>\n\n<p>For some reason that was the tipping point for Dan. He quickly rubbed his sleeve over his stinging eyes and grabbed Ivy before she could make a scene.</p>\n\n<p>He got up, and Phil straightened up, too. Kate took the carrier, then nudged her daughter. \u201cSay bye to Dan and Phil, sweetpea.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Izzy looked up timidly. \u201cBye Mr Dan, bye Mr Phil.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan couldn\u2019t help but smile at her. \u201cBye Izzy. You take good care of Pirate?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said resolutely. \u201cThank you for looking after him.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Kate thanked them both at least ten times more before she and Izzy left. The whole time Ivy was wriggling and whimpering in Dan\u2019s arms. As soon as the door closed and Dan let go of Ivy, she promptly ran to the door, putting her paws up on it and whined.</p>\n\n<p>Dan had trouble keeping the tears at bay. He rubbed at his eyes with his sleeve again, hoping to pass it off as just wearily rubbing at his face. Which was a flimsy excuse, even to himself.</p>\n\n<p>He glanced over at Phil, who was rubbing at his face and trying to hide his tears as well. Dan couldn\u2019t help but grin a little. It was a sad grin, but he felt a bit better about not being the only one tearing up.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Dan asked.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Phil said, his voice thick. \u201cThis is the worst day.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan had to concede that Phil had a point. But then again, there was Ivy, sitting in front of the door and watching it like she expected Sammy to waltz back in any minute.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIvy won\u2019t go anywhere anytime soon,\u201d Dan pointed out.</p>\n\n<p>Phil sniffed, then whipped at his nose with his sleeve. \u201cHm.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Damnit this was depressing. Dan didn\u2019t imagine all of this to bum all three of them out so much; and for some reason, Dan didn\u2019t want this whole day to be ruined. They got Ivy now, so even though Sammy left a tiny cat-shaped hole in all of their hearts, Ivy was the one who would quickly fill it and make sure that Sammy wasn\u2019t gone, but remembered fondly. They couldn\u2019t do anything about it now anyway, except for feeling sorry for themselves, and Dan really didn\u2019t want to do that today.</p>\n\n<p>Which was, to his surprise, something he almost never thought before.</p>\n\n<p>And he really didn\u2019t like seeing neither Ivy nor Phil sad, so he said, \u201cHow about we grab our coats and drive out to the park for a big walk?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Phil sniffed again, then looked up at Dan. His eyes were watery, and his nose red. \u201cOnly if we can stop by Starbucks. I think I need a pumpkin spice latte.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey still do those in February?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThink so. I just need a Starbucks right now.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMe too, to be honest.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan walked over to the cabinet where they kept Ivy\u2019s leash. He grabbed it and waved it in Ivy\u2019s direction. \u201cIvy, let\u2019s go for a walk!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>She turned around, her eyes huge and sad, but her tail swished a bit when she spotted the leash.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll just go and change into something else,\u201d Phil said and disappeared up the stairs.</p>\n\n<p>Dan put on his shoes and coat, grabbed the doggy bags and selected a collection of balls to throw for Ivy. They already had way too many, but he suspected that their collection would grow exponentially from now on.</p>\n\n<p>It was weird to think that, when the year had started, all Dan could think about was the upcoming tour. He was still very preoccupied with that; there was so much to do, and Dan feared they wouldn\u2019t get through in time. He had never imagined that he would soon take care of a dog and cat, and he would have never thought that they would grow on him within just a few days. That he would actually adopt one of them would have made him laugh out loud if someone had told him at the start of the year. Now, though, he was just thankful. He was thankful that he got to experience this, and that he got to fall in love with this tiny dog, who in turn took him and Phil into her heart without a second thought.</p>\n\n<p>The best things, it seemed, happened without you planning them.</p>\n\n<p>And maybe that realization was why Dan felt a lot calmer these days, even considering the work they still had to get done for <em>Interactive Introverts</em>. Or the thought of what would come after it. It would all, Dan was sure, work out one way or another.</p>\n\n<p>Phil came back down the stairs. He slipped into his shoes, then regarded Dan. \u201cReady?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan put the leash on Ivy\u2019s collar. She jumped up and barked at him, obviously happy about their outing.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cReady,\u201d Dan said and all three left the flat.</p></p>",

Enjoy!\n\n[[MORE]]</p>\n<p>CHAPTER 10: So Long, Farewell</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve found a new owner for Ivy!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan stared at Sara. She stood there, huge smile on her face, looking from Dan to Phil and back to Dan again. She was obviously waiting for a response.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Phil said, his voice thick with disbelief and something else.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve found an owner!\u201d Sara repeated. She was still smiling, putting her hands on her hips in a self-assured manner. \u201cI know it took a while, but I finally found someone who is able to take proper care of her!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan was unable to do anything but stare at her. Beside him, Phil was quiet, too. Sara\u2019s smile faded, and she looked at both of them, concerned. \u201cAre you two okay?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan said, just because he felt like he should say something, not because it was the truth.</p>\n\n<p>Sara cocked her head to the side, regarding him with an odd gaze. \u201cDid I walk into something here?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dan said, unsure of what she actually meant. Next to him, Sammy growled and jumped off Phil\u2019s lap. Dan guessed Phil gripped the poor cat a bit too vigorously after the news.</p>\n\n<p>Dan swallowed \u2013 hard \u2013 and asked, \u201cWho did you find?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sara brightened a bit, but there was also something that passed across her face that Dan couldn\u2019t quite put. She sat down next to him and started to go into a detailed recounting of her hunt and the family she found.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe mum is staying at home, and the kids are just old enough to take Ivy out for walks, too. They all had a dog before, but he died a year ago. They feel they are now ready to give another pup a home.\u201d Sara paused, regarding Ivy, who took up residency right at her feet. Looking at her, Dan felt like even Ivy felt the tension that was in the room. Everyone but Sara seemed to have picked up on it.</p>\n\n<p>Sammy was sitting opposite all of them on the rug, watching them carefully. His tail was twitching, like he was just as tense as the rest of them. While Sara launched into an excited speech about how much Ivy would enjoy participating in dog training school, Dan dared to sneak a glance at Phil. Phil\u2019s lips were pressed into a tight line, his gaze trained on Ivy. He must\u2019ve felt Dan looking at him with concern, but he refused to look up. His hands were balled into fists. Dan\u2019s rarely seen Phil like this, and he didn\u2019t like it one bit.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOkay, guys, stop it already and tell me what\u2019s up.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan snapped his head up. Sara had her hands folded in front of her chest, looking at him sternly. \u201cSpill.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>What was Dan supposed to do? Tell her that he\u2019d come to love Ivy so much that now that the time has come to give her away for good, he was terrified and sad beyond belief? That he wanted to keep her, but didn\u2019t know how to do that? That he didn\u2019t feel like he would be able to take proper care of her, especially since Sara had managed to find the picture-perfect family that would be so much better equipped to look after Ivy than he would ever be. They probably even had a large backyard and lived somewhere in the country. Dan already hated them so much just for existing.</p>\n\n<p>But what was he to do? He\u2019d told Sara that he would look after Ivy for just long enough for her to find someone better; she had, and Dan\u2019s job was done now. And besides, he couldn\u2019t tell her that he wanted to keep Ivy so badly now that she didn\u2019t belong to him anymore.</p>\n\n<p>Or could he?</p>\n\n<p>Dan glanced back at Phil. This time, Phil met his gaze. Dan had known Phil for long enough to see everything that he needed on his face alone. Phil\u2019s lips were still pressed into a tight line, but his eyes were set with resolve.</p>\n\n<p>For the last couple of weeks, he and Dan had been able to take care of both a cat and a dog, and were (mostly) successful at that. Both pets were still alive (unlike most of their houseplants), and didn\u2019t seem malnourished or unhappy. Besides for Ivy needing a haircut, she was absolutely fine.</p>\n\n<p>Phil was the clumsiest person Dan knew, and he had to take care of that oaf more often than any one of them would like to admit. Phil was sometimes rash in his decisions, and also way too excited way too easily. Dan, on the other hand, would think thrice as much about any decision to make than any normal person out there and could hardly take care of himself when it came to his bad days.</p>\n\n<p>But then Dan thought of the almost ten years of friendship, and their joint projects, and how much they had managed to achieve together. How much Phil was looking after Dan when he wasn\u2019t up to do it himself, and how organized this bugger could be if he just wanted to. He thought about their channels, their book, their last tour, the tour to come. How could he have possibly missed that they had both achieved so much, and why the heck was he still so damn hesitant to do something that he absolutely wanted?</p>\n\n<p>Dan was, in that moment, utterly baffled by his own stupidity. He was also very grateful for Phil\u2019s friendship. Dan reminded himself that no, he didn\u2019t have to do anything on his own. He would always have Phil by his side, like he\u2019d had for the past ten years.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe want to keep her,\u201d Dan blurted out.</p>\n\n<p>Phil\u2019s eyes went wide, his mouth going slack. The question behind his eyes was clear, and Dan only gave him a small smile in response.</p>\n\n<p>Before Dan could say anything else, Sara gave a sigh and said, \u201cWell, finally, I thought I\u2019d have to go on for another hour.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan\u2019s head snapped around, looking at Sara in disbelief. He was sure Phil\u2019s face matched his own when he heard him say, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sara rolled her eyes at them. \u201cI thought I had to go on about the Brown\u2019s for another hour before you two decided that you would keep Ivy.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Again, Dan was completely unable to say anything and just blinked at her. Eventually, he managed to say, \u201cWhat the fuck, Sara?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sara just looked at him. Then she looked down at Ivy and reached down to scratch her ears. Ivy had been very still up until that moment, but she seemed to lose some of her own tension when Sara scratched that very specific spot right behind her left ear.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m not stupid, I know how much you fell in love with Ivy. You,\u201d she pointed at Dan, \u201cwouldn\u2019t stop sending me pictures of her, and you,\u201d she waved a hand at Phil, \u201cwere going on and on posting tweets about her last hijinks and spaming everyone\u2019s instagram with stories involving her. Honestly, I was waiting for you two to tell me that you wanted to keep her for over a week now.\u201d She cocks her head to the side, thinking about it. \u201cActually, since the last time I came to visit.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan just gaped at her. \u201cWhat about this family?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sara waved her hand dismissively at him. \u201cThey exist, but I haven\u2019t told them that they could have Ivy. I said I had other potential owners.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Dan asked.</p>\n\n<p>She looked up at that. \u201cWell, yes, you.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou utter\u2026\u201d Dan began, but he was completely drowned by Phil, who had jumped up from the sofa and said, no, exclaimed, \u201cDoes that mean we can keep Ivy?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>She raised an eyebrow at Phil and gave him a Look. \u201cObviously.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Phil\u2019s squeal of joy was drowned in Sara\u2019s hair, as he had jumped in front of her and bent down to squeeze her tight.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAlright, your welcome, you can let go of me now,\u201d Sara said, her voice muffled by Phil\u2019s jumper.</p>\n\n<p>Phil let go of her, but the huge smile plastered across his face stayed. Dan just shook his head at him, but he couldn\u2019t hide the fond smile spreading across his own face.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIvy, did you hear that?\u201d Phil said and grabbed the dog, holding her up to his face. \u201cWe\u2019ll be your new daddies now! You can stay here!\u201d Ivy gave a happy bark, her tail swishing through the air.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t say daddies, that just sounds wrong,\u201d Dan said, rolling his eyes at Phil in exasperation, but he didn\u2019t really mean it. This dog was his precious little daughter now and no one could tell him otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>At that, Phil put Ivy down again and, to Dan\u2019s utter horror, bent down to envelope Dan in a tight hug. \u201cThank you,\u201d Phil said into Dan\u2019s ear.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYes yes,\u201d Dan said and shoved Phil off of him. \u201cDon\u2019t make me regret this.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Phil just grinned. \u201cI feel like we should have a celebratory drink!\u201d And with that Phil was off, followed closely by Ivy and Sammy. They were probably hungry for snacks.</p>\n\n<p>Dan looked over at Sara, and they both shook their heads in unison. \u201cThis guy is unbelievable,\u201d Dan said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAn unbelievable dork, but a happy one.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan laughed at this, but he sobered up quite quickly. He bit his lip. \u201cYou think this is okay?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sara sighed, but she gave him a sympathetic look. \u201cI know this feels weird, but I think you would hate yourself if you\u2019d gave up Ivy. I know she\u2019s a big responsibility. But I know you two are perfect for her, and she is perfect for you. You\u2019ll figure the rest out.\u201d She smiled at him, and Dan felt a bit better. Maybe she was right. \u201cAnd besides, she\u2019s been living with you for a few weeks now and she\u2019s still alive, so that\u2019s something.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t get to reply as Phil came back, carrying three glasses and a bottle of sparkling wine. Dan didn\u2019t know they actually had any.</p>\n\n<p>Ivy and Sammy barreled into the room after Phil, and Dan suspected that they\u2019d had a celebratory treat, too. They looked far too pleased, especially Sammy. Dan didn\u2019t mind that, though. Sammy would only stay with them for about another day, and being pampered a bit in that time seemed kinda appropriate. Dan would have to make sure that Ivy didn\u2019t overeat on treats, though. That posed a bit of a challenge, as Phil loved snacking and, as Dan had the pleasure of discovering over the last few weeks, didn\u2019t like to leave Ivy nor Sammy out when snacking himself.</p>\n\n<p>Phil put down the glasses and started pouring the drinks. Dan and Sara got up and walked over to him, accepting a glass each.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTo Ivy!\u201d Phil said and clinked his glass to Dan\u2019s and Sara\u2019s.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTo Ivy!\u201d Sara said, grinning at Phil. </p>\n\n<p>They all took a sip, and they all couldn\u2019t stop grinning down at the little dog, who had decided to sit right in the centre of their little circle.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYes Ivy, from now on you will be the centre of attention and you will probably hog all of our social media from now on,\u201d Dan said. \u201cI have to say I am looking forward to telling everyone that she\u2019ll stay with us.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe crowds will go wild.\u201d Sara laughed.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIs it just me or is this really disgusting,\u201d Phil said and pulled a face at his glass.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo, it is horrible,\u201d Dan said and took another sip.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh, I almost forgot!\u201d Sara thrust her glass into Dan\u2019s hand and began to rummage through her bag. She then pulled out a stack of what looked like photos. She took two and handed them over to Dan and Phil with an impossibly wide grin on her face. \u201cI hope you are not going on tour again next year!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan exchanged the glass with the card and looked at it. He had to take a double take before he looked up with a mix of surprise and joy. \u201cSave the date? You and Hannah are getting married?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYes!\u201d Sara said and jumped a little. \u201cShe asked me! We\u2019re getting married next year!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is great, congratulations!\u201d Dan said and enveloped her in a hug.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cCongrats!\u201d Phil held his glass up high. \u201cTo Sara and Hannah!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTo Sara and Hannah!\u201d Dan repeated and they all took another sip.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou are right, this stuff is vile,\u201d Sara said and shook herself.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cArf!\u201d Ivy barked and jumped up.</p>\n\n<p>Sara laughed and bent down to ruffle her head. \u201cLook how happy she is! I think you are going to have a great time here, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cArf!\u201d Ivy barked, and Dan wanted to believe that she agreed.</p>\n\n<p>It seemed strange, and somewhat unreal, but Dan felt like this decision might change his whole life. For better, most likely, but no one knew what the future held for each of them. No one could even know what tomorrow would bring. He was, however, glad that Ivy would share part of this journey called life with him and Phil. Hopefully they would all spent a long time together.</p>\n\n<p>Dan watched as Phil sat down on the floor and joined Sara in ruffling Ivy\u2019s fur. Dan smiled to himself. \u201cTo life,\u201d he said, just to himself, and took another sip of the godawful sparkly wine.</p>\n\n<p>*</p>\n\n<p>While Friday had been quite eventful, Saturday had been a quiet affair. Dan and Phil had spent it working on their tour while taking liberal breaks to either go for a walk with their dog (it still felt so unreal, but also so great every time Dan remembered it) or pat Sammy. Dan had made a point of being nice to Sammy, which he had been all along, but he felt like he needed Sammy to know that he would actually miss him when he was gone.</p>\n\n<p>Dan had known all along that Sammy couldn\u2019t stay, both because he probably belonged to someone else already, and because Phil was still very allergic. It wasn\u2019t as bad these days, but the meds just weren\u2019t meant to be a long term solution. Still, Dan had grown fond of Sammy, and he was sorry that he had to leave them. He was certain that not only Phil but Ivy would be devastated, too.</p>\n\n<p>Dan was sitting on the sofa pretending to work on his laptop while actually watching Ivy and Sammy play a weird version of catch. Sammy was lying on the floor, his tail twitching this way and that way, while Ivy, sitting a bit apart from him, tried to catch it with her paw. Every time she managed to swipe at it, Sammy, with lightning speed, swiped his paw at Ivy\u2019s ears. One could think that Sammy was just admonishing Ivy for playing with his tail, but when Ivy did manage to evade Sammy\u2019s paw, he would jump up and try to catch her, then go and sit back down, waiting for Ivy to catch his tail again. It was really adorable.</p>\n\n<p>Phil, who was sitting next to Dan and didn\u2019t even pretend to work anymore, had his phone out and filmed the game, giggling to himself the whole time.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou gonna put it on instagram?\u201d Dan asked, giving up and putting his laptop away.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Phil said.</p>\n\n<p>When hearing their voices, Ivy looked up, tongue rolling out of her snout and wagging her tail at them happily. Sammy looked up, too, but more like he wanted to find out who disturbed this very fun game of his.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh no, now they\u2019ve stopped,\u201d Phil grumbled.</p>\n\n<p>Dan leaned over to look at the footage Phil had managed to get and re-watched to see whether it was usable. It was almost five minutes long, and Phil had actually managed to get the best bits.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDid you even work on anything today?\u201d Dan said, raising an eyebrow at Phil. </p>\n\n<p>Phil looked a bit sheepish at that, but he still gave Dan a smug smile. \u201cSometimes, there are more important things.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan shook his head at his friend. He sat back again and pulled his phone from his pocket. He looked at the time. It was almost 3 pm.</p>\n\n<p>Dan put his phone away and opted to instead watch Phil upload a snippet of the video. They hadn\u2019t announced that they were keeping Ivy, but they planned to do a whole video on it. If they were going to have a new roommate from now on, they wanted to do it properly, and their audience would surely love more dog content. Dan couldn\u2019t quite believe that this was something that he could do from now on. He might as well stop doing any of his usual videos and just post live-updates on Ivy. Most people cared more about dogs than his whiny content anyway. <em>He</em> cared more about dogs than his whiny content.</p>\n\n<p>Dan suspected that he would soon become one of those Youtubers who had separate channels for their pets. He wouldn\u2019t regret it one bit.</p>\n\n<p>When the doorbell rang almost on the dot of the agreed time, all four of them pricked up their ears. Ivy had jumped up, her tail wagging madly. She was on her way to the door before Dan could even react properly.</p>\n\n<p>Sammy didn\u2019t look as interested, but he had gotten up as well and followed Ivy anyway, but at a much more sedate pace.</p>\n\n<p>Dan exchanged a sad look with Phil. They both sighed, then got up and went to open the door.</p>\n\n<p>Ivy and Sammy were already waiting there. Ivy probably thought that Sara was coming back for a surprise visit, or maybe she was just generally excited about visitors. Dan thought that if she knew who was coming to visit, she would be way less excited.</p>\n\n<p>They were all standing at the door, waiting for Kate to come upstairs. Phil was nervously shift from one foot to the other, while Dan had found a bit of string on his jumper and thread it around his fingers again and again. This was just agonizing.</p>\n\n<p>Then Kate came around the corner of the hallway, a small child in tow. She smiled brightly at Dan, who was standing at the door, and extended her hand in greeting. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Kate, you must be Dan?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Dan said and shook hands with her.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAnd this is my daughter Izzy. Say Hi Izzy,\u201d Kate said, nudging her daughter.</p>\n\n<p>Dan directed a small smile towards her, but Izzy just looked down at the floor and hid behind her mother.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, she is very shy,\u201d Kate said.</p>\n\n<p>Ivy chose that moment to wriggle between Dan\u2019s legs and get a good look at their visitors.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIvy, stay!\u201d Dan said, grabbing her by the collar and reeling her back in. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, our dog is very over-excited whenever we get visitors. Come in, please.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He tucked a very wriggly Ivy, who was eyeing Izzy curiously, under his arm and stepped back to let Kate in.</p>\n\n<p>While Dan closed the door and tried to make Ivy understand that she was not to jump on the small child and possibly scare her for life, Phil introduced himself.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cCan I get you something?\u201d Phil said, ever the great host.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo thank you, we won\u2019t be taking up too much of your time,\u201d Kate said.</p>\n\n<p>Phil just nodded, and Dan thought that maybe he was just stalling for time. Which was stupid because Sammy was sitting on the stairs, looking down at them imperiously. It reminded Dan a lot of that very first time he had encountered the cat. He could vividly remember those yellow eyes eyeing him up curiously. How he would miss that impossible cat.</p>\n\n<p>Kate had spotted Sammy, too. \u201cThere he is!\u201d she exclaimed, walking up to him to get a better look. \u201cIzzy, look!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Izzy, who had up until then eyed Phil with worry in her eyes, looked over at Sammy.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPirate!\u201d she said and ran over to the cat, forgetting everything else around her.</p>\n\n<p>Sammy \u2013 no, Pirate \u2013 didn\u2019t even twitch when Izzy threw her arms around him. He stayed almost eerily calm while she hugged him roughly. Dan had, over the past few weeks, never encountered Sammy (no, he simply couldn\u2019t rename him in those last few moments they had together) as patient towards anyone before. Maybe Izzy just had some kind of puppy-bonus.</p>\n\n<p>Kate stepped closer and examined Sammy. \u201cYou know, we adopted Pirate from a couple who used to live in this very building,\u201d she said and stepped back to look at Dan and Phil. \u201cHow did you find him?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cEr, I found him outside our door, and he wouldn\u2019t leave, so I let him in and he has been with us since,\u201d Phil explained.</p>\n\n<p>Kate nodded. \u201cHe probably got lost when he managed to escape our house and went back to where he used to live.\u201d She looked back at Sammy and Izzy and smiled. \u201cIzzy had been devastated. I\u2019m so glad you found him and took care of him. Thank you so much.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo worries,\u201d Dan said. \u201cActually, it was quite nice having him around.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Ivy, who simply couldn\u2019t hold still for more than five minutes, walked past Phil and Kate and up to Izzy and Sammy. She clearly wanted to get some cuddles, too, and sat down at Izzy\u2019s feet, looking up at her expectantly.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDid Pirate get along with your dog? I hope he didn\u2019t cause any trouble,\u201d Kate said and eyed Ivy a bit worriedly.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey became instant best friends,\u201d Phil said. He had an absentminded smile on his face that Dan could always spot when Phil was thinking about something funny. \u201cI think Ivy will be a bit sad about him leaving.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Izzy had let go of Sammy and looked down at Ivy suspiciously. Then, carefully, she extended one hand and placed it on Ivy\u2019s head. Ivy didn\u2019t move, but she wagged her tail more vigorously. Izzy got a bit bolder and patted Ivy.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGood doggy,\u201d she said with a smile. Dan had to admit, this tiny cute child sitting surrounded by a cat and a dog was about the epitome of cuteness.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026I guess this is it?\u201d Phil said. His voice was a bit softer than usual, which Dan immediately picked up on. Dan didn\u2019t really want to bring it up, but it was probably for the best to remove the plaster as fast as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Kate turned around to smile at him. \u201cYes, thank you, really.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>She stepped forward and gently pried Izzy from Sammy, grabbed the cat and put him in the carrier she had brought with her. Sammy just let all of it happen, like he got caught doing something very naughty and accepted his punishment. Although, going home wasn\u2019t a punishment per se, but to Dan it all felt like one.</p>\n\n<p>Dan glanced over at Phil and he looked just as crestfallen as he himself felt. Ivy, on the other hand, was still wagging her tail madly, but she was watching Kate and Sammy.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go and get Sammy chipped first thing in the morning,\u201d Kate said, putting the carrier on the floor and regarding Dan and Phil. \u201cBut we\u2019ll keep an eye on him, so I hope he won\u2019t bother you again.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHonestly, if that ever happens again, he\u2019s more than welcome. And we\u2019ll know who to contact then.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Kate smiled at both of them, then took Izzy\u2019s hand.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cCan I just\u2026say goodbye?\u201d Phil asked timidly. Kate looked at him in surprise, which quickly turned into something apologetic.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Phil stepped up to the carrier and kneeled down on the floor in front of it. Dan followed suit. They both bumped their heads while trying to get a last glimpse of Sammy.</p>\n\n<p>Sammy was sitting calmly in his box, his huge yellow eyes regarding them carefully. He didn\u2019t seem sorry for leaving. But then again, he was a cat, and being taken from one can opener to the next didn\u2019t bother him much.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGoodbye, Sammy \u2013 I mean Pirate,\u201d Phil said, sticking one of his fingers through the bars of the door. \u201cBe nice.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah, don\u2019t go around stealing more bacon,\u201d Dan added with a smile, and Phil laughed.</p>\n\n<p>Ivy had wandered up to them and squeezed her head between Dan and Phil. She gave a sad kind of yapping. It immediately stirred Sammy. His ears pricked up, and he replied with his own meow.</p>\n\n<p>For some reason that was the tipping point for Dan. He quickly rubbed his sleeve over his stinging eyes and grabbed Ivy before she could make a scene.</p>\n\n<p>He got up, and Phil straightened up, too. Kate took the carrier, then nudged her daughter. \u201cSay bye to Dan and Phil, sweetpea.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Izzy looked up timidly. \u201cBye Mr Dan, bye Mr Phil.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan couldn\u2019t help but smile at her. \u201cBye Izzy. You take good care of Pirate?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said resolutely. \u201cThank you for looking after him.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Kate thanked them both at least ten times more before she and Izzy left. The whole time Ivy was wriggling and whimpering in Dan\u2019s arms. As soon as the door closed and Dan let go of Ivy, she promptly ran to the door, putting her paws up on it and whined.</p>\n\n<p>Dan had trouble keeping the tears at bay. He rubbed at his eyes with his sleeve again, hoping to pass it off as just wearily rubbing at his face. Which was a flimsy excuse, even to himself.</p>\n\n<p>He glanced over at Phil, who was rubbing at his face and trying to hide his tears as well. Dan couldn\u2019t help but grin a little. It was a sad grin, but he felt a bit better about not being the only one tearing up.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Dan asked.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Phil said, his voice thick. \u201cThis is the worst day.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan had to concede that Phil had a point. But then again, there was Ivy, sitting in front of the door and watching it like she expected Sammy to waltz back in any minute.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIvy won\u2019t go anywhere anytime soon,\u201d Dan pointed out.</p>\n\n<p>Phil sniffed, then whipped at his nose with his sleeve. \u201cHm.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Damnit this was depressing. Dan didn\u2019t imagine all of this to bum all three of them out so much; and for some reason, Dan didn\u2019t want this whole day to be ruined. They got Ivy now, so even though Sammy left a tiny cat-shaped hole in all of their hearts, Ivy was the one who would quickly fill it and make sure that Sammy wasn\u2019t gone, but remembered fondly. They couldn\u2019t do anything about it now anyway, except for feeling sorry for themselves, and Dan really didn\u2019t want to do that today.</p>\n\n<p>Which was, to his surprise, something he almost never thought before.</p>\n\n<p>And he really didn\u2019t like seeing neither Ivy nor Phil sad, so he said, \u201cHow about we grab our coats and drive out to the park for a big walk?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Phil sniffed again, then looked up at Dan. His eyes were watery, and his nose red. \u201cOnly if we can stop by Starbucks. I think I need a pumpkin spice latte.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey still do those in February?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThink so. I just need a Starbucks right now.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMe too, to be honest.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan walked over to the cabinet where they kept Ivy\u2019s leash. He grabbed it and waved it in Ivy\u2019s direction. \u201cIvy, let\u2019s go for a walk!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>She turned around, her eyes huge and sad, but her tail swished a bit when she spotted the leash.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll just go and change into something else,\u201d Phil said and disappeared up the stairs.</p>\n\n<p>Dan put on his shoes and coat, grabbed the doggy bags and selected a collection of balls to throw for Ivy. They already had way too many, but he suspected that their collection would grow exponentially from now on.</p>\n\n<p>It was weird to think that, when the year had started, all Dan could think about was the upcoming tour. He was still very preoccupied with that; there was so much to do, and Dan feared they wouldn\u2019t get through in time. He had never imagined that he would soon take care of a dog and cat, and he would have never thought that they would grow on him within just a few days. That he would actually adopt one of them would have made him laugh out loud if someone had told him at the start of the year. Now, though, he was just thankful. He was thankful that he got to experience this, and that he got to fall in love with this tiny dog, who in turn took him and Phil into her heart without a second thought.</p>\n\n<p>The best things, it seemed, happened without you planning them.</p>\n\n<p>And maybe that realization was why Dan felt a lot calmer these days, even considering the work they still had to get done for <em>Interactive Introverts</em>. Or the thought of what would come after it. It would all, Dan was sure, work out one way or another.</p>\n\n<p>Phil came back down the stairs. He slipped into his shoes, then regarded Dan. \u201cReady?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan put the leash on Ivy\u2019s collar. She jumped up and barked at him, obviously happy about their outing.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cReady,\u201d Dan said and all three left the flat.</p></p>",

Enjoy!\n\n</p>\n<p>CHAPTER 10: So Long, Farewell</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found a new owner for Ivy!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Dan stared at Sara. She stood there, huge smile on her face, looking from Dan to Phil and back to Dan again. She was obviously waiting for a response.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Phil said, his voice thick with disbelief and something else.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found an owner!&rdquo; Sara repeated. She was still smiling, putting her hands on her hips in a self-assured manner. &ldquo;I know it took a while, but I finally found someone who is able to take proper care of her!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Dan was unable to do anything but stare at her. Beside him, Phil was quiet, too. Sara&rsquo;s smile faded, and she looked at both of them, concerned. &ldquo;Are you two okay?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Dan said, just because he felt like he should say something, not because it was the truth.</p>\n\n<p>Sara cocked her head to the side, regarding him with an odd gaze. &ldquo;Did I walk into something here?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Dan said, unsure of what she actually meant. Next to him, Sammy growled and jumped off Phil&rsquo;s lap. Dan guessed Phil gripped the poor cat a bit too vigorously after the news.</p>\n\n<p>Dan swallowed &ndash; hard &ndash; and asked, &ldquo;Who did you find?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Sara brightened a bit, but there was also something that passed across her face that Dan couldn&rsquo;t quite put. She sat down next to him and started to go into a detailed recounting of her hunt and the family she found.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The mum is staying at home, and the kids are just old enough to take Ivy out for walks, too. They all had a dog before, but he died a year ago. They feel they are now ready to give another pup a home.&rdquo; Sara paused, regarding Ivy, who took up residency right at her feet. Looking at her, Dan felt like even Ivy felt the tension that was in the room. Everyone but Sara seemed to have picked up on it.</p>\n\n<p>Sammy was sitting opposite all of them on the rug, watching them carefully. His tail was twitching, like he was just as tense as the rest of them. While Sara launched into an excited speech about how much Ivy would enjoy participating in dog training school, Dan dared to sneak a glance at Phil. Phil&rsquo;s lips were pressed into a tight line, his gaze trained on Ivy. He must&rsquo;ve felt Dan looking at him with concern, but he refused to look up. His hands were balled into fists. Dan&rsquo;s rarely seen Phil like this, and he didn&rsquo;t like it one bit.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Okay, guys, stop it already and tell me what&rsquo;s up.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Dan snapped his head up. Sara had her hands folded in front of her chest, looking at him sternly. &ldquo;Spill.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>What was Dan supposed to do? Tell her that he&rsquo;d come to love Ivy so much that now that the time has come to give her away for good, he was terrified and sad beyond belief? That he wanted to keep her, but didn&rsquo;t know how to do that? That he didn&rsquo;t feel like he would be able to take proper care of her, especially since Sara had managed to find the picture-perfect family that would be so much better equipped to look after Ivy than he would ever be. They probably even had a large backyard and lived somewhere in the country. Dan already hated them so much just for existing.</p>\n\n<p>But what was he to do? He&rsquo;d told Sara that he would look after Ivy for just long enough for her to find someone better; she had, and Dan&rsquo;s job was done now. And besides, he couldn&rsquo;t tell her that he wanted to keep Ivy so badly now that she didn&rsquo;t belong to him anymore.</p>\n\n<p>Or could he?</p>\n\n<p>Dan glanced back at Phil. This time, Phil met his gaze. Dan had known Phil for long enough to see everything that he needed on his face alone. Phil&rsquo;s lips were still pressed into a tight line, but his eyes were set with resolve.</p>\n\n<p>For the last couple of weeks, he and Dan had been able to take care of both a cat and a dog, and were (mostly) successful at that. Both pets were still alive (unlike most of their houseplants), and didn&rsquo;t seem malnourished or unhappy. Besides for Ivy needing a haircut, she was absolutely fine.</p>\n\n<p>Phil was the clumsiest person Dan knew, and he had to take care of that oaf more often than any one of them would like to admit. Phil was sometimes rash in his decisions, and also way too excited way too easily. Dan, on the other hand, would think thrice as much about any decision to make than any normal person out there and could hardly take care of himself when it came to his bad days.</p>\n\n<p>But then Dan thought of the almost ten years of friendship, and their joint projects, and how much they had managed to achieve together. How much Phil was looking after Dan when he wasn&rsquo;t up to do it himself, and how organized this bugger could be if he just wanted to. He thought about their channels, their book, their last tour, the tour to come. How could he have possibly missed that they had both achieved so much, and why the heck was he still so damn hesitant to do something that he absolutely wanted?</p>\n\n<p>Dan was, in that moment, utterly baffled by his own stupidity. He was also very grateful for Phil&rsquo;s friendship. Dan reminded himself that no, he didn&rsquo;t have to do anything on his own. He would always have Phil by his side, like he&rsquo;d had for the past ten years.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We want to keep her,&rdquo; Dan blurted out.</p>\n\n<p>Phil&rsquo;s eyes went wide, his mouth going slack. The question behind his eyes was clear, and Dan only gave him a small smile in response.</p>\n\n<p>Before Dan could say anything else, Sara gave a sigh and said, &ldquo;Well, finally, I thought I&rsquo;d have to go on for another hour.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Dan&rsquo;s head snapped around, looking at Sara in disbelief. He was sure Phil&rsquo;s face matched his own when he heard him say, &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Sara rolled her eyes at them. &ldquo;I thought I had to go on about the Brown&rsquo;s for another hour before you two decided that you would keep Ivy.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Again, Dan was completely unable to say anything and just blinked at her. Eventually, he managed to say, &ldquo;What the fuck, Sara?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Sara just looked at him. Then she looked down at Ivy and reached down to scratch her ears. Ivy had been very still up until that moment, but she seemed to lose some of her own tension when Sara scratched that very specific spot right behind her left ear.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;m not stupid, I know how much you fell in love with Ivy. You,&rdquo; she pointed at Dan, &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t stop sending me pictures of her, and you,&rdquo; she waved a hand at Phil, &ldquo;were going on and on posting tweets about her last hijinks and spaming everyone&rsquo;s instagram with stories involving her. Honestly, I was waiting for you two to tell me that you wanted to keep her for over a week now.&rdquo; She cocks her head to the side, thinking about it. &ldquo;Actually, since the last time I came to visit.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Dan just gaped at her. &ldquo;What about this family?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Sara waved her hand dismissively at him. &ldquo;They exist, but I haven&rsquo;t told them that they could have Ivy. I said I had other potential owners.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; Dan asked.</p>\n\n<p>She looked up at that. &ldquo;Well, yes, you.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You utter&hellip;&rdquo; Dan began, but he was completely drowned by Phil, who had jumped up from the sofa and said, no, exclaimed, &ldquo;Does that mean we can keep Ivy?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>She raised an eyebrow at Phil and gave him a Look. &ldquo;Obviously.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Phil&rsquo;s squeal of joy was drowned in Sara&rsquo;s hair, as he had jumped in front of her and bent down to squeeze her tight.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Alright, your welcome, you can let go of me now,&rdquo; Sara said, her voice muffled by Phil&rsquo;s jumper.</p>\n\n<p>Phil let go of her, but the huge smile plastered across his face stayed. Dan just shook his head at him, but he couldn&rsquo;t hide the fond smile spreading across his own face.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Ivy, did you hear that?&rdquo; Phil said and grabbed the dog, holding her up to his face. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be your new daddies now! You can stay here!&rdquo; Ivy gave a happy bark, her tail swishing through the air.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say daddies, that just sounds wrong,&rdquo; Dan said, rolling his eyes at Phil in exasperation, but he didn&rsquo;t really mean it. This dog was his precious little daughter now and no one could tell him otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>At that, Phil put Ivy down again and, to Dan&rsquo;s utter horror, bent down to envelope Dan in a tight hug. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Phil said into Dan&rsquo;s ear.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yes yes,&rdquo; Dan said and shoved Phil off of him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me regret this.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Phil just grinned. &ldquo;I feel like we should have a celebratory drink!&rdquo; And with that Phil was off, followed closely by Ivy and Sammy. They were probably hungry for snacks.</p>\n\n<p>Dan looked over at Sara, and they both shook their heads in unison. &ldquo;This guy is unbelievable,&rdquo; Dan said.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;An unbelievable dork, but a happy one.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Dan laughed at this, but he sobered up quite quickly. He bit his lip. &ldquo;You think this is okay?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Sara sighed, but she gave him a sympathetic look. &ldquo;I know this feels weird, but I think you would hate yourself if you&rsquo;d gave up Ivy. I know she&rsquo;s a big responsibility. But I know you two are perfect for her, and she is perfect for you. You&rsquo;ll figure the rest out.&rdquo; She smiled at him, and Dan felt a bit better. Maybe she was right. &ldquo;And besides, she&rsquo;s been living with you for a few weeks now and she&rsquo;s still alive, so that&rsquo;s something.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Dan rolled his eyes, but he didn&rsquo;t get to reply as Phil came back, carrying three glasses and a bottle of sparkling wine. Dan didn&rsquo;t know they actually had any.</p>\n\n<p>Ivy and Sammy barreled into the room after Phil, and Dan suspected that they&rsquo;d had a celebratory treat, too. They looked far too pleased, especially Sammy. Dan didn&rsquo;t mind that, though. Sammy would only stay with them for about another day, and being pampered a bit in that time seemed kinda appropriate. Dan would have to make sure that Ivy didn&rsquo;t overeat on treats, though. That posed a bit of a challenge, as Phil loved snacking and, as Dan had the pleasure of discovering over the last few weeks, didn&rsquo;t like to leave Ivy nor Sammy out when snacking himself.</p>\n\n<p>Phil put down the glasses and started pouring the drinks. Dan and Sara got up and walked over to him, accepting a glass each.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;To Ivy!&rdquo; Phil said and clinked his glass to Dan&rsquo;s and Sara&rsquo;s.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;To Ivy!&rdquo; Sara said, grinning at Phil. </p>\n\n<p>They all took a sip, and they all couldn&rsquo;t stop grinning down at the little dog, who had decided to sit right in the centre of their little circle.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yes Ivy, from now on you will be the centre of attention and you will probably hog all of our social media from now on,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;I have to say I am looking forward to telling everyone that she&rsquo;ll stay with us.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The crowds will go wild.&rdquo; Sara laughed.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Is it just me or is this really disgusting,&rdquo; Phil said and pulled a face at his glass.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;No, it is horrible,&rdquo; Dan said and took another sip.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, I almost forgot!&rdquo; Sara thrust her glass into Dan&rsquo;s hand and began to rummage through her bag. She then pulled out a stack of what looked like photos. She took two and handed them over to Dan and Phil with an impossibly wide grin on her face. &ldquo;I hope you are not going on tour again next year!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Dan exchanged the glass with the card and looked at it. He had to take a double take before he looked up with a mix of surprise and joy. &ldquo;Save the date? You and Hannah are getting married?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Sara said and jumped a little. &ldquo;She asked me! We&rsquo;re getting married next year!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;This is great, congratulations!&rdquo; Dan said and enveloped her in a hug.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Congrats!&rdquo; Phil held his glass up high. &ldquo;To Sara and Hannah!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;To Sara and Hannah!&rdquo; Dan repeated and they all took another sip.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You are right, this stuff is vile,&rdquo; Sara said and shook herself.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Arf!&rdquo; Ivy barked and jumped up.</p>\n\n<p>Sara laughed and bent down to ruffle her head. &ldquo;Look how happy she is! I think you are going to have a great time here, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Arf!&rdquo; Ivy barked, and Dan wanted to believe that she agreed.</p>\n\n<p>It seemed strange, and somewhat unreal, but Dan felt like this decision might change his whole life. For better, most likely, but no one knew what the future held for each of them. No one could even know what tomorrow would bring. He was, however, glad that Ivy would share part of this journey called life with him and Phil. Hopefully they would all spent a long time together.</p>\n\n<p>Dan watched as Phil sat down on the floor and joined Sara in ruffling Ivy&rsquo;s fur. Dan smiled to himself. &ldquo;To life,&rdquo; he said, just to himself, and took another sip of the godawful sparkly wine.</p>\n\n<p>*</p>\n\n<p>While Friday had been quite eventful, Saturday had been a quiet affair. Dan and Phil had spent it working on their tour while taking liberal breaks to either go for a walk with their dog (it still felt so unreal, but also so great every time Dan remembered it) or pat Sammy. Dan had made a point of being nice to Sammy, which he had been all along, but he felt like he needed Sammy to know that he would actually miss him when he was gone.</p>\n\n<p>Dan had known all along that Sammy couldn&rsquo;t stay, both because he probably belonged to someone else already, and because Phil was still very allergic. It wasn&rsquo;t as bad these days, but the meds just weren&rsquo;t meant to be a long term solution. Still, Dan had grown fond of Sammy, and he was sorry that he had to leave them. He was certain that not only Phil but Ivy would be devastated, too.</p>\n\n<p>Dan was sitting on the sofa pretending to work on his laptop while actually watching Ivy and Sammy play a weird version of catch. Sammy was lying on the floor, his tail twitching this way and that way, while Ivy, sitting a bit apart from him, tried to catch it with her paw. Every time she managed to swipe at it, Sammy, with lightning speed, swiped his paw at Ivy&rsquo;s ears. One could think that Sammy was just admonishing Ivy for playing with his tail, but when Ivy did manage to evade Sammy&rsquo;s paw, he would jump up and try to catch her, then go and sit back down, waiting for Ivy to catch his tail again. It was really adorable.</p>\n\n<p>Phil, who was sitting next to Dan and didn&rsquo;t even pretend to work anymore, had his phone out and filmed the game, giggling to himself the whole time.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You gonna put it on instagram?&rdquo; Dan asked, giving up and putting his laptop away.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; Phil said.</p>\n\n<p>When hearing their voices, Ivy looked up, tongue rolling out of her snout and wagging her tail at them happily. Sammy looked up, too, but more like he wanted to find out who disturbed this very fun game of his.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Oh no, now they&rsquo;ve stopped,&rdquo; Phil grumbled.</p>\n\n<p>Dan leaned over to look at the footage Phil had managed to get and re-watched to see whether it was usable. It was almost five minutes long, and Phil had actually managed to get the best bits.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Did you even work on anything today?&rdquo; Dan said, raising an eyebrow at Phil. </p>\n\n<p>Phil looked a bit sheepish at that, but he still gave Dan a smug smile. &ldquo;Sometimes, there are more important things.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Dan shook his head at his friend. He sat back again and pulled his phone from his pocket. He looked at the time. It was almost 3 pm.</p>\n\n<p>Dan put his phone away and opted to instead watch Phil upload a snippet of the video. They hadn&rsquo;t announced that they were keeping Ivy, but they planned to do a whole video on it. If they were going to have a new roommate from now on, they wanted to do it properly, and their audience would surely love more dog content. Dan couldn&rsquo;t quite believe that this was something that he could do from now on. He might as well stop doing any of his usual videos and just post live-updates on Ivy. Most people cared more about dogs than his whiny content anyway. <em>He</em> cared more about dogs than his whiny content.</p>\n\n<p>Dan suspected that he would soon become one of those Youtubers who had separate channels for their pets. He wouldn&rsquo;t regret it one bit.</p>\n\n<p>When the doorbell rang almost on the dot of the agreed time, all four of them pricked up their ears. Ivy had jumped up, her tail wagging madly. She was on her way to the door before Dan could even react properly.</p>\n\n<p>Sammy didn&rsquo;t look as interested, but he had gotten up as well and followed Ivy anyway, but at a much more sedate pace.</p>\n\n<p>Dan exchanged a sad look with Phil. They both sighed, then got up and went to open the door.</p>\n\n<p>Ivy and Sammy were already waiting there. Ivy probably thought that Sara was coming back for a surprise visit, or maybe she was just generally excited about visitors. Dan thought that if she knew who was coming to visit, she would be way less excited.</p>\n\n<p>They were all standing at the door, waiting for Kate to come upstairs. Phil was nervously shift from one foot to the other, while Dan had found a bit of string on his jumper and thread it around his fingers again and again. This was just agonizing.</p>\n\n<p>Then Kate came around the corner of the hallway, a small child in tow. She smiled brightly at Dan, who was standing at the door, and extended her hand in greeting. &ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Kate, you must be Dan?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; Dan said and shook hands with her.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;And this is my daughter Izzy. Say Hi Izzy,&rdquo; Kate said, nudging her daughter.</p>\n\n<p>Dan directed a small smile towards her, but Izzy just looked down at the floor and hid behind her mother.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, she is very shy,&rdquo; Kate said.</p>\n\n<p>Ivy chose that moment to wriggle between Dan&rsquo;s legs and get a good look at their visitors.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Ivy, stay!&rdquo; Dan said, grabbing her by the collar and reeling her back in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, our dog is very over-excited whenever we get visitors. Come in, please.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>He tucked a very wriggly Ivy, who was eyeing Izzy curiously, under his arm and stepped back to let Kate in.</p>\n\n<p>While Dan closed the door and tried to make Ivy understand that she was not to jump on the small child and possibly scare her for life, Phil introduced himself.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Can I get you something?&rdquo; Phil said, ever the great host.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;No thank you, we won&rsquo;t be taking up too much of your time,&rdquo; Kate said.</p>\n\n<p>Phil just nodded, and Dan thought that maybe he was just stalling for time. Which was stupid because Sammy was sitting on the stairs, looking down at them imperiously. It reminded Dan a lot of that very first time he had encountered the cat. He could vividly remember those yellow eyes eyeing him up curiously. How he would miss that impossible cat.</p>\n\n<p>Kate had spotted Sammy, too. &ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; she exclaimed, walking up to him to get a better look. &ldquo;Izzy, look!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Izzy, who had up until then eyed Phil with worry in her eyes, looked over at Sammy.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Pirate!&rdquo; she said and ran over to the cat, forgetting everything else around her.</p>\n\n<p>Sammy &ndash; no, Pirate &ndash; didn&rsquo;t even twitch when Izzy threw her arms around him. He stayed almost eerily calm while she hugged him roughly. Dan had, over the past few weeks, never encountered Sammy (no, he simply couldn&rsquo;t rename him in those last few moments they had together) as patient towards anyone before. Maybe Izzy just had some kind of puppy-bonus.</p>\n\n<p>Kate stepped closer and examined Sammy. &ldquo;You know, we adopted Pirate from a couple who used to live in this very building,&rdquo; she said and stepped back to look at Dan and Phil. &ldquo;How did you find him?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Er, I found him outside our door, and he wouldn&rsquo;t leave, so I let him in and he has been with us since,&rdquo; Phil explained.</p>\n\n<p>Kate nodded. &ldquo;He probably got lost when he managed to escape our house and went back to where he used to live.&rdquo; She looked back at Sammy and Izzy and smiled. &ldquo;Izzy had been devastated. I&rsquo;m so glad you found him and took care of him. Thank you so much.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;No worries,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;Actually, it was quite nice having him around.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Ivy, who simply couldn&rsquo;t hold still for more than five minutes, walked past Phil and Kate and up to Izzy and Sammy. She clearly wanted to get some cuddles, too, and sat down at Izzy&rsquo;s feet, looking up at her expectantly.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Did Pirate get along with your dog? I hope he didn&rsquo;t cause any trouble,&rdquo; Kate said and eyed Ivy a bit worriedly.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;They became instant best friends,&rdquo; Phil said. He had an absentminded smile on his face that Dan could always spot when Phil was thinking about something funny. &ldquo;I think Ivy will be a bit sad about him leaving.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Izzy had let go of Sammy and looked down at Ivy suspiciously. Then, carefully, she extended one hand and placed it on Ivy&rsquo;s head. Ivy didn&rsquo;t move, but she wagged her tail more vigorously. Izzy got a bit bolder and patted Ivy.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Good doggy,&rdquo; she said with a smile. Dan had to admit, this tiny cute child sitting surrounded by a cat and a dog was about the epitome of cuteness.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;So&hellip;I guess this is it?&rdquo; Phil said. His voice was a bit softer than usual, which Dan immediately picked up on. Dan didn&rsquo;t really want to bring it up, but it was probably for the best to remove the plaster as fast as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Kate turned around to smile at him. &ldquo;Yes, thank you, really.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>She stepped forward and gently pried Izzy from Sammy, grabbed the cat and put him in the carrier she had brought with her. Sammy just let all of it happen, like he got caught doing something very naughty and accepted his punishment. Although, going home wasn&rsquo;t a punishment per se, but to Dan it all felt like one.</p>\n\n<p>Dan glanced over at Phil and he looked just as crestfallen as he himself felt. Ivy, on the other hand, was still wagging her tail madly, but she was watching Kate and Sammy.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go and get Sammy chipped first thing in the morning,&rdquo; Kate said, putting the carrier on the floor and regarding Dan and Phil. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll keep an eye on him, so I hope he won&rsquo;t bother you again.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Honestly, if that ever happens again, he&rsquo;s more than welcome. And we&rsquo;ll know who to contact then.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Kate smiled at both of them, then took Izzy&rsquo;s hand.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Can I just&hellip;say goodbye?&rdquo; Phil asked timidly. Kate looked at him in surprise, which quickly turned into something apologetic.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Phil stepped up to the carrier and kneeled down on the floor in front of it. Dan followed suit. They both bumped their heads while trying to get a last glimpse of Sammy.</p>\n\n<p>Sammy was sitting calmly in his box, his huge yellow eyes regarding them carefully. He didn&rsquo;t seem sorry for leaving. But then again, he was a cat, and being taken from one can opener to the next didn&rsquo;t bother him much.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Goodbye, Sammy &ndash; I mean Pirate,&rdquo; Phil said, sticking one of his fingers through the bars of the door. &ldquo;Be nice.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah, don&rsquo;t go around stealing more bacon,&rdquo; Dan added with a smile, and Phil laughed.</p>\n\n<p>Ivy had wandered up to them and squeezed her head between Dan and Phil. She gave a sad kind of yapping. It immediately stirred Sammy. His ears pricked up, and he replied with his own meow.</p>\n\n<p>For some reason that was the tipping point for Dan. He quickly rubbed his sleeve over his stinging eyes and grabbed Ivy before she could make a scene.</p>\n\n<p>He got up, and Phil straightened up, too. Kate took the carrier, then nudged her daughter. &ldquo;Say bye to Dan and Phil, sweetpea.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Izzy looked up timidly. &ldquo;Bye Mr Dan, bye Mr Phil.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Dan couldn&rsquo;t help but smile at her. &ldquo;Bye Izzy. You take good care of Pirate?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said resolutely. &ldquo;Thank you for looking after him.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Kate thanked them both at least ten times more before she and Izzy left. The whole time Ivy was wriggling and whimpering in Dan&rsquo;s arms. As soon as the door closed and Dan let go of Ivy, she promptly ran to the door, putting her paws up on it and whined.</p>\n\n<p>Dan had trouble keeping the tears at bay. He rubbed at his eyes with his sleeve again, hoping to pass it off as just wearily rubbing at his face. Which was a flimsy excuse, even to himself.</p>\n\n<p>He glanced over at Phil, who was rubbing at his face and trying to hide his tears as well. Dan couldn&rsquo;t help but grin a little. It was a sad grin, but he felt a bit better about not being the only one tearing up.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; Dan asked.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Phil said, his voice thick. &ldquo;This is the worst day.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Dan had to concede that Phil had a point. But then again, there was Ivy, sitting in front of the door and watching it like she expected Sammy to waltz back in any minute.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Ivy won&rsquo;t go anywhere anytime soon,&rdquo; Dan pointed out.</p>\n\n<p>Phil sniffed, then whipped at his nose with his sleeve. &ldquo;Hm.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Damnit this was depressing. Dan didn&rsquo;t imagine all of this to bum all three of them out so much; and for some reason, Dan didn&rsquo;t want this whole day to be ruined. They got Ivy now, so even though Sammy left a tiny cat-shaped hole in all of their hearts, Ivy was the one who would quickly fill it and make sure that Sammy wasn&rsquo;t gone, but remembered fondly. They couldn&rsquo;t do anything about it now anyway, except for feeling sorry for themselves, and Dan really didn&rsquo;t want to do that today.</p>\n\n<p>Which was, to his surprise, something he almost never thought before.</p>\n\n<p>And he really didn&rsquo;t like seeing neither Ivy nor Phil sad, so he said, &ldquo;How about we grab our coats and drive out to the park for a big walk?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Phil sniffed again, then looked up at Dan. His eyes were watery, and his nose red. &ldquo;Only if we can stop by Starbucks. I think I need a pumpkin spice latte.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;They still do those in February?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Think so. I just need a Starbucks right now.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Me too, to be honest.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Dan walked over to the cabinet where they kept Ivy&rsquo;s leash. He grabbed it and waved it in Ivy&rsquo;s direction. &ldquo;Ivy, let&rsquo;s go for a walk!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>She turned around, her eyes huge and sad, but her tail swished a bit when she spotted the leash.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just go and change into something else,&rdquo; Phil said and disappeared up the stairs.</p>\n\n<p>Dan put on his shoes and coat, grabbed the doggy bags and selected a collection of balls to throw for Ivy. They already had way too many, but he suspected that their collection would grow exponentially from now on.</p>\n\n<p>It was weird to think that, when the year had started, all Dan could think about was the upcoming tour. He was still very preoccupied with that; there was so much to do, and Dan feared they wouldn&rsquo;t get through in time. He had never imagined that he would soon take care of a dog and cat, and he would have never thought that they would grow on him within just a few days. That he would actually adopt one of them would have made him laugh out loud if someone had told him at the start of the year. Now, though, he was just thankful. He was thankful that he got to experience this, and that he got to fall in love with this tiny dog, who in turn took him and Phil into her heart without a second thought.</p>\n\n<p>The best things, it seemed, happened without you planning them.</p>\n\n<p>And maybe that realization was why Dan felt a lot calmer these days, even considering the work they still had to get done for <em>Interactive Introverts</em>. Or the thought of what would come after it. It would all, Dan was sure, work out one way or another.</p>\n\n<p>Phil came back down the stairs. He slipped into his shoes, then regarded Dan. &ldquo;Ready?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Dan put the leash on Ivy&rsquo;s collar. She jumped up and barked at him, obviously happy about their outing.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Ready,&rdquo; Dan said and all three left the flat.</p></p>",
