Hoseok and Jimin \u201cMade Out\u201d</a></b></p><p><b>14. Fever Dreams</b></p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Yoongi was, honestly, impressed and\nsurprised and a little bit proud of himself for making it so long before it\nhappened. \u00a0He\u2019s always been introverted,\nso to have gone from living alone and having every minute to himself if he so\nwished to suddenly never being alone even when he was just trying to go to the\nbathroom was a difficult whirlwind to adjust to. \u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nHe\nhas never been one to yell\u2014he can remember the three times he has yelled at\nsomeone in his adult life exactly as if they just happened yesterday: one, when\nhe finally resorted to raising his voice to convince his parents he was serious\nabout dropping out of school; two, when he was so, incredibly,\nwill-never-be-that-badly-drunk-again and thought he had lost his brother so he\nwent around screaming his head off in a crowded street in the middle of the\nnight like an absolute lunatic; and three, when he was so embarrassed after\nconfessing to Namjoon that he reacted by trying to get him to leave him alone,\nbut no amount of yelling would ever make Namjoon stop being his friend, so he\nhad never screamed at him again. \u00a0He had\nalways leaned toward melting down, imploding, instead of exploding, tended to\nshut down and shut people out instead of complaining and drawing attention to\nhimself.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHe\nalso was used to pressing everything down and holding everything in, keeping\neverything to himself instead of reaching out to others even if all he wanted\nwas someone to come alongside and help him. \nThat\u2019s why, every time he has ever had a bad meltdown or had gotten\nsick, it always hit him alarmingly quickly, like a freight train, like a thief\nin the night. \u00a0The lack of warning made\nit worse because that was what made him feel completely out of control,\nhelpless and vulnerable. \u00a0Weak and\npathetic.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHe\ncould hear the boys waking up. \u00a0Their\nvoices sounded muffled and distant, like they were underwater, and some\nirrational fear that they were drowning in the bathtub is what made him sit up,\nimmediately regretting his decision as he groaned and grabbed his head to keep\nthe world from turning upside down.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s\nawa\u2019e!\u201d Jungkook shouted, his continual need to be right in Yoongi\u2019s face, to\ninvade his space, extremely frustrating for some reason this morning. \u00a0With his eyes squinted shut, all of the skin\non his face feeling pulled tight and yet so loose it might be melting off his\nskull, Yoongi reached out blindly and tried to move the boy away from him as\ngently as possible. \u00a0The movement,\nhowever, caused his stomach to lurch, and with a curse, a thud, another curse,\nJimin screaming a reprimand at him, and Jungkook letting out a little breath as\nhe collided with something, Yoongi tumbled off of the bed, only prying his eyes\nopen enough to stumble into the bathroom, slamming the door behind him.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nYoongi\ncouldn\u2019t recall the last time he threw up. \nHe could remember it; he knew it was some dumb decision when he was\ntrying to pretend he didn\u2019t care about anything while really all he wanted in\nthe world was his parent\u2019s approval and his brother\u2019s love and Namjoon\u2019s\nsupport and his work to have purpose and success because he was working his ass\noff even though no one seemed to care or notice, and he knew he didn\u2019t like\ngetting that drunk again and stuck to wine or whiskey now to avoid going\noverboard, but he had forgotten how awful it was. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHow\nmuch it absolutely wracked his small frame and made tears prickle in his eyes\ninvoluntarily. \u00a0How much it stung and lingered\neven after he brushed his teeth multiple times. \nHow it made his entire body shake and break into a sweat. \u00a0How, for a split second, it always made him\nfeel like he was actually dying. \u00a0How, of\nall of the gross things he had had to deal with in the past few weeks\u2014mainly,\nurine\u2014it was by far his least favorite thing to clean up, and even though he\nneeded to wipe down the toilet and scrub the floor and brush his teeth for the\nthird time, he found himself slinking back to the ground, sweating and\nbreathing heavily, groaning as he heard the boys pounding on the door, Jimin\u2019s\nscreams louder than anything at all. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHis\narms were too weak to reach the handle, and if his throat didn\u2019t feel like he\nhad swallowed a slug covered in poison meant to burn his esophagus, he would\nhave told the boys to just come in, but he closed his eyes instead, barely registering\nhow Jimin\u2019s screams and the pounding stopped as their little feet padded away.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nTae\nisn\u2019t exactly sure why Eunnie had sent him five pictures of his neighbor at the\ndaycare taking pictures of kids with the message \u201cLook what you missed out\non.\u201d \u00a0The embarrassment had hit him first\nmixed with regret and annoyance at himself. \nHe remembered Eunnie mentioning having him come and take pictures. \u00a0He knew Jin had mentioned it at least once or\ntwice, too. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBut\nEunnie, even though she has grown annoyed with him before and vocally shared\nher frustration with Jin or straight up to him, would never gloat or make fun\nof him so blatantly. \u00a0So it took him a\nsecond to register who was in the picture. \nHer text must have meant that he missed out on seeing Yoongi, then, and\nit took him several steps of staring at his phone with a frown before he\nfigured out what she could mean.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nWith\na groan, he promised himself to stop telling everything to Jin even after the\nguy had promised he wouldn\u2019t tell anyone else. \nTae kept forgetting that that rule didn\u2019t seem to apply to his\nwife. \u00a0Something gross about being one\nflesh or \u201cshe\u2019s my everything\u201d or \u201cshe can tell when I\u2019m hiding something, so\nto protect my beautiful face I never do so.\u201d \n</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHe\nmay have, in passing, said something about Yoongi to Jin at some point. \u00a0He may have mentioned Yoongi getting jealous\nthat one day he had seen Jin at his place. \nJin may have laughed at him. \u00a0Tae\nmay have gotten fussy and grumbled about how he wasn\u2019t helping. \u00a0He may have said something about how much he\nliked his tattoos and how distracting seeing Yoongi shirtless while he hovered\nover him on his couch had been. \u00a0He may\nhave pretended to ignore the smirk and eyebrow raise Jin had given him.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nGroaning\nagain at how careless he had been, Tae kept looking at the pictures of Yoongi\nas he climbed the steps to his apartment. \nDespite how easily distracted and scatterbrained Tae was, he could\nconcentrate when he needed to. \u00a0And he\noften stared at people, not in a creepy way, except they often thought so if\nthey were strangers and noticed him doing it, but because he considered them\nwalking pieces of art, and art was meant to be admired. \u00a0He loved looking from afar and up close,\nbecause perspective can change everything. \nHe once told Jin that he never felt like he really knew a person until\nhe had seen them in a multitude of places. \nHe meant that people are different at home and at work, often, so to\ntruly know them you have to observe them in both places. \u00a0Jin had mentioned something perverted about\nhow many people Tae wanted to see in bed, too, and while Tae had not responded,\nhe wasn\u2019t exactly wrong. \u00a0To see someone\nhappy and sad, stressed and angry, tired and sick, at their best and at their\nworst, is the only way to truly know someone. \nHe complained often to Jin, each time a boyfriend or potential date left\nhim, that they never stuck around long enough to see him in all areas. \u00a0Jin had made another crude joke, but Tae knew\nhe was just trying to lighten the mood. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nLooking\nat Yoongi\u2019s pictures, Tae simply felt like he was seeing him in a different\nlight. \u00a0He had seen the man crying, had\nseen him exhausted and at his last rope, and anyone else might just assume that\nthat was all the man had to offer. \nFrowns and baggy eyes and hurried conversations because he had to get\nback to his kids. \u00a0Tae had seen the man\nas a dad, or, an uncle, a care giver. \nBut he hadn\u2019t seen him at work. \nHe hadn\u2019t seen him really smile yet, he didn\u2019t think. \u00a0A few polite grins or ones of relief, sure,\nbut each of those told a different story. \nThe Yoongi he saw on his small phone screen told him something more than\nhe had ever gleaned from seeing the man in person. \u00a0He was clearly passionate. \u00a0He concentrated and worked hard. \u00a0But he felt overwhelmed, probably by the\nkids, if Tae remembered correctly what Yoongi had said about how much he didn\u2019t\nlike to photograph people, and looked exhausted. \u00a0The exhaustion wasn\u2019t like what Tae had seen\nbefore, though, and the frown on Yoongi\u2019s face wasn\u2019t one of anger. \u00a0The man looked like he was about to fall\napart even with a camera half-hiding his face, and it was that look that Tae\ncouldn\u2019t look away from.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHe\nknew that Yoongi was older than him, but something in the man\u2019s face and body\nposture, the way he had squatted down to be at eye-level with each kid, made\nhim look much younger. \u00a0Smaller, too, but\nTae already knew the man was shorter than him. \nHe couldn\u2019t see any of his tattoos, the man\u2019s sleeves covering them up,\nbut he was imaging them. \u00a0Art on art, is\nwhat they were. \u00a0They made Yoongi look\neven more beautiful, or he made them stand out more. \u00a0Tae wasn\u2019t sure which was enhancing the other. \u00a0All he knew was Eunnie was right. \u00a0He had missed out on not only another job,\nbut also on seeing Yoongi at work, and as he scaled the top of the stairs, he\npaused by the guy\u2019s door, wondering how much his neighbor would hate him for\ndropping in unannounced. \u00a0He could always\ngo home and text him to make it look more planned, but several sounds made him\nstop and frown at the blue door before he could.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nWhile\nhe had really only heard Jungkook and Jimin crying once before, he didn\u2019t think\nhe would ever forget what their cries sounded like. \u00a0They seemed to have struck his heart deep\nenough that even the quiet sound of them dug into his flesh even more, the pain\nspreading and panic welling. \u00a0Without\nwaiting to text or give Yoongi any other sort of warning, he rose his fist to\npound on the door. \u00a0He wanted to think\nthat the guy hadn\u2019t lost it in the middle of the day. \u00a0He hoped there was more to him, more good,\nnever more bad, behind the exterior he had. \nTae hoped he hadn\u2019t misjudged him. \nHe didn\u2019t have the best track record when it came to trusting men in his\nlife, or so Jin had told him over and over again. \u00a0But Yoongi seemed different. \u00a0Or Tae wanted him to be. \u00a0Yoongi was\u2014</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi?\u201d\nTae said, pounding on the door again. \u00a0He\nheard someone crying and someone else mumbling, the sounds too low to the\nground and high-pitched to be a grown man. \n\u201cJimin? \u00a0Jungkook?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cTae-tae?\u201d\nJimin said through the door, and Tae sighed in relief, his fist leaving the\ndoor to curl around the doorknob.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\ncoming in, okay?\u201d \u00a0Not waiting for an answer,\nand really hoping Yoongi wasn\u2019t on the other side of the door ready to knife\nsomeone for breaking in, Tae pushed the door open, meeting a little resistance\nthat he realized was the cowering bodies of two small boys, both who started to\ngrab at his pants and gasp a little as they both started to rattle on. \u00a0Tae caught \u201cYoo-yoo\u201d and \u201cbathroom\u201d enough\nbetween the pair of them, their words frantic and jumbled, to know where he\nneeded to go, so making sure he closed the door and placed what he hoped was a\nsoothing hand on both of the boys\u2019 shoulders, he trotted down the short hallway\nto where the bathroom must be.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi?\u201d\nhe called before trying the door. \u00a0He\nkept one hand behind him to keep the boys back despite how much they were\ncrowding around him, afraid of what he might find. \u00a0After finding his own grandma collapsed in\nher bedroom floor when he was ten, he had been aware of how scarring the sight\nof someone you love who is in charge of taking care of you looking seemingly\ndead can be for a child. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi?\u201d\nhe said again, closing the door behind him before the boys could slip in,\nignoring how Jimin started yelling again, his and Jungkook\u2019s feet kicking at\nthe door. \u00a0Compared to Tae, Yoongi was\npale. \u00a0Tae had noticed that when he first\nbecame aware of the man. \u00a0His skin looked\nlike porcelain, and right now he looked fragile enough to break if touched, but\nTae dropped to the floor immediately, placing his hand on the man\u2019s sweaty brow\nand hissing at how warm he felt.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi?\u201d\nhe said again, his nose wrinkling at how smelly the small room was. \u00a0Trying to be gentle, he peeled up one of\nYoongi\u2019s eyelids to see his pupils wide. \nThe man groaned a bit, enough of a sign for Tae to know he was at least\nnot dead, and he felt his heart calm immediately. \u00a0Still, he looked terrible, and Tae\u2019s brain\nworked quickly, trying to remember the steps to take. \u00a0One time when Hoseok was three he had gotten\nsick at Tae\u2019s house, and he had gone so pale and clammy so quickly that Tae\nalmost called 119, but Eunnie had walked him through what to do calmly over the\nphone as she and Jin headed back early.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi?\u201d\nTae repeated, not really waiting for the man to reply, just wanting to try to\nget his attention and inform him of what he was doing so he wouldn\u2019t freak\nout. \u00a0\u201cI need to get you to the bath. \u00a0Can you stand?\u201d \u00a0Yoongi grunted, and he started to push\nhimself off of the wall and floor at the same time, which Tae knew wasn\u2019t going\nto work for long, so he took advantage of Yoongi lifting himself just enough to\nslide an arm under his knees and around his back. \u00a0Despite his small size, Yoongi definitely\nweighed more than Hoseok, and Tae tottered a bit as he stood up, thankful that\nthe wall was so close and Yoongi seemed to be pressing his hand flat against it\nas they rose. \u00a0He only had a few feet to\ngo, anyway, but he moved carefully more than quickly, noting how Yoongi mumbled\nsomething before sinking forward a little, his head ducked and causing enough\nof a shift in balance for Tae to press his own back against the wall to avoid\nfalling over. \u00a0Taking a deep breath, he\ntook the last two steps toward the tub, bending down just enough so he could\nlet his arm out from under Yoongi\u2019s legs.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cStand\nup for me, yeah? \u00a0Just for a second,\u201d Tae\nmumbled, his arm still secure around Yoongi\u2019s back as the man complied weakly. \u00a0\u201cOkay, good job. \u00a0I\u2019ve got you, just stand still for another\nsecond.\u201d \u00a0Moving carefully, one hand\nsecure on Yoongi\u2019s shoulder and his other arm reaching around to rest securing\naround his ribs, Tae stepped into the tub behind him. \u00a0Yoongi\u2019s back and chest flushed, little\nblotches of red like drops of paint breaking out all over his skin, and his\nsweat made Tae\u2019s hands slip a little, but he pressed his fingers harder into\nthe man\u2019s flesh, ignoring the way Yoongi groaned again and finally moved, his\nhand grabbing Tae\u2019s wrist. \u00a0Unsure if he\nwas just holding on or trying to push him away, Tae shushed him a little. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNeed\nyou to sit down now, okay? \u00a0Gently,\nslowly.\u201d \u00a0Pulling him close as he\nsquatted, Tae let out a breath as Yoongi sat back. \u00a0Letting him go once he was secure on his\nbottom, Tae checked his forehead again, hissing as the man curled up and put\nhis head on his knees.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay,\nthis is going to be cold, but I need you to just sit here for a second,\nokay? \u00a0I\u2019m going to check on the boys and\nget you some water. \u00a0Will you be alright\nfor a minute?\u201d Tae said, watching as Yoongi barely nodded. \u00a0\u201cOkay, okay, then just hold still for me for\na little bit.\u201d \u00a0Patting Yoongi\u2019s head\nonce, Tae pushed himself up from the side of the tub, fiddling with the handles\na little before the shower came on. \u00a0The\nfirst spray was frigid, and Yoongi let out a small cry, jerking a little.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cSorry,\nsorry. \u00a0I know,\u201d Tae mumbled, making it\nslightly warmer but still keeping it pointed toward the C. \u00a0\u201cJust a minute. \u00a0Hold on.\u201d \nNot waiting to see if Yoongi nodded or even agreed, Tae turned to go,\nstilling the moment he saw the door open, Jimin and Jungkook standing there\nquietly. \u00a0Jungkook had Bun-bun in front\nof his face, his own eyes barely peeking out past the rabbit\u2019s fur, and Jimin\nwas biting his bottom lip, his cheeks and eyes red.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cTae-tae,\u201d\nthe boy said, his lip wobbling the moment he let go of it, \u201cis Yoo-yoo dying?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nTae balked before recovering himself. \n\u201cNo, no. \u00a0Don\u2019t worry. \u00a0He\u2019s just sick.\u201d \u00a0Ushering the boys out, though they both\nseemed reluctant to go, Tae hurried them into the living room. \u00a0\u201cJimin, can you get me a cup? \u00a0Jungkook, we need some clothes for your\nuncle. \u00a0Do you know where those are?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cJung\u2019oo\u2019\n\u2018an help,\u201d Jungkook nodded, his words mostly muffled by his bunny\u2019s fabric as\nhe headed toward the only dresser in the room. \nFollowing him, Tae pulled out what he needed before patting Jungkook\u2019s\nhead in thanks.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWill\nthis do?\u201d Jimin said from the kitchen, emerging from one of the cabinets brandishing\na plastic cup as if it was the Holy Grail.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d\nTae said honestly, smiling at the boy as he took it. \u00a0Filling it up quickly with water, he started\nto carry the items back to the bathroom. \nPausing immediately, however, he turned back to the boys who stopped\nshort, almost bumping into him they were following him so closely.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cBoys,\nyour uncle is sick, and you need to sleep somewhere else tonight.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cCan\nwe stay at yours?\u201d Jimin said hesitantly, but Tae shook his head.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWe\ncan\u2019t leave your uncle alone, can we? \u00a0So\nwe need to make a bed on the floor. \u00a0Do\nyou know where the extra blankets are?\u201d \nJimin nodded, looking across the room at a closet.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\ndon\u2019t know if I can reach,\u201d he mumbled, sounding infinitely displeased with\nhimself.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay,\nokay, don\u2019t hurt yourself. \u00a0But if you\ncan, get them out for us, okay? \u00a0Just\ngive us a minute in the bathroom, alright?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cBathroom\nis pri-bit,\u201d Jungkook nodded into Bun-bun\u2019s back again. \u00a0Unable to keep a small, endearing smile from\nhis face, Tae nodded back before rushing to the bathroom. \u00a0Closing the door again behind him, he closed\nthe toilet seat and put Yoongi\u2019s clothes on it, crouching down by the tub to\nturn the water off. \u00a0By now, Yoongi was\nshaking, his teeth audibly chattering, and the sight made Tae curse under his\nbreath.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cSorry,\nsorry,\u201d he hissed, lifting Yoongi\u2019s head up and pushing his hair out of the\nway. \u00a0His forehead still felt plenty\nwarm, and he put his hand on the back of Yoongi\u2019s neck where his skin was still\nwet to lift the cup to his lips. \u00a0\u201cOpen,\nplease. \u00a0I need you to drink this.\u201d \u00a0Yoongi grunted at him, drops of water falling\nfrom his hair onto his nose and cheeks, but his lips stayed stubbornly pressed\ntogether.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi,\nit\u2019s water. \u00a0Just a sip or two, yeah?\u201d \u00a0The man seemed to think for a second, so Tae\npressed the cup to his lips before removing it. \nThe third time the plastic touched Yoongi\u2019s bottom lip, the man finally\nsighed and open his mouth enough for Tae to tilt some water in. \u00a0Only letting a sip in, he sat it down on the\nedge of the tub out of the way once they were done.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cGood\njob,\u201d he said softly, watching the way Yoongi\u2019s face scrunched up. \u00a0Licking his lips a few times, Yoongi turned\nhis head enough that Tae let go of him to stare back as Yoongi finally opened\nhis eyes. \u00a0Something in them was akin to the\nlook Tae had seen when he found him outside when he had abandoned the boys\ninside, and Tae tried not to frown at how much he hated that look on the man\u2019s\nface, especially since he thought he knew what it was now.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d\nhe said, \u201cthe boys are fine. \u00a0And you\u2019re\ngoing to be. \u00a0We need to get you up and\nchanged and back to bed, though, okay?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d\nYoongi frowned, his voice hoarse and rough. \nCocking his head, Tae frowned back.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWell,\nI\u2019m going to help you out, and then we\u2019ll dry you off, and I brought fresh\nclothes, then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNo,\nhow?\u201d Yoongi asked again, resting his cheek on his knee and sighing again as he\nshuddered. \u00a0Purely instinctually, Tae put\na hand on his back, trying to calm him down.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nheard the boys crying. \u00a0You-you should\nreally lock your door, you know?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d\nYoongi said, closing his eyes and taking a few deep breaths. \u00a0Giving him a moment, Tae took the opportunity\nto look at the band tattoo on Yoongi\u2019s right bicep. \u00a0From afar, he had thought it was just simply\nblack lines, but up close he realized there were tiny numbers sideways\nalongside the different lines.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\na camera lens,\u201d he mused out loud, his comment making Yoongi\u2019s eyes open again.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYour\ntattoo,\u201d Tae said, moving his hand to run his finger along the band. \u00a0Following his movement, Yoongi\u2019s eyes\nnarrowed a bit before he shivered again, spurring Tae into action. \u00a0\u201cOkay, time to get out. \u00a0Can you stand?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll\ntry,\u201d Yoongi sighed, but Tae still put his hand on his back and held out his\nother one for Yoongi to take. \u00a0The tub\nthankfully had an anti-slip mat in it, so Yoongi was able to get his footing a\nlittle before standing up, Tae standing with him to help him. \u00a0Moving to take both of his hands, Tae stepped\nback a bit as Yoongi lifted one foot and then the other. \u00a0The man let out a gruff laugh which made Tae\nraise his eyebrows at him once he was out of the bathtub.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cFeel\nlike an old man,\u201d Yoongi mumbled.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\nare pretty old. \u00a0Put your hands on the\ncounter,\u201d Tae instructed him, not waiting for any comeback or denial. \u00a0Moving around behind him, Tae put his hands\non Yoongi\u2019s still wet hips as he did so the man knew where he was, only letting\ngo of him to open the cabinet above the toilet to pull a towel out. \u00a0He attributed the shudder that he felt run\nthrough Yoongi\u2019s body when his hands brushed against him to the cold, so he\nhurried to wrap the towel around the man\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cCan\nyou get dressed, or do you want my help?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201c\u2019m\nnot a child,\u201d Yoongi grumbled, and Tae ducked his head behind the man\u2019s back so\nhe couldn\u2019t see him smiling at him in the mirror. \u00a0He must be feeling a little better if he was\nbeing stubborn.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nknow that, but that\u2019s not what I was asking, so don\u2019t speak like a child and\ntell me if you want my help or not,\u201d Tae said. \nWhen Yoongi didn\u2019t respond, he lifted his head curiously to look at the\nman\u2019s face in the mirror. \u00a0His brow was a\nlittle furrowed, and he looked very confused. \nCocking his head again, Tae raised his eyebrows inquisitively. \u00a0Pulling the towel around him, Yoongi shook\nhis head a little and clamped his mouth shut, avoiding Tae\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d\nTae said slowly, stepping away from Yoongi even though he kept an eye on him as\nhe did so, noticing the way his shoulders were slumped. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m going to go check on the boys,\nthen. \u00a0If I hear any alarming noises, I\u2019m\ngoing to come back even if your pants aren\u2019t on or something. \u00a0So hurry up. \nBut go slowly. \u00a0Don\u2019t bend down if\nyou\u2019re really dizzy. \u00a0Are you dizzy?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNo,\nTae, I\u2019m okay,\u201d Yoongi muttered even though Tae knew he wasn\u2019t. \u00a0Humming, unconvinced, Tae patted his shoulder\non top of the towel a couple of times before heading out, his ears perked for\nany sounds of distress. \u00a0He didn\u2019t close\nthe door all the way, either, but left it a little ajar as he hurried back to\nthe living room.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe\nboys had not been idle, though Jimin had been right. \u00a0They couldn\u2019t quite reach the blankets in\nYoongi\u2019s closet, but they had been constructing a way to get to them with the\nboxes they found.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\nwhoa, hold on, no, nope, wait,\u201d Tae almost squeaked, rushing with his hands out\neven as Jimin was climbing up on a flimsy looking cardboard box. \u00a0Frowning fiercely at him, Jimin huffed but\nclimbed down, looking utterly defeated again.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\ntold you I can\u2019t reach them,\u201d he said as if it was all Tae\u2019s fault he was only\nfour and so short.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\nokay, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Tae reassured him, reaching easily up and grabbing a bundle\nof blankets from the top shelf. \u00a0\u201cWe can\nstart with this, and I\u2019ll run and grab some more from my place. \u00a0Can you two set these up on the floor while I\ngo do that really quick?\u201d \u00a0Nodding\nenthusiastically, Jimin and Jungkook took the blankets from him, both of them a\nlittle overburdened; while not heavy, the blankets were large, and they walked\na little like pregnant ladies toward the bed, only stopping when they bumped into\nit. \u00a0Chuckling quietly, Tae half-jogged\nout the door and to his place. \u00a0He was\nstruck by how messy his apartment was in comparison to Yoongi\u2019s, but he only\ntook the time to grab his phone charger and tooth brush along with a stray\nblanket and as many pillows as he could hold. \nJin once told him he had a pillow problem, but Tae only thought he had a\npillow paradise.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe\ndoor still wasn\u2019t locked when he got back, but Yoongi had appeared from the\nbathroom. \u00a0He was leaned on the wall in\nthe hallway, looking winded and still sickly pale, but there was a small smile\non his face. \u00a0It slipped when his eyes left\nthe boys and landed on Tae, but Tae didn\u2019t take it personally. \u00a0He knew, by this point, that he was\nmeddling. \u00a0Yoongi could rightfully tell him\nto fuck off anytime, and he would go. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThough\nhe was used to other people leaving before he did, he knew he should respect\nYoongi\u2019s boundaries. \u00a0It\u2019s why he dropped\nthe blankets and pillows he was carrying on top of Jimin and Jungkook\u2019s heads,\ntheir giggles muffled as they fought their way out before he turned to Yoongi.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cCome\non, old man,\u201d he joked, holding out an arm like he was about to escort a\ndebutant to a ball, \u201clet\u2019s get you to bed.\u201d \nYoongi rolled his eyes but lifted off of the wall and let Tae maneuver\nhis forearm on top of his. \u00a0Wrapping his\nfingers around his for more stability, Tae shuffled slowly toward Yoongi\u2019s bed,\nsteering him clear of the growing pile of fabric on the floor.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoo-yoo,\u201d\nJimin said once he was free from the blankets and noticed his uncle.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHold\non,\u201d Tae warned, holding them back with his hand until Yoongi could sit down on\nthe edge of the bed. \u00a0He started to pull\nhis arm and then his hand away, but Yoongi\u2019s fingers seemed stuck to his. \u00a0Between his. \nYoongi was looking down at their joint hands, and Tae looked down, too,\nstilling himself instead of just whipping his arm away. \u00a0Even though his arm was a bit twisted and he\nhad to move to Yoongi\u2019s side instead of standing in front of him to accommodate\nthe man, Tae didn\u2019t mind. \u00a0Because he was\nseeing something in Yoongi, some side of him he hadn\u2019t before, and for the\nsecond time that day he couldn\u2019t help but look at the man. \u00a0Look at how thin his fingers were, how\npronounced his collarbones were, how pale and soft his skin was, how his mint\ngreen hair fell into his eyes and brushed against his long eyelashes.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHe was undeniably incredibly handsome, and\nTae felt his fingers twitch in his own before Yoongi withdrew his hand, letting\nit fall lamely onto his thigh as he mumbled something. \u00a0Another group of blotches appeared on his\nskin, and Tae realized the man was blushing. \nHe tried to draw his own hand back slowly, his palm still warm from\nwhere Yoongi\u2019s fingers had held on tightly, as he continued to look at the\nman. \u00a0A small person brushing past him\nfinally distracted him, though, and he took an awkward step back as Jimin and\nJungkook clung to their uncle\u2019s legs, staring up at him with frowns.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoo-yoo,\nare you okay?\u201d Jimin said.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll\nbe fine,\u201d Yoongi grimaced, forcing a smile that Tae saw right through.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cTae-tae\u2019s\ngonna stay with us, okay?\u201d Jimin continued, suddenly sounding like he was the\nadult in the room.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cJimin,\nwe can\u2019t make\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNo,\nhe said, he said. \u00a0Right, Tae-tae?\u201d Jimin\nsaid, looking up with wide, pleading eyes and a pout that rivaled the cutest\npuppies Tae had ever seen, and Tae had seen a lot of sickeningly cute puppies.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI-I\ndid offer. \u00a0I mean, if it\u2019s okay with\nyour uncle. \u00a0I-I don\u2019t want to\nintrude.\u201d \u00a0Yoongi opened his mouth as he\nfrowned up at Tae, but he seemed to decide against whatever he was going to\nsay.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIf\nyou get sick, don\u2019t blame me,\u201d Yoongi sighed, patting Jungkook\u2019s head before\nlying down on his side. \u00a0Jungkook started\nto climb up onto the mattress with him, but Tae finally stepped forward to pick\nthe boy up, swinging him around a few times before placing him on a pillow on\nthe ground.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYour\nuncle needs the bed himself tonight, okay? \nWe\u2019re going to make a bed on the floor.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cCan\nwe make a tent?\u201d Jimin suggested, leaning on the mattress still as he watched\nYoongi close his eyes.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cA\ntent?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cA\nfort.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nbet we can, as long as we\u2019re quiet so Yoongi can sleep,\u201d Tae said, tapping his\nchin as if in deep thought.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoo-yoo,\u201d\nJungkook corrected him.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\nright. \u00a0Yoo-yoo,\u201d Tae winked at the\nlittle boy who shot him a shy grin back before stuffing his face into Bun-bun\nand rolling off the pillow he was on into the pile of blankets. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m going to order food, too, for\ndinner. \u00a0Is that okay, Yoo-yoo?\u201d \u00a0He couldn\u2019t help the teasing tone in his\nvoice, but when he grinned down at Yoongi, the man didn\u2019t respond, his mouth\nalready slightly open and his breath heavy. \n</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d\nTae whispered, putting a finger to his lips to Jimin and Jungkook. \u00a0They both copied the action, and Jungkook\nseemed to find it hilarious as he broke into a peel of laughter before clamping\na hand over his mouth, his eyes wide in shock. \nSnorting, Tae reached past Yoongi to pull the covers over him. \u00a0Unable to resist, he placed his hand on the\nman\u2019s forehead one more time. \u00a0He was\nstill abnormally warm, but when he hummed and pushed his head a little forward\ninto Tae\u2019s palm, Tae couldn\u2019t help but run his fingers through his hair a few\ntimes as his breathing evened out.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cGood\nnight, Yoo-yoo,\u201d he whispered, smiling at how beautiful Yoongi looked while he\nslept. \u00a0If he didn\u2019t have to attend to\nthe children behind him, he would have loved to keep looking at Yoongi for hours,\ndetermined to see every side, every part, every frown, every smile that the man\ncould offer.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fever dreams, in a word, are\nweird. \u00a0If Yoongi didn\u2019t already know he\nwas sick, the dreams would have been a giant neon flashing sign indicating how his\nbrain was slowly being melted. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The dreams that made no sense were\nalarming. \u00a0The ones where he couldn\u2019t\nidentify anyone\u2019s face because they kept ballooning up before shrinking down,\ntheir eyes melting and mouths twisting like some Picasso painting left out in\nthe rain. \u00a0The ones that kept restarting\nlike some saved video game as he ran down a mountain away from ninjas on\nbicycles and then from bears who chased him to the top of a roof he tried to\njump off and then from what looked like ninja bears who finally made him wake\nup in a cold sweat. \u00a0The ones he couldn\u2019t\nremember but he knew felt so real they were so vivid in the middle of them that\nhe didn\u2019t know he was dreaming but ended up being black holes, leaving him with\nnothing but a sense of unease when he woke. \nThese dreams, the one a therapist might want to analyze in excruciating\ndetail, made no sense, but their tone was the same. \u00a0Despair and survival and fear pervaded\nthrough them all.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The dreams of his neighbor were\nconfusing, because Yoongi didn\u2019t often recognize the people in his dreams. \u00a0He wasn\u2019t used to his dreams recurring,\neither, but it seemed like every time he slipped into sleep, Tae was there. \u00a0He was an outside observer the first time,\nlike a hovering camera attached to a drone. \nTae was riding on, of all things, an elephant. \u00a0The figure on top of the giant animal was so\nobviously Tae. \u00a0He was too tan to be\nanyone else, and his smile, a big, boxy, goofy smile so proud like he had just\ntamed this wild beast and claimed it as his own, was so obviously Tae. \u00a0Still, the image was so bizarre that Yoongi\u2019s\nmind tried to change the channel.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next time he saw Tae, he was\nsitting in a coffee shop. \u00a0The setting\nsoothed his mind, and since he was aware he was dreaming, he allowed himself to\nsettle into this dream. \u00a0He could almost\nhear the soft jazz playing through the speakers. \u00a0He could almost hear the hiss of the espresso\nmachine and the calling of names and clacking of computer keyboards and humming\nof someone sitting next to him. \u00a0For some\nreason, it was Sunmi. \u00a0And while part of\nhis brain questioned her appearance immediately, dream Yoongi was completely at\nease. \u00a0It made sense in Yoongi\u2019s consciousness,\nhe rationalized later. \u00a0He had always\nfelt comfortable around Sunmi. \u00a0They had\nbeen friends first, and most of their communication had been in the form of\nsarcasm and teasing. \u00a0Even when they\nbroke up, it was completely amenable. \nNothing had been wrong in their relationship, but they both realized\nthey had gotten and stayed together more for comfortability than\ncompatibility. \u00a0They had sat in many a coffee\nshop almost daily when they dated, so Yoongi almost thought he was dreaming a\nmemory. \u00a0She was as gorgeous as the last\ntime he had seen her, her cheekbones high and lips painted a vibrant red, her\nfavorite shade. \u00a0She didn\u2019t look up from\nher phone or her book once, but even that didn\u2019t bother Yoongi. \u00a0It was comfortable, and it was the first pleasant\ndream he could recall having since he had gotten sick.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But then some commotion caught his\nattention, instantly shattering any pretense that this was a memory. \u00a0The shouting and yelling was almost comical,\nlike he was watching some bad drama, but the sound of a slap was what made him\nrise. \u00a0He felt see-through, though, like\nhe didn\u2019t have legs. \u00a0He couldn\u2019t see his\nown hands, even, but he was moving across the shop that soon dissolved into a\ndumpster, no, a trash pile, no, an entire dump. \nTrash looming all around him, boxes and stacks of trash, bags and stray\nitems, discarded food and broken toys, clothes with holes and books with\nmold. \u00a0He wanted to stop, to turn around,\nto run away from all of that, or stay and clean it, but he heard another smack,\nclearly someone\u2019s skin hitting another, so he stumbled over and pushed through\nthe waste in front of him until it disappeared. \n</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHis\nneighbor was sitting in the corner holding his hand to his cheek, and some\nnameless and faceless entity was standing over him, more of a black, formless\nshape than man, though its voice was rough and jeering and biting as it\nshouted, so Yoongi, who, once he got past his anger stage, couldn\u2019t imagine\never hitting anyone for any reason, rushed forward to push the man, the thing,\nout of the way, except the moment he lunged at it, it disappeared. \u00a0He stumbled over his own feet, then, and fell\nonto his knees, staring at the hands that had appeared. \u00a0He became fascinated by them because they\nweren\u2019t his hands. \u00a0They couldn\u2019t be; there\nwas no tattoo on his arms, and he had this one vein that always stuck out,\nprotruding a little, on his left hand. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThese\nhands weren\u2019t his, but he recognized them. \nHe made a fist and twisted them around, looking at the back of\nthem. \u00a0At the back of his brother\u2019s hands. \u00a0When he heard a whimper in the corner, his\neyes finally snapped up, but Tae was gone. \nJimin was huddled there instead, his puffy cheeks red and wet with tears\nas he shook, and Jungkook stood in front of him, his arms out and his feet spread\nwide as if to shield his brother from view.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Yoongi\u2014his brother? his brother\u2019s hands\u2014reached toward him, though,\nthe boy actually growled and bore his teeth, no small rabbit teeth turning into\nsharp razor fangs, the hands recoiled immediately, so quickly that Yoongi felt\nhimself stumble backwards, falling back, back, back, until he fell out of the\ndream completely and onto his bed so quickly the air got knocked out of him,\nand he sat up, gasping for breath.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi?\u201d\na deep and sleep addled voice mumbled, and Yoongi clamped his eyes shut to stop\nthe world from spinning, to stop anything from spilling out of him.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi? \u00a0Breathe, Yoongi,\u201d the voice said, and he did,\nharshly, the release so painful he felt like he had been punched. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re\nokay.\u201d \u00a0The voice had a body. \u00a0It was real, and warm, and its hand was\nrubbing Yoongi\u2019s back as he hunched over, putting his head between his knees\nand clenching his fingers around his shins. \n</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cThere\nwe go. \u00a0In and out. \u00a0Did you have a nightmare?\u201d \u00a0Nodding gently, Yoongi heard the voice sigh\nin sympathy.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDo\nyou want to tell me about it?\u201d \u00a0He\ndid. \u00a0He wanted to tell him how afraid he\nwas. \u00a0How much he felt like he was\nmessing up. \u00a0How easily and quickly dreams\ncould become reality and reality could merge into dreams. \u00a0But he shook his head, instead. \u00a0\u201cOkay, that\u2019s okay. \u00a0Do you want some water?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cJun-Junki,\u201d\nYoongi shuddered, trying to fold into himself more and more. \u00a0\u201cI dreamed you\u2014you died. \u00a0You left me, and, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\nYoongi,\u201d the voice said slowly, the hand stilling on his back. \u00a0Another shudder, and the hand started to move\naway. \u00a0\u201cOkay, let\u2019s lay you back\ndown. \u00a0Can you do that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d\nYoongi pleaded, fumbling to grab onto something and falling into the voice\u2019s\nchest. \u00a0It, he, was so warm, warm and welcoming,\nand Yoongi wanted to stay there forever. \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me again. \u00a0I-I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cO-okay,\u201d\nthe voice said uneasily. \u00a0\u201cOkay, I-I\u2019m\nhere. \u00a0Just-just lie down, again? \u00a0Here we go.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nYoongi\nlet himself be guided, led, moved because it\u2019s what he needed. \u00a0He needed just one good dream, just one\ncomforting thought. \u00a0He needed the hand\nbrushing through his hair and the arm holding him close. \u00a0He needed the chest to sob into, the warm\nskin to welcome him back even after he had been away for so long. \u00a0He needed that voice to tell him he was going\nto be alright, that they were going to be alright, that everything was going to\nbe alright.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay,\nokay,\u201d it said, which was almost good enough. \nIt almost sounded like him. \u00a0It\nwas almost too good.

Fever Dreams</b></p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Yoongi was, honestly, impressed and\nsurprised and a little bit proud of himself for making it so long before it\nhappened. \u00a0He\u2019s always been introverted,\nso to have gone from living alone and having every minute to himself if he so\nwished to suddenly never being alone even when he was just trying to go to the\nbathroom was a difficult whirlwind to adjust to. \u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nHe\nhas never been one to yell\u2014he can remember the three times he has yelled at\nsomeone in his adult life exactly as if they just happened yesterday: one, when\nhe finally resorted to raising his voice to convince his parents he was serious\nabout dropping out of school; two, when he was so, incredibly,\nwill-never-be-that-badly-drunk-again and thought he had lost his brother so he\nwent around screaming his head off in a crowded street in the middle of the\nnight like an absolute lunatic; and three, when he was so embarrassed after\nconfessing to Namjoon that he reacted by trying to get him to leave him alone,\nbut no amount of yelling would ever make Namjoon stop being his friend, so he\nhad never screamed at him again. \u00a0He had\nalways leaned toward melting down, imploding, instead of exploding, tended to\nshut down and shut people out instead of complaining and drawing attention to\nhimself.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHe\nalso was used to pressing everything down and holding everything in, keeping\neverything to himself instead of reaching out to others even if all he wanted\nwas someone to come alongside and help him. \nThat\u2019s why, every time he has ever had a bad meltdown or had gotten\nsick, it always hit him alarmingly quickly, like a freight train, like a thief\nin the night. \u00a0The lack of warning made\nit worse because that was what made him feel completely out of control,\nhelpless and vulnerable. \u00a0Weak and\npathetic.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHe\ncould hear the boys waking up. \u00a0Their\nvoices sounded muffled and distant, like they were underwater, and some\nirrational fear that they were drowning in the bathtub is what made him sit up,\nimmediately regretting his decision as he groaned and grabbed his head to keep\nthe world from turning upside down.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s\nawa\u2019e!\u201d Jungkook shouted, his continual need to be right in Yoongi\u2019s face, to\ninvade his space, extremely frustrating for some reason this morning. \u00a0With his eyes squinted shut, all of the skin\non his face feeling pulled tight and yet so loose it might be melting off his\nskull, Yoongi reached out blindly and tried to move the boy away from him as\ngently as possible. \u00a0The movement,\nhowever, caused his stomach to lurch, and with a curse, a thud, another curse,\nJimin screaming a reprimand at him, and Jungkook letting out a little breath as\nhe collided with something, Yoongi tumbled off of the bed, only prying his eyes\nopen enough to stumble into the bathroom, slamming the door behind him.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nYoongi\ncouldn\u2019t recall the last time he threw up. \nHe could remember it; he knew it was some dumb decision when he was\ntrying to pretend he didn\u2019t care about anything while really all he wanted in\nthe world was his parent\u2019s approval and his brother\u2019s love and Namjoon\u2019s\nsupport and his work to have purpose and success because he was working his ass\noff even though no one seemed to care or notice, and he knew he didn\u2019t like\ngetting that drunk again and stuck to wine or whiskey now to avoid going\noverboard, but he had forgotten how awful it was. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHow\nmuch it absolutely wracked his small frame and made tears prickle in his eyes\ninvoluntarily. \u00a0How much it stung and lingered\neven after he brushed his teeth multiple times. \nHow it made his entire body shake and break into a sweat. \u00a0How, for a split second, it always made him\nfeel like he was actually dying. \u00a0How, of\nall of the gross things he had had to deal with in the past few weeks\u2014mainly,\nurine\u2014it was by far his least favorite thing to clean up, and even though he\nneeded to wipe down the toilet and scrub the floor and brush his teeth for the\nthird time, he found himself slinking back to the ground, sweating and\nbreathing heavily, groaning as he heard the boys pounding on the door, Jimin\u2019s\nscreams louder than anything at all. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHis\narms were too weak to reach the handle, and if his throat didn\u2019t feel like he\nhad swallowed a slug covered in poison meant to burn his esophagus, he would\nhave told the boys to just come in, but he closed his eyes instead, barely registering\nhow Jimin\u2019s screams and the pounding stopped as their little feet padded away.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nTae\nisn\u2019t exactly sure why Eunnie had sent him five pictures of his neighbor at the\ndaycare taking pictures of kids with the message \u201cLook what you missed out\non.\u201d \u00a0The embarrassment had hit him first\nmixed with regret and annoyance at himself. \nHe remembered Eunnie mentioning having him come and take pictures. \u00a0He knew Jin had mentioned it at least once or\ntwice, too. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBut\nEunnie, even though she has grown annoyed with him before and vocally shared\nher frustration with Jin or straight up to him, would never gloat or make fun\nof him so blatantly. \u00a0So it took him a\nsecond to register who was in the picture. \nHer text must have meant that he missed out on seeing Yoongi, then, and\nit took him several steps of staring at his phone with a frown before he\nfigured out what she could mean.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nWith\na groan, he promised himself to stop telling everything to Jin even after the\nguy had promised he wouldn\u2019t tell anyone else. \nTae kept forgetting that that rule didn\u2019t seem to apply to his\nwife. \u00a0Something gross about being one\nflesh or \u201cshe\u2019s my everything\u201d or \u201cshe can tell when I\u2019m hiding something, so\nto protect my beautiful face I never do so.\u201d \n</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHe\nmay have, in passing, said something about Yoongi to Jin at some point. \u00a0He may have mentioned Yoongi getting jealous\nthat one day he had seen Jin at his place. \nJin may have laughed at him. \u00a0Tae\nmay have gotten fussy and grumbled about how he wasn\u2019t helping. \u00a0He may have said something about how much he\nliked his tattoos and how distracting seeing Yoongi shirtless while he hovered\nover him on his couch had been. \u00a0He may\nhave pretended to ignore the smirk and eyebrow raise Jin had given him.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nGroaning\nagain at how careless he had been, Tae kept looking at the pictures of Yoongi\nas he climbed the steps to his apartment. \nDespite how easily distracted and scatterbrained Tae was, he could\nconcentrate when he needed to. \u00a0And he\noften stared at people, not in a creepy way, except they often thought so if\nthey were strangers and noticed him doing it, but because he considered them\nwalking pieces of art, and art was meant to be admired. \u00a0He loved looking from afar and up close,\nbecause perspective can change everything. \nHe once told Jin that he never felt like he really knew a person until\nhe had seen them in a multitude of places. \nHe meant that people are different at home and at work, often, so to\ntruly know them you have to observe them in both places. \u00a0Jin had mentioned something perverted about\nhow many people Tae wanted to see in bed, too, and while Tae had not responded,\nhe wasn\u2019t exactly wrong. \u00a0To see someone\nhappy and sad, stressed and angry, tired and sick, at their best and at their\nworst, is the only way to truly know someone. \nHe complained often to Jin, each time a boyfriend or potential date left\nhim, that they never stuck around long enough to see him in all areas. \u00a0Jin had made another crude joke, but Tae knew\nhe was just trying to lighten the mood. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nLooking\nat Yoongi\u2019s pictures, Tae simply felt like he was seeing him in a different\nlight. \u00a0He had seen the man crying, had\nseen him exhausted and at his last rope, and anyone else might just assume that\nthat was all the man had to offer. \nFrowns and baggy eyes and hurried conversations because he had to get\nback to his kids. \u00a0Tae had seen the man\nas a dad, or, an uncle, a care giver. \nBut he hadn\u2019t seen him at work. \nHe hadn\u2019t seen him really smile yet, he didn\u2019t think. \u00a0A few polite grins or ones of relief, sure,\nbut each of those told a different story. \nThe Yoongi he saw on his small phone screen told him something more than\nhe had ever gleaned from seeing the man in person. \u00a0He was clearly passionate. \u00a0He concentrated and worked hard. \u00a0But he felt overwhelmed, probably by the\nkids, if Tae remembered correctly what Yoongi had said about how much he didn\u2019t\nlike to photograph people, and looked exhausted. \u00a0The exhaustion wasn\u2019t like what Tae had seen\nbefore, though, and the frown on Yoongi\u2019s face wasn\u2019t one of anger. \u00a0The man looked like he was about to fall\napart even with a camera half-hiding his face, and it was that look that Tae\ncouldn\u2019t look away from.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHe\nknew that Yoongi was older than him, but something in the man\u2019s face and body\nposture, the way he had squatted down to be at eye-level with each kid, made\nhim look much younger. \u00a0Smaller, too, but\nTae already knew the man was shorter than him. \nHe couldn\u2019t see any of his tattoos, the man\u2019s sleeves covering them up,\nbut he was imaging them. \u00a0Art on art, is\nwhat they were. \u00a0They made Yoongi look\neven more beautiful, or he made them stand out more. \u00a0Tae wasn\u2019t sure which was enhancing the other. \u00a0All he knew was Eunnie was right. \u00a0He had missed out on not only another job,\nbut also on seeing Yoongi at work, and as he scaled the top of the stairs, he\npaused by the guy\u2019s door, wondering how much his neighbor would hate him for\ndropping in unannounced. \u00a0He could always\ngo home and text him to make it look more planned, but several sounds made him\nstop and frown at the blue door before he could.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nWhile\nhe had really only heard Jungkook and Jimin crying once before, he didn\u2019t think\nhe would ever forget what their cries sounded like. \u00a0They seemed to have struck his heart deep\nenough that even the quiet sound of them dug into his flesh even more, the pain\nspreading and panic welling. \u00a0Without\nwaiting to text or give Yoongi any other sort of warning, he rose his fist to\npound on the door. \u00a0He wanted to think\nthat the guy hadn\u2019t lost it in the middle of the day. \u00a0He hoped there was more to him, more good,\nnever more bad, behind the exterior he had. \nTae hoped he hadn\u2019t misjudged him. \nHe didn\u2019t have the best track record when it came to trusting men in his\nlife, or so Jin had told him over and over again. \u00a0But Yoongi seemed different. \u00a0Or Tae wanted him to be. \u00a0Yoongi was\u2014</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi?\u201d\nTae said, pounding on the door again. \u00a0He\nheard someone crying and someone else mumbling, the sounds too low to the\nground and high-pitched to be a grown man. \n\u201cJimin? \u00a0Jungkook?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cTae-tae?\u201d\nJimin said through the door, and Tae sighed in relief, his fist leaving the\ndoor to curl around the doorknob.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\ncoming in, okay?\u201d \u00a0Not waiting for an answer,\nand really hoping Yoongi wasn\u2019t on the other side of the door ready to knife\nsomeone for breaking in, Tae pushed the door open, meeting a little resistance\nthat he realized was the cowering bodies of two small boys, both who started to\ngrab at his pants and gasp a little as they both started to rattle on. \u00a0Tae caught \u201cYoo-yoo\u201d and \u201cbathroom\u201d enough\nbetween the pair of them, their words frantic and jumbled, to know where he\nneeded to go, so making sure he closed the door and placed what he hoped was a\nsoothing hand on both of the boys\u2019 shoulders, he trotted down the short hallway\nto where the bathroom must be.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi?\u201d\nhe called before trying the door. \u00a0He\nkept one hand behind him to keep the boys back despite how much they were\ncrowding around him, afraid of what he might find. \u00a0After finding his own grandma collapsed in\nher bedroom floor when he was ten, he had been aware of how scarring the sight\nof someone you love who is in charge of taking care of you looking seemingly\ndead can be for a child. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi?\u201d\nhe said again, closing the door behind him before the boys could slip in,\nignoring how Jimin started yelling again, his and Jungkook\u2019s feet kicking at\nthe door. \u00a0Compared to Tae, Yoongi was\npale. \u00a0Tae had noticed that when he first\nbecame aware of the man. \u00a0His skin looked\nlike porcelain, and right now he looked fragile enough to break if touched, but\nTae dropped to the floor immediately, placing his hand on the man\u2019s sweaty brow\nand hissing at how warm he felt.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi?\u201d\nhe said again, his nose wrinkling at how smelly the small room was. \u00a0Trying to be gentle, he peeled up one of\nYoongi\u2019s eyelids to see his pupils wide. \nThe man groaned a bit, enough of a sign for Tae to know he was at least\nnot dead, and he felt his heart calm immediately. \u00a0Still, he looked terrible, and Tae\u2019s brain\nworked quickly, trying to remember the steps to take. \u00a0One time when Hoseok was three he had gotten\nsick at Tae\u2019s house, and he had gone so pale and clammy so quickly that Tae\nalmost called 119, but Eunnie had walked him through what to do calmly over the\nphone as she and Jin headed back early.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi?\u201d\nTae repeated, not really waiting for the man to reply, just wanting to try to\nget his attention and inform him of what he was doing so he wouldn\u2019t freak\nout. \u00a0\u201cI need to get you to the bath. \u00a0Can you stand?\u201d \u00a0Yoongi grunted, and he started to push\nhimself off of the wall and floor at the same time, which Tae knew wasn\u2019t going\nto work for long, so he took advantage of Yoongi lifting himself just enough to\nslide an arm under his knees and around his back. \u00a0Despite his small size, Yoongi definitely\nweighed more than Hoseok, and Tae tottered a bit as he stood up, thankful that\nthe wall was so close and Yoongi seemed to be pressing his hand flat against it\nas they rose. \u00a0He only had a few feet to\ngo, anyway, but he moved carefully more than quickly, noting how Yoongi mumbled\nsomething before sinking forward a little, his head ducked and causing enough\nof a shift in balance for Tae to press his own back against the wall to avoid\nfalling over. \u00a0Taking a deep breath, he\ntook the last two steps toward the tub, bending down just enough so he could\nlet his arm out from under Yoongi\u2019s legs.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cStand\nup for me, yeah? \u00a0Just for a second,\u201d Tae\nmumbled, his arm still secure around Yoongi\u2019s back as the man complied weakly. \u00a0\u201cOkay, good job. \u00a0I\u2019ve got you, just stand still for another\nsecond.\u201d \u00a0Moving carefully, one hand\nsecure on Yoongi\u2019s shoulder and his other arm reaching around to rest securing\naround his ribs, Tae stepped into the tub behind him. \u00a0Yoongi\u2019s back and chest flushed, little\nblotches of red like drops of paint breaking out all over his skin, and his\nsweat made Tae\u2019s hands slip a little, but he pressed his fingers harder into\nthe man\u2019s flesh, ignoring the way Yoongi groaned again and finally moved, his\nhand grabbing Tae\u2019s wrist. \u00a0Unsure if he\nwas just holding on or trying to push him away, Tae shushed him a little. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNeed\nyou to sit down now, okay? \u00a0Gently,\nslowly.\u201d \u00a0Pulling him close as he\nsquatted, Tae let out a breath as Yoongi sat back. \u00a0Letting him go once he was secure on his\nbottom, Tae checked his forehead again, hissing as the man curled up and put\nhis head on his knees.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay,\nthis is going to be cold, but I need you to just sit here for a second,\nokay? \u00a0I\u2019m going to check on the boys and\nget you some water. \u00a0Will you be alright\nfor a minute?\u201d Tae said, watching as Yoongi barely nodded. \u00a0\u201cOkay, okay, then just hold still for me for\na little bit.\u201d \u00a0Patting Yoongi\u2019s head\nonce, Tae pushed himself up from the side of the tub, fiddling with the handles\na little before the shower came on. \u00a0The\nfirst spray was frigid, and Yoongi let out a small cry, jerking a little.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cSorry,\nsorry. \u00a0I know,\u201d Tae mumbled, making it\nslightly warmer but still keeping it pointed toward the C. \u00a0\u201cJust a minute. \u00a0Hold on.\u201d \nNot waiting to see if Yoongi nodded or even agreed, Tae turned to go,\nstilling the moment he saw the door open, Jimin and Jungkook standing there\nquietly. \u00a0Jungkook had Bun-bun in front\nof his face, his own eyes barely peeking out past the rabbit\u2019s fur, and Jimin\nwas biting his bottom lip, his cheeks and eyes red.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cTae-tae,\u201d\nthe boy said, his lip wobbling the moment he let go of it, \u201cis Yoo-yoo dying?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nTae balked before recovering himself. \n\u201cNo, no. \u00a0Don\u2019t worry. \u00a0He\u2019s just sick.\u201d \u00a0Ushering the boys out, though they both\nseemed reluctant to go, Tae hurried them into the living room. \u00a0\u201cJimin, can you get me a cup? \u00a0Jungkook, we need some clothes for your\nuncle. \u00a0Do you know where those are?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cJung\u2019oo\u2019\n\u2018an help,\u201d Jungkook nodded, his words mostly muffled by his bunny\u2019s fabric as\nhe headed toward the only dresser in the room. \nFollowing him, Tae pulled out what he needed before patting Jungkook\u2019s\nhead in thanks.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWill\nthis do?\u201d Jimin said from the kitchen, emerging from one of the cabinets brandishing\na plastic cup as if it was the Holy Grail.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d\nTae said honestly, smiling at the boy as he took it. \u00a0Filling it up quickly with water, he started\nto carry the items back to the bathroom. \nPausing immediately, however, he turned back to the boys who stopped\nshort, almost bumping into him they were following him so closely.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cBoys,\nyour uncle is sick, and you need to sleep somewhere else tonight.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cCan\nwe stay at yours?\u201d Jimin said hesitantly, but Tae shook his head.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWe\ncan\u2019t leave your uncle alone, can we? \u00a0So\nwe need to make a bed on the floor. \u00a0Do\nyou know where the extra blankets are?\u201d \nJimin nodded, looking across the room at a closet.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\ndon\u2019t know if I can reach,\u201d he mumbled, sounding infinitely displeased with\nhimself.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay,\nokay, don\u2019t hurt yourself. \u00a0But if you\ncan, get them out for us, okay? \u00a0Just\ngive us a minute in the bathroom, alright?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cBathroom\nis pri-bit,\u201d Jungkook nodded into Bun-bun\u2019s back again. \u00a0Unable to keep a small, endearing smile from\nhis face, Tae nodded back before rushing to the bathroom. \u00a0Closing the door again behind him, he closed\nthe toilet seat and put Yoongi\u2019s clothes on it, crouching down by the tub to\nturn the water off. \u00a0By now, Yoongi was\nshaking, his teeth audibly chattering, and the sight made Tae curse under his\nbreath.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cSorry,\nsorry,\u201d he hissed, lifting Yoongi\u2019s head up and pushing his hair out of the\nway. \u00a0His forehead still felt plenty\nwarm, and he put his hand on the back of Yoongi\u2019s neck where his skin was still\nwet to lift the cup to his lips. \u00a0\u201cOpen,\nplease. \u00a0I need you to drink this.\u201d \u00a0Yoongi grunted at him, drops of water falling\nfrom his hair onto his nose and cheeks, but his lips stayed stubbornly pressed\ntogether.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi,\nit\u2019s water. \u00a0Just a sip or two, yeah?\u201d \u00a0The man seemed to think for a second, so Tae\npressed the cup to his lips before removing it. \nThe third time the plastic touched Yoongi\u2019s bottom lip, the man finally\nsighed and open his mouth enough for Tae to tilt some water in. \u00a0Only letting a sip in, he sat it down on the\nedge of the tub out of the way once they were done.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cGood\njob,\u201d he said softly, watching the way Yoongi\u2019s face scrunched up. \u00a0Licking his lips a few times, Yoongi turned\nhis head enough that Tae let go of him to stare back as Yoongi finally opened\nhis eyes. \u00a0Something in them was akin to the\nlook Tae had seen when he found him outside when he had abandoned the boys\ninside, and Tae tried not to frown at how much he hated that look on the man\u2019s\nface, especially since he thought he knew what it was now.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d\nhe said, \u201cthe boys are fine. \u00a0And you\u2019re\ngoing to be. \u00a0We need to get you up and\nchanged and back to bed, though, okay?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d\nYoongi frowned, his voice hoarse and rough. \nCocking his head, Tae frowned back.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWell,\nI\u2019m going to help you out, and then we\u2019ll dry you off, and I brought fresh\nclothes, then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNo,\nhow?\u201d Yoongi asked again, resting his cheek on his knee and sighing again as he\nshuddered. \u00a0Purely instinctually, Tae put\na hand on his back, trying to calm him down.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nheard the boys crying. \u00a0You-you should\nreally lock your door, you know?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d\nYoongi said, closing his eyes and taking a few deep breaths. \u00a0Giving him a moment, Tae took the opportunity\nto look at the band tattoo on Yoongi\u2019s right bicep. \u00a0From afar, he had thought it was just simply\nblack lines, but up close he realized there were tiny numbers sideways\nalongside the different lines.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\na camera lens,\u201d he mused out loud, his comment making Yoongi\u2019s eyes open again.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYour\ntattoo,\u201d Tae said, moving his hand to run his finger along the band. \u00a0Following his movement, Yoongi\u2019s eyes\nnarrowed a bit before he shivered again, spurring Tae into action. \u00a0\u201cOkay, time to get out. \u00a0Can you stand?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll\ntry,\u201d Yoongi sighed, but Tae still put his hand on his back and held out his\nother one for Yoongi to take. \u00a0The tub\nthankfully had an anti-slip mat in it, so Yoongi was able to get his footing a\nlittle before standing up, Tae standing with him to help him. \u00a0Moving to take both of his hands, Tae stepped\nback a bit as Yoongi lifted one foot and then the other. \u00a0The man let out a gruff laugh which made Tae\nraise his eyebrows at him once he was out of the bathtub.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cFeel\nlike an old man,\u201d Yoongi mumbled.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\nare pretty old. \u00a0Put your hands on the\ncounter,\u201d Tae instructed him, not waiting for any comeback or denial. \u00a0Moving around behind him, Tae put his hands\non Yoongi\u2019s still wet hips as he did so the man knew where he was, only letting\ngo of him to open the cabinet above the toilet to pull a towel out. \u00a0He attributed the shudder that he felt run\nthrough Yoongi\u2019s body when his hands brushed against him to the cold, so he\nhurried to wrap the towel around the man\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cCan\nyou get dressed, or do you want my help?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201c\u2019m\nnot a child,\u201d Yoongi grumbled, and Tae ducked his head behind the man\u2019s back so\nhe couldn\u2019t see him smiling at him in the mirror. \u00a0He must be feeling a little better if he was\nbeing stubborn.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nknow that, but that\u2019s not what I was asking, so don\u2019t speak like a child and\ntell me if you want my help or not,\u201d Tae said. \nWhen Yoongi didn\u2019t respond, he lifted his head curiously to look at the\nman\u2019s face in the mirror. \u00a0His brow was a\nlittle furrowed, and he looked very confused. \nCocking his head again, Tae raised his eyebrows inquisitively. \u00a0Pulling the towel around him, Yoongi shook\nhis head a little and clamped his mouth shut, avoiding Tae\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d\nTae said slowly, stepping away from Yoongi even though he kept an eye on him as\nhe did so, noticing the way his shoulders were slumped. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m going to go check on the boys,\nthen. \u00a0If I hear any alarming noises, I\u2019m\ngoing to come back even if your pants aren\u2019t on or something. \u00a0So hurry up. \nBut go slowly. \u00a0Don\u2019t bend down if\nyou\u2019re really dizzy. \u00a0Are you dizzy?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNo,\nTae, I\u2019m okay,\u201d Yoongi muttered even though Tae knew he wasn\u2019t. \u00a0Humming, unconvinced, Tae patted his shoulder\non top of the towel a couple of times before heading out, his ears perked for\nany sounds of distress. \u00a0He didn\u2019t close\nthe door all the way, either, but left it a little ajar as he hurried back to\nthe living room.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe\nboys had not been idle, though Jimin had been right. \u00a0They couldn\u2019t quite reach the blankets in\nYoongi\u2019s closet, but they had been constructing a way to get to them with the\nboxes they found.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\nwhoa, hold on, no, nope, wait,\u201d Tae almost squeaked, rushing with his hands out\neven as Jimin was climbing up on a flimsy looking cardboard box. \u00a0Frowning fiercely at him, Jimin huffed but\nclimbed down, looking utterly defeated again.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\ntold you I can\u2019t reach them,\u201d he said as if it was all Tae\u2019s fault he was only\nfour and so short.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\nokay, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Tae reassured him, reaching easily up and grabbing a bundle\nof blankets from the top shelf. \u00a0\u201cWe can\nstart with this, and I\u2019ll run and grab some more from my place. \u00a0Can you two set these up on the floor while I\ngo do that really quick?\u201d \u00a0Nodding\nenthusiastically, Jimin and Jungkook took the blankets from him, both of them a\nlittle overburdened; while not heavy, the blankets were large, and they walked\na little like pregnant ladies toward the bed, only stopping when they bumped into\nit. \u00a0Chuckling quietly, Tae half-jogged\nout the door and to his place. \u00a0He was\nstruck by how messy his apartment was in comparison to Yoongi\u2019s, but he only\ntook the time to grab his phone charger and tooth brush along with a stray\nblanket and as many pillows as he could hold. \nJin once told him he had a pillow problem, but Tae only thought he had a\npillow paradise.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe\ndoor still wasn\u2019t locked when he got back, but Yoongi had appeared from the\nbathroom. \u00a0He was leaned on the wall in\nthe hallway, looking winded and still sickly pale, but there was a small smile\non his face. \u00a0It slipped when his eyes left\nthe boys and landed on Tae, but Tae didn\u2019t take it personally. \u00a0He knew, by this point, that he was\nmeddling. \u00a0Yoongi could rightfully tell him\nto fuck off anytime, and he would go. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThough\nhe was used to other people leaving before he did, he knew he should respect\nYoongi\u2019s boundaries. \u00a0It\u2019s why he dropped\nthe blankets and pillows he was carrying on top of Jimin and Jungkook\u2019s heads,\ntheir giggles muffled as they fought their way out before he turned to Yoongi.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cCome\non, old man,\u201d he joked, holding out an arm like he was about to escort a\ndebutant to a ball, \u201clet\u2019s get you to bed.\u201d \nYoongi rolled his eyes but lifted off of the wall and let Tae maneuver\nhis forearm on top of his. \u00a0Wrapping his\nfingers around his for more stability, Tae shuffled slowly toward Yoongi\u2019s bed,\nsteering him clear of the growing pile of fabric on the floor.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoo-yoo,\u201d\nJimin said once he was free from the blankets and noticed his uncle.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHold\non,\u201d Tae warned, holding them back with his hand until Yoongi could sit down on\nthe edge of the bed. \u00a0He started to pull\nhis arm and then his hand away, but Yoongi\u2019s fingers seemed stuck to his. \u00a0Between his. \nYoongi was looking down at their joint hands, and Tae looked down, too,\nstilling himself instead of just whipping his arm away. \u00a0Even though his arm was a bit twisted and he\nhad to move to Yoongi\u2019s side instead of standing in front of him to accommodate\nthe man, Tae didn\u2019t mind. \u00a0Because he was\nseeing something in Yoongi, some side of him he hadn\u2019t before, and for the\nsecond time that day he couldn\u2019t help but look at the man. \u00a0Look at how thin his fingers were, how\npronounced his collarbones were, how pale and soft his skin was, how his mint\ngreen hair fell into his eyes and brushed against his long eyelashes.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHe was undeniably incredibly handsome, and\nTae felt his fingers twitch in his own before Yoongi withdrew his hand, letting\nit fall lamely onto his thigh as he mumbled something. \u00a0Another group of blotches appeared on his\nskin, and Tae realized the man was blushing. \nHe tried to draw his own hand back slowly, his palm still warm from\nwhere Yoongi\u2019s fingers had held on tightly, as he continued to look at the\nman. \u00a0A small person brushing past him\nfinally distracted him, though, and he took an awkward step back as Jimin and\nJungkook clung to their uncle\u2019s legs, staring up at him with frowns.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoo-yoo,\nare you okay?\u201d Jimin said.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll\nbe fine,\u201d Yoongi grimaced, forcing a smile that Tae saw right through.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cTae-tae\u2019s\ngonna stay with us, okay?\u201d Jimin continued, suddenly sounding like he was the\nadult in the room.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cJimin,\nwe can\u2019t make\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNo,\nhe said, he said. \u00a0Right, Tae-tae?\u201d Jimin\nsaid, looking up with wide, pleading eyes and a pout that rivaled the cutest\npuppies Tae had ever seen, and Tae had seen a lot of sickeningly cute puppies.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI-I\ndid offer. \u00a0I mean, if it\u2019s okay with\nyour uncle. \u00a0I-I don\u2019t want to\nintrude.\u201d \u00a0Yoongi opened his mouth as he\nfrowned up at Tae, but he seemed to decide against whatever he was going to\nsay.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIf\nyou get sick, don\u2019t blame me,\u201d Yoongi sighed, patting Jungkook\u2019s head before\nlying down on his side. \u00a0Jungkook started\nto climb up onto the mattress with him, but Tae finally stepped forward to pick\nthe boy up, swinging him around a few times before placing him on a pillow on\nthe ground.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYour\nuncle needs the bed himself tonight, okay? \nWe\u2019re going to make a bed on the floor.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cCan\nwe make a tent?\u201d Jimin suggested, leaning on the mattress still as he watched\nYoongi close his eyes.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cA\ntent?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cA\nfort.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nbet we can, as long as we\u2019re quiet so Yoongi can sleep,\u201d Tae said, tapping his\nchin as if in deep thought.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoo-yoo,\u201d\nJungkook corrected him.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\nright. \u00a0Yoo-yoo,\u201d Tae winked at the\nlittle boy who shot him a shy grin back before stuffing his face into Bun-bun\nand rolling off the pillow he was on into the pile of blankets. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m going to order food, too, for\ndinner. \u00a0Is that okay, Yoo-yoo?\u201d \u00a0He couldn\u2019t help the teasing tone in his\nvoice, but when he grinned down at Yoongi, the man didn\u2019t respond, his mouth\nalready slightly open and his breath heavy. \n</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d\nTae whispered, putting a finger to his lips to Jimin and Jungkook. \u00a0They both copied the action, and Jungkook\nseemed to find it hilarious as he broke into a peel of laughter before clamping\na hand over his mouth, his eyes wide in shock. \nSnorting, Tae reached past Yoongi to pull the covers over him. \u00a0Unable to resist, he placed his hand on the\nman\u2019s forehead one more time. \u00a0He was\nstill abnormally warm, but when he hummed and pushed his head a little forward\ninto Tae\u2019s palm, Tae couldn\u2019t help but run his fingers through his hair a few\ntimes as his breathing evened out.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cGood\nnight, Yoo-yoo,\u201d he whispered, smiling at how beautiful Yoongi looked while he\nslept. \u00a0If he didn\u2019t have to attend to\nthe children behind him, he would have loved to keep looking at Yoongi for hours,\ndetermined to see every side, every part, every frown, every smile that the man\ncould offer.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fever dreams, in a word, are\nweird. \u00a0If Yoongi didn\u2019t already know he\nwas sick, the dreams would have been a giant neon flashing sign indicating how his\nbrain was slowly being melted. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The dreams that made no sense were\nalarming. \u00a0The ones where he couldn\u2019t\nidentify anyone\u2019s face because they kept ballooning up before shrinking down,\ntheir eyes melting and mouths twisting like some Picasso painting left out in\nthe rain. \u00a0The ones that kept restarting\nlike some saved video game as he ran down a mountain away from ninjas on\nbicycles and then from bears who chased him to the top of a roof he tried to\njump off and then from what looked like ninja bears who finally made him wake\nup in a cold sweat. \u00a0The ones he couldn\u2019t\nremember but he knew felt so real they were so vivid in the middle of them that\nhe didn\u2019t know he was dreaming but ended up being black holes, leaving him with\nnothing but a sense of unease when he woke. \nThese dreams, the one a therapist might want to analyze in excruciating\ndetail, made no sense, but their tone was the same. \u00a0Despair and survival and fear pervaded\nthrough them all.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The dreams of his neighbor were\nconfusing, because Yoongi didn\u2019t often recognize the people in his dreams. \u00a0He wasn\u2019t used to his dreams recurring,\neither, but it seemed like every time he slipped into sleep, Tae was there. \u00a0He was an outside observer the first time,\nlike a hovering camera attached to a drone. \nTae was riding on, of all things, an elephant. \u00a0The figure on top of the giant animal was so\nobviously Tae. \u00a0He was too tan to be\nanyone else, and his smile, a big, boxy, goofy smile so proud like he had just\ntamed this wild beast and claimed it as his own, was so obviously Tae. \u00a0Still, the image was so bizarre that Yoongi\u2019s\nmind tried to change the channel.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next time he saw Tae, he was\nsitting in a coffee shop. \u00a0The setting\nsoothed his mind, and since he was aware he was dreaming, he allowed himself to\nsettle into this dream. \u00a0He could almost\nhear the soft jazz playing through the speakers. \u00a0He could almost hear the hiss of the espresso\nmachine and the calling of names and clacking of computer keyboards and humming\nof someone sitting next to him. \u00a0For some\nreason, it was Sunmi. \u00a0And while part of\nhis brain questioned her appearance immediately, dream Yoongi was completely at\nease. \u00a0It made sense in Yoongi\u2019s consciousness,\nhe rationalized later. \u00a0He had always\nfelt comfortable around Sunmi. \u00a0They had\nbeen friends first, and most of their communication had been in the form of\nsarcasm and teasing. \u00a0Even when they\nbroke up, it was completely amenable. \nNothing had been wrong in their relationship, but they both realized\nthey had gotten and stayed together more for comfortability than\ncompatibility. \u00a0They had sat in many a coffee\nshop almost daily when they dated, so Yoongi almost thought he was dreaming a\nmemory. \u00a0She was as gorgeous as the last\ntime he had seen her, her cheekbones high and lips painted a vibrant red, her\nfavorite shade. \u00a0She didn\u2019t look up from\nher phone or her book once, but even that didn\u2019t bother Yoongi. \u00a0It was comfortable, and it was the first pleasant\ndream he could recall having since he had gotten sick.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But then some commotion caught his\nattention, instantly shattering any pretense that this was a memory. \u00a0The shouting and yelling was almost comical,\nlike he was watching some bad drama, but the sound of a slap was what made him\nrise. \u00a0He felt see-through, though, like\nhe didn\u2019t have legs. \u00a0He couldn\u2019t see his\nown hands, even, but he was moving across the shop that soon dissolved into a\ndumpster, no, a trash pile, no, an entire dump. \nTrash looming all around him, boxes and stacks of trash, bags and stray\nitems, discarded food and broken toys, clothes with holes and books with\nmold. \u00a0He wanted to stop, to turn around,\nto run away from all of that, or stay and clean it, but he heard another smack,\nclearly someone\u2019s skin hitting another, so he stumbled over and pushed through\nthe waste in front of him until it disappeared. \n</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHis\nneighbor was sitting in the corner holding his hand to his cheek, and some\nnameless and faceless entity was standing over him, more of a black, formless\nshape than man, though its voice was rough and jeering and biting as it\nshouted, so Yoongi, who, once he got past his anger stage, couldn\u2019t imagine\never hitting anyone for any reason, rushed forward to push the man, the thing,\nout of the way, except the moment he lunged at it, it disappeared. \u00a0He stumbled over his own feet, then, and fell\nonto his knees, staring at the hands that had appeared. \u00a0He became fascinated by them because they\nweren\u2019t his hands. \u00a0They couldn\u2019t be; there\nwas no tattoo on his arms, and he had this one vein that always stuck out,\nprotruding a little, on his left hand. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThese\nhands weren\u2019t his, but he recognized them. \nHe made a fist and twisted them around, looking at the back of\nthem. \u00a0At the back of his brother\u2019s hands. \u00a0When he heard a whimper in the corner, his\neyes finally snapped up, but Tae was gone. \nJimin was huddled there instead, his puffy cheeks red and wet with tears\nas he shook, and Jungkook stood in front of him, his arms out and his feet spread\nwide as if to shield his brother from view.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Yoongi\u2014his brother? his brother\u2019s hands\u2014reached toward him, though,\nthe boy actually growled and bore his teeth, no small rabbit teeth turning into\nsharp razor fangs, the hands recoiled immediately, so quickly that Yoongi felt\nhimself stumble backwards, falling back, back, back, until he fell out of the\ndream completely and onto his bed so quickly the air got knocked out of him,\nand he sat up, gasping for breath.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi?\u201d\na deep and sleep addled voice mumbled, and Yoongi clamped his eyes shut to stop\nthe world from spinning, to stop anything from spilling out of him.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi? \u00a0Breathe, Yoongi,\u201d the voice said, and he did,\nharshly, the release so painful he felt like he had been punched. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re\nokay.\u201d \u00a0The voice had a body. \u00a0It was real, and warm, and its hand was\nrubbing Yoongi\u2019s back as he hunched over, putting his head between his knees\nand clenching his fingers around his shins. \n</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cThere\nwe go. \u00a0In and out. \u00a0Did you have a nightmare?\u201d \u00a0Nodding gently, Yoongi heard the voice sigh\nin sympathy.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDo\nyou want to tell me about it?\u201d \u00a0He\ndid. \u00a0He wanted to tell him how afraid he\nwas. \u00a0How much he felt like he was\nmessing up. \u00a0How easily and quickly dreams\ncould become reality and reality could merge into dreams. \u00a0But he shook his head, instead. \u00a0\u201cOkay, that\u2019s okay. \u00a0Do you want some water?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cJun-Junki,\u201d\nYoongi shuddered, trying to fold into himself more and more. \u00a0\u201cI dreamed you\u2014you died. \u00a0You left me, and, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\nYoongi,\u201d the voice said slowly, the hand stilling on his back. \u00a0Another shudder, and the hand started to move\naway. \u00a0\u201cOkay, let\u2019s lay you back\ndown. \u00a0Can you do that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d\nYoongi pleaded, fumbling to grab onto something and falling into the voice\u2019s\nchest. \u00a0It, he, was so warm, warm and welcoming,\nand Yoongi wanted to stay there forever. \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me again. \u00a0I-I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cO-okay,\u201d\nthe voice said uneasily. \u00a0\u201cOkay, I-I\u2019m\nhere. \u00a0Just-just lie down, again? \u00a0Here we go.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nYoongi\nlet himself be guided, led, moved because it\u2019s what he needed. \u00a0He needed just one good dream, just one\ncomforting thought. \u00a0He needed the hand\nbrushing through his hair and the arm holding him close. \u00a0He needed the chest to sob into, the warm\nskin to welcome him back even after he had been away for so long. \u00a0He needed that voice to tell him he was going\nto be alright, that they were going to be alright, that everything was going to\nbe alright.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay,\nokay,\u201d it said, which was almost good enough. \nIt almost sounded like him. \u00a0It\nwas almost too good. \u00a0It was the best fever\ndream he could remember having, and even if he knew it was a dream, the\nacknowledgement only made him calmer and more relaxed like he actually believed\neverything was going to be alright.</p><hr><p><b>A/N:</b> AH!!!</p><p>I always have to have someone sick in a bathtub in my stories, apparently.</p><p>What\u2019s up with those dreams???\u00a0 Dang.</p></p>",

Fever Dreams</b></p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Yoongi was, honestly, impressed and\nsurprised and a little bit proud of himself for making it so long before it\nhappened. \u00a0He\u2019s always been introverted,\nso to have gone from living alone and having every minute to himself if he so\nwished to suddenly never being alone even when he was just trying to go to the\nbathroom was a difficult whirlwind to adjust to. \u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nHe\nhas never been one to yell\u2014he can remember the three times he has yelled at\nsomeone in his adult life exactly as if they just happened yesterday: one, when\nhe finally resorted to raising his voice to convince his parents he was serious\nabout dropping out of school; two, when he was so, incredibly,\nwill-never-be-that-badly-drunk-again and thought he had lost his brother so he\nwent around screaming his head off in a crowded street in the middle of the\nnight like an absolute lunatic; and three, when he was so embarrassed after\nconfessing to Namjoon that he reacted by trying to get him to leave him alone,\nbut no amount of yelling would ever make Namjoon stop being his friend, so he\nhad never screamed at him again. \u00a0He had\nalways leaned toward melting down, imploding, instead of exploding, tended to\nshut down and shut people out instead of complaining and drawing attention to\nhimself.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHe\nalso was used to pressing everything down and holding everything in, keeping\neverything to himself instead of reaching out to others even if all he wanted\nwas someone to come alongside and help him. \nThat\u2019s why, every time he has ever had a bad meltdown or had gotten\nsick, it always hit him alarmingly quickly, like a freight train, like a thief\nin the night. \u00a0The lack of warning made\nit worse because that was what made him feel completely out of control,\nhelpless and vulnerable. \u00a0Weak and\npathetic.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHe\ncould hear the boys waking up. \u00a0Their\nvoices sounded muffled and distant, like they were underwater, and some\nirrational fear that they were drowning in the bathtub is what made him sit up,\nimmediately regretting his decision as he groaned and grabbed his head to keep\nthe world from turning upside down.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s\nawa\u2019e!\u201d Jungkook shouted, his continual need to be right in Yoongi\u2019s face, to\ninvade his space, extremely frustrating for some reason this morning. \u00a0With his eyes squinted shut, all of the skin\non his face feeling pulled tight and yet so loose it might be melting off his\nskull, Yoongi reached out blindly and tried to move the boy away from him as\ngently as possible. \u00a0The movement,\nhowever, caused his stomach to lurch, and with a curse, a thud, another curse,\nJimin screaming a reprimand at him, and Jungkook letting out a little breath as\nhe collided with something, Yoongi tumbled off of the bed, only prying his eyes\nopen enough to stumble into the bathroom, slamming the door behind him.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nYoongi\ncouldn\u2019t recall the last time he threw up. \nHe could remember it; he knew it was some dumb decision when he was\ntrying to pretend he didn\u2019t care about anything while really all he wanted in\nthe world was his parent\u2019s approval and his brother\u2019s love and Namjoon\u2019s\nsupport and his work to have purpose and success because he was working his ass\noff even though no one seemed to care or notice, and he knew he didn\u2019t like\ngetting that drunk again and stuck to wine or whiskey now to avoid going\noverboard, but he had forgotten how awful it was. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHow\nmuch it absolutely wracked his small frame and made tears prickle in his eyes\ninvoluntarily. \u00a0How much it stung and lingered\neven after he brushed his teeth multiple times. \nHow it made his entire body shake and break into a sweat. \u00a0How, for a split second, it always made him\nfeel like he was actually dying. \u00a0How, of\nall of the gross things he had had to deal with in the past few weeks\u2014mainly,\nurine\u2014it was by far his least favorite thing to clean up, and even though he\nneeded to wipe down the toilet and scrub the floor and brush his teeth for the\nthird time, he found himself slinking back to the ground, sweating and\nbreathing heavily, groaning as he heard the boys pounding on the door, Jimin\u2019s\nscreams louder than anything at all. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHis\narms were too weak to reach the handle, and if his throat didn\u2019t feel like he\nhad swallowed a slug covered in poison meant to burn his esophagus, he would\nhave told the boys to just come in, but he closed his eyes instead, barely registering\nhow Jimin\u2019s screams and the pounding stopped as their little feet padded away.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nTae\nisn\u2019t exactly sure why Eunnie had sent him five pictures of his neighbor at the\ndaycare taking pictures of kids with the message \u201cLook what you missed out\non.\u201d \u00a0The embarrassment had hit him first\nmixed with regret and annoyance at himself. \nHe remembered Eunnie mentioning having him come and take pictures. \u00a0He knew Jin had mentioned it at least once or\ntwice, too. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBut\nEunnie, even though she has grown annoyed with him before and vocally shared\nher frustration with Jin or straight up to him, would never gloat or make fun\nof him so blatantly. \u00a0So it took him a\nsecond to register who was in the picture. \nHer text must have meant that he missed out on seeing Yoongi, then, and\nit took him several steps of staring at his phone with a frown before he\nfigured out what she could mean.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nWith\na groan, he promised himself to stop telling everything to Jin even after the\nguy had promised he wouldn\u2019t tell anyone else. \nTae kept forgetting that that rule didn\u2019t seem to apply to his\nwife. \u00a0Something gross about being one\nflesh or \u201cshe\u2019s my everything\u201d or \u201cshe can tell when I\u2019m hiding something, so\nto protect my beautiful face I never do so.\u201d \n</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHe\nmay have, in passing, said something about Yoongi to Jin at some point. \u00a0He may have mentioned Yoongi getting jealous\nthat one day he had seen Jin at his place. \nJin may have laughed at him. \u00a0Tae\nmay have gotten fussy and grumbled about how he wasn\u2019t helping. \u00a0He may have said something about how much he\nliked his tattoos and how distracting seeing Yoongi shirtless while he hovered\nover him on his couch had been. \u00a0He may\nhave pretended to ignore the smirk and eyebrow raise Jin had given him.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nGroaning\nagain at how careless he had been, Tae kept looking at the pictures of Yoongi\nas he climbed the steps to his apartment. \nDespite how easily distracted and scatterbrained Tae was, he could\nconcentrate when he needed to. \u00a0And he\noften stared at people, not in a creepy way, except they often thought so if\nthey were strangers and noticed him doing it, but because he considered them\nwalking pieces of art, and art was meant to be admired. \u00a0He loved looking from afar and up close,\nbecause perspective can change everything. \nHe once told Jin that he never felt like he really knew a person until\nhe had seen them in a multitude of places. \nHe meant that people are different at home and at work, often, so to\ntruly know them you have to observe them in both places. \u00a0Jin had mentioned something perverted about\nhow many people Tae wanted to see in bed, too, and while Tae had not responded,\nhe wasn\u2019t exactly wrong. \u00a0To see someone\nhappy and sad, stressed and angry, tired and sick, at their best and at their\nworst, is the only way to truly know someone. \nHe complained often to Jin, each time a boyfriend or potential date left\nhim, that they never stuck around long enough to see him in all areas. \u00a0Jin had made another crude joke, but Tae knew\nhe was just trying to lighten the mood. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nLooking\nat Yoongi\u2019s pictures, Tae simply felt like he was seeing him in a different\nlight. \u00a0He had seen the man crying, had\nseen him exhausted and at his last rope, and anyone else might just assume that\nthat was all the man had to offer. \nFrowns and baggy eyes and hurried conversations because he had to get\nback to his kids. \u00a0Tae had seen the man\nas a dad, or, an uncle, a care giver. \nBut he hadn\u2019t seen him at work. \nHe hadn\u2019t seen him really smile yet, he didn\u2019t think. \u00a0A few polite grins or ones of relief, sure,\nbut each of those told a different story. \nThe Yoongi he saw on his small phone screen told him something more than\nhe had ever gleaned from seeing the man in person. \u00a0He was clearly passionate. \u00a0He concentrated and worked hard. \u00a0But he felt overwhelmed, probably by the\nkids, if Tae remembered correctly what Yoongi had said about how much he didn\u2019t\nlike to photograph people, and looked exhausted. \u00a0The exhaustion wasn\u2019t like what Tae had seen\nbefore, though, and the frown on Yoongi\u2019s face wasn\u2019t one of anger. \u00a0The man looked like he was about to fall\napart even with a camera half-hiding his face, and it was that look that Tae\ncouldn\u2019t look away from.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHe\nknew that Yoongi was older than him, but something in the man\u2019s face and body\nposture, the way he had squatted down to be at eye-level with each kid, made\nhim look much younger. \u00a0Smaller, too, but\nTae already knew the man was shorter than him. \nHe couldn\u2019t see any of his tattoos, the man\u2019s sleeves covering them up,\nbut he was imaging them. \u00a0Art on art, is\nwhat they were. \u00a0They made Yoongi look\neven more beautiful, or he made them stand out more. \u00a0Tae wasn\u2019t sure which was enhancing the other. \u00a0All he knew was Eunnie was right. \u00a0He had missed out on not only another job,\nbut also on seeing Yoongi at work, and as he scaled the top of the stairs, he\npaused by the guy\u2019s door, wondering how much his neighbor would hate him for\ndropping in unannounced. \u00a0He could always\ngo home and text him to make it look more planned, but several sounds made him\nstop and frown at the blue door before he could.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nWhile\nhe had really only heard Jungkook and Jimin crying once before, he didn\u2019t think\nhe would ever forget what their cries sounded like. \u00a0They seemed to have struck his heart deep\nenough that even the quiet sound of them dug into his flesh even more, the pain\nspreading and panic welling. \u00a0Without\nwaiting to text or give Yoongi any other sort of warning, he rose his fist to\npound on the door. \u00a0He wanted to think\nthat the guy hadn\u2019t lost it in the middle of the day. \u00a0He hoped there was more to him, more good,\nnever more bad, behind the exterior he had. \nTae hoped he hadn\u2019t misjudged him. \nHe didn\u2019t have the best track record when it came to trusting men in his\nlife, or so Jin had told him over and over again. \u00a0But Yoongi seemed different. \u00a0Or Tae wanted him to be. \u00a0Yoongi was\u2014</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi?\u201d\nTae said, pounding on the door again. \u00a0He\nheard someone crying and someone else mumbling, the sounds too low to the\nground and high-pitched to be a grown man. \n\u201cJimin? \u00a0Jungkook?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cTae-tae?\u201d\nJimin said through the door, and Tae sighed in relief, his fist leaving the\ndoor to curl around the doorknob.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\ncoming in, okay?\u201d \u00a0Not waiting for an answer,\nand really hoping Yoongi wasn\u2019t on the other side of the door ready to knife\nsomeone for breaking in, Tae pushed the door open, meeting a little resistance\nthat he realized was the cowering bodies of two small boys, both who started to\ngrab at his pants and gasp a little as they both started to rattle on. \u00a0Tae caught \u201cYoo-yoo\u201d and \u201cbathroom\u201d enough\nbetween the pair of them, their words frantic and jumbled, to know where he\nneeded to go, so making sure he closed the door and placed what he hoped was a\nsoothing hand on both of the boys\u2019 shoulders, he trotted down the short hallway\nto where the bathroom must be.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi?\u201d\nhe called before trying the door. \u00a0He\nkept one hand behind him to keep the boys back despite how much they were\ncrowding around him, afraid of what he might find. \u00a0After finding his own grandma collapsed in\nher bedroom floor when he was ten, he had been aware of how scarring the sight\nof someone you love who is in charge of taking care of you looking seemingly\ndead can be for a child. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi?\u201d\nhe said again, closing the door behind him before the boys could slip in,\nignoring how Jimin started yelling again, his and Jungkook\u2019s feet kicking at\nthe door. \u00a0Compared to Tae, Yoongi was\npale. \u00a0Tae had noticed that when he first\nbecame aware of the man. \u00a0His skin looked\nlike porcelain, and right now he looked fragile enough to break if touched, but\nTae dropped to the floor immediately, placing his hand on the man\u2019s sweaty brow\nand hissing at how warm he felt.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi?\u201d\nhe said again, his nose wrinkling at how smelly the small room was. \u00a0Trying to be gentle, he peeled up one of\nYoongi\u2019s eyelids to see his pupils wide. \nThe man groaned a bit, enough of a sign for Tae to know he was at least\nnot dead, and he felt his heart calm immediately. \u00a0Still, he looked terrible, and Tae\u2019s brain\nworked quickly, trying to remember the steps to take. \u00a0One time when Hoseok was three he had gotten\nsick at Tae\u2019s house, and he had gone so pale and clammy so quickly that Tae\nalmost called 119, but Eunnie had walked him through what to do calmly over the\nphone as she and Jin headed back early.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi?\u201d\nTae repeated, not really waiting for the man to reply, just wanting to try to\nget his attention and inform him of what he was doing so he wouldn\u2019t freak\nout. \u00a0\u201cI need to get you to the bath. \u00a0Can you stand?\u201d \u00a0Yoongi grunted, and he started to push\nhimself off of the wall and floor at the same time, which Tae knew wasn\u2019t going\nto work for long, so he took advantage of Yoongi lifting himself just enough to\nslide an arm under his knees and around his back. \u00a0Despite his small size, Yoongi definitely\nweighed more than Hoseok, and Tae tottered a bit as he stood up, thankful that\nthe wall was so close and Yoongi seemed to be pressing his hand flat against it\nas they rose. \u00a0He only had a few feet to\ngo, anyway, but he moved carefully more than quickly, noting how Yoongi mumbled\nsomething before sinking forward a little, his head ducked and causing enough\nof a shift in balance for Tae to press his own back against the wall to avoid\nfalling over. \u00a0Taking a deep breath, he\ntook the last two steps toward the tub, bending down just enough so he could\nlet his arm out from under Yoongi\u2019s legs.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cStand\nup for me, yeah? \u00a0Just for a second,\u201d Tae\nmumbled, his arm still secure around Yoongi\u2019s back as the man complied weakly. \u00a0\u201cOkay, good job. \u00a0I\u2019ve got you, just stand still for another\nsecond.\u201d \u00a0Moving carefully, one hand\nsecure on Yoongi\u2019s shoulder and his other arm reaching around to rest securing\naround his ribs, Tae stepped into the tub behind him. \u00a0Yoongi\u2019s back and chest flushed, little\nblotches of red like drops of paint breaking out all over his skin, and his\nsweat made Tae\u2019s hands slip a little, but he pressed his fingers harder into\nthe man\u2019s flesh, ignoring the way Yoongi groaned again and finally moved, his\nhand grabbing Tae\u2019s wrist. \u00a0Unsure if he\nwas just holding on or trying to push him away, Tae shushed him a little. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNeed\nyou to sit down now, okay? \u00a0Gently,\nslowly.\u201d \u00a0Pulling him close as he\nsquatted, Tae let out a breath as Yoongi sat back. \u00a0Letting him go once he was secure on his\nbottom, Tae checked his forehead again, hissing as the man curled up and put\nhis head on his knees.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay,\nthis is going to be cold, but I need you to just sit here for a second,\nokay? \u00a0I\u2019m going to check on the boys and\nget you some water. \u00a0Will you be alright\nfor a minute?\u201d Tae said, watching as Yoongi barely nodded. \u00a0\u201cOkay, okay, then just hold still for me for\na little bit.\u201d \u00a0Patting Yoongi\u2019s head\nonce, Tae pushed himself up from the side of the tub, fiddling with the handles\na little before the shower came on. \u00a0The\nfirst spray was frigid, and Yoongi let out a small cry, jerking a little.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cSorry,\nsorry. \u00a0I know,\u201d Tae mumbled, making it\nslightly warmer but still keeping it pointed toward the C. \u00a0\u201cJust a minute. \u00a0Hold on.\u201d \nNot waiting to see if Yoongi nodded or even agreed, Tae turned to go,\nstilling the moment he saw the door open, Jimin and Jungkook standing there\nquietly. \u00a0Jungkook had Bun-bun in front\nof his face, his own eyes barely peeking out past the rabbit\u2019s fur, and Jimin\nwas biting his bottom lip, his cheeks and eyes red.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cTae-tae,\u201d\nthe boy said, his lip wobbling the moment he let go of it, \u201cis Yoo-yoo dying?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nTae balked before recovering himself. \n\u201cNo, no. \u00a0Don\u2019t worry. \u00a0He\u2019s just sick.\u201d \u00a0Ushering the boys out, though they both\nseemed reluctant to go, Tae hurried them into the living room. \u00a0\u201cJimin, can you get me a cup? \u00a0Jungkook, we need some clothes for your\nuncle. \u00a0Do you know where those are?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cJung\u2019oo\u2019\n\u2018an help,\u201d Jungkook nodded, his words mostly muffled by his bunny\u2019s fabric as\nhe headed toward the only dresser in the room. \nFollowing him, Tae pulled out what he needed before patting Jungkook\u2019s\nhead in thanks.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWill\nthis do?\u201d Jimin said from the kitchen, emerging from one of the cabinets brandishing\na plastic cup as if it was the Holy Grail.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d\nTae said honestly, smiling at the boy as he took it. \u00a0Filling it up quickly with water, he started\nto carry the items back to the bathroom. \nPausing immediately, however, he turned back to the boys who stopped\nshort, almost bumping into him they were following him so closely.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cBoys,\nyour uncle is sick, and you need to sleep somewhere else tonight.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cCan\nwe stay at yours?\u201d Jimin said hesitantly, but Tae shook his head.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWe\ncan\u2019t leave your uncle alone, can we? \u00a0So\nwe need to make a bed on the floor. \u00a0Do\nyou know where the extra blankets are?\u201d \nJimin nodded, looking across the room at a closet.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\ndon\u2019t know if I can reach,\u201d he mumbled, sounding infinitely displeased with\nhimself.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay,\nokay, don\u2019t hurt yourself. \u00a0But if you\ncan, get them out for us, okay? \u00a0Just\ngive us a minute in the bathroom, alright?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cBathroom\nis pri-bit,\u201d Jungkook nodded into Bun-bun\u2019s back again. \u00a0Unable to keep a small, endearing smile from\nhis face, Tae nodded back before rushing to the bathroom. \u00a0Closing the door again behind him, he closed\nthe toilet seat and put Yoongi\u2019s clothes on it, crouching down by the tub to\nturn the water off. \u00a0By now, Yoongi was\nshaking, his teeth audibly chattering, and the sight made Tae curse under his\nbreath.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cSorry,\nsorry,\u201d he hissed, lifting Yoongi\u2019s head up and pushing his hair out of the\nway. \u00a0His forehead still felt plenty\nwarm, and he put his hand on the back of Yoongi\u2019s neck where his skin was still\nwet to lift the cup to his lips. \u00a0\u201cOpen,\nplease. \u00a0I need you to drink this.\u201d \u00a0Yoongi grunted at him, drops of water falling\nfrom his hair onto his nose and cheeks, but his lips stayed stubbornly pressed\ntogether.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi,\nit\u2019s water. \u00a0Just a sip or two, yeah?\u201d \u00a0The man seemed to think for a second, so Tae\npressed the cup to his lips before removing it. \nThe third time the plastic touched Yoongi\u2019s bottom lip, the man finally\nsighed and open his mouth enough for Tae to tilt some water in. \u00a0Only letting a sip in, he sat it down on the\nedge of the tub out of the way once they were done.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cGood\njob,\u201d he said softly, watching the way Yoongi\u2019s face scrunched up. \u00a0Licking his lips a few times, Yoongi turned\nhis head enough that Tae let go of him to stare back as Yoongi finally opened\nhis eyes. \u00a0Something in them was akin to the\nlook Tae had seen when he found him outside when he had abandoned the boys\ninside, and Tae tried not to frown at how much he hated that look on the man\u2019s\nface, especially since he thought he knew what it was now.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d\nhe said, \u201cthe boys are fine. \u00a0And you\u2019re\ngoing to be. \u00a0We need to get you up and\nchanged and back to bed, though, okay?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d\nYoongi frowned, his voice hoarse and rough. \nCocking his head, Tae frowned back.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWell,\nI\u2019m going to help you out, and then we\u2019ll dry you off, and I brought fresh\nclothes, then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNo,\nhow?\u201d Yoongi asked again, resting his cheek on his knee and sighing again as he\nshuddered. \u00a0Purely instinctually, Tae put\na hand on his back, trying to calm him down.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nheard the boys crying. \u00a0You-you should\nreally lock your door, you know?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d\nYoongi said, closing his eyes and taking a few deep breaths. \u00a0Giving him a moment, Tae took the opportunity\nto look at the band tattoo on Yoongi\u2019s right bicep. \u00a0From afar, he had thought it was just simply\nblack lines, but up close he realized there were tiny numbers sideways\nalongside the different lines.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\na camera lens,\u201d he mused out loud, his comment making Yoongi\u2019s eyes open again.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYour\ntattoo,\u201d Tae said, moving his hand to run his finger along the band. \u00a0Following his movement, Yoongi\u2019s eyes\nnarrowed a bit before he shivered again, spurring Tae into action. \u00a0\u201cOkay, time to get out. \u00a0Can you stand?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll\ntry,\u201d Yoongi sighed, but Tae still put his hand on his back and held out his\nother one for Yoongi to take. \u00a0The tub\nthankfully had an anti-slip mat in it, so Yoongi was able to get his footing a\nlittle before standing up, Tae standing with him to help him. \u00a0Moving to take both of his hands, Tae stepped\nback a bit as Yoongi lifted one foot and then the other. \u00a0The man let out a gruff laugh which made Tae\nraise his eyebrows at him once he was out of the bathtub.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cFeel\nlike an old man,\u201d Yoongi mumbled.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\nare pretty old. \u00a0Put your hands on the\ncounter,\u201d Tae instructed him, not waiting for any comeback or denial. \u00a0Moving around behind him, Tae put his hands\non Yoongi\u2019s still wet hips as he did so the man knew where he was, only letting\ngo of him to open the cabinet above the toilet to pull a towel out. \u00a0He attributed the shudder that he felt run\nthrough Yoongi\u2019s body when his hands brushed against him to the cold, so he\nhurried to wrap the towel around the man\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cCan\nyou get dressed, or do you want my help?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201c\u2019m\nnot a child,\u201d Yoongi grumbled, and Tae ducked his head behind the man\u2019s back so\nhe couldn\u2019t see him smiling at him in the mirror. \u00a0He must be feeling a little better if he was\nbeing stubborn.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nknow that, but that\u2019s not what I was asking, so don\u2019t speak like a child and\ntell me if you want my help or not,\u201d Tae said. \nWhen Yoongi didn\u2019t respond, he lifted his head curiously to look at the\nman\u2019s face in the mirror. \u00a0His brow was a\nlittle furrowed, and he looked very confused. \nCocking his head again, Tae raised his eyebrows inquisitively. \u00a0Pulling the towel around him, Yoongi shook\nhis head a little and clamped his mouth shut, avoiding Tae\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d\nTae said slowly, stepping away from Yoongi even though he kept an eye on him as\nhe did so, noticing the way his shoulders were slumped. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m going to go check on the boys,\nthen. \u00a0If I hear any alarming noises, I\u2019m\ngoing to come back even if your pants aren\u2019t on or something. \u00a0So hurry up. \nBut go slowly. \u00a0Don\u2019t bend down if\nyou\u2019re really dizzy. \u00a0Are you dizzy?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNo,\nTae, I\u2019m okay,\u201d Yoongi muttered even though Tae knew he wasn\u2019t. \u00a0Humming, unconvinced, Tae patted his shoulder\non top of the towel a couple of times before heading out, his ears perked for\nany sounds of distress. \u00a0He didn\u2019t close\nthe door all the way, either, but left it a little ajar as he hurried back to\nthe living room.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe\nboys had not been idle, though Jimin had been right. \u00a0They couldn\u2019t quite reach the blankets in\nYoongi\u2019s closet, but they had been constructing a way to get to them with the\nboxes they found.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\nwhoa, hold on, no, nope, wait,\u201d Tae almost squeaked, rushing with his hands out\neven as Jimin was climbing up on a flimsy looking cardboard box. \u00a0Frowning fiercely at him, Jimin huffed but\nclimbed down, looking utterly defeated again.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\ntold you I can\u2019t reach them,\u201d he said as if it was all Tae\u2019s fault he was only\nfour and so short.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\nokay, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Tae reassured him, reaching easily up and grabbing a bundle\nof blankets from the top shelf. \u00a0\u201cWe can\nstart with this, and I\u2019ll run and grab some more from my place. \u00a0Can you two set these up on the floor while I\ngo do that really quick?\u201d \u00a0Nodding\nenthusiastically, Jimin and Jungkook took the blankets from him, both of them a\nlittle overburdened; while not heavy, the blankets were large, and they walked\na little like pregnant ladies toward the bed, only stopping when they bumped into\nit. \u00a0Chuckling quietly, Tae half-jogged\nout the door and to his place. \u00a0He was\nstruck by how messy his apartment was in comparison to Yoongi\u2019s, but he only\ntook the time to grab his phone charger and tooth brush along with a stray\nblanket and as many pillows as he could hold. \nJin once told him he had a pillow problem, but Tae only thought he had a\npillow paradise.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe\ndoor still wasn\u2019t locked when he got back, but Yoongi had appeared from the\nbathroom. \u00a0He was leaned on the wall in\nthe hallway, looking winded and still sickly pale, but there was a small smile\non his face. \u00a0It slipped when his eyes left\nthe boys and landed on Tae, but Tae didn\u2019t take it personally. \u00a0He knew, by this point, that he was\nmeddling. \u00a0Yoongi could rightfully tell him\nto fuck off anytime, and he would go. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThough\nhe was used to other people leaving before he did, he knew he should respect\nYoongi\u2019s boundaries. \u00a0It\u2019s why he dropped\nthe blankets and pillows he was carrying on top of Jimin and Jungkook\u2019s heads,\ntheir giggles muffled as they fought their way out before he turned to Yoongi.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cCome\non, old man,\u201d he joked, holding out an arm like he was about to escort a\ndebutant to a ball, \u201clet\u2019s get you to bed.\u201d \nYoongi rolled his eyes but lifted off of the wall and let Tae maneuver\nhis forearm on top of his. \u00a0Wrapping his\nfingers around his for more stability, Tae shuffled slowly toward Yoongi\u2019s bed,\nsteering him clear of the growing pile of fabric on the floor.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoo-yoo,\u201d\nJimin said once he was free from the blankets and noticed his uncle.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHold\non,\u201d Tae warned, holding them back with his hand until Yoongi could sit down on\nthe edge of the bed. \u00a0He started to pull\nhis arm and then his hand away, but Yoongi\u2019s fingers seemed stuck to his. \u00a0Between his. \nYoongi was looking down at their joint hands, and Tae looked down, too,\nstilling himself instead of just whipping his arm away. \u00a0Even though his arm was a bit twisted and he\nhad to move to Yoongi\u2019s side instead of standing in front of him to accommodate\nthe man, Tae didn\u2019t mind. \u00a0Because he was\nseeing something in Yoongi, some side of him he hadn\u2019t before, and for the\nsecond time that day he couldn\u2019t help but look at the man. \u00a0Look at how thin his fingers were, how\npronounced his collarbones were, how pale and soft his skin was, how his mint\ngreen hair fell into his eyes and brushed against his long eyelashes.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHe was undeniably incredibly handsome, and\nTae felt his fingers twitch in his own before Yoongi withdrew his hand, letting\nit fall lamely onto his thigh as he mumbled something. \u00a0Another group of blotches appeared on his\nskin, and Tae realized the man was blushing. \nHe tried to draw his own hand back slowly, his palm still warm from\nwhere Yoongi\u2019s fingers had held on tightly, as he continued to look at the\nman. \u00a0A small person brushing past him\nfinally distracted him, though, and he took an awkward step back as Jimin and\nJungkook clung to their uncle\u2019s legs, staring up at him with frowns.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoo-yoo,\nare you okay?\u201d Jimin said.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll\nbe fine,\u201d Yoongi grimaced, forcing a smile that Tae saw right through.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cTae-tae\u2019s\ngonna stay with us, okay?\u201d Jimin continued, suddenly sounding like he was the\nadult in the room.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cJimin,\nwe can\u2019t make\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNo,\nhe said, he said. \u00a0Right, Tae-tae?\u201d Jimin\nsaid, looking up with wide, pleading eyes and a pout that rivaled the cutest\npuppies Tae had ever seen, and Tae had seen a lot of sickeningly cute puppies.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI-I\ndid offer. \u00a0I mean, if it\u2019s okay with\nyour uncle. \u00a0I-I don\u2019t want to\nintrude.\u201d \u00a0Yoongi opened his mouth as he\nfrowned up at Tae, but he seemed to decide against whatever he was going to\nsay.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIf\nyou get sick, don\u2019t blame me,\u201d Yoongi sighed, patting Jungkook\u2019s head before\nlying down on his side. \u00a0Jungkook started\nto climb up onto the mattress with him, but Tae finally stepped forward to pick\nthe boy up, swinging him around a few times before placing him on a pillow on\nthe ground.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYour\nuncle needs the bed himself tonight, okay? \nWe\u2019re going to make a bed on the floor.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cCan\nwe make a tent?\u201d Jimin suggested, leaning on the mattress still as he watched\nYoongi close his eyes.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cA\ntent?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cA\nfort.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nbet we can, as long as we\u2019re quiet so Yoongi can sleep,\u201d Tae said, tapping his\nchin as if in deep thought.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoo-yoo,\u201d\nJungkook corrected him.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\nright. \u00a0Yoo-yoo,\u201d Tae winked at the\nlittle boy who shot him a shy grin back before stuffing his face into Bun-bun\nand rolling off the pillow he was on into the pile of blankets. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m going to order food, too, for\ndinner. \u00a0Is that okay, Yoo-yoo?\u201d \u00a0He couldn\u2019t help the teasing tone in his\nvoice, but when he grinned down at Yoongi, the man didn\u2019t respond, his mouth\nalready slightly open and his breath heavy. \n</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d\nTae whispered, putting a finger to his lips to Jimin and Jungkook. \u00a0They both copied the action, and Jungkook\nseemed to find it hilarious as he broke into a peel of laughter before clamping\na hand over his mouth, his eyes wide in shock. \nSnorting, Tae reached past Yoongi to pull the covers over him. \u00a0Unable to resist, he placed his hand on the\nman\u2019s forehead one more time. \u00a0He was\nstill abnormally warm, but when he hummed and pushed his head a little forward\ninto Tae\u2019s palm, Tae couldn\u2019t help but run his fingers through his hair a few\ntimes as his breathing evened out.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cGood\nnight, Yoo-yoo,\u201d he whispered, smiling at how beautiful Yoongi looked while he\nslept. \u00a0If he didn\u2019t have to attend to\nthe children behind him, he would have loved to keep looking at Yoongi for hours,\ndetermined to see every side, every part, every frown, every smile that the man\ncould offer.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fever dreams, in a word, are\nweird. \u00a0If Yoongi didn\u2019t already know he\nwas sick, the dreams would have been a giant neon flashing sign indicating how his\nbrain was slowly being melted. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The dreams that made no sense were\nalarming. \u00a0The ones where he couldn\u2019t\nidentify anyone\u2019s face because they kept ballooning up before shrinking down,\ntheir eyes melting and mouths twisting like some Picasso painting left out in\nthe rain. \u00a0The ones that kept restarting\nlike some saved video game as he ran down a mountain away from ninjas on\nbicycles and then from bears who chased him to the top of a roof he tried to\njump off and then from what looked like ninja bears who finally made him wake\nup in a cold sweat. \u00a0The ones he couldn\u2019t\nremember but he knew felt so real they were so vivid in the middle of them that\nhe didn\u2019t know he was dreaming but ended up being black holes, leaving him with\nnothing but a sense of unease when he woke. \nThese dreams, the one a therapist might want to analyze in excruciating\ndetail, made no sense, but their tone was the same. \u00a0Despair and survival and fear pervaded\nthrough them all.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The dreams of his neighbor were\nconfusing, because Yoongi didn\u2019t often recognize the people in his dreams. \u00a0He wasn\u2019t used to his dreams recurring,\neither, but it seemed like every time he slipped into sleep, Tae was there. \u00a0He was an outside observer the first time,\nlike a hovering camera attached to a drone. \nTae was riding on, of all things, an elephant. \u00a0The figure on top of the giant animal was so\nobviously Tae. \u00a0He was too tan to be\nanyone else, and his smile, a big, boxy, goofy smile so proud like he had just\ntamed this wild beast and claimed it as his own, was so obviously Tae. \u00a0Still, the image was so bizarre that Yoongi\u2019s\nmind tried to change the channel.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next time he saw Tae, he was\nsitting in a coffee shop. \u00a0The setting\nsoothed his mind, and since he was aware he was dreaming, he allowed himself to\nsettle into this dream. \u00a0He could almost\nhear the soft jazz playing through the speakers. \u00a0He could almost hear the hiss of the espresso\nmachine and the calling of names and clacking of computer keyboards and humming\nof someone sitting next to him. \u00a0For some\nreason, it was Sunmi. \u00a0And while part of\nhis brain questioned her appearance immediately, dream Yoongi was completely at\nease. \u00a0It made sense in Yoongi\u2019s consciousness,\nhe rationalized later. \u00a0He had always\nfelt comfortable around Sunmi. \u00a0They had\nbeen friends first, and most of their communication had been in the form of\nsarcasm and teasing. \u00a0Even when they\nbroke up, it was completely amenable. \nNothing had been wrong in their relationship, but they both realized\nthey had gotten and stayed together more for comfortability than\ncompatibility. \u00a0They had sat in many a coffee\nshop almost daily when they dated, so Yoongi almost thought he was dreaming a\nmemory. \u00a0She was as gorgeous as the last\ntime he had seen her, her cheekbones high and lips painted a vibrant red, her\nfavorite shade. \u00a0She didn\u2019t look up from\nher phone or her book once, but even that didn\u2019t bother Yoongi. \u00a0It was comfortable, and it was the first pleasant\ndream he could recall having since he had gotten sick.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But then some commotion caught his\nattention, instantly shattering any pretense that this was a memory. \u00a0The shouting and yelling was almost comical,\nlike he was watching some bad drama, but the sound of a slap was what made him\nrise. \u00a0He felt see-through, though, like\nhe didn\u2019t have legs. \u00a0He couldn\u2019t see his\nown hands, even, but he was moving across the shop that soon dissolved into a\ndumpster, no, a trash pile, no, an entire dump. \nTrash looming all around him, boxes and stacks of trash, bags and stray\nitems, discarded food and broken toys, clothes with holes and books with\nmold. \u00a0He wanted to stop, to turn around,\nto run away from all of that, or stay and clean it, but he heard another smack,\nclearly someone\u2019s skin hitting another, so he stumbled over and pushed through\nthe waste in front of him until it disappeared. \n</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHis\nneighbor was sitting in the corner holding his hand to his cheek, and some\nnameless and faceless entity was standing over him, more of a black, formless\nshape than man, though its voice was rough and jeering and biting as it\nshouted, so Yoongi, who, once he got past his anger stage, couldn\u2019t imagine\never hitting anyone for any reason, rushed forward to push the man, the thing,\nout of the way, except the moment he lunged at it, it disappeared. \u00a0He stumbled over his own feet, then, and fell\nonto his knees, staring at the hands that had appeared. \u00a0He became fascinated by them because they\nweren\u2019t his hands. \u00a0They couldn\u2019t be; there\nwas no tattoo on his arms, and he had this one vein that always stuck out,\nprotruding a little, on his left hand. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThese\nhands weren\u2019t his, but he recognized them. \nHe made a fist and twisted them around, looking at the back of\nthem. \u00a0At the back of his brother\u2019s hands. \u00a0When he heard a whimper in the corner, his\neyes finally snapped up, but Tae was gone. \nJimin was huddled there instead, his puffy cheeks red and wet with tears\nas he shook, and Jungkook stood in front of him, his arms out and his feet spread\nwide as if to shield his brother from view.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Yoongi\u2014his brother? his brother\u2019s hands\u2014reached toward him, though,\nthe boy actually growled and bore his teeth, no small rabbit teeth turning into\nsharp razor fangs, the hands recoiled immediately, so quickly that Yoongi felt\nhimself stumble backwards, falling back, back, back, until he fell out of the\ndream completely and onto his bed so quickly the air got knocked out of him,\nand he sat up, gasping for breath.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi?\u201d\na deep and sleep addled voice mumbled, and Yoongi clamped his eyes shut to stop\nthe world from spinning, to stop anything from spilling out of him.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi? \u00a0Breathe, Yoongi,\u201d the voice said, and he did,\nharshly, the release so painful he felt like he had been punched. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re\nokay.\u201d \u00a0The voice had a body. \u00a0It was real, and warm, and its hand was\nrubbing Yoongi\u2019s back as he hunched over, putting his head between his knees\nand clenching his fingers around his shins. \n</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cThere\nwe go. \u00a0In and out. \u00a0Did you have a nightmare?\u201d \u00a0Nodding gently, Yoongi heard the voice sigh\nin sympathy.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDo\nyou want to tell me about it?\u201d \u00a0He\ndid. \u00a0He wanted to tell him how afraid he\nwas. \u00a0How much he felt like he was\nmessing up. \u00a0How easily and quickly dreams\ncould become reality and reality could merge into dreams. \u00a0But he shook his head, instead. \u00a0\u201cOkay, that\u2019s okay. \u00a0Do you want some water?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cJun-Junki,\u201d\nYoongi shuddered, trying to fold into himself more and more. \u00a0\u201cI dreamed you\u2014you died. \u00a0You left me, and, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\nYoongi,\u201d the voice said slowly, the hand stilling on his back. \u00a0Another shudder, and the hand started to move\naway. \u00a0\u201cOkay, let\u2019s lay you back\ndown. \u00a0Can you do that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d\nYoongi pleaded, fumbling to grab onto something and falling into the voice\u2019s\nchest. \u00a0It, he, was so warm, warm and welcoming,\nand Yoongi wanted to stay there forever. \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me again. \u00a0I-I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cO-okay,\u201d\nthe voice said uneasily. \u00a0\u201cOkay, I-I\u2019m\nhere. \u00a0Just-just lie down, again? \u00a0Here we go.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nYoongi\nlet himself be guided, led, moved because it\u2019s what he needed. \u00a0He needed just one good dream, just one\ncomforting thought. \u00a0He needed the hand\nbrushing through his hair and the arm holding him close. \u00a0He needed the chest to sob into, the warm\nskin to welcome him back even after he had been away for so long. \u00a0He needed that voice to tell him he was going\nto be alright, that they were going to be alright, that everything was going to\nbe alright.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay,\nokay,\u201d it said, which was almost good enough. \nIt almost sounded like him. \u00a0It\nwas almost too good. \u00a0It was the best fever\ndream he could remember having, and even if he knew it was a dream, the\nacknowledgement only made him calmer and more relaxed like he actually believed\neverything was going to be alright.</p><hr><p><b>A/N:</b> AH!!!</p><p>I always have to have someone sick in a bathtub in my stories, apparently.</p><p>What\u2019s up with those dreams???\u00a0 Dang.</p></p>",

Hoseok and Jimin &ldquo;Made Out&rdquo;</a></b></p><p><b>14. Fever Dreams</b></p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yoongi was, honestly, impressed and\nsurprised and a little bit proud of himself for making it so long before it\nhappened. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s always been introverted,\nso to have gone from living alone and having every minute to himself if he so\nwished to suddenly never being alone even when he was just trying to go to the\nbathroom was a difficult whirlwind to adjust to. &nbsp;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n\nHe\nhas never been one to yell&mdash;he can remember the three times he has yelled at\nsomeone in his adult life exactly as if they just happened yesterday: one, when\nhe finally resorted to raising his voice to convince his parents he was serious\nabout dropping out of school; two, when he was so, incredibly,\nwill-never-be-that-badly-drunk-again and thought he had lost his brother so he\nwent around screaming his head off in a crowded street in the middle of the\nnight like an absolute lunatic; and three, when he was so embarrassed after\nconfessing to Namjoon that he reacted by trying to get him to leave him alone,\nbut no amount of yelling would ever make Namjoon stop being his friend, so he\nhad never screamed at him again. &nbsp;He had\nalways leaned toward melting down, imploding, instead of exploding, tended to\nshut down and shut people out instead of complaining and drawing attention to\nhimself.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nHe\nalso was used to pressing everything down and holding everything in, keeping\neverything to himself instead of reaching out to others even if all he wanted\nwas someone to come alongside and help him. \nThat&rsquo;s why, every time he has ever had a bad meltdown or had gotten\nsick, it always hit him alarmingly quickly, like a freight train, like a thief\nin the night. &nbsp;The lack of warning made\nit worse because that was what made him feel completely out of control,\nhelpless and vulnerable. &nbsp;Weak and\npathetic.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nHe\ncould hear the boys waking up. &nbsp;Their\nvoices sounded muffled and distant, like they were underwater, and some\nirrational fear that they were drowning in the bathtub is what made him sit up,\nimmediately regretting his decision as he groaned and grabbed his head to keep\nthe world from turning upside down.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;He&rsquo;s\nawa&rsquo;e!&rdquo; Jungkook shouted, his continual need to be right in Yoongi&rsquo;s face, to\ninvade his space, extremely frustrating for some reason this morning. &nbsp;With his eyes squinted shut, all of the skin\non his face feeling pulled tight and yet so loose it might be melting off his\nskull, Yoongi reached out blindly and tried to move the boy away from him as\ngently as possible. &nbsp;The movement,\nhowever, caused his stomach to lurch, and with a curse, a thud, another curse,\nJimin screaming a reprimand at him, and Jungkook letting out a little breath as\nhe collided with something, Yoongi tumbled off of the bed, only prying his eyes\nopen enough to stumble into the bathroom, slamming the door behind him.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nYoongi\ncouldn&rsquo;t recall the last time he threw up. \nHe could remember it; he knew it was some dumb decision when he was\ntrying to pretend he didn&rsquo;t care about anything while really all he wanted in\nthe world was his parent&rsquo;s approval and his brother&rsquo;s love and Namjoon&rsquo;s\nsupport and his work to have purpose and success because he was working his ass\noff even though no one seemed to care or notice, and he knew he didn&rsquo;t like\ngetting that drunk again and stuck to wine or whiskey now to avoid going\noverboard, but he had forgotten how awful it was. &nbsp;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nHow\nmuch it absolutely wracked his small frame and made tears prickle in his eyes\ninvoluntarily. &nbsp;How much it stung and lingered\neven after he brushed his teeth multiple times. \nHow it made his entire body shake and break into a sweat. &nbsp;How, for a split second, it always made him\nfeel like he was actually dying. &nbsp;How, of\nall of the gross things he had had to deal with in the past few weeks&mdash;mainly,\nurine&mdash;it was by far his least favorite thing to clean up, and even though he\nneeded to wipe down the toilet and scrub the floor and brush his teeth for the\nthird time, he found himself slinking back to the ground, sweating and\nbreathing heavily, groaning as he heard the boys pounding on the door, Jimin&rsquo;s\nscreams louder than anything at all. &nbsp;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nHis\narms were too weak to reach the handle, and if his throat didn&rsquo;t feel like he\nhad swallowed a slug covered in poison meant to burn his esophagus, he would\nhave told the boys to just come in, but he closed his eyes instead, barely registering\nhow Jimin&rsquo;s screams and the pounding stopped as their little feet padded away.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nTae\nisn&rsquo;t exactly sure why Eunnie had sent him five pictures of his neighbor at the\ndaycare taking pictures of kids with the message &ldquo;Look what you missed out\non.&rdquo; &nbsp;The embarrassment had hit him first\nmixed with regret and annoyance at himself. \nHe remembered Eunnie mentioning having him come and take pictures. &nbsp;He knew Jin had mentioned it at least once or\ntwice, too. &nbsp;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nBut\nEunnie, even though she has grown annoyed with him before and vocally shared\nher frustration with Jin or straight up to him, would never gloat or make fun\nof him so blatantly. &nbsp;So it took him a\nsecond to register who was in the picture. \nHer text must have meant that he missed out on seeing Yoongi, then, and\nit took him several steps of staring at his phone with a frown before he\nfigured out what she could mean.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nWith\na groan, he promised himself to stop telling everything to Jin even after the\nguy had promised he wouldn&rsquo;t tell anyone else. \nTae kept forgetting that that rule didn&rsquo;t seem to apply to his\nwife. &nbsp;Something gross about being one\nflesh or &ldquo;she&rsquo;s my everything&rdquo; or &ldquo;she can tell when I&rsquo;m hiding something, so\nto protect my beautiful face I never do so.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nHe\nmay have, in passing, said something about Yoongi to Jin at some point. &nbsp;He may have mentioned Yoongi getting jealous\nthat one day he had seen Jin at his place. \nJin may have laughed at him. &nbsp;Tae\nmay have gotten fussy and grumbled about how he wasn&rsquo;t helping. &nbsp;He may have said something about how much he\nliked his tattoos and how distracting seeing Yoongi shirtless while he hovered\nover him on his couch had been. &nbsp;He may\nhave pretended to ignore the smirk and eyebrow raise Jin had given him.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nGroaning\nagain at how careless he had been, Tae kept looking at the pictures of Yoongi\nas he climbed the steps to his apartment. \nDespite how easily distracted and scatterbrained Tae was, he could\nconcentrate when he needed to. &nbsp;And he\noften stared at people, not in a creepy way, except they often thought so if\nthey were strangers and noticed him doing it, but because he considered them\nwalking pieces of art, and art was meant to be admired. &nbsp;He loved looking from afar and up close,\nbecause perspective can change everything. \nHe once told Jin that he never felt like he really knew a person until\nhe had seen them in a multitude of places. \nHe meant that people are different at home and at work, often, so to\ntruly know them you have to observe them in both places. &nbsp;Jin had mentioned something perverted about\nhow many people Tae wanted to see in bed, too, and while Tae had not responded,\nhe wasn&rsquo;t exactly wrong. &nbsp;To see someone\nhappy and sad, stressed and angry, tired and sick, at their best and at their\nworst, is the only way to truly know someone. \nHe complained often to Jin, each time a boyfriend or potential date left\nhim, that they never stuck around long enough to see him in all areas. &nbsp;Jin had made another crude joke, but Tae knew\nhe was just trying to lighten the mood. &nbsp;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nLooking\nat Yoongi&rsquo;s pictures, Tae simply felt like he was seeing him in a different\nlight. &nbsp;He had seen the man crying, had\nseen him exhausted and at his last rope, and anyone else might just assume that\nthat was all the man had to offer. \nFrowns and baggy eyes and hurried conversations because he had to get\nback to his kids. &nbsp;Tae had seen the man\nas a dad, or, an uncle, a care giver. \nBut he hadn&rsquo;t seen him at work. \nHe hadn&rsquo;t seen him really smile yet, he didn&rsquo;t think. &nbsp;A few polite grins or ones of relief, sure,\nbut each of those told a different story. \nThe Yoongi he saw on his small phone screen told him something more than\nhe had ever gleaned from seeing the man in person. &nbsp;He was clearly passionate. &nbsp;He concentrated and worked hard. &nbsp;But he felt overwhelmed, probably by the\nkids, if Tae remembered correctly what Yoongi had said about how much he didn&rsquo;t\nlike to photograph people, and looked exhausted. &nbsp;The exhaustion wasn&rsquo;t like what Tae had seen\nbefore, though, and the frown on Yoongi&rsquo;s face wasn&rsquo;t one of anger. &nbsp;The man looked like he was about to fall\napart even with a camera half-hiding his face, and it was that look that Tae\ncouldn&rsquo;t look away from.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nHe\nknew that Yoongi was older than him, but something in the man&rsquo;s face and body\nposture, the way he had squatted down to be at eye-level with each kid, made\nhim look much younger. &nbsp;Smaller, too, but\nTae already knew the man was shorter than him. \nHe couldn&rsquo;t see any of his tattoos, the man&rsquo;s sleeves covering them up,\nbut he was imaging them. &nbsp;Art on art, is\nwhat they were. &nbsp;They made Yoongi look\neven more beautiful, or he made them stand out more. &nbsp;Tae wasn&rsquo;t sure which was enhancing the other. &nbsp;All he knew was Eunnie was right. &nbsp;He had missed out on not only another job,\nbut also on seeing Yoongi at work, and as he scaled the top of the stairs, he\npaused by the guy&rsquo;s door, wondering how much his neighbor would hate him for\ndropping in unannounced. &nbsp;He could always\ngo home and text him to make it look more planned, but several sounds made him\nstop and frown at the blue door before he could.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nWhile\nhe had really only heard Jungkook and Jimin crying once before, he didn&rsquo;t think\nhe would ever forget what their cries sounded like. &nbsp;They seemed to have struck his heart deep\nenough that even the quiet sound of them dug into his flesh even more, the pain\nspreading and panic welling. &nbsp;Without\nwaiting to text or give Yoongi any other sort of warning, he rose his fist to\npound on the door. &nbsp;He wanted to think\nthat the guy hadn&rsquo;t lost it in the middle of the day. &nbsp;He hoped there was more to him, more good,\nnever more bad, behind the exterior he had. \nTae hoped he hadn&rsquo;t misjudged him. \nHe didn&rsquo;t have the best track record when it came to trusting men in his\nlife, or so Jin had told him over and over again. &nbsp;But Yoongi seemed different. &nbsp;Or Tae wanted him to be. &nbsp;Yoongi was&mdash;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yoongi?&rdquo;\nTae said, pounding on the door again. &nbsp;He\nheard someone crying and someone else mumbling, the sounds too low to the\nground and high-pitched to be a grown man. \n&ldquo;Jimin? &nbsp;Jungkook?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Tae-tae?&rdquo;\nJimin said through the door, and Tae sighed in relief, his fist leaving the\ndoor to curl around the doorknob.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\ncoming in, okay?&rdquo; &nbsp;Not waiting for an answer,\nand really hoping Yoongi wasn&rsquo;t on the other side of the door ready to knife\nsomeone for breaking in, Tae pushed the door open, meeting a little resistance\nthat he realized was the cowering bodies of two small boys, both who started to\ngrab at his pants and gasp a little as they both started to rattle on. &nbsp;Tae caught &ldquo;Yoo-yoo&rdquo; and &ldquo;bathroom&rdquo; enough\nbetween the pair of them, their words frantic and jumbled, to know where he\nneeded to go, so making sure he closed the door and placed what he hoped was a\nsoothing hand on both of the boys&rsquo; shoulders, he trotted down the short hallway\nto where the bathroom must be.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yoongi?&rdquo;\nhe called before trying the door. &nbsp;He\nkept one hand behind him to keep the boys back despite how much they were\ncrowding around him, afraid of what he might find. &nbsp;After finding his own grandma collapsed in\nher bedroom floor when he was ten, he had been aware of how scarring the sight\nof someone you love who is in charge of taking care of you looking seemingly\ndead can be for a child. &nbsp;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yoongi?&rdquo;\nhe said again, closing the door behind him before the boys could slip in,\nignoring how Jimin started yelling again, his and Jungkook&rsquo;s feet kicking at\nthe door. &nbsp;Compared to Tae, Yoongi was\npale. &nbsp;Tae had noticed that when he first\nbecame aware of the man. &nbsp;His skin looked\nlike porcelain, and right now he looked fragile enough to break if touched, but\nTae dropped to the floor immediately, placing his hand on the man&rsquo;s sweaty brow\nand hissing at how warm he felt.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yoongi?&rdquo;\nhe said again, his nose wrinkling at how smelly the small room was. &nbsp;Trying to be gentle, he peeled up one of\nYoongi&rsquo;s eyelids to see his pupils wide. \nThe man groaned a bit, enough of a sign for Tae to know he was at least\nnot dead, and he felt his heart calm immediately. &nbsp;Still, he looked terrible, and Tae&rsquo;s brain\nworked quickly, trying to remember the steps to take. &nbsp;One time when Hoseok was three he had gotten\nsick at Tae&rsquo;s house, and he had gone so pale and clammy so quickly that Tae\nalmost called 119, but Eunnie had walked him through what to do calmly over the\nphone as she and Jin headed back early.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yoongi?&rdquo;\nTae repeated, not really waiting for the man to reply, just wanting to try to\nget his attention and inform him of what he was doing so he wouldn&rsquo;t freak\nout. &nbsp;&ldquo;I need to get you to the bath. &nbsp;Can you stand?&rdquo; &nbsp;Yoongi grunted, and he started to push\nhimself off of the wall and floor at the same time, which Tae knew wasn&rsquo;t going\nto work for long, so he took advantage of Yoongi lifting himself just enough to\nslide an arm under his knees and around his back. &nbsp;Despite his small size, Yoongi definitely\nweighed more than Hoseok, and Tae tottered a bit as he stood up, thankful that\nthe wall was so close and Yoongi seemed to be pressing his hand flat against it\nas they rose. &nbsp;He only had a few feet to\ngo, anyway, but he moved carefully more than quickly, noting how Yoongi mumbled\nsomething before sinking forward a little, his head ducked and causing enough\nof a shift in balance for Tae to press his own back against the wall to avoid\nfalling over. &nbsp;Taking a deep breath, he\ntook the last two steps toward the tub, bending down just enough so he could\nlet his arm out from under Yoongi&rsquo;s legs.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Stand\nup for me, yeah? &nbsp;Just for a second,&rdquo; Tae\nmumbled, his arm still secure around Yoongi&rsquo;s back as the man complied weakly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay, good job. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve got you, just stand still for another\nsecond.&rdquo; &nbsp;Moving carefully, one hand\nsecure on Yoongi&rsquo;s shoulder and his other arm reaching around to rest securing\naround his ribs, Tae stepped into the tub behind him. &nbsp;Yoongi&rsquo;s back and chest flushed, little\nblotches of red like drops of paint breaking out all over his skin, and his\nsweat made Tae&rsquo;s hands slip a little, but he pressed his fingers harder into\nthe man&rsquo;s flesh, ignoring the way Yoongi groaned again and finally moved, his\nhand grabbing Tae&rsquo;s wrist. &nbsp;Unsure if he\nwas just holding on or trying to push him away, Tae shushed him a little. &nbsp;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Need\nyou to sit down now, okay? &nbsp;Gently,\nslowly.&rdquo; &nbsp;Pulling him close as he\nsquatted, Tae let out a breath as Yoongi sat back. &nbsp;Letting him go once he was secure on his\nbottom, Tae checked his forehead again, hissing as the man curled up and put\nhis head on his knees.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Okay,\nthis is going to be cold, but I need you to just sit here for a second,\nokay? &nbsp;I&rsquo;m going to check on the boys and\nget you some water. &nbsp;Will you be alright\nfor a minute?&rdquo; Tae said, watching as Yoongi barely nodded. &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay, okay, then just hold still for me for\na little bit.&rdquo; &nbsp;Patting Yoongi&rsquo;s head\nonce, Tae pushed himself up from the side of the tub, fiddling with the handles\na little before the shower came on. &nbsp;The\nfirst spray was frigid, and Yoongi let out a small cry, jerking a little.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Sorry,\nsorry. &nbsp;I know,&rdquo; Tae mumbled, making it\nslightly warmer but still keeping it pointed toward the C. &nbsp;&ldquo;Just a minute. &nbsp;Hold on.&rdquo; \nNot waiting to see if Yoongi nodded or even agreed, Tae turned to go,\nstilling the moment he saw the door open, Jimin and Jungkook standing there\nquietly. &nbsp;Jungkook had Bun-bun in front\nof his face, his own eyes barely peeking out past the rabbit&rsquo;s fur, and Jimin\nwas biting his bottom lip, his cheeks and eyes red.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Tae-tae,&rdquo;\nthe boy said, his lip wobbling the moment he let go of it, &ldquo;is Yoo-yoo dying?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;What?&rdquo;\nTae balked before recovering himself. \n&ldquo;No, no. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t worry. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s just sick.&rdquo; &nbsp;Ushering the boys out, though they both\nseemed reluctant to go, Tae hurried them into the living room. &nbsp;&ldquo;Jimin, can you get me a cup? &nbsp;Jungkook, we need some clothes for your\nuncle. &nbsp;Do you know where those are?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Jung&rsquo;oo&rsquo;\n&lsquo;an help,&rdquo; Jungkook nodded, his words mostly muffled by his bunny&rsquo;s fabric as\nhe headed toward the only dresser in the room. \nFollowing him, Tae pulled out what he needed before patting Jungkook&rsquo;s\nhead in thanks.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Will\nthis do?&rdquo; Jimin said from the kitchen, emerging from one of the cabinets brandishing\na plastic cup as if it was the Holy Grail.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Perfect,&rdquo;\nTae said honestly, smiling at the boy as he took it. &nbsp;Filling it up quickly with water, he started\nto carry the items back to the bathroom. \nPausing immediately, however, he turned back to the boys who stopped\nshort, almost bumping into him they were following him so closely.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Boys,\nyour uncle is sick, and you need to sleep somewhere else tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Can\nwe stay at yours?&rdquo; Jimin said hesitantly, but Tae shook his head.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;We\ncan&rsquo;t leave your uncle alone, can we? &nbsp;So\nwe need to make a bed on the floor. &nbsp;Do\nyou know where the extra blankets are?&rdquo; \nJimin nodded, looking across the room at a closet.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I\ndon&rsquo;t know if I can reach,&rdquo; he mumbled, sounding infinitely displeased with\nhimself.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Okay,\nokay, don&rsquo;t hurt yourself. &nbsp;But if you\ncan, get them out for us, okay? &nbsp;Just\ngive us a minute in the bathroom, alright?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Bathroom\nis pri-bit,&rdquo; Jungkook nodded into Bun-bun&rsquo;s back again. &nbsp;Unable to keep a small, endearing smile from\nhis face, Tae nodded back before rushing to the bathroom. &nbsp;Closing the door again behind him, he closed\nthe toilet seat and put Yoongi&rsquo;s clothes on it, crouching down by the tub to\nturn the water off. &nbsp;By now, Yoongi was\nshaking, his teeth audibly chattering, and the sight made Tae curse under his\nbreath.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Sorry,\nsorry,&rdquo; he hissed, lifting Yoongi&rsquo;s head up and pushing his hair out of the\nway. &nbsp;His forehead still felt plenty\nwarm, and he put his hand on the back of Yoongi&rsquo;s neck where his skin was still\nwet to lift the cup to his lips. &nbsp;&ldquo;Open,\nplease. &nbsp;I need you to drink this.&rdquo; &nbsp;Yoongi grunted at him, drops of water falling\nfrom his hair onto his nose and cheeks, but his lips stayed stubbornly pressed\ntogether.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yoongi,\nit&rsquo;s water. &nbsp;Just a sip or two, yeah?&rdquo; &nbsp;The man seemed to think for a second, so Tae\npressed the cup to his lips before removing it. \nThe third time the plastic touched Yoongi&rsquo;s bottom lip, the man finally\nsighed and open his mouth enough for Tae to tilt some water in. &nbsp;Only letting a sip in, he sat it down on the\nedge of the tub out of the way once they were done.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Good\njob,&rdquo; he said softly, watching the way Yoongi&rsquo;s face scrunched up. &nbsp;Licking his lips a few times, Yoongi turned\nhis head enough that Tae let go of him to stare back as Yoongi finally opened\nhis eyes. &nbsp;Something in them was akin to the\nlook Tae had seen when he found him outside when he had abandoned the boys\ninside, and Tae tried not to frown at how much he hated that look on the man&rsquo;s\nface, especially since he thought he knew what it was now.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo;\nhe said, &ldquo;the boys are fine. &nbsp;And you&rsquo;re\ngoing to be. &nbsp;We need to get you up and\nchanged and back to bed, though, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;How?&rdquo;\nYoongi frowned, his voice hoarse and rough. \nCocking his head, Tae frowned back.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Well,\nI&rsquo;m going to help you out, and then we&rsquo;ll dry you off, and I brought fresh\nclothes, then&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;No,\nhow?&rdquo; Yoongi asked again, resting his cheek on his knee and sighing again as he\nshuddered. &nbsp;Purely instinctually, Tae put\na hand on his back, trying to calm him down.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I\nheard the boys crying. &nbsp;You-you should\nreally lock your door, you know?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo;\nYoongi said, closing his eyes and taking a few deep breaths. &nbsp;Giving him a moment, Tae took the opportunity\nto look at the band tattoo on Yoongi&rsquo;s right bicep. &nbsp;From afar, he had thought it was just simply\nblack lines, but up close he realized there were tiny numbers sideways\nalongside the different lines.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\na camera lens,&rdquo; he mused out loud, his comment making Yoongi&rsquo;s eyes open again.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Your\ntattoo,&rdquo; Tae said, moving his hand to run his finger along the band. &nbsp;Following his movement, Yoongi&rsquo;s eyes\nnarrowed a bit before he shivered again, spurring Tae into action. &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay, time to get out. &nbsp;Can you stand?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll\ntry,&rdquo; Yoongi sighed, but Tae still put his hand on his back and held out his\nother one for Yoongi to take. &nbsp;The tub\nthankfully had an anti-slip mat in it, so Yoongi was able to get his footing a\nlittle before standing up, Tae standing with him to help him. &nbsp;Moving to take both of his hands, Tae stepped\nback a bit as Yoongi lifted one foot and then the other. &nbsp;The man let out a gruff laugh which made Tae\nraise his eyebrows at him once he was out of the bathtub.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Feel\nlike an old man,&rdquo; Yoongi mumbled.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;You\nare pretty old. &nbsp;Put your hands on the\ncounter,&rdquo; Tae instructed him, not waiting for any comeback or denial. &nbsp;Moving around behind him, Tae put his hands\non Yoongi&rsquo;s still wet hips as he did so the man knew where he was, only letting\ngo of him to open the cabinet above the toilet to pull a towel out. &nbsp;He attributed the shudder that he felt run\nthrough Yoongi&rsquo;s body when his hands brushed against him to the cold, so he\nhurried to wrap the towel around the man&rsquo;s shoulders.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Can\nyou get dressed, or do you want my help?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;&rsquo;m\nnot a child,&rdquo; Yoongi grumbled, and Tae ducked his head behind the man&rsquo;s back so\nhe couldn&rsquo;t see him smiling at him in the mirror. &nbsp;He must be feeling a little better if he was\nbeing stubborn.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I\nknow that, but that&rsquo;s not what I was asking, so don&rsquo;t speak like a child and\ntell me if you want my help or not,&rdquo; Tae said. \nWhen Yoongi didn&rsquo;t respond, he lifted his head curiously to look at the\nman&rsquo;s face in the mirror. &nbsp;His brow was a\nlittle furrowed, and he looked very confused. \nCocking his head again, Tae raised his eyebrows inquisitively. &nbsp;Pulling the towel around him, Yoongi shook\nhis head a little and clamped his mouth shut, avoiding Tae&rsquo;s gaze.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo;\nTae said slowly, stepping away from Yoongi even though he kept an eye on him as\nhe did so, noticing the way his shoulders were slumped. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go check on the boys,\nthen. &nbsp;If I hear any alarming noises, I&rsquo;m\ngoing to come back even if your pants aren&rsquo;t on or something. &nbsp;So hurry up. \nBut go slowly. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t bend down if\nyou&rsquo;re really dizzy. &nbsp;Are you dizzy?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;No,\nTae, I&rsquo;m okay,&rdquo; Yoongi muttered even though Tae knew he wasn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;Humming, unconvinced, Tae patted his shoulder\non top of the towel a couple of times before heading out, his ears perked for\nany sounds of distress. &nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t close\nthe door all the way, either, but left it a little ajar as he hurried back to\nthe living room.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nThe\nboys had not been idle, though Jimin had been right. &nbsp;They couldn&rsquo;t quite reach the blankets in\nYoongi&rsquo;s closet, but they had been constructing a way to get to them with the\nboxes they found.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Oh,\nwhoa, hold on, no, nope, wait,&rdquo; Tae almost squeaked, rushing with his hands out\neven as Jimin was climbing up on a flimsy looking cardboard box. &nbsp;Frowning fiercely at him, Jimin huffed but\nclimbed down, looking utterly defeated again.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I\ntold you I can&rsquo;t reach them,&rdquo; he said as if it was all Tae&rsquo;s fault he was only\nfour and so short.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nokay, it&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; Tae reassured him, reaching easily up and grabbing a bundle\nof blankets from the top shelf. &nbsp;&ldquo;We can\nstart with this, and I&rsquo;ll run and grab some more from my place. &nbsp;Can you two set these up on the floor while I\ngo do that really quick?&rdquo; &nbsp;Nodding\nenthusiastically, Jimin and Jungkook took the blankets from him, both of them a\nlittle overburdened; while not heavy, the blankets were large, and they walked\na little like pregnant ladies toward the bed, only stopping when they bumped into\nit. &nbsp;Chuckling quietly, Tae half-jogged\nout the door and to his place. &nbsp;He was\nstruck by how messy his apartment was in comparison to Yoongi&rsquo;s, but he only\ntook the time to grab his phone charger and tooth brush along with a stray\nblanket and as many pillows as he could hold. \nJin once told him he had a pillow problem, but Tae only thought he had a\npillow paradise.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nThe\ndoor still wasn&rsquo;t locked when he got back, but Yoongi had appeared from the\nbathroom. &nbsp;He was leaned on the wall in\nthe hallway, looking winded and still sickly pale, but there was a small smile\non his face. &nbsp;It slipped when his eyes left\nthe boys and landed on Tae, but Tae didn&rsquo;t take it personally. &nbsp;He knew, by this point, that he was\nmeddling. &nbsp;Yoongi could rightfully tell him\nto fuck off anytime, and he would go. &nbsp;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nThough\nhe was used to other people leaving before he did, he knew he should respect\nYoongi&rsquo;s boundaries. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s why he dropped\nthe blankets and pillows he was carrying on top of Jimin and Jungkook&rsquo;s heads,\ntheir giggles muffled as they fought their way out before he turned to Yoongi.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Come\non, old man,&rdquo; he joked, holding out an arm like he was about to escort a\ndebutant to a ball, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get you to bed.&rdquo; \nYoongi rolled his eyes but lifted off of the wall and let Tae maneuver\nhis forearm on top of his. &nbsp;Wrapping his\nfingers around his for more stability, Tae shuffled slowly toward Yoongi&rsquo;s bed,\nsteering him clear of the growing pile of fabric on the floor.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yoo-yoo,&rdquo;\nJimin said once he was free from the blankets and noticed his uncle.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Hold\non,&rdquo; Tae warned, holding them back with his hand until Yoongi could sit down on\nthe edge of the bed. &nbsp;He started to pull\nhis arm and then his hand away, but Yoongi&rsquo;s fingers seemed stuck to his. &nbsp;Between his. \nYoongi was looking down at their joint hands, and Tae looked down, too,\nstilling himself instead of just whipping his arm away. &nbsp;Even though his arm was a bit twisted and he\nhad to move to Yoongi&rsquo;s side instead of standing in front of him to accommodate\nthe man, Tae didn&rsquo;t mind. &nbsp;Because he was\nseeing something in Yoongi, some side of him he hadn&rsquo;t before, and for the\nsecond time that day he couldn&rsquo;t help but look at the man. &nbsp;Look at how thin his fingers were, how\npronounced his collarbones were, how pale and soft his skin was, how his mint\ngreen hair fell into his eyes and brushed against his long eyelashes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nHe was undeniably incredibly handsome, and\nTae felt his fingers twitch in his own before Yoongi withdrew his hand, letting\nit fall lamely onto his thigh as he mumbled something. &nbsp;Another group of blotches appeared on his\nskin, and Tae realized the man was blushing. \nHe tried to draw his own hand back slowly, his palm still warm from\nwhere Yoongi&rsquo;s fingers had held on tightly, as he continued to look at the\nman. &nbsp;A small person brushing past him\nfinally distracted him, though, and he took an awkward step back as Jimin and\nJungkook clung to their uncle&rsquo;s legs, staring up at him with frowns.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yoo-yoo,\nare you okay?&rdquo; Jimin said.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll\nbe fine,&rdquo; Yoongi grimaced, forcing a smile that Tae saw right through.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Tae-tae&rsquo;s\ngonna stay with us, okay?&rdquo; Jimin continued, suddenly sounding like he was the\nadult in the room.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Jimin,\nwe can&rsquo;t make&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;No,\nhe said, he said. &nbsp;Right, Tae-tae?&rdquo; Jimin\nsaid, looking up with wide, pleading eyes and a pout that rivaled the cutest\npuppies Tae had ever seen, and Tae had seen a lot of sickeningly cute puppies.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I-I\ndid offer. &nbsp;I mean, if it&rsquo;s okay with\nyour uncle. &nbsp;I-I don&rsquo;t want to\nintrude.&rdquo; &nbsp;Yoongi opened his mouth as he\nfrowned up at Tae, but he seemed to decide against whatever he was going to\nsay.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;If\nyou get sick, don&rsquo;t blame me,&rdquo; Yoongi sighed, patting Jungkook&rsquo;s head before\nlying down on his side. &nbsp;Jungkook started\nto climb up onto the mattress with him, but Tae finally stepped forward to pick\nthe boy up, swinging him around a few times before placing him on a pillow on\nthe ground.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Your\nuncle needs the bed himself tonight, okay? \nWe&rsquo;re going to make a bed on the floor.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Can\nwe make a tent?&rdquo; Jimin suggested, leaning on the mattress still as he watched\nYoongi close his eyes.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;A\ntent?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;A\nfort.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I\nbet we can, as long as we&rsquo;re quiet so Yoongi can sleep,&rdquo; Tae said, tapping his\nchin as if in deep thought.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yoo-yoo,&rdquo;\nJungkook corrected him.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Oh,\nright. &nbsp;Yoo-yoo,&rdquo; Tae winked at the\nlittle boy who shot him a shy grin back before stuffing his face into Bun-bun\nand rolling off the pillow he was on into the pile of blankets. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to order food, too, for\ndinner. &nbsp;Is that okay, Yoo-yoo?&rdquo; &nbsp;He couldn&rsquo;t help the teasing tone in his\nvoice, but when he grinned down at Yoongi, the man didn&rsquo;t respond, his mouth\nalready slightly open and his breath heavy. \n</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;\nTae whispered, putting a finger to his lips to Jimin and Jungkook. &nbsp;They both copied the action, and Jungkook\nseemed to find it hilarious as he broke into a peel of laughter before clamping\na hand over his mouth, his eyes wide in shock. \nSnorting, Tae reached past Yoongi to pull the covers over him. &nbsp;Unable to resist, he placed his hand on the\nman&rsquo;s forehead one more time. &nbsp;He was\nstill abnormally warm, but when he hummed and pushed his head a little forward\ninto Tae&rsquo;s palm, Tae couldn&rsquo;t help but run his fingers through his hair a few\ntimes as his breathing evened out.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Good\nnight, Yoo-yoo,&rdquo; he whispered, smiling at how beautiful Yoongi looked while he\nslept. &nbsp;If he didn&rsquo;t have to attend to\nthe children behind him, he would have loved to keep looking at Yoongi for hours,\ndetermined to see every side, every part, every frown, every smile that the man\ncould offer.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fever dreams, in a word, are\nweird. &nbsp;If Yoongi didn&rsquo;t already know he\nwas sick, the dreams would have been a giant neon flashing sign indicating how his\nbrain was slowly being melted. &nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The dreams that made no sense were\nalarming. &nbsp;The ones where he couldn&rsquo;t\nidentify anyone&rsquo;s face because they kept ballooning up before shrinking down,\ntheir eyes melting and mouths twisting like some Picasso painting left out in\nthe rain. &nbsp;The ones that kept restarting\nlike some saved video game as he ran down a mountain away from ninjas on\nbicycles and then from bears who chased him to the top of a roof he tried to\njump off and then from what looked like ninja bears who finally made him wake\nup in a cold sweat. &nbsp;The ones he couldn&rsquo;t\nremember but he knew felt so real they were so vivid in the middle of them that\nhe didn&rsquo;t know he was dreaming but ended up being black holes, leaving him with\nnothing but a sense of unease when he woke. \nThese dreams, the one a therapist might want to analyze in excruciating\ndetail, made no sense, but their tone was the same. &nbsp;Despair and survival and fear pervaded\nthrough them all.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The dreams of his neighbor were\nconfusing, because Yoongi didn&rsquo;t often recognize the people in his dreams. &nbsp;He wasn&rsquo;t used to his dreams recurring,\neither, but it seemed like every time he slipped into sleep, Tae was there. &nbsp;He was an outside observer the first time,\nlike a hovering camera attached to a drone. \nTae was riding on, of all things, an elephant. &nbsp;The figure on top of the giant animal was so\nobviously Tae. &nbsp;He was too tan to be\nanyone else, and his smile, a big, boxy, goofy smile so proud like he had just\ntamed this wild beast and claimed it as his own, was so obviously Tae. &nbsp;Still, the image was so bizarre that Yoongi&rsquo;s\nmind tried to change the channel.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The next time he saw Tae, he was\nsitting in a coffee shop. &nbsp;The setting\nsoothed his mind, and since he was aware he was dreaming, he allowed himself to\nsettle into this dream. &nbsp;He could almost\nhear the soft jazz playing through the speakers. &nbsp;He could almost hear the hiss of the espresso\nmachine and the calling of names and clacking of computer keyboards and humming\nof someone sitting next to him. &nbsp;For some\nreason, it was Sunmi. &nbsp;And while part of\nhis brain questioned her appearance immediately, dream Yoongi was completely at\nease. &nbsp;It made sense in Yoongi&rsquo;s consciousness,\nhe rationalized later. &nbsp;He had always\nfelt comfortable around Sunmi. &nbsp;They had\nbeen friends first, and most of their communication had been in the form of\nsarcasm and teasing. &nbsp;Even when they\nbroke up, it was completely amenable. \nNothing had been wrong in their relationship, but they both realized\nthey had gotten and stayed together more for comfortability than\ncompatibility. &nbsp;They had sat in many a coffee\nshop almost daily when they dated, so Yoongi almost thought he was dreaming a\nmemory. &nbsp;She was as gorgeous as the last\ntime he had seen her, her cheekbones high and lips painted a vibrant red, her\nfavorite shade. &nbsp;She didn&rsquo;t look up from\nher phone or her book once, but even that didn&rsquo;t bother Yoongi. &nbsp;It was comfortable, and it was the first pleasant\ndream he could recall having since he had gotten sick.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But then some commotion caught his\nattention, instantly shattering any pretense that this was a memory. &nbsp;The shouting and yelling was almost comical,\nlike he was watching some bad drama, but the sound of a slap was what made him\nrise. &nbsp;He felt see-through, though, like\nhe didn&rsquo;t have legs. &nbsp;He couldn&rsquo;t see his\nown hands, even, but he was moving across the shop that soon dissolved into a\ndumpster, no, a trash pile, no, an entire dump. \nTrash looming all around him, boxes and stacks of trash, bags and stray\nitems, discarded food and broken toys, clothes with holes and books with\nmold. &nbsp;He wanted to stop, to turn around,\nto run away from all of that, or stay and clean it, but he heard another smack,\nclearly someone&rsquo;s skin hitting another, so he stumbled over and pushed through\nthe waste in front of him until it disappeared. \n</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nHis\nneighbor was sitting in the corner holding his hand to his cheek, and some\nnameless and faceless entity was standing over him, more of a black, formless\nshape than man, though its voice was rough and jeering and biting as it\nshouted, so Yoongi, who, once he got past his anger stage, couldn&rsquo;t imagine\never hitting anyone for any reason, rushed forward to push the man, the thing,\nout of the way, except the moment he lunged at it, it disappeared. &nbsp;He stumbled over his own feet, then, and fell\nonto his knees, staring at the hands that had appeared. &nbsp;He became fascinated by them because they\nweren&rsquo;t his hands. &nbsp;They couldn&rsquo;t be; there\nwas no tattoo on his arms, and he had this one vein that always stuck out,\nprotruding a little, on his left hand. &nbsp;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nThese\nhands weren&rsquo;t his, but he recognized them. \nHe made a fist and twisted them around, looking at the back of\nthem. &nbsp;At the back of his brother&rsquo;s hands. &nbsp;When he heard a whimper in the corner, his\neyes finally snapped up, but Tae was gone. \nJimin was huddled there instead, his puffy cheeks red and wet with tears\nas he shook, and Jungkook stood in front of him, his arms out and his feet spread\nwide as if to shield his brother from view.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Yoongi&mdash;his brother? his brother&rsquo;s hands&mdash;reached toward him, though,\nthe boy actually growled and bore his teeth, no small rabbit teeth turning into\nsharp razor fangs, the hands recoiled immediately, so quickly that Yoongi felt\nhimself stumble backwards, falling back, back, back, until he fell out of the\ndream completely and onto his bed so quickly the air got knocked out of him,\nand he sat up, gasping for breath.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yoongi?&rdquo;\na deep and sleep addled voice mumbled, and Yoongi clamped his eyes shut to stop\nthe world from spinning, to stop anything from spilling out of him.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yoongi? &nbsp;Breathe, Yoongi,&rdquo; the voice said, and he did,\nharshly, the release so painful he felt like he had been punched. &nbsp;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re\nokay.&rdquo; &nbsp;The voice had a body. &nbsp;It was real, and warm, and its hand was\nrubbing Yoongi&rsquo;s back as he hunched over, putting his head between his knees\nand clenching his fingers around his shins. \n</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;There\nwe go. &nbsp;In and out. &nbsp;Did you have a nightmare?&rdquo; &nbsp;Nodding gently, Yoongi heard the voice sigh\nin sympathy.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Do\nyou want to tell me about it?&rdquo; &nbsp;He\ndid. &nbsp;He wanted to tell him how afraid he\nwas. &nbsp;How much he felt like he was\nmessing up. &nbsp;How easily and quickly dreams\ncould become reality and reality could merge into dreams. &nbsp;But he shook his head, instead. &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay, that&rsquo;s okay. &nbsp;Do you want some water?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Jun-Junki,&rdquo;\nYoongi shuddered, trying to fold into himself more and more. &nbsp;&ldquo;I dreamed you&mdash;you died. &nbsp;You left me, and, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Oh,\nYoongi,&rdquo; the voice said slowly, the hand stilling on his back. &nbsp;Another shudder, and the hand started to move\naway. &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s lay you back\ndown. &nbsp;Can you do that&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Please,&rdquo;\nYoongi pleaded, fumbling to grab onto something and falling into the voice&rsquo;s\nchest. &nbsp;It, he, was so warm, warm and welcoming,\nand Yoongi wanted to stay there forever. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t leave me again. &nbsp;I-I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;O-okay,&rdquo;\nthe voice said uneasily. &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay, I-I&rsquo;m\nhere. &nbsp;Just-just lie down, again? &nbsp;Here we go.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nYoongi\nlet himself be guided, led, moved because it&rsquo;s what he needed. &nbsp;He needed just one good dream, just one\ncomforting thought. &nbsp;He needed the hand\nbrushing through his hair and the arm holding him close. &nbsp;He needed the chest to sob into, the warm\nskin to welcome him back even after he had been away for so long. &nbsp;He needed that voice to tell him he was going\nto be alright, that they were going to be alright, that everything was going to\nbe alright.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Okay,\nokay,&rdquo; it said, which was almost good enough. \nIt almost sounded like him. &nbsp;It\nwas almost too good. &nbsp;It was the best fever\ndream he could remember having, and even if he knew it was a dream, the\nacknowledgement only made him calmer and more relaxed like he actually believed\neverything was going to be alright.</p><hr /><p><b>A/N:</b> AH!!!</p><p>I always have to have someone sick in a bathtub in my stories, apparently.</p><p>What&rsquo;s up with those dreams???&nbsp;
