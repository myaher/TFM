After all the lies, half truths and deceit he did love her to the point of obsession or at least a part of her. The part resembling her mother. He touched her like she was glass, he never marred her skin, left anything on her that would let anyone know that for a night she had been his. Or at least that&rsquo;s what she had thought, now she carries his child.&nbsp;</p><p>The months pass and her stomach grows, her siblings look at her with pity, as do the people and she wishes she cared enough to feel something about it. But she doesn&rsquo;t care, he is still with her and has never left her side.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe she loved him, maybe she cared for him. She will love this child, of that she is sure. Her siblings will not understand but she doesn&rsquo;t need them to. They didn&rsquo;t know him, not really. They knew of his actions and his decisions, they did not know him- not like she does.&nbsp;</p><p>When they child is born she names him Petyr, his eyes are the same mix of grey and green, his hair dark and curly. His smile is Sansa&rsquo;s though and she thinks that is for the best, if she ever saw his smile again she thinks she would break.</p><p>The babe is small, like him. Clever and witty, like him.&nbsp;</p><p>She watches him play and the smile on her face is sad, this must have been what he was like as a child. Young, carefree, happy- before the world crashed around him and he became the man she knew, the man she gave herself to, the man she had killed.</p><p>She will love and protect this child, she won&rsquo;t let him grow into the man he was, this child will have fresh start and be loved. Of that, she is sure.</p>",
