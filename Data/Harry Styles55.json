You went with the minivan in the company of Harry, Jeff, Glenne, Mitch, Sarah, Louis and Lottie. You were in the back with Lottie, Harry drove and Louis sat in front of you to be close to Lottie. </p><p>When you entered Chicago you haven\u2019t noticed anything unusual, but you heard Jeff talking to Harry about some other direction. You didn\u2019t bother asking about it. You arrived in the city centre and Harry drove into a big underground parking lot. When Harry stopped he finally informed everyone about what\u2019s happening. </p><p>\u201cSo, we\u2019ll have two days off and I thought you\u2019d like to relax some. Some others are here already. I booked you rooms and treatments in the spa. It\u2019s a gift from me to you to thank everyone for what you\u2019re doing for me every day. Everyone was excited and happy except you. They were all paired. Mitch and Sarah, Jeff and Glenne, Louis and Lottie, Harry and you. But you weren\u2019t ready to be in the same room with him for two days and he should\u2019ve known that. You got frustrated and hoped it\u2019s gonna be over very soon. But you didn\u2019t want to ruin others\u2019 happiness. When you all went in and Harry checked everyone in, he guided everyone to their rooms. You were the last one.</p><p>\u201cThis is your room,\u201d he said and handed you the key. You took it and he started walking away. So he did not want to force you to spend time with him. How could you think that? He was a gentleman even though you knew he wanted it. He only walked to the next door. You were still standing there with the key in one hand and with your suitcase in the other. He looked back and smiled before he entered his room. You thought the best would be to actually relax now you\u2019ve got this as a gift. You had an hour long massage and then you tried to find a spot near the pool that is not too crowded, but you saw the others coming down all together so you decided to sneak out to be alone. Lottie texted you.</p><p>\u201cEverything alright? Haven\u2019t seen you since we arrived. Or r u with H? ;)\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not, I just want to relax alone. See you tomorrow L, have fun!\u201d</p><p>You put your phone down and called room service. You ordered yourself lunch. You enjoyed the food, the silence and being alone. Tour is hectic sometimes, you\u2019re always in noise or loud surroundings but this silence was calming. It was so silent that you heard something. Someone. Harry. </p><p>You had no idea where the voice is coming from until you realized that he\u2019s next door. It was a luxury hotel and it was weird noises were so easily heard through the wall. You stood up and started examining the wall between you two. You put your ear on it and you were sure now that Harry is singing in the other room. You touched the wall and you jumped when the wall moved. It got wide open and you realized that your two rooms could be opened together. But there wasn\u2019t a usual door, there was a wall-like door. </p><p>When it opened you and Harry looked at each other.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry, I didn\u2019t realize it was a door,\u201d you said awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cNo, sorry for not telling you they can be opened together. I thought it\u2019s locked. It was the last two rooms besides the king suite, but I thought you wouldn\u2019t want to stay with me for the night.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay. It\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll close this and let you sing,\u201d you said. You now saw the door opener and with the same move, the wall/door closed. Later that day when the pool area has started to get empty you went down to swim. Your mind was still in sync with Harry\u2019s. He came down ten minutes later, only three or four people were still in the pool area. Everyone has gone to the restaurant to have dinner by now. He nodded from afar, you smiled back. When the pool has closed you went back together to your rooms. </p><p>\u201cI want to invite you for dinner to my room,\u201d he said and you looked up at him. \u201cAs a friend. Just a friendly dinner. We could talk about work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. That\u2019s great. In an hour, is that fine?\u201d you asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s great!\u201d he smiled. </p><p>You were actually glad you both took a step forward. You had to learn to be friends again. You didn\u2019t know what to wear, elegant or casual so you tried to be somewhere in the middle. You put on pink high-waisted velvet jeans with black velvet pussy-bow blouse. You knocked before opening the door. Harry was ready. He wore black skinny jeans with a lousy colorful Gucci shirt. </p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cThank you! You look great!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI already ordered some fine wine. Can I pour?\u201d </p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d you said. He poured wine for both of you and then you went through the menu to order. While you waited, you sat outside in the dark on the balcony with your wines. </p><p>\u201cMum said she called you, but you haven\u2019t called her back,\u201d he started a conversation.</p><p>\u201cOh, dammit, I forgot. I\u2019ll call her tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. She knows you\u2019re busy and just wanted to make sure you\u2019re doing okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very nice from her. I think she loves me more than my own mother. She hasn\u2019t called me since they were on the concert back home,\u201d you sighed. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be, it\u2019s not your fault,\u201d you sipped from your glass. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice that you gave us this gift. I had a massage before lunch. It was very much needed.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure then. You all deserve it. You work hard for the success that is seemingly just mine, but it\u2019s our success. I can\u2019t thank the crew and my friends enough for what they, I mean what you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, you are the kind of boss that people are happy to work for,\u201d you smiled. </p><p>\u201cI heard you and Kacey are getting along,\u201dHarry said. </p><p>\u201cYes, we head a heartfelt conversation about how much of an idiot I am,\u201d you laughed. Harry laughed too.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not, you just\u2026,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI judged too fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean everyone knew Ruston, except you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t judge me, Lottie said it\u2019s because..,\u201d you stopped.</p><p>\u201cBecause what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLottie said it\u2019s because I was too high up in your arse to notice anything else,\u201d you blurted out.</p><p>\u201cWas she right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. My work is to know everything that\u2019s going on about you, and you\u2019re bloody famous so I have a lot of work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d You heard the knock and Harry let the waiter in. You started having dinner and you continued the conversation. After you finished at around 10pm you said goodbye and went back to your room. You were happy that you could have a normal conversation and felt really good. </p><p>It was already about 3am when you woke up sweating and breathing heavily. You were fighting very hard in your dream. You were fighting with Mike and killed him, because he killed Harry. Just before you woke up, you weep over Harry\u2019s dead body. You knew it was just a dream but it was so damn realistic, you needed to be sure Harry is still alive. You got out of bed and put the robe on. You tried to quietly open the door between yours and Harry\u2019s room. You sneaked in and saw him sleeping there like a baby. He made those little noises. You started crying by the sight and the memory of what you saw in the dream. You gently caressed his hair to wake him up. He slowly opened his eyes but got up very quickly when he saw you sobbing by his bed. </p><p>\u201cWhat happened? Love, tell me! Are you okay?\u201d he asked worriedly. You nodded and he kissed your forehead and pulled you close to his chest. </p><p>\u201cI just\u2026 uh.. It\u2019s stupid. I\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t want to&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just had a bad dream. You died in my arms and everything was covered in blood. Your blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, darling. Come \u2018ere!\u201d he pulled you in fully and cradled you for a few minutes. </p><p>\u201cHarry, please don\u2019t misunderstand me, but can I stay for the rest of the night?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said and made space for you on the bed. You took the robe off and turned to face him, he pulled you close and caressed your back until you fell asleep. </p><p>The next thing you remember is waking up in Harry\u2019s room, but he\u2019s not there. You got out of bed and found a note on the table. \u201cI went to the gym and for breakfast, you can stay as long as you want :)\u201d</p><p>You went back to your room and dressed up. You ordered breakfast to your room and called Lottie to visit you. She arrived a few minutes later. </p><p>\u201cHey! I brought you a smoothie, y/n,\u201d she said as she balanced hers and your cup in her hands. </p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d she sat down and you saw that she\u2019s a bit weird. \u201cWhat\u2019s that, Lottie? I can see something\u2019s wrong. Is it Louis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s\u2026 ugh\u2026 I didn\u2019t want to tell it, but you know I can\u2019t keep it inside. I don\u2019t want to spread rumours but I saw this with my own eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d you frowned.</p><p>\u201cI met Harry in the hallway this morning by his door. And he said he goes to the gym, but I had a look into his room\u2026 and I saw the bed\u2026 and there was a \u2026 a woman was in his bed. y/n I\u2019m so sorry to tell you this,\u201d Lottie was really sad but you started laughing and that made her confused. \u201cAren\u2019t you upset that he spent the night with another girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would be, but I was in his bed. You saw me,\u201d Lottie\u2019s eyes went wide.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You already back together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and I only got there in the am. I had a terrible dream about Harry dying and I really needed comfort. So I went there and fell asleep in his arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds pretty good too, except the death part,\u201d she said. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you chuckled. </p><p>This day was filled with massages and special treatments. You didn\u2019t talk about the night with Harry. You only met at lunch and at dinner because you had them all together. But it was nice that you could hang out with each other and others and actually enjoy it. The next day everyone moved into another hotel and went to the venue because it was concert night again. You had lots of work to do because you haven\u2019t done anything in two days.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"268\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"harrv:M7qy1Zr0WAGHbU_HwBRLPQ:Zqlrkn2ZOZje4\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/28c38b730f58c68dc1b1e780866c3de8/tumblr_pb6jwyqQ4q1tzyky4o1_400.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"268\" data-orig-height=\"268\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"stylesinthewild:LOn-DkE_VAFK70lpIK4nFQ:Z-899i2ZPDJji\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/15311d5742380030d67e7c2f672ab91c/tumblr_pb779stfIi1v6scw1o3_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"300\" data-orig-height=\"403\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"spookingisfun:Ab3KsLbEBc5KO12rh8O_1w:ZFDrGq2ZOaloW\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e93b7e6ffb5027ff19ef33431a4ed6bd/tumblr_pb6kewyXDu1skoenyo1_400.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"300\" data-orig-height=\"403\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"nexttxyou:dGjp3des4aESmOKftHrd3A:ZyVqjj2ZOZbTm\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/75a0940e31213ab28ed90b39376a06ef/tumblr_pb6ju4aJGc1udd1p0o1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"500\"/></figure><p>So the day was a bit chaotic but the concert was fun as always. Harry was happy and jumpy, you could see that. And you knew it\u2019s partly because of you, because Harry felt the same as you. He exposed how you and him call Derrick \u201cFudgesickle\u201d. Well, he didn\u2019t say it\u2019s the two of you saying that, but you knew. </p><p>Just in a few days you enjoyed being around Harry again and you felt that things are going good. But you still needed some time to figure out the rest. Management was still a pain in the arse and you were thinking about waiting until the tour ends to get back together with Harry. </p>",

You went with the minivan in the company of Harry, Jeff, Glenne, Mitch, Sarah, Louis and Lottie. You were in the back with Lottie, Harry drove and Louis sat in front of you to be close to Lottie. </p><p>When you entered Chicago you haven\u2019t noticed anything unusual, but you heard Jeff talking to Harry about some other direction. You didn\u2019t bother asking about it. You arrived in the city centre and Harry drove into a big underground parking lot. When Harry stopped he finally informed everyone about what\u2019s happening. </p><p>\u201cSo, we\u2019ll have two days off and I thought you\u2019d like to relax some. Some others are here already. I booked you rooms and treatments in the spa. It\u2019s a gift from me to you to thank everyone for what you\u2019re doing for me every day. Everyone was excited and happy except you. They were all paired. Mitch and Sarah, Jeff and Glenne, Louis and Lottie, Harry and you. But you weren\u2019t ready to be in the same room with him for two days and he should\u2019ve known that. You got frustrated and hoped it\u2019s gonna be over very soon. But you didn\u2019t want to ruin others\u2019 happiness. When you all went in and Harry checked everyone in, he guided everyone to their rooms. You were the last one.</p><p>\u201cThis is your room,\u201d he said and handed you the key. You took it and he started walking away. So he did not want to force you to spend time with him. How could you think that? He was a gentleman even though you knew he wanted it. He only walked to the next door. You were still standing there with the key in one hand and with your suitcase in the other. He looked back and smiled before he entered his room. You thought the best would be to actually relax now you\u2019ve got this as a gift. You had an hour long massage and then you tried to find a spot near the pool that is not too crowded, but you saw the others coming down all together so you decided to sneak out to be alone. Lottie texted you.</p><p>\u201cEverything alright? Haven\u2019t seen you since we arrived. Or r u with H? ;)\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not, I just want to relax alone. See you tomorrow L, have fun!\u201d</p><p>You put your phone down and called room service. You ordered yourself lunch. You enjoyed the food, the silence and being alone. Tour is hectic sometimes, you\u2019re always in noise or loud surroundings but this silence was calming. It was so silent that you heard something. Someone. Harry. </p><p>You had no idea where the voice is coming from until you realized that he\u2019s next door. It was a luxury hotel and it was weird noises were so easily heard through the wall. You stood up and started examining the wall between you two. You put your ear on it and you were sure now that Harry is singing in the other room. You touched the wall and you jumped when the wall moved. It got wide open and you realized that your two rooms could be opened together. But there wasn\u2019t a usual door, there was a wall-like door. </p><p>When it opened you and Harry looked at each other.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry, I didn\u2019t realize it was a door,\u201d you said awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cNo, sorry for not telling you they can be opened together.

You went with the minivan in the company of Harry, Jeff, Glenne, Mitch, Sarah, Louis and Lottie. You were in the back with Lottie, Harry drove and Louis sat in front of you to be close to Lottie. </p><p>When you entered Chicago you haven\u2019t noticed anything unusual, but you heard Jeff talking to Harry about some other direction. You didn\u2019t bother asking about it. You arrived in the city centre and Harry drove into a big underground parking lot. When Harry stopped he finally informed everyone about what\u2019s happening. </p><p>\u201cSo, we\u2019ll have two days off and I thought you\u2019d like to relax some. Some others are here already. I booked you rooms and treatments in the spa. It\u2019s a gift from me to you to thank everyone for what you\u2019re doing for me every day. Everyone was excited and happy except you. They were all paired. Mitch and Sarah, Jeff and Glenne, Louis and Lottie, Harry and you. But you weren\u2019t ready to be in the same room with him for two days and he should\u2019ve known that. You got frustrated and hoped it\u2019s gonna be over very soon. But you didn\u2019t want to ruin others\u2019 happiness. When you all went in and Harry checked everyone in, he guided everyone to their rooms. You were the last one.</p><p>\u201cThis is your room,\u201d he said and handed you the key. You took it and he started walking away. So he did not want to force you to spend time with him. How could you think that? He was a gentleman even though you knew he wanted it. He only walked to the next door. You were still standing there with the key in one hand and with your suitcase in the other. He looked back and smiled before he entered his room. You thought the best would be to actually relax now you\u2019ve got this as a gift. You had an hour long massage and then you tried to find a spot near the pool that is not too crowded, but you saw the others coming down all together so you decided to sneak out to be alone. Lottie texted you.</p><p>\u201cEverything alright? Haven\u2019t seen you since we arrived. Or r u with H? ;)\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not, I just want to relax alone. See you tomorrow L, have fun!\u201d</p><p>You put your phone down and called room service. You ordered yourself lunch. You enjoyed the food, the silence and being alone. Tour is hectic sometimes, you\u2019re always in noise or loud surroundings but this silence was calming. It was so silent that you heard something. Someone. Harry. </p><p>You had no idea where the voice is coming from until you realized that he\u2019s next door. It was a luxury hotel and it was weird noises were so easily heard through the wall. You stood up and started examining the wall between you two. You put your ear on it and you were sure now that Harry is singing in the other room. You touched the wall and you jumped when the wall moved. It got wide open and you realized that your two rooms could be opened together. But there wasn\u2019t a usual door, there was a wall-like door. </p><p>When it opened you and Harry looked at each other.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry, I didn\u2019t realize it was a door,\u201d you said awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cNo, sorry for not telling you they can be opened together. I thought it\u2019s locked. It was the last two rooms besides the king suite, but I thought you wouldn\u2019t want to stay with me for the night.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay. It\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll close this and let you sing,\u201d you said. You now saw the door opener and with the same move, the wall/door closed. Later that day when the pool area has started to get empty you went down to swim. Your mind was still in sync with Harry\u2019s. He came down ten minutes later, only three or four people were still in the pool area. Everyone has gone to the restaurant to have dinner by now. He nodded from afar, you smiled back. When the pool has closed you went back together to your rooms. </p><p>\u201cI want to invite you for dinner to my room,\u201d he said and you looked up at him. \u201cAs a friend. Just a friendly dinner. We could talk about work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. That\u2019s great. In an hour, is that fine?\u201d you asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s great!\u201d he smiled. </p><p>You were actually glad you both took a step forward. You had to learn to be friends again. You didn\u2019t know what to wear, elegant or casual so you tried to be somewhere in the middle. You put on pink high-waisted velvet jeans with black velvet pussy-bow blouse. You knocked before opening the door. Harry was ready. He wore black skinny jeans with a lousy colorful Gucci shirt. </p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cThank you! You look great!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI already ordered some fine wine. Can I pour?\u201d </p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d you said. He poured wine for both of you and then you went through the menu to order. While you waited, you sat outside in the dark on the balcony with your wines. </p><p>\u201cMum said she called you, but you haven\u2019t called her back,\u201d he started a conversation.</p><p>\u201cOh, dammit, I forgot. I\u2019ll call her tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. She knows you\u2019re busy and just wanted to make sure you\u2019re doing okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very nice from her. I think she loves me more than my own mother. She hasn\u2019t called me since they were on the concert back home,\u201d you sighed. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be, it\u2019s not your fault,\u201d you sipped from your glass. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice that you gave us this gift. I had a massage before lunch. It was very much needed.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure then. You all deserve it. You work hard for the success that is seemingly just mine, but it\u2019s our success. I can\u2019t thank the crew and my friends enough for what they, I mean what you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, you are the kind of boss that people are happy to work for,\u201d you smiled. </p><p>\u201cI heard you and Kacey are getting along,\u201dHarry said. </p><p>\u201cYes, we head a heartfelt conversation about how much of an idiot I am,\u201d you laughed. Harry laughed too.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not, you just\u2026,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI judged too fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean everyone knew Ruston, except you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t judge me, Lottie said it\u2019s because..,\u201d you stopped.</p><p>\u201cBecause what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLottie said it\u2019s because I was too high up in your arse to notice anything else,\u201d you blurted out.</p><p>\u201cWas she right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. My work is to know everything that\u2019s going on about you, and you\u2019re bloody famous so I have a lot of work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d You heard the knock and Harry let the waiter in. You started having dinner and you continued the conversation. After you finished at around 10pm you said goodbye and went back to your room. You were happy that you could have a normal conversation and felt really good. </p><p>It was already about 3am when you woke up sweating and breathing heavily. You were fighting very hard in your dream. You were fighting with Mike and killed him, because he killed Harry. Just before you woke up, you weep over Harry\u2019s dead body. You knew it was just a dream but it was so damn realistic, you needed to be sure Harry is still alive. You got out of bed and put the robe on. You tried to quietly open the door between yours and Harry\u2019s room. You sneaked in and saw him sleeping there like a baby. He made those little noises. You started crying by the sight and the memory of what you saw in the dream. You gently caressed his hair to wake him up. He slowly opened his eyes but got up very quickly when he saw you sobbing by his bed. </p><p>\u201cWhat happened? Love, tell me! Are you okay?\u201d he asked worriedly. You nodded and he kissed your forehead and pulled you close to his chest. </p><p>\u201cI just\u2026 uh.. It\u2019s stupid. I\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t want to\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just had a bad dream. You died in my arms and everything was covered in blood. Your blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, darling. Come \u2018ere!\u201d he pulled you in fully and cradled you for a few minutes. </p><p>\u201cHarry, please don\u2019t misunderstand me, but can I stay for the rest of the night?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said and made space for you on the bed. You took the robe off and turned to face him, he pulled you close and caressed your back until you fell asleep. </p><p>The next thing you remember is waking up in Harry\u2019s room, but he\u2019s not there. You got out of bed and found a note on the table. \u201cI went to the gym and for breakfast, you can stay as long as you want :)\u201d</p><p>You went back to your room and dressed up. You ordered breakfast to your room and called Lottie to visit you. She arrived a few minutes later. </p><p>\u201cHey! I brought you a smoothie, y/n,\u201d she said as she balanced hers and your cup in her hands. </p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d she sat down and you saw that she\u2019s a bit weird. \u201cWhat\u2019s that, Lottie? I can see something\u2019s wrong. Is it Louis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s\u2026 ugh\u2026 I didn\u2019t want to tell it, but you know I can\u2019t keep it inside. I don\u2019t want to spread rumours but I saw this with my own eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d you frowned.</p><p>\u201cI met Harry in the hallway this morning by his door. And he said he goes to the gym, but I had a look into his room\u2026 and I saw the bed\u2026 and there was a \u2026 a woman was in his bed. y/n I\u2019m so sorry to tell you this,\u201d Lottie was really sad but you started laughing and that made her confused. \u201cAren\u2019t you upset that he spent the night with another girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would be, but I was in his bed. You saw me,\u201d Lottie\u2019s eyes went wide.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You already back together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and I only got there in the am. I had a terrible dream about Harry dying and I really needed comfort. So I went there and fell asleep in his arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds pretty good too, except the death part,\u201d she said. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you chuckled. </p><p>This day was filled with massages and special treatments. You didn\u2019t talk about the night with Harry. You only met at lunch and at dinner because you had them all together. But it was nice that you could hang out with each other and others and actually enjoy it. The next day everyone moved into another hotel and went to the venue because it was concert night again. You had lots of work to do because you haven\u2019t done anything in two days.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"268\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"harrv:M7qy1Zr0WAGHbU_HwBRLPQ:Zqlrkn2ZOZje4\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/28c38b730f58c68dc1b1e780866c3de8/tumblr_pb6jwyqQ4q1tzyky4o1_400.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"268\" data-orig-height=\"268\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"stylesinthewild:LOn-DkE_VAFK70lpIK4nFQ:Z-899i2ZPDJji\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/15311d5742380030d67e7c2f672ab91c/tumblr_pb779stfIi1v6scw1o3_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"300\" data-orig-height=\"403\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"spookingisfun:Ab3KsLbEBc5KO12rh8O_1w:ZFDrGq2ZOaloW\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e93b7e6ffb5027ff19ef33431a4ed6bd/tumblr_pb6kewyXDu1skoenyo1_400.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"300\" data-orig-height=\"403\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"nexttxyou:dGjp3des4aESmOKftHrd3A:ZyVqjj2ZOZbTm\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/75a0940e31213ab28ed90b39376a06ef/tumblr_pb6ju4aJGc1udd1p0o1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"500\"></figure><p>So the day was a bit chaotic but the concert was fun as always.

It&rsquo;s fine, I&rsquo;ll close this and let you sing,&rdquo; you said. You now saw the door opener and with the same move, the wall/door closed. Later that day when the pool area has started to get empty you went down to swim. Your mind was still in sync with Harry&rsquo;s. He came down ten minutes later, only three or four people were still in the pool area. Everyone has gone to the restaurant to have dinner by now. He nodded from afar, you smiled back. When the pool has closed you went back together to your rooms. </p><p>&ldquo;I want to invite you for dinner to my room,&rdquo; he said and you looked up at him. &ldquo;As a friend. Just a friendly dinner. We could talk about work.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure. That&rsquo;s great. In an hour, is that fine?&rdquo; you asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s great!&rdquo; he smiled. </p><p>You were actually glad you both took a step forward. You had to learn to be friends again. You didn&rsquo;t know what to wear, elegant or casual so you tried to be somewhere in the middle. You put on pink high-waisted velvet jeans with black velvet pussy-bow blouse. You knocked before opening the door. Harry was ready. He wore black skinny jeans with a lousy colorful Gucci shirt. </p><p>&ldquo;You look beautiful,&rdquo; he said. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you! You look great!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I already ordered some fine wine. Can I pour?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; you said. He poured wine for both of you and then you went through the menu to order. While you waited, you sat outside in the dark on the balcony with your wines. </p><p>&ldquo;Mum said she called you, but you haven&rsquo;t called her back,&rdquo; he started a conversation.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, dammit, I forgot. I&rsquo;ll call her tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. She knows you&rsquo;re busy and just wanted to make sure you&rsquo;re doing okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very nice from her. I think she loves me more than my own mother. She hasn&rsquo;t called me since they were on the concert back home,&rdquo; you sighed. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be, it&rsquo;s not your fault,&rdquo; you sipped from your glass. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really nice that you gave us this gift. I had a massage before lunch. It was very much needed.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my pleasure then. You all deserve it. You work hard for the success that is seemingly just mine, but it&rsquo;s our success. I can&rsquo;t thank the crew and my friends enough for what they, I mean what you do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Believe me, you are the kind of boss that people are happy to work for,&rdquo; you smiled. </p><p>&ldquo;I heard you and Kacey are getting along,&rdquo;Harry said. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, we head a heartfelt conversation about how much of an idiot I am,&rdquo; you laughed. Harry laughed too.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not, you just&hellip;,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I judged too fast.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I mean everyone knew Ruston, except you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t judge me, Lottie said it&rsquo;s because..,&rdquo; you stopped.</p><p>&ldquo;Because what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lottie said it&rsquo;s because I was too high up in your arse to notice anything else,&rdquo; you blurted out.</p><p>&ldquo;Was she right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess. My work is to know everything that&rsquo;s going on about you, and you&rsquo;re bloody famous so I have a lot of work.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fair enough.&rdquo; You heard the knock and Harry let the waiter in. You started having dinner and you continued the conversation. After you finished at around 10pm you said goodbye and went back to your room. You were happy that you could have a normal conversation and felt really good. </p><p>It was already about 3am when you woke up sweating and breathing heavily. You were fighting very hard in your dream. You were fighting with Mike and killed him, because he killed Harry. Just before you woke up, you weep over Harry&rsquo;s dead body. You knew it was just a dream but it was so damn realistic, you needed to be sure Harry is still alive. You got out of bed and put the robe on. You tried to quietly open the door between yours and Harry&rsquo;s room. You sneaked in and saw him sleeping there like a baby. He made those little noises. You started crying by the sight and the memory of what you saw in the dream. You gently caressed his hair to wake him up. He slowly opened his eyes but got up very quickly when he saw you sobbing by his bed. </p><p>&ldquo;What happened? Love, tell me! Are you okay?&rdquo; he asked worriedly. You nodded and he kissed your forehead and pulled you close to his chest. </p><p>&ldquo;I just&hellip; uh.. It&rsquo;s stupid. I&rsquo;m so sorry. I didn&rsquo;t want to&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I just had a bad dream. You died in my arms and everything was covered in blood. Your blood.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, darling. Come &lsquo;ere!&rdquo; he pulled you in fully and cradled you for a few minutes. </p><p>&ldquo;Harry, please don&rsquo;t misunderstand me, but can I stay for the rest of the night?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said and made space for you on the bed. You took the robe off and turned to face him, he pulled you close and caressed your back until you fell asleep. </p><p>The next thing you remember is waking up in Harry&rsquo;s room, but he&rsquo;s not there. You got out of bed and found a note on the table. &ldquo;I went to the gym and for breakfast, you can stay as long as you want :)&rdquo;</p><p>You went back to your room and dressed up. You ordered breakfast to your room and called Lottie to visit you. She arrived a few minutes later. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey! I brought you a smoothie, y/n,&rdquo; she said as she balanced hers and your cup in her hands. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; she sat down and you saw that she&rsquo;s a bit weird. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, Lottie? I can see something&rsquo;s wrong. Is it Louis?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s&hellip; ugh&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t want to tell it, but you know I can&rsquo;t keep it inside. I don&rsquo;t want to spread rumours but I saw this with my own eyes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; you frowned.</p><p>&ldquo;I met Harry in the hallway this morning by his door. And he said he goes to the gym, but I had a look into his room&hellip; and I saw the bed&hellip; and there was a &hellip; a woman was in his bed. y/n I&rsquo;m so sorry to tell you this,&rdquo; Lottie was really sad but you started laughing and that made her confused. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you upset that he spent the night with another girl?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I would be, but I was in his bed. You saw me,&rdquo; Lottie&rsquo;s eyes went wide.</p><p>&ldquo;What? You already back together?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, and I only got there in the am. I had a terrible dream about Harry dying and I really needed comfort. So I went there and fell asleep in his arms.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That sounds pretty good too, except the death part,&rdquo; she said. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; you chuckled. </p><p>This day was filled with massages and special treatments. You didn&rsquo;t talk about the night with Harry. You only met at lunch and at dinner because you had them all together. But it was nice that you could hang out with each other and others and actually enjoy it. The next day everyone moved into another hotel and went to the venue because it was concert night again. You had lots of work to do because you haven&rsquo;t done anything in two days.&nbsp;</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"1\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"2\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"3\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>So the day was a bit chaotic but the concert was fun as always. Harry was happy and jumpy, you could see that. And you knew it&rsquo;s partly because of you, because Harry felt the same as you. He exposed how you and him call Derrick &ldquo;Fudgesickle&rdquo;. Well, he didn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s the two of you saying that, but you knew. </p><p>Just in a few days you enjoyed being around Harry again and you felt that things are going good. But you still needed some time to figure out the rest. Management was still a pain in the arse and you were thinking about waiting until the tour ends to get back together with Harry. </p>",
