Like her parents in the living room, praising <i>his book</i> or gloomy Sandor in the kitchen. Arya couldn&rsquo;t decide what was worse, her dad announcing <i>he&rsquo;s wise beyond his years</i> or Sandor sniffling :</p><p>&lsquo;I knew the day would come, she&rsquo;s too good for me !&rsquo;</p><p>The worst was mum, Arya realized, who cared that the man was <i>dashingly handsome</i> !</p><p>It&rsquo;s not how it was meant to be.</p><!-- more --><p>When they told her Jaqen was coming back to Westeros she jumped with joy. She was ten when she last saw him. He used to be their neighbor and he was <i>her friend</i>. He was sweet, he used to tell her funny stories about dragons and spies. He was patient with her when she needed help with homework. Even though he knew she pretended to need help. And he never mocked her fencing lessons like other boys did. He even sparred with her once and let her win. They both knew he let her win but they chose to pretend he didn&rsquo;t. Arya liked his long red hair with funny white streaks, his Lorathi accent and his worn jeans. And she liked that funny feeling in her belly when other girls were looking at him whenever they strolled around the town together. She even tolerated his girlfriend. She was older than Jaqen and already studying in Braavos and he never spoke of her anyway.</p><p>Arya made plans for the whole summer for the two of them. They would feed strays and eat apples straight from the tree in her mother&rsquo;s garden. They would go swimming every day like they used to do. Arya would take Jaqen to that beautiful glade she had discovered behind the pines on the other side of the river. They could stay there for hours, reading his strange books, not bothered by anyone. She bit her lip in excitement at the thought Jaqen would see all the trophies she won in Harrenhal tourneys. And she won Harrenhal six years in a row !</p><p>They had a beautiful summer ahead of them !</p><p>Finally, he appeared at their house on Friday night with beautiful roses and a bottle of Dornish red. Arya wanted to run and hug him but something stopped her. He seemed taller than she remembered, more masculine, stronger. For a twenty-four year old he had the air of someone who had seen everything. He complimented<i> lady Stark&rsquo;s</i> hospitality, flashing a disarming smile, drawing sighs of admiration from mum, Sansa and Jeyne. Arya could swear mum blushed !</p><p>Jaqen shook hands with everyone and congratulated dad on the case he won against Tywin Lannister. Dad pulled him into a hug laughing and when he released him Jaqen found Arya. His eyes gleamed like blue steel, he had the most beautiful face of any man she had ever seen. Arya had never felt so small and vulnerable, all her plans vanished, her courage evaporated in a heartbeat.</p><p>This handsome stranger wasn&rsquo;t <i>her Jaqen</i>, the slender boy she used to know, with funny hair and dreamy eyes. Suddenly she realized what dad had been trying to tell her for weeks, that Jaqen was a published author now, an expert in politics of Essos and she shouldn&rsquo;t expect him to climb trees with her. Arya remembered the cover of the magazine Sansa showed her with the picture of Jaqen and queen Daenerys. Suddenly she felt so silly with her fencing trophies ! Suddenly she was very aware that she was a girl and Jaqen was<i> a man</i>.</p><p>Seven hells ! They had a long <i>agonizing</i> summer ahead of them&hellip;</p><p>Arya sighed for the hundredth time this day, recalling Friday dinner during which she didn&rsquo;t say a word. She developed very strange habits lately, sighing and checking her looks in the mirror weren&rsquo;t the worst of them. Reliving that dinner and analyzing every look they shared was.</p><p>She made sure Sandor had enough chicken wings to satisfy his emotional needs and went to the garden, stealing a book from Sansa&rsquo;s room on the way. The letters on the cover assured that <i>Unrequited Love Can Make You Do Incredible Things</i>. Arya decided to broaden her horizons and read books in genres she normally didn&rsquo;t choose. She stepped out into the sun with a solemn desire to climb the weirwood tree and spend the rest of the afternoon exploring the feelings that a certain type of men evoked in a certain type of girls.</p><p>And there he was. Leaning casually against the weirwood tree, looking flawless in his black jeans and tailored black shirt, posing for a selfie with Sansa and Jeyne. Stupid Sansa had a ton of stupid selfies on her Instagram. All tagged with the inspirational quotes from his book ! Arya thought it totally pretentious. Almost as silly as wearing black clothes on the hot summer day. She bit her lip guiltily, she knew the airline lost his luggage and he didn&rsquo;t have much choice. She turned her face away. She couldn&rsquo;t stand looking at her maniacally giggling sister. Jaqen had been in Westeros since Friday and all this time Sansa was all over him !</p><p>'Arya, look !&rsquo; Jeyne squealed like a piglet. 'Arya !&rsquo;</p><p>That&rsquo;s it. She had to apologize and find herself a quiet place where she could read since her favorite spot, her weirwood tree, was occupied by annoying people. She needed to go <i>alone</i> to her beautiful secret glade on the other side of the river and stay there for the rest of the day. Or summer. Arya turned her head to make her excuse and then she saw him taking a photo. Of her.</p><p>She blinked like a deer caught in the headlights.</p><p>'Lovely !&rsquo; She heard his deep voice saying. 'Arya, you look so lovely !&rsquo;</p><p>Arya felt a hot blush spreading over her face as if the sun started shining even brighter, burning her delicate northern skin.

Wherever she went<i> he</i> was there and if he wasn\u2019t, there were always people talking <i>about him</i>. Like her parents in the living room, praising <i>his book</i> or gloomy Sandor in the kitchen. Arya couldn\u2019t decide what was worse, her dad announcing <i>he\u2019s wise beyond his years</i> or Sandor sniffling :</p><p>\u2018I knew the day would come, she\u2019s too good for me !\u2019</p><p>The worst was mum, Arya realized, who cared that the man was <i>dashingly handsome</i> !</p><p>It\u2019s not how it was meant to be.</p>[[MORE]]<p>When they told her Jaqen was coming back to Westeros she jumped with joy. She was ten when she last saw him. He used to be their neighbor and he was <i>her friend</i>. He was sweet, he used to tell her funny stories about dragons and spies. He was patient with her when she needed help with homework. Even though he knew she pretended to need help. And he never mocked her fencing lessons like other boys did. He even sparred with her once and let her win. They both knew he let her win but they chose to pretend he didn\u2019t. Arya liked his long red hair with funny white streaks, his Lorathi accent and his worn jeans. And she liked that funny feeling in her belly when other girls were looking at him whenever they strolled around the town together. She even tolerated his girlfriend. She was older than Jaqen and already studying in Braavos and he never spoke of her anyway.</p><p>Arya made plans for the whole summer for the two of them. They would feed strays and eat apples straight from the tree in her mother\u2019s garden. They would go swimming every day like they used to do. Arya would take Jaqen to that beautiful glade she had discovered behind the pines on the other side of the river. They could stay there for hours, reading his strange books, not bothered by anyone. She bit her lip in excitement at the thought Jaqen would see all the trophies she won in Harrenhal tourneys. And she won Harrenhal six years in a row !</p><p>They had a beautiful summer ahead of them !</p><p>Finally, he appeared at their house on Friday night with beautiful roses and a bottle of Dornish red. Arya wanted to run and hug him but something stopped her. He seemed taller than she remembered, more masculine, stronger. For a twenty-four year old he had the air of someone who had seen everything. He complimented<i> lady Stark\u2019s</i> hospitality, flashing a disarming smile, drawing sighs of admiration from mum, Sansa and Jeyne. Arya could swear mum blushed !</p><p>Jaqen shook hands with everyone and congratulated dad on the case he won against Tywin Lannister. Dad pulled him into a hug laughing and when he released him Jaqen found Arya. His eyes gleamed like blue steel, he had the most beautiful face of any man she had ever seen. Arya had never felt so small and vulnerable, all her plans vanished, her courage evaporated in a heartbeat.</p><p>This handsome stranger wasn\u2019t <i>her Jaqen</i>, the slender boy she used to know, with funny hair and dreamy eyes. Suddenly she realized what dad had been trying to tell her for weeks, that Jaqen was a published author now, an expert in politics of Essos and she shouldn\u2019t expect him to climb trees with her. Arya remembered the cover of the magazine Sansa showed her with the picture of Jaqen and queen Daenerys. Suddenly she felt so silly with her fencing trophies ! Suddenly she was very aware that she was a girl and Jaqen was<i> a man</i>.</p><p>Seven hells ! They had a long <i>agonizing</i> summer ahead of them\u2026</p><p>Arya sighed for the hundredth time this day, recalling Friday dinner during which she didn\u2019t say a word. She developed very strange habits lately, sighing and checking her looks in the mirror weren\u2019t the worst of them. Reliving that dinner and analyzing every look they shared was.</p><p>She made sure Sandor had enough chicken wings to satisfy his emotional needs and went to the garden, stealing a book from Sansa\u2019s room on the way. The letters on the cover assured that <i>Unrequited Love Can Make You Do Incredible Things</i>. Arya decided to broaden her horizons and read books in genres she normally didn\u2019t choose. She stepped out into the sun with a solemn desire to climb the weirwood tree and spend the rest of the afternoon exploring the feelings that a certain type of men evoked in a certain type of girls.</p><p>And there he was. Leaning casually against the weirwood tree, looking flawless in his black jeans and tailored black shirt, posing for a selfie with Sansa and Jeyne. Stupid Sansa had a ton of stupid selfies on her Instagram. All tagged with the inspirational quotes from his book ! Arya thought it totally pretentious. Almost as silly as wearing black clothes on the hot summer day. She bit her lip guiltily, she knew the airline lost his luggage and he didn\u2019t have much choice. She turned her face away.

        "body": "<h1>Burn Us Together</h1><p>Arya Stark realizes that Winterfell no longer feels like home. When Jon Snow sets out at the head of the army to destroy the undead forces of the Night King, Arya decides to go to war too, but at the side of Sandor Clegane. As they renew their unusual friendship, Clegane sees that she is different, and something stronger starts to grow between them.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>A/N: This story started out as an alternate twist on my story, The Squire, in which Arya decides to take up the role of squire to Sandor Clegane when he returns to Winterfell with Jon Snow to face the army of the Night King. I have to confess that at first, a Sandor Clegane / Arya Stark pairing was a hard sell for me. When I looked up the years of their birth, though, I realized that by the time Arya returns to Winterfell, she is right around 17 (b. 289 AC), and Clegane (b. 270 or 271 AC) is around 35. A big age gap to be sure, but absolutely acceptable by medieval standards, and almost acceptable by modern standards. In fact, by Westerosi standards, she is practically an old maid. However you slice it, I think we can all agree that we&rsquo;re talking about two adults at this point.</p><p><br/></p><p>As I started thinking about how that would play out, it started to feel more and more reasonable, and perhaps even less contrived than a Sansa / Sandor pairing. I find it highly unlikely that Arya would consent to a match she didn&rsquo;t want, and no one knows her the way the Hound does. If anyone in Westeros could know her and love her for what she is, he&rsquo;s probably her best bet. If you can get over the big age gap, give me a chance here. I think I can win you over. As always, your comments are deeply appreciated and will be considered as I plot out a follow-up story.</p><p><br/></p><p>Be advised: story includes strong language, a near non-consensual event, sexual content, and an explicit chapter has been removed (originally intended to be placed after chapter 6) for this forum. The whole story will eventually be posted on A03.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><h2>Homecoming</h2><p><br/></p><p>Arya stood on the battlements of Winterfell surveying the tundra that was the North. She had stood there watching for hours, telling herself that it was her brother, the King of the North that she watched. Now that they neared the gate, now that she saw his face, she could deceive herself no longer. The Hound had returned to Winterfell.</p><p><br/></p><p>He eyes skipped over Beric Dondarrion and Gendry and paused. She pressed her lips together. If they had made their peace with one another, so be it. Gendry had chosen, and so had she. She allowed the debt to slide away, another death relinquished to the hands of the Many Faced God. There were other debts to repay, more important, more meaningful, more urgent.</p><p><br/></p><p>Arya turned and descended the narrow stair that would lead her into the courtyard. She concealed herself in the shadows as Jon led his party through the gates. She seriously considered putting on another face, but it would do her little good so long as she was wearing her father&rsquo;s refashioned brigadine and furs.</p><p><br/></p><p>When he dismounted, the Hound found her face immediately, as though he&rsquo;d been searching for it. He stood straighter, and his eyes brightened with recognition. Shouldering his saddle bags, he set his jaw and turned towards her, but was interrupted by a hail from Sansa. When he glanced in her direction, Arya melted back into the shadows. He hesitated, clearly wanting to seek Arya out, but reluctant to ignore the summons of the Lady of Winterfell. He grimaced in annoyance, peering again into the shadows before turning to address Sansa.</p><p><br/></p><p>She knew Sansa would see to it that Clegane would be quartered within the keep rather than at the garrison. It was just as well. There were things that needed saying, and she&rsquo;d not have them said in the courtyard of Winterfell.</p><p><br/></p><p>Before she slipped away into the labyrinth of the keep, Arya noticed her brother turning on the spot, looking for something, even as his men filtered away and his horse had been handed off to a stable lad. Arya smiled sadly, knowing that he was looking for her. How to explain that the sweet Arya he loved was gone, that though she loved him still, she was not who he sought out? The lady was gone, and all that remained was the killer. She sighed. She didn&rsquo;t belong here anymore.</p><p><br/></p><p>Arya strode to the side of the keep where Sansa would have Jon&rsquo;s companions quartered. She stopped two maids in the hall and demanded to know which room would be Clegane&rsquo;s, and they trembled before her. She bade them to bring wine and then to go.</p><p><br/></p><p>At first, it had wounded her that no one seemed to remember the young Stark girl. The bustle and noise of Winterfell was much the same as it had ever been, but now it was subdued. The household swirled around her, but did not include her. They mourned the loss of sweet Rickon and wondered at poor, haunted Bran, and they were all too aware of the horrors that had befallen their beloved Lady Sansa. She, on the other hand, seemed to have been forgotten almost completely. Rumors of her death had taken root for too long for anyone to believe otherwise. Perhaps it was a gift of the Many Faced God, perhaps it was only that too few of her childhood household had survived the Greyjoys and Boltons. Either way, the fact remained that though her footsteps echoed through the halls of Winterfell, Arya Stark was gone. Her place was empty. She was no one. Arya shrugged off her melancholy. It didn&rsquo;t matter. She&rsquo;d not remain here for long.</p><p><br/></p><p>Finding Clegane&rsquo;s quarters at last, she set herself to laying the fire. The chambermaids would have done it, but since they&rsquo;d just been informed that these rooms were to be used, they hadn&rsquo;t yet come. If they didn&rsquo;t come, she knew he&rsquo;d sleep in his mail before he&rsquo;d deign to start a fire for the sake of his own comfort.</p><p><br/></p><p>When the fire had been laid, she pulled a chair into the corner of the room and waited. She&rsquo;d learned many things in the House of Black and White, but nothing more than how to wait, how to fill her mind with nothing so that she could watch and listen and learn properly. The passage of time ceased to have meaning while she waited, and she lived out entire lives within her own mind.</p><p><br/></p><p>It didn&rsquo;t take long for Clegane to arrive. He bolted the door behind him and dropped his saddlebags beside the door. He looked thinner than she remembered, tired and somehow diminished. Perhaps it was only that she was not so small, or that she had lost the fear and hatred of him that had enlarged him in her mind. He approached the table where she&rsquo;d set out the wine and goblet. He took the goblet in his hand and turned it thoughtfully before replacing it on the table.</p><p><br/></p><p>He looked directly into her face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you made it home, girl,&rdquo; his mouth twisted bitterly, &ldquo;even if I couldn&rsquo;t bring you the rest of the way.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Brienne of Tarth should count herself lucky that she does not owe a life to the Many Faced God. And to me.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>Clegane snorted. &ldquo;That bitch has more honor than brains. I doubt it has even crossed her mind.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;You are well?&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Aye, as well as can be expected.&rdquo; He looked up from beneath heavy brows. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re different. You&rsquo;re not a cub anymore, but that&rsquo;s not it really, is it?&rdquo; He narrowed his eyes as he took in her face. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re no lady anymore. You&rsquo;re a real killer now. I can see it in your eyes, in the way you stand and hold yourself. How many men have you sent to your Many Faced God since you left me?&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>She sighed with relief. Finally someone who looked at her and found Arya, not as they expected her to be, but as she was. She gave him the briefest of smiles. &ldquo;The ones that deserved it. Walder Frey, Meryn Trant, others. One that didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Her mouth twisted with regret. &ldquo;The Hound &hellip; but I&rsquo;m glad to see Sandor Clegane survived.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>He nodded, acknowledging the difference. &ldquo;Aye, you might be right. One way or another, you killed the Hound, but I&rsquo;m still here. Come here, girl, I have something for you.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>Arya took a step forward but froze when Clegane unbuckled his belt.</p><p><br/></p><p>He glowered darkly at her. &ldquo;You ought to know me better than that by now.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>She approached, but cautiously. Beside his own blade another had been strapped to his belt, and he removed it and held it out to her.</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;When we went back to King&rsquo;s Landing, I took this from the royal armory in the Red Keep. The Lannister cunts didn&rsquo;t deserve to have it, and I knew if I ever found you again, he&rsquo;d have wanted you to have it.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>Arya took the blade and turned it over in her hands. The hilt was wrapped in red leather with a huge red ruby set between the golden lion&rsquo;s paws that stretched out to form the crossguard. She loosed the blade in the locket, and Valyrian steel slithered out, a faint red glow dancing across the surface, though whether from the low firelight or the blade itself, she couldn&rsquo;t tell.</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve brought me a Lannister blade? Why?&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>Clegane&rsquo;s eyes smoldered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a Lannister blade. It&rsquo;s your father&rsquo;s blade, melted down and reforged into two separate blades. One of the blades is now carried by Brienne of Tarth in defense of House Stark, and this is the other.&rdquo; Darkly, he continued, &ldquo;If you want both, I&rsquo;ll get it for you.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>Arya shook her head slowly. &ldquo;The hand of Brienne of Tarth is the closest Sansa will ever come to wielding my father&rsquo;s sword. Let her have it for now.&rdquo; She glanced up at Clegane. &ldquo;How many men did you have to kill to get me this blade?&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Does it matter?&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;No. It does not.&rdquo; She glanced up at Clegane. &ldquo;For this, for the many times you bled for me, I will be forever in your debt.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>Before he could stop her or protest, Arya closed the space between them and wrapped her arms tightly around Clegane. She was surprised how close they were in height now, her head fitting neatly beneath his chin, and her arms were now long enough now to wrap them around him completely. She was still more surprised when his arms reluctantly closed around her. She remembered now his scent, the warmth that he exuded, the feel of his mail and gorget against her face. She remembered the strength of his arms around her as he bore her away from the Red Wedding beneath a Frey banner, and waking within them, knowing that it was the only place in the world where she was safe.</p><p><br/></p><p>He patted her back awkwardly. &ldquo;Joffrey named it Widow&rsquo;s Wail.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>Arya snorted and released Clegane. &ldquo;Only cunts name their swords.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>He grinned crookedly back. &ldquo;Aye, lots of cunts. It&rsquo;s yours, now, my lady. What will you call it?&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo; Arya smiled sadly at him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not Lady Arya anymore. I&rsquo;m only Arya, or no one at all &hellip; but I think you know that already.

She laid a gentle kiss against the puckered flesh of his ruined face and released him. &ldquo;Thank you for bringing it home, Sandor. I won&rsquo;t forget.

            "comment": "<p><h1>Burn Us Together</h1><p>Arya Stark realizes that Winterfell no longer feels like home. When Jon Snow sets out at the head of the army to destroy the undead forces of the Night King, Arya decides to go to war too, but at the side of Sandor Clegane. As they renew their unusual friendship, Clegane sees that she is different, and something stronger starts to grow between them.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>A/N: This story started out as an alternate twist on my story, The Squire, in which Arya decides to take up the role of squire to Sandor Clegane when he returns to Winterfell with Jon Snow to face the army of the Night King. I have to confess that at first, a Sandor Clegane / Arya Stark pairing was a hard sell for me. When I looked up the years of their birth, though, I realized that by the time Arya returns to Winterfell, she is right around 17 (b. 289 AC), and Clegane (b. 270 or 271 AC) is around 35. A big age gap to be sure, but absolutely acceptable by medieval standards, and almost acceptable by modern standards. In fact, by Westerosi standards, she is practically an old maid. However you slice it, I think we can all agree that we\u2019re talking about two adults at this point.</p><p><br></p><p>As I started thinking about how that would play out, it started to feel more and more reasonable, and perhaps even less contrived than a Sansa / Sandor pairing. I find it highly unlikely that Arya would consent to a match she didn\u2019t want, and no one knows her the way the Hound does. If anyone in Westeros could know her and love her for what she is, he\u2019s probably her best bet. If you can get over the big age gap, give me a chance here. I think I can win you over. As always, your comments are deeply appreciated and will be considered as I plot out a follow-up story.</p><p><br></p><p>Be advised: story includes strong language, a near non-consensual event, sexual content, and an explicit chapter has been removed (originally intended to be placed after chapter 6) for this forum. The whole story will eventually be posted on A03.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>Homecoming</h2><p><br></p><p>Arya stood on the battlements of Winterfell surveying the tundra that was the North. She had stood there watching for hours, telling herself that it was her brother, the King of the North that she watched. Now that they neared the gate, now that she saw his face, she could deceive herself no longer. The Hound had returned to Winterfell.</p><p><br></p><p>He eyes skipped over Beric Dondarrion and Gendry and paused. She pressed her lips together. If they had made their peace with one another, so be it. Gendry had chosen, and so had she. She allowed the debt to slide away, another death relinquished to the hands of the Many Faced God. There were other debts to repay, more important, more meaningful, more urgent.</p><p><br></p><p>Arya turned and descended the narrow stair that would lead her into the courtyard. She concealed herself in the shadows as Jon led his party through the gates. She seriously considered putting on another face, but it would do her little good so long as she was wearing her father\u2019s refashioned brigadine and furs.</p><p><br></p><p>When he dismounted, the Hound found her face immediately, as though he\u2019d been searching for it. He stood straighter, and his eyes brightened with recognition. Shouldering his saddle bags, he set his jaw and turned towards her, but was interrupted by a hail from Sansa. When he glanced in her direction, Arya melted back into the shadows. He hesitated, clearly wanting to seek Arya out, but reluctant to ignore the summons of the Lady of Winterfell. He grimaced in annoyance, peering again into the shadows before turning to address Sansa.</p><p><br></p><p>She knew Sansa would see to it that Clegane would be quartered within the keep rather than at the garrison. It was just as well. There were things that needed saying, and she\u2019d not have them said in the courtyard of Winterfell.</p><p><br></p><p>Before she slipped away into the labyrinth of the keep, Arya noticed her brother turning on the spot, looking for something, even as his men filtered away and his horse had been handed off to a stable lad. Arya smiled sadly, knowing that he was looking for her. How to explain that the sweet Arya he loved was gone, that though she loved him still, she was not who he sought out? The lady was gone, and all that remained was the killer. She sighed. She didn\u2019t belong here anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>Arya strode to the side of the keep where Sansa would have Jon\u2019s companions quartered. She stopped two maids in the hall and demanded to know which room would be Clegane\u2019s, and they trembled before her. She bade them to bring wine and then to go.</p><p><br></p><p>At first, it had wounded her that no one seemed to remember the young Stark girl.

He grimaced in annoyance, peering again into the shadows before turning to address Sansa.</p><p><br></p><p>She knew Sansa would see to it that Clegane would be quartered within the keep rather than at the garrison. It was just as well. There were things that needed saying, and she\u2019d not have them said in the courtyard of Winterfell.</p><p><br></p><p>Before she slipped away into the labyrinth of the keep, Arya noticed her brother turning on the spot, looking for something, even as his men filtered away and his horse had been handed off to a stable lad. Arya smiled sadly, knowing that he was looking for her. How to explain that the sweet Arya he loved was gone, that though she loved him still, she was not who he sought out? The lady was gone, and all that remained was the killer. She sighed. She didn\u2019t belong here anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>Arya strode to the side of the keep where Sansa would have Jon\u2019s companions quartered. She stopped two maids in the hall and demanded to know which room would be Clegane\u2019s, and they trembled before her. She bade them to bring wine and then to go.</p><p><br></p><p>At first, it had wounded her that no one seemed to remember the young Stark girl. The bustle and noise of Winterfell was much the same as it had ever been, but now it was subdued. The household swirled around her, but did not include her. They mourned the loss of sweet Rickon and wondered at poor, haunted Bran, and they were all too aware of the horrors that had befallen their beloved Lady Sansa. She, on the other hand, seemed to have been forgotten almost completely. Rumors of her death had taken root for too long for anyone to believe otherwise. Perhaps it was a gift of the Many Faced God, perhaps it was only that too few of her childhood household had survived the Greyjoys and Boltons. Either way, the fact remained that though her footsteps echoed through the halls of Winterfell, Arya Stark was gone. Her place was empty. She was no one. Arya shrugged off her melancholy. It didn\u2019t matter. She\u2019d not remain here for long.</p><p><br></p><p>Finding Clegane\u2019s quarters at last, she set herself to laying the fire. The chambermaids would have done it, but since they\u2019d just been informed that these rooms were to be used, they hadn\u2019t yet come. If they didn\u2019t come, she knew he\u2019d sleep in his mail before he\u2019d deign to start a fire for the sake of his own comfort.</p><p><br></p><p>When the fire had been laid, she pulled a chair into the corner of the room and waited. She\u2019d learned many things in the House of Black and White, but nothing more than how to wait, how to fill her mind with nothing so that she could watch and listen and learn properly. The passage of time ceased to have meaning while she waited, and she lived out entire lives within her own mind.</p><p><br></p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for Clegane to arrive. He bolted the door behind him and dropped his saddlebags beside the door. He looked thinner than she remembered, tired and somehow diminished. Perhaps it was only that she was not so small, or that she had lost the fear and hatred of him that had enlarged him in her mind. He approached the table where she\u2019d set out the wine and goblet. He took the goblet in his hand and turned it thoughtfully before replacing it on the table.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked directly into her face. \u201cI\u2019m glad you made it home, girl,\u201d his mouth twisted bitterly, \u201ceven if I couldn\u2019t bring you the rest of the way.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBrienne of Tarth should count herself lucky that she does not owe a life to the Many Faced God. And to me.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Clegane snorted. \u201cThat bitch has more honor than brains. I doubt it has even crossed her mind.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou are well?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAye, as well as can be expected.\u201d He looked up from beneath heavy brows. \u201cYou\u2019re different. You\u2019re not a cub anymore, but that\u2019s not it really, is it?\u201d He narrowed his eyes as he took in her face. \u201cYou\u2019re no lady anymore. You\u2019re a real killer now. I can see it in your eyes, in the way you stand and hold yourself. How many men have you sent to your Many Faced God since you left me?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>She sighed with relief. Finally someone who looked at her and found Arya, not as they expected her to be, but as she was. She gave him the briefest of smiles. \u201cThe ones that deserved it. Walder Frey, Meryn Trant, others. One that didn\u2019t.\u201d Her mouth twisted with regret. \u201cThe Hound \u2026 but I\u2019m glad to see Sandor Clegane survived.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded, acknowledging the difference. \u201cAye, you might be right. One way or another, you killed the Hound, but I\u2019m still here. Come here, girl, I have something for you.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Arya took a step forward but froze when Clegane unbuckled his belt.</p><p><br></p><p>He glowered darkly at her. \u201cYou ought to know me better than that by now.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>She approached, but cautiously. Beside his own blade another had been strapped to his belt, and he removed it and held it out to her.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhen we went back to King\u2019s Landing, I took this from the royal armory in the Red Keep. The Lannister cunts didn\u2019t deserve to have it, and I knew if I ever found you again, he\u2019d have wanted you to have it.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Arya took the blade and turned it over in her hands. The hilt was wrapped in red leather with a huge red ruby set between the golden lion\u2019s paws that stretched out to form the crossguard. She loosed the blade in the locket, and Valyrian steel slithered out, a faint red glow dancing across the surface, though whether from the low firelight or the blade itself, she couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve brought me a Lannister blade? Why?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Clegane\u2019s eyes smoldered. \u201cIt\u2019s not a Lannister blade. It\u2019s your father\u2019s blade, melted down and reforged into two separate blades. One of the blades is now carried by Brienne of Tarth in defense of House Stark, and this is the other.\u201d Darkly, he continued, \u201cIf you want both, I\u2019ll get it for you.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Arya shook her head slowly. \u201cThe hand of Brienne of Tarth is the closest Sansa will ever come to wielding my father\u2019s sword. Let her have it for now.\u201d She glanced up at Clegane. \u201cHow many men did you have to kill to get me this blade?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNo. It does not.\u201d She glanced up at Clegane. \u201cFor this, for the many times you bled for me, I will be forever in your debt.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Before he could stop her or protest, Arya closed the space between them and wrapped her arms tightly around Clegane. She was surprised how close they were in height now, her head fitting neatly beneath his chin, and her arms were now long enough now to wrap them around him completely. She was still more surprised when his arms reluctantly closed around her. She remembered now his scent, the warmth that he exuded, the feel of his mail and gorget against her face. She remembered the strength of his arms around her as he bore her away from the Red Wedding beneath a Frey banner, and waking within them, knowing that it was the only place in the world where she was safe.</p><p><br></p><p>He patted her back awkwardly. \u201cJoffrey named it Widow\u2019s Wail.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Arya snorted and released Clegane. \u201cOnly cunts name their swords.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>He grinned crookedly back. \u201cAye, lots of cunts. It\u2019s yours, now, my lady. What will you call it?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d Arya smiled sadly at him. \u201cI\u2019m not Lady Arya anymore. I\u2019m only Arya, or no one at all \u2026 but I think you know that already. I don\u2019t need a title, and neither does my blade.\u201d Impulsively, she grabbed hold of the strap of his gorget and pulled him down to her. She laid a gentle kiss against the puckered flesh of his ruined face and released him. \u201cThank you for bringing it home, Sandor. I won\u2019t forget. Not ever.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Arya turned and fled the room before he could see her eyes fill and overflow, the blade clutched to her heart.</p><p><br></p><p>Read the rest at: <a href=\"https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13019889/1/Burn-Us-Together\">https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13019889/1/Burn-Us-Together</a></p><p><br></p><p>Be sure to log in to leave comments\u2013they are truly my payoff!</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>Burn Us Together</h1><p>Arya Stark realizes that Winterfell no longer feels like home. When Jon Snow sets out at the head of the army to destroy the undead forces of the Night King, Arya decides to go to war too, but at the side of Sandor Clegane. As they renew their unusual friendship, Clegane sees that she is different, and something stronger starts to grow between them.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>A/N: This story started out as an alternate twist on my story, The Squire, in which Arya decides to take up the role of squire to Sandor Clegane when he returns to Winterfell with Jon Snow to face the army of the Night King. I have to confess that at first, a Sandor Clegane / Arya Stark pairing was a hard sell for me. When I looked up the years of their birth, though, I realized that by the time Arya returns to Winterfell, she is right around 17 (b. 289 AC), and Clegane (b. 270 or 271 AC) is around 35. A big age gap to be sure, but absolutely acceptable by medieval standards, and almost acceptable by modern standards. In fact, by Westerosi standards, she is practically an old maid. However you slice it, I think we can all agree that we&rsquo;re talking about two adults at this point.</p><p><br /></p><p>As I started thinking about how that would play out, it started to feel more and more reasonable, and perhaps even less contrived than a Sansa / Sandor pairing. I find it highly unlikely that Arya would consent to a match she didn&rsquo;t want, and no one knows her the way the Hound does. If anyone in Westeros could know her and love her for what she is, he&rsquo;s probably her best bet. If you can get over the big age gap, give me a chance here. I think I can win you over. As always, your comments are deeply appreciated and will be considered as I plot out a follow-up story.</p><p><br /></p><p>Be advised: story includes strong language, a near non-consensual event, sexual content, and an explicit chapter has been removed (originally intended to be placed after chapter 6) for this forum. The whole story will eventually be posted on A03.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h2>Homecoming</h2><p><br /></p><p>Arya stood on the battlements of Winterfell surveying the tundra that was the North. She had stood there watching for hours, telling herself that it was her brother, the King of the North that she watched. Now that they neared the gate, now that she saw his face, she could deceive herself no longer. The Hound had returned to Winterfell.</p><p><br /></p><p>He eyes skipped over Beric Dondarrion and Gendry and paused. She pressed her lips together. If they had made their peace with one another, so be it. Gendry had chosen, and so had she. She allowed the debt to slide away, another death relinquished to the hands of the Many Faced God. There were other debts to repay, more important, more meaningful, more urgent.</p><p><br /></p><p>Arya turned and descended the narrow stair that would lead her into the courtyard. She concealed herself in the shadows as Jon led his party through the gates. She seriously considered putting on another face, but it would do her little good so long as she was wearing her father&rsquo;s refashioned brigadine and furs.</p><p><br /></p><p>When he dismounted, the Hound found her face immediately, as though he&rsquo;d been searching for it. He stood straighter, and his eyes brightened with recognition. Shouldering his saddle bags, he set his jaw and turned towards her, but was interrupted by a hail from Sansa. When he glanced in her direction, Arya melted back into the shadows. He hesitated, clearly wanting to seek Arya out, but reluctant to ignore the summons of the Lady of Winterfell.
