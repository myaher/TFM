Harper was staying in Jared\u2019s apartment, as she said she would, but they went out every day. Sometimes Chris would spend the night with her, other\u2019s she would go to his apartment. Sebastian was promoting his new movie in LA so Harper was going to the gym alone. One day Emmy was there and she went to talk to Harper while on the treadmill, she was very friendly and Harper told her the things being said on the internet was all bullshit. Emmy just waves it off, saying she was dating a businessman. Well, Harper was just happy not to have more drama about this.</p><p>She and Chris would always do something after work, but he didn\u2019t want to go out, so it was always a movie, dinner and some game or playing music together. He\u2019s really great with music! The woman would always try to do some little things for him, like leaving some notes hidden when she left his house or make some pudding he really wanted to prove, send him pics during the day and have hard and fast sex at night.</p><p>She imagined the second week would be the same, but then his mother went to NY and on the first night he told Harper he would be out with Lisa to some Broadway show. She was okay, even thinking he would invite her over, but eventually, she convinced herself he was looking for a better occasion to introduce them. It never came. The next two days he didn\u2019t call or text her at all. Imagine her surprise when she was organizing her things to go out of the studio and Lisa enters the place. Chris had shown her pictures so she knew this is his mother.</p><p>\u201cHey, you must be Harper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. Hey Lisa, is everything okay? Is Chris okay?\u201d she gets worried about him, thinking maybe something happened.</p><p>\u201cYes, darling. He\u2019s okay. I wanted to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he outside? Parking?\u201d She was so confused her brain was just trying to put things together.</p><p>\u201cNo, no&hellip;he\u2019s in a meeting. Do you think we can have a coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sure! Do you mind if we have it at the place around the corner? I need to wait for the owner to give him the keys before I can leave\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>Harper finish getting her things and closing the place and they go to the little dinner around the studio. When the waiter comes with their drinks, Harper finally starts functioning again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was so surprised when you entered the studio I didn\u2019t even know what to say. Is a pleasure to meet you, Lisa, even though I\u2019m still a bit taken aback.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs nice to meet you too, Harper. You look like a very down to earth person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m here, I\u2019m going back to Boston today but he told me we should meet next time&hellip;I usually don\u2019t cross this kind of line, you see? I would let him introduce you to me in his own time, but I\u2019m a bit worried, Harper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout me? I\u2019m not following\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris talks to me about his life, about everything, things had always been this way. But for some reason, he stopped talking about you and he\u2019s acting very skittish about it. I\u2019m not trying to pry into your relationship but we were having dinner with his friends yesterday and they\u2019re worried about you both as a couple, so I wanted to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Now things are making more sense. \u201cOh&hellip;was Adam there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s one of the people who are worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLisa, I know you don\u2019t know me and they\u2019re very close to you as well, as Chris had told me before, but there\u2019s not much I can say to calm your mind besides that I like him a lot. We\u2019re still getting to know each other and this caused some disagreements, but we\u2019re good now. To be honest I was truly expecting to meet you when he told me you were here. I don\u2019t know if he changed his mind about us, cause he hasn\u2019t talked to me this last couple of days&hellip;I\u2019m frustrated right now knowing the reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looks sad and irritated, darling. I\u2019m sure you understand this is not what a mother wants for her son\u2019s relationship. He had struggled with depression before so I\u2019m just trying not to let him go into this path\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t&hellip;we were fine and&hellip;I don\u2019t want him to be sad either\u2026I don\u2019t know what to say, I don\u2019t think I can say anything else without talking to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you mind not telling him I came here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I would. I\u2019m sorry, Lisa, I can\u2019t lie to him.\u201d</p><p>Lisa smiles. \u201cFor some reason, that answer got me a bit less worried. Can you come with me to his apartment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>They stayed at the dinner for some minutes more till the studio&rsquo;s owner got there and went to Chris\u2019 apartment after.

Chris is angry about his mother going to Harper\u2019s work and talking about him as if he\u2019s a kid who needs his mother protection from bad girls.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s okay, Ma. What get\u2019s me irritated and sad is that without any real motive they\u2019re not okay with me and Harper even her being such a nice person. The only reason I didn\u2019t want to introduce you right now is cause she asked me to go slower and I didn\u2019t want to pressure her. I\u2019m sorry, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want you to feel bad because of me, Chris. I want to know if this is what&rsquo;s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. Everything\u2019s okay. Come here, let me introduce you to my mother.\u201d she stands from the chair and walks around the center table to hold the hand he stretched on her direction.

We\u2019re still getting to know each other and this caused some disagreements, but we\u2019re good now. To be honest I was truly expecting to meet you when he told me you were here. I don\u2019t know if he changed his mind about us, cause he hasn\u2019t talked to me this last couple of days\u2026I\u2019m frustrated right now knowing the reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looks sad and irritated, darling.

What get\u2019s me irritated and sad is that without any real motive they\u2019re not okay with me and Harper even her being such a nice person.

The three of you had spent the evening at your in-laws, and the\nloud evening had taken a toll on your energy.\nYou hoped your daughter would feel the same. Chris nodded, then sat against the\nheadboard, letting one of his arms fall on her pillow.</p><p>\u201cOnce upon a time, in a small village, lived the most\nbeautiful princess the kingdom had ever seen. Neither her mother, nor her\nfather, lived in the castle, and none of them was\npart of the King\u2019s family. But the village\u2019s elders loved her so much, that\nthey all believed she should be a princess. The princess was very kind, and she\nwould always share the few riches she had with those that had none. She was brilliant, too. She was always reading the biggest\nbooks, with lots of words that few could understand. </p><p>But the princess was lonely, as the girls in the village\nwere jealous of her beauty and intelligence, and the boys in the village were too blind to see what a beautiful\nheart she had. So the princess left the village\nto go near the castle, where more people lived, in the hopes of finding friends\nto talk with. </p><p>Near the castle lived the goofy prince. The goofy prince\ndidn\u2019t like to be serious, and he would\nalways try to make people around him laugh. He felt lonely, too, because he\nwould always worry too much about\neverything. His worries stopped him from ever finding the right princess for\nhim, and that worried him more.</p><p>So when the prince met the beautiful princess, he started worrying again. He worried because he thought he wasn\u2019t smart enough for the princess.\nHe thought he was to busy for the princess\nbecause you see, such a precious princess needed all her prince\u2019s attention. And he looked at all the princes around him,\nand he believed that the princess would be happier with them.</p><p>But the princess did not care. She kept talking to the prince, and when he doubted himself when the worries came back, she pushed\nthem away. And she made the prince so happy, that he decided to ask the\nprincess\u2019 hand. And to the prince\u2019s surprise, she said yes.</p><p>They got married the princess\u2019 village, and all the elders\nwelcomed the prince with all the kindness that could ever be. And seeing how\nhappy the princess was, the prince decided to build the princess a small castle\nto live him. She didn\u2019t want a kingdom, not even the biggest castle the prince\ncould offer. She only wanted a place to put all her big books in, with a few\nrooms for the elders to stay in if they ever needed a place to stay in.

Neither her mother, nor her\nfather, lived in the castle, and none of them was\npart of the King\u2019s family. But the village\u2019s elders loved her so much, that\nthey all believed she should be a princess. The princess was very kind, and she\nwould always share the few riches she had with those that had none. She was brilliant, too. She was always reading the biggest\nbooks, with lots of words that few could understand. </p><p>But the princess was lonely, as the girls in the village\nwere jealous of her beauty and intelligence, and the boys in the village were too blind to see what a beautiful\nheart she had. So the princess left the village\nto go near the castle, where more people lived, in the hopes of finding friends\nto talk with. </p><p>Near the castle lived the goofy prince. The goofy prince\ndidn\u2019t like to be serious, and he would\nalways try to make people around him laugh. He felt lonely, too, because he\nwould always worry too much about\neverything.
