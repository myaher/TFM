He\u2019d debated going to his safe place under the Quidditch stadium, but remembered that there was a match that weekend, which spoiled those plans. So, the Room of Requirement it was. He was lucky he knew how to work it so well, if anyone had been looking for him, they wouldn\u2019t be able to get in. </p><p>His phone had died shortly after he\u2019d stumbled in here, drained after hours of fruitless research on bipolar disorder. He hadn\u2019t bothered to charge it since then, knowing that there would be numerous calls, messages, and Instagram posts waiting for him. All he wanted to do was lie there and stare at the ceiling, forgetting that the person he\u2019d thought he\u2019d spend the rest of his life with didn\u2019t actually love him. The things Lucille had said hadn\u2019t totally matched up to what he\u2019d read online, but he figured that she was probably more trustworthy than the internet, especially given how long she\u2019d known Eliott. </p><p>He groaned and covered his eyes with his hands, rubbing them as if that would make everything hurt less. Everything had been perfect, and now it was all wrecked. He should have known better, known things weren\u2019t going to last. Nothing in life came easily, and it was most often taken away before there was even a chance to enjoy it, at least in his experience. </p><p>He could bemoan his troubles all he wanted, but they really were minute compared to what Eliott must have been going through. It took a lot of his willpower to not go and demand to see him, knowing that wasn\u2019t going to help anything but wishing it would. Maybe Eliott didn\u2019t love him, but he loved Eliott so much he could feel it every time he pressed his hands to where his heart sat beneath his skin. Above all, he wanted Eliott to be ok, and that was what hurt most of all. </p><!-- more --><p>If only it was as easy to let go as it was to fall in love in the first place. </p><p>The sheets on the bed still smelled like Eliott, though Lucas assumed that was partly due to the room working its magic, reflecting his desires. It didn\u2019t matter the cause, Lucas buried his face in them regardless, imagining they were in a universe that Eliott had trusted him with this part of himself, that he hadn\u2019t felt like he\u2019d had to hide. </p><p>That was what bothered Lucas most of all about everything. He didn\u2019t care that Eliott was bipolar, not really. Being bipolar didn\u2019t mean that he couldn\u2019t love Lucas, as he\u2019d originally thought when Lucille had spoken to him. Lucille hadn\u2019t said that, she\u2019d said \u2018Didn\u2019t he tell you why he\u2019d been expelled\u2019? and it had cut deeper than any knife. Eliott didn\u2019t not love him because he wasn\u2019t capable, he didn\u2019t love him because he felt like he couldn\u2019t trust him. Lucas had trusted Eliott with every part of him, even the parts he readily hid from everyone else, but Eliott hadn\u2019t felt that he could do the same. </p><p>He wondered if Eliott was still in the hospital wing, if they knew how to treat him properly. He supposed it was a good thing that Lucille was there that weekend, if she knew about his illness. Did Idriss and Sofiane know about it? Maybe they didn\u2019t, it could explain why Eliott was so adamant that they weren\u2019t friends when all evidence suggested otherwise. Idriss and Sofiane wouldn\u2019t have went out of their way for Lucas if they hadn\u2019t cared deeply for Eliott. </p><p>If their situations were reversed, would he have told Eliott? He\u2019d been trying to put himself into Eliott\u2019s shoes to no avail. <i>Of course</i>, his head told him, <i>of course you would have told him</i>, but he didn\u2019t know if it was true or just wishful thinking. </p><p>\u201cLucas Lallemant!\u201d an angry voice yelled out of nowhere and Lucas shot up in bed, eyes wide and hair tangled. Imane stood at the foot of his bed, arms crossed. Behind her were Idriss and Sofiane, looking a tad bit more hesitant, like they weren\u2019t sure if they should be there or not. Come to think of it\u2026 how were they in there? He\u2019d been very specific with his instructions for the room.</p><p>\u201cHow did you\u2026?\u201d he asked blearily, blinking away tears he hadn\u2019t realized were close to falling from his eyes. Imane rolled her eyes and sat on the edge of the bed. </p><p>\u201cPlease, did you really think I wouldn\u2019t figure out how to get in?\u201d</p><p>Fair enough. He should have known better than to underestimate Imane. \u201cBut why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m supposed to let you hide away in here, avoiding the world forever? What kind of friend would I be if I did that?\u201d Her voice was so stern that he almost didn\u2019t realize what she\u2019d said.</p><p>His face split into a hesitant grin. \u201cOh, we\u2019re friends, are we?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes softened at his smile, even as she leaned over and hit the side of his head. \u201cHey!\u201d he exclaimed, bringing his hands up to defend himself if need be. </p><p>\u201cOf course we\u2019re friends you dumbass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me if you\u2019re sending some mixed signals,\u201d he said rubbing the side of his head. Sofiane smirked softly behind her, bringing Lucas\u2019 attention back to them, why they were there. </p><p>He dropped his eyes to the sheets in front of him, a tad embarrassed for what they\u2019d had to deal with. \u201cThank you guys, for the other night. I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I was\u2026 I don\u2019t even know. But thank you,\u201d he brought his eyes up to meet Idriss\u2019, then Sofiane\u2019s, \u201cSeriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d Sofiane said with his megawatt smile. Now that the situation was a tad less dire, Lucas found himself taking in every inch of Sofiane\u2019s appearance. He had nothing on Eliott, of course, but still, he was quite the view. Idriss wasn\u2019t so bad himself, but he knew Imane would kill him if he ever said anything, so he stayed quiet. </p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Eliott?\u201d he asked softly, noticing how Sofiane\u2019s smile dimmed slightly. He sat on the bed beside Imane and Lucas saw her body language shift with him so close to her. If the circumstances were different, he might have inquired about it. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not great,\u201d Sofiane said candidly, \u201cLucille\u2019s the only person he lets see him, but from what she\u2019s told us, he\u2019s coming down, regretting things.\u201d</p><p>Lucas felt his heart clench painfully at the mention of Lucille. Had Eliott lied to him about her too? Was she more important in his life than he\u2019d insinuated? As if anticipating his question, Sofiane continued, \u201cLucille and Eliott are like siblings. They love like them, fight like them. None of us have ever been able to touch their relationship, and we didn\u2019t want to. What they have with each other is special, but it\u2019s nothing like what I\u2019m sure you two have with each other, ok? Manon\u2019s your sister, right? Lucille being with Eliott would be like Manon being with you.\u201d</p><p>There was a lot of information that Lucas was trying to take in, so he couldn\u2019t mumble anything other than, \u201cBut I\u2019m gay?\u201d</p><p>Needless to say, Imane hit him again, but this time she was smiling and she sank onto the pillow beside him. Sofiane reached up to scratch his head before looking at Lucas earnestly. \u201cWe had no idea that you didn\u2019t know he was bipolar. I assume that\u2019s why you ran off after you talked to Lucille?\u201d</p><p>Lucas nodded. Sofiane grimaced. \u201cWe love Lucille, we do, but she can be a bit\u2026 direct at times.\u201d</p><p>Idriss snorted from where he was leaning against one of the walls. \u201cUnderstatement of the century.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegardless,\u201d Sofiane shot Idriss an unamused glance before returning his attention to Lucas, \u201cWe know firsthand how it can be\u2026 a lot to take in at first. But it doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s less of a person than you thought he was.\u201d</p><p>Lucas shook his head immediately. \u201cI didn\u2019t walk away because she said he was bipolar. I don\u2019t care about that. My&ndash; my birth mother, she was schizophrenic, and I feel guilty every day that I wasn\u2019t able to be there for her, that I didn\u2019t know what was going on until it was too late. I know that Eliott is still Eliott, no matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you hiding?\u201d Imane asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause he doesn\u2019t love me, and I don\u2019t know how to go about my life trying to stop loving him.\u201d</p><p>Idriss folded his arms over his chest. \u201cYou think because he\u2019s bipolar he can\u2019t love you? Trust me, that\u2019s not the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I&ndash;\u201d Lucas began, interrupted by Sofiane. </p><p>\u201cHe feels more than any of us, loves harder than we could even begin to comprehend. I wouldn\u2019t count him out just yet.\u201d</p><p>Lucas cut back in, trying to explain himself. \u201cI know that. Well, I guess I didn\u2019t totally know <i>that</i>, but I knew he was capable of love. Of course he is. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve seen him fall in love with a flower, with a door handle. I trusted him with my entire life, tragic backstory and all, but I never would have even known the two of you existed if I wasn\u2019t friends with Imane. How can he say he loves me, and how can I believe him, if he doesn\u2019t trust me at all?\u201d</p><p>Sofiane and Idriss exchanged a glance with one another. He hadn\u2019t meant to completely unload everything onto them, but it had felt too good to stop. The fact that they weren\u2019t saying anything told him that he wasn\u2019t completely off base either. Sofiane and Idriss seemed to come to some sort of silent understanding, Sofiane speaking at last. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Lucas\u2019 voice broke at the end of the word, shattering with the last bit of his heart. Imane snapped her head in his direction. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell you why he was expelled?\u201d she asked. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he repeated, just as broken. </p><p>\u201cI feel like it\u2019s Eliott\u2019s prerogative to tell you or not to tell you, but\u2026\u201d Sofiane trailed off, standing up from the bed, pacing. \u201cI also feel like you have a right to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lucas repeated one more time, but this time he was resigned to it. \u201cIt\u2019s his story to tell. If I never know\u2026 then I never know. I\u2019m not entitled to anything.\u201d</p><p>Sofiane glanced at Idriss. \u201cWell, the thing is\u2026 it\u2019s kind of our story to tell as well. Idriss\u2019, at the very least. If we tell you, it might help you to be there for him in the way that we weren\u2019t. It haunts us every day too, you know. \u201d</p><p>Lucas looked up sharply first at Idriss, then at Imane, who nodded. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d he asked her. She shrugged. \u201cLike you said, it isn\u2019t my story to tell. Plus, I assumed he\u2019d told you, especially after the mural.\u201d</p><p>He stared at his hands in his lap for a moment. Of course he would have preferred if Eliott told him these things, but at this rate he didn\u2019t know if Eliott would ever talk to him again, and maybe hearing Idriss\u2019 story could help him figure out what to do next. \u201cOk,\u201d he said, \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to tell me, I\u2019m willing to listen.\u201d</p><p>Idriss took a breath in and out, glancing at his sister, then Sofiane, before beginning, \u201cI\u2019m assuming he didn\u2019t tell you this, but at Beauxbatons we were best friends. Him, me, Sofiane, and two other guys who we don\u2019t really talk to anymore. They treated Eliott different after he was diagnosed and even more so after everything else that happened. A lot of people at school were like that, actually.\u201d</p><p>Lucas thought back to some comments he and Eliott had received on their Instagram posts occasionally, but especially following their time painting the mural. Eliott had brushed them off at the time, and Lucas hadn\u2019t thought too much about it, but maybe it was somewhat relevant to what Idriss was telling him. </p><p>\u201cWizards don\u2019t understand mental illness,\u201d Idriss continued, and Lucas nodded grimly. He knew firsthand just how much wizards didn\u2019t understand mental illness. \u201cHe wanted to keep it a secret, only the five of us and Lucille knew, other than his parents, obviously. Honestly, he probably only told us about it because his therapist had told him to tell <i>someone</i>, and it\u2019s not like we wouldn\u2019t have noticed if he was depressed or manic over time, especially living in the same room. He was diagnosed when we were fifteen, the summer before fifth year. Apparently he\u2019d had a pretty bad manic episode over the summer holidays that led to his diagnosis, according to Lucille. She was the only one he saw that whole summer. When he came back to school, everything was chill. He told us about his diagnosis a few months in, and we were all there for him. Sofiane and I are muggle born as well, so we sort of knew about mental illnesses, but Henri and Marc were mostly clueless&ndash; Henri and Marc were our other friends, by the way&ndash;\u201d</p><p>It had to be the two Lucas had seen on Instagram. Henririen and theoneandonly. He should have blocked them. </p><p>\u201c&ndash;because they\u2019d grown up in predominantly wizarding families. They were supportive at first, especially because Eliott seemed the same as always. Then, about a quarter through fifth year, he had a major depressive episode. He wouldn\u2019t eat, get out of bed, talk to us, anything, no matter what we tried. He came out of it after about a month, and it slowly got better and better over the course of a few more months, but somehow the dynamic between us all had shifted. Henri and Marc were distant, would make snide comments here and there because they just didn\u2019t understand. Lucille was with him all the time because she insisted that she was the only one who could really understand him. That kind of pissed off Sof and I, but we let it slide because Eliott\u2019s well-being was more important than our pride.\u201d</p><p>How had Eliott ever let friends like these go? What the hell had happened? </p><p>\u201cListen, Lucas, when I tell you the rest, I promise you that it was all way in the past, ok? Nothing lingering from back then. No\u2026 feelings of any kind.\u201d Idriss was nearly pleading, which worried Lucas, but he wanted to know the rest so he just said he understood and nodded for Idriss to continue. </p><p>\u201cOk,\u201d Idriss nodded, \u201cWell, after fifth year, everything turned out ok. We spent time together over the holidays, Henri and Marc weren\u2019t around as much, but that just allowed the three of us to become closer which was a good thing, at first. Once sixth year started, I could sort of sense a shift, though I just thought it was because of Henri and Marc. It started to become apparent to me midway through the year that it wasn\u2019t about Henri and Marc, it was about Eliott and me. He\u2019d\u2026 developed feelings for me. I thought if I ignored it, or gave him subtle hints that it was never going to happen, that it would go away, and for a time I thought it did. But then he kissed me, out of the blue one day when he\u2019d invited me alone to help him study. I&ndash; I didn\u2019t handle things well. I don\u2019t even remember what I said, but I pushed him away from me and left him there, alone. I felt bad about it after, of course I did, there were so many better ways to handle it, so I decided next time I saw him I would apologize.</p><p>\u201cOnly, he didn\u2019t come back to our room that night or the next, didn\u2019t come to classes either. Sofiane and I got worried that maybe he was depressed again, but then all of a sudden he showed up again, looking and acting like nothing had happened. He was smiling a lot, talking about how every day was the best of his life and we knew that he wasn\u2019t sleeping at night. None of us had ever seen him manic before, except Lucille, so we didn\u2019t know it was happening. She didn\u2019t either, until it went too far.\u201d Idriss paused and looked over at Lucas. He was doing his best to maintain a guise of calm, but he was worried that he was Eliott\u2019s replacement Idriss, just one that had been stupid enough to fall in love. </p><p>\u201cYou know he can speak parseltongue, yeah?\u201d Idriss asked. Lucas nodded, thinking about Brian, whom he had refused over and over to \u2018meet\u2019, no matter how many times Eliott begged. \u201cI can speak parseltongue too, only I was born able to speak it.\u201d</p><p>There was a flash in Lucas\u2019 mind of him and Eliott lying on the floor of the charms classroom, of Eliott sitting up abruptly, talking about how he hadn\u2019t always known how to speak parseltongue, how he\u2019d had an old friend who could. \u201cI still don\u2019t know how he learned,\u201d Idriss continued, \u201cAll I know is one day he started speaking to me in parseltongue like it was the most normal thing in the world and he was so happy with himself for learning it. It had taken him two days, <i>two days</i>, to learn a whole language that I\u2019d thought was unlearnable. We really should have seen what was going on, but again, we ignored it. That was when he started his great Instagram escapade too, insisting that it was the future of wizard communication and that it would be a good way to remember our time at school. The idea spread like wildfire, and suddenly Eliott was one of the most popular people at the school. It wasn\u2019t that he hadn\u2019t been before, but now <i>everyone</i> knew him, or wanted to.</p><p>\u201cThis was when Henri and Marc started spreading around that he was crazy. Some people believed it, some people didn\u2019t, and Sofiane, Lucille, and I did our best to quell the rumors, but they stuck. I\u2019m not sure whether he ever knew what everyone was saying about him or not, whether he even cared given the space he was in mentally, but it only made everyone more interested in him. One night, he didn\u2019t come back to the room again, and we got worried. That was when we checked where we knew he kept his meds and realized he must not have been taking them all year. Basically, we freaked the fuck out, called Lucille, but she didn\u2019t know where he was either\u2026\u201d Idriss trailed off and looked Lucas dead in the eye. \u201cDo you really want to know why he got expelled?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure whether or not he was lying. </p><p>\u201cHe started a livestream on Instagram, which seemed normal, at first, but we didn\u2019t know where the fuck he was. There\u2019s a bridge, leading up to the school, and he was underneath it, with about twenty cans of paint and his phone, letting the world know exactly what he was doing. All he said before he started painting was \u2018This is for you\u2019, and I knew he was talking to me. I\u2019m not sure if it was meant to be an apology or a way to win me over, but he started making a massive painting, right on the underbelly of the bridge. Suddenly the livestream numbers jumped from twenty, to five hundred, to four thousand, and so on. His livestream lasted for about twenty hours, and it was a weekend, so everyone watched the whole time. We still didn\u2019t know where he was at that point, so we couldn\u2019t stop him. </p><p>\u201cHis Instagram follower count went from four hundred to nearly six hundred thousand overnight, and there was even more people than that watching his livestream. Everyone was trying to figure out if it was some kind of joke or if he was insane. He was talking wildly the entire time, mostly to himself, but they were all eating it up. It might have all been ok, if he hadn\u2019t started using magic. The majority of the people watching were muggles, they weren\u2019t supposed to know about magic. He\u2019d broken the international statute of secrecy in a huge way. The headmaster found him eventually, and that\u2019s when the livestream cut out. Next thing we all knew Eliott had been expelled and sent from the school. I\u2019d wondered why they hadn\u2019t made him snap his wand but Lucille told me later that he\u2019d snapped it himself in a rage over what he considered a major injustice. <i>Why shouldn\u2019t the muggles know about magic? Why should we keep it all to ourselves?</i> I think the only reason everything blew over was because his parents came and explained the situation to the headmaster, but it didn\u2019t make much difference in the end. His Instagram was deactivated and he stopped talking to everyone but Lucille and wizards all over the world had to obliviate every muggle who\u2019d seen or heard of his livestream. The followers he has now are all wizards, thankfully, though I\u2019m not sure the French ministry would be too pleased to know that he\u2019s using Instagram again.\u201d Idriss took a break from speaking for a moment, running his hand over his buzzed hair. </p><p>When he spoke again his voice was oddly flat, like he was trying very hard not to have an emotional reaction. \u201cDuring the time he was expelled he tried to kill himself.\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019 head snapped to attention and his fists clenched the sheets beneath him. \u201cHe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thought we all hated him, that he was all alone, that no one would ever love him. Sofiane and I tried to reach out, but his parents always stopped us, so we had no way of knowing how deep he\u2019d sunk into the hole inside himself. They only told Lucille when it happened. She left school right away to visit him, and we tried to come too, but she insisted again that we didn\u2019t understand, that it would only make him feel worse. That was the last either of us heard anything about him until he reactivated his Instagram. Well, Imane told me he\u2019d started here, though, if I\u2019m being honest, I was reluctant to believe it. But yeah, I guess that\u2019s where my story ends and yours begins,\u201d Idriss finished, hesitation evident in his tone of voice, trying to gauge how Lucas would react. Lucas wasn\u2019t sure himself. </p><p>He laid back against the headboard, mulling over his thoughts in his mind. In some ways, he understood better why Eliott hadn\u2019t told him. He must have thought that all of his friends had abandoned him after everything that happened, and didn\u2019t want to lose another. Did he really love Lucas, then, if he\u2019d done everything he\u2019d done not to lose him? </p><p>\u201cI want to see him,\u201d Lucas decided. Imane sat up and placed a hand on his shoulder. </p><p>\u201cAre you sure? This is probably a lot to take in, even I didn\u2019t know some of that.\u201d She eyed him with concern, and he felt a surge of appreciation for her. He placed his hand on hers and squeezed it once before removing it from his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d he said, then turned to Idriss. \u201cAnd thank you, for telling me. I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m sorry for how things turned out for you guys, but I hope things can be better in the future. I know I\u2019d really like to be friends with the two of you.\u201d</p><p>Sofiane smiled that same brilliant smile. \u201cSame here, Lucas.\u201d</p><p>Idriss simply nodded, which was confirmation enough, given all that he\u2019d shared. </p><p>\u201cDo you think\u2026 do you think he really loves me?\u201d Lucas asked before he could stop himself. Idriss smiled at last. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m certain of, it\u2019s that. From what I\u2019ve heard from Imane, and seen on his Instagram, you\u2019re his <i>person</i>, you know? If soulmates are real, I think you\u2019ve both found yours.\u201d</p><p>Lucas became aware of the tears sliding down his cheeks as he smiled, tasting the saltiness. He didn\u2019t know how long they\u2019d been falling, but assumed it had been a while and was grateful to Imane, Sofiane, and Idriss for not mentioning it. </p><p>Without another word, he slid off the bed and out the door to go run to the man he loved, the man of his dreams. The staircases all worked in his favor and there was no one around in the hallways to slow him down as he ran, not even aware of how fast or how far he\u2019d run. He got to the doors to the hospital wing and stopped abruptly, taking time to catch his breath and smooth down his hair. He was still wearing the same clothes he\u2019d worn Friday, but he didn\u2019t have time to change. </p><p>Pushing open the door, he nearly ran straight into Lucille, who blinked at him in shock. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked with a hard expression. </p><p>\u201cI need to see him. Is he all right?\u201d He tried to peek around her head to find Eliott, but he must have been farther down the wing, somewhere he couldn\u2019t see. </p><p>\u201cLucas, you need to leave,\u201d she told him. </p><p>\u201cWhy.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question, not really. </p><p>She brushed her fingers through the ends of her hair, sighing. \u201cHe\u2019s coming down right now. <i>Down</i>, down, and he hates people seeing him like this. Trust me, I\u2019ve been there every time he\u2019s gone through this, I know what to do, you don\u2019t need to worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not&ndash;\u201d he cut off in frustration, \u201cI mean, I <i>am</i> worried, but not because I think you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. You need to leave later today, and he needs someone to be there for him. I <i>want</i> to be there for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d she said simply. </p><p>\u201cAnd why not?\u201d he laughed crudely. </p><p>\u201cBecause he has to come to <i>you</i>. If you\u2019re there before he\u2019s ready it will only make it worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that for sure? Did he tell you he didn\u2019t want to see me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d </p><p>The word caught Lucas off balance. \u201cW-what?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flicked away from his quickly, like she couldn\u2019t bear to look at him. It made him think she might be lying, but there was nothing he could do about it. </p><p>He turned to leave, not knowing what else he could do, when his gaze snagged on a vase of flowers by the entrance. Feeling inspired, he conjured lilies, remembering how Eliott had smelled them in his amortentia, and handed them to Lucille, taking a moment to write out a note on one of the scrap papers from the hotel. He attached it to one of the flowers and addressed Lucille. \u201cPlease give these to him for me.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at the note once before meeting his eyes again. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI probably won\u2019t see you again before you leave, so have a safe trip back to France,\u201d he said a bit awkwardly. He didn\u2019t <i>really</i> want to be cordial to her, but he thought of how Lucille was Eliott\u2019s Manon and how he wouldn\u2019t want Eliott to completely eviscerate Manon if their roles were swapped. </p><p>She looked a bit surprised. \u201cThank you, Lucas.

Above all, he wanted Eliott to be ok, and that was what hurt most of all. </p>[[MORE]]<p>If only it was as easy to let go as it was to fall in love in the first place. </p><p>The sheets on the bed still smelled like Eliott, though Lucas assumed that was partly due to the room working its magic, reflecting his desires. It didn\u2019t matter the cause, Lucas buried his face in them regardless, imagining they were in a universe that Eliott had trusted him with this part of himself, that he hadn\u2019t felt like he\u2019d had to hide. </p><p>That was what bothered Lucas most of all about everything. He didn\u2019t care that Eliott was bipolar, not really. Being bipolar didn\u2019t mean that he couldn\u2019t love Lucas, as he\u2019d originally thought when Lucille had spoken to him. Lucille hadn\u2019t said that, she\u2019d said \u2018Didn\u2019t he tell you why he\u2019d been expelled\u2019? and it had cut deeper than any knife. Eliott didn\u2019t not love him because he wasn\u2019t capable, he didn\u2019t love him because he felt like he couldn\u2019t trust him. Lucas had trusted Eliott with every part of him, even the parts he readily hid from everyone else, but Eliott hadn\u2019t felt that he could do the same. </p><p>He wondered if Eliott was still in the hospital wing, if they knew how to treat him properly. He supposed it was a good thing that Lucille was there that weekend, if she knew about his illness. Did Idriss and Sofiane know about it? Maybe they didn\u2019t, it could explain why Eliott was so adamant that they weren\u2019t friends when all evidence suggested otherwise. Idriss and Sofiane wouldn\u2019t have went out of their way for Lucas if they hadn\u2019t cared deeply for Eliott. </p><p>If their situations were reversed, would he have told Eliott? He\u2019d been trying to put himself into Eliott\u2019s shoes to no avail. <i>Of course</i>, his head told him, <i>of course you would have told him</i>, but he didn\u2019t know if it was true or just wishful thinking. </p><p>\u201cLucas Lallemant!\u201d an angry voice yelled out of nowhere and Lucas shot up in bed, eyes wide and hair tangled. Imane stood at the foot of his bed, arms crossed. Behind her were Idriss and Sofiane, looking a tad bit more hesitant, like they weren\u2019t sure if they should be there or not. Come to think of it\u2026 how were they in there? He\u2019d been very specific with his instructions for the room.</p><p>\u201cHow did you\u2026?\u201d he asked blearily, blinking away tears he hadn\u2019t realized were close to falling from his eyes. Imane rolled her eyes and sat on the edge of the bed. </p><p>\u201cPlease, did you really think I wouldn\u2019t figure out how to get in?\u201d</p><p>Fair enough. He should have known better than to underestimate Imane. \u201cBut why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m supposed to let you hide away in here, avoiding the world forever? What kind of friend would I be if I did that?\u201d Her voice was so stern that he almost didn\u2019t realize what she\u2019d said.</p><p>His face split into a hesitant grin. \u201cOh, we\u2019re friends, are we?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes softened at his smile, even as she leaned over and hit the side of his head. \u201cHey!\u201d he exclaimed, bringing his hands up to defend himself if need be. </p><p>\u201cOf course we\u2019re friends you dumbass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me if you\u2019re sending some mixed signals,\u201d he said rubbing the side of his head. Sofiane smirked softly behind her, bringing Lucas\u2019 attention back to them, why they were there. </p><p>He dropped his eyes to the sheets in front of him, a tad embarrassed for what they\u2019d had to deal with. \u201cThank you guys, for the other night. I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I was\u2026 I don\u2019t even know. But thank you,\u201d he brought his eyes up to meet Idriss\u2019, then Sofiane\u2019s, \u201cSeriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d Sofiane said with his megawatt smile. Now that the situation was a tad less dire, Lucas found himself taking in every inch of Sofiane\u2019s appearance. He had nothing on Eliott, of course, but still, he was quite the view. Idriss wasn\u2019t so bad himself, but he knew Imane would kill him if he ever said anything, so he stayed quiet. </p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Eliott?\u201d he asked softly, noticing how Sofiane\u2019s smile dimmed slightly. He sat on the bed beside Imane and Lucas saw her body language shift with him so close to her. If the circumstances were different, he might have inquired about it. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not great,\u201d Sofiane said candidly, \u201cLucille\u2019s the only person he lets see him, but from what she\u2019s told us, he\u2019s coming down, regretting things.\u201d</p><p>Lucas felt his heart clench painfully at the mention of Lucille. Had Eliott lied to him about her too? Was she more important in his life than he\u2019d insinuated? As if anticipating his question, Sofiane continued, \u201cLucille and Eliott are like siblings. They love like them, fight like them. None of us have ever been able to touch their relationship, and we didn\u2019t want to. What they have with each other is special, but it\u2019s nothing like what I\u2019m sure you two have with each other, ok? Manon\u2019s your sister, right? Lucille being with Eliott would be like Manon being with you.\u201d</p><p>There was a lot of information that Lucas was trying to take in, so he couldn\u2019t mumble anything other than, \u201cBut I\u2019m gay?\u201d</p><p>Needless to say, Imane hit him again, but this time she was smiling and she sank onto the pillow beside him. Sofiane reached up to scratch his head before looking at Lucas earnestly. \u201cWe had no idea that you didn\u2019t know he was bipolar. I assume that\u2019s why you ran off after you talked to Lucille?\u201d</p><p>Lucas nodded. Sofiane grimaced. \u201cWe love Lucille, we do, but she can be a bit\u2026 direct at times.\u201d</p><p>Idriss snorted from where he was leaning against one of the walls. \u201cUnderstatement of the century.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegardless,\u201d Sofiane shot Idriss an unamused glance before returning his attention to Lucas, \u201cWe know firsthand how it can be\u2026 a lot to take in at first. But it doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s less of a person than you thought he was.\u201d</p><p>Lucas shook his head immediately. \u201cI didn\u2019t walk away because she said he was bipolar. I don\u2019t care about that. My\u2013 my birth mother, she was schizophrenic, and I feel guilty every day that I wasn\u2019t able to be there for her, that I didn\u2019t know what was going on until it was too late. I know that Eliott is still Eliott, no matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you hiding?\u201d Imane asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause he doesn\u2019t love me, and I don\u2019t know how to go about my life trying to stop loving him.\u201d</p><p>Idriss folded his arms over his chest. \u201cYou think because he\u2019s bipolar he can\u2019t love you? Trust me, that\u2019s not the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I\u2013\u201d Lucas began, interrupted by Sofiane. </p><p>\u201cHe feels more than any of us, loves harder than we could even begin to comprehend. I wouldn\u2019t count him out just yet.\u201d</p><p>Lucas cut back in, trying to explain himself. \u201cI know that. Well, I guess I didn\u2019t totally know <i>that</i>, but I knew he was capable of love. Of course he is. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve seen him fall in love with a flower, with a door handle. I trusted him with my entire life, tragic backstory and all, but I never would have even known the two of you existed if I wasn\u2019t friends with Imane. How can he say he loves me, and how can I believe him, if he doesn\u2019t trust me at all?\u201d</p><p>Sofiane and Idriss exchanged a glance with one another. He hadn\u2019t meant to completely unload everything onto them, but it had felt too good to stop. The fact that they weren\u2019t saying anything told him that he wasn\u2019t completely off base either. Sofiane and Idriss seemed to come to some sort of silent understanding, Sofiane speaking at last. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Lucas\u2019 voice broke at the end of the word, shattering with the last bit of his heart. Imane snapped her head in his direction. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell you why he was expelled?\u201d she asked. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he repeated, just as broken. </p><p>\u201cI feel like it\u2019s Eliott\u2019s prerogative to tell you or not to tell you, but\u2026\u201d Sofiane trailed off, standing up from the bed, pacing. \u201cI also feel like you have a right to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lucas repeated one more time, but this time he was resigned to it. \u201cIt\u2019s his story to tell. If I never know\u2026 then I never know. I\u2019m not entitled to anything.\u201d</p><p>Sofiane glanced at Idriss. \u201cWell, the thing is\u2026 it\u2019s kind of our story to tell as well. Idriss\u2019, at the very least. If we tell you, it might help you to be there for him in the way that we weren\u2019t. It haunts us every day too, you know. \u201d</p><p>Lucas looked up sharply first at Idriss, then at Imane, who nodded. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d he asked her. She shrugged. \u201cLike you said, it isn\u2019t my story to tell. Plus, I assumed he\u2019d told you, especially after the mural.\u201d</p><p>He stared at his hands in his lap for a moment. Of course he would have preferred if Eliott told him these things, but at this rate he didn\u2019t know if Eliott would ever talk to him again, and maybe hearing Idriss\u2019 story could help him figure out what to do next. \u201cOk,\u201d he said, \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to tell me, I\u2019m willing to listen.\u201d</p><p>Idriss took a breath in and out, glancing at his sister, then Sofiane, before beginning, \u201cI\u2019m assuming he didn\u2019t tell you this, but at Beauxbatons we were best friends. Him, me, Sofiane, and two other guys who we don\u2019t really talk to anymore. They treated Eliott different after he was diagnosed and even more so after everything else that happened. A lot of people at school were like that, actually.\u201d</p><p>Lucas thought back to some comments he and Eliott had received on their Instagram posts occasionally, but especially following their time painting the mural. Eliott had brushed them off at the time, and Lucas hadn\u2019t thought too much about it, but maybe it was somewhat relevant to what Idriss was telling him. </p><p>\u201cWizards don\u2019t understand mental illness,\u201d Idriss continued, and Lucas nodded grimly. He knew firsthand just how much wizards didn\u2019t understand mental illness. \u201cHe wanted to keep it a secret, only the five of us and Lucille knew, other than his parents, obviously. Honestly, he probably only told us about it because his therapist had told him to tell <i>someone</i>, and it\u2019s not like we wouldn\u2019t have noticed if he was depressed or manic over time, especially living in the same room. He was diagnosed when we were fifteen, the summer before fifth year. Apparently he\u2019d had a pretty bad manic episode over the summer holidays that led to his diagnosis, according to Lucille. She was the only one he saw that whole summer. When he came back to school, everything was chill. He told us about his diagnosis a few months in, and we were all there for him. Sofiane and I are muggle born as well, so we sort of knew about mental illnesses, but Henri and Marc were mostly clueless\u2013 Henri and Marc were our other friends, by the way\u2013\u201d</p><p>It had to be the two Lucas had seen on Instagram. Henririen and theoneandonly. He should have blocked them. </p><p>\u201c\u2013because they\u2019d grown up in predominantly wizarding families. They were supportive at first, especially because Eliott seemed the same as always. Then, about a quarter through fifth year, he had a major depressive episode. He wouldn\u2019t eat, get out of bed, talk to us, anything, no matter what we tried. He came out of it after about a month, and it slowly got better and better over the course of a few more months, but somehow the dynamic between us all had shifted. Henri and Marc were distant, would make snide comments here and there because they just didn\u2019t understand. Lucille was with him all the time because she insisted that she was the only one who could really understand him. That kind of pissed off Sof and I, but we let it slide because Eliott\u2019s well-being was more important than our pride.\u201d</p><p>How had Eliott ever let friends like these go? What the hell had happened? </p><p>\u201cListen, Lucas, when I tell you the rest, I promise you that it was all way in the past, ok? Nothing lingering from back then. No\u2026 feelings of any kind.\u201d Idriss was nearly pleading, which worried Lucas, but he wanted to know the rest so he just said he understood and nodded for Idriss to continue. </p><p>\u201cOk,\u201d Idriss nodded, \u201cWell, after fifth year, everything turned out ok. We spent time together over the holidays, Henri and Marc weren\u2019t around as much, but that just allowed the three of us to become closer which was a good thing, at first. Once sixth year started, I could sort of sense a shift, though I just thought it was because of Henri and Marc. It started to become apparent to me midway through the year that it wasn\u2019t about Henri and Marc, it was about Eliott and me. He\u2019d\u2026 developed feelings for me. I thought if I ignored it, or gave him subtle hints that it was never going to happen, that it would go away, and for a time I thought it did. But then he kissed me, out of the blue one day when he\u2019d invited me alone to help him study. I\u2013 I didn\u2019t handle things well. I don\u2019t even remember what I said, but I pushed him away from me and left him there, alone. I felt bad about it after, of course I did, there were so many better ways to handle it, so I decided next time I saw him I would apologize.</p><p>\u201cOnly, he didn\u2019t come back to our room that night or the next, didn\u2019t come to classes either. Sofiane and I got worried that maybe he was depressed again, but then all of a sudden he showed up again, looking and acting like nothing had happened. He was smiling a lot, talking about how every day was the best of his life and we knew that he wasn\u2019t sleeping at night. None of us had ever seen him manic before, except Lucille, so we didn\u2019t know it was happening. She didn\u2019t either, until it went too far.\u201d Idriss paused and looked over at Lucas. He was doing his best to maintain a guise of calm, but he was worried that he was Eliott\u2019s replacement Idriss, just one that had been stupid enough to fall in love. </p><p>\u201cYou know he can speak parseltongue, yeah?\u201d Idriss asked. Lucas nodded, thinking about Brian, whom he had refused over and over to \u2018meet\u2019, no matter how many times Eliott begged. \u201cI can speak parseltongue too, only I was born able to speak it.\u201d</p><p>There was a flash in Lucas\u2019 mind of him and Eliott lying on the floor of the charms classroom, of Eliott sitting up abruptly, talking about how he hadn\u2019t always known how to speak parseltongue, how he\u2019d had an old friend who could. \u201cI still don\u2019t know how he learned,\u201d Idriss continued, \u201cAll I know is one day he started speaking to me in parseltongue like it was the most normal thing in the world and he was so happy with himself for learning it. It had taken him two days, <i>two days</i>, to learn a whole language that I\u2019d thought was unlearnable. We really should have seen what was going on, but again, we ignored it. That was when he started his great Instagram escapade too, insisting that it was the future of wizard communication and that it would be a good way to remember our time at school. The idea spread like wildfire, and suddenly Eliott was one of the most popular people at the school. It wasn\u2019t that he hadn\u2019t been before, but now <i>everyone</i> knew him, or wanted to.</p><p>\u201cThis was when Henri and Marc started spreading around that he was crazy. Some people believed it, some people didn\u2019t, and Sofiane, Lucille, and I did our best to quell the rumors, but they stuck. I\u2019m not sure whether he ever knew what everyone was saying about him or not, whether he even cared given the space he was in mentally, but it only made everyone more interested in him. One night, he didn\u2019t come back to the room again, and we got worried. That was when we checked where we knew he kept his meds and realized he must not have been taking them all year. Basically, we freaked the fuck out, called Lucille, but she didn\u2019t know where he was either\u2026\u201d Idriss trailed off and looked Lucas dead in the eye. \u201cDo you really want to know why he got expelled?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure whether or not he was lying. </p><p>\u201cHe started a livestream on Instagram, which seemed normal, at first, but we didn\u2019t know where the fuck he was. There\u2019s a bridge, leading up to the school, and he was underneath it, with about twenty cans of paint and his phone, letting the world know exactly what he was doing. All he said before he started painting was \u2018This is for you\u2019, and I knew he was talking to me. I\u2019m not sure if it was meant to be an apology or a way to win me over, but he started making a massive painting, right on the underbelly of the bridge. Suddenly the livestream numbers jumped from twenty, to five hundred, to four thousand, and so on. His livestream lasted for about twenty hours, and it was a weekend, so everyone watched the whole time. We still didn\u2019t know where he was at that point, so we couldn\u2019t stop him. </p><p>\u201cHis Instagram follower count went from four hundred to nearly six hundred thousand overnight, and there was even more people than that watching his livestream. Everyone was trying to figure out if it was some kind of joke or if he was insane. He was talking wildly the entire time, mostly to himself, but they were all eating it up. It might have all been ok, if he hadn\u2019t started using magic. The majority of the people watching were muggles, they weren\u2019t supposed to know about magic. He\u2019d broken the international statute of secrecy in a huge way. The headmaster found him eventually, and that\u2019s when the livestream cut out. Next thing we all knew Eliott had been expelled and sent from the school. I\u2019d wondered why they hadn\u2019t made him snap his wand but Lucille told me later that he\u2019d snapped it himself in a rage over what he considered a major injustice. <i>Why shouldn\u2019t the muggles know about magic? Why should we keep it all to ourselves?</i> I think the only reason everything blew over was because his parents came and explained the situation to the headmaster, but it didn\u2019t make much difference in the end. His Instagram was deactivated and he stopped talking to everyone but Lucille and wizards all over the world had to obliviate every muggle who\u2019d seen or heard of his livestream. The followers he has now are all wizards, thankfully, though I\u2019m not sure the French ministry would be too pleased to know that he\u2019s using Instagram again.\u201d Idriss took a break from speaking for a moment, running his hand over his buzzed hair. </p><p>When he spoke again his voice was oddly flat, like he was trying very hard not to have an emotional reaction. \u201cDuring the time he was expelled he tried to kill himself.\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019 head snapped to attention and his fists clenched the sheets beneath him. \u201cHe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thought we all hated him, that he was all alone, that no one would ever love him. Sofiane and I tried to reach out, but his parents always stopped us, so we had no way of knowing how deep he\u2019d sunk into the hole inside himself. They only told Lucille when it happened. She left school right away to visit him, and we tried to come too, but she insisted again that we didn\u2019t understand, that it would only make him feel worse. That was the last either of us heard anything about him until he reactivated his Instagram. Well, Imane told me he\u2019d started here, though, if I\u2019m being honest, I was reluctant to believe it. But yeah, I guess that\u2019s where my story ends and yours begins,\u201d Idriss finished, hesitation evident in his tone of voice, trying to gauge how Lucas would react. Lucas wasn\u2019t sure himself. </p><p>He laid back against the headboard, mulling over his thoughts in his mind. In some ways, he understood better why Eliott hadn\u2019t told him. He must have thought that all of his friends had abandoned him after everything that happened, and didn\u2019t want to lose another. Did he really love Lucas, then, if he\u2019d done everything he\u2019d done not to lose him? </p><p>\u201cI want to see him,\u201d Lucas decided. Imane sat up and placed a hand on his shoulder. </p><p>\u201cAre you sure? This is probably a lot to take in, even I didn\u2019t know some of that.\u201d She eyed him with concern, and he felt a surge of appreciation for her. He placed his hand on hers and squeezed it once before removing it from his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d he said, then turned to Idriss. \u201cAnd thank you, for telling me. I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m sorry for how things turned out for you guys, but I hope things can be better in the future. I know I\u2019d really like to be friends with the two of you.\u201d</p><p>Sofiane smiled that same brilliant smile. \u201cSame here, Lucas.\u201d</p><p>Idriss simply nodded, which was confirmation enough, given all that he\u2019d shared. </p><p>\u201cDo you think\u2026 do you think he really loves me?\u201d Lucas asked before he could stop himself. Idriss smiled at last. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m certain of, it\u2019s that. From what I\u2019ve heard from Imane, and seen on his Instagram, you\u2019re his <i>person</i>, you know? If soulmates are real, I think you\u2019ve both found yours.\u201d</p><p>Lucas became aware of the tears sliding down his cheeks as he smiled, tasting the saltiness. He didn\u2019t know how long they\u2019d been falling, but assumed it had been a while and was grateful to Imane, Sofiane, and Idriss for not mentioning it. </p><p>Without another word, he slid off the bed and out the door to go run to the man he loved, the man of his dreams. The staircases all worked in his favor and there was no one around in the hallways to slow him down as he ran, not even aware of how fast or how far he\u2019d run. He got to the doors to the hospital wing and stopped abruptly, taking time to catch his breath and smooth down his hair. He was still wearing the same clothes he\u2019d worn Friday, but he didn\u2019t have time to change. </p><p>Pushing open the door, he nearly ran straight into Lucille, who blinked at him in shock. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked with a hard expression. </p><p>\u201cI need to see him. Is he all right?\u201d He tried to peek around her head to find Eliott, but he must have been farther down the wing, somewhere he couldn\u2019t see. </p><p>\u201cLucas, you need to leave,\u201d she told him. </p><p>\u201cWhy.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question, not really. </p><p>She brushed her fingers through the ends of her hair, sighing. \u201cHe\u2019s coming down right now. <i>Down</i>, down, and he hates people seeing him like this. Trust me, I\u2019ve been there every time he\u2019s gone through this, I know what to do, you don\u2019t need to worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2013\u201d he cut off in frustration, \u201cI mean, I <i>am</i> worried, but not because I think you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. You need to leave later today, and he needs someone to be there for him. I <i>want</i> to be there for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d she said simply. </p><p>\u201cAnd why not?\u201d he laughed crudely. </p><p>\u201cBecause he has to come to <i>you</i>. If you\u2019re there before he\u2019s ready it will only make it worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that for sure? Did he tell you he didn\u2019t want to see me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d </p><p>The word caught Lucas off balance. \u201cW-what?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flicked away from his quickly, like she couldn\u2019t bear to look at him. It made him think she might be lying, but there was nothing he could do about it. </p><p>He turned to leave, not knowing what else he could do, when his gaze snagged on a vase of flowers by the entrance. Feeling inspired, he conjured lilies, remembering how Eliott had smelled them in his amortentia, and handed them to Lucille, taking a moment to write out a note on one of the scrap papers from the hotel. He attached it to one of the flowers and addressed Lucille. \u201cPlease give these to him for me.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at the note once before meeting his eyes again. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI probably won\u2019t see you again before you leave, so have a safe trip back to France,\u201d he said a bit awkwardly. He didn\u2019t <i>really</i> want to be cordial to her, but he thought of how Lucille was Eliott\u2019s Manon and how he wouldn\u2019t want Eliott to completely eviscerate Manon if their roles were swapped. </p><p>She looked a bit surprised. \u201cThank you, Lucas. Goodbye.\u201d </p><p>Her goodbye had a finality to it, but he wasn\u2019t going to let her get off that easily. \u201cSee you later,\u201d he said, before turning on his heel, smirking to himself slightly before exiting the room and reflecting on the note he\u2019d written for Eliott. </p><p><i>Idriss told me about everything, I hope that was ok. Just know that I\u2019ll be here when you\u2019re ready. Promise. -Lucas</i></p><p>He hoped it was enough, but it was all he could do at this point. </p><p>Hope. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"2538\" data-orig-width=\"3333\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ca2a157f5b1c41d718596bb82b750016/tumblr_inline_prf00qF56a1v7op4y_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"2538\" data-orig-width=\"3333\"></figure><p><b><a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/183588080626/la-fin-des-temps-chapter-1-mercredi\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 1</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/183725050441/la-fin-des-temps-chapter-2-hogwarts-au\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 2</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/183824145246/la-fin-des-temps-chapter-3-elu-hogwarts-au\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 3</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/183876195116/la-fin-des-temps-chapter-4-elu-hogwarts-au\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 4</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/183992139736/la-fin-des-temps-chapter-5-elu-hogwarts-au\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 5</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184063483831/la-fin-des-temps-chapter-6-elu-hogwarts-au\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 6</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184136608806/la-fin-des-temps-chapter-7-elu-hogwarts-au\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 7 </a><a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184252745791/la-fin-des-temps-chapter-8-elu-hogwarts-au\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 8</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184302738501/la-fin-des-temps-chapter-9-elu-hogwarts-au\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 9</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184322267426/la-fin-des-temps-chapter-10-elu-hogwarts-au\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 10</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184392719146/la-fin-des-temps-chapter-11-elu-hogwarts-au\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 11</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184491892511/la-fin-des-temps-chapter-12-elu-hogwarts-au\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 12</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184583337071/la-fin-des-temps-chapter-13-elu-hogwarts-au\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 13</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184627502876/la-fin-des-temps-chapter-14-elu-hogwarts-au\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 14</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184762316386/la-fin-des-temps-chapter-15-elu-hogwarts-au\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 15</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184788307416/la-fin-des-temps-chapter-16-elu-hogwarts-au\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 16</a></b></p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F18189278%2Fchapters%2F43024613&amp;t=MTVlY2VhNjhhNmUxMTNiOGQ1NWY5M2U5MTY1YjYwMTdmNGI2OGQ3ZCxJNGZtQ1RybQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A59r44GdNvhhBBAvLv5EYvg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Flivvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F184302738501%2Fla-fin-des-temps-chapter-9-elu-hogwarts-au&amp;m=1\" target=\"_blank\"><b>AO3</b></a></p><p>Weekly Instagram Roundup: <b><a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/183852238846/la-fin-des-temps-weekly-instagram-roundup\" target=\"_blank\">Week 1</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184021001261/la-fin-des-temps-weekly-instagram-roundup\" target=\"_blank\">Week 2</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184184560651/la-fin-des-temps-weekly-instagram-roundup\" target=\"_blank\">Week 3</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184348714576/la-fin-des-temps-weekly-instagram-roundup\" target=\"_blank\">Week 4</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184512062926/la-fin-des-temps-weekly-instagram-roundup\" target=\"_blank\">Week 5</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184675094376/la-fin-des-temps-weekly-instagram-roundup\" target=\"_blank\">Week 6</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184834448471/la-fin-des-temps-weekly-instagram-roundup\" target=\"_blank\">Week 7</a>\u00a0</b></p>",

He\u2019d debated going to his safe place under the Quidditch stadium, but remembered that there was a match that weekend, which spoiled those plans. So, the Room of Requirement it was. He was lucky he knew how to work it so well, if anyone had been looking for him, they wouldn\u2019t be able to get in. </p><p>His phone had died shortly after he\u2019d stumbled in here, drained after hours of fruitless research on bipolar disorder. He hadn\u2019t bothered to charge it since then, knowing that there would be numerous calls, messages, and Instagram posts waiting for him. All he wanted to do was lie there and stare at the ceiling, forgetting that the person he\u2019d thought he\u2019d spend the rest of his life with didn\u2019t actually love him. The things Lucille had said hadn\u2019t totally matched up to what he\u2019d read online, but he figured that she was probably more trustworthy than the internet, especially given how long she\u2019d known Eliott. </p><p>He groaned and covered his eyes with his hands, rubbing them as if that would make everything hurt less. Everything had been perfect, and now it was all wrecked. He should have known better, known things weren\u2019t going to last. Nothing in life came easily, and it was most often taken away before there was even a chance to enjoy it, at least in his experience. </p><p>He could bemoan his troubles all he wanted, but they really were minute compared to what Eliott must have been going through. It took a lot of his willpower to not go and demand to see him, knowing that wasn\u2019t going to help anything but wishing it would. Maybe Eliott didn\u2019t love him, but he loved Eliott so much he could feel it every time he pressed his hands to where his heart sat beneath his skin. Above all, he wanted Eliott to be ok, and that was what hurt most of all. </p>[[MORE]]<p>If only it was as easy to let go as it was to fall in love in the first place. </p><p>The sheets on the bed still smelled like Eliott, though Lucas assumed that was partly due to the room working its magic, reflecting his desires. It didn\u2019t matter the cause, Lucas buried his face in them regardless, imagining they were in a universe that Eliott had trusted him with this part of himself, that he hadn\u2019t felt like he\u2019d had to hide. </p><p>That was what bothered Lucas most of all about everything. He didn\u2019t care that Eliott was bipolar, not really. Being bipolar didn\u2019t mean that he couldn\u2019t love Lucas, as he\u2019d originally thought when Lucille had spoken to him. Lucille hadn\u2019t said that, she\u2019d said \u2018Didn\u2019t he tell you why he\u2019d been expelled\u2019? and it had cut deeper than any knife. Eliott didn\u2019t not love him because he wasn\u2019t capable, he didn\u2019t love him because he felt like he couldn\u2019t trust him. Lucas had trusted Eliott with every part of him, even the parts he readily hid from everyone else, but Eliott hadn\u2019t felt that he could do the same. </p><p>He wondered if Eliott was still in the hospital wing, if they knew how to treat him properly. He supposed it was a good thing that Lucille was there that weekend, if she knew about his illness. Did Idriss and Sofiane know about it? Maybe they didn\u2019t, it could explain why Eliott was so adamant that they weren\u2019t friends when all evidence suggested otherwise. Idriss and Sofiane wouldn\u2019t have went out of their way for Lucas if they hadn\u2019t cared deeply for Eliott. </p><p>If their situations were reversed, would he have told Eliott? He\u2019d been trying to put himself into Eliott\u2019s shoes to no avail. <i>Of course</i>, his head told him, <i>of course you would have told him</i>, but he didn\u2019t know if it was true or just wishful thinking. </p><p>\u201cLucas Lallemant!\u201d an angry voice yelled out of nowhere and Lucas shot up in bed, eyes wide and hair tangled. Imane stood at the foot of his bed, arms crossed. Behind her were Idriss and Sofiane, looking a tad bit more hesitant, like they weren\u2019t sure if they should be there or not. Come to think of it\u2026 how were they in there? He\u2019d been very specific with his instructions for the room.</p><p>\u201cHow did you\u2026?\u201d he asked blearily, blinking away tears he hadn\u2019t realized were close to falling from his eyes. Imane rolled her eyes and sat on the edge of the bed. </p><p>\u201cPlease, did you really think I wouldn\u2019t figure out how to get in?\u201d</p><p>Fair enough. He should have known better than to underestimate Imane. \u201cBut why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m supposed to let you hide away in here, avoiding the world forever? What kind of friend would I be if I did that?\u201d Her voice was so stern that he almost didn\u2019t realize what she\u2019d said.</p><p>His face split into a hesitant grin. \u201cOh, we\u2019re friends, are we?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes softened at his smile, even as she leaned over and hit the side of his head. \u201cHey!\u201d he exclaimed, bringing his hands up to defend himself if need be. </p><p>\u201cOf course we\u2019re friends you dumbass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me if you\u2019re sending some mixed signals,\u201d he said rubbing the side of his head. Sofiane smirked softly behind her, bringing Lucas\u2019 attention back to them, why they were there. </p><p>He dropped his eyes to the sheets in front of him, a tad embarrassed for what they\u2019d had to deal with. \u201cThank you guys, for the other night. I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I was\u2026 I don\u2019t even know. But thank you,\u201d he brought his eyes up to meet Idriss\u2019, then Sofiane\u2019s, \u201cSeriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d Sofiane said with his megawatt smile. Now that the situation was a tad less dire, Lucas found himself taking in every inch of Sofiane\u2019s appearance. He had nothing on Eliott, of course, but still, he was quite the view. Idriss wasn\u2019t so bad himself, but he knew Imane would kill him if he ever said anything, so he stayed quiet. </p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Eliott?\u201d he asked softly, noticing how Sofiane\u2019s smile dimmed slightly. He sat on the bed beside Imane and Lucas saw her body language shift with him so close to her. If the circumstances were different, he might have inquired about it. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not great,\u201d Sofiane said candidly, \u201cLucille\u2019s the only person he lets see him, but from what she\u2019s told us, he\u2019s coming down, regretting things.\u201d</p><p>Lucas felt his heart clench painfully at the mention of Lucille. Had Eliott lied to him about her too? Was she more important in his life than he\u2019d insinuated? As if anticipating his question, Sofiane continued, \u201cLucille and Eliott are like siblings. They love like them, fight like them. None of us have ever been able to touch their relationship, and we didn\u2019t want to. What they have with each other is special, but it\u2019s nothing like what I\u2019m sure you two have with each other, ok? Manon\u2019s your sister, right? Lucille being with Eliott would be like Manon being with you.\u201d</p><p>There was a lot of information that Lucas was trying to take in, so he couldn\u2019t mumble anything other than, \u201cBut I\u2019m gay?\u201d</p><p>Needless to say, Imane hit him again, but this time she was smiling and she sank onto the pillow beside him. Sofiane reached up to scratch his head before looking at Lucas earnestly. \u201cWe had no idea that you didn\u2019t know he was bipolar. I assume that\u2019s why you ran off after you talked to Lucille?\u201d</p><p>Lucas nodded. Sofiane grimaced. \u201cWe love Lucille, we do, but she can be a bit\u2026 direct at times.\u201d</p><p>Idriss snorted from where he was leaning against one of the walls. \u201cUnderstatement of the century.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegardless,\u201d Sofiane shot Idriss an unamused glance before returning his attention to Lucas, \u201cWe know firsthand how it can be\u2026 a lot to take in at first. But it doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s less of a person than you thought he was.\u201d</p><p>Lucas shook his head immediately. \u201cI didn\u2019t walk away because she said he was bipolar. I don\u2019t care about that. My\u2013 my birth mother, she was schizophrenic, and I feel guilty every day that I wasn\u2019t able to be there for her, that I didn\u2019t know what was going on until it was too late. I know that Eliott is still Eliott, no matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you hiding?\u201d Imane asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause he doesn\u2019t love me, and I don\u2019t know how to go about my life trying to stop loving him.\u201d</p><p>Idriss folded his arms over his chest. \u201cYou think because he\u2019s bipolar he can\u2019t love you? Trust me, that\u2019s not the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I\u2013\u201d Lucas began, interrupted by Sofiane. </p><p>\u201cHe feels more than any of us, loves harder than we could even begin to comprehend. I wouldn\u2019t count him out just yet.\u201d</p><p>Lucas cut back in, trying to explain himself. \u201cI know that. Well, I guess I didn\u2019t totally know <i>that</i>, but I knew he was capable of love. Of course he is. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve seen him fall in love with a flower, with a door handle. I trusted him with my entire life, tragic backstory and all, but I never would have even known the two of you existed if I wasn\u2019t friends with Imane. How can he say he loves me, and how can I believe him, if he doesn\u2019t trust me at all?\u201d</p><p>Sofiane and Idriss exchanged a glance with one another. He hadn\u2019t meant to completely unload everything onto them, but it had felt too good to stop. The fact that they weren\u2019t saying anything told him that he wasn\u2019t completely off base either. Sofiane and Idriss seemed to come to some sort of silent understanding, Sofiane speaking at last. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Lucas\u2019 voice broke at the end of the word, shattering with the last bit of his heart. Imane snapped her head in his direction. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell you why he was expelled?\u201d she asked. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he repeated, just as broken. </p><p>\u201cI feel like it\u2019s Eliott\u2019s prerogative to tell you or not to tell you, but\u2026\u201d Sofiane trailed off, standing up from the bed, pacing. \u201cI also feel like you have a right to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lucas repeated one more time, but this time he was resigned to it. \u201cIt\u2019s his story to tell. If I never know\u2026 then I never know. I\u2019m not entitled to anything.\u201d</p><p>Sofiane glanced at Idriss. \u201cWell, the thing is\u2026 it\u2019s kind of our story to tell as well. Idriss\u2019, at the very least. If we tell you, it might help you to be there for him in the way that we weren\u2019t. It haunts us every day too, you know. \u201d</p><p>Lucas looked up sharply first at Idriss, then at Imane, who nodded. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d he asked her. She shrugged. \u201cLike you said, it isn\u2019t my story to tell. Plus, I assumed he\u2019d told you, especially after the mural.\u201d</p><p>He stared at his hands in his lap for a moment. Of course he would have preferred if Eliott told him these things, but at this rate he didn\u2019t know if Eliott would ever talk to him again, and maybe hearing Idriss\u2019 story could help him figure out what to do next. \u201cOk,\u201d he said, \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to tell me, I\u2019m willing to listen.\u201d</p><p>Idriss took a breath in and out, glancing at his sister, then Sofiane, before beginning, \u201cI\u2019m assuming he didn\u2019t tell you this, but at Beauxbatons we were best friends. Him, me, Sofiane, and two other guys who we don\u2019t really talk to anymore. They treated Eliott different after he was diagnosed and even more so after everything else that happened. A lot of people at school were like that, actually.\u201d</p><p>Lucas thought back to some comments he and Eliott had received on their Instagram posts occasionally, but especially following their time painting the mural. Eliott had brushed them off at the time, and Lucas hadn\u2019t thought too much about it, but maybe it was somewhat relevant to what Idriss was telling him. </p><p>\u201cWizards don\u2019t understand mental illness,\u201d Idriss continued, and Lucas nodded grimly. He knew firsthand just how much wizards didn\u2019t understand mental illness. \u201cHe wanted to keep it a secret, only the five of us and Lucille knew, other than his parents, obviously. Honestly, he probably only told us about it because his therapist had told him to tell <i>someone</i>, and it\u2019s not like we wouldn\u2019t have noticed if he was depressed or manic over time, especially living in the same room. He was diagnosed when we were fifteen, the summer before fifth year. Apparently he\u2019d had a pretty bad manic episode over the summer holidays that led to his diagnosis, according to Lucille. She was the only one he saw that whole summer. When he came back to school, everything was chill. He told us about his diagnosis a few months in, and we were all there for him. Sofiane and I are muggle born as well, so we sort of knew about mental illnesses, but Henri and Marc were mostly clueless\u2013 Henri and Marc were our other friends, by the way\u2013\u201d</p><p>It had to be the two Lucas had seen on Instagram. Henririen and theoneandonly. He should have blocked them. </p><p>\u201c\u2013because they\u2019d grown up in predominantly wizarding families. They were supportive at first, especially because Eliott seemed the same as always. Then, about a quarter through fifth year, he had a major depressive episode. He wouldn\u2019t eat, get out of bed, talk to us, anything, no matter what we tried. He came out of it after about a month, and it slowly got better and better over the course of a few more months, but somehow the dynamic between us all had shifted. Henri and Marc were distant, would make snide comments here and there because they just didn\u2019t understand. Lucille was with him all the time because she insisted that she was the only one who could really understand him. That kind of pissed off Sof and I, but we let it slide because Eliott\u2019s well-being was more important than our pride.\u201d</p><p>How had Eliott ever let friends like these go? What the hell had happened? </p><p>\u201cListen, Lucas, when I tell you the rest, I promise you that it was all way in the past, ok? Nothing lingering from back then. No\u2026 feelings of any kind.\u201d Idriss was nearly pleading, which worried Lucas, but he wanted to know the rest so he just said he understood and nodded for Idriss to continue. </p><p>\u201cOk,\u201d Idriss nodded, \u201cWell, after fifth year, everything turned out ok. We spent time together over the holidays, Henri and Marc weren\u2019t around as much, but that just allowed the three of us to become closer which was a good thing, at first. Once sixth year started, I could sort of sense a shift, though I just thought it was because of Henri and Marc. It started to become apparent to me midway through the year that it wasn\u2019t about Henri and Marc, it was about Eliott and me. He\u2019d\u2026 developed feelings for me. I thought if I ignored it, or gave him subtle hints that it was never going to happen, that it would go away, and for a time I thought it did. But then he kissed me, out of the blue one day when he\u2019d invited me alone to help him study. I\u2013 I didn\u2019t handle things well. I don\u2019t even remember what I said, but I pushed him away from me and left him there, alone. I felt bad about it after, of course I did, there were so many better ways to handle it, so I decided next time I saw him I would apologize.</p><p>\u201cOnly, he didn\u2019t come back to our room that night or the next, didn\u2019t come to classes either. Sofiane and I got worried that maybe he was depressed again, but then all of a sudden he showed up again, looking and acting like nothing had happened. He was smiling a lot, talking about how every day was the best of his life and we knew that he wasn\u2019t sleeping at night. None of us had ever seen him manic before, except Lucille, so we didn\u2019t know it was happening. She didn\u2019t either, until it went too far.\u201d Idriss paused and looked over at Lucas. He was doing his best to maintain a guise of calm, but he was worried that he was Eliott\u2019s replacement Idriss, just one that had been stupid enough to fall in love. </p><p>\u201cYou know he can speak parseltongue, yeah?\u201d Idriss asked. Lucas nodded, thinking about Brian, whom he had refused over and over to \u2018meet\u2019, no matter how many times Eliott begged. \u201cI can speak parseltongue too, only I was born able to speak it.\u201d</p><p>There was a flash in Lucas\u2019 mind of him and Eliott lying on the floor of the charms classroom, of Eliott sitting up abruptly, talking about how he hadn\u2019t always known how to speak parseltongue, how he\u2019d had an old friend who could. \u201cI still don\u2019t know how he learned,\u201d Idriss continued, \u201cAll I know is one day he started speaking to me in parseltongue like it was the most normal thing in the world and he was so happy with himself for learning it. It had taken him two days, <i>two days</i>, to learn a whole language that I\u2019d thought was unlearnable. We really should have seen what was going on, but again, we ignored it. That was when he started his great Instagram escapade too, insisting that it was the future of wizard communication and that it would be a good way to remember our time at school. The idea spread like wildfire, and suddenly Eliott was one of the most popular people at the school. It wasn\u2019t that he hadn\u2019t been before, but now <i>everyone</i> knew him, or wanted to.</p><p>\u201cThis was when Henri and Marc started spreading around that he was crazy. Some people believed it, some people didn\u2019t, and Sofiane, Lucille, and I did our best to quell the rumors, but they stuck. I\u2019m not sure whether he ever knew what everyone was saying about him or not, whether he even cared given the space he was in mentally, but it only made everyone more interested in him. One night, he didn\u2019t come back to the room again, and we got worried. That was when we checked where we knew he kept his meds and realized he must not have been taking them all year. Basically, we freaked the fuck out, called Lucille, but she didn\u2019t know where he was either\u2026\u201d Idriss trailed off and looked Lucas dead in the eye. \u201cDo you really want to know why he got expelled?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure whether or not he was lying. </p><p>\u201cHe started a livestream on Instagram, which seemed normal, at first, but we didn\u2019t know where the fuck he was. There\u2019s a bridge, leading up to the school, and he was underneath it, with about twenty cans of paint and his phone, letting the world know exactly what he was doing. All he said before he started painting was \u2018This is for you\u2019, and I knew he was talking to me. I\u2019m not sure if it was meant to be an apology or a way to win me over, but he started making a massive painting, right on the underbelly of the bridge. Suddenly the livestream numbers jumped from twenty, to five hundred, to four thousand, and so on. His livestream lasted for about twenty hours, and it was a weekend, so everyone watched the whole time. We still didn\u2019t know where he was at that point, so we couldn\u2019t stop him. </p><p>\u201cHis Instagram follower count went from four hundred to nearly six hundred thousand overnight, and there was even more people than that watching his livestream. Everyone was trying to figure out if it was some kind of joke or if he was insane. He was talking wildly the entire time, mostly to himself, but they were all eating it up. It might have all been ok, if he hadn\u2019t started using magic. The majority of the people watching were muggles, they weren\u2019t supposed to know about magic. He\u2019d broken the international statute of secrecy in a huge way. The headmaster found him eventually, and that\u2019s when the livestream cut out. Next thing we all knew Eliott had been expelled and sent from the school. I\u2019d wondered why they hadn\u2019t made him snap his wand but Lucille told me later that he\u2019d snapped it himself in a rage over what he considered a major injustice. <i>Why shouldn\u2019t the muggles know about magic? Why should we keep it all to ourselves?</i> I think the only reason everything blew over was because his parents came and explained the situation to the headmaster, but it didn\u2019t make much difference in the end. His Instagram was deactivated and he stopped talking to everyone but Lucille and wizards all over the world had to obliviate every muggle who\u2019d seen or heard of his livestream. The followers he has now are all wizards, thankfully, though I\u2019m not sure the French ministry would be too pleased to know that he\u2019s using Instagram again.\u201d Idriss took a break from speaking for a moment, running his hand over his buzzed hair. </p><p>When he spoke again his voice was oddly flat, like he was trying very hard not to have an emotional reaction. \u201cDuring the time he was expelled he tried to kill himself.\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019 head snapped to attention and his fists clenched the sheets beneath him. \u201cHe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thought we all hated him, that he was all alone, that no one would ever love him. Sofiane and I tried to reach out, but his parents always stopped us, so we had no way of knowing how deep he\u2019d sunk into the hole inside himself. They only told Lucille when it happened. She left school right away to visit him, and we tried to come too, but she insisted again that we didn\u2019t understand, that it would only make him feel worse. That was the last either of us heard anything about him until he reactivated his Instagram. Well, Imane told me he\u2019d started here, though, if I\u2019m being honest, I was reluctant to believe it. But yeah, I guess that\u2019s where my story ends and yours begins,\u201d Idriss finished, hesitation evident in his tone of voice, trying to gauge how Lucas would react. Lucas wasn\u2019t sure himself. </p><p>He laid back against the headboard, mulling over his thoughts in his mind. In some ways, he understood better why Eliott hadn\u2019t told him. He must have thought that all of his friends had abandoned him after everything that happened, and didn\u2019t want to lose another. Did he really love Lucas, then, if he\u2019d done everything he\u2019d done not to lose him? </p><p>\u201cI want to see him,\u201d Lucas decided. Imane sat up and placed a hand on his shoulder. </p><p>\u201cAre you sure? This is probably a lot to take in, even I didn\u2019t know some of that.\u201d She eyed him with concern, and he felt a surge of appreciation for her. He placed his hand on hers and squeezed it once before removing it from his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d he said, then turned to Idriss. \u201cAnd thank you, for telling me. I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m sorry for how things turned out for you guys, but I hope things can be better in the future. I know I\u2019d really like to be friends with the two of you.\u201d</p><p>Sofiane smiled that same brilliant smile. \u201cSame here, Lucas.\u201d</p><p>Idriss simply nodded, which was confirmation enough, given all that he\u2019d shared. </p><p>\u201cDo you think\u2026 do you think he really loves me?\u201d Lucas asked before he could stop himself. Idriss smiled at last. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m certain of, it\u2019s that. From what I\u2019ve heard from Imane, and seen on his Instagram, you\u2019re his <i>person</i>, you know? If soulmates are real, I think you\u2019ve both found yours.\u201d</p><p>Lucas became aware of the tears sliding down his cheeks as he smiled, tasting the saltiness. He didn\u2019t know how long they\u2019d been falling, but assumed it had been a while and was grateful to Imane, Sofiane, and Idriss for not mentioning it. </p><p>Without another word, he slid off the bed and out the door to go run to the man he loved, the man of his dreams. The staircases all worked in his favor and there was no one around in the hallways to slow him down as he ran, not even aware of how fast or how far he\u2019d run. He got to the doors to the hospital wing and stopped abruptly, taking time to catch his breath and smooth down his hair. He was still wearing the same clothes he\u2019d worn Friday, but he didn\u2019t have time to change. </p><p>Pushing open the door, he nearly ran straight into Lucille, who blinked at him in shock. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked with a hard expression. </p><p>\u201cI need to see him. Is he all right?\u201d He tried to peek around her head to find Eliott, but he must have been farther down the wing, somewhere he couldn\u2019t see. </p><p>\u201cLucas, you need to leave,\u201d she told him. </p><p>\u201cWhy.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question, not really. </p><p>She brushed her fingers through the ends of her hair, sighing. \u201cHe\u2019s coming down right now. <i>Down</i>, down, and he hates people seeing him like this. Trust me, I\u2019ve been there every time he\u2019s gone through this, I know what to do, you don\u2019t need to worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2013\u201d he cut off in frustration, \u201cI mean, I <i>am</i> worried, but not because I think you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. You need to leave later today, and he needs someone to be there for him. I <i>want</i> to be there for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d she said simply. </p><p>\u201cAnd why not?\u201d he laughed crudely. </p><p>\u201cBecause he has to come to <i>you</i>. If you\u2019re there before he\u2019s ready it will only make it worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that for sure? Did he tell you he didn\u2019t want to see me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d </p><p>The word caught Lucas off balance. \u201cW-what?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flicked away from his quickly, like she couldn\u2019t bear to look at him. It made him think she might be lying, but there was nothing he could do about it. </p><p>He turned to leave, not knowing what else he could do, when his gaze snagged on a vase of flowers by the entrance. Feeling inspired, he conjured lilies, remembering how Eliott had smelled them in his amortentia, and handed them to Lucille, taking a moment to write out a note on one of the scrap papers from the hotel. He attached it to one of the flowers and addressed Lucille. \u201cPlease give these to him for me.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at the note once before meeting his eyes again. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI probably won\u2019t see you again before you leave, so have a safe trip back to France,\u201d he said a bit awkwardly. He didn\u2019t <i>really</i> want to be cordial to her, but he thought of how Lucille was Eliott\u2019s Manon and how he wouldn\u2019t want Eliott to completely eviscerate Manon if their roles were swapped. </p><p>She looked a bit surprised. \u201cThank you, Lucas. Goodbye.\u201d </p><p>Her goodbye had a finality to it, but he wasn\u2019t going to let her get off that easily. \u201cSee you later,\u201d he said, before turning on his heel, smirking to himself slightly before exiting the room and reflecting on the note he\u2019d written for Eliott. </p><p><i>Idriss told me about everything, I hope that was ok.

He&rsquo;d debated going to his safe place under the Quidditch stadium, but remembered that there was a match that weekend, which spoiled those plans. So, the Room of Requirement it was. He was lucky he knew how to work it so well, if anyone had been looking for him, they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get in. </p><p>His phone had died shortly after he&rsquo;d stumbled in here, drained after hours of fruitless research on bipolar disorder. He hadn&rsquo;t bothered to charge it since then, knowing that there would be numerous calls, messages, and Instagram posts waiting for him. All he wanted to do was lie there and stare at the ceiling, forgetting that the person he&rsquo;d thought he&rsquo;d spend the rest of his life with didn&rsquo;t actually love him. The things Lucille had said hadn&rsquo;t totally matched up to what he&rsquo;d read online, but he figured that she was probably more trustworthy than the internet, especially given how long she&rsquo;d known Eliott. </p><p>He groaned and covered his eyes with his hands, rubbing them as if that would make everything hurt less. Everything had been perfect, and now it was all wrecked. He should have known better, known things weren&rsquo;t going to last. Nothing in life came easily, and it was most often taken away before there was even a chance to enjoy it, at least in his experience. </p><p>He could bemoan his troubles all he wanted, but they really were minute compared to what Eliott must have been going through. It took a lot of his willpower to not go and demand to see him, knowing that wasn&rsquo;t going to help anything but wishing it would. Maybe Eliott didn&rsquo;t love him, but he loved Eliott so much he could feel it every time he pressed his hands to where his heart sat beneath his skin. Above all, he wanted Eliott to be ok, and that was what hurt most of all. </p><p>If only it was as easy to let go as it was to fall in love in the first place. </p><p>The sheets on the bed still smelled like Eliott, though Lucas assumed that was partly due to the room working its magic, reflecting his desires. It didn&rsquo;t matter the cause, Lucas buried his face in them regardless, imagining they were in a universe that Eliott had trusted him with this part of himself, that he hadn&rsquo;t felt like he&rsquo;d had to hide. </p><p>That was what bothered Lucas most of all about everything. He didn&rsquo;t care that Eliott was bipolar, not really. Being bipolar didn&rsquo;t mean that he couldn&rsquo;t love Lucas, as he&rsquo;d originally thought when Lucille had spoken to him. Lucille hadn&rsquo;t said that, she&rsquo;d said &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t he tell you why he&rsquo;d been expelled&rsquo;? and it had cut deeper than any knife. Eliott didn&rsquo;t not love him because he wasn&rsquo;t capable, he didn&rsquo;t love him because he felt like he couldn&rsquo;t trust him. Lucas had trusted Eliott with every part of him, even the parts he readily hid from everyone else, but Eliott hadn&rsquo;t felt that he could do the same. </p><p>He wondered if Eliott was still in the hospital wing, if they knew how to treat him properly. He supposed it was a good thing that Lucille was there that weekend, if she knew about his illness. Did Idriss and Sofiane know about it? Maybe they didn&rsquo;t, it could explain why Eliott was so adamant that they weren&rsquo;t friends when all evidence suggested otherwise. Idriss and Sofiane wouldn&rsquo;t have went out of their way for Lucas if they hadn&rsquo;t cared deeply for Eliott. </p><p>If their situations were reversed, would he have told Eliott? He&rsquo;d been trying to put himself into Eliott&rsquo;s shoes to no avail. <i>Of course</i>, his head told him, <i>of course you would have told him</i>, but he didn&rsquo;t know if it was true or just wishful thinking. </p><p>&ldquo;Lucas Lallemant!&rdquo; an angry voice yelled out of nowhere and Lucas shot up in bed, eyes wide and hair tangled. Imane stood at the foot of his bed, arms crossed. Behind her were Idriss and Sofiane, looking a tad bit more hesitant, like they weren&rsquo;t sure if they should be there or not. Come to think of it&hellip; how were they in there? He&rsquo;d been very specific with his instructions for the room.</p><p>&ldquo;How did you&hellip;?&rdquo; he asked blearily, blinking away tears he hadn&rsquo;t realized were close to falling from his eyes. Imane rolled her eyes and sat on the edge of the bed. </p><p>&ldquo;Please, did you really think I wouldn&rsquo;t figure out how to get in?&rdquo;</p><p>Fair enough. He should have known better than to underestimate Imane. &ldquo;But why are you here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m supposed to let you hide away in here, avoiding the world forever? What kind of friend would I be if I did that?&rdquo; Her voice was so stern that he almost didn&rsquo;t realize what she&rsquo;d said.</p><p>His face split into a hesitant grin. &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re friends, are we?&rdquo;</p><p>Her eyes softened at his smile, even as she leaned over and hit the side of his head. &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; he exclaimed, bringing his hands up to defend himself if need be. </p><p>&ldquo;Of course we&rsquo;re friends you dumbass.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me if you&rsquo;re sending some mixed signals,&rdquo; he said rubbing the side of his head. Sofiane smirked softly behind her, bringing Lucas&rsquo; attention back to them, why they were there. </p><p>He dropped his eyes to the sheets in front of him, a tad embarrassed for what they&rsquo;d had to deal with. &ldquo;Thank you guys, for the other night. I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip; I was&hellip; I don&rsquo;t even know. But thank you,&rdquo; he brought his eyes up to meet Idriss&rsquo;, then Sofiane&rsquo;s, &ldquo;Seriously.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it,&rdquo; Sofiane said with his megawatt smile. Now that the situation was a tad less dire, Lucas found himself taking in every inch of Sofiane&rsquo;s appearance. He had nothing on Eliott, of course, but still, he was quite the view. Idriss wasn&rsquo;t so bad himself, but he knew Imane would kill him if he ever said anything, so he stayed quiet. </p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s Eliott?&rdquo; he asked softly, noticing how Sofiane&rsquo;s smile dimmed slightly. He sat on the bed beside Imane and Lucas saw her body language shift with him so close to her. If the circumstances were different, he might have inquired about it. </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not great,&rdquo; Sofiane said candidly, &ldquo;Lucille&rsquo;s the only person he lets see him, but from what she&rsquo;s told us, he&rsquo;s coming down, regretting things.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas felt his heart clench painfully at the mention of Lucille. Had Eliott lied to him about her too? Was she more important in his life than he&rsquo;d insinuated? As if anticipating his question, Sofiane continued, &ldquo;Lucille and Eliott are like siblings. They love like them, fight like them. None of us have ever been able to touch their relationship, and we didn&rsquo;t want to. What they have with each other is special, but it&rsquo;s nothing like what I&rsquo;m sure you two have with each other, ok? Manon&rsquo;s your sister, right? Lucille being with Eliott would be like Manon being with you.&rdquo;</p><p>There was a lot of information that Lucas was trying to take in, so he couldn&rsquo;t mumble anything other than, &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m gay?&rdquo;</p><p>Needless to say, Imane hit him again, but this time she was smiling and she sank onto the pillow beside him. Sofiane reached up to scratch his head before looking at Lucas earnestly. &ldquo;We had no idea that you didn&rsquo;t know he was bipolar. I assume that&rsquo;s why you ran off after you talked to Lucille?&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas nodded. Sofiane grimaced. &ldquo;We love Lucille, we do, but she can be a bit&hellip; direct at times.&rdquo;</p><p>Idriss snorted from where he was leaning against one of the walls. &ldquo;Understatement of the century.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Regardless,&rdquo; Sofiane shot Idriss an unamused glance before returning his attention to Lucas, &ldquo;We know firsthand how it can be&hellip; a lot to take in at first. But it doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s less of a person than you thought he was.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas shook his head immediately. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t walk away because she said he was bipolar. I don&rsquo;t care about that. My&ndash; my birth mother, she was schizophrenic, and I feel guilty every day that I wasn&rsquo;t able to be there for her, that I didn&rsquo;t know what was going on until it was too late. I know that Eliott is still Eliott, no matter what.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then why are you hiding?&rdquo; Imane asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Because he doesn&rsquo;t love me, and I don&rsquo;t know how to go about my life trying to stop loving him.&rdquo;</p><p>Idriss folded his arms over his chest. &ldquo;You think because he&rsquo;s bipolar he can&rsquo;t love you? Trust me, that&rsquo;s not the case.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not what I&ndash;&rdquo; Lucas began, interrupted by Sofiane. </p><p>&ldquo;He feels more than any of us, loves harder than we could even begin to comprehend. I wouldn&rsquo;t count him out just yet.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas cut back in, trying to explain himself. &ldquo;I know that. Well, I guess I didn&rsquo;t totally know <i>that</i>, but I knew he was capable of love. Of course he is. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;ve seen him fall in love with a flower, with a door handle. I trusted him with my entire life, tragic backstory and all, but I never would have even known the two of you existed if I wasn&rsquo;t friends with Imane. How can he say he loves me, and how can I believe him, if he doesn&rsquo;t trust me at all?&rdquo;</p><p>Sofiane and Idriss exchanged a glance with one another. He hadn&rsquo;t meant to completely unload everything onto them, but it had felt too good to stop. The fact that they weren&rsquo;t saying anything told him that he wasn&rsquo;t completely off base either. Sofiane and Idriss seemed to come to some sort of silent understanding, Sofiane speaking at last. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t tell you anything?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Lucas&rsquo; voice broke at the end of the word, shattering with the last bit of his heart. Imane snapped her head in his direction. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t tell you why he was expelled?&rdquo; she asked. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he repeated, just as broken. </p><p>&ldquo;I feel like it&rsquo;s Eliott&rsquo;s prerogative to tell you or not to tell you, but&hellip;&rdquo; Sofiane trailed off, standing up from the bed, pacing. &ldquo;I also feel like you have a right to know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Lucas repeated one more time, but this time he was resigned to it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s his story to tell. If I never know&hellip; then I never know. I&rsquo;m not entitled to anything.&rdquo;</p><p>Sofiane glanced at Idriss. &ldquo;Well, the thing is&hellip; it&rsquo;s kind of our story to tell as well. Idriss&rsquo;, at the very least. If we tell you, it might help you to be there for him in the way that we weren&rsquo;t. It haunts us every day too, you know. &rdquo;</p><p>Lucas looked up sharply first at Idriss, then at Imane, who nodded. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you say anything?&rdquo; he asked her. She shrugged. &ldquo;Like you said, it isn&rsquo;t my story to tell. Plus, I assumed he&rsquo;d told you, especially after the mural.&rdquo;</p><p>He stared at his hands in his lap for a moment. Of course he would have preferred if Eliott told him these things, but at this rate he didn&rsquo;t know if Eliott would ever talk to him again, and maybe hearing Idriss&rsquo; story could help him figure out what to do next. &ldquo;Ok,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re willing to tell me, I&rsquo;m willing to listen.&rdquo;</p><p>Idriss took a breath in and out, glancing at his sister, then Sofiane, before beginning, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m assuming he didn&rsquo;t tell you this, but at Beauxbatons we were best friends. Him, me, Sofiane, and two other guys who we don&rsquo;t really talk to anymore. They treated Eliott different after he was diagnosed and even more so after everything else that happened. A lot of people at school were like that, actually.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas thought back to some comments he and Eliott had received on their Instagram posts occasionally, but especially following their time painting the mural. Eliott had brushed them off at the time, and Lucas hadn&rsquo;t thought too much about it, but maybe it was somewhat relevant to what Idriss was telling him. </p><p>&ldquo;Wizards don&rsquo;t understand mental illness,&rdquo; Idriss continued, and Lucas nodded grimly. He knew firsthand just how much wizards didn&rsquo;t understand mental illness. &ldquo;He wanted to keep it a secret, only the five of us and Lucille knew, other than his parents, obviously. Honestly, he probably only told us about it because his therapist had told him to tell <i>someone</i>, and it&rsquo;s not like we wouldn&rsquo;t have noticed if he was depressed or manic over time, especially living in the same room. He was diagnosed when we were fifteen, the summer before fifth year. Apparently he&rsquo;d had a pretty bad manic episode over the summer holidays that led to his diagnosis, according to Lucille. She was the only one he saw that whole summer. When he came back to school, everything was chill. He told us about his diagnosis a few months in, and we were all there for him. Sofiane and I are muggle born as well, so we sort of knew about mental illnesses, but Henri and Marc were mostly clueless&ndash; Henri and Marc were our other friends, by the way&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>It had to be the two Lucas had seen on Instagram. Henririen and theoneandonly. He should have blocked them. </p><p>&ldquo;&ndash;because they&rsquo;d grown up in predominantly wizarding families. They were supportive at first, especially because Eliott seemed the same as always. Then, about a quarter through fifth year, he had a major depressive episode. He wouldn&rsquo;t eat, get out of bed, talk to us, anything, no matter what we tried. He came out of it after about a month, and it slowly got better and better over the course of a few more months, but somehow the dynamic between us all had shifted. Henri and Marc were distant, would make snide comments here and there because they just didn&rsquo;t understand. Lucille was with him all the time because she insisted that she was the only one who could really understand him. That kind of pissed off Sof and I, but we let it slide because Eliott&rsquo;s well-being was more important than our pride.&rdquo;</p><p>How had Eliott ever let friends like these go? What the hell had happened? </p><p>&ldquo;Listen, Lucas, when I tell you the rest, I promise you that it was all way in the past, ok? Nothing lingering from back then. No&hellip; feelings of any kind.&rdquo; Idriss was nearly pleading, which worried Lucas, but he wanted to know the rest so he just said he understood and nodded for Idriss to continue. </p><p>&ldquo;Ok,&rdquo; Idriss nodded, &ldquo;Well, after fifth year, everything turned out ok. We spent time together over the holidays, Henri and Marc weren&rsquo;t around as much, but that just allowed the three of us to become closer which was a good thing, at first. Once sixth year started, I could sort of sense a shift, though I just thought it was because of Henri and Marc. It started to become apparent to me midway through the year that it wasn&rsquo;t about Henri and Marc, it was about Eliott and me. He&rsquo;d&hellip; developed feelings for me. I thought if I ignored it, or gave him subtle hints that it was never going to happen, that it would go away, and for a time I thought it did. But then he kissed me, out of the blue one day when he&rsquo;d invited me alone to help him study. I&ndash; I didn&rsquo;t handle things well. I don&rsquo;t even remember what I said, but I pushed him away from me and left him there, alone. I felt bad about it after, of course I did, there were so many better ways to handle it, so I decided next time I saw him I would apologize.</p><p>&ldquo;Only, he didn&rsquo;t come back to our room that night or the next, didn&rsquo;t come to classes either. Sofiane and I got worried that maybe he was depressed again, but then all of a sudden he showed up again, looking and acting like nothing had happened. He was smiling a lot, talking about how every day was the best of his life and we knew that he wasn&rsquo;t sleeping at night. None of us had ever seen him manic before, except Lucille, so we didn&rsquo;t know it was happening. She didn&rsquo;t either, until it went too far.&rdquo; Idriss paused and looked over at Lucas. He was doing his best to maintain a guise of calm, but he was worried that he was Eliott&rsquo;s replacement Idriss, just one that had been stupid enough to fall in love. </p><p>&ldquo;You know he can speak parseltongue, yeah?&rdquo; Idriss asked. Lucas nodded, thinking about Brian, whom he had refused over and over to &lsquo;meet&rsquo;, no matter how many times Eliott begged. &ldquo;I can speak parseltongue too, only I was born able to speak it.&rdquo;</p><p>There was a flash in Lucas&rsquo; mind of him and Eliott lying on the floor of the charms classroom, of Eliott sitting up abruptly, talking about how he hadn&rsquo;t always known how to speak parseltongue, how he&rsquo;d had an old friend who could. &ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t know how he learned,&rdquo; Idriss continued, &ldquo;All I know is one day he started speaking to me in parseltongue like it was the most normal thing in the world and he was so happy with himself for learning it. It had taken him two days, <i>two days</i>, to learn a whole language that I&rsquo;d thought was unlearnable. We really should have seen what was going on, but again, we ignored it. That was when he started his great Instagram escapade too, insisting that it was the future of wizard communication and that it would be a good way to remember our time at school. The idea spread like wildfire, and suddenly Eliott was one of the most popular people at the school. It wasn&rsquo;t that he hadn&rsquo;t been before, but now <i>everyone</i> knew him, or wanted to.</p><p>&ldquo;This was when Henri and Marc started spreading around that he was crazy. Some people believed it, some people didn&rsquo;t, and Sofiane, Lucille, and I did our best to quell the rumors, but they stuck. I&rsquo;m not sure whether he ever knew what everyone was saying about him or not, whether he even cared given the space he was in mentally, but it only made everyone more interested in him. One night, he didn&rsquo;t come back to the room again, and we got worried. That was when we checked where we knew he kept his meds and realized he must not have been taking them all year. Basically, we freaked the fuck out, called Lucille, but she didn&rsquo;t know where he was either&hellip;&rdquo; Idriss trailed off and looked Lucas dead in the eye. &ldquo;Do you really want to know why he got expelled?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He wasn&rsquo;t sure whether or not he was lying. </p><p>&ldquo;He started a livestream on Instagram, which seemed normal, at first, but we didn&rsquo;t know where the fuck he was. There&rsquo;s a bridge, leading up to the school, and he was underneath it, with about twenty cans of paint and his phone, letting the world know exactly what he was doing. All he said before he started painting was &lsquo;This is for you&rsquo;, and I knew he was talking to me. I&rsquo;m not sure if it was meant to be an apology or a way to win me over, but he started making a massive painting, right on the underbelly of the bridge. Suddenly the livestream numbers jumped from twenty, to five hundred, to four thousand, and so on. His livestream lasted for about twenty hours, and it was a weekend, so everyone watched the whole time. We still didn&rsquo;t know where he was at that point, so we couldn&rsquo;t stop him. </p><p>&ldquo;His Instagram follower count went from four hundred to nearly six hundred thousand overnight, and there was even more people than that watching his livestream. Everyone was trying to figure out if it was some kind of joke or if he was insane. He was talking wildly the entire time, mostly to himself, but they were all eating it up. It might have all been ok, if he hadn&rsquo;t started using magic. The majority of the people watching were muggles, they weren&rsquo;t supposed to know about magic. He&rsquo;d broken the international statute of secrecy in a huge way. The headmaster found him eventually, and that&rsquo;s when the livestream cut out. Next thing we all knew Eliott had been expelled and sent from the school. I&rsquo;d wondered why they hadn&rsquo;t made him snap his wand but Lucille told me later that he&rsquo;d snapped it himself in a rage over what he considered a major injustice. <i>Why shouldn&rsquo;t the muggles know about magic? Why should we keep it all to ourselves?</i> I think the only reason everything blew over was because his parents came and explained the situation to the headmaster, but it didn&rsquo;t make much difference in the end. His Instagram was deactivated and he stopped talking to everyone but Lucille and wizards all over the world had to obliviate every muggle who&rsquo;d seen or heard of his livestream. The followers he has now are all wizards, thankfully, though I&rsquo;m not sure the French ministry would be too pleased to know that he&rsquo;s using Instagram again.&rdquo; Idriss took a break from speaking for a moment, running his hand over his buzzed hair. </p><p>When he spoke again his voice was oddly flat, like he was trying very hard not to have an emotional reaction. &ldquo;During the time he was expelled he tried to kill himself.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas&rsquo; head snapped to attention and his fists clenched the sheets beneath him. &ldquo;He what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He thought we all hated him, that he was all alone, that no one would ever love him. Sofiane and I tried to reach out, but his parents always stopped us, so we had no way of knowing how deep he&rsquo;d sunk into the hole inside himself. They only told Lucille when it happened. She left school right away to visit him, and we tried to come too, but she insisted again that we didn&rsquo;t understand, that it would only make him feel worse. That was the last either of us heard anything about him until he reactivated his Instagram. Well, Imane told me he&rsquo;d started here, though, if I&rsquo;m being honest, I was reluctant to believe it. But yeah, I guess that&rsquo;s where my story ends and yours begins,&rdquo; Idriss finished, hesitation evident in his tone of voice, trying to gauge how Lucas would react. Lucas wasn&rsquo;t sure himself. </p><p>He laid back against the headboard, mulling over his thoughts in his mind. In some ways, he understood better why Eliott hadn&rsquo;t told him. He must have thought that all of his friends had abandoned him after everything that happened, and didn&rsquo;t want to lose another. Did he really love Lucas, then, if he&rsquo;d done everything he&rsquo;d done not to lose him? </p><p>&ldquo;I want to see him,&rdquo; Lucas decided. Imane sat up and placed a hand on his shoulder. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure? This is probably a lot to take in, even I didn&rsquo;t know some of that.&rdquo; She eyed him with concern, and he felt a surge of appreciation for her. He placed his hand on hers and squeezed it once before removing it from his shoulder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; he said, then turned to Idriss. &ldquo;And thank you, for telling me. I&rsquo;m&hellip; I&rsquo;m sorry for how things turned out for you guys, but I hope things can be better in the future. I know I&rsquo;d really like to be friends with the two of you.&rdquo;</p><p>Sofiane smiled that same brilliant smile. &ldquo;Same here, Lucas.&rdquo;</p><p>Idriss simply nodded, which was confirmation enough, given all that he&rsquo;d shared. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you think&hellip; do you think he really loves me?&rdquo; Lucas asked before he could stop himself. Idriss smiled at last. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;m certain of, it&rsquo;s that. From what I&rsquo;ve heard from Imane, and seen on his Instagram, you&rsquo;re his <i>person</i>, you know? If soulmates are real, I think you&rsquo;ve both found yours.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas became aware of the tears sliding down his cheeks as he smiled, tasting the saltiness. He didn&rsquo;t know how long they&rsquo;d been falling, but assumed it had been a while and was grateful to Imane, Sofiane, and Idriss for not mentioning it. </p><p>Without another word, he slid off the bed and out the door to go run to the man he loved, the man of his dreams. The staircases all worked in his favor and there was no one around in the hallways to slow him down as he ran, not even aware of how fast or how far he&rsquo;d run. He got to the doors to the hospital wing and stopped abruptly, taking time to catch his breath and smooth down his hair. He was still wearing the same clothes he&rsquo;d worn Friday, but he didn&rsquo;t have time to change. </p><p>Pushing open the door, he nearly ran straight into Lucille, who blinked at him in shock. &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; she asked with a hard expression. </p><p>&ldquo;I need to see him. Is he all right?&rdquo; He tried to peek around her head to find Eliott, but he must have been farther down the wing, somewhere he couldn&rsquo;t see. </p><p>&ldquo;Lucas, you need to leave,&rdquo; she told him. </p><p>&ldquo;Why.&rdquo; It wasn&rsquo;t a question, not really. </p><p>She brushed her fingers through the ends of her hair, sighing. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming down right now. <i>Down</i>, down, and he hates people seeing him like this. Trust me, I&rsquo;ve been there every time he&rsquo;s gone through this, I know what to do, you don&rsquo;t need to worry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not&ndash;&rdquo; he cut off in frustration, &ldquo;I mean, I <i>am</i> worried, but not because I think you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing. You need to leave later today, and he needs someone to be there for him. I <i>want</i> to be there for him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said simply. </p><p>&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; he laughed crudely. </p><p>&ldquo;Because he has to come to <i>you</i>. If you&rsquo;re there before he&rsquo;s ready it will only make it worse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you know that for sure? Did he tell you he didn&rsquo;t want to see me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; </p><p>The word caught Lucas off balance. &ldquo;W-what?&rdquo;</p><p>Her gaze flicked away from his quickly, like she couldn&rsquo;t bear to look at him. It made him think she might be lying, but there was nothing he could do about it. </p><p>He turned to leave, not knowing what else he could do, when his gaze snagged on a vase of flowers by the entrance. Feeling inspired, he conjured lilies, remembering how Eliott had smelled them in his amortentia, and handed them to Lucille, taking a moment to write out a note on one of the scrap papers from the hotel. He attached it to one of the flowers and addressed Lucille. &ldquo;Please give these to him for me.&rdquo;</p><p>She glanced down at the note once before meeting his eyes again. &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I probably won&rsquo;t see you again before you leave, so have a safe trip back to France,&rdquo; he said a bit awkwardly. He didn&rsquo;t <i>really</i> want to be cordial to her, but he thought of how Lucille was Eliott&rsquo;s Manon and how he wouldn&rsquo;t want Eliott to completely eviscerate Manon if their roles were swapped. </p><p>She looked a bit surprised. &ldquo;Thank you, Lucas. Goodbye.&rdquo; </p><p>Her goodbye had a finality to it, but he wasn&rsquo;t going to let her get off that easily. &ldquo;See you later,&rdquo; he said, before turning on his heel, smirking to himself slightly before exiting the room and reflecting on the note he&rsquo;d written for Eliott. </p><p><i>Idriss told me about everything, I hope that was ok. Just know that I&rsquo;ll be here when you&rsquo;re ready. Promise. -Lucas</i></p><p>He hoped it was enough, but it was all he could do at this point. </p><p>Hope. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ca2a157f5b1c41d718596bb82b750016/tumblr_inline_prf00qF56a1v7op4y_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b><a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/183588080626/la-fin-des-temps-chapter-1-mercredi\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 1</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/183725050441/la-fin-des-temps-chapter-2-hogwarts-au\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 2</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/183824145246/la-fin-des-temps-chapter-3-elu-hogwarts-au\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 3</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/183876195116/la-fin-des-temps-chapter-4-elu-hogwarts-au\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 4</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/183992139736/la-fin-des-temps-chapter-5-elu-hogwarts-au\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 5</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184063483831/la-fin-des-temps-chapter-6-elu-hogwarts-au\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 6</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184136608806/la-fin-des-temps-chapter-7-elu-hogwarts-au\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 7 </a><a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184252745791/la-fin-des-temps-chapter-8-elu-hogwarts-au\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 8</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184302738501/la-fin-des-temps-chapter-9-elu-hogwarts-au\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 9</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184322267426/la-fin-des-temps-chapter-10-elu-hogwarts-au\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 10</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184392719146/la-fin-des-temps-chapter-11-elu-hogwarts-au\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 11</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184491892511/la-fin-des-temps-chapter-12-elu-hogwarts-au\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 12</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184583337071/la-fin-des-temps-chapter-13-elu-hogwarts-au\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 13</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184627502876/la-fin-des-temps-chapter-14-elu-hogwarts-au\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 14</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184762316386/la-fin-des-temps-chapter-15-elu-hogwarts-au\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 15</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184788307416/la-fin-des-temps-chapter-16-elu-hogwarts-au\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 16</a></b></p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F18189278%2Fchapters%2F43024613&amp;t=MTVlY2VhNjhhNmUxMTNiOGQ1NWY5M2U5MTY1YjYwMTdmNGI2OGQ3ZCxJNGZtQ1RybQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A59r44GdNvhhBBAvLv5EYvg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Flivvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F184302738501%2Fla-fin-des-temps-chapter-9-elu-hogwarts-au&amp;m=1\" target=\"_blank\"><b>AO3</b></a></p><p>Weekly Instagram Roundup: <b><a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/183852238846/la-fin-des-temps-weekly-instagram-roundup\" target=\"_blank\">Week 1</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184021001261/la-fin-des-temps-weekly-instagram-roundup\" target=\"_blank\">Week 2</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184184560651/la-fin-des-temps-weekly-instagram-roundup\" target=\"_blank\">Week 3</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184348714576/la-fin-des-temps-weekly-instagram-roundup\" target=\"_blank\">Week 4</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184512062926/la-fin-des-temps-weekly-instagram-roundup\" target=\"_blank\">Week 5</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184675094376/la-fin-des-temps-weekly-instagram-roundup\" target=\"_blank\">Week 6</a> <a href=\"https://livvyblxckthxrn.tumblr.com/post/184834448471/la-fin-des-temps-weekly-instagram-roundup\" target=\"_blank\">Week 7</a>&nbsp;</b></p>",

He&rsquo;d debated going to his safe place under the Quidditch stadium, but remembered that there was a match that weekend, which spoiled those plans. So, the Room of Requirement it was. He was lucky he knew how to work it so well, if anyone had been looking for him, they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get in. </p>\n<p>His phone had died shortly after he&rsquo;d stumbled in here, drained after hours of fruitless research on bipolar disorder. He hadn&rsquo;t bothered to charge it since then, knowing that there would be numerous calls, messages, and Instagram posts waiting for him. All he wanted to do was lie there and stare at the ceiling, forgetting that the person he&rsquo;d thought he&rsquo;d spend the rest of his life with didn&rsquo;t actually love him. The things Lucille had said hadn&rsquo;t totally matched up to what he&rsquo;d read online, but he figured that she was probably more trustworthy than the internet, especially given how long she&rsquo;d known Eliott. </p>\n<p>He groaned and covered his eyes with his hands, rubbing them as if that would make everything hurt less. Everything had been perfect, and now it was all wrecked. He should have known better, known things weren&rsquo;t going to last. Nothing in life came easily, and it was most often taken away before there was even a chance to enjoy it, at least in his experience. </p>\n<p>He could bemoan his troubles all he wanted, but they really were minute compared to what Eliott must have been going through. It took a lot of his willpower to not go and demand to see him, knowing that wasn&rsquo;t going to help anything but wishing it would. Maybe Eliott didn&rsquo;t love him, but he loved Eliott so much he could feel it every time he pressed his hands to where his heart sat beneath his skin. Above all, he wanted Eliott to be ok, and that was what hurt most of all. </p>\n</p>",

I don\u2019t know I just- don\u2019t share food.\u201d the boy shrugged his shoulders, \u201cI really didn\u2019t mean to hurt you man, are you okay?\u201d And yeah, no one could resist those blue puppy eyes that were so full of guilt at the moment.</p><p>Yann rubbed Eliott\u2019s shoulder and smiled at him, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Just warn us about anything else that might cause a beating, yeah?\u201d Chuckles resonated throughout the table until another body gracelessly plopped into the chair across from Eliott. Lucas slumped over the table and buried his face into his arms without even a glance to the boys.</p><p>\u201cHey Lulu, you alright?\u201d Arthur asked as he rubbed slow circles into the brunette\u2019s back. The boy didn\u2019t even bother to lift his head as he started grumbling into his folded arms. \u201cGonna have to sit up man.\u201d</p><p>Lucas grunted and slowly sat up and back into his chair. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I fucking bombed this exam even though I was studying <i>all night</i> and fuck I really need to get my damn grade up and this is not helping, I stayed up all night for literally nothing and I\u2019m ready to crawl into bed and sleep for three years because temporary death has never sounded so sweet.\u201d</p><p>As his rant went on he casually reached across the table to Eliott\u2019s tray, picked up the chocolate pudding from the corner of it and began spooning it into his mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t know guys I\u2019m just really tired and honestly am on the verge of a breakdown, but what else is new?\u201d he shrugged his shoulders, mouth full of half swallowed pudding. He lifted his head to three sets of eyes baring into his soul, eyebrows raising as his friends snapped their eyes from him to Eliott in front of him. </p><p>\u201cLulu, light of our lives, our moon and stars, our love. You might wanna put that down.\u201d Basile spoke warily.</p><p>Lucas furrowed his brow and shifted his gaze to each of his friends questioningly. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean that if you value your hand, <i>please</i> put down that pudding right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah dude, Eliott literally just slap-\u201c the blonde at the table began until the boy in question rapidly began to shake his head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Eliott tapped his fingers against the table in an unsteady beat.</p><p>\u201cWhat?

It never bothered me when you stole my food? It was cute and you know, I wasn\u2019t gonna say no to you.\u201d The flush in his cheeks intensified as all the boys let out an \u2018awww\u2019.</p><p>Lucas smirked and lifted his hand to his boyfriend\u2019s red face to pinch his cheek. \u201cAww, babe, that\u2019s so sweet.\u201d He cooed as Eliott huffed, scowling under the scrutiny of his friends and boyfriend. Lucas smiled and reached over to take the exact crouton Arthur went for earlier and tossed it into his mouth, humming as he chewed and swallowed it. The gang glared at him and he settled into Eliott\u2019s side, continuing to diminish his boyfriend\u2019s plate over the next hour they were there.
