Just a cute fic where Alain proposes to Mairin. Nothing could go wrong.</p><hr><p><br/></p><p>Alain\u2019s hands were shaking.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter how he held them, if he stuffed his hands away into his pockets or laced his fingers tightly together\u2013 there was still a tremble as he stood there, waiting. His mind was humming, every possible doubt crawling into his head. His mouth was dry, making his nervous swallowing painful.</p><p>He slipped a hand into his pocket, fingers wrapping around the velvety box resting there. He glanced around for a moment, before pulling it out when he saw he was alone. It was small and black, fitting perfectly in the palm of his hand as he slowly opened the lid, already knowing what would be inside. His heart thumped nervously as he stared down at the small object, a wave of fear washing over him.</p><p>A slim silver ring gleamed up at him.</p><!-- more --><p>It was a sleek ring, the metal carefully twisted in an elegant pattern, carefully holding a beautifully cut emerald in place. Steven had the ring custom made, and Alain had spent several days trying to decide just what he wanted it to look like. The ring had to be beautiful, like her\u2013 but yet simple, since he knew she wouldn\u2019t want anything over the top. An emerald had been an easy choice, knowing her love for green, and he had felt that the silver suited the gem much nicer than gold.</p><p>It was just how he had pictured it, just how he had wanted it. He snapped the ring box shut, closing his eyes as his heart thundering in his chest. In the end it truly didn\u2019t matter how the ring looked or what had gone into it\u2013 the only thing that would matter was what she\u2019d say the moment he asked her the question.</p><p>\u201cWell, I must say this has been a marvelous evening so far,\u201d A cheerful voice said from behind him, causing Alain to pause from his worry, turning to glance over his shoulder.</p><p>Pale blue eyes met his icy eyes, an older man lingering by the doorway with a kind smile on his face. For a moment the panic rushing through Alain seemed to fade, the sight of the professor instantly bringing a sense of calm into the room. He turned to face his mentor, hastily stuffing the ring away, giving the man a brief smile.</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s been eventful,\u201d Alain said slowly, trying not to let his nervousness show. His words fell flat, his pale face and the waver in his voice giving away the emotions running through him.</p><p>Professor Sycamore sighed, his smiling fading, approaching Alain. \u201cAlain, please don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve been fretting this whole evening\u2013 you know this entire celebration is for you after all.\u201d</p><p>Shivers raced through him, a different kind of fear coming over Alain. \u201c&hellip;You mean it\u2019s a celebration in honour of stopping what I almost caused.\u201d</p><p>The professor frowned. \u201cAlain.\u201d</p><p>For a moment Alain felt like a child again, Sycamore using the same tone he often had when he was younger. He swiftly looked away and Sycamore placed a hand on his shoulder. \u201cS-sorry,\u201d Alain muttered. \u201cI know I\u2019m not supposed to think that way\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat took place was something you did not want to happen, and you did everything in your power to stop the Kalos Crisis\u2013 and succeeded. You\u2019re nothing but a hero, which is why you\u2019re here with the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>Ten years. It had been ten years today since the Kalos Crisis. An event that was still so vivid in his memory, one that still managed to find its way into his nightmares. He shifted uncertainly. Tonight had been one of mixed feelings for him. All of Lumiose had been celebrating Team Flare\u2019s fall throughout the entire day, a parade having even been held. Those who had been hailed as heroes, the ones who had played a role in the fall of the vile group, were seen as the honoured guests tonight.</p><p>Ash, Serena, Bonnie, Clemont\u2013 and all those who had been the gym leaders at the time. Diantha, Steven, and Malva. Jessie, James, Professor Sycamore, Meyer, Mairin&hellip;</p><p>And him.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about Malva?\u201d Professor Sycamore asked. \u201cDo you feel she deserves to be here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Alain said\u2013 it was impossible to forget her standing by his and Ash\u2019s side as they faced Lysandre.</p><p>\u201cThen if Malva, who actively knew what Flare\u2019s goals were, deserves to be here,\u201d Professor Sycamore began. \u201cThen why on earth wouldn\u2019t you\u2013 someone who was giving everything he had for what he believed to be peace\u2013 deserve to be here as well?\u201d He gave him a soft smile. \u201cYou have done nothing but good, Alain. You deserve to be called a hero.\u201d</p><p>Alain\u2019s throat felt tight. \u201cTh-thank you, Professor.\u201d</p><p>The professor clapped him on the back. \u201cThen why are we lingering back here? Let us join the others, embrace our old friends tonight, and wear the medals they have for us with honour!\u201d</p><p>\u201c&hellip;They have medals?\u201d</p><p>The professor paused. \u201c&hellip;I wasn\u2019t supposed to mention that. But yes, they do\u2013 the Lumiose mayor felt you guys didn\u2019t get enough recognition at the time, so&hellip; yeah. They have medals for us when we go on stage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they do&hellip;\u201d Alain muttered.</p><p>Professor Sycamore smirked slightly. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s why you\u2019re nervous though, is it?\u201d</p><p>A pink tinge came onto Alain\u2019s cheeks, and his heart once again began pounding in his chest. He opened his mouth to speak, but no words came to him for several seconds. Sycamore laughed, which wasn\u2019t helping Alain, and he swiftly looked away. Again his hand slipped into his pocket, touching the ring box.</p><p>\u201c&hellip;What if she says no?\u201d Alain whispered.</p><p>\u201cAnd just what reason would she have to say no?\u201d Sycamore asked, an arm around Alain\u2019s shoulder as he guided him towards the doorway. Alain dug in his heels, not ready to face what would be awaiting him outside. \u201cYou know Mairin loves you.\u201d</p><p>Mairin, just her name brought a smile to Alain\u2019s face. Despite his nerves, he had spent most of the celebration with her. She hadn\u2019t asked him why he had looked so on edge, most likely just assuming that the anniversary of what they were gathered for was the explanation for his attitude. And while it was most certainly affecting him, it was what question he\u2019d be asking his girlfriend tonight that was making him shake.</p><p>But hopefully she wouldn\u2019t just be his girlfriend after tonight.</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d Alain said. \u201cBut what if she doesn\u2019t feel ready for marriage? What if she doesn\u2019t want to get married? Or just doesn\u2019t want to get married to me\u2013?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see her face when she saw Serena\u2019s engagement ring?\u201d Sycamore asked, crossing his arms. \u201cOr her expression when she saw, um, what\u2019s her name&hellip; Jessie\u2019s wedding ring? Or how her and Bonnie just happen to go by wedding dress shops when they go out\u2013 and tend to discuss said dresses loudly when you happen to be in the room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, well\u2013\u201d Alain began, the Sycamore cut him off.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, my boy, the only thing Mairin is going to say to you is yes,\u201d Sycamore said, and he let out a hardy laugh. \u201cCome on now, we can\u2019t hide away in the gym forever\u2013 let\u2019s go enjoy the rest of the celebration!\u201d</p><p>Alain\u2019s heart was still thumping nervously, but yet the professor\u2019s words had brought a sense of calm to him. He had no reason to panic over what Mairin would say\u2013 he loved her, he trusted her\u2013 and he knew that she would always stand by his side. Today was a day to celebrate the fall of the ones he had feared, the day his close friends had become heros. Even if he still doubted if that title could be held by him, he didn\u2019t doubt that those like Mairin and Ash deserved it. He would stand with them, and join the rest of Lumiose and Kalos in celebrating what they achieved.</p><p>And then tonight, out on the stage with everyone else he held close, he would ask Mairin to marry him.</p><p>Today wasn\u2019t a day to fear.</p><hr><p>Lumiose City always looked beautiful at night\u2013 the whole city lit up, never sleeping\u2013 it was truly a sight to see. Alain had spent many years living here, but still he always appreciated what the capital had to offer.</p><p>But tonight was something else.</p><p>Seeing hundreds, maybe thousands of people gathered in the center of the city, filling the streets beyond\u2013 it was a breathtaking view. Prism Tower was lit up behind them, the base of the city\u2019s proud gym renovated into the stage that he and the others were standing on. Lights shone down onto them, making his eyes water from their intensity.</p><p>In front of him was the mayor of Lumiose, a plump and cheerful man who hadn\u2019t stopped smiling the entire night. He was currently speaking to the crowds watching them, hands moving with his enthusiasm as he spoke. Alain caught a few words, about the tragedy that had taken place a decade before, of the bravery the city had shown in such danger, but it was hard to focus on what was being said.</p><p>His eyes flickered off to his right, taking in the beautiful woman standing next to him.</p><p>Mairin had a smile on her face, but he could tell by the small twitch near the corner of her lips that she was uneasy with such a large crowd. Between now and the parade she had let her hair down from the tight bun she had in since this morning, her long red hair now cascading down her shoulders. Her fingers were nervously tracing the sequins in her navy blue dress, the lights from the stage causing them to gleam.</p><p>Mairin noticed his glance, her head turning to meet his gaze. Today was one of the few times he had ever seen her wear makeup, and Alain was sure that Serena and Bonnie must have insisted on it. What she wore was simple, almost barely noticeable, but it made her amber eyes pop. She gave him a small smile, grabbing his hand, before turning to look back at the crowd.</p><p>Suddenly the city seemed quite dull after \u00a0having looked at Mairin.</p><p>Mairin squeezed his hand, and he did so in return. The ring box hidden away in his pocket suddenly seemed much heavier, a reminder of what he would be doing in a short time. His heart thumped, but he forced his expression to remain composed as the mayor turned to face him and the others on stage.</p><p>\u201cThe first of who should be recognized,\u201d The mayor said, his voice echoing across the plaza. \u201cAre the gym leaders who fearlessly defended our region at the time!\u201d</p><p>Clemont and the other gym leaders stepped forward, and Alain studied them. Some, such as Ramos, had retired years before. Seeing the gym leaders he had grown up with all together once again was surreal. The crowd began cheering, and Alain put his own hands together as well, a smile tugging at his face.</p><p>As Professor Sycamore had said, several people stepped forward, presenting medals to the gym leaders. More clapping and cheering was heard, the eight gym leaders returning to their place in line. </p><p>The mayor began calling others forward\u2013 Ash and Serena, an extra loud cheer rushing out from the crowd when the mayor mentioned their engagement. Bonnie and her father\u2013 who\u2019d had his identity as the Blaziken Mask revealed years before. The married Jessie and James, who Alain was still a bit confused about to this day\u2013 they had seemed to be against Ash when they had first met, but yet had helped Mairin in the Kalos Crisis, and now Ash insisted they were some of his closest friends.</p><p>Alain clapped the loudest when Professor Sycamore went up, that enthusiasm fading when Malva was called up, a Fennekin resting on her shoulder. Steven and Diantha were the ones that got the loudest cheers from the crowd, both of them having once held the title of Champion. Alain\u2019s hands were starting to feel sweaty as they accepted the medals, the moment he was awaiting and dreading rapidly approaching.</p><p>\u201cAnd finally,\u201d The mayor said, a gleam in his eyes as he looked back at them. \u201cWe have the man who won the Kalos League all those years ago, and his girlfriend Mairin\u2013 both of whom stood on the front lines that dreaded night!\u201d</p><p>The crowd clapped as they stepped forward, Mairin giving him another smile, but Alain could only managed a small twitch in his lips. He wasn\u2019t quite sure how he was walking, his legs felt like they had become jelly, the whole world swaying under him. He swallowed, glancing at Mairin as their medals were brought forward. He didn\u2019t even look at his as it was handed to him, his eyes locked on her.</p><p>Another cheer was given, and Mairin looked ready to retreat back into their place in line, but Alain grabbed her wrist before she could. She looked up at him in confusion, either at the action, or perhaps she could hear the thundering of his heart. The mayor was grinning from ear to ear, Alain having informed him beforehand what he planned to do.</p><p>\u201cNow before we end this wonderful evening,\u201d The mayor said, his tone much softer, causing the audience to fall quieter in response. \u201cAlain has asked me to allow him a moment.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back, leaving him and Mairin in the center of the stage. The young woman looked confused, glancing at Alain for some explanation, and he swallowed. His mouth felt dry as he turned to face her, his hand sliding from her wrist, his fingers slipping between hers. Her bright amber eyes stared up at him, and for a moment that was his world\u2013 just him and her standing there in the silence.</p><p>\u201cMairin,\u201d Alain began, his voice somehow much steadier than what he was feeling. \u201cI&hellip; I love you. I love you more than words can ever say.\u201d</p><p>It was almost startling how quiet the city was, everyone listening, waiting for him to continue. But his only focus was for Mairin, who was watching him in surprise. Alain was far from a public speaker, so of course him standing up here in front of everyone was far from what he\u2019d normally do.</p><p>But today was anything but normal.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always been there for me,\u201d Alain continued. \u201cBy my side, throughout all these years. Even when I\u2019m being an idiot&hellip; when I\u2019m being someone that doesn\u2019t deserve you&hellip; you still support me, you still love me.\u201d</p><p>His hand reached into his pocket, slowly grasping the ring box.</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t want that to end, Mairin, I want you to always be with me,\u201d Alain said, and a blush was beginning to fill Mairin\u2019s face. Her eyes flickered down to his hand, her eyes widening as she spotted the small box.</p><p>Alain went down onto one knee, and a hush ran through the crowd. Tears stung Mairin\u2019s eyes, a smile spreading across her reddening face as he brought the box up. The words were on his lips, his hands trembling as held the box with the ring. His mouth opened, ready to ask her the question he had been wanting to for so long&hellip;</p><p>But before he could say a word, a loud bang echoed across the plaza. His ears were ringing from the sound, everyone recoiling from the intensity, panicked cries filling the air. Everyone\u2019s eyes turned out towards the crowd, where bursts of bright lights could be seen\u2013 the glow of many Pokemon being released from their Pokeballs all at once.</p><p>The low growls of the Pokemon could be heard, the people who had released them slowly coming forward. Alain tensed, eyes scanning the crowd, disbelief filling his gaze. For a moment he couldn\u2019t move, telling himself that what he was seeing wasn\u2019t real. And if it was, it was nothing but a cruel joke. There was nothing left of them\u2013 nothing left after their leader had fallen.</p><p>But yet he was seeing dozens Team Flare Grunts.</p><p>Another loud blast echoed across the plaza\u2013 fire and smoke engulfing one of the nearby buildings. That was when the real screams filled the air, cries of fear and surprise calling out in terror. The Pokemon that had been released turned, releasing attacks within the crowds.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just in the audience, grunts also began to flood the stage they stood on.</p><p>The small box dropped to the floor at Alain\u2019s feet. He could hardly register what was happening, the sheer confusion momentarily overcoming the reality of what he was seeing. None of it felt real\u2013 it couldn\u2019t be real\u2013 his entire body going numb from the shock of it all. He noticed Mairin out of the corner of his eyes. Her trembling hands were clamped over her ears, her eyes shut as she stood frozen in place.</p><p>This snapped him out of his trance, and without a second thought he felt himself reaching out and pulling Mairin in close, still trying to process what was happening.</p><p>Screams shook through his bones as a wave of terror struck through the crowd. A strange hissing noise filled his ears and the next thing he knew the entire stage was shrouded in a heavy, eerie gas.</p><p>Fighting through the shock, Alain swung his gaze towards where the grunts had been before. Standing in their place was lines of Pokemon, some of which were ones that Alain recognized painfully from the time he had spent working for Lysandre.</p><p>The front line consisted of Swalot and Muks creeping forward, ooze dripping from their slimy forms. Their mouths hung open, streams of Poison Gas pouring from them as they approached the stage. Scattered through the crowds Alain could see Houndours and Houndooms being released from their Pokeballs, Magmars joining them with a suffocating Smog attack. Weezings hovered above the stage and the audience, Alain could only guess that the thick gas pouring from them was a Smokescreen.</p><p>The moves being released cloaked the entire plaza in a black cloud. The smoke stung Alain\u2019s eyes, filling his lungs as he tried to breath. Coughing began to overtake the screaming, and panic raced through him. Smokescreen was one thing, but the other plumes would be poisonous, if they were to breath that in\u2026</p><p>Alain immediately moved so that Mairin was tucked safely against his chest, his arm moving to cover her face as best he could in hopes of stopping the poisonous fumes from getting to her. Tears stung his eyes, the bitterness of the Smokescreen making his eyes water painfully. He still could barely see\u2013 those on stage mere silhouettes against the black air.</p><p>That was when something yanked forcefully at his shoulders, tearing him away from Mairin. Alain struggled furiously the moment he felt himself being distanced from her, but she seemed to be getting farther away despite his efforts, something pulling her away from him. Vision only getting worse, Alain could scarcely make out another silhouette dragging her out of sight. </p><p>\u201cS-serena!\u201d Ash\u2019s voice cried out from somewhere to his left. </p><p>Alain\u2019s heart was thumping, attempting to break free of whoever was holding him back, but the moment he pulled free two more people seized him. He was hacking on the smoke-filled air, a desperation running through him\u2013 he had to get to Mairin!</p><p>Other people were shouting, he recognized the voices, but barely registered their words. He caught a brief glimpse of one of the people holding him back\u2013 eerie goggles and a mask covering their face, sheltering them from the smoke. Alain let out another strangled cough, lashing out against them.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare touch my husband you\u2013!\u201d A female voice snarled, followed by the crack of a punch. \u201cLet go of me you\u2013!\u201d</p><p>Alain wasn\u2019t sure if it was the many cries drowning out each other, or if the lack of oxygen was starting to reach him. His limited vision was blurring, his struggling starting to become weaker. His arms were harshly yanked behind his back, the grunts shoving him to the ground.</p><p>\u201cM-m-mair\u2013\u201d He coughed out.</p><p>A rope cut into his wrists, binding his hands together. The desperation in his struggle resurged as they began to drag him away, and through the fading smoke he could see other figures as he was dragged and then restrained against the ground. A ragged breath got caught in his throat when he found the professor laying next to him, a bruise on his face, arms also bound behind his back. </p><p>Alain rolled over, attempting to sit up, only to be shoved back to the ground. Out of the corner of his eye he could have sworn he saw a grunt appear out of thin air, grabbing Malva as she struggled against them. Breathing became slightly easier with the fumes in the air starting to fade, but in his panic he didn\u2019t even care. He could make out Steven slamming into a grunt, knocking her back just in time to spin around to punch another one away.</p><p>The grunts hesitated, clearly not wanting to get close to the champion.</p><p>\u201cWe have the ones the boss wanted!\u201d A grunt shouted. \u201cFall out!\u201d</p><p>Alain heard the sound of another Pokeball opening, peering up in time to see a Hypno standing over them. The Pokemon gave them a jagged grin, swinging the pendulum in its hand. A white glow filled the air surrounding them\u2013 the energy of the Teleport twisting around them, before whisking them away. </p>",

He swiftly looked away and Sycamore placed a hand on his shoulder. \u201cS-sorry,\u201d Alain muttered. \u201cI know I\u2019m not supposed to think that way\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat took place was something you did not want to happen, and you did everything in your power to stop the Kalos Crisis\u2013 and succeeded. You\u2019re nothing but a hero, which is why you\u2019re here with the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>Ten years. It had been ten years today since the Kalos Crisis. An event that was still so vivid in his memory, one that still managed to find its way into his nightmares. He shifted uncertainly. Tonight had been one of mixed feelings for him. All of Lumiose had been celebrating Team Flare\u2019s fall throughout the entire day, a parade having even been held. Those who had been hailed as heroes, the ones who had played a role in the fall of the vile group, were seen as the honoured guests tonight.</p><p>Ash, Serena, Bonnie, Clemont\u2013 and all those who had been the gym leaders at the time. Diantha, Steven, and Malva. Jessie, James, Professor Sycamore, Meyer, Mairin\u2026</p><p>And him.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about Malva?\u201d Professor Sycamore asked. \u201cDo you feel she deserves to be here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Alain said\u2013 it was impossible to forget her standing by his and Ash\u2019s side as they faced Lysandre.</p><p>\u201cThen if Malva, who actively knew what Flare\u2019s goals were, deserves to be here,\u201d Professor Sycamore began. \u201cThen why on earth wouldn\u2019t you\u2013 someone who was giving everything he had for what he believed to be peace\u2013 deserve to be here as well?\u201d He gave him a soft smile. \u201cYou have done nothing but good, Alain. You deserve to be called a hero.\u201d</p><p>Alain\u2019s throat felt tight. \u201cTh-thank you, Professor.\u201d</p><p>The professor clapped him on the back. \u201cThen why are we lingering back here? Let us join the others, embrace our old friends tonight, and wear the medals they have for us with honour!\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026They have medals?\u201d</p><p>The professor paused. \u201c\u2026I wasn\u2019t supposed to mention that. But yes, they do\u2013 the Lumiose mayor felt you guys didn\u2019t get enough recognition at the time, so\u2026 yeah. They have medals for us when we go on stage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they do\u2026\u201d Alain muttered.</p><p>Professor Sycamore smirked slightly. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s why you\u2019re nervous though, is it?\u201d</p><p>A pink tinge came onto Alain\u2019s cheeks, and his heart once again began pounding in his chest. He opened his mouth to speak, but no words came to him for several seconds. Sycamore laughed, which wasn\u2019t helping Alain, and he swiftly looked away. Again his hand slipped into his pocket, touching the ring box.</p><p>\u201c\u2026What if she says no?\u201d Alain whispered.</p><p>\u201cAnd just what reason would she have to say no?\u201d Sycamore asked, an arm around Alain\u2019s shoulder as he guided him towards the doorway. Alain dug in his heels, not ready to face what would be awaiting him outside. \u201cYou know Mairin loves you.\u201d</p><p>Mairin, just her name brought a smile to Alain\u2019s face. Despite his nerves, he had spent most of the celebration with her. She hadn\u2019t asked him why he had looked so on edge, most likely just assuming that the anniversary of what they were gathered for was the explanation for his attitude. And while it was most certainly affecting him, it was what question he\u2019d be asking his girlfriend tonight that was making him shake.</p><p>But hopefully she wouldn\u2019t just be his girlfriend after tonight.</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d Alain said. \u201cBut what if she doesn\u2019t feel ready for marriage? What if she doesn\u2019t want to get married? Or just doesn\u2019t want to get married to me\u2013?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see her face when she saw Serena\u2019s engagement ring?\u201d Sycamore asked, crossing his arms. \u201cOr her expression when she saw, um, what\u2019s her name\u2026 Jessie\u2019s wedding ring? Or how her and Bonnie just happen to go by wedding dress shops when they go out\u2013 and tend to discuss said dresses loudly when you happen to be in the room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, well\u2013\u201d Alain began, the Sycamore cut him off.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, my boy, the only thing Mairin is going to say to you is yes,\u201d Sycamore said, and he let out a hardy laugh. \u201cCome on now, we can\u2019t hide away in the gym forever\u2013 let\u2019s go enjoy the rest of the celebration!\u201d</p><p>Alain\u2019s heart was still thumping nervously, but yet the professor\u2019s words had brought a sense of calm to him. He had no reason to panic over what Mairin would say\u2013 he loved her, he trusted her\u2013 and he knew that she would always stand by his side. Today was a day to celebrate the fall of the ones he had feared, the day his close friends had become heros. Even if he still doubted if that title could be held by him, he didn\u2019t doubt that those like Mairin and Ash deserved it. He would stand with them, and join the rest of Lumiose and Kalos in celebrating what they achieved.</p><p>And then tonight, out on the stage with everyone else he held close, he would ask Mairin to marry him.</p><p>Today wasn\u2019t a day to fear.</p><hr><p>Lumiose City always looked beautiful at night\u2013 the whole city lit up, never sleeping\u2013 it was truly a sight to see. Alain had spent many years living here, but still he always appreciated what the capital had to offer.</p><p>But tonight was something else.</p><p>Seeing hundreds, maybe thousands of people gathered in the center of the city, filling the streets beyond\u2013 it was a breathtaking view. Prism Tower was lit up behind them, the base of the city\u2019s proud gym renovated into the stage that he and the others were standing on. Lights shone down onto them, making his eyes water from their intensity.</p><p>In front of him was the mayor of Lumiose, a plump and cheerful man who hadn\u2019t stopped smiling the entire night. He was currently speaking to the crowds watching them, hands moving with his enthusiasm as he spoke. Alain caught a few words, about the tragedy that had taken place a decade before, of the bravery the city had shown in such danger, but it was hard to focus on what was being said.</p><p>His eyes flickered off to his right, taking in the beautiful woman standing next to him.</p><p>Mairin had a smile on her face, but he could tell by the small twitch near the corner of her lips that she was uneasy with such a large crowd. Between now and the parade she had let her hair down from the tight bun she had in since this morning, her long red hair now cascading down her shoulders. Her fingers were nervously tracing the sequins in her navy blue dress, the lights from the stage causing them to gleam.</p><p>Mairin noticed his glance, her head turning to meet his gaze. Today was one of the few times he had ever seen her wear makeup, and Alain was sure that Serena and Bonnie must have insisted on it. What she wore was simple, almost barely noticeable, but it made her amber eyes pop. She gave him a small smile, grabbing his hand, before turning to look back at the crowd.</p><p>Suddenly the city seemed quite dull after \u00a0having looked at Mairin.</p><p>Mairin squeezed his hand, and he did so in return. The ring box hidden away in his pocket suddenly seemed much heavier, a reminder of what he would be doing in a short time. His heart thumped, but he forced his expression to remain composed as the mayor turned to face him and the others on stage.</p><p>\u201cThe first of who should be recognized,\u201d The mayor said, his voice echoing across the plaza. \u201cAre the gym leaders who fearlessly defended our region at the time!\u201d</p><p>Clemont and the other gym leaders stepped forward, and Alain studied them. Some, such as Ramos, had retired years before. Seeing the gym leaders he had grown up with all together once again was surreal. The crowd began cheering, and Alain put his own hands together as well, a smile tugging at his face.</p><p>As Professor Sycamore had said, several people stepped forward, presenting medals to the gym leaders. More clapping and cheering was heard, the eight gym leaders returning to their place in line. </p><p>The mayor began calling others forward\u2013 Ash and Serena, an extra loud cheer rushing out from the crowd when the mayor mentioned their engagement. Bonnie and her father\u2013 who\u2019d had his identity as the Blaziken Mask revealed years before. The married Jessie and James, who Alain was still a bit confused about to this day\u2013 they had seemed to be against Ash when they had first met, but yet had helped Mairin in the Kalos Crisis, and now Ash insisted they were some of his closest friends.</p><p>Alain clapped the loudest when Professor Sycamore went up, that enthusiasm fading when Malva was called up, a Fennekin resting on her shoulder. Steven and Diantha were the ones that got the loudest cheers from the crowd, both of them having once held the title of Champion. Alain\u2019s hands were starting to feel sweaty as they accepted the medals, the moment he was awaiting and dreading rapidly approaching.</p><p>\u201cAnd finally,\u201d The mayor said, a gleam in his eyes as he looked back at them. \u201cWe have the man who won the Kalos League all those years ago, and his girlfriend Mairin\u2013 both of whom stood on the front lines that dreaded night!\u201d</p><p>The crowd clapped as they stepped forward, Mairin giving him another smile, but Alain could only managed a small twitch in his lips. He wasn\u2019t quite sure how he was walking, his legs felt like they had become jelly, the whole world swaying under him. He swallowed, glancing at Mairin as their medals were brought forward. He didn\u2019t even look at his as it was handed to him, his eyes locked on her.</p><p>Another cheer was given, and Mairin looked ready to retreat back into their place in line, but Alain grabbed her wrist before she could. She looked up at him in confusion, either at the action, or perhaps she could hear the thundering of his heart. The mayor was grinning from ear to ear, Alain having informed him beforehand what he planned to do.</p><p>\u201cNow before we end this wonderful evening,\u201d The mayor said, his tone much softer, causing the audience to fall quieter in response. \u201cAlain has asked me to allow him a moment.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back, leaving him and Mairin in the center of the stage. The young woman looked confused, glancing at Alain for some explanation, and he swallowed. His mouth felt dry as he turned to face her, his hand sliding from her wrist, his fingers slipping between hers. Her bright amber eyes stared up at him, and for a moment that was his world\u2013 just him and her standing there in the silence.</p><p>\u201cMairin,\u201d Alain began, his voice somehow much steadier than what he was feeling. \u201cI\u2026 I love you. I love you more than words can ever say.\u201d</p><p>It was almost startling how quiet the city was, everyone listening, waiting for him to continue. But his only focus was for Mairin, who was watching him in surprise. Alain was far from a public speaker, so of course him standing up here in front of everyone was far from what he\u2019d normally do.</p><p>But today was anything but normal.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always been there for me,\u201d Alain continued. \u201cBy my side, throughout all these years. Even when I\u2019m being an idiot\u2026 when I\u2019m being someone that doesn\u2019t deserve you\u2026 you still support me, you still love me.\u201d</p><p>His hand reached into his pocket, slowly grasping the ring box.</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t want that to end, Mairin, I want you to always be with me,\u201d Alain said, and a blush was beginning to fill Mairin\u2019s face. Her eyes flickered down to his hand, her eyes widening as she spotted the small box.</p><p>Alain went down onto one knee, and a hush ran through the crowd. Tears stung Mairin\u2019s eyes, a smile spreading across her reddening face as he brought the box up. The words were on his lips, his hands trembling as held the box with the ring. His mouth opened, ready to ask her the question he had been wanting to for so long\u2026</p><p>But before he could say a word, a loud bang echoed across the plaza. His ears were ringing from the sound, everyone recoiling from the intensity, panicked cries filling the air. Everyone\u2019s eyes turned out towards the crowd, where bursts of bright lights could be seen\u2013 the glow of many Pokemon being released from their Pokeballs all at once.</p><p>The low growls of the Pokemon could be heard, the people who had released them slowly coming forward. Alain tensed, eyes scanning the crowd, disbelief filling his gaze. For a moment he couldn\u2019t move, telling himself that what he was seeing wasn\u2019t real. And if it was, it was nothing but a cruel joke. There was nothing left of them\u2013 nothing left after their leader had fallen.</p><p>But yet he was seeing dozens Team Flare Grunts.</p><p>Another loud blast echoed across the plaza\u2013 fire and smoke engulfing one of the nearby buildings. That was when the real screams filled the air, cries of fear and surprise calling out in terror. The Pokemon that had been released turned, releasing attacks within the crowds.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just in the audience, grunts also began to flood the stage they stood on.</p><p>The small box dropped to the floor at Alain\u2019s feet. He could hardly register what was happening, the sheer confusion momentarily overcoming the reality of what he was seeing. None of it felt real\u2013 it couldn\u2019t be real\u2013 his entire body going numb from the shock of it all. He noticed Mairin out of the corner of his eyes. Her trembling hands were clamped over her ears, her eyes shut as she stood frozen in place.</p><p>This snapped him out of his trance, and without a second thought he felt himself reaching out and pulling Mairin in close, still trying to process what was happening.</p><p>Screams shook through his bones as a wave of terror struck through the crowd. A strange hissing noise filled his ears and the next thing he knew the entire stage was shrouded in a heavy, eerie gas.</p><p>Fighting through the shock, Alain swung his gaze towards where the grunts had been before. Standing in their place was lines of Pokemon, some of which were ones that Alain recognized painfully from the time he had spent working for Lysandre.</p><p>The front line consisted of Swalot and Muks creeping forward, ooze dripping from their slimy forms. Their mouths hung open, streams of Poison Gas pouring from them as they approached the stage. Scattered through the crowds Alain could see Houndours and Houndooms being released from their Pokeballs, Magmars joining them with a suffocating Smog attack. Weezings hovered above the stage and the audience, Alain could only guess that the thick gas pouring from them was a Smokescreen.</p><p>The moves being released cloaked the entire plaza in a black cloud. The smoke stung Alain\u2019s eyes, filling his lungs as he tried to breath. Coughing began to overtake the screaming, and panic raced through him. Smokescreen was one thing, but the other plumes would be poisonous, if they were to breath that in\u2026</p><p>Alain immediately moved so that Mairin was tucked safely against his chest, his arm moving to cover her face as best he could in hopes of stopping the poisonous fumes from getting to her. Tears stung his eyes, the bitterness of the Smokescreen making his eyes water painfully. He still could barely see\u2013 those on stage mere silhouettes against the black air.</p><p>That was when something yanked forcefully at his shoulders, tearing him away from Mairin. Alain struggled furiously the moment he felt himself being distanced from her, but she seemed to be getting farther away despite his efforts, something pulling her away from him. Vision only getting worse, Alain could scarcely make out another silhouette dragging her out of sight. </p><p>\u201cS-serena!\u201d Ash\u2019s voice cried out from somewhere to his left. </p><p>Alain\u2019s heart was thumping, attempting to break free of whoever was holding him back, but the moment he pulled free two more people seized him. He was hacking on the smoke-filled air, a desperation running through him\u2013 he had to get to Mairin!</p><p>Other people were shouting, he recognized the voices, but barely registered their words. He caught a brief glimpse of one of the people holding him back\u2013 eerie goggles and a mask covering their face, sheltering them from the smoke. Alain let out another strangled cough, lashing out against them.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare touch my husband you\u2013!\u201d A female voice snarled, followed by the crack of a punch. \u201cLet go of me you\u2013!\u201d</p><p>Alain wasn\u2019t sure if it was the many cries drowning out each other, or if the lack of oxygen was starting to reach him. His limited vision was blurring, his struggling starting to become weaker. His arms were harshly yanked behind his back, the grunts shoving him to the ground.</p><p>\u201cM-m-mair\u2013\u201d He coughed out.</p><p>A rope cut into his wrists, binding his hands together. The desperation in his struggle resurged as they began to drag him away, and through the fading smoke he could see other figures as he was dragged and then restrained against the ground. A ragged breath got caught in his throat when he found the professor laying next to him, a bruise on his face, arms also bound behind his back. </p><p>Alain rolled over, attempting to sit up, only to be shoved back to the ground. Out of the corner of his eye he could have sworn he saw a grunt appear out of thin air, grabbing Malva as she struggled against them. Breathing became slightly easier with the fumes in the air starting to fade, but in his panic he didn\u2019t even care. He could make out Steven slamming into a grunt, knocking her back just in time to spin around to punch another one away.</p><p>The grunts hesitated, clearly not wanting to get close to the champion.</p><p>\u201cWe have the ones the boss wanted!\u201d A grunt shouted. \u201cFall out!\u201d</p><p>Alain heard the sound of another Pokeball opening, peering up in time to see a Hypno standing over them. The Pokemon gave them a jagged grin, swinging the pendulum in its hand. A white glow filled the air surrounding them\u2013 the energy of the Teleport twisting around them, before whisking them away. </p>",

Just a cute fic where Alain proposes to Mairin. Nothing could go wrong.</p><hr><p><br></p><p>Alain\u2019s hands were shaking.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter how he held them, if he stuffed his hands away into his pockets or laced his fingers tightly together\u2013 there was still a tremble as he stood there, waiting. His mind was humming, every possible doubt crawling into his head. His mouth was dry, making his nervous swallowing painful.</p><p>He slipped a hand into his pocket, fingers wrapping around the velvety box resting there. He glanced around for a moment, before pulling it out when he saw he was alone. It was small and black, fitting perfectly in the palm of his hand as he slowly opened the lid, already knowing what would be inside. His heart thumped nervously as he stared down at the small object, a wave of fear washing over him.</p><p>A slim silver ring gleamed up at him.</p>[[MORE]]<p>It was a sleek ring, the metal carefully twisted in an elegant pattern, carefully holding a beautifully cut emerald in place. Steven had the ring custom made, and Alain had spent several days trying to decide just what he wanted it to look like. The ring had to be beautiful, like her\u2013 but yet simple, since he knew she wouldn\u2019t want anything over the top. An emerald had been an easy choice, knowing her love for green, and he had felt that the silver suited the gem much nicer than gold.</p><p>It was just how he had pictured it, just how he had wanted it. He snapped the ring box shut, closing his eyes as his heart thundering in his chest. In the end it truly didn\u2019t matter how the ring looked or what had gone into it\u2013 the only thing that would matter was what she\u2019d say the moment he asked her the question.</p><p>\u201cWell, I must say this has been a marvelous evening so far,\u201d A cheerful voice said from behind him, causing Alain to pause from his worry, turning to glance over his shoulder.</p><p>Pale blue eyes met his icy eyes, an older man lingering by the doorway with a kind smile on his face. For a moment the panic rushing through Alain seemed to fade, the sight of the professor instantly bringing a sense of calm into the room. He turned to face his mentor, hastily stuffing the ring away, giving the man a brief smile.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been eventful,\u201d Alain said slowly, trying not to let his nervousness show. His words fell flat, his pale face and the waver in his voice giving away the emotions running through him.</p><p>Professor Sycamore sighed, his smiling fading, approaching Alain. \u201cAlain, please don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve been fretting this whole evening\u2013 you know this entire celebration is for you after all.\u201d</p><p>Shivers raced through him, a different kind of fear coming over Alain. \u201c\u2026You mean it\u2019s a celebration in honour of stopping what I almost caused.\u201d</p><p>The professor frowned. \u201cAlain.\u201d</p><p>For a moment Alain felt like a child again, Sycamore using the same tone he often had when he was younger. He swiftly looked away and Sycamore placed a hand on his shoulder. \u201cS-sorry,\u201d Alain muttered. \u201cI know I\u2019m not supposed to think that way\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat took place was something you did not want to happen, and you did everything in your power to stop the Kalos Crisis\u2013 and succeeded. You\u2019re nothing but a hero, which is why you\u2019re here with the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>Ten years. It had been ten years today since the Kalos Crisis. An event that was still so vivid in his memory, one that still managed to find its way into his nightmares. He shifted uncertainly. Tonight had been one of mixed feelings for him. All of Lumiose had been celebrating Team Flare\u2019s fall throughout the entire day, a parade having even been held. Those who had been hailed as heroes, the ones who had played a role in the fall of the vile group, were seen as the honoured guests tonight.</p><p>Ash, Serena, Bonnie, Clemont\u2013 and all those who had been the gym leaders at the time. Diantha, Steven, and Malva. Jessie, James, Professor Sycamore, Meyer, Mairin\u2026</p><p>And him.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about Malva?\u201d Professor Sycamore asked. \u201cDo you feel she deserves to be here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Alain said\u2013 it was impossible to forget her standing by his and Ash\u2019s side as they faced Lysandre.</p><p>\u201cThen if Malva, who actively knew what Flare\u2019s goals were, deserves to be here,\u201d Professor Sycamore began. \u201cThen why on earth wouldn\u2019t you\u2013 someone who was giving everything he had for what he believed to be peace\u2013 deserve to be here as well?\u201d He gave him a soft smile. \u201cYou have done nothing but good, Alain. You deserve to be called a hero.\u201d</p><p>Alain\u2019s throat felt tight. \u201cTh-thank you, Professor.\u201d</p><p>The professor clapped him on the back. \u201cThen why are we lingering back here? Let us join the others, embrace our old friends tonight, and wear the medals they have for us with honour!\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026They have medals?\u201d</p><p>The professor paused. \u201c\u2026I wasn\u2019t supposed to mention that. But yes, they do\u2013 the Lumiose mayor felt you guys didn\u2019t get enough recognition at the time, so\u2026 yeah. They have medals for us when we go on stage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they do\u2026\u201d Alain muttered.</p><p>Professor Sycamore smirked slightly. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s why you\u2019re nervous though, is it?\u201d</p><p>A pink tinge came onto Alain\u2019s cheeks, and his heart once again began pounding in his chest. He opened his mouth to speak, but no words came to him for several seconds. Sycamore laughed, which wasn\u2019t helping Alain, and he swiftly looked away. Again his hand slipped into his pocket, touching the ring box.</p><p>\u201c\u2026What if she says no?\u201d Alain whispered.</p><p>\u201cAnd just what reason would she have to say no?\u201d Sycamore asked, an arm around Alain\u2019s shoulder as he guided him towards the doorway. Alain dug in his heels, not ready to face what would be awaiting him outside. \u201cYou know Mairin loves you.\u201d</p><p>Mairin, just her name brought a smile to Alain\u2019s face. Despite his nerves, he had spent most of the celebration with her. She hadn\u2019t asked him why he had looked so on edge, most likely just assuming that the anniversary of what they were gathered for was the explanation for his attitude. And while it was most certainly affecting him, it was what question he\u2019d be asking his girlfriend tonight that was making him shake.</p><p>But hopefully she wouldn\u2019t just be his girlfriend after tonight.</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d Alain said. \u201cBut what if she doesn\u2019t feel ready for marriage? What if she doesn\u2019t want to get married? Or just doesn\u2019t want to get married to me\u2013?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see her face when she saw Serena\u2019s engagement ring?\u201d Sycamore asked, crossing his arms. \u201cOr her expression when she saw, um, what\u2019s her name\u2026 Jessie\u2019s wedding ring? Or how her and Bonnie just happen to go by wedding dress shops when they go out\u2013 and tend to discuss said dresses loudly when you happen to be in the room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, well\u2013\u201d Alain began, the Sycamore cut him off.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, my boy, the only thing Mairin is going to say to you is yes,\u201d Sycamore said, and he let out a hardy laugh. \u201cCome on now, we can\u2019t hide away in the gym forever\u2013 let\u2019s go enjoy the rest of the celebration!\u201d</p><p>Alain\u2019s heart was still thumping nervously, but yet the professor\u2019s words had brought a sense of calm to him. He had no reason to panic over what Mairin would say\u2013 he loved her, he trusted her\u2013 and he knew that she would always stand by his side. Today was a day to celebrate the fall of the ones he had feared, the day his close friends had become heros. Even if he still doubted if that title could be held by him, he didn\u2019t doubt that those like Mairin and Ash deserved it. He would stand with them, and join the rest of Lumiose and Kalos in celebrating what they achieved.</p><p>And then tonight, out on the stage with everyone else he held close, he would ask Mairin to marry him.</p><p>Today wasn\u2019t a day to fear.</p><hr><p>Lumiose City always looked beautiful at night\u2013 the whole city lit up, never sleeping\u2013 it was truly a sight to see. Alain had spent many years living here, but still he always appreciated what the capital had to offer.</p><p>But tonight was something else.</p><p>Seeing hundreds, maybe thousands of people gathered in the center of the city, filling the streets beyond\u2013 it was a breathtaking view. Prism Tower was lit up behind them, the base of the city\u2019s proud gym renovated into the stage that he and the others were standing on. Lights shone down onto them, making his eyes water from their intensity.</p><p>In front of him was the mayor of Lumiose, a plump and cheerful man who hadn\u2019t stopped smiling the entire night. He was currently speaking to the crowds watching them, hands moving with his enthusiasm as he spoke. Alain caught a few words, about the tragedy that had taken place a decade before, of the bravery the city had shown in such danger, but it was hard to focus on what was being said.</p><p>His eyes flickered off to his right, taking in the beautiful woman standing next to him.</p><p>Mairin had a smile on her face, but he could tell by the small twitch near the corner of her lips that she was uneasy with such a large crowd. Between now and the parade she had let her hair down from the tight bun she had in since this morning, her long red hair now cascading down her shoulders. Her fingers were nervously tracing the sequins in her navy blue dress, the lights from the stage causing them to gleam.</p><p>Mairin noticed his glance, her head turning to meet his gaze. Today was one of the few times he had ever seen her wear makeup, and Alain was sure that Serena and Bonnie must have insisted on it. What she wore was simple, almost barely noticeable, but it made her amber eyes pop. She gave him a small smile, grabbing his hand, before turning to look back at the crowd.</p><p>Suddenly the city seemed quite dull after \u00a0having looked at Mairin.</p><p>Mairin squeezed his hand, and he did so in return. The ring box hidden away in his pocket suddenly seemed much heavier, a reminder of what he would be doing in a short time. His heart thumped, but he forced his expression to remain composed as the mayor turned to face him and the others on stage.</p><p>\u201cThe first of who should be recognized,\u201d The mayor said, his voice echoing across the plaza. \u201cAre the gym leaders who fearlessly defended our region at the time!\u201d</p><p>Clemont and the other gym leaders stepped forward, and Alain studied them. Some, such as Ramos, had retired years before. Seeing the gym leaders he had grown up with all together once again was surreal. The crowd began cheering, and Alain put his own hands together as well, a smile tugging at his face.</p><p>As Professor Sycamore had said, several people stepped forward, presenting medals to the gym leaders. More clapping and cheering was heard, the eight gym leaders returning to their place in line. </p><p>The mayor began calling others forward\u2013 Ash and Serena, an extra loud cheer rushing out from the crowd when the mayor mentioned their engagement. Bonnie and her father\u2013 who\u2019d had his identity as the Blaziken Mask revealed years before. The married Jessie and James, who Alain was still a bit confused about to this day\u2013 they had seemed to be against Ash when they had first met, but yet had helped Mairin in the Kalos Crisis, and now Ash insisted they were some of his closest friends.</p><p>Alain clapped the loudest when Professor Sycamore went up, that enthusiasm fading when Malva was called up, a Fennekin resting on her shoulder. Steven and Diantha were the ones that got the loudest cheers from the crowd, both of them having once held the title of Champion. Alain\u2019s hands were starting to feel sweaty as they accepted the medals, the moment he was awaiting and dreading rapidly approaching.</p><p>\u201cAnd finally,\u201d The mayor said, a gleam in his eyes as he looked back at them. \u201cWe have the man who won the Kalos League all those years ago, and his girlfriend Mairin\u2013 both of whom stood on the front lines that dreaded night!\u201d</p><p>The crowd clapped as they stepped forward, Mairin giving him another smile, but Alain could only managed a small twitch in his lips. He wasn\u2019t quite sure how he was walking, his legs felt like they had become jelly, the whole world swaying under him. He swallowed, glancing at Mairin as their medals were brought forward. He didn\u2019t even look at his as it was handed to him, his eyes locked on her.</p><p>Another cheer was given, and Mairin looked ready to retreat back into their place in line, but Alain grabbed her wrist before she could. She looked up at him in confusion, either at the action, or perhaps she could hear the thundering of his heart. The mayor was grinning from ear to ear, Alain having informed him beforehand what he planned to do.</p><p>\u201cNow before we end this wonderful evening,\u201d The mayor said, his tone much softer, causing the audience to fall quieter in response. \u201cAlain has asked me to allow him a moment.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back, leaving him and Mairin in the center of the stage. The young woman looked confused, glancing at Alain for some explanation, and he swallowed. His mouth felt dry as he turned to face her, his hand sliding from her wrist, his fingers slipping between hers. Her bright amber eyes stared up at him, and for a moment that was his world\u2013 just him and her standing there in the silence.</p><p>\u201cMairin,\u201d Alain began, his voice somehow much steadier than what he was feeling. \u201cI\u2026 I love you. I love you more than words can ever say.\u201d</p><p>It was almost startling how quiet the city was, everyone listening, waiting for him to continue. But his only focus was for Mairin, who was watching him in surprise. Alain was far from a public speaker, so of course him standing up here in front of everyone was far from what he\u2019d normally do.</p><p>But today was anything but normal.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always been there for me,\u201d Alain continued. \u201cBy my side, throughout all these years. Even when I\u2019m being an idiot\u2026 when I\u2019m being someone that doesn\u2019t deserve you\u2026 you still support me, you still love me.\u201d</p><p>His hand reached into his pocket, slowly grasping the ring box.</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t want that to end, Mairin, I want you to always be with me,\u201d Alain said, and a blush was beginning to fill Mairin\u2019s face. Her eyes flickered down to his hand, her eyes widening as she spotted the small box.</p><p>Alain went down onto one knee, and a hush ran through the crowd. Tears stung Mairin\u2019s eyes, a smile spreading across her reddening face as he brought the box up. The words were on his lips, his hands trembling as held the box with the ring. His mouth opened, ready to ask her the question he had been wanting to for so long\u2026</p><p>But before he could say a word, a loud bang echoed across the plaza. His ears were ringing from the sound, everyone recoiling from the intensity, panicked cries filling the air. Everyone\u2019s eyes turned out towards the crowd, where bursts of bright lights could be seen\u2013 the glow of many Pokemon being released from their Pokeballs all at once.</p><p>The low growls of the Pokemon could be heard, the people who had released them slowly coming forward. Alain tensed, eyes scanning the crowd, disbelief filling his gaze. For a moment he couldn\u2019t move, telling himself that what he was seeing wasn\u2019t real. And if it was, it was nothing but a cruel joke. There was nothing left of them\u2013 nothing left after their leader had fallen.</p><p>But yet he was seeing dozens Team Flare Grunts.</p><p>Another loud blast echoed across the plaza\u2013 fire and smoke engulfing one of the nearby buildings. That was when the real screams filled the air, cries of fear and surprise calling out in terror. The Pokemon that had been released turned, releasing attacks within the crowds.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just in the audience, grunts also began to flood the stage they stood on.</p><p>The small box dropped to the floor at Alain\u2019s feet. He could hardly register what was happening, the sheer confusion momentarily overcoming the reality of what he was seeing. None of it felt real\u2013 it couldn\u2019t be real\u2013 his entire body going numb from the shock of it all. He noticed Mairin out of the corner of his eyes. Her trembling hands were clamped over her ears, her eyes shut as she stood frozen in place.</p><p>This snapped him out of his trance, and without a second thought he felt himself reaching out and pulling Mairin in close, still trying to process what was happening.</p><p>Screams shook through his bones as a wave of terror struck through the crowd. A strange hissing noise filled his ears and the next thing he knew the entire stage was shrouded in a heavy, eerie gas.</p><p>Fighting through the shock, Alain swung his gaze towards where the grunts had been before. Standing in their place was lines of Pokemon, some of which were ones that Alain recognized painfully from the time he had spent working for Lysandre.</p><p>The front line consisted of Swalot and Muks creeping forward, ooze dripping from their slimy forms. Their mouths hung open, streams of Poison Gas pouring from them as they approached the stage. Scattered through the crowds Alain could see Houndours and Houndooms being released from their Pokeballs, Magmars joining them with a suffocating Smog attack. Weezings hovered above the stage and the audience, Alain could only guess that the thick gas pouring from them was a Smokescreen.</p><p>The moves being released cloaked the entire plaza in a black cloud. The smoke stung Alain\u2019s eyes, filling his lungs as he tried to breath. Coughing began to overtake the screaming, and panic raced through him. Smokescreen was one thing, but the other plumes would be poisonous, if they were to breath that in\u2026</p><p>Alain immediately moved so that Mairin was tucked safely against his chest, his arm moving to cover her face as best he could in hopes of stopping the poisonous fumes from getting to her. Tears stung his eyes, the bitterness of the Smokescreen making his eyes water painfully. He still could barely see\u2013 those on stage mere silhouettes against the black air.</p><p>That was when something yanked forcefully at his shoulders, tearing him away from Mairin. Alain struggled furiously the moment he felt himself being distanced from her, but she seemed to be getting farther away despite his efforts, something pulling her away from him. Vision only getting worse, Alain could scarcely make out another silhouette dragging her out of sight. </p><p>\u201cS-serena!\u201d Ash\u2019s voice cried out from somewhere to his left. </p><p>Alain\u2019s heart was thumping, attempting to break free of whoever was holding him back, but the moment he pulled free two more people seized him. He was hacking on the smoke-filled air, a desperation running through him\u2013 he had to get to Mairin!</p><p>Other people were shouting, he recognized the voices, but barely registered their words. He caught a brief glimpse of one of the people holding him back\u2013 eerie goggles and a mask covering their face, sheltering them from the smoke. Alain let out another strangled cough, lashing out against them.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare touch my husband you\u2013!\u201d A female voice snarled, followed by the crack of a punch. \u201cLet go of me you\u2013!\u201d</p><p>Alain wasn\u2019t sure if it was the many cries drowning out each other, or if the lack of oxygen was starting to reach him. His limited vision was blurring, his struggling starting to become weaker. His arms were harshly yanked behind his back, the grunts shoving him to the ground.</p><p>\u201cM-m-mair\u2013\u201d He coughed out.</p><p>A rope cut into his wrists, binding his hands together. The desperation in his struggle resurged as they began to drag him away, and through the fading smoke he could see other figures as he was dragged and then restrained against the ground. A ragged breath got caught in his throat when he found the professor laying next to him, a bruise on his face, arms also bound behind his back. </p><p>Alain rolled over, attempting to sit up, only to be shoved back to the ground. Out of the corner of his eye he could have sworn he saw a grunt appear out of thin air, grabbing Malva as she struggled against them. Breathing became slightly easier with the fumes in the air starting to fade, but in his panic he didn\u2019t even care. He could make out Steven slamming into a grunt, knocking her back just in time to spin around to punch another one away.</p><p>The grunts hesitated, clearly not wanting to get close to the champion.</p><p>\u201cWe have the ones the boss wanted!\u201d A grunt shouted. \u201cFall out!\u201d</p><p>Alain heard the sound of another Pokeball opening, peering up in time to see a Hypno standing over them. The Pokemon gave them a jagged grin, swinging the pendulum in its hand. A white glow filled the air surrounding them\u2013 the energy of the Teleport twisting around them, before whisking them away. </p>",
                "content": "<p>Here is a collab fic written by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/meM9lealHWaQfLddfDFvsyg\">@11random-person11</a> and I. Just a cute fic where Alain proposes to Mairin. Nothing could go wrong.</p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>Alain&rsquo;s hands were shaking.</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t matter how he held them, if he stuffed his hands away into his pockets or laced his fingers tightly together&ndash; there was still a tremble as he stood there, waiting. His mind was humming, every possible doubt crawling into his head. His mouth was dry, making his nervous swallowing painful.</p><p>He slipped a hand into his pocket, fingers wrapping around the velvety box resting there. He glanced around for a moment, before pulling it out when he saw he was alone. It was small and black, fitting perfectly in the palm of his hand as he slowly opened the lid, already knowing what would be inside. His heart thumped nervously as he stared down at the small object, a wave of fear washing over him.</p><p>A slim silver ring gleamed up at him.</p><p>It was a sleek ring, the metal carefully twisted in an elegant pattern, carefully holding a beautifully cut emerald in place. Steven had the ring custom made, and Alain had spent several days trying to decide just what he wanted it to look like. The ring had to be beautiful, like her&ndash; but yet simple, since he knew she wouldn&rsquo;t want anything over the top. An emerald had been an easy choice, knowing her love for green, and he had felt that the silver suited the gem much nicer than gold.</p><p>It was just how he had pictured it, just how he had wanted it. He snapped the ring box shut, closing his eyes as his heart thundering in his chest. In the end it truly didn&rsquo;t matter how the ring looked or what had gone into it&ndash; the only thing that would matter was what she&rsquo;d say the moment he asked her the question.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I must say this has been a marvelous evening so far,&rdquo; A cheerful voice said from behind him, causing Alain to pause from his worry, turning to glance over his shoulder.</p><p>Pale blue eyes met his icy eyes, an older man lingering by the doorway with a kind smile on his face. For a moment the panic rushing through Alain seemed to fade, the sight of the professor instantly bringing a sense of calm into the room. He turned to face his mentor, hastily stuffing the ring away, giving the man a brief smile.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been eventful,&rdquo; Alain said slowly, trying not to let his nervousness show. His words fell flat, his pale face and the waver in his voice giving away the emotions running through him.</p><p>Professor Sycamore sighed, his smiling fading, approaching Alain. &ldquo;Alain, please don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;ve been fretting this whole evening&ndash; you know this entire celebration is for you after all.&rdquo;</p><p>Shivers raced through him, a different kind of fear coming over Alain. &ldquo;&hellip;You mean it&rsquo;s a celebration in honour of stopping what I almost caused.&rdquo;</p><p>The professor frowned. &ldquo;Alain.&rdquo;</p><p>For a moment Alain felt like a child again, Sycamore using the same tone he often had when he was younger. He swiftly looked away and Sycamore placed a hand on his shoulder. &ldquo;S-sorry,&rdquo; Alain muttered. &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m not supposed to think that way&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What took place was something you did not want to happen, and you did everything in your power to stop the Kalos Crisis&ndash; and succeeded. You&rsquo;re nothing but a hero, which is why you&rsquo;re here with the rest of us.&rdquo;</p><p>Ten years. It had been ten years today since the Kalos Crisis. An event that was still so vivid in his memory, one that still managed to find its way into his nightmares. He shifted uncertainly. Tonight had been one of mixed feelings for him. All of Lumiose had been celebrating Team Flare&rsquo;s fall throughout the entire day, a parade having even been held. Those who had been hailed as heroes, the ones who had played a role in the fall of the vile group, were seen as the honoured guests tonight.</p><p>Ash, Serena, Bonnie, Clemont&ndash; and all those who had been the gym leaders at the time. Diantha, Steven, and Malva. Jessie, James, Professor Sycamore, Meyer, Mairin&hellip;</p><p>And him.</p><p>&ldquo;And what about Malva?&rdquo; Professor Sycamore asked. &ldquo;Do you feel she deserves to be here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Alain said&ndash; it was impossible to forget her standing by his and Ash&rsquo;s side as they faced Lysandre.</p><p>&ldquo;Then if Malva, who actively knew what Flare&rsquo;s goals were, deserves to be here,&rdquo; Professor Sycamore began. &ldquo;Then why on earth wouldn&rsquo;t you&ndash; someone who was giving everything he had for what he believed to be peace&ndash; deserve to be here as well?&rdquo; He gave him a soft smile. &ldquo;You have done nothing but good, Alain. You deserve to be called a hero.&rdquo;</p><p>Alain&rsquo;s throat felt tight. &ldquo;Th-thank you, Professor.&rdquo;</p><p>The professor clapped him on the back. &ldquo;Then why are we lingering back here? Let us join the others, embrace our old friends tonight, and wear the medals they have for us with honour!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;They have medals?&rdquo;</p><p>The professor paused. &ldquo;&hellip;I wasn&rsquo;t supposed to mention that. But yes, they do&ndash; the Lumiose mayor felt you guys didn&rsquo;t get enough recognition at the time, so&hellip; yeah. They have medals for us when we go on stage.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course they do&hellip;&rdquo; Alain muttered.</p><p>Professor Sycamore smirked slightly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re nervous though, is it?&rdquo;</p><p>A pink tinge came onto Alain&rsquo;s cheeks, and his heart once again began pounding in his chest.

Alain dug in his heels, not ready to face what would be awaiting him outside. &ldquo;You know Mairin loves you.&rdquo;</p><p>Mairin, just her name brought a smile to Alain&rsquo;s face.

What if she doesn&rsquo;t want to get married? Or just doesn&rsquo;t want to get married to me&ndash;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you see her face when she saw Serena&rsquo;s engagement ring?&rdquo; Sycamore asked, crossing his arms. &ldquo;Or her expression when she saw, um, what&rsquo;s her name&hellip; Jessie&rsquo;s wedding ring? Or how her and Bonnie just happen to go by wedding dress shops when they go out&ndash; and tend to discuss said dresses loudly when you happen to be in the room?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um, well&ndash;&rdquo; Alain began, the Sycamore cut him off.</p><p>&ldquo;Trust me, my boy, the only thing Mairin is going to say to you is yes,&rdquo; Sycamore said, and he let out a hardy laugh. &ldquo;Come on now, we can&rsquo;t hide away in the gym forever&ndash; let&rsquo;s go enjoy the rest of the celebration!&rdquo;</p><p>Alain&rsquo;s heart was still thumping nervously, but yet the professor&rsquo;s words had brought a sense of calm to him. He had no reason to panic over what Mairin would say&ndash; he loved her, he trusted her&ndash; and he knew that she would always stand by his side. Today was a day to celebrate the fall of the ones he had feared, the day his close friends had become heros. Even if he still doubted if that title could be held by him, he didn&rsquo;t doubt that those like Mairin and Ash deserved it.

Alain&rsquo;s hands were starting to feel sweaty as they accepted the medals, the moment he was awaiting and dreading rapidly approaching.</p><p>&ldquo;And finally,&rdquo; The mayor said, a gleam in his eyes as he looked back at them. &ldquo;We have the man who won the Kalos League all those years ago, and his girlfriend Mairin&ndash; both of whom stood on the front lines that dreaded night!&rdquo;</p><p>The crowd clapped as they stepped forward, Mairin giving him another smile, but Alain could only managed a small twitch in his lips. He wasn&rsquo;t quite sure how he was walking, his legs felt like they had become jelly, the whole world swaying under him. He swallowed, glancing at Mairin as their medals were brought forward. He didn&rsquo;t even look at his as it was handed to him, his eyes locked on her.</p><p>Another cheer was given, and Mairin looked ready to retreat back into their place in line, but Alain grabbed her wrist before she could. She looked up at him in confusion, either at the action, or perhaps she could hear the thundering of his heart. The mayor was grinning from ear to ear, Alain having informed him beforehand what he planned to do.</p><p>&ldquo;Now before we end this wonderful evening,&rdquo; The mayor said, his tone much softer, causing the audience to fall quieter in response. &ldquo;Alain has asked me to allow him a moment.&rdquo;</p><p>He stepped back, leaving him and Mairin in the center of the stage. The young woman looked confused, glancing at Alain for some explanation, and he swallowed. His mouth felt dry as he turned to face her, his hand sliding from her wrist, his fingers slipping between hers. Her bright amber eyes stared up at him, and for a moment that was his world&ndash; just him and her standing there in the silence.</p><p>&ldquo;Mairin,&rdquo; Alain began, his voice somehow much steadier than what he was feeling. &ldquo;I&hellip; I love you. I love you more than words can ever say.&rdquo;</p><p>It was almost startling how quiet the city was, everyone listening, waiting for him to continue. But his only focus was for Mairin, who was watching him in surprise. Alain was far from a public speaker, so of course him standing up here in front of everyone was far from what he&rsquo;d normally do.</p><p>But today was anything but normal.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve always been there for me,&rdquo; Alain continued. &ldquo;By my side, throughout all these years. Even when I&rsquo;m being an idiot&hellip; when I&rsquo;m being someone that doesn&rsquo;t deserve you&hellip; you still support me, you still love me.&rdquo;</p><p>His hand reached into his pocket, slowly grasping the ring box.</p><p>&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t want that to end, Mairin, I want you to always be with me,&rdquo; Alain said, and a blush was beginning to fill Mairin&rsquo;s face. Her eyes flickered down to his hand, her eyes widening as she spotted the small box.</p><p>Alain went down onto one knee, and a hush ran through the crowd. Tears stung Mairin&rsquo;s eyes, a smile spreading across her reddening face as he brought the box up. The words were on his lips, his hands trembling as held the box with the ring. His mouth opened, ready to ask her the question he had been wanting to for so long&hellip;</p><p>But before he could say a word, a loud bang echoed across the plaza. His ears were ringing from the sound, everyone recoiling from the intensity, panicked cries filling the air. Everyone&rsquo;s eyes turned out towards the crowd, where bursts of bright lights could be seen&ndash; the glow of many Pokemon being released from their Pokeballs all at once.</p><p>The low growls of the Pokemon could be heard, the people who had released them slowly coming forward. Alain tensed, eyes scanning the crowd, disbelief filling his gaze. For a moment he couldn&rsquo;t move, telling himself that what he was seeing wasn&rsquo;t real. And if it was, it was nothing but a cruel joke. There was nothing left of them&ndash; nothing left after their leader had fallen.</p><p>But yet he was seeing dozens Team Flare Grunts.</p><p>Another loud blast echoed across the plaza&ndash; fire and smoke engulfing one of the nearby buildings. That was when the real screams filled the air, cries of fear and surprise calling out in terror. The Pokemon that had been released turned, releasing attacks within the crowds.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t just in the audience, grunts also began to flood the stage they stood on.</p><p>The small box dropped to the floor at Alain&rsquo;s feet. He could hardly register what was happening, the sheer confusion momentarily overcoming the reality of what he was seeing. None of it felt real&ndash; it couldn&rsquo;t be real&ndash; his entire body going numb from the shock of it all. He noticed Mairin out of the corner of his eyes. Her trembling hands were clamped over her ears, her eyes shut as she stood frozen in place.</p><p>This snapped him out of his trance, and without a second thought he felt himself reaching out and pulling Mairin in close, still trying to process what was happening.</p><p>Screams shook through his bones as a wave of terror struck through the crowd. A strange hissing noise filled his ears and the next thing he knew the entire stage was shrouded in a heavy, eerie gas.</p><p>Fighting through the shock, Alain swung his gaze towards where the grunts had been before. Standing in their place was lines of Pokemon, some of which were ones that Alain recognized painfully from the time he had spent working for Lysandre.</p><p>The front line consisted of Swalot and Muks creeping forward, ooze dripping from their slimy forms. Their mouths hung open, streams of Poison Gas pouring from them as they approached the stage. Scattered through the crowds Alain could see Houndours and Houndooms being released from their Pokeballs, Magmars joining them with a suffocating Smog attack. Weezings hovered above the stage and the audience, Alain could only guess that the thick gas pouring from them was a Smokescreen.</p><p>The moves being released cloaked the entire plaza in a black cloud. The smoke stung Alain&rsquo;s eyes, filling his lungs as he tried to breath. Coughing began to overtake the screaming, and panic raced through him. Smokescreen was one thing, but the other plumes would be poisonous, if they were to breath that in&hellip;</p><p>Alain immediately moved so that Mairin was tucked safely against his chest, his arm moving to cover her face as best he could in hopes of stopping the poisonous fumes from getting to her. Tears stung his eyes, the bitterness of the Smokescreen making his eyes water painfully. He still could barely see&ndash; those on stage mere silhouettes against the black air.</p><p>That was when something yanked forcefully at his shoulders, tearing him away from Mairin. Alain struggled furiously the moment he felt himself being distanced from her, but she seemed to be getting farther away despite his efforts, something pulling her away from him. Vision only getting worse, Alain could scarcely make out another silhouette dragging her out of sight. </p><p>&ldquo;S-serena!&rdquo; Ash&rsquo;s voice cried out from somewhere to his left. </p><p>Alain&rsquo;s heart was thumping, attempting to break free of whoever was holding him back, but the moment he pulled free two more people seized him. He was hacking on the smoke-filled air, a desperation running through him&ndash; he had to get to Mairin!</p><p>Other people were shouting, he recognized the voices, but barely registered their words. He caught a brief glimpse of one of the people holding him back&ndash; eerie goggles and a mask covering their face, sheltering them from the smoke. Alain let out another strangled cough, lashing out against them.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare touch my husband you&ndash;!&rdquo; A female voice snarled, followed by the crack of a punch. &ldquo;Let go of me you&ndash;!&rdquo;</p><p>Alain wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was the many cries drowning out each other, or if the lack of oxygen was starting to reach him. His limited vision was blurring, his struggling starting to become weaker. His arms were harshly yanked behind his back, the grunts shoving him to the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;M-m-mair&ndash;&rdquo; He coughed out.</p><p>A rope cut into his wrists, binding his hands together. The desperation in his struggle resurged as they began to drag him away, and through the fading smoke he could see other figures as he was dragged and then restrained against the ground. A ragged breath got caught in his throat when he found the professor laying next to him, a bruise on his face, arms also bound behind his back. </p><p>Alain rolled over, attempting to sit up, only to be shoved back to the ground. Out of the corner of his eye he could have sworn he saw a grunt appear out of thin air, grabbing Malva as she struggled against them. Breathing became slightly easier with the fumes in the air starting to fade, but in his panic he didn&rsquo;t even care. He could make out Steven slamming into a grunt, knocking her back just in time to spin around to punch another one away.</p><p>The grunts hesitated, clearly not wanting to get close to the champion.</p><p>&ldquo;We have the ones the boss wanted!&rdquo; A grunt shouted. &ldquo;Fall out!&rdquo;</p><p>Alain heard the sound of another Pokeball opening, peering up in time to see a Hypno standing over them. The Pokemon gave them a jagged grin, swinging the pendulum in its hand. A white glow filled the air surrounding them&ndash; the energy of the Teleport twisting around them, before whisking them away. </p>",

He glanced around for a moment, before pulling it out when he saw he was alone.

His heart thumped nervously as he stared down at the small object, a wave of fear washing over him.</p>\n<p>A slim silver ring gleamed up at him.</p>\n</p>",
