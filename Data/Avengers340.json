Bucky Barnes recovers, lots of angst, feelings, Good Bros and vine references.</p><p>Words: 2826, Chapters: 1/?, Language: English</p><ul><li>Fandoms: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Captain%20America%20(Movies)/works\">Captain America (Movies)</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Captain%20America%20-%20All%20Media%20Types/works\">Captain America - All Media Types</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/The%20Avengers%20(Marvel%20Movies)/works\">The Avengers (Marvel Movies)</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/The%20Avengers%20(Marvel)%20-%20All%20Media%20Types/works\">The Avengers (Marvel) - All Media Types</a></li><li>Rating: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Not%20Rated/works\">Not Rated</a></li><li>Warnings: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Graphic%20Depictions%20Of%20Violence/works\">Graphic Depictions Of Violence</a></li><li>Categories: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/F*s*M/works\">F/M</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/M*s*M/works\">M/M</a></li><li>Characters: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Steve%20Rogers/works\">Steve Rogers</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/James%20%22Bucky%22%20Barnes/works\">James &ldquo;Bucky&rdquo;

That\u2019s why it had taken S.H.I.E.L.D. so long to trace the source.\nThe Russian and the Super Soldier stood in a corner of the showroom, pretending\nto be engrossed in analyzing a piece by some Impressionist artist or another. In\nan escaped second, the room was deafeningly silent, and the sound of retreating\nfootsteps brought the Soldier and the Russian around. The Spy hurried after\nthem with a determined step.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cI guess we\u2019ll be going then,\u201d Steve sighed\nand followed after his friend, ready for a fight. The two Avengers looked\naround the room, observing the guests. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cSteve, not all of them are wearing the\nblack bands around their wrists. See?\u201d Natasha whispered into his ear, pointing\nat the group of people standing in front of them. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cInteresting. Also, why would art\nenthusiasts would be standing in a room full of amazing sculptures but pay no\nattention to them and stare at the staircase instead?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cYeah\u2026 you\u2019re right. And with such\nanticipation too?\u201d The Spy furrowed her brow and moved her hand to the close of\nthe slit on her skirt, letting it rest over the gun strapped to her thigh.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cI guess we\u2019ll wait and see.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 The chamber musicians put a halt to their\nplaying, and the lights dimmed significantly, forcing their eyes to rely on the\nvague illumination that the bluish lights in the floor provided. The silence\nmade them anxious. The hammering heartbeats of the people around them seem to\necho against the walls. Much to their dismay, the sound of clicking heels\nagainst the marble floor accompanied each <i>thump\n</i>seamlessly. It was a rather morbid experience. </p><p> \u00a0 Steve was unsure if he should breath and\nrisk disturbing the waters. He was sure wicked creatures waited beneath its\nsurface. The steps began to sound louder and stopped. A woman of dubious nature\nstood at the top of the stairs, a glass of wine hung idly from her right hand.\nShe was clothed in ivory silk, adorned with black pearls, and cloaked in sin,\nand the sight of her made the Soldier gasp for air. The ever-stoic Spy beside\nhim had retrieved her hand from its position over her weapon, not wanting to\nlook away from the alluring creature before her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cWelcome, all,\u201d her voice rang clear in a\nsultry purr, \u201cTo the Gallery.\u201d Her piercing eyes scanned the room and her lips\ncurled in a tantalizing grin. Her victims clapped, endearingly oblivious of\nhaving become victims as soon as they had entered through the crystal-encrusted\ndoors. \u201cIt is an indescribable <i>pleasure </i>to\nsee you all here tonight. I sure hope you brought your monsters along.\u201d Some\nguests around them laughed as if her words had been a delightful joke; other\nguests admired the woman with glazed eyes. \u201cNow, I know that the night is\nshort, and you have all been awfully patient. To our VIP guests, thank you for\nyour un<i>dying </i>support. The Gallery\nwouldn\u2019t have happened without you. A round of applause for our VIP guests,\nplease,\u201d the woman clapped her hands in initiative and the rest of the crowd\nsoon joined her.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cLook at that woman over there. She looks\nridiculously smug,\u201d the Russian pointed out, breaking Steve from his trance.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cAnd she\u2019s wearing a black band.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cStay sharp, Rogers. That woman might just\nbe who we\u2019re looking for.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 <i>No,\nshe isn\u2019t! </i>His heart insisted, but his mind was quick to silence it after\nthe Spy\u2019s remark. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cWith no further do, enjoy the Exhibit.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 As if by command, works of art incarnate\nstepped off the walls and closed in around the crowd, sauntering and smirking\nas if all the nights in history were compressed into their cores. Natasha\npulled Steve back by the elbow, bumping against two tall men. Her hand returned\nto her thigh, a decision away from shooting. The two Avengers noticed that the\n\u201cexhibits\u201d clung to the VIP guests, caressing and whispering and taunting\nbefore whisking them away behind curtains. The band began to play a lively jazz\ntune, and the Spy pulled the Soldier to the middle of the floor, away from the\nbouncers. Steve quickly fell into step with Natasha, leaning his face against\nher hand as she stroked his cheek \u201clovingly\u201d. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cKiss me,\u201d she whispered for the watching\ncrowd, using the opportunity to speak into the mic hidden in the collar of his\nshirt, \u201cStark, stay alert. This is about to get ugly.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s alright. Point Break is about to\ncrash in through the windows right about\u2026now,\u201d Tony Stark replied into her\nearpiece, \u201cReindeer Games tried to stop him but hey, Asgardians.\u201d Steve\u2019s\nslight nod made her understand that he was told as well. The plan was set into\nmotion. The sound of crashing glass sent the crowd into a frenzy as a lightning\nbolt struck the marble floor. The bewilderment was fed when a blond man stood\nin the cracked stone and a dark-haired man emerged from seemingly nowhere. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cHonestly, Thor, this was exactly what we\nwere told to not do,\u201d the raven-haired god snapped, daggers at the ready. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cHush, brother, there are Brother Rogers and\nLady Romanoff! Has the fight begun?\u201d The Thunderer asked with a wave at his\nteammates.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cNow it has,\u201d Natasha replied, guns in both\nhands, \u201cWe have to find <i>her</i>. Loki,\ncome with me. Steve and Thor, you\u2019re both preoccupied already.\u201d She nodded at\nthe approaching bouncers. The Russian spoke into her mic, \u201cStark, scan the\nbuilding and find the victims.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d the Tycoon replied, and\nNatasha could swear she could hear <i>Rio </i>by\nDuran Duran playing faintly in the background, \u201cBuck-Buck is headed your way\nnow.\u201d </p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u201cSpotted him,\u201d the Spy signaled at the White\nWolf and the Trickster to follow her, and the trio made their way down the\nhalls in search of their villain.\u00a0</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>\u00a0Your hands trembled,\nmaking you drop the bullets all across the tiled floor. You cursed and threw\nthe gun to the side; it was useless to you by now. Your personal mission had\nbeen accomplished that night; you had avenged your father. You were sure that\nwoman had paid her dues in the hands of your \u2018exhibits\u2019. The rest could go to\nhell. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cHands in the air where I can see them,\u201d you\nheard a female voice command. You decided to oblige with a smirk. Slowly, you\nturned around and lifted your hands to the air.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cOh, hello,\u201d you crooned, \u201cI saw you earlier\nat the gathering. I must say, you are quite beautiful. You look stunning in\nthat dress, Black Widow.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cEnough sweet talk, Renderer,\u201d the Widow\nturned to the deity beside her. You recognized him from the Stuttgart and New\nYork incidents. You also noticed the power-repressing cuffs in his hands, the\nones used on mutants. A familiar stinging sensation on your eyes urged you to\nstrengthen your act. You lowered your hands and outstretched them before you.\nYou didn\u2019t want to kill them\u2026 but give them a fight? Why not? You visualized\nher cardiovascular system, the intricate paths of veins and arteries and\ncapillaries. It was beautiful. You curled your fingers in, slowing the flow of\nher bloodstream. The fear in her eyes turned to determination, so you pulled in\na bit more. Once you were sure she wouldn\u2019t be able defend herself, you kicked\nthe Russian in the gut, making her groan in the heightened sense of pain that\nthe effects of your power provided. </p><p> \u00a0 You ran, leaving the Widow crumbled in the\nfloor; her previous state of health would take some time to return, time you\nwere planning to use at your advantage. Down the hall, you spotted the Winter\nSoldier and the God of Mischief himself running towards you. You were quick to\nslow the human\u2019s system, but the god? There was nothing, no life. The living\nscared you more than the unliving, so you ignored the illusion, elbowed the\nhuman in the back and continued your escape. You reached the staircase in which\nyou had welcomed your guests before and saw the rest of the Avengers. A satisfied\nsmile rose to your lips as you heard the sounds of slowing hearts fill the air.\nYou had won. </p><p> \u00a0 Or so you thought.</p><p> \u00a0 Iron Man landed in front of you, startling\nyou and breaking your concentration. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cThe man with no heart.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be at home asleep? Tonight\u2019s\na school night, and I don\u2019t know much about kids, but I know that they should\ngo to sleep at nine o\u2019clock every night,\u201d the Tycoon spoke from inside his\nsuit.</p><p> \u00a0 Your hands were suddenly pulled to the front\nof your body, and a pair of power-repressing handcuffs encircled your wrists.\nYou recognized the dark-haired man immediately, and you grinned sheepishly as\nyou noticed the two Avengers flanking him.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cOhhh\u2026God of Mischief, what a pleasure it is\nto meet you. I ran into one of your illusions earlier, almost fooled me,\u201d you\npurred, \u201cIf I promise to be good, would you show me some tricks?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cPerhaps,\u201d Loki replied with no evidence of\nmirth. You knew he could see right through you. The sight of the handcuffs\nbrought you painful memories, and he knew it. Immediately, you felt the numbing\nsensation of your powers sinking into the marrow of your bones. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cWinter Soldier,\u201d you cooed, amused by the\ntrio before you, \u201cMight I say that you\u2019re positively legendary?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cWhite Wolf.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cAh,\nreformed, aren\u2019t we? How sweet.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 The Russian glared at you to remain silent,\nobviously displeased with your manhandling her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re coming with us, Renderer,\u201d Natasha\ngrabbed you by the cuffs and led you out of your \u2018beloved\u2019 gallery. You wished\nit would burn.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p><b>One\nWeek Later</b></p><p> \u00a0 \u201cY/N?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 You looked up from your drawing to see Steve\nRogers standing at your doorway. He had a plate in his hands, and by what you\ncould smell, he carried pizza.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cI figured you might be hungry, so I brought\nyou some pizza,\u201d Steve stepped into your room cautiously, as if to not incite\nyou to pounce. You had no desire to harm him, and even if you did, the cuffs\nTony had fashioned for you wouldn\u2019t allow you to hurt him. These new cuffs had\nno link in between, which allowed you to move your hands freely, but they still\nrepressed your abilities. You remained silent as you watched him place the\nplate on the desk from your place on the bed. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cWell\u2026 if you need anything, don\u2019t hesitate\nto ask.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 You wanted to ask when they would set you\nfree. You wanted to ask if S.H.I.E.L.D. would be testing you. You hated\nneedles. You wanted to ask if S.H.I.E.L.D. would prod you with needles. But all\nyou could do was glare at the back of his head as he walked away. Your pride\nhardened your spine.</p><p><b>Three\nWeeks Later</b></p><p> \u00a0 \u201cYou need to learn to defend yourself. Don\u2019t\nget me wrong, those powers of yours are pretty damn impressive. However, your\nself-defense skills are pitiful,\u201d Tony stated bluntly, offering you some\nblueberries, \u201cNat\u2019s gonna teach you martial arts. Loki offered to teach you how\nto wield daggers. Buck\u2019s gonna teach you how to fire a gun\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cI pass.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cSorry, kid. I wasn\u2019t asking you if you were\nup to it.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cYou can\u2019t make me, Stark.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cThose cute bracelets tell me otherwise.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 The man was infuriating\u2026 you kinda liked\nhim.</p><p><b>Three\nWeeks Later </b></p><p> \u00a0 You were sitting on a stool, cradling your\nbandaged ankle. Despite your efforts of staying away, you had agreed to taking\nthe lessons. Nick Fury had even recommended the team took you out for a\nmission, as long as it was a simple one and your powers remained repressed for\nthe time being. Grace wasn\u2019t one of your most notable traits. While trying to\naim a kick too high for your extensions, you twisted your ankle. Of course, you\nrefused to admit this. You had found a unused bandage on your first-aid kit and\ntreated to your injured ankle yourself. </p><p> \u00a0 The team was gathered in the living room\ncelebrating their success. You wanted to join them so badly, but your pride\nforced you to remain in your seat. You could <i>sense</i> their laughter rushing through their veins. It was warm and\ninviting, almost made you laugh along. However, you ignored them and proceeded\nto nibble on a piece of Wonder bread. The smell of Chinese food was also\nawfully appetizing and made your snack seem ridiculous. The laughter felt a bit\nmore emphasized now. That meant somebody was approaching you. Effectively, you\nlooked to your left to meet the smiling eyes of Bruce Banner.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cHey, you did good out there today.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 You gave the gentle man a small, almost\nimperceptible, grin. You had a soft spot for the Doctor. He was docile and\ngenuine, and the Other Guy was also high on your list of favorite people.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cNo problem,\u201d Banner seemed to hesitate for\na moment, \u201cWon\u2019t you join us? There\u2019s enough food to go around, and to be\nhonest with you, we\u2019re all curious about you, Y/N.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cCurious? About me?\u201d <i>Well, that\u2019s definitely new.</i></p><p> \u00a0 Bruce nodded and offered you a smile,\nshowing you were indeed welcome. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cAlright.\u201d Carefully, you got off the stool\nand followed him into the living room. You surveyed the room. Everybody was so\ncasual and relaxed, like normal people. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cLady Y/N! You have decided to join us! Great!\nHave you tried that chicken lathered in the odd red sauce? It is my favorite.\u201d\nYou did your best to keep yourself from smiling. Thor was the very definition\nof sunshine. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cActually, I haven\u2019t tried it. I\u2019ll try it\nnow.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 Bucky gave you a small grin and scooted to\nthe side, giving you a spot on the carpet beside him. You looked around for any\nsigns of discomfort, but having found just acceptance and friendliness, you sat\nbeside the White Wolf and served yourself some sweet and sour chicken and some\nfried rice. Soon, you were swept by light friendly chatter, and you could feel\nyourself thawing for them, eager to let this odd family into your life. You wanted\nto be part of that family before you desperately. </p><p><b>One\nMonth Later</b></p><p> \u00a0 It all happened so fast. </p><p> \u00a0 You just knew you couldn\u2019t let Steve get\nshot. </p><p> \u00a0 No, not him.</p><p> \u00a0 You\npressed your hand to your ribs in astonishment. A bullet had entered your body.\nYou had felt it ricochet inside you. But the team needed your help, so you\nfocused all your energy on crushing airways and stopping hearts from pumping\nblood regardless of your own failing system. </p><p> \u00a0 The Avengers had won, as per usual, but Clint\nhad received the ugliest blow. You averted your gaze from his protruding femur\nand concentrated on holding unto your body. The after-battle banter started\nbetween Clint and Natasha, something about Budapest you couldn\u2019t quite grasp.\nThen it moved on to Thor and Loki spewing embarrassing stories about each\nother. Soon you were being teased by Bucky, and even in your hazy state, you\nthrew some remarks towards him, making him laugh in spite of his own injuries. However,\nNatasha seemed to pick up on your strained voice.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cY/N, are you injured?\u201d Natasha asked,\neyeing your leather jacket (which you had zipped closed some time along the\nfight to cover the bullet hole), not fully trusting your judgment when it came\nto injuries. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re pale. Nat, she\u2019s pale,\u201d Clint\ngrunted, tugging at Natasha\u2019s sleeve.</p><p> \u00a0 Loki removed your jacket in a ripple of\ngreen, and his eyes instantly fell on your ruined suit, \u201cLady Y/N\u2026\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 You couldn\u2019t hear the end of his sentence.\u00a0</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>The annoying beeping of a\nmachine brought you around. Your groggy eyes struggled to focus on the various\ntubes and machinery. The smell\u2026 a hospital\u2026 you hated hospitals. Your father\nwas smothered to death in a hospital. </p><p> \u00a0 A tall man in white sauntered into the room,\n\u201cAh, you\u2019re awake! Excellent. My name\u2019s Dr. Strange, and I\u2019m here to inform you\nthat a ragtag group of people in tight clothing have been waiting to hear from\nyou for hours. They keep asking about you, and to be frank, they\u2019ve been\nscaring my nurses. So, I\u2019ll just let them in now.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 In a blur, the Avengers rushed into your\nroom and flocked your bed. Tony and Bruce were quick to interrogate the doctor.\nThe Asgardians professed their displeasure about the thin white blankets and\nproceeded to remove their capes to cover you with them. Natasha pushed the\nwheelchair in which Clint was sitting on to your bedside and began to fill you\nin on everything that you had missed, including the fact that Tony had\nconsidered adopting you in order to get your information from the nurses, \u201cHe\nstarted to rant in the waiting room. I swear, he even cursed on the name of\nwhoever it was that came up with the patient confidentiality law\u2026 I\u2019ll show you\nthe video later.\u201d \u00a0 </p><p> \u00a0 Then came Steve Rogers, and the room fell\nsilent. The doctor excused himself and closed the door after him to give you\nall some privacy. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to take that bullet, Y/N,\u201d\nSteve carefully sat beside you, smoothing your hair back, \u201cBut you did, and I\u2019m\nforever indebted to you. \u2018Thank you\u2019 will never suffice. You\u2019re mighty brave, kid.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 You looked around you, drinking in the bruised\nand scratched faces of your new family. Yes\u2026 family. Family never abandons, and\nthey refused to abandon you. And they sat on uncomfortable chairs. And they\nscared nurses\u2026 all for you. Tears spilled from your eyes, and you let them; you\nfelt safe and ready to step out from behind the cover of villainy. You didn\u2019t need\nit anymore, and they knew it. The kiss Natasha pressed to your forehead was enough\nproof.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cAccording to the Mr. Weird, you\u2019re ready to\ngo home, kid,\u201d Tony chirped, clearly uncomfortable with the warm atmosphere. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cHome?\u201d Your voice was a mere whisper, but to\nyou, it was the loudest word you had ever uttered. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cHome.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>Author\u2019s Note:</b></p><p><b>Hey, lovelies!

That\u2019s why it had taken S.H.I.E.L.D. so long to trace the source.\nThe Russian and the Super Soldier stood in a corner of the showroom, pretending\nto be engrossed in analyzing a piece by some Impressionist artist or another. In\nan escaped second, the room was deafeningly silent, and the sound of retreating\nfootsteps brought the Soldier and the Russian around. The Spy hurried after\nthem with a determined step.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cI guess we\u2019ll be going then,\u201d Steve sighed\nand followed after his friend, ready for a fight. The two Avengers looked\naround the room, observing the guests. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cSteve, not all of them are wearing the\nblack bands around their wrists. See?\u201d Natasha whispered into his ear, pointing\nat the group of people standing in front of them. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cInteresting. Also, why would art\nenthusiasts would be standing in a room full of amazing sculptures but pay no\nattention to them and stare at the staircase instead?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cYeah\u2026 you\u2019re right. And with such\nanticipation too?\u201d The Spy furrowed her brow and moved her hand to the close of\nthe slit on her skirt, letting it rest over the gun strapped to her thigh.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cI guess we\u2019ll wait and see.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 The chamber musicians put a halt to their\nplaying, and the lights dimmed significantly, forcing their eyes to rely on the\nvague illumination that the bluish lights in the floor provided. The silence\nmade them anxious. The hammering heartbeats of the people around them seem to\necho against the walls. Much to their dismay, the sound of clicking heels\nagainst the marble floor accompanied each <i>thump\n</i>seamlessly. It was a rather morbid experience. </p><p> \u00a0 Steve was unsure if he should breath and\nrisk disturbing the waters. He was sure wicked creatures waited beneath its\nsurface. The steps began to sound louder and stopped. A woman of dubious nature\nstood at the top of the stairs, a glass of wine hung idly from her right hand.\nShe was clothed in ivory silk, adorned with black pearls, and cloaked in sin,\nand the sight of her made the Soldier gasp for air. The ever-stoic Spy beside\nhim had retrieved her hand from its position over her weapon, not wanting to\nlook away from the alluring creature before her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cWelcome, all,\u201d her voice rang clear in a\nsultry purr, \u201cTo the Gallery.\u201d Her piercing eyes scanned the room and her lips\ncurled in a tantalizing grin. Her victims clapped, endearingly oblivious of\nhaving become victims as soon as they had entered through the crystal-encrusted\ndoors. \u201cIt is an indescribable <i>pleasure </i>to\nsee you all here tonight. I sure hope you brought your monsters along.\u201d Some\nguests around them laughed as if her words had been a delightful joke; other\nguests admired the woman with glazed eyes. \u201cNow, I know that the night is\nshort, and you have all been awfully patient. To our VIP guests, thank you for\nyour un<i>dying </i>support. The Gallery\nwouldn\u2019t have happened without you. A round of applause for our VIP guests,\nplease,\u201d the woman clapped her hands in initiative and the rest of the crowd\nsoon joined her.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cLook at that woman over there. She looks\nridiculously smug,\u201d the Russian pointed out, breaking Steve from his trance.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cAnd she\u2019s wearing a black band.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cStay sharp, Rogers. That woman might just\nbe who we\u2019re looking for.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 <i>No,\nshe isn\u2019t! </i>His heart insisted, but his mind was quick to silence it after\nthe Spy\u2019s remark. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cWith no further do, enjoy the Exhibit.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 As if by command, works of art incarnate\nstepped off the walls and closed in around the crowd, sauntering and smirking\nas if all the nights in history were compressed into their cores. Natasha\npulled Steve back by the elbow, bumping against two tall men. Her hand returned\nto her thigh, a decision away from shooting. The two Avengers noticed that the\n\u201cexhibits\u201d clung to the VIP guests, caressing and whispering and taunting\nbefore whisking them away behind curtains. The band began to play a lively jazz\ntune, and the Spy pulled the Soldier to the middle of the floor, away from the\nbouncers. Steve quickly fell into step with Natasha, leaning his face against\nher hand as she stroked his cheek \u201clovingly\u201d. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cKiss me,\u201d she whispered for the watching\ncrowd, using the opportunity to speak into the mic hidden in the collar of his\nshirt, \u201cStark, stay alert. This is about to get ugly.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s alright. Point Break is about to\ncrash in through the windows right about\u2026now,\u201d Tony Stark replied into her\nearpiece, \u201cReindeer Games tried to stop him but hey, Asgardians.\u201d Steve\u2019s\nslight nod made her understand that he was told as well. The plan was set into\nmotion. The sound of crashing glass sent the crowd into a frenzy as a lightning\nbolt struck the marble floor. The bewilderment was fed when a blond man stood\nin the cracked stone and a dark-haired man emerged from seemingly nowhere. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cHonestly, Thor, this was exactly what we\nwere told to not do,\u201d the raven-haired god snapped, daggers at the ready. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cHush, brother, there are Brother Rogers and\nLady Romanoff! Has the fight begun?\u201d The Thunderer asked with a wave at his\nteammates.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cNow it has,\u201d Natasha replied, guns in both\nhands, \u201cWe have to find <i>her</i>. Loki,\ncome with me. Steve and Thor, you\u2019re both preoccupied already.\u201d She nodded at\nthe approaching bouncers. The Russian spoke into her mic, \u201cStark, scan the\nbuilding and find the victims.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d the Tycoon replied, and\nNatasha could swear she could hear <i>Rio </i>by\nDuran Duran playing faintly in the background, \u201cBuck-Buck is headed your way\nnow.\u201d </p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u201cSpotted him,\u201d the Spy signaled at the White\nWolf and the Trickster to follow her, and the trio made their way down the\nhalls in search of their villain.\u00a0</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p>\u00a0Your hands trembled,\nmaking you drop the bullets all across the tiled floor. You cursed and threw\nthe gun to the side; it was useless to you by now. Your personal mission had\nbeen accomplished that night; you had avenged your father. You were sure that\nwoman had paid her dues in the hands of your \u2018exhibits\u2019. The rest could go to\nhell. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cHands in the air where I can see them,\u201d you\nheard a female voice command. You decided to oblige with a smirk. Slowly, you\nturned around and lifted your hands to the air.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cOh, hello,\u201d you crooned, \u201cI saw you earlier\nat the gathering. I must say, you are quite beautiful. You look stunning in\nthat dress, Black Widow.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cEnough sweet talk, Renderer,\u201d the Widow\nturned to the deity beside her. You recognized him from the Stuttgart and New\nYork incidents. You also noticed the power-repressing cuffs in his hands, the\nones used on mutants. A familiar stinging sensation on your eyes urged you to\nstrengthen your act. You lowered your hands and outstretched them before you.\nYou didn\u2019t want to kill them\u2026 but give them a fight? Why not? You visualized\nher cardiovascular system, the intricate paths of veins and arteries and\ncapillaries. It was beautiful. You curled your fingers in, slowing the flow of\nher bloodstream. The fear in her eyes turned to determination, so you pulled in\na bit more. Once you were sure she wouldn\u2019t be able defend herself, you kicked\nthe Russian in the gut, making her groan in the heightened sense of pain that\nthe effects of your power provided. </p><p> \u00a0 You ran, leaving the Widow crumbled in the\nfloor; her previous state of health would take some time to return, time you\nwere planning to use at your advantage. Down the hall, you spotted the Winter\nSoldier and the God of Mischief himself running towards you. You were quick to\nslow the human\u2019s system, but the god? There was nothing, no life. The living\nscared you more than the unliving, so you ignored the illusion, elbowed the\nhuman in the back and continued your escape. You reached the staircase in which\nyou had welcomed your guests before and saw the rest of the Avengers. A satisfied\nsmile rose to your lips as you heard the sounds of slowing hearts fill the air.\nYou had won. </p><p> \u00a0 Or so you thought.</p><p> \u00a0 Iron Man landed in front of you, startling\nyou and breaking your concentration. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cThe man with no heart.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be at home asleep? Tonight\u2019s\na school night, and I don\u2019t know much about kids, but I know that they should\ngo to sleep at nine o\u2019clock every night,\u201d the Tycoon spoke from inside his\nsuit.</p><p> \u00a0 Your hands were suddenly pulled to the front\nof your body, and a pair of power-repressing handcuffs encircled your wrists.\nYou recognized the dark-haired man immediately, and you grinned sheepishly as\nyou noticed the two Avengers flanking him.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cOhhh\u2026God of Mischief, what a pleasure it is\nto meet you. I ran into one of your illusions earlier, almost fooled me,\u201d you\npurred, \u201cIf I promise to be good, would you show me some tricks?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cPerhaps,\u201d Loki replied with no evidence of\nmirth. You knew he could see right through you. The sight of the handcuffs\nbrought you painful memories, and he knew it. Immediately, you felt the numbing\nsensation of your powers sinking into the marrow of your bones. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cWinter Soldier,\u201d you cooed, amused by the\ntrio before you, \u201cMight I say that you\u2019re positively legendary?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cWhite Wolf.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cAh,\nreformed, aren\u2019t we? How sweet.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 The Russian glared at you to remain silent,\nobviously displeased with your manhandling her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re coming with us, Renderer,\u201d Natasha\ngrabbed you by the cuffs and led you out of your \u2018beloved\u2019 gallery. You wished\nit would burn.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p><b>One\nWeek Later</b></p><p> \u00a0 \u201cY/N?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 You looked up from your drawing to see Steve\nRogers standing at your doorway. He had a plate in his hands, and by what you\ncould smell, he carried pizza.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cI figured you might be hungry, so I brought\nyou some pizza,\u201d Steve stepped into your room cautiously, as if to not incite\nyou to pounce. You had no desire to harm him, and even if you did, the cuffs\nTony had fashioned for you wouldn\u2019t allow you to hurt him. These new cuffs had\nno link in between, which allowed you to move your hands freely, but they still\nrepressed your abilities. You remained silent as you watched him place the\nplate on the desk from your place on the bed. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cWell\u2026 if you need anything, don\u2019t hesitate\nto ask.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 You wanted to ask when they would set you\nfree. You wanted to ask if S.H.I.E.L.D. would be testing you. You hated\nneedles. You wanted to ask if S.H.I.E.L.D. would prod you with needles. But all\nyou could do was glare at the back of his head as he walked away. Your pride\nhardened your spine.</p><p><b>Three\nWeeks Later</b></p><p> \u00a0 \u201cYou need to learn to defend yourself. Don\u2019t\nget me wrong, those powers of yours are pretty damn impressive. However, your\nself-defense skills are pitiful,\u201d Tony stated bluntly, offering you some\nblueberries, \u201cNat\u2019s gonna teach you martial arts. Loki offered to teach you how\nto wield daggers. Buck\u2019s gonna teach you how to fire a gun\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cI pass.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cSorry, kid. I wasn\u2019t asking you if you were\nup to it.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cYou can\u2019t make me, Stark.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cThose cute bracelets tell me otherwise.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 The man was infuriating\u2026 you kinda liked\nhim.</p><p><b>Three\nWeeks Later </b></p><p> \u00a0 You were sitting on a stool, cradling your\nbandaged ankle. Despite your efforts of staying away, you had agreed to taking\nthe lessons. Nick Fury had even recommended the team took you out for a\nmission, as long as it was a simple one and your powers remained repressed for\nthe time being. Grace wasn\u2019t one of your most notable traits. While trying to\naim a kick too high for your extensions, you twisted your ankle. Of course, you\nrefused to admit this. You had found a unused bandage on your first-aid kit and\ntreated to your injured ankle yourself. </p><p> \u00a0 The team was gathered in the living room\ncelebrating their success. You wanted to join them so badly, but your pride\nforced you to remain in your seat. You could <i>sense</i> their laughter rushing through their veins. It was warm and\ninviting, almost made you laugh along. However, you ignored them and proceeded\nto nibble on a piece of Wonder bread. The smell of Chinese food was also\nawfully appetizing and made your snack seem ridiculous. The laughter felt a bit\nmore emphasized now. That meant somebody was approaching you. Effectively, you\nlooked to your left to meet the smiling eyes of Bruce Banner.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cHey, you did good out there today.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 You gave the gentle man a small, almost\nimperceptible, grin. You had a soft spot for the Doctor. He was docile and\ngenuine, and the Other Guy was also high on your list of favorite people.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cNo problem,\u201d Banner seemed to hesitate for\na moment, \u201cWon\u2019t you join us? There\u2019s enough food to go around, and to be\nhonest with you, we\u2019re all curious about you, Y/N.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cCurious? About me?\u201d <i>Well, that\u2019s definitely new.</i></p><p> \u00a0 Bruce nodded and offered you a smile,\nshowing you were indeed welcome. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cAlright.\u201d Carefully, you got off the stool\nand followed him into the living room. You surveyed the room. Everybody was so\ncasual and relaxed, like normal people. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cLady Y/N! You have decided to join us! Great!\nHave you tried that chicken lathered in the odd red sauce? It is my favorite.\u201d\nYou did your best to keep yourself from smiling. Thor was the very definition\nof sunshine. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cActually, I haven\u2019t tried it. I\u2019ll try it\nnow.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 Bucky gave you a small grin and scooted to\nthe side, giving you a spot on the carpet beside him. You looked around for any\nsigns of discomfort, but having found just acceptance and friendliness, you sat\nbeside the White Wolf and served yourself some sweet and sour chicken and some\nfried rice. Soon, you were swept by light friendly chatter, and you could feel\nyourself thawing for them, eager to let this odd family into your life. You wanted\nto be part of that family before you desperately. </p><p><b>One\nMonth Later</b></p><p> \u00a0 It all happened so fast. </p><p> \u00a0 You just knew you couldn\u2019t let Steve get\nshot. </p><p> \u00a0 No, not him.</p><p> \u00a0 You\npressed your hand to your ribs in astonishment. A bullet had entered your body.\nYou had felt it ricochet inside you. But the team needed your help, so you\nfocused all your energy on crushing airways and stopping hearts from pumping\nblood regardless of your own failing system. </p><p> \u00a0 The Avengers had won, as per usual, but Clint\nhad received the ugliest blow. You averted your gaze from his protruding femur\nand concentrated on holding unto your body. The after-battle banter started\nbetween Clint and Natasha, something about Budapest you couldn\u2019t quite grasp.\nThen it moved on to Thor and Loki spewing embarrassing stories about each\nother. Soon you were being teased by Bucky, and even in your hazy state, you\nthrew some remarks towards him, making him laugh in spite of his own injuries. However,\nNatasha seemed to pick up on your strained voice.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cY/N, are you injured?\u201d Natasha asked,\neyeing your leather jacket (which you had zipped closed some time along the\nfight to cover the bullet hole), not fully trusting your judgment when it came\nto injuries. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re pale. Nat, she\u2019s pale,\u201d Clint\ngrunted, tugging at Natasha\u2019s sleeve.</p><p> \u00a0 Loki removed your jacket in a ripple of\ngreen, and his eyes instantly fell on your ruined suit, \u201cLady Y/N\u2026\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 You couldn\u2019t hear the end of his sentence.\u00a0</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p>The annoying beeping of a\nmachine brought you around. Your groggy eyes struggled to focus on the various\ntubes and machinery. The smell\u2026 a hospital\u2026 you hated hospitals. Your father\nwas smothered to death in a hospital. </p><p> \u00a0 A tall man in white sauntered into the room,\n\u201cAh, you\u2019re awake! Excellent. My name\u2019s Dr. Strange, and I\u2019m here to inform you\nthat a ragtag group of people in tight clothing have been waiting to hear from\nyou for hours. They keep asking about you, and to be frank, they\u2019ve been\nscaring my nurses. So, I\u2019ll just let them in now.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 In a blur, the Avengers rushed into your\nroom and flocked your bed. Tony and Bruce were quick to interrogate the doctor.\nThe Asgardians professed their displeasure about the thin white blankets and\nproceeded to remove their capes to cover you with them. Natasha pushed the\nwheelchair in which Clint was sitting on to your bedside and began to fill you\nin on everything that you had missed, including the fact that Tony had\nconsidered adopting you in order to get your information from the nurses, \u201cHe\nstarted to rant in the waiting room. I swear, he even cursed on the name of\nwhoever it was that came up with the patient confidentiality law\u2026 I\u2019ll show you\nthe video later.\u201d \u00a0 </p><p> \u00a0 Then came Steve Rogers, and the room fell\nsilent. The doctor excused himself and closed the door after him to give you\nall some privacy. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to take that bullet, Y/N,\u201d\nSteve carefully sat beside you, smoothing your hair back, \u201cBut you did, and I\u2019m\nforever indebted to you. \u2018Thank you\u2019 will never suffice. You\u2019re mighty brave, kid.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 You looked around you, drinking in the bruised\nand scratched faces of your new family. Yes\u2026 family. Family never abandons, and\nthey refused to abandon you. And they sat on uncomfortable chairs. And they\nscared nurses\u2026 all for you. Tears spilled from your eyes, and you let them; you\nfelt safe and ready to step out from behind the cover of villainy. You didn\u2019t need\nit anymore, and they knew it. The kiss Natasha pressed to your forehead was enough\nproof.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cAccording to the Mr. Weird, you\u2019re ready to\ngo home, kid,\u201d Tony chirped, clearly uncomfortable with the warm atmosphere. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cHome?\u201d Your voice was a mere whisper, but to\nyou, it was the loudest word you had ever uttered. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cHome.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Author\u2019s Note:</b></p><p><b>Hey, lovelies!

That\u2019s why it had taken S.H.I.E.L.D. so long to trace the source.\nThe Russian and the Super Soldier stood in a corner of the showroom, pretending\nto be engrossed in analyzing a piece by some Impressionist artist or another. In\nan escaped second, the room was deafeningly silent, and the sound of retreating\nfootsteps brought the Soldier and the Russian around. The Spy hurried after\nthem with a determined step.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cI guess we\u2019ll be going then,\u201d Steve sighed\nand followed after his friend, ready for a fight. The two Avengers looked\naround the room, observing the guests. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cSteve, not all of them are wearing the\nblack bands around their wrists. See?\u201d Natasha whispered into his ear, pointing\nat the group of people standing in front of them. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cInteresting. Also, why would art\nenthusiasts would be standing in a room full of amazing sculptures but pay no\nattention to them and stare at the staircase instead?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cYeah\u2026 you\u2019re right. And with such\nanticipation too?\u201d The Spy furrowed her brow and moved her hand to the close of\nthe slit on her skirt, letting it rest over the gun strapped to her thigh.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cI guess we\u2019ll wait and see.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 The chamber musicians put a halt to their\nplaying, and the lights dimmed significantly, forcing their eyes to rely on the\nvague illumination that the bluish lights in the floor provided. The silence\nmade them anxious. The hammering heartbeats of the people around them seem to\necho against the walls. Much to their dismay, the sound of clicking heels\nagainst the marble floor accompanied each <i>thump\n</i>seamlessly. It was a rather morbid experience. </p><p> \u00a0 Steve was unsure if he should breath and\nrisk disturbing the waters. He was sure wicked creatures waited beneath its\nsurface. The steps began to sound louder and stopped. A woman of dubious nature\nstood at the top of the stairs, a glass of wine hung idly from her right hand.\nShe was clothed in ivory silk, adorned with black pearls, and cloaked in sin,\nand the sight of her made the Soldier gasp for air. The ever-stoic Spy beside\nhim had retrieved her hand from its position over her weapon, not wanting to\nlook away from the alluring creature before her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cWelcome, all,\u201d her voice rang clear in a\nsultry purr, \u201cTo the Gallery.\u201d Her piercing eyes scanned the room and her lips\ncurled in a tantalizing grin. Her victims clapped, endearingly oblivious of\nhaving become victims as soon as they had entered through the crystal-encrusted\ndoors. \u201cIt is an indescribable <i>pleasure </i>to\nsee you all here tonight. I sure hope you brought your monsters along.\u201d Some\nguests around them laughed as if her words had been a delightful joke; other\nguests admired the woman with glazed eyes. \u201cNow, I know that the night is\nshort, and you have all been awfully patient. To our VIP guests, thank you for\nyour un<i>dying </i>support. The Gallery\nwouldn\u2019t have happened without you. A round of applause for our VIP guests,\nplease,\u201d the woman clapped her hands in initiative and the rest of the crowd\nsoon joined her.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cLook at that woman over there. She looks\nridiculously smug,\u201d the Russian pointed out, breaking Steve from his trance.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cAnd she\u2019s wearing a black band.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cStay sharp, Rogers. That woman might just\nbe who we\u2019re looking for.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 <i>No,\nshe isn\u2019t! </i>His heart insisted, but his mind was quick to silence it after\nthe Spy\u2019s remark. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cWith no further do, enjoy the Exhibit.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 As if by command, works of art incarnate\nstepped off the walls and closed in around the crowd, sauntering and smirking\nas if all the nights in history were compressed into their cores. Natasha\npulled Steve back by the elbow, bumping against two tall men. Her hand returned\nto her thigh, a decision away from shooting. The two Avengers noticed that the\n\u201cexhibits\u201d clung to the VIP guests, caressing and whispering and taunting\nbefore whisking them away behind curtains. The band began to play a lively jazz\ntune, and the Spy pulled the Soldier to the middle of the floor, away from the\nbouncers. Steve quickly fell into step with Natasha, leaning his face against\nher hand as she stroked his cheek \u201clovingly\u201d. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cKiss me,\u201d she whispered for the watching\ncrowd, using the opportunity to speak into the mic hidden in the collar of his\nshirt, \u201cStark, stay alert. This is about to get ugly.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s alright. Point Break is about to\ncrash in through the windows right about\u2026now,\u201d Tony Stark replied into her\nearpiece, \u201cReindeer Games tried to stop him but hey, Asgardians.\u201d Steve\u2019s\nslight nod made her understand that he was told as well. The plan was set into\nmotion. The sound of crashing glass sent the crowd into a frenzy as a lightning\nbolt struck the marble floor. The bewilderment was fed when a blond man stood\nin the cracked stone and a dark-haired man emerged from seemingly nowhere. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cHonestly, Thor, this was exactly what we\nwere told to not do,\u201d the raven-haired god snapped, daggers at the ready. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cHush, brother, there are Brother Rogers and\nLady Romanoff! Has the fight begun?\u201d The Thunderer asked with a wave at his\nteammates.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cNow it has,\u201d Natasha replied, guns in both\nhands, \u201cWe have to find <i>her</i>. Loki,\ncome with me. Steve and Thor, you\u2019re both preoccupied already.\u201d She nodded at\nthe approaching bouncers. The Russian spoke into her mic, \u201cStark, scan the\nbuilding and find the victims.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d the Tycoon replied, and\nNatasha could swear she could hear <i>Rio </i>by\nDuran Duran playing faintly in the background, \u201cBuck-Buck is headed your way\nnow.\u201d </p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u201cSpotted him,\u201d the Spy signaled at the White\nWolf and the Trickster to follow her, and the trio made their way down the\nhalls in search of their villain.\u00a0</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p>\u00a0Your hands trembled,\nmaking you drop the bullets all across the tiled floor. You cursed and threw\nthe gun to the side; it was useless to you by now. Your personal mission had\nbeen accomplished that night; you had avenged your father. You were sure that\nwoman had paid her dues in the hands of your \u2018exhibits\u2019. The rest could go to\nhell. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cHands in the air where I can see them,\u201d you\nheard a female voice command. You decided to oblige with a smirk. Slowly, you\nturned around and lifted your hands to the air.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cOh, hello,\u201d you crooned, \u201cI saw you earlier\nat the gathering. I must say, you are quite beautiful. You look stunning in\nthat dress, Black Widow.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cEnough sweet talk, Renderer,\u201d the Widow\nturned to the deity beside her. You recognized him from the Stuttgart and New\nYork incidents. You also noticed the power-repressing cuffs in his hands, the\nones used on mutants. A familiar stinging sensation on your eyes urged you to\nstrengthen your act. You lowered your hands and outstretched them before you.\nYou didn\u2019t want to kill them\u2026 but give them a fight? Why not? You visualized\nher cardiovascular system, the intricate paths of veins and arteries and\ncapillaries. It was beautiful. You curled your fingers in, slowing the flow of\nher bloodstream. The fear in her eyes turned to determination, so you pulled in\na bit more. Once you were sure she wouldn\u2019t be able defend herself, you kicked\nthe Russian in the gut, making her groan in the heightened sense of pain that\nthe effects of your power provided. </p><p> \u00a0 You ran, leaving the Widow crumbled in the\nfloor; her previous state of health would take some time to return, time you\nwere planning to use at your advantage. Down the hall, you spotted the Winter\nSoldier and the God of Mischief himself running towards you. You were quick to\nslow the human\u2019s system, but the god? There was nothing, no life. The living\nscared you more than the unliving, so you ignored the illusion, elbowed the\nhuman in the back and continued your escape. You reached the staircase in which\nyou had welcomed your guests before and saw the rest of the Avengers. A satisfied\nsmile rose to your lips as you heard the sounds of slowing hearts fill the air.\nYou had won. </p><p> \u00a0 Or so you thought.</p><p> \u00a0 Iron Man landed in front of you, startling\nyou and breaking your concentration. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cThe man with no heart.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be at home asleep? Tonight\u2019s\na school night, and I don\u2019t know much about kids, but I know that they should\ngo to sleep at nine o\u2019clock every night,\u201d the Tycoon spoke from inside his\nsuit.</p><p> \u00a0 Your hands were suddenly pulled to the front\nof your body, and a pair of power-repressing handcuffs encircled your wrists.\nYou recognized the dark-haired man immediately, and you grinned sheepishly as\nyou noticed the two Avengers flanking him.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cOhhh\u2026God of Mischief, what a pleasure it is\nto meet you. I ran into one of your illusions earlier, almost fooled me,\u201d you\npurred, \u201cIf I promise to be good, would you show me some tricks?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cPerhaps,\u201d Loki replied with no evidence of\nmirth. You knew he could see right through you. The sight of the handcuffs\nbrought you painful memories, and he knew it. Immediately, you felt the numbing\nsensation of your powers sinking into the marrow of your bones. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cWinter Soldier,\u201d you cooed, amused by the\ntrio before you, \u201cMight I say that you\u2019re positively legendary?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cWhite Wolf.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cAh,\nreformed, aren\u2019t we? How sweet.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 The Russian glared at you to remain silent,\nobviously displeased with your manhandling her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re coming with us, Renderer,\u201d Natasha\ngrabbed you by the cuffs and led you out of your \u2018beloved\u2019 gallery. You wished\nit would burn.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p><b>One\nWeek Later</b></p><p> \u00a0 \u201cY/N?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 You looked up from your drawing to see Steve\nRogers standing at your doorway. He had a plate in his hands, and by what you\ncould smell, he carried pizza.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cI figured you might be hungry, so I brought\nyou some pizza,\u201d Steve stepped into your room cautiously, as if to not incite\nyou to pounce. You had no desire to harm him, and even if you did, the cuffs\nTony had fashioned for you wouldn\u2019t allow you to hurt him. These new cuffs had\nno link in between, which allowed you to move your hands freely, but they still\nrepressed your abilities. You remained silent as you watched him place the\nplate on the desk from your place on the bed. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cWell\u2026 if you need anything, don\u2019t hesitate\nto ask.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 You wanted to ask when they would set you\nfree. You wanted to ask if S.H.I.E.L.D. would be testing you. You hated\nneedles. You wanted to ask if S.H.I.E.L.D. would prod you with needles. But all\nyou could do was glare at the back of his head as he walked away. Your pride\nhardened your spine.</p><p><b>Three\nWeeks Later</b></p><p> \u00a0 \u201cYou need to learn to defend yourself. Don\u2019t\nget me wrong, those powers of yours are pretty damn impressive. However, your\nself-defense skills are pitiful,\u201d Tony stated bluntly, offering you some\nblueberries, \u201cNat\u2019s gonna teach you martial arts. Loki offered to teach you how\nto wield daggers. Buck\u2019s gonna teach you how to fire a gun\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cI pass.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cSorry, kid. I wasn\u2019t asking you if you were\nup to it.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cYou can\u2019t make me, Stark.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cThose cute bracelets tell me otherwise.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 The man was infuriating\u2026 you kinda liked\nhim.</p><p><b>Three\nWeeks Later </b></p><p> \u00a0 You were sitting on a stool, cradling your\nbandaged ankle. Despite your efforts of staying away, you had agreed to taking\nthe lessons. Nick Fury had even recommended the team took you out for a\nmission, as long as it was a simple one and your powers remained repressed for\nthe time being. Grace wasn\u2019t one of your most notable traits. While trying to\naim a kick too high for your extensions, you twisted your ankle. Of course, you\nrefused to admit this. You had found a unused bandage on your first-aid kit and\ntreated to your injured ankle yourself. </p><p> \u00a0 The team was gathered in the living room\ncelebrating their success. You wanted to join them so badly, but your pride\nforced you to remain in your seat. You could <i>sense</i> their laughter rushing through their veins. It was warm and\ninviting, almost made you laugh along. However, you ignored them and proceeded\nto nibble on a piece of Wonder bread. The smell of Chinese food was also\nawfully appetizing and made your snack seem ridiculous. The laughter felt a bit\nmore emphasized now. That meant somebody was approaching you. Effectively, you\nlooked to your left to meet the smiling eyes of Bruce Banner.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cHey, you did good out there today.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 You gave the gentle man a small, almost\nimperceptible, grin. You had a soft spot for the Doctor. He was docile and\ngenuine, and the Other Guy was also high on your list of favorite people.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cNo problem,\u201d Banner seemed to hesitate for\na moment, \u201cWon\u2019t you join us? There\u2019s enough food to go around, and to be\nhonest with you, we\u2019re all curious about you, Y/N.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cCurious? About me?\u201d <i>Well, that\u2019s definitely new.</i></p><p> \u00a0 Bruce nodded and offered you a smile,\nshowing you were indeed welcome. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cAlright.\u201d Carefully, you got off the stool\nand followed him into the living room. You surveyed the room. Everybody was so\ncasual and relaxed, like normal people. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cLady Y/N! You have decided to join us! Great!\nHave you tried that chicken lathered in the odd red sauce? It is my favorite.\u201d\nYou did your best to keep yourself from smiling. Thor was the very definition\nof sunshine. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cActually, I haven\u2019t tried it. I\u2019ll try it\nnow.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 Bucky gave you a small grin and scooted to\nthe side, giving you a spot on the carpet beside him. You looked around for any\nsigns of discomfort, but having found just acceptance and friendliness, you sat\nbeside the White Wolf and served yourself some sweet and sour chicken and some\nfried rice. Soon, you were swept by light friendly chatter, and you could feel\nyourself thawing for them, eager to let this odd family into your life. You wanted\nto be part of that family before you desperately. </p><p><b>One\nMonth Later</b></p><p> \u00a0 It all happened so fast. </p><p> \u00a0 You just knew you couldn\u2019t let Steve get\nshot. </p><p> \u00a0 No, not him.</p><p> \u00a0 You\npressed your hand to your ribs in astonishment. A bullet had entered your body.\nYou had felt it ricochet inside you. But the team needed your help, so you\nfocused all your energy on crushing airways and stopping hearts from pumping\nblood regardless of your own failing system. </p><p> \u00a0 The Avengers had won, as per usual, but Clint\nhad received the ugliest blow. You averted your gaze from his protruding femur\nand concentrated on holding unto your body. The after-battle banter started\nbetween Clint and Natasha, something about Budapest you couldn\u2019t quite grasp.\nThen it moved on to Thor and Loki spewing embarrassing stories about each\nother. Soon you were being teased by Bucky, and even in your hazy state, you\nthrew some remarks towards him, making him laugh in spite of his own injuries. However,\nNatasha seemed to pick up on your strained voice.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cY/N, are you injured?\u201d Natasha asked,\neyeing your leather jacket (which you had zipped closed some time along the\nfight to cover the bullet hole), not fully trusting your judgment when it came\nto injuries. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re pale. Nat, she\u2019s pale,\u201d Clint\ngrunted, tugging at Natasha\u2019s sleeve.</p><p> \u00a0 Loki removed your jacket in a ripple of\ngreen, and his eyes instantly fell on your ruined suit, \u201cLady Y/N\u2026\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 You couldn\u2019t hear the end of his sentence.\u00a0</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p>The annoying beeping of a\nmachine brought you around. Your groggy eyes struggled to focus on the various\ntubes and machinery. The smell\u2026 a hospital\u2026 you hated hospitals. Your father\nwas smothered to death in a hospital. </p><p> \u00a0 A tall man in white sauntered into the room,\n\u201cAh, you\u2019re awake! Excellent. My name\u2019s Dr. Strange, and I\u2019m here to inform you\nthat a ragtag group of people in tight clothing have been waiting to hear from\nyou for hours. They keep asking about you, and to be frank, they\u2019ve been\nscaring my nurses. So, I\u2019ll just let them in now.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 In a blur, the Avengers rushed into your\nroom and flocked your bed. Tony and Bruce were quick to interrogate the doctor.\nThe Asgardians professed their displeasure about the thin white blankets and\nproceeded to remove their capes to cover you with them. Natasha pushed the\nwheelchair in which Clint was sitting on to your bedside and began to fill you\nin on everything that you had missed, including the fact that Tony had\nconsidered adopting you in order to get your information from the nurses, \u201cHe\nstarted to rant in the waiting room. I swear, he even cursed on the name of\nwhoever it was that came up with the patient confidentiality law\u2026 I\u2019ll show you\nthe video later.\u201d \u00a0 </p><p> \u00a0 Then came Steve Rogers, and the room fell\nsilent. The doctor excused himself and closed the door after him to give you\nall some privacy. </p><p> \u00a0 \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to take that bullet, Y/N,\u201d\nSteve carefully sat beside you, smoothing your hair back, \u201cBut you did, and I\u2019m\nforever indebted to you. \u2018Thank you\u2019 will never suffice. You\u2019re mighty brave, kid.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 You looked around you, drinking in the bruised\nand scratched faces of your new family. Yes\u2026 family.

That&rsquo;s why it had taken S.H.I.E.L.D. so long to trace the source.\nThe Russian and the Super Soldier stood in a corner of the showroom, pretending\nto be engrossed in analyzing a piece by some Impressionist artist or another. In\nan escaped second, the room was deafeningly silent, and the sound of retreating\nfootsteps brought the Soldier and the Russian around. The Spy hurried after\nthem with a determined step.</p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll be going then,&rdquo; Steve sighed\nand followed after his friend, ready for a fight. The two Avengers looked\naround the room, observing the guests. </p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;Steve, not all of them are wearing the\nblack bands around their wrists. See?&rdquo; Natasha whispered into his ear, pointing\nat the group of people standing in front of them. </p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;Interesting. Also, why would art\nenthusiasts would be standing in a room full of amazing sculptures but pay no\nattention to them and stare at the staircase instead?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;Yeah&hellip; you&rsquo;re right. And with such\nanticipation too?&rdquo; The Spy furrowed her brow and moved her hand to the close of\nthe slit on her skirt, letting it rest over the gun strapped to her thigh.</p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll wait and see.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; The chamber musicians put a halt to their\nplaying, and the lights dimmed significantly, forcing their eyes to rely on the\nvague illumination that the bluish lights in the floor provided. The silence\nmade them anxious. The hammering heartbeats of the people around them seem to\necho against the walls. Much to their dismay, the sound of clicking heels\nagainst the marble floor accompanied each <i>thump\n</i>seamlessly. It was a rather morbid experience. </p><p> &nbsp; Steve was unsure if he should breath and\nrisk disturbing the waters. He was sure wicked creatures waited beneath its\nsurface. The steps began to sound louder and stopped. A woman of dubious nature\nstood at the top of the stairs, a glass of wine hung idly from her right hand.\nShe was clothed in ivory silk, adorned with black pearls, and cloaked in sin,\nand the sight of her made the Soldier gasp for air. The ever-stoic Spy beside\nhim had retrieved her hand from its position over her weapon, not wanting to\nlook away from the alluring creature before her. </p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;Welcome, all,&rdquo; her voice rang clear in a\nsultry purr, &ldquo;To the Gallery.&rdquo; Her piercing eyes scanned the room and her lips\ncurled in a tantalizing grin. Her victims clapped, endearingly oblivious of\nhaving become victims as soon as they had entered through the crystal-encrusted\ndoors. &ldquo;It is an indescribable <i>pleasure </i>to\nsee you all here tonight. I sure hope you brought your monsters along.&rdquo; Some\nguests around them laughed as if her words had been a delightful joke; other\nguests admired the woman with glazed eyes. &ldquo;Now, I know that the night is\nshort, and you have all been awfully patient. To our VIP guests, thank you for\nyour un<i>dying </i>support. The Gallery\nwouldn&rsquo;t have happened without you. A round of applause for our VIP guests,\nplease,&rdquo; the woman clapped her hands in initiative and the rest of the crowd\nsoon joined her.</p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;Look at that woman over there. She looks\nridiculously smug,&rdquo; the Russian pointed out, breaking Steve from his trance.</p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;And she&rsquo;s wearing a black band.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;Stay sharp, Rogers. That woman might just\nbe who we&rsquo;re looking for.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; <i>No,\nshe isn&rsquo;t! </i>His heart insisted, but his mind was quick to silence it after\nthe Spy&rsquo;s remark. </p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;With no further do, enjoy the Exhibit.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; As if by command, works of art incarnate\nstepped off the walls and closed in around the crowd, sauntering and smirking\nas if all the nights in history were compressed into their cores. Natasha\npulled Steve back by the elbow, bumping against two tall men. Her hand returned\nto her thigh, a decision away from shooting. The two Avengers noticed that the\n&ldquo;exhibits&rdquo; clung to the VIP guests, caressing and whispering and taunting\nbefore whisking them away behind curtains. The band began to play a lively jazz\ntune, and the Spy pulled the Soldier to the middle of the floor, away from the\nbouncers. Steve quickly fell into step with Natasha, leaning his face against\nher hand as she stroked his cheek &ldquo;lovingly&rdquo;. </p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;Kiss me,&rdquo; she whispered for the watching\ncrowd, using the opportunity to speak into the mic hidden in the collar of his\nshirt, &ldquo;Stark, stay alert. This is about to get ugly.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s alright. Point Break is about to\ncrash in through the windows right about&hellip;now,&rdquo; Tony Stark replied into her\nearpiece, &ldquo;Reindeer Games tried to stop him but hey, Asgardians.&rdquo; Steve&rsquo;s\nslight nod made her understand that he was told as well. The plan was set into\nmotion. The sound of crashing glass sent the crowd into a frenzy as a lightning\nbolt struck the marble floor. The bewilderment was fed when a blond man stood\nin the cracked stone and a dark-haired man emerged from seemingly nowhere. </p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;Honestly, Thor, this was exactly what we\nwere told to not do,&rdquo; the raven-haired god snapped, daggers at the ready. </p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;Hush, brother, there are Brother Rogers and\nLady Romanoff! Has the fight begun?&rdquo; The Thunderer asked with a wave at his\nteammates.</p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;Now it has,&rdquo; Natasha replied, guns in both\nhands, &ldquo;We have to find <i>her</i>. Loki,\ncome with me. Steve and Thor, you&rsquo;re both preoccupied already.&rdquo; She nodded at\nthe approaching bouncers. The Russian spoke into her mic, &ldquo;Stark, scan the\nbuilding and find the victims.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; the Tycoon replied, and\nNatasha could swear she could hear <i>Rio </i>by\nDuran Duran playing faintly in the background, &ldquo;Buck-Buck is headed your way\nnow.&rdquo; </p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &ldquo;Spotted him,&rdquo; the Spy signaled at the White\nWolf and the Trickster to follow her, and the trio made their way down the\nhalls in search of their villain.&nbsp;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>&nbsp;Your hands trembled,\nmaking you drop the bullets all across the tiled floor. You cursed and threw\nthe gun to the side; it was useless to you by now. Your personal mission had\nbeen accomplished that night; you had avenged your father. You were sure that\nwoman had paid her dues in the hands of your &lsquo;exhibits&rsquo;. The rest could go to\nhell. </p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;Hands in the air where I can see them,&rdquo; you\nheard a female voice command. You decided to oblige with a smirk. Slowly, you\nturned around and lifted your hands to the air.</p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, hello,&rdquo; you crooned, &ldquo;I saw you earlier\nat the gathering. I must say, you are quite beautiful. You look stunning in\nthat dress, Black Widow.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;Enough sweet talk, Renderer,&rdquo; the Widow\nturned to the deity beside her. You recognized him from the Stuttgart and New\nYork incidents. You also noticed the power-repressing cuffs in his hands, the\nones used on mutants. A familiar stinging sensation on your eyes urged you to\nstrengthen your act. You lowered your hands and outstretched them before you.\nYou didn&rsquo;t want to kill them&hellip; but give them a fight? Why not? You visualized\nher cardiovascular system, the intricate paths of veins and arteries and\ncapillaries. It was beautiful. You curled your fingers in, slowing the flow of\nher bloodstream. The fear in her eyes turned to determination, so you pulled in\na bit more. Once you were sure she wouldn&rsquo;t be able defend herself, you kicked\nthe Russian in the gut, making her groan in the heightened sense of pain that\nthe effects of your power provided. </p><p> &nbsp; You ran, leaving the Widow crumbled in the\nfloor; her previous state of health would take some time to return, time you\nwere planning to use at your advantage. Down the hall, you spotted the Winter\nSoldier and the God of Mischief himself running towards you. You were quick to\nslow the human&rsquo;s system, but the god? There was nothing, no life. The living\nscared you more than the unliving, so you ignored the illusion, elbowed the\nhuman in the back and continued your escape. You reached the staircase in which\nyou had welcomed your guests before and saw the rest of the Avengers. A satisfied\nsmile rose to your lips as you heard the sounds of slowing hearts fill the air.\nYou had won. </p><p> &nbsp; Or so you thought.</p><p> &nbsp; Iron Man landed in front of you, startling\nyou and breaking your concentration. </p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;The man with no heart.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you be at home asleep? Tonight&rsquo;s\na school night, and I don&rsquo;t know much about kids, but I know that they should\ngo to sleep at nine o&rsquo;clock every night,&rdquo; the Tycoon spoke from inside his\nsuit.</p><p> &nbsp; Your hands were suddenly pulled to the front\nof your body, and a pair of power-repressing handcuffs encircled your wrists.\nYou recognized the dark-haired man immediately, and you grinned sheepishly as\nyou noticed the two Avengers flanking him.</p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;Ohhh&hellip;God of Mischief, what a pleasure it is\nto meet you. I ran into one of your illusions earlier, almost fooled me,&rdquo; you\npurred, &ldquo;If I promise to be good, would you show me some tricks?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Loki replied with no evidence of\nmirth. You knew he could see right through you. The sight of the handcuffs\nbrought you painful memories, and he knew it. Immediately, you felt the numbing\nsensation of your powers sinking into the marrow of your bones. </p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;Winter Soldier,&rdquo; you cooed, amused by the\ntrio before you, &ldquo;Might I say that you&rsquo;re positively legendary?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;White Wolf.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,\nreformed, aren&rsquo;t we? How sweet.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; The Russian glared at you to remain silent,\nobviously displeased with your manhandling her. </p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re coming with us, Renderer,&rdquo; Natasha\ngrabbed you by the cuffs and led you out of your &lsquo;beloved&rsquo; gallery. You wished\nit would burn.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p><b>One\nWeek Later</b></p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; You looked up from your drawing to see Steve\nRogers standing at your doorway. He had a plate in his hands, and by what you\ncould smell, he carried pizza.</p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;I figured you might be hungry, so I brought\nyou some pizza,&rdquo; Steve stepped into your room cautiously, as if to not incite\nyou to pounce. You had no desire to harm him, and even if you did, the cuffs\nTony had fashioned for you wouldn&rsquo;t allow you to hurt him. These new cuffs had\nno link in between, which allowed you to move your hands freely, but they still\nrepressed your abilities. You remained silent as you watched him place the\nplate on the desk from your place on the bed. </p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;Well&hellip; if you need anything, don&rsquo;t hesitate\nto ask.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; You wanted to ask when they would set you\nfree. You wanted to ask if S.H.I.E.L.D. would be testing you. You hated\nneedles. You wanted to ask if S.H.I.E.L.D. would prod you with needles. But all\nyou could do was glare at the back of his head as he walked away. Your pride\nhardened your spine.</p><p><b>Three\nWeeks Later</b></p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;You need to learn to defend yourself. Don&rsquo;t\nget me wrong, those powers of yours are pretty damn impressive. However, your\nself-defense skills are pitiful,&rdquo; Tony stated bluntly, offering you some\nblueberries, &ldquo;Nat&rsquo;s gonna teach you martial arts. Loki offered to teach you how\nto wield daggers. Buck&rsquo;s gonna teach you how to fire a gun&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;I pass.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;Sorry, kid. I wasn&rsquo;t asking you if you were\nup to it.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t make me, Stark.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;Those cute bracelets tell me otherwise.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; The man was infuriating&hellip; you kinda liked\nhim.</p><p><b>Three\nWeeks Later </b></p><p> &nbsp; You were sitting on a stool, cradling your\nbandaged ankle. Despite your efforts of staying away, you had agreed to taking\nthe lessons. Nick Fury had even recommended the team took you out for a\nmission, as long as it was a simple one and your powers remained repressed for\nthe time being. Grace wasn&rsquo;t one of your most notable traits. While trying to\naim a kick too high for your extensions, you twisted your ankle. Of course, you\nrefused to admit this. You had found a unused bandage on your first-aid kit and\ntreated to your injured ankle yourself. </p><p> &nbsp; The team was gathered in the living room\ncelebrating their success. You wanted to join them so badly, but your pride\nforced you to remain in your seat. You could <i>sense</i> their laughter rushing through their veins. It was warm and\ninviting, almost made you laugh along. However, you ignored them and proceeded\nto nibble on a piece of Wonder bread. The smell of Chinese food was also\nawfully appetizing and made your snack seem ridiculous. The laughter felt a bit\nmore emphasized now. That meant somebody was approaching you. Effectively, you\nlooked to your left to meet the smiling eyes of Bruce Banner.</p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;Hey, you did good out there today.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; You gave the gentle man a small, almost\nimperceptible, grin. You had a soft spot for the Doctor. He was docile and\ngenuine, and the Other Guy was also high on your list of favorite people.</p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;No problem,&rdquo; Banner seemed to hesitate for\na moment, &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you join us? There&rsquo;s enough food to go around, and to be\nhonest with you, we&rsquo;re all curious about you, Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;Curious? About me?&rdquo; <i>Well, that&rsquo;s definitely new.</i></p><p> &nbsp; Bruce nodded and offered you a smile,\nshowing you were indeed welcome. </p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; Carefully, you got off the stool\nand followed him into the living room. You surveyed the room. Everybody was so\ncasual and relaxed, like normal people. </p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;Lady Y/N! You have decided to join us! Great!\nHave you tried that chicken lathered in the odd red sauce? It is my favorite.&rdquo;\nYou did your best to keep yourself from smiling. Thor was the very definition\nof sunshine. </p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;Actually, I haven&rsquo;t tried it. I&rsquo;ll try it\nnow.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; Bucky gave you a small grin and scooted to\nthe side, giving you a spot on the carpet beside him. You looked around for any\nsigns of discomfort, but having found just acceptance and friendliness, you sat\nbeside the White Wolf and served yourself some sweet and sour chicken and some\nfried rice. Soon, you were swept by light friendly chatter, and you could feel\nyourself thawing for them, eager to let this odd family into your life. You wanted\nto be part of that family before you desperately. </p><p><b>One\nMonth Later</b></p><p> &nbsp; It all happened so fast. </p><p> &nbsp; You just knew you couldn&rsquo;t let Steve get\nshot. </p><p> &nbsp; No, not him.</p><p> &nbsp; You\npressed your hand to your ribs in astonishment. A bullet had entered your body.\nYou had felt it ricochet inside you. But the team needed your help, so you\nfocused all your energy on crushing airways and stopping hearts from pumping\nblood regardless of your own failing system. </p><p> &nbsp; The Avengers had won, as per usual, but Clint\nhad received the ugliest blow. You averted your gaze from his protruding femur\nand concentrated on holding unto your body. The after-battle banter started\nbetween Clint and Natasha, something about Budapest you couldn&rsquo;t quite grasp.\nThen it moved on to Thor and Loki spewing embarrassing stories about each\nother. Soon you were being teased by Bucky, and even in your hazy state, you\nthrew some remarks towards him, making him laugh in spite of his own injuries. However,\nNatasha seemed to pick up on your strained voice.</p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;Y/N, are you injured?&rdquo; Natasha asked,\neyeing your leather jacket (which you had zipped closed some time along the\nfight to cover the bullet hole), not fully trusting your judgment when it came\nto injuries. </p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be fine. Don&rsquo;t worry about me.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re pale. Nat, she&rsquo;s pale,&rdquo; Clint\ngrunted, tugging at Natasha&rsquo;s sleeve.</p><p> &nbsp; Loki removed your jacket in a ripple of\ngreen, and his eyes instantly fell on your ruined suit, &ldquo;Lady Y/N&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; You couldn&rsquo;t hear the end of his sentence.&nbsp;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>The annoying beeping of a\nmachine brought you around. Your groggy eyes struggled to focus on the various\ntubes and machinery. The smell&hellip; a hospital&hellip; you hated hospitals. Your father\nwas smothered to death in a hospital. </p><p> &nbsp; A tall man in white sauntered into the room,\n&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;re awake! Excellent. My name&rsquo;s Dr. Strange, and I&rsquo;m here to inform you\nthat a ragtag group of people in tight clothing have been waiting to hear from\nyou for hours. They keep asking about you, and to be frank, they&rsquo;ve been\nscaring my nurses. So, I&rsquo;ll just let them in now.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; In a blur, the Avengers rushed into your\nroom and flocked your bed. Tony and Bruce were quick to interrogate the doctor.\nThe Asgardians professed their displeasure about the thin white blankets and\nproceeded to remove their capes to cover you with them. Natasha pushed the\nwheelchair in which Clint was sitting on to your bedside and began to fill you\nin on everything that you had missed, including the fact that Tony had\nconsidered adopting you in order to get your information from the nurses, &ldquo;He\nstarted to rant in the waiting room. I swear, he even cursed on the name of\nwhoever it was that came up with the patient confidentiality law&hellip; I&rsquo;ll show you\nthe video later.&rdquo; &nbsp; </p><p> &nbsp; Then came Steve Rogers, and the room fell\nsilent. The doctor excused himself and closed the door after him to give you\nall some privacy. </p><p> &nbsp; &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t have to take that bullet, Y/N,&rdquo;\nSteve carefully sat beside you, smoothing your hair back, &ldquo;But you did, and I&rsquo;m\nforever indebted to you. &lsquo;Thank you&rsquo; will never suffice. You&rsquo;re mighty brave, kid.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; You looked around you, drinking in the bruised\nand scratched faces of your new family. Yes&hellip; family. Family never abandons, and\nthey refused to abandon you. And they sat on uncomfortable chairs. And they\nscared nurses&hellip; all for you. Tears spilled from your eyes, and you let them; you\nfelt safe and ready to step out from behind the cover of villainy. You didn&rsquo;t need\nit anymore, and they knew it.
