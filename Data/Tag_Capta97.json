She had changed her\nsuit\u2019s colours from teal, black and grey to red, blue and gold and it suited\nher rather well, if you dared to say so.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d\nshe looked down at herself, \u201cI had a little help from Monica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\nI wouldn\u2019t have trusted anyone else\u2019s advice either,\u201d you nodded, \u201cWhere is she\nby the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer\ngrandparents picked her up, she\u2019ll be safe with them.\u201d</p><p>You smiled\nat Carol and reached for hand to give it a reassuring squeeze, she felt guilty\nfor bringing Maria and Monica this close to danger in the first place, you\ncould see it in her eyes. She looked back at you smiling too and when you\nwanted to let go of her hand, she didn\u2019t let you, instead Carol only tightened\nher grip around it. </p><p>Suddenly a\nbit shy, she evaded your gaze as you continued to walk, but you didn\u2019t mind,\nnot at all. The walk over the lawn was shorter than you wished it to be, soon\nyou arrived at the little hangar, where you couldn\u2019t help, but stare amazed at\nthe quadjet. It had looked fancy even before the skrull had worked on it, but\nnow it really nearly looked like a spaceship.</p><p>It was only\nwhen Maria cleared her throat and gave a pointed look at your and Carol\u2019s\nintertwined hands, that you two jumped apart. While you both tried to cover\nyour embarrassment Maria only laughed. Luckily, Fury was inside the jet with\nTalos, you were sure he wouldn\u2019t have stopped teasing you the entire flight, if\nhe had seen you.</p><p>\u201cThere you\nare!\u201d Fury appeared again, the skrulls close on his heel. \u201cReady to go to\nspace?\u201d</p><p>You and\nMaria exchanged a glance, hell yeah, you were ready\u2026 <i>Space</i> for christ\u2019s sake\u2026</p><p>\u201cIt still\nworks pretty much the same way as before,\u201d Talos\u2019 science guy told Carol, \u201cJust\na few changes here and there\u2026 You should be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank\nyou,\u201d Carol replied.</p><p>The skrull\nnodded shortly and you started to frown.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t\ncoming with us?\u201d</p><p>He shook\nhis head and smiled sadly at you.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll stay\nbehind,\u201d Carol finally explained, \u201cYon-Rogg will track my signal back to this\nplace and we need all the extra time we can get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d\nyou protested.</p><p>\u201cIt was my\nidea,\u201d the skrull interrupted you and smiled, \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Before you\nor anyone else could protest further, he symmed Carol and, to be honest, that\ndid shut you up for a while\u2026 You were torn somewhere in between being amazed and\nweirded out.</p><p>The skrull\nseemed amused by your reactions judging by the very Carol-like smirk on his\nlips. Fury only shook his head and picked Goose up who was walking around his\nlegs.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\nlet\u2019s get going,\u201d he said.</p><p>While you\nboarded the jet, Talos stayed back, probably to say his farewells properly and\nyou all gave him the time gladly. Maria and Carol walked into the cockpit, both\nfeeling immediately at home. Behind their two seats were three more and it only\ntook you and Fury to exchange one glance to agree that you\u2019d take Talos in\nbetween the two of you, so while you took the seat behind Maria, he took the\none behind Carol, leaving the one in the middle for your new ally.</p><p>Talos only\nrolled his eyes when he entered. \u201cTake that creature away at least\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a\nchance,\u201d Fury replied cooing at Goose, causing you to laugh. He narrowed his\neyes at you. \u201cOne word to any other agent\u2026\u201d he threatened.</p><p>Smirking\nyou raised your arms in surrender. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, your secret\u2019s safe with me. No\none at SHIELD will ever know \u2018Don\u2019t-you-dare-call-me-Nick\u2019 Fury has a soft spot\nfor kitties.\u201d</p><p>Carol\nlaughed in the pilot\u2019s seat as she flicked a couple of switches. \u201cBuckle up,\nfolks.\u201d</p><p>You did as\nshe asked and grinned at her. \u201cReady, Danvers?\u201d</p><p>She looked\nover her shoulder and grinned back at you. \u201cHigher, further, faster, baby.\u201d</p><p>Maria\nlaughed beside her. \u201cSomething\u2019s telling me this time you\u2019re certainly going to\nkeep that promise.\u201d</p><p>Carol\nfeigned hurt. \u201cWhat do you mean, <i>this\ntime</i>?\u201d</p><p>Your\nattention was taken from the two women, when Talos leaned into your side. You\nshoved him back, but he still scooted closer to you and you realized he was\njust trying to get every possible inch of space between him and Goose. When\nFury realized that too, he laughed and cuddled the cat even more.</p><p>\u201cYou really\nshouldn\u2019t have that thing on your lap,\u201d Talos tried to tell him, but your boss\nonly smirked.</p><p>\u201cAs long as\nour alliance stands on shaky ground and you are frightened of her,\u201d he proved\nhis point by holding Goose into Talos\u2019 direction, who instantly flinched back,\n\u201cThe cat stays.\u201d</p><p>Talos\u2019\nfrightened expression made way for a confused look. \u201cWhat\u2019s a cat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I ask\nyou a question?\u201d Maria suddenly asked, stopping the two from bickering.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d\nTalos shrugged.</p><p>\u201cCan all of\nyou change your appearance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhysiologically?\nYes.\u201d He answered. \u201cBut it requires practice and, dare I say, talent to-\u201c</p><p>\u201cSo, you\ncould change into anything?\u201d Maria interrupted.</p><p>\u201cIf I see\nit first\u2026\u201d</p><p>While Fury\nand Maria started to suggest the weirdest things for him to turn into, you\nzoned out, preferring the sight out of the front shield to their conversation.\nFinally, you were called back by Carol\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cAlright, guys,\u201d\nshe shot you a quick glance, \u201cHold on\u2026\u201d</p><p>The jet\nrattled and shook when you started to brake through the atmosphere, so much so,\nthat you started to question the stability of the ship, especially considering\nthe recent provisional adjustments\u2026 Luckily the \u2018space turbulances\u2019 (as Fury\ncalled it) were over nearly as soon as they started and you suddenly found\nyourself in complete absence of gravity.</p><p>The feeling\nof weightlessness was difficult to describe, but it was something you definitely\nwouldn\u2019t forget all too quickly. You looked in wonder at your own arms, that\nhad risen without you having any influence on it. It was then, that the\nrealization, that you really were in space, settled in and you couldn\u2019t help\nbut laugh a little.</p><p>Carol soon\npressed a few buttons that activated some sort of gravity stabilizer, it felt\nlike something tugged at your stomach and for a second you feared you might\ngrow sick. The feeling passed quickly though and you finally were able to focus\non the absolutely marvelous sight on front of you. There were so many stars,\nstretching out until forever \u2013 but not a sign of Mar-Vell\u2019s laboratory.</p><p>\u201cHere it\nis,\u201d Carol said, \u201cWe\u2019re right were it\u2019s supposed to be\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe\nquestion is,\u201d Fury objected, \u201cIs it in front or behind of all that nothing?\u201d</p><p>Carol\ndidn\u2019t pay him any mind, instead she smiled and lifted her hand, she typed away\non the little display on her forearm whereupon a huge spacecraft appeared in\nfront of you. You\u2019d be astounded, but the truth was, that wasn\u2019t by far the\ncraziest thing you had witnessed in the last 24 hours.</p><p>Carol and\nMaria piloted the jet into the landing dock of the lab, touching down gently\nand with no complications.</p><p>\u201cThat was\namazing,\u201d you whispered causing Talos to smile at you and give you a little pat\non your shoulder, before exiting the jet quickly.</p><p>At first\nyou blamed that on his want to get away from Goose, but you started to doubt\nthat theory when it seemed that he couldn\u2019t make his way through the lab fast\nenough. Carol kept up with his pace, while the rest of you decided to be a bit\nmore careful when it came to exploring.</p><p>The inside\nof the lab reminded you more of a factory than of a spaceship, the faint buzz\nof the engine was omnipresent, but except for that and the echo of your footsteps\nit was completely silent.</p><p>You had\nwalked through a couple of corridors, taking so many turns that you feared you\nmight not find your way back to the hangar if you had to, when you finally\nreached a larger room, full of tech and other stuff, you wouldn\u2019t have expected\nto find there\u2026 You really should have been gawking at the glowing blue cube in the\ncenter of the room, but while the others were already busy with that, you\ncouldn\u2019t help but wonder about the pin-ball machine at the other end of the\nroom.</p><p>As you made\nyour way over there you noticed toys lying in between scientific notes and\nunderneath the tables. You turned around frowning and saw Fury rummaging through\nall the stuff too. You both spotted the steaming cup on the table at the same\ntime and looked at each other alerted.</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t\nalone\u2026\u201d he said and in that same moment Talos started to make sounds that\nreminded you oddly of whale song.</p><p>Before you\nknew it, skrulls emerged from every corner of the ship, surrounding you. Talos\nlooked around searching for something \u2013 some<i>one</i>\nand he didn\u2019t have to do so for long\u2026 A woman appeared to your right and as if\nhe sensed her Talos turned around. They took a tentative step closer to each\nother, before they ran into each other\u2019s arms.</p><p>You smiled\nsoftly when they hugged each other as close as possible and a child walked out\nof the shadows, encouraged by her mother.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t\nlooking for the Tesseract,\u201d Maria whispered beside you.</p><p>Talos and\nhis family turned around to you and his wife and child stepped back afraid when\nthey spotted Carol.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all\nright,\u201d Talos immediately comforted them, \u201cShe\u2019s helped me find you.\u201d</p><p>You turned\nto look at Carol, tears brimmed in her eyes as she took a few steps forward.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so\nsorry,\u201d her voice quivered, \u201cI didn\u2019t know-\u201c</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re at\nwar,\u201d Talos put a hand on her shoulder and looked at her softly, \u201cI\u2019ve got blood\non my hands too\u2026 But we are here now, and I wouldn\u2019t have managed that without\nyour help.\u201d</p><p>Carol nodded\nand before she could reply something another child approached her and soon got\nher to smile again when he showed her his high-score on the pinball game.</p><p>Fury\ngrumbled something beside you, but you were too enamored by Carol\u2019s smile as\nshe looked at the young skrull, to understand what he said. What did catch your\nattention, however, was the troop of Kree soldiers who suddenly entered through\nthe door you five had come through earlier.</p><p>All of you\ntook an instinctive step back, the man who led them was holding Goose by her\nneck and tossed her on the ground, where she landed on her legs. She\nimmediately made her way over to Fury. You glared at the kree, if you had to\nguess you\u2019d say that was Yon-Rogg.</p><p>Carol took\na step forward and the kree stopped a few feet in front of her.</p><p>\u201cWhat have\nyou done with your suit?\u201d Yon-Rogg twisted his face in disgust.</p><p>\u201cThey got\ninto her head,\u201d a blue woman spat, \u201cJust like we feared.\u201d</p><p>Carol\nclenched her fist at her side. \u201cYou <i>lied</i>\nto me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI helped\nyou to become the best version of yourself,\u201d her former commander retorted, his\neyes wandered to where Carol\u2019s fist started to glow and he smirked. The light\nflickered and with a cry of pain she fell to her knees clutching her neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\ngiven can be taken away,\u201d Yon-Rogg said and took a step closer.</p><p>Carol tried\nto get back up, she wouldn\u2019t let him beat her just because he had taken her powers\naway, but the kree activated a device that created some sort of energy field that\nhelped him keep Carol in place.</p><p>Without giving\nit a second thought, you stepped forward, but before you knew it Yon-Rogg\nleashed out with his free arm and sent you flying into a wall.</p><p>You gasped\nin pain as you fell to the ground and you faintly heard someone shout your\nname. Groaning you tried to sit up and just as your vision cleared again you\nsaw Carol collapse. You scrambled to your feet, ignoring the flashes of pain\nthat ragged through you, but before you could do anything remotely useful one\nof the kree held a sword to your throat. You immediately stopped moving and\nglared at the man, but he only regarded you with something that could only be\ndescribed as mild annoyance and so you could only watch helplessly as Yon-Rogg\nleft with a few of his team members taking Carol with him.</p><p>You were\nbrought over to Maria and Fury who regarded you with concerned glances, but you\nsmiled letting them know it shouldn\u2019t be you they were worried about. A couple\nof kree were guarding the skrull at the other end of the room while you were\nleft with two others. One of them took Goose out of Fury\u2019s arms while the blue\none scanned her with a device, he had picked from his belt.</p><p>\u201cSpecies:\nFlerken; threat: high,\u201d it proclaimed.</p><p>You three\nfrowned as the kree muzzled the poor thing.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a\ncat, not Hannibal Lecter,\u201d Fury complained, but the kree ignored him and\nscanned him next.</p><p>\u201cSpecies:\nhuman; threat: low to none.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat thing\nis definitely broken,\u201d your boss declared.</p><p>\u201cAww, does\nthat hurt your ego?\u201d you teased and despite the situation Maria laughed beside\nyou as Fury narrowed his eyes at you.</p><p>Whatever he\nwanted to reply was drowned out by the device that had been pointed at you. \u201cSpecies:\nhuman \u2013 mutant; threat: can vary from low to high.\u201d</p><p>You raised\nyour eyebrows and looked up at the kree who was regarding you suspiciously. \u201cMate,\nI think your precious little thing there needs to be checked over.\u201d</p><p>You felt\nFury and Maria watching you closely, but you shrugged, what even was a mutant\nsupposed to be? The kree didn\u2019t give you any time to think about it any longer\nhowever, the one with the device grabbed you by your shirt and pulled you to\nyour feet before shoving you in the direction of the skrull.</p><p>\u201cLock them\nand the skrulls up,\u201d he told his comrade, \u201cAnd blast the others into space.\u201d</p><p>You tried\nto break out of your captor\u2019s grip as you heard what they planned to do with\nyour friends, but he pushed you to your knees leaving you to watch desperately as\nthey led Maria, Fury and Goose away.</p><p>Maria cast\na glance back at you and her eyes widened. \u201cY/N! Watch out-\u201c</p><p>But it was\ntoo late, you felt a sharp pain at the back of your head and then everything\nturned black.</p><p>.</p><p><b>Tags: </b></p><p>Permanent: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mndJHIKwtItZS9uo6y2Qalg\">@pamplemousse-m</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXeese0H3qAL8DvIHbxZ1bw\">@marvelouspottering</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJpId-roCBDnwYkTTpTbAAQ\">@aspiring-bookcollector</a> @angelklementieffs <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mi5f7xBznyrSF0TFUakTExA\">@nerdofthehighestcalibre</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m90pduaFVS5YdsPr8zOdazg\">@mummy-woves-you</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR_UCwARCul9gSnnNyDqpOQ\">@platonic-plots</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mH1VmxgP16D6lxvSlpEDAng\">@startrekkingaroundasgard</a>  @yanginginthere <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/me7DB2mG8DhehlAYFZHVFXQ\">@bennyboibaby</a>  <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4vG1qHGDt59zsRnZsORUSg\">@hakuna&ndash;fuckin&ndash;matata</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRxOV1HZZiJw1Ecc5XMEUFQ\">@sincereleygmg</a></p><p>Carol\nDanvers: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwb49_QWIvAX1cSdbW1nraw\">@wherethesinslie</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mT91T2IJLMmrHMhtbTBvwpg\">@th3nextsupreme</a></p><p>Life Changing: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYq5akgdIUIObJSN4G3XBkQ\">@spiderboy-needs-a-break</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpgmBNnMpd2CX9rqA-Tfy8w\">@marvelrose</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mo97ZKeRJuKNUtkDdWBy8vQ\">@ddaeng-danvers</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLS8a629EYsaC9greHS2aaA\">@soullesstrashcan</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqd062k7eL1sQGmxFkhj_8w\">@morgannope</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhrBeOHlKcb_PWbi3O-tMEA\">@chonisbestmistake</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnPEk6DSEYD95ycde4QWTpw\">@prettylittlealiengirl</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ8rrOWJnd1_R39xtY7CHFg\">@musicals-n-chill</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrJDs3M7YVna-kc7lymUZog\">@cuddlememerrick</a></p>",

She had changed her\nsuit\u2019s colours from teal, black and grey to red, blue and gold and it suited\nher rather well, if you dared to say so.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d\nshe looked down at herself, \u201cI had a little help from Monica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\nI wouldn\u2019t have trusted anyone else\u2019s advice either,\u201d you nodded, \u201cWhere is she\nby the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer\ngrandparents picked her up, she\u2019ll be safe with them.\u201d</p><p>You smiled\nat Carol and reached for hand to give it a reassuring squeeze, she felt guilty\nfor bringing Maria and Monica this close to danger in the first place, you\ncould see it in her eyes. She looked back at you smiling too and when you\nwanted to let go of her hand, she didn\u2019t let you, instead Carol only tightened\nher grip around it. </p><p>Suddenly a\nbit shy, she evaded your gaze as you continued to walk, but you didn\u2019t mind,\nnot at all. The walk over the lawn was shorter than you wished it to be, soon\nyou arrived at the little hangar, where you couldn\u2019t help, but stare amazed at\nthe quadjet. It had looked fancy even before the skrull had worked on it, but\nnow it really nearly looked like a spaceship.</p><p>It was only\nwhen Maria cleared her throat and gave a pointed look at your and Carol\u2019s\nintertwined hands, that you two jumped apart. While you both tried to cover\nyour embarrassment Maria only laughed. Luckily, Fury was inside the jet with\nTalos, you were sure he wouldn\u2019t have stopped teasing you the entire flight, if\nhe had seen you.</p><p>\u201cThere you\nare!\u201d Fury appeared again, the skrulls close on his heel. \u201cReady to go to\nspace?\u201d</p><p>You and\nMaria exchanged a glance, hell yeah, you were ready\u2026 <i>Space</i> for christ\u2019s sake\u2026</p><p>\u201cIt still\nworks pretty much the same way as before,\u201d Talos\u2019 science guy told Carol, \u201cJust\na few changes here and there\u2026 You should be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank\nyou,\u201d Carol replied.</p><p>The skrull\nnodded shortly and you started to frown.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t\ncoming with us?\u201d</p><p>He shook\nhis head and smiled sadly at you.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll stay\nbehind,\u201d Carol finally explained, \u201cYon-Rogg will track my signal back to this\nplace and we need all the extra time we can get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d\nyou protested.</p><p>\u201cIt was my\nidea,\u201d the skrull interrupted you and smiled, \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Before you\nor anyone else could protest further, he symmed Carol and, to be honest, that\ndid shut you up for a while\u2026 You were torn somewhere in between being amazed and\nweirded out.</p><p>The skrull\nseemed amused by your reactions judging by the very Carol-like smirk on his\nlips. Fury only shook his head and picked Goose up who was walking around his\nlegs.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\nlet\u2019s get going,\u201d he said.</p><p>While you\nboarded the jet, Talos stayed back, probably to say his farewells properly and\nyou all gave him the time gladly. Maria and Carol walked into the cockpit, both\nfeeling immediately at home. Behind their two seats were three more and it only\ntook you and Fury to exchange one glance to agree that you\u2019d take Talos in\nbetween the two of you, so while you took the seat behind Maria, he took the\none behind Carol, leaving the one in the middle for your new ally.</p><p>Talos only\nrolled his eyes when he entered. \u201cTake that creature away at least\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a\nchance,\u201d Fury replied cooing at Goose, causing you to laugh. He narrowed his\neyes at you. \u201cOne word to any other agent\u2026\u201d he threatened.</p><p>Smirking\nyou raised your arms in surrender. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, your secret\u2019s safe with me. No\none at SHIELD will ever know \u2018Don\u2019t-you-dare-call-me-Nick\u2019 Fury has a soft spot\nfor kitties.\u201d</p><p>Carol\nlaughed in the pilot\u2019s seat as she flicked a couple of switches. \u201cBuckle up,\nfolks.\u201d</p><p>You did as\nshe asked and grinned at her. \u201cReady, Danvers?\u201d</p><p>She looked\nover her shoulder and grinned back at you. \u201cHigher, further, faster, baby.\u201d</p><p>Maria\nlaughed beside her. \u201cSomething\u2019s telling me this time you\u2019re certainly going to\nkeep that promise.\u201d</p><p>Carol\nfeigned hurt. \u201cWhat do you mean, <i>this\ntime</i>?\u201d</p><p>Your\nattention was taken from the two women, when Talos leaned into your side. You\nshoved him back, but he still scooted closer to you and you realized he was\njust trying to get every possible inch of space between him and Goose. When\nFury realized that too, he laughed and cuddled the cat even more.</p><p>\u201cYou really\nshouldn\u2019t have that thing on your lap,\u201d Talos tried to tell him, but your boss\nonly smirked.</p><p>\u201cAs long as\nour alliance stands on shaky ground and you are frightened of her,\u201d he proved\nhis point by holding Goose into Talos\u2019 direction, who instantly flinched back,\n\u201cThe cat stays.\u201d</p><p>Talos\u2019\nfrightened expression made way for a confused look. \u201cWhat\u2019s a cat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I ask\nyou a question?\u201d Maria suddenly asked, stopping the two from bickering.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d\nTalos shrugged.</p><p>\u201cCan all of\nyou change your appearance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhysiologically?\nYes.\u201d He answered. \u201cBut it requires practice and, dare I say, talent to-\u201c</p><p>\u201cSo, you\ncould change into anything?\u201d Maria interrupted.</p><p>\u201cIf I see\nit first\u2026\u201d</p><p>While Fury\nand Maria started to suggest the weirdest things for him to turn into, you\nzoned out, preferring the sight out of the front shield to their conversation.\nFinally, you were called back by Carol\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cAlright, guys,\u201d\nshe shot you a quick glance, \u201cHold on\u2026\u201d</p><p>The jet\nrattled and shook when you started to brake through the atmosphere, so much so,\nthat you started to question the stability of the ship, especially considering\nthe recent provisional adjustments\u2026 Luckily the \u2018space turbulances\u2019 (as Fury\ncalled it) were over nearly as soon as they started and you suddenly found\nyourself in complete absence of gravity.</p><p>The feeling\nof weightlessness was difficult to describe, but it was something you definitely\nwouldn\u2019t forget all too quickly. You looked in wonder at your own arms, that\nhad risen without you having any influence on it. It was then, that the\nrealization, that you really were in space, settled in and you couldn\u2019t help\nbut laugh a little.</p><p>Carol soon\npressed a few buttons that activated some sort of gravity stabilizer, it felt\nlike something tugged at your stomach and for a second you feared you might\ngrow sick. The feeling passed quickly though and you finally were able to focus\non the absolutely marvelous sight on front of you. There were so many stars,\nstretching out until forever \u2013 but not a sign of Mar-Vell\u2019s laboratory.</p><p>\u201cHere it\nis,\u201d Carol said, \u201cWe\u2019re right were it\u2019s supposed to be\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe\nquestion is,\u201d Fury objected, \u201cIs it in front or behind of all that nothing?\u201d</p><p>Carol\ndidn\u2019t pay him any mind, instead she smiled and lifted her hand, she typed away\non the little display on her forearm whereupon a huge spacecraft appeared in\nfront of you. You\u2019d be astounded, but the truth was, that wasn\u2019t by far the\ncraziest thing you had witnessed in the last 24 hours.</p><p>Carol and\nMaria piloted the jet into the landing dock of the lab, touching down gently\nand with no complications.</p><p>\u201cThat was\namazing,\u201d you whispered causing Talos to smile at you and give you a little pat\non your shoulder, before exiting the jet quickly.</p><p>At first\nyou blamed that on his want to get away from Goose, but you started to doubt\nthat theory when it seemed that he couldn\u2019t make his way through the lab fast\nenough. Carol kept up with his pace, while the rest of you decided to be a bit\nmore careful when it came to exploring.</p><p>The inside\nof the lab reminded you more of a factory than of a spaceship, the faint buzz\nof the engine was omnipresent, but except for that and the echo of your footsteps\nit was completely silent.</p><p>You had\nwalked through a couple of corridors, taking so many turns that you feared you\nmight not find your way back to the hangar if you had to, when you finally\nreached a larger room, full of tech and other stuff, you wouldn\u2019t have expected\nto find there\u2026 You really should have been gawking at the glowing blue cube in the\ncenter of the room, but while the others were already busy with that, you\ncouldn\u2019t help but wonder about the pin-ball machine at the other end of the\nroom.</p><p>As you made\nyour way over there you noticed toys lying in between scientific notes and\nunderneath the tables. You turned around frowning and saw Fury rummaging through\nall the stuff too. You both spotted the steaming cup on the table at the same\ntime and looked at each other alerted.</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t\nalone\u2026\u201d he said and in that same moment Talos started to make sounds that\nreminded you oddly of whale song.</p><p>Before you\nknew it, skrulls emerged from every corner of the ship, surrounding you. Talos\nlooked around searching for something \u2013 some<i>one</i>\nand he didn\u2019t have to do so for long\u2026 A woman appeared to your right and as if\nhe sensed her Talos turned around. They took a tentative step closer to each\nother, before they ran into each other\u2019s arms.</p><p>You smiled\nsoftly when they hugged each other as close as possible and a child walked out\nof the shadows, encouraged by her mother.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t\nlooking for the Tesseract,\u201d Maria whispered beside you.</p><p>Talos and\nhis family turned around to you and his wife and child stepped back afraid when\nthey spotted Carol.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all\nright,\u201d Talos immediately comforted them, \u201cShe\u2019s helped me find you.\u201d</p><p>You turned\nto look at Carol, tears brimmed in her eyes as she took a few steps forward.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so\nsorry,\u201d her voice quivered, \u201cI didn\u2019t know-\u201c</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re at\nwar,\u201d Talos put a hand on her shoulder and looked at her softly, \u201cI\u2019ve got blood\non my hands too\u2026 But we are here now, and I wouldn\u2019t have managed that without\nyour help.\u201d</p><p>Carol nodded\nand before she could reply something another child approached her and soon got\nher to smile again when he showed her his high-score on the pinball game.</p><p>Fury\ngrumbled something beside you, but you were too enamored by Carol\u2019s smile as\nshe looked at the young skrull, to understand what he said. What did catch your\nattention, however, was the troop of Kree soldiers who suddenly entered through\nthe door you five had come through earlier.</p><p>All of you\ntook an instinctive step back, the man who led them was holding Goose by her\nneck and tossed her on the ground, where she landed on her legs. She\nimmediately made her way over to Fury. You glared at the kree, if you had to\nguess you\u2019d say that was Yon-Rogg.</p><p>Carol took\na step forward and the kree stopped a few feet in front of her.</p><p>\u201cWhat have\nyou done with your suit?\u201d Yon-Rogg twisted his face in disgust.</p><p>\u201cThey got\ninto her head,\u201d a blue woman spat, \u201cJust like we feared.\u201d</p><p>Carol\nclenched her fist at her side. \u201cYou <i>lied</i>\nto me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI helped\nyou to become the best version of yourself,\u201d her former commander retorted, his\neyes wandered to where Carol\u2019s fist started to glow and he smirked. The light\nflickered and with a cry of pain she fell to her knees clutching her neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\ngiven can be taken away,\u201d Yon-Rogg said and took a step closer.</p><p>Carol tried\nto get back up, she wouldn\u2019t let him beat her just because he had taken her powers\naway, but the kree activated a device that created some sort of energy field that\nhelped him keep Carol in place.</p><p>Without giving\nit a second thought, you stepped forward, but before you knew it Yon-Rogg\nleashed out with his free arm and sent you flying into a wall.</p><p>You gasped\nin pain as you fell to the ground and you faintly heard someone shout your\nname. Groaning you tried to sit up and just as your vision cleared again you\nsaw Carol collapse. You scrambled to your feet, ignoring the flashes of pain\nthat ragged through you, but before you could do anything remotely useful one\nof the kree held a sword to your throat. You immediately stopped moving and\nglared at the man, but he only regarded you with something that could only be\ndescribed as mild annoyance and so you could only watch helplessly as Yon-Rogg\nleft with a few of his team members taking Carol with him.</p><p>You were\nbrought over to Maria and Fury who regarded you with concerned glances, but you\nsmiled letting them know it shouldn\u2019t be you they were worried about. A couple\nof kree were guarding the skrull at the other end of the room while you were\nleft with two others. One of them took Goose out of Fury\u2019s arms while the blue\none scanned her with a device, he had picked from his belt.</p><p>\u201cSpecies:\nFlerken; threat: high,\u201d it proclaimed.</p><p>You three\nfrowned as the kree muzzled the poor thing.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a\ncat, not Hannibal Lecter,\u201d Fury complained, but the kree ignored him and\nscanned him next.</p><p>\u201cSpecies:\nhuman; threat: low to none.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat thing\nis definitely broken,\u201d your boss declared.</p><p>\u201cAww, does\nthat hurt your ego?\u201d you teased and despite the situation Maria laughed beside\nyou as Fury narrowed his eyes at you.</p><p>Whatever he\nwanted to reply was drowned out by the device that had been pointed at you. \u201cSpecies:\nhuman \u2013 mutant; threat: can vary from low to high.\u201d</p><p>You raised\nyour eyebrows and looked up at the kree who was regarding you suspiciously. \u201cMate,\nI think your precious little thing there needs to be checked over.\u201d</p><p>You felt\nFury and Maria watching you closely, but you shrugged, what even was a mutant\nsupposed to be? The kree didn\u2019t give you any time to think about it any longer\nhowever, the one with the device grabbed you by your shirt and pulled you to\nyour feet before shoving you in the direction of the skrull.</p><p>\u201cLock them\nand the skrulls up,\u201d he told his comrade, \u201cAnd blast the others into space.\u201d</p><p>You tried\nto break out of your captor\u2019s grip as you heard what they planned to do with\nyour friends, but he pushed you to your knees leaving you to watch desperately as\nthey led Maria, Fury and Goose away.</p><p>Maria cast\na glance back at you and her eyes widened. \u201cY/N! Watch out-\u201c</p><p>But it was\ntoo late, you felt a sharp pain at the back of your head and then everything\nturned black.</p><p>.</p><p><b>Tags: </b></p><p>Permanent: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mndJHIKwtItZS9uo6y2Qalg\">@pamplemousse-m</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXeese0H3qAL8DvIHbxZ1bw\">@marvelouspottering</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJpId-roCBDnwYkTTpTbAAQ\">@aspiring-bookcollector</a> @angelklementieffs <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mi5f7xBznyrSF0TFUakTExA\">@nerdofthehighestcalibre</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m90pduaFVS5YdsPr8zOdazg\">@mummy-woves-you</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR_UCwARCul9gSnnNyDqpOQ\">@platonic-plots</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mH1VmxgP16D6lxvSlpEDAng\">@startrekkingaroundasgard</a>  @yanginginthere <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/me7DB2mG8DhehlAYFZHVFXQ\">@bennyboibaby</a>  <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4vG1qHGDt59zsRnZsORUSg\">@hakuna\u2013fuckin\u2013matata</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRxOV1HZZiJw1Ecc5XMEUFQ\">@sincereleygmg</a></p><p>Carol\nDanvers: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwb49_QWIvAX1cSdbW1nraw\">@wherethesinslie</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mT91T2IJLMmrHMhtbTBvwpg\">@th3nextsupreme</a></p><p>Life Changing: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYq5akgdIUIObJSN4G3XBkQ\">@spiderboy-needs-a-break</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpgmBNnMpd2CX9rqA-Tfy8w\">@marvelrose</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mo97ZKeRJuKNUtkDdWBy8vQ\">@ddaeng-danvers</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLS8a629EYsaC9greHS2aaA\">@soullesstrashcan</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqd062k7eL1sQGmxFkhj_8w\">@morgannope</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhrBeOHlKcb_PWbi3O-tMEA\">@chonisbestmistake</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnPEk6DSEYD95ycde4QWTpw\">@prettylittlealiengirl</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ8rrOWJnd1_R39xtY7CHFg\">@musicals-n-chill</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrJDs3M7YVna-kc7lymUZog\">@cuddlememerrick</a></p>",

She had changed her\nsuit\u2019s colours from teal, black and grey to red, blue and gold and it suited\nher rather well, if you dared to say so.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d\nshe looked down at herself, \u201cI had a little help from Monica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\nI wouldn\u2019t have trusted anyone else\u2019s advice either,\u201d you nodded, \u201cWhere is she\nby the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer\ngrandparents picked her up, she\u2019ll be safe with them.\u201d</p><p>You smiled\nat Carol and reached for hand to give it a reassuring squeeze, she felt guilty\nfor bringing Maria and Monica this close to danger in the first place, you\ncould see it in her eyes. She looked back at you smiling too and when you\nwanted to let go of her hand, she didn\u2019t let you, instead Carol only tightened\nher grip around it. </p><p>Suddenly a\nbit shy, she evaded your gaze as you continued to walk, but you didn\u2019t mind,\nnot at all. The walk over the lawn was shorter than you wished it to be, soon\nyou arrived at the little hangar, where you couldn\u2019t help, but stare amazed at\nthe quadjet. It had looked fancy even before the skrull had worked on it, but\nnow it really nearly looked like a spaceship.</p><p>It was only\nwhen Maria cleared her throat and gave a pointed look at your and Carol\u2019s\nintertwined hands, that you two jumped apart. While you both tried to cover\nyour embarrassment Maria only laughed. Luckily, Fury was inside the jet with\nTalos, you were sure he wouldn\u2019t have stopped teasing you the entire flight, if\nhe had seen you.</p><p>\u201cThere you\nare!\u201d Fury appeared again, the skrulls close on his heel. \u201cReady to go to\nspace?\u201d</p><p>You and\nMaria exchanged a glance, hell yeah, you were ready\u2026 <i>Space</i> for christ\u2019s sake\u2026</p><p>\u201cIt still\nworks pretty much the same way as before,\u201d Talos\u2019 science guy told Carol, \u201cJust\na few changes here and there\u2026 You should be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank\nyou,\u201d Carol replied.</p><p>The skrull\nnodded shortly and you started to frown.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t\ncoming with us?\u201d</p><p>He shook\nhis head and smiled sadly at you.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll stay\nbehind,\u201d Carol finally explained, \u201cYon-Rogg will track my signal back to this\nplace and we need all the extra time we can get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d\nyou protested.</p><p>\u201cIt was my\nidea,\u201d the skrull interrupted you and smiled, \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Before you\nor anyone else could protest further, he symmed Carol and, to be honest, that\ndid shut you up for a while\u2026 You were torn somewhere in between being amazed and\nweirded out.</p><p>The skrull\nseemed amused by your reactions judging by the very Carol-like smirk on his\nlips. Fury only shook his head and picked Goose up who was walking around his\nlegs.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\nlet\u2019s get going,\u201d he said.</p><p>While you\nboarded the jet, Talos stayed back, probably to say his farewells properly and\nyou all gave him the time gladly. Maria and Carol walked into the cockpit, both\nfeeling immediately at home. Behind their two seats were three more and it only\ntook you and Fury to exchange one glance to agree that you\u2019d take Talos in\nbetween the two of you, so while you took the seat behind Maria, he took the\none behind Carol, leaving the one in the middle for your new ally.</p><p>Talos only\nrolled his eyes when he entered. \u201cTake that creature away at least\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a\nchance,\u201d Fury replied cooing at Goose, causing you to laugh. He narrowed his\neyes at you. \u201cOne word to any other agent\u2026\u201d he threatened.</p><p>Smirking\nyou raised your arms in surrender. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, your secret\u2019s safe with me. No\none at SHIELD will ever know \u2018Don\u2019t-you-dare-call-me-Nick\u2019 Fury has a soft spot\nfor kitties.\u201d</p><p>Carol\nlaughed in the pilot\u2019s seat as she flicked a couple of switches. \u201cBuckle up,\nfolks.\u201d</p><p>You did as\nshe asked and grinned at her. \u201cReady, Danvers?\u201d</p><p>She looked\nover her shoulder and grinned back at you. \u201cHigher, further, faster, baby.\u201d</p><p>Maria\nlaughed beside her. \u201cSomething\u2019s telling me this time you\u2019re certainly going to\nkeep that promise.\u201d</p><p>Carol\nfeigned hurt. \u201cWhat do you mean, <i>this\ntime</i>?\u201d</p><p>Your\nattention was taken from the two women, when Talos leaned into your side. You\nshoved him back, but he still scooted closer to you and you realized he was\njust trying to get every possible inch of space between him and Goose. When\nFury realized that too, he laughed and cuddled the cat even more.</p><p>\u201cYou really\nshouldn\u2019t have that thing on your lap,\u201d Talos tried to tell him, but your boss\nonly smirked.</p><p>\u201cAs long as\nour alliance stands on shaky ground and you are frightened of her,\u201d he proved\nhis point by holding Goose into Talos\u2019 direction, who instantly flinched back,\n\u201cThe cat stays.\u201d</p><p>Talos\u2019\nfrightened expression made way for a confused look. \u201cWhat\u2019s a cat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I ask\nyou a question?\u201d Maria suddenly asked, stopping the two from bickering.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d\nTalos shrugged.</p><p>\u201cCan all of\nyou change your appearance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhysiologically?\nYes.\u201d He answered. \u201cBut it requires practice and, dare I say, talent to-\u201c</p><p>\u201cSo, you\ncould change into anything?\u201d Maria interrupted.</p><p>\u201cIf I see\nit first\u2026\u201d</p><p>While Fury\nand Maria started to suggest the weirdest things for him to turn into, you\nzoned out, preferring the sight out of the front shield to their conversation.\nFinally, you were called back by Carol\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cAlright, guys,\u201d\nshe shot you a quick glance, \u201cHold on\u2026\u201d</p><p>The jet\nrattled and shook when you started to brake through the atmosphere, so much so,\nthat you started to question the stability of the ship, especially considering\nthe recent provisional adjustments\u2026 Luckily the \u2018space turbulances\u2019 (as Fury\ncalled it) were over nearly as soon as they started and you suddenly found\nyourself in complete absence of gravity.</p><p>The feeling\nof weightlessness was difficult to describe, but it was something you definitely\nwouldn\u2019t forget all too quickly. You looked in wonder at your own arms, that\nhad risen without you having any influence on it. It was then, that the\nrealization, that you really were in space, settled in and you couldn\u2019t help\nbut laugh a little.</p><p>Carol soon\npressed a few buttons that activated some sort of gravity stabilizer, it felt\nlike something tugged at your stomach and for a second you feared you might\ngrow sick. The feeling passed quickly though and you finally were able to focus\non the absolutely marvelous sight on front of you. There were so many stars,\nstretching out until forever \u2013 but not a sign of Mar-Vell\u2019s laboratory.</p><p>\u201cHere it\nis,\u201d Carol said, \u201cWe\u2019re right were it\u2019s supposed to be\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe\nquestion is,\u201d Fury objected, \u201cIs it in front or behind of all that nothing?\u201d</p><p>Carol\ndidn\u2019t pay him any mind, instead she smiled and lifted her hand, she typed away\non the little display on her forearm whereupon a huge spacecraft appeared in\nfront of you. You\u2019d be astounded, but the truth was, that wasn\u2019t by far the\ncraziest thing you had witnessed in the last 24 hours.</p><p>Carol and\nMaria piloted the jet into the landing dock of the lab, touching down gently\nand with no complications.</p><p>\u201cThat was\namazing,\u201d you whispered causing Talos to smile at you and give you a little pat\non your shoulder, before exiting the jet quickly.</p><p>At first\nyou blamed that on his want to get away from Goose, but you started to doubt\nthat theory when it seemed that he couldn\u2019t make his way through the lab fast\nenough. Carol kept up with his pace, while the rest of you decided to be a bit\nmore careful when it came to exploring.</p><p>The inside\nof the lab reminded you more of a factory than of a spaceship, the faint buzz\nof the engine was omnipresent, but except for that and the echo of your footsteps\nit was completely silent.</p><p>You had\nwalked through a couple of corridors, taking so many turns that you feared you\nmight not find your way back to the hangar if you had to, when you finally\nreached a larger room, full of tech and other stuff, you wouldn\u2019t have expected\nto find there\u2026 You really should have been gawking at the glowing blue cube in the\ncenter of the room, but while the others were already busy with that, you\ncouldn\u2019t help but wonder about the pin-ball machine at the other end of the\nroom.</p><p>As you made\nyour way over there you noticed toys lying in between scientific notes and\nunderneath the tables. You turned around frowning and saw Fury rummaging through\nall the stuff too. You both spotted the steaming cup on the table at the same\ntime and looked at each other alerted.</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t\nalone\u2026\u201d he said and in that same moment Talos started to make sounds that\nreminded you oddly of whale song.</p><p>Before you\nknew it, skrulls emerged from every corner of the ship, surrounding you. Talos\nlooked around searching for something \u2013 some<i>one</i>\nand he didn\u2019t have to do so for long\u2026 A woman appeared to your right and as if\nhe sensed her Talos turned around. They took a tentative step closer to each\nother, before they ran into each other\u2019s arms.</p><p>You smiled\nsoftly when they hugged each other as close as possible and a child walked out\nof the shadows, encouraged by her mother.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t\nlooking for the Tesseract,\u201d Maria whispered beside you.</p><p>Talos and\nhis family turned around to you and his wife and child stepped back afraid when\nthey spotted Carol.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all\nright,\u201d Talos immediately comforted them, \u201cShe\u2019s helped me find you.\u201d</p><p>You turned\nto look at Carol, tears brimmed in her eyes as she took a few steps forward.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so\nsorry,\u201d her voice quivered, \u201cI didn\u2019t know-\u201c</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re at\nwar,\u201d Talos put a hand on her shoulder and looked at her softly, \u201cI\u2019ve got blood\non my hands too\u2026 But we are here now, and I wouldn\u2019t have managed that without\nyour help.\u201d</p><p>Carol nodded\nand before she could reply something another child approached her and soon got\nher to smile again when he showed her his high-score on the pinball game.</p><p>Fury\ngrumbled something beside you, but you were too enamored by Carol\u2019s smile as\nshe looked at the young skrull, to understand what he said. What did catch your\nattention, however, was the troop of Kree soldiers who suddenly entered through\nthe door you five had come through earlier.</p><p>All of you\ntook an instinctive step back, the man who led them was holding Goose by her\nneck and tossed her on the ground, where she landed on her legs. She\nimmediately made her way over to Fury. You glared at the kree, if you had to\nguess you\u2019d say that was Yon-Rogg.</p><p>Carol took\na step forward and the kree stopped a few feet in front of her.</p><p>\u201cWhat have\nyou done with your suit?\u201d Yon-Rogg twisted his face in disgust.</p><p>\u201cThey got\ninto her head,\u201d a blue woman spat, \u201cJust like we feared.\u201d</p><p>Carol\nclenched her fist at her side. \u201cYou <i>lied</i>\nto me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI helped\nyou to become the best version of yourself,\u201d her former commander retorted, his\neyes wandered to where Carol\u2019s fist started to glow and he smirked. The light\nflickered and with a cry of pain she fell to her knees clutching her neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\ngiven can be taken away,\u201d Yon-Rogg said and took a step closer.</p><p>Carol tried\nto get back up, she wouldn\u2019t let him beat her just because he had taken her powers\naway, but the kree activated a device that created some sort of energy field that\nhelped him keep Carol in place.</p><p>Without giving\nit a second thought, you stepped forward, but before you knew it Yon-Rogg\nleashed out with his free arm and sent you flying into a wall.</p><p>You gasped\nin pain as you fell to the ground and you faintly heard someone shout your\nname. Groaning you tried to sit up and just as your vision cleared again you\nsaw Carol collapse. You scrambled to your feet, ignoring the flashes of pain\nthat ragged through you, but before you could do anything remotely useful one\nof the kree held a sword to your throat. You immediately stopped moving and\nglared at the man, but he only regarded you with something that could only be\ndescribed as mild annoyance and so you could only watch helplessly as Yon-Rogg\nleft with a few of his team members taking Carol with him.</p><p>You were\nbrought over to Maria and Fury who regarded you with concerned glances, but you\nsmiled letting them know it shouldn\u2019t be you they were worried about. A couple\nof kree were guarding the skrull at the other end of the room while you were\nleft with two others. One of them took Goose out of Fury\u2019s arms while the blue\none scanned her with a device, he had picked from his belt.</p><p>\u201cSpecies:\nFlerken; threat: high,\u201d it proclaimed.</p><p>You three\nfrowned as the kree muzzled the poor thing.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a\ncat, not Hannibal Lecter,\u201d Fury complained, but the kree ignored him and\nscanned him next.</p><p>\u201cSpecies:\nhuman; threat: low to none.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat thing\nis definitely broken,\u201d your boss declared.</p><p>\u201cAww, does\nthat hurt your ego?\u201d you teased and despite the situation Maria laughed beside\nyou as Fury narrowed his eyes at you.</p><p>Whatever he\nwanted to reply was drowned out by the device that had been pointed at you. \u201cSpecies:\nhuman \u2013 mutant; threat: can vary from low to high.\u201d</p><p>You raised\nyour eyebrows and looked up at the kree who was regarding you suspiciously. \u201cMate,\nI think your precious little thing there needs to be checked over.\u201d</p><p>You felt\nFury and Maria watching you closely, but you shrugged, what even was a mutant\nsupposed to be? The kree didn\u2019t give you any time to think about it any longer\nhowever, the one with the device grabbed you by your shirt and pulled you to\nyour feet before shoving you in the direction of the skrull.</p><p>\u201cLock them\nand the skrulls up,\u201d he told his comrade, \u201cAnd blast the others into space.\u201d</p><p>You tried\nto break out of your captor\u2019s grip as you heard what they planned to do with\nyour friends, but he pushed you to your knees leaving you to watch desperately as\nthey led Maria, Fury and Goose away.</p><p>Maria cast\na glance back at you and her eyes widened. \u201cY/N! Watch out-\u201c</p><p>But it was\ntoo late, you felt a sharp pain at the back of your head and then everything\nturned black.</p><p>.</p><p><b>Tags: </b></p><p>Permanent: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mndJHIKwtItZS9uo6y2Qalg\">@pamplemousse-m</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXeese0H3qAL8DvIHbxZ1bw\">@marvelouspottering</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJpId-roCBDnwYkTTpTbAAQ\">@aspiring-bookcollector</a> @angelklementieffs <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mi5f7xBznyrSF0TFUakTExA\">@nerdofthehighestcalibre</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m90pduaFVS5YdsPr8zOdazg\">@mummy-woves-you</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR_UCwARCul9gSnnNyDqpOQ\">@platonic-plots</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mH1VmxgP16D6lxvSlpEDAng\">@startrekkingaroundasgard</a>  @yanginginthere <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/me7DB2mG8DhehlAYFZHVFXQ\">@bennyboibaby</a>  <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4vG1qHGDt59zsRnZsORUSg\">@hakuna\u2013fuckin\u2013matata</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRxOV1HZZiJw1Ecc5XMEUFQ\">@sincereleygmg</a></p><p>Carol\nDanvers: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwb49_QWIvAX1cSdbW1nraw\">@wherethesinslie</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mT91T2IJLMmrHMhtbTBvwpg\">@th3nextsupreme</a></p><p>Life Changing: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYq5akgdIUIObJSN4G3XBkQ\">@spiderboy-needs-a-break</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpgmBNnMpd2CX9rqA-Tfy8w\">@marvelrose</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mo97ZKeRJuKNUtkDdWBy8vQ\">@ddaeng-danvers</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLS8a629EYsaC9greHS2aaA\">@soullesstrashcan</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqd062k7eL1sQGmxFkhj_8w\">@morgannope</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhrBeOHlKcb_PWbi3O-tMEA\">@chonisbestmistake</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnPEk6DSEYD95ycde4QWTpw\">@prettylittlealiengirl</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ8rrOWJnd1_R39xtY7CHFg\">@musicals-n-chill</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrJDs3M7YVna-kc7lymUZog\">@cuddlememerrick</a></p>",

Maria and Carol walked into the cockpit, both\nfeeling immediately at home. Behind their two seats were three more and it only\ntook you and Fury to exchange one glance to agree that you&rsquo;d take Talos in\nbetween the two of you, so while you took the seat behind Maria, he took the\none behind Carol, leaving the one in the middle for your new ally.</p><p>Talos only\nrolled his eyes when he entered. &ldquo;Take that creature away at least&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not a\nchance,&rdquo; Fury replied cooing at Goose, causing you to laugh. He narrowed his\neyes at you. &ldquo;One word to any other agent&hellip;&rdquo; he threatened.</p><p>Smirking\nyou raised your arms in surrender. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, your secret&rsquo;s safe with me. No\none at SHIELD will ever know &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t-you-dare-call-me-Nick&rsquo; Fury has a soft spot\nfor kitties.&rdquo;</p><p>Carol\nlaughed in the pilot&rsquo;s seat as she flicked a couple of switches. &ldquo;Buckle up,\nfolks.&rdquo;</p><p>You did as\nshe asked and grinned at her. &ldquo;Ready, Danvers?&rdquo;</p><p>She looked\nover her shoulder and grinned back at you. &ldquo;Higher, further, faster, baby.&rdquo;</p><p>Maria\nlaughed beside her. &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s telling me this time you&rsquo;re certainly going to\nkeep that promise.&rdquo;</p><p>Carol\nfeigned hurt. &ldquo;What do you mean, <i>this\ntime</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>Your\nattention was taken from the two women, when Talos leaned into your side. You\nshoved him back, but he still scooted closer to you and you realized he was\njust trying to get every possible inch of space between him and Goose. When\nFury realized that too, he laughed and cuddled the cat even more.</p><p>&ldquo;You really\nshouldn&rsquo;t have that thing on your lap,&rdquo; Talos tried to tell him, but your boss\nonly smirked.</p><p>&ldquo;As long as\nour alliance stands on shaky ground and you are frightened of her,&rdquo; he proved\nhis point by holding Goose into Talos&rsquo; direction, who instantly flinched back,\n&ldquo;The cat stays.&rdquo;</p><p>Talos&rsquo;\nfrightened expression made way for a confused look. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s a cat?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can I ask\nyou a question?&rdquo; Maria suddenly asked, stopping the two from bickering.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo;\nTalos shrugged.</p><p>&ldquo;Can all of\nyou change your appearance?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Physiologically?\nYes.&rdquo; He answered. &ldquo;But it requires practice and, dare I say, talent to-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So, you\ncould change into anything?&rdquo; Maria interrupted.</p><p>&ldquo;If I see\nit first&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>While Fury\nand Maria started to suggest the weirdest things for him to turn into, you\nzoned out, preferring the sight out of the front shield to their conversation.\nFinally, you were called back by Carol&rsquo;s voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, guys,&rdquo;\nshe shot you a quick glance, &ldquo;Hold on&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>The jet\nrattled and shook when you started to brake through the atmosphere, so much so,\nthat you started to question the stability of the ship, especially considering\nthe recent provisional adjustments&hellip; Luckily the &lsquo;space turbulances&rsquo; (as Fury\ncalled it) were over nearly as soon as they started and you suddenly found\nyourself in complete absence of gravity.</p><p>The feeling\nof weightlessness was difficult to describe, but it was something you definitely\nwouldn&rsquo;t forget all too quickly. You looked in wonder at your own arms, that\nhad risen without you having any influence on it. It was then, that the\nrealization, that you really were in space, settled in and you couldn&rsquo;t help\nbut laugh a little.</p><p>Carol soon\npressed a few buttons that activated some sort of gravity stabilizer, it felt\nlike something tugged at your stomach and for a second you feared you might\ngrow sick. The feeling passed quickly though and you finally were able to focus\non the absolutely marvelous sight on front of you. There were so many stars,\nstretching out until forever &ndash; but not a sign of Mar-Vell&rsquo;s laboratory.</p><p>&ldquo;Here it\nis,&rdquo; Carol said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re right were it&rsquo;s supposed to be&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The\nquestion is,&rdquo; Fury objected, &ldquo;Is it in front or behind of all that nothing?&rdquo;</p><p>Carol\ndidn&rsquo;t pay him any mind, instead she smiled and lifted her hand, she typed away\non the little display on her forearm whereupon a huge spacecraft appeared in\nfront of you. You&rsquo;d be astounded, but the truth was, that wasn&rsquo;t by far the\ncraziest thing you had witnessed in the last 24 hours.</p><p>Carol and\nMaria piloted the jet into the landing dock of the lab, touching down gently\nand with no complications.</p><p>&ldquo;That was\namazing,&rdquo; you whispered causing Talos to smile at you and give you a little pat\non your shoulder, before exiting the jet quickly.</p><p>At first\nyou blamed that on his want to get away from Goose, but you started to doubt\nthat theory when it seemed that he couldn&rsquo;t make his way through the lab fast\nenough. Carol kept up with his pace, while the rest of you decided to be a bit\nmore careful when it came to exploring.</p><p>The inside\nof the lab reminded you more of a factory than of a spaceship, the faint buzz\nof the engine was omnipresent, but except for that and the echo of your footsteps\nit was completely silent.</p><p>You had\nwalked through a couple of corridors, taking so many turns that you feared you\nmight not find your way back to the hangar if you had to, when you finally\nreached a larger room, full of tech and other stuff, you wouldn&rsquo;t have expected\nto find there&hellip; You really should have been gawking at the glowing blue cube in the\ncenter of the room, but while the others were already busy with that, you\ncouldn&rsquo;t help but wonder about the pin-ball machine at the other end of the\nroom.</p><p>As you made\nyour way over there you noticed toys lying in between scientific notes and\nunderneath the tables. You turned around frowning and saw Fury rummaging through\nall the stuff too. You both spotted the steaming cup on the table at the same\ntime and looked at each other alerted.</p><p>&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t\nalone&hellip;&rdquo; he said and in that same moment Talos started to make sounds that\nreminded you oddly of whale song.</p><p>Before you\nknew it, skrulls emerged from every corner of the ship, surrounding you. Talos\nlooked around searching for something &ndash; some<i>one</i>\nand he didn&rsquo;t have to do so for long&hellip; A woman appeared to your right and as if\nhe sensed her Talos turned around. They took a tentative step closer to each\nother, before they ran into each other&rsquo;s arms.</p><p>You smiled\nsoftly when they hugged each other as close as possible and a child walked out\nof the shadows, encouraged by her mother.</p><p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t\nlooking for the Tesseract,&rdquo; Maria whispered beside you.</p><p>Talos and\nhis family turned around to you and his wife and child stepped back afraid when\nthey spotted Carol.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all\nright,&rdquo; Talos immediately comforted them, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s helped me find you.&rdquo;</p><p>You turned\nto look at Carol, tears brimmed in her eyes as she took a few steps forward.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so\nsorry,&rdquo; her voice quivered, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re at\nwar,&rdquo; Talos put a hand on her shoulder and looked at her softly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got blood\non my hands too&hellip; But we are here now, and I wouldn&rsquo;t have managed that without\nyour help.&rdquo;</p><p>Carol nodded\nand before she could reply something another child approached her and soon got\nher to smile again when he showed her his high-score on the pinball game.</p><p>Fury\ngrumbled something beside you, but you were too enamored by Carol&rsquo;s smile as\nshe looked at the young skrull, to understand what he said. What did catch your\nattention, however, was the troop of Kree soldiers who suddenly entered through\nthe door you five had come through earlier.</p><p>All of you\ntook an instinctive step back, the man who led them was holding Goose by her\nneck and tossed her on the ground, where she landed on her legs. She\nimmediately made her way over to Fury. You glared at the kree, if you had to\nguess you&rsquo;d say that was Yon-Rogg.</p><p>Carol took\na step forward and the kree stopped a few feet in front of her.</p><p>&ldquo;What have\nyou done with your suit?&rdquo; Yon-Rogg twisted his face in disgust.</p><p>&ldquo;They got\ninto her head,&rdquo; a blue woman spat, &ldquo;Just like we feared.&rdquo;</p><p>Carol\nclenched her fist at her side. &ldquo;You <i>lied</i>\nto me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I helped\nyou to become the best version of yourself,&rdquo; her former commander retorted, his\neyes wandered to where Carol&rsquo;s fist started to glow and he smirked. The light\nflickered and with a cry of pain she fell to her knees clutching her neck.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s\ngiven can be taken away,&rdquo; Yon-Rogg said and took a step closer.</p><p>Carol tried\nto get back up, she wouldn&rsquo;t let him beat her just because he had taken her powers\naway, but the kree activated a device that created some sort of energy field that\nhelped him keep Carol in place.</p><p>Without giving\nit a second thought, you stepped forward, but before you knew it Yon-Rogg\nleashed out with his free arm and sent you flying into a wall.</p><p>You gasped\nin pain as you fell to the ground and you faintly heard someone shout your\nname. Groaning you tried to sit up and just as your vision cleared again you\nsaw Carol collapse. You scrambled to your feet, ignoring the flashes of pain\nthat ragged through you, but before you could do anything remotely useful one\nof the kree held a sword to your throat. You immediately stopped moving and\nglared at the man, but he only regarded you with something that could only be\ndescribed as mild annoyance and so you could only watch helplessly as Yon-Rogg\nleft with a few of his team members taking Carol with him.</p><p>You were\nbrought over to Maria and Fury who regarded you with concerned glances, but you\nsmiled letting them know it shouldn&rsquo;t be you they were worried about. A couple\nof kree were guarding the skrull at the other end of the room while you were\nleft with two others. One of them took Goose out of Fury&rsquo;s arms while the blue\none scanned her with a device, he had picked from his belt.</p><p>&ldquo;Species:\nFlerken; threat: high,&rdquo; it proclaimed.</p><p>You three\nfrowned as the kree muzzled the poor thing.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a\ncat, not Hannibal Lecter,&rdquo; Fury complained, but the kree ignored him and\nscanned him next.</p><p>&ldquo;Species:\nhuman; threat: low to none.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That thing\nis definitely broken,&rdquo; your boss declared.</p><p>&ldquo;Aww, does\nthat hurt your ego?&rdquo; you teased and despite the situation Maria laughed beside\nyou as Fury narrowed his eyes at you.</p><p>Whatever he\nwanted to reply was drowned out by the device that had been pointed at you. &ldquo;Species:\nhuman &ndash; mutant; threat: can vary from low to high.&rdquo;</p><p>You raised\nyour eyebrows and looked up at the kree who was regarding you suspiciously. &ldquo;Mate,\nI think your precious little thing there needs to be checked over.&rdquo;</p><p>You felt\nFury and Maria watching you closely, but you shrugged, what even was a mutant\nsupposed to be? The kree didn&rsquo;t give you any time to think about it any longer\nhowever, the one with the device grabbed you by your shirt and pulled you to\nyour feet before shoving you in the direction of the skrull.</p><p>&ldquo;Lock them\nand the skrulls up,&rdquo; he told his comrade, &ldquo;And blast the others into space.&rdquo;</p><p>You tried\nto break out of your captor&rsquo;s grip as you heard what they planned to do with\nyour friends, but he pushed you to your knees leaving you to watch desperately as\nthey led Maria, Fury and Goose away.</p><p>Maria cast\na glance back at you and her eyes widened. &ldquo;Y/N! Watch out-&ldquo;</p><p>But it was\ntoo late, you felt a sharp pain at the back of your head and then everything\nturned black.</p><p>.</p><p><b>Tags: </b></p><p>Permanent: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mndJHIKwtItZS9uo6y2Qalg\">@pamplemousse-m</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXeese0H3qAL8DvIHbxZ1bw\">@marvelouspottering</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJpId-roCBDnwYkTTpTbAAQ\">@aspiring-bookcollector</a> @angelklementieffs <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mi5f7xBznyrSF0TFUakTExA\">@nerdofthehighestcalibre</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m90pduaFVS5YdsPr8zOdazg\">@mummy-woves-you</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR_UCwARCul9gSnnNyDqpOQ\">@platonic-plots</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mH1VmxgP16D6lxvSlpEDAng\">@startrekkingaroundasgard</a>  @yanginginthere <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/me7DB2mG8DhehlAYFZHVFXQ\">@bennyboibaby</a>  <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4vG1qHGDt59zsRnZsORUSg\">@hakuna&ndash;fuckin&ndash;matata</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRxOV1HZZiJw1Ecc5XMEUFQ\">@sincereleygmg</a></p><p>Carol\nDanvers: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwb49_QWIvAX1cSdbW1nraw\">@wherethesinslie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mT91T2IJLMmrHMhtbTBvwpg\">@th3nextsupreme</a></p><p>Life Changing: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYq5akgdIUIObJSN4G3XBkQ\">@spiderboy-needs-a-break</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpgmBNnMpd2CX9rqA-Tfy8w\">@marvelrose</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mo97ZKeRJuKNUtkDdWBy8vQ\">@ddaeng-danvers</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLS8a629EYsaC9greHS2aaA\">@soullesstrashcan</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqd062k7eL1sQGmxFkhj_8w\">@morgannope</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhrBeOHlKcb_PWbi3O-tMEA\">@chonisbestmistake</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnPEk6DSEYD95ycde4QWTpw\">@prettylittlealiengirl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ8rrOWJnd1_R39xtY7CHFg\">@musicals-n-chill</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrJDs3M7YVna-kc7lymUZog\">@cuddlememerrick</a></p>",
