        "body": "<p>Here is the first set of my re-watch reviews where I re-watch the eps that aired before I joined tumblr (1x01-2x14). These won\u2019t be detailed recaps so much as looking back at events and characters with the knowledge we now know of the show and to see what has changed for good or ill and what may become important once more. Let\u2019s dig in!</p><!-- more --><p>Still amazing that a Disney Channel show was made that focused on a girl learning her sister was actually her mother who had her as a teen and she doesn\u2019t know who her father is until the 6th ep. Obviously the show had to shift its focus and I\u2019m sure that eventually giving Andi a nuclear family once more was always part of the bargain Terri struck with Disney but it really was a genuinely shocking plot line.<br/></p><p>I remember when I first watched the pilot that I was pleasantly surprised that they actually had Andi tell Bex that she had abandoned her as a baby. It\u2019s a powerful moment and one that\u2019s true to life to someone facing Andi\u2019s situation. </p><p>Some really stellar acting from Lilan and Lauren. I think I had almost forgotten how toxic the dynamic was between Celia and Bex; so much hurt and anger tied up in their relationship.</p><p>Celia never flat out told Bex that she couldn\u2019t stay but she made clear that Bex wasn\u2019t truly welcome and Bex cuts and runs at the first setback which is why this toxic dynamic lasted 13 years. We can tell by And\u2019s reactions that she\u2019s seen this scenario play out before, just without the full context of what was behind this. </p><p>The show did a good job of providing answers in a low key way. What did Celia find in Bex\u2019s memory box 13 years ago? Probably a pregnancy test. How did Celia pass off Andi as her biological daughter? Likely along the lines of what her pesky neighbour Lilian said, that Andi was a late in life miracle baby; fertility issues are very taboo and even hinting at them would have shut down any follow up questions and would get people to stop thinking about the 16ish year gap between Celia\u2019s two \u2018daughters\u2019. </p><p>I really don\u2019t think Celia in her heart of hearts ever planned to tell Andi the truth and I think Bex sensed that which is why she went and showed Andi the memory box after Celia told her Andi couldn\u2019t know the secrets it contained. giving Andi the box when Bex knows she can be nosy was a way to force the issue without having to rely on Celia coming clean. </p><p>Could Celia have taken this secret to her grave? Quite possibly. With Celia and Ham\u2019s parents both dead, and Bex barely in Andi\u2019s life there\u2019s really no one who could have spilled the secret except for Mei but she seems like the type who would have enjoyed being able to lord this secret over Celia for the rest of her life.<br/></p><p>Andi\u2019s scooter gets dropped which makes sense as the scooter must be left over from an earlier version of the show where Celia was less strict and it would make sense for Andi to even consider buying one. It did make for a nice visual parallel between Andi and Bex.</p><p>The party in 1x04 is the closest analogue for the series finale party. The party was very fun and it\u2019s honestly a shame the show never had another one before the series finale. There were less characters at the original party and juggling screen time for all the main and recurring cast members will be a huge challenge in the finale. Guaranteed we\u2019ll see some big Muffy callbacks and some moments that show how far Andi and Jonah and Amber have come.</p><p>Marty\u2019s introduction came at the right time. They needed to give Buffy a love interest of her own to make the Jandi/Jyrus parallels they were building up more apparent as well as to show that they way she interacted with Jonah was different from Andi and Cyrus as well as to the show that her and Marty were very similar and were a good match but that Cyrus and Iris who were also very similar were not.<br/></p><p>Nice to see the GHC hanging out and supporting each other so much. I hope we have more GHC moments in the final 7 eps. It\u2019s sad watching all the nice Andi and Cyrus moments knowing how little they\u2019ll have after S1 ends. Interestingly, the first use of the music they used for Cyrus\u2019 first kiss with Iris and with TJ arriving at the Shiva was a GHC hug at Andi\u2019s.\u00a0</p><p>Andi and Cyrus had a lovely conversation in the texts after Cyrus\u2019 disastrous first date where she comforted him and I hope we get some version of that on the show before it ends. They also did a good job of showing how much more similar Andi and Cyrus are with each other than either are with Buffy; both of them tend to the dramatic and are unathletic and to differing extents lacking in self-confidence. Not to mention their similar taste in boys.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Cyrus really had very little compared to Buffy who had least had her whole learning not to be so competitive arc as well as her hair story line. Speaking of which the show really never did touch on racism again and it seems unlikely they\u2019ll do so in the final eps. That Cyrus didn\u2019t have much isn\u2019t so shocking since we know that they only got final permission for Cyrus to look back and come out just days before filming the look back so his story line had to be written lightly in case it was scrapped and they had to start over.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s painful watching Cyrus\u2019 first date with Iris. That he\u2019ll never get to do that with a boy is just sad. At least we\u2019ll likely get Cyrus holding hands with TJ in the final minutes of the series. Wouldn\u2019t shock me if Cyrus tried giving him and TJ a mashup name like he did with Iris; Josh answered an ask back in February about whether he preferred Tyrus or CJ and he replied,\u00a0\u2018still CJ\u2019\u2019. It caught my eye as the type of answer he\u2019d give that actually is a spoiler from the show, I could very easily see Cyrus trying to get CJ going only to have someone else use Tyrus which ends up sticking.\u00a0</p><p>Dinosaurs were a big part of Ciris and were dropped after they broke up so if Dinosaurs are making a comeback with Cyrus\u2019 screenplay in what was 3x19 they\u2019ll almost certainly tie in with Tyrus.</p><p>I never drank the Jyrus koolaid but looking back there was really very little in the first 6 eps to even suggest a one sided crush on Cyrus\u2019 part. They did do some interesting parallels in 1x04 with Cyrus shoving his way into the Jandi selfie at the Spoon and later Amber shoves her way into the Jandi selfie at the party (and I could see all the endgame couples taking selfies at the finale party). It makes sense that there\u2019s very little as the show needed to be able to pass of Cyrus\u2019 feelings towards Jonah as just a bromance if Disney said no to Cyrus coming out.</p><p>We can see the two fatal flaws that ended up hamstringing Cyrus\u2019 story line already in the first eps. Cyrus has too many parents and too few hobbies. It\u2019s admirable to give Cyrus 4 parents but that\u2019s too many to give any sort of focus on, which is why in 3x11 we only saw Cyrus\u2019 bio parents. And Cyrus had no hobbies which meant it was very easy to relegate him to comic relief/therapist friend.\u00a0</p><p>The show starts it\u2019s long running gag of having Cyrus\u2019 parents engage in questionable if not outright unethical behaviour with Leslie emailing everyone about Andi and Bex and then about the party. The show probably didn\u2019t envision how much mental health would become a part of future story lines but a lot of the things they wrote about Cyrus\u2019 parents who are the only shrinks we\u2019ve met on this show really undercut the message they\u2019re trying to send.</p><p>Jonah has fallen a long way from the pilot; hard to see any traces of that\u00a0\u2018\u2019Bill Clinton charm\u2019\u2019 in the Jonah we left off with in 3x13 (and that line is painful reminder that S1 began production a couple of months before the 2016 election). I do think we\u2019ll see more of that kind, supportive Jonah in the final eps.\u00a0</p><p>Wild that the show decided to go back to Jamber for one last obstacle to endgame Jandi. The show retconning Jonah\u2019s age means that Jamber is even creepier on re-watch. Amber alert really was creepy and Amber was ruthless when she shamed Andi for not knowing who her dad was at the party. She never apologized for that nor was she really redeemed so hopefully we see some growth in the final eps.</p><p>I had really forgotten all about Britney and the Fringe. Can\u2019t say I miss either</p><p>The aborted Gabriel plot is set up for a pay off that will never really come</p><p>Extremely difficult to watch Ham\u2019s scenes knowing about Stoney. I cringed every time he was near Andi. That being said, he really was a good character who balanced out the Mack family quite well, such a shame they didn\u2019t cast someone else back in S1 to play him.\u00a0</p><p>Overall the first 6 eps had a charm and wholesomeness that the show has lost somewhat. Partly this is because the show is just establishing its world and characters and there\u2019s still this feeling that the sky\u2019s the limit before the inevitable restrictions and cut plots and characters being written off and actors getting arrested that befell the show.</p><p>\u00a0I do think in otl that eps 3x18-3x21 likely recaptured a bit of this optimistic tone as everything was wrapped up and the show has to make decisions and stick with them and let the characters experience unvarnished triumphs and that this largely survived the re-shoots.\u00a0</p>",

There were less characters at the original party and juggling screen time for all the main and recurring cast members will be a huge challenge in the finale. Guaranteed we\u2019ll see some big Muffy callbacks and some moments that show how far Andi and Jonah and Amber have come.</p><p>Marty\u2019s introduction came at the right time. They needed to give Buffy a love interest of her own to make the Jandi/Jyrus parallels they were building up more apparent as well as to show that they way she interacted with Jonah was different from Andi and Cyrus as well as to the show that her and Marty were very similar and were a good match but that Cyrus and Iris who were also very similar were not.<br></p><p>Nice to see the GHC hanging out and supporting each other so much. I hope we have more GHC moments in the final 7 eps. It\u2019s sad watching all the nice Andi and Cyrus moments knowing how little they\u2019ll have after S1 ends. Interestingly, the first use of the music they used for Cyrus\u2019 first kiss with Iris and with TJ arriving at the Shiva was a GHC hug at Andi\u2019s.\u00a0</p><p>Andi and Cyrus had a lovely conversation in the texts after Cyrus\u2019 disastrous first date where she comforted him and I hope we get some version of that on the show before it ends.

Not to mention their similar taste in boys.\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus really had very little compared to Buffy who had least had her whole learning not to be so competitive arc as well as her hair story line. Speaking of which the show really never did touch on racism again and it seems unlikely they\u2019ll do so in the final eps. That Cyrus didn\u2019t have much isn\u2019t so shocking since we know that they only got final permission for Cyrus to look back and come out just days before filming the look back so his story line had to be written lightly in case it was scrapped and they had to start over.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s painful watching Cyrus\u2019 first date with Iris. That he\u2019ll never get to do that with a boy is just sad. At least we\u2019ll likely get Cyrus holding hands with TJ in the final minutes of the series. Wouldn\u2019t shock me if Cyrus tried giving him and TJ a mashup name like he did with Iris; Josh answered an ask back in February about whether he preferred Tyrus or CJ and he replied,\u00a0\u2018still CJ\u2019\u2019. It caught my eye as the type of answer he\u2019d give that actually is a spoiler from the show, I could very easily see Cyrus trying to get CJ going only to have someone else use Tyrus which ends up sticking.\u00a0</p><p>Dinosaurs were a big part of Ciris and were dropped after they broke up so if Dinosaurs are making a comeback with Cyrus\u2019 screenplay in what was 3x19 they\u2019ll almost certainly tie in with Tyrus.</p><p>I never drank the Jyrus koolaid but looking back there was really very little in the first 6 eps to even suggest a one sided crush on Cyrus\u2019 part. They did do some interesting parallels in 1x04 with Cyrus shoving his way into the Jandi selfie at the Spoon and later Amber shoves her way into the Jandi selfie at the party (and I could see all the endgame couples taking selfies at the finale party). It makes sense that there\u2019s very little as the show needed to be able to pass of Cyrus\u2019 feelings towards Jonah as just a bromance if Disney said no to Cyrus coming out.</p><p>We can see the two fatal flaws that ended up hamstringing Cyrus\u2019 story line already in the first eps. Cyrus has too many parents and too few hobbies. It\u2019s admirable to give Cyrus 4 parents but that\u2019s too many to give any sort of focus on, which is why in 3x11 we only saw Cyrus\u2019 bio parents. And Cyrus had no hobbies which meant it was very easy to relegate him to comic relief/therapist friend.\u00a0</p><p>The show starts it\u2019s long running gag of having Cyrus\u2019 parents engage in questionable if not outright unethical behaviour with Leslie emailing everyone about Andi and Bex and then about the party. The show probably didn\u2019t envision how much mental health would become a part of future story lines but a lot of the things they wrote about Cyrus\u2019 parents who are the only shrinks we\u2019ve met on this show really undercut the message they\u2019re trying to send.</p><p>Jonah has fallen a long way from the pilot; hard to see any traces of that\u00a0\u2018\u2019Bill Clinton charm\u2019\u2019 in the Jonah we left off with in 3x13 (and that line is painful reminder that S1 began production a couple of months before the 2016 election). I do think we\u2019ll see more of that kind, supportive Jonah in the final eps.\u00a0</p><p>Wild that the show decided to go back to Jamber for one last obstacle to endgame Jandi. The show retconning Jonah\u2019s age means that Jamber is even creepier on re-watch. Amber alert really was creepy and Amber was ruthless when she shamed Andi for not knowing who her dad was at the party. She never apologized for that nor was she really redeemed so hopefully we see some growth in the final eps.</p><p>I had really forgotten all about Britney and the Fringe. Can\u2019t say I miss either</p><p>The aborted Gabriel plot is set up for a pay off that will never really come</p><p>Extremely difficult to watch Ham\u2019s scenes knowing about Stoney. I cringed every time he was near Andi. That being said, he really was a good character who balanced out the Mack family quite well, such a shame they didn\u2019t cast someone else back in S1 to play him.\u00a0</p><p>Overall the first 6 eps had a charm and wholesomeness that the show has lost somewhat. Partly this is because the show is just establishing its world and characters and there\u2019s still this feeling that the sky\u2019s the limit before the inevitable restrictions and cut plots and characters being written off and actors getting arrested that befell the show.</p><p>\u00a0I do think in otl that eps 3x18-3x21 likely recaptured a bit of this optimistic tone as everything was wrapped up and the show has to make decisions and stick with them and let the characters experience unvarnished triumphs and that this largely survived the re-shoots.\u00a0</p>",
                "content": "<p>Here is the first set of my re-watch reviews where I re-watch the eps that aired before I joined tumblr (1x01-2x14). These won&rsquo;t be detailed recaps so much as looking back at events and characters with the knowledge we now know of the show and to see what has changed for good or ill and what may become important once more. Let&rsquo;s dig in!</p><p>Still amazing that a Disney Channel show was made that focused on a girl learning her sister was actually her mother who had her as a teen and she doesn&rsquo;t know who her father is until the 6th ep. Obviously the show had to shift its focus and I&rsquo;m sure that eventually giving Andi a nuclear family once more was always part of the bargain Terri struck with Disney but it really was a genuinely shocking plot line.<br /></p><p>I remember when I first watched the pilot that I was pleasantly surprised that they actually had Andi tell Bex that she had abandoned her as a baby. It&rsquo;s a powerful moment and one that&rsquo;s true to life to someone facing Andi&rsquo;s situation. </p><p>Some really stellar acting from Lilan and Lauren. I think I had almost forgotten how toxic the dynamic was between Celia and Bex; so much hurt and anger tied up in their relationship.</p><p>Celia never flat out told Bex that she couldn&rsquo;t stay but she made clear that Bex wasn&rsquo;t truly welcome and Bex cuts and runs at the first setback which is why this toxic dynamic lasted 13 years. We can tell by And&rsquo;s reactions that she&rsquo;s seen this scenario play out before, just without the full context of what was behind this. </p><p>The show did a good job of providing answers in a low key way. What did Celia find in Bex&rsquo;s memory box 13 years ago? Probably a pregnancy test. How did Celia pass off Andi as her biological daughter? Likely along the lines of what her pesky neighbour Lilian said, that Andi was a late in life miracle baby; fertility issues are very taboo and even hinting at them would have shut down any follow up questions and would get people to stop thinking about the 16ish year gap between Celia&rsquo;s two &lsquo;daughters&rsquo;. </p><p>I really don&rsquo;t think Celia in her heart of hearts ever planned to tell Andi the truth and I think Bex sensed that which is why she went and showed Andi the memory box after Celia told her Andi couldn&rsquo;t know the secrets it contained. giving Andi the box when Bex knows she can be nosy was a way to force the issue without having to rely on Celia coming clean. </p><p>Could Celia have taken this secret to her grave? Quite possibly. With Celia and Ham&rsquo;s parents both dead, and Bex barely in Andi&rsquo;s life there&rsquo;s really no one who could have spilled the secret except for Mei but she seems like the type who would have enjoyed being able to lord this secret over Celia for the rest of her life.<br /></p><p>Andi&rsquo;s scooter gets dropped which makes sense as the scooter must be left over from an earlier version of the show where Celia was less strict and it would make sense for Andi to even consider buying one. It did make for a nice visual parallel between Andi and Bex.</p><p>The party in 1x04 is the closest analogue for the series finale party.

        "body": "<h1>The Tree | Ambris Oneshot</h1><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to say, you have alot to learn&rdquo;</p><p>~</p><p>It was a Monday Morning, the sunlight was shining through Iris&rsquo;s teal curtains as she started to wake up. Iris didn&rsquo;t really need an alarm clock, she had her dog to wake her up by licking her in the face, and when that didn&rsquo;t happen the sun was to bright for her to stand anyway so it would make her instantly awake. She yawns and stretches out her arms, then a frown comes to her face. She isn&rsquo;t in <i>her</i> bedroom, she&rsquo;s in her new house in a random room filled with cardboard boxes. This was her first night at the house and honestly, she slept like a baby, but it wasn&rsquo;t the most homely sight to wake up to. She groans and she kicks her covers off and chucks her clothes on. She puts on her bracelet then go head downstaries to get a nibble to eat.</p><p>-</p><p>&ldquo;ambeeRRR TURN THE ALARM OFF&rdquo;</p><p>Amber wakes up to her twin brother,TJ, screaming at her. This is her daily routine. Wake up, regretting agreeing to share a room with TJ, brush her teeth but a unnecessarily loud electric toothbrush, get dressed, eat and leave her house for school. Simple but sweet she likes to describe it as. But today she is happy while getting ready, because after school her and her group of friends are having a big sleepover at Marty&rsquo;s. But she doesn&rsquo;t have long to think about it because before she knows it she needs to pack everything in her rucksack then start cycling to school.</p><p>~</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Wandi!&rdquo;</p><p>Amber walks up to her 2 of her dating bestfriends in the middle of the cafeteria. Although she loved them she knew she was just really a third wheel, but thankfully they didn&rsquo;t flirt all the time and they included and cared for her like she was there child.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Ambs!&rdquo; Walker says &ldquo;bro hugging&rdquo; her, this was his classic greeting.</p><p>&ldquo;So, how did you guy&rsquo;s audition go? For the art club?&rdquo;</p><p>Andi&rsquo;s face immediately lit up &ldquo;we both got in!!

That&rsquo;s great&rdquo; </p><p><i>Amber Kippen to the head teachers office please</i></p><p>&ldquo;oh my gosh Amber what have you done??&rdquo; Andi looks worried as Amber never gets called to the Head&rsquo;s office. Although she talked in class, chewed gum and played on her phone she was never caught and was the teachers favourite</p><p>&ldquo;I-i don&rsquo;t know! But I better go, save a seat for me at snack!&rdquo; Before Andi and Walker could even say goodbye Amber was rushing down the corridors to get to the office. She was scared to say the least.</p><p>Amber runs to the door and chaps a little bit too loudly, but she didn&rsquo;t care at this point. She just wanted this nervous feeling to go away. </p><p>&ldquo;Amber, come take a seat please&rdquo;</p><p>Amber walks in and see&rsquo;s another girl sitting at the desk, at first she thought she was snitching on her for something she never did. But she didn&rsquo;t know this girl, her short dark hair and cute puppy eyes weren&rsquo;t familiar. The girl glanced at Amber, then looked away to pay attention to the Head. Amber sat down, and while doing so she noticed a cute pastel bracelet on the girls wrist that said &ldquo;kiss me&rdquo;, Amber got a thought at that moment, and not the most comforting one.</p><p>&ldquo;Amber&rdquo; Spoke the Head, clearing his throat, &ldquo;This is Iris, she came here from the countryside in Scotland. She&rsquo;s new here and since your the only student in the sane year as her with straight A&rsquo;s I thought you would be a appropriate partner.</p><p>Amber felt a stroke of confusion &quot;only one?&rdquo; Not that she didn&rsquo;t want to help this girl&hellip; Iris. But she didn&rsquo;t know she was such a good worker. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Cyrus Goodman almost tied with you but failed p.e, he was your closet competitor. </p><p>&quot;Cyrus&hellip;.oh my brother&rsquo;s boyfriend, of course! He is a little smart- I mean&hellip; Um it would be lovely to show Iris around&rdquo;</p><p>The Head smiled then gestured to the door, the two girl exchanged glances then got up and left.</p><p>~</p><p>&ldquo;So, Iris&rdquo; Amber started the second they left the office &ldquo;What is your first class?&rdquo;</p><p>Iris ruffles through her pocket too look for her timetable, it was just then when she turned she saw the earrings she was wearing, they had little cute deers on them that looked s but like Bambi, Amber&rsquo;s favourite character of all time.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip;.oh maths&rdquo; she says her soft smile fading, maths,yes what a great class to start with. &ldquo;Bummer&rdquo; Amber says noticing her disliking for it &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s your teacher though?&rdquo;</p><p>She unfolds the paper a but more and takes a closer look</p><p>&ldquo;miss bar? Bark-tree?&rdquo;</p><p>Amber&rsquo;s face lightened up as she heard the name &ldquo;Your so lucky, I&rsquo;m in her class and she never teaches us. She gives us worksheets then plays in her phone, it&rsquo;s amazing&rdquo;</p><p>Iris gave a little chuckle while listening to Amber rant about how the other teachers would shout at you for having gum in class. Amber had a really nice voice, soothing to listen to, it was poetry in sound for. Beautiful and inspirational. Amber had these gorgeous multicoloured eyes, and long blonde hair that was in French braids, it looked so fluffy and light she just wanted to play with it. Amber was in the middle of talking when Iris unwillingly opened her mouth</p><p>&ldquo;Your hair reminds me of my bestfriend&rsquo;s&rdquo;</p><p>Amber was a little shocked Iris talked, but she liked it so she wanted her to do it again. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s your bestfriend?</p><p>Iris smiled, &quot;Haili, we met in nursery, we where besties until I left. We use to ride our horses up to this old Castle, and we would have picnics, and on some really nice days we would cycle to the river and skid stones. We had so many hangouts, it was so fun. She always had a joke to bring up or a unanswerable question, she always looked out for me&hellip;I couldn&rsquo;t have asked for s better friend, we even had boyfriends that where bestfriends. I broke up with mine but she kept dating him so we became one big friend group, it felt so..at home&hellip;ya- ya-know?&rdquo; </p><p>Iris didn&rsquo;t notice she started tearing up at the end, Amber must have been horrified. She asked Iris a simple question and she spat out a whole story, she looked up to Amber who had her eyebrows furrowed and her face was giving a soft frown, she felt so bad for Iris. Amber never had to experience leaving people behind, she&rsquo;s lived in Shady side her whole life.</p><p>&ldquo;im so sorry iris&hellip;hey&hellip;I got a idea?&rdquo; Iris looks up a bit curious and gives a small nod, &ldquo;Me and my friends and my brother&rsquo;s friend have a secret hideout&hellip; I&rsquo;ll think you&rsquo;ll like it, join us after school?&rdquo;</p><p>Iris bites her lip, think for a minute, &ldquo;Sure&rdquo; she says sweetly. Amber smiles and then stops walking &ldquo;here is our class, now let&rsquo;s go in and do nothinnnng!!&rdquo; Iris laughs as she follows the excited blonde into maths.</p><p>~</p><p>&ldquo;Hey guys&rdquo; Amber says sitting down, she smiles at Iris then nods at the empty seat next to her. Iris sits down to join in, and nobody seems to be bothered, so they all start chatting away occasionally asking Iris questions.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you coming to the Shady Tree after school with us, Iris?&rdquo; Jonah asks sitting on the opposite side of her. She seems s bit confused at first before Amber chimes in &ldquo;Yeah, she is. That&rsquo;s what our hideout is called Iris, the Shady Tree&rdquo;</p><p>Iris smiled and turns back round to Jonah &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s a tree?&rdquo; He seems a little offended by the question and sarcasm in Iris&rsquo;s voice, but he wants to be friendly. &ldquo;Well two trees that are joined together, there is a gap in the middle and you can co inside the trees. Only we know about it, we even borrowed saws and furniture and we made staries up to the top and seats to sit on, and obviously we feed our squirrel neighbours!&rdquo;</p><p>Iris gives a giggle &ldquo;that&rsquo;s sounds so cool, is it like a second home to you guys?&rdquo; Jonah and Amber nod. It sounds like a beautiful place, Iris really can&rsquo;t wait too see it, but she needs to get through another 2 classes before school ends.</p><p>~</p><p>Iris was putting the last notepad in her locker, it was a pink fluffy one she got for her last birthday, she slided it in and shut the locker. It was last period so now she had to go find Amber, she went walked to the main office and stood for a bit until she showed up.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi&rdquo; a soft voice called, Amber was walking up to Iris. &ldquo;Sorry I was a bit late, the teacher held me back for throwing rubbers at reed&rdquo;, Iris just laughs as a response and the two leave to meet the others.</p><p>&ldquo;So where is the tree?&rdquo; </p><p>Amber has a great big smile, like she was imagining the tree in her head &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in the campsite resort, it&rsquo;s pretty hidden though so not many people go&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;sounds great&rdquo;</p><p>Iris couldn&rsquo;t help but keep glancing at Amber while walking to the resort, her eyes where sparkling and she had long lashes.

Iris didn\u2019t really need an alarm clock, she had her dog to wake her up by licking her in the face, and when that didn\u2019t happen the sun was to bright for her to stand anyway so it would make her instantly awake. She yawns and stretches out her arms, then a frown comes to her face. She isn\u2019t in <i>her</i> bedroom, she\u2019s in her new house in a random room filled with cardboard boxes. This was her first night at the house and honestly, she slept like a baby, but it wasn\u2019t the most homely sight to wake up to. She groans and she kicks her covers off and chucks her clothes on. She puts on her bracelet then go head downstaries to get a nibble to eat.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cambeeRRR TURN THE ALARM OFF\u201d</p><p>Amber wakes up to her twin brother,TJ, screaming at her. This is her daily routine. Wake up, regretting agreeing to share a room with TJ, brush her teeth but a unnecessarily loud electric toothbrush, get dressed, eat and leave her house for school. Simple but sweet she likes to describe it as. But today she is happy while getting ready, because after school her and her group of friends are having a big sleepover at Marty\u2019s.

We were the highest scoring!\u201d She and Walker shared joyful glances before turning back to Amber, \u201cwow! That\u2019s great\u201d </p><p><i>Amber Kippen to the head teachers office please</i></p><p>\u201coh my gosh Amber what have you done??\u201d Andi looks worried as Amber never gets called to the Head\u2019s office. Although she talked in class, chewed gum and played on her phone she was never caught and was the teachers favourite</p><p>\u201cI-i don\u2019t know! But I better go, save a seat for me at snack!\u201d Before Andi and Walker could even say goodbye Amber was rushing down the corridors to get to the office. She was scared to say the least.</p><p>Amber runs to the door and chaps a little bit too loudly, but she didn\u2019t care at this point. She just wanted this nervous feeling to go away. </p><p>\u201cAmber, come take a seat please\u201d</p><p>Amber walks in and see\u2019s another girl sitting at the desk, at first she thought she was snitching on her for something she never did. But she didn\u2019t know this girl, her short dark hair and cute puppy eyes weren\u2019t familiar. The girl glanced at Amber, then looked away to pay attention to the Head. Amber sat down, and while doing so she noticed a cute pastel bracelet on the girls wrist that said \u201ckiss me\u201d, Amber got a thought at that moment, and not the most comforting one.</p><p>\u201cAmber\u201d Spoke the Head, clearing his throat, \u201cThis is Iris, she came here from the countryside in Scotland. She\u2019s new here and since your the only student in the sane year as her with straight A\u2019s I thought you would be a appropriate partner.</p><p>Amber felt a stroke of confusion \"only one?\u201d Not that she didn\u2019t want to help this girl\u2026 Iris. But she didn\u2019t know she was such a good worker. </p><p>\u201cYes, Cyrus Goodman almost tied with you but failed p.e, he was your closet competitor. </p><p>\"Cyrus\u2026.oh my brother\u2019s boyfriend, of course! He is a little smart- I mean\u2026 Um it would be lovely to show Iris around\u201d</p><p>The Head smiled then gestured to the door, the two girl exchanged glances then got up and left.</p><p>~</p><p>\u201cSo, Iris\u201d Amber started the second they left the office \u201cWhat is your first class?\u201d</p><p>Iris ruffles through her pocket too look for her timetable, it was just then when she turned she saw the earrings she was wearing, they had little cute deers on them that looked s but like Bambi, Amber\u2019s favourite character of all time.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026.oh maths\u201d she says her soft smile fading, maths,yes what a great class to start with. \u201cBummer\u201d Amber says noticing her disliking for it \u201cWho\u2019s your teacher though?\u201d</p><p>She unfolds the paper a but more and takes a closer look</p><p>\u201cmiss bar? Bark-tree?\u201d</p><p>Amber\u2019s face lightened up as she heard the name \u201cYour so lucky, I\u2019m in her class and she never teaches us. She gives us worksheets then plays in her phone, it\u2019s amazing\u201d</p><p>Iris gave a little chuckle while listening to Amber rant about how the other teachers would shout at you for having gum in class. Amber had a really nice voice, soothing to listen to, it was poetry in sound for. Beautiful and inspirational. Amber had these gorgeous multicoloured eyes, and long blonde hair that was in French braids, it looked so fluffy and light she just wanted to play with it. Amber was in the middle of talking when Iris unwillingly opened her mouth</p><p>\u201cYour hair reminds me of my bestfriend\u2019s\u201d</p><p>Amber was a little shocked Iris talked, but she liked it so she wanted her to do it again. \u201cWho\u2019s your bestfriend?</p><p>Iris smiled, \"Haili, we met in nursery, we where besties until I left. We use to ride our horses up to this old Castle, and we would have picnics, and on some really nice days we would cycle to the river and skid stones. We had so many hangouts, it was so fun. She always had a joke to bring up or a unanswerable question, she always looked out for me\u2026I couldn\u2019t have asked for s better friend, we even had boyfriends that where bestfriends. I broke up with mine but she kept dating him so we became one big friend group, it felt so..at home\u2026ya- ya-know?\u201d </p><p>Iris didn\u2019t notice she started tearing up at the end, Amber must have been horrified. She asked Iris a simple question and she spat out a whole story, she looked up to Amber who had her eyebrows furrowed and her face was giving a soft frown, she felt so bad for Iris. Amber never had to experience leaving people behind, she\u2019s lived in Shady side her whole life.</p><p>\u201cim so sorry iris\u2026hey\u2026I got a idea?\u201d Iris looks up a bit curious and gives a small nod, \u201cMe and my friends and my brother\u2019s friend have a secret hideout\u2026 I\u2019ll think you\u2019ll like it, join us after school?\u201d</p><p>Iris bites her lip, think for a minute, \u201cSure\u201d she says sweetly. Amber smiles and then stops walking \u201chere is our class, now let\u2019s go in and do nothinnnng!!\u201d Iris laughs as she follows the excited blonde into maths.</p><p>~</p><p>\u201cHey guys\u201d Amber says sitting down, she smiles at Iris then nods at the empty seat next to her. Iris sits down to join in, and nobody seems to be bothered, so they all start chatting away occasionally asking Iris questions.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming to the Shady Tree after school with us, Iris?\u201d Jonah asks sitting on the opposite side of her. She seems s bit confused at first before Amber chimes in \u201cYeah, she is. That\u2019s what our hideout is called Iris, the Shady Tree\u201d</p><p>Iris smiled and turns back round to Jonah \u201cSo it\u2019s a tree?\u201d He seems a little offended by the question and sarcasm in Iris\u2019s voice, but he wants to be friendly. \u201cWell two trees that are joined together, there is a gap in the middle and you can co inside the trees. Only we know about it, we even borrowed saws and furniture and we made staries up to the top and seats to sit on, and obviously we feed our squirrel neighbours!\u201d</p><p>Iris gives a giggle \u201cthat\u2019s sounds so cool, is it like a second home to you guys?\u201d Jonah and Amber nod. It sounds like a beautiful place, Iris really can\u2019t wait too see it, but she needs to get through another 2 classes before school ends.</p><p>~</p><p>Iris was putting the last notepad in her locker, it was a pink fluffy one she got for her last birthday, she slided it in and shut the locker. It was last period so now she had to go find Amber, she went walked to the main office and stood for a bit until she showed up.</p><p>\u201cHi\u201d a soft voice called, Amber was walking up to Iris. \u201cSorry I was a bit late, the teacher held me back for throwing rubbers at reed\u201d, Iris just laughs as a response and the two leave to meet the others.</p><p>\u201cSo where is the tree?\u201d </p><p>Amber has a great big smile, like she was imagining the tree in her head \u201cIt\u2019s in the campsite resort, it\u2019s pretty hidden though so not many people go\u201d</p><p>\u201csounds great\u201d</p><p>Iris couldn\u2019t help but keep glancing at Amber while walking to the resort, her eyes where sparkling and she had long lashes. She was wearing the cutest outfit ever with a diamond necklace that was dolphin shaped</p><p>\u201cso\u2026you like dolphins?\u201d</p><p>Amber was a big caught if guard \u201coh\u201d she looks down at her necklace and smiles \u201cyeah, I love them. I\u2019ve never seen one in real life but I\u2019ve studied then since I was 9. There so majestic and interesting, do you like them?\u201d</p><p>Iris nods immediately\"Yes, I lived in the country side but it was only a 10 minute walk from the beach. In the spring and summer the dolphins would come closer to the coast and there was this cliff you could go up and watch all the dolphins from, I also went to Australia for hoilday once and Swam with them\"</p><p>Amber looks jealous \u201cI wish I could swim with them\u201d she says muttering, Iris playfully hits her arm \u201chey, you\u2019ve got a pretty cool sounding tree. I should be the jealous once here\u201d Amber cracks a little laugh, and they finally arrive.</p><p>\u201cOh my-\u201d </p><p>Iris is so caught off by the tree, it looked like it was in a fairy tale and someone just ripped out the pages and stuck them here. There was 2 mini waterfalls with glistening blue water streaming down them and landing in a lake with lily pads that connect at the back of the tree. The tree itself was very tall, and had little pink and red roses dotted around the branches along with creamy coloured fairy lights and inside it was a whole new world. It was completely made out of wood, and Jonah had said they stayed here alot, no wonder if was beautiful and the tree was so big everyone had there own area in it.</p><p>\u201cyou like it?\u201d Andi says jumping up from her reading area in the tree, it was covered in red and pink blankets</p><p>\u201cI love it\u201d Iris said, slightly mumbling still taking in the sight</p><p>Amber cane up to Iris and joined her looking around, it really was magnificent, \u201cI\u2019m glad too say, you\u2019ve got alot to learn\u201d she tossed her hand over Iris and Iris looks back with a pleasant smile which brought Amber\u2019s classic crush butterflies back into her stomach.</p><p>(should I make a part 2? Idrk I don\u2019t know if I like the way I hardly put any Ambris moments sksksks sorry)</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>The Tree | Ambris Oneshot</h1><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to say, you have alot to learn&rdquo;</p><p>~</p><p>It was a Monday Morning, the sunlight was shining through Iris&rsquo;s teal curtains as she started to wake up. Iris didn&rsquo;t really need an alarm clock, she had her dog to wake her up by licking her in the face, and when that didn&rsquo;t happen the sun was to bright for her to stand anyway so it would make her instantly awake. She yawns and stretches out her arms, then a frown comes to her face. She isn&rsquo;t in <i>her</i> bedroom, she&rsquo;s in her new house in a random room filled with cardboard boxes. This was her first night at the house and honestly, she slept like a baby, but it wasn&rsquo;t the most homely sight to wake up to. She groans and she kicks her covers off and chucks her clothes on. She puts on her bracelet then go head downstaries to get a nibble to eat.</p><p>-</p><p>&ldquo;ambeeRRR TURN THE ALARM OFF&rdquo;</p><p>Amber wakes up to her twin brother,TJ, screaming at her. This is her daily routine. Wake up, regretting agreeing to share a room with TJ, brush her teeth but a unnecessarily loud electric toothbrush, get dressed, eat and leave her house for school. Simple but sweet she likes to describe it as. But today she is happy while getting ready, because after school her and her group of friends are having a big sleepover at Marty&rsquo;s. But she doesn&rsquo;t have long to think about it because before she knows it she needs to pack everything in her rucksack then start cycling to school.</p><p>~</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Wandi!&rdquo;</p><p>Amber walks up to her 2 of her dating bestfriends in the middle of the cafeteria. Although she loved them she knew she was just really a third wheel, but thankfully they didn&rsquo;t flirt all the time and they included and cared for her like she was there child.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Ambs!&rdquo; Walker says &ldquo;bro hugging&rdquo; her, this was his classic greeting.</p><p>&ldquo;So, how did you guy&rsquo;s audition go?
