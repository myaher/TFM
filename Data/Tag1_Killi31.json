The longest wall was filled with floor to ceiling windows, giving a grand view of the city. A few windows outside remained lit even with the ungodly hour, but mostly it was dark, just enough to a see a few stars.</p><p>They\u2019d had sex on a rooftop once. That had been quite enjoyable - dangerous, exhilarating, beautiful, freeing. This was better; this was like touching the stars.</p><p>Villanelle rolled off of Eve and onto her feet, grabbing Eve\u2019s wrist to pull her up along with her. She dropped it when they reached the foot of the bed, whirling to face her, excitement coloring every inch of expression.</p><p>\u201cNow, Eve&hellip;Show me I was right to bring you here.\u201d</p><p>Eve blinked once and then instinct took over. She ran her nails down Villanelle\u2019s sides as she dropped to her knees. Not very hard, just the faintest of scratches that would fade well before they were finished. Villanelle\u2019s flowing black pants were secured only with a tie at the waist, a simple tug and they fell down around her ankles.</p><p>Eve hooked her finger around the band of Villanelle\u2019s panties. Lace, delicate. With a sharp and sudden movement, she tore a finger through the fabric and dragged it down between Villanelle\u2019s legs, splitting the lace in half. Her fingers barely brushed the soft skin just under the fabric, but they came away wet all the same.</p><p>Villanelle made a face. \u201cThose were expensive, Eve.\u201d</p><p>Eve tilted her head up to look at Villanelle and placed her hands on the other woman\u2019s thighs, a somewhat nasty smile starting to take over as she dug her fingers in. \u201cToo bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better make it worth my while.\u201d</p><p>Without warning, Eve pulled her hand from Villanelle\u2019s thigh and thrust two fingers into her, hard and fast. She was wet, so wet; she must have been thinking about this moment for quite a while. Not that Eve could judge.</p><p>Villanelle gasped and her knees sagged for a moment before she regained her composure. Eve grinned with satisfaction. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Villanelle sucked in a deep shaking breath and when she looked down this time, Eve could see how wide her pupils had gone in just a few seconds. She bent her fingers slightly and thrust them in again. For just a moment, Villanelle\u2019s eyes rolled back into her head.</p><p>Eve gave a couple more good thrusts before holding pressure directly on the spot that made Villanelle sigh the most. Then, she leaned in to add her tongue, one long slow stroke across Villanelle\u2019s clit. Then another. Then a slow circle.</p><p>At some point Villanelle couldn\u2019t take it anymore and her knees gave out for good. Eve leaned forward in time to slip her free arm around Villanelle\u2019s waist to catch her and ease her back onto the bed. All the while she still managed to keep her fingertips bent just so, in just the way that made Villanelle\u2019s closed eyelids flutter.</p><p>She crawled up onto the bed with Villanelle, kneeling over her, hand still between her legs, but pausing to gaze at her face.</p><p>\u201cEve\u2026\u201d Villanelle whined. Her name, in Villanelle\u2019s mouth, in that gasping, desperate tone&hellip;it did things to Eve and a small moan escaped her own lips in response to the building pressure between her thighs.</p><p>Eve began again, more forceful this time, adding a third finger when two were no longer enough. Villanelle\u2019s back arched, her hips bucked. Her body begged for more, but she refrained from any more verbal pleas. She didn\u2019t need really need to beg though; Eve was taking very good care of her as it was.</p><p>Villanelle\u2019s eyes flashed open just before she came, hand flying up to grab Eve\u2019s upper arm. Her nails dug in harder and harder as her breath quickened in time with Eve\u2019s fingers. Then all at once she relaxed, breath released, every muscle giving in at once. Her head and arm fell back to the bed, eyes drifted closed again.</p><p>\u201cEve\u2026\u201d she said, again. Softer this time, like honey and history. It soothed and strangled all at once.</p><p>Villanelle seemed to come to fairly quickly. Eve never looked away from her face and when Villanelle opened her eyes, she smiled at the watchful stare. She ran a finger across Eve\u2019s lips and pressed her hands lightly up against Eve\u2019s chest.</p><p>They just stared at each other for a while and the connection there; Eve had forgotten how that felt. Or maybe she\u2019d just forced herself to put it out of her mind because it was so painful to be without it. There was nothing else like it. No one else had ever brought it.</p><p>Eve sat back slightly, no longer leaning forward on her hands; Villanelle\u2019s hands still rested lightly on Eve\u2019s chest, watching her contendely. Then Eve surprised them both.</p><p>She took one of Villanelle\u2019s hands and placed it lightly on her own throat; then she wrapped her own fingers around Villanelle\u2019s. Villanelle\u2019s breathing immediately quickened but she made no movement or protest.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s going to break?\u201d Eve whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d Villanelle said, the sheer delight of competition present in her every word.</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>They clenched their hands in the same moment, never breaking eye contact. Eve felt it immediately; the rush of endorphins, the somehow simultaneous feeling of panic and incredible calm. The whole world was reduced the small area in the very center of her vision - Villanelle. Villanelle\u2019s eyes piercing straight into hers, growing wider with each fraction of a second. Her nostrils flaring. Her lips starting to tremble. Her cheeks growing pale.</p><p>Then her lips formed a silent word. \u201cApple.\u201d</p><p>Apple. Their old safeword. Eve let go and Villanelle\u2019s fingers relaxed as well. Her head turned toward the side and her eyes drifted closed, chest rising and falling with heavy breaths. Eve dropped down next to her, their breath falling into synch.</p><p>Eve wrested a hand lightly on Villanelle\u2019s stomach and moved in close enough to press a light kiss on her neck, just below her ear. \u201cGood?\u201d</p><p>Villanelle smiled, eyes still closed, and reached a hand up to wind through Eve\u2019s hair. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>They stayed like that for a while, nothing but the sound of their breathing returning to normal. Eventually, Villanelle broke the silence, \u201cFine. You\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did get stronger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like it when I fight back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. I still prefer to win, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure about that, love. You just don\u2019t like to admit it.\u201d</p><p>Eve froze. Love. She shouldn&rsquo;t have said that. Even if it was nothing more than a casual pet name, she shouldn\u2019t have said it. Villanelle didn\u2019t seem to notice though, her lazy smile entirely unchanged.</p><p>\u201cYou like it when I win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on the game.\u201d</p><p>That seemed to entertain Villanelle and laughter trickled into her response, \u201cYou like all my games.\u201d Eve didn\u2019t respond, just gave a sort half nod of her head. Villanelle rolled over, half on top of Eve, face inches away from hers, the mischievous glint in her eye setting the tone for her next question, \u201cWhich is your favorite game? What did you miss the most?\u201d</p><p>Eve contemplated, unable to tear herself from Villanelle\u2019s gaze. She knew the answer, that was easy; saying it was another matter entirely. The night was already unreal, though. It didn\u2019t matter anymore.</p><p>\u201cYou know I was always a fan of your knives. From the very first time you pulled one on me.\u201d</p><p>Villanelle leaned in and whispered in Eve\u2019s ear, \u201cThat was always my favorite game too.\u201d</p><p>She was so close that Eve could feel every breath on her own lips and Villanelle\u2019s pupils alone took up most of the center of Eve\u2019s vision.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered. Their lips brushed as she spoke.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can play. I assume you brought something fun and sharp.\u201d</p><p>Villanelle\u2019s eyes widened in surprise. \u201cAlways. But you really-\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s play, Villanelle.\u201d</p><p>Delight and excitement spread over Villanelle\u2019s face in an instant and she leapt up from the bed. Eve continued to lay there, staring at the ceiling. She expected her thoughts to start swarming her in the moments Villanelle was gone rummaging through a bag, but they didn\u2019t. Her mind was blank save for one word: Villanelle.</p><p>Villanelle returned to the bed and straddled Eve, one hand held behind her back. She surveyed Eve for several long moments, the tension building and the silence deafening. Then in a quick flash she pulled the knife out from behind her back and twirled it between her fingers. It was on the smaller end, but Villanelle liked that for this kind of thing. She always used to say it was better for delicate work.</p><p>The knife suddenly stopped spinning and Villanelle was frozen motionless above Eve, staring at her intently. Eve was breathing was coming faster the longer she waited, but Villanelle seemed to be the picture of calm. Then, without warning, she moved in a single swift movement and pressed the tip of the knife ever so lightly against the beginning of the V-shaped scar on Eve\u2019s left breast. \u201cCan I?\u201d</p><p>Eve\u2019s eyes were wide, her breathing shallow. She could hear sound of her blood rushing in her ears. She nodded and placed her hands on Villanelles legs for security.</p><p>\u201cI need you to actually say yes, Eve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The word spilled out quickly, easily, desperately. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Villanelle\u2019s smile was wide, beyond delighted. \u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>And then the knife dug in.</p><p>The endorphin rush was different than the choking. The choking was slower, gradual, building. It had a strange almost calmness about it.</p><p>There was nothing calm about the knife. The first cut made Eve\u2019s vision go white. The only sensations she could feel were the ringing in her ears, the sharp pain in her breast, and the very tips of her fingers digging into Villanelle. Was the knife still there or was it just the wound? She couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>\u201cBreathe.\u201d She could hear Villanelle\u2019s voice through the ringing. She sucked in a breath through her nose and the air burned her nostrils. Letting it out was hard; her chest felt tight. \u201cBreathe.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes. The room was suddenly very bright but Villanelle\u2019s face above her was clear through the light. It grounded her, her careful gaze was watching Eve\u2019s every move.</p><p>\u201cAgain,\u201d Eve said, the word tumbling out amongst her next breath.</p><p>Villanelle looked very satisfied, sort of proud, and nodded approvingly. The next cut wasn\u2019t as overwhelming as the first. It didn\u2019t flood Eve\u2019s mind as much and she was able to keep her eyes open, able to watch Villanelle\u2019s face as she carefully surveyed her work.</p><p>The second one brought the pleasure. The warm swirling feeling in the pit of her stomach, the tingling feeling across the skin of her entire body. Every nerve ending was on fire. She was hyperaware of every place Villanelle was touching her - the other woman\u2019s hand resting lightly on her ribcage, Villanelle\u2019s weight settled on Eve\u2019s hips, her own fingers still clenched tight to Villanelle\u2019s legs. The pain was there, of course, sharp and bright, but it felt good. It lit Eve\u2019s brain on fire.</p><p>\u201cEve,\u201d Villanelle\u2019s voice brought Eve\u2019s focus back to the world around her. \u201cEve, love. Finished or do you want it deeper?\u201d</p><p>Love. \u201cI want it deeper.\u201d</p><p>Villanelle grinner. \u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>Two more slices, quick and efficient. Eve let her head drop back and the feeling wash over her. With closed eyes, she felt Villanelle move off of her and she reached out a hand to feel for her. She heard the sound of the knife being set down on a bedside table and then Villanelle\u2019s hand was in hers. She slid back onto the bead next to Eve, pulling Eve against her and tucking Eve\u2019s head under her chin.</p><p>Eve\u2019s eyes drifted back open and she looked down at the the lines of blood on her breast. Droplets were starting to trickle off of them, growing larger and heavier at they flowed. Villanelle wrapped an arm around Eve\u2019s waist to pull her tighter against her. With her other hand, she lightly dragged a finger through the blood, spreading it in streaks across Eve\u2019s chest and along her collarbone.</p><p>\u201cPretty,\u201d she commented, then lifted a blood stained finger and placed it in her mouth. She sucked on it briefly then pulled her finger back out with a slight popping sound and twined her fingers back through Eve\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019re still wearing pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did that happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should rectify that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry you don\u2019t have to do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did good, you deserve a reward. Lie back, relax.\u201d</p><p>Villanelle gently shifted Eve off of her and back onto the bed. Her fingers quickly found the the button on Eve\u2019s trouser\u2019s and undid it before slipping her hands into them to cup Eve\u2019s ass. Eve hummed in contentment. Villanelle pulled her pants down in a single movement. Freed from the fabric, Eve relaxed, letting her knees drop to the sides.</p><p>Villanelle took advantage of that, kneeling between Eve\u2019s legs and running her hands up Eve\u2019s bare thighs. She ran one finger just under the edge of Eve\u2019s panties and Eve shivered at the contact. Villanelle didn\u2019t prolong the teasing, though; it wouldn\u2019t have had much of an effect, with Eve\u2019s head still spinning through light and clouds and fire.</p><p>Her panties were gone in a flash and then there was Villanelle. Her mouth, her tongue, her breath. Her. Every sensation had begun to blur together - the sharp pain in her breast, the feel of the blood dripping down her side, the tingling of her skin. Villanelle\u2019s touch just added to the symphony. Every stroke of her tongue sent shockwaves through Eve\u2019s body.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long - or maybe it did, Eve really had no sense of time. She\u2019d been practically riding the edge since she\u2019d set foot in Villanelle\u2019s suite, maybe from the moment she\u2019d heard Villanelle\u2019s ringtone, if she was truly honest with herself. She\u2019d almost come when the knife first sliced into her chest. It wouldn\u2019t have been entirely out of the question; she\u2019d done it once before.</p><p>When she finally came though, it was worth every moment of waiting. Her eyes flew open and she screamed louder than she ever had before. She bucked her hips, but Villanelle grabbed them and pinned her down, holding her in place to continue to receive those perfect, delicate strokes on her clit as her orgasm rose and fell and then rose again.</p><p>It took it\u2019s time, but it did fade and Eve\u2019s body suddenly felt very heavy against the mattress. Villanelle\u2019s tongue slowed to a stop and she lifted her head slightly, at which point Eve realized her fingers were wound so tightly in Villanelle\u2019s hair that the strands were cutting off her circulation. She let out her breath in a heavy sigh and untangled her fingers.</p><p>Villanelle shook out her hair and crawled up to be face to face with Eve. She look delighted, very satisfied and very pleased with herself. Her lips and chin were wet with Eve\u2019s cum and Eve blushed when she noticed it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Villanelle asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing. You just have\u2026\u201d Eve wiped a thumb across Villanelle\u2019s lips.</p><p>Villanelle grinned. \u201cYou taste good.\u201d Eve blushed harder but Villanelle was unflustered. She leaned in and pressed a kiss to Eve\u2019s lips, warm and deep. She didn\u2019t pull away when it was finished, instead remained close enough that their lips brushed when she spoke. \u201cSee, you taste good.\u201d</p><p>She began planting little kisses down the side of Eve\u2019s neck. Eve watched her and then her breast caught her eye. The pain had faded to a dull throb but the blood was a mess. Some of it had started to dry but plenty had dripped down onto the pristine white sheets where it had been smeared around in dramatic streaks.</p><p>\u201cWe stained the bed, Villanelle.\u201d</p><p>Villanelle shrugged, pressing a kiss to the center of Eve\u2019s chest. \u201cThey can buy new sheets. I\u2019m sure this place is used to it.\u201d She sat back and looked at Eve. \u201cI will get you cleaned up though.\u201d</p><p>Eve tugged at her arm. \u201cLater, I\u2019m fine. Just lay down with me.\u201d</p><p>Villanelle settled down next to Eve, wrapping both arms around her and tucking her face into the crook of Eve\u2019s neck. Eve settled back against her, laying her arms on top of Villanelle\u2019s where they crossed over her stomach and twining their fingers together. Eve\u2019s eyes began to drift closed, the sound of Villanelle\u2019s steady breathing and her familiar smell putting her at ease.</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t have been so easy to come back together. The passage of time should have meant more. Things should have changed. But it was Villanelle. It was always Villanelle.</p>",

The longest wall was filled with floor to ceiling windows, giving a grand view of the city. A few windows outside remained lit even with the ungodly hour, but mostly it was dark, just enough to a see a few stars.</p><p>They\u2019d had sex on a rooftop once. That had been quite enjoyable - dangerous, exhilarating, beautiful, freeing. This was better; this was like touching the stars.</p><p>Villanelle rolled off of Eve and onto her feet, grabbing Eve\u2019s wrist to pull her up along with her. She dropped it when they reached the foot of the bed, whirling to face her, excitement coloring every inch of expression.</p><p>\u201cNow, Eve\u2026Show me I was right to bring you here.\u201d</p><p>Eve blinked once and then instinct took over. She ran her nails down Villanelle\u2019s sides as she dropped to her knees. Not very hard, just the faintest of scratches that would fade well before they were finished. Villanelle\u2019s flowing black pants were secured only with a tie at the waist, a simple tug and they fell down around her ankles.</p><p>Eve hooked her finger around the band of Villanelle\u2019s panties. Lace, delicate. With a sharp and sudden movement, she tore a finger through the fabric and dragged it down between Villanelle\u2019s legs, splitting the lace in half. Her fingers barely brushed the soft skin just under the fabric, but they came away wet all the same.</p><p>Villanelle made a face. \u201cThose were expensive, Eve.\u201d</p><p>Eve tilted her head up to look at Villanelle and placed her hands on the other woman\u2019s thighs, a somewhat nasty smile starting to take over as she dug her fingers in. \u201cToo bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better make it worth my while.\u201d</p><p>Without warning, Eve pulled her hand from Villanelle\u2019s thigh and thrust two fingers into her, hard and fast. She was wet, so wet; she must have been thinking about this moment for quite a while. Not that Eve could judge.</p><p>Villanelle gasped and her knees sagged for a moment before she regained her composure. Eve grinned with satisfaction. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Villanelle sucked in a deep shaking breath and when she looked down this time, Eve could see how wide her pupils had gone in just a few seconds. She bent her fingers slightly and thrust them in again. For just a moment, Villanelle\u2019s eyes rolled back into her head.</p><p>Eve gave a couple more good thrusts before holding pressure directly on the spot that made Villanelle sigh the most. Then, she leaned in to add her tongue, one long slow stroke across Villanelle\u2019s clit. Then another. Then a slow circle.</p><p>At some point Villanelle couldn\u2019t take it anymore and her knees gave out for good. Eve leaned forward in time to slip her free arm around Villanelle\u2019s waist to catch her and ease her back onto the bed. All the while she still managed to keep her fingertips bent just so, in just the way that made Villanelle\u2019s closed eyelids flutter.</p><p>She crawled up onto the bed with Villanelle, kneeling over her, hand still between her legs, but pausing to gaze at her face.</p><p>\u201cEve\u2026\u201d Villanelle whined. Her name, in Villanelle\u2019s mouth, in that gasping, desperate tone\u2026it did things to Eve and a small moan escaped her own lips in response to the building pressure between her thighs.</p><p>Eve began again, more forceful this time, adding a third finger when two were no longer enough. Villanelle\u2019s back arched, her hips bucked. Her body begged for more, but she refrained from any more verbal pleas. She didn\u2019t need really need to beg though; Eve was taking very good care of her as it was.</p><p>Villanelle\u2019s eyes flashed open just before she came, hand flying up to grab Eve\u2019s upper arm. Her nails dug in harder and harder as her breath quickened in time with Eve\u2019s fingers. Then all at once she relaxed, breath released, every muscle giving in at once. Her head and arm fell back to the bed, eyes drifted closed again.</p><p>\u201cEve\u2026\u201d she said, again. Softer this time, like honey and history. It soothed and strangled all at once.</p><p>Villanelle seemed to come to fairly quickly. Eve never looked away from her face and when Villanelle opened her eyes, she smiled at the watchful stare. She ran a finger across Eve\u2019s lips and pressed her hands lightly up against Eve\u2019s chest.</p><p>They just stared at each other for a while and the connection there; Eve had forgotten how that felt. Or maybe she\u2019d just forced herself to put it out of her mind because it was so painful to be without it. There was nothing else like it. No one else had ever brought it.</p><p>Eve sat back slightly, no longer leaning forward on her hands; Villanelle\u2019s hands still rested lightly on Eve\u2019s chest, watching her contendely. Then Eve surprised them both.</p><p>She took one of Villanelle\u2019s hands and placed it lightly on her own throat; then she wrapped her own fingers around Villanelle\u2019s. Villanelle\u2019s breathing immediately quickened but she made no movement or protest.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s going to break?\u201d Eve whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d Villanelle said, the sheer delight of competition present in her every word.</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>They clenched their hands in the same moment, never breaking eye contact. Eve felt it immediately; the rush of endorphins, the somehow simultaneous feeling of panic and incredible calm. The whole world was reduced the small area in the very center of her vision - Villanelle. Villanelle\u2019s eyes piercing straight into hers, growing wider with each fraction of a second. Her nostrils flaring. Her lips starting to tremble. Her cheeks growing pale.</p><p>Then her lips formed a silent word. \u201cApple.\u201d</p><p>Apple. Their old safeword. Eve let go and Villanelle\u2019s fingers relaxed as well. Her head turned toward the side and her eyes drifted closed, chest rising and falling with heavy breaths. Eve dropped down next to her, their breath falling into synch.</p><p>Eve wrested a hand lightly on Villanelle\u2019s stomach and moved in close enough to press a light kiss on her neck, just below her ear. \u201cGood?\u201d</p><p>Villanelle smiled, eyes still closed, and reached a hand up to wind through Eve\u2019s hair. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>They stayed like that for a while, nothing but the sound of their breathing returning to normal. Eventually, Villanelle broke the silence, \u201cFine. You\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did get stronger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like it when I fight back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. I still prefer to win, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure about that, love. You just don\u2019t like to admit it.\u201d</p><p>Eve froze. Love. She shouldn\u2019t have said that. Even if it was nothing more than a casual pet name, she shouldn\u2019t have said it. Villanelle didn\u2019t seem to notice though, her lazy smile entirely unchanged.</p><p>\u201cYou like it when I win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on the game.\u201d</p><p>That seemed to entertain Villanelle and laughter trickled into her response, \u201cYou like all my games.\u201d Eve didn\u2019t respond, just gave a sort half nod of her head. Villanelle rolled over, half on top of Eve, face inches away from hers, the mischievous glint in her eye setting the tone for her next question, \u201cWhich is your favorite game? What did you miss the most?\u201d</p><p>Eve contemplated, unable to tear herself from Villanelle\u2019s gaze. She knew the answer, that was easy; saying it was another matter entirely. The night was already unreal, though. It didn\u2019t matter anymore.</p><p>\u201cYou know I was always a fan of your knives. From the very first time you pulled one on me.\u201d</p><p>Villanelle leaned in and whispered in Eve\u2019s ear, \u201cThat was always my favorite game too.\u201d</p><p>She was so close that Eve could feel every breath on her own lips and Villanelle\u2019s pupils alone took up most of the center of Eve\u2019s vision.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered. Their lips brushed as she spoke.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can play. I assume you brought something fun and sharp.\u201d</p><p>Villanelle\u2019s eyes widened in surprise. \u201cAlways. But you really-\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s play, Villanelle.\u201d</p><p>Delight and excitement spread over Villanelle\u2019s face in an instant and she leapt up from the bed. Eve continued to lay there, staring at the ceiling. She expected her thoughts to start swarming her in the moments Villanelle was gone rummaging through a bag, but they didn\u2019t. Her mind was blank save for one word: Villanelle.</p><p>Villanelle returned to the bed and straddled Eve, one hand held behind her back. She surveyed Eve for several long moments, the tension building and the silence deafening. Then in a quick flash she pulled the knife out from behind her back and twirled it between her fingers. It was on the smaller end, but Villanelle liked that for this kind of thing. She always used to say it was better for delicate work.</p><p>The knife suddenly stopped spinning and Villanelle was frozen motionless above Eve, staring at her intently. Eve was breathing was coming faster the longer she waited, but Villanelle seemed to be the picture of calm. Then, without warning, she moved in a single swift movement and pressed the tip of the knife ever so lightly against the beginning of the V-shaped scar on Eve\u2019s left breast. \u201cCan I?\u201d</p><p>Eve\u2019s eyes were wide, her breathing shallow. She could hear sound of her blood rushing in her ears. She nodded and placed her hands on Villanelles legs for security.</p><p>\u201cI need you to actually say yes, Eve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The word spilled out quickly, easily, desperately. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Villanelle\u2019s smile was wide, beyond delighted. \u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>And then the knife dug in.</p><p>The endorphin rush was different than the choking. The choking was slower, gradual, building. It had a strange almost calmness about it.</p><p>There was nothing calm about the knife. The first cut made Eve\u2019s vision go white. The only sensations she could feel were the ringing in her ears, the sharp pain in her breast, and the very tips of her fingers digging into Villanelle. Was the knife still there or was it just the wound? She couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>\u201cBreathe.\u201d She could hear Villanelle\u2019s voice through the ringing. She sucked in a breath through her nose and the air burned her nostrils. Letting it out was hard; her chest felt tight. \u201cBreathe.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes. The room was suddenly very bright but Villanelle\u2019s face above her was clear through the light. It grounded her, her careful gaze was watching Eve\u2019s every move.</p><p>\u201cAgain,\u201d Eve said, the word tumbling out amongst her next breath.</p><p>Villanelle looked very satisfied, sort of proud, and nodded approvingly. The next cut wasn\u2019t as overwhelming as the first. It didn\u2019t flood Eve\u2019s mind as much and she was able to keep her eyes open, able to watch Villanelle\u2019s face as she carefully surveyed her work.</p><p>The second one brought the pleasure. The warm swirling feeling in the pit of her stomach, the tingling feeling across the skin of her entire body. Every nerve ending was on fire. She was hyperaware of every place Villanelle was touching her - the other woman\u2019s hand resting lightly on her ribcage, Villanelle\u2019s weight settled on Eve\u2019s hips, her own fingers still clenched tight to Villanelle\u2019s legs. The pain was there, of course, sharp and bright, but it felt good. It lit Eve\u2019s brain on fire.</p><p>\u201cEve,\u201d Villanelle\u2019s voice brought Eve\u2019s focus back to the world around her. \u201cEve, love. Finished or do you want it deeper?\u201d</p><p>Love. \u201cI want it deeper.\u201d</p><p>Villanelle grinner. \u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>Two more slices, quick and efficient. Eve let her head drop back and the feeling wash over her. With closed eyes, she felt Villanelle move off of her and she reached out a hand to feel for her. She heard the sound of the knife being set down on a bedside table and then Villanelle\u2019s hand was in hers. She slid back onto the bead next to Eve, pulling Eve against her and tucking Eve\u2019s head under her chin.</p><p>Eve\u2019s eyes drifted back open and she looked down at the the lines of blood on her breast. Droplets were starting to trickle off of them, growing larger and heavier at they flowed. Villanelle wrapped an arm around Eve\u2019s waist to pull her tighter against her. With her other hand, she lightly dragged a finger through the blood, spreading it in streaks across Eve\u2019s chest and along her collarbone.</p><p>\u201cPretty,\u201d she commented, then lifted a blood stained finger and placed it in her mouth. She sucked on it briefly then pulled her finger back out with a slight popping sound and twined her fingers back through Eve\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019re still wearing pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did that happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should rectify that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry you don\u2019t have to do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did good, you deserve a reward. Lie back, relax.\u201d</p><p>Villanelle gently shifted Eve off of her and back onto the bed. Her fingers quickly found the the button on Eve\u2019s trouser\u2019s and undid it before slipping her hands into them to cup Eve\u2019s ass. Eve hummed in contentment. Villanelle pulled her pants down in a single movement. Freed from the fabric, Eve relaxed, letting her knees drop to the sides.</p><p>Villanelle took advantage of that, kneeling between Eve\u2019s legs and running her hands up Eve\u2019s bare thighs. She ran one finger just under the edge of Eve\u2019s panties and Eve shivered at the contact. Villanelle didn\u2019t prolong the teasing, though; it wouldn\u2019t have had much of an effect, with Eve\u2019s head still spinning through light and clouds and fire.</p><p>Her panties were gone in a flash and then there was Villanelle. Her mouth, her tongue, her breath. Her. Every sensation had begun to blur together - the sharp pain in her breast, the feel of the blood dripping down her side, the tingling of her skin. Villanelle\u2019s touch just added to the symphony. Every stroke of her tongue sent shockwaves through Eve\u2019s body.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long - or maybe it did, Eve really had no sense of time. She\u2019d been practically riding the edge since she\u2019d set foot in Villanelle\u2019s suite, maybe from the moment she\u2019d heard Villanelle\u2019s ringtone, if she was truly honest with herself. She\u2019d almost come when the knife first sliced into her chest. It wouldn\u2019t have been entirely out of the question; she\u2019d done it once before.</p><p>When she finally came though, it was worth every moment of waiting. Her eyes flew open and she screamed louder than she ever had before. She bucked her hips, but Villanelle grabbed them and pinned her down, holding her in place to continue to receive those perfect, delicate strokes on her clit as her orgasm rose and fell and then rose again.</p><p>It took it\u2019s time, but it did fade and Eve\u2019s body suddenly felt very heavy against the mattress. Villanelle\u2019s tongue slowed to a stop and she lifted her head slightly, at which point Eve realized her fingers were wound so tightly in Villanelle\u2019s hair that the strands were cutting off her circulation. She let out her breath in a heavy sigh and untangled her fingers.</p><p>Villanelle shook out her hair and crawled up to be face to face with Eve. She look delighted, very satisfied and very pleased with herself. Her lips and chin were wet with Eve\u2019s cum and Eve blushed when she noticed it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Villanelle asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing. You just have\u2026\u201d Eve wiped a thumb across Villanelle\u2019s lips.</p><p>Villanelle grinned. \u201cYou taste good.\u201d Eve blushed harder but Villanelle was unflustered. She leaned in and pressed a kiss to Eve\u2019s lips, warm and deep. She didn\u2019t pull away when it was finished, instead remained close enough that their lips brushed when she spoke. \u201cSee, you taste good.\u201d</p><p>She began planting little kisses down the side of Eve\u2019s neck. Eve watched her and then her breast caught her eye. The pain had faded to a dull throb but the blood was a mess. Some of it had started to dry but plenty had dripped down onto the pristine white sheets where it had been smeared around in dramatic streaks.</p><p>\u201cWe stained the bed, Villanelle.\u201d</p><p>Villanelle shrugged, pressing a kiss to the center of Eve\u2019s chest. \u201cThey can buy new sheets. I\u2019m sure this place is used to it.\u201d She sat back and looked at Eve. \u201cI will get you cleaned up though.\u201d</p><p>Eve tugged at her arm. \u201cLater, I\u2019m fine. Just lay down with me.\u201d</p><p>Villanelle settled down next to Eve, wrapping both arms around her and tucking her face into the crook of Eve\u2019s neck. Eve settled back against her, laying her arms on top of Villanelle\u2019s where they crossed over her stomach and twining their fingers together. Eve\u2019s eyes began to drift closed, the sound of Villanelle\u2019s steady breathing and her familiar smell putting her at ease.</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t have been so easy to come back together. The passage of time should have meant more. Things should have changed. But it was Villanelle. It was always Villanelle.</p>",

The longest wall was filled with floor to ceiling windows, giving a grand view of the city. A few windows outside remained lit even with the ungodly hour, but mostly it was dark, just enough to a see a few stars.</p><p>They\u2019d had sex on a rooftop once. That had been quite enjoyable - dangerous, exhilarating, beautiful, freeing. This was better; this was like touching the stars.</p><p>Villanelle rolled off of Eve and onto her feet, grabbing Eve\u2019s wrist to pull her up along with her. She dropped it when they reached the foot of the bed, whirling to face her, excitement coloring every inch of expression.</p><p>\u201cNow, Eve\u2026Show me I was right to bring you here.\u201d</p><p>Eve blinked once and then instinct took over. She ran her nails down Villanelle\u2019s sides as she dropped to her knees. Not very hard, just the faintest of scratches that would fade well before they were finished. Villanelle\u2019s flowing black pants were secured only with a tie at the waist, a simple tug and they fell down around her ankles.</p><p>Eve hooked her finger around the band of Villanelle\u2019s panties. Lace, delicate. With a sharp and sudden movement, she tore a finger through the fabric and dragged it down between Villanelle\u2019s legs, splitting the lace in half. Her fingers barely brushed the soft skin just under the fabric, but they came away wet all the same.</p><p>Villanelle made a face. \u201cThose were expensive, Eve.\u201d</p><p>Eve tilted her head up to look at Villanelle and placed her hands on the other woman\u2019s thighs, a somewhat nasty smile starting to take over as she dug her fingers in. \u201cToo bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better make it worth my while.\u201d</p><p>Without warning, Eve pulled her hand from Villanelle\u2019s thigh and thrust two fingers into her, hard and fast. She was wet, so wet; she must have been thinking about this moment for quite a while. Not that Eve could judge.</p><p>Villanelle gasped and her knees sagged for a moment before she regained her composure. Eve grinned with satisfaction. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Villanelle sucked in a deep shaking breath and when she looked down this time, Eve could see how wide her pupils had gone in just a few seconds. She bent her fingers slightly and thrust them in again. For just a moment, Villanelle\u2019s eyes rolled back into her head.</p><p>Eve gave a couple more good thrusts before holding pressure directly on the spot that made Villanelle sigh the most. Then, she leaned in to add her tongue, one long slow stroke across Villanelle\u2019s clit. Then another. Then a slow circle.</p><p>At some point Villanelle couldn\u2019t take it anymore and her knees gave out for good. Eve leaned forward in time to slip her free arm around Villanelle\u2019s waist to catch her and ease her back onto the bed. All the while she still managed to keep her fingertips bent just so, in just the way that made Villanelle\u2019s closed eyelids flutter.</p><p>She crawled up onto the bed with Villanelle, kneeling over her, hand still between her legs, but pausing to gaze at her face.</p><p>\u201cEve\u2026\u201d Villanelle whined. Her name, in Villanelle\u2019s mouth, in that gasping, desperate tone\u2026it did things to Eve and a small moan escaped her own lips in response to the building pressure between her thighs.</p><p>Eve began again, more forceful this time, adding a third finger when two were no longer enough. Villanelle\u2019s back arched, her hips bucked. Her body begged for more, but she refrained from any more verbal pleas. She didn\u2019t need really need to beg though; Eve was taking very good care of her as it was.</p><p>Villanelle\u2019s eyes flashed open just before she came, hand flying up to grab Eve\u2019s upper arm. Her nails dug in harder and harder as her breath quickened in time with Eve\u2019s fingers. Then all at once she relaxed, breath released, every muscle giving in at once. Her head and arm fell back to the bed, eyes drifted closed again.</p><p>\u201cEve\u2026\u201d she said, again. Softer this time, like honey and history. It soothed and strangled all at once.</p><p>Villanelle seemed to come to fairly quickly. Eve never looked away from her face and when Villanelle opened her eyes, she smiled at the watchful stare. She ran a finger across Eve\u2019s lips and pressed her hands lightly up against Eve\u2019s chest.</p><p>They just stared at each other for a while and the connection there; Eve had forgotten how that felt. Or maybe she\u2019d just forced herself to put it out of her mind because it was so painful to be without it. There was nothing else like it. No one else had ever brought it.</p><p>Eve sat back slightly, no longer leaning forward on her hands; Villanelle\u2019s hands still rested lightly on Eve\u2019s chest, watching her contendely. Then Eve surprised them both.</p><p>She took one of Villanelle\u2019s hands and placed it lightly on her own throat; then she wrapped her own fingers around Villanelle\u2019s. Villanelle\u2019s breathing immediately quickened but she made no movement or protest.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s going to break?\u201d Eve whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d Villanelle said, the sheer delight of competition present in her every word.</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>They clenched their hands in the same moment, never breaking eye contact. Eve felt it immediately; the rush of endorphins, the somehow simultaneous feeling of panic and incredible calm. The whole world was reduced the small area in the very center of her vision - Villanelle. Villanelle\u2019s eyes piercing straight into hers, growing wider with each fraction of a second. Her nostrils flaring. Her lips starting to tremble. Her cheeks growing pale.</p><p>Then her lips formed a silent word. \u201cApple.\u201d</p><p>Apple. Their old safeword. Eve let go and Villanelle\u2019s fingers relaxed as well. Her head turned toward the side and her eyes drifted closed, chest rising and falling with heavy breaths. Eve dropped down next to her, their breath falling into synch.</p><p>Eve wrested a hand lightly on Villanelle\u2019s stomach and moved in close enough to press a light kiss on her neck, just below her ear. \u201cGood?\u201d</p><p>Villanelle smiled, eyes still closed, and reached a hand up to wind through Eve\u2019s hair. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>They stayed like that for a while, nothing but the sound of their breathing returning to normal. Eventually, Villanelle broke the silence, \u201cFine. You\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did get stronger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like it when I fight back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. I still prefer to win, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure about that, love. You just don\u2019t like to admit it.\u201d</p><p>Eve froze. Love. She shouldn\u2019t have said that. Even if it was nothing more than a casual pet name, she shouldn\u2019t have said it. Villanelle didn\u2019t seem to notice though, her lazy smile entirely unchanged.</p><p>\u201cYou like it when I win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on the game.\u201d</p><p>That seemed to entertain Villanelle and laughter trickled into her response, \u201cYou like all my games.\u201d Eve didn\u2019t respond, just gave a sort half nod of her head. Villanelle rolled over, half on top of Eve, face inches away from hers, the mischievous glint in her eye setting the tone for her next question, \u201cWhich is your favorite game? What did you miss the most?\u201d</p><p>Eve contemplated, unable to tear herself from Villanelle\u2019s gaze. She knew the answer, that was easy; saying it was another matter entirely. The night was already unreal, though. It didn\u2019t matter anymore.</p><p>\u201cYou know I was always a fan of your knives. From the very first time you pulled one on me.\u201d</p><p>Villanelle leaned in and whispered in Eve\u2019s ear, \u201cThat was always my favorite game too.\u201d</p><p>She was so close that Eve could feel every breath on her own lips and Villanelle\u2019s pupils alone took up most of the center of Eve\u2019s vision.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered. Their lips brushed as she spoke.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can play. I assume you brought something fun and sharp.\u201d</p><p>Villanelle\u2019s eyes widened in surprise. \u201cAlways. But you really-\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s play, Villanelle.\u201d</p><p>Delight and excitement spread over Villanelle\u2019s face in an instant and she leapt up from the bed. Eve continued to lay there, staring at the ceiling. She expected her thoughts to start swarming her in the moments Villanelle was gone rummaging through a bag, but they didn\u2019t. Her mind was blank save for one word: Villanelle.</p><p>Villanelle returned to the bed and straddled Eve, one hand held behind her back. She surveyed Eve for several long moments, the tension building and the silence deafening. Then in a quick flash she pulled the knife out from behind her back and twirled it between her fingers. It was on the smaller end, but Villanelle liked that for this kind of thing. She always used to say it was better for delicate work.</p><p>The knife suddenly stopped spinning and Villanelle was frozen motionless above Eve, staring at her intently. Eve was breathing was coming faster the longer she waited, but Villanelle seemed to be the picture of calm. Then, without warning, she moved in a single swift movement and pressed the tip of the knife ever so lightly against the beginning of the V-shaped scar on Eve\u2019s left breast. \u201cCan I?\u201d</p><p>Eve\u2019s eyes were wide, her breathing shallow. She could hear sound of her blood rushing in her ears. She nodded and placed her hands on Villanelles legs for security.</p><p>\u201cI need you to actually say yes, Eve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The word spilled out quickly, easily, desperately. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Villanelle\u2019s smile was wide, beyond delighted. \u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>And then the knife dug in.</p><p>The endorphin rush was different than the choking. The choking was slower, gradual, building. It had a strange almost calmness about it.</p><p>There was nothing calm about the knife. The first cut made Eve\u2019s vision go white. The only sensations she could feel were the ringing in her ears, the sharp pain in her breast, and the very tips of her fingers digging into Villanelle. Was the knife still there or was it just the wound? She couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>\u201cBreathe.\u201d She could hear Villanelle\u2019s voice through the ringing. She sucked in a breath through her nose and the air burned her nostrils. Letting it out was hard; her chest felt tight. \u201cBreathe.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes. The room was suddenly very bright but Villanelle\u2019s face above her was clear through the light. It grounded her, her careful gaze was watching Eve\u2019s every move.</p><p>\u201cAgain,\u201d Eve said, the word tumbling out amongst her next breath.</p><p>Villanelle looked very satisfied, sort of proud, and nodded approvingly. The next cut wasn\u2019t as overwhelming as the first. It didn\u2019t flood Eve\u2019s mind as much and she was able to keep her eyes open, able to watch Villanelle\u2019s face as she carefully surveyed her work.</p><p>The second one brought the pleasure. The warm swirling feeling in the pit of her stomach, the tingling feeling across the skin of her entire body. Every nerve ending was on fire. She was hyperaware of every place Villanelle was touching her - the other woman\u2019s hand resting lightly on her ribcage, Villanelle\u2019s weight settled on Eve\u2019s hips, her own fingers still clenched tight to Villanelle\u2019s legs. The pain was there, of course, sharp and bright, but it felt good. It lit Eve\u2019s brain on fire.</p><p>\u201cEve,\u201d Villanelle\u2019s voice brought Eve\u2019s focus back to the world around her. \u201cEve, love. Finished or do you want it deeper?\u201d</p><p>Love. \u201cI want it deeper.\u201d</p><p>Villanelle grinner. \u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>Two more slices, quick and efficient. Eve let her head drop back and the feeling wash over her. With closed eyes, she felt Villanelle move off of her and she reached out a hand to feel for her. She heard the sound of the knife being set down on a bedside table and then Villanelle\u2019s hand was in hers. She slid back onto the bead next to Eve, pulling Eve against her and tucking Eve\u2019s head under her chin.</p><p>Eve\u2019s eyes drifted back open and she looked down at the the lines of blood on her breast. Droplets were starting to trickle off of them, growing larger and heavier at they flowed. Villanelle wrapped an arm around Eve\u2019s waist to pull her tighter against her. With her other hand, she lightly dragged a finger through the blood, spreading it in streaks across Eve\u2019s chest and along her collarbone.</p><p>\u201cPretty,\u201d she commented, then lifted a blood stained finger and placed it in her mouth. She sucked on it briefly then pulled her finger back out with a slight popping sound and twined her fingers back through Eve\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019re still wearing pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did that happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should rectify that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry you don\u2019t have to do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did good, you deserve a reward. Lie back, relax.\u201d</p><p>Villanelle gently shifted Eve off of her and back onto the bed. Her fingers quickly found the the button on Eve\u2019s trouser\u2019s and undid it before slipping her hands into them to cup Eve\u2019s ass. Eve hummed in contentment. Villanelle pulled her pants down in a single movement. Freed from the fabric, Eve relaxed, letting her knees drop to the sides.</p><p>Villanelle took advantage of that, kneeling between Eve\u2019s legs and running her hands up Eve\u2019s bare thighs. She ran one finger just under the edge of Eve\u2019s panties and Eve shivered at the contact. Villanelle didn\u2019t prolong the teasing, though; it wouldn\u2019t have had much of an effect, with Eve\u2019s head still spinning through light and clouds and fire.</p><p>Her panties were gone in a flash and then there was Villanelle. Her mouth, her tongue, her breath. Her. Every sensation had begun to blur together - the sharp pain in her breast, the feel of the blood dripping down her side, the tingling of her skin. Villanelle\u2019s touch just added to the symphony. Every stroke of her tongue sent shockwaves through Eve\u2019s body.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long - or maybe it did, Eve really had no sense of time. She\u2019d been practically riding the edge since she\u2019d set foot in Villanelle\u2019s suite, maybe from the moment she\u2019d heard Villanelle\u2019s ringtone, if she was truly honest with herself. She\u2019d almost come when the knife first sliced into her chest. It wouldn\u2019t have been entirely out of the question; she\u2019d done it once before.</p><p>When she finally came though, it was worth every moment of waiting. Her eyes flew open and she screamed louder than she ever had before. She bucked her hips, but Villanelle grabbed them and pinned her down, holding her in place to continue to receive those perfect, delicate strokes on her clit as her orgasm rose and fell and then rose again.</p><p>It took it\u2019s time, but it did fade and Eve\u2019s body suddenly felt very heavy against the mattress. Villanelle\u2019s tongue slowed to a stop and she lifted her head slightly, at which point Eve realized her fingers were wound so tightly in Villanelle\u2019s hair that the strands were cutting off her circulation. She let out her breath in a heavy sigh and untangled her fingers.</p><p>Villanelle shook out her hair and crawled up to be face to face with Eve. She look delighted, very satisfied and very pleased with herself. Her lips and chin were wet with Eve\u2019s cum and Eve blushed when she noticed it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Villanelle asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing. You just have\u2026\u201d Eve wiped a thumb across Villanelle\u2019s lips.</p><p>Villanelle grinned. \u201cYou taste good.\u201d Eve blushed harder but Villanelle was unflustered. She leaned in and pressed a kiss to Eve\u2019s lips, warm and deep. She didn\u2019t pull away when it was finished, instead remained close enough that their lips brushed when she spoke. \u201cSee, you taste good.\u201d</p><p>She began planting little kisses down the side of Eve\u2019s neck. Eve watched her and then her breast caught her eye. The pain had faded to a dull throb but the blood was a mess. Some of it had started to dry but plenty had dripped down onto the pristine white sheets where it had been smeared around in dramatic streaks.</p><p>\u201cWe stained the bed, Villanelle.\u201d</p><p>Villanelle shrugged, pressing a kiss to the center of Eve\u2019s chest. \u201cThey can buy new sheets. I\u2019m sure this place is used to it.\u201d She sat back and looked at Eve. \u201cI will get you cleaned up though.\u201d</p><p>Eve tugged at her arm. \u201cLater, I\u2019m fine. Just lay down with me.\u201d</p><p>Villanelle settled down next to Eve, wrapping both arms around her and tucking her face into the crook of Eve\u2019s neck. Eve settled back against her, laying her arms on top of Villanelle\u2019s where they crossed over her stomach and twining their fingers together. Eve\u2019s eyes began to drift closed, the sound of Villanelle\u2019s steady breathing and her familiar smell putting her at ease.</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t have been so easy to come back together. The passage of time should have meant more. Things should have changed. But it was Villanelle. It was always Villanelle.</p>",

All the while she still managed to keep her fingertips bent just so, in just the way that made Villanelle&rsquo;s closed eyelids flutter.</p><p>She crawled up onto the bed with Villanelle, kneeling over her, hand still between her legs, but pausing to gaze at her face.</p><p>&ldquo;Eve&hellip;&rdquo; Villanelle whined. Her name, in Villanelle&rsquo;s mouth, in that gasping, desperate tone&hellip;it did things to Eve and a small moan escaped her own lips in response to the building pressure between her thighs.</p><p>Eve began again, more forceful this time, adding a third finger when two were no longer enough. Villanelle&rsquo;s back arched, her hips bucked. Her body begged for more, but she refrained from any more verbal pleas. She didn&rsquo;t need really need to beg though; Eve was taking very good care of her as it was.</p><p>Villanelle&rsquo;s eyes flashed open just before she came, hand flying up to grab Eve&rsquo;s upper arm. Her nails dug in harder and harder as her breath quickened in time with Eve&rsquo;s fingers. Then all at once she relaxed, breath released, every muscle giving in at once. Her head and arm fell back to the bed, eyes drifted closed again.</p><p>&ldquo;Eve&hellip;&rdquo; she said, again. Softer this time, like honey and history. It soothed and strangled all at once.</p><p>Villanelle seemed to come to fairly quickly. Eve never looked away from her face and when Villanelle opened her eyes, she smiled at the watchful stare. She ran a finger across Eve&rsquo;s lips and pressed her hands lightly up against Eve&rsquo;s chest.</p><p>They just stared at each other for a while and the connection there; Eve had forgotten how that felt. Or maybe she&rsquo;d just forced herself to put it out of her mind because it was so painful to be without it. There was nothing else like it. No one else had ever brought it.</p><p>Eve sat back slightly, no longer leaning forward on her hands; Villanelle&rsquo;s hands still rested lightly on Eve&rsquo;s chest, watching her contendely. Then Eve surprised them both.</p><p>She took one of Villanelle&rsquo;s hands and placed it lightly on her own throat; then she wrapped her own fingers around Villanelle&rsquo;s. Villanelle&rsquo;s breathing immediately quickened but she made no movement or protest.</p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going to break?&rdquo; Eve whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;You are,&rdquo; Villanelle said, the sheer delight of competition present in her every word.</p><p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p><p>They clenched their hands in the same moment, never breaking eye contact. Eve felt it immediately; the rush of endorphins, the somehow simultaneous feeling of panic and incredible calm. The whole world was reduced the small area in the very center of her vision - Villanelle. Villanelle&rsquo;s eyes piercing straight into hers, growing wider with each fraction of a second. Her nostrils flaring. Her lips starting to tremble. Her cheeks growing pale.</p><p>Then her lips formed a silent word. &ldquo;Apple.&rdquo;</p><p>Apple. Their old safeword. Eve let go and Villanelle&rsquo;s fingers relaxed as well. Her head turned toward the side and her eyes drifted closed, chest rising and falling with heavy breaths. Eve dropped down next to her, their breath falling into synch.</p><p>Eve wrested a hand lightly on Villanelle&rsquo;s stomach and moved in close enough to press a light kiss on her neck, just below her ear. &ldquo;Good?&rdquo;</p><p>Villanelle smiled, eyes still closed, and reached a hand up to wind through Eve&rsquo;s hair. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>They stayed like that for a while, nothing but the sound of their breathing returning to normal. Eventually, Villanelle broke the silence, &ldquo;Fine. You&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;About what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You did get stronger.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Told you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I like it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You like it when I fight back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe. I still prefer to win, though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure about that, love. You just don&rsquo;t like to admit it.&rdquo;</p><p>Eve froze. Love. She shouldn&rsquo;t have said that. Even if it was nothing more than a casual pet name, she shouldn&rsquo;t have said it. Villanelle didn&rsquo;t seem to notice though, her lazy smile entirely unchanged.</p><p>&ldquo;You like it when I win.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Depends on the game.&rdquo;</p><p>That seemed to entertain Villanelle and laughter trickled into her response, &ldquo;You like all my games.&rdquo; Eve didn&rsquo;t respond, just gave a sort half nod of her head. Villanelle rolled over, half on top of Eve, face inches away from hers, the mischievous glint in her eye setting the tone for her next question, &ldquo;Which is your favorite game? What did you miss the most?&rdquo;</p><p>Eve contemplated, unable to tear herself from Villanelle&rsquo;s gaze. She knew the answer, that was easy; saying it was another matter entirely. The night was already unreal, though. It didn&rsquo;t matter anymore.</p><p>&ldquo;You know I was always a fan of your knives. From the very first time you pulled one on me.&rdquo;</p><p>Villanelle leaned in and whispered in Eve&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;That was always my favorite game too.&rdquo;</p><p>She was so close that Eve could feel every breath on her own lips and Villanelle&rsquo;s pupils alone took up most of the center of Eve&rsquo;s vision.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; she whispered. Their lips brushed as she spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We can play. I assume you brought something fun and sharp.&rdquo;</p><p>Villanelle&rsquo;s eyes widened in surprise. &ldquo;Always. But you really-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s play, Villanelle.&rdquo;</p><p>Delight and excitement spread over Villanelle&rsquo;s face in an instant and she leapt up from the bed. Eve continued to lay there, staring at the ceiling. She expected her thoughts to start swarming her in the moments Villanelle was gone rummaging through a bag, but they didn&rsquo;t. Her mind was blank save for one word: Villanelle.</p><p>Villanelle returned to the bed and straddled Eve, one hand held behind her back. She surveyed Eve for several long moments, the tension building and the silence deafening. Then in a quick flash she pulled the knife out from behind her back and twirled it between her fingers. It was on the smaller end, but Villanelle liked that for this kind of thing. She always used to say it was better for delicate work.</p><p>The knife suddenly stopped spinning and Villanelle was frozen motionless above Eve, staring at her intently. Eve was breathing was coming faster the longer she waited, but Villanelle seemed to be the picture of calm. Then, without warning, she moved in a single swift movement and pressed the tip of the knife ever so lightly against the beginning of the V-shaped scar on Eve&rsquo;s left breast. &ldquo;Can I?&rdquo;</p><p>Eve&rsquo;s eyes were wide, her breathing shallow. She could hear sound of her blood rushing in her ears. She nodded and placed her hands on Villanelles legs for security.</p><p>&ldquo;I need you to actually say yes, Eve.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; The word spilled out quickly, easily, desperately. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>Villanelle&rsquo;s smile was wide, beyond delighted. &ldquo;Perfect.&rdquo;</p><p>And then the knife dug in.</p><p>The endorphin rush was different than the choking. The choking was slower, gradual, building. It had a strange almost calmness about it.</p><p>There was nothing calm about the knife. The first cut made Eve&rsquo;s vision go white. The only sensations she could feel were the ringing in her ears, the sharp pain in her breast, and the very tips of her fingers digging into Villanelle. Was the knife still there or was it just the wound? She couldn&rsquo;t tell.</p><p>&ldquo;Breathe.&rdquo; She could hear Villanelle&rsquo;s voice through the ringing. She sucked in a breath through her nose and the air burned her nostrils. Letting it out was hard; her chest felt tight. &ldquo;Breathe.&rdquo;</p><p>She opened her eyes. The room was suddenly very bright but Villanelle&rsquo;s face above her was clear through the light. It grounded her, her careful gaze was watching Eve&rsquo;s every move.</p><p>&ldquo;Again,&rdquo; Eve said, the word tumbling out amongst her next breath.</p><p>Villanelle looked very satisfied, sort of proud, and nodded approvingly. The next cut wasn&rsquo;t as overwhelming as the first. It didn&rsquo;t flood Eve&rsquo;s mind as much and she was able to keep her eyes open, able to watch Villanelle&rsquo;s face as she carefully surveyed her work.</p><p>The second one brought the pleasure. The warm swirling feeling in the pit of her stomach, the tingling feeling across the skin of her entire body. Every nerve ending was on fire. She was hyperaware of every place Villanelle was touching her - the other woman&rsquo;s hand resting lightly on her ribcage, Villanelle&rsquo;s weight settled on Eve&rsquo;s hips, her own fingers still clenched tight to Villanelle&rsquo;s legs. The pain was there, of course, sharp and bright, but it felt good. It lit Eve&rsquo;s brain on fire.</p><p>&ldquo;Eve,&rdquo; Villanelle&rsquo;s voice brought Eve&rsquo;s focus back to the world around her. &ldquo;Eve, love. Finished or do you want it deeper?&rdquo;</p><p>Love. &ldquo;I want it deeper.&rdquo;</p><p>Villanelle grinner. &ldquo;As you wish.&rdquo;</p><p>Two more slices, quick and efficient. Eve let her head drop back and the feeling wash over her. With closed eyes, she felt Villanelle move off of her and she reached out a hand to feel for her. She heard the sound of the knife being set down on a bedside table and then Villanelle&rsquo;s hand was in hers. She slid back onto the bead next to Eve, pulling Eve against her and tucking Eve&rsquo;s head under her chin.</p><p>Eve&rsquo;s eyes drifted back open and she looked down at the the lines of blood on her breast. Droplets were starting to trickle off of them, growing larger and heavier at they flowed. Villanelle wrapped an arm around Eve&rsquo;s waist to pull her tighter against her. With her other hand, she lightly dragged a finger through the blood, spreading it in streaks across Eve&rsquo;s chest and along her collarbone.</p><p>&ldquo;Pretty,&rdquo; she commented, then lifted a blood stained finger and placed it in her mouth. She sucked on it briefly then pulled her finger back out with a slight popping sound and twined her fingers back through Eve&rsquo;s. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re still wearing pants.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose I am.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How did that happen?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mm. I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We should rectify that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry you don&rsquo;t have to do anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You did good, you deserve a reward. Lie back, relax.&rdquo;</p><p>Villanelle gently shifted Eve off of her and back onto the bed. Her fingers quickly found the the button on Eve&rsquo;s trouser&rsquo;s and undid it before slipping her hands into them to cup Eve&rsquo;s ass. Eve hummed in contentment. Villanelle pulled her pants down in a single movement. Freed from the fabric, Eve relaxed, letting her knees drop to the sides.</p><p>Villanelle took advantage of that, kneeling between Eve&rsquo;s legs and running her hands up Eve&rsquo;s bare thighs. She ran one finger just under the edge of Eve&rsquo;s panties and Eve shivered at the contact. Villanelle didn&rsquo;t prolong the teasing, though; it wouldn&rsquo;t have had much of an effect, with Eve&rsquo;s head still spinning through light and clouds and fire.</p><p>Her panties were gone in a flash and then there was Villanelle. Her mouth, her tongue, her breath. Her. Every sensation had begun to blur together - the sharp pain in her breast, the feel of the blood dripping down her side, the tingling of her skin. Villanelle&rsquo;s touch just added to the symphony. Every stroke of her tongue sent shockwaves through Eve&rsquo;s body.</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t take long - or maybe it did, Eve really had no sense of time. She&rsquo;d been practically riding the edge since she&rsquo;d set foot in Villanelle&rsquo;s suite, maybe from the moment she&rsquo;d heard Villanelle&rsquo;s ringtone, if she was truly honest with herself. She&rsquo;d almost come when the knife first sliced into her chest. It wouldn&rsquo;t have been entirely out of the question; she&rsquo;d done it once before.</p><p>When she finally came though, it was worth every moment of waiting. Her eyes flew open and she screamed louder than she ever had before. She bucked her hips, but Villanelle grabbed them and pinned her down, holding her in place to continue to receive those perfect, delicate strokes on her clit as her orgasm rose and fell and then rose again.</p><p>It took it&rsquo;s time, but it did fade and Eve&rsquo;s body suddenly felt very heavy against the mattress. Villanelle&rsquo;s tongue slowed to a stop and she lifted her head slightly, at which point Eve realized her fingers were wound so tightly in Villanelle&rsquo;s hair that the strands were cutting off her circulation. She let out her breath in a heavy sigh and untangled her fingers.</p><p>Villanelle shook out her hair and crawled up to be face to face with Eve. She look delighted, very satisfied and very pleased with herself. Her lips and chin were wet with Eve&rsquo;s cum and Eve blushed when she noticed it.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Villanelle asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing. You just have&hellip;&rdquo; Eve wiped a thumb across Villanelle&rsquo;s lips.</p><p>Villanelle grinned. &ldquo;You taste good.&rdquo; Eve blushed harder but Villanelle was unflustered. She leaned in and pressed a kiss to Eve&rsquo;s lips, warm and deep. She didn&rsquo;t pull away when it was finished, instead remained close enough that their lips brushed when she spoke. &ldquo;See, you taste good.&rdquo;</p><p>She began planting little kisses down the side of Eve&rsquo;s neck. Eve watched her and then her breast caught her eye. The pain had faded to a dull throb but the blood was a mess. Some of it had started to dry but plenty had dripped down onto the pristine white sheets where it had been smeared around in dramatic streaks.</p><p>&ldquo;We stained the bed, Villanelle.&rdquo;</p><p>Villanelle shrugged, pressing a kiss to the center of Eve&rsquo;s chest. &ldquo;They can buy new sheets. I&rsquo;m sure this place is used to it.&rdquo; She sat back and looked at Eve. &ldquo;I will get you cleaned up though.&rdquo;</p><p>Eve tugged at her arm. &ldquo;Later, I&rsquo;m fine. Just lay down with me.&rdquo;</p><p>Villanelle settled down next to Eve, wrapping both arms around her and tucking her face into the crook of Eve&rsquo;s neck. Eve settled back against her, laying her arms on top of Villanelle&rsquo;s where they crossed over her stomach and twining their fingers together. Eve&rsquo;s eyes began to drift closed, the sound of Villanelle&rsquo;s steady breathing and her familiar smell putting her at ease.</p><p>It shouldn&rsquo;t have been so easy to come back together. The passage of time should have meant more. Things should have changed. But it was Villanelle. It was always Villanelle.</p>",

It made me conclude that Phoebe Waller-Bridge really was a lot of the magic of Season 1, where the plotting wasn\u2019t much better, per se, that is everything really did operate as a device to either bring Eve and Villanelle into one another\u2019s orbit and/or keep them apart and was pretty thin (Who are The Twelve? &hellip; doesn\u2019t really matter&hellip;), but I was so continually surprised by character choices and dialogue and reveals that I felt engaged.

Like even the finale left of us almost in the exact position as the finale of Season 1, if mirrored. I didn\u2019t really feel surprised, I felt&hellip; <i>oh</i>. Like, oddly, I\u2019m not sure we advanced or even regressed beyond anything that happened in Season 1? It should feel different, but, weirdly, it felt like the status quo was maintained.\u00a0</p><p>(I think, too, if Gentleman Jack hadn\u2019t been airing concurrently, I would have wondered if maybe it was just apathy getting to me, but I have been so hyped for Gentleman Jack week-to-week that I know this is about the show\u2019s ability to engage me rather than me being in a place where I cannot be engaged. I also think the misfortune[?] of the concurrent airing meant that little things in Killing Eve that might have made me squee at another time, like Villanelle being all lovey-dovey touchy-feely, didn\u2019t land with me because Gentleman Jack is taking that attention to intimacy and hyperawareness of characters\u2019 relationship dynamics and relational positioning to one another to a whole different level of me screaming in my head. This is a case of \u201cdifferent strokes for different folks\u201d [and also the leads caressing and kissing&hellip; a lot] and my preferences are definitely on the side of GJ at the moment.)</p><p>I think Season 2 also decided to stop delving into the characters in terms of peeling back more layers. Like there\u2019s a moment in 2x08 where Konstantin makes a remark about\u00a0\u201cmost\u201d of Villanelle\u2019s family being dead and I was like: \u201cOh, you\u2019re gonna drop that now after spending a whole season deciding not to care about Villanelle\u2019s past anymore?\u201d It made me feel like they squandered so much time moving things around without giving us something new. The team up between Eve and Villanelle made me feel the same, like,\u00a0<i>finally, we couldn\u2019t have gotten to this sooner but instead you followed the road map of Season 1 and put it off and put it off? </i>Forcing that to happen sooner might have led to new things&ndash;and allowed us to tie up other things that somehow did not get tied up this season? Like&hellip; Niko&hellip; ?\u00a0</p><p>(The question of Niko was&hellip; drawn out way longer than it should have been with some weird choices. I don\u2019t even know what to think about the whole\u00a0\u201cstay over at Gemma\u2019s\u201d (lol) and then the murder of Gemma and we literally have no idea where that thread has been left hanging&hellip; lol)</p><p>The writing was also really&hellip; on the nose?\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re the same.\u201d\u00a0\u201cAre you sure?\u201d The rest of the episode proceeds to demonstrate the\u00a0\u201care you sure?\u201d part. Which is, I think, the right character beat and choice for Eve, but I kinda feel like the writers didn\u2019t trust the audience this season? I didn\u2019t feel like I needed to delve into any actions because it felt like everything was what it said on the tin (unless I was questioning narrative choices, like, did Eve really have to sleep with Hugo?) and, again, we weren\u2019t unearthing many new facets about the characters\u2019 lives or pasts or whatnot. Thrilled to see Eve use Korean, but that was&hellip; it, in terms of disclosing new facts and also in terms of exploring that facet? I still have no idea how Niko and Eve met!</p><p>By far my favorite thing this season was Carolyn Mertens and Fiona Shaw\u2019s divine performance. *chef\u2019s kiss* I honestly half-expected to hear a gunshot off-screen during Carolyn and Konstantin\u2019s final scene of the season. Cleaning up loose ends, y\u2019know?</p><p>So, yeah, I had a lot of fun watching Killing Eve Season 2 but it wasn\u2019t&hellip; I didn\u2019t find it to be the magical unicorn that Season 1 was. I don\u2019t regret getting a season pass for this season&hellip; but I\u2019m also not sure I feel like I will want to next season, especially knowing that we\u2019re getting yet another new showrunner. What to expect? Who knows! It makes me wary that it might be more of the same, retreading as it were the path that was laid out. But Sophomore Slump seasons are a thing and the show could find a different way forward.</p>",
