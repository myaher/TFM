It is usually a world very similar to his own, but with noticeable changes. The thing that changes the most is Katsuki Bakugo. Sometimes he&rsquo;s a friend, sometimes he&rsquo;s not, and sometimes he&rsquo;s something else entirely.</i></p><p><i>Canon-Divergent story where Midoriya has the uncontrollable ability to travel to parallel universes.

Rather than having his wish come true, he dragged into a mysterious universe, where he meets what&rsquo;s apperantly their alter ego. As if that wasn&rsquo;t already bad enough, his heart is taken and without it, he will die, nor will he be able to return back to his world.

Just as the beat of a butterfly&rsquo;s wings creates a merciless hurricane, one decision can split a universe in two. Left or right, good or evil, wrong or right, villain or hero&hellip; an infinite number of possibilities. And when Midoriya Izuku is suddenly thrown into a parallel universe by a frightened civilian&rsquo;s quirk, he learns exactly how a simple, seemingly insignificant, choice can alter a world drastically.\n\n</i><br /></p><p>[Mature - 6/?

The rule was that everyone had to bring some kind of food or game.</p><p>Mina decided to be extra and bring something that was both a food AND a game.</p><p>She and some of the girls had disappeared into the kitchen at the start of the party, busy preparing for the biggest spectacle of the entire night. They were making an entire bulk pack of extremely spicy ramen, with the addition of some of Mina&rsquo;s &ldquo;additives&rdquo; to make it as unbearable as possible (Jalape&ntilde;os, black pepper, etc.)</p><p>When it was all ready, she gathered everyone around the community table.</p><p>&ldquo;THIS is going to officially decide which of you boys is the strongest!&rdquo;</p><p>The boys were looking around at each other anxiously. If it was something Mina had planned, it could quite possibly kill somebody. Or all of them.</p><p>She unveiled the boiling pot of despair. The smell was enough to make even the toughest of men&rsquo;s eyes water. About half of the competitors backed out immediately.</p><p>&ldquo;Whoever wins gets this homework pass I stole from Aizawa&rsquo;s desk!&rdquo;</p><p>Okay, they&rsquo;re in.</p><p>Each of the boys were served up a bowl and at Mina&rsquo;s signal, began their race to finish. Aoyama took a bite and tried to hide the pain on his face, but his wavering smile wasn&rsquo;t fooling anybody. He clutched his stomach and ran out.</p><p>Iida, after declaring his vexation for the stupidity of the contest, reluctantly took in a forkful. He sat back in his chair with his arms crossed. However, the food sat in his mouth, remaining uneaten as his face reddended.</p><p>Ojiro took one look at the bowl and became worried for his health, so he pushed it away from him before the fumes killed every cell in his body.
