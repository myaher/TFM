        "body": "<p>So, this isn\u2019t something I have seen so much being said on tumblr, but I <i>have</i> seen it said other places, most specifically when it comes to Jon and Daenerys\u2019 relationship, and it\u2019s this:\u00a0\u201cGeorge R. R. Martin doesn\u2019t do romance!\u201d</p><p>And when I see it said, I always do a\u00a0\u201cwhat?\u201d double take. Because it\u2019s clear people who say or think this don\u2019t know of GRRMs writing credits outside of ASOIAF/GOT. More specifically, one credit in particular: the television show <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> which aired on CBS from 1987-1990. He was not only one of the main writers for the show, (penning 14 episodes out of the total 46 of the show\u2019s run, the third most of any of the writers for the show), but was also one of the supervising producers of the show as well. And at the time, and even after it short run was over, it was considered to be one of the most romantic shows ever produced for television.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"825\" data-orig-height=\"464\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d1dfcd7bca6bb69817f4ff92520bc5f2/tumblr_inline_pl4oxdz9nh1qi5869_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"825\" data-orig-height=\"464\"/></figure><p>I was around 9 or 10 when the show first came on back in the 80s, and was so <i>not</i> into dramatic romance shows. So I never watched it when it was in its original run. It was actually about a year after it ended when I first started watching it (having just entered my early teens). And to this day, almost 30 years later, that show still has not only left an impression on me, but is also still one of the most romantic shows I think has ever been done for television, just as was said about it when it first aired.\u00a0</p><p>The show wasn\u2019t just a romance, it was a <i>High Fantasy</i> Romance. Unlike the reboot on the CW a few years back that had a pretty handsome-looking guy who would\u00a0\u201cbeast\u201d out or whatever, the Vincent of the original looked as he did in the above image from the beginning of the show until the end of it. His physical appearance never changed. And along with his otherworldly looks, he and Catherine shared what could only be described as a mystical connection between them. They could only describe it between them as a\u00a0\u201cbond\u201d but the gist of it was, they could feel each others emotions. They could <i>feel</i> what the other was feeling at almost every moment. Which, on one level, help to add some\u00a0\u201caction\u201d into the show, since Catherine was a lawyer and so would get into life-threatening situations with some of her cases. Vincent could feel when she was in trouble and rushed to save her, usually killing the people that were trying to hurt her, giving in to the more\u00a0\u201canimalistic\u201d side of his nature (though the network kept wanted to reign that fact back).\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>However, the point of their bond was more than just for that. It was to enhance the idea of the theme of the show, the theme of the beauty and the beast tale in general, of being able to see the true beauty inside someone. On the surface, Vincent and Catherine <i>both</i> appeared to be ugly. Whereas Vincent just had the physical ugliness, Catherine actually started out the story as a typical spoiled rich girl \u201cyuppy\u201d type, who\u2019s dad would pay for anything she wanted. She\u2019s mistaken for somebody else one night, brutally beaten and left for dead in Central Park, where Vincent finds her and saves her life.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"357\" data-orig-height=\"272\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a1b2b8bc2773add25266fe312e78b638/tumblr_inline_pl4rq8whWs1qi5869_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"357\" data-orig-height=\"272\"/></figure><p>It is here that their bond begins to form. Vincent, who was always guarded and would hide away from people because of his looks, (except from his \u201cfamily,\u201d a society of people who lived under NYC as well like he did, and were all viewed as outcasts for various reasons), allows himself to begin to feel worthy of being loved. And Catherine, changed not only by her experience but the kindness of Vincent\u2019s heart, starts working at the DA\u2019s office instead of her dad\u2019s law firm, to help people in any way she can.\u00a0<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"474\" data-orig-height=\"358\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b55e31b20afb422f6f2ddb9070012c1b/tumblr_inline_pl4q8hoJBq1qi5869_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"474\" data-orig-height=\"358\"/></figure><p>The show only ran three years because of lots of behind the scenes drama. The main one being, Linda Hamilton wasn\u2019t fully committed to doing a tv show just in general. (Filming tv is much different than filming movies). As George himself says in this interview from the Hollywood Reporter, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/george-r-r-martin-writing-tvs-beauty-beast-was-a-smart-show-986786\">she wanted to go back to doing movies, plus have children</a>. (She and director James Cameron were a couple at the time, and they did have a kid together. Her relationship with him would go on to have a lot of drama in and of itself too). So, when the time came when she could leave the show, she left. Meaning, given the premise of the show,\u00a0Catherine\u2019s character was killed off. The bond between her and Vincent got broken so he couldn\u2019t save her when she got into a situation beyond her control with one of the most powerful men in the city.\u00a0</p><p>However, the reason the bond got broken was revealed to be because the bond got transferred into the child she and Vincent conceived a few weeks back, when Vincent was going through a\u00a0\u201cviolent madness\u201d - basically losing his humanity to his more \u201canimalistic\u201d side. The bond between them is what was able to save him from the madness and, though you never see them make love (which you never did at any point during the show even before this, mostly because the network didn\u2019t seem to want to show such a thing), they did, and conceived a child that night.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"360\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ed98ec34127f3d90b941de2a6a72ee5b/tumblr_inline_pl4rtqfrfN1qi5869_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"360\"/></figure><p>The whole theme of this part of the story became based around the Dylan Thomas poem <i>And Death Shall Have No Dominion</i>. A poem I still know most of by heart because of this show.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>Though they go mad they shall be sane,<br/>Though they sink through the sea they shall rise again; <br/>Though lovers be lost love shall not; <br/>And death shall have no dominion.</i><br/></p></blockquote><p>The final episodes of the show closed out the story, with Vincent able to find Catherine before she died (the man who kidnapped her kept her alive when he discovered she was pregnant, then injected her with an overdose of morphine after she gave birth to her and Vincent\u2019s son). They quoted those above lines from that Dylan Thomas poem to each other as she died in his arms. Vincent was able to find the child later and save him too, with the help of a new\u00a0\u201cbeauty\u201d in Diana Bennett. And while I personally <i>did</i> like her character, the whole premise of the show was the uniqueness of Vincent and <i>Catherine</i>\u2019s bond. There was just no way you could take that and begin to try and transfer it to a new character being placed in the\u00a0\u201cbeauty\u201d role. As George R. R. Martin himself said about it:</p><blockquote><p>Basically I look back on it now and think we were in a no-win situation. I think we did some very fine work in the third season, but the core of the show was the romance. It was Vincent and Catherine. We brought in a new Beauty in the person of Jo Anderson, who was a wonderful actress in the part of Diana Bennett. She was great to work with. But you can\u2019t do two seasons of telling the world, \u201cThis is a love story for the ages, this is <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>,\u201d and then suddenly third seasons say, \u201cJuliet? Forget Juliet. It\u2019s Romeo and Harriet. Here\u2019s a different love story for the ages!\u201d So that didn\u2019t work. When the love story stopped, our core audience left. If Linda had not left the show we could have gone for five years at least.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>So basically once Vincent found his son, the show was over.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"831\" data-orig-height=\"1523\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f9caff10e23b7a86d20b5f4ef8380e56/tumblr_inline_pl4tkxy3CG1qi5869_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"831\" data-orig-height=\"1523\"/></figure><p>And it was his experience with writing for the show, and the limits that came with writing directly for tv that he experienced while doing so, that made him leave tv writing behind and go off and begin writing\u00a0<i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i>. Because with a book, you don\u2019t have to worry about production budgets for creating a world (like the underground NYC world of the show), or actors wanting to leave because they don\u2019t want to do tv anymore, which basically kills your whole show\u2019s premise; or the network not wanting more darkly violent acts for the \u201cbeast\u201d to commit when trying to protect his \u201cbeauty\u201d &hellip; along with never being able to show them having sex, and only confirming that they ever did when a child finally comes into the story but only because said actress now wants to leave the show, and is pregnant at the time in real life anyway.\u00a0</p><p><i>A Song of Ice and Fire,</i>\u00a0and by extension the tv show adapted from it <i>Game of Thrones</i>, isn\u2019t a High Fantasy Romance story. A love story isn\u2019t the main driving narrative of the story. However, the idea that GRRM <i>wouldn\u2019t</i> put a romance in the story, and one that is highly romantic in its nature, seems like a very bad take when it comes to his backstory as a writer. If anything, the love stories and relationships he <i>does</i> write about are ones that are just as unconventional as Vincent and Catherine\u2019s was. They don\u2019t follow the normal tropes of relationships or love stories you usually find in romance stories, even in the genre of high fantasy. GRRM himself said that his favorite part to write in <i>Fire and Blood</i> was the story of King Jaehaerys I Targaryen and Queen Alysanne, which he himself has also called a \u201cgreat romance.\u201d\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DXtwOIhsVx-4\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XtwOIhsVx-4?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure><p>Yet, it was straight up an incestous relationship between a brother and a sister and, in universe, they created and had people preach what more or less was a <i>doctrine of exceptionalism</i> in order to <i>justify</i> the relationship. Yet, their reign was one of the most peaceful periods in Westeros history, lasting over 50 years. And yet, their reign <i>also</i> help to set the stage for the Dance of the Dragons civil war just over two decades later. So even the relationship he called a \u201cgreat romance\u201d has his patented \u201cshades of gray\u201d to it. </p><p>Jon and Daenerys are already unconventional when it comes to romance stories in general, not just high fantasy love stories; and the incest part of it not even being the main thing with regard to that IMO. Their fates are clearly entwined, yet they never meet until what is essentially the final act of the story. Just basic and standard writing tropes would have had Jon and Daenerys meeting in act one of the story, forming a connection. And then, though circumstance, being split apart by the end of the first act, so that they would spend the majority of act two trying to get back to each other. Or with that at least being one of their goals, to reunite, along with whatever other goals they needed to accomplish in act two of the story. However, in ASOIAF/GOT, Jon and Daenerys go on their Joseph Campbell-esque Heroes Journeys separately, completely unaware of the other\u2019s very\u00a0<i>existence\u00a0</i>until the third and final act of the story begins. That\u2019s just not how it\u2019s usually done, and you usually only see third-act romantic hookups in long-running tv shows after you get multiple cast change-overs. But again, this is why GRRM left writing for tv, so he could <i>do</i> unconventional things like this with his story.\u00a0</p><p>So this idea that some people have that George R. R. Martin doesn\u2019t do romance is ridiculous. Not only does he do it, he clearly likes <i>very much</i> to do them in highly romantic ways, ways that make them <i>great</i> romances in his view. He just doesn\u2019t do or write <i>conventional</i> romances. His great romance couples are never written in a conventional mode, or have standard conventional romantic tropes about them. And there is always a shade of gray to them. And Jon and Daenerys are no exception to all of that.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>",

However, the idea that GRRM <i>wouldn\u2019t</i> put a romance in the story, and one that is highly romantic in its nature, seems like a very bad take when it comes to his backstory as a writer.

They don\u2019t follow the normal tropes of relationships or love stories you usually find in romance stories, even in the genre of high fantasy.

Just basic and standard writing tropes would have had Jon and Daenerys meeting in act one of the story, forming a connection. And then, though circumstance, being split apart by the end of the first act, so that they would spend the majority of act two trying to get back to each other. Or with that at least being one of their goals, to reunite, along with whatever other goals they needed to accomplish in act two of the story. However, in ASOIAF/GOT, Jon and Daenerys go on their Joseph Campbell-esque Heroes Journeys separately, completely unaware of the other\u2019s very\u00a0<i>existence\u00a0</i>until the third and final act of the story begins. That\u2019s just not how it\u2019s usually done, and you usually only see third-act romantic hookups in long-running tv shows after you get multiple cast change-overs.

He just doesn\u2019t do or write <i>conventional</i> romances. His great romance couples are never written in a conventional mode, or have standard conventional romantic tropes about them.

R. Martin doesn\u2019t do romance!\u201d</p><p>And when I see it said, I always do a\u00a0\u201cwhat?\u201d double take. Because it\u2019s clear people who say or think this don\u2019t know of GRRMs writing credits outside of ASOIAF/GOT. More specifically, one credit in particular: the television show <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> which aired on CBS from 1987-1990. He was not only one of the main writers for the show, (penning 14 episodes out of the total 46 of the show\u2019s run, the third most of any of the writers for the show), but was also one of the supervising producers of the show as well. And at the time, and even after it short run was over, it was considered to be one of the most romantic shows ever produced for television.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"825\" data-orig-height=\"464\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d1dfcd7bca6bb69817f4ff92520bc5f2/tumblr_inline_pl4oxdz9nh1qi5869_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"825\" data-orig-height=\"464\"></figure><p>I was around 9 or 10 when the show first came on back in the 80s, and was so <i>not</i> into dramatic romance shows. So I never watched it when it was in its original run. It was actually about a year after it ended when I first started watching it (having just entered my early teens). And to this day, almost 30 years later, that show still has not only left an impression on me, but is also still one of the most romantic shows I think has ever been done for television, just as was said about it when it first aired.\u00a0</p><p>The show wasn\u2019t just a romance, it was a <i>High Fantasy</i> Romance. Unlike the reboot on the CW a few years back that had a pretty handsome-looking guy who would\u00a0\u201cbeast\u201d out or whatever, the Vincent of the original looked as he did in the above image from the beginning of the show until the end of it. His physical appearance never changed. And along with his otherworldly looks, he and Catherine shared what could only be described as a mystical connection between them. They could only describe it between them as a\u00a0\u201cbond\u201d but the gist of it was, they could feel each others emotions. They could <i>feel</i> what the other was feeling at almost every moment. Which, on one level, help to add some\u00a0\u201caction\u201d into the show, since Catherine was a lawyer and so would get into life-threatening situations with some of her cases. Vincent could feel when she was in trouble and rushed to save her, usually killing the people that were trying to hurt her, giving in to the more\u00a0\u201canimalistic\u201d side of his nature (though the network kept wanted to reign that fact back).\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>However, the point of their bond was more than just for that. It was to enhance the idea of the theme of the show, the theme of the beauty and the beast tale in general, of being able to see the true beauty inside someone. On the surface, Vincent and Catherine <i>both</i> appeared to be ugly. Whereas Vincent just had the physical ugliness, Catherine actually started out the story as a typical spoiled rich girl \u201cyuppy\u201d type, who\u2019s dad would pay for anything she wanted. She\u2019s mistaken for somebody else one night, brutally beaten and left for dead in Central Park, where Vincent finds her and saves her life.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"357\" data-orig-height=\"272\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a1b2b8bc2773add25266fe312e78b638/tumblr_inline_pl4rq8whWs1qi5869_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"357\" data-orig-height=\"272\"></figure><p>It is here that their bond begins to form. Vincent, who was always guarded and would hide away from people because of his looks, (except from his \u201cfamily,\u201d a society of people who lived under NYC as well like he did, and were all viewed as outcasts for various reasons), allows himself to begin to feel worthy of being loved. And Catherine, changed not only by her experience but the kindness of Vincent\u2019s heart, starts working at the DA\u2019s office instead of her dad\u2019s law firm, to help people in any way she can.\u00a0<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"474\" data-orig-height=\"358\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b55e31b20afb422f6f2ddb9070012c1b/tumblr_inline_pl4q8hoJBq1qi5869_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"474\" data-orig-height=\"358\"></figure><p>The show only ran three years because of lots of behind the scenes drama. The main one being, Linda Hamilton wasn\u2019t fully committed to doing a tv show just in general. (Filming tv is much different than filming movies). As George himself says in this interview from the Hollywood Reporter, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/george-r-r-martin-writing-tvs-beauty-beast-was-a-smart-show-986786\">she wanted to go back to doing movies, plus have children</a>. (She and director James Cameron were a couple at the time, and they did have a kid together. Her relationship with him would go on to have a lot of drama in and of itself too). So, when the time came when she could leave the show, she left. Meaning, given the premise of the show,\u00a0Catherine\u2019s character was killed off. The bond between her and Vincent got broken so he couldn\u2019t save her when she got into a situation beyond her control with one of the most powerful men in the city.\u00a0</p><p>However, the reason the bond got broken was revealed to be because the bond got transferred into the child she and Vincent conceived a few weeks back, when Vincent was going through a\u00a0\u201cviolent madness\u201d - basically losing his humanity to his more \u201canimalistic\u201d side. The bond between them is what was able to save him from the madness and, though you never see them make love (which you never did at any point during the show even before this, mostly because the network didn\u2019t seem to want to show such a thing), they did, and conceived a child that night.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"360\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ed98ec34127f3d90b941de2a6a72ee5b/tumblr_inline_pl4rtqfrfN1qi5869_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"360\"></figure><p>The whole theme of this part of the story became based around the Dylan Thomas poem <i>And Death Shall Have No Dominion</i>.

And to this day, almost 30 years later, that show still has not only left an impression on me, but is also still one of the most romantic shows I think has ever been done for television, just as was said about it when it first aired.&nbsp;</p><p>The show wasn&rsquo;t just a romance, it was a <i>High Fantasy</i> Romance. Unlike the reboot on the CW a few years back that had a pretty handsome-looking guy who would&nbsp;&ldquo;beast&rdquo; out or whatever, the Vincent of the original looked as he did in the above image from the beginning of the show until the end of it. His physical appearance never changed. And along with his otherworldly looks, he and Catherine shared what could only be described as a mystical connection between them. They could only describe it between them as a&nbsp;&ldquo;bond&rdquo; but the gist of it was, they could feel each others emotions. They could <i>feel</i> what the other was feeling at almost every moment. Which, on one level, help to add some&nbsp;&ldquo;action&rdquo; into the show, since Catherine was a lawyer and so would get into life-threatening situations with some of her cases. Vincent could feel when she was in trouble and rushed to save her, usually killing the people that were trying to hurt her, giving in to the more&nbsp;&ldquo;animalistic&rdquo; side of his nature (though the network kept wanted to reign that fact back).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, the point of their bond was more than just for that. It was to enhance the idea of the theme of the show, the theme of the beauty and the beast tale in general, of being able to see the true beauty inside someone. On the surface, Vincent and Catherine <i>both</i> appeared to be ugly. Whereas Vincent just had the physical ugliness, Catherine actually started out the story as a typical spoiled rich girl &ldquo;yuppy&rdquo; type, who&rsquo;s dad would pay for anything she wanted. She&rsquo;s mistaken for somebody else one night, brutally beaten and left for dead in Central Park, where Vincent finds her and saves her life.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a1b2b8bc2773add25266fe312e78b638/tumblr_inline_pl4rq8whWs1qi5869_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>It is here that their bond begins to form. Vincent, who was always guarded and would hide away from people because of his looks, (except from his &ldquo;family,&rdquo; a society of people who lived under NYC as well like he did, and were all viewed as outcasts for various reasons), allows himself to begin to feel worthy of being loved. And Catherine, changed not only by her experience but the kindness of Vincent&rsquo;s heart, starts working at the DA&rsquo;s office instead of her dad&rsquo;s law firm, to help people in any way she can.&nbsp;<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b55e31b20afb422f6f2ddb9070012c1b/tumblr_inline_pl4q8hoJBq1qi5869_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The show only ran three years because of lots of behind the scenes drama. The main one being, Linda Hamilton wasn&rsquo;t fully committed to doing a tv show just in general. (Filming tv is much different than filming movies). As George himself says in this interview from the Hollywood Reporter, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/george-r-r-martin-writing-tvs-beauty-beast-was-a-smart-show-986786\">she wanted to go back to doing movies, plus have children</a>. (She and director James Cameron were a couple at the time, and they did have a kid together. Her relationship with him would go on to have a lot of drama in and of itself too). So, when the time came when she could leave the show, she left. Meaning, given the premise of the show,&nbsp;Catherine&rsquo;s character was killed off. The bond between her and Vincent got broken so he couldn&rsquo;t save her when she got into a situation beyond her control with one of the most powerful men in the city.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the reason the bond got broken was revealed to be because the bond got transferred into the child she and Vincent conceived a few weeks back, when Vincent was going through a&nbsp;&ldquo;violent madness&rdquo; - basically losing his humanity to his more &ldquo;animalistic&rdquo; side. The bond between them is what was able to save him from the madness and, though you never see them make love (which you never did at any point during the show even before this, mostly because the network didn&rsquo;t seem to want to show such a thing), they did, and conceived a child that night.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ed98ec34127f3d90b941de2a6a72ee5b/tumblr_inline_pl4rtqfrfN1qi5869_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The whole theme of this part of the story became based around the Dylan Thomas poem <i>And Death Shall Have No Dominion</i>. A poem I still know most of by heart because of this show.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>Though they go mad they shall be sane,<br />Though they sink through the sea they shall rise again; <br />Though lovers be lost love shall not; <br />And death shall have no dominion.</i><br /></p></blockquote><p>The final episodes of the show closed out the story, with Vincent able to find Catherine before she died (the man who kidnapped her kept her alive when he discovered she was pregnant, then injected her with an overdose of morphine after she gave birth to her and Vincent&rsquo;s son). They quoted those above lines from that Dylan Thomas poem to each other as she died in his arms. Vincent was able to find the child later and save him too, with the help of a new&nbsp;&ldquo;beauty&rdquo; in Diana Bennett. And while I personally <i>did</i> like her character, the whole premise of the show was the uniqueness of Vincent and <i>Catherine</i>&rsquo;s bond. There was just no way you could take that and begin to try and transfer it to a new character being placed in the&nbsp;&ldquo;beauty&rdquo; role. As George R. R. Martin himself said about it:</p><blockquote><p>Basically I look back on it now and think we were in a no-win situation. I think we did some very fine work in the third season, but the core of the show was the romance. It was Vincent and Catherine. We brought in a new Beauty in the person of Jo Anderson, who was a wonderful actress in the part of Diana Bennett. She was great to work with. But you can&rsquo;t do two seasons of telling the world, &ldquo;This is a love story for the ages, this is <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>,&rdquo; and then suddenly third seasons say, &ldquo;Juliet? Forget Juliet. It&rsquo;s Romeo and Harriet. Here&rsquo;s a different love story for the ages!&rdquo; So that didn&rsquo;t work. When the love story stopped, our core audience left. If Linda had not left the show we could have gone for five years at least.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>So basically once Vincent found his son, the show was over.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f9caff10e23b7a86d20b5f4ef8380e56/tumblr_inline_pl4tkxy3CG1qi5869_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>And it was his experience with writing for the show, and the limits that came with writing directly for tv that he experienced while doing so, that made him leave tv writing behind and go off and begin writing&nbsp;<i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i>. Because with a book, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about production budgets for creating a world (like the underground NYC world of the show), or actors wanting to leave because they don&rsquo;t want to do tv anymore, which basically kills your whole show&rsquo;s premise; or the network not wanting more darkly violent acts for the &ldquo;beast&rdquo; to commit when trying to protect his &ldquo;beauty&rdquo; &hellip; along with never being able to show them having sex, and only confirming that they ever did when a child finally comes into the story but only because said actress now wants to leave the show, and is pregnant at the time in real life anyway.&nbsp;</p><p><i>A Song of Ice and Fire,</i>&nbsp;and by extension the tv show adapted from it <i>Game of Thrones</i>, isn&rsquo;t a High Fantasy Romance story. A love story isn&rsquo;t the main driving narrative of the story. However, the idea that GRRM <i>wouldn&rsquo;t</i> put a romance in the story, and one that is highly romantic in its nature, seems like a very bad take when it comes to his backstory as a writer. If anything, the love stories and relationships he <i>does</i> write about are ones that are just as unconventional as Vincent and Catherine&rsquo;s was. They don&rsquo;t follow the normal tropes of relationships or love stories you usually find in romance stories, even in the genre of high fantasy. GRRM himself said that his favorite part to write in <i>Fire and Blood</i> was the story of King Jaehaerys I Targaryen and Queen Alysanne, which he himself has also called a &ldquo;great romance.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\"><p><a href=\"#\"><img src=\"https://assets.tumblr.com/images/inline_placeholder.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"14\"/></a></p></figure><p>Yet, it was straight up an incestous relationship between a brother and a sister and, in universe, they created and had people preach what more or less was a <i>doctrine of exceptionalism</i> in order to <i>justify</i> the relationship. Yet, their reign was one of the most peaceful periods in Westeros history, lasting over 50 years. And yet, their reign <i>also</i> help to set the stage for the Dance of the Dragons civil war just over two decades later. So even the relationship he called a &ldquo;great romance&rdquo; has his patented &ldquo;shades of gray&rdquo; to it. </p><p>Jon and Daenerys are already unconventional when it comes to romance stories in general, not just high fantasy love stories; and the incest part of it not even being the main thing with regard to that IMO. Their fates are clearly entwined, yet they never meet until what is essentially the final act of the story. Just basic and standard writing tropes would have had Jon and Daenerys meeting in act one of the story, forming a connection. And then, though circumstance, being split apart by the end of the first act, so that they would spend the majority of act two trying to get back to each other. Or with that at least being one of their goals, to reunite, along with whatever other goals they needed to accomplish in act two of the story. However, in ASOIAF/GOT, Jon and Daenerys go on their Joseph Campbell-esque Heroes Journeys separately, completely unaware of the other&rsquo;s very&nbsp;<i>existence&nbsp;</i>until the third and final act of the story begins. That&rsquo;s just not how it&rsquo;s usually done, and you usually only see third-act romantic hookups in long-running tv shows after you get multiple cast change-overs. But again, this is why GRRM left writing for tv, so he could <i>do</i> unconventional things like this with his story.&nbsp;</p><p>So this idea that some people have that George R. R. Martin doesn&rsquo;t do romance is ridiculous. Not only does he do it, he clearly likes <i>very much</i> to do them in highly romantic ways, ways that make them <i>great</i> romances in his view. He just doesn&rsquo;t do or write <i>conventional</i> romances. His great romance couples are never written in a conventional mode, or have standard conventional romantic tropes about them. And there is always a shade of gray to them. And Jon and Daenerys are no exception to all of that.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

And by foreshadowing I meant escaping death once again but this time he will become a Stark. (Not a book reader)  At this pt in the books doesn't Robb legitimize Jon.  It seems this is the shows way of mentioning it. So maybe it happens another way?  Hope this makes sense lol.  Thanks again!",

So I have imagined a variety of child creatures with a combination of their parents&rsquo; coloring, but the one thing they have in common is some spectacular hair, because that&rsquo;s how Targs roll. So I have fan cast the Targ babies. And at least one of them will be names Aemon. And there may be more than 4.

        "question": "I love reading your thoughtful posts!  I was wondering if you thought there was any significance in the story Cat told Talisa about Jon being sick and the promise made then broke after he recovered especially since this was not in the books.  Could this be foreshadowing of maybe Sansa being by Jon's bedside after being injured in the upcoming war and what he might become after?  Thank you!",
        "answer": "<p>Hey, nonnie!</p><p>Thank you so much for the kind words! I\u2019m glad you like my posts. I\u2019m certainly having a great time writing them. :)</p><p>Your question is very interesting. I do think there\u2019s room for a foreshadowing interpretation for it but it doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be linked to Sansa taking care of Jon when he\u2019s injured.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTaking care of the injured hero\u201d is a well-established romantic trope, one D&amp;D have already subverted with Jon and D*ny because while he is injured after the wight hunt and she\u2019s sited on his bed when he wakes up, she never actually takes care of him. She also breaches his personal space uninvited, bringing to mind more of a sexual harassment vibe than a romantic, nurturing one. If anything, if Sansa ends up taking care of Jon after he\u2019s injured in the War of the Dawn, I see it as more of a direct foil to how the Jon/D*ny scene was constructed.\u00a0</p><p>Could they also add a bit of Catelyn in there, with Sansa praying for Jon to be saved through the night? Sure. They could do that and my shipping heart would swoon, if they did.\u00a0It would fit with the whole Sansa/Catelyn parallel as well as be a nice way of seeing Sansa embrace the Faith of the Seven again, an aspect that was very important to her and that gave her great strength during the Battle of the Blackwater only for the heartbreak of Robb and Catelyn\u2019s death to strip it from her. It would be a really nice way for her to heal that emotional loss, if that makes sense.\u00a0</p><p>Will they do that? I don\u2019t know \u2026 It really depends on how the narrative develops and also how other aspects pan out. For example, during the actual War of the Dawn, Sansa might be in King\u2019s Landing as Cersei\u2019s hostage, if the kidnapping theory proves true. So, as with any artistic choice, it all depends on what direction the creators want to take. I\u2019ve talked a bit about just how many romantic tropes are sprinkled through out Jonsa scenes so that\u2019s one of the major reasons why I think it\u2019s very plausible to see a Sansa taking care of Jon trope as well.\u00a0</p><p>On another note, I have to say that I know a lot Catelyn fans didn\u2019t like this scene and thought it was an injustice to Catelyn\u2019s character. While I don\u2019t dismiss their feelings on the subject, personally it\u2019s my absolute favorite Catelyn scene (it\u2019s battling the Red Wedding scene really but at the moment, I like it more) and I loved\u00a0\n\nMichelle Fairly\u2019s acting in it. I think it added such an interesting and complex layer to the Cat/Jon dynamic.\u00a0</p><p>Cat is by far the most positive and nurturing mother figure in this story. She is capable of great love and care when it comes to her children which is such an amazing thing to see, particularly in a show where parents disappoint and hurt their children over and over again. Cat never does that with any of the Stark kids: she supports Robb and even understands that she must keep from mothering him once he starts his campaign, she is the only one who constantly thinks about Arya and Sansa and wants to do everything she can to save them, she sits by Bran\u2019s side for days on end, in a state of sheer desperation. She mourns Bran and Rickon when she believes them dead as only a true mother would. And she\u2019s willing to give herself to the Freys to spare Robb\u2019s life.\u00a0</p><p>She\u2019s the perfect mother \u2026 with only one glaring exception: Jon. When it comes to Jon, she completely fails. I\u2019ve always felt that the reason for her animosity towards Jon isn\u2019t just about the Blackfyers and the dangers bastards pose to true born children, but that it\u2019s also a way of getting back at Ned, with the only means available to her.\u00a0</p><p>Despite him being a good man, Ned is still the Lord of Winterfell, the ultimate authority on what goes on in the household and the family and he wasn\u2019t above using that clout to stifle Cat\u2019s understandable anger when he brought Jon home. He never gave her an explanation, he never talked about it and made it clear that it was a subject Cat was not allowed to touch on. That has to be a tremendous blow and being forced to accept it for years on end, I think made Cat that much more bitter. The issue is, of course, that she can\u2019t directly oppose Ned. If Cat wants to have a good, happy life, she must swallow the bitter pill and get along with her husband. There\u2019s an interesting parallel to be drawn here between Cat accepting Ned\u2019s decision and loving him in spite of it and Sansa trying her level best to blame anyone else for the Trident incident except Joffrey.\u00a0</p><p>As Ned, himself, put it:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Joffrey is going to be her husband. She can\u2019t go against him.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Well, he\u2019d know about that, wouldn\u2019t he?\u00a0</p><p>So just like Sansa couldn\u2019t go against Joffrey, Cat can\u2019t really go against Ned. So the only person she can truly take her frustrations out on and punish Ned in the process, is Jon. This is one of the things that really bothers me about the: Catelyn didn\u2019t owe Jon anything argument. It\u2019s a false argument because, in truth, it isn\u2019t about owing Jon something, it\u2019s about being fair. And Cat never is when it comes to him. She hurts and traumatizes him, anyway you want to slice it. It doesn\u2019t make her a monster, of course, but that amount of vitriol directed at you for no fault of your own is bound to haunt you for a long time and that\u2019s certainly the case for Jon.\u00a0</p><p>Which is why I loved that Cat/Talisa scene so much. Because it shows another new, hidden layer to the Cat/Jon dynamic that you wouldn\u2019t have assumed. The tragic truth is that, at least in showCat\u2019s case, she did try to love Jon, she even swore to ask Ned to legalize him and yet, she found that she was simply incapable of doing it. And it\u2019s something that haunts her, something she uses to punish herself now that she thinks two of her children are dead and she\u2019s ashamed that she swore a sacred vow and failed to live up to it. For a person who values duty and honor as much as she does, that\u2019s definitely something that would weigh very heavily. And I found it fascinating, sad and compelling at the same time.\u00a0</p><p>In terms of foreshadowing, I\u2019ll leave you with this:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Cat: Let the boy live!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Talisa: And he lived?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Cat: And he lived.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Not only did Jon survive his childhood fever. He survived death itself. Catelyn must have some really powerful connections among the Seven!\u00a0</p>",

I do think there\u2019s room for a foreshadowing interpretation for it but it doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be linked to Sansa taking care of Jon when he\u2019s injured.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTaking care of the injured hero\u201d is a well-established romantic trope, one D&amp;D have already subverted with Jon and D*ny because while he is injured after the wight hunt and she\u2019s sited on his bed when he wakes up, she never actually takes care of him. She also breaches his personal space uninvited, bringing to mind more of a sexual harassment vibe than a romantic, nurturing one.

It&rsquo;s a false argument because, in truth, it isn&rsquo;t about owing Jon something, it&rsquo;s about being fair. And Cat never is when it comes to him. She hurts and traumatizes him, anyway you want to slice it. It doesn&rsquo;t make her a monster, of course, but that amount of vitriol directed at you for no fault of your own is bound to haunt you for a long time and that&rsquo;s certainly the case for Jon.&nbsp;</p><p>Which is why I loved that Cat/Talisa scene so much. Because it shows another new, hidden layer to the Cat/Jon dynamic that you wouldn&rsquo;t have assumed. The tragic truth is that, at least in showCat&rsquo;s case, she did try to love Jon, she even swore to ask Ned to legalize him and yet, she found that she was simply incapable of doing it. And it&rsquo;s something that haunts her, something she uses to punish herself now that she thinks two of her children are dead and she&rsquo;s ashamed that she swore a sacred vow and failed to live up to it. For a person who values duty and honor as much as she does, that&rsquo;s definitely something that would weigh very heavily. And I found it fascinating, sad and compelling at the same time.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of foreshadowing, I&rsquo;ll leave you with this:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Cat: Let the boy live!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Talisa: And he lived?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Cat: And he lived.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Not only did Jon survive his childhood fever. He survived death itself. Catelyn must have some really powerful connections among the Seven!&nbsp;</p>",
