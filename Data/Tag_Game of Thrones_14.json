There should have been significant times that we saw her struggling with dark impulses, struggling with what she\u2019s doing.

It\u2019s the answer to\u00a0\u201cwell we want Jon to have the throne because this show is male fantasy fulfillment and we\u2019re male, so how to we make Dany not a viable choice for the throne\u201d.

Daenerys is how she craves for the throne, how impulsive she is and is able to destroy everything that stays in her way to get it. That\u2019s why Sansa is worried and angry.

Of course not, Cersei is there because she\u2019s the fucking troll and she\u2019s there because of revenge (i love it btw, she so screwed and rotten person and fucks them all, it has dynamic), Dany is blinded by her ego, birthright (that is now secondary, the first is Jon\u2019s and she can\u2019t suck it up) and she feels invincible due of her dragons, that\u2019s why she has now one from three. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>*clears throat*</p><p>Alright let\u2019s get into this.</p><p>First off\u2026 the fact that they\u2019re really going the whole \u201cMad Queen\u201d route with it is superrr disappointing. I get the whole \u201cooooo Jon is a descendent of both houses so he\u2019s the chosen one\u201d thing\u2026 </p><p>By \u201cI get it\u201d I mean \u201cI\u2019m very sick of the white bread cookie cutter straight boy chosen one\u201d story line. But I digress\u2026 </p><p>I\u2019ve said it since season one, Arya and Sansa are the only ones I\u2019d trust on the throne. But that\u2019s not going to happen. </p><p>From my screenwriting point of view, and as a viewer, I can kind of see where they may be going with it. If Melisandre\u2019s prophecy is true, Arya will be the one to kill Cersei and not Dany. And Arya will not under any circumstance let Dany take the throne, especially with what Dany\u2019s already said and looks like she\u2019s planning, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to end well.  Her bloodlust and vengance is going to be released full force in the next episode or two, which at this point\u2026 Cersei and Dany have each lost babies to this war, you can\u2019t blame either for the way they feel. Dany got handed a shit card from birth and so did Cersei, it made both of them tough. But there\u2019s a point where toughness becomes  callousness and cruelty, Cersei crosses that line regularly but Dany is inching towards it. It\u2019s a catch 22 for either of them, if Dany doesn\u2019t attack, everyone behind her loses faith in her rule. They\u2019re probably already not feeling great after losing another dragon, her allies are getting picked off one by one and she\u2019s ostracizing most of her new ones. If Cersei doesn\u2019t attack, she loses her throne and most likely her life. Both are backed into a corner.</p><p>It could very well be that they end up all destroying each other at the end. I\u2019ve always been a fan of the throne being destroyed so the 7 kingdoms can try to get along together with fair rulers independently. Yara ruling the seas, Sansa in the North, etc. but sadly I think they\u2019re going to plop know nothing snow on the throne.

Like literally WHY is everyone acting like he would automatically be a good ruler, because he&rsquo;s been a good leader for troops in war? Or because he&rsquo;s charismatic as a leader and people are drawn to him? Were these not exactly how young Robert was described too??</p><p>If Jon Snow ends up on the iron throne, Westeros will in time end up the same way it did under Robert&rsquo;s rule, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.</p>",
