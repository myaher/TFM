This year, the excitement was even bigger because Sophie Turner had let slip that Sansa\u2019s would be wearing armour in the final season of the show (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183300013819/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">x</a>).\u00a0However, the promotional photos revealed a costume that isn\u2019t actual armour but more of a warrior look in a symbolic sense, which fits well with another thing Turner said about Sansa\u2019s arc in the last season:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201cWe the idea of it being very protective and she buttons herself up,\u201d Turner says. \u201cI wanted her to have a bit of armor and be a bit more warrior like. <b>She\u2019s like the warrior of Winterfell</b>.\u201d</i> (Sophie Turner, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Few.com%2Ftv%2F2019%2F02%2F20%2Fsophie-turner-sansa-armor-game-thrones-season-8%2F&amp;t=ZWJjMDlhNzgxMGVkZTcyY2M4ZDBiYjY5NjU0ZDliNGYwNDJkNWU1NyxaMGdLU2FadA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183118735354%2Farmoured-in-scales-some-preliminary-thoughts-on&amp;m=1\">EW</a>) \n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>This battle dress of black leather is the only one of Sansa\u2019s new costumes that we\u2019ve gotten a preview of so far - whereas we\u2019ve gotten a look at two new costumes for Cersei and three for Daenerys.\u00a0</p><p>This new costume does have a warrior look. In <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183300013819/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">Part 1</a> of this series of essays, I took a closer look at the texture of this costume, especially in relation to the leather armour of House Tully. In <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183521407024/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">Part 2</a>, I discussed how this textured leather dress evokes a couple of Sansa\u2019s earlier costumes as well as the similarities and differences it has with Cersei\u2019s iconic coronation dress, which is also made of black leather. In this final post, I\u2019ll explore how Sansa\u2019s new leather costume might function both as an equivalent to and a juxtaposition of the warrior look that Daenerys debuted in season 7 and carries over into season 8.</p><!-- more --><h2><b>A WARRIOR LOOK</b></h2><p>While Sansa\u2019s new costume isn\u2019t a functional armour, it strongly evokes the traditional Tully armour, which is made of overlapping leather flaps. This could be a significant political statement as I discussed in <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183300013819/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">Part 1</a> of this series. The new costume incorporates a couple of older elements like the tight leather belt with the cross-straps that envelop Sansa\u2019s torso. The belt functions as a kind of emotional armour for Sansa in season 7:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201cWith one of the key pieces this year, <b>I wanted it to look as if she was actually sewn or laced into her dress\u2014like there was no way in. </b>So I designed a belt that comes around the neck, across the chest and around the waist. <b>She\u2019s trying to protect herself</b> from all the awfulness that\u2019s happened.<b> It\u2019s a form of armor.</b> It will be interesting to see how that moves forward.\u201d </i>(Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elle.com%2Fculture%2Fmovies-tv%2Fnews%2Fa47144%2Fgame-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-easter-eggs%2F&amp;t=N2JmYTE0NWIwMTAyMWY1ODBhM2NlMzY5YzAwMzk4MjQyNzNlZGM3YSxaMGdLU2FadA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183300013819%2Fa-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks&amp;m=1\">Elle</a>)\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>Retaining this belt indicates that Sansa still feels the need to protect herself emotionally - but when it is coupled with a dress that not only resembles the the Tully armour but also evokes an earlier dress that was meant to signify both transformation and strength (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183521407024/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">Part 2</a>), it shifts the symbolism of the entire costume. Sansa also wears the necklace that was introduced at the end of season 4 and modified in season 7:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>For Sansa, <b>the chain that she wears, the needle on the end represents her Needle, her way of fighting back</b>. It\u2019s a small version of the Needle Arya has. </i>(Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a12097061/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-interview/\">Harper\u2019s Bazaar</a>)<br/></p></blockquote><p>This necklace signals that she\u2019s fighting back - it is an offensive element to the defensive position that the belt signifies. However, combining these elements with an armour-like dress on the eve of battle signals both an image of strength as the Lady of Winterfell as well as the fact that all will have to resist the threat of the White Walkers, whether they fight physically or in other ways.\u00a0In the show, female characters don\u2019t need to be warriors in the physical sense to wear armour.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"996\" data-orig-height=\"630\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d2d523001110f77b11ae4a0dc4e866ea/tumblr_inline_poq3bjK0zY1uklhai_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"996\" data-orig-height=\"630\"/></figure><p>In season 2, Clapton put Cersei Lannister in armour during the Battle of the Blackwater, both to signal that she was feeling threatened but also to signal that she had leadership role within the Red Keep where she was supposed to rally the spirits of the women. It was a role that she completely abdicated, which led to Sansa stepping in and doing Cersei\u2019s job (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/176205607679/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-10\">x</a>) - something that could very well have been a foreshadowing of Sansa\u2019s filling a similar role during the upcoming Battle of Winterfell in season 8.</p><p>In the last episode of season 6, Cersei dons armour again, this time in the form of steel pauldrons.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"960\" data-orig-height=\"816\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/29278d9b53416a15f3912ae14af7ba90/tumblr_inline_poq3hoP0BS1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"960\" data-orig-height=\"816\"/></figure><p>It is a look that she repeats in season 7 where she also debuts yet another new warrior look in the final episode:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2562\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e101b244ef63065320c285c1ea1a347f/tumblr_inline_poq3lwZW4L1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2562\"/></figure><p>While Cersei has ditched the steel pauldrons, she\u2019s wearing a close-fitting dress with a texture that resembles chain-mail. It a less visually aggressive look than her use of the pauldrons or the armoured corselet but it is a warrior look nonetheless.</p><h2><b>ANIMAL TEXTURES</b></h2><p>Sansa\u2019s new battle dress reminds me of another female warrior look - the white fur coat that Daenerys Targaryen wore in season 7. Though these two costumes look completely different on the surface (white vs black, fur vs leather), they do share one significant aspect: The fact that the surface textures of the two costumes resemble different kinds of animal skin. Sansa\u2019s leather dress evokes fish scales and Dany\u2019s fur coat is meant to evoke dragon skin:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cI guess to some extent the <b>ribbed effect</b> created by the construction has the <b>feel of a dragon\u2019s skin</b>.</i>\u201d \u00a0(Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vanityfair.com%2Fhollywood%2F2017%2F08%2Fgame-of-thrones-daenerys-coat-michele-clapton-interview-viserys&amp;t=ZjdhMDNjYmU5Y2JlM2Q5ZjlhZWI2MjAzNzE5NDQ0MDNlNTcwNTk5ZCxaMGdLU2FadA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183118735354%2Farmoured-in-scales-some-thoughts-on-sansa&amp;m=1\">Vanity Fair</a>)<br/></p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7ad50d44819a304724ad21526f55535c/tumblr_inline_pny848QkTR1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\"/></figure><p>Furthermore, both looks are warrior looks, signalling that these two women are ready to fight for what they want:</p><blockquote><p><i>Dany is <b>elevating her look to that of warrior queen</b>, with the beautiful silver dragon chain completing the look.\u201d</i> (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vanityfair.com%2Fhollywood%2F2017%2F08%2Fgame-of-thrones-daenerys-coat-michele-clapton-interview-viserys&amp;t=ZjdhMDNjYmU5Y2JlM2Q5ZjlhZWI2MjAzNzE5NDQ0MDNlNTcwNTk5ZCxaMGdLU2FadA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183118735354%2Farmoured-in-scales-some-thoughts-on-sansa&amp;m=1\">Vanity Fair</a>) <br/></p><p><i>\u201cI wanted to define Dany\u2019s shape by cutting into and shaping the fur.

Not only do they share the texture of animal skins but in season 7 Michele Clapton consciously chose to have Dany and Sansa\u2019s accessories echo each other even though the two women had never shared a scene together.</p><blockquote><p>\u201c<i><b>Dany and Sansa\u2019s accessories echo each other</b>\u2014and also come from unexpected sources. \u201c<b>We see them facing each other, really.</b> <b>We see the dynamics of this.</b> It\u2019s funny because it comes from different backgrounds. For Sansa, the chain that she wears, the needle on the end represents her Needle, her way of fighting back. It\u2019s a small version of the Needle Arya has. But the chain in a weird way is an influence from Littlefinger.<b> </b>He always used to wear accouterments for his job chained to his coat on a fine chain, and then a mockingbird sigil at his neck. <b>So I was trying to collate all the people who influenced her\u2014whether she likes them or not</b>. There\u2019s a<b> real formality about her chain</b> and the [way] the circle is positioned and looped. That\u2019s very much Littlefinger. <b>With Dany, she is trying to impress that she is the queen in ranking but she can\u2019t wear a crown, so it\u2019s just a huge statement piece of intent\u2014it\u2019s a chain of intent. Visually they play off each other.</b> Whereas Cersei has a look and I think we\u2019ll see in Episode 7 there\u2019s a definite shift.</i>\u201d (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.harpersbazaar.com%2Fculture%2Ffilm-tv%2Fa12097061%2Fgame-of-thrones-costume-designer-interview%2F&amp;t=MTc2NjkzY2Y5YTVhOGRlYTc3MDIwMDM2OWE2OGI2ZDY1NWVlYjM1NixaMGdLU2FadA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183118735354%2Farmoured-in-scales-some-thoughts-on-sansa&amp;m=1\">Harpers Bazaar</a>)<br/></p></blockquote><p>This is actually quite significant, especially since Daenerys and Sansa will enter each other\u2019s narratives in season 8. In this respect, it is interesting that Clapton has chosen to retain Dany\u2019s white furred warrior look but with significant and meaningful updates, especially the inclusion of the Targaryen red which was absent from the season 7 costume (I\u2019ve written about this costume <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/181842464629/a-bad-fit-some-thoughts-on-daenerys\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183277978864/a-bad-fit-some-thoughts-on-daenerys-targaryens\">here</a>).</p><p>In this context, one could argue that Sansa\u2019s new battle dress is not just a costume that reflects the upcoming war but also a kind of sartorial answer to Daenerys\u2019 white furred warrior look - a look that incorporates the Targaryen red, a dragon skin texture as well as dragon scale beading on the shoulders.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3030\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5b74a6e9eb1ab71f58a8f9f22b482337/tumblr_inline_pny87ysy3b1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3030\"/></figure><p>On the other hand, Sansa\u2019s fish scale armour not only refers to her mother\u2019s heritage but quite possibly also to a political alliance with her mother\u2019s family, House Tully. While Sansa doesn\u2019t wear her fur cloak in these promotional photos, I think it is very likely that we\u2019ll see her wearing her Stark furs with this new dress on the show - and this combination would refer both her mother\u2019s heritage, which Clapton has repeatedly invoked through the textures of her season 7 costumes while the fur cloak with the cross-straps refers to her Stark identity, her authority as Lady of Winterfell and the memory of her father.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201dWithin each of their costumes, there are influences. [\u2026] Sansa\u2019s are part father, part mother.<b> It\u2019s her father\u2019s silhouette with the fur, her mother\u2019s within</b>. <b>The textures are very much from her mother</b>.\u201d\u00a0 (</i>Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/news/a47144/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-easter-eggs/\">Elle</a>)\n\n<br/></p><p>\n\n\u201c<i>I think there is a cyclical movement, but also I think by introducing certain elements, like with Sansa and Littlefinger and<b> part of her mother\u2019s elements, it\u2019s still adapted into her</b>\u2014she wears<b> the fur on her shoulders and the cross-strap from Ned</b> [\u2026]</i>\u00a0(Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a12097061/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-interview/\">Harper\u2019s Bazaar</a>)<br/></p></blockquote><p>Both of these women have adopted a warrior look that references both their personal journeys as well as their their families. Sansa\u2019s costumes refer to her mother\u2019s Tully heritage and her father\u2019s Stark identity whereas Daenerys\u2019 costumes refer to her Targaryen identity, which is a product of sibling incest (there\u2019s no melding of different families here).</p><p>The EW promotional photo shoot revealed another new costume of Dany\u2019s - though it took me a while to realize that it was a new one because it is very similar to the white and red fur coat. This new costume is still white with red fur trimmings but it looks to be made from suede - it is thus a fur-less version of Dany\u2019s white and red warrior look.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1967\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6b8790f080ef233cc1d5e398d43d7d64/tumblr_inline_pny8avMhNo1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1967\"/></figure><p>What I find very interesting about this new costume is the effect that the suede along with the fur-trimmed ribbing creates, especially on the sleeves. Dany\u2019s new costume brings to mind the leathery and webbed wings of her dragons! This effect is specially noticeable in the profile view and <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> describes the effect as if\u00a0\u201c<i><a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/183447444897/the-three-queens-holding-back-in-costume-design\">a dragon wrapping its wings around itself</a></i>\n\n\u201c.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bfc13df9a52b3e5cd7f84c5bb9017a70/tumblr_inline_pp1qkivnCb1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\"/></figure><p>This webbed wing effect also shows up in her other new costume - a charcoal outfit (probably a kind of coat dress) worn under a furred shrug with extended and beaded shoulders.</p><p>Another interesting aspect of this outfit is that while it lacks the militaristic aspect of the extended shoulders of her season 7 costumes, it is a more aggressively dragon-like than any of her other costumes, even though it lacks the beading that so far has been used to evoke dragon scales.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1608\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2ee0475298eb547f7e43f4a56095b651/tumblr_inline_pny8c3DqpY1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1608\"/></figure><p>Firstly, the lack of the fur makes all the difference here. The fur softens the dragon-like webbing and scaling (as on the back of the season 7 fur coat). As we can see, the scale-like dragon-spine of her fur coat is retained in the suede coat. Leather trimmings have been added at the seams that create the webbing in a saw-tooth pattern that evokes the stitching on the season 7 coat but it has a more aggressive\u00a0\u201cfeel\u201d since it isn\u2019t an intrinsic effect of the sewing technique but an extra addition (and again not softened by fur).\u00a0</p><p>Dany\u2019s accessories are also rather dragon-like with this outfit. She wears her chain of intent - though her hair partially covers three dragon heads, the dragon spine of the chain is fully visible. Furthermore, in the profile shot it is clear that she wears a red silk sash, pleated to evoke dragon scales (it is probably the same sash that she wore in season 7).\u00a0</p><p>If Sansa\u2019s fish scale battle dress might be an answer to Daenerys\u2019 furred warrior look, then it is plausible that Dany\u2019s suede dragon wing coat might be an answer to Sansa\u2019s warrior look. Though the two costumes look different on the surface - their colours and textures are very different - the basic silhouettes as well as the materials are quite similar. Dany\u2019s second white coat looks to be made of suede, a lightweight animal skin akin to the soft, lightweight leather of Sansa\u2019s fish scale dress. They are also both side-laced in the front and have soft shoulders.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1967\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8f2f48a9f2ba5aff140463bc81ebd78e/tumblr_inline_pny8d2FmAp1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1967\"/></figure><p>The promotional material also revealed another point of similarity. Daenerys wears a red silk scarf tied in an ascot when she arrives in Winterfell and she wears it with the suede coat as well - and in the trailer we see Sansa wearing a silk ascot in either black or a midnight blue. I\u2019m very curious to what this could possibly mean. Since Sansa wears one of her season 7 costumes in the arrival scene this means that the silk ascot is mainly connected to Daenerys\u2019 character. Does this mean that Sansa is emulating Dany? It is certainly possible. However, what does this mean? Especially since Sophie Turner has stated that Sansa is done emulating other characters in her style.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2042\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c2a6abddea0e4dd09b529eac56851743/tumblr_inline_pny8dsNQRb1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2042\"/></figure><p>It could be a way for Sansa to signal that these two women are on the same side in the war against the dead. It could function as a sign that Sansa is trying to be diplomatic in a difficult situation (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183246013149/sansa-has-a-blue-silk-ascot-tied-like-danys-in\">x</a>). That is a <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist\">Watsonian</a> explanation. However, there\u2019s also the possibility that Clapton has made this choice for Doylist reasons - to signal both a similarities and differences between the two characters since the colours are quite different. While their scarves are of the same material and are tied in the same way - the differences in colour create very different effects. Sansa\u2019s dark ascot almost merges with the rest of her costume. It doesn\u2019t draw attention to itself visually whereas it is the completely opposite situation with Dany\u2019s ascot since the red silk stands in a glaring contrast to the white costume.</p><p>Despite the surface differences between the costumes of these two characters, I do think that it is important to look at them in relation to each other because these two women are finally going to interact and Clapton likes to express the nature of such relationships through the costuming. In season 3, she expressed Cersei and Margaery\u2019s simmering feud through costumes that were radically different in colour and cut (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/179909400489/the-rose-of-highgarden-on-margaery-tyrell-part\">x</a>). She also talks about Dany and Cersei\u2019s season 7 costumes in terms of a sartorial\u00a0\u201cstandoff\u201d that echoes the political power play between them and though their costumes look quite different, there\u2019s a similarity in the severity of the silhouettes as well as the symbolic values of the their jewellery:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201c<i>You can see in the way [Dany is] dressing that <b>she\u2019s almost assuming the power but not quite</b>. With <b>all the colors and the details and the essence </b>\u2014 <b>it just becomes stronger</b>. The width of the shoulders give her strength, the chain gives her strength. I tried to make the <b>cut of the costumes just slightly more like a uniform</b> and almost less feminine. This is the time when it\u2019s all really going to matter, and so</i>\u00a0<b>there\u2019s</b> <b>a power play between her and Cersei. It\u2019s like a standoff</b>. And I think they\u2019ve both reached a place where it\u2019s not about femininity, it\u2019s about their strength as women.</i>\u201d (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.thisisinsider.com/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-2017-6\">Insider</a>)</p><p>\u201c<i>I knew so instantly how Cersei should be, looking back at the arc of her story and her relationship with her father. I always try to make the clothes visually tell something \u2013 she said very little in that whole scene. I think you could tell it was based on her father\u2019s costume\u2026there were so many elements to it, I loved it. Then <b>to</b> <b>pare down the crown into just simple strokes that to me looked like a lion still,</b> that\u2019s what they\u2019re meant to be,<b> but without that sort of solid heraldic lion that she\u2019s usually worn</b>. I quite liked the idea that it was a move away from that. <b>Which then ties into Dany, the way they look at each other later on</b>.</i>\u201d (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://blog.fidmmuseum.org/museum/2018/09/interview-with-game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton.html\">FIDM Museum</a>)<br/></p></blockquote><p>It will be interesting to see how the interactions between Sansa and Daenerys will unfold because there will most likely be emotional complications and political tensions - so, in my opinion, it makes perfect sense to view the their costumes in terms of a sartorial stand-off because while Dany has come to help the North, she\u2019s also demanding their fealty despite their strong wish for independence - and Sansa might not be thrilled that Jon has promised to send their long-suffering people into yet another bloody war after the fight against the Dead.\u00a0</p><p>On the other hand, Dany is not used to any of her followers or lovers having emotional ties to any other people than her. She\u2019s used to being the center of their world (just look at Jorah, Daario, etc.), and Jon has a family that he loves dearly and while Arya is his favorite sister, he has a bond with Sansa that is special because they were the ones that won back Winterfell together. They have been political partners for a while and despite their quarrels, they love each other dearly. Dany simply isn\u2019t used to having to compete for the attention of her followers - Jon has a family that he loves, he\u2019s a leader who has his people to answer to and Dany is not the center of his world, like she is to most of her followers who are rootless people that have made her their world.</p><h2><b>A CLASH OF QUEENS</b></h2><p>During season 7, the show has presented Sansa, Daenerys and Cersei as either parallels or foils to each other - in terms of leadership - and that is reflected in the costumes, which was a conscious decision on the part of Clapton:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThe women has become&hellip; they\u2019ve always been important but they\u2019ve become so much more dominant - and <b>I love playing the interplay between the women left.</b>\u201d</i> (Michele Clapton,<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dccmXw0YpJU&amp;t=9s\"> IGN Live SDCC 2016</a>)<br/></p></blockquote><p>I\u2019m not the first to notice how Clapton created several correspondences between the costumes of Cersei, Daenerys and Sansa in the last season - some details were rather subtle while other details are more obvious. <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myHfbeJjjc8bFgVOAD6sAmg\">@jonsalways</a> has written a <a href=\"https://jonsalways.tumblr.com/post/167586483239/the-3-queens-of-westeros-a-costume-meta\">post</a> comparing the costumes of the three women and <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> has also explored the similarities and differences in the costuming (you can read them <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/181902464977/a-ladys-armor-part-3\">here</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/182085659532/a-ladys-armor-part-4\">here</a>).</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/99dc206e3a57fb82da2f176eaf580faa/tumblr_inline_pos2z1tT331uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\"/></figure><p>A common element of all three women is the bleak and militaristic quality of their costumes:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\n&ldquo;There\u2019s war coming. Everything\u2019s quite muted and quite bleak. <b>I think it\u2019s important for the four women left to have a very strong\u2014it\u2019s not masculine, there\u2019s still a femininity to it\u2014but there\u2019s a sort of hardening. Each one of them has been through such a journey, so I tried to reflect that in their costumes</b>. For instance, Sansa: she\u2019s been abused, raped, and had the most horrific things happen to her, so I liked the idea that she\u2019s encased in her costume. No one is gonna get into her, no one is gonna get near her. It is an armor. She\u2019s laced and then she has the belt, which I really particularly like, which goes up and around her body. Everything is really controlled. <b>I\u2019ve also shortened the length of the dresses on Cersei and Sansa because I want there to be a practicality. </b>The way the women are arriving in the north, they\u2019re beginning to fight and realize they have to be equal. <b>They have to fight for survival. I had to get rid of all the unnecessary.</b> With Dany, the colors have gotten darker but there is a red creeping in, her house color. Slowly we\u2019re trying to move them into their own individual looks. It\u2019s practical. It\u2019s war. <b>The time isn\u2019t for pretty dresses. Jewelry isn\u2019t worn to be attractive. It\u2019s worn to represent your house or your stature or your intent.</b> This is the direction I have to go in now.&rdquo;</i> (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a12097061/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-interview/\">Harper\u2019s Bazaar</a>)<br/></p></blockquote><p>Firstly, all three women wear dark colours - charcoal and black - to signify mourning as well as the fact that winter and war has come to the shores of Westeros. Secondly, the costumes of all three women have an armoured look, which is expressed in different ways according to their individual narrative journeys. Cersei wears actual armour in the form of steel pauldrons whereas the silhouette of Dany\u2019s costumes with the extended shoulders not only references the style of her late brother Viserys but also evoke the armour of the Unsullied, which signify her role as their commander. She is here to make war. Sansa\u2019s armour is her belt that not only binds her waist tightly but also encases her torso with extra cross straps, metaphorically protecting herself from the touch of others.</p><p>Another common theme is the way that the three women\u2019s costumes reference the men in the men in their families - Cersei\u2019s coronation dress is a deliberate nod to the style of her father Tywin whose approval she always sought be never got (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183521407024/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">x</a>). Dany\u2019s style is inspired by her brother Viserys, the man who abused her but whose ambition she is finally about to realize (<a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/179678685367/fire-and-blood\">x</a>) and Sansa\u2019s costumes not only reference her father Eddard but also her mother Catelyn (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183300013819/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">x</a>) as well as her half-brother Jon (<a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/181846188337/a-ladys-armor-part-2\">x</a>) and her sister Arya (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183521407024/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">x</a>).</p><p>One commonality between all the different costumes are the emphasis on the shoulders, either through extended shoulder tabs, actual armour and/or beading.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3264\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/881d3a90960611482c3fef8c2e06200c/tumblr_inline_pny8jm2gcT1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3264\"/></figure><p>There are, however, some specific costume elements that converse with each other beyond a general militaristic look and dark colours. Sansa and Cersei\u2019s hems have been shortened for practicality. Unlike Cersei, both Sansa and Dany incorporate fur into their look - Sansa with her fur cape and Dany with fur lining and an elaborate fur coat. Both Dany and Cersei use elaborate beading on some of their costumes - but whereas Cersei\u2019s opulent beaded pieces signals a brittleness to her strength evoked through the use of glass, Dany\u2019s beaded shoulder pieces evinces a jagged hardness that has carried over from the end of season 6 - and in general, the more ornate and\u00a0\u201chard\u201d her dragon scales become, the more powerful she is (<a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/articles/game-of-thrones-embroiderer-michele-carragher-talks-dragons-and-dresses-sb\">x</a>).\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"391\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c85367cebf2efb097226721f6644e888/tumblr_inline_pos2y0bZyW1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"391\"/></figure><p>One interesting point of comparison are the stylistic similarities between the backs of Cersei\u2019s Dragonpit costume and Dany\u2019s white fur coat. Both of these costumes feature a kind of animal \u201cspine\u201d - Clapton refers to Cersei\u2019s as a\u00a0\u201cstinger\u201d and Dany\u2019s\u00a0\u201cspine\u201d resembles dragon scales, evoking the animals that she is so closely associated with.</p><p>Their accessories also converse with each other - as the Clapton quotes in the previous section prove. Sansa\u2019s chain refers back to an earlier one, and it is linked not only to her tutelage under Baelish\u2019 aegis (the chain) but also to her sister Arya (the Needle). Now it is a bit more formal, attached to her belt, which reflect her position as Lady of Winterfell.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1352\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e9010cca75b8ff60af7296f8b3e3c103/tumblr_inline_pny8ix6asl1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1352\"/></figure><p>Dany\u2019s chain represents her ambition - Clapton calls it a\u00a0\u201cchain of intent\u201d, the intent being the conquest of the Iron Throne. Since Dany isn\u2019t actually Queen yet, Clapton withheld a crown from her costume. Dany\u2019s chain features the sigil of her House, the three-headed dragon, and in that sense it echoes Cersei\u2019s crown, which is an abstract rendering of a lion, the sigil of House Lannister. However, Cersei also wears chains - and they are connected to her armour, i.e. the pauldrons she wears with her coronation dress. In that sense, these chains echoes Sansa\u2019s necklace where the chain is fastened to her belt, which functions as Sansa\u2019s armour.</p><p>Will the costumes of Cersei, Sansa and Daenerys continue to converse with each other in season 8? Based on the limited material we have so far, I\u2019ll say\u00a0\u201cYes\u201d. While there are significant changes in style, there are still elements from season 7 that carries over in the new season. However, it is a bit difficult to determine the extent of this sartorial\u00a0\u201cconversation\u201d, especially since we only have images of one of Sansa\u2019s new costumes as compared to images of two new costumes for Cersei and three new costumes for Dany.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e7ca07f142e559e73f3cad6f786ce15f/tumblr_inline_pny8ntgJew1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\"/></figure><p>So what we infer for the available visual material? Firstly, the dark colours are still there. Secondly, they still have their various forms of armour - Cersei has her pauldrons, Sansa her belt and Dany the extended shoulders. Cersei\u2019s \u201cstinger\u201d has moved to the front of her costumes and Dany\u2019s dragon\u00a0\u201cspine\u201d has now been split into wings (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183277978864/a-bad-fit-some-thoughts-on-daenerys-targaryens\">x</a>).\u00a0</p><p>Another common element that has been retained is the use of chains in the costumes of all three women. Daenerys still wears her\u00a0\u201cchain of intent\u201d even though she\u2019s taking pains to partially cover the three-headed dragon with her hair, probably in an effort not to look too intimidating, too Targaryen in the North (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/181842464629/a-bad-fit-some-thoughts-on-daenerys\">x</a>). Cersei has also retained the chains that link to her pauldrons, only now she has added the lion pendant that she wore in season 1.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1088\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c68590a9c1e91f284764ec3501140e50/tumblr_inline_pny8wcAg451uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1088\"/></figure><p>Sansa has also retained her Needle necklace and chain that attaches to her belt from season 7. What is interesting in this context is the fact that the symbolism and iconography of Sansa\u2019s chain/necklace is purely personal - as opposed to the chains that the two other women wear, which feature the heraldic sigils of their respective Houses. This has prompted <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> and I to discuss whether Clapton will incorporate the Stark direwolf into Sansa\u2019s chain/jewellery later in the season (she talks about this aspect <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/183747085887/sansa-costume-speculation\">here</a>).</p><p>While the promotional images show us that all three women sill still wear costumes in dark colours, the images also revealed that colour is coming back, at least in Dany\u2019s and Cersei\u2019s costumes so far. And it is very interesting that it is a colour that they both share: Red!</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1515\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/45ffabeeaef6a636528f99d132480bfd/tumblr_inline_pny91wUkDI1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1515\"/></figure><p>While Clapton primarily used dark colours last season to signal that war and winter is here, she didn\u2019t abandon the use of colour completely. In fact, she introduced the colour red in Dany\u2019s costumes for the first time ever, something that fans have been waiting for since the very first season.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i><b>I wanted this season to close down colour-wise, except that Dany now she\u2019s just getting a little bit of red coming into her costume</b>, she\u2019s finally claimed her throne\u2026 well, <b>she\u2019s on her way to claiming her throne</b>.</i>\u00a0(Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.thisisinsider.com/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-2017-6\">Insider</a>)<br/></p></blockquote><p>The very fact that Clapton closed down the colour in general makes the inclusion of a discrete red in Dany\u2019s costumes even more significant - and from the looks of these photos, the red is becoming much more prominent in Dany\u2019s costumes at the same time as Cersei is returning to the Lannister red.</p><h2><b>BLACK - WHITE - RED</b></h2><p>While I\u2019ve looked at the similarities between the costumes of the female leaders, the promotional material also show us some rather significant differences, especially when it comes to the use of colour. Thus, Dany\u2019s white-red coats stand in stark contrast to Sansa\u2019s black leather and Cersei\u2019s deep red velvet.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3d961ddaaa6c986dcb31f27d06573e90/tumblr_inline_pny93wjIrV1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\"/></figure><p>What do these dominant colours mean to each woman? In order to answer this question we have to take a closer look at the sometimes idiosyncratic manner in which Clapton uses colour in the narrative arcs of the different women.\u00a0</p><p><b>Black/Blue (Sansa)</b></p><p>When it comes to the colour black, Clapton generally uses it to denote mourning, which I discussed in the previous <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183521407024/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">essay</a> of this series. However, the use of black in Sansa\u2019s costumes goes beyond mourning. Her infamous raven dress marks the first time she wears black but it also marks a major stylistic transformation as well as being a statement of agency on Sansa\u2019s part - I\u2019ve discussed all of these aspects in the previous post.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1515\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5dc16cf6ded09f5267fadd484cd3c030/tumblr_inline_pp16tl5nFe1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1515\"/></figure><p>Black isn\u2019t really a colour that is closely associated with Sansa - she only wore it at the end of season 4 and in the beginning of season 5. She has only had three black costumes prior to the new leather dress. In some ways, introducing black into Sansa\u2019s costumes feels a bit like a step back, mainly because it is a colour that she wore when she was under the thumb of Petyr Baelish but also because she wore it just before she came to suffer the most severe sexual, physical and emotional abuse that she has ever been subjected to. Sansa wore black just before her narrative took the darkest possible turn.</p><p>So why does Clapton return to the colour black with Sansa in season 8? First of all, this is most likely not Sansa\u2019s only costume and hardly her endgame costume. The armour-like scaling as well as the <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183300013819/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">transitional silhouette</a>, leads me to believe that this is a mid-season costume, related to the war against the Dead. In this sense, it would be useful to go back as see what Clapton said about the raven dress, which boils down to Transformation and Strength!</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201c<b>When she comes down the stairs</b>, she\u2019s playing with it like, \u2018<b>This is me, taking control of this situation</b>.\u2019\u201d </i>(Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thecut.com%2F2014%2F12%2Fstyle-to-expect-when-game-of-thrones-returns.html&amp;t=YTUwODI0YTFlZGRmZjQ4M2JmZTFmYWMwNDM1ZjdiNmM3NGMxYzM5ZCxaMGdLU2FadA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183118735354%2Farmoured-in-scales-some-thoughts-on-sansa&amp;m=1\">The Cut</a>) <br/></p><p><i>David and Dan came to me with <b>the idea of a transformation for Sansa</b>.

Plus, <b>in general, Clapton uses the darker colours to signify strength when it comes to the female characters.</b></p><p><b>There is, however, also a curious sensual aspect to this costume</b>, which is an entirely new element to Sansa\u2019s costuming (apart from the plunging neckline of the raven dress). The photos reveal that <b>it is made from soft and glossy leather, which lends the whole outfit a sort slinky quality</b>. Though <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183300013819/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">it mimics the Tully leather armour</a>, this dress isn\u2019t thick or stiff - and though it retains the tight-laced silhouette from season 7 with the belt that is Sansa\u2019s emotional armour, <b>the soft and glossy leather practically invites a touch</b>. This is a curious dichotomy: <b><i>a tightly laced and armoured body, wrapped a glossy material that draws attention to itself (by reflecting light), a material that looks so soft that you\u2019re tempted to touch.\u00a0</i></b></p><p>In the photos we have of Sansa\u2019s new costume, there\u2019s a noted bluish iridescence to piece. However, it is hard to tell whether this bluish tint is simply an effect of reflected light and/or Photoshop - or whether the leather is perhaps a deep midnight blue rather than all black. It isn\u2019t really something we can determine until we get better photos and see the costume on the screen. However, I have made an edit comparing two different photos of Sansa\u2019s dress to Cersei\u2019s black silk dress from season 7 since it\u2019s shiny fabric also reflects light.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dbfb6f973022abaa8cf18dd876559a67/tumblr_inline_poqoydigVd1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\"/></figure><p>Sansa\u2019s dress does seem more blue-tinted than Cersei\u2019s black silk - but I cannot discount this as an effect of Photoshop. The reason I bring up this issue is because blue is a colour that is very much connected to Sansa Stark. Clapton has always used blue for House Stark:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>We have a lot of <b>blues and grays</b>, murkier colors that seemed right for the harsh <b>northern climates</b>. The Starks represent a warm family unit, so the blues of their costumes are rather warm. But within the family, the various personalities are reflected in what they wear. For example, Sansa is in a slightly cooler blue.</i> (<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fcostumevault.blogspot.com%2F2016%2F08%2Fcreating-seven-kingdoms-part-i-north.html&amp;t=ZjdjYmY0Yzg5Mjk3OWQ5NWU0NzdjNDZhZjI4MmViZDM0YTdhNzgxNCxvWWc4SXdmUA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182432528629%2Fwinterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-17&amp;m=1\">CostumeVault</a>) \n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>However, Sansa in particular has worn quite a few blue costumes (about 10 all in all). In the early seasons, she was very much associated with very light blue colours, which denote her youthful innocence. Interestingly, Margaery wears light blue as well - but in a calculated way - to affect an innocent girlishness that she doesn\u2019t possess (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/179909400489/the-rose-of-highgarden-on-margaery-tyrell-part\">x</a>). Cersei has also worn a light blue dress at her most fragile moments in season 1 and 2.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1009\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0d7643a386ed842ca5310788f417d577/tumblr_inline_pp18ouboAQ1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1009\"/></figure><p>Thus, Michele Clapton generally uses a pale blue colour to signal youthful innocence as well as fragility - and the innocence of youth is indeed a fragile thing. Over the course of the seasons, Sansa starts to wear darker blues - like the dark greyish-blue cloak she wears in season 4-6 and the vibrant teal dress she wears when she sets out to reclaim her home with Jon Snow.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3264\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/71042373afdd34c1a9f05f5e615dfe49/tumblr_inline_pnyh1iR8pu1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3264\"/></figure><p>These darker blues takes Sansa closer to the adult Starks - both Ned and Catelyn sometimes wore dark blues, though only Catelyn has worn teal before Sansa. In this context, it is indeed possible that Sansa\u2019s new leather dress isn\u2019t pure black but a midnight blue so deep that it is almost black. However, this is at present highly speculative since we need more and better visual material to\u00a0 make a final pronouncement. However, since colour is creeping black into Cersei and Dany\u2019s costumes - I do think that we\u2019ll see a dark, vibrant blue return in Sansa\u2019s endgame costumes.</p><p><b>White/Red (Daenerys)</b></p><p>Apart from Sansa\u2019s second wedding gown from season 5, Daenerys is the only female character who has worn white - and she\u2019s the only one who has consistently worn white.

It is fascinating that Clapton also relates the use of white with Daenerys feeling like she has a divine right (to what she wants) and that she is beyond question, which is an incredibly dangerous thing for a ruler to think.\u00a0</p><h2>When it comes to Daenerys, white is connected to her being powerful, untouchable, remote and almost god-like.</h2><p>This certainly sounds very impressive but all of these things signals a person that is both lonely and too powerful for her own good.

It is, as mentioned before, a warrior look - but it is also a look connected to her infatuation with Jon:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201c<b>It was the first time</b> that I could remember <b>that Dany had put herself in danger that is not necessarily for personal gain</b>, so <b>the white was this sense of purity</b>,\u201d said costume designer Clapton (a three-time Emmy winner for \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and last year\u2019s winner for \u201cThe Crown\u201d). \u201c<b>It had an honesty to it\u2026she has fallen in love with Jon</b>.\u201d</i> (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2018/08/game-of-thrones-season-7-dany-costume-production-design-hbo-emmys-1201994086/\">IndieWire</a>)<br/></p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1552\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe6983281bac87a890c1b89f05bbfb80/tumblr_inline_pos5rhw6yS1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1552\"/></figure><p>Yet even here Dany can\u2019t escape the dehumanizing effect of the way that Clapton uses white in her costumes:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nClapton equated the visual importance of Dany\u2019s white coat with mythology. \u201cI wanted to create <b>this powerful image of her</b> descending <b>like an Angel</b> to save these men from imminent death,\u201d she said.</i> (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2018/08/game-of-thrones-season-7-dany-costume-production-design-hbo-emmys-1201994086/\">IndieWire</a>)<br/></p></blockquote><p>The visual effect was dazzling with the pale, silver-haired woman wearing pure white in a landscape of snow and ice.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"300\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4a94e7292f9b8947ff481854dea4c0ac/tumblr_inline_pp1lce3mU81uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"300\"/></figure><p>She looks ethereal - but not very human either - and the colour white is indeed very ambiguous in relation to Dany\u2019s narrative arc as Clapton\u2019s comments reveals.\u00a0<br/></p><p>The promotional material reveals that Daenerys retains the white in some of her new costumes - but with one very important difference: the addition of the colour red, which becomes very conspicuous when compared to the white.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1009\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/212c1c10eb76e243c680d5ecfecf129c/tumblr_inline_pos5t41Lum1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1009\"/></figure><p>Red is one of the traditional colours of House Targaryen and Clapton has withheld it until season 7 for narrative reasons.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThis season seemed to be the <b>right time for Daenerys to start to embrace the shape and colours of her house</b>,\u201d Clapton told HuffPost in an email. \u201c<b>She is in touching distance of her desired place \u2026 so I liked this flowering</b>, this <b>visual expression of her growing confidence</b> that she could maybe take the throne.\u201d</i> (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.huffpostbrasil.com/entry/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-explains-danys-meaningful-outfits_us_59a4319fe4b06d67e33926b6?ec_carp=8265756527327536922\">Huffpost</a>)<br/></p></blockquote><p>However, Clapton really uses red in a very loaded way when it comes to Dany because it not just her House colour, it is also a outward sign of her hunger for power in the form of the Iron Throne.\u00a0This is an ambition that she adopted from her brother Viserys, so when Dany wear\u2019s red it also refers to her late brother:</p><blockquote><p>\u201c<i>When we see her now, <b>she\u2019s starting to wear the colors of her brother.

This year, the excitement was even bigger because Sophie Turner had let slip that Sansa\u2019s would be wearing armour in the final season of the show (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183300013819/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">x</a>).\u00a0However, the promotional photos revealed a costume that isn\u2019t actual armour but more of a warrior look in a symbolic sense, which fits well with another thing Turner said about Sansa\u2019s arc in the last season:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201cWe the idea of it being very protective and she buttons herself up,\u201d Turner says. \u201cI wanted her to have a bit of armor and be a bit more warrior like. <b>She\u2019s like the warrior of Winterfell</b>.\u201d</i> (Sophie Turner, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Few.com%2Ftv%2F2019%2F02%2F20%2Fsophie-turner-sansa-armor-game-thrones-season-8%2F&amp;t=ZWJjMDlhNzgxMGVkZTcyY2M4ZDBiYjY5NjU0ZDliNGYwNDJkNWU1NyxaMGdLU2FadA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183118735354%2Farmoured-in-scales-some-preliminary-thoughts-on&amp;m=1\">EW</a>) \n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>This battle dress of black leather is the only one of Sansa\u2019s new costumes that we\u2019ve gotten a preview of so far - whereas we\u2019ve gotten a look at two new costumes for Cersei and three for Daenerys.\u00a0</p><p>This new costume does have a warrior look. In <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183300013819/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">Part 1</a> of this series of essays, I took a closer look at the texture of this costume, especially in relation to the leather armour of House Tully. In <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183521407024/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">Part 2</a>, I discussed how this textured leather dress evokes a couple of Sansa\u2019s earlier costumes as well as the similarities and differences it has with Cersei\u2019s iconic coronation dress, which is also made of black leather. In this final post, I\u2019ll explore how Sansa\u2019s new leather costume might function both as an equivalent to and a juxtaposition of the warrior look that Daenerys debuted in season 7 and carries over into season 8.</p>[[MORE]]<h2><b>A WARRIOR LOOK</b></h2><p>While Sansa\u2019s new costume isn\u2019t a functional armour, it strongly evokes the traditional Tully armour, which is made of overlapping leather flaps. This could be a significant political statement as I discussed in <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183300013819/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">Part 1</a> of this series. The new costume incorporates a couple of older elements like the tight leather belt with the cross-straps that envelop Sansa\u2019s torso. The belt functions as a kind of emotional armour for Sansa in season 7:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201cWith one of the key pieces this year, <b>I wanted it to look as if she was actually sewn or laced into her dress\u2014like there was no way in. </b>So I designed a belt that comes around the neck, across the chest and around the waist. <b>She\u2019s trying to protect herself</b> from all the awfulness that\u2019s happened.<b> It\u2019s a form of armor.</b> It will be interesting to see how that moves forward.\u201d </i>(Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elle.com%2Fculture%2Fmovies-tv%2Fnews%2Fa47144%2Fgame-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-easter-eggs%2F&amp;t=N2JmYTE0NWIwMTAyMWY1ODBhM2NlMzY5YzAwMzk4MjQyNzNlZGM3YSxaMGdLU2FadA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183300013819%2Fa-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks&amp;m=1\">Elle</a>)\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>Retaining this belt indicates that Sansa still feels the need to protect herself emotionally - but when it is coupled with a dress that not only resembles the the Tully armour but also evokes an earlier dress that was meant to signify both transformation and strength (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183521407024/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">Part 2</a>), it shifts the symbolism of the entire costume. Sansa also wears the necklace that was introduced at the end of season 4 and modified in season 7:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>For Sansa, <b>the chain that she wears, the needle on the end represents her Needle, her way of fighting back</b>. It\u2019s a small version of the Needle Arya has. </i>(Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a12097061/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-interview/\">Harper\u2019s Bazaar</a>)<br></p></blockquote><p>This necklace signals that she\u2019s fighting back - it is an offensive element to the defensive position that the belt signifies. However, combining these elements with an armour-like dress on the eve of battle signals both an image of strength as the Lady of Winterfell as well as the fact that all will have to resist the threat of the White Walkers, whether they fight physically or in other ways.\u00a0In the show, female characters don\u2019t need to be warriors in the physical sense to wear armour.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"996\" data-orig-height=\"630\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d2d523001110f77b11ae4a0dc4e866ea/tumblr_inline_poq3bjK0zY1uklhai_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"996\" data-orig-height=\"630\"></figure><p>In season 2, Clapton put Cersei Lannister in armour during the Battle of the Blackwater, both to signal that she was feeling threatened but also to signal that she had leadership role within the Red Keep where she was supposed to rally the spirits of the women. It was a role that she completely abdicated, which led to Sansa stepping in and doing Cersei\u2019s job (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/176205607679/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-10\">x</a>) - something that could very well have been a foreshadowing of Sansa\u2019s filling a similar role during the upcoming Battle of Winterfell in season 8.</p><p>In the last episode of season 6, Cersei dons armour again, this time in the form of steel pauldrons.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"960\" data-orig-height=\"816\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/29278d9b53416a15f3912ae14af7ba90/tumblr_inline_poq3hoP0BS1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"960\" data-orig-height=\"816\"></figure><p>It is a look that she repeats in season 7 where she also debuts yet another new warrior look in the final episode:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2562\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e101b244ef63065320c285c1ea1a347f/tumblr_inline_poq3lwZW4L1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2562\"></figure><p>While Cersei has ditched the steel pauldrons, she\u2019s wearing a close-fitting dress with a texture that resembles chain-mail. It a less visually aggressive look than her use of the pauldrons or the armoured corselet but it is a warrior look nonetheless.</p><h2><b>ANIMAL TEXTURES</b></h2><p>Sansa\u2019s new battle dress reminds me of another female warrior look - the white fur coat that Daenerys Targaryen wore in season 7. Though these two costumes look completely different on the surface (white vs black, fur vs leather), they do share one significant aspect: The fact that the surface textures of the two costumes resemble different kinds of animal skin. Sansa\u2019s leather dress evokes fish scales and Dany\u2019s fur coat is meant to evoke dragon skin:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cI guess to some extent the <b>ribbed effect</b> created by the construction has the <b>feel of a dragon\u2019s skin</b>.</i>\u201d \u00a0(Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vanityfair.com%2Fhollywood%2F2017%2F08%2Fgame-of-thrones-daenerys-coat-michele-clapton-interview-viserys&amp;t=ZjdhMDNjYmU5Y2JlM2Q5ZjlhZWI2MjAzNzE5NDQ0MDNlNTcwNTk5ZCxaMGdLU2FadA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183118735354%2Farmoured-in-scales-some-thoughts-on-sansa&amp;m=1\">Vanity Fair</a>)<br></p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7ad50d44819a304724ad21526f55535c/tumblr_inline_pny848QkTR1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\"></figure><p>Furthermore, both looks are warrior looks, signalling that these two women are ready to fight for what they want:</p><blockquote><p><i>Dany is <b>elevating her look to that of warrior queen</b>, with the beautiful silver dragon chain completing the look.\u201d</i> (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vanityfair.com%2Fhollywood%2F2017%2F08%2Fgame-of-thrones-daenerys-coat-michele-clapton-interview-viserys&amp;t=ZjdhMDNjYmU5Y2JlM2Q5ZjlhZWI2MjAzNzE5NDQ0MDNlNTcwNTk5ZCxaMGdLU2FadA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183118735354%2Farmoured-in-scales-some-thoughts-on-sansa&amp;m=1\">Vanity Fair</a>) <br></p><p><i>\u201cI wanted to define Dany\u2019s shape by cutting into and shaping the fur.

Not only do they share the texture of animal skins but in season 7 Michele Clapton consciously chose to have Dany and Sansa\u2019s accessories echo each other even though the two women had never shared a scene together.</p><blockquote><p>\u201c<i><b>Dany and Sansa\u2019s accessories echo each other</b>\u2014and also come from unexpected sources. \u201c<b>We see them facing each other, really.</b> <b>We see the dynamics of this.</b> It\u2019s funny because it comes from different backgrounds. For Sansa, the chain that she wears, the needle on the end represents her Needle, her way of fighting back. It\u2019s a small version of the Needle Arya has. But the chain in a weird way is an influence from Littlefinger.<b> </b>He always used to wear accouterments for his job chained to his coat on a fine chain, and then a mockingbird sigil at his neck. <b>So I was trying to collate all the people who influenced her\u2014whether she likes them or not</b>. There\u2019s a<b> real formality about her chain</b> and the [way] the circle is positioned and looped. That\u2019s very much Littlefinger. <b>With Dany, she is trying to impress that she is the queen in ranking but she can\u2019t wear a crown, so it\u2019s just a huge statement piece of intent\u2014it\u2019s a chain of intent. Visually they play off each other.</b> Whereas Cersei has a look and I think we\u2019ll see in Episode 7 there\u2019s a definite shift.</i>\u201d (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.harpersbazaar.com%2Fculture%2Ffilm-tv%2Fa12097061%2Fgame-of-thrones-costume-designer-interview%2F&amp;t=MTc2NjkzY2Y5YTVhOGRlYTc3MDIwMDM2OWE2OGI2ZDY1NWVlYjM1NixaMGdLU2FadA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183118735354%2Farmoured-in-scales-some-thoughts-on-sansa&amp;m=1\">Harpers Bazaar</a>)<br></p></blockquote><p>This is actually quite significant, especially since Daenerys and Sansa will enter each other\u2019s narratives in season 8. In this respect, it is interesting that Clapton has chosen to retain Dany\u2019s white furred warrior look but with significant and meaningful updates, especially the inclusion of the Targaryen red which was absent from the season 7 costume (I\u2019ve written about this costume <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/181842464629/a-bad-fit-some-thoughts-on-daenerys\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183277978864/a-bad-fit-some-thoughts-on-daenerys-targaryens\">here</a>).</p><p>In this context, one could argue that Sansa\u2019s new battle dress is not just a costume that reflects the upcoming war but also a kind of sartorial answer to Daenerys\u2019 white furred warrior look - a look that incorporates the Targaryen red, a dragon skin texture as well as dragon scale beading on the shoulders.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3030\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5b74a6e9eb1ab71f58a8f9f22b482337/tumblr_inline_pny87ysy3b1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3030\"></figure><p>On the other hand, Sansa\u2019s fish scale armour not only refers to her mother\u2019s heritage but quite possibly also to a political alliance with her mother\u2019s family, House Tully. While Sansa doesn\u2019t wear her fur cloak in these promotional photos, I think it is very likely that we\u2019ll see her wearing her Stark furs with this new dress on the show - and this combination would refer both her mother\u2019s heritage, which Clapton has repeatedly invoked through the textures of her season 7 costumes while the fur cloak with the cross-straps refers to her Stark identity, her authority as Lady of Winterfell and the memory of her father.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201dWithin each of their costumes, there are influences. [\u2026] Sansa\u2019s are part father, part mother.<b> It\u2019s her father\u2019s silhouette with the fur, her mother\u2019s within</b>. <b>The textures are very much from her mother</b>.\u201d\u00a0 (</i>Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/news/a47144/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-easter-eggs/\">Elle</a>)\n\n<br></p><p>\n\n\u201c<i>I think there is a cyclical movement, but also I think by introducing certain elements, like with Sansa and Littlefinger and<b> part of her mother\u2019s elements, it\u2019s still adapted into her</b>\u2014she wears<b> the fur on her shoulders and the cross-strap from Ned</b> [\u2026]</i>\u00a0(Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a12097061/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-interview/\">Harper\u2019s Bazaar</a>)<br></p></blockquote><p>Both of these women have adopted a warrior look that references both their personal journeys as well as their their families. Sansa\u2019s costumes refer to her mother\u2019s Tully heritage and her father\u2019s Stark identity whereas Daenerys\u2019 costumes refer to her Targaryen identity, which is a product of sibling incest (there\u2019s no melding of different families here).</p><p>The EW promotional photo shoot revealed another new costume of Dany\u2019s - though it took me a while to realize that it was a new one because it is very similar to the white and red fur coat. This new costume is still white with red fur trimmings but it looks to be made from suede - it is thus a fur-less version of Dany\u2019s white and red warrior look.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1967\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6b8790f080ef233cc1d5e398d43d7d64/tumblr_inline_pny8avMhNo1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1967\"></figure><p>What I find very interesting about this new costume is the effect that the suede along with the fur-trimmed ribbing creates, especially on the sleeves. Dany\u2019s new costume brings to mind the leathery and webbed wings of her dragons! This effect is specially noticeable in the profile view and <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> describes the effect as if\u00a0\u201c<i><a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/183447444897/the-three-queens-holding-back-in-costume-design\">a dragon wrapping its wings around itself</a></i>\n\n\u201c.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bfc13df9a52b3e5cd7f84c5bb9017a70/tumblr_inline_pp1qkivnCb1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\"></figure><p>This webbed wing effect also shows up in her other new costume - a charcoal outfit (probably a kind of coat dress) worn under a furred shrug with extended and beaded shoulders.</p><p>Another interesting aspect of this outfit is that while it lacks the militaristic aspect of the extended shoulders of her season 7 costumes, it is a more aggressively dragon-like than any of her other costumes, even though it lacks the beading that so far has been used to evoke dragon scales.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1608\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2ee0475298eb547f7e43f4a56095b651/tumblr_inline_pny8c3DqpY1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1608\"></figure><p>Firstly, the lack of the fur makes all the difference here. The fur softens the dragon-like webbing and scaling (as on the back of the season 7 fur coat). As we can see, the scale-like dragon-spine of her fur coat is retained in the suede coat. Leather trimmings have been added at the seams that create the webbing in a saw-tooth pattern that evokes the stitching on the season 7 coat but it has a more aggressive\u00a0\u201cfeel\u201d since it isn\u2019t an intrinsic effect of the sewing technique but an extra addition (and again not softened by fur).\u00a0</p><p>Dany\u2019s accessories are also rather dragon-like with this outfit. She wears her chain of intent - though her hair partially covers three dragon heads, the dragon spine of the chain is fully visible. Furthermore, in the profile shot it is clear that she wears a red silk sash, pleated to evoke dragon scales (it is probably the same sash that she wore in season 7).\u00a0</p><p>If Sansa\u2019s fish scale battle dress might be an answer to Daenerys\u2019 furred warrior look, then it is plausible that Dany\u2019s suede dragon wing coat might be an answer to Sansa\u2019s warrior look. Though the two costumes look different on the surface - their colours and textures are very different - the basic silhouettes as well as the materials are quite similar. Dany\u2019s second white coat looks to be made of suede, a lightweight animal skin akin to the soft, lightweight leather of Sansa\u2019s fish scale dress. They are also both side-laced in the front and have soft shoulders.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1967\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8f2f48a9f2ba5aff140463bc81ebd78e/tumblr_inline_pny8d2FmAp1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1967\"></figure><p>The promotional material also revealed another point of similarity. Daenerys wears a red silk scarf tied in an ascot when she arrives in Winterfell and she wears it with the suede coat as well - and in the trailer we see Sansa wearing a silk ascot in either black or a midnight blue. I\u2019m very curious to what this could possibly mean. Since Sansa wears one of her season 7 costumes in the arrival scene this means that the silk ascot is mainly connected to Daenerys\u2019 character. Does this mean that Sansa is emulating Dany? It is certainly possible. However, what does this mean? Especially since Sophie Turner has stated that Sansa is done emulating other characters in her style.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2042\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c2a6abddea0e4dd09b529eac56851743/tumblr_inline_pny8dsNQRb1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2042\"></figure><p>It could be a way for Sansa to signal that these two women are on the same side in the war against the dead. It could function as a sign that Sansa is trying to be diplomatic in a difficult situation (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183246013149/sansa-has-a-blue-silk-ascot-tied-like-danys-in\">x</a>). That is a <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist\">Watsonian</a> explanation. However, there\u2019s also the possibility that Clapton has made this choice for Doylist reasons - to signal both a similarities and differences between the two characters since the colours are quite different. While their scarves are of the same material and are tied in the same way - the differences in colour create very different effects. Sansa\u2019s dark ascot almost merges with the rest of her costume. It doesn\u2019t draw attention to itself visually whereas it is the completely opposite situation with Dany\u2019s ascot since the red silk stands in a glaring contrast to the white costume.</p><p>Despite the surface differences between the costumes of these two characters, I do think that it is important to look at them in relation to each other because these two women are finally going to interact and Clapton likes to express the nature of such relationships through the costuming. In season 3, she expressed Cersei and Margaery\u2019s simmering feud through costumes that were radically different in colour and cut (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/179909400489/the-rose-of-highgarden-on-margaery-tyrell-part\">x</a>). She also talks about Dany and Cersei\u2019s season 7 costumes in terms of a sartorial\u00a0\u201cstandoff\u201d that echoes the political power play between them and though their costumes look quite different, there\u2019s a similarity in the severity of the silhouettes as well as the symbolic values of the their jewellery:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201c<i>You can see in the way [Dany is] dressing that <b>she\u2019s almost assuming the power but not quite</b>. With <b>all the colors and the details and the essence </b>\u2014 <b>it just becomes stronger</b>. The width of the shoulders give her strength, the chain gives her strength. I tried to make the <b>cut of the costumes just slightly more like a uniform</b> and almost less feminine. This is the time when it\u2019s all really going to matter, and so</i>\u00a0<b>there\u2019s</b> <b>a power play between her and Cersei. It\u2019s like a standoff</b>. And I think they\u2019ve both reached a place where it\u2019s not about femininity, it\u2019s about their strength as women.</i>\u201d (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.thisisinsider.com/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-2017-6\">Insider</a>)</p><p>\u201c<i>I knew so instantly how Cersei should be, looking back at the arc of her story and her relationship with her father. I always try to make the clothes visually tell something \u2013 she said very little in that whole scene. I think you could tell it was based on her father\u2019s costume\u2026there were so many elements to it, I loved it. Then <b>to</b> <b>pare down the crown into just simple strokes that to me looked like a lion still,</b> that\u2019s what they\u2019re meant to be,<b> but without that sort of solid heraldic lion that she\u2019s usually worn</b>. I quite liked the idea that it was a move away from that. <b>Which then ties into Dany, the way they look at each other later on</b>.</i>\u201d (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://blog.fidmmuseum.org/museum/2018/09/interview-with-game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton.html\">FIDM Museum</a>)<br></p></blockquote><p>It will be interesting to see how the interactions between Sansa and Daenerys will unfold because there will most likely be emotional complications and political tensions - so, in my opinion, it makes perfect sense to view the their costumes in terms of a sartorial stand-off because while Dany has come to help the North, she\u2019s also demanding their fealty despite their strong wish for independence - and Sansa might not be thrilled that Jon has promised to send their long-suffering people into yet another bloody war after the fight against the Dead.\u00a0</p><p>On the other hand, Dany is not used to any of her followers or lovers having emotional ties to any other people than her. She\u2019s used to being the center of their world (just look at Jorah, Daario, etc.), and Jon has a family that he loves dearly and while Arya is his favorite sister, he has a bond with Sansa that is special because they were the ones that won back Winterfell together. They have been political partners for a while and despite their quarrels, they love each other dearly. Dany simply isn\u2019t used to having to compete for the attention of her followers - Jon has a family that he loves, he\u2019s a leader who has his people to answer to and Dany is not the center of his world, like she is to most of her followers who are rootless people that have made her their world.</p><h2><b>A CLASH OF QUEENS</b></h2><p>During season 7, the show has presented Sansa, Daenerys and Cersei as either parallels or foils to each other - in terms of leadership - and that is reflected in the costumes, which was a conscious decision on the part of Clapton:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThe women has become\u2026 they\u2019ve always been important but they\u2019ve become so much more dominant - and <b>I love playing the interplay between the women left.</b>\u201d</i> (Michele Clapton,<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dccmXw0YpJU&amp;t=9s\"> IGN Live SDCC 2016</a>)<br></p></blockquote><p>I\u2019m not the first to notice how Clapton created several correspondences between the costumes of Cersei, Daenerys and Sansa in the last season - some details were rather subtle while other details are more obvious. <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myHfbeJjjc8bFgVOAD6sAmg\">@jonsalways</a> has written a <a href=\"https://jonsalways.tumblr.com/post/167586483239/the-3-queens-of-westeros-a-costume-meta\">post</a> comparing the costumes of the three women and <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> has also explored the similarities and differences in the costuming (you can read them <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/181902464977/a-ladys-armor-part-3\">here</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/182085659532/a-ladys-armor-part-4\">here</a>).</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/99dc206e3a57fb82da2f176eaf580faa/tumblr_inline_pos2z1tT331uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\"></figure><p>A common element of all three women is the bleak and militaristic quality of their costumes:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s war coming. Everything\u2019s quite muted and quite bleak. <b>I think it\u2019s important for the four women left to have a very strong\u2014it\u2019s not masculine, there\u2019s still a femininity to it\u2014but there\u2019s a sort of hardening. Each one of them has been through such a journey, so I tried to reflect that in their costumes</b>. For instance, Sansa: she\u2019s been abused, raped, and had the most horrific things happen to her, so I liked the idea that she\u2019s encased in her costume. No one is gonna get into her, no one is gonna get near her. It is an armor. She\u2019s laced and then she has the belt, which I really particularly like, which goes up and around her body. Everything is really controlled. <b>I\u2019ve also shortened the length of the dresses on Cersei and Sansa because I want there to be a practicality. </b>The way the women are arriving in the north, they\u2019re beginning to fight and realize they have to be equal. <b>They have to fight for survival. I had to get rid of all the unnecessary.</b> With Dany, the colors have gotten darker but there is a red creeping in, her house color. Slowly we\u2019re trying to move them into their own individual looks. It\u2019s practical. It\u2019s war. <b>The time isn\u2019t for pretty dresses. Jewelry isn\u2019t worn to be attractive. It\u2019s worn to represent your house or your stature or your intent.</b> This is the direction I have to go in now.\u201d</i> (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a12097061/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-interview/\">Harper\u2019s Bazaar</a>)<br></p></blockquote><p>Firstly, all three women wear dark colours - charcoal and black - to signify mourning as well as the fact that winter and war has come to the shores of Westeros. Secondly, the costumes of all three women have an armoured look, which is expressed in different ways according to their individual narrative journeys. Cersei wears actual armour in the form of steel pauldrons whereas the silhouette of Dany\u2019s costumes with the extended shoulders not only references the style of her late brother Viserys but also evoke the armour of the Unsullied, which signify her role as their commander. She is here to make war. Sansa\u2019s armour is her belt that not only binds her waist tightly but also encases her torso with extra cross straps, metaphorically protecting herself from the touch of others.</p><p>Another common theme is the way that the three women\u2019s costumes reference the men in the men in their families - Cersei\u2019s coronation dress is a deliberate nod to the style of her father Tywin whose approval she always sought be never got (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183521407024/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">x</a>). Dany\u2019s style is inspired by her brother Viserys, the man who abused her but whose ambition she is finally about to realize (<a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/179678685367/fire-and-blood\">x</a>) and Sansa\u2019s costumes not only reference her father Eddard but also her mother Catelyn (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183300013819/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">x</a>) as well as her half-brother Jon (<a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/181846188337/a-ladys-armor-part-2\">x</a>) and her sister Arya (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183521407024/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">x</a>).</p><p>One commonality between all the different costumes are the emphasis on the shoulders, either through extended shoulder tabs, actual armour and/or beading.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3264\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/881d3a90960611482c3fef8c2e06200c/tumblr_inline_pny8jm2gcT1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3264\"></figure><p>There are, however, some specific costume elements that converse with each other beyond a general militaristic look and dark colours. Sansa and Cersei\u2019s hems have been shortened for practicality. Unlike Cersei, both Sansa and Dany incorporate fur into their look - Sansa with her fur cape and Dany with fur lining and an elaborate fur coat. Both Dany and Cersei use elaborate beading on some of their costumes - but whereas Cersei\u2019s opulent beaded pieces signals a brittleness to her strength evoked through the use of glass, Dany\u2019s beaded shoulder pieces evinces a jagged hardness that has carried over from the end of season 6 - and in general, the more ornate and\u00a0\u201chard\u201d her dragon scales become, the more powerful she is (<a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/articles/game-of-thrones-embroiderer-michele-carragher-talks-dragons-and-dresses-sb\">x</a>).\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"391\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c85367cebf2efb097226721f6644e888/tumblr_inline_pos2y0bZyW1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"391\"></figure><p>One interesting point of comparison are the stylistic similarities between the backs of Cersei\u2019s Dragonpit costume and Dany\u2019s white fur coat. Both of these costumes feature a kind of animal \u201cspine\u201d - Clapton refers to Cersei\u2019s as a\u00a0\u201cstinger\u201d and Dany\u2019s\u00a0\u201cspine\u201d resembles dragon scales, evoking the animals that she is so closely associated with.</p><p>Their accessories also converse with each other - as the Clapton quotes in the previous section prove. Sansa\u2019s chain refers back to an earlier one, and it is linked not only to her tutelage under Baelish\u2019 aegis (the chain) but also to her sister Arya (the Needle). Now it is a bit more formal, attached to her belt, which reflect her position as Lady of Winterfell.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1352\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e9010cca75b8ff60af7296f8b3e3c103/tumblr_inline_pny8ix6asl1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1352\"></figure><p>Dany\u2019s chain represents her ambition - Clapton calls it a\u00a0\u201cchain of intent\u201d, the intent being the conquest of the Iron Throne. Since Dany isn\u2019t actually Queen yet, Clapton withheld a crown from her costume. Dany\u2019s chain features the sigil of her House, the three-headed dragon, and in that sense it echoes Cersei\u2019s crown, which is an abstract rendering of a lion, the sigil of House Lannister. However, Cersei also wears chains - and they are connected to her armour, i.e. the pauldrons she wears with her coronation dress. In that sense, these chains echoes Sansa\u2019s necklace where the chain is fastened to her belt, which functions as Sansa\u2019s armour.</p><p>Will the costumes of Cersei, Sansa and Daenerys continue to converse with each other in season 8? Based on the limited material we have so far, I\u2019ll say\u00a0\u201cYes\u201d. While there are significant changes in style, there are still elements from season 7 that carries over in the new season. However, it is a bit difficult to determine the extent of this sartorial\u00a0\u201cconversation\u201d, especially since we only have images of one of Sansa\u2019s new costumes as compared to images of two new costumes for Cersei and three new costumes for Dany.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e7ca07f142e559e73f3cad6f786ce15f/tumblr_inline_pny8ntgJew1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\"></figure><p>So what we infer for the available visual material? Firstly, the dark colours are still there. Secondly, they still have their various forms of armour - Cersei has her pauldrons, Sansa her belt and Dany the extended shoulders. Cersei\u2019s \u201cstinger\u201d has moved to the front of her costumes and Dany\u2019s dragon\u00a0\u201cspine\u201d has now been split into wings (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183277978864/a-bad-fit-some-thoughts-on-daenerys-targaryens\">x</a>).\u00a0</p><p>Another common element that has been retained is the use of chains in the costumes of all three women. Daenerys still wears her\u00a0\u201cchain of intent\u201d even though she\u2019s taking pains to partially cover the three-headed dragon with her hair, probably in an effort not to look too intimidating, too Targaryen in the North (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/181842464629/a-bad-fit-some-thoughts-on-daenerys\">x</a>). Cersei has also retained the chains that link to her pauldrons, only now she has added the lion pendant that she wore in season 1.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1088\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c68590a9c1e91f284764ec3501140e50/tumblr_inline_pny8wcAg451uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1088\"></figure><p>Sansa has also retained her Needle necklace and chain that attaches to her belt from season 7. What is interesting in this context is the fact that the symbolism and iconography of Sansa\u2019s chain/necklace is purely personal - as opposed to the chains that the two other women wear, which feature the heraldic sigils of their respective Houses. This has prompted <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> and I to discuss whether Clapton will incorporate the Stark direwolf into Sansa\u2019s chain/jewellery later in the season (she talks about this aspect <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/183747085887/sansa-costume-speculation\">here</a>).</p><p>While the promotional images show us that all three women sill still wear costumes in dark colours, the images also revealed that colour is coming back, at least in Dany\u2019s and Cersei\u2019s costumes so far. And it is very interesting that it is a colour that they both share: Red!</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1515\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/45ffabeeaef6a636528f99d132480bfd/tumblr_inline_pny91wUkDI1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1515\"></figure><p>While Clapton primarily used dark colours last season to signal that war and winter is here, she didn\u2019t abandon the use of colour completely. In fact, she introduced the colour red in Dany\u2019s costumes for the first time ever, something that fans have been waiting for since the very first season.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i><b>I wanted this season to close down colour-wise, except that Dany now she\u2019s just getting a little bit of red coming into her costume</b>, she\u2019s finally claimed her throne\u2026 well, <b>she\u2019s on her way to claiming her throne</b>.</i>\u00a0(Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.thisisinsider.com/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-2017-6\">Insider</a>)<br></p></blockquote><p>The very fact that Clapton closed down the colour in general makes the inclusion of a discrete red in Dany\u2019s costumes even more significant - and from the looks of these photos, the red is becoming much more prominent in Dany\u2019s costumes at the same time as Cersei is returning to the Lannister red.</p><h2><b>BLACK - WHITE - RED</b></h2><p>While I\u2019ve looked at the similarities between the costumes of the female leaders, the promotional material also show us some rather significant differences, especially when it comes to the use of colour. Thus, Dany\u2019s white-red coats stand in stark contrast to Sansa\u2019s black leather and Cersei\u2019s deep red velvet.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3d961ddaaa6c986dcb31f27d06573e90/tumblr_inline_pny93wjIrV1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\"></figure><p>What do these dominant colours mean to each woman? In order to answer this question we have to take a closer look at the sometimes idiosyncratic manner in which Clapton uses colour in the narrative arcs of the different women.\u00a0</p><p><b>Black/Blue (Sansa)</b></p><p>When it comes to the colour black, Clapton generally uses it to denote mourning, which I discussed in the previous <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183521407024/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">essay</a> of this series. However, the use of black in Sansa\u2019s costumes goes beyond mourning. Her infamous raven dress marks the first time she wears black but it also marks a major stylistic transformation as well as being a statement of agency on Sansa\u2019s part - I\u2019ve discussed all of these aspects in the previous post.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1515\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5dc16cf6ded09f5267fadd484cd3c030/tumblr_inline_pp16tl5nFe1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1515\"></figure><p>Black isn\u2019t really a colour that is closely associated with Sansa - she only wore it at the end of season 4 and in the beginning of season 5. She has only had three black costumes prior to the new leather dress. In some ways, introducing black into Sansa\u2019s costumes feels a bit like a step back, mainly because it is a colour that she wore when she was under the thumb of Petyr Baelish but also because she wore it just before she came to suffer the most severe sexual, physical and emotional abuse that she has ever been subjected to. Sansa wore black just before her narrative took the darkest possible turn.</p><p>So why does Clapton return to the colour black with Sansa in season 8? First of all, this is most likely not Sansa\u2019s only costume and hardly her endgame costume. The armour-like scaling as well as the <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183300013819/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">transitional silhouette</a>, leads me to believe that this is a mid-season costume, related to the war against the Dead. In this sense, it would be useful to go back as see what Clapton said about the raven dress, which boils down to Transformation and Strength!</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201c<b>When she comes down the stairs</b>, she\u2019s playing with it like, \u2018<b>This is me, taking control of this situation</b>.\u2019\u201d </i>(Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thecut.com%2F2014%2F12%2Fstyle-to-expect-when-game-of-thrones-returns.html&amp;t=YTUwODI0YTFlZGRmZjQ4M2JmZTFmYWMwNDM1ZjdiNmM3NGMxYzM5ZCxaMGdLU2FadA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183118735354%2Farmoured-in-scales-some-thoughts-on-sansa&amp;m=1\">The Cut</a>) <br></p><p><i>David and Dan came to me with <b>the idea of a transformation for Sansa</b>.

Plus, <b>in general, Clapton uses the darker colours to signify strength when it comes to the female characters.</b></p><p><b>There is, however, also a curious sensual aspect to this costume</b>, which is an entirely new element to Sansa\u2019s costuming (apart from the plunging neckline of the raven dress). The photos reveal that <b>it is made from soft and glossy leather, which lends the whole outfit a sort slinky quality</b>. Though <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183300013819/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">it mimics the Tully leather armour</a>, this dress isn\u2019t thick or stiff - and though it retains the tight-laced silhouette from season 7 with the belt that is Sansa\u2019s emotional armour, <b>the soft and glossy leather practically invites a touch</b>. This is a curious dichotomy: <b><i>a tightly laced and armoured body, wrapped a glossy material that draws attention to itself (by reflecting light), a material that looks so soft that you\u2019re tempted to touch.\u00a0</i></b></p><p>In the photos we have of Sansa\u2019s new costume, there\u2019s a noted bluish iridescence to piece. However, it is hard to tell whether this bluish tint is simply an effect of reflected light and/or Photoshop - or whether the leather is perhaps a deep midnight blue rather than all black. It isn\u2019t really something we can determine until we get better photos and see the costume on the screen. However, I have made an edit comparing two different photos of Sansa\u2019s dress to Cersei\u2019s black silk dress from season 7 since it\u2019s shiny fabric also reflects light.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dbfb6f973022abaa8cf18dd876559a67/tumblr_inline_poqoydigVd1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\"></figure><p>Sansa\u2019s dress does seem more blue-tinted than Cersei\u2019s black silk - but I cannot discount this as an effect of Photoshop. The reason I bring up this issue is because blue is a colour that is very much connected to Sansa Stark. Clapton has always used blue for House Stark:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>We have a lot of <b>blues and grays</b>, murkier colors that seemed right for the harsh <b>northern climates</b>. The Starks represent a warm family unit, so the blues of their costumes are rather warm. But within the family, the various personalities are reflected in what they wear. For example, Sansa is in a slightly cooler blue.</i> (<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fcostumevault.blogspot.com%2F2016%2F08%2Fcreating-seven-kingdoms-part-i-north.html&amp;t=ZjdjYmY0Yzg5Mjk3OWQ5NWU0NzdjNDZhZjI4MmViZDM0YTdhNzgxNCxvWWc4SXdmUA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182432528629%2Fwinterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-17&amp;m=1\">CostumeVault</a>) \n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>However, Sansa in particular has worn quite a few blue costumes (about 10 all in all). In the early seasons, she was very much associated with very light blue colours, which denote her youthful innocence. Interestingly, Margaery wears light blue as well - but in a calculated way - to affect an innocent girlishness that she doesn\u2019t possess (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/179909400489/the-rose-of-highgarden-on-margaery-tyrell-part\">x</a>). Cersei has also worn a light blue dress at her most fragile moments in season 1 and 2.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1009\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0d7643a386ed842ca5310788f417d577/tumblr_inline_pp18ouboAQ1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1009\"></figure><p>Thus, Michele Clapton generally uses a pale blue colour to signal youthful innocence as well as fragility - and the innocence of youth is indeed a fragile thing. Over the course of the seasons, Sansa starts to wear darker blues - like the dark greyish-blue cloak she wears in season 4-6 and the vibrant teal dress she wears when she sets out to reclaim her home with Jon Snow.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3264\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/71042373afdd34c1a9f05f5e615dfe49/tumblr_inline_pnyh1iR8pu1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3264\"></figure><p>These darker blues takes Sansa closer to the adult Starks - both Ned and Catelyn sometimes wore dark blues, though only Catelyn has worn teal before Sansa. In this context, it is indeed possible that Sansa\u2019s new leather dress isn\u2019t pure black but a midnight blue so deep that it is almost black. However, this is at present highly speculative since we need more and better visual material to\u00a0 make a final pronouncement. However, since colour is creeping black into Cersei and Dany\u2019s costumes - I do think that we\u2019ll see a dark, vibrant blue return in Sansa\u2019s endgame costumes.</p><p><b>White/Red (Daenerys)</b></p><p>Apart from Sansa\u2019s second wedding gown from season 5, Daenerys is the only female character who has worn white - and she\u2019s the only one who has consistently worn white.

It is fascinating that Clapton also relates the use of white with Daenerys feeling like she has a divine right (to what she wants) and that she is beyond question, which is an incredibly dangerous thing for a ruler to think.\u00a0</p><h2>When it comes to Daenerys, white is connected to her being powerful, untouchable, remote and almost god-like.</h2><p>This certainly sounds very impressive but all of these things signals a person that is both lonely and too powerful for her own good. Being extraordinary and god-like might sound nice but it also removes her from the rest of humanity.</p><p>Daenerys wears darker colours in season 6 and most of season 7 - so it is note-worthy when she switches back to white in the middle of season 7 when she flies north of the Wall wearing a show-stopping white fur coat. It is, as mentioned before, a warrior look - but it is also a look connected to her infatuation with Jon:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201c<b>It was the first time</b> that I could remember <b>that Dany had put herself in danger that is not necessarily for personal gain</b>, so <b>the white was this sense of purity</b>,\u201d said costume designer Clapton (a three-time Emmy winner for \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and last year\u2019s winner for \u201cThe Crown\u201d). \u201c<b>It had an honesty to it\u2026she has fallen in love with Jon</b>.\u201d</i> (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2018/08/game-of-thrones-season-7-dany-costume-production-design-hbo-emmys-1201994086/\">IndieWire</a>)<br></p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1552\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe6983281bac87a890c1b89f05bbfb80/tumblr_inline_pos5rhw6yS1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1552\"></figure><p>Yet even here Dany can\u2019t escape the dehumanizing effect of the way that Clapton uses white in her costumes:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nClapton equated the visual importance of Dany\u2019s white coat with mythology. \u201cI wanted to create <b>this powerful image of her</b> descending <b>like an Angel</b> to save these men from imminent death,\u201d she said.</i> (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2018/08/game-of-thrones-season-7-dany-costume-production-design-hbo-emmys-1201994086/\">IndieWire</a>)<br></p></blockquote><p>The visual effect was dazzling with the pale, silver-haired woman wearing pure white in a landscape of snow and ice.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"300\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4a94e7292f9b8947ff481854dea4c0ac/tumblr_inline_pp1lce3mU81uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"300\"></figure><p>She looks ethereal - but not very human either - and the colour white is indeed very ambiguous in relation to Dany\u2019s narrative arc as Clapton\u2019s comments reveals.\u00a0<br></p><p>The promotional material reveals that Daenerys retains the white in some of her new costumes - but with one very important difference: the addition of the colour red, which becomes very conspicuous when compared to the white.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1009\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/212c1c10eb76e243c680d5ecfecf129c/tumblr_inline_pos5t41Lum1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1009\"></figure><p>Red is one of the traditional colours of House Targaryen and Clapton has withheld it until season 7 for narrative reasons.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThis season seemed to be the <b>right time for Daenerys to start to embrace the shape and colours of her house</b>,\u201d Clapton told HuffPost in an email. \u201c<b>She is in touching distance of her desired place \u2026 so I liked this flowering</b>, this <b>visual expression of her growing confidence</b> that she could maybe take the throne.\u201d</i> (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.huffpostbrasil.com/entry/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-explains-danys-meaningful-outfits_us_59a4319fe4b06d67e33926b6?ec_carp=8265756527327536922\">Huffpost</a>)<br></p></blockquote><p>However, Clapton really uses red in a very loaded way when it comes to Dany because it not just her House colour, it is also a outward sign of her hunger for power in the form of the Iron Throne.\u00a0This is an ambition that she adopted from her brother Viserys, so when Dany wear\u2019s red it also refers to her late brother:</p><blockquote><p>\u201c<i>When we see her now, <b>she\u2019s starting to wear the colors of her brother.

Just notice how vivid the red is in the unedited/unfiltered pic!

When her power begins to wane, then the red recedes from her costumes:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\n\u201cCersei is pulling back a little bit.

The trailer showed us that she has a black costume, which she\u2019ll most likely wear in the early episodes, so I\u2019m very curious as to when Cersei switches back to the Lannister-red, which signals power.\u00a0</p><p>A lot of this analysis is speculative because we don\u2019t know the context of these costumes. When are they going to be worn? How do they fit with all the new costumes for each character? It is especially frustrating to speculate about Sansa\u2019s leather dress because this is the only new costume of hers that they\u2019ve released images of. We\u2019ve gotten more material about Dany and Cersei\u2019s new costumes - but so little about how Clapton is going to shape Sansa\u2019s look in this final season.</p><p>(GIF not mine)</p></p>",

This year, the excitement was even bigger because Sophie Turner had let slip that Sansa\u2019s would be wearing armour in the final season of the show (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183300013819/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">x</a>).\u00a0However, the promotional photos revealed a costume that isn\u2019t actual armour but more of a warrior look in a symbolic sense, which fits well with another thing Turner said about Sansa\u2019s arc in the last season:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201cWe the idea of it being very protective and she buttons herself up,\u201d Turner says. \u201cI wanted her to have a bit of armor and be a bit more warrior like. <b>She\u2019s like the warrior of Winterfell</b>.\u201d</i> (Sophie Turner, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Few.com%2Ftv%2F2019%2F02%2F20%2Fsophie-turner-sansa-armor-game-thrones-season-8%2F&amp;t=ZWJjMDlhNzgxMGVkZTcyY2M4ZDBiYjY5NjU0ZDliNGYwNDJkNWU1NyxaMGdLU2FadA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183118735354%2Farmoured-in-scales-some-preliminary-thoughts-on&amp;m=1\">EW</a>) \n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>This battle dress of black leather is the only one of Sansa\u2019s new costumes that we\u2019ve gotten a preview of so far - whereas we\u2019ve gotten a look at two new costumes for Cersei and three for Daenerys.\u00a0</p><p>This new costume does have a warrior look. In <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183300013819/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">Part 1</a> of this series of essays, I took a closer look at the texture of this costume, especially in relation to the leather armour of House Tully. In <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183521407024/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">Part 2</a>, I discussed how this textured leather dress evokes a couple of Sansa\u2019s earlier costumes as well as the similarities and differences it has with Cersei\u2019s iconic coronation dress, which is also made of black leather. In this final post, I\u2019ll explore how Sansa\u2019s new leather costume might function both as an equivalent to and a juxtaposition of the warrior look that Daenerys debuted in season 7 and carries over into season 8.</p>[[MORE]]<h2><b>A WARRIOR LOOK</b></h2><p>While Sansa\u2019s new costume isn\u2019t a functional armour, it strongly evokes the traditional Tully armour, which is made of overlapping leather flaps. This could be a significant political statement as I discussed in <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183300013819/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">Part 1</a> of this series. The new costume incorporates a couple of older elements like the tight leather belt with the cross-straps that envelop Sansa\u2019s torso. The belt functions as a kind of emotional armour for Sansa in season 7:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201cWith one of the key pieces this year, <b>I wanted it to look as if she was actually sewn or laced into her dress\u2014like there was no way in. </b>So I designed a belt that comes around the neck, across the chest and around the waist. <b>She\u2019s trying to protect herself</b> from all the awfulness that\u2019s happened.<b> It\u2019s a form of armor.</b> It will be interesting to see how that moves forward.\u201d </i>(Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elle.com%2Fculture%2Fmovies-tv%2Fnews%2Fa47144%2Fgame-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-easter-eggs%2F&amp;t=N2JmYTE0NWIwMTAyMWY1ODBhM2NlMzY5YzAwMzk4MjQyNzNlZGM3YSxaMGdLU2FadA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183300013819%2Fa-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks&amp;m=1\">Elle</a>)\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>Retaining this belt indicates that Sansa still feels the need to protect herself emotionally - but when it is coupled with a dress that not only resembles the the Tully armour but also evokes an earlier dress that was meant to signify both transformation and strength (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183521407024/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">Part 2</a>), it shifts the symbolism of the entire costume. Sansa also wears the necklace that was introduced at the end of season 4 and modified in season 7:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>For Sansa, <b>the chain that she wears, the needle on the end represents her Needle, her way of fighting back</b>. It\u2019s a small version of the Needle Arya has. </i>(Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a12097061/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-interview/\">Harper\u2019s Bazaar</a>)<br></p></blockquote><p>This necklace signals that she\u2019s fighting back - it is an offensive element to the defensive position that the belt signifies. However, combining these elements with an armour-like dress on the eve of battle signals both an image of strength as the Lady of Winterfell as well as the fact that all will have to resist the threat of the White Walkers, whether they fight physically or in other ways.\u00a0In the show, female characters don\u2019t need to be warriors in the physical sense to wear armour.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"996\" data-orig-height=\"630\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d2d523001110f77b11ae4a0dc4e866ea/tumblr_inline_poq3bjK0zY1uklhai_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"996\" data-orig-height=\"630\"></figure><p>In season 2, Clapton put Cersei Lannister in armour during the Battle of the Blackwater, both to signal that she was feeling threatened but also to signal that she had leadership role within the Red Keep where she was supposed to rally the spirits of the women. It was a role that she completely abdicated, which led to Sansa stepping in and doing Cersei\u2019s job (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/176205607679/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-10\">x</a>) - something that could very well have been a foreshadowing of Sansa\u2019s filling a similar role during the upcoming Battle of Winterfell in season 8.</p><p>In the last episode of season 6, Cersei dons armour again, this time in the form of steel pauldrons.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"960\" data-orig-height=\"816\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/29278d9b53416a15f3912ae14af7ba90/tumblr_inline_poq3hoP0BS1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"960\" data-orig-height=\"816\"></figure><p>It is a look that she repeats in season 7 where she also debuts yet another new warrior look in the final episode:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2562\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e101b244ef63065320c285c1ea1a347f/tumblr_inline_poq3lwZW4L1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2562\"></figure><p>While Cersei has ditched the steel pauldrons, she\u2019s wearing a close-fitting dress with a texture that resembles chain-mail. It a less visually aggressive look than her use of the pauldrons or the armoured corselet but it is a warrior look nonetheless.</p><h2><b>ANIMAL TEXTURES</b></h2><p>Sansa\u2019s new battle dress reminds me of another female warrior look - the white fur coat that Daenerys Targaryen wore in season 7. Though these two costumes look completely different on the surface (white vs black, fur vs leather), they do share one significant aspect: The fact that the surface textures of the two costumes resemble different kinds of animal skin. Sansa\u2019s leather dress evokes fish scales and Dany\u2019s fur coat is meant to evoke dragon skin:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cI guess to some extent the <b>ribbed effect</b> created by the construction has the <b>feel of a dragon\u2019s skin</b>.</i>\u201d \u00a0(Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vanityfair.com%2Fhollywood%2F2017%2F08%2Fgame-of-thrones-daenerys-coat-michele-clapton-interview-viserys&amp;t=ZjdhMDNjYmU5Y2JlM2Q5ZjlhZWI2MjAzNzE5NDQ0MDNlNTcwNTk5ZCxaMGdLU2FadA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183118735354%2Farmoured-in-scales-some-thoughts-on-sansa&amp;m=1\">Vanity Fair</a>)<br></p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7ad50d44819a304724ad21526f55535c/tumblr_inline_pny848QkTR1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\"></figure><p>Furthermore, both looks are warrior looks, signalling that these two women are ready to fight for what they want:</p><blockquote><p><i>Dany is <b>elevating her look to that of warrior queen</b>, with the beautiful silver dragon chain completing the look.\u201d</i> (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vanityfair.com%2Fhollywood%2F2017%2F08%2Fgame-of-thrones-daenerys-coat-michele-clapton-interview-viserys&amp;t=ZjdhMDNjYmU5Y2JlM2Q5ZjlhZWI2MjAzNzE5NDQ0MDNlNTcwNTk5ZCxaMGdLU2FadA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183118735354%2Farmoured-in-scales-some-thoughts-on-sansa&amp;m=1\">Vanity Fair</a>) <br></p><p><i>\u201cI wanted to define Dany\u2019s shape by cutting into and shaping the fur.

Not only do they share the texture of animal skins but in season 7 Michele Clapton consciously chose to have Dany and Sansa\u2019s accessories echo each other even though the two women had never shared a scene together.</p><blockquote><p>\u201c<i><b>Dany and Sansa\u2019s accessories echo each other</b>\u2014and also come from unexpected sources. \u201c<b>We see them facing each other, really.</b> <b>We see the dynamics of this.</b> It\u2019s funny because it comes from different backgrounds. For Sansa, the chain that she wears, the needle on the end represents her Needle, her way of fighting back. It\u2019s a small version of the Needle Arya has. But the chain in a weird way is an influence from Littlefinger.<b> </b>He always used to wear accouterments for his job chained to his coat on a fine chain, and then a mockingbird sigil at his neck. <b>So I was trying to collate all the people who influenced her\u2014whether she likes them or not</b>. There\u2019s a<b> real formality about her chain</b> and the [way] the circle is positioned and looped. That\u2019s very much Littlefinger. <b>With Dany, she is trying to impress that she is the queen in ranking but she can\u2019t wear a crown, so it\u2019s just a huge statement piece of intent\u2014it\u2019s a chain of intent. Visually they play off each other.</b> Whereas Cersei has a look and I think we\u2019ll see in Episode 7 there\u2019s a definite shift.</i>\u201d (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.harpersbazaar.com%2Fculture%2Ffilm-tv%2Fa12097061%2Fgame-of-thrones-costume-designer-interview%2F&amp;t=MTc2NjkzY2Y5YTVhOGRlYTc3MDIwMDM2OWE2OGI2ZDY1NWVlYjM1NixaMGdLU2FadA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183118735354%2Farmoured-in-scales-some-thoughts-on-sansa&amp;m=1\">Harpers Bazaar</a>)<br></p></blockquote><p>This is actually quite significant, especially since Daenerys and Sansa will enter each other\u2019s narratives in season 8. In this respect, it is interesting that Clapton has chosen to retain Dany\u2019s white furred warrior look but with significant and meaningful updates, especially the inclusion of the Targaryen red which was absent from the season 7 costume (I\u2019ve written about this costume <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/181842464629/a-bad-fit-some-thoughts-on-daenerys\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183277978864/a-bad-fit-some-thoughts-on-daenerys-targaryens\">here</a>).</p><p>In this context, one could argue that Sansa\u2019s new battle dress is not just a costume that reflects the upcoming war but also a kind of sartorial answer to Daenerys\u2019 white furred warrior look - a look that incorporates the Targaryen red, a dragon skin texture as well as dragon scale beading on the shoulders.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3030\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5b74a6e9eb1ab71f58a8f9f22b482337/tumblr_inline_pny87ysy3b1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3030\"></figure><p>On the other hand, Sansa\u2019s fish scale armour not only refers to her mother\u2019s heritage but quite possibly also to a political alliance with her mother\u2019s family, House Tully. While Sansa doesn\u2019t wear her fur cloak in these promotional photos, I think it is very likely that we\u2019ll see her wearing her Stark furs with this new dress on the show - and this combination would refer both her mother\u2019s heritage, which Clapton has repeatedly invoked through the textures of her season 7 costumes while the fur cloak with the cross-straps refers to her Stark identity, her authority as Lady of Winterfell and the memory of her father.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201dWithin each of their costumes, there are influences. [\u2026] Sansa\u2019s are part father, part mother.<b> It\u2019s her father\u2019s silhouette with the fur, her mother\u2019s within</b>. <b>The textures are very much from her mother</b>.\u201d\u00a0 (</i>Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/news/a47144/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-easter-eggs/\">Elle</a>)\n\n<br></p><p>\n\n\u201c<i>I think there is a cyclical movement, but also I think by introducing certain elements, like with Sansa and Littlefinger and<b> part of her mother\u2019s elements, it\u2019s still adapted into her</b>\u2014she wears<b> the fur on her shoulders and the cross-strap from Ned</b> [\u2026]</i>\u00a0(Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a12097061/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-interview/\">Harper\u2019s Bazaar</a>)<br></p></blockquote><p>Both of these women have adopted a warrior look that references both their personal journeys as well as their their families. Sansa\u2019s costumes refer to her mother\u2019s Tully heritage and her father\u2019s Stark identity whereas Daenerys\u2019 costumes refer to her Targaryen identity, which is a product of sibling incest (there\u2019s no melding of different families here).</p><p>The EW promotional photo shoot revealed another new costume of Dany\u2019s - though it took me a while to realize that it was a new one because it is very similar to the white and red fur coat. This new costume is still white with red fur trimmings but it looks to be made from suede - it is thus a fur-less version of Dany\u2019s white and red warrior look.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1967\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6b8790f080ef233cc1d5e398d43d7d64/tumblr_inline_pny8avMhNo1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1967\"></figure><p>What I find very interesting about this new costume is the effect that the suede along with the fur-trimmed ribbing creates, especially on the sleeves. Dany\u2019s new costume brings to mind the leathery and webbed wings of her dragons! This effect is specially noticeable in the profile view and <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> describes the effect as if\u00a0\u201c<i><a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/183447444897/the-three-queens-holding-back-in-costume-design\">a dragon wrapping its wings around itself</a></i>\n\n\u201c.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bfc13df9a52b3e5cd7f84c5bb9017a70/tumblr_inline_pp1qkivnCb1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\"></figure><p>This webbed wing effect also shows up in her other new costume - a charcoal outfit (probably a kind of coat dress) worn under a furred shrug with extended and beaded shoulders.</p><p>Another interesting aspect of this outfit is that while it lacks the militaristic aspect of the extended shoulders of her season 7 costumes, it is a more aggressively dragon-like than any of her other costumes, even though it lacks the beading that so far has been used to evoke dragon scales.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1608\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2ee0475298eb547f7e43f4a56095b651/tumblr_inline_pny8c3DqpY1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1608\"></figure><p>Firstly, the lack of the fur makes all the difference here. The fur softens the dragon-like webbing and scaling (as on the back of the season 7 fur coat). As we can see, the scale-like dragon-spine of her fur coat is retained in the suede coat. Leather trimmings have been added at the seams that create the webbing in a saw-tooth pattern that evokes the stitching on the season 7 coat but it has a more aggressive\u00a0\u201cfeel\u201d since it isn\u2019t an intrinsic effect of the sewing technique but an extra addition (and again not softened by fur).\u00a0</p><p>Dany\u2019s accessories are also rather dragon-like with this outfit. She wears her chain of intent - though her hair partially covers three dragon heads, the dragon spine of the chain is fully visible. Furthermore, in the profile shot it is clear that she wears a red silk sash, pleated to evoke dragon scales (it is probably the same sash that she wore in season 7).\u00a0</p><p>If Sansa\u2019s fish scale battle dress might be an answer to Daenerys\u2019 furred warrior look, then it is plausible that Dany\u2019s suede dragon wing coat might be an answer to Sansa\u2019s warrior look. Though the two costumes look different on the surface - their colours and textures are very different - the basic silhouettes as well as the materials are quite similar. Dany\u2019s second white coat looks to be made of suede, a lightweight animal skin akin to the soft, lightweight leather of Sansa\u2019s fish scale dress. They are also both side-laced in the front and have soft shoulders.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1967\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8f2f48a9f2ba5aff140463bc81ebd78e/tumblr_inline_pny8d2FmAp1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1967\"></figure><p>The promotional material also revealed another point of similarity. Daenerys wears a red silk scarf tied in an ascot when she arrives in Winterfell and she wears it with the suede coat as well - and in the trailer we see Sansa wearing a silk ascot in either black or a midnight blue. I\u2019m very curious to what this could possibly mean. Since Sansa wears one of her season 7 costumes in the arrival scene this means that the silk ascot is mainly connected to Daenerys\u2019 character. Does this mean that Sansa is emulating Dany? It is certainly possible. However, what does this mean? Especially since Sophie Turner has stated that Sansa is done emulating other characters in her style.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2042\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c2a6abddea0e4dd09b529eac56851743/tumblr_inline_pny8dsNQRb1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2042\"></figure><p>It could be a way for Sansa to signal that these two women are on the same side in the war against the dead. It could function as a sign that Sansa is trying to be diplomatic in a difficult situation (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183246013149/sansa-has-a-blue-silk-ascot-tied-like-danys-in\">x</a>). That is a <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist\">Watsonian</a> explanation. However, there\u2019s also the possibility that Clapton has made this choice for Doylist reasons - to signal both a similarities and differences between the two characters since the colours are quite different. While their scarves are of the same material and are tied in the same way - the differences in colour create very different effects. Sansa\u2019s dark ascot almost merges with the rest of her costume. It doesn\u2019t draw attention to itself visually whereas it is the completely opposite situation with Dany\u2019s ascot since the red silk stands in a glaring contrast to the white costume.</p><p>Despite the surface differences between the costumes of these two characters, I do think that it is important to look at them in relation to each other because these two women are finally going to interact and Clapton likes to express the nature of such relationships through the costuming. In season 3, she expressed Cersei and Margaery\u2019s simmering feud through costumes that were radically different in colour and cut (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/179909400489/the-rose-of-highgarden-on-margaery-tyrell-part\">x</a>). She also talks about Dany and Cersei\u2019s season 7 costumes in terms of a sartorial\u00a0\u201cstandoff\u201d that echoes the political power play between them and though their costumes look quite different, there\u2019s a similarity in the severity of the silhouettes as well as the symbolic values of the their jewellery:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201c<i>You can see in the way [Dany is] dressing that <b>she\u2019s almost assuming the power but not quite</b>. With <b>all the colors and the details and the essence </b>\u2014 <b>it just becomes stronger</b>. The width of the shoulders give her strength, the chain gives her strength. I tried to make the <b>cut of the costumes just slightly more like a uniform</b> and almost less feminine. This is the time when it\u2019s all really going to matter, and so</i>\u00a0<b>there\u2019s</b> <b>a power play between her and Cersei. It\u2019s like a standoff</b>. And I think they\u2019ve both reached a place where it\u2019s not about femininity, it\u2019s about their strength as women.</i>\u201d (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.thisisinsider.com/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-2017-6\">Insider</a>)</p><p>\u201c<i>I knew so instantly how Cersei should be, looking back at the arc of her story and her relationship with her father. I always try to make the clothes visually tell something \u2013 she said very little in that whole scene. I think you could tell it was based on her father\u2019s costume\u2026there were so many elements to it, I loved it. Then <b>to</b> <b>pare down the crown into just simple strokes that to me looked like a lion still,</b> that\u2019s what they\u2019re meant to be,<b> but without that sort of solid heraldic lion that she\u2019s usually worn</b>. I quite liked the idea that it was a move away from that. <b>Which then ties into Dany, the way they look at each other later on</b>.</i>\u201d (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://blog.fidmmuseum.org/museum/2018/09/interview-with-game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton.html\">FIDM Museum</a>)<br></p></blockquote><p>It will be interesting to see how the interactions between Sansa and Daenerys will unfold because there will most likely be emotional complications and political tensions - so, in my opinion, it makes perfect sense to view the their costumes in terms of a sartorial stand-off because while Dany has come to help the North, she\u2019s also demanding their fealty despite their strong wish for independence - and Sansa might not be thrilled that Jon has promised to send their long-suffering people into yet another bloody war after the fight against the Dead.\u00a0</p><p>On the other hand, Dany is not used to any of her followers or lovers having emotional ties to any other people than her. She\u2019s used to being the center of their world (just look at Jorah, Daario, etc.), and Jon has a family that he loves dearly and while Arya is his favorite sister, he has a bond with Sansa that is special because they were the ones that won back Winterfell together. They have been political partners for a while and despite their quarrels, they love each other dearly. Dany simply isn\u2019t used to having to compete for the attention of her followers - Jon has a family that he loves, he\u2019s a leader who has his people to answer to and Dany is not the center of his world, like she is to most of her followers who are rootless people that have made her their world.</p><h2><b>A CLASH OF QUEENS</b></h2><p>During season 7, the show has presented Sansa, Daenerys and Cersei as either parallels or foils to each other - in terms of leadership - and that is reflected in the costumes, which was a conscious decision on the part of Clapton:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThe women has become\u2026 they\u2019ve always been important but they\u2019ve become so much more dominant - and <b>I love playing the interplay between the women left.</b>\u201d</i> (Michele Clapton,<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dccmXw0YpJU&amp;t=9s\"> IGN Live SDCC 2016</a>)<br></p></blockquote><p>I\u2019m not the first to notice how Clapton created several correspondences between the costumes of Cersei, Daenerys and Sansa in the last season - some details were rather subtle while other details are more obvious. <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myHfbeJjjc8bFgVOAD6sAmg\">@jonsalways</a> has written a <a href=\"https://jonsalways.tumblr.com/post/167586483239/the-3-queens-of-westeros-a-costume-meta\">post</a> comparing the costumes of the three women and <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> has also explored the similarities and differences in the costuming (you can read them <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/181902464977/a-ladys-armor-part-3\">here</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/182085659532/a-ladys-armor-part-4\">here</a>).</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/99dc206e3a57fb82da2f176eaf580faa/tumblr_inline_pos2z1tT331uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\"></figure><p>A common element of all three women is the bleak and militaristic quality of their costumes:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s war coming. Everything\u2019s quite muted and quite bleak. <b>I think it\u2019s important for the four women left to have a very strong\u2014it\u2019s not masculine, there\u2019s still a femininity to it\u2014but there\u2019s a sort of hardening. Each one of them has been through such a journey, so I tried to reflect that in their costumes</b>. For instance, Sansa: she\u2019s been abused, raped, and had the most horrific things happen to her, so I liked the idea that she\u2019s encased in her costume. No one is gonna get into her, no one is gonna get near her. It is an armor. She\u2019s laced and then she has the belt, which I really particularly like, which goes up and around her body. Everything is really controlled. <b>I\u2019ve also shortened the length of the dresses on Cersei and Sansa because I want there to be a practicality. </b>The way the women are arriving in the north, they\u2019re beginning to fight and realize they have to be equal. <b>They have to fight for survival. I had to get rid of all the unnecessary.</b> With Dany, the colors have gotten darker but there is a red creeping in, her house color. Slowly we\u2019re trying to move them into their own individual looks. It\u2019s practical. It\u2019s war. <b>The time isn\u2019t for pretty dresses. Jewelry isn\u2019t worn to be attractive. It\u2019s worn to represent your house or your stature or your intent.</b> This is the direction I have to go in now.\u201d</i> (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a12097061/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-interview/\">Harper\u2019s Bazaar</a>)<br></p></blockquote><p>Firstly, all three women wear dark colours - charcoal and black - to signify mourning as well as the fact that winter and war has come to the shores of Westeros. Secondly, the costumes of all three women have an armoured look, which is expressed in different ways according to their individual narrative journeys. Cersei wears actual armour in the form of steel pauldrons whereas the silhouette of Dany\u2019s costumes with the extended shoulders not only references the style of her late brother Viserys but also evoke the armour of the Unsullied, which signify her role as their commander. She is here to make war. Sansa\u2019s armour is her belt that not only binds her waist tightly but also encases her torso with extra cross straps, metaphorically protecting herself from the touch of others.</p><p>Another common theme is the way that the three women\u2019s costumes reference the men in the men in their families - Cersei\u2019s coronation dress is a deliberate nod to the style of her father Tywin whose approval she always sought be never got (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183521407024/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">x</a>). Dany\u2019s style is inspired by her brother Viserys, the man who abused her but whose ambition she is finally about to realize (<a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/179678685367/fire-and-blood\">x</a>) and Sansa\u2019s costumes not only reference her father Eddard but also her mother Catelyn (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183300013819/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">x</a>) as well as her half-brother Jon (<a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/181846188337/a-ladys-armor-part-2\">x</a>) and her sister Arya (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183521407024/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">x</a>).</p><p>One commonality between all the different costumes are the emphasis on the shoulders, either through extended shoulder tabs, actual armour and/or beading.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3264\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/881d3a90960611482c3fef8c2e06200c/tumblr_inline_pny8jm2gcT1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3264\"></figure><p>There are, however, some specific costume elements that converse with each other beyond a general militaristic look and dark colours. Sansa and Cersei\u2019s hems have been shortened for practicality. Unlike Cersei, both Sansa and Dany incorporate fur into their look - Sansa with her fur cape and Dany with fur lining and an elaborate fur coat. Both Dany and Cersei use elaborate beading on some of their costumes - but whereas Cersei\u2019s opulent beaded pieces signals a brittleness to her strength evoked through the use of glass, Dany\u2019s beaded shoulder pieces evinces a jagged hardness that has carried over from the end of season 6 - and in general, the more ornate and\u00a0\u201chard\u201d her dragon scales become, the more powerful she is (<a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/articles/game-of-thrones-embroiderer-michele-carragher-talks-dragons-and-dresses-sb\">x</a>).\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"391\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c85367cebf2efb097226721f6644e888/tumblr_inline_pos2y0bZyW1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"391\"></figure><p>One interesting point of comparison are the stylistic similarities between the backs of Cersei\u2019s Dragonpit costume and Dany\u2019s white fur coat. Both of these costumes feature a kind of animal \u201cspine\u201d - Clapton refers to Cersei\u2019s as a\u00a0\u201cstinger\u201d and Dany\u2019s\u00a0\u201cspine\u201d resembles dragon scales, evoking the animals that she is so closely associated with.</p><p>Their accessories also converse with each other - as the Clapton quotes in the previous section prove. Sansa\u2019s chain refers back to an earlier one, and it is linked not only to her tutelage under Baelish\u2019 aegis (the chain) but also to her sister Arya (the Needle). Now it is a bit more formal, attached to her belt, which reflect her position as Lady of Winterfell.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1352\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e9010cca75b8ff60af7296f8b3e3c103/tumblr_inline_pny8ix6asl1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1352\"></figure><p>Dany\u2019s chain represents her ambition - Clapton calls it a\u00a0\u201cchain of intent\u201d, the intent being the conquest of the Iron Throne. Since Dany isn\u2019t actually Queen yet, Clapton withheld a crown from her costume. Dany\u2019s chain features the sigil of her House, the three-headed dragon, and in that sense it echoes Cersei\u2019s crown, which is an abstract rendering of a lion, the sigil of House Lannister. However, Cersei also wears chains - and they are connected to her armour, i.e. the pauldrons she wears with her coronation dress. In that sense, these chains echoes Sansa\u2019s necklace where the chain is fastened to her belt, which functions as Sansa\u2019s armour.</p><p>Will the costumes of Cersei, Sansa and Daenerys continue to converse with each other in season 8? Based on the limited material we have so far, I\u2019ll say\u00a0\u201cYes\u201d. While there are significant changes in style, there are still elements from season 7 that carries over in the new season. However, it is a bit difficult to determine the extent of this sartorial\u00a0\u201cconversation\u201d, especially since we only have images of one of Sansa\u2019s new costumes as compared to images of two new costumes for Cersei and three new costumes for Dany.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e7ca07f142e559e73f3cad6f786ce15f/tumblr_inline_pny8ntgJew1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\"></figure><p>So what we infer for the available visual material? Firstly, the dark colours are still there. Secondly, they still have their various forms of armour - Cersei has her pauldrons, Sansa her belt and Dany the extended shoulders. Cersei\u2019s \u201cstinger\u201d has moved to the front of her costumes and Dany\u2019s dragon\u00a0\u201cspine\u201d has now been split into wings (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183277978864/a-bad-fit-some-thoughts-on-daenerys-targaryens\">x</a>).\u00a0</p><p>Another common element that has been retained is the use of chains in the costumes of all three women. Daenerys still wears her\u00a0\u201cchain of intent\u201d even though she\u2019s taking pains to partially cover the three-headed dragon with her hair, probably in an effort not to look too intimidating, too Targaryen in the North (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/181842464629/a-bad-fit-some-thoughts-on-daenerys\">x</a>). Cersei has also retained the chains that link to her pauldrons, only now she has added the lion pendant that she wore in season 1.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1088\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c68590a9c1e91f284764ec3501140e50/tumblr_inline_pny8wcAg451uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1088\"></figure><p>Sansa has also retained her Needle necklace and chain that attaches to her belt from season 7. What is interesting in this context is the fact that the symbolism and iconography of Sansa\u2019s chain/necklace is purely personal - as opposed to the chains that the two other women wear, which feature the heraldic sigils of their respective Houses. This has prompted <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> and I to discuss whether Clapton will incorporate the Stark direwolf into Sansa\u2019s chain/jewellery later in the season (she talks about this aspect <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/183747085887/sansa-costume-speculation\">here</a>).</p><p>While the promotional images show us that all three women sill still wear costumes in dark colours, the images also revealed that colour is coming back, at least in Dany\u2019s and Cersei\u2019s costumes so far. And it is very interesting that it is a colour that they both share: Red!</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1515\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/45ffabeeaef6a636528f99d132480bfd/tumblr_inline_pny91wUkDI1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1515\"></figure><p>While Clapton primarily used dark colours last season to signal that war and winter is here, she didn\u2019t abandon the use of colour completely. In fact, she introduced the colour red in Dany\u2019s costumes for the first time ever, something that fans have been waiting for since the very first season.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i><b>I wanted this season to close down colour-wise, except that Dany now she\u2019s just getting a little bit of red coming into her costume</b>, she\u2019s finally claimed her throne\u2026 well, <b>she\u2019s on her way to claiming her throne</b>.</i>\u00a0(Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.thisisinsider.com/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-2017-6\">Insider</a>)<br></p></blockquote><p>The very fact that Clapton closed down the colour in general makes the inclusion of a discrete red in Dany\u2019s costumes even more significant - and from the looks of these photos, the red is becoming much more prominent in Dany\u2019s costumes at the same time as Cersei is returning to the Lannister red.</p><h2><b>BLACK - WHITE - RED</b></h2><p>While I\u2019ve looked at the similarities between the costumes of the female leaders, the promotional material also show us some rather significant differences, especially when it comes to the use of colour. Thus, Dany\u2019s white-red coats stand in stark contrast to Sansa\u2019s black leather and Cersei\u2019s deep red velvet.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3d961ddaaa6c986dcb31f27d06573e90/tumblr_inline_pny93wjIrV1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\"></figure><p>What do these dominant colours mean to each woman? In order to answer this question we have to take a closer look at the sometimes idiosyncratic manner in which Clapton uses colour in the narrative arcs of the different women.\u00a0</p><p><b>Black/Blue (Sansa)</b></p><p>When it comes to the colour black, Clapton generally uses it to denote mourning, which I discussed in the previous <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183521407024/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">essay</a> of this series. However, the use of black in Sansa\u2019s costumes goes beyond mourning. Her infamous raven dress marks the first time she wears black but it also marks a major stylistic transformation as well as being a statement of agency on Sansa\u2019s part - I\u2019ve discussed all of these aspects in the previous post.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1515\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5dc16cf6ded09f5267fadd484cd3c030/tumblr_inline_pp16tl5nFe1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1515\"></figure><p>Black isn\u2019t really a colour that is closely associated with Sansa - she only wore it at the end of season 4 and in the beginning of season 5. She has only had three black costumes prior to the new leather dress. In some ways, introducing black into Sansa\u2019s costumes feels a bit like a step back, mainly because it is a colour that she wore when she was under the thumb of Petyr Baelish but also because she wore it just before she came to suffer the most severe sexual, physical and emotional abuse that she has ever been subjected to. Sansa wore black just before her narrative took the darkest possible turn.</p><p>So why does Clapton return to the colour black with Sansa in season 8? First of all, this is most likely not Sansa\u2019s only costume and hardly her endgame costume. The armour-like scaling as well as the <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183300013819/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">transitional silhouette</a>, leads me to believe that this is a mid-season costume, related to the war against the Dead. In this sense, it would be useful to go back as see what Clapton said about the raven dress, which boils down to Transformation and Strength!</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201c<b>When she comes down the stairs</b>, she\u2019s playing with it like, \u2018<b>This is me, taking control of this situation</b>.\u2019\u201d </i>(Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thecut.com%2F2014%2F12%2Fstyle-to-expect-when-game-of-thrones-returns.html&amp;t=YTUwODI0YTFlZGRmZjQ4M2JmZTFmYWMwNDM1ZjdiNmM3NGMxYzM5ZCxaMGdLU2FadA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183118735354%2Farmoured-in-scales-some-thoughts-on-sansa&amp;m=1\">The Cut</a>) <br></p><p><i>David and Dan came to me with <b>the idea of a transformation for Sansa</b>.

Plus, <b>in general, Clapton uses the darker colours to signify strength when it comes to the female characters.</b></p><p><b>There is, however, also a curious sensual aspect to this costume</b>, which is an entirely new element to Sansa\u2019s costuming (apart from the plunging neckline of the raven dress). The photos reveal that <b>it is made from soft and glossy leather, which lends the whole outfit a sort slinky quality</b>. Though <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183300013819/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">it mimics the Tully leather armour</a>, this dress isn\u2019t thick or stiff - and though it retains the tight-laced silhouette from season 7 with the belt that is Sansa\u2019s emotional armour, <b>the soft and glossy leather practically invites a touch</b>. This is a curious dichotomy: <b><i>a tightly laced and armoured body, wrapped a glossy material that draws attention to itself (by reflecting light), a material that looks so soft that you\u2019re tempted to touch.\u00a0</i></b></p><p>In the photos we have of Sansa\u2019s new costume, there\u2019s a noted bluish iridescence to piece. However, it is hard to tell whether this bluish tint is simply an effect of reflected light and/or Photoshop - or whether the leather is perhaps a deep midnight blue rather than all black. It isn\u2019t really something we can determine until we get better photos and see the costume on the screen. However, I have made an edit comparing two different photos of Sansa\u2019s dress to Cersei\u2019s black silk dress from season 7 since it\u2019s shiny fabric also reflects light.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dbfb6f973022abaa8cf18dd876559a67/tumblr_inline_poqoydigVd1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\"></figure><p>Sansa\u2019s dress does seem more blue-tinted than Cersei\u2019s black silk - but I cannot discount this as an effect of Photoshop. The reason I bring up this issue is because blue is a colour that is very much connected to Sansa Stark. Clapton has always used blue for House Stark:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>We have a lot of <b>blues and grays</b>, murkier colors that seemed right for the harsh <b>northern climates</b>. The Starks represent a warm family unit, so the blues of their costumes are rather warm. But within the family, the various personalities are reflected in what they wear. For example, Sansa is in a slightly cooler blue.</i> (<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fcostumevault.blogspot.com%2F2016%2F08%2Fcreating-seven-kingdoms-part-i-north.html&amp;t=ZjdjYmY0Yzg5Mjk3OWQ5NWU0NzdjNDZhZjI4MmViZDM0YTdhNzgxNCxvWWc4SXdmUA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182432528629%2Fwinterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-17&amp;m=1\">CostumeVault</a>) \n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>However, Sansa in particular has worn quite a few blue costumes (about 10 all in all). In the early seasons, she was very much associated with very light blue colours, which denote her youthful innocence. Interestingly, Margaery wears light blue as well - but in a calculated way - to affect an innocent girlishness that she doesn\u2019t possess (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/179909400489/the-rose-of-highgarden-on-margaery-tyrell-part\">x</a>).

In this context, it is indeed possible that Sansa\u2019s new leather dress isn\u2019t pure black but a midnight blue so deep that it is almost black. However, this is at present highly speculative since we need more and better visual material to\u00a0 make a final pronouncement. However, since colour is creeping black into Cersei and Dany\u2019s costumes - I do think that we\u2019ll see a dark, vibrant blue return in Sansa\u2019s endgame costumes.</p><p><b>White/Red (Daenerys)</b></p><p>Apart from Sansa\u2019s second wedding gown from season 5, Daenerys is the only female character who has worn white - and she\u2019s the only one who has consistently worn white.

It is fascinating that Clapton also relates the use of white with Daenerys feeling like she has a divine right (to what she wants) and that she is beyond question, which is an incredibly dangerous thing for a ruler to think.\u00a0</p><h2>When it comes to Daenerys, white is connected to her being powerful, untouchable, remote and almost god-like.</h2><p>This certainly sounds very impressive but all of these things signals a person that is both lonely and too powerful for her own good.

In <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183300013819/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">Part 1</a> of this series of essays, I took a closer look at the texture of this costume, especially in relation to the leather armour of House Tully. In <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183521407024/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">Part 2</a>, I discussed how this textured leather dress evokes a couple of Sansa&rsquo;s earlier costumes as well as the similarities and differences it has with Cersei&rsquo;s iconic coronation dress, which is also made of black leather. In this final post, I&rsquo;ll explore how Sansa&rsquo;s new leather costume might function both as an equivalent to and a juxtaposition of the warrior look that Daenerys debuted in season 7 and carries over into season 8.</p><h2><b>A WARRIOR LOOK</b></h2><p>While Sansa&rsquo;s new costume isn&rsquo;t a functional armour, it strongly evokes the traditional Tully armour, which is made of overlapping leather flaps. This could be a significant political statement as I discussed in <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183300013819/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">Part 1</a> of this series. The new costume incorporates a couple of older elements like the tight leather belt with the cross-straps that envelop Sansa&rsquo;s torso. The belt functions as a kind of emotional armour for Sansa in season 7:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>&ldquo;With one of the key pieces this year, <b>I wanted it to look as if she was actually sewn or laced into her dress&mdash;like there was no way in. </b>So I designed a belt that comes around the neck, across the chest and around the waist. <b>She&rsquo;s trying to protect herself</b> from all the awfulness that&rsquo;s happened.<b> It&rsquo;s a form of armor.</b> It will be interesting to see how that moves forward.&rdquo; </i>(Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elle.com%2Fculture%2Fmovies-tv%2Fnews%2Fa47144%2Fgame-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-easter-eggs%2F&amp;t=N2JmYTE0NWIwMTAyMWY1ODBhM2NlMzY5YzAwMzk4MjQyNzNlZGM3YSxaMGdLU2FadA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183300013819%2Fa-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks&amp;m=1\">Elle</a>)\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>Retaining this belt indicates that Sansa still feels the need to protect herself emotionally - but when it is coupled with a dress that not only resembles the the Tully armour but also evokes an earlier dress that was meant to signify both transformation and strength (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183521407024/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">Part 2</a>), it shifts the symbolism of the entire costume. Sansa also wears the necklace that was introduced at the end of season 4 and modified in season 7:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>For Sansa, <b>the chain that she wears, the needle on the end represents her Needle, her way of fighting back</b>.

Though these two costumes look completely different on the surface (white vs black, fur vs leather), they do share one significant aspect: The fact that the surface textures of the two costumes resemble different kinds of animal skin. Sansa&rsquo;s leather dress evokes fish scales and Dany&rsquo;s fur coat is meant to evoke dragon skin:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;I guess to some extent the <b>ribbed effect</b> created by the construction has the <b>feel of a dragon&rsquo;s skin</b>.</i>&rdquo; &nbsp;(Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vanityfair.com%2Fhollywood%2F2017%2F08%2Fgame-of-thrones-daenerys-coat-michele-clapton-interview-viserys&amp;t=ZjdhMDNjYmU5Y2JlM2Q5ZjlhZWI2MjAzNzE5NDQ0MDNlNTcwNTk5ZCxaMGdLU2FadA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183118735354%2Farmoured-in-scales-some-thoughts-on-sansa&amp;m=1\">Vanity Fair</a>)<br /></p></blockquote><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7ad50d44819a304724ad21526f55535c/tumblr_inline_pny848QkTR1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Furthermore, both looks are warrior looks, signalling that these two women are ready to fight for what they want:</p><blockquote><p><i>Dany is <b>elevating her look to that of warrior queen</b>, with the beautiful silver dragon chain completing the look.&rdquo;</i> (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vanityfair.com%2Fhollywood%2F2017%2F08%2Fgame-of-thrones-daenerys-coat-michele-clapton-interview-viserys&amp;t=ZjdhMDNjYmU5Y2JlM2Q5ZjlhZWI2MjAzNzE5NDQ0MDNlNTcwNTk5ZCxaMGdLU2FadA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183118735354%2Farmoured-in-scales-some-thoughts-on-sansa&amp;m=1\">Vanity Fair</a>) <br /></p><p><i>&ldquo;I wanted to define Dany&rsquo;s shape by cutting into and shaping the fur.

Not only do they share the texture of animal skins but in season 7 Michele Clapton consciously chose to have Dany and Sansa&rsquo;s accessories echo each other even though the two women had never shared a scene together.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i><b>Dany and Sansa&rsquo;s accessories echo each other</b>&mdash;and also come from unexpected sources. &ldquo;<b>We see them facing each other, really.</b> <b>We see the dynamics of this.</b> It&rsquo;s funny because it comes from different backgrounds. For Sansa, the chain that she wears, the needle on the end represents her Needle, her way of fighting back. It&rsquo;s a small version of the Needle Arya has. But the chain in a weird way is an influence from Littlefinger.<b> </b>He always used to wear accouterments for his job chained to his coat on a fine chain, and then a mockingbird sigil at his neck. <b>So I was trying to collate all the people who influenced her&mdash;whether she likes them or not</b>. There&rsquo;s a<b> real formality about her chain</b> and the [way] the circle is positioned and looped. That&rsquo;s very much Littlefinger. <b>With Dany, she is trying to impress that she is the queen in ranking but she can&rsquo;t wear a crown, so it&rsquo;s just a huge statement piece of intent&mdash;it&rsquo;s a chain of intent.

In this respect, it is interesting that Clapton has chosen to retain Dany&rsquo;s white furred warrior look but with significant and meaningful updates, especially the inclusion of the Targaryen red which was absent from the season 7 costume (I&rsquo;ve written about this costume <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/181842464629/a-bad-fit-some-thoughts-on-daenerys\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183277978864/a-bad-fit-some-thoughts-on-daenerys-targaryens\">here</a>).</p><p>In this context, one could argue that Sansa&rsquo;s new battle dress is not just a costume that reflects the upcoming war but also a kind of sartorial answer to Daenerys&rsquo; white furred warrior look - a look that incorporates the Targaryen red, a dragon skin texture as well as dragon scale beading on the shoulders.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5b74a6e9eb1ab71f58a8f9f22b482337/tumblr_inline_pny87ysy3b1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>On the other hand, Sansa&rsquo;s fish scale armour not only refers to her mother&rsquo;s heritage but quite possibly also to a political alliance with her mother&rsquo;s family, House Tully. While Sansa doesn&rsquo;t wear her fur cloak in these promotional photos, I think it is very likely that we&rsquo;ll see her wearing her Stark furs with this new dress on the show - and this combination would refer both her mother&rsquo;s heritage, which Clapton has repeatedly invoked through the textures of her season 7 costumes while the fur cloak with the cross-straps refers to her Stark identity, her authority as Lady of Winterfell and the memory of her father.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>&rdquo;Within each of their costumes, there are influences.

Sansa&rsquo;s costumes refer to her mother&rsquo;s Tully heritage and her father&rsquo;s Stark identity whereas Daenerys&rsquo; costumes refer to her Targaryen identity, which is a product of sibling incest (there&rsquo;s no melding of different families here).</p><p>The EW promotional photo shoot revealed another new costume of Dany&rsquo;s - though it took me a while to realize that it was a new one because it is very similar to the white and red fur coat. This new costume is still white with red fur trimmings but it looks to be made from suede - it is thus a fur-less version of Dany&rsquo;s white and red warrior look.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6b8790f080ef233cc1d5e398d43d7d64/tumblr_inline_pny8avMhNo1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>What I find very interesting about this new costume is the effect that the suede along with the fur-trimmed ribbing creates, especially on the sleeves. Dany&rsquo;s new costume brings to mind the leathery and webbed wings of her dragons! This effect is specially noticeable in the profile view and <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> describes the effect as if&nbsp;&ldquo;<i><a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/183447444897/the-three-queens-holding-back-in-costume-design\">a dragon wrapping its wings around itself</a></i>\n\n&ldquo;.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bfc13df9a52b3e5cd7f84c5bb9017a70/tumblr_inline_pp1qkivnCb1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>This webbed wing effect also shows up in her other new costume - a charcoal outfit (probably a kind of coat dress) worn under a furred shrug with extended and beaded shoulders.</p><p>Another interesting aspect of this outfit is that while it lacks the militaristic aspect of the extended shoulders of her season 7 costumes, it is a more aggressively dragon-like than any of her other costumes, even though it lacks the beading that so far has been used to evoke dragon scales.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2ee0475298eb547f7e43f4a56095b651/tumblr_inline_pny8c3DqpY1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Firstly, the lack of the fur makes all the difference here. The fur softens the dragon-like webbing and scaling (as on the back of the season 7 fur coat). As we can see, the scale-like dragon-spine of her fur coat is retained in the suede coat. Leather trimmings have been added at the seams that create the webbing in a saw-tooth pattern that evokes the stitching on the season 7 coat but it has a more aggressive&nbsp;&ldquo;feel&rdquo; since it isn&rsquo;t an intrinsic effect of the sewing technique but an extra addition (and again not softened by fur).&nbsp;</p><p>Dany&rsquo;s accessories are also rather dragon-like with this outfit. She wears her chain of intent - though her hair partially covers three dragon heads, the dragon spine of the chain is fully visible. Furthermore, in the profile shot it is clear that she wears a red silk sash, pleated to evoke dragon scales (it is probably the same sash that she wore in season 7).&nbsp;</p><p>If Sansa&rsquo;s fish scale battle dress might be an answer to Daenerys&rsquo; furred warrior look, then it is plausible that Dany&rsquo;s suede dragon wing coat might be an answer to Sansa&rsquo;s warrior look. Though the two costumes look different on the surface - their colours and textures are very different - the basic silhouettes as well as the materials are quite similar. Dany&rsquo;s second white coat looks to be made of suede, a lightweight animal skin akin to the soft, lightweight leather of Sansa&rsquo;s fish scale dress. They are also both side-laced in the front and have soft shoulders.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8f2f48a9f2ba5aff140463bc81ebd78e/tumblr_inline_pny8d2FmAp1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The promotional material also revealed another point of similarity. Daenerys wears a red silk scarf tied in an ascot when she arrives in Winterfell and she wears it with the suede coat as well - and in the trailer we see Sansa wearing a silk ascot in either black or a midnight blue. I&rsquo;m very curious to what this could possibly mean. Since Sansa wears one of her season 7 costumes in the arrival scene this means that the silk ascot is mainly connected to Daenerys&rsquo; character. Does this mean that Sansa is emulating Dany? It is certainly possible. However, what does this mean? Especially since Sophie Turner has stated that Sansa is done emulating other characters in her style.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c2a6abddea0e4dd09b529eac56851743/tumblr_inline_pny8dsNQRb1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>It could be a way for Sansa to signal that these two women are on the same side in the war against the dead. It could function as a sign that Sansa is trying to be diplomatic in a difficult situation (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183246013149/sansa-has-a-blue-silk-ascot-tied-like-danys-in\">x</a>). That is a <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist\">Watsonian</a> explanation. However, there&rsquo;s also the possibility that Clapton has made this choice for Doylist reasons - to signal both a similarities and differences between the two characters since the colours are quite different. While their scarves are of the same material and are tied in the same way - the differences in colour create very different effects. Sansa&rsquo;s dark ascot almost merges with the rest of her costume. It doesn&rsquo;t draw attention to itself visually whereas it is the completely opposite situation with Dany&rsquo;s ascot since the red silk stands in a glaring contrast to the white costume.</p><p>Despite the surface differences between the costumes of these two characters, I do think that it is important to look at them in relation to each other because these two women are finally going to interact and Clapton likes to express the nature of such relationships through the costuming. In season 3, she expressed Cersei and Margaery&rsquo;s simmering feud through costumes that were radically different in colour and cut (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/179909400489/the-rose-of-highgarden-on-margaery-tyrell-part\">x</a>). She also talks about Dany and Cersei&rsquo;s season 7 costumes in terms of a sartorial&nbsp;&ldquo;standoff&rdquo; that echoes the political power play between them and though their costumes look quite different, there&rsquo;s a similarity in the severity of the silhouettes as well as the symbolic values of the their jewellery:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;<i>You can see in the way [Dany is] dressing that <b>she&rsquo;s almost assuming the power but not quite</b>. With <b>all the colors and the details and the essence </b>&mdash; <b>it just becomes stronger</b>. The width of the shoulders give her strength, the chain gives her strength. I tried to make the <b>cut of the costumes just slightly more like a uniform</b> and almost less feminine. This is the time when it&rsquo;s all really going to matter, and so</i>&nbsp;<b>there&rsquo;s</b> <b>a power play between her and Cersei. It&rsquo;s like a standoff</b>. And I think they&rsquo;ve both reached a place where it&rsquo;s not about femininity, it&rsquo;s about their strength as women.</i>&rdquo; (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.thisisinsider.com/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-2017-6\">Insider</a>)</p><p>&ldquo;<i>I knew so instantly how Cersei should be, looking back at the arc of her story and her relationship with her father.

Then <b>to</b> <b>pare down the crown into just simple strokes that to me looked like a lion still,</b> that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re meant to be,<b> but without that sort of solid heraldic lion that she&rsquo;s usually worn</b>.

She&rsquo;s used to being the center of their world (just look at Jorah, Daario, etc.), and Jon has a family that he loves dearly and while Arya is his favorite sister, he has a bond with Sansa that is special because they were the ones that won back Winterfell together. They have been political partners for a while and despite their quarrels, they love each other dearly. Dany simply isn&rsquo;t used to having to compete for the attention of her followers - Jon has a family that he loves, he&rsquo;s a leader who has his people to answer to and Dany is not the center of his world, like she is to most of her followers who are rootless people that have made her their world.</p><h2><b>A CLASH OF QUEENS</b></h2><p>During season 7, the show has presented Sansa, Daenerys and Cersei as either parallels or foils to each other - in terms of leadership - and that is reflected in the costumes, which was a conscious decision on the part of Clapton:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;The women has become&hellip; they&rsquo;ve always been important but they&rsquo;ve become so much more dominant - and <b>I love playing the interplay between the women left.</b>&rdquo;</i> (Michele Clapton,<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dccmXw0YpJU&amp;t=9s\"> IGN Live SDCC 2016</a>)<br /></p></blockquote><p>I&rsquo;m not the first to notice how Clapton created several correspondences between the costumes of Cersei, Daenerys and Sansa in the last season - some details were rather subtle while other details are more obvious. <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myHfbeJjjc8bFgVOAD6sAmg\">@jonsalways</a> has written a <a href=\"https://jonsalways.tumblr.com/post/167586483239/the-3-queens-of-westeros-a-costume-meta\">post</a> comparing the costumes of the three women and <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> has also explored the similarities and differences in the costuming (you can read them <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/181902464977/a-ladys-armor-part-3\">here</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/182085659532/a-ladys-armor-part-4\">here</a>).</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/99dc206e3a57fb82da2f176eaf580faa/tumblr_inline_pos2z1tT331uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>A common element of all three women is the bleak and militaristic quality of their costumes:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\n&ldquo;There&rsquo;s war coming.

Each one of them has been through such a journey, so I tried to reflect that in their costumes</b>. For instance, Sansa: she&rsquo;s been abused, raped, and had the most horrific things happen to her, so I liked the idea that she&rsquo;s encased in her costume. No one is gonna get into her, no one is gonna get near her. It is an armor. She&rsquo;s laced and then she has the belt, which I really particularly like, which goes up and around her body. Everything is really controlled. <b>I&rsquo;ve also shortened the length of the dresses on Cersei and Sansa because I want there to be a practicality. </b>The way the women are arriving in the north, they&rsquo;re beginning to fight and realize they have to be equal. <b>They have to fight for survival. I had to get rid of all the unnecessary.</b> With Dany, the colors have gotten darker but there is a red creeping in, her house color. Slowly we&rsquo;re trying to move them into their own individual looks. It&rsquo;s practical. It&rsquo;s war. <b>The time isn&rsquo;t for pretty dresses. Jewelry isn&rsquo;t worn to be attractive. It&rsquo;s worn to represent your house or your stature or your intent.</b> This is the direction I have to go in now.&rdquo;</i> (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a12097061/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-interview/\">Harper&rsquo;s Bazaar</a>)<br /></p></blockquote><p>Firstly, all three women wear dark colours - charcoal and black - to signify mourning as well as the fact that winter and war has come to the shores of Westeros. Secondly, the costumes of all three women have an armoured look, which is expressed in different ways according to their individual narrative journeys. Cersei wears actual armour in the form of steel pauldrons whereas the silhouette of Dany&rsquo;s costumes with the extended shoulders not only references the style of her late brother Viserys but also evoke the armour of the Unsullied, which signify her role as their commander. She is here to make war. Sansa&rsquo;s armour is her belt that not only binds her waist tightly but also encases her torso with extra cross straps, metaphorically protecting herself from the touch of others.</p><p>Another common theme is the way that the three women&rsquo;s costumes reference the men in the men in their families - Cersei&rsquo;s coronation dress is a deliberate nod to the style of her father Tywin whose approval she always sought be never got (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183521407024/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">x</a>). Dany&rsquo;s style is inspired by her brother Viserys, the man who abused her but whose ambition she is finally about to realize (<a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/179678685367/fire-and-blood\">x</a>) and Sansa&rsquo;s costumes not only reference her father Eddard but also her mother Catelyn (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183300013819/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">x</a>) as well as her half-brother Jon (<a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/181846188337/a-ladys-armor-part-2\">x</a>) and her sister Arya (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183521407024/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">x</a>).</p><p>One commonality between all the different costumes are the emphasis on the shoulders, either through extended shoulder tabs, actual armour and/or beading.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/881d3a90960611482c3fef8c2e06200c/tumblr_inline_pny8jm2gcT1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>There are, however, some specific costume elements that converse with each other beyond a general militaristic look and dark colours. Sansa and Cersei&rsquo;s hems have been shortened for practicality. Unlike Cersei, both Sansa and Dany incorporate fur into their look - Sansa with her fur cape and Dany with fur lining and an elaborate fur coat. Both Dany and Cersei use elaborate beading on some of their costumes - but whereas Cersei&rsquo;s opulent beaded pieces signals a brittleness to her strength evoked through the use of glass, Dany&rsquo;s beaded shoulder pieces evinces a jagged hardness that has carried over from the end of season 6 - and in general, the more ornate and&nbsp;&ldquo;hard&rdquo; her dragon scales become, the more powerful she is (<a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/articles/game-of-thrones-embroiderer-michele-carragher-talks-dragons-and-dresses-sb\">x</a>).&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c85367cebf2efb097226721f6644e888/tumblr_inline_pos2y0bZyW1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>One interesting point of comparison are the stylistic similarities between the backs of Cersei&rsquo;s Dragonpit costume and Dany&rsquo;s white fur coat. Both of these costumes feature a kind of animal &ldquo;spine&rdquo; - Clapton refers to Cersei&rsquo;s as a&nbsp;&ldquo;stinger&rdquo; and Dany&rsquo;s&nbsp;&ldquo;spine&rdquo; resembles dragon scales, evoking the animals that she is so closely associated with.</p><p>Their accessories also converse with each other - as the Clapton quotes in the previous section prove. Sansa&rsquo;s chain refers back to an earlier one, and it is linked not only to her tutelage under Baelish&rsquo; aegis (the chain) but also to her sister Arya (the Needle). Now it is a bit more formal, attached to her belt, which reflect her position as Lady of Winterfell.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e9010cca75b8ff60af7296f8b3e3c103/tumblr_inline_pny8ix6asl1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Dany&rsquo;s chain represents her ambition - Clapton calls it a&nbsp;&ldquo;chain of intent&rdquo;, the intent being the conquest of the Iron Throne. Since Dany isn&rsquo;t actually Queen yet, Clapton withheld a crown from her costume. Dany&rsquo;s chain features the sigil of her House, the three-headed dragon, and in that sense it echoes Cersei&rsquo;s crown, which is an abstract rendering of a lion, the sigil of House Lannister. However, Cersei also wears chains - and they are connected to her armour, i.e. the pauldrons she wears with her coronation dress. In that sense, these chains echoes Sansa&rsquo;s necklace where the chain is fastened to her belt, which functions as Sansa&rsquo;s armour.</p><p>Will the costumes of Cersei, Sansa and Daenerys continue to converse with each other in season 8? Based on the limited material we have so far, I&rsquo;ll say&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. While there are significant changes in style, there are still elements from season 7 that carries over in the new season. However, it is a bit difficult to determine the extent of this sartorial&nbsp;&ldquo;conversation&rdquo;, especially since we only have images of one of Sansa&rsquo;s new costumes as compared to images of two new costumes for Cersei and three new costumes for Dany.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e7ca07f142e559e73f3cad6f786ce15f/tumblr_inline_pny8ntgJew1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>So what we infer for the available visual material? Firstly, the dark colours are still there. Secondly, they still have their various forms of armour - Cersei has her pauldrons, Sansa her belt and Dany the extended shoulders. Cersei&rsquo;s &ldquo;stinger&rdquo; has moved to the front of her costumes and Dany&rsquo;s dragon&nbsp;&ldquo;spine&rdquo; has now been split into wings (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183277978864/a-bad-fit-some-thoughts-on-daenerys-targaryens\">x</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Another common element that has been retained is the use of chains in the costumes of all three women. Daenerys still wears her&nbsp;&ldquo;chain of intent&rdquo; even though she&rsquo;s taking pains to partially cover the three-headed dragon with her hair, probably in an effort not to look too intimidating, too Targaryen in the North (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/181842464629/a-bad-fit-some-thoughts-on-daenerys\">x</a>). Cersei has also retained the chains that link to her pauldrons, only now she has added the lion pendant that she wore in season 1.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c68590a9c1e91f284764ec3501140e50/tumblr_inline_pny8wcAg451uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Sansa has also retained her Needle necklace and chain that attaches to her belt from season 7. What is interesting in this context is the fact that the symbolism and iconography of Sansa&rsquo;s chain/necklace is purely personal - as opposed to the chains that the two other women wear, which feature the heraldic sigils of their respective Houses. This has prompted <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> and I to discuss whether Clapton will incorporate the Stark direwolf into Sansa&rsquo;s chain/jewellery later in the season (she talks about this aspect <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/183747085887/sansa-costume-speculation\">here</a>).</p><p>While the promotional images show us that all three women sill still wear costumes in dark colours, the images also revealed that colour is coming back, at least in Dany&rsquo;s and Cersei&rsquo;s costumes so far. And it is very interesting that it is a colour that they both share: Red!</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/45ffabeeaef6a636528f99d132480bfd/tumblr_inline_pny91wUkDI1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>While Clapton primarily used dark colours last season to signal that war and winter is here, she didn&rsquo;t abandon the use of colour completely. In fact, she introduced the colour red in Dany&rsquo;s costumes for the first time ever, something that fans have been waiting for since the very first season.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i><b>I wanted this season to close down colour-wise, except that Dany now she&rsquo;s just getting a little bit of red coming into her costume</b>, she&rsquo;s finally claimed her throne&hellip; well, <b>she&rsquo;s on her way to claiming her throne</b>.</i>&nbsp;(Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.thisisinsider.com/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-2017-6\">Insider</a>)<br /></p></blockquote><p>The very fact that Clapton closed down the colour in general makes the inclusion of a discrete red in Dany&rsquo;s costumes even more significant - and from the looks of these photos, the red is becoming much more prominent in Dany&rsquo;s costumes at the same time as Cersei is returning to the Lannister red.</p><h2><b>BLACK - WHITE - RED</b></h2><p>While I&rsquo;ve looked at the similarities between the costumes of the female leaders, the promotional material also show us some rather significant differences, especially when it comes to the use of colour. Thus, Dany&rsquo;s white-red coats stand in stark contrast to Sansa&rsquo;s black leather and Cersei&rsquo;s deep red velvet.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3d961ddaaa6c986dcb31f27d06573e90/tumblr_inline_pny93wjIrV1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>What do these dominant colours mean to each woman? In order to answer this question we have to take a closer look at the sometimes idiosyncratic manner in which Clapton uses colour in the narrative arcs of the different women.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Black/Blue (Sansa)</b></p><p>When it comes to the colour black, Clapton generally uses it to denote mourning, which I discussed in the previous <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183521407024/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">essay</a> of this series. However, the use of black in Sansa&rsquo;s costumes goes beyond mourning. Her infamous raven dress marks the first time she wears black but it also marks a major stylistic transformation as well as being a statement of agency on Sansa&rsquo;s part - I&rsquo;ve discussed all of these aspects in the previous post.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5dc16cf6ded09f5267fadd484cd3c030/tumblr_inline_pp16tl5nFe1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Black isn&rsquo;t really a colour that is closely associated with Sansa - she only wore it at the end of season 4 and in the beginning of season 5. She has only had three black costumes prior to the new leather dress. In some ways, introducing black into Sansa&rsquo;s costumes feels a bit like a step back, mainly because it is a colour that she wore when she was under the thumb of Petyr Baelish but also because she wore it just before she came to suffer the most severe sexual, physical and emotional abuse that she has ever been subjected to. Sansa wore black just before her narrative took the darkest possible turn.</p><p>So why does Clapton return to the colour black with Sansa in season 8? First of all, this is most likely not Sansa&rsquo;s only costume and hardly her endgame costume. The armour-like scaling as well as the <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183300013819/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">transitional silhouette</a>, leads me to believe that this is a mid-season costume, related to the war against the Dead. In this sense, it would be useful to go back as see what Clapton said about the raven dress, which boils down to Transformation and Strength!</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;<b>When she comes down the stairs</b>, she&rsquo;s playing with it like, &lsquo;<b>This is me, taking control of this situation</b>.&rsquo;&rdquo; </i>(Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thecut.com%2F2014%2F12%2Fstyle-to-expect-when-game-of-thrones-returns.html&amp;t=YTUwODI0YTFlZGRmZjQ4M2JmZTFmYWMwNDM1ZjdiNmM3NGMxYzM5ZCxaMGdLU2FadA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183118735354%2Farmoured-in-scales-some-thoughts-on-sansa&amp;m=1\">The Cut</a>) <br /></p><p><i>David and Dan came to me with <b>the idea of a transformation for Sansa</b>.

Plus, <b>in general, Clapton uses the darker colours to signify strength when it comes to the female characters.</b></p><p><b>There is, however, also a curious sensual aspect to this costume</b>, which is an entirely new element to Sansa&rsquo;s costuming (apart from the plunging neckline of the raven dress). The photos reveal that <b>it is made from soft and glossy leather, which lends the whole outfit a sort slinky quality</b>. Though <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183300013819/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">it mimics the Tully leather armour</a>, this dress isn&rsquo;t thick or stiff - and though it retains the tight-laced silhouette from season 7 with the belt that is Sansa&rsquo;s emotional armour, <b>the soft and glossy leather practically invites a touch</b>. This is a curious dichotomy: <b><i>a tightly laced and armoured body, wrapped a glossy material that draws attention to itself (by reflecting light), a material that looks so soft that you&rsquo;re tempted to touch.&nbsp;</i></b></p><p>In the photos we have of Sansa&rsquo;s new costume, there&rsquo;s a noted bluish iridescence to piece. However, it is hard to tell whether this bluish tint is simply an effect of reflected light and/or Photoshop - or whether the leather is perhaps a deep midnight blue rather than all black. It isn&rsquo;t really something we can determine until we get better photos and see the costume on the screen. However, I have made an edit comparing two different photos of Sansa&rsquo;s dress to Cersei&rsquo;s black silk dress from season 7 since it&rsquo;s shiny fabric also reflects light.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dbfb6f973022abaa8cf18dd876559a67/tumblr_inline_poqoydigVd1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Sansa&rsquo;s dress does seem more blue-tinted than Cersei&rsquo;s black silk - but I cannot discount this as an effect of Photoshop. The reason I bring up this issue is because blue is a colour that is very much connected to Sansa Stark. Clapton has always used blue for House Stark:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>We have a lot of <b>blues and grays</b>, murkier colors that seemed right for the harsh <b>northern climates</b>. The Starks represent a warm family unit, so the blues of their costumes are rather warm. But within the family, the various personalities are reflected in what they wear. For example, Sansa is in a slightly cooler blue.</i> (<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fcostumevault.blogspot.com%2F2016%2F08%2Fcreating-seven-kingdoms-part-i-north.html&amp;t=ZjdjYmY0Yzg5Mjk3OWQ5NWU0NzdjNDZhZjI4MmViZDM0YTdhNzgxNCxvWWc4SXdmUA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182432528629%2Fwinterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-17&amp;m=1\">CostumeVault</a>) \n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>However, Sansa in particular has worn quite a few blue costumes (about 10 all in all). In the early seasons, she was very much associated with very light blue colours, which denote her youthful innocence. Interestingly, Margaery wears light blue as well - but in a calculated way - to affect an innocent girlishness that she doesn&rsquo;t possess (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/179909400489/the-rose-of-highgarden-on-margaery-tyrell-part\">x</a>). Cersei has also worn a light blue dress at her most fragile moments in season 1 and 2.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0d7643a386ed842ca5310788f417d577/tumblr_inline_pp18ouboAQ1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Thus, Michele Clapton generally uses a pale blue colour to signal youthful innocence as well as fragility - and the innocence of youth is indeed a fragile thing. Over the course of the seasons, Sansa starts to wear darker blues - like the dark greyish-blue cloak she wears in season 4-6 and the vibrant teal dress she wears when she sets out to reclaim her home with Jon Snow.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/71042373afdd34c1a9f05f5e615dfe49/tumblr_inline_pnyh1iR8pu1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>These darker blues takes Sansa closer to the adult Starks - both Ned and Catelyn sometimes wore dark blues, though only Catelyn has worn teal before Sansa. In this context, it is indeed possible that Sansa&rsquo;s new leather dress isn&rsquo;t pure black but a midnight blue so deep that it is almost black. However, this is at present highly speculative since we need more and better visual material to&nbsp; make a final pronouncement. However, since colour is creeping black into Cersei and Dany&rsquo;s costumes - I do think that we&rsquo;ll see a dark, vibrant blue return in Sansa&rsquo;s endgame costumes.</p><p><b>White/Red (Daenerys)</b></p><p>Apart from Sansa&rsquo;s second wedding gown from season 5, Daenerys is the only female character who has worn white - and she&rsquo;s the only one who has consistently worn white.

It is, as mentioned before, a warrior look - but it is also a look connected to her infatuation with Jon:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;<b>It was the first time</b> that I could remember <b>that Dany had put herself in danger that is not necessarily for personal gain</b>, so <b>the white was this sense of purity</b>,&rdquo; said costume designer Clapton (a three-time Emmy winner for &ldquo;Game of Thrones&rdquo; and last year&rsquo;s winner for &ldquo;The Crown&rdquo;). &ldquo;<b>It had an honesty to it&hellip;she has fallen in love with Jon</b>.&rdquo;</i> (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2018/08/game-of-thrones-season-7-dany-costume-production-design-hbo-emmys-1201994086/\">IndieWire</a>)<br /></p></blockquote><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe6983281bac87a890c1b89f05bbfb80/tumblr_inline_pos5rhw6yS1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Yet even here Dany can&rsquo;t escape the dehumanizing effect of the way that Clapton uses white in her costumes:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nClapton equated the visual importance of Dany&rsquo;s white coat with mythology. &ldquo;I wanted to create <b>this powerful image of her</b> descending <b>like an Angel</b> to save these men from imminent death,&rdquo; she said.</i> (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2018/08/game-of-thrones-season-7-dany-costume-production-design-hbo-emmys-1201994086/\">IndieWire</a>)<br /></p></blockquote><p>The visual effect was dazzling with the pale, silver-haired woman wearing pure white in a landscape of snow and ice.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4a94e7292f9b8947ff481854dea4c0ac/tumblr_inline_pp1lce3mU81uklhai_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>She looks ethereal - but not very human either - and the colour white is indeed very ambiguous in relation to Dany&rsquo;s narrative arc as Clapton&rsquo;s comments reveals.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>The promotional material reveals that Daenerys retains the white in some of her new costumes - but with one very important difference: the addition of the colour red, which becomes very conspicuous when compared to the white.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/212c1c10eb76e243c680d5ecfecf129c/tumblr_inline_pos5t41Lum1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Red is one of the traditional colours of House Targaryen and Clapton has withheld it until season 7 for narrative reasons.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;This season seemed to be the <b>right time for Daenerys to start to embrace the shape and colours of her house</b>,&rdquo; Clapton told HuffPost in an email. &ldquo;<b>She is in touching distance of her desired place &hellip; so I liked this flowering</b>, this <b>visual expression of her growing confidence</b> that she could maybe take the throne.&rdquo;</i> (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.huffpostbrasil.com/entry/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-explains-danys-meaningful-outfits_us_59a4319fe4b06d67e33926b6?ec_carp=8265756527327536922\">Huffpost</a>)<br /></p></blockquote><p>However, Clapton really uses red in a very loaded way when it comes to Dany because it not just her House colour, it is also a outward sign of her hunger for power in the form of the Iron Throne.&nbsp;This is an ambition that she adopted from her brother Viserys, so when Dany wear&rsquo;s red it also refers to her late brother:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>When we see her now, <b>she&rsquo;s starting to wear the colors of her brother. What does that say about her?</b></i>&ldquo; (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwinteriscoming.net%2F2018%2F09%2F08%2Fcostume-designer-michele-clapton-teases-danys-new-look-season-8%2F&amp;t=MDk5YTZjYWRiOWY5MDA3NzcwODk0YjUwZmM1Y2MyN2FhMTU0ZmE2YixDVXJ6VzcwMA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Aek0Dr1CXIaPxf-CrR5ZTPg&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Flostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183447444897%2Fthe-three-queens-holding-back-in-costume-design&amp;m=0\">Winter Is Coming</a>&nbsp;- on Dany&rsquo;s season 8 costume)&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>So it is interesting that the colour red has become so much more prominent in her season 8 costumes, especially since she&rsquo;s seemingly put her ambition on hold to help Jon Snow save the world. The red is even more noticeable in these three new costumes than it was in her season 7 costumes where it was much more discreetly used.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e4b207b4514de96ed7d8f44e4175766f/tumblr_inline_poxvkjLCrv1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>All her new costumes are lined in red, their decorative elements are red and her accessories are red. Not only are there more red elements than in her season 7 costumes, the colour itself has become much more vivid, which is demonstrated in the edit above. The image to the right is an unfiltered BTS photo whereas the one to the left is from the EW photo shoot and has thus been through Photoshop. Just notice how vivid the red is in the unedited/unfiltered pic! Furthermore, the effect of the vivid red gloves is a bit unnerving since it makes one think of bloody hands, just like the red stripes in the white fur coat has an eerie&nbsp;&ldquo;blood on snow&rdquo; effect. <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/183447444897/the-three-queens-holding-back-in-costume-design\">suggests</a> that in<b> Dany uses red in her season 8 costumes as a way to display authority</b> since it is linked to her Targaryen identity, which is the very basis of her pursuit of power over Westeros. Daenerys isn&rsquo;t the only character where <b>red signals a desire for power.</b></p><p><b>Red/Gold (Cersei)</b></p><p>Cersei has worn black since Joffrey was killed in season 4 - that is a long time, so imagine my excitement when one of her new costumes turns out to be made from red velvet!

And <b>then it went to more of a blood-red</b>, and then it went to black, which shows she&rsquo;s in mourning for her children.&rdquo; </i>(Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fkeelyflaherty%2Ffacts-about-the-game-of-thrones-costumes-you-probably-nev%3Futm_term%3D.je5dAr7OP%23.hbzdAqKzQ&amp;t=MDQ3NTZkOTY4NGM5YmRiYzE1ZjMxYzIxMzIwOTE0YmNmNDg5NDczYSxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fcostume-design-quotes-by-michele-clapton-and&amp;m=1\">BuzzFeed</a>) <br /></p></blockquote><p>She doesn&rsquo;t really start to wear red in a big way until season 2 when she&rsquo;s finally free of her abusive husband and where she&rsquo;s trying to grab some power for herself, to have a hand in steering the course of the realm. When her power begins to wane, then the red recedes from her costumes:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\n&ldquo;Cersei is pulling back a little bit. She&rsquo;s not the powerhouse that she was and I wanted her to be slightly quieter. She&rsquo;s still very beautiful, but just <b>not rocking the red so much</b>. I think she can see <b>her power is abating</b>.&rdquo;</i> (<a href=\"http://history-behind-game-of-thrones.com/gameofthrones/costumes-emmys-2014\">Michele Clapton</a>)<br /></p></blockquote><p>When she took the Iron Throne at the end of season 6, Cersei was perhaps the most powerful she&rsquo;s ever been - but she&rsquo;s lost all her children so even when she&rsquo;s achieved power, she&rsquo;s still in the black of mourning. The trailer showed us that she has a black costume, which she&rsquo;ll most likely wear in the early episodes, so I&rsquo;m very curious as to when Cersei switches back to the Lannister-red, which signals power.&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of this analysis is speculative because we don&rsquo;t know the context of these costumes. When are they going to be worn? How do they fit with all the new costumes for each character? It is especially frustrating to speculate about Sansa&rsquo;s leather dress because this is the only new costume of hers that they&rsquo;ve released images of. We&rsquo;ve gotten more material about Dany and Cersei&rsquo;s new costumes - but so little about how Clapton is going to shape Sansa&rsquo;s look in this final season.</p><p>(GIF not mine)</p></p>",

This year, the excitement was even bigger because Sophie Turner had let slip that Sansa&rsquo;s would be wearing armour in the final season of the show (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183300013819/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">x</a>).&nbsp;However, the promotional photos revealed a costume that isn&rsquo;t actual armour but more of a warrior look in a symbolic sense, which fits well with another thing Turner said about Sansa&rsquo;s arc in the last season:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n\n<i>&ldquo;We the idea of it being very protective and she buttons herself up,&rdquo; Turner says. &ldquo;I wanted her to have a bit of armor and be a bit more warrior like. <b>She&rsquo;s like the warrior of Winterfell</b>.&rdquo;</i> (Sophie Turner, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Few.com%2Ftv%2F2019%2F02%2F20%2Fsophie-turner-sansa-armor-game-thrones-season-8%2F&amp;t=ZWJjMDlhNzgxMGVkZTcyY2M4ZDBiYjY5NjU0ZDliNGYwNDJkNWU1NyxaMGdLU2FadA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183118735354%2Farmoured-in-scales-some-preliminary-thoughts-on&amp;m=1\">EW</a>) \n\n<br /></p></blockquote>\n<p>This battle dress of black leather is the only one of Sansa&rsquo;s new costumes that we&rsquo;ve gotten a preview of so far - whereas we&rsquo;ve gotten a look at two new costumes for Cersei and three for Daenerys.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This new costume does have a warrior look. In <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183300013819/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">Part 1</a> of this series of essays, I took a closer look at the texture of this costume, especially in relation to the leather armour of House Tully. In <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/183521407024/a-ladys-armour-some-thoughts-on-sansa-starks\">Part 2</a>, I discussed how this textured leather dress evokes a couple of Sansa&rsquo;s earlier costumes as well as the similarities and differences it has with Cersei&rsquo;s iconic coronation dress, which is also made of black leather. In this final post, I&rsquo;ll explore how Sansa&rsquo;s new leather costume might function both as an equivalent to and a juxtaposition of the warrior look that Daenerys debuted in season 7 and carries over into season 8.</p>\n</p>",

She could write poems, play instruments, sing and dance. Not only did she do these things, but she enjoyed and was very good at doing these things. She was also very creative in the sense that she would often make up very elaborate lies in order to survive a certain situation, and when it came the time for her to become Alayne Stone, she did not only have a lot of ideas of the possible background of her character but she would add little details to her character as she became more immersed in that identity. I really wished the showrunners bothered to adapt that aspect of her character.\u00a0</p>",
