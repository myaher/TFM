        "body": "<p>Ok. Guys. I\u2019m proudly announcing that Arya Stark was my fave character since episode 1 <strike>while everyone was into Jon for whom I couldn\u2019t care less</strike>\u00a0and wow. She did it. Wow.<br/></p><p>I gotta say there\u2019s some things I didn\u2019t like in this episode tho.\u00a0</p><p>Long battle scenes where everything happens quickly are confusing to me cause I can\u2019t follow. I still have no idea of what happened to my boy Tormund or Pod or Gendry also cause if the scenes are at night everything is dark and even more confusing, which turns into boring af. I wasn\u2019t even impressed in Jamie helping Brienne and their fight together cause I couldn\u2019t tell one from another lol</p><p>Most of it all I HATE zombies. I hate zombie movies cause they\u2019re all the same, I hate the show The Walking Dead more than any other show, and a lot of parts in this episode reminded me of it and all the zombie movies ever. And since GoT is not a zombie movie I expected white walkers to be dead walking ok, but in a kinda different way. Well. Whatever. They\u2019re gone now. <b><i>THANKS TO ARYA</i></b>!</p><p>But I kinda imagined the battle would have been longer? I know there are only a few more episodes (I\u2019m already depressed uuuughh) but I imagined that such a powerful enemy and threat would have been given more space, possibly under a light where I could see them lol. I get Cersei and the throne and politics but ugh. Weren\u2019t the dead and uniting to fight them more important? Well. Whatever.</p><p>Anyway what about Ghost?Hope they didn\u2019t harm good boy Ghost them f*cking zombies.\u00a0</p><p>The scene where Arya tells Sansa to go to the crypts. Younger sister who really wanted to fight the dead, realizing how dangerous all this is, being worried for her big sister she coulnd\u2019t stand when they were younger, telling that very big sister who\u2019s also the Lady of Winterfell to go to the crypts, was amazing. Giving her the blade was amazing. Telling her to\u00a0\u2018stick em with the pointy end\u2019 was f*cking amazing, she pulled a JonSnow for her big sister I love these 2 so much</p><p>I was puzzled when the red woman arrived cause I always hated her and only when she brought Jon back she was actually useful, and I was happy she said she\u2019d be dead by dawn cause f*ck her, her tricks with fire were cool but kinda useless cause the Dothraki ended anyway? (which is sooo sad poor savage horse ppl, and there were the best of them under Dany) and I was really worried when she looked at Arya and Grey Worm like that, and the Unsullied did lose so so SO many of them (all of them? I didn\u2019t get it and I don\u2019t want to rewatch it hahah, I\u2019ll see with next episode)\u00a0but omg what she did with Arya was AMAZING. Arya was scared, she was losing hope there, she wasn\u2019t giving up because she never does, but she was sorry for Beric and Melisandre told her those words of her prophecy again which was cool even tho\n\n she didn\u2019t really get her prophecies right in the past (that b*tch) BUT when she told Arya\u00a0\u2018what do we say to the god of death\u2019 like Syrio Forel I was like AAAAAAAAAH and I still am. And her death was cool. In a\u00a0\u2018bye bitches\u2019 sort of way.</p><p>Arya and Clegane and Beric were cool, Clegane triggered by fire and scared only getting his shit together when Arya was in danger was soo cool I was sure he\u2019d die but I was so happy he didn\u2019t. Now I\u2019m hoping he won\u2019t die in the next episodes, he gotta kill the Mountain and keep on living, in Winterfell, where Arya is. (also Arya and Davos in the beginning, how cuuute)</p><p>LYANNA MORMONT. Can\u2019t even say anything about her, she was so smol and brave and I was really shocked by her death, it was disturbing in a way but also very heroic and f*ck I\u2019m so sorry she died, I really didn\u2019t want her to. Tbh I\u2019m more sorry about her than Jorah.</p><p>Sansa and Tyrion in the crypts. Wow. I loved their scenes. Their dialogues.\u00a0\u201cYou were the best of them\u201d&hellip;Sansa has become so badass in her own feminine polite way. And Tyrion is even deeper now.\u00a0</p><p>I like Missandei a lot but her comment on Sansa\u2019s words was uncalled for, I mean ofc she is loyal to Dany and she loves her so much cause she freed her, but from Sansa\u2019s pov Dany nothing like that and she defends her position as a ruler. Position that Missandei disrespected tbh. Can\u2019t say who she reminded me off but I was pissed at this character I like a lot for the first time.</p><p>Also, Sansa\u2019s utter fear of the dead but her determination to fight anyway, along with Tyrion, to defend the people in the crypts from what I called\u00a0\u2018vintage dead\u2019 resurrected from the Night King, was so powerful, her grabbing the dagger Arya gave her and Tyrion kissing her hand. Amazing. Like all Sansa\u2019s lines and Tyrion\u2019s here.</p><p>I\u2019m still trying to understand what Jon did during this fight cause Dany was much more useful and she isn\u2019t even a fighter? But girl, she picked a random sword with 2 hands and did what she had to do. Well done. In the meantime Jon screaming at dead dragon like wtf? Also, Dany\u2019s dragon attacked by wights making kinda cutesy mouse-like verses? lol. Same for ravens, I know they sound like this for real but the crows I feed have deeper more powerful caws, I know because one was calling me for food as I was watching the episode lol. Also more bird nerd comments: when Bran warged into those ravens my thought was: poor birds they\u2019re not nocturnal let them sleep, take an owl or smth xD</p><p>Jorah\u2019s death was heroic and sad, but I was devastated by Theon\u2019s. Really. I\u2019m still sad. I knew he would die, he did too many bad things in the past, but he redeemed himself so well imo that he deserved a second chance. But this is GoT so I just knew. But his moments with Sansa in the last ep&hellip;ugh. He fought so so bravely and he died seconds before Arya arrived, how sad is this? And why not give him some Valyrian steel and even more some dragonglass? YOu know, since he was the one protecting Bran&hellip;.but the plot had him dead since the beginning so.</p><p>And Bran\u2019s last words to him, it\u2019s like he gave him absolution for his sins, even though I so hoped he\u2019d pull some magic knowledge or smth to spare him. But ok. I\u2019m sad. Really. Theon was one of my faves since the start, as\u00a0\u2018problematic\u2019 as he was. He was a tormented person, torn between Stark and Greyjoys, between wanting power or following those who had it, and he clearly wasn\u2019t a leader but couldn\u2019t accept this side of him. I\u2019m so sorry for him. I shipped him with Sansa ok?</p><p><small>(ok I\u2019m not in this for the ships but I also might ship Sansa with pretty much everyone but with Theon it was better ok??)</small></p><p>Anyway.\u00a0\u201cEverything u did brought u where u are now. Home\u201d thanks Bran I\u2019m crying. Also this is the underlying theme of this arc, he also told Jamie something similar. Amazing.</p><p>I loved the music in the \u2018dead dragon destroying stuff\u2019 part, it gave everything a sort of wooly vibe, the despair and hopelessness and imminent end that Jon and pretty much everyone else perceived were tangible. And then, AND THEN. coming from out of nowhere ARYA. ARYA with her silent swift pace and her assassin moves where she excels while everyone else attacks face to face or smth. ARYA. She was my favourite character since she was just a tomboy with a thing for fighting, the first one who stood up against a Lannister doing injustice, when Jeoffrey was attacked by Nymeria that she chased away to save her life (still can\u2019t get over Lady\u2019s death btw), her narrative was the most interesting and everything she obtained was with hard work and perseverance and determination, and everything brought her here to kill the night king when she\u00a0\u2018just\u2019 wanted to obtain revenge for her family. Arya killing the night king was an amazing choice by the authors, if Jon had done it, it would have been so predictable, like anime main characters fighting the big boss when someone else could do it better.

I\u2019m proudly announcing that Arya Stark was my fave character since episode 1 <strike>while everyone was into Jon for whom I couldn\u2019t care less</strike>\u00a0and wow. She did it. Wow.<br></p><p>I gotta say there\u2019s some things I didn\u2019t like in this episode tho.\u00a0</p><p>Long battle scenes where everything happens quickly are confusing to me cause I can\u2019t follow. I still have no idea of what happened to my boy Tormund or Pod or Gendry also cause if the scenes are at night everything is dark and even more confusing, which turns into boring af. I wasn\u2019t even impressed in Jamie helping Brienne and their fight together cause I couldn\u2019t tell one from another lol</p><p>Most of it all I HATE zombies. I hate zombie movies cause they\u2019re all the same, I hate the show The Walking Dead more than any other show, and a lot of parts in this episode reminded me of it and all the zombie movies ever. And since GoT is not a zombie movie I expected white walkers to be dead walking ok, but in a kinda different way. Well. Whatever. They\u2019re gone now. <b><i>THANKS TO ARYA</i></b>!</p><p>But I kinda imagined the battle would have been longer? I know there are only a few more episodes (I\u2019m already depressed uuuughh) but I imagined that such a powerful enemy and threat would have been given more space, possibly under a light where I could see them lol. I get Cersei and the throne and politics but ugh. Weren\u2019t the dead and uniting to fight them more important? Well. Whatever.</p><p>Anyway what about Ghost?Hope they didn\u2019t harm good boy Ghost them f*cking zombies.\u00a0</p><p>The scene where Arya tells Sansa to go to the crypts. Younger sister who really wanted to fight the dead, realizing how dangerous all this is, being worried for her big sister she coulnd\u2019t stand when they were younger, telling that very big sister who\u2019s also the Lady of Winterfell to go to the crypts, was amazing. Giving her the blade was amazing. Telling her to\u00a0\u2018stick em with the pointy end\u2019 was f*cking amazing, she pulled a JonSnow for her big sister I love these 2 so much</p><p>I was puzzled when the red woman arrived cause I always hated her and only when she brought Jon back she was actually useful, and I was happy she said she\u2019d be dead by dawn cause f*ck her, her tricks with fire were cool but kinda useless cause the Dothraki ended anyway? (which is sooo sad poor savage horse ppl, and there were the best of them under Dany) and I was really worried when she looked at Arya and Grey Worm like that, and the Unsullied did lose so so SO many of them (all of them? I didn\u2019t get it and I don\u2019t want to rewatch it hahah, I\u2019ll see with next episode)\u00a0but omg what she did with Arya was AMAZING. Arya was scared, she was losing hope there, she wasn\u2019t giving up because she never does, but she was sorry for Beric and Melisandre told her those words of her prophecy again which was cool even tho\n\n she didn\u2019t really get her prophecies right in the past (that b*tch) BUT when she told Arya\u00a0\u2018what do we say to the god of death\u2019 like Syrio Forel I was like AAAAAAAAAH and I still am. And her death was cool. In a\u00a0\u2018bye bitches\u2019 sort of way.</p><p>Arya and Clegane and Beric were cool, Clegane triggered by fire and scared only getting his shit together when Arya was in danger was soo cool I was sure he\u2019d die but I was so happy he didn\u2019t. Now I\u2019m hoping he won\u2019t die in the next episodes, he gotta kill the Mountain and keep on living, in Winterfell, where Arya is. (also Arya and Davos in the beginning, how cuuute)</p><p>LYANNA MORMONT. Can\u2019t even say anything about her, she was so smol and brave and I was really shocked by her death, it was disturbing in a way but also very heroic and f*ck I\u2019m so sorry she died, I really didn\u2019t want her to. Tbh I\u2019m more sorry about her than Jorah.</p><p>Sansa and Tyrion in the crypts. Wow. I loved their scenes. Their dialogues.\u00a0\u201cYou were the best of them\u201d\u2026Sansa has become so badass in her own feminine polite way. And Tyrion is even deeper now.\u00a0</p><p>I like Missandei a lot but her comment on Sansa\u2019s words was uncalled for, I mean ofc she is loyal to Dany and she loves her so much cause she freed her, but from Sansa\u2019s pov Dany nothing like that and she defends her position as a ruler. Position that Missandei disrespected tbh. Can\u2019t say who she reminded me off but I was pissed at this character I like a lot for the first time.</p><p>Also, Sansa\u2019s utter fear of the dead but her determination to fight anyway, along with Tyrion, to defend the people in the crypts from what I called\u00a0\u2018vintage dead\u2019 resurrected from the Night King, was so powerful, her grabbing the dagger Arya gave her and Tyrion kissing her hand. Amazing. Like all Sansa\u2019s lines and Tyrion\u2019s here.</p><p>I\u2019m still trying to understand what Jon did during this fight cause Dany was much more useful and she isn\u2019t even a fighter? But girl, she picked a random sword with 2 hands and did what she had to do. Well done. In the meantime Jon screaming at dead dragon like wtf? Also, Dany\u2019s dragon attacked by wights making kinda cutesy mouse-like verses? lol. Same for ravens, I know they sound like this for real but the crows I feed have deeper more powerful caws, I know because one was calling me for food as I was watching the episode lol.

In a&nbsp;&lsquo;bye bitches&rsquo; sort of way.</p><p>Arya and Clegane and Beric were cool, Clegane triggered by fire and scared only getting his shit together when Arya was in danger was soo cool I was sure he&rsquo;d die but I was so happy he didn&rsquo;t. Now I&rsquo;m hoping he won&rsquo;t die in the next episodes, he gotta kill the Mountain and keep on living, in Winterfell, where Arya is. (also Arya and Davos in the beginning, how cuuute)</p><p>LYANNA MORMONT. Can&rsquo;t even say anything about her, she was so smol and brave and I was really shocked by her death, it was disturbing in a way but also very heroic and f*ck I&rsquo;m so sorry she died, I really didn&rsquo;t want her to. Tbh I&rsquo;m more sorry about her than Jorah.</p><p>Sansa and Tyrion in the crypts. Wow. I loved their scenes. Their dialogues.&nbsp;&ldquo;You were the best of them&rdquo;&hellip;Sansa has become so badass in her own feminine polite way. And Tyrion is even deeper now.&nbsp;</p><p>I like Missandei a lot but her comment on Sansa&rsquo;s words was uncalled for, I mean ofc she is loyal to Dany and she loves her so much cause she freed her, but from Sansa&rsquo;s pov Dany nothing like that and she defends her position as a ruler. Position that Missandei disrespected tbh. Can&rsquo;t say who she reminded me off but I was pissed at this character I like a lot for the first time.</p><p>Also, Sansa&rsquo;s utter fear of the dead but her determination to fight anyway, along with Tyrion, to defend the people in the crypts from what I called&nbsp;&lsquo;vintage dead&rsquo; resurrected from the Night King, was so powerful, her grabbing the dagger Arya gave her and Tyrion kissing her hand. Amazing. Like all Sansa&rsquo;s lines and Tyrion&rsquo;s here.</p><p>I&rsquo;m still trying to understand what Jon did during this fight cause Dany was much more useful and she isn&rsquo;t even a fighter? But girl, she picked a random sword with 2 hands and did what she had to do. Well done. In the meantime Jon screaming at dead dragon like wtf? Also, Dany&rsquo;s dragon attacked by wights making kinda cutesy mouse-like verses? lol. Same for ravens, I know they sound like this for real but the crows I feed have deeper more powerful caws, I know because one was calling me for food as I was watching the episode lol. Also more bird nerd comments: when Bran warged into those ravens my thought was: poor birds they&rsquo;re not nocturnal let them sleep, take an owl or smth xD</p><p>Jorah&rsquo;s death was heroic and sad, but I was devastated by Theon&rsquo;s. Really. I&rsquo;m still sad. I knew he would die, he did too many bad things in the past, but he redeemed himself so well imo that he deserved a second chance. But this is GoT so I just knew. But his moments with Sansa in the last ep&hellip;ugh. He fought so so bravely and he died seconds before Arya arrived, how sad is this? And why not give him some Valyrian steel and even more some dragonglass? YOu know, since he was the one protecting Bran&hellip;.but the plot had him dead since the beginning so.</p><p>And Bran&rsquo;s last words to him, it&rsquo;s like he gave him absolution for his sins, even though I so hoped he&rsquo;d pull some magic knowledge or smth to spare him. But ok. I&rsquo;m sad. Really. Theon was one of my faves since the start, as&nbsp;&lsquo;problematic&rsquo; as he was. He was a tormented person, torn between Stark and Greyjoys, between wanting power or following those who had it, and he clearly wasn&rsquo;t a leader but couldn&rsquo;t accept this side of him. I&rsquo;m so sorry for him. I shipped him with Sansa ok?</p><p><small>(ok I&rsquo;m not in this for the ships but I also might ship Sansa with pretty much everyone but with Theon it was better ok??)</small></p><p>Anyway.&nbsp;&ldquo;Everything u did brought u where u are now. Home&rdquo; thanks Bran I&rsquo;m crying. Also this is the underlying theme of this arc, he also told Jamie something similar. Amazing.</p><p>I loved the music in the &lsquo;dead dragon destroying stuff&rsquo; part, it gave everything a sort of wooly vibe, the despair and hopelessness and imminent end that Jon and pretty much everyone else perceived were tangible. And then, AND THEN. coming from out of nowhere ARYA. ARYA with her silent swift pace and her assassin moves where she excels while everyone else attacks face to face or smth. ARYA. She was my favourite character since she was just a tomboy with a thing for fighting, the first one who stood up against a Lannister doing injustice, when Jeoffrey was attacked by Nymeria that she chased away to save her life (still can&rsquo;t get over Lady&rsquo;s death btw), her narrative was the most interesting and everything she obtained was with hard work and perseverance and determination, and everything brought her here to kill the night king when she&nbsp;&lsquo;just&rsquo; wanted to obtain revenge for her family. Arya killing the night king was an amazing choice by the authors, if Jon had done it, it would have been so predictable, like anime main characters fighting the big boss when someone else could do it better. I loved this.</p><p>But I&rsquo;m sad for Theon. But <b>ARYA</b>!!!</p>",
