I have Thoughts! <b>(Spoilers below.)</b></p><!-- more --><h2>\n\nLoved:</h2><p>\u00a0- No central bullshit romance; the main relationship that had to be regained and strengthened was a friendship</p><p>\u00a0- Female stoic who gets drily snarky. Larson was controlled and quietly confident and I completely bought her as someone career-military. In fights, she also was so brilliant at making the blows look like they landed and had heft to them. She moved like an efficient blunt force instrument and like this stuff hurt.</p><p>\u00a0- The lack of the film trying to give me hour-long lectures about &ldquo;living as a woman in our society,&rdquo; because often when Marvel tends to do the gender nuance stuff, it&hellip; misses. I know I live in a patriarchal nonsense-land. I don\u2019t need my power fantasy to pause to remind me in excruciating detail how oppressed I am, rather than weaving it organically into character story.</p><p>\u00a0- Every actor really went for it. Jackson was just so much <i>fun!\u00a0</i>Jude Law was so slimy!</p><p>\u00a0- Mohawk helmet kept from the comics!</p><p><i>- Grunge!\u00a0</i></p><p>\u00a0- &ldquo;Is that Skrull&hellip; an Aussie?&rdquo; Someone said that Ben Mendelsohn\u00a0\u201cwalked in from the movie I wished CM had been,\u201d and yes, that\u2019s utterly it. It\u2019s like he didn\u2019t get to do Ragnarok and decided to show why he <i>should</i> have, dammit.</p><p>\u00a0- Gemma Chan&rsquo;s blue Winter Soldier gear as Minerva\u00a0</p><p>- Subversion of &ldquo;the aliens who look like us are the good guys&quot;\u00a0</p><p>- Goose the cat. I too skulk off to do my own thing and solve all my problems by eating them. And am actually an eldritch abomination.</p><p>- Carol all lit up like an angry star, and the hair floatiness, and I hadn\u2019t realised how much those images from the comics had sunk in until I almost airpunched at seeing that</p><p>- I love the aesthetics of the Supreme Intelligence and computer mindscrewery, and I would\u2019ve loved some more horror with that! Also transformation horror after Carol got punched with all the force of the core, wow.</p><p><br/></p><h2>\u00a0Not so pleased:\n</h2><p>- Not much development of the Kree and the Skrull; so they&rsquo;re basically &quot;humans, but blue/green.&rdquo; There aren\u2019t that many explorations of norms or societal differences, so it\u2019s basically just\u00a0\u201chere are some cool alien designs, hey look these people are green, moving on.\u201d When aliens don\u2019t feel significantly developed and <i>alien, </i>they end up feeling more like humans in paint and prosthetics.</p><p>- A lot of the jokes felt kind of weak and like they weren&rsquo;t entirely earned, but it&rsquo;s nothing worse than I&rsquo;ve seen in any other MCU movies.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0- It gestures at character development and kind of pretends to, but it doesn&rsquo;t really&hellip; do it. We&rsquo;re not given as much about Carol as a character as we were Tony or Steve in their first movies. We\u2019re told she has a flaw - she can\u2019t control her emotions! - but this is never really shown and actually ends up being a strength? But if Yoghurt The Evil Mentor is actually brainwashing her and she should embrace her emotions&hellip; awesome! But that means she goes from being a superhero soldier with awesome powers and no major character defects to&hellip; \n\n a superhero soldier with <i>even awesomer</i> powers and no major character defects. And that\u2019s OK, but it\u2019s not much of an arc? I do like Carol, but she deserves a better movie (which I also thought about Steve and The First Avenger, so&hellip;) If her character arc is the regaining memories, why is that kind of&hellip; over in two scenes, some photographs and a nice chat with her best mate, and suddenly things are OK again? Why do we never see more of her childhood and the memories that made her her? A lot of telling rather than showing that doesn\u2019t let us understand what Carol\u2019s lost.</p><p>- I mean. Is her character strength that she\u2019s human? Is it her persistence and courage? Excellent! Um&hellip; can we have moments that place particular emphasis on that sorta thing rather than blowing stuff up with Kree power?</p><p>- There are so many moments and beats I love in isolation, where I can <i>feel </i>writers\u2019 excitement as they must have pitched these character beats and setpieces. They just don\u2019t always feel earned. This movie feels like it\u2019s about a draft and a half from being a brilliant movie.</p><p>- &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t our military and alphabet agencies mostly so accepting, isn&rsquo;t this so cool, isn&rsquo;t flying so cool?&rdquo; Though&hellip; honestly, Iron Man was so much worse for this that I&rsquo;m not really going to judge CM for it.</p><p>\n\n- They wasted Lee Pace again. But then, the MCU also buried Christopher Eccleston under five layers of makeup and barely let him talk, so&hellip;<br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\n\nI\u2019ll be honest, Carol was one of my least favourite characters by far from the comics, so I didn&rsquo;t mind an MCU change (after all, look at Iron Man and the differences there, and half of Steve\u2019s backstory got changed)&hellip; but I really am missing her alcoholism and Jess and Tony, and those friendships. I am very glad for Maria, though.</p><p>(Also, I really wish we&rsquo;d got Monica Rambeau as Captain Marvel in the movies, since she&rsquo;s done it plenty in the comics.)<br/></p><p>And OK&hellip;\u00a0\n\nI admit that I&rsquo;m losing interest with the move towards more &ldquo;cosmic&rdquo; Marvel, hard as I&rsquo;m trying otherwise.\u00a0\n\nI like the idea of it\u00a0 And yet&hellip;I feel awful for it, but it&rsquo;s kind of not what I&rsquo;m here for. I <i>love</i> people who aren&rsquo;t human and those not being synonyms, and I love the brightness and aesthetic, but stuff like Guardians and CM and Ragnarok (which I enjoyed a whole lot!) prioritise awesome creature designs, jokes and aesthetic over full-on character focus. And that&rsquo;s great, if you want space opera, but that&rsquo;s always been the aspect of the comics I barely ever read because I&rsquo;m not entirely into how Marvel does sci-fi. (It does<i> near-future sci-fi</i> in really fun, sneaky ways and worldbuilds really well. But the all out &ldquo;aliens and blasters&rdquo; sci-fi not so interestingly. And I <i>love</i> aliens and blasters balls-out sci-fi, but the comics don&rsquo;t tend to do it in ways I&rsquo;m into. Also: bit too many event storylines.)\n\n</p><p>\n\nMy favourites tend to be where the plot is kind of fundamentally about character. I think my favourites are still Iron Man, the first half of The First Avenger, the &ldquo;fish out of water&rdquo; part of Thor, Winter Soldier and Civil War. IM and WS are both, despite the shitton of action in them, slow character studies that poke at their protags&rsquo; state of mind, as is CW.\n\n\nAlso quite fond of the first Avengers, though I have issues with some parts (how Whedon writes Steve and Nat, the \u201cmewling quim\u201d nonsense). It <i>knows</i> the Tesseract isn&rsquo;t the point, it knows that the point is getting these characters into a room and them being foils, and it pointedly establishes character beats for Bruce, Nat and Clint (Nat gets more than Clint, really) because it knows this is the first proper film it gets to build them in.\u00a0</p><p>That was the kind of thing I was deeply hoping for for Carol. Some quieter moments, some seconds of thought where she gets to be in a room by herself or more moments with people who know her well. There are a couple of moments that rival it, but she doesn\u2019t quite get her \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be alive\u201d or\u00a0\u201cI can do this all day\u201d or\u00a0\u201cThe truth isn\u2019t all things to all people\u201d moment. The movie bats us over the head with the montages rather than quietly laying out the character groundwork, and her life is a photo-laden series of exposition the same way the Kree-Skrull war was.\u00a0</p><p>I like her! I like this woman who makes quips and is so dramatic she has a mohawk through her Kree helmet and puts herself in danger for everyone else and is the hero aunt. I just wish there had been more Carol in Carol\u2019s movie. I\u2019m excited to see her again.<br/></p>",

We\u2019re not given as much about Carol as a character as we were Tony or Steve in their first movies. We\u2019re told she has a flaw - she can\u2019t control her emotions! - but this is never really shown and actually ends up being a strength? But if Yoghurt The Evil Mentor is actually brainwashing her and she should embrace her emotions\u2026 awesome! But that means she goes from being a superhero soldier with awesome powers and no major character defects to\u2026 \n\n a superhero soldier with <i>even awesomer</i> powers and no major character defects. And that\u2019s OK, but it\u2019s not much of an arc? I do like Carol, but she deserves a better movie (which I also thought about Steve and The First Avenger, so\u2026) If her character arc is the regaining memories, why is that kind of\u2026 over in two scenes, some photographs and a nice chat with her best mate, and suddenly things are OK again? Why do we never see more of her childhood and the memories that made her her? A lot of telling rather than showing that doesn\u2019t let us understand what Carol\u2019s lost.</p><p>- I mean. Is her character strength that she\u2019s human? Is it her persistence and courage? Excellent! Um\u2026 can we have moments that place particular emphasis on that sorta thing rather than blowing stuff up with Kree power?</p><p>- There are so many moments and beats I love in isolation, where I can <i>feel </i>writers\u2019 excitement as they must have pitched these character beats and setpieces. They just don\u2019t always feel earned. This movie feels like it\u2019s about a draft and a half from being a brilliant movie.</p><p>- \u201cAren\u2019t our military and alphabet agencies mostly so accepting, isn\u2019t this so cool, isn\u2019t flying so cool?\u201d Though\u2026 honestly, Iron Man was so much worse for this that I\u2019m not really going to judge CM for it.</p><p>\n\n- They wasted Lee Pace again.

I am very glad for Maria, though.</p><p>(Also, I really wish we\u2019d got Monica Rambeau as Captain Marvel in the movies, since she\u2019s done it plenty in the comics.)<br></p><p>And OK\u2026\u00a0\n\nI admit that I\u2019m losing interest with the move towards more \u201ccosmic\u201d Marvel, hard as I\u2019m trying otherwise.\u00a0\n\nI like the idea of it\u00a0 And yet\u2026I feel awful for it, but it\u2019s kind of not what I\u2019m here for. I <i>love</i> people who aren\u2019t human and those not being synonyms, and I love the brightness and aesthetic, but stuff like Guardians and CM and Ragnarok (which I enjoyed a whole lot!) prioritise awesome creature designs, jokes and aesthetic over full-on character focus. And that\u2019s great, if you want space opera, but that\u2019s always been the aspect of the comics I barely ever read because I\u2019m not entirely into how Marvel does sci-fi. (It does<i> near-future sci-fi</i> in really fun, sneaky ways and worldbuilds really well. But the all out \u201caliens and blasters\u201d sci-fi not so interestingly. And I <i>love</i> aliens and blasters balls-out sci-fi, but the comics don\u2019t tend to do it in ways I\u2019m into. Also: bit too many event storylines.)\n\n</p><p>\n\nMy favourites tend to be where the plot is kind of fundamentally about character. I think my favourites are still Iron Man, the first half of The First Avenger, the \u201cfish out of water\u201d part of Thor, Winter Soldier and Civil War. IM and WS are both, despite the shitton of action in them, slow character studies that poke at their protags\u2019 state of mind, as is CW.\n\n\nAlso quite fond of the first Avengers, though I have issues with some parts (how Whedon writes Steve and Nat, the \u201cmewling quim\u201d nonsense). It <i>knows</i> the Tesseract isn\u2019t the point, it knows that the point is getting these characters into a room and them being foils, and it pointedly establishes character beats for Bruce, Nat and Clint (Nat gets more than Clint, really) because it knows this is the first proper film it gets to build them in.\u00a0</p><p>That was the kind of thing I was deeply hoping for for Carol. Some quieter moments, some seconds of thought where she gets to be in a room by herself or more moments with people who know her well. There are a couple of moments that rival it, but she doesn\u2019t quite get her \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be alive\u201d or\u00a0\u201cI can do this all day\u201d or\u00a0\u201cThe truth isn\u2019t all things to all people\u201d moment. The movie bats us over the head with the montages rather than quietly laying out the character groundwork, and her life is a photo-laden series of exposition the same way the Kree-Skrull war was.\u00a0</p><p>I like her! I like this woman who makes quips and is so dramatic she has a mohawk through her Kree helmet and puts herself in danger for everyone else and is the hero aunt. I just wish there had been more Carol in Carol\u2019s movie. I\u2019m excited to see her again.<br></p>",

(It does<i> near-future sci-fi</i> in really fun, sneaky ways and worldbuilds really well. But the all out &ldquo;aliens and blasters&rdquo; sci-fi not so interestingly. And I <i>love</i> aliens and blasters balls-out sci-fi, but the comics don&rsquo;t tend to do it in ways I&rsquo;m into. Also: bit too many event storylines.)\n\n</p><p>\n\nMy favourites tend to be where the plot is kind of fundamentally about character. I think my favourites are still Iron Man, the first half of The First Avenger, the &ldquo;fish out of water&rdquo; part of Thor, Winter Soldier and Civil War. IM and WS are both, despite the shitton of action in them, slow character studies that poke at their protags&rsquo; state of mind, as is CW.\n\n\nAlso quite fond of the first Avengers, though I have issues with some parts (how Whedon writes Steve and Nat, the &ldquo;mewling quim&rdquo; nonsense). It <i>knows</i> the Tesseract isn&rsquo;t the point, it knows that the point is getting these characters into a room and them being foils, and it pointedly establishes character beats for Bruce, Nat and Clint (Nat gets more than Clint, really) because it knows this is the first proper film it gets to build them in.&nbsp;</p><p>That was the kind of thing I was deeply hoping for for Carol. Some quieter moments, some seconds of thought where she gets to be in a room by herself or more moments with people who know her well. There are a couple of moments that rival it, but she doesn&rsquo;t quite get her &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be alive&rdquo; or&nbsp;&ldquo;I can do this all day&rdquo; or&nbsp;&ldquo;The truth isn&rsquo;t all things to all people&rdquo; moment. The movie bats us over the head with the montages rather than quietly laying out the character groundwork, and her life is a photo-laden series of exposition the same way the Kree-Skrull war was.&nbsp;</p><p>I like her! I like this woman who makes quips and is so dramatic she has a mohawk through her Kree helmet and puts herself in danger for everyone else and is the hero aunt. I just wish there had been more Carol in Carol&rsquo;s movie. I&rsquo;m excited to see her again.<br /></p>",

How so? Girl gets kidnapped by an enemy force that tries to subjugate other people and make the oppressed seem to be the enemy. Also the main character has powers beyond the scope of her natural abilities. The only thing is that Cara seems to be aware when she is using her powers while (of what I have watched of She-ra), that is not the case for Adora/She-Ra. That honestly kept jumping at me and I am not well versed at either of these stories but that connection caught my eye.</p><p>2. It was not SJW propoganda. Sure it had it\u2019s\u00a0\u201cgirl power\u201d moments, but it did it a lot better than the script of\u00a0\u201cSupergirl\u201d. Getting up when you fall, rising when people try to put you down, I drink that juice and we should all too.\u00a0</p><p>3. I am conflicted with how easily Carol uses her powers. The photon beams and flying and being able to fly at light speed\u00a0 are interesting but she learns very quickly with how to use them to her advantage, but she is a trained warrior. I don\u2019t want her to be the caricature\u00a0\u201cstrong woman\u201d with nothing beyond that but how much development can you fit in a 2 hour movie.</p><p>4. I actually like the character. Brie Larson has a very nice voice, and she is very playful. She smiles, omg, I cannot tell you how much I love that she smiles. She is playful, she has fun, she is funny, but I kinda feel like the story took\u00a0 a lot more away from us. There was obviously a lot more to Carol\u2019s character that I would have loved to see when they were showing her memories but again. It\u2019s a 2 hour movie.\u00a0</p><p>5. Can she really trust the Skrull though?\u00a0</p><p>6. I loved the little Stan Lee homage. The train scene was precious.\u00a0</p><p>7. So it seems like people\u2019s theories were not correct. People thought she was in the quantum realm and would have come into contact with Ant Man. But it seems like she was just away fighting to end the war, so she was not just passively laying low on Earth. Or maybe the quantum theory is still correct. Who knows???</p><p>Honestly, solid movie. Give it an 8/10. It didn\u2019t blow me away but it was still good and enjoyable.</p>",

I don&rsquo;t want her to be the caricature&nbsp;&ldquo;strong woman&rdquo; with nothing beyond that but how much development can you fit in a 2 hour movie.</p><p>4. I actually like the character. Brie Larson has a very nice voice, and she is very playful. She smiles, omg, I cannot tell you how much I love that she smiles. She is playful, she has fun, she is funny, but I kinda feel like the story took&nbsp; a lot more away from us. There was obviously a lot more to Carol&rsquo;s character that I would have loved to see when they were showing her memories but again. It&rsquo;s a 2 hour movie.&nbsp;</p><p>5. Can she really trust the Skrull though?&nbsp;</p><p>6. I loved the little Stan Lee homage. The train scene was precious.&nbsp;</p><p>7. So it seems like people&rsquo;s theories were not correct. People thought she was in the quantum realm and would have come into contact with Ant Man. But it seems like she was just away fighting to end the war, so she was not just passively laying low on Earth. Or maybe the quantum theory is still correct. Who knows???</p><p>Honestly, solid movie. Give it an 8/10. It didn&rsquo;t blow me away but it was still good and enjoyable.</p>",
