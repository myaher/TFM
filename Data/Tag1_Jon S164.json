To add insult to injury they made her wear a damn ascot! Instead of looking like Jon\u2019s lover her ass is actually looking like his aunt!</p><p>If Dany is supposed to be the YMBQ and victorious in her quest for the Iron Throne, why on earth would the show literally give her the worst outfit she\u2019s ever had on this show in the season that matters the most! Throughout the series Daenerys has probably had some of the best outfits on the show. They flattered her and made her look incredibly beautiful. But this outfit is a complete mess and if anything, Dany\u2019s outfit is supposed to fucking slay this season!!  </p><h2>It doesn\u2019t make sense! Unless&hellip;..</h2><p>There is a narrative purpose for this. Maybe just maybe Dany\u2019s outfit reflects the type of season she\u2019s going to have. The same goes with Sansa. Maybe the reason why Sansa looks beautiful, confident and sexy all at the same time is because Sansa is about to glow up and truly blossom into her own and who she\u2019s supposed to be in season 8.</p><p>My last point is this. Is it by accident that they\u2019re making Sansa look exceptionally beautiful while Jon\u2019s around?! I don\u2019t think so. We\u2019ve had two clips now where Jon can\u2019t seem to take his eyes off of his sister/cousin even while Dany is right next to him. So yeah&hellip;. I\u2019m just gonna leave it at that.</p><p>*Also this is in no way comparing how beautiful Sophie Turner and Emilia Clarke are! They are both stunners! I\u2019m simply making an observation pertaining to the characters and the outfit/look choices the show runners purposely chose for them this season!</p>",

But I love how their stories are intertwined and parallel each other. Also that I hate Jonsa and the shippers and the way they&rsquo;ve just barged their way into this Fandom and treated everyone like trash. So if I must pick a side in the ship war they started it&rsquo;s definitely Jonerys.</p><p>We&rsquo;ll start with &ldquo;political!Jon&rdquo; which at first I thought it was just Jon being political, but apparently not ahaha. It&rsquo;s Jon lying to Dany? </p><h2>1| <b>&ldquo;Jon is lying to Daenerys / using her&rdquo;</b></h2><p>The argument for this is that Jon has been using Daenerys for her dragons and armies. They say this with weight because of when Jon went undercover with the Wildlings and lied to Ygritte. But there&rsquo;s something they don&rsquo;t say; something they conveniently left out:</p><p>Jon was kidnapped, he had to lie to get out of the situation he was in with the Wildlings. Jon did what he had to do then. But, Jon willingly went to Dragonstone. Willingly told Daenerys everything; telling her he was King before kneeling. Willginly bent the knee.</p><p><b>The difference between these situations; free will and willingness. </b></p><p>But let&rsquo;s get further into this: Daenerys is obviously pregnant. They dropped a ridiculously amount of foreshadowing throughout S7. So this&hellip; <i>political!Jon</i> would just do this to the mother of his child?</p><p>Also let&rsquo;s not forget that &ldquo;he loved her &mdash; she loved him&rdquo; played over them. Speaking about the past and the present. You don&rsquo;t need to be a qualified brain surgeon to understand what they&rsquo;re laying down here.</p><p><strike>But this theory is onto something&hellip; There&rsquo;s definitely a betrayer with Stark blood. They just don&rsquo;t have brunette hair ;)</strike>. <b>Whoops!</b></p><h2>2| <b>&ldquo;Blood&rdquo;</b></h2><p>Nice way to say incest.</p><p>But it&rsquo;s funny, really. This one always cracks me up.</p><p>They say that Jon will leave Daenerys when he finds out she&rsquo;s his aunt, and will then get together with Sansa - who&rsquo;s his cousin; someone who he thought was his sister his entire life, and vice versa. </p><p>You&rsquo;ll criticise Jonerys for being incest on one hand, but praise Jonsa on the other? </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p><b>That being said:</b> if you just dislike Jonerys for the incest but also hate Jonsa as well, then that&rsquo;s perfectly understandable; I understand why you will not like Jonerys.</p><p>This is merely just me poking holes in Jonsa&rsquo;s hate towards Jonerys. It&rsquo;s not about the average persons justified reason to hate something like incest; so you, average person, I hope you have a good day :) this isn&rsquo;t being directed at you.</p><h2>3| <b>&ldquo;the Iron Throne; Northern Independence&rdquo;</b></h2><p>Since Dany wants to sit on the Throne, as she believe she&rsquo;s the rightful heir, and that Jon; who doesn&rsquo;t know this, is the actual rightful heir. </p><p>Of course this stems from them wanting Jon as king and Sansa as his queen, so there&rsquo;ll hate Jonerys (and Dany too; but I already made a post about all the Dany hate). <b>That being said;</b></p><p>It&rsquo;s not like Jon and Dany would be differing ideals. Jon wants independence for the North. Dany wants to break the wheel of power. That could bring in; independence for each kingdom, but living under one government (with Jon and Dany on top). Sort of like the Commonwealth, with the UK / Australia / New Zealand / the other ones. All their own countries, just under one umbrella.</p><p>Also, Dany has said in the books, when finding out Aegon (Young Griff) is alive, she wanted to rule with him together. </p><h2>4| <b>&ldquo;Fan Service&rdquo;</b></h2><p>I remember this one two years ago during Season 7.</p><p>While yes S7 seemed a bit rushed. Because it had to be, to say Jonerys is nothing but fan service is lunacy&hellip;</p><p>GRRM has told D&amp;D what happens; he&rsquo;s told D&amp;D how it ends, who dies, everything; because the books won&rsquo;t be finished until like 2097. Do you really think they would have just added in Jonerys for the lols?</p><p><b>Of course not. This has been coming for well over 22 years. </b></p><p>One good look at the characters and what they&rsquo;ve been through you&rsquo;ll see that they circle around each other. They have been paralleling each other for years. Their meeting, and joining was something that was unavoidable.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p><b>That&rsquo;s really all I can think of at this point, of course I&rsquo;m running on fumes; lol I love insomnia. </b></p><h2><b>There is definitely more but can&rsquo;t think rn</b></h2><p>But yeah, this all seems to come from the crackship that was born from Season 6.
