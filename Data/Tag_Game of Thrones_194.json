Somebody said that they shipped her with Edric and the more I think about it the more I like this ship. The little I've seen of him I like (He seems to be a sweet, polite, nice boy and I think they will mesh well)  Wishful thinking on my part since I'm not a fan of Jon, don't like anybody else and I want to see Dorne in season 8.  What do you think?",

From what I remember he broke away from Lady Stoneheart because he didn\u2019t agree with her actions. The more I think about it, the better this ship looks.</p><p>I\u2019m with you anon on the shipping part. I don\u2019t really have a Sansa ship. I used to be into Sansaery but I\u2019m indifferent to it because of Margaery having sex with an underage boy which reminded me that Sansa is much younger than her. I don\u2019t care for Jon though I like the Jonsa fandom. Sansa x Brienne has an age gap and that spark that would draw me in doesn\u2019t exist. Sansa x Dany has potential because of the whole enemies to friends to lovers but then again I\u2019ve only seen soft lesbian aesthetics which I find unrealistic. Sansa x Theon is OK. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s hard for me to find a Sansa ship that gives me feelings.</p>",
