Andi is CONSISTENTLY wearing cute clothes and serving LOOKS. Her fashion sense is not only unique, but very cute. It suits her very well in addition to just having a good aesthetic</p><p>2. <b>Cyrus</b>- your boy dresses nice. He dresses to impress. He also has a very specific fashion sense that&rsquo;s unique. An overall fashionable gay</p><p>3. <b>Amber</b>- rocking queen bitch femme lesbian vibes and i like it</p><p>4. <b>Walker</b>- artsy boy aesthetic. Nicely done. His hair is dyed and that&rsquo;s pretty neat. Also looks like he knows what he&rsquo;s doing with the clothes he wears</p><p>5. <b>Bex</b>- She&rsquo;s hot and punk and I love her. Not higher on the list because throwing on a band t shirt is not equivalent to fashion</p><p>6. <b>Buffy</b>- Shes got some cute outfits, but I fail to really nail down a specific sense of style from her. She&rsquo;s all over the place\u2014 I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s found a particular style that she&rsquo;s comfortable in. Has lots of cute hairstyles though</p><p>7. <b>TJ</b>- I KNOW this is controversial. Whether or not TJ&rsquo;s fashion sense is &ldquo;good&rdquo; has been a widespread debate, but hear me out here. He has a developed sense of style that&rsquo;s distinct and suits him. Sure he makes a few questionable choices, but haven&rsquo;t we all?</p><p>8. <b>Cece</b>- she&rsquo;s put together but there&rsquo;s no intrigue. Although i suppose it&rsquo;s suitable for a grandma</p><p>9. <b>Iris</b>- nothing incredibly special but I haven&rsquo;t seen her look bad. Not really a fashion sense as much as it is just wearing whatever other people are wearing</p><p>10. <b>Marty</b>- doesn&rsquo;t dress bad but doesn&rsquo;t dress well necessarily. I get no personality from his clothing</p><p>11. <b>Jonah</b>- very similar to Marty. His taste in clothing is just\u2026 kinda boring. Doesn&rsquo;t interest me. Never sparks conversation</p><p>12. <b>Bowie</b>- Bowie looks like he just rolled out of bed and/or a situation where he&rsquo;s been held captive for 10 years. Whether this &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if there could be an actual family of birds living in my hair&rdquo; look is intentional or not, it ain&rsquo;t it chief. Also he used to wear a puka shell necklace and that automatically moves him to the bottom of the list</p>",

        "body": "<p>Story Summary: When Cyrus finds a playlist on TJ\u2019s desktop full of old love songs, he realizes that TJ has never been a scary basketball guy but rather a huge sap. TJ just wished Cyrus could realize that all of those songs remind him of a certain boy who likes chocolate chocolate chip muffins without telling him directly.</p><p>With insecurities and fears almost set in stone, it\u2019s hard for TJ to admit that he has a heart aching crush on Cyrus who is trying to avoid just that. Of course, it doesn\u2019t seem like both of them are trying to get over each other when they\u2019re always together.<br/></p><p><a href=\"https://lgbtyrus.tumblr.com/post/177417182754/tjs-playlist-chapter-1\">Chapter 1</a> | <a href=\"https://lgbtyrus.tumblr.com/post/180884290199/tjs-playlist-chapter-15\">Previous Chapter</a> | Also up on Ao3 + Wattpad</p><p>Words: 2,983</p><!-- more --><p>Cyrus wasn\u2019t lying about his mom. She was showering them in\nsnacks, forcing TJ to call her Leslie, poking conversation with him here and\nthere about his parents. She really liked gossip, but Cyrus tended to shoo her\noff before TJ could say anything too personal.</p><p>The boys were set up at the couch, watching random movies on\nNetflix until dinner arrived. Cyrus was on one end of the couch and TJ was at\nthe other end, both dying to lean over to cuddle with the other. All they could\ndo was blow kisses at each other when they were both alone in the living room. </p><p>TJ quickly noticed the difference between him and Cyrus\u2019\nhome. Cyrus\u2019 home was full of color, a lot more modern than his goth parent\u2019s\ndecoration. He liked it. He was very appreciative of the baby photos of Cyrus\nstrewn all over the place. Most of them were horribly photoshopped, but he\nstill found them adorable.</p><p>He kept eyeing the piano in the corner of the room. His GG\nhad one just like it, only in white. He had left it for Amber, but it didn\u2019t\nfit inside their home, so it got sent to a storage locker he was almost sure\nthey didn\u2019t pay for three months. It might\u2019ve been bided off, and his dad\ndidn\u2019t have the heart to tell them. He made a note to ask later.</p><p>\u201cHey, Cy,\u201d TJ asked, his eyes sticking on the keys of the\ninstrument, \u201cwho here plays piano?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom does,\u201d Cyrus answered before shrugging, \u201cwell, she\nused to. A long time ago. Specifically, when before I turned seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened when you were seven?\u201d TJ asked. During Cyrus\u2019\nquick pause, TJ guessed it himself. </p><p>\u201cThe divorce,\u201d Cyrus said before TJ could stop him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d TJ found himself saying, looking over at his\nboyfriend with sad eyes.</p><p>Cyrus gave him a small smile, \u201cIt was for the best. I\u2019m glad\nyou didn\u2019t have to through that.\u201d TJ managed to smile back before looking back\nat the piano. He wondered if he still remembered how to play. He\u2019d probably\nsuck.</p><p>Cyrus gave him a small smile, \u201cIt was for the best. I\u2019m glad\nyou didn\u2019t have to through that.\u201d TJ managed to smile back before looking back\nat the piano. His fingers started tapping on his thighs, remembering what it\nwas like to press keys. \u201cDo you know how to play it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of,\u201d TJ shook his hand. \u201cMy GG and Nana always taught\nme and Amber because we liked it. Amber is the one that was always better than\nme. I probably could\u2019ve been better, but I never pursued it because of\nbasketball..\u201d</p><p>\u201cBall is life,\u201d Cyrus snickered, making TJ playfully roll\nhis eyes.</p><p>\u201cHey, if I\u2019m going to do something, I have to be the best at\nit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell if you know anything on the piano that you think\nyou\u2019re the best at, you can go play with it.\u201d</p><p>TJ\u2019s eyes lit up, making Cyrus grin at TJ\u2019s sudden\nexcitement, \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Cyrus said. \u201cWe have a guy come clean it every once\nin a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople clean pianos for living?\u201d TJ raised an eyebrow,\nalready standing up.</p><p>\u201cI thought the guy who knew random facts about everything\nwould know,\u201d Cyrus told him, following TJ to the piano.</p><p>\u201cPiano is short for pianoforte, which is Italian,\u201d TJ stuck\nhis tongue out at Cyrus before sitting down at the bench. \u201cSit,\u201d TJ said,\npatting the spot next to him. Cyrus smiled and sat next to his boyfriend as he\nstarted pressing keys, trying to remember what to do.</p><p>\u201cDo you know any songs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d TJ whispered, his hands positioning themselves, \u201cthis\nis the song that was stuck in my head when dad left.\u201d</p><p>TJ knew Cyrus would recognize Star Dust by Doris Day. It was\non C.C.C.M. after all. TJ messed up a couple of notes, but he seemed to\nremember most of it. Cyrus stared at TJ\u2019s hands in awe and whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re\nso talented.\u201d TJ missed another key as his heart did a small leap inside of his\nchest. \u00a0</p><p>TJ only played the song for less than a minute before stopping\nand saying, \u201cThat\u2019s all I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Leslie clapped, making TJ jump up a little on the\nbench, \u201cit\u2019s been a while since this room was filled with music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a great piano,\u201d TJ blushed, not knowing what to\nsay.</p><p>\u201cYou have great skills, kid,\u201d Norman told him, making TJ\nwant to shrink down and disappear. He felt like he had done horribly. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a fat minute sinc- I mean, a while since I\u2019ve\nplayed,\u201d TJ told him with a tight-lipped smile, \u201cbut thank you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGreat job,\u201d Cyrus whispered, lightly nudging TJ, making him\nstraighten up and smile genuinely.</p><p>Leslie approached the piano with her phone up and asked, \u201cCan\nI take a picture of you boys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Cyrus muttered, covering his face with his hands.</p><p>TJ smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s fine with me.\u201d Cyrus turned away from his\nmom to give TJ a death glare, only making TJ\u2019s grin widen. </p><p>\u201cCome on, Cyrus, smile. You never liked playing the piano,\u201d Leslie\ncommented, convincing Cyrus to turn back around and look at the camera.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t like my teacher,\u201d Cyrus corrected her. Leslie didn\u2019t\nsay anything else as she got different angles of them.</p><p>\u201cTJ,\u201d she said after snapping a few photos, \u201cyou have such a\nbeautiful smile, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d TJ told her, \u201cI got it from my great grandpa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, you\u2019re going to lift his ego up,\u201d Cyrus said, standing\nup from the bench. </p><p>\u201cHe deserves it,\u201d she said. \u201cHow long did you say it was since\nyou played?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d TJ bit his lip, \u201cabout two years ago. Might be less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a pianist, you never forget,\u201d she smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cYou should play something,\u201d TJ told her, standing up and\ngoing next to Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t,\u201d she shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s been even longer\nfor me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard you play,\u201d Norman commented, making\neveryone in the room turn to look at him. TJ felt Cyrus tense up next to him,\nand it was really hard to not reach out to grab his hand. \u201cIt\u2019d be nice to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it a shot, Leslie,\u201d TJ encouraged\nher. Calling her Leslie seemed to do it. She sat down and pressed a few keys\nbefore breaking out into a melody. </p><p><b><i>I love you for sentimental\nreasons</i></b></p><p><b><i>I hope you do believe me</i></b></p><p><b><i>I&rsquo;ll give you my heart</i></b></p><p>Cyrus was the one that reached\nfor TJ\u2019s hand, squeezing it. TJ looked at Cyrus, and he seemed happy, content\nwith the situation. He hadn\u2019t messed up.</p><p><b><i>I love you and you alone were\nmeant for me</i></b></p><p><b><i>Please, give your loving heart to\nme</i></b></p><p><b><i>And say we&rsquo;ll never part</i></b></p><p>After a minute or so, Leslie\nstopped and whispered, \u201cThere, that\u2019s it for me. For today, at least.\u201d TJ could\u2019ve\nsworn she was about to cry as they were clapping. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really great,\u201d TJ told\nher as Norman went to sit on the bench next to her. </p><p>\u201cYou really are absolutely\namazing,\u201d Norman said, giving her a kiss on top of the head. </p><p>\u201cThank you, boys,\u201d Leslie let\nout a cheery laugh, wiping below her eyes. \u201cThis was nice. Thank you, TJ.\u201d</p><p>TJ knew he was blushing as he\nlet out a barely audible, \u201cYeah, it was nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner will be ready in\nfifteen. You boys should go wash your hands,\u201d Leslie turned her head to look at\nthem, Cyrus quickly letting go of TJ\u2019s hand before she could see. </p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Cyrus said, \u201cI\u2019m going\nto show TJ my room, then.\u201d TJ couldn\u2019t help but smile before following Cyrus up\nthe stairs of his house. They seemed to have a couple of spare rooms. They\nwalked by a few before Cyrus led them into what was his room. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have\nas much personality as yours,\u201d Cyrus turned to TJ,\u201d but it has a bed.\u201d It was\ndecorated like the rest of the house but in blue, the occasional knick-knacks\nmaking it more Cyrus-like.</p><p>TJ teased him, \u201cI feel like a 30-year-old\nman lives here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Cyrus lightly nudged TJ\u2019s\narm, furrowing his brows.</p><p>\u201cJust kidding,\u201d TJ put his arm\naround him, placing a kiss on the side of his forehead. \u201cI love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, just like my parents hate\nyou,\u201d Cyrus smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou think they like me?\u201d TJ\nasked him, pulling his arm back and starting to walk around.</p><p>\u201cYou kidding me? I would <i>beg </i>my mom to play that song for me all\nthe time, and she never wanted to after the divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe played it for you, then,\u201d\nTJ told him, looking closer at his desk where a leather journal was shut close.\n</p><p>\u201cNo, she played it for you,\u201d\nCyrus shook his head, trailing behind TJ.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d TJ fought, \u201cit was for\nyou. She could\u2019ve played any song she knew for me, and she chose the song she\u2019s\nbeen wanting to play the most all these years. She chose the song you\u2019ve been\nwanting to hear.\u201d Cyrus stayed silent, even when TJ reached for his journal. \u201cCan\nI open this?\u201d TJ asked him, looking back at him. Cyrus\u2019 nose was red, and he\nwas biting his lip. TJ immediately dropped the journal back on the desk and\nwent to hug Cyrus, \u201cHey,\u201d he whispered, rubbing his hand on his back, \u201cwhat\u2019s\nwrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just really happy she\u2019s\nplaying again,\u201d Cyrus told him, hugging back TJ tightly. TJ smiled into the\nshorter boy\u2019s hair. \u201cThank you. You\u2019re honestly incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCy,\u201d TJ murmured, his face being\nclouded by a crimson blush. </p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d Cyrus pulled away,\ntaking in a deep breath and rubbing away the water in his eyes, TJ watching his\nface carefully every single second. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d TJ found\nhimself asking out of nowhere.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cyrus laughed\nnervously. </p><p>\u201cI want to kiss you,\u201d TJ caught\nhimself laughing along before Cyrus turned around to make sure the door was\nclosed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why not,\u201d Cyrus\nshrugged, looking back into TJ\u2019s eyes. TJ gave him a smile before leaning down\nto kiss him, his lips finding Cyrus\u2019 familiar ones. They parted for a moment where\nCyrus managed to tell him, \u201cI really like you,\u201d before initiating another kiss,\nhis arms around TJ\u2019s neck to pull him in closer.</p><p>\u201cI really like you, too,\u201d TJ lightly\npressed his nose against Cyrus\u2019 when they stopped. \u201cAre you still nervous about\ncoming out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d Cyrus admitted, quickly\npecking TJ on the lips, \u201cbut you being here makes it easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d TJ told him,\nfeeling his heart beat furiously in his chest, wanting to take in every single\nsecond with Cyrus like it were silk slipping through his fingers.</p><p>\u201cAre you nervous?\u201d Cyrus asked\nhim, running a finger on the side of TJ\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d TJ said. \u201cBut no\nmatter what happens, we\u2019re going to be fine. I know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Cyrus smiled at\nhim.</p><p>TJ gave him another quick kiss\nbefore asking, \u201cCan I go through your journal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my deep and most\npersonal thoughts intrigues you so much?\u201d Cyrus raised a brow at his boyfriend,\nletting go of him to go pick up the journal. </p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d TJ said excitedly\nwith a big grin. </p><p>Cyrus reached over with one\nhand to pinch one of his cheeks, \u201cYou really do have a pretty smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe the word used was\nbeautiful,\u201d TJ grinned, moving his cheek into Cyrus\u2019 hand until he was able to\nkiss his hand.</p><p>Cyrus playfully rolled his\neyes, \u201cYour inner jock is showing.\u201d TJ swiped the journal out of Cyrus\u2019 hand\nand ran to a corner of the room. \u201cTeej!\u201d Cyrus chased after TJ, \u201cYou know this\nis a battle I can\u2019t win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d TJ said, jumping on\nthe bed before rolling off and standing up again.</p><p>\u201cShow off,\u201d Cyrus gave up, throwing\nhimself on his stomach on the bed. TJ sat at the end of the bed and opened the\njournal, going through the pages. The first entry was from the 6<sup>th</sup>\ngrade. TJ skimmed a lot of the pages, only stopping to look at the ones that had\npictures taped to them. There were a lot with the Good Hair Crew, and the occasional\nfew with his family.</p><p>TJ pointed at a picture in the\nplace he recognized to be Andi\u2019s house. \u201cWhy does it say \u2018me, Buffy, Andi, and\nAndi\u2019s parents\u2019 on the bottom of this photo? I thought those were her grandparents?\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d Cyrus said, dragging\nhimself with his arms over to TJ. \u201cLong story short, Andi thought her whole life\nthat her grandparents were her parents until Bex told her that she was her mom,\nnot her sister, and then Bowie showed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wild,\u201d TJ said,\nlooking at the photo one more time, recognizing Andi\u2019s grandma as the one who\ninterrupted what could\u2019ve been their first kiss. He wouldn\u2019t change it, though.\n\u201cI like Andi\u2019s grandma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndi\u2019s grandpa looks a whole\nlot like John Cena.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus let out a snort, \u201cYour mind,\nI swear.\u201d TJ skipped through a lot of pages, starting to find a lot of pictures\nof Jonah Beck. He slowed down, seeing more Ultimate Frisbee things pile up. There\nwere other pictures strewn in occasionally, but he saw a lot of the same smile\nwith dimples. </p><p>\u201cYou guys got really close to\nJonah because of Ultimate?\u201d TJ asked him. </p><p>Cyrus slowly sat up, positioning\nhimself next to TJ, \u201cUhrm, yeah.\u201d TJ and Cyrus both stared down at a page where\nthere was a single polaroid selfie of him and Jonah, happy faces, stars, and\nhearts doodled all over the page. \u201cLook, TJ,\u201d Cyrus started to say.</p><p>\u201cBoys,\u201d Leslie called out from\noutside the room, \u201cdinner is served.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn our way,\u201d Cyrus said, already\nstanding up. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you later, okay? Let\u2019s go wash our hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d TJ told him, standing\nup and setting the journal closed on the end of the bed. He had a feeling he already\nknew.</p><p>-</p><p>As the end of dinner\napproached, Cyrus felt the pit in his stomach grow bigger. The clink of kitchenware\nseemed to echo louder in his head as every minute went by, the voices of his\nparents and TJ being less audible. </p><p>He was already nervous about\nhaving to do this two more times, and he wasn\u2019t even done with the first one.</p><p>TJ held his hand under the\ntable for a few seconds every once in a while, noticing that it was getting closer\nto the time. Cyrus regretted not rehearsing anything or writing down what to say.\nHe had originally decided against it because he didn\u2019t want to stress out about\nit so much. He was starting to regret a lot of his decisions at the moment,\nincluding some he made in the third grade.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 throat burned dry as he\nfound the courage to start the conversation. He waited until his mom started\nstacking dishes, and he finally said, \u201cHey,\u201d he licked his chapping lips, \u201cI\nneed to talk to you two.\u201d Leslie and Frank quickly looked at TJ and Cyrus said,\n\u201cYes, TJ has to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Cyrus?\u201d Leslie\nset the dishes she was holding back down, giving him her full attention. Norman\nwas doing the same, and Cyrus had never felt their gazes so heavy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know how to\nsay this,\u201d Cyrus rubbing the back of his neck with one hand, the other one\nreaching out to hold on tightly to TJ\u2019s own. Cyrus inhaled before telling them,\n\u201cI\u2019m gay.\u201d There was only a quick silence, Cyrus feeling light and heavy at the\nsame time. </p><p>\u201cCyrus,\u201d Leslie placed her\nhands over her heart, \u201cI love you so so much. Come here,\u201d she stood up at the\nsame time as Norman. Cyrus felt his heart soar, his feet seeming to take flight\nas he walked over to his parents to hug them.</p><p>It was okay. Him and TJ would\nbe okay. He was okay</p><p>When they let him go, he immediately\nturned to look at TJ who was smiling sheepishly at the scene before him. </p><p>\u201cAm I allowed to make an\nassumption?\u201d Norman asked Cyrus, now also smiling at TJ.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Cyrus smiled.</p><p>\u201cTJ is your boyfriend?\u201d Norman\nasked him merrily, making the two younger boys feel so much better about\neverything. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat would be correct,\u201d Cyrus told\nthem with a smile.</p><p>\u201cTJ, come here,\u201d Leslie motioned\nhim over with her arm. TJ hesitantly got up, and when he went over to the other\nside of the table, Leslie pulled him into a hug. \u201cDon\u2019t think I haven\u2019t noticed\nhow much happier Cyrus has been lately. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus exhaled. </p><p>-</p><p>Cyrus somehow snuck TJ back up\ninto his room without his parents noticing. They probably wouldn\u2019t be allowed\nto be alone in his bedroom anytime soon, so he decided to take him back up\nbefore they took TJ home. </p><p>As soon as Cyrus shut the\ndoor, TJ pulled him in for a hug, knocking the wind out of him. \u201cTJ,\u201d Cyrus\nlaughed, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d TJ put him down, a huge\nsmile on his face, \u201cI\u2019m just so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for being with me,\u201d\nCyrus smiled up him.</p><p>\u201cI always want to be there for\nyou, okay?\u201d TJ said, bending down to give him a quick kiss. \u201cCan I finish going\nthrough the journal now?\u201d Cyrus bit, his lip. He knew he had to tell him about\nthe crush he had on Jonah. It was only fair.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Cyrus nodded, going over\nto the end of his bed with TJ.

She was showering them in\nsnacks, forcing TJ to call her Leslie, poking conversation with him here and\nthere about his parents. She really liked gossip, but Cyrus tended to shoo her\noff before TJ could say anything too personal.</p><p>The boys were set up at the couch, watching random movies on\nNetflix until dinner arrived. Cyrus was on one end of the couch and TJ was at\nthe other end, both dying to lean over to cuddle with the other. All they could\ndo was blow kisses at each other when they were both alone in the living room. </p><p>TJ quickly noticed the difference between him and Cyrus\u2019\nhome. Cyrus\u2019 home was full of color, a lot more modern than his goth parent\u2019s\ndecoration. He liked it. He was very appreciative of the baby photos of Cyrus\nstrewn all over the place. Most of them were horribly photoshopped, but he\nstill found them adorable.</p><p>He kept eyeing the piano in the corner of the room. His GG\nhad one just like it, only in white. He had left it for Amber, but it didn\u2019t\nfit inside their home, so it got sent to a storage locker he was almost sure\nthey didn\u2019t pay for three months. It might\u2019ve been bided off, and his dad\ndidn\u2019t have the heart to tell them. He made a note to ask later.</p><p>\u201cHey, Cy,\u201d TJ asked, his eyes sticking on the keys of the\ninstrument, \u201cwho here plays piano?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom does,\u201d Cyrus answered before shrugging, \u201cwell, she\nused to. A long time ago. Specifically, when before I turned seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened when you were seven?\u201d TJ asked. During Cyrus\u2019\nquick pause, TJ guessed it himself. </p><p>\u201cThe divorce,\u201d Cyrus said before TJ could stop him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d TJ found himself saying, looking over at his\nboyfriend with sad eyes.</p><p>Cyrus gave him a small smile, \u201cIt was for the best. I\u2019m glad\nyou didn\u2019t have to through that.\u201d TJ managed to smile back before looking back\nat the piano. He wondered if he still remembered how to play. He\u2019d probably\nsuck.</p><p>Cyrus gave him a small smile, \u201cIt was for the best. I\u2019m glad\nyou didn\u2019t have to through that.\u201d TJ managed to smile back before looking back\nat the piano. His fingers started tapping on his thighs, remembering what it\nwas like to press keys. \u201cDo you know how to play it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of,\u201d TJ shook his hand. \u201cMy GG and Nana always taught\nme and Amber because we liked it. Amber is the one that was always better than\nme. I probably could\u2019ve been better, but I never pursued it because of\nbasketball..\u201d</p><p>\u201cBall is life,\u201d Cyrus snickered, making TJ playfully roll\nhis eyes.</p><p>\u201cHey, if I\u2019m going to do something, I have to be the best at\nit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell if you know anything on the piano that you think\nyou\u2019re the best at, you can go play with it.\u201d</p><p>TJ\u2019s eyes lit up, making Cyrus grin at TJ\u2019s sudden\nexcitement, \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Cyrus said. \u201cWe have a guy come clean it every once\nin a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople clean pianos for living?\u201d TJ raised an eyebrow,\nalready standing up.</p><p>\u201cI thought the guy who knew random facts about everything\nwould know,\u201d Cyrus told him, following TJ to the piano.</p><p>\u201cPiano is short for pianoforte, which is Italian,\u201d TJ stuck\nhis tongue out at Cyrus before sitting down at the bench. \u201cSit,\u201d TJ said,\npatting the spot next to him. Cyrus smiled and sat next to his boyfriend as he\nstarted pressing keys, trying to remember what to do.</p><p>\u201cDo you know any songs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d TJ whispered, his hands positioning themselves, \u201cthis\nis the song that was stuck in my head when dad left.\u201d</p><p>TJ knew Cyrus would recognize Star Dust by Doris Day. It was\non C.C.C.M. after all. TJ messed up a couple of notes, but he seemed to\nremember most of it. Cyrus stared at TJ\u2019s hands in awe and whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re\nso talented.\u201d TJ missed another key as his heart did a small leap inside of his\nchest. \u00a0</p><p>TJ only played the song for less than a minute before stopping\nand saying, \u201cThat\u2019s all I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Leslie clapped, making TJ jump up a little on the\nbench, \u201cit\u2019s been a while since this room was filled with music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a great piano,\u201d TJ blushed, not knowing what to\nsay.</p><p>\u201cYou have great skills, kid,\u201d Norman told him, making TJ\nwant to shrink down and disappear. He felt like he had done horribly. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a fat minute sinc- I mean, a while since I\u2019ve\nplayed,\u201d TJ told him with a tight-lipped smile, \u201cbut thank you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGreat job,\u201d Cyrus whispered, lightly nudging TJ, making him\nstraighten up and smile genuinely.</p><p>Leslie approached the piano with her phone up and asked, \u201cCan\nI take a picture of you boys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Cyrus muttered, covering his face with his hands.</p><p>TJ smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s fine with me.\u201d Cyrus turned away from his\nmom to give TJ a death glare, only making TJ\u2019s grin widen. </p><p>\u201cCome on, Cyrus, smile. You never liked playing the piano,\u201d Leslie\ncommented, convincing Cyrus to turn back around and look at the camera.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t like my teacher,\u201d Cyrus corrected her. Leslie didn\u2019t\nsay anything else as she got different angles of them.</p><p>\u201cTJ,\u201d she said after snapping a few photos, \u201cyou have such a\nbeautiful smile, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d TJ told her, \u201cI got it from my great grandpa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, you\u2019re going to lift his ego up,\u201d Cyrus said, standing\nup from the bench. </p><p>\u201cHe deserves it,\u201d she said. \u201cHow long did you say it was since\nyou played?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d TJ bit his lip, \u201cabout two years ago. Might be less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a pianist, you never forget,\u201d she smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cYou should play something,\u201d TJ told her, standing up and\ngoing next to Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t,\u201d she shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s been even longer\nfor me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard you play,\u201d Norman commented, making\neveryone in the room turn to look at him. TJ felt Cyrus tense up next to him,\nand it was really hard to not reach out to grab his hand. \u201cIt\u2019d be nice to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it a shot, Leslie,\u201d TJ encouraged\nher. Calling her Leslie seemed to do it. She sat down and pressed a few keys\nbefore breaking out into a melody. </p><p><b><i>I love you for sentimental\nreasons</i></b></p><p><b><i>I hope you do believe me</i></b></p><p><b><i>I\u2019ll give you my heart</i></b></p><p>Cyrus was the one that reached\nfor TJ\u2019s hand, squeezing it. TJ looked at Cyrus, and he seemed happy, content\nwith the situation. He hadn\u2019t messed up.</p><p><b><i>I love you and you alone were\nmeant for me</i></b></p><p><b><i>Please, give your loving heart to\nme</i></b></p><p><b><i>And say we\u2019ll never part</i></b></p><p>After a minute or so, Leslie\nstopped and whispered, \u201cThere, that\u2019s it for me. For today, at least.\u201d TJ could\u2019ve\nsworn she was about to cry as they were clapping. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really great,\u201d TJ told\nher as Norman went to sit on the bench next to her. </p><p>\u201cYou really are absolutely\namazing,\u201d Norman said, giving her a kiss on top of the head. </p><p>\u201cThank you, boys,\u201d Leslie let\nout a cheery laugh, wiping below her eyes. \u201cThis was nice. Thank you, TJ.\u201d</p><p>TJ knew he was blushing as he\nlet out a barely audible, \u201cYeah, it was nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner will be ready in\nfifteen. You boys should go wash your hands,\u201d Leslie turned her head to look at\nthem, Cyrus quickly letting go of TJ\u2019s hand before she could see. </p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Cyrus said, \u201cI\u2019m going\nto show TJ my room, then.\u201d TJ couldn\u2019t help but smile before following Cyrus up\nthe stairs of his house. They seemed to have a couple of spare rooms. They\nwalked by a few before Cyrus led them into what was his room. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have\nas much personality as yours,\u201d Cyrus turned to TJ,\u201d but it has a bed.\u201d It was\ndecorated like the rest of the house but in blue, the occasional knick-knacks\nmaking it more Cyrus-like.</p><p>TJ teased him, \u201cI feel like a 30-year-old\nman lives here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Cyrus lightly nudged TJ\u2019s\narm, furrowing his brows.</p><p>\u201cJust kidding,\u201d TJ put his arm\naround him, placing a kiss on the side of his forehead. \u201cI love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, just like my parents hate\nyou,\u201d Cyrus smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou think they like me?\u201d TJ\nasked him, pulling his arm back and starting to walk around.</p><p>\u201cYou kidding me? I would <i>beg </i>my mom to play that song for me all\nthe time, and she never wanted to after the divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe played it for you, then,\u201d\nTJ told him, looking closer at his desk where a leather journal was shut close.\n</p><p>\u201cNo, she played it for you,\u201d\nCyrus shook his head, trailing behind TJ.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d TJ fought, \u201cit was for\nyou. She could\u2019ve played any song she knew for me, and she chose the song she\u2019s\nbeen wanting to play the most all these years. She chose the song you\u2019ve been\nwanting to hear.\u201d Cyrus stayed silent, even when TJ reached for his journal. \u201cCan\nI open this?\u201d TJ asked him, looking back at him. Cyrus\u2019 nose was red, and he\nwas biting his lip. TJ immediately dropped the journal back on the desk and\nwent to hug Cyrus, \u201cHey,\u201d he whispered, rubbing his hand on his back, \u201cwhat\u2019s\nwrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just really happy she\u2019s\nplaying again,\u201d Cyrus told him, hugging back TJ tightly. TJ smiled into the\nshorter boy\u2019s hair. \u201cThank you. You\u2019re honestly incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCy,\u201d TJ murmured, his face being\nclouded by a crimson blush. </p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d Cyrus pulled away,\ntaking in a deep breath and rubbing away the water in his eyes, TJ watching his\nface carefully every single second. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d TJ found\nhimself asking out of nowhere.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cyrus laughed\nnervously. </p><p>\u201cI want to kiss you,\u201d TJ caught\nhimself laughing along before Cyrus turned around to make sure the door was\nclosed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why not,\u201d Cyrus\nshrugged, looking back into TJ\u2019s eyes. TJ gave him a smile before leaning down\nto kiss him, his lips finding Cyrus\u2019 familiar ones. They parted for a moment where\nCyrus managed to tell him, \u201cI really like you,\u201d before initiating another kiss,\nhis arms around TJ\u2019s neck to pull him in closer.</p><p>\u201cI really like you, too,\u201d TJ lightly\npressed his nose against Cyrus\u2019 when they stopped. \u201cAre you still nervous about\ncoming out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d Cyrus admitted, quickly\npecking TJ on the lips, \u201cbut you being here makes it easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d TJ told him,\nfeeling his heart beat furiously in his chest, wanting to take in every single\nsecond with Cyrus like it were silk slipping through his fingers.</p><p>\u201cAre you nervous?\u201d Cyrus asked\nhim, running a finger on the side of TJ\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d TJ said. \u201cBut no\nmatter what happens, we\u2019re going to be fine. I know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Cyrus smiled at\nhim.</p><p>TJ gave him another quick kiss\nbefore asking, \u201cCan I go through your journal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my deep and most\npersonal thoughts intrigues you so much?\u201d Cyrus raised a brow at his boyfriend,\nletting go of him to go pick up the journal. </p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d TJ said excitedly\nwith a big grin. </p><p>Cyrus reached over with one\nhand to pinch one of his cheeks, \u201cYou really do have a pretty smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe the word used was\nbeautiful,\u201d TJ grinned, moving his cheek into Cyrus\u2019 hand until he was able to\nkiss his hand.</p><p>Cyrus playfully rolled his\neyes, \u201cYour inner jock is showing.\u201d TJ swiped the journal out of Cyrus\u2019 hand\nand ran to a corner of the room. \u201cTeej!\u201d Cyrus chased after TJ, \u201cYou know this\nis a battle I can\u2019t win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d TJ said, jumping on\nthe bed before rolling off and standing up again.</p><p>\u201cShow off,\u201d Cyrus gave up, throwing\nhimself on his stomach on the bed. TJ sat at the end of the bed and opened the\njournal, going through the pages. The first entry was from the 6<sup>th</sup>\ngrade. TJ skimmed a lot of the pages, only stopping to look at the ones that had\npictures taped to them. There were a lot with the Good Hair Crew, and the occasional\nfew with his family.</p><p>TJ pointed at a picture in the\nplace he recognized to be Andi\u2019s house. \u201cWhy does it say \u2018me, Buffy, Andi, and\nAndi\u2019s parents\u2019 on the bottom of this photo? I thought those were her grandparents?\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d Cyrus said, dragging\nhimself with his arms over to TJ. \u201cLong story short, Andi thought her whole life\nthat her grandparents were her parents until Bex told her that she was her mom,\nnot her sister, and then Bowie showed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wild,\u201d TJ said,\nlooking at the photo one more time, recognizing Andi\u2019s grandma as the one who\ninterrupted what could\u2019ve been their first kiss. He wouldn\u2019t change it, though.\n\u201cI like Andi\u2019s grandma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndi\u2019s grandpa looks a whole\nlot like John Cena.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus let out a snort, \u201cYour mind,\nI swear.\u201d TJ skipped through a lot of pages, starting to find a lot of pictures\nof Jonah Beck. He slowed down, seeing more Ultimate Frisbee things pile up. There\nwere other pictures strewn in occasionally, but he saw a lot of the same smile\nwith dimples. </p><p>\u201cYou guys got really close to\nJonah because of Ultimate?\u201d TJ asked him. </p><p>Cyrus slowly sat up, positioning\nhimself next to TJ, \u201cUhrm, yeah.\u201d TJ and Cyrus both stared down at a page where\nthere was a single polaroid selfie of him and Jonah, happy faces, stars, and\nhearts doodled all over the page. \u201cLook, TJ,\u201d Cyrus started to say.</p><p>\u201cBoys,\u201d Leslie called out from\noutside the room, \u201cdinner is served.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn our way,\u201d Cyrus said, already\nstanding up. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you later, okay? Let\u2019s go wash our hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d TJ told him, standing\nup and setting the journal closed on the end of the bed. He had a feeling he already\nknew.</p><p>-</p><p>As the end of dinner\napproached, Cyrus felt the pit in his stomach grow bigger. The clink of kitchenware\nseemed to echo louder in his head as every minute went by, the voices of his\nparents and TJ being less audible. </p><p>He was already nervous about\nhaving to do this two more times, and he wasn\u2019t even done with the first one.</p><p>TJ held his hand under the\ntable for a few seconds every once in a while, noticing that it was getting closer\nto the time. Cyrus regretted not rehearsing anything or writing down what to say.\nHe had originally decided against it because he didn\u2019t want to stress out about\nit so much. He was starting to regret a lot of his decisions at the moment,\nincluding some he made in the third grade.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 throat burned dry as he\nfound the courage to start the conversation. He waited until his mom started\nstacking dishes, and he finally said, \u201cHey,\u201d he licked his chapping lips, \u201cI\nneed to talk to you two.\u201d Leslie and Frank quickly looked at TJ and Cyrus said,\n\u201cYes, TJ has to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Cyrus?\u201d Leslie\nset the dishes she was holding back down, giving him her full attention. Norman\nwas doing the same, and Cyrus had never felt their gazes so heavy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know how to\nsay this,\u201d Cyrus rubbing the back of his neck with one hand, the other one\nreaching out to hold on tightly to TJ\u2019s own. Cyrus inhaled before telling them,\n\u201cI\u2019m gay.\u201d There was only a quick silence, Cyrus feeling light and heavy at the\nsame time. </p><p>\u201cCyrus,\u201d Leslie placed her\nhands over her heart, \u201cI love you so so much. Come here,\u201d she stood up at the\nsame time as Norman. Cyrus felt his heart soar, his feet seeming to take flight\nas he walked over to his parents to hug them.</p><p>It was okay. Him and TJ would\nbe okay. He was okay</p><p>When they let him go, he immediately\nturned to look at TJ who was smiling sheepishly at the scene before him. </p><p>\u201cAm I allowed to make an\nassumption?\u201d Norman asked Cyrus, now also smiling at TJ.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Cyrus smiled.</p><p>\u201cTJ is your boyfriend?\u201d Norman\nasked him merrily, making the two younger boys feel so much better about\neverything. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat would be correct,\u201d Cyrus told\nthem with a smile.</p><p>\u201cTJ, come here,\u201d Leslie motioned\nhim over with her arm. TJ hesitantly got up, and when he went over to the other\nside of the table, Leslie pulled him into a hug. \u201cDon\u2019t think I haven\u2019t noticed\nhow much happier Cyrus has been lately. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus exhaled. </p><p>-</p><p>Cyrus somehow snuck TJ back up\ninto his room without his parents noticing. They probably wouldn\u2019t be allowed\nto be alone in his bedroom anytime soon, so he decided to take him back up\nbefore they took TJ home. </p><p>As soon as Cyrus shut the\ndoor, TJ pulled him in for a hug, knocking the wind out of him. \u201cTJ,\u201d Cyrus\nlaughed, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d TJ put him down, a huge\nsmile on his face, \u201cI\u2019m just so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for being with me,\u201d\nCyrus smiled up him.</p><p>\u201cI always want to be there for\nyou, okay?\u201d TJ said, bending down to give him a quick kiss. \u201cCan I finish going\nthrough the journal now?\u201d Cyrus bit, his lip. He knew he had to tell him about\nthe crush he had on Jonah. It was only fair.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Cyrus nodded, going over\nto the end of his bed with TJ. TJ went to the last page where they were, the\nstupid polaroid picture of him and Jonah standing out.</p><p>\u201cDid you,\u201d TJ paused for a\nsecond, making Cyrus\u2019 heart fall, \u201clike him?\u201d </p><hr><p>I\u2019m back to sporadic updates!!

TJ just wished Cyrus could realize that all of those songs remind him of a certain boy who likes chocolate chocolate chip muffins without telling him directly.</p><p>With insecurities and fears almost set in stone, it\u2019s hard for TJ to admit that he has a heart aching crush on Cyrus who is trying to avoid just that. Of course, it doesn\u2019t seem like both of them are trying to get over each other when they\u2019re always together.<br></p><p><a href=\"https://lgbtyrus.tumblr.com/post/177417182754/tjs-playlist-chapter-1\">Chapter 1</a> | <a href=\"https://lgbtyrus.tumblr.com/post/180884290199/tjs-playlist-chapter-15\">Previous Chapter</a> | Also up on Ao3 + Wattpad</p><p>Words: 2,983</p>[[MORE]]<p>Cyrus wasn\u2019t lying about his mom. She was showering them in\nsnacks, forcing TJ to call her Leslie, poking conversation with him here and\nthere about his parents. She really liked gossip, but Cyrus tended to shoo her\noff before TJ could say anything too personal.</p><p>The boys were set up at the couch, watching random movies on\nNetflix until dinner arrived. Cyrus was on one end of the couch and TJ was at\nthe other end, both dying to lean over to cuddle with the other. All they could\ndo was blow kisses at each other when they were both alone in the living room. </p><p>TJ quickly noticed the difference between him and Cyrus\u2019\nhome. Cyrus\u2019 home was full of color, a lot more modern than his goth parent\u2019s\ndecoration. He liked it. He was very appreciative of the baby photos of Cyrus\nstrewn all over the place. Most of them were horribly photoshopped, but he\nstill found them adorable.</p><p>He kept eyeing the piano in the corner of the room. His GG\nhad one just like it, only in white. He had left it for Amber, but it didn\u2019t\nfit inside their home, so it got sent to a storage locker he was almost sure\nthey didn\u2019t pay for three months. It might\u2019ve been bided off, and his dad\ndidn\u2019t have the heart to tell them. He made a note to ask later.</p><p>\u201cHey, Cy,\u201d TJ asked, his eyes sticking on the keys of the\ninstrument, \u201cwho here plays piano?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom does,\u201d Cyrus answered before shrugging, \u201cwell, she\nused to. A long time ago. Specifically, when before I turned seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened when you were seven?\u201d TJ asked. During Cyrus\u2019\nquick pause, TJ guessed it himself. </p><p>\u201cThe divorce,\u201d Cyrus said before TJ could stop him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d TJ found himself saying, looking over at his\nboyfriend with sad eyes.</p><p>Cyrus gave him a small smile, \u201cIt was for the best. I\u2019m glad\nyou didn\u2019t have to through that.\u201d TJ managed to smile back before looking back\nat the piano. He wondered if he still remembered how to play. He\u2019d probably\nsuck.</p><p>Cyrus gave him a small smile, \u201cIt was for the best. I\u2019m glad\nyou didn\u2019t have to through that.\u201d TJ managed to smile back before looking back\nat the piano. His fingers started tapping on his thighs, remembering what it\nwas like to press keys. \u201cDo you know how to play it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of,\u201d TJ shook his hand. \u201cMy GG and Nana always taught\nme and Amber because we liked it. Amber is the one that was always better than\nme. I probably could\u2019ve been better, but I never pursued it because of\nbasketball..\u201d</p><p>\u201cBall is life,\u201d Cyrus snickered, making TJ playfully roll\nhis eyes.</p><p>\u201cHey, if I\u2019m going to do something, I have to be the best at\nit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell if you know anything on the piano that you think\nyou\u2019re the best at, you can go play with it.\u201d</p><p>TJ\u2019s eyes lit up, making Cyrus grin at TJ\u2019s sudden\nexcitement, \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Cyrus said. \u201cWe have a guy come clean it every once\nin a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople clean pianos for living?\u201d TJ raised an eyebrow,\nalready standing up.</p><p>\u201cI thought the guy who knew random facts about everything\nwould know,\u201d Cyrus told him, following TJ to the piano.</p><p>\u201cPiano is short for pianoforte, which is Italian,\u201d TJ stuck\nhis tongue out at Cyrus before sitting down at the bench. \u201cSit,\u201d TJ said,\npatting the spot next to him. Cyrus smiled and sat next to his boyfriend as he\nstarted pressing keys, trying to remember what to do.</p><p>\u201cDo you know any songs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d TJ whispered, his hands positioning themselves, \u201cthis\nis the song that was stuck in my head when dad left.\u201d</p><p>TJ knew Cyrus would recognize Star Dust by Doris Day. It was\non C.C.C.M. after all. TJ messed up a couple of notes, but he seemed to\nremember most of it. Cyrus stared at TJ\u2019s hands in awe and whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re\nso talented.\u201d TJ missed another key as his heart did a small leap inside of his\nchest. \u00a0</p><p>TJ only played the song for less than a minute before stopping\nand saying, \u201cThat\u2019s all I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Leslie clapped, making TJ jump up a little on the\nbench, \u201cit\u2019s been a while since this room was filled with music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a great piano,\u201d TJ blushed, not knowing what to\nsay.</p><p>\u201cYou have great skills, kid,\u201d Norman told him, making TJ\nwant to shrink down and disappear. He felt like he had done horribly. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a fat minute sinc- I mean, a while since I\u2019ve\nplayed,\u201d TJ told him with a tight-lipped smile, \u201cbut thank you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGreat job,\u201d Cyrus whispered, lightly nudging TJ, making him\nstraighten up and smile genuinely.</p><p>Leslie approached the piano with her phone up and asked, \u201cCan\nI take a picture of you boys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Cyrus muttered, covering his face with his hands.</p><p>TJ smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s fine with me.\u201d Cyrus turned away from his\nmom to give TJ a death glare, only making TJ\u2019s grin widen. </p><p>\u201cCome on, Cyrus, smile. You never liked playing the piano,\u201d Leslie\ncommented, convincing Cyrus to turn back around and look at the camera.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t like my teacher,\u201d Cyrus corrected her. Leslie didn\u2019t\nsay anything else as she got different angles of them.</p><p>\u201cTJ,\u201d she said after snapping a few photos, \u201cyou have such a\nbeautiful smile, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d TJ told her, \u201cI got it from my great grandpa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, you\u2019re going to lift his ego up,\u201d Cyrus said, standing\nup from the bench. </p><p>\u201cHe deserves it,\u201d she said. \u201cHow long did you say it was since\nyou played?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d TJ bit his lip, \u201cabout two years ago. Might be less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a pianist, you never forget,\u201d she smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cYou should play something,\u201d TJ told her, standing up and\ngoing next to Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t,\u201d she shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s been even longer\nfor me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard you play,\u201d Norman commented, making\neveryone in the room turn to look at him. TJ felt Cyrus tense up next to him,\nand it was really hard to not reach out to grab his hand. \u201cIt\u2019d be nice to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it a shot, Leslie,\u201d TJ encouraged\nher. Calling her Leslie seemed to do it. She sat down and pressed a few keys\nbefore breaking out into a melody. </p><p><b><i>I love you for sentimental\nreasons</i></b></p><p><b><i>I hope you do believe me</i></b></p><p><b><i>I\u2019ll give you my heart</i></b></p><p>Cyrus was the one that reached\nfor TJ\u2019s hand, squeezing it. TJ looked at Cyrus, and he seemed happy, content\nwith the situation. He hadn\u2019t messed up.</p><p><b><i>I love you and you alone were\nmeant for me</i></b></p><p><b><i>Please, give your loving heart to\nme</i></b></p><p><b><i>And say we\u2019ll never part</i></b></p><p>After a minute or so, Leslie\nstopped and whispered, \u201cThere, that\u2019s it for me. For today, at least.\u201d TJ could\u2019ve\nsworn she was about to cry as they were clapping. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really great,\u201d TJ told\nher as Norman went to sit on the bench next to her. </p><p>\u201cYou really are absolutely\namazing,\u201d Norman said, giving her a kiss on top of the head. </p><p>\u201cThank you, boys,\u201d Leslie let\nout a cheery laugh, wiping below her eyes. \u201cThis was nice. Thank you, TJ.\u201d</p><p>TJ knew he was blushing as he\nlet out a barely audible, \u201cYeah, it was nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner will be ready in\nfifteen. You boys should go wash your hands,\u201d Leslie turned her head to look at\nthem, Cyrus quickly letting go of TJ\u2019s hand before she could see. </p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Cyrus said, \u201cI\u2019m going\nto show TJ my room, then.\u201d TJ couldn\u2019t help but smile before following Cyrus up\nthe stairs of his house. They seemed to have a couple of spare rooms. They\nwalked by a few before Cyrus led them into what was his room. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have\nas much personality as yours,\u201d Cyrus turned to TJ,\u201d but it has a bed.\u201d It was\ndecorated like the rest of the house but in blue, the occasional knick-knacks\nmaking it more Cyrus-like.</p><p>TJ teased him, \u201cI feel like a 30-year-old\nman lives here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Cyrus lightly nudged TJ\u2019s\narm, furrowing his brows.</p><p>\u201cJust kidding,\u201d TJ put his arm\naround him, placing a kiss on the side of his forehead. \u201cI love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, just like my parents hate\nyou,\u201d Cyrus smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou think they like me?\u201d TJ\nasked him, pulling his arm back and starting to walk around.</p><p>\u201cYou kidding me? I would <i>beg </i>my mom to play that song for me all\nthe time, and she never wanted to after the divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe played it for you, then,\u201d\nTJ told him, looking closer at his desk where a leather journal was shut close.\n</p><p>\u201cNo, she played it for you,\u201d\nCyrus shook his head, trailing behind TJ.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d TJ fought, \u201cit was for\nyou. She could\u2019ve played any song she knew for me, and she chose the song she\u2019s\nbeen wanting to play the most all these years. She chose the song you\u2019ve been\nwanting to hear.\u201d Cyrus stayed silent, even when TJ reached for his journal. \u201cCan\nI open this?\u201d TJ asked him, looking back at him. Cyrus\u2019 nose was red, and he\nwas biting his lip. TJ immediately dropped the journal back on the desk and\nwent to hug Cyrus, \u201cHey,\u201d he whispered, rubbing his hand on his back, \u201cwhat\u2019s\nwrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just really happy she\u2019s\nplaying again,\u201d Cyrus told him, hugging back TJ tightly. TJ smiled into the\nshorter boy\u2019s hair. \u201cThank you. You\u2019re honestly incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCy,\u201d TJ murmured, his face being\nclouded by a crimson blush. </p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d Cyrus pulled away,\ntaking in a deep breath and rubbing away the water in his eyes, TJ watching his\nface carefully every single second. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d TJ found\nhimself asking out of nowhere.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cyrus laughed\nnervously. </p><p>\u201cI want to kiss you,\u201d TJ caught\nhimself laughing along before Cyrus turned around to make sure the door was\nclosed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why not,\u201d Cyrus\nshrugged, looking back into TJ\u2019s eyes. TJ gave him a smile before leaning down\nto kiss him, his lips finding Cyrus\u2019 familiar ones. They parted for a moment where\nCyrus managed to tell him, \u201cI really like you,\u201d before initiating another kiss,\nhis arms around TJ\u2019s neck to pull him in closer.</p><p>\u201cI really like you, too,\u201d TJ lightly\npressed his nose against Cyrus\u2019 when they stopped. \u201cAre you still nervous about\ncoming out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d Cyrus admitted, quickly\npecking TJ on the lips, \u201cbut you being here makes it easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d TJ told him,\nfeeling his heart beat furiously in his chest, wanting to take in every single\nsecond with Cyrus like it were silk slipping through his fingers.</p><p>\u201cAre you nervous?\u201d Cyrus asked\nhim, running a finger on the side of TJ\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d TJ said. \u201cBut no\nmatter what happens, we\u2019re going to be fine. I know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Cyrus smiled at\nhim.</p><p>TJ gave him another quick kiss\nbefore asking, \u201cCan I go through your journal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my deep and most\npersonal thoughts intrigues you so much?\u201d Cyrus raised a brow at his boyfriend,\nletting go of him to go pick up the journal. </p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d TJ said excitedly\nwith a big grin. </p><p>Cyrus reached over with one\nhand to pinch one of his cheeks, \u201cYou really do have a pretty smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe the word used was\nbeautiful,\u201d TJ grinned, moving his cheek into Cyrus\u2019 hand until he was able to\nkiss his hand.</p><p>Cyrus playfully rolled his\neyes, \u201cYour inner jock is showing.\u201d TJ swiped the journal out of Cyrus\u2019 hand\nand ran to a corner of the room. \u201cTeej!\u201d Cyrus chased after TJ, \u201cYou know this\nis a battle I can\u2019t win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d TJ said, jumping on\nthe bed before rolling off and standing up again.</p><p>\u201cShow off,\u201d Cyrus gave up, throwing\nhimself on his stomach on the bed. TJ sat at the end of the bed and opened the\njournal, going through the pages. The first entry was from the 6<sup>th</sup>\ngrade. TJ skimmed a lot of the pages, only stopping to look at the ones that had\npictures taped to them. There were a lot with the Good Hair Crew, and the occasional\nfew with his family.</p><p>TJ pointed at a picture in the\nplace he recognized to be Andi\u2019s house. \u201cWhy does it say \u2018me, Buffy, Andi, and\nAndi\u2019s parents\u2019 on the bottom of this photo? I thought those were her grandparents?\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d Cyrus said, dragging\nhimself with his arms over to TJ. \u201cLong story short, Andi thought her whole life\nthat her grandparents were her parents until Bex told her that she was her mom,\nnot her sister, and then Bowie showed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wild,\u201d TJ said,\nlooking at the photo one more time, recognizing Andi\u2019s grandma as the one who\ninterrupted what could\u2019ve been their first kiss. He wouldn\u2019t change it, though.\n\u201cI like Andi\u2019s grandma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndi\u2019s grandpa looks a whole\nlot like John Cena.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus let out a snort, \u201cYour mind,\nI swear.\u201d TJ skipped through a lot of pages, starting to find a lot of pictures\nof Jonah Beck. He slowed down, seeing more Ultimate Frisbee things pile up. There\nwere other pictures strewn in occasionally, but he saw a lot of the same smile\nwith dimples. </p><p>\u201cYou guys got really close to\nJonah because of Ultimate?\u201d TJ asked him. </p><p>Cyrus slowly sat up, positioning\nhimself next to TJ, \u201cUhrm, yeah.\u201d TJ and Cyrus both stared down at a page where\nthere was a single polaroid selfie of him and Jonah, happy faces, stars, and\nhearts doodled all over the page. \u201cLook, TJ,\u201d Cyrus started to say.</p><p>\u201cBoys,\u201d Leslie called out from\noutside the room, \u201cdinner is served.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn our way,\u201d Cyrus said, already\nstanding up. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you later, okay? Let\u2019s go wash our hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d TJ told him, standing\nup and setting the journal closed on the end of the bed. He had a feeling he already\nknew.</p><p>-</p><p>As the end of dinner\napproached, Cyrus felt the pit in his stomach grow bigger. The clink of kitchenware\nseemed to echo louder in his head as every minute went by, the voices of his\nparents and TJ being less audible. </p><p>He was already nervous about\nhaving to do this two more times, and he wasn\u2019t even done with the first one.</p><p>TJ held his hand under the\ntable for a few seconds every once in a while, noticing that it was getting closer\nto the time. Cyrus regretted not rehearsing anything or writing down what to say.\nHe had originally decided against it because he didn\u2019t want to stress out about\nit so much. He was starting to regret a lot of his decisions at the moment,\nincluding some he made in the third grade.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 throat burned dry as he\nfound the courage to start the conversation. He waited until his mom started\nstacking dishes, and he finally said, \u201cHey,\u201d he licked his chapping lips, \u201cI\nneed to talk to you two.\u201d Leslie and Frank quickly looked at TJ and Cyrus said,\n\u201cYes, TJ has to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Cyrus?\u201d Leslie\nset the dishes she was holding back down, giving him her full attention. Norman\nwas doing the same, and Cyrus had never felt their gazes so heavy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know how to\nsay this,\u201d Cyrus rubbing the back of his neck with one hand, the other one\nreaching out to hold on tightly to TJ\u2019s own. Cyrus inhaled before telling them,\n\u201cI\u2019m gay.\u201d There was only a quick silence, Cyrus feeling light and heavy at the\nsame time. </p><p>\u201cCyrus,\u201d Leslie placed her\nhands over her heart, \u201cI love you so so much. Come here,\u201d she stood up at the\nsame time as Norman. Cyrus felt his heart soar, his feet seeming to take flight\nas he walked over to his parents to hug them.</p><p>It was okay. Him and TJ would\nbe okay. He was okay</p><p>When they let him go, he immediately\nturned to look at TJ who was smiling sheepishly at the scene before him. </p><p>\u201cAm I allowed to make an\nassumption?\u201d Norman asked Cyrus, now also smiling at TJ.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Cyrus smiled.</p><p>\u201cTJ is your boyfriend?\u201d Norman\nasked him merrily, making the two younger boys feel so much better about\neverything. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat would be correct,\u201d Cyrus told\nthem with a smile.</p><p>\u201cTJ, come here,\u201d Leslie motioned\nhim over with her arm. TJ hesitantly got up, and when he went over to the other\nside of the table, Leslie pulled him into a hug. \u201cDon\u2019t think I haven\u2019t noticed\nhow much happier Cyrus has been lately. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus exhaled. </p><p>-</p><p>Cyrus somehow snuck TJ back up\ninto his room without his parents noticing. They probably wouldn\u2019t be allowed\nto be alone in his bedroom anytime soon, so he decided to take him back up\nbefore they took TJ home. </p><p>As soon as Cyrus shut the\ndoor, TJ pulled him in for a hug, knocking the wind out of him. \u201cTJ,\u201d Cyrus\nlaughed, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d TJ put him down, a huge\nsmile on his face, \u201cI\u2019m just so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for being with me,\u201d\nCyrus smiled up him.</p><p>\u201cI always want to be there for\nyou, okay?\u201d TJ said, bending down to give him a quick kiss. \u201cCan I finish going\nthrough the journal now?\u201d Cyrus bit, his lip. He knew he had to tell him about\nthe crush he had on Jonah. It was only fair.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Cyrus nodded, going over\nto the end of his bed with TJ. TJ went to the last page where they were, the\nstupid polaroid picture of him and Jonah standing out.</p><p>\u201cDid you,\u201d TJ paused for a\nsecond, making Cyrus\u2019 heart fall, \u201clike him?\u201d </p><hr><p>I\u2019m back to sporadic updates!!

                "content": "<p>Story Summary: When Cyrus finds a playlist on TJ&rsquo;s desktop full of old love songs, he realizes that TJ has never been a scary basketball guy but rather a huge sap. TJ just wished Cyrus could realize that all of those songs remind him of a certain boy who likes chocolate chocolate chip muffins without telling him directly.</p><p>With insecurities and fears almost set in stone, it&rsquo;s hard for TJ to admit that he has a heart aching crush on Cyrus who is trying to avoid just that. Of course, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like both of them are trying to get over each other when they&rsquo;re always together.<br /></p><p><a href=\"https://lgbtyrus.tumblr.com/post/177417182754/tjs-playlist-chapter-1\">Chapter 1</a> | <a href=\"https://lgbtyrus.tumblr.com/post/180884290199/tjs-playlist-chapter-15\">Previous Chapter</a> | Also up on Ao3 + Wattpad</p><p>Words: 2,983</p><p>Cyrus wasn&rsquo;t lying about his mom. She was showering them in\nsnacks, forcing TJ to call her Leslie, poking conversation with him here and\nthere about his parents. She really liked gossip, but Cyrus tended to shoo her\noff before TJ could say anything too personal.</p><p>The boys were set up at the couch, watching random movies on\nNetflix until dinner arrived. Cyrus was on one end of the couch and TJ was at\nthe other end, both dying to lean over to cuddle with the other. All they could\ndo was blow kisses at each other when they were both alone in the living room. </p><p>TJ quickly noticed the difference between him and Cyrus&rsquo;\nhome. Cyrus&rsquo; home was full of color, a lot more modern than his goth parent&rsquo;s\ndecoration. He liked it. He was very appreciative of the baby photos of Cyrus\nstrewn all over the place. Most of them were horribly photoshopped, but he\nstill found them adorable.</p><p>He kept eyeing the piano in the corner of the room. His GG\nhad one just like it, only in white. He had left it for Amber, but it didn&rsquo;t\nfit inside their home, so it got sent to a storage locker he was almost sure\nthey didn&rsquo;t pay for three months. It might&rsquo;ve been bided off, and his dad\ndidn&rsquo;t have the heart to tell them. He made a note to ask later.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Cy,&rdquo; TJ asked, his eyes sticking on the keys of the\ninstrument, &ldquo;who here plays piano?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My mom does,&rdquo; Cyrus answered before shrugging, &ldquo;well, she\nused to. A long time ago. Specifically, when before I turned seven.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What happened when you were seven?&rdquo; TJ asked. During Cyrus&rsquo;\nquick pause, TJ guessed it himself. </p><p>&ldquo;The divorce,&rdquo; Cyrus said before TJ could stop him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; TJ found himself saying, looking over at his\nboyfriend with sad eyes.</p><p>Cyrus gave him a small smile, &ldquo;It was for the best. I&rsquo;m glad\nyou didn&rsquo;t have to through that.&rdquo; TJ managed to smile back before looking back\nat the piano. He wondered if he still remembered how to play. He&rsquo;d probably\nsuck.</p><p>Cyrus gave him a small smile, &ldquo;It was for the best. I&rsquo;m glad\nyou didn&rsquo;t have to through that.&rdquo; TJ managed to smile back before looking back\nat the piano. His fingers started tapping on his thighs, remembering what it\nwas like to press keys. &ldquo;Do you know how to play it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kind of,&rdquo; TJ shook his hand. &ldquo;My GG and Nana always taught\nme and Amber because we liked it. Amber is the one that was always better than\nme. I probably could&rsquo;ve been better, but I never pursued it because of\nbasketball..&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ball is life,&rdquo; Cyrus snickered, making TJ playfully roll\nhis eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, if I&rsquo;m going to do something, I have to be the best at\nit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well if you know anything on the piano that you think\nyou&rsquo;re the best at, you can go play with it.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ&rsquo;s eyes lit up, making Cyrus grin at TJ&rsquo;s sudden\nexcitement, &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Cyrus said. &ldquo;We have a guy come clean it every once\nin a while.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;People clean pianos for living?&rdquo; TJ raised an eyebrow,\nalready standing up.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought the guy who knew random facts about everything\nwould know,&rdquo; Cyrus told him, following TJ to the piano.</p><p>&ldquo;Piano is short for pianoforte, which is Italian,&rdquo; TJ stuck\nhis tongue out at Cyrus before sitting down at the bench. &ldquo;Sit,&rdquo; TJ said,\npatting the spot next to him. Cyrus smiled and sat next to his boyfriend as he\nstarted pressing keys, trying to remember what to do.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know any songs?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; TJ whispered, his hands positioning themselves, &ldquo;this\nis the song that was stuck in my head when dad left.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ knew Cyrus would recognize Star Dust by Doris Day. It was\non C.C.C.M. after all. TJ messed up a couple of notes, but he seemed to\nremember most of it. Cyrus stared at TJ&rsquo;s hands in awe and whispered, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re\nso talented.&rdquo; TJ missed another key as his heart did a small leap inside of his\nchest. &nbsp;</p><p>TJ only played the song for less than a minute before stopping\nand saying, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I remember.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; Leslie clapped, making TJ jump up a little on the\nbench, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s been a while since this room was filled with music.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have a great piano,&rdquo; TJ blushed, not knowing what to\nsay.</p><p>&ldquo;You have great skills, kid,&rdquo; Norman told him, making TJ\nwant to shrink down and disappear. He felt like he had done horribly. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a fat minute sinc- I mean, a while since I&rsquo;ve\nplayed,&rdquo; TJ told him with a tight-lipped smile, &ldquo;but thank you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Great job,&rdquo; Cyrus whispered, lightly nudging TJ, making him\nstraighten up and smile genuinely.</p><p>Leslie approached the piano with her phone up and asked, &ldquo;Can\nI take a picture of you boys?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mom,&rdquo; Cyrus muttered, covering his face with his hands.</p><p>TJ smiled, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine with me.&rdquo; Cyrus turned away from his\nmom to give TJ a death glare, only making TJ&rsquo;s grin widen. </p><p>&ldquo;Come on, Cyrus, smile. You never liked playing the piano,&rdquo; Leslie\ncommented, convincing Cyrus to turn back around and look at the camera.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like my teacher,&rdquo; Cyrus corrected her. Leslie didn&rsquo;t\nsay anything else as she got different angles of them.</p><p>&ldquo;TJ,&rdquo; she said after snapping a few photos, &ldquo;you have such a\nbeautiful smile, honey.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; TJ told her, &ldquo;I got it from my great grandpa.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mom, you&rsquo;re going to lift his ego up,&rdquo; Cyrus said, standing\nup from the bench. </p><p>&ldquo;He deserves it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How long did you say it was since\nyou played?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; TJ bit his lip, &ldquo;about two years ago. Might be less.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As a pianist, you never forget,&rdquo; she smiled at him.</p><p>&ldquo;You should play something,&rdquo; TJ told her, standing up and\ngoing next to Cyrus.</p><p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she shook her head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been even longer\nfor me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard you play,&rdquo; Norman commented, making\neveryone in the room turn to look at him. TJ felt Cyrus tense up next to him,\nand it was really hard to not reach out to grab his hand. &ldquo;It&rsquo;d be nice to hear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Give it a shot, Leslie,&rdquo; TJ encouraged\nher. Calling her Leslie seemed to do it. She sat down and pressed a few keys\nbefore breaking out into a melody. </p><p><b><i>I love you for sentimental\nreasons</i></b></p><p><b><i>I hope you do believe me</i></b></p><p><b><i>I&rsquo;ll give you my heart</i></b></p><p>Cyrus was the one that reached\nfor TJ&rsquo;s hand, squeezing it. TJ looked at Cyrus, and he seemed happy, content\nwith the situation. He hadn&rsquo;t messed up.</p><p><b><i>I love you and you alone were\nmeant for me</i></b></p><p><b><i>Please, give your loving heart to\nme</i></b></p><p><b><i>And say we&rsquo;ll never part</i></b></p><p>After a minute or so, Leslie\nstopped and whispered, &ldquo;There, that&rsquo;s it for me. For today, at least.&rdquo; TJ could&rsquo;ve\nsworn she was about to cry as they were clapping. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re really great,&rdquo; TJ told\nher as Norman went to sit on the bench next to her. </p><p>&ldquo;You really are absolutely\namazing,&rdquo; Norman said, giving her a kiss on top of the head. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, boys,&rdquo; Leslie let\nout a cheery laugh, wiping below her eyes. &ldquo;This was nice. Thank you, TJ.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ knew he was blushing as he\nlet out a barely audible, &ldquo;Yeah, it was nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dinner will be ready in\nfifteen. You boys should go wash your hands,&rdquo; Leslie turned her head to look at\nthem, Cyrus quickly letting go of TJ&rsquo;s hand before she could see. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Cyrus said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going\nto show TJ my room, then.&rdquo; TJ couldn&rsquo;t help but smile before following Cyrus up\nthe stairs of his house. They seemed to have a couple of spare rooms. They\nwalked by a few before Cyrus led them into what was his room. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t have\nas much personality as yours,&rdquo; Cyrus turned to TJ,&rdquo; but it has a bed.&rdquo; It was\ndecorated like the rest of the house but in blue, the occasional knick-knacks\nmaking it more Cyrus-like.</p><p>TJ teased him, &ldquo;I feel like a 30-year-old\nman lives here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Cyrus lightly nudged TJ&rsquo;s\narm, furrowing his brows.</p><p>&ldquo;Just kidding,&rdquo; TJ put his arm\naround him, placing a kiss on the side of his forehead. &ldquo;I love it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, just like my parents hate\nyou,&rdquo; Cyrus smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;You think they like me?&rdquo; TJ\nasked him, pulling his arm back and starting to walk around.</p><p>&ldquo;You kidding me? I would <i>beg </i>my mom to play that song for me all\nthe time, and she never wanted to after the divorce.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She played it for you, then,&rdquo;\nTJ told him, looking closer at his desk where a leather journal was shut close.\n</p><p>&ldquo;No, she played it for you,&rdquo;\nCyrus shook his head, trailing behind TJ.</p><p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; TJ fought, &ldquo;it was for\nyou. She could&rsquo;ve played any song she knew for me, and she chose the song she&rsquo;s\nbeen wanting to play the most all these years. She chose the song you&rsquo;ve been\nwanting to hear.&rdquo; Cyrus stayed silent, even when TJ reached for his journal. &ldquo;Can\nI open this?&rdquo; TJ asked him, looking back at him. Cyrus&rsquo; nose was red, and he\nwas biting his lip. TJ immediately dropped the journal back on the desk and\nwent to hug Cyrus, &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he whispered, rubbing his hand on his back, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s\nwrong?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just really happy she&rsquo;s\nplaying again,&rdquo; Cyrus told him, hugging back TJ tightly. TJ smiled into the\nshorter boy&rsquo;s hair. &ldquo;Thank you. You&rsquo;re honestly incredible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cy,&rdquo; TJ murmured, his face being\nclouded by a crimson blush. </p><p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; Cyrus pulled away,\ntaking in a deep breath and rubbing away the water in his eyes, TJ watching his\nface carefully every single second. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can I kiss you?&rdquo; TJ found\nhimself asking out of nowhere.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Cyrus laughed\nnervously. </p><p>&ldquo;I want to kiss you,&rdquo; TJ caught\nhimself laughing along before Cyrus turned around to make sure the door was\nclosed.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why not,&rdquo; Cyrus\nshrugged, looking back into TJ&rsquo;s eyes. TJ gave him a smile before leaning down\nto kiss him, his lips finding Cyrus&rsquo; familiar ones. They parted for a moment where\nCyrus managed to tell him, &ldquo;I really like you,&rdquo; before initiating another kiss,\nhis arms around TJ&rsquo;s neck to pull him in closer.</p><p>&ldquo;I really like you, too,&rdquo; TJ lightly\npressed his nose against Cyrus&rsquo; when they stopped. &ldquo;Are you still nervous about\ncoming out?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; Cyrus admitted, quickly\npecking TJ on the lips, &ldquo;but you being here makes it easier.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; TJ told him,\nfeeling his heart beat furiously in his chest, wanting to take in every single\nsecond with Cyrus like it were silk slipping through his fingers.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you nervous?&rdquo; Cyrus asked\nhim, running a finger on the side of TJ&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; TJ said. &ldquo;But no\nmatter what happens, we&rsquo;re going to be fine. I know it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Me, too,&rdquo; Cyrus smiled at\nhim.</p><p>TJ gave him another quick kiss\nbefore asking, &ldquo;Can I go through your journal?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What about my deep and most\npersonal thoughts intrigues you so much?&rdquo; Cyrus raised a brow at his boyfriend,\nletting go of him to go pick up the journal. </p><p>&ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; TJ said excitedly\nwith a big grin. </p><p>Cyrus reached over with one\nhand to pinch one of his cheeks, &ldquo;You really do have a pretty smile.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I believe the word used was\nbeautiful,&rdquo; TJ grinned, moving his cheek into Cyrus&rsquo; hand until he was able to\nkiss his hand.</p><p>Cyrus playfully rolled his\neyes, &ldquo;Your inner jock is showing.&rdquo; TJ swiped the journal out of Cyrus&rsquo; hand\nand ran to a corner of the room. &ldquo;Teej!&rdquo; Cyrus chased after TJ, &ldquo;You know this\nis a battle I can&rsquo;t win.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; TJ said, jumping on\nthe bed before rolling off and standing up again.</p><p>&ldquo;Show off,&rdquo; Cyrus gave up, throwing\nhimself on his stomach on the bed. TJ sat at the end of the bed and opened the\njournal, going through the pages. The first entry was from the 6<sup>th</sup>\ngrade. TJ skimmed a lot of the pages, only stopping to look at the ones that had\npictures taped to them. There were a lot with the Good Hair Crew, and the occasional\nfew with his family.</p><p>TJ pointed at a picture in the\nplace he recognized to be Andi&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;Why does it say &lsquo;me, Buffy, Andi, and\nAndi&rsquo;s parents&rsquo; on the bottom of this photo? I thought those were her grandparents?&rdquo;\n</p><p>&ldquo;Oh shit,&rdquo; Cyrus said, dragging\nhimself with his arms over to TJ. &ldquo;Long story short, Andi thought her whole life\nthat her grandparents were her parents until Bex told her that she was her mom,\nnot her sister, and then Bowie showed up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s wild,&rdquo; TJ said,\nlooking at the photo one more time, recognizing Andi&rsquo;s grandma as the one who\ninterrupted what could&rsquo;ve been their first kiss. He wouldn&rsquo;t change it, though.\n&ldquo;I like Andi&rsquo;s grandma.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Me, too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Andi&rsquo;s grandpa looks a whole\nlot like John Cena.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus let out a snort, &ldquo;Your mind,\nI swear.&rdquo; TJ skipped through a lot of pages, starting to find a lot of pictures\nof Jonah Beck. He slowed down, seeing more Ultimate Frisbee things pile up. There\nwere other pictures strewn in occasionally, but he saw a lot of the same smile\nwith dimples. </p><p>&ldquo;You guys got really close to\nJonah because of Ultimate?&rdquo; TJ asked him. </p><p>Cyrus slowly sat up, positioning\nhimself next to TJ, &ldquo;Uhrm, yeah.&rdquo; TJ and Cyrus both stared down at a page where\nthere was a single polaroid selfie of him and Jonah, happy faces, stars, and\nhearts doodled all over the page. &ldquo;Look, TJ,&rdquo; Cyrus started to say.</p><p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; Leslie called out from\noutside the room, &ldquo;dinner is served.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On our way,&rdquo; Cyrus said, already\nstanding up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you later, okay? Let&rsquo;s go wash our hands.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; TJ told him, standing\nup and setting the journal closed on the end of the bed. He had a feeling he already\nknew.</p><p>-</p><p>As the end of dinner\napproached, Cyrus felt the pit in his stomach grow bigger. The clink of kitchenware\nseemed to echo louder in his head as every minute went by, the voices of his\nparents and TJ being less audible. </p><p>He was already nervous about\nhaving to do this two more times, and he wasn&rsquo;t even done with the first one.</p><p>TJ held his hand under the\ntable for a few seconds every once in a while, noticing that it was getting closer\nto the time. Cyrus regretted not rehearsing anything or writing down what to say.\nHe had originally decided against it because he didn&rsquo;t want to stress out about\nit so much. He was starting to regret a lot of his decisions at the moment,\nincluding some he made in the third grade.</p><p>Cyrus&rsquo; throat burned dry as he\nfound the courage to start the conversation. He waited until his mom started\nstacking dishes, and he finally said, &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he licked his chapping lips, &ldquo;I\nneed to talk to you two.&rdquo; Leslie and Frank quickly looked at TJ and Cyrus said,\n&ldquo;Yes, TJ has to be here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on, Cyrus?&rdquo; Leslie\nset the dishes she was holding back down, giving him her full attention. Norman\nwas doing the same, and Cyrus had never felt their gazes so heavy.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know how to\nsay this,&rdquo; Cyrus rubbing the back of his neck with one hand, the other one\nreaching out to hold on tightly to TJ&rsquo;s own. Cyrus inhaled before telling them,\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gay.&rdquo; There was only a quick silence, Cyrus feeling light and heavy at the\nsame time. </p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus,&rdquo; Leslie placed her\nhands over her heart, &ldquo;I love you so so much. Come here,&rdquo; she stood up at the\nsame time as Norman. Cyrus felt his heart soar, his feet seeming to take flight\nas he walked over to his parents to hug them.</p><p>It was okay. Him and TJ would\nbe okay. He was okay</p><p>When they let him go, he immediately\nturned to look at TJ who was smiling sheepishly at the scene before him. </p><p>&ldquo;Am I allowed to make an\nassumption?&rdquo; Norman asked Cyrus, now also smiling at TJ.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Cyrus smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;TJ is your boyfriend?&rdquo; Norman\nasked him merrily, making the two younger boys feel so much better about\neverything. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That would be correct,&rdquo; Cyrus told\nthem with a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;TJ, come here,&rdquo; Leslie motioned\nhim over with her arm. TJ hesitantly got up, and when he went over to the other\nside of the table, Leslie pulled him into a hug. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I haven&rsquo;t noticed\nhow much happier Cyrus has been lately. Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus exhaled. </p><p>-</p><p>Cyrus somehow snuck TJ back up\ninto his room without his parents noticing. They probably wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed\nto be alone in his bedroom anytime soon, so he decided to take him back up\nbefore they took TJ home. </p><p>As soon as Cyrus shut the\ndoor, TJ pulled him in for a hug, knocking the wind out of him. &ldquo;TJ,&rdquo; Cyrus\nlaughed, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t breathe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; TJ put him down, a huge\nsmile on his face, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just so proud of you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for being with me,&rdquo;\nCyrus smiled up him.</p><p>&ldquo;I always want to be there for\nyou, okay?&rdquo; TJ said, bending down to give him a quick kiss. &ldquo;Can I finish going\nthrough the journal now?&rdquo; Cyrus bit, his lip. He knew he had to tell him about\nthe crush he had on Jonah. It was only fair.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Cyrus nodded, going over\nto the end of his bed with TJ. TJ went to the last page where they were, the\nstupid polaroid picture of him and Jonah standing out.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you,&rdquo; TJ paused for a\nsecond, making Cyrus&rsquo; heart fall, &ldquo;like him?&rdquo; </p><hr /><p>I&rsquo;m back to sporadic updates!!
