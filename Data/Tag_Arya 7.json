        "body": "<p>The direwolves of ASoIaF were the first things ever to exist in the series, the scene of the Starks finding them was the first thing GRRM ever thought of that eventually led to the books we know and love, plus the TV show we watched. Every single direwolf tells you so much about its corresponding kid, packed with a whole bunch of symbolism.\u00a0</p><p>For starters, every direwolf mirrors the personality of the kid- Grey Wind was fierce in battle, stern, and intelligent like Robb. Lady, for the short time that we knew her, was quiet and gentle like early Sansa. Summer is Bran in most aspects, as he gains Bran\u2019s intelligence whenever he is warged. Summer notably tries to climb a tree, despite being a wolf, because he is Bran\u2019s. Nymeria is just like Arya too, being adventurous, and violent. Very violent, Arya and Nymeria have a sort of positive feedback loop in their violence, for the Night Wolf, their combined personality, is a mankiller leading hundreds of wolves, killing Lannisters like a champion. That too is similar to Rickon and Shaggydog, Rickon is repeatedly described as being\u00a0\u2018wild\u2019, and Shaggydog repeatedly savages and bites humans. Ghost is silent like broody Jon, but seems to be a good deal smarter than his human. It\u2019s helpful to remember that, in the books, every single Stark kid is a warg. Robb and Grey Wind fight\u00a0\u2018like one\u2019, Sansa unfortunately never gets the opportunity to warg Lady, Bran is the most obvious example, Arya wargs Nymeria every night, as well as stray Braavosi cats, and we never see Rickon\u2019s perspective, but he too is very close to his wolf. Jon wargs Ghost in his sleep, and Varamyr Sixskins confirms that he is a powerful warg.</p><p>All of that is mostly surface-level, however. It\u2019s pretty obvious that the Starks warg their wolves and have similar personalities, but what I like about the wolves is how they represent life and Stark identity. Also, the placement of the direwolves when they are first found is important. If you were to compare it to a family tree, you have the mother direwolf, lying dead on the ground, the five underneath her, and then Ghost, a white direwolf (white like Targaryen hair?) is off to the side, like a cousin would be. Jon is a cousin to the Stark kids.</p><p>The deaths of the direwolves hold meaning too. Sansa is a Stark, but she is the least Stark of all the kids. Sansa looks like a Tully, is south for the entire story, and her direwolf dies very early on. The death of Lady can be interpreted as the death of Sansa\u2019s Stark identity or status, distancing her from the other children. Similairly, Arya sends away Nymeria, she sends away a crucial part of her person, which ties into her themes of the loss of identity, while putting the notion that, it is not dead, only sent away. Arya is never truly able to give up being Arya Stark, because Nymeria is not dead and gone, only away temporarily. Arya loses her identity but she will likely regain it in the next two books. Robb never loses his Stark status in this way, instead he dies with his wolf, he dies a Stark. RIckon is currently absent in the books, but it is likely he will die in that same way, with his wolf, Rickon will likely die a Stark. Summer is not yet dead, but it is likely that, in the effort to truly become the three-eyed crow, he will die like in the show, and Bran will cease to be a Stark, and start being a crow.\u00a0</p><p>I find that Nymeria is the most interesting of all the wolves, as she can kind of be seen as a split piece of Arya. When Arya is the Night Wolf, that is the only time she feels whole, when with Nymeria. She fishes the dead body of her mother out of a river, she has a real pack, she has power when she is Nymeria. Arya is repeatedly described to have a\u00a0\u2018hole where her heart used to be\u2019, a missing piece of her soul and identity, which is Nymeria. Arya will never be whole until she is back with Nymeria, back with her Stark identity, back with her family.\u00a0</p><p>Ghost is the other wolf we know the most about, and mostly I interpret wolf as a bit of a clue to Jon\u2019s Targaryen identity, as he is white like the silver hair of the Targs. Ghost is also a very smart direwolf, smarter than Jon I would say, and he is able to scout, find the dead wights in the forest, and generally be the best boy in the universe who deserves pets.</p>",

Robb never loses his Stark status in this way, instead he dies with his wolf, he dies a Stark. RIckon is currently absent in the books, but it is likely he will die in that same way, with his wolf, Rickon will likely die a Stark. Summer is not yet dead, but it is likely that, in the effort to truly become the three-eyed crow, he will die like in the show, and Bran will cease to be a Stark, and start being a crow.\u00a0</p><p>I find that Nymeria is the most interesting of all the wolves, as she can kind of be seen as a split piece of Arya. When Arya is the Night Wolf, that is the only time she feels whole, when with Nymeria. She fishes the dead body of her mother out of a river, she has a real pack, she has power when she is Nymeria. Arya is repeatedly described to have a\u00a0\u2018hole where her heart used to be\u2019, a missing piece of her soul and identity, which is Nymeria. Arya will never be whole until she is back with Nymeria, back with her Stark identity, back with her family.\u00a0</p><p>Ghost is the other wolf we know the most about, and mostly I interpret wolf as a bit of a clue to Jon\u2019s Targaryen identity, as he is white like the silver hair of the Targs. Ghost is also a very smart direwolf, smarter than Jon I would say, and he is able to scout, find the dead wights in the forest, and generally be the best boy in the universe who deserves pets.</p>",

Every single direwolf tells you so much about its corresponding kid, packed with a whole bunch of symbolism.\u00a0</p><p>For starters, every direwolf mirrors the personality of the kid- Grey Wind was fierce in battle, stern, and intelligent like Robb. Lady, for the short time that we knew her, was quiet and gentle like early Sansa. Summer is Bran in most aspects, as he gains Bran\u2019s intelligence whenever he is warged. Summer notably tries to climb a tree, despite being a wolf, because he is Bran\u2019s. Nymeria is just like Arya too, being adventurous, and violent. Very violent, Arya and Nymeria have a sort of positive feedback loop in their violence, for the Night Wolf, their combined personality, is a mankiller leading hundreds of wolves, killing Lannisters like a champion. That too is similar to Rickon and Shaggydog, Rickon is repeatedly described as being\u00a0\u2018wild\u2019, and Shaggydog repeatedly savages and bites humans. Ghost is silent like broody Jon, but seems to be a good deal smarter than his human. It\u2019s helpful to remember that, in the books, every single Stark kid is a warg. Robb and Grey Wind fight\u00a0\u2018like one\u2019, Sansa unfortunately never gets the opportunity to warg Lady, Bran is the most obvious example, Arya wargs Nymeria every night, as well as stray Braavosi cats, and we never see Rickon\u2019s perspective, but he too is very close to his wolf. Jon wargs Ghost in his sleep, and Varamyr Sixskins confirms that he is a powerful warg.</p><p>All of that is mostly surface-level, however. It\u2019s pretty obvious that the Starks warg their wolves and have similar personalities, but what I like about the wolves is how they represent life and Stark identity. Also, the placement of the direwolves when they are first found is important. If you were to compare it to a family tree, you have the mother direwolf, lying dead on the ground, the five underneath her, and then Ghost, a white direwolf (white like Targaryen hair?) is off to the side, like a cousin would be. Jon is a cousin to the Stark kids.</p><p>The deaths of the direwolves hold meaning too. Sansa is a Stark, but she is the least Stark of all the kids. Sansa looks like a Tully, is south for the entire story, and her direwolf dies very early on. The death of Lady can be interpreted as the death of Sansa\u2019s Stark identity or status, distancing her from the other children. Similairly, Arya sends away Nymeria, she sends away a crucial part of her person, which ties into her themes of the loss of identity, while putting the notion that, it is not dead, only sent away. Arya is never truly able to give up being Arya Stark, because Nymeria is not dead and gone, only away temporarily. Arya loses her identity but she will likely regain it in the next two books.
