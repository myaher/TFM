House Stark had a period of infighting for Winterfell. But all of those people were legitimate. We don't hear anything about Lonnel Snow trying anything. Their argument was that Catelyn should have been less worried about a bastard son and more worried if she died and Ned tried to remarry. The situation is obviously more complex and personal though than just that. Thanks.",

Catelyn was not a stranger to the news of what had been talked about around Winterfell; she felt it was her duty to ask her son whether the rumours were right. Robb did as he promised for Y/n and told his mother that he and Y/n had slept together before she left for King\u2019s Landing; that he had taken her maidenhead and the child she was carrying was his. His mother could not hide her disappointment with both Robb and Y/n, she thought her son had been raised better than sleep with the queen\u2019s sister but she did not stay angry with the pair for long. After all it was Y/n that saved the lives of her child and her husband, she was bitter that she could no longer be with her husband, Catelyn was relieved that he was still alive. </p><p>There were times that Y/n felt saddened that she had allowed Robb to cover the fact that Jon was the father of her child. Feeling guilty that she could not tell him of her situation, if her family had learnt what had really happened then Jon\u2019s life would be forfeit. </p><p>She and Robb had become close over the coming months, although it had taken her some time to open up, sometimes she was angry with herself that she had stopped Robb from marrying someone he really wanted to be with. They had yet to be intimate with one another, most assumed that she and Robb were madly in love with one another but were nothing but friends. Y/n had been pleased that she had married a man that respected her; he was kind and gentle with her and did not force her to do anything she was not comfortable with.</p><p>It had taken Robb some time to settle with his new role as Lord Stark of Winterfell, he often worried that he was not good enough and that his father would be disappointed in him. But both Y/n and Catelyn had reassured him that he was doing a good job and that Ned would be proud of him. </p><p>They had received a raven from Ned himself telling his family that he was safe and had arrived at Winterfell, Y/n wondered if Jon knew about her marriage to his brother and hoped that he would not judge her for her actions. She wished she could explain it all to him but it was too late for that, Y/n knew that he would have taken his vows and it would not make a difference. For Robb she had to forget and move on with her life, she had married Robb and promised that she would make the marriage work. </p><p>Y/n was almost nine moons into her pregnancy, her belly had swelled and she was finding it hard to move around Winterfell as she used to. Rob and his family had been kind to her, although at times Y/n thought she did not deserve it, after all she had been lying who the true father of her child was. At times she worried that people would find out what had happened, especially her nephew Joffrey, scared that he would send men for Jon\u2019s head. None of her family had truly cared for her except Tyrion, he had visited her a few times since her marriage, and he stayed for several weeks before returning to King\u2019s Landing. Both her father and Cersei sent ravens upon hearing the news that she was with child, therefore sealing her future as the Lady of Winterfell. Y/n had always dreamt that she had another family elsewhere, that in fact she had been taken as a child; which would explain why her family treated her so cruelly. It was Tyrion that was always by her side when she grew up, as everyone else would treat them as outcasts, as if they had something to be ashamed about.</p><p>Her one fear had been that she would die as her mother had in childbirth, Y/n did not want to suffer the same fate, she wanted to her child grow and thrive. She would fill her child\u2019s life with so much love and joy, reminding them that they were loved and that they were wanted. </p><p>As her pregnancy was soon coming to an end it was advised that Y/n remain only in her rooms, not to venture outside as they worried that she may slip, fall and injury herself or her child. Rob had been there when he first felt their child move and kick against his palm. Many times she would awake and find Rob talking to her unborn child; she knew that he would be an amazing father. Y/n hoped that one day she would carry his child, to be a good wife to him as she hoped her heart would heal and open up to him.</p><p>That afternoon Y/n sat by the fire, it was growing colder, Robb was right; winter is coming. Sansa sat with her, keeping her company as they stitch together. They sat talking quietly as they shared stories with one another, Sansa telling her stories of Robb as they grew up together. As Y/n giggled along to Sansa\u2019s story she felt a sharp pain in her stomach before she felt something wet escaping between her thighs. Sansa watches Y/n as she grimaces, a smile longer on Y/n\u2019s face or her soft laughter filling the room.</p><p>\u2018Y/n, are you well?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think the baby is coming, Sansa I need you to find your mother and tell her. We need the master or Septa\u2019</p><p>\u2018Now?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, the baby is coming please\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, Yes I will\u2019 Sansa nervously replies, Y/n can see the fear in the young girl\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u2018Sansa it\u2019s going to be alright, it will be a little while before the baby will be here. There is nothing to worry about. Could you help me out of the chair I need to get to the bed?\u2019</p><p>Sansa quickly nods as she takes Y/n\u2019s hands and careful pulls her up out of the seat, Y/n slowly waddles to the bed as she watches Sansa rush out of the room. She quietly chuckles to herself as she unties her gown; she places it onto her wooden chest before pulling the sheets down the bed; Y/n did not wish to ruin the furs. Catelyn had once told her what it was like to give birth, but inside it not ease the nervousness she felt inside scared she would suffer the same fate as her mother. As Y/n </p><p>waited patiently on the bed Sansa quickly returned with Rob following behind her, a worried expression on his face.</p><p>\u2018What happened? Are you alright? Is the baby really coming\u2019 he burst out, making Y/n smile as he moved towards her.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m fine Rob; the baby will be here soon, my waters have broken. Sansa did you find your mother?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Yes..\u2019 Sansa replies followed by a sigh as she tries to catch her breath \u2018She has gone in search of the Maester and Septa?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank you Sansa\u2019</p><p>Rob brushes Y/n\u2019s hair from her face as he looks into her eyes; it was as if he could sense her emotions and how she was feeling.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s going to be alright Y/n, I will not allow anything to happen to you\u2019 he promises \u2018I will stay by your side as long as it takes\u2019</p><p>\u2018I do not think your mother would allow that Rob\u2019</p><p>\u2018I am the Lord of Winterfell now and I wish to stay with my wife\u2019</p><p>Her heart swells as he puts his foot down, sometimes his mother would tell him how to run Winterfell, Y/n knew she was only advising him the best way but sometimes it drove him mad. But Y/n was right Catelyn had tried to force Rob to leave their room, but there was nothing they could to make him leave. Instead he took a chair and sat by the bed as he held her hand, she could have wished for a better husband; caring and loving. Y/n knew that Rob was falling for her; she could see it in his eyes when he looked at her. She could feel herself falling for him also but hoped that she would forget about Jon and not compare the brothers. </p><p>Rob was there throughout the birth, he held onto her hand as she pushed her baby into the world, a beautiful little girl. Her daughter had a beautiful head of dark hair, she wondered if one day it would be as dark as her fathers. Rob and Y/n had already discussed what names she would like for their baby, but there was only one name that stood out for Y/n. She named her daughter Joanna after her mother, she knew her father would be furious but Y/n wished to honour her late mother.</p><p>\u2018She is so beautiful\u2019 Rob told her as he watched his wife hold Joanna in her arms \u2018I did not know they could be so small\u2019</p><p>\u2018Would you like to hold her?\u2019</p><p>\u2018What if I drop her?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Rob you will not drop her, do not worry. Just copy what I am doing\u2019 she promises as she places the small bundle in his arms. Y/n is cleaned up by the septa and her lady in waiting as the maids clear their bed, placing fresh sheets onto the mattress. Y/n watches from a distance as Rob cradles Joanna in his arms, a soft smile on his face as she sleeps quietly. </p><p>Y/n is asked if she would like a wet nurse for her a daughter but her answer is immediately no, that she wishes to nurse her own child. They are taken aback but Rob smirks as she takes Joanna and </p><p>watches curiously as the baby suckles onto her breast. It is the first time he has seen something so intimate; he had caught glimpses of Y/n naked on several occasions when she bathed but had never without her consent. The couple are left alone together as they finally breathe a sigh of relief that both mother and child are safe.</p><p>\u2018Thank you Rob for staying with me, I could not have done this without you\u2019</p><p>\u2018I would rather be by your side than anywhere else\u2019 he tells her, his hand strokes the back of Joanna\u2019s head \u2018She has his hair\u2019</p><p>\u2018Do you think they will learn the truth?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No I think we are safe, we have to be careful\u2019</p><p>\u2018No one can know, I have already risked everything by getting you and your father involved. You have done more for me than my own family, except Tyrion\u2019</p><p>\u2018Everything will be fine there is nothing to worry about\u2019</p><p>\u2018Rob I want to tell Jon, just send him a letter\u2019</p><p>\u2018Y/n that letter could get in the wrong hands; it is too much of a risk. Jon, my family could be hurt if your father, Cersei learned the truth about Joanna\u2019 he warns her as he moves his hand to cup her cheek \u2018I know you care for Jon and that you wish to explain everything but we cannot; you have to trust me Y/n\u2019</p><p>\u2018I trust you Rob, always have\u2019</p><p>\u2018I love you Y/n, I know that you do not feel the same for me just yet but I do not wish for you to be hurt or Joanna. Jon cannot come back for you Y/n; he has taken his vows and is a knight of the watch\u2019 </p><p>His words hurt her for a moment but he was speaking the truth, he had always promised to be truthful and to speak his mind.</p><p>\u2018Give me time Rob, I promised you I would give you a chance and I care for you very much. Do not give up on me, I understand that Jon cannot come back but I just want to explain. I cannot bare for him to hate me, I am not like my family\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018He will not hate you, no doubt he understands the situation we are in and that there was not other way out\u2019 he answers her\u00a0\u2018I will never give up on you Y/n\u2019<br/></p><p>Y/n smiles as she leans forward and presses her lips against his, she soon pulls away focusing on her daughter as Rob watches on.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>What do you think should happen next?

She would fill her child\u2019s life with so much love and joy, reminding them that they were loved and that they were wanted. </p><p>As her pregnancy was soon coming to an end it was advised that Y/n remain only in her rooms, not to venture outside as they worried that she may slip, fall and injury herself or her child. Rob had been there when he first felt their child move and kick against his palm. Many times she would awake and find Rob talking to her unborn child; she knew that he would be an amazing father. Y/n hoped that one day she would carry his child, to be a good wife to him as she hoped her heart would heal and open up to him.</p><p>That afternoon Y/n sat by the fire, it was growing colder, Robb was right; winter is coming. Sansa sat with her, keeping her company as they stitch together. They sat talking quietly as they shared stories with one another, Sansa telling her stories of Robb as they grew up together. As Y/n giggled along to Sansa\u2019s story she felt a sharp pain in her stomach before she felt something wet escaping between her thighs. Sansa watches Y/n as she grimaces, a smile longer on Y/n\u2019s face or her soft laughter filling the room.</p><p>\u2018Y/n, are you well?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think the baby is coming, Sansa I need you to find your mother and tell her. We need the master or Septa\u2019</p><p>\u2018Now?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, the baby is coming please\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, Yes I will\u2019 Sansa nervously replies, Y/n can see the fear in the young girl\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u2018Sansa it\u2019s going to be alright, it will be a little while before the baby will be here. There is nothing to worry about. Could you help me out of the chair I need to get to the bed?\u2019</p><p>Sansa quickly nods as she takes Y/n\u2019s hands and careful pulls her up out of the seat, Y/n slowly waddles to the bed as she watches Sansa rush out of the room. She quietly chuckles to herself as she unties her gown; she places it onto her wooden chest before pulling the sheets down the bed; Y/n did not wish to ruin the furs. Catelyn had once told her what it was like to give birth, but inside it not ease the nervousness she felt inside scared she would suffer the same fate as her mother. As Y/n </p><p>waited patiently on the bed Sansa quickly returned with Rob following behind her, a worried expression on his face.</p><p>\u2018What happened? Are you alright? Is the baby really coming\u2019 he burst out, making Y/n smile as he moved towards her.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m fine Rob; the baby will be here soon, my waters have broken. Sansa did you find your mother?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Yes..\u2019 Sansa replies followed by a sigh as she tries to catch her breath \u2018She has gone in search of the Maester and Septa?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank you Sansa\u2019</p><p>Rob brushes Y/n\u2019s hair from her face as he looks into her eyes; it was as if he could sense her emotions and how she was feeling.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s going to be alright Y/n, I will not allow anything to happen to you\u2019 he promises \u2018I will stay by your side as long as it takes\u2019</p><p>\u2018I do not think your mother would allow that Rob\u2019</p><p>\u2018I am the Lord of Winterfell now and I wish to stay with my wife\u2019</p><p>Her heart swells as he puts his foot down, sometimes his mother would tell him how to run Winterfell, Y/n knew she was only advising him the best way but sometimes it drove him mad. But Y/n was right Catelyn had tried to force Rob to leave their room, but there was nothing they could to make him leave. Instead he took a chair and sat by the bed as he held her hand, she could have wished for a better husband; caring and loving. Y/n knew that Rob was falling for her; she could see it in his eyes when he looked at her. She could feel herself falling for him also but hoped that she would forget about Jon and not compare the brothers. </p><p>Rob was there throughout the birth, he held onto her hand as she pushed her baby into the world, a beautiful little girl. Her daughter had a beautiful head of dark hair, she wondered if one day it would be as dark as her fathers. Rob and Y/n had already discussed what names she would like for their baby, but there was only one name that stood out for Y/n. She named her daughter Joanna after her mother, she knew her father would be furious but Y/n wished to honour her late mother.</p><p>\u2018She is so beautiful\u2019 Rob told her as he watched his wife hold Joanna in her arms \u2018I did not know they could be so small\u2019</p><p>\u2018Would you like to hold her?\u2019</p><p>\u2018What if I drop her?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Rob you will not drop her, do not worry. Just copy what I am doing\u2019 she promises as she places the small bundle in his arms. Y/n is cleaned up by the septa and her lady in waiting as the maids clear their bed, placing fresh sheets onto the mattress. Y/n watches from a distance as Rob cradles Joanna in his arms, a soft smile on his face as she sleeps quietly. </p><p>Y/n is asked if she would like a wet nurse for her a daughter but her answer is immediately no, that she wishes to nurse her own child. They are taken aback but Rob smirks as she takes Joanna and </p><p>watches curiously as the baby suckles onto her breast. It is the first time he has seen something so intimate; he had caught glimpses of Y/n naked on several occasions when she bathed but had never without her consent. The couple are left alone together as they finally breathe a sigh of relief that both mother and child are safe.</p><p>\u2018Thank you Rob for staying with me, I could not have done this without you\u2019</p><p>\u2018I would rather be by your side than anywhere else\u2019 he tells her, his hand strokes the back of Joanna\u2019s head \u2018She has his hair\u2019</p><p>\u2018Do you think they will learn the truth?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No I think we are safe, we have to be careful\u2019</p><p>\u2018No one can know, I have already risked everything by getting you and your father involved. You have done more for me than my own family, except Tyrion\u2019</p><p>\u2018Everything will be fine there is nothing to worry about\u2019</p><p>\u2018Rob I want to tell Jon, just send him a letter\u2019</p><p>\u2018Y/n that letter could get in the wrong hands; it is too much of a risk. Jon, my family could be hurt if your father, Cersei learned the truth about Joanna\u2019 he warns her as he moves his hand to cup her cheek \u2018I know you care for Jon and that you wish to explain everything but we cannot; you have to trust me Y/n\u2019</p><p>\u2018I trust you Rob, always have\u2019</p><p>\u2018I love you Y/n, I know that you do not feel the same for me just yet but I do not wish for you to be hurt or Joanna. Jon cannot come back for you Y/n; he has taken his vows and is a knight of the watch\u2019 </p><p>His words hurt her for a moment but he was speaking the truth, he had always promised to be truthful and to speak his mind.</p><p>\u2018Give me time Rob, I promised you I would give you a chance and I care for you very much. Do not give up on me, I understand that Jon cannot come back but I just want to explain. I cannot bare for him to hate me, I am not like my family\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018He will not hate you, no doubt he understands the situation we are in and that there was not other way out\u2019 he answers her\u00a0\u2018I will never give up on you Y/n\u2019<br></p><p>Y/n smiles as she leans forward and presses her lips against his, she soon pulls away focusing on her daughter as Rob watches on.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>What do you think should happen next?

Catelyn was not a stranger to the news of what had been talked about around Winterfell; she felt it was her duty to ask her son whether the rumours were right. Robb did as he promised for Y/n and told his mother that he and Y/n had slept together before she left for King\u2019s Landing; that he had taken her maidenhead and the child she was carrying was his. His mother could not hide her disappointment with both Robb and Y/n, she thought her son had been raised better than sleep with the queen\u2019s sister but she did not stay angry with the pair for long. After all it was Y/n that saved the lives of her child and her husband, she was bitter that she could no longer be with her husband, Catelyn was relieved that he was still alive. </p><p>There were times that Y/n felt saddened that she had allowed Robb to cover the fact that Jon was the father of her child. Feeling guilty that she could not tell him of her situation, if her family had learnt what had really happened then Jon\u2019s life would be forfeit. </p><p>She and Robb had become close over the coming months, although it had taken her some time to open up, sometimes she was angry with herself that she had stopped Robb from marrying someone he really wanted to be with. They had yet to be intimate with one another, most assumed that she and Robb were madly in love with one another but were nothing but friends. Y/n had been pleased that she had married a man that respected her; he was kind and gentle with her and did not force her to do anything she was not comfortable with.</p><p>It had taken Robb some time to settle with his new role as Lord Stark of Winterfell, he often worried that he was not good enough and that his father would be disappointed in him. But both Y/n and Catelyn had reassured him that he was doing a good job and that Ned would be proud of him. </p><p>They had received a raven from Ned himself telling his family that he was safe and had arrived at Winterfell, Y/n wondered if Jon knew about her marriage to his brother and hoped that he would not judge her for her actions. She wished she could explain it all to him but it was too late for that, Y/n knew that he would have taken his vows and it would not make a difference. For Robb she had to forget and move on with her life, she had married Robb and promised that she would make the marriage work. </p><p>Y/n was almost nine moons into her pregnancy, her belly had swelled and she was finding it hard to move around Winterfell as she used to. Rob and his family had been kind to her, although at times Y/n thought she did not deserve it, after all she had been lying who the true father of her child was. At times she worried that people would find out what had happened, especially her nephew Joffrey, scared that he would send men for Jon\u2019s head. None of her family had truly cared for her except Tyrion, he had visited her a few times since her marriage, and he stayed for several weeks before returning to King\u2019s Landing. Both her father and Cersei sent ravens upon hearing the news that she was with child, therefore sealing her future as the Lady of Winterfell. Y/n had always dreamt that she had another family elsewhere, that in fact she had been taken as a child; which would explain why her family treated her so cruelly. It was Tyrion that was always by her side when she grew up, as everyone else would treat them as outcasts, as if they had something to be ashamed about.</p><p>Her one fear had been that she would die as her mother had in childbirth, Y/n did not want to suffer the same fate, she wanted to her child grow and thrive. She would fill her child\u2019s life with so much love and joy, reminding them that they were loved and that they were wanted. </p><p>As her pregnancy was soon coming to an end it was advised that Y/n remain only in her rooms, not to venture outside as they worried that she may slip, fall and injury herself or her child. Rob had been there when he first felt their child move and kick against his palm. Many times she would awake and find Rob talking to her unborn child; she knew that he would be an amazing father. Y/n hoped that one day she would carry his child, to be a good wife to him as she hoped her heart would heal and open up to him.</p><p>That afternoon Y/n sat by the fire, it was growing colder, Robb was right; winter is coming. Sansa sat with her, keeping her company as they stitch together. They sat talking quietly as they shared stories with one another, Sansa telling her stories of Robb as they grew up together.

Sansa watches Y/n as she grimaces, a smile longer on Y/n\u2019s face or her soft laughter filling the room.</p><p>\u2018Y/n, are you well?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think the baby is coming, Sansa I need you to find your mother and tell her. We need the master or Septa\u2019</p><p>\u2018Now?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, the baby is coming please\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, Yes I will\u2019 Sansa nervously replies, Y/n can see the fear in the young girl\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u2018Sansa it\u2019s going to be alright, it will be a little while before the baby will be here. There is nothing to worry about. Could you help me out of the chair I need to get to the bed?\u2019</p><p>Sansa quickly nods as she takes Y/n\u2019s hands and careful pulls her up out of the seat, Y/n slowly waddles to the bed as she watches Sansa rush out of the room. She quietly chuckles to herself as she unties her gown; she places it onto her wooden chest before pulling the sheets down the bed; Y/n did not wish to ruin the furs. Catelyn had once told her what it was like to give birth, but inside it not ease the nervousness she felt inside scared she would suffer the same fate as her mother. As Y/n </p><p>waited patiently on the bed Sansa quickly returned with Rob following behind her, a worried expression on his face.</p><p>\u2018What happened? Are you alright? Is the baby really coming\u2019 he burst out, making Y/n smile as he moved towards her.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m fine Rob; the baby will be here soon, my waters have broken. Sansa did you find your mother?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Yes..\u2019 Sansa replies followed by a sigh as she tries to catch her breath \u2018She has gone in search of the Maester and Septa?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank you Sansa\u2019</p><p>Rob brushes Y/n\u2019s hair from her face as he looks into her eyes; it was as if he could sense her emotions and how she was feeling.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s going to be alright Y/n, I will not allow anything to happen to you\u2019 he promises \u2018I will stay by your side as long as it takes\u2019</p><p>\u2018I do not think your mother would allow that Rob\u2019</p><p>\u2018I am the Lord of Winterfell now and I wish to stay with my wife\u2019</p><p>Her heart swells as he puts his foot down, sometimes his mother would tell him how to run Winterfell, Y/n knew she was only advising him the best way but sometimes it drove him mad.

                "content": "<p><h2><b>Part 13</b></h2><p>As the months past Y/n could no longer deny that she was with child, there was gossip that she fell pregnant very quickly and speculated that she and Robb had been intimate before they were married. Catelyn was not a stranger to the news of what had been talked about around Winterfell; she felt it was her duty to ask her son whether the rumours were right. Robb did as he promised for Y/n and told his mother that he and Y/n had slept together before she left for King&rsquo;s Landing; that he had taken her maidenhead and the child she was carrying was his. His mother could not hide her disappointment with both Robb and Y/n, she thought her son had been raised better than sleep with the queen&rsquo;s sister but she did not stay angry with the pair for long. After all it was Y/n that saved the lives of her child and her husband, she was bitter that she could no longer be with her husband, Catelyn was relieved that he was still alive. </p><p>There were times that Y/n felt saddened that she had allowed Robb to cover the fact that Jon was the father of her child. Feeling guilty that she could not tell him of her situation, if her family had learnt what had really happened then Jon&rsquo;s life would be forfeit. </p><p>She and Robb had become close over the coming months, although it had taken her some time to open up, sometimes she was angry with herself that she had stopped Robb from marrying someone he really wanted to be with. They had yet to be intimate with one another, most assumed that she and Robb were madly in love with one another but were nothing but friends. Y/n had been pleased that she had married a man that respected her; he was kind and gentle with her and did not force her to do anything she was not comfortable with.</p><p>It had taken Robb some time to settle with his new role as Lord Stark of Winterfell, he often worried that he was not good enough and that his father would be disappointed in him. But both Y/n and Catelyn had reassured him that he was doing a good job and that Ned would be proud of him. </p><p>They had received a raven from Ned himself telling his family that he was safe and had arrived at Winterfell, Y/n wondered if Jon knew about her marriage to his brother and hoped that he would not judge her for her actions. She wished she could explain it all to him but it was too late for that, Y/n knew that he would have taken his vows and it would not make a difference. For Robb she had to forget and move on with her life, she had married Robb and promised that she would make the marriage work. </p><p>Y/n was almost nine moons into her pregnancy, her belly had swelled and she was finding it hard to move around Winterfell as she used to. Rob and his family had been kind to her, although at times Y/n thought she did not deserve it, after all she had been lying who the true father of her child was. At times she worried that people would find out what had happened, especially her nephew Joffrey, scared that he would send men for Jon&rsquo;s head. None of her family had truly cared for her except Tyrion, he had visited her a few times since her marriage, and he stayed for several weeks before returning to King&rsquo;s Landing. Both her father and Cersei sent ravens upon hearing the news that she was with child, therefore sealing her future as the Lady of Winterfell. Y/n had always dreamt that she had another family elsewhere, that in fact she had been taken as a child; which would explain why her family treated her so cruelly. It was Tyrion that was always by her side when she grew up, as everyone else would treat them as outcasts, as if they had something to be ashamed about.</p><p>Her one fear had been that she would die as her mother had in childbirth, Y/n did not want to suffer the same fate, she wanted to her child grow and thrive. She would fill her child&rsquo;s life with so much love and joy, reminding them that they were loved and that they were wanted. </p><p>As her pregnancy was soon coming to an end it was advised that Y/n remain only in her rooms, not to venture outside as they worried that she may slip, fall and injury herself or her child. Rob had been there when he first felt their child move and kick against his palm. Many times she would awake and find Rob talking to her unborn child; she knew that he would be an amazing father. Y/n hoped that one day she would carry his child, to be a good wife to him as she hoped her heart would heal and open up to him.</p><p>That afternoon Y/n sat by the fire, it was growing colder, Robb was right; winter is coming. Sansa sat with her, keeping her company as they stitch together. They sat talking quietly as they shared stories with one another, Sansa telling her stories of Robb as they grew up together. As Y/n giggled along to Sansa&rsquo;s story she felt a sharp pain in her stomach before she felt something wet escaping between her thighs. Sansa watches Y/n as she grimaces, a smile longer on Y/n&rsquo;s face or her soft laughter filling the room.</p><p>&lsquo;Y/n, are you well?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I think the baby is coming, Sansa I need you to find your mother and tell her. We need the master or Septa&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Now?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Yes, the baby is coming please&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Yes, Yes I will&rsquo; Sansa nervously replies, Y/n can see the fear in the young girl&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p>&lsquo;Sansa it&rsquo;s going to be alright, it will be a little while before the baby will be here. There is nothing to worry about. Could you help me out of the chair I need to get to the bed?&rsquo;</p><p>Sansa quickly nods as she takes Y/n&rsquo;s hands and careful pulls her up out of the seat, Y/n slowly waddles to the bed as she watches Sansa rush out of the room. She quietly chuckles to herself as she unties her gown; she places it onto her wooden chest before pulling the sheets down the bed; Y/n did not wish to ruin the furs. Catelyn had once told her what it was like to give birth, but inside it not ease the nervousness she felt inside scared she would suffer the same fate as her mother. As Y/n </p><p>waited patiently on the bed Sansa quickly returned with Rob following behind her, a worried expression on his face.</p><p>&lsquo;What happened? Are you alright? Is the baby really coming&rsquo; he burst out, making Y/n smile as he moved towards her.</p><p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m fine Rob; the baby will be here soon, my waters have broken. Sansa did you find your mother?&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;Yes..&rsquo; Sansa replies followed by a sigh as she tries to catch her breath &lsquo;She has gone in search of the Maester and Septa?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Thank you Sansa&rsquo;</p><p>Rob brushes Y/n&rsquo;s hair from her face as he looks into her eyes; it was as if he could sense her emotions and how she was feeling.</p><p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s going to be alright Y/n, I will not allow anything to happen to you&rsquo; he promises &lsquo;I will stay by your side as long as it takes&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I do not think your mother would allow that Rob&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I am the Lord of Winterfell now and I wish to stay with my wife&rsquo;</p><p>Her heart swells as he puts his foot down, sometimes his mother would tell him how to run Winterfell, Y/n knew she was only advising him the best way but sometimes it drove him mad. But Y/n was right Catelyn had tried to force Rob to leave their room, but there was nothing they could to make him leave. Instead he took a chair and sat by the bed as he held her hand, she could have wished for a better husband; caring and loving. Y/n knew that Rob was falling for her; she could see it in his eyes when he looked at her. She could feel herself falling for him also but hoped that she would forget about Jon and not compare the brothers. </p><p>Rob was there throughout the birth, he held onto her hand as she pushed her baby into the world, a beautiful little girl. Her daughter had a beautiful head of dark hair, she wondered if one day it would be as dark as her fathers. Rob and Y/n had already discussed what names she would like for their baby, but there was only one name that stood out for Y/n. She named her daughter Joanna after her mother, she knew her father would be furious but Y/n wished to honour her late mother.</p><p>&lsquo;She is so beautiful&rsquo; Rob told her as he watched his wife hold Joanna in her arms &lsquo;I did not know they could be so small&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Would you like to hold her?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;What if I drop her?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Rob you will not drop her, do not worry. Just copy what I am doing&rsquo; she promises as she places the small bundle in his arms. Y/n is cleaned up by the septa and her lady in waiting as the maids clear their bed, placing fresh sheets onto the mattress. Y/n watches from a distance as Rob cradles Joanna in his arms, a soft smile on his face as she sleeps quietly. </p><p>Y/n is asked if she would like a wet nurse for her a daughter but her answer is immediately no, that she wishes to nurse her own child. They are taken aback but Rob smirks as she takes Joanna and </p><p>watches curiously as the baby suckles onto her breast. It is the first time he has seen something so intimate; he had caught glimpses of Y/n naked on several occasions when she bathed but had never without her consent. The couple are left alone together as they finally breathe a sigh of relief that both mother and child are safe.</p><p>&lsquo;Thank you Rob for staying with me, I could not have done this without you&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I would rather be by your side than anywhere else&rsquo; he tells her, his hand strokes the back of Joanna&rsquo;s head &lsquo;She has his hair&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Do you think they will learn the truth?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;No I think we are safe, we have to be careful&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;No one can know, I have already risked everything by getting you and your father involved. You have done more for me than my own family, except Tyrion&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Everything will be fine there is nothing to worry about&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Rob I want to tell Jon, just send him a letter&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Y/n that letter could get in the wrong hands; it is too much of a risk. Jon, my family could be hurt if your father, Cersei learned the truth about Joanna&rsquo; he warns her as he moves his hand to cup her cheek &lsquo;I know you care for Jon and that you wish to explain everything but we cannot; you have to trust me Y/n&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I trust you Rob, always have&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I love you Y/n, I know that you do not feel the same for me just yet but I do not wish for you to be hurt or Joanna. Jon cannot come back for you Y/n; he has taken his vows and is a knight of the watch&rsquo; </p><p>His words hurt her for a moment but he was speaking the truth, he had always promised to be truthful and to speak his mind.</p><p>&lsquo;Give me time Rob, I promised you I would give you a chance and I care for you very much. Do not give up on me, I understand that Jon cannot come back but I just want to explain. I cannot bare for him to hate me, I am not like my family&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;He will not hate you, no doubt he understands the situation we are in and that there was not other way out&rsquo; he answers her&nbsp;&lsquo;I will never give up on you Y/n&rsquo;<br /></p><p>Y/n smiles as she leans forward and presses her lips against his, she soon pulls away focusing on her daughter as Rob watches on.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><b>What do you think should happen next?

                "content": "<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that dark!Jon is my favorite Jon. This side of Jon isn&rsquo;t a part of him we&rsquo;ll only see after he is brought back from the dead. dark!Jon is already very much present in the books and the show.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Somedays, I wonder how I can be watching the same show or reading the same books as other fans. Today was one of those days. A fan disagreed with me about Jon being a bad boy. To each their own I say. It could be that my definition of&nbsp;&lsquo;bad boy&rsquo; is a different then that person. A&nbsp;&lsquo;bad boy&rsquo; is someone with a morality not always aligned with the status quo and considered an outsider. This fits Jon pretty well. He even says black is his favorite color!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I&rsquo;ll admit that the show whitewashed him a lot. This person claimed that book!Jon was more&nbsp;&lsquo;milquetoast&rsquo; then show!Jon. I can&rsquo;t get on board with that. I decided to create a list of actions that push Jon into the dark grey zone of morality.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Things Book!Jon or book!Jon and show!Jon did that fall under grey morality or make him dark or in some cases a jerk.&nbsp;</b></p><ul><li>As a kid, Jon and Robb would play fight.
