The kind heart is protected by steel (\u201dfrom porcelain to ivory to\u201d) much like Brienne has a physical armor. Much of Sansa\u2019s arc, I feel, is reclaiming the inner wild woman within.

Now she is very much beloved the iconic Queen of North, but there\u2019s been a sort of mythos she is without criticism and that is not true. Sansa is superficial and manipulative to an extent, something she learns to survive.

Or maybe it is fate, with the urn Sansa carries still in her hands.\u00a0</p><p>Or maybe it is planned, unconsciously.\u00a0</p><p>Whatever it is, Sansa wordlessly nods at Arya and Bran; Arya pushes Bran ahead.</p><p>\u201cLady Greyjoy,\u201d says Sansa, only her slightly shaking hands any indication of her nerves.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace, Sansa Stark - Queen in the North.\u201d There\u2019s an edge to her voice, one Sansa expected. It\u2019s a mixture of disgust, disappointment, and anger. But the loudest emotion is pain.\u00a0\u201cWhat does your Grace want?\u201d<br/></p><p>Sansa lets her gaze flicker downwards for a moment; but she is a queen now and will not be intimidated. With clear voice and strong heart, Sansa ignores the cracks inside. \u201cI want to apologize for my sister\u2019s earlier threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo you don\u2019t,\u201d says Yara, her smirk sarcastic and her voice bitter.\u00a0\u201cYou only wished you could have made the threat yourself.\u201d</p><p>It makes sense now; the confidence that masked anger and fear in Theon as a child. Sansa sees it again, now, with Yara. She bites back a smile.\u00a0\u201cThat would not have been proper.\u201d</p><p>Yara rolls her eyes.\u00a0\u201cYour brother killed my queen.\u201d Her hands are tense, gripping her sword and axe tightly. \u201cHe killed my queen - but you. You killed my brother.\u201d</p><p>A crack, somewhere within her chest; it\u2019s numb now, not as painful as before, but it\u2019s still there, an acidic fire threatening to burn her whole.\u00a0\u201cHe saved my life.\u201d The words are honey on her lips.\u00a0\u201cI loved him.\u201d</p><p>Yara\u2019s eyes narrow.\u00a0\u201cHe spoke of you. Fondly. Said <i>you</i>\u00a0saved <i>him</i>. You\u2019re pretty, I will give him that. But no matter how good or pretty you are - you\u2019re here and he\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d There\u2019s nothing else to be said; Sansa knows it, is living it. It\u2019s hard and painful and she tries not to dwell on it, not too much, because there\u2019s too much to do and she\u2019s suffered enough loss in her life.\u00a0</p><p>It scares her how easy it is to move on, now.</p><p>\u201cI want you to have this.\u201d Sansa gives the urn to his sister, his blood, his family. The scars on her heart pulse.\u00a0\u201cWe had to burn him - but he deserves to be scattered at sea. This is half.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhere is the rest?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIn the crypts of Winterfell.\u201d Yara takes the urn from her, studying it, softly - it\u2019s a rare moment where Sansa can see the affection and pain, before she hides it once more.
