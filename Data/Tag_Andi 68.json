She sat next to Andi in their usual spot in The Spoon, with Cyrus sulking in his seat across from them.</p><p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s nothing to talk to him about. He ditched me for some rude girl, plain and simple. Nothing I can do about it,\u201d Cyrus replied, throwing an uneaten baby tater back in the basket.</p><p>Andi responded, \u201cWhy are you so worked up about this, though? I mean, when the whole gun thing happened, we had to pry you away from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t his fault. I should\u2019ve figured this would happen, I\u2019m always the second choice,\u201d Cyrus mumbled.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Buffy leaned forward and took his hands in hers, much like when he\u2019d came out to her. \u201cYou are never just the second choice, okay? You\u2019re just as important as anyone else. And if TJ chose someone like her over someone as amazing as you, then he never deserved to be friends with you in the first place.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus gave her a small smile. \u201cThanks. And I know, it just hurts, you know? Like, he still chose her over me.\u201d</p><p>Buffy and Andi exchanged a look, leaving Cyrus to question, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing, Cy. It\u2019s weird that he just bailed on you,\u201d Andi replied.</p><p>Buffy added, \u201cYeah, he usually follows you around like a puppy. It just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s why it hurts so much,\u201d Cyrus murmured, leaning back in the booth.</p><p>Buffy squinted then, recognizing the face he was making. The last time he looked like that was when they\u2019d watched Jonah and Andi kiss. \u201cCy?\u201d</p><p>He looked up. \u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you can tell us anything, right?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus sighed. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Buffy asked slowly, \u201cDo you? Want to tell us anything?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus just shook his head, knowing exactly what she was implying.</p><p>\u201cYeah, not gonna lie, I\u2019m lost,\u201d Andi interrupted.</p><p>Buffy put her hand on her shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p><i>Would you hear me out </i></p><p><i>If I told you I was terrified for days?</i></p><p><i>Thought I was gonna break</i></p><p>\u201cKippen!\u201d</p><p>TJ looked up from his phone to see none other than Buffy Driscoll running up to him.</p><p>Buffy almost stopped in her tracks upon seeing how, well, horrible TJ looked. His face was paler than usual, he\u2019d acquired massive eye bags, and his hair was messy, lacking its usual overpowering gel. \u201cWhoa. Um, okay, what the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your business,\u201d TJ mumbled.</p><p>Buffy crossed her arms and sat down next to him. \u201cWhen my best friend is that upset, it automatically becomes my business. Why did you bail on Cyrus?\u201d</p><p>TJ sighed, leaning back in the bench he currently occupied. \u201cIt\u2019s really complicated.\u201d</p><p>Buffy took the seat next to him. \u201cI\u2019ve got time.\u201d</p><p><i>Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t stop it</i></p><p><i>Tried to slow it all down</i></p><p><i>Crying in the bathroom</i></p><p><i>Had to figure it out</i></p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019d rather to a costume with Cyrus than with me? Have fun with that.\u201d</p><p>Those words echoed in TJ\u2019s brain since they were first spoken. He thought he had it all covered, that he was being subtle enough that no one would pick up enough but still touchy enough where he could still express how he was feeling. Apparently not. TJ hadn\u2019t even thought about people thinking it was a bad thing, only hiding it because he has a crush on his straight best friend, that\u2019s embarrassing. Was it a bad thing? Would other people think it was a bad thing? Guess so, considering Kira does, or at least implied that she does. What if she told other people about it? What if everyone thought it was wrong? What if\u2014</p><p>And suddenly TJ broke down on the tiles of his bathroom floor in the middle of the night.</p><p>He had no other choice, did he? He had to do the costume with Kira, or else he\u2019d be outcasted even more than he used to be.</p><p>Classic TJ.</p><p><i>With everyone around me saying</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You must be so happy now&rdquo;</i></p><p>Cyrus watched as yet another person went up to congratulate TJ and Kira, sighing into his math homework.</p><p>Kira had recently announced over Instagram that the two had started dating.</p><p>Buffy was gone from school that day, so it was Andi\u2019s job to do some damage control, meaning constant hugs and reassurance that TJ is and always was a dick.</p><p>\u201cStop watching them, Cy, it\u2019s only going to make you feel worse,\u201d Andi said softly.</p><p>Cyrus replied shortly, \u201cHe stopped trying to text me.\u201d</p><p>Jonah, who sat next to Andi, asked, \u201cWell, isn\u2019t that a good thing then? If he was being such a bad friend to you, shouldn\u2019t you be happy he\u2019s out of your life now?\u201d</p><p><i>I should be</i>, Cyrus thought, <i>but I\u2019m not.</i> \u201cI guess. Something about this just feels so weird.\u201d</p><p>Andi grabbed his hand to console him. \u201cThat\u2019s totally fair, considering you li\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d Cyrus interrupted.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p><i>Oh, if you keep reaching out</i></p><p><i>Then I&rsquo;ll keep coming back</i></p><p><i>And if you&rsquo;re gone for good</i></p><p><i>Then I&rsquo;m okay with that</i></p><p><i>If you leave the light on</i></p><p><i>Then I&rsquo;ll leave the light on</i></p><p>It had been three and a half weeks since TJ had last tried to reach out to Cyrus.</p><p>Both boys had just assumed that the other hated them and just never spoke to them again after that crushing realization. And to be fair, that realization is completely plausible since neither side knew the whole story.</p><p>But Buffy did.</p><p>Despite wanting to spill it all at first, she kept her mouth shut in the beginning as she didn\u2019t want to out either of the two boys. But the further they drifted apart, the closer she came to the conclusion that she had to get involved. She wouldn\u2019t say anything about their sexualities, obviously, but she knew that they had a bond stronger than whatever Kira was attempting to ruin.</p><p>So she got involved.</p><p>Cyrus was not expecting a call from Buffy at 11pm, however they\u2019d had late night conversations before, why would this one be any different than their ramblings about various movies or songs or things that happened during the day?</p><p>Buffy\u2019s voice came through the phone strong and clear, \u201cYou need to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No, there is no way I\u2019m ever talking to him again,\u201d Cyrus scoffed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I did. Knowing what happened and watching you drift apart because of it is literally killing me. You need to talk to him, Cy,\u201d Buffy responded.</p><p>Cyrus was silent for a moment, the only tell that was still on the call was his heavy breathing into the phone. Finally, he replied quietly, almost a whisper, \u201cYou talked to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to, seeing you upset like that.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 reply was almost pained, \u201cWhat did he even say? What could\u2019ve possibly happened?\u201d</p><p>Buffy sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s not for me to tell.\u201d</p><p>The two kids both fell quiet for a moment. Cyrus pinched the bridge of his nose and interrupted the silence with, \u201cI think I\u2019ve just given up on this, I don\u2019t even care what happened. I should, I know, and somewhere in my brain I probably do, but right now, I don\u2019t know&hellip; I just feel empty about this whole situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine, Cy, it\u2019s completely valid for you to be feeling like that. Just, don\u2019t give up on him yet. You guys are too good of a pair to be ruined by some she-devil,\u201d Buffy said.</p><p>\u201cThanks. We\u2019ll see, I guess. I gotta go, bye,\u201d Cyrus replied.</p><p>\u201cBye,\u201d Buffy answered back, ending the call.</p><p>Cyrus set his phone down next to him on his bed and sighed, leaning his head back against the wall. He didn\u2019t have the energy to get up at turn off his lamp in the opposite corner of his room, only enough energy to think about the one boy who had constantly been on his mind since that one fateful Friday.</p><p>He looked out his window and spotted TJ\u2019s house several streets away. He remembered when they would call each other and stand at the window, looking over to one another, pretending to give the eye contact they\u2019d give in a normal face to face conversation. That was gone now, though, all he had was the light in TJ\u2019s own room to look at.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know that TJ was looking over at his house doing the same.</p><p><i>And I am finding out</i></p><p><i>There&rsquo;s just no other way</i></p><p><i>That I&rsquo;m still dancing at the end of the day</i></p><p>Seeing Metcalf kiss his husband on the cheek in the middle of the hallway was the last thing anyone expected to see during school.</p><p>Naturally, word spread fast to those who weren\u2019t around to see it, including TJ.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear what Metcalf did today? It was so gross,\u201d Kira said, taking a seat next to him at the lunch table. She didn\u2019t notice when he scooted away from her the smallest distance.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d TJ replied shortly.</p><p>\u201cHe kissed his husband on the cheek in the middle of the hallway. Why the hell did he think it was okay to be shoving that in our faces? And better yet, why does no one else seem to think it\u2019s gross?\u201d Kira complained, laughing.</p><p>No one thought it was bad? He could\u2019ve been open about it this whole time?</p><p>There really was nothing wrong with him.</p><p>With some newfound confidence, TJ began to stand up and responded, \u201cBecause, Kira, no one else is stuck in the fucking 1900s. First, you make me feel bad about myself for no goddamn reason, and now <i>this</i>? I\u2019m sick of it, and I can\u2019t be around you anymore.\u201d</p><p>TJ walked off, knowing that he could\u2019ve told her off way better than that, but he had more important things on his mind at that moment. More important people.</p><p>After making the smallest detour, he headed over the the GHC\u2019s lunch table, chocolate chocolate chip muffin in hand.</p><p>He watched Cyrus\u2019 eyes grow wide as he approached them, but before he could stand up and leave him behind, he said, \u201cI have a lot of explaining to do, if you\u2019ll let me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank god,\u201d Buffy sighed.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She turned to Cyrus and asked incredulously, \u201cNo? What do you mean no?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus shrugged, looking down at the table. \u201cI meant no. I\u2019m over this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d TJ set the muffin down on the table, a somber look on his face. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll just&hellip; get out of your hair, then.\u201d</p><p>He began to walk away slowly, and Cyrus\u2019 eyes flickered between him and the muffin he left behind. He winced and called out, \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>TJ turned around at the speed of light.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll hear you out.\u201d Cyrus stood up, not making eye contact with anyone on his way out of the cafeteria. As he passed by TJ, he called out, \u201cSwings,\u201d and TJ quickly trailed behind him.</p><p><i>If you leave the light on</i></p><p>TJ took a seat on his usual swing, while Cyrus just stood next to the pole, arms crossed and eyes pointed to the dull mulch.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you ditch me?\u201d Cyrus mumbled. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who asked in the first place.\u201d</p><p>TJ sighed, his knuckles gripping the chains turning a bright white. \u201cThe day before costume day, I was playing basketball in the park. When I was done, Kira came up to me asking if I wanted to do a costume with her. I told her no, I was all set because I was going to do a costume with you, which is true. I was so excited about it, Cy, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how much fun it was going to be,\u201d he began explaining.</p><p>\u201cThat still doesn\u2019t explain why you ditched me, TJ,\u201d Cyrus replied bitterly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not done,\u201d TJ responded, then continued, \u201cShe kept pushing, saying that her costume was this great idea. I kept telling her no, I\u2019m doing this cool inside joke with you. And then she said,\u201d he took a deep breath, \u201c\u2018So you\u2019d rather do a costume with Cyrus than with me? Have fun with that.\u2019 The way she said it, it was like she was implying something, like she figured something out that I wasn\u2019t ready for people to know yet.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus had visibly softened at that, now making eye contact with TJ. It was obvious that he wasn\u2019t trying to push too hard. \u201cWhat&hellip; what did she imply exactly, just so I\u2019ve gotten this all straight?\u201d</p><p>TJ chuckled to himself. <i>None of this was all straight</i>. He took another big sigh and answered, \u201cShe implied that, um, well, that I\u2019m gay. She made me feel so bad about it, like it was wrong. I thought everyone would think the same. Plus, the way she said it, I thought she was going to do something, like out me. So, I took the coward\u2019s way out.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus took a seat next to him, laying his hand on top of TJ\u2019s on the chain of his swing. He reassured him, \u201cHey, you were not being a coward. Sure, some heads up about not doing the costume would\u2019ve been nice, but you were only trying to protect yourself. I know <i>exactly</i> how you feel.\u201d</p><p>TJ smiled softly, looking down at his lap. \u201cThanks.\u201d He then quickly furrowed his eyebrows and said, \u201cWait, what do you mean you know how I feel?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus laughed quietly, \u201cI was <i>not</i> expecting to do this today, but I\u2019m gay too, TJ.\u201d</p><p>A massive grin broke out on TJ\u2019s face. \u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nudged him with his elbow. \u201cYou\u2019re such a dork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly around you,\u201d TJ replied. \u201cSo we\u2019re good now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Cyrus replied, a soft look on his face that could only be described as fond. \u201cWe\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p><i>Then I&rsquo;ll leave the light on</i></p>",

She sat next to Andi in their usual spot in The Spoon, with Cyrus sulking in his seat across from them.</p><p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s nothing to talk to him about. He ditched me for some rude girl, plain and simple. Nothing I can do about it,\u201d Cyrus replied, throwing an uneaten baby tater back in the basket.</p><p>Andi responded, \u201cWhy are you so worked up about this, though? I mean, when the whole gun thing happened, we had to pry you away from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t his fault. I should\u2019ve figured this would happen, I\u2019m always the second choice,\u201d Cyrus mumbled.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Buffy leaned forward and took his hands in hers, much like when he\u2019d came out to her. \u201cYou are never just the second choice, okay? You\u2019re just as important as anyone else. And if TJ chose someone like her over someone as amazing as you, then he never deserved to be friends with you in the first place.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus gave her a small smile. \u201cThanks. And I know, it just hurts, you know? Like, he still chose her over me.\u201d</p><p>Buffy and Andi exchanged a look, leaving Cyrus to question, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing, Cy. It\u2019s weird that he just bailed on you,\u201d Andi replied.</p><p>Buffy added, \u201cYeah, he usually follows you around like a puppy. It just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s why it hurts so much,\u201d Cyrus murmured, leaning back in the booth.</p><p>Buffy squinted then, recognizing the face he was making. The last time he looked like that was when they\u2019d watched Jonah and Andi kiss. \u201cCy?\u201d</p><p>He looked up. \u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you can tell us anything, right?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus sighed. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Buffy asked slowly, \u201cDo you? Want to tell us anything?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus just shook his head, knowing exactly what she was implying.</p><p>\u201cYeah, not gonna lie, I\u2019m lost,\u201d Andi interrupted.</p><p>Buffy put her hand on her shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p><i>Would you hear me out </i></p><p><i>If I told you I was terrified for days?</i></p><p><i>Thought I was gonna break</i></p><p>\u201cKippen!\u201d</p><p>TJ looked up from his phone to see none other than Buffy Driscoll running up to him.</p><p>Buffy almost stopped in her tracks upon seeing how, well, horrible TJ looked. His face was paler than usual, he\u2019d acquired massive eye bags, and his hair was messy, lacking its usual overpowering gel. \u201cWhoa. Um, okay, what the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your business,\u201d TJ mumbled.</p><p>Buffy crossed her arms and sat down next to him. \u201cWhen my best friend is that upset, it automatically becomes my business. Why did you bail on Cyrus?\u201d</p><p>TJ sighed, leaning back in the bench he currently occupied. \u201cIt\u2019s really complicated.\u201d</p><p>Buffy took the seat next to him. \u201cI\u2019ve got time.\u201d</p><p><i>Oh, I couldn\u2019t stop it</i></p><p><i>Tried to slow it all down</i></p><p><i>Crying in the bathroom</i></p><p><i>Had to figure it out</i></p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019d rather to a costume with Cyrus than with me?

I kept telling her no, I\u2019m doing this cool inside joke with you. And then she said,\u201d he took a deep breath, \u201c\u2018So you\u2019d rather do a costume with Cyrus than with me? Have fun with that.\u2019 The way she said it, it was like she was implying something, like she figured something out that I wasn\u2019t ready for people to know yet.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus had visibly softened at that, now making eye contact with TJ. It was obvious that he wasn\u2019t trying to push too hard. \u201cWhat\u2026 what did she imply exactly, just so I\u2019ve gotten this all straight?\u201d</p><p>TJ chuckled to himself. <i>None of this was all straight</i>. He took another big sigh and answered, \u201cShe implied that, um, well, that I\u2019m gay. She made me feel so bad about it, like it was wrong. I thought everyone would think the same.

So, I took the coward\u2019s way out.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus took a seat next to him, laying his hand on top of TJ\u2019s on the chain of his swing.

She sat next to Andi in their usual spot in The Spoon, with Cyrus sulking in his seat across from them.</p><p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s nothing to talk to him about. He ditched me for some rude girl, plain and simple. Nothing I can do about it,\u201d Cyrus replied, throwing an uneaten baby tater back in the basket.</p><p>Andi responded, \u201cWhy are you so worked up about this, though? I mean, when the whole gun thing happened, we had to pry you away from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t his fault. I should\u2019ve figured this would happen, I\u2019m always the second choice,\u201d Cyrus mumbled.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Buffy leaned forward and took his hands in hers, much like when he\u2019d came out to her. \u201cYou are never just the second choice, okay? You\u2019re just as important as anyone else. And if TJ chose someone like her over someone as amazing as you, then he never deserved to be friends with you in the first place.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus gave her a small smile. \u201cThanks. And I know, it just hurts, you know? Like, he still chose her over me.\u201d</p><p>Buffy and Andi exchanged a look, leaving Cyrus to question, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing, Cy. It\u2019s weird that he just bailed on you,\u201d Andi replied.</p><p>Buffy added, \u201cYeah, he usually follows you around like a puppy. It just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s why it hurts so much,\u201d Cyrus murmured, leaning back in the booth.</p><p>Buffy squinted then, recognizing the face he was making. The last time he looked like that was when they\u2019d watched Jonah and Andi kiss. \u201cCy?\u201d</p><p>He looked up. \u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you can tell us anything, right?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus sighed. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Buffy asked slowly, \u201cDo you? Want to tell us anything?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus just shook his head, knowing exactly what she was implying.</p><p>\u201cYeah, not gonna lie, I\u2019m lost,\u201d Andi interrupted.</p><p>Buffy put her hand on her shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p><i>Would you hear me out </i></p><p><i>If I told you I was terrified for days?</i></p><p><i>Thought I was gonna break</i></p><p>\u201cKippen!\u201d</p><p>TJ looked up from his phone to see none other than Buffy Driscoll running up to him.</p><p>Buffy almost stopped in her tracks upon seeing how, well, horrible TJ looked. His face was paler than usual, he\u2019d acquired massive eye bags, and his hair was messy, lacking its usual overpowering gel. \u201cWhoa. Um, okay, what the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your business,\u201d TJ mumbled.</p><p>Buffy crossed her arms and sat down next to him. \u201cWhen my best friend is that upset, it automatically becomes my business. Why did you bail on Cyrus?\u201d</p><p>TJ sighed, leaning back in the bench he currently occupied. \u201cIt\u2019s really complicated.\u201d</p><p>Buffy took the seat next to him. \u201cI\u2019ve got time.\u201d</p><p><i>Oh, I couldn\u2019t stop it</i></p><p><i>Tried to slow it all down</i></p><p><i>Crying in the bathroom</i></p><p><i>Had to figure it out</i></p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019d rather to a costume with Cyrus than with me? Have fun with that.\u201d</p><p>Those words echoed in TJ\u2019s brain since they were first spoken. He thought he had it all covered, that he was being subtle enough that no one would pick up enough but still touchy enough where he could still express how he was feeling. Apparently not. TJ hadn\u2019t even thought about people thinking it was a bad thing, only hiding it because he has a crush on his straight best friend, that\u2019s embarrassing. Was it a bad thing? Would other people think it was a bad thing? Guess so, considering Kira does, or at least implied that she does. What if she told other people about it? What if everyone thought it was wrong? What if\u2014</p><p>And suddenly TJ broke down on the tiles of his bathroom floor in the middle of the night.</p><p>He had no other choice, did he? He had to do the costume with Kira, or else he\u2019d be outcasted even more than he used to be.</p><p>Classic TJ.</p><p><i>With everyone around me saying</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou must be so happy now\u201d</i></p><p>Cyrus watched as yet another person went up to congratulate TJ and Kira, sighing into his math homework.</p><p>Kira had recently announced over Instagram that the two had started dating.</p><p>Buffy was gone from school that day, so it was Andi\u2019s job to do some damage control, meaning constant hugs and reassurance that TJ is and always was a dick.</p><p>\u201cStop watching them, Cy, it\u2019s only going to make you feel worse,\u201d Andi said softly.</p><p>Cyrus replied shortly, \u201cHe stopped trying to text me.\u201d</p><p>Jonah, who sat next to Andi, asked, \u201cWell, isn\u2019t that a good thing then? If he was being such a bad friend to you, shouldn\u2019t you be happy he\u2019s out of your life now?\u201d</p><p><i>I should be</i>, Cyrus thought, <i>but I\u2019m not.</i> \u201cI guess. Something about this just feels so weird.\u201d</p><p>Andi grabbed his hand to console him. \u201cThat\u2019s totally fair, considering you li\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d Cyrus interrupted.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p><i>Oh, if you keep reaching out</i></p><p><i>Then I\u2019ll keep coming back</i></p><p><i>And if you\u2019re gone for good</i></p><p><i>Then I\u2019m okay with that</i></p><p><i>If you leave the light on</i></p><p><i>Then I\u2019ll leave the light on</i></p><p>It had been three and a half weeks since TJ had last tried to reach out to Cyrus.</p><p>Both boys had just assumed that the other hated them and just never spoke to them again after that crushing realization. And to be fair, that realization is completely plausible since neither side knew the whole story.</p><p>But Buffy did.</p><p>Despite wanting to spill it all at first, she kept her mouth shut in the beginning as she didn\u2019t want to out either of the two boys. But the further they drifted apart, the closer she came to the conclusion that she had to get involved. She wouldn\u2019t say anything about their sexualities, obviously, but she knew that they had a bond stronger than whatever Kira was attempting to ruin.</p><p>So she got involved.</p><p>Cyrus was not expecting a call from Buffy at 11pm, however they\u2019d had late night conversations before, why would this one be any different than their ramblings about various movies or songs or things that happened during the day?</p><p>Buffy\u2019s voice came through the phone strong and clear, \u201cYou need to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No, there is no way I\u2019m ever talking to him again,\u201d Cyrus scoffed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I did. Knowing what happened and watching you drift apart because of it is literally killing me. You need to talk to him, Cy,\u201d Buffy responded.</p><p>Cyrus was silent for a moment, the only tell that was still on the call was his heavy breathing into the phone. Finally, he replied quietly, almost a whisper, \u201cYou talked to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to, seeing you upset like that.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 reply was almost pained, \u201cWhat did he even say? What could\u2019ve possibly happened?\u201d</p><p>Buffy sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s not for me to tell.\u201d</p><p>The two kids both fell quiet for a moment. Cyrus pinched the bridge of his nose and interrupted the silence with, \u201cI think I\u2019ve just given up on this, I don\u2019t even care what happened. I should, I know, and somewhere in my brain I probably do, but right now, I don\u2019t know\u2026 I just feel empty about this whole situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine, Cy, it\u2019s completely valid for you to be feeling like that. Just, don\u2019t give up on him yet. You guys are too good of a pair to be ruined by some she-devil,\u201d Buffy said.</p><p>\u201cThanks. We\u2019ll see, I guess. I gotta go, bye,\u201d Cyrus replied.</p><p>\u201cBye,\u201d Buffy answered back, ending the call.</p><p>Cyrus set his phone down next to him on his bed and sighed, leaning his head back against the wall. He didn\u2019t have the energy to get up at turn off his lamp in the opposite corner of his room, only enough energy to think about the one boy who had constantly been on his mind since that one fateful Friday.</p><p>He looked out his window and spotted TJ\u2019s house several streets away. He remembered when they would call each other and stand at the window, looking over to one another, pretending to give the eye contact they\u2019d give in a normal face to face conversation. That was gone now, though, all he had was the light in TJ\u2019s own room to look at.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know that TJ was looking over at his house doing the same.</p><p><i>And I am finding out</i></p><p><i>There\u2019s just no other way</i></p><p><i>That I\u2019m still dancing at the end of the day</i></p><p>Seeing Metcalf kiss his husband on the cheek in the middle of the hallway was the last thing anyone expected to see during school.</p><p>Naturally, word spread fast to those who weren\u2019t around to see it, including TJ.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear what Metcalf did today? It was so gross,\u201d Kira said, taking a seat next to him at the lunch table. She didn\u2019t notice when he scooted away from her the smallest distance.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d TJ replied shortly.</p><p>\u201cHe kissed his husband on the cheek in the middle of the hallway. Why the hell did he think it was okay to be shoving that in our faces? And better yet, why does no one else seem to think it\u2019s gross?\u201d Kira complained, laughing.</p><p>No one thought it was bad? He could\u2019ve been open about it this whole time?</p><p>There really was nothing wrong with him.</p><p>With some newfound confidence, TJ began to stand up and responded, \u201cBecause, Kira, no one else is stuck in the fucking 1900s. First, you make me feel bad about myself for no goddamn reason, and now <i>this</i>? I\u2019m sick of it, and I can\u2019t be around you anymore.\u201d</p><p>TJ walked off, knowing that he could\u2019ve told her off way better than that, but he had more important things on his mind at that moment. More important people.</p><p>After making the smallest detour, he headed over the the GHC\u2019s lunch table, chocolate chocolate chip muffin in hand.</p><p>He watched Cyrus\u2019 eyes grow wide as he approached them, but before he could stand up and leave him behind, he said, \u201cI have a lot of explaining to do, if you\u2019ll let me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank god,\u201d Buffy sighed.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She turned to Cyrus and asked incredulously, \u201cNo? What do you mean no?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus shrugged, looking down at the table. \u201cI meant no. I\u2019m over this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d TJ set the muffin down on the table, a somber look on his face. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll just\u2026 get out of your hair, then.\u201d</p><p>He began to walk away slowly, and Cyrus\u2019 eyes flickered between him and the muffin he left behind. He winced and called out, \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>TJ turned around at the speed of light.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll hear you out.\u201d Cyrus stood up, not making eye contact with anyone on his way out of the cafeteria. As he passed by TJ, he called out, \u201cSwings,\u201d and TJ quickly trailed behind him.</p><p><i>If you leave the light on</i></p><p>TJ took a seat on his usual swing, while Cyrus just stood next to the pole, arms crossed and eyes pointed to the dull mulch.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you ditch me?\u201d Cyrus mumbled. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who asked in the first place.\u201d</p><p>TJ sighed, his knuckles gripping the chains turning a bright white. \u201cThe day before costume day, I was playing basketball in the park. When I was done, Kira came up to me asking if I wanted to do a costume with her. I told her no, I was all set because I was going to do a costume with you, which is true. I was so excited about it, Cy, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how much fun it was going to be,\u201d he began explaining.</p><p>\u201cThat still doesn\u2019t explain why you ditched me, TJ,\u201d Cyrus replied bitterly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not done,\u201d TJ responded, then continued, \u201cShe kept pushing, saying that her costume was this great idea. I kept telling her no, I\u2019m doing this cool inside joke with you. And then she said,\u201d he took a deep breath, \u201c\u2018So you\u2019d rather do a costume with Cyrus than with me?

It was obvious that he wasn\u2019t trying to push too hard. \u201cWhat\u2026 what did she imply exactly, just so I\u2019ve gotten this all straight?\u201d</p><p>TJ chuckled to himself. <i>None of this was all straight</i>. He took another big sigh and answered, \u201cShe implied that, um, well, that I\u2019m gay. She made me feel so bad about it, like it was wrong. I thought everyone would think the same. Plus, the way she said it, I thought she was going to do something, like out me. So, I took the coward\u2019s way out.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus took a seat next to him, laying his hand on top of TJ\u2019s on the chain of his swing. He reassured him, \u201cHey, you were not being a coward. Sure, some heads up about not doing the costume would\u2019ve been nice, but you were only trying to protect yourself.

Want to tell us anything?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus just shook his head, knowing exactly what she was implying.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, not gonna lie, I&rsquo;m lost,&rdquo; Andi interrupted.</p><p>Buffy put her hand on her shoulder. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Would you hear me out </i></p><p><i>If I told you I was terrified for days?</i></p><p><i>Thought I was gonna break</i></p><p>&ldquo;Kippen!&rdquo;</p><p>TJ looked up from his phone to see none other than Buffy Driscoll running up to him.</p><p>Buffy almost stopped in her tracks upon seeing how, well, horrible TJ looked. His face was paler than usual, he&rsquo;d acquired massive eye bags, and his hair was messy, lacking its usual overpowering gel. &ldquo;Whoa. Um, okay, what the hell happened?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;None of your business,&rdquo; TJ mumbled.</p><p>Buffy crossed her arms and sat down next to him. &ldquo;When my best friend is that upset, it automatically becomes my business. Why did you bail on Cyrus?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ sighed, leaning back in the bench he currently occupied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really complicated.&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy took the seat next to him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got time.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t stop it</i></p><p><i>Tried to slow it all down</i></p><p><i>Crying in the bathroom</i></p><p><i>Had to figure it out</i></p><p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;d rather to a costume with Cyrus than with me? Have fun with that.&rdquo;</p><p>Those words echoed in TJ&rsquo;s brain since they were first spoken. He thought he had it all covered, that he was being subtle enough that no one would pick up enough but still touchy enough where he could still express how he was feeling. Apparently not. TJ hadn&rsquo;t even thought about people thinking it was a bad thing, only hiding it because he has a crush on his straight best friend, that&rsquo;s embarrassing. Was it a bad thing? Would other people think it was a bad thing? Guess so, considering Kira does, or at least implied that she does. What if she told other people about it? What if everyone thought it was wrong? What if&mdash;</p><p>And suddenly TJ broke down on the tiles of his bathroom floor in the middle of the night.</p><p>He had no other choice, did he? He had to do the costume with Kira, or else he&rsquo;d be outcasted even more than he used to be.</p><p>Classic TJ.</p><p><i>With everyone around me saying</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You must be so happy now&rdquo;</i></p><p>Cyrus watched as yet another person went up to congratulate TJ and Kira, sighing into his math homework.</p><p>Kira had recently announced over Instagram that the two had started dating.</p><p>Buffy was gone from school that day, so it was Andi&rsquo;s job to do some damage control, meaning constant hugs and reassurance that TJ is and always was a dick.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop watching them, Cy, it&rsquo;s only going to make you feel worse,&rdquo; Andi said softly.</p><p>Cyrus replied shortly, &ldquo;He stopped trying to text me.&rdquo;</p><p>Jonah, who sat next to Andi, asked, &ldquo;Well, isn&rsquo;t that a good thing then? If he was being such a bad friend to you, shouldn&rsquo;t you be happy he&rsquo;s out of your life now?&rdquo;</p><p><i>I should be</i>, Cyrus thought, <i>but I&rsquo;m not.</i> &ldquo;I guess. Something about this just feels so weird.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi grabbed his hand to console him. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s totally fair, considering you li&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Cyrus interrupted.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Oh, if you keep reaching out</i></p><p><i>Then I&rsquo;ll keep coming back</i></p><p><i>And if you&rsquo;re gone for good</i></p><p><i>Then I&rsquo;m okay with that</i></p><p><i>If you leave the light on</i></p><p><i>Then I&rsquo;ll leave the light on</i></p><p>It had been three and a half weeks since TJ had last tried to reach out to Cyrus.</p><p>Both boys had just assumed that the other hated them and just never spoke to them again after that crushing realization. And to be fair, that realization is completely plausible since neither side knew the whole story.</p><p>But Buffy did.</p><p>Despite wanting to spill it all at first, she kept her mouth shut in the beginning as she didn&rsquo;t want to out either of the two boys. But the further they drifted apart, the closer she came to the conclusion that she had to get involved. She wouldn&rsquo;t say anything about their sexualities, obviously, but she knew that they had a bond stronger than whatever Kira was attempting to ruin.</p><p>So she got involved.</p><p>Cyrus was not expecting a call from Buffy at 11pm, however they&rsquo;d had late night conversations before, why would this one be any different than their ramblings about various movies or songs or things that happened during the day?</p><p>Buffy&rsquo;s voice came through the phone strong and clear, &ldquo;You need to talk to him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? No, there is no way I&rsquo;m ever talking to him again,&rdquo; Cyrus scoffed.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but I did. Knowing what happened and watching you drift apart because of it is literally killing me. You need to talk to him, Cy,&rdquo; Buffy responded.</p><p>Cyrus was silent for a moment, the only tell that was still on the call was his heavy breathing into the phone. Finally, he replied quietly, almost a whisper, &ldquo;You talked to him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I had to, seeing you upset like that.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus&rsquo; reply was almost pained, &ldquo;What did he even say? What could&rsquo;ve possibly happened?&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy sighed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not for me to tell.&rdquo;</p><p>The two kids both fell quiet for a moment. Cyrus pinched the bridge of his nose and interrupted the silence with, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve just given up on this, I don&rsquo;t even care what happened. I should, I know, and somewhere in my brain I probably do, but right now, I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; I just feel empty about this whole situation.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine, Cy, it&rsquo;s completely valid for you to be feeling like that. Just, don&rsquo;t give up on him yet. You guys are too good of a pair to be ruined by some she-devil,&rdquo; Buffy said.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks. We&rsquo;ll see, I guess. I gotta go, bye,&rdquo; Cyrus replied.</p><p>&ldquo;Bye,&rdquo; Buffy answered back, ending the call.</p><p>Cyrus set his phone down next to him on his bed and sighed, leaning his head back against the wall. He didn&rsquo;t have the energy to get up at turn off his lamp in the opposite corner of his room, only enough energy to think about the one boy who had constantly been on his mind since that one fateful Friday.</p><p>He looked out his window and spotted TJ&rsquo;s house several streets away. He remembered when they would call each other and stand at the window, looking over to one another, pretending to give the eye contact they&rsquo;d give in a normal face to face conversation. That was gone now, though, all he had was the light in TJ&rsquo;s own room to look at.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t know that TJ was looking over at his house doing the same.</p><p><i>And I am finding out</i></p><p><i>There&rsquo;s just no other way</i></p><p><i>That I&rsquo;m still dancing at the end of the day</i></p><p>Seeing Metcalf kiss his husband on the cheek in the middle of the hallway was the last thing anyone expected to see during school.</p><p>Naturally, word spread fast to those who weren&rsquo;t around to see it, including TJ.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you hear what Metcalf did today? It was so gross,&rdquo; Kira said, taking a seat next to him at the lunch table. She didn&rsquo;t notice when he scooted away from her the smallest distance.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; TJ replied shortly.</p><p>&ldquo;He kissed his husband on the cheek in the middle of the hallway. Why the hell did he think it was okay to be shoving that in our faces? And better yet, why does no one else seem to think it&rsquo;s gross?&rdquo; Kira complained, laughing.</p><p>No one thought it was bad? He could&rsquo;ve been open about it this whole time?</p><p>There really was nothing wrong with him.</p><p>With some newfound confidence, TJ began to stand up and responded, &ldquo;Because, Kira, no one else is stuck in the fucking 1900s. First, you make me feel bad about myself for no goddamn reason, and now <i>this</i>? I&rsquo;m sick of it, and I can&rsquo;t be around you anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ walked off, knowing that he could&rsquo;ve told her off way better than that, but he had more important things on his mind at that moment. More important people.</p><p>After making the smallest detour, he headed over the the GHC&rsquo;s lunch table, chocolate chocolate chip muffin in hand.</p><p>He watched Cyrus&rsquo; eyes grow wide as he approached them, but before he could stand up and leave him behind, he said, &ldquo;I have a lot of explaining to do, if you&rsquo;ll let me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, thank god,&rdquo; Buffy sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>She turned to Cyrus and asked incredulously, &ldquo;No? What do you mean no?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus shrugged, looking down at the table. &ldquo;I meant no. I&rsquo;m over this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; TJ set the muffin down on the table, a somber look on his face. &ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll just&hellip; get out of your hair, then.&rdquo;</p><p>He began to walk away slowly, and Cyrus&rsquo; eyes flickered between him and the muffin he left behind. He winced and called out, &ldquo;Wait.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ turned around at the speed of light.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine. I&rsquo;ll hear you out.&rdquo; Cyrus stood up, not making eye contact with anyone on his way out of the cafeteria. As he passed by TJ, he called out, &ldquo;Swings,&rdquo; and TJ quickly trailed behind him.</p><p><i>If you leave the light on</i></p><p>TJ took a seat on his usual swing, while Cyrus just stood next to the pole, arms crossed and eyes pointed to the dull mulch.</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you ditch me?&rdquo; Cyrus mumbled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one who asked in the first place.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ sighed, his knuckles gripping the chains turning a bright white. &ldquo;The day before costume day, I was playing basketball in the park. When I was done, Kira came up to me asking if I wanted to do a costume with her. I told her no, I was all set because I was going to do a costume with you, which is true. I was so excited about it, Cy, I couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about how much fun it was going to be,&rdquo; he began explaining.</p><p>&ldquo;That still doesn&rsquo;t explain why you ditched me, TJ,&rdquo; Cyrus replied bitterly.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not done,&rdquo; TJ responded, then continued, &ldquo;She kept pushing, saying that her costume was this great idea. I kept telling her no, I&rsquo;m doing this cool inside joke with you. And then she said,&rdquo; he took a deep breath, &ldquo;&lsquo;So you&rsquo;d rather do a costume with Cyrus than with me? Have fun with that.&rsquo; The way she said it, it was like she was implying something, like she figured something out that I wasn&rsquo;t ready for people to know yet.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus had visibly softened at that, now making eye contact with TJ. It was obvious that he wasn&rsquo;t trying to push too hard. &ldquo;What&hellip; what did she imply exactly, just so I&rsquo;ve gotten this all straight?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ chuckled to himself. <i>None of this was all straight</i>. He took another big sigh and answered, &ldquo;She implied that, um, well, that I&rsquo;m gay. She made me feel so bad about it, like it was wrong. I thought everyone would think the same. Plus, the way she said it, I thought she was going to do something, like out me. So, I took the coward&rsquo;s way out.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus took a seat next to him, laying his hand on top of TJ&rsquo;s on the chain of his swing. He reassured him, &ldquo;Hey, you were not being a coward. Sure, some heads up about not doing the costume would&rsquo;ve been nice, but you were only trying to protect yourself. I know <i>exactly</i> how you feel.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ smiled softly, looking down at his lap. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; He then quickly furrowed his eyebrows and said, &ldquo;Wait, what do you mean you know how I feel?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus laughed quietly, &ldquo;I was <i>not</i> expecting to do this today, but I&rsquo;m gay too, TJ.&rdquo;</p><p>A massive grin broke out on TJ&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Cool.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus nudged him with his elbow. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a dork.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Only around you,&rdquo; TJ replied. &ldquo;So we&rsquo;re good now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Cyrus replied, a soft look on his face that could only be described as fond. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re good.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Then I&rsquo;ll leave the light on</i></p></p>",

So what will happen when TJ walks into the store one day? Inspired by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwYTvHgH3M6/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=15jnwd0snnax0\">this</a> Instagram post</i></p><p><b>Words: </b>2967</p><!-- more --><p>Ever since his parents opened their bakery in town, Cyrus\nhas never failed to find comfort in the store. The smell, the homely ambience,\nall of it never failed to centre and ground him. It was one of the only places\nwhere he felt truly calm. So, whenever his mom said they needed help, Cyrus\njumped at the chance, practically pouncing at every opportunity to be amidst\nthe smell of vanilla, chocolate, caramel and bread.</p><p>It was one of those days, and luckily the day was also\nslower compared to others, allowing Cyrus a chance to take a break from\nchatting to all the customers that walked through the door. Not that he didn\u2019t\nlike talking to them, he loved hearing people\u2019s stories. It just got exhausting\nafter a couple hours. </p><p>After talking to the lovely lady who wanted some eclairs,\nCyrus wiped his forehead with the back of his hand, smearing the flour over it.\nHe didn\u2019t really care. It wasn\u2019t like anyone was going to care about his\nappearance. He was just the boy who ran the till and took their orders for\nbaked goods. No one would care about his appearance.</p><p>Okay, maybe he was spending too much time trying to rearrange\nthe cupcakes on the display, because he heard a soft cough, trying to draw his\nattention. Cyrus sighed, looking up over the counter.</p><p>\u201cSorry for that. How may I\u2026\u201d Cyrus said, stopping short when\nhe noticed who it was, and suddenly regretting his harried appearance. </p><p>TJ Kippen. Basketball captain. Only the guy Cyrus had been\nhopelessly crushing on from the safety of his locker and his desk in the class.\nThey had only spoken a few times before, running into each other every now and\nthen because Buffy and he played on the same basketball team. Each time they\nspoke, Cyrus was somehow more and more of a goner. And now here he was. In\nfront of him. While Cyrus\u2019 hair was a godawful mess, and there was flour all over\nhis face. <i>Oh. God.</i></p><p>\u201cI- Um,\u201d Cyrus stuttered, trying to fix his hair and wipe\noff the flour of his face, while simultaneously trying to relax and seem casual.\n<i>Just be cool, Cyrus. Cool as a cucumber. A cucumber that was now in an oven.</i></p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d TJ said, his voice soft, as he stuffed his hands into\nthe pockets of his sweatpants, balancing on the balls of his feet. \u201cCyrus,\nright?\u201d <i>He looked so cute,</i> Cyrus thought to himself unhelpfully, as he\ndesperately tried to find his voice. </p><p>\u201cUm, hey. How can I help you today?\u201d Cyrus said, resting one\nhand on the counter, the other on his waist as he tried to seem at ease. Not\nvery easy when one\u2019s heart is practically racing at a million miles an hour. </p><p>\u201cUh, my mom called in to order some bread. Wait,\u201d TJ said,\nreaching into his pocket, pulling out a piece of paper. \u201cHere\u2019s the name,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m not very good with names.\u201d</p><p>As TJ handed Cyrus the slip of paper, their fingers brushed\nslightly, an occurrence that sent Cyrus\u2019 heart soaring and his head spinning. The\ntwo looked at each other in surprise, blushes creeping onto their faces and TJ\nlaughed nervously.</p><p>\u201cJust one second, I\u2019ll check if it\u2019s ready,\u201d Cyrus said, revelling\nin the distraction. He took the few moments he had while turned away from TJ to\nsteady his breathing. <i>He needed to get it together, </i>Cyrus thought to himself,\nscolding his heart for betraying his trust by still racing. </p><p><i>But he\u2019s wearing glasses and his hair is fluffy, how does\none remain calm,</i> his heart arguing back, much to Cyrus\u2019 chagrin. Sighing,\nresigning himself to his inevitable doom, Cyrus turned back to TJ with a shy\nsmile, grabbing the carefully packed parcel that his mother had kept aside.</p><p>\u201cHere you go, freshly baked,\u201d Cyrus said handing over the\nparcel, ignoring the fluttering feeling in his heart when their fingers brushed\nagainst each other again. TJ smiled at Cyrus, gasping as he took hold of the\nbread.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, it\u2019s hot!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hot too,\u201d Cyrus mumbled unknowingly. As soon as he\nrealised what he had said, he slapped a hand across his mouth, his eyes wide.\nTJ was looking at him, his eyebrows quirked, a soft smirk on his face. </p><p>\u201cOh my god, I- I am so sorry, I don\u2019t know why,\u201d Cyrus\nfumbled, desperately trying to take back what he said, his face growing warmer\nand warmer with every passing second. </p><p>TJ just softly laughed, reaching over the counter to grab\nCyrus\u2019 hand, quieting him. \u201cHey, it\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t worry about it. Good to know you\nfind me hot,\u201d he said, winking at Cyrus.</p><p><i>Death would be a welcome release right now,</i> Cyrus\nthought to himself, as he gulped nervously. They stared each other in the eye for\na moment, the tension in the air building more and more. Just then, the door opened,\na bell chiming, causing the two to snap out of their trance. Cyrus coughed, trying\nto play cool. </p><p>\u201cYeah, um. Thanks for coming by. Nice to talk to you,\u201d Cyrus\nsaid, holding out his hand for a handshake. <i>Casual, casual. Just two bros\nshaking hands.</i></p><p>TJ just giggled slightly, returning the handshake. \u201cNice to talk\nto you too, Cyrus. Who knew that when I just came down for bread, I would end\nup running into a really cute guy?\u201d he said, his cheeks pink. He winked at\nCyrus while leaving the money on the counter, walking out of the store. Before he\nwalked out of the door, TJ looked back at Cyrus, a soft smile on his face that\nsent Cyrus\u2019 already racing heart into a complicated and elaborate dance routine.\nWith a great amount of difficulty, Cyrus managed to give a small smile back, raising\nhis hand for a small wave.</p><p>After TJ had left, Cyrus looked around, thankful that there weren\u2019t\nmany people around. He called to his mom that he was taking a break, and walked\nout of the store, sinking against the wall outside.</p><p>That was a hell of an experience.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cAnd we spent 3 hours just in Andi Shack making bracelets. That\nshouldn\u2019t be interesting, but it was?\u201d Andi said as she shut the door of her\nlocker. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t understand anything. What do you guys think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that means, now I\u2019m just spitballing here, but I think\nmaybe, just maybe. You like Amber,\u201d Buffy said.</p><p>Andi just glared at Buffy, unimpressed. \u201cGee, thanks. What\ndo you think, Cyrus?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus, who had been lost in thought all the while, was startled\nout of his dream world. \u201cHuh? What?\u201d</p><p>Buffy furrowed her eyebrows, confused at Cyrus\u2019 spaciness.</p><p>\u201cCyrus, did you hear anything I just said?\u201d Andi asked,\nnarrowing her eyes.</p><p>Cyrus looked at his two friends, sighing. \u201cSorry, Andi. I\njust, I spaced out. But you should tell Amber you like her. That\u2019s all I got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, what? I can\u2019t do that!\u201d Andi said incredulously. \u201cWhat\nif she doesn\u2019t feel the same? What if she doesn\u2019t like girls? What if she hates\nme, Cyrus. What do I do then?\u201d she said, grabbing Cyrus\u2019 shoulders and shaking\nthem.</p><p>Cyrus just laughed, covering Andi\u2019s hands with his. \u201cIt\u2019ll\nbe fine, Andi. Believe me, you\u2019ll feel better telling her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays the guy who is harbouring the biggest silent crush on\nTJ,\u201d Buffy said, smirking.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Cyrus said, turning away from his friends. \u201cAbout\nthat\u2026\u201d</p><p>The two girls stopped, Buffy sticking a hand out in front of\nCyrus to stop him from walking away. </p><p>\u201cCyrus, spill,\u201d Buffy said firmly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, come on. There are still 10 minutes for the bell to\nring,\u201d Andi added.</p><p>Groaning at the embarrassment and questions to come, Cyrus\nrelayed all the events that had occurred in the bakery on the day Cyrus\u2019 soul\nascended and left his body. As he spoke, he could see the two girls get visibly\nmore excited, Andi practically smiling to the high heavens. Buffy\u2019s eyes were\nfilled with glee and excitement, and Cyrus could practically see her gears\nturning as she thought up more ways to tease Cyrus. <i>This was the worst idea\nhe had ever had.</i></p><p>When he was done, Buffy said with a smirk, \u201cOoh, so you and\nTJ? When\u2019s the wedding? I expect an invitation tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuffy!\u201d Cyrus whisper-yelled, looking around them as the hallway was clearing out. </p><p>\u201cMe too, Cyrus. Also, which one of us is your maid of\nhonour? You have many important decisions to make,\u201d Andi added with a teasing\nsmile.</p><p>\u201cGuys,\u201d Cyrus whined. \u201cNothing\u2019s happening. It was just a\nfreak incident. Doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Buffy said, raising her eyebrows. \u201cIt\nalso wouldn\u2019t mean anything to you if I told you that for the past couple\nmonths, TJ has been gushing about you all through basketball practice, would\nit?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus stopped dead in his tracks, his thoughts in a whirl. <i>Could\nit be..? Nope. No. Do not entertain that thought.</i> He coughed, keeping his\neyes focused ahead. \u201cNope. Doesn\u2019t matter to me. Nuh-uh.\u201d</p><p>He walked away in the direction of his class, ignoring Andi\nand Buffy\u2019s laughs as he left. Of course, he still loved them, but they did\nseem to always suggest what he was too scared to believe, and sometimes it got\ntoo much for him.</p><p>He was so in his thoughts, that he wasn\u2019t even aware of his\nsurroundings, until he walked right into another person.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Cyrus mumbled, nearly stumbling\nover his feet. Luckily, whoever it was seemed to catch hold of him. He didn\u2019t know\nwho it was who he had nearly bulldozed over. That is until he heard a very\nfamiliar chuckle.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Cyrus. I don\u2019t mind,\u201d said TJ, his arms resting\non Cyrus\u2019 elbows, loosely holding onto them. </p><p>\u201cOh, um. Hey TJ,\u201d Cyrus said, shaking his head slightly as\nif that would help clear his mind. Realising how close he was to TJ at that\npoint, he immediately tried to disentangle himself, trying to put some space\nbetween, them. Not that he wanted to, but he knew that he had close to no\nchance with TJ, so might as well not let his heart die more.</p><p>As he moved away, Cyrus thought he saw disappointment\nflicker through TJ\u2019s eyes, but it was quickly replaced by his characteristic\nsoft smirk. Cyrus gulped nervously, aware of the growing tension in the air. </p><p>\u201cSo, h-how was the bread?\u201d Cyrus asked, silently facepalming\nhimself. <i>\u2018How was the bread?\u2019 He just shouldn\u2019t be allowed to speak.</i></p><p>Thankfully, TJ gave a small laugh, running a hand through\nhis hair. \u201cIt was really good. Best I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood good. That\u2019s good,\u201d Cyrus mumbled, pulling at the hem\nof his shirt with the hand that wasn\u2019t currently clutching his bag strap. They\nstood there in the now-empty hallway in silence, Cyrus eventually looking up at\nTJ, who was eyeing him with an expression that was unreadable. Then, Cyrus felt\nhimself take a small step toward TJ, prompted by something inside him,\nsomething that wanted to do nothing more than to get closer to the boy standing\nin front of him. TJ looked back at Cyrus, tilting his head slightly, a mix of\ncuriosity and uncertainty in his eyes. </p><p>\u201cI need to tell you something, Cyrus,\u201d TJ whispered, his\nglance flitting down before returning to meet Cyrus\u2019 eyes.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Cyrus whispered back. <i>They were so close.</i></p><p>\u201cI,\u201d TJ started, but before he could say anything, the shrill\nsound of the school bell rang through the school halls, causing the two to jump\naway, a blush covering Cyrus\u2019 cheeks as he realised what he had been doing. </p><p>\u201cI, I should go,\u201d Cyrus mumbled, walking to class, his head\nlooking down as he walked past TJ.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah me too. See you around,\u201d TJ replied, equally\nflustered as he walked in the opposite direction, looking back at Cyrus as he\nwalked away.</p><p>A few seconds later, Cyrus turned around, catching one last\nglimpse of TJ before he walked to Math.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cGuys, I really don\u2019t think anything happened, or is going\nto happen. Maybe he got weirded out by me and that\u2019s what he was going to tell\nme,\u201d Cyrus said as he wiped down the counter. Across from him on the other\nside, Buffy and Andi were standing by the display, looking at Cyrus with a\ncombination of disbelief and reassurance.</p><p>\u201cCyrus, no offence, but you are blind,\u201d Buffy said, raising\nher eyebrows. \u201cThe boy is always staring at you when you have classes together,\nand he somehow is always near your locker when you need some help. Plus, let\u2019s\nnot forget. He literally never shuts up about you during practice, it\u2019s\nannoying.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus just sighed, rearranging the cakes on show. <i>Buffy\nhad to be mistaken. He was just Cyrus, there was no way a guy like TJ Kippen could\nlike him.</i></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Buffy,\u201d Cyrus said, looking up at his friend.\n</p><p>\u201cCyrus!\u201d Buffy exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, it\u2019s staring you in the face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I have to agree with Buffy here. Even Amber tells me\nthat TJ talks about you all the time. It\u2019s really obvious,\u201d Andi chimed in.</p><p>Cyrus just raised one eyebrow, looking back and forth\nbetween his two friends. \u201cGuys, you don\u2019t get it. TJ is out of my league. Like\nway out. Like, he\u2019s the popular basketball player and I\u2019m the boy working in a\nbakery!\u201d</p><p>Buffy just rolled her eyes, walking away from the counter,\nraising her hands. \u201cI give up. I no longer feel the will to go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus, just talk to him,\u201d Andi said, reaching over to\nsqueeze Cyrus\u2019 hand before walking out of the store with Buffy.</p><p>Cyrus just stood there for a while, his thoughts moving fast.\nOn one hand, the girls made sense, maybe he should try talking to TJ. But on\nthe other hand, Cyrus was very much aware of the fact that TJ was an athlete, a\ncaptain, someone everyone loved. And Cyrus was just a kid who no one really\nbothered with. He wasn\u2019t unpopular, it\u2019s just that he was unnoticed. And he was\nokay with that.</p><p>Closing his eyes, Cyrus willed himself to focus on work. He\ntook a deep breath and told himself, <i>just deal with the customers and not\nthink about TJ.</i></p><p>Well that went about as well as one could expect. Because as\nsoon as Cyrus opened his eyes, the door opened to the chime of a bell, and in\nwalked none other than the root of all of Cyrus\u2019 problems: TJ.</p><p>Cyrus tried to keep a friendly, neutral expression as he saw\nTJ approach. All the while, he could practically hear his heart going <i>ba-boom\nba-boom ba-boom.</i> </p><p><i>Crap.</i></p><p>\u201cHi TJ, what can I do for you today?\u201d Cyrus said, trying to\nkeep his voice steady, unlike his mind.</p><p>TJ had a smirk on his face, but he was tugging at his\nsleeves nervously. \u201cI wanted to order a cake. Chocolate chocolate chip?\u201d</p><p><i>Doesn\u2019t mean anything that TJ was ordering a cake of his\nfavourite flavour. Nope. No.</i></p><p>Cyrus smiled, noting the order down on a little notepad that\nno one else used except him. His mom would often laugh in good nature at how\nCyrus would note down every detail that was said to him. He looked back up at\nTJ, putting the pencil behind his ear. \u201cDo you want a message written on the\ncake?\u201d</p><p>For the first time, TJ looked hesitant, scratching his earlobe\nand biting his lip slightly. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, shoot.\u201d</p><p>TJ took a deep breath and looked Cyrus right in the eyes. \u201cCyrus,\nI have had the biggest crush on you since 7<sup>th</sup> grade. Will you go out\nwith me?\u201d</p><p>Time may as well have stopped, with the way Cyrus just\nstared back at TJ, disbelief clouding his thoughts. TJ looked back at Cyrus\nexpectantly, stuffing his hands into his hoodie pockets as he balanced on the\nballs of his foot, waiting for Cyrus to respond.</p><p>After what seemed like forever, Cyrus coughed, clearing his\nthroat. \u201cAnd what occasion is the cake for?\u201d he asked, as he moved to write in\nhis notepad. </p><p>As soon as he said that, he swore he heard Buffy yell, \u201cOh\nyou have got to be kidding,\u201d before her voice became muffled. TJ groaned, hitting\nhis head on the counter in front of him. He looked back up at Cyrus, who looked\non in confusion. </p><p>Suddenly, TJ vaulted himself over the counter, standing\ndirectly in front of Cyrus. Their chests were touching, their faces close.\nCyrus felt his breath hitch, dropping his pencil onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cYou really are oblivious, Cyrus Goodman,\u201d TJ whispered,\nwrapping his arms around Cyrus\u2019 waist.</p><p>Cyrus could no longer feel individual heartbeats, it was all\na hum, that\u2019s how fast it felt. Before he could overthink any of it, he cupped\nTJ\u2019s cheeks and pulled him in for a kiss. </p><p>It was magical. The smell of the chocolate and vanilla from\nthe bakery mixed with the smell of TJ\u2019s cologne was sending Cyrus\u2019 mind in a\nwhirl. He wrapped his arms around TJ\u2019s neck and TJ tightened his arms around\nCyrus\u2019 waist, pulling each other impossibly closer. It felt like forever before\nthey pulled away, yet somehow it was still too short for Cyrus. When they\npulled away, Cyrus rested his head against TJ\u2019s, feeling out of breath. His\nbrain had just finished processing what had happened.</p><p><i>TJ liked him. TJ asked him out. He kissed TJ.</i></p><p>\u201cSo? What\u2019s your answer?\u201d TJ asked in a whisper, a soft\nsmile on his face, his cheeks pink.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d Cyrus replied cheekily.</p><p>TJ raised his eyebrows, amused. Cyrus let out a small giggle,\nkissing the tip of TJ\u2019s nose. </p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>~~~~</p><p><b>so this idea came about when sarah and i were having our usual crackhead conversations and i found this post on instagram and the gears began turning.

The smell, the homely ambience,\nall of it never failed to centre and ground him. It was one of the only places\nwhere he felt truly calm. So, whenever his mom said they needed help, Cyrus\njumped at the chance, practically pouncing at every opportunity to be amidst\nthe smell of vanilla, chocolate, caramel and bread.</p><p>It was one of those days, and luckily the day was also\nslower compared to others, allowing Cyrus a chance to take a break from\nchatting to all the customers that walked through the door. Not that he didn\u2019t\nlike talking to them, he loved hearing people\u2019s stories. It just got exhausting\nafter a couple hours. </p><p>After talking to the lovely lady who wanted some eclairs,\nCyrus wiped his forehead with the back of his hand, smearing the flour over it.\nHe didn\u2019t really care. It wasn\u2019t like anyone was going to care about his\nappearance. He was just the boy who ran the till and took their orders for\nbaked goods. No one would care about his appearance.</p><p>Okay, maybe he was spending too much time trying to rearrange\nthe cupcakes on the display, because he heard a soft cough, trying to draw his\nattention. Cyrus sighed, looking up over the counter.</p><p>\u201cSorry for that. How may I\u2026\u201d Cyrus said, stopping short when\nhe noticed who it was, and suddenly regretting his harried appearance. </p><p>TJ Kippen. Basketball captain. Only the guy Cyrus had been\nhopelessly crushing on from the safety of his locker and his desk in the class.\nThey had only spoken a few times before, running into each other every now and\nthen because Buffy and he played on the same basketball team. Each time they\nspoke, Cyrus was somehow more and more of a goner. And now here he was. In\nfront of him. While Cyrus\u2019 hair was a godawful mess, and there was flour all over\nhis face. <i>Oh.

Cool as a cucumber. A cucumber that was now in an oven.</i></p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d TJ said, his voice soft, as he stuffed his hands into\nthe pockets of his sweatpants, balancing on the balls of his feet. \u201cCyrus,\nright?\u201d <i>He looked so cute,</i> Cyrus thought to himself unhelpfully, as he\ndesperately tried to find his voice. </p><p>\u201cUm, hey. How can I help you today?\u201d Cyrus said, resting one\nhand on the counter, the other on his waist as he tried to seem at ease. Not\nvery easy when one\u2019s heart is practically racing at a million miles an hour. </p><p>\u201cUh, my mom called in to order some bread. Wait,\u201d TJ said,\nreaching into his pocket, pulling out a piece of paper. \u201cHere\u2019s the name,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m not very good with names.\u201d</p><p>As TJ handed Cyrus the slip of paper, their fingers brushed\nslightly, an occurrence that sent Cyrus\u2019 heart soaring and his head spinning. The\ntwo looked at each other in surprise, blushes creeping onto their faces and TJ\nlaughed nervously.</p><p>\u201cJust one second, I\u2019ll check if it\u2019s ready,\u201d Cyrus said, revelling\nin the distraction. He took the few moments he had while turned away from TJ to\nsteady his breathing. <i>He needed to get it together, </i>Cyrus thought to himself,\nscolding his heart for betraying his trust by still racing. </p><p><i>But he\u2019s wearing glasses and his hair is fluffy, how does\none remain calm,</i> his heart arguing back, much to Cyrus\u2019 chagrin.

As soon as he\nrealised what he had said, he slapped a hand across his mouth, his eyes wide.\nTJ was looking at him, his eyebrows quirked, a soft smirk on his face. </p><p>\u201cOh my god, I- I am so sorry, I don\u2019t know why,\u201d Cyrus\nfumbled, desperately trying to take back what he said, his face growing warmer\nand warmer with every passing second. </p><p>TJ just softly laughed, reaching over the counter to grab\nCyrus\u2019 hand, quieting him. \u201cHey, it\u2019s okay.

They stared each other in the eye for\na moment, the tension in the air building more and more. Just then, the door opened,\na bell chiming, causing the two to snap out of their trance. Cyrus coughed, trying\nto play cool. </p><p>\u201cYeah, um. Thanks for coming by. Nice to talk to you,\u201d Cyrus\nsaid, holding out his hand for a handshake. <i>Casual, casual.

Who knew that when I just came down for bread, I would end\nup running into a really cute guy?\u201d he said, his cheeks pink. He winked at\nCyrus while leaving the money on the counter, walking out of the store. Before he\nwalked out of the door, TJ looked back at Cyrus, a soft smile on his face that\nsent Cyrus\u2019 already racing heart into a complicated and elaborate dance routine.\nWith a great amount of difficulty, Cyrus managed to give a small smile back, raising\nhis hand for a small wave.</p><p>After TJ had left, Cyrus looked around, thankful that there weren\u2019t\nmany people around.

I can\u2019t do that!\u201d Andi said incredulously. \u201cWhat\nif she doesn\u2019t feel the same? What if she doesn\u2019t like girls? What if she hates\nme, Cyrus. What do I do then?\u201d she said, grabbing Cyrus\u2019 shoulders and shaking\nthem.</p><p>Cyrus just laughed, covering Andi\u2019s hands with his. \u201cIt\u2019ll\nbe fine, Andi. Believe me, you\u2019ll feel better telling her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays the guy who is harbouring the biggest silent crush on\nTJ,\u201d Buffy said, smirking.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Cyrus said, turning away from his friends. \u201cAbout\nthat\u2026\u201d</p><p>The two girls stopped, Buffy sticking a hand out in front of\nCyrus to stop him from walking away. </p><p>\u201cCyrus, spill,\u201d Buffy said firmly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, come on. There are still 10 minutes for the bell to\nring,\u201d Andi added.</p><p>Groaning at the embarrassment and questions to come, Cyrus\nrelayed all the events that had occurred in the bakery on the day Cyrus\u2019 soul\nascended and left his body. As he spoke, he could see the two girls get visibly\nmore excited, Andi practically smiling to the high heavens. Buffy\u2019s eyes were\nfilled with glee and excitement, and Cyrus could practically see her gears\nturning as she thought up more ways to tease Cyrus. <i>This was the worst idea\nhe had ever had.</i></p><p>When he was done, Buffy said with a smirk, \u201cOoh, so you and\nTJ? When\u2019s the wedding? I expect an invitation tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuffy!\u201d Cyrus whisper-yelled, looking around them as the hallway was clearing out. </p><p>\u201cMe too, Cyrus. Also, which one of us is your maid of\nhonour? You have many important decisions to make,\u201d Andi added with a teasing\nsmile.</p><p>\u201cGuys,\u201d Cyrus whined. \u201cNothing\u2019s happening. It was just a\nfreak incident. Doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Buffy said, raising her eyebrows. \u201cIt\nalso wouldn\u2019t mean anything to you if I told you that for the past couple\nmonths, TJ has been gushing about you all through basketball practice, would\nit?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus stopped dead in his tracks, his thoughts in a whirl. <i>Could\nit be..? Nope. No. Do not entertain that thought.</i> He coughed, keeping his\neyes focused ahead. \u201cNope. Doesn\u2019t matter to me. Nuh-uh.\u201d</p><p>He walked away in the direction of his class, ignoring Andi\nand Buffy\u2019s laughs as he left. Of course, he still loved them, but they did\nseem to always suggest what he was too scared to believe, and sometimes it got\ntoo much for him.</p><p>He was so in his thoughts, that he wasn\u2019t even aware of his\nsurroundings, until he walked right into another person.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Cyrus mumbled, nearly stumbling\nover his feet. Luckily, whoever it was seemed to catch hold of him. He didn\u2019t know\nwho it was who he had nearly bulldozed over. That is until he heard a very\nfamiliar chuckle.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Cyrus. I don\u2019t mind,\u201d said TJ, his arms resting\non Cyrus\u2019 elbows, loosely holding onto them. </p><p>\u201cOh, um. Hey TJ,\u201d Cyrus said, shaking his head slightly as\nif that would help clear his mind. Realising how close he was to TJ at that\npoint, he immediately tried to disentangle himself, trying to put some space\nbetween, them. Not that he wanted to, but he knew that he had close to no\nchance with TJ, so might as well not let his heart die more.</p><p>As he moved away, Cyrus thought he saw disappointment\nflicker through TJ\u2019s eyes, but it was quickly replaced by his characteristic\nsoft smirk. Cyrus gulped nervously, aware of the growing tension in the air. </p><p>\u201cSo, h-how was the bread?\u201d Cyrus asked, silently facepalming\nhimself. <i>\u2018How was the bread?\u2019 He just shouldn\u2019t be allowed to speak.</i></p><p>Thankfully, TJ gave a small laugh, running a hand through\nhis hair. \u201cIt was really good. Best I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood good. That\u2019s good,\u201d Cyrus mumbled, pulling at the hem\nof his shirt with the hand that wasn\u2019t currently clutching his bag strap. They\nstood there in the now-empty hallway in silence, Cyrus eventually looking up at\nTJ, who was eyeing him with an expression that was unreadable. Then, Cyrus felt\nhimself take a small step toward TJ, prompted by something inside him,\nsomething that wanted to do nothing more than to get closer to the boy standing\nin front of him. TJ looked back at Cyrus, tilting his head slightly, a mix of\ncuriosity and uncertainty in his eyes. </p><p>\u201cI need to tell you something, Cyrus,\u201d TJ whispered, his\nglance flitting down before returning to meet Cyrus\u2019 eyes.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Cyrus whispered back. <i>They were so close.</i></p><p>\u201cI,\u201d TJ started, but before he could say anything, the shrill\nsound of the school bell rang through the school halls, causing the two to jump\naway, a blush covering Cyrus\u2019 cheeks as he realised what he had been doing. </p><p>\u201cI, I should go,\u201d Cyrus mumbled, walking to class, his head\nlooking down as he walked past TJ.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah me too. See you around,\u201d TJ replied, equally\nflustered as he walked in the opposite direction, looking back at Cyrus as he\nwalked away.</p><p>A few seconds later, Cyrus turned around, catching one last\nglimpse of TJ before he walked to Math.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cGuys, I really don\u2019t think anything happened, or is going\nto happen. Maybe he got weirded out by me and that\u2019s what he was going to tell\nme,\u201d Cyrus said as he wiped down the counter. Across from him on the other\nside, Buffy and Andi were standing by the display, looking at Cyrus with a\ncombination of disbelief and reassurance.</p><p>\u201cCyrus, no offence, but you are blind,\u201d Buffy said, raising\nher eyebrows. \u201cThe boy is always staring at you when you have classes together,\nand he somehow is always near your locker when you need some help. Plus, let\u2019s\nnot forget. He literally never shuts up about you during practice, it\u2019s\nannoying.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus just sighed, rearranging the cakes on show. <i>Buffy\nhad to be mistaken. He was just Cyrus, there was no way a guy like TJ Kippen could\nlike him.</i></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Buffy,\u201d Cyrus said, looking up at his friend.\n</p><p>\u201cCyrus!\u201d Buffy exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, it\u2019s staring you in the face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I have to agree with Buffy here. Even Amber tells me\nthat TJ talks about you all the time. It\u2019s really obvious,\u201d Andi chimed in.</p><p>Cyrus just raised one eyebrow, looking back and forth\nbetween his two friends. \u201cGuys, you don\u2019t get it. TJ is out of my league. Like\nway out. Like, he\u2019s the popular basketball player and I\u2019m the boy working in a\nbakery!\u201d</p><p>Buffy just rolled her eyes, walking away from the counter,\nraising her hands. \u201cI give up. I no longer feel the will to go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus, just talk to him,\u201d Andi said, reaching over to\nsqueeze Cyrus\u2019 hand before walking out of the store with Buffy.</p><p>Cyrus just stood there for a while, his thoughts moving fast.\nOn one hand, the girls made sense, maybe he should try talking to TJ. But on\nthe other hand, Cyrus was very much aware of the fact that TJ was an athlete, a\ncaptain, someone everyone loved. And Cyrus was just a kid who no one really\nbothered with. He wasn\u2019t unpopular, it\u2019s just that he was unnoticed. And he was\nokay with that.</p><p>Closing his eyes, Cyrus willed himself to focus on work. He\ntook a deep breath and told himself, <i>just deal with the customers and not\nthink about TJ.</i></p><p>Well that went about as well as one could expect. Because as\nsoon as Cyrus opened his eyes, the door opened to the chime of a bell, and in\nwalked none other than the root of all of Cyrus\u2019 problems: TJ.</p><p>Cyrus tried to keep a friendly, neutral expression as he saw\nTJ approach. All the while, he could practically hear his heart going <i>ba-boom\nba-boom ba-boom.</i> </p><p><i>Crap.</i></p><p>\u201cHi TJ, what can I do for you today?\u201d Cyrus said, trying to\nkeep his voice steady, unlike his mind.</p><p>TJ had a smirk on his face, but he was tugging at his\nsleeves nervously. \u201cI wanted to order a cake. Chocolate chocolate chip?\u201d</p><p><i>Doesn\u2019t mean anything that TJ was ordering a cake of his\nfavourite flavour. Nope. No.</i></p><p>Cyrus smiled, noting the order down on a little notepad that\nno one else used except him. His mom would often laugh in good nature at how\nCyrus would note down every detail that was said to him. He looked back up at\nTJ, putting the pencil behind his ear. \u201cDo you want a message written on the\ncake?\u201d</p><p>For the first time, TJ looked hesitant, scratching his earlobe\nand biting his lip slightly. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, shoot.\u201d</p><p>TJ took a deep breath and looked Cyrus right in the eyes. \u201cCyrus,\nI have had the biggest crush on you since 7<sup>th</sup> grade. Will you go out\nwith me?\u201d</p><p>Time may as well have stopped, with the way Cyrus just\nstared back at TJ, disbelief clouding his thoughts. TJ looked back at Cyrus\nexpectantly, stuffing his hands into his hoodie pockets as he balanced on the\nballs of his foot, waiting for Cyrus to respond.</p><p>After what seemed like forever, Cyrus coughed, clearing his\nthroat. \u201cAnd what occasion is the cake for?\u201d he asked, as he moved to write in\nhis notepad. </p><p>As soon as he said that, he swore he heard Buffy yell, \u201cOh\nyou have got to be kidding,\u201d before her voice became muffled. TJ groaned, hitting\nhis head on the counter in front of him. He looked back up at Cyrus, who looked\non in confusion. </p><p>Suddenly, TJ vaulted himself over the counter, standing\ndirectly in front of Cyrus. Their chests were touching, their faces close.\nCyrus felt his breath hitch, dropping his pencil onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cYou really are oblivious, Cyrus Goodman,\u201d TJ whispered,\nwrapping his arms around Cyrus\u2019 waist.</p><p>Cyrus could no longer feel individual heartbeats, it was all\na hum, that\u2019s how fast it felt. Before he could overthink any of it, he cupped\nTJ\u2019s cheeks and pulled him in for a kiss. </p><p>It was magical. The smell of the chocolate and vanilla from\nthe bakery mixed with the smell of TJ\u2019s cologne was sending Cyrus\u2019 mind in a\nwhirl. He wrapped his arms around TJ\u2019s neck and TJ tightened his arms around\nCyrus\u2019 waist, pulling each other impossibly closer. It felt like forever before\nthey pulled away, yet somehow it was still too short for Cyrus. When they\npulled away, Cyrus rested his head against TJ\u2019s, feeling out of breath. His\nbrain had just finished processing what had happened.</p><p><i>TJ liked him. TJ asked him out. He kissed TJ.</i></p><p>\u201cSo? What\u2019s your answer?\u201d TJ asked in a whisper, a soft\nsmile on his face, his cheeks pink.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d Cyrus replied cheekily.</p><p>TJ raised his eyebrows, amused. Cyrus let out a small giggle,\nkissing the tip of TJ\u2019s nose. </p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>~~~~</p><p><b>so this idea came about when sarah and i were having our usual crackhead conversations and i found this post on instagram and the gears began turning. Hope you guys liked a fluffy fic for a change!</b></p>",

So what will happen when TJ walks into the store one day? Inspired by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwYTvHgH3M6/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=15jnwd0snnax0\">this</a> Instagram post</i></p><p><b>Words: </b>2967</p>[[MORE]]<p>Ever since his parents opened their bakery in town, Cyrus\nhas never failed to find comfort in the store. The smell, the homely ambience,\nall of it never failed to centre and ground him. It was one of the only places\nwhere he felt truly calm. So, whenever his mom said they needed help, Cyrus\njumped at the chance, practically pouncing at every opportunity to be amidst\nthe smell of vanilla, chocolate, caramel and bread.</p><p>It was one of those days, and luckily the day was also\nslower compared to others, allowing Cyrus a chance to take a break from\nchatting to all the customers that walked through the door. Not that he didn\u2019t\nlike talking to them, he loved hearing people\u2019s stories. It just got exhausting\nafter a couple hours. </p><p>After talking to the lovely lady who wanted some eclairs,\nCyrus wiped his forehead with the back of his hand, smearing the flour over it.\nHe didn\u2019t really care. It wasn\u2019t like anyone was going to care about his\nappearance. He was just the boy who ran the till and took their orders for\nbaked goods. No one would care about his appearance.</p><p>Okay, maybe he was spending too much time trying to rearrange\nthe cupcakes on the display, because he heard a soft cough, trying to draw his\nattention. Cyrus sighed, looking up over the counter.</p><p>\u201cSorry for that. How may I\u2026\u201d Cyrus said, stopping short when\nhe noticed who it was, and suddenly regretting his harried appearance. </p><p>TJ Kippen. Basketball captain. Only the guy Cyrus had been\nhopelessly crushing on from the safety of his locker and his desk in the class.\nThey had only spoken a few times before, running into each other every now and\nthen because Buffy and he played on the same basketball team. Each time they\nspoke, Cyrus was somehow more and more of a goner. And now here he was. In\nfront of him. While Cyrus\u2019 hair was a godawful mess, and there was flour all over\nhis face. <i>Oh. God.</i></p><p>\u201cI- Um,\u201d Cyrus stuttered, trying to fix his hair and wipe\noff the flour of his face, while simultaneously trying to relax and seem casual.\n<i>Just be cool, Cyrus. Cool as a cucumber. A cucumber that was now in an oven.</i></p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d TJ said, his voice soft, as he stuffed his hands into\nthe pockets of his sweatpants, balancing on the balls of his feet. \u201cCyrus,\nright?\u201d <i>He looked so cute,</i> Cyrus thought to himself unhelpfully, as he\ndesperately tried to find his voice. </p><p>\u201cUm, hey. How can I help you today?\u201d Cyrus said, resting one\nhand on the counter, the other on his waist as he tried to seem at ease. Not\nvery easy when one\u2019s heart is practically racing at a million miles an hour. </p><p>\u201cUh, my mom called in to order some bread. Wait,\u201d TJ said,\nreaching into his pocket, pulling out a piece of paper. \u201cHere\u2019s the name,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m not very good with names.\u201d</p><p>As TJ handed Cyrus the slip of paper, their fingers brushed\nslightly, an occurrence that sent Cyrus\u2019 heart soaring and his head spinning. The\ntwo looked at each other in surprise, blushes creeping onto their faces and TJ\nlaughed nervously.</p><p>\u201cJust one second, I\u2019ll check if it\u2019s ready,\u201d Cyrus said, revelling\nin the distraction. He took the few moments he had while turned away from TJ to\nsteady his breathing. <i>He needed to get it together, </i>Cyrus thought to himself,\nscolding his heart for betraying his trust by still racing. </p><p><i>But he\u2019s wearing glasses and his hair is fluffy, how does\none remain calm,</i> his heart arguing back, much to Cyrus\u2019 chagrin. Sighing,\nresigning himself to his inevitable doom, Cyrus turned back to TJ with a shy\nsmile, grabbing the carefully packed parcel that his mother had kept aside.</p><p>\u201cHere you go, freshly baked,\u201d Cyrus said handing over the\nparcel, ignoring the fluttering feeling in his heart when their fingers brushed\nagainst each other again. TJ smiled at Cyrus, gasping as he took hold of the\nbread.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, it\u2019s hot!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hot too,\u201d Cyrus mumbled unknowingly. As soon as he\nrealised what he had said, he slapped a hand across his mouth, his eyes wide.\nTJ was looking at him, his eyebrows quirked, a soft smirk on his face. </p><p>\u201cOh my god, I- I am so sorry, I don\u2019t know why,\u201d Cyrus\nfumbled, desperately trying to take back what he said, his face growing warmer\nand warmer with every passing second. </p><p>TJ just softly laughed, reaching over the counter to grab\nCyrus\u2019 hand, quieting him. \u201cHey, it\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t worry about it. Good to know you\nfind me hot,\u201d he said, winking at Cyrus.</p><p><i>Death would be a welcome release right now,</i> Cyrus\nthought to himself, as he gulped nervously. They stared each other in the eye for\na moment, the tension in the air building more and more. Just then, the door opened,\na bell chiming, causing the two to snap out of their trance. Cyrus coughed, trying\nto play cool. </p><p>\u201cYeah, um. Thanks for coming by. Nice to talk to you,\u201d Cyrus\nsaid, holding out his hand for a handshake. <i>Casual, casual. Just two bros\nshaking hands.</i></p><p>TJ just giggled slightly, returning the handshake. \u201cNice to talk\nto you too, Cyrus. Who knew that when I just came down for bread, I would end\nup running into a really cute guy?\u201d he said, his cheeks pink. He winked at\nCyrus while leaving the money on the counter, walking out of the store. Before he\nwalked out of the door, TJ looked back at Cyrus, a soft smile on his face that\nsent Cyrus\u2019 already racing heart into a complicated and elaborate dance routine.\nWith a great amount of difficulty, Cyrus managed to give a small smile back, raising\nhis hand for a small wave.</p><p>After TJ had left, Cyrus looked around, thankful that there weren\u2019t\nmany people around. He called to his mom that he was taking a break, and walked\nout of the store, sinking against the wall outside.</p><p>That was a hell of an experience.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cAnd we spent 3 hours just in Andi Shack making bracelets. That\nshouldn\u2019t be interesting, but it was?\u201d Andi said as she shut the door of her\nlocker. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t understand anything. What do you guys think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that means, now I\u2019m just spitballing here, but I think\nmaybe, just maybe. You like Amber,\u201d Buffy said.</p><p>Andi just glared at Buffy, unimpressed. \u201cGee, thanks. What\ndo you think, Cyrus?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus, who had been lost in thought all the while, was startled\nout of his dream world. \u201cHuh? What?\u201d</p><p>Buffy furrowed her eyebrows, confused at Cyrus\u2019 spaciness.</p><p>\u201cCyrus, did you hear anything I just said?\u201d Andi asked,\nnarrowing her eyes.</p><p>Cyrus looked at his two friends, sighing. \u201cSorry, Andi. I\njust, I spaced out. But you should tell Amber you like her. That\u2019s all I got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, what? I can\u2019t do that!\u201d Andi said incredulously. \u201cWhat\nif she doesn\u2019t feel the same? What if she doesn\u2019t like girls? What if she hates\nme, Cyrus. What do I do then?\u201d she said, grabbing Cyrus\u2019 shoulders and shaking\nthem.</p><p>Cyrus just laughed, covering Andi\u2019s hands with his. \u201cIt\u2019ll\nbe fine, Andi. Believe me, you\u2019ll feel better telling her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays the guy who is harbouring the biggest silent crush on\nTJ,\u201d Buffy said, smirking.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Cyrus said, turning away from his friends. \u201cAbout\nthat\u2026\u201d</p><p>The two girls stopped, Buffy sticking a hand out in front of\nCyrus to stop him from walking away. </p><p>\u201cCyrus, spill,\u201d Buffy said firmly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, come on. There are still 10 minutes for the bell to\nring,\u201d Andi added.</p><p>Groaning at the embarrassment and questions to come, Cyrus\nrelayed all the events that had occurred in the bakery on the day Cyrus\u2019 soul\nascended and left his body. As he spoke, he could see the two girls get visibly\nmore excited, Andi practically smiling to the high heavens. Buffy\u2019s eyes were\nfilled with glee and excitement, and Cyrus could practically see her gears\nturning as she thought up more ways to tease Cyrus. <i>This was the worst idea\nhe had ever had.</i></p><p>When he was done, Buffy said with a smirk, \u201cOoh, so you and\nTJ? When\u2019s the wedding? I expect an invitation tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuffy!\u201d Cyrus whisper-yelled, looking around them as the hallway was clearing out. </p><p>\u201cMe too, Cyrus. Also, which one of us is your maid of\nhonour? You have many important decisions to make,\u201d Andi added with a teasing\nsmile.</p><p>\u201cGuys,\u201d Cyrus whined. \u201cNothing\u2019s happening. It was just a\nfreak incident. Doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Buffy said, raising her eyebrows. \u201cIt\nalso wouldn\u2019t mean anything to you if I told you that for the past couple\nmonths, TJ has been gushing about you all through basketball practice, would\nit?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus stopped dead in his tracks, his thoughts in a whirl. <i>Could\nit be..? Nope. No. Do not entertain that thought.</i> He coughed, keeping his\neyes focused ahead. \u201cNope. Doesn\u2019t matter to me. Nuh-uh.\u201d</p><p>He walked away in the direction of his class, ignoring Andi\nand Buffy\u2019s laughs as he left. Of course, he still loved them, but they did\nseem to always suggest what he was too scared to believe, and sometimes it got\ntoo much for him.</p><p>He was so in his thoughts, that he wasn\u2019t even aware of his\nsurroundings, until he walked right into another person.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Cyrus mumbled, nearly stumbling\nover his feet. Luckily, whoever it was seemed to catch hold of him. He didn\u2019t know\nwho it was who he had nearly bulldozed over. That is until he heard a very\nfamiliar chuckle.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Cyrus. I don\u2019t mind,\u201d said TJ, his arms resting\non Cyrus\u2019 elbows, loosely holding onto them. </p><p>\u201cOh, um. Hey TJ,\u201d Cyrus said, shaking his head slightly as\nif that would help clear his mind. Realising how close he was to TJ at that\npoint, he immediately tried to disentangle himself, trying to put some space\nbetween, them. Not that he wanted to, but he knew that he had close to no\nchance with TJ, so might as well not let his heart die more.</p><p>As he moved away, Cyrus thought he saw disappointment\nflicker through TJ\u2019s eyes, but it was quickly replaced by his characteristic\nsoft smirk. Cyrus gulped nervously, aware of the growing tension in the air. </p><p>\u201cSo, h-how was the bread?\u201d Cyrus asked, silently facepalming\nhimself. <i>\u2018How was the bread?\u2019 He just shouldn\u2019t be allowed to speak.</i></p><p>Thankfully, TJ gave a small laugh, running a hand through\nhis hair. \u201cIt was really good. Best I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood good. That\u2019s good,\u201d Cyrus mumbled, pulling at the hem\nof his shirt with the hand that wasn\u2019t currently clutching his bag strap. They\nstood there in the now-empty hallway in silence, Cyrus eventually looking up at\nTJ, who was eyeing him with an expression that was unreadable. Then, Cyrus felt\nhimself take a small step toward TJ, prompted by something inside him,\nsomething that wanted to do nothing more than to get closer to the boy standing\nin front of him. TJ looked back at Cyrus, tilting his head slightly, a mix of\ncuriosity and uncertainty in his eyes. </p><p>\u201cI need to tell you something, Cyrus,\u201d TJ whispered, his\nglance flitting down before returning to meet Cyrus\u2019 eyes.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Cyrus whispered back. <i>They were so close.</i></p><p>\u201cI,\u201d TJ started, but before he could say anything, the shrill\nsound of the school bell rang through the school halls, causing the two to jump\naway, a blush covering Cyrus\u2019 cheeks as he realised what he had been doing. </p><p>\u201cI, I should go,\u201d Cyrus mumbled, walking to class, his head\nlooking down as he walked past TJ.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah me too. See you around,\u201d TJ replied, equally\nflustered as he walked in the opposite direction, looking back at Cyrus as he\nwalked away.</p><p>A few seconds later, Cyrus turned around, catching one last\nglimpse of TJ before he walked to Math.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cGuys, I really don\u2019t think anything happened, or is going\nto happen. Maybe he got weirded out by me and that\u2019s what he was going to tell\nme,\u201d Cyrus said as he wiped down the counter. Across from him on the other\nside, Buffy and Andi were standing by the display, looking at Cyrus with a\ncombination of disbelief and reassurance.</p><p>\u201cCyrus, no offence, but you are blind,\u201d Buffy said, raising\nher eyebrows. \u201cThe boy is always staring at you when you have classes together,\nand he somehow is always near your locker when you need some help. Plus, let\u2019s\nnot forget. He literally never shuts up about you during practice, it\u2019s\nannoying.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus just sighed, rearranging the cakes on show. <i>Buffy\nhad to be mistaken. He was just Cyrus, there was no way a guy like TJ Kippen could\nlike him.</i></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Buffy,\u201d Cyrus said, looking up at his friend.\n</p><p>\u201cCyrus!\u201d Buffy exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, it\u2019s staring you in the face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I have to agree with Buffy here. Even Amber tells me\nthat TJ talks about you all the time. It\u2019s really obvious,\u201d Andi chimed in.</p><p>Cyrus just raised one eyebrow, looking back and forth\nbetween his two friends. \u201cGuys, you don\u2019t get it. TJ is out of my league. Like\nway out. Like, he\u2019s the popular basketball player and I\u2019m the boy working in a\nbakery!\u201d</p><p>Buffy just rolled her eyes, walking away from the counter,\nraising her hands. \u201cI give up. I no longer feel the will to go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus, just talk to him,\u201d Andi said, reaching over to\nsqueeze Cyrus\u2019 hand before walking out of the store with Buffy.</p><p>Cyrus just stood there for a while, his thoughts moving fast.\nOn one hand, the girls made sense, maybe he should try talking to TJ. But on\nthe other hand, Cyrus was very much aware of the fact that TJ was an athlete, a\ncaptain, someone everyone loved. And Cyrus was just a kid who no one really\nbothered with. He wasn\u2019t unpopular, it\u2019s just that he was unnoticed. And he was\nokay with that.</p><p>Closing his eyes, Cyrus willed himself to focus on work. He\ntook a deep breath and told himself, <i>just deal with the customers and not\nthink about TJ.</i></p><p>Well that went about as well as one could expect. Because as\nsoon as Cyrus opened his eyes, the door opened to the chime of a bell, and in\nwalked none other than the root of all of Cyrus\u2019 problems: TJ.</p><p>Cyrus tried to keep a friendly, neutral expression as he saw\nTJ approach. All the while, he could practically hear his heart going <i>ba-boom\nba-boom ba-boom.</i> </p><p><i>Crap.</i></p><p>\u201cHi TJ, what can I do for you today?\u201d Cyrus said, trying to\nkeep his voice steady, unlike his mind.</p><p>TJ had a smirk on his face, but he was tugging at his\nsleeves nervously. \u201cI wanted to order a cake. Chocolate chocolate chip?\u201d</p><p><i>Doesn\u2019t mean anything that TJ was ordering a cake of his\nfavourite flavour. Nope. No.</i></p><p>Cyrus smiled, noting the order down on a little notepad that\nno one else used except him. His mom would often laugh in good nature at how\nCyrus would note down every detail that was said to him. He looked back up at\nTJ, putting the pencil behind his ear. \u201cDo you want a message written on the\ncake?\u201d</p><p>For the first time, TJ looked hesitant, scratching his earlobe\nand biting his lip slightly. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, shoot.\u201d</p><p>TJ took a deep breath and looked Cyrus right in the eyes. \u201cCyrus,\nI have had the biggest crush on you since 7<sup>th</sup> grade. Will you go out\nwith me?\u201d</p><p>Time may as well have stopped, with the way Cyrus just\nstared back at TJ, disbelief clouding his thoughts. TJ looked back at Cyrus\nexpectantly, stuffing his hands into his hoodie pockets as he balanced on the\nballs of his foot, waiting for Cyrus to respond.</p><p>After what seemed like forever, Cyrus coughed, clearing his\nthroat. \u201cAnd what occasion is the cake for?\u201d he asked, as he moved to write in\nhis notepad. </p><p>As soon as he said that, he swore he heard Buffy yell, \u201cOh\nyou have got to be kidding,\u201d before her voice became muffled. TJ groaned, hitting\nhis head on the counter in front of him. He looked back up at Cyrus, who looked\non in confusion. </p><p>Suddenly, TJ vaulted himself over the counter, standing\ndirectly in front of Cyrus. Their chests were touching, their faces close.\nCyrus felt his breath hitch, dropping his pencil onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cYou really are oblivious, Cyrus Goodman,\u201d TJ whispered,\nwrapping his arms around Cyrus\u2019 waist.</p><p>Cyrus could no longer feel individual heartbeats, it was all\na hum, that\u2019s how fast it felt. Before he could overthink any of it, he cupped\nTJ\u2019s cheeks and pulled him in for a kiss. </p><p>It was magical. The smell of the chocolate and vanilla from\nthe bakery mixed with the smell of TJ\u2019s cologne was sending Cyrus\u2019 mind in a\nwhirl. He wrapped his arms around TJ\u2019s neck and TJ tightened his arms around\nCyrus\u2019 waist, pulling each other impossibly closer. It felt like forever before\nthey pulled away, yet somehow it was still too short for Cyrus. When they\npulled away, Cyrus rested his head against TJ\u2019s, feeling out of breath. His\nbrain had just finished processing what had happened.</p><p><i>TJ liked him. TJ asked him out. He kissed TJ.</i></p><p>\u201cSo? What\u2019s your answer?\u201d TJ asked in a whisper, a soft\nsmile on his face, his cheeks pink.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d Cyrus replied cheekily.</p><p>TJ raised his eyebrows, amused. Cyrus let out a small giggle,\nkissing the tip of TJ\u2019s nose. </p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>~~~~</p><p><b>so this idea came about when sarah and i were having our usual crackhead conversations and i found this post on instagram and the gears began turning.

                "content": "<p><b>Summary: </b><i>Cyrus works in his parents&rsquo; bakery and has a passing (not) crush on TJ Kippen, the basketball captain. So what will happen when TJ walks into the store one day? Inspired by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwYTvHgH3M6/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=15jnwd0snnax0\">this</a> Instagram post</i></p><p><b>Words: </b>2967</p><p>Ever since his parents opened their bakery in town, Cyrus\nhas never failed to find comfort in the store. The smell, the homely ambience,\nall of it never failed to centre and ground him. It was one of the only places\nwhere he felt truly calm. So, whenever his mom said they needed help, Cyrus\njumped at the chance, practically pouncing at every opportunity to be amidst\nthe smell of vanilla, chocolate, caramel and bread.</p><p>It was one of those days, and luckily the day was also\nslower compared to others, allowing Cyrus a chance to take a break from\nchatting to all the customers that walked through the door. Not that he didn&rsquo;t\nlike talking to them, he loved hearing people&rsquo;s stories. It just got exhausting\nafter a couple hours. </p><p>After talking to the lovely lady who wanted some eclairs,\nCyrus wiped his forehead with the back of his hand, smearing the flour over it.\nHe didn&rsquo;t really care. It wasn&rsquo;t like anyone was going to care about his\nappearance. He was just the boy who ran the till and took their orders for\nbaked goods. No one would care about his appearance.</p><p>Okay, maybe he was spending too much time trying to rearrange\nthe cupcakes on the display, because he heard a soft cough, trying to draw his\nattention. Cyrus sighed, looking up over the counter.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry for that. How may I&hellip;&rdquo; Cyrus said, stopping short when\nhe noticed who it was, and suddenly regretting his harried appearance. </p><p>TJ Kippen. Basketball captain. Only the guy Cyrus had been\nhopelessly crushing on from the safety of his locker and his desk in the class.\nThey had only spoken a few times before, running into each other every now and\nthen because Buffy and he played on the same basketball team. Each time they\nspoke, Cyrus was somehow more and more of a goner. And now here he was. In\nfront of him. While Cyrus&rsquo; hair was a godawful mess, and there was flour all over\nhis face. <i>Oh. God.</i></p><p>&ldquo;I- Um,&rdquo; Cyrus stuttered, trying to fix his hair and wipe\noff the flour of his face, while simultaneously trying to relax and seem casual.\n<i>Just be cool, Cyrus. Cool as a cucumber. A cucumber that was now in an oven.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; TJ said, his voice soft, as he stuffed his hands into\nthe pockets of his sweatpants, balancing on the balls of his feet. &ldquo;Cyrus,\nright?&rdquo; <i>He looked so cute,</i> Cyrus thought to himself unhelpfully, as he\ndesperately tried to find his voice. </p><p>&ldquo;Um, hey. How can I help you today?&rdquo; Cyrus said, resting one\nhand on the counter, the other on his waist as he tried to seem at ease. Not\nvery easy when one&rsquo;s heart is practically racing at a million miles an hour. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh, my mom called in to order some bread. Wait,&rdquo; TJ said,\nreaching into his pocket, pulling out a piece of paper. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the name,&rdquo; he\nsaid. &ldquo;Sorry, I&rsquo;m not very good with names.&rdquo;</p><p>As TJ handed Cyrus the slip of paper, their fingers brushed\nslightly, an occurrence that sent Cyrus&rsquo; heart soaring and his head spinning. The\ntwo looked at each other in surprise, blushes creeping onto their faces and TJ\nlaughed nervously.</p><p>&ldquo;Just one second, I&rsquo;ll check if it&rsquo;s ready,&rdquo; Cyrus said, revelling\nin the distraction. He took the few moments he had while turned away from TJ to\nsteady his breathing. <i>He needed to get it together, </i>Cyrus thought to himself,\nscolding his heart for betraying his trust by still racing. </p><p><i>But he&rsquo;s wearing glasses and his hair is fluffy, how does\none remain calm,</i> his heart arguing back, much to Cyrus&rsquo; chagrin. Sighing,\nresigning himself to his inevitable doom, Cyrus turned back to TJ with a shy\nsmile, grabbing the carefully packed parcel that his mother had kept aside.</p><p>&ldquo;Here you go, freshly baked,&rdquo; Cyrus said handing over the\nparcel, ignoring the fluttering feeling in his heart when their fingers brushed\nagainst each other again. TJ smiled at Cyrus, gasping as he took hold of the\nbread.</p><p>&ldquo;Whoa, it&rsquo;s hot!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re hot too,&rdquo; Cyrus mumbled unknowingly. As soon as he\nrealised what he had said, he slapped a hand across his mouth, his eyes wide.\nTJ was looking at him, his eyebrows quirked, a soft smirk on his face. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god, I- I am so sorry, I don&rsquo;t know why,&rdquo; Cyrus\nfumbled, desperately trying to take back what he said, his face growing warmer\nand warmer with every passing second. </p><p>TJ just softly laughed, reaching over the counter to grab\nCyrus&rsquo; hand, quieting him. &ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s okay. Don&rsquo;t worry about it. Good to know you\nfind me hot,&rdquo; he said, winking at Cyrus.</p><p><i>Death would be a welcome release right now,</i> Cyrus\nthought to himself, as he gulped nervously. They stared each other in the eye for\na moment, the tension in the air building more and more. Just then, the door opened,\na bell chiming, causing the two to snap out of their trance. Cyrus coughed, trying\nto play cool. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, um. Thanks for coming by. Nice to talk to you,&rdquo; Cyrus\nsaid, holding out his hand for a handshake. <i>Casual, casual. Just two bros\nshaking hands.</i></p><p>TJ just giggled slightly, returning the handshake. &ldquo;Nice to talk\nto you too, Cyrus. Who knew that when I just came down for bread, I would end\nup running into a really cute guy?&rdquo; he said, his cheeks pink. He winked at\nCyrus while leaving the money on the counter, walking out of the store. Before he\nwalked out of the door, TJ looked back at Cyrus, a soft smile on his face that\nsent Cyrus&rsquo; already racing heart into a complicated and elaborate dance routine.\nWith a great amount of difficulty, Cyrus managed to give a small smile back, raising\nhis hand for a small wave.</p><p>After TJ had left, Cyrus looked around, thankful that there weren&rsquo;t\nmany people around. He called to his mom that he was taking a break, and walked\nout of the store, sinking against the wall outside.</p><p>That was a hell of an experience.</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;And we spent 3 hours just in Andi Shack making bracelets. That\nshouldn&rsquo;t be interesting, but it was?&rdquo; Andi said as she shut the door of her\nlocker. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I can&rsquo;t understand anything. What do you guys think?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think that means, now I&rsquo;m just spitballing here, but I think\nmaybe, just maybe. You like Amber,&rdquo; Buffy said.</p><p>Andi just glared at Buffy, unimpressed. &ldquo;Gee, thanks. What\ndo you think, Cyrus?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus, who had been lost in thought all the while, was startled\nout of his dream world. &ldquo;Huh? What?&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy furrowed her eyebrows, confused at Cyrus&rsquo; spaciness.</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus, did you hear anything I just said?&rdquo; Andi asked,\nnarrowing her eyes.</p><p>Cyrus looked at his two friends, sighing. &ldquo;Sorry, Andi. I\njust, I spaced out. But you should tell Amber you like her. That&rsquo;s all I got.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um, what? I can&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; Andi said incredulously. &ldquo;What\nif she doesn&rsquo;t feel the same? What if she doesn&rsquo;t like girls? What if she hates\nme, Cyrus. What do I do then?&rdquo; she said, grabbing Cyrus&rsquo; shoulders and shaking\nthem.</p><p>Cyrus just laughed, covering Andi&rsquo;s hands with his. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll\nbe fine, Andi. Believe me, you&rsquo;ll feel better telling her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Says the guy who is harbouring the biggest silent crush on\nTJ,&rdquo; Buffy said, smirking.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Cyrus said, turning away from his friends. &ldquo;About\nthat&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>The two girls stopped, Buffy sticking a hand out in front of\nCyrus to stop him from walking away. </p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus, spill,&rdquo; Buffy said firmly.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, come on. There are still 10 minutes for the bell to\nring,&rdquo; Andi added.</p><p>Groaning at the embarrassment and questions to come, Cyrus\nrelayed all the events that had occurred in the bakery on the day Cyrus&rsquo; soul\nascended and left his body. As he spoke, he could see the two girls get visibly\nmore excited, Andi practically smiling to the high heavens. Buffy&rsquo;s eyes were\nfilled with glee and excitement, and Cyrus could practically see her gears\nturning as she thought up more ways to tease Cyrus. <i>This was the worst idea\nhe had ever had.</i></p><p>When he was done, Buffy said with a smirk, &ldquo;Ooh, so you and\nTJ? When&rsquo;s the wedding? I expect an invitation tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Buffy!&rdquo; Cyrus whisper-yelled, looking around them as the hallway was clearing out. </p><p>&ldquo;Me too, Cyrus. Also, which one of us is your maid of\nhonour?

He looked back up at\nTJ, putting the pencil behind his ear. &ldquo;Do you want a message written on the\ncake?&rdquo;</p><p>For the first time, TJ looked hesitant, scratching his earlobe\nand biting his lip slightly. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, shoot.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ took a deep breath and looked Cyrus right in the eyes. &ldquo;Cyrus,\nI have had the biggest crush on you since 7<sup>th</sup> grade. Will you go out\nwith me?&rdquo;</p><p>Time may as well have stopped, with the way Cyrus just\nstared back at TJ, disbelief clouding his thoughts. TJ looked back at Cyrus\nexpectantly, stuffing his hands into his hoodie pockets as he balanced on the\nballs of his foot, waiting for Cyrus to respond.</p><p>After what seemed like forever, Cyrus coughed, clearing his\nthroat. &ldquo;And what occasion is the cake for?&rdquo; he asked, as he moved to write in\nhis notepad. </p><p>As soon as he said that, he swore he heard Buffy yell, &ldquo;Oh\nyou have got to be kidding,&rdquo; before her voice became muffled. TJ groaned, hitting\nhis head on the counter in front of him. He looked back up at Cyrus, who looked\non in confusion. </p><p>Suddenly, TJ vaulted himself over the counter, standing\ndirectly in front of Cyrus. Their chests were touching, their faces close.\nCyrus felt his breath hitch, dropping his pencil onto the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;You really are oblivious, Cyrus Goodman,&rdquo; TJ whispered,\nwrapping his arms around Cyrus&rsquo; waist.</p><p>Cyrus could no longer feel individual heartbeats, it was all\na hum, that&rsquo;s how fast it felt. Before he could overthink any of it, he cupped\nTJ&rsquo;s cheeks and pulled him in for a kiss. </p><p>It was magical. The smell of the chocolate and vanilla from\nthe bakery mixed with the smell of TJ&rsquo;s cologne was sending Cyrus&rsquo; mind in a\nwhirl. He wrapped his arms around TJ&rsquo;s neck and TJ tightened his arms around\nCyrus&rsquo; waist, pulling each other impossibly closer. It felt like forever before\nthey pulled away, yet somehow it was still too short for Cyrus. When they\npulled away, Cyrus rested his head against TJ&rsquo;s, feeling out of breath. His\nbrain had just finished processing what had happened.</p><p><i>TJ liked him. TJ asked him out. He kissed TJ.</i></p><p>&ldquo;So? What&rsquo;s your answer?&rdquo; TJ asked in a whisper, a soft\nsmile on his face, his cheeks pink.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think about it,&rdquo; Cyrus replied cheekily.</p><p>TJ raised his eyebrows, amused. Cyrus let out a small giggle,\nkissing the tip of TJ&rsquo;s nose. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>~~~~</p><p><b>so this idea came about when sarah and i were having our usual crackhead conversations and i found this post on instagram and the gears began turning. Hope you guys liked a fluffy fic for a change!</b></p>",
