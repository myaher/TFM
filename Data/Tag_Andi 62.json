The average budget for each ep is $923 000, Disney can\u2019t afford to just cut an entire ep and we already know they re-shot almost all of 3x20 which looked like it was the ep with the most Ham screen time. We also know from the snowy outdoor filming they did for 3x20 (both original production and the re-shoots) and from some fake snow left on the ground during the bench scene that those two eps likely took place fairly close together in universe. Given that 3x20 has so much Celia and Ham and that all of Ham\u2019s cut scenes from 3x21 were at the beginning and that Celia isn\u2019t at the house party, it\u2019s likely that 3x20 was when they were supposed to announce that they\u2019d be leaving to travel the world together and then 3x21 picked up with them actually leaving.</p><p>It makes sense that they\u2019d decide to just have an hour long finale; it was a poor choice to have the series finale be a half hour ep even if Disney was going to let them air it without commercials. And realistically as nice of a set as the Mack family house is, it\u2019s still just a set and it pales in comparison to a lot of the great on location filming the show has done. And a party is nice but again the kids clothes pale in comparison to the nice dresses and suits they were wearing at the wedding which is going to air just two weeks beforehand. So starting off the finale with the beautiful outdoor filming they did for 3x20 makes it much more visually appealing though it does make for a lopsided finale where the first half is heavy with the Mack family and the second half is crammed with every single character but it is what it is</p>",

The average budget for each ep is $923 000, Disney can\u2019t afford to just cut an entire ep and we already know they re-shot almost all of 3x20 which looked like it was the ep with the most Ham screen time. We also know from the snowy outdoor filming they did for 3x20 (both original production and the re-shoots) and from some fake snow left on the ground during the bench scene that those two eps likely took place fairly close together in universe. Given that 3x20 has so much Celia and Ham and that all of Ham\u2019s cut scenes from 3x21 were at the beginning and that Celia isn\u2019t at the house party, it\u2019s likely that 3x20 was when they were supposed to announce that they\u2019d be leaving to travel the world together and then 3x21 picked up with them actually leaving.</p><p>It makes sense that they\u2019d decide to just have an hour long finale; it was a poor choice to have the series finale be a half hour ep even if Disney was going to let them air it without commercials. And realistically as nice of a set as the Mack family house is, it\u2019s still just a set and it pales in comparison to a lot of the great on location filming the show has done. And a party is nice but again the kids clothes pale in comparison to the nice dresses and suits they were wearing at the wedding which is going to air just two weeks beforehand. So starting off the finale with the beautiful outdoor filming they did for 3x20 makes it much more visually appealing though it does make for a lopsided finale where the first half is heavy with the Mack family and the second half is crammed with every single character but it is what it is</p>",

        "body": "<p>Chapter 13. Two Pink Lines<br/></p><p>Now that Bex didn&rsquo;t have any friends, she spent her lunch period \u00a0\nholed away in the school&rsquo;s darkroom, developing depressing photos. In \u00a0\nthere, the loneliness didn&rsquo;t feel so lonely. The photography room became\n \u00a0her safe haven, in a place where everything reminded her of Bowie, \nfrom the hallway lockers to the gym. <br/></p><p>She still hadn&rsquo;t heard from him. It had been almost a week since he&rsquo;d\n left. The day before, she&rsquo;d asked her dad how many days it takes to \ndrive from Shadyside to Los Angeles. Being who he was, her sat down with\n her, and took out a map to show her the distance. Accounting for stops,\n he said, two days was realistic. That meant that Bowie had had three \ndays to call her. He promised he would. But nothing. Finally, she \ncouldn&rsquo;t take the stress anymore, and she called <i>him</i>. It went \nstraight to voicemail. She tried him several more times, and got the \nsame. That morning, she&rsquo;d tried calling him one last time. This time, \nshe got a message that his mailbox was full.</p><!-- more --><p>The only bad thing about spending so much time in the darkroom was \nthat the solitude of the place left her alone with her thoughts. \u00a0As she\n bathed her photo in water, she thought of the inescapable mess \u00a0she was\n in. She felt as if the weight of the world were on her shoulders, and \nshe was crushing beneath it&rsquo;s pressure.<br/></p><p>As she worked, the photograph blurred before her eyes, and she \nrealized she was crying. Tears ran down her cheeks, leaving streaks in \nher makeup. She tried to brush them away \u00a0with her forearm. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;Bex? Are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>She jumped. She&rsquo;d almost forgotten Ms. Fisher was also in the room \nworking, it had been so quiet. The teacher frowned at her with concern.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; she told her quickly, keeping her head down, unable to meet her teacher&rsquo;s eyes. <br/></p><p>Ms. Fisher gave her a sympathetic look. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t been yourself \u00a0\nlately, Bex. I&rsquo;m worried about you. Breakups are hard, honey.&rdquo; Everyone \nhad heard about Bowie leaving by then. The teacher paused sadly. &ldquo;If \nyou&rsquo;re <i>not </i>fine, and you ever need someone to talk \u00a0to about anything at all, I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p><p>Bex chewed her lip, wondering if she could trust her teacher with her\n \u00a0secret. Her instincts told her she could, and it would be a relief to \nhave someone to confide in. But she was still hesitant. \u00a0&quot;How do I know \nyou won&rsquo;t just tell my parents whatever I tell you?&ldquo;</p><p>&quot;You don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Ms. Fisher told her. &ldquo;You just have to trust me. \u00a0\nBut I promise you, I wouldn&rsquo;t say anything to anyone, unless you or \u00a0\nsomeone else is in danger. Then I wouldn&rsquo;t have a choice, because it&rsquo;s \u00a0\nthe law.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>Bex leaned against the counter, feeling lightheaded. She opened her \u00a0\nmouth to speak, but instead, she broke down. She tore her rubber gloves \n off, and threw them on the counter, covering her face with her hands. \nUntil this point, she&rsquo;d been completely numb. But now, she just couldn&rsquo;t\n take it any more. Her burden was too heavy.<br/></p><p>Ms. Fisher handed her a paper towel to dry her tears. &ldquo;Take your time. It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</p><p>Bex accepted the paper towel gratefully. She breathed through her \u00a0\nmouth, trying to calm herself. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m pregnant,&rdquo; she finally \nmumbled, once she was composed enough to speak.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; her teacher asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m pregnant,&rdquo; she repeated. Her face crumpled, and she \u00a0\nstarted to cry again. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m scared, and Bowie&rsquo;s gone, and I don&rsquo;t \u00a0\nknow where he is. I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo; She breathed shakily. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;Oh Bex,&rdquo; Ms. Fisher sighed. &ldquo;Have you taken a test?&rdquo;</p><p>She shook her head. &ldquo;No. But my period&rsquo;s late, and I&rsquo;m sick every morning. And I just feel&hellip; <i>different</i> inside.&rdquo; Unconsciously, her fingertips brushed below her navel.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Honey, you need to take a test and find out for sure,&rdquo; the young \u00a0\nteacher said calmly. &ldquo;If you are pregnant, you and the baby need medical\n \u00a0attention.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t buy a test,&rdquo; she fretted. &ldquo;Everyone in this town knows me. \u00a0\nPeople will talk, and it will get back to my parents, even if I&rsquo;m not \u00a0\npregnant.&rdquo; She ran her hands through her hair. &ldquo;My life is a mess. I \u00a0\ndon&rsquo;t know what to do. I&rsquo;m so <i>stupid!</i> How could I have let this happen?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. It will be okay,&rdquo; Ms Fisher assured her. &ldquo;And you are \u00a0\nmost certainly not stupid, Bex. You&rsquo;re just young, and you made a \u00a0\nmistake. You may even be worrying for nothing. There&rsquo;s no sense in \u00a0\npanicking until you take a test.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I told you, I can&rsquo;t buy one,&rdquo; she said. Her hands shook.</p><p>There was a long moment of silence, then Ms. Fisher spoke up. &ldquo;I want\n \u00a0to help you, Bex. But if I do, I need your promise that you won&rsquo;t tell\n \u00a0anyone. If you do, I could lose my job.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I would never do anything to get you in trouble,&rdquo; Bex said \nsincerely. &ldquo;I promise. You&rsquo;re my favorite teacher.&rdquo; Her nose was \nrunning. She wiped it with the paper towel.<br/></p><p>The young woman nodded. &ldquo;Leave your camera bag in your photography \u00a0\ncubby tomorrow. There will be a test in it by the time you have class.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d really do that for me?&rdquo; Bex asked in disbelief.</p><p>&ldquo;I care about you,&rdquo; Ms. Fisher said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy to help you. Just remember, this is our secret.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tell anyone,&rdquo; Bex said, crossing her heart. &ldquo;You have my word.&rdquo; Tentatively, she gave Ms. Fisher a hug. <br/></p><p>****</p><p>The next day, there was a pregnancy test tucked safely in the bottom \n of Bex&rsquo;s camera bag, just as Ms. Fisher had promised. Bex brought it \u00a0\nhome without saying a word to anyone. When she got home, she closed \u00a0\nherself in the bathroom and tore the slim box open. She read the \ninstructions included. They seemed simple enough. Pee on the stick. \nWait. If a second pink line appears, you&rsquo;re pregnant. If it doesn&rsquo;t, go \non being a relatively carefree teenage girl.</p><p>Bex&rsquo;s hands trembled hard as she tugged her pants down and sat on the\n toilet. She could barely hold onto the test. When she was finished \ntaking it, she set it on the counter. Waiting was the hardest part. \nThree seconds had passed, and she was already going crazy. She paced in \nthe small bathroom, counting down in her head until the test would be \nready.<br/></p><p>Finally, it was time. She squeezed her eyes shut, wishing for&hellip; she \ndidn&rsquo;t know what. She took a few deep breaths, trying to mentally \nprepare herself. Then, she forced herself to go to the counter, her hand\n covering her eyes. She pried her fingers away from her face, slowly. \nHer stomach dropped to her feet. There were two pink lines. It was \npositive.<br/></p><p>All at once, she saw her future fly out the window. She didn&rsquo;t care \nmuch about school, although she had been accepted into community \ncollege, but there were so many other things she wanted to do with her \nlife, so many things she wanted to experience. How could she do anything\n she&rsquo;d dreamed of now? She was going to have a baby; there was a tiny \nhuman growing inside her. She grasped the test in her hand, and sat down\n on the edge of the bathtub, too numb and too stunned to cry.</p><p> She knew in her heart of hearts that she was pregnant, even without a test, but <i>seeing </i>it\n and having it confirmed was overwhelming. She was carrying Bowie&rsquo;s \nbaby. Bowie, who didn&rsquo;t want to be tied down, who didn&rsquo;t like or want \nchildren. If he knew, he&rsquo;d think she&rsquo;d gotten pregnant on purpose, to \nkeep him there. She could never tell them. But that meant their baby \nwould grow up without a father. These thoughts ran through her head \nagain and again. She was going to be a single mother, to a fatherless \nchild, at just barely seventeen. She was practically a baby herself. She\n didn&rsquo;t even do her own laundry. <br/></p><p>She let that sink in, and her tears finally came. When she was all \ncried out, though, she realized, strangely, that a small part of her<i> wasn&rsquo;t</i> devastated. This was Bowie&rsquo;s baby, and she loved Bowie with all her heart. He may not care about her anymore, and her parents were sure to hate her once they found out, but her baby would <i>always </i>love her. It would always need her. Part of her <i>wanted </i>that unconditional love, when everyone else had failed her.<br/></p><p>She dried her eyes with a piece of toilet paper, then wiped the \npregnancy test clean. She brought it to her room and took out her memory\n box. There was a secret compartment in the lid, which was where she hid\n her most precious memories, the ones that were just for her eyes. She \nopened it carefully. There, tucked inside were Bowie&rsquo;s letter, which was\n now worn around the edges from her reading it so many times, and the \nphotograph of the two of them. She added her positive pregnancy test to \nthat small collection and secured the false lid. Then, she curled up on \nher bed. Her head ached. Staring at the wall, her parents crept back \ninto her mind, and her fears and doubts came crashing in once again. \nBecause at some point, she&rsquo;d have to tell Ham and Celia. If she lived to\n see eighteen, it would be a miracle.</p><p>****</p><p>&ldquo;Bex?&rdquo; Ham called. &ldquo;Honey? Answer me, please?&rdquo; He knocked hard on his\n daughter&rsquo;s bedroom door. Bex had been sulking in her room all weekend. \nAnd when she did emerge from her room, she was sullen and out of sorts, \nready to pick a fight with her mother over even the smallest things. The\n night before, he&rsquo;d walked past her closed bedroom door and heard her \ncrying inside. Bex wasn&rsquo;t a perfect angel, but these mood swings were \nextreme, even for her. And frankly, he was getting concerned. Especially\n after&hellip; well, he didn&rsquo;t want to think about it. But he knew he had to \nface it eventually, and now was as good a time as any. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming in!&rdquo;</p><p>He entered Bex&rsquo;s room and found her curled up on her bed in a fetal \nposition. &ldquo;Honey, are you okay?&rdquo; he asked. She didn&rsquo;t answer. He came to\n her bedside and sat down, placing his hand gently on her shoulder. She \ndidn&rsquo;t stir.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Sweetheart, I&rsquo;m worried about you,&rdquo; he said softly, knowing he would\n have to tread carefully. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re having a difficult time since \nBowie left. I can&rsquo;t imagine what you&rsquo;re feeling. But if you want to \ntalk, I&rsquo;m here to listen. No judgement. All I want is to help you.&rdquo;</p><p>She finally rolled over. Her face was tear-stained and puffy. Dark \ncircles framed her beautiful eyes. It made Ham sad to see her like that.\n She had always been so full of life, and energy. She kept him young. \n&ldquo;Bex, is there something you need to tell me?&rdquo; he asked. The question \nhung heavily in the air.<br/></p><p>Their eyes met, and Bex broke down. Her body shook as she cried.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, sweetheart,&rdquo; Ham sighed, taking her in his arms. She clung to \nhim like a small child. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Daddy&rsquo;s here.&rdquo; He \nrocked her slowly. &ldquo;You can say it, baby. It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</p><p>Bex held onto him until her tears subsided a little. He rubbed her back, cradling her in his arms. <br/></p><p>Finally, she parted from him, looking down. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pregnant, dad.&rdquo; She \nsaid it quietly. She covered her face with her hands and let out a sob \nthat broke his heart.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, sweetie,&rdquo; he nodded grimly, his suspicions confirmed. &ldquo;I know.&rdquo; <br/></p><p>She looked up at him through parted fingers. &ldquo;You <i>know?</i> How?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know the signs,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been sick, and tired. And\n I saw the search history on the computer. I just put two and two \ntogether.&rdquo;</p><p>Panic and fear crossed Bex&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Does mom know?&rdquo;</p><p>He shook his head. &ldquo;No, baby. I wouldn&rsquo;t tell her like that.&rdquo; He took her hands in his. &ldquo;You know you <i>will </i>have to tell her, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Her body tensed, and fresh tears spilled down her cheeks. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; She shook her head. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll kill me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t kill you. You know how much she hates stains on the \ncarpet.&rdquo; His feeble attempt at a joke to lighten the moment failed to \nmake her smile.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll kick me out of the house.&rdquo; She was so upset, she was trembling.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t let that happen,&rdquo; he promised, taking her back in his arms. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry about that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so scared,&rdquo; she sniffled.</p><p>&ldquo;I know you are,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m here, honey. I&rsquo;ll be right there \nwith you when you tell her.&rdquo; He kissed the side of her head. &ldquo;Does Bowie\n know? That&rsquo;s not why he left, is it?&rdquo;</p><p>She shook her head. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know. I didn&rsquo;t find out until he was already gone.&rdquo;</p><p>Ham breathed a sigh of relief. He liked Bowie, and wanted to believe \nthe boy truly loved and cared about his daughter. &ldquo;You need to tell him,\n Bex.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t want to be tied down. He said so. \nBesides, I don&rsquo;t know where he is, and he doesn&rsquo;t answer my calls.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There are ways to find him,&rdquo; he pointed out. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to track him down.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please, dad. No,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;Just let him go. I never want him to know.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>Ham nodded. He thought Bowie would step up and do the right thing if \nhe knew, but he didn&rsquo;t want to push the issue. And maybe Bex was right \nin this case. If Bowie were around, Celia would force the kids to get \nmarried. He didn&rsquo;t want to see his daughter pushed into a possibly \nunhappy marriage so young. What kind of life would she have then? &ldquo;Have \nyou decided what you&rsquo;re going to do? It&rsquo;s your choice, honey. Whatever \nyou choose, I support you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m keeping the baby,&rdquo; she said, sure of herself, as if she&rsquo;d given \nit a lot of thought. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a part of me, and of Bowie.&rdquo; She touched her \nstomach softly. &ldquo;I still love him, dad. And I already love my baby.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>&ldquo;I know you do.&rdquo; He squeezed her hand. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll figure things out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, dad,&rdquo; she choked. Her chin trembled. &ldquo;I never wanted \nto disappoint you. You&rsquo;re the only person who really loves and \nunderstands me, and I blew it. If you hate me now, I understand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh Bex,&rdquo; he sighed, as his daughter began to cry again. &ldquo;Sweetheart, I can&rsquo;t lie. I <i>am</i>\n disappointed, but only because you&rsquo;re so bright and creative, and I \nwant you to have the best future possible. But accidents happen, I know \nthat. Nothing could ever make me hate you.<i> Ever.</i> You&rsquo;re my baby girl, and I love you no matter what.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too, dad,&rdquo; Bex said, wiping her eyes on her sleeve.</p><p>&ldquo;I\n know you don&rsquo;t want to, but you really do have to tell mom as soon as \npossible,&rdquo; he said calmly. &ldquo;The longer you wait, the harder it will be. \nI&rsquo;ll give you a day or two to gather your thoughts, but just promise me \nyou&rsquo;ll think about it. Okay?&rdquo;</p><p>She nodded. &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>****</p><p>Celia\n walked into her daughter&rsquo;s room and looked around. It was messy, but \nthat was normal for Rebecca. Something was going on though, she knew it.\n A mother always knew. And she intended to find out what that something \nwas. There was nothing wrong with searching her daughter&rsquo;s room, she \nthought. It was called being a good parent. Her own mother had done the \nsame thing when she was young, and she turned out just fine. <br/></p><p>She\n opened the closet and looked inside, pushing the clothes that were \nactually hanging aside, feeling around in a few jacket pockets. She \nfound a handful of Tootsie Rolls in the toe of one of Rebecca&rsquo;s combat \nboots, but that was about it. She closed the closet exactly as it had \nbeen, and went to the bed.</p><p>Kneeling on the rug, she lifted the \nblue dust ruffle, and wrinkled her nose in disgust. The floor was \nlittered with empty chip bags, dirty socks, magazines, and dust bunnies.\n But that seemed to be all there was. She stood up and lifted the \nmattress. There was nothing hidden under it. Rebecca was much too smart \nto hide anything important in such an obvious place, though.</p><p>She \nwent to the desk next, and opened the drawers, taking care not to \ndisturb anything. There wasn&rsquo;t much inside. Old school papers, a photo \nalbum, colored pencils, and a collection of plastic trolls. She went \nthrough each drawer slowly, leafing through books and notebooks. Then \nshe got to the bottom drawer. It held Rebecca&rsquo;s memory box. Bingo. <br/></p><p>She\n sat down at the desk, and opened the lid on the wooden cigar box. It \nwas stuff with photos, ticket stubs, and other souvenirs. Normal things a\n young girl would keep. But her instincts told her that wasn&rsquo;t all that \nwas stored inside. She carefully looked through everything, until she \nreached the bottom. She couldn&rsquo;t believe it when nothing turned up that \nexplained her daughter&rsquo;s behavior as of late. She was positive she&rsquo;d \nfind something. Sighing, she put everything back as it was, and shut the\n lid. Her fingers paused against the latch. Something had rattled \ninside. She shook the box carefully, holding it to her ear, and heard \nthe hollow sound again. <br/></p><p>She reopened the box, and felt around\n the lid. There was a thumbtack stuck in it, holding an old fortune \ncookie paper in place. She pulled on the tack, and the whole blessed lid\n came loose. There was a false panel inside. She was at the point of no \nreturn now. She reminded herself again that teenagers couldn&rsquo;t be \ntrusted; they lied, kept secrets; that she was just being a good mom.</p><p>There\n was a photo inside. A snapshot of Rebecca and Bowie. In spite of \nherself, a small smile crept to her lips. Her daughter had looked so \nhappy in the picture, as if she were lit up from the inside. She rarely \nsaw that smile anymore. There was also a letter in an envelope. She \nopened it, and eased the papers out, unfolding them in her lap. She \nskimmed the messily scrawled words, her eyes widening with horror, as \nphrases jumped out at her.<i> I&rsquo;ll never forget the first time we made \nlove, how beautiful you looked, how soft your skin was&hellip;Hearing you \nwhisper my name as we looked into each other&rsquo;s eyes&hellip;. Waking up with \nyou in my arms the next morning&hellip;I wish we could relive last night for \nthe rest of our lives. </i>The letter was signed, <i>I&rsquo;ll always love you, now and forever, Bowie.</i></p><p>Celia&rsquo;s\n stomach dropped, and she felt sick. She couldn&rsquo;t read any more. She \nwent to put the letter back in it&rsquo;s envelope, and realized there was \nsomething else tucked in the bottom of it. She stuck her fingers inside \nand pried that object out. She immediately wished she hadn&rsquo;t. It was a \nhome pregnancy test, with two faded pink lines. &ldquo;No. Dear god, no.&rdquo;<br/></p>",

This time, \nshe got a message that his mailbox was full.</p>[[MORE]]<p>The only bad thing about spending so much time in the darkroom was \nthat the solitude of the place left her alone with her thoughts. \u00a0As she\n bathed her photo in water, she thought of the inescapable mess \u00a0she was\n in. She felt as if the weight of the world were on her shoulders, and \nshe was crushing beneath it\u2019s pressure.<br></p><p>As she worked, the photograph blurred before her eyes, and she \nrealized she was crying. Tears ran down her cheeks, leaving streaks in \nher makeup. She tried to brush them away \u00a0with her forearm. <br></p><p>\u201cBex? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>She jumped. She\u2019d almost forgotten Ms. Fisher was also in the room \nworking, it had been so quiet. The teacher frowned at her with concern.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she told her quickly, keeping her head down, unable to meet her teacher\u2019s eyes. <br></p><p>Ms. Fisher gave her a sympathetic look. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been yourself \u00a0\nlately, Bex. I\u2019m worried about you. Breakups are hard, honey.\u201d Everyone \nhad heard about Bowie leaving by then. The teacher paused sadly. \u201cIf \nyou\u2019re <i>not </i>fine, and you ever need someone to talk \u00a0to about anything at all, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Bex chewed her lip, wondering if she could trust her teacher with her\n \u00a0secret. Her instincts told her she could, and it would be a relief to \nhave someone to confide in. But she was still hesitant. \u00a0\"How do I know \nyou won\u2019t just tell my parents whatever I tell you?\u201c</p><p>\"You don\u2019t know,\u201d Ms. Fisher told her. \u201cYou just have to trust me. \u00a0\nBut I promise you, I wouldn\u2019t say anything to anyone, unless you or \u00a0\nsomeone else is in danger. Then I wouldn\u2019t have a choice, because it\u2019s \u00a0\nthe law.\u201d<br></p><p>Bex leaned against the counter, feeling lightheaded. She opened her \u00a0\nmouth to speak, but instead, she broke down. She tore her rubber gloves \n off, and threw them on the counter, covering her face with her hands. \nUntil this point, she\u2019d been completely numb. But now, she just couldn\u2019t\n take it any more. Her burden was too heavy.<br></p><p>Ms. Fisher handed her a paper towel to dry her tears. \u201cTake your time. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Bex accepted the paper towel gratefully. She breathed through her \u00a0\nmouth, trying to calm herself. \u201cI think I\u2019m pregnant,\u201d she finally \nmumbled, once she was composed enough to speak.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d her teacher asked.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m pregnant,\u201d she repeated. Her face crumpled, and she \u00a0\nstarted to cry again. \u201cAnd I\u2019m scared, and Bowie\u2019s gone, and I don\u2019t \u00a0\nknow where he is. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d She breathed shakily. <br></p><p>\u201cOh Bex,\u201d Ms. Fisher sighed. \u201cHave you taken a test?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. But my period\u2019s late, and I\u2019m sick every morning. And I just feel\u2026 <i>different</i> inside.\u201d Unconsciously, her fingertips brushed below her navel.<br></p><p>\u201cHoney, you need to take a test and find out for sure,\u201d the young \u00a0\nteacher said calmly. \u201cIf you are pregnant, you and the baby need medical\n \u00a0attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t buy a test,\u201d she fretted. \u201cEveryone in this town knows me. \u00a0\nPeople will talk, and it will get back to my parents, even if I\u2019m not \u00a0\npregnant.\u201d She ran her hands through her hair. \u201cMy life is a mess. I \u00a0\ndon\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m so <i>stupid!</i> How could I have let this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It will be okay,\u201d Ms Fisher assured her. \u201cAnd you are \u00a0\nmost certainly not stupid, Bex. You\u2019re just young, and you made a \u00a0\nmistake. You may even be worrying for nothing. There\u2019s no sense in \u00a0\npanicking until you take a test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I can\u2019t buy one,\u201d she said. Her hands shook.</p><p>There was a long moment of silence, then Ms. Fisher spoke up. \u201cI want\n \u00a0to help you, Bex. But if I do, I need your promise that you won\u2019t tell\n \u00a0anyone. If you do, I could lose my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never do anything to get you in trouble,\u201d Bex said \nsincerely. \u201cI promise. You\u2019re my favorite teacher.\u201d Her nose was \nrunning. She wiped it with the paper towel.<br></p><p>The young woman nodded. \u201cLeave your camera bag in your photography \u00a0\ncubby tomorrow. There will be a test in it by the time you have class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d really do that for me?\u201d Bex asked in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cI care about you,\u201d Ms. Fisher said. \u201cI\u2019m happy to help you. Just remember, this is our secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d Bex said, crossing her heart. \u201cYou have my word.\u201d Tentatively, she gave Ms. Fisher a hug. <br></p><p>****</p><p>The next day, there was a pregnancy test tucked safely in the bottom \n of Bex\u2019s camera bag, just as Ms. Fisher had promised. Bex brought it \u00a0\nhome without saying a word to anyone. When she got home, she closed \u00a0\nherself in the bathroom and tore the slim box open. She read the \ninstructions included. They seemed simple enough. Pee on the stick. \nWait. If a second pink line appears, you\u2019re pregnant. If it doesn\u2019t, go \non being a relatively carefree teenage girl.</p><p>Bex\u2019s hands trembled hard as she tugged her pants down and sat on the\n toilet. She could barely hold onto the test. When she was finished \ntaking it, she set it on the counter. Waiting was the hardest part. \nThree seconds had passed, and she was already going crazy. She paced in \nthe small bathroom, counting down in her head until the test would be \nready.<br></p><p>Finally, it was time. She squeezed her eyes shut, wishing for\u2026 she \ndidn\u2019t know what. She took a few deep breaths, trying to mentally \nprepare herself. Then, she forced herself to go to the counter, her hand\n covering her eyes. She pried her fingers away from her face, slowly. \nHer stomach dropped to her feet. There were two pink lines. It was \npositive.<br></p><p>All at once, she saw her future fly out the window. She didn\u2019t care \nmuch about school, although she had been accepted into community \ncollege, but there were so many other things she wanted to do with her \nlife, so many things she wanted to experience. How could she do anything\n she\u2019d dreamed of now? She was going to have a baby; there was a tiny \nhuman growing inside her. She grasped the test in her hand, and sat down\n on the edge of the bathtub, too numb and too stunned to cry.</p><p> She knew in her heart of hearts that she was pregnant, even without a test, but <i>seeing </i>it\n and having it confirmed was overwhelming. She was carrying Bowie\u2019s \nbaby. Bowie, who didn\u2019t want to be tied down, who didn\u2019t like or want \nchildren. If he knew, he\u2019d think she\u2019d gotten pregnant on purpose, to \nkeep him there. She could never tell them. But that meant their baby \nwould grow up without a father. These thoughts ran through her head \nagain and again. She was going to be a single mother, to a fatherless \nchild, at just barely seventeen. She was practically a baby herself. She\n didn\u2019t even do her own laundry. <br></p><p>She let that sink in, and her tears finally came. When she was all \ncried out, though, she realized, strangely, that a small part of her<i> wasn\u2019t</i> devastated. This was Bowie\u2019s baby, and she loved Bowie with all her heart. He may not care about her anymore, and her parents were sure to hate her once they found out, but her baby would <i>always </i>love her. It would always need her. Part of her <i>wanted </i>that unconditional love, when everyone else had failed her.<br></p><p>She dried her eyes with a piece of toilet paper, then wiped the \npregnancy test clean. She brought it to her room and took out her memory\n box. There was a secret compartment in the lid, which was where she hid\n her most precious memories, the ones that were just for her eyes. She \nopened it carefully. There, tucked inside were Bowie\u2019s letter, which was\n now worn around the edges from her reading it so many times, and the \nphotograph of the two of them. She added her positive pregnancy test to \nthat small collection and secured the false lid. Then, she curled up on \nher bed. Her head ached. Staring at the wall, her parents crept back \ninto her mind, and her fears and doubts came crashing in once again. \nBecause at some point, she\u2019d have to tell Ham and Celia. If she lived to\n see eighteen, it would be a miracle.</p><p>****</p><p>\u201cBex?\u201d Ham called. \u201cHoney? Answer me, please?\u201d He knocked hard on his\n daughter\u2019s bedroom door. Bex had been sulking in her room all weekend. \nAnd when she did emerge from her room, she was sullen and out of sorts, \nready to pick a fight with her mother over even the smallest things. The\n night before, he\u2019d walked past her closed bedroom door and heard her \ncrying inside. Bex wasn\u2019t a perfect angel, but these mood swings were \nextreme, even for her. And frankly, he was getting concerned. Especially\n after\u2026 well, he didn\u2019t want to think about it. But he knew he had to \nface it eventually, and now was as good a time as any. \u201cI\u2019m coming in!\u201d</p><p>He entered Bex\u2019s room and found her curled up on her bed in a fetal \nposition. \u201cHoney, are you okay?\u201d he asked. She didn\u2019t answer. He came to\n her bedside and sat down, placing his hand gently on her shoulder. She \ndidn\u2019t stir.<br></p><p>\u201cSweetheart, I\u2019m worried about you,\u201d he said softly, knowing he would\n have to tread carefully. \u201cI know you\u2019re having a difficult time since \nBowie left. I can\u2019t imagine what you\u2019re feeling. But if you want to \ntalk, I\u2019m here to listen. No judgement. All I want is to help you.\u201d</p><p>She finally rolled over. Her face was tear-stained and puffy. Dark \ncircles framed her beautiful eyes. It made Ham sad to see her like that.\n She had always been so full of life, and energy. She kept him young. \n\u201cBex, is there something you need to tell me?\u201d he asked. The question \nhung heavily in the air.<br></p><p>Their eyes met, and Bex broke down. Her body shook as she cried.<br></p><p>\u201cOh, sweetheart,\u201d Ham sighed, taking her in his arms. She clung to \nhim like a small child. \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he whispered. \u201cDaddy\u2019s here.\u201d He \nrocked her slowly. \u201cYou can say it, baby. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Bex held onto him until her tears subsided a little. He rubbed her back, cradling her in his arms. <br></p><p>Finally, she parted from him, looking down. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant, dad.\u201d She \nsaid it quietly. She covered her face with her hands and let out a sob \nthat broke his heart.</p><p>\u201cI know, sweetie,\u201d he nodded grimly, his suspicions confirmed. \u201cI know.\u201d <br></p><p>She looked up at him through parted fingers. \u201cYou <i>know?</i> How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the signs,\u201d he said gently. \u201cYou\u2019ve been sick, and tired. And\n I saw the search history on the computer. I just put two and two \ntogether.\u201d</p><p>Panic and fear crossed Bex\u2019s face. \u201cDoes mom know?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, baby. I wouldn\u2019t tell her like that.\u201d He took her hands in his. \u201cYou know you <i>will </i>have to tell her, right?\u201d</p><p>Her body tensed, and fresh tears spilled down her cheeks. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cShe\u2019ll kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t kill you. You know how much she hates stains on the \ncarpet.\u201d His feeble attempt at a joke to lighten the moment failed to \nmake her smile.<br></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll kick me out of the house.\u201d She was so upset, she was trembling.<br></p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t let that happen,\u201d he promised, taking her back in his arms. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so scared,\u201d she sniffled.</p><p>\u201cI know you are,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m here, honey. I\u2019ll be right there \nwith you when you tell her.\u201d He kissed the side of her head. \u201cDoes Bowie\n know? That\u2019s not why he left, is it?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t find out until he was already gone.\u201d</p><p>Ham breathed a sigh of relief. He liked Bowie, and wanted to believe \nthe boy truly loved and cared about his daughter. \u201cYou need to tell him,\n Bex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to be tied down. He said so. \nBesides, I don\u2019t know where he is, and he doesn\u2019t answer my calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are ways to find him,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be too hard to track him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, dad. No,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cJust let him go. I never want him to know.\u201d<br></p><p>Ham nodded. He thought Bowie would step up and do the right thing if \nhe knew, but he didn\u2019t want to push the issue. And maybe Bex was right \nin this case. If Bowie were around, Celia would force the kids to get \nmarried. He didn\u2019t want to see his daughter pushed into a possibly \nunhappy marriage so young. What kind of life would she have then? \u201cHave \nyou decided what you\u2019re going to do? It\u2019s your choice, honey. Whatever \nyou choose, I support you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m keeping the baby,\u201d she said, sure of herself, as if she\u2019d given \nit a lot of thought. \u201cIt\u2019s a part of me, and of Bowie.\u201d She touched her \nstomach softly. \u201cI still love him, dad. And I already love my baby.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI know you do.\u201d He squeezed her hand. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure things out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, dad,\u201d she choked. Her chin trembled. \u201cI never wanted \nto disappoint you. You\u2019re the only person who really loves and \nunderstands me, and I blew it. If you hate me now, I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Bex,\u201d he sighed, as his daughter began to cry again. \u201cSweetheart, I can\u2019t lie. I <i>am</i>\n disappointed, but only because you\u2019re so bright and creative, and I \nwant you to have the best future possible. But accidents happen, I know \nthat. Nothing could ever make me hate you.<i> Ever.</i> You\u2019re my baby girl, and I love you no matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, dad,\u201d Bex said, wiping her eyes on her sleeve.</p><p>\u201cI\n know you don\u2019t want to, but you really do have to tell mom as soon as \npossible,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cThe longer you wait, the harder it will be. \nI\u2019ll give you a day or two to gather your thoughts, but just promise me \nyou\u2019ll think about it. Okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>****</p><p>Celia\n walked into her daughter\u2019s room and looked around. It was messy, but \nthat was normal for Rebecca. Something was going on though, she knew it.\n A mother always knew. And she intended to find out what that something \nwas. There was nothing wrong with searching her daughter\u2019s room, she \nthought. It was called being a good parent. Her own mother had done the \nsame thing when she was young, and she turned out just fine. <br></p><p>She\n opened the closet and looked inside, pushing the clothes that were \nactually hanging aside, feeling around in a few jacket pockets. She \nfound a handful of Tootsie Rolls in the toe of one of Rebecca\u2019s combat \nboots, but that was about it. She closed the closet exactly as it had \nbeen, and went to the bed.</p><p>Kneeling on the rug, she lifted the \nblue dust ruffle, and wrinkled her nose in disgust. The floor was \nlittered with empty chip bags, dirty socks, magazines, and dust bunnies.\n But that seemed to be all there was. She stood up and lifted the \nmattress. There was nothing hidden under it. Rebecca was much too smart \nto hide anything important in such an obvious place, though.</p><p>She \nwent to the desk next, and opened the drawers, taking care not to \ndisturb anything. There wasn\u2019t much inside. Old school papers, a photo \nalbum, colored pencils, and a collection of plastic trolls. She went \nthrough each drawer slowly, leafing through books and notebooks. Then \nshe got to the bottom drawer. It held Rebecca\u2019s memory box. Bingo. <br></p><p>She\n sat down at the desk, and opened the lid on the wooden cigar box. It \nwas stuff with photos, ticket stubs, and other souvenirs. Normal things a\n young girl would keep. But her instincts told her that wasn\u2019t all that \nwas stored inside. She carefully looked through everything, until she \nreached the bottom. She couldn\u2019t believe it when nothing turned up that \nexplained her daughter\u2019s behavior as of late. She was positive she\u2019d \nfind something. Sighing, she put everything back as it was, and shut the\n lid. Her fingers paused against the latch. Something had rattled \ninside. She shook the box carefully, holding it to her ear, and heard \nthe hollow sound again. <br></p><p>She reopened the box, and felt around\n the lid. There was a thumbtack stuck in it, holding an old fortune \ncookie paper in place. She pulled on the tack, and the whole blessed lid\n came loose. There was a false panel inside. She was at the point of no \nreturn now. She reminded herself again that teenagers couldn\u2019t be \ntrusted; they lied, kept secrets; that she was just being a good mom.</p><p>There\n was a photo inside. A snapshot of Rebecca and Bowie. In spite of \nherself, a small smile crept to her lips. Her daughter had looked so \nhappy in the picture, as if she were lit up from the inside. She rarely \nsaw that smile anymore. There was also a letter in an envelope. She \nopened it, and eased the papers out, unfolding them in her lap. She \nskimmed the messily scrawled words, her eyes widening with horror, as \nphrases jumped out at her.<i> I\u2019ll never forget the first time we made \nlove, how beautiful you looked, how soft your skin was\u2026Hearing you \nwhisper my name as we looked into each other\u2019s eyes\u2026. Waking up with \nyou in my arms the next morning\u2026I wish we could relive last night for \nthe rest of our lives. </i>The letter was signed, <i>I\u2019ll always love you, now and forever, Bowie.</i></p><p>Celia\u2019s\n stomach dropped, and she felt sick. She couldn\u2019t read any more. She \nwent to put the letter back in it\u2019s envelope, and realized there was \nsomething else tucked in the bottom of it. She stuck her fingers inside \nand pried that object out. She immediately wished she hadn\u2019t. It was a \nhome pregnancy test, with two faded pink lines. \u201cNo. Dear god, no.\u201d<br></p>",

Two Pink Lines<br></p><p>Now that Bex didn\u2019t have any friends, she spent her lunch period \u00a0\nholed away in the school\u2019s darkroom, developing depressing photos. In \u00a0\nthere, the loneliness didn\u2019t feel so lonely. The photography room became\n \u00a0her safe haven, in a place where everything reminded her of Bowie, \nfrom the hallway lockers to the gym. <br></p><p>She still hadn\u2019t heard from him. It had been almost a week since he\u2019d\n left. The day before, she\u2019d asked her dad how many days it takes to \ndrive from Shadyside to Los Angeles. Being who he was, her sat down with\n her, and took out a map to show her the distance. Accounting for stops,\n he said, two days was realistic. That meant that Bowie had had three \ndays to call her. He promised he would. But nothing. Finally, she \ncouldn\u2019t take the stress anymore, and she called <i>him</i>. It went \nstraight to voicemail. She tried him several more times, and got the \nsame. That morning, she\u2019d tried calling him one last time. This time, \nshe got a message that his mailbox was full.</p>[[MORE]]<p>The only bad thing about spending so much time in the darkroom was \nthat the solitude of the place left her alone with her thoughts. \u00a0As she\n bathed her photo in water, she thought of the inescapable mess \u00a0she was\n in. She felt as if the weight of the world were on her shoulders, and \nshe was crushing beneath it\u2019s pressure.<br></p><p>As she worked, the photograph blurred before her eyes, and she \nrealized she was crying. Tears ran down her cheeks, leaving streaks in \nher makeup. She tried to brush them away \u00a0with her forearm. <br></p><p>\u201cBex? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>She jumped. She\u2019d almost forgotten Ms. Fisher was also in the room \nworking, it had been so quiet. The teacher frowned at her with concern.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she told her quickly, keeping her head down, unable to meet her teacher\u2019s eyes. <br></p><p>Ms. Fisher gave her a sympathetic look. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been yourself \u00a0\nlately, Bex. I\u2019m worried about you. Breakups are hard, honey.\u201d Everyone \nhad heard about Bowie leaving by then. The teacher paused sadly. \u201cIf \nyou\u2019re <i>not </i>fine, and you ever need someone to talk \u00a0to about anything at all, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Bex chewed her lip, wondering if she could trust her teacher with her\n \u00a0secret. Her instincts told her she could, and it would be a relief to \nhave someone to confide in. But she was still hesitant. \u00a0\"How do I know \nyou won\u2019t just tell my parents whatever I tell you?\u201c</p><p>\"You don\u2019t know,\u201d Ms. Fisher told her. \u201cYou just have to trust me. \u00a0\nBut I promise you, I wouldn\u2019t say anything to anyone, unless you or \u00a0\nsomeone else is in danger. Then I wouldn\u2019t have a choice, because it\u2019s \u00a0\nthe law.\u201d<br></p><p>Bex leaned against the counter, feeling lightheaded. She opened her \u00a0\nmouth to speak, but instead, she broke down. She tore her rubber gloves \n off, and threw them on the counter, covering her face with her hands. \nUntil this point, she\u2019d been completely numb. But now, she just couldn\u2019t\n take it any more. Her burden was too heavy.<br></p><p>Ms. Fisher handed her a paper towel to dry her tears. \u201cTake your time. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Bex accepted the paper towel gratefully. She breathed through her \u00a0\nmouth, trying to calm herself. \u201cI think I\u2019m pregnant,\u201d she finally \nmumbled, once she was composed enough to speak.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d her teacher asked.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m pregnant,\u201d she repeated. Her face crumpled, and she \u00a0\nstarted to cry again. \u201cAnd I\u2019m scared, and Bowie\u2019s gone, and I don\u2019t \u00a0\nknow where he is. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d She breathed shakily. <br></p><p>\u201cOh Bex,\u201d Ms. Fisher sighed. \u201cHave you taken a test?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. But my period\u2019s late, and I\u2019m sick every morning. And I just feel\u2026 <i>different</i> inside.\u201d Unconsciously, her fingertips brushed below her navel.<br></p><p>\u201cHoney, you need to take a test and find out for sure,\u201d the young \u00a0\nteacher said calmly. \u201cIf you are pregnant, you and the baby need medical\n \u00a0attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t buy a test,\u201d she fretted. \u201cEveryone in this town knows me. \u00a0\nPeople will talk, and it will get back to my parents, even if I\u2019m not \u00a0\npregnant.\u201d She ran her hands through her hair. \u201cMy life is a mess. I \u00a0\ndon\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m so <i>stupid!</i> How could I have let this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It will be okay,\u201d Ms Fisher assured her. \u201cAnd you are \u00a0\nmost certainly not stupid, Bex. You\u2019re just young, and you made a \u00a0\nmistake. You may even be worrying for nothing. There\u2019s no sense in \u00a0\npanicking until you take a test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I can\u2019t buy one,\u201d she said. Her hands shook.</p><p>There was a long moment of silence, then Ms. Fisher spoke up. \u201cI want\n \u00a0to help you, Bex. But if I do, I need your promise that you won\u2019t tell\n \u00a0anyone. If you do, I could lose my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never do anything to get you in trouble,\u201d Bex said \nsincerely. \u201cI promise. You\u2019re my favorite teacher.\u201d Her nose was \nrunning. She wiped it with the paper towel.<br></p><p>The young woman nodded. \u201cLeave your camera bag in your photography \u00a0\ncubby tomorrow. There will be a test in it by the time you have class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d really do that for me?\u201d Bex asked in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cI care about you,\u201d Ms. Fisher said. \u201cI\u2019m happy to help you. Just remember, this is our secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d Bex said, crossing her heart. \u201cYou have my word.\u201d Tentatively, she gave Ms. Fisher a hug. <br></p><p>****</p><p>The next day, there was a pregnancy test tucked safely in the bottom \n of Bex\u2019s camera bag, just as Ms. Fisher had promised. Bex brought it \u00a0\nhome without saying a word to anyone. When she got home, she closed \u00a0\nherself in the bathroom and tore the slim box open. She read the \ninstructions included. They seemed simple enough. Pee on the stick. \nWait. If a second pink line appears, you\u2019re pregnant. If it doesn\u2019t, go \non being a relatively carefree teenage girl.</p><p>Bex\u2019s hands trembled hard as she tugged her pants down and sat on the\n toilet. She could barely hold onto the test. When she was finished \ntaking it, she set it on the counter. Waiting was the hardest part. \nThree seconds had passed, and she was already going crazy. She paced in \nthe small bathroom, counting down in her head until the test would be \nready.<br></p><p>Finally, it was time. She squeezed her eyes shut, wishing for\u2026 she \ndidn\u2019t know what. She took a few deep breaths, trying to mentally \nprepare herself. Then, she forced herself to go to the counter, her hand\n covering her eyes. She pried her fingers away from her face, slowly. \nHer stomach dropped to her feet. There were two pink lines. It was \npositive.<br></p><p>All at once, she saw her future fly out the window. She didn\u2019t care \nmuch about school, although she had been accepted into community \ncollege, but there were so many other things she wanted to do with her \nlife, so many things she wanted to experience. How could she do anything\n she\u2019d dreamed of now? She was going to have a baby; there was a tiny \nhuman growing inside her. She grasped the test in her hand, and sat down\n on the edge of the bathtub, too numb and too stunned to cry.</p><p> She knew in her heart of hearts that she was pregnant, even without a test, but <i>seeing </i>it\n and having it confirmed was overwhelming. She was carrying Bowie\u2019s \nbaby. Bowie, who didn\u2019t want to be tied down, who didn\u2019t like or want \nchildren. If he knew, he\u2019d think she\u2019d gotten pregnant on purpose, to \nkeep him there. She could never tell them. But that meant their baby \nwould grow up without a father. These thoughts ran through her head \nagain and again. She was going to be a single mother, to a fatherless \nchild, at just barely seventeen. She was practically a baby herself. She\n didn\u2019t even do her own laundry. <br></p><p>She let that sink in, and her tears finally came. When she was all \ncried out, though, she realized, strangely, that a small part of her<i> wasn\u2019t</i> devastated. This was Bowie\u2019s baby, and she loved Bowie with all her heart. He may not care about her anymore, and her parents were sure to hate her once they found out, but her baby would <i>always </i>love her. It would always need her. Part of her <i>wanted </i>that unconditional love, when everyone else had failed her.<br></p><p>She dried her eyes with a piece of toilet paper, then wiped the \npregnancy test clean. She brought it to her room and took out her memory\n box. There was a secret compartment in the lid, which was where she hid\n her most precious memories, the ones that were just for her eyes. She \nopened it carefully. There, tucked inside were Bowie\u2019s letter, which was\n now worn around the edges from her reading it so many times, and the \nphotograph of the two of them. She added her positive pregnancy test to \nthat small collection and secured the false lid. Then, she curled up on \nher bed. Her head ached. Staring at the wall, her parents crept back \ninto her mind, and her fears and doubts came crashing in once again. \nBecause at some point, she\u2019d have to tell Ham and Celia. If she lived to\n see eighteen, it would be a miracle.</p><p>****</p><p>\u201cBex?\u201d Ham called. \u201cHoney? Answer me, please?\u201d He knocked hard on his\n daughter\u2019s bedroom door. Bex had been sulking in her room all weekend. \nAnd when she did emerge from her room, she was sullen and out of sorts, \nready to pick a fight with her mother over even the smallest things. The\n night before, he\u2019d walked past her closed bedroom door and heard her \ncrying inside. Bex wasn\u2019t a perfect angel, but these mood swings were \nextreme, even for her. And frankly, he was getting concerned. Especially\n after\u2026 well, he didn\u2019t want to think about it. But he knew he had to \nface it eventually, and now was as good a time as any. \u201cI\u2019m coming in!\u201d</p><p>He entered Bex\u2019s room and found her curled up on her bed in a fetal \nposition. \u201cHoney, are you okay?\u201d he asked. She didn\u2019t answer. He came to\n her bedside and sat down, placing his hand gently on her shoulder. She \ndidn\u2019t stir.<br></p><p>\u201cSweetheart, I\u2019m worried about you,\u201d he said softly, knowing he would\n have to tread carefully. \u201cI know you\u2019re having a difficult time since \nBowie left. I can\u2019t imagine what you\u2019re feeling. But if you want to \ntalk, I\u2019m here to listen. No judgement. All I want is to help you.\u201d</p><p>She finally rolled over. Her face was tear-stained and puffy. Dark \ncircles framed her beautiful eyes. It made Ham sad to see her like that.\n She had always been so full of life, and energy. She kept him young. \n\u201cBex, is there something you need to tell me?\u201d he asked. The question \nhung heavily in the air.<br></p><p>Their eyes met, and Bex broke down. Her body shook as she cried.<br></p><p>\u201cOh, sweetheart,\u201d Ham sighed, taking her in his arms. She clung to \nhim like a small child. \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he whispered. \u201cDaddy\u2019s here.\u201d He \nrocked her slowly. \u201cYou can say it, baby. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Bex held onto him until her tears subsided a little. He rubbed her back, cradling her in his arms. <br></p><p>Finally, she parted from him, looking down. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant, dad.\u201d She \nsaid it quietly. She covered her face with her hands and let out a sob \nthat broke his heart.</p><p>\u201cI know, sweetie,\u201d he nodded grimly, his suspicions confirmed. \u201cI know.\u201d <br></p><p>She looked up at him through parted fingers. \u201cYou <i>know?</i> How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the signs,\u201d he said gently. \u201cYou\u2019ve been sick, and tired. And\n I saw the search history on the computer. I just put two and two \ntogether.\u201d</p><p>Panic and fear crossed Bex\u2019s face. \u201cDoes mom know?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, baby. I wouldn\u2019t tell her like that.\u201d He took her hands in his. \u201cYou know you <i>will </i>have to tell her, right?\u201d</p><p>Her body tensed, and fresh tears spilled down her cheeks. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cShe\u2019ll kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t kill you. You know how much she hates stains on the \ncarpet.\u201d His feeble attempt at a joke to lighten the moment failed to \nmake her smile.<br></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll kick me out of the house.\u201d She was so upset, she was trembling.<br></p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t let that happen,\u201d he promised, taking her back in his arms. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so scared,\u201d she sniffled.</p><p>\u201cI know you are,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m here, honey. I\u2019ll be right there \nwith you when you tell her.\u201d He kissed the side of her head. \u201cDoes Bowie\n know? That\u2019s not why he left, is it?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t find out until he was already gone.\u201d</p><p>Ham breathed a sigh of relief. He liked Bowie, and wanted to believe \nthe boy truly loved and cared about his daughter. \u201cYou need to tell him,\n Bex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to be tied down. He said so. \nBesides, I don\u2019t know where he is, and he doesn\u2019t answer my calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are ways to find him,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be too hard to track him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, dad. No,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cJust let him go. I never want him to know.\u201d<br></p><p>Ham nodded. He thought Bowie would step up and do the right thing if \nhe knew, but he didn\u2019t want to push the issue. And maybe Bex was right \nin this case. If Bowie were around, Celia would force the kids to get \nmarried. He didn\u2019t want to see his daughter pushed into a possibly \nunhappy marriage so young. What kind of life would she have then? \u201cHave \nyou decided what you\u2019re going to do? It\u2019s your choice, honey. Whatever \nyou choose, I support you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m keeping the baby,\u201d she said, sure of herself, as if she\u2019d given \nit a lot of thought. \u201cIt\u2019s a part of me, and of Bowie.\u201d She touched her \nstomach softly. \u201cI still love him, dad. And I already love my baby.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI know you do.\u201d He squeezed her hand. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure things out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, dad,\u201d she choked. Her chin trembled. \u201cI never wanted \nto disappoint you. You\u2019re the only person who really loves and \nunderstands me, and I blew it. If you hate me now, I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Bex,\u201d he sighed, as his daughter began to cry again. \u201cSweetheart, I can\u2019t lie. I <i>am</i>\n disappointed, but only because you\u2019re so bright and creative, and I \nwant you to have the best future possible. But accidents happen, I know \nthat. Nothing could ever make me hate you.<i> Ever.</i> You\u2019re my baby girl, and I love you no matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, dad,\u201d Bex said, wiping her eyes on her sleeve.</p><p>\u201cI\n know you don\u2019t want to, but you really do have to tell mom as soon as \npossible,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cThe longer you wait, the harder it will be. \nI\u2019ll give you a day or two to gather your thoughts, but just promise me \nyou\u2019ll think about it. Okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>****</p><p>Celia\n walked into her daughter\u2019s room and looked around. It was messy, but \nthat was normal for Rebecca. Something was going on though, she knew it.\n A mother always knew. And she intended to find out what that something \nwas. There was nothing wrong with searching her daughter\u2019s room, she \nthought. It was called being a good parent. Her own mother had done the \nsame thing when she was young, and she turned out just fine. <br></p><p>She\n opened the closet and looked inside, pushing the clothes that were \nactually hanging aside, feeling around in a few jacket pockets. She \nfound a handful of Tootsie Rolls in the toe of one of Rebecca\u2019s combat \nboots, but that was about it. She closed the closet exactly as it had \nbeen, and went to the bed.</p><p>Kneeling on the rug, she lifted the \nblue dust ruffle, and wrinkled her nose in disgust. The floor was \nlittered with empty chip bags, dirty socks, magazines, and dust bunnies.\n But that seemed to be all there was. She stood up and lifted the \nmattress. There was nothing hidden under it. Rebecca was much too smart \nto hide anything important in such an obvious place, though.</p><p>She \nwent to the desk next, and opened the drawers, taking care not to \ndisturb anything. There wasn\u2019t much inside. Old school papers, a photo \nalbum, colored pencils, and a collection of plastic trolls. She went \nthrough each drawer slowly, leafing through books and notebooks. Then \nshe got to the bottom drawer. It held Rebecca\u2019s memory box. Bingo. <br></p><p>She\n sat down at the desk, and opened the lid on the wooden cigar box. It \nwas stuff with photos, ticket stubs, and other souvenirs. Normal things a\n young girl would keep. But her instincts told her that wasn\u2019t all that \nwas stored inside. She carefully looked through everything, until she \nreached the bottom. She couldn\u2019t believe it when nothing turned up that \nexplained her daughter\u2019s behavior as of late. She was positive she\u2019d \nfind something. Sighing, she put everything back as it was, and shut the\n lid. Her fingers paused against the latch. Something had rattled \ninside. She shook the box carefully, holding it to her ear, and heard \nthe hollow sound again. <br></p><p>She reopened the box, and felt around\n the lid. There was a thumbtack stuck in it, holding an old fortune \ncookie paper in place. She pulled on the tack, and the whole blessed lid\n came loose. There was a false panel inside. She was at the point of no \nreturn now. She reminded herself again that teenagers couldn\u2019t be \ntrusted; they lied, kept secrets; that she was just being a good mom.</p><p>There\n was a photo inside. A snapshot of Rebecca and Bowie. In spite of \nherself, a small smile crept to her lips. Her daughter had looked so \nhappy in the picture, as if she were lit up from the inside. She rarely \nsaw that smile anymore. There was also a letter in an envelope. She \nopened it, and eased the papers out, unfolding them in her lap. She \nskimmed the messily scrawled words, her eyes widening with horror, as \nphrases jumped out at her.<i> I\u2019ll never forget the first time we made \nlove, how beautiful you looked, how soft your skin was\u2026Hearing you \nwhisper my name as we looked into each other\u2019s eyes\u2026.

She couldn\u2019t read any more. She \nwent to put the letter back in it\u2019s envelope, and realized there was \nsomething else tucked in the bottom of it. She stuck her fingers inside \nand pried that object out. She immediately wished she hadn\u2019t. It was a \nhome pregnancy test, with two faded pink lines. \u201cNo. Dear god, no.\u201d<br></p>",
                "content": "<p>Chapter 13. Two Pink Lines<br /></p><p>Now that Bex didn&rsquo;t have any friends, she spent her lunch period &nbsp;\nholed away in the school&rsquo;s darkroom, developing depressing photos. In &nbsp;\nthere, the loneliness didn&rsquo;t feel so lonely. The photography room became\n &nbsp;her safe haven, in a place where everything reminded her of Bowie, \nfrom the hallway lockers to the gym. <br /></p><p>She still hadn&rsquo;t heard from him. It had been almost a week since he&rsquo;d\n left. The day before, she&rsquo;d asked her dad how many days it takes to \ndrive from Shadyside to Los Angeles. Being who he was, her sat down with\n her, and took out a map to show her the distance. Accounting for stops,\n he said, two days was realistic. That meant that Bowie had had three \ndays to call her. He promised he would. But nothing. Finally, she \ncouldn&rsquo;t take the stress anymore, and she called <i>him</i>. It went \nstraight to voicemail. She tried him several more times, and got the \nsame. That morning, she&rsquo;d tried calling him one last time. This time, \nshe got a message that his mailbox was full.</p><p>The only bad thing about spending so much time in the darkroom was \nthat the solitude of the place left her alone with her thoughts. &nbsp;As she\n bathed her photo in water, she thought of the inescapable mess &nbsp;she was\n in. She felt as if the weight of the world were on her shoulders, and \nshe was crushing beneath it&rsquo;s pressure.<br /></p><p>As she worked, the photograph blurred before her eyes, and she \nrealized she was crying. Tears ran down her cheeks, leaving streaks in \nher makeup. She tried to brush them away &nbsp;with her forearm. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Bex? Are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>She jumped. She&rsquo;d almost forgotten Ms. Fisher was also in the room \nworking, it had been so quiet. The teacher frowned at her with concern.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; she told her quickly, keeping her head down, unable to meet her teacher&rsquo;s eyes. <br /></p><p>Ms. Fisher gave her a sympathetic look. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t been yourself &nbsp;\nlately, Bex. I&rsquo;m worried about you. Breakups are hard, honey.&rdquo; Everyone \nhad heard about Bowie leaving by then. The teacher paused sadly. &ldquo;If \nyou&rsquo;re <i>not </i>fine, and you ever need someone to talk &nbsp;to about anything at all, I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p><p>Bex chewed her lip, wondering if she could trust her teacher with her\n &nbsp;secret. Her instincts told her she could, and it would be a relief to \nhave someone to confide in. But she was still hesitant. &nbsp;\"How do I know \nyou won&rsquo;t just tell my parents whatever I tell you?&ldquo;</p><p>\"You don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Ms. Fisher told her. &ldquo;You just have to trust me. &nbsp;\nBut I promise you, I wouldn&rsquo;t say anything to anyone, unless you or &nbsp;\nsomeone else is in danger. Then I wouldn&rsquo;t have a choice, because it&rsquo;s &nbsp;\nthe law.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Bex leaned against the counter, feeling lightheaded. She opened her &nbsp;\nmouth to speak, but instead, she broke down. She tore her rubber gloves \n off, and threw them on the counter, covering her face with her hands. \nUntil this point, she&rsquo;d been completely numb. But now, she just couldn&rsquo;t\n take it any more. Her burden was too heavy.<br /></p><p>Ms. Fisher handed her a paper towel to dry her tears. &ldquo;Take your time. It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</p><p>Bex accepted the paper towel gratefully. She breathed through her &nbsp;\nmouth, trying to calm herself. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m pregnant,&rdquo; she finally \nmumbled, once she was composed enough to speak.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; her teacher asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m pregnant,&rdquo; she repeated. Her face crumpled, and she &nbsp;\nstarted to cry again. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m scared, and Bowie&rsquo;s gone, and I don&rsquo;t &nbsp;\nknow where he is. I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo; She breathed shakily. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh Bex,&rdquo; Ms. Fisher sighed. &ldquo;Have you taken a test?&rdquo;</p><p>She shook her head. &ldquo;No. But my period&rsquo;s late, and I&rsquo;m sick every morning. And I just feel&hellip; <i>different</i> inside.&rdquo; Unconsciously, her fingertips brushed below her navel.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Honey, you need to take a test and find out for sure,&rdquo; the young &nbsp;\nteacher said calmly. &ldquo;If you are pregnant, you and the baby need medical\n &nbsp;attention.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t buy a test,&rdquo; she fretted. &ldquo;Everyone in this town knows me. &nbsp;\nPeople will talk, and it will get back to my parents, even if I&rsquo;m not &nbsp;\npregnant.&rdquo; She ran her hands through her hair. &ldquo;My life is a mess. I &nbsp;\ndon&rsquo;t know what to do. I&rsquo;m so <i>stupid!</i> How could I have let this happen?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. It will be okay,&rdquo; Ms Fisher assured her. &ldquo;And you are &nbsp;\nmost certainly not stupid, Bex. You&rsquo;re just young, and you made a &nbsp;\nmistake. You may even be worrying for nothing. There&rsquo;s no sense in &nbsp;\npanicking until you take a test.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I told you, I can&rsquo;t buy one,&rdquo; she said. Her hands shook.</p><p>There was a long moment of silence, then Ms. Fisher spoke up. &ldquo;I want\n &nbsp;to help you, Bex. But if I do, I need your promise that you won&rsquo;t tell\n &nbsp;anyone. If you do, I could lose my job.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I would never do anything to get you in trouble,&rdquo; Bex said \nsincerely. &ldquo;I promise. You&rsquo;re my favorite teacher.&rdquo; Her nose was \nrunning. She wiped it with the paper towel.<br /></p><p>The young woman nodded. &ldquo;Leave your camera bag in your photography &nbsp;\ncubby tomorrow. There will be a test in it by the time you have class.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d really do that for me?&rdquo; Bex asked in disbelief.</p><p>&ldquo;I care about you,&rdquo; Ms. Fisher said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy to help you. Just remember, this is our secret.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tell anyone,&rdquo; Bex said, crossing her heart. &ldquo;You have my word.&rdquo; Tentatively, she gave Ms. Fisher a hug. <br /></p><p>****</p><p>The next day, there was a pregnancy test tucked safely in the bottom \n of Bex&rsquo;s camera bag, just as Ms. Fisher had promised. Bex brought it &nbsp;\nhome without saying a word to anyone. When she got home, she closed &nbsp;\nherself in the bathroom and tore the slim box open. She read the \ninstructions included. They seemed simple enough. Pee on the stick. \nWait. If a second pink line appears, you&rsquo;re pregnant. If it doesn&rsquo;t, go \non being a relatively carefree teenage girl.</p><p>Bex&rsquo;s hands trembled hard as she tugged her pants down and sat on the\n toilet. She could barely hold onto the test. When she was finished \ntaking it, she set it on the counter. Waiting was the hardest part. \nThree seconds had passed, and she was already going crazy. She paced in \nthe small bathroom, counting down in her head until the test would be \nready.<br /></p><p>Finally, it was time. She squeezed her eyes shut, wishing for&hellip; she \ndidn&rsquo;t know what. She took a few deep breaths, trying to mentally \nprepare herself. Then, she forced herself to go to the counter, her hand\n covering her eyes. She pried her fingers away from her face, slowly. \nHer stomach dropped to her feet. There were two pink lines. It was \npositive.<br /></p><p>All at once, she saw her future fly out the window. She didn&rsquo;t care \nmuch about school, although she had been accepted into community \ncollege, but there were so many other things she wanted to do with her \nlife, so many things she wanted to experience. How could she do anything\n she&rsquo;d dreamed of now? She was going to have a baby; there was a tiny \nhuman growing inside her. She grasped the test in her hand, and sat down\n on the edge of the bathtub, too numb and too stunned to cry.</p><p> She knew in her heart of hearts that she was pregnant, even without a test, but <i>seeing </i>it\n and having it confirmed was overwhelming. She was carrying Bowie&rsquo;s \nbaby. Bowie, who didn&rsquo;t want to be tied down, who didn&rsquo;t like or want \nchildren. If he knew, he&rsquo;d think she&rsquo;d gotten pregnant on purpose, to \nkeep him there. She could never tell them. But that meant their baby \nwould grow up without a father. These thoughts ran through her head \nagain and again. She was going to be a single mother, to a fatherless \nchild, at just barely seventeen. She was practically a baby herself. She\n didn&rsquo;t even do her own laundry. <br /></p><p>She let that sink in, and her tears finally came. When she was all \ncried out, though, she realized, strangely, that a small part of her<i> wasn&rsquo;t</i> devastated. This was Bowie&rsquo;s baby, and she loved Bowie with all her heart. He may not care about her anymore, and her parents were sure to hate her once they found out, but her baby would <i>always </i>love her. It would always need her. Part of her <i>wanted </i>that unconditional love, when everyone else had failed her.<br /></p><p>She dried her eyes with a piece of toilet paper, then wiped the \npregnancy test clean. She brought it to her room and took out her memory\n box. There was a secret compartment in the lid, which was where she hid\n her most precious memories, the ones that were just for her eyes. She \nopened it carefully. There, tucked inside were Bowie&rsquo;s letter, which was\n now worn around the edges from her reading it so many times, and the \nphotograph of the two of them. She added her positive pregnancy test to \nthat small collection and secured the false lid. Then, she curled up on \nher bed. Her head ached. Staring at the wall, her parents crept back \ninto her mind, and her fears and doubts came crashing in once again. \nBecause at some point, she&rsquo;d have to tell Ham and Celia. If she lived to\n see eighteen, it would be a miracle.</p><p>****</p><p>&ldquo;Bex?&rdquo; Ham called. &ldquo;Honey? Answer me, please?&rdquo; He knocked hard on his\n daughter&rsquo;s bedroom door. Bex had been sulking in her room all weekend. \nAnd when she did emerge from her room, she was sullen and out of sorts, \nready to pick a fight with her mother over even the smallest things. The\n night before, he&rsquo;d walked past her closed bedroom door and heard her \ncrying inside. Bex wasn&rsquo;t a perfect angel, but these mood swings were \nextreme, even for her. And frankly, he was getting concerned. Especially\n after&hellip; well, he didn&rsquo;t want to think about it. But he knew he had to \nface it eventually, and now was as good a time as any. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming in!&rdquo;</p><p>He entered Bex&rsquo;s room and found her curled up on her bed in a fetal \nposition. &ldquo;Honey, are you okay?&rdquo; he asked. She didn&rsquo;t answer. He came to\n her bedside and sat down, placing his hand gently on her shoulder. She \ndidn&rsquo;t stir.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sweetheart, I&rsquo;m worried about you,&rdquo; he said softly, knowing he would\n have to tread carefully. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re having a difficult time since \nBowie left. I can&rsquo;t imagine what you&rsquo;re feeling. But if you want to \ntalk, I&rsquo;m here to listen. No judgement. All I want is to help you.&rdquo;</p><p>She finally rolled over. Her face was tear-stained and puffy. Dark \ncircles framed her beautiful eyes. It made Ham sad to see her like that.\n She had always been so full of life, and energy. She kept him young. \n&ldquo;Bex, is there something you need to tell me?&rdquo; he asked. The question \nhung heavily in the air.<br /></p><p>Their eyes met, and Bex broke down. Her body shook as she cried.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, sweetheart,&rdquo; Ham sighed, taking her in his arms. She clung to \nhim like a small child. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Daddy&rsquo;s here.&rdquo; He \nrocked her slowly. &ldquo;You can say it, baby. It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</p><p>Bex held onto him until her tears subsided a little. He rubbed her back, cradling her in his arms. <br /></p><p>Finally, she parted from him, looking down. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pregnant, dad.&rdquo; She \nsaid it quietly. She covered her face with her hands and let out a sob \nthat broke his heart.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, sweetie,&rdquo; he nodded grimly, his suspicions confirmed. &ldquo;I know.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>She looked up at him through parted fingers. &ldquo;You <i>know?</i> How?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know the signs,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been sick, and tired. And\n I saw the search history on the computer. I just put two and two \ntogether.&rdquo;</p><p>Panic and fear crossed Bex&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Does mom know?&rdquo;</p><p>He shook his head. &ldquo;No, baby. I wouldn&rsquo;t tell her like that.&rdquo; He took her hands in his. &ldquo;You know you <i>will </i>have to tell her, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Her body tensed, and fresh tears spilled down her cheeks. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; She shook her head. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll kill me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t kill you. You know how much she hates stains on the \ncarpet.&rdquo; His feeble attempt at a joke to lighten the moment failed to \nmake her smile.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll kick me out of the house.&rdquo; She was so upset, she was trembling.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t let that happen,&rdquo; he promised, taking her back in his arms. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry about that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so scared,&rdquo; she sniffled.</p><p>&ldquo;I know you are,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m here, honey. I&rsquo;ll be right there \nwith you when you tell her.&rdquo; He kissed the side of her head. &ldquo;Does Bowie\n know? That&rsquo;s not why he left, is it?&rdquo;</p><p>She shook her head. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know. I didn&rsquo;t find out until he was already gone.&rdquo;</p><p>Ham breathed a sigh of relief. He liked Bowie, and wanted to believe \nthe boy truly loved and cared about his daughter. &ldquo;You need to tell him,\n Bex.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t want to be tied down. He said so. \nBesides, I don&rsquo;t know where he is, and he doesn&rsquo;t answer my calls.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There are ways to find him,&rdquo; he pointed out. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to track him down.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please, dad. No,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;Just let him go. I never want him to know.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Ham nodded. He thought Bowie would step up and do the right thing if \nhe knew, but he didn&rsquo;t want to push the issue. And maybe Bex was right \nin this case. If Bowie were around, Celia would force the kids to get \nmarried. He didn&rsquo;t want to see his daughter pushed into a possibly \nunhappy marriage so young. What kind of life would she have then? &ldquo;Have \nyou decided what you&rsquo;re going to do? It&rsquo;s your choice, honey. Whatever \nyou choose, I support you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m keeping the baby,&rdquo; she said, sure of herself, as if she&rsquo;d given \nit a lot of thought. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a part of me, and of Bowie.&rdquo; She touched her \nstomach softly. &ldquo;I still love him, dad. And I already love my baby.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I know you do.&rdquo; He squeezed her hand. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll figure things out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, dad,&rdquo; she choked. Her chin trembled. &ldquo;I never wanted \nto disappoint you. You&rsquo;re the only person who really loves and \nunderstands me, and I blew it. If you hate me now, I understand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh Bex,&rdquo; he sighed, as his daughter began to cry again. &ldquo;Sweetheart, I can&rsquo;t lie. I <i>am</i>\n disappointed, but only because you&rsquo;re so bright and creative, and I \nwant you to have the best future possible. But accidents happen, I know \nthat. Nothing could ever make me hate you.<i> Ever.</i> You&rsquo;re my baby girl, and I love you no matter what.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too, dad,&rdquo; Bex said, wiping her eyes on her sleeve.</p><p>&ldquo;I\n know you don&rsquo;t want to, but you really do have to tell mom as soon as \npossible,&rdquo; he said calmly. &ldquo;The longer you wait, the harder it will be. \nI&rsquo;ll give you a day or two to gather your thoughts, but just promise me \nyou&rsquo;ll think about it.
