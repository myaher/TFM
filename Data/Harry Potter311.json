Although, Y/N felt idiotic for not realizing it sooner.<br/></p><p>\t \u00a0It was a gradual process of deduction which began when Remus would refuse studying and the such every three to four weeks that coincided which a full moon, or that Potter, Black, and Pettigrew were on his heel at every waking moment and fulfilling his every desire and repelling any unwanted company. Remus would develop erie sense of isolation \u00a0and he\u2019d become easily irritated or upset. This was a bit of a shock considering Remus\u2019 usual calm and shy demeanor. Though, Y/N was never too suspicious. In fact, Y/N had rarely considered it to be too concerning. It was Remus after all. The most reliable person on the planet Y/N would know.</p><p>Of course, Y/N felt a pang of empathy for Remus, but after knowing each other for such a long time this cycle became far too familiar. Although, she could not deny how it pained to watch a close friend be so miserable.</p><p>\tIt wasn\u2019t until Amelia had brought it up that Y/N really found it odd.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever find it curious that Remus always leaves around the same time each month?\u201d She had asked after transfiguration.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d Y/N asked, looking away from Remus grimly trailing behind Potter, Black, and Pettigrew as they joked around. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never noticed that he misses class due to a family illness, a distant relative coming over, or an excuse like that? I mean you off all people should notice Remus\u2019 absence. It\u2019s not like you never sh-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right! I get it.\u201d Y/N exclaimed blushing at Amelia\u2019s antics.</p><p> \u201cBut really, you don\u2019t find it curious\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, yes, but\u2026?\u201d Y/N had never really put much thought in to it. \u201cIt is a bit curious\u201d Y/N concluded eyeing Remus whose shoulders seemed to sink into the ground. It was all too monotonous. </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Y/N approached Remus on their way to the great hall, deciding to put an end to the mysterious cycle.<br/></p><p>\u201cHey, Rem!\u201d She called out after Remus, giddily running up to him, and greeted him with a warm grin as an attempted to lift his spirits.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d He returned the greeting with an indifferent inflection in his voice. Y/N felt a pang of hurt of his lack of excitement, but her mission did not waver and proceeded.</p><p>\u201cSo, everything ok?\u201d Y/N asked expectingly</p><p>\u201cYes, why wouldn&rsquo;t it be?\u201d He seemed very defensive, but Y/N continued.</p><p>\u201cWell, you seem a bit off. I don\u2019t know, I just see you acting very-\u201c Y/N didn\u2019t know how to word it. Miserable. Standoffish. Fearful. \u201cI just want to know if my friend is all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d He stated, obviously irritated. </p><p>\u201cWell, you know you can tell me anything. I\u2019ll help anyway I can. I just\u2014You get so angry-\u201d Y/N regretted those words immediately.</p><p>\u201cAnd what! You don\u2019t like me like this! Is this an inconvenience \u00a0for you! Does this disturb you!\u201d Remus roared out, stopping everyone in their tracts. She stood as silent as a corpse, embarrassed and distraught. Remus had a ferocious glare in his eyes. </p><p>\u201cHate to break it to you sweetheart, but this is who I am and if you don\u2019t like it, you can go on and piss off\u201d He stormed off as Y/N felt rooted to the ground. Something was terribly wrong and Y/N had to find out and help Remus in anyway possible. </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\tY/N had pursued the Marauders through the night and heard off preparations for the night with mentions of \u2018leaving\u2019. There was the answer. All Y/N had to do was follow the Marauders. Though, Y/N could not shake off a sense of uneasiness. After help from Marlene, Y/N hid in the Gryffindor common room waiting for the Marauders expected exit. After everyone had retreated towards their respective dormitories, the Marauders came down shortly afterward in dark cloaks. Dread seemed to follow in their wake. Y/N waited until the Marauders trudged a few yards ahead, she trekked along, her dark cloak billowing behind her.</p><p>\u201cCome one, we\u2019re late\u201d Potter urged.</p><p>The rest of them seemed to be filled with a sense or urgency and treaded faster. They disappeared behind a door and Y/N followed suit. As they continued to advance, Y/N could have sworn Remus growling heavily under his breath. Soon, the light of a full moon bathed their skin and Y/N was created by the sound of a tranquil night. Usually welcomed, such a peaceful night seemed inappropriate for such a grim night. \u00a0Y/N observed as Remus\u2019 gait faltered and his movements became nearly animalistic.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Remus! Nearly there, mate!\u201d Black encouraged, desperation laced in his voice. </p><p>Remus dropped to the ground his chest heaving. He seemed to tear at his chest and grabbed desperately to his neck. His distress was evident. Y/N wanted to approach him, embrace him, and tell him that everything was all right. Something held her back. As Remus continued to grow frantic, something impossible occurred. The other three transformed. Suddenly, their ridiculous nicknames made sense. Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs. Moony. It all had clicked. He would leave every three to four weeks on a full moon. He would grow aggressive, nearly animalistic. Remus was a werewolf. Y/N was in danger. Y/N watched as Remus transformed and howled towards the moon, as if damning it for causing him such misery.</p><p>\tY/N felt a burning resentment towards the moon for causing him such anguish. He paused and began to sniff the air. Padfoot seemed to catch on. Immediately, their gazes turned towards you and Remus charged towards you. </p><p>\tY/N tried to flee, but a sudden jerk sent Y/N spiraling towards a tree. Y/N hit the tree with a sharp thud and landed with a crack. She let out a bloodcurdling scream. A sharp pain pulsed through her arm. Remus approached as Y/N tried to escape, but then felt a stinging on \u00a0her thigh. As she looked down, the leg was soaked in blood. She stared up to find Remus staring her straight in the eyes. She silently pleaded with him and he had seemed to listen. Suddenly, He was ripped from her vision as Padfoot plowed in to him. They were distracting him.Finding it hard to stand and even think, Prongs aided Y/N and let her lean on him as he guided her quickly towards the door.</p><p>\t She slipped through the trap door and examined her thigh. It was a deep laceration that was pulsing out dark red blood. Y/N grabbed her wand.</p><p>\u201cEpiskey\u201d she muttered wand pointed towards her wound. She had to make it to the common room. The wound refused to heal. The spell had been of little help. She had limited time and she knew it. Y/N stumbled down trying her hardest not to lose consciousness. Grabbing on to her thigh and the walls when walking was becoming much to hard, she made her way towards the door.</p><p>\t\u201cHelp!\u201d Y/N mustered to cry out. \u201cPlease!\u201d She cried as she say McGonagall rushing towards her.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear! Stay with me!\u201d McGonagall cried as Y/N lost consciousness.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\tThe smell of flowers and antiseptic filled Y/N senses. \u00a0She was in the hospital wing. Y/N turned to her side and saw Remus shaggy, sandy blonde hair. Her heart fluttered until she realized why they were both there. He looked miserable once more and it pained to see him like this. Y/N reached out to grab Remus\u2019 hand and he jumped at the sudden warmth.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d Y/N spoke meekly</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I\u2019m a monster. I should terrify you! You should despise me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense!\u201d</p><p>Nonsense? Look at you.\u201d His voice strained and his eyes filled with heartache.\u201dIt\u2019s all my fault!\u201d</p><p>Y/N felt horrible. She never should have followed them. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. It was all mine. I should have known better.\u201d Y/N squeezed his hand tighter.</p><p>\u201cHow can you not hate me?\u201d Y/N\u2019s heart shattered.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p><p><br/>\n\u201cI\u2019m a monster. Look, at what I did to you! You could have died. How can you not blame me! I did this. I could have killed you! Don\u2019t you hate me!\u201d He cried out tears running down his cheeks. Y/N grew desperate to stop his anguish.</p><p>\u201cRemus, you are not a monster!

As Remus continued to grow frantic, something impossible occurred. The other three transformed. Suddenly, their ridiculous nicknames made sense. Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs. Moony. It all had clicked. He would leave every three to four weeks on a full moon. He would grow aggressive, nearly animalistic. Remus was a werewolf. Y/N was in danger. Y/N watched as Remus transformed and howled towards the moon, as if damning it for causing him such misery.</p><p>\tY/N felt a burning resentment towards the moon for causing him such anguish.

It was all too monotonous. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Y/N approached Remus on their way to the great hall, deciding to put an end to the mysterious cycle.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Rem!&rdquo; She called out after Remus, giddily running up to him, and greeted him with a warm grin as an attempted to lift his spirits.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo; He returned the greeting with an indifferent inflection in his voice. Y/N felt a pang of hurt of his lack of excitement, but her mission did not waver and proceeded.</p><p>&ldquo;So, everything ok?&rdquo; Y/N asked expectingly</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, why wouldn&rsquo;t it be?&rdquo; He seemed very defensive, but Y/N continued.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you seem a bit off. I don&rsquo;t know, I just see you acting very-&ldquo; Y/N didn&rsquo;t know how to word it. Miserable. Standoffish. Fearful. &ldquo;I just want to know if my friend is all right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; He stated, obviously irritated. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, you know you can tell me anything. I&rsquo;ll help anyway I can. I just&mdash;You get so angry-&rdquo; Y/N regretted those words immediately.</p><p>&ldquo;And what! You don&rsquo;t like me like this! Is this an inconvenience &nbsp;for you! Does this disturb you!&rdquo; Remus roared out, stopping everyone in their tracts. She stood as silent as a corpse, embarrassed and distraught. Remus had a ferocious glare in his eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Hate to break it to you sweetheart, but this is who I am and if you don&rsquo;t like it, you can go on and piss off&rdquo; He stormed off as Y/N felt rooted to the ground. Something was terribly wrong and Y/N had to find out and help Remus in anyway possible. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>\tY/N had pursued the Marauders through the night and heard off preparations for the night with mentions of &lsquo;leaving&rsquo;. There was the answer. All Y/N had to do was follow the Marauders. Though, Y/N could not shake off a sense of uneasiness. After help from Marlene, Y/N hid in the Gryffindor common room waiting for the Marauders expected exit. After everyone had retreated towards their respective dormitories, the Marauders came down shortly afterward in dark cloaks. Dread seemed to follow in their wake. Y/N waited until the Marauders trudged a few yards ahead, she trekked along, her dark cloak billowing behind her.</p><p>&ldquo;Come one, we&rsquo;re late&rdquo; Potter urged.</p><p>The rest of them seemed to be filled with a sense or urgency and treaded faster. They disappeared behind a door and Y/N followed suit. As they continued to advance, Y/N could have sworn Remus growling heavily under his breath. Soon, the light of a full moon bathed their skin and Y/N was created by the sound of a tranquil night. Usually welcomed, such a peaceful night seemed inappropriate for such a grim night. &nbsp;Y/N observed as Remus&rsquo; gait faltered and his movements became nearly animalistic.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, Remus! Nearly there, mate!&rdquo; Black encouraged, desperation laced in his voice. </p><p>Remus dropped to the ground his chest heaving. He seemed to tear at his chest and grabbed desperately to his neck. His distress was evident. Y/N wanted to approach him, embrace him, and tell him that everything was all right. Something held her back. As Remus continued to grow frantic, something impossible occurred. The other three transformed. Suddenly, their ridiculous nicknames made sense. Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs. Moony. It all had clicked. He would leave every three to four weeks on a full moon. He would grow aggressive, nearly animalistic. Remus was a werewolf. Y/N was in danger. Y/N watched as Remus transformed and howled towards the moon, as if damning it for causing him such misery.</p><p>\tY/N felt a burning resentment towards the moon for causing him such anguish. He paused and began to sniff the air. Padfoot seemed to catch on. Immediately, their gazes turned towards you and Remus charged towards you. </p><p>\tY/N tried to flee, but a sudden jerk sent Y/N spiraling towards a tree. Y/N hit the tree with a sharp thud and landed with a crack. She let out a bloodcurdling scream. A sharp pain pulsed through her arm. Remus approached as Y/N tried to escape, but then felt a stinging on &nbsp;her thigh. As she looked down, the leg was soaked in blood. She stared up to find Remus staring her straight in the eyes. She silently pleaded with him and he had seemed to listen. Suddenly, He was ripped from her vision as Padfoot plowed in to him. They were distracting him.Finding it hard to stand and even think, Prongs aided Y/N and let her lean on him as he guided her quickly towards the door.</p><p>\t She slipped through the trap door and examined her thigh. It was a deep laceration that was pulsing out dark red blood. Y/N grabbed her wand.</p><p>&ldquo;Episkey&rdquo; she muttered wand pointed towards her wound. She had to make it to the common room. The wound refused to heal. The spell had been of little help. She had limited time and she knew it. Y/N stumbled down trying her hardest not to lose consciousness. Grabbing on to her thigh and the walls when walking was becoming much to hard, she made her way towards the door.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Help!&rdquo; Y/N mustered to cry out. &ldquo;Please!&rdquo; She cried as she say McGonagall rushing towards her.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! Stay with me!&rdquo; McGonagall cried as Y/N lost consciousness.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>\tThe smell of flowers and antiseptic filled Y/N senses. &nbsp;She was in the hospital wing. Y/N turned to her side and saw Remus shaggy, sandy blonde hair. Her heart fluttered until she realized why they were both there. He looked miserable once more and it pained to see him like this. Y/N reached out to grab Remus&rsquo; hand and he jumped at the sudden warmth.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo; Y/N spoke meekly</p><p>&ldquo;I am so sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No! I&rsquo;m a monster. I should terrify you! You should despise me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;</p><p>Nonsense? Look at you.&rdquo; His voice strained and his eyes filled with heartache.&rdquo;It&rsquo;s all my fault!&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N felt horrible. She never should have followed them. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous. It was all mine. I should have known better.&rdquo; Y/N squeezed his hand tighter.</p><p>&ldquo;How can you not hate me?&rdquo; Y/N&rsquo;s heart shattered.</p><p>&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s not your fault.&rdquo;</p><p><br />\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a monster. Look, at what I did to you! You could have died. How can you not blame me! I did this. I could have killed you! Don&rsquo;t you hate me!&rdquo; He cried out tears running down his cheeks. Y/N grew desperate to stop his anguish.</p><p>&ldquo;Remus, you are not a monster! You are a kind, intelligent young man who I know would never hurt a fly on purpose.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I hurt you!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;And I forgive you&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Because I love you!&rdquo;</p></p>",

In fact, the boys hadn&rsquo;t seen you in days and they were beginning to worry.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you, Moony, she was probably kidnapped,&rdquo; James says one day at the Great Hall as he takes a bite of his sandwich. Sirius snorts.</p><p>&ldquo;I saw her walking down the halls just the other day,&rdquo; Peter replies, and it&rsquo;s James&rsquo; turn to snort.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Impossible. If she were still at school, she&rsquo;d be hanging out with us right now.&rdquo; James declares nonchalantly.</p><p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t mean anything. She could be busy.&rdquo; Remus assures but he doesn&rsquo;t sound like he believes it himself. After all, you were ignoring any messages they sent to you and stopped coming to any of your shared classes with the boys. It just wasn&rsquo;t like you to stop talking to them with a trace.</p><p>&ldquo;Busy? She just disappeared off of the face of the Earth, Moony! Aren&rsquo;t you at least a little worried?&quot;\u00a0</p><p>&quot;Of cour-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have got some nerve, Black!&rdquo; All of the boys turn to see Marlene and Lily hurriedly rushing to their table. Sirius distinctly hears a &rsquo;<i>lovely to see you</i>, <i>Evans</i>&rsquo; followed by a &rsquo;<i>not now</i>, <i>Potter</i>&rsquo; but his attention is turned towards the fuming blonde in front of him.</p><p>&ldquo;How dare you,&rdquo; she frowns as she points an accusatory finger at him. He can already feel a headache coming on and the boys beside him are trying to hide their grins.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Oooh, what&rsquo;d he do this time, Mar? Because I don&rsquo;t think anything can top the 24 howlers filled with profanities that I sent you on your birthday last year,&rdquo; James says proudly but Marlene continues to glare at Sirius.</p><p>&ldquo;You broke her heart,&rdquo; she says, ignoring James. Sirius&rsquo; eyebrows furrow and he has the gall to ask &lsquo;who?&rsquo; because you&rsquo;re the only person he&rsquo;d been with for months but he doesn&rsquo;t believe that you&rsquo;d ever be heartbroken over him.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo; Lily asks incredulously and <strike>the boys </strike>James\u00a0giggles beside him. He knows that they&rsquo;re just waiting for him to say it. His eyes flicker between the girls and the rest of the Marauders.</p><p>&ldquo;Err&hellip; yes?&rdquo; He answers, half because he is serious and half because he is Sirius. James bursts out laughing and Peter joins in timidly. Remus is just shaking his head in disappointment.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;He said it! Look at their faces!&rdquo; James cackles while Lily and Marlene both look at each other in disbelief. Did Sirius really think this was a joking matter? Marlene looks like she&rsquo;s going to bite his head off but Lily shakes her head. If he thought this was funny then there was no reason to yell at him. He wouldn&rsquo;t understand. But she&rsquo;s clearly still upset as she gives Sirius one last glance.</p><p>&ldquo;I really hope Y/N never forgives you. Let&rsquo;s go, Marlene.&rdquo; The redhead scoffs as she grabs Marlene&rsquo;s arm and pulls her away. But when Sirius hears your name his ears perk up and he wants to ask more but the boys are already making a fuss at the table.</p><p>&ldquo;Did she say Y/N?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that why she hasn&rsquo;t been hanging out with us recently?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What did you do, Sirius?&rdquo;</p><p>Their questions are drowned out by the pounding Sirius can feel in his head. He gave you time to move on, so why weren&rsquo;t you moving on? Were you really heartbroken over <i>him</i>? Or were Marlene and Lily lying? They had to be, right? His mind is racing and he&rsquo;s tempted to ask you all about it and see for himself but he doesn&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;d be able to handle seeing you again.</p><p>As luck would have it, Sirius doesn&rsquo;t see you until the next night.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Pl-please,&rdquo; you croak. &ldquo;I gave you ti-me to breathe-e but I want you to m-make me yours agai-n.&rdquo;</p><p>Frankly, he&rsquo;s surprised. Who would&rsquo;ve thought that you&rsquo;d be by his dorm room at 4 AM in the morning asking him to sleep with you? He takes in the sight of your disheveled hair and reddened cheeks and raises a brow.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, are you drunk?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pleas-e,&rdquo; you repeat when he doesn&rsquo;t move to let you inside.\u00a0</p><p>He bites his lip. It&rsquo;s a selfish request, definitely, but he wants to grant it so badly. The way you&rsquo;re shivering and looking up at him so desperately makes him sure of that fact. </p><p>&rsquo;<i>You can&rsquo;t!</i>&rsquo; His mind reasons. &rsquo;<i>She&rsquo;s drunk!</i>'\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;O-only a li-ttle drunk,&rdquo; you pout as you scan his face. You know exactly what he&rsquo;s thinking and he flushes. Of course you can. You&rsquo;d always been highly intuitive when it came to him. When he still doesn&rsquo;t answer, you decide to make the choice for him and press your lips against his gently. Your hands affectionately toy with his soft sweater as you lean into him.</p><p>&ldquo;Please?&rdquo; You mumble again, peering up at him through your eyelashes. Maybe it&rsquo;s the way you don&rsquo;t stutter when you ask or maybe it&rsquo;s how irresistibly cute you look in that moment, but his resolve crumbles and it&rsquo;s only seconds later when he&rsquo;s carrying you into his room. He moves to sit on the edge of his bed and situates you onto his lap with both of your legs around him. You&rsquo;re gently squirming against him for some more friction as you whine.</p><p>&ldquo;Baby, baby, baby,&rdquo; he groans as he steadies you onto his lap so you can grind against him. Your head dips forward onto his shoulder and he can hear you desperately panting into his ear.</p><p>&ldquo;Si-Sirius,&rdquo; you whisper and he replies with a breathless &rsquo;<i>yeah?</i>&rsquo;. You simply continue to rock your hips against him even faster, making him splutter. If you continue then he might just come right then and there, but then you stop trailing kisses down his neck and reach up to grasp onto his arms as tightly as you can. When your body starts trembling and you hide your face into his shoulder, he gets a little worried.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong baby?&rdquo; He&rsquo;s somewhat proud that his voice comes out steady despite how wrecked he feels.</p><p>&ldquo;Sirius, I love you s-so so mu-ch,&rdquo; you warble. He can hear the sincerity in your tone and pulls you back so he can see your face. You don&rsquo;t let him though\u2014 your fingers are gripping at his black sweater so firmly that they&rsquo;ve turned slightly white. By now, your movements have slowed and there&rsquo;s a pause in the air. Sirius feels his heart skip a beat and he doesn&rsquo;t want to ruin the mood by telling you to leave because he doesn&rsquo;t think he can bear having you ignore him again after such a heartfelt confession. Actually, he wants to tell you that he loves you too, Merlin, he loves you so much it hurts sometimes. And he&rsquo;s just about to tell you all that but you manage to speak before him and what really doesn&rsquo;t help is that your next sentence sends a jolt straight at his heart and has his ears exploding with sound.</p><p>&ldquo;I lo-ve you so w-why did you have to le-ave? D-did I do somethi-ng wrong? </p><p><i>Is it be-cause I&rsquo;m no-t good e-enough&hellip;?&rdquo; </i></p><p>He can feel the tears seeping onto his shoulder before he sees them. Your breaths are coming out ragged as you burrow deeper into his shoulder. He doesn&rsquo;t think that he can feel any worse but then he hears you trying to muffle your whimpers and his arms are instantly wrapped 10x tighter around you.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;No! Shit, Y/N, no, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he blurts but that&rsquo;s all he can say. He can say sorry a million times but it won&rsquo;t do anything. You&rsquo;re not drunk enough to believe him. But drunk enough to pass out in his arms? Maybe. He feels you slump in his arms but continues apologizing.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Y/N, I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d still be hung up over me, I mean, it&rsquo;s been weeks and you can have anyone you want. You&rsquo;re&hellip; perfect. I still love you so much. I love you. I do. I never stopped loving you so please don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re not good enough. I&rsquo;m the one who isn&rsquo;t good enough for you and fuck, I never thought you&rsquo;d be hurting this much or believe that it was your fault because it&rsquo;s not your fault, it&rsquo;s mine, I&rsquo;m an idiot for leaving you,&rdquo; he whispers against your hair hopelessly as he holds you against him. </p><p>He wants you to believe him and waits for any sign of acknowledgment. When you don&rsquo;t reply, he reluctantly pulls himself away from you and sees your eyes are closed and your lips are parted slightly. To be honest, a part of him is a little relieved that you didn&rsquo;t hear his sappy confession but the other part is upset because that means that you didn&rsquo;t hear him telling you that he&rsquo;s the one who isn&rsquo;t good enough for you. </p><p>He feels the faint stirring of something warm in his chest as he gazes at you, though. It reminds him of when you&rsquo;d sleep over at his dorm and you&rsquo;d spend the whole night laughing and telling stories. He decides that this would be the last moment he&rsquo;d ever have you this close to him ever again and carefully tucks you into his bed. He gently gets in beside you and wraps his arms around you. He feels you nuzzling closer towards him and breathes out a content sigh. Placing a gentle kiss on your forehead, he&rsquo;s sure of one thing.</p><p><i>He wants to stay like this forever.</i></p>",

In fact, the boys hadn\u2019t seen you in days and they were beginning to worry.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, Moony, she was probably kidnapped,\u201d James says one day at the Great Hall as he takes a bite of his sandwich. Sirius snorts.</p><p>\u201cI saw her walking down the halls just the other day,\u201d Peter replies, and it\u2019s James\u2019 turn to snort.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cImpossible. If she were still at school, she\u2019d be hanging out with us right now.\u201d James declares nonchalantly.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean anything. She could be busy.\u201d Remus assures but he doesn\u2019t sound like he believes it himself. After all, you were ignoring any messages they sent to you and stopped coming to any of your shared classes with the boys. It just wasn\u2019t like you to stop talking to them with a trace.</p><p>\u201cBusy? She just disappeared off of the face of the Earth, Moony! Aren\u2019t you at least a little worried?\"\u00a0</p><p>\"Of cour-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have got some nerve, Black!\u201d All of the boys turn to see Marlene and Lily hurriedly rushing to their table. Sirius distinctly hears a \u2019<i>lovely to see you</i>, <i>Evans</i>\u2019 followed by a \u2019<i>not now</i>, <i>Potter</i>\u2019 but his attention is turned towards the fuming blonde in front of him.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you,\u201d she frowns as she points an accusatory finger at him. He can already feel a headache coming on and the boys beside him are trying to hide their grins.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOooh, what\u2019d he do this time, Mar? Because I don\u2019t think anything can top the 24 howlers filled with profanities that I sent you on your birthday last year,\u201d James says proudly but Marlene continues to glare at Sirius.</p><p>\u201cYou broke her heart,\u201d she says, ignoring James. Sirius\u2019 eyebrows furrow and he has the gall to ask \u2018who?\u2019 because you\u2019re the only person he\u2019d been with for months but he doesn\u2019t believe that you\u2019d ever be heartbroken over him.</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d Lily asks incredulously and <strike>the boys </strike>James\u00a0giggles beside him. He knows that they\u2019re just waiting for him to say it. His eyes flicker between the girls and the rest of the Marauders.</p><p>\u201cErr\u2026 yes?\u201d He answers, half because he is serious and half because he is Sirius. James bursts out laughing and Peter joins in timidly. Remus is just shaking his head in disappointment.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe said it! Look at their faces!\u201d James cackles while Lily and Marlene both look at each other in disbelief. Did Sirius really think this was a joking matter? Marlene looks like she\u2019s going to bite his head off but Lily shakes her head. If he thought this was funny then there was no reason to yell at him. He wouldn\u2019t understand. But she\u2019s clearly still upset as she gives Sirius one last glance.</p><p>\u201cI really hope Y/N never forgives you. Let\u2019s go, Marlene.\u201d The redhead scoffs as she grabs Marlene\u2019s arm and pulls her away. But when Sirius hears your name his ears perk up and he wants to ask more but the boys are already making a fuss at the table.</p><p>\u201cDid she say Y/N?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why she hasn\u2019t been hanging out with us recently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do, Sirius?\u201d</p><p>Their questions are drowned out by the pounding Sirius can feel in his head. He gave you time to move on, so why weren\u2019t you moving on? Were you really heartbroken over <i>him</i>? Or were Marlene and Lily lying? They had to be, right? His mind is racing and he\u2019s tempted to ask you all about it and see for himself but he doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019d be able to handle seeing you again.</p><p>As luck would have it, Sirius doesn\u2019t see you until the next night.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cPl-please,\u201d you croak. \u201cI gave you ti-me to breathe-e but I want you to m-make me yours agai-n.\u201d</p><p>Frankly, he\u2019s surprised. Who would\u2019ve thought that you\u2019d be by his dorm room at 4 AM in the morning asking him to sleep with you? He takes in the sight of your disheveled hair and reddened cheeks and raises a brow.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N, are you drunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPleas-e,\u201d you repeat when he doesn\u2019t move to let you inside.\u00a0</p><p>He bites his lip. It\u2019s a selfish request, definitely, but he wants to grant it so badly. The way you\u2019re shivering and looking up at him so desperately makes him sure of that fact. </p><p>\u2019<i>You can\u2019t!</i>\u2019 His mind reasons. \u2019<i>She\u2019s drunk!</i>'\u00a0</p><p>\u201cO-only a li-ttle drunk,\u201d you pout as you scan his face. You know exactly what he\u2019s thinking and he flushes. Of course you can. You\u2019d always been highly intuitive when it came to him. When he still doesn\u2019t answer, you decide to make the choice for him and press your lips against his gently. Your hands affectionately toy with his soft sweater as you lean into him.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d You mumble again, peering up at him through your eyelashes. Maybe it\u2019s the way you don\u2019t stutter when you ask or maybe it\u2019s how irresistibly cute you look in that moment, but his resolve crumbles and it\u2019s only seconds later when he\u2019s carrying you into his room. He moves to sit on the edge of his bed and situates you onto his lap with both of your legs around him. You\u2019re gently squirming against him for some more friction as you whine.</p><p>\u201cBaby, baby, baby,\u201d he groans as he steadies you onto his lap so you can grind against him. Your head dips forward onto his shoulder and he can hear you desperately panting into his ear.</p><p>\u201cSi-Sirius,\u201d you whisper and he replies with a breathless \u2019<i>yeah?</i>\u2019. You simply continue to rock your hips against him even faster, making him splutter. If you continue then he might just come right then and there, but then you stop trailing kisses down his neck and reach up to grasp onto his arms as tightly as you can. When your body starts trembling and you hide your face into his shoulder, he gets a little worried.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong baby?\u201d He\u2019s somewhat proud that his voice comes out steady despite how wrecked he feels.</p><p>\u201cSirius, I love you s-so so mu-ch,\u201d you warble. He can hear the sincerity in your tone and pulls you back so he can see your face. You don\u2019t let him though\u2014 your fingers are gripping at his black sweater so firmly that they\u2019ve turned slightly white. By now, your movements have slowed and there\u2019s a pause in the air. Sirius feels his heart skip a beat and he doesn\u2019t want to ruin the mood by telling you to leave because he doesn\u2019t think he can bear having you ignore him again after such a heartfelt confession. Actually, he wants to tell you that he loves you too, Merlin, he loves you so much it hurts sometimes. And he\u2019s just about to tell you all that but you manage to speak before him and what really doesn\u2019t help is that your next sentence sends a jolt straight at his heart and has his ears exploding with sound.</p><p>\u201cI lo-ve you so w-why did you have to le-ave? D-did I do somethi-ng wrong? </p><p><i>Is it be-cause I\u2019m no-t good e-enough\u2026?\u201d </i></p><p>He can feel the tears seeping onto his shoulder before he sees them. Your breaths are coming out ragged as you burrow deeper into his shoulder. He doesn\u2019t think that he can feel any worse but then he hears you trying to muffle your whimpers and his arms are instantly wrapped 10x tighter around you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo! Shit, Y/N, no, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he blurts but that\u2019s all he can say. He can say sorry a million times but it won\u2019t do anything. You\u2019re not drunk enough to believe him. But drunk enough to pass out in his arms? Maybe. He feels you slump in his arms but continues apologizing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Y/N, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d still be hung up over me, I mean, it\u2019s been weeks and you can have anyone you want. You\u2019re\u2026 perfect. I still love you so much. I love you. I do. I never stopped loving you so please don\u2019t think you\u2019re not good enough. I\u2019m the one who isn\u2019t good enough for you and fuck, I never thought you\u2019d be hurting this much or believe that it was your fault because it\u2019s not your fault, it\u2019s mine, I\u2019m an idiot for leaving you,\u201d he whispers against your hair hopelessly as he holds you against him. </p><p>He wants you to believe him and waits for any sign of acknowledgment. When you don\u2019t reply, he reluctantly pulls himself away from you and sees your eyes are closed and your lips are parted slightly. To be honest, a part of him is a little relieved that you didn\u2019t hear his sappy confession but the other part is upset because that means that you didn\u2019t hear him telling you that he\u2019s the one who isn\u2019t good enough for you. </p><p>He feels the faint stirring of something warm in his chest as he gazes at you, though. It reminds him of when you\u2019d sleep over at his dorm and you\u2019d spend the whole night laughing and telling stories. He decides that this would be the last moment he\u2019d ever have you this close to him ever again and carefully tucks you into his bed. He gently gets in beside you and wraps his arms around you. He feels you nuzzling closer towards him and breathes out a content sigh. Placing a gentle kiss on your forehead, he\u2019s sure of one thing.</p><p><i>He wants to stay like this forever.</i></p>",
