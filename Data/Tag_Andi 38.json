The practice ring was down in a basement, though it was anything but dark. Flourescent lights flooded the place with an underground glow, shining off the punching bags and and weights in the training area. It was a strangely cheerful place, Cyrus noted, taking in the colourful posters advertising different students services and clubs that scattered the walls. </p><p>It was mostly empty, a fact which was of little surprise to Cyrus considering the fact that this interview had been schedule for half six in the morning. He had almost died just hearing the time but apparently it was the only time the guy he needed to talk to could do. </p><p>TJ Kippen - heavy weight boxing champion of the NCAA for the past two years running. Cyrus really couldn&rsquo;t write this piece without talking to him and he knew it.</p><p>With the emptiness came a near quiet, save for the steady thumping sound of someone hitting a punching bag.</p><p>Cyrus cleared his throat as noisily as he could and the punches came to a quick halt. TJ turned, pulling out his headphones as he spotted him, and Cyrus&rsquo; mouth went dry. </p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus, right?&rdquo; TJ asked with a smile and held out his hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m TJ.&rdquo;</p><p>It took a moment for Cyrus&rsquo; brain to reboot but when it did he took TJ&rsquo;s hand and shook it as firmly as he could, hoping to all things good that he couldn&rsquo;t feel the sweat on his palms. </p><p>TJ was beautiful. It shouldn&rsquo;t have been possible, Cyrus thought, for somebody to look that good in baggy shorts and a tank top but he could definitely pull it off. There was already a sheen of sweat on TJ&rsquo;s skin that had him wondering how long he&rsquo;d been working before Cyrus arrived.</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus Goodman,&rdquo; he forced himself to reply, unsticking his throat. </p><p>&ldquo;Nice to meet you. I gotta say I was surprised when you agreed to this&hellip; I know it&rsquo;s kinda early,&rdquo; TJ said with an apologetic smile, grabbing a water bottle from where it sat by his feet and taking a long drink.</p><p><i>'Kinda early&rsquo;.</i> TJ was lucky he was pretty because he was also insane. To Cyrus it might as well have been the middle of the night. Thank the lord for the student coffee shop around the corner.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it, I came armed.&rdquo; He jiggled the cup in his hand and barely saved himself from sloshing the contents everywhere. </p><p>Great. He already looked like an idiot and it hadn&rsquo;t even been a full minute yet.</p><p>TJ just laughed and led him over to a couple of chairs in the corner. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. I was gonna offer you coffee from our machine but I&rsquo;m gonna be honest&hellip; it&rsquo;s awful.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus grimaced. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing worse in this world than bad coffee.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You think so?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, sports is up there too,&rdquo; Cyrus said, then his eyes widened as he registered his owns words. His brain to mouth filter wasn&rsquo;t great at the best of times. The early morning certainly didn&rsquo;t help. He prepared himself to apologise, but was caught off guard by TJ&rsquo;s laughter once more.</p><p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you a sports columnist?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p>Cyrus resisted the urge to punch himself in the face.</p><p>&ldquo;Not usually. I&rsquo;m filling in for someone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Gus?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know him?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ nodded. &ldquo;He comes to our matches, gives run downs of them in the paper. I thought it was weird that they were sending someone else.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip; sorry about that. You&rsquo;re stuck with me today, I guess.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Eh, I&rsquo;m not complaining. There&rsquo;re definitely worse ways to start the day than being interview by a cute guy,&rdquo; TJ threw him a wink.</p><p>Cyrus could feel his cheeks flare with colour and he ducked his head under the pretence of rifling through his notes. Was he flirting with him? No&hellip; no, of course not. Guys like TJ didn&rsquo;t flirt with guys like Cyrus. He must have been joking.</p><p>&ldquo;So, uh,&rdquo; Cyrus stuttered out. &ldquo;You want to get started?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ leaned back in his chair, a flicker of what could have been disappointment on his face before it was replaced with another wide smile, and settled in. &ldquo;Sure thing, fire away.&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p><i>&ldquo;Cyrus?&rdquo;</i> Buffy asked tiredly. <i>&ldquo;Do you know what time it is?&rdquo;</i></p><p>They were halfway through the interview and Cyrus had excused himself to take a quick bathroom break, dialing Buffy&rsquo;s number with panicky fingers from the bathroom stall. </p><p>So far TJ had told him he had cool handwriting, made Cyrus laugh so hard his stomach hurt, and derailed the line of questions three times asking Cyrus about himself. It might have been frustrating except for the fact Cyrus found himself having a good time. A very good time. </p><p>Then TJ had told him he had a cute smile and Cyrus had almost had a heart attack right then and there.</p><p>&ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;m sorry I woke you up but this is important,&rdquo; he hissed into the phone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interviewing one of the boxing guys-&rdquo;</p><p>He could hear the rustling sounds of a bedsheet as Buffy sat up. Her voice was suddenly much more alert. <i>&ldquo;You are? Is everything alright? Are you okay?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not! I&rsquo;m panicking! The dude is like&hellip; a real life Adonis and he keeps making jokes and he&rsquo;s actually funny and I think maybe he&rsquo;s flirting with me but-&rdquo;</p><p>She groaned loudly. <i>&ldquo;Did you actually wake me up at seven in the morning because you&rsquo;re talking to a cute guy?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do!&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh my God, I hate you. Just keep talking to him, Cyrus. If he&rsquo;s cute and you like him hitting on you then flirt back.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;What if I&rsquo;m reading it wrong, though!

She might have actually killed him this time. He sighed and pocketed his phone. </p><p>Asking TJ for coffee&hellip; that was a thing he could do, right? It&rsquo;s not like the world would end if he said no. It would only mean he experienced mild humiliation and the world-shattering pain of rejection, but that was nothing, right?</p><p>He could practically hear Buffy chastising him for being dramatic from here. It wasn&rsquo;t his fault he didn&rsquo;t know how to react when the cutest guy in the world was flirting with him! Who <i>would</i> know how to react in that situation, honestly?</p><p>Well, Andi might. While she had a similar dramatic streak to Cyrus, she was also pretty good at thinking things over in a logical and meaningful manner. He thought about what she would do for a moment.</p><p>She would totally ask TJ out for coffee if she was in his place, right? Right. </p><p>Okay. </p><p>Before he could stop himself, possessed by a sudden wave of confidence, he tugged the bathroom door open and marched back out into the gym.  </p><p>TJ straightened in his chair, an apologetic look on his face. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, I just wanted to say I&rsquo;m sorry if I made you uncomfortable-&rdquo; he started, right as Cyrus said-</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to get a drink with me sometime?&rdquo;</p><p>They stopped and stared at each other for a moment.

He didn\u2019t need to see her face to know that she was giving him a look of pure exasperation. He could feel it from across the room.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being ridiculous,\u201d Buffy said, turning back to the work on her desk. \u201cCovering Gus\u2019 article isn\u2019t the end of the world.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know anything about any sports, let alone boxing. I don\u2019t know why Iris thought this would be a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re one of the best writers on the paper and you already got your assigned article done-\u201d</p><p>She was right. He had whizzed through his last assignment. It had been on the underground punk scene on campus. Basement shows and garage record studios had increased in popularity over the past few semesters. While not being a huge fan of that particular music himself, during his research Cyrus had found himself thrown headfirst into a thriving subculture of fast-paced music, art, and fashion all thanks to Buffy\u2019s roommate Andi. She was the frontwoman of a local band that had attracted a large following of not only students but online fans too. It had been so interesting he\u2019d gotten his piece in early, which was something he\u2019d been quite pleased about at the time. However, regret had overtaken when his editor had asked him to cover one of their sports writer\u2019s pieces on the school\u2019s boxing society.</p><p>\u201c-So do some research like you would for any culture piece and you\u2019re good to go. Plus, Gus said he would send you some notes on it. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he can write <i>notes</i> but he can\u2019t do the article.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus, he has the flu.\u201d</p><p>He grumbled something unintelligible into the pillow as a response. Buffy rolled her eyes and turned back to look at him again. She was never going to get the paper she was doing done at this rate, but then again she\u2019d known that when she\u2019d let Cyrus into the room. It was a common occurrence. Now, in their second year at college, he lived only two doors down in the dorms. Last year had been a nightmare of trekking across campus to see each other, so while she was glad it was easier to see him now it still present a hassle on occasion. Once Cyrus was settled in to vent he wasn\u2019t leaving any time soon.</p><p>\u201cSorry I couldn\u2019t hear that over the sound of your dramatics. What did you say?\u201d</p><p>He sighed again and sat up to look her in the eye. \u201cI said \u2018they\u2019re going to laugh at me\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhy would they laugh at you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, because I won\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about? I ahve to actually interview these guys, Buffy-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not in high school anymore, Cy,\u201d Buffy interjected, her voice a little softer and more sympathetic now. Cyrus looked miserable.\u201cWe\u2019re adults. Those guys will have better things to do than make fun of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re student athletes, Buffy. I don\u2019t think they ever grow up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d She threw a pencil at him and he ducked, a broad grin painted across his face. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean you!\u201d He laughed. </p><p>She huffed. \u201cLook. It will be fine. Think of it like you would any other piece. Just focus on taking notes and if all else fails call me.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Cyrus had been to the campus gym before, but not this part in particular. The practice ring was down in a basement, though it was anything but dark. Flourescent lights flooded the place with an underground glow, shining off the punching bags and and weights in the training area. It was a strangely cheerful place, Cyrus noted, taking in the colourful posters advertising different students services and clubs that scattered the walls. </p><p>It was mostly empty, a fact which was of little surprise to Cyrus considering the fact that this interview had been schedule for half six in the morning. He had almost died just hearing the time but apparently it was the only time the guy he needed to talk to could do. </p><p>TJ Kippen - heavy weight boxing champion of the NCAA for the past two years running. Cyrus really couldn\u2019t write this piece without talking to him and he knew it.</p><p>With the emptiness came a near quiet, save for the steady thumping sound of someone hitting a punching bag.</p><p>Cyrus cleared his throat as noisily as he could and the punches came to a quick halt. TJ turned, pulling out his headphones as he spotted him, and Cyrus\u2019 mouth went dry. </p><p>\u201cCyrus, right?\u201d TJ asked with a smile and held out his hand. \u201cI\u2019m TJ.\u201d</p><p>It took a moment for Cyrus\u2019 brain to reboot but when it did he took TJ\u2019s hand and shook it as firmly as he could, hoping to all things good that he couldn\u2019t feel the sweat on his palms. </p><p>TJ was beautiful. It shouldn\u2019t have been possible, Cyrus thought, for somebody to look that good in baggy shorts and a tank top but he could definitely pull it off. There was already a sheen of sweat on TJ\u2019s skin that had him wondering how long he\u2019d been working before Cyrus arrived.</p><p>\u201cCyrus Goodman,\u201d he forced himself to reply, unsticking his throat. </p><p>\u201cNice to meet you. I gotta say I was surprised when you agreed to this\u2026 I know it\u2019s kinda early,\u201d TJ said with an apologetic smile, grabbing a water bottle from where it sat by his feet and taking a long drink.</p><p><i>'Kinda early\u2019.</i> TJ was lucky he was pretty because he was also insane. To Cyrus it might as well have been the middle of the night. Thank the lord for the student coffee shop around the corner.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, I came armed.\u201d He jiggled the cup in his hand and barely saved himself from sloshing the contents everywhere. </p><p>Great. He already looked like an idiot and it hadn\u2019t even been a full minute yet.</p><p>TJ just laughed and led him over to a couple of chairs in the corner. \u201cThat\u2019s good. I was gonna offer you coffee from our machine but I\u2019m gonna be honest\u2026 it\u2019s awful.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus grimaced. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse in this world than bad coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, sports is up there too,\u201d Cyrus said, then his eyes widened as he registered his owns words. His brain to mouth filter wasn\u2019t great at the best of times. The early morning certainly didn\u2019t help. He prepared himself to apologise, but was caught off guard by TJ\u2019s laughter once more.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you a sports columnist?\u201d He asked.</p><p>Cyrus resisted the urge to punch himself in the face.</p><p>\u201cNot usually. I\u2019m filling in for someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know him?\u201d</p><p>TJ nodded. \u201cHe comes to our matches, gives run downs of them in the paper. I thought it was weird that they were sending someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 sorry about that. You\u2019re stuck with me today, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh, I\u2019m not complaining. There\u2019re definitely worse ways to start the day than being interview by a cute guy,\u201d TJ threw him a wink.</p><p>Cyrus could feel his cheeks flare with colour and he ducked his head under the pretence of rifling through his notes. Was he flirting with him? No\u2026 no, of course not. Guys like TJ didn\u2019t flirt with guys like Cyrus. He must have been joking.</p><p>\u201cSo, uh,\u201d Cyrus stuttered out. \u201cYou want to get started?\u201d</p><p>TJ leaned back in his chair, a flicker of what could have been disappointment on his face before it was replaced with another wide smile, and settled in. \u201cSure thing, fire away.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p><i>\u201cCyrus?\u201d</i> Buffy asked tiredly. <i>\u201cDo you know what time it is?\u201d</i></p><p>They were halfway through the interview and Cyrus had excused himself to take a quick bathroom break, dialing Buffy\u2019s number with panicky fingers from the bathroom stall. </p><p>So far TJ had told him he had cool handwriting, made Cyrus laugh so hard his stomach hurt, and derailed the line of questions three times asking Cyrus about himself. It might have been frustrating except for the fact Cyrus found himself having a good time. A very good time. </p><p>Then TJ had told him he had a cute smile and Cyrus had almost had a heart attack right then and there.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry I woke you up but this is important,\u201d he hissed into the phone. \u201cI\u2019m interviewing one of the boxing guys-\u201d</p><p>He could hear the rustling sounds of a bedsheet as Buffy sat up. Her voice was suddenly much more alert. <i>\u201cYou are? Is everything alright? Are you okay?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not! I\u2019m panicking! The dude is like\u2026 a real life Adonis and he keeps making jokes and he\u2019s actually funny and I think maybe he\u2019s flirting with me but-\u201d</p><p>She groaned loudly. <i>\u201cDid you actually wake me up at seven in the morning because you\u2019re talking to a cute guy?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do!\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cOh my God, I hate you. Just keep talking to him, Cyrus. If he\u2019s cute and you like him hitting on you then flirt back.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019m reading it wrong, though! He\u2019s like a popular athlete and I\u2019m just-\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cCyrus, again. Not in high school. If you think he\u2019s hitting on you he\u2019s probably hitting on you. Just ask him for coffee or something. I\u2019m going back to sleep now and if you call me again I\u2019m not going to be held responsible for my actions.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cBut Buffy-\u201d</p><p>The line goes dead and Cyrus had to refrain from redialing. She might have actually killed him this time. He sighed and pocketed his phone. </p><p>Asking TJ for coffee\u2026 that was a thing he could do, right? It\u2019s not like the world would end if he said no. It would only mean he experienced mild humiliation and the world-shattering pain of rejection, but that was nothing, right?</p><p>He could practically hear Buffy chastising him for being dramatic from here. It wasn\u2019t his fault he didn\u2019t know how to react when the cutest guy in the world was flirting with him! Who <i>would</i> know how to react in that situation, honestly?</p><p>Well, Andi might. While she had a similar dramatic streak to Cyrus, she was also pretty good at thinking things over in a logical and meaningful manner. He thought about what she would do for a moment.</p><p>She would totally ask TJ out for coffee if she was in his place, right? Right. </p><p>Okay. </p><p>Before he could stop himself, possessed by a sudden wave of confidence, he tugged the bathroom door open and marched back out into the gym.  </p><p>TJ straightened in his chair, an apologetic look on his face. </p><p>\u201cHey, I just wanted to say I\u2019m sorry if I made you uncomfortable-\u201d he started, right as Cyrus said-</p><p>\u201cDo you want to get a drink with me sometime?\u201d</p><p>They stopped and stared at each other for a moment. Cyrus laughed nervously and gestured to him. \u201cYou go first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d TJ said, apologetic look turning hopeful. \u201cI just wanted to say I\u2019m sorry if I made you uncomfortable just now. I just think you\u2019re really\u2026 I really like you. That\u2019s not an excuse though and I didn\u2019t mean to upset you. I promise I\u2019ll lay off. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you have made me uncomfortable?\u201d Cyrus asked, dumbly.</p><p>TJ raised his eyebrows. \u201cBecause I was hitting on you, and you ran off-\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you <i>were</i> hitting on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah,\u201d TJ shuffled his feet in an awkward manner and ran a hand through his hair. \u201cBut I\u2019ll stop, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d he replied quickly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean,\u201d Cyrus mentally smacked himself in the face. \u201cWould you like to go out sometime? On like, a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? Yeah, that- that sounds awesome,\u201d TJ beamed. \u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d</p><p><i>'I totally owe Buffy,\u2019</i> Cyrus thought as they exchanged numbers. Girls were so wise.</p></p>",

Right. </p><p>Okay. </p><p>Before he could stop himself, possessed by a sudden wave of confidence, he tugged the bathroom door open and marched back out into the gym.  </p><p>TJ straightened in his chair, an apologetic look on his face. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, I just wanted to say I&rsquo;m sorry if I made you uncomfortable-&rdquo; he started, right as Cyrus said-</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to get a drink with me sometime?&rdquo;</p><p>They stopped and stared at each other for a moment. Cyrus laughed nervously and gestured to him. &ldquo;You go first.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay&hellip;&rdquo; TJ said, apologetic look turning hopeful. &ldquo;I just wanted to say I&rsquo;m sorry if I made you uncomfortable just now. I just think you&rsquo;re really&hellip; I really like you. That&rsquo;s not an excuse though and I didn&rsquo;t mean to upset you. I promise I&rsquo;ll lay off. It won&rsquo;t happen again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why would you have made me uncomfortable?&rdquo; Cyrus asked, dumbly.</p><p>TJ raised his eyebrows. &ldquo;Because I was hitting on you, and you ran off-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you <i>were</i> hitting on me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um, yeah,&rdquo; TJ shuffled his feet in an awkward manner and ran a hand through his hair. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll stop, I swear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he replied quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; Cyrus mentally smacked himself in the face. &ldquo;Would you like to go out sometime? On like, a date?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Seriously? Yeah, that- that sounds awesome,&rdquo; TJ beamed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to.&rdquo;</p><p><i>'I totally owe Buffy,&rsquo;</i> Cyrus thought as they exchanged numbers. Girls were so wise.</p></p>",

        "answer": "<p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>Omg I&rsquo;ve never written ambi before I hope this is okay!!! </p><p>&ldquo;Okay I got the blankets and the popcorn, are we missing anything else for this movie night?&rdquo; Amber asked, walking into the room with her hands holding onto blankets and a large bowl of popcorn. Andi looked up at her with a smile on her face, her eyes twinkling. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, Ambs I think we are missing a movie,&rdquo; She said, eliciting a laugh from the blonde haired girl who set the bowl down before throwing the blankets at Andi. </p><p>&ldquo;Haha, good one,&rdquo; Amber said, plonking herself onto the couch next to Andi, a respectable distance between them. But it still made Andi catch her breath when she realised just how close Amber was. <i>She was fine, cool, totally cool. Not at all freaking out about the fact she was having a movie night sleepover with her crush. Nuh uh. </i></p><p>&ldquo;So, what are the options? Horror, mystery, rom com, drama. The world is at our fingertips,&rdquo; Amber said, picking up her laptop to open Netflix. She began scrolling through the options, landing on &lsquo;The Book Thief&rsquo;. Amber turned to Andi with a pleading smile, Andi already vehemently shaking her head. </p><p>&ldquo;Nope, we are not watching that. I refuse to cry today!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But, Liesel and Rudy and Mama and Papa and Max! They are so good!&rdquo; Amber whined. </p><p>Andi just shook her head, trying to hide the smile on her face. </p><p>Amber reached out and grabbed Andi&rsquo;s hand, looking her in the eye. &ldquo;Please, Bambi?&rdquo; She said with a smile. And Andi swore her heart stopped and jumped out of her body with the rate at which it was beating. All she could do was stare back at Amber and silently nod. </p><p>Amber clapped her hands together, and went to connect her laptop to the television, leaving Andi to catch her breath and to hide the growing blush on her cheeks. In hindsight, a sleepover was the worst idea she had ever had. </p><p>The movie started, the lights were down, and a popcorn bowl served as a barrier between Andi and Amber, each cuddled up in their respective blankets. Occasionally, Andi would sneak glances at Amber, munching on popcorn, all her attention seemingly on the movie. She was smiling, a small laugh escaping her every now and then. And Andi couldn&rsquo;t help but fall for her more and more. </p><p>About halfway through, when the bomb sirens were going off for the first time in the movie, Andi felt something brush against her fingers. Glancing down, she saw Amber&rsquo;s hand next to hers. Gulping nervously, Andi looked back ahead, trying to focus back on the movie. She snuck a glance at Amber whose eyes were trained forward. But her pinky moved over Andi&rsquo;s, nervous and hopeful. Andi took a deep breath, an action she was finding difficult, and interlocked her pinky with Amber&rsquo;s. And she swore she heard a quiet sigh in response. Andi closed her eyes, unable to believe that this was happening. </p><p><i>She was practically holding Amber Kippen&rsquo;s hand. </i></p><p>That&rsquo;s how they stayed for the rest of the movie, silent but pinkies interlocked. It made grabbing the popcorn hard, but neither was ready to let go. </p><p>Andi couldn&rsquo;t explain how exactly she was feeling. She was both soaring and crashing to the ground. On one hand, her hopes were high, maybe Amber felt the same way? But on the other, the supposedly rational side of her told her that this was just Amber being friendly. Friends held hands during movies right? </p><p>After the movie was done, Andi was the first one to move her hand away, grabbing the empty popcorn bowl to take to the kitchen. She told herself that she had to let go. </p><p>But she didn&rsquo;t see the flash of disappointment across Amber&rsquo;s face as she walked away. </p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;You know what else we should do?&rdquo; Amber said, breaking the silence between her and Andi. They were up in Amber&rsquo;s room after TJ had kicked them out of the living room, saying he needed to watch some nature documentary. Amber had just rolled her eyes, knowing that Cyrus had probably mentioned it that day. Andi would have laughed and made fun of the boys for being oblivious and for TJ not telling Cyrus how he felt, but when she was doing what he was, how could she make fun of him? </p><p>&ldquo;What, Amber?&rdquo; Andi said, turning into her stomach on the bed. </p><p>Amber picked up a bottle and smirked. &ldquo;Truth and Truth.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi rolled her eyes. &ldquo;We are two people. How will that work?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cap is question, bottom is answer. Whoever each one lands on, will ask and answer.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi looked between the bottle and Amber, knowing that this was not the best idea if she wanted to keep secrets, but with Amber looking at her like that, she was a goner. </p><p>So started the game of Truth and Truth, a mixture of ridiculous questions such as would Amber wear TJ&rsquo;s clothes after he had finished playing in for free baby taters (&ldquo;Sorry taters, I don&rsquo;t wanna die!&rdquo; She had said with a face of disgust) or whether Andi preferred puppies or kittens (&ldquo;Kittens all the way,&rdquo; Andi said, Amber gasping in shock). Soon enough, the question landed back on Amber. She looked up at Andi with a smirk. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you like anyone right now?&rdquo;</p><p>Andi caught her breath, her face threatening to give her away with the growing blush. But she made herself look up at Amber. </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well. Who?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just one question,&rdquo; Andi said, laughing. </p><p>&ldquo;Damn it,&rdquo; Amber hissed comically. Andi spun the bottle, predictably landing with the question side facing her. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you like someone, Amber?&rdquo; Andi asked, and for the first time, Amber looked nervous and hesitant. </p><p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; She whispered, her cheeks pink. <i>She still looked so cute how?!?!? </i></p><p>Andi raised an eyebrow, amused as Amber took a deep breath and spun the bottle again. </p><p>&ldquo;Why do you like the person you like?&rdquo; Andi asked Amber, the question once again coming to her. </p><p>Amber went silent for a minute before answering. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t start off on the right foot. But, I realised that they were really nice, better than anyone else I had known. They&rsquo;re strong, and smart, and kind. Giving me a second chance when I didn&rsquo;t deserve it. I don&rsquo;t know what my life would be without them.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi smiled softly, reaching across to squeeze Amber&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;They sound amazing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have no idea,&rdquo; Amber whispered, looking down. </p><p>Andi furrowed her eyeborws, confused at the statement. She spun the bottle, her mind still racing. <i>Could Amber have been describing&hellip; No that&rsquo;s not possible. </i>The question side faced Amber. &ldquo;Why do you like the person you like?&rdquo; She asked Andi. </p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Andi started, looking away for a moment. &ldquo;When I met them, they were not my favourite person. At all. But, they grew on me, and now, they are one of my best friends. I couldn&rsquo;t imagine not talking to them.&rdquo;</p><p>Amber looked up at her, a smile ghosting her lips as she spun the bottle again. Landing back on her. </p><p>Andi saw Amber take a deep breath, the tension in the room increasing for some reason. Something was happening, but Andi couldn&rsquo;t understand what. </p><p>Amber squeezed her eyes shut, turning her head to the ceiling. She looked back down, at Andi. </p><p>&ldquo;If I kissed you right now, how would you react?&rdquo;</p><p>Andi couldn&rsquo;t hear anything. All that now echoed in her mind was Amber&rsquo;s question. She had to have imagined that. There was no way she had actually asked that. Oh my god. </p><p><i>Amber liked her too. </i></p><p>Amber took her silence as a rejection, shaking her head and looking away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I shouldn&rsquo;t have asked that. I-&rdquo;</p><p>But she was cut off by Andi leaning forward and cupping her cheeks, pulling her in for a kiss. It was short, but the feeling it gave Andi was something she couldnt forget. She was flying for good now. Nothing could ever bring her down now. As they pulled away, Andi rested her forehead against Amber&rsquo;s. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;d react,&rdquo; She whispered, giggling. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, I really enjoyed that,&rdquo; Amber said, beaming. &ldquo;Could we do that again?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why not,&rdquo; Andi said leaning in again. However, just then, TJ opened the room door. </p><p>&ldquo;Amber, where&rsquo;s my- OH MY GOD,&rdquo; TJ said, yelling when he saw the two girls who jumped apart. &ldquo;YOU GUYS FINALLY GOT TOGETHER. YES, CYRUS OWES ME MILKSHAKES AND BABY TATERS NOW!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;TJ, GET OUT OF MY ROOM!&rdquo; Amber yelled, getting up to slam the door shut. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of you!&rdquo; TJ yelled before the door closed. Andi couldn&rsquo;t help but fall off the bed laughing. And when Amber turned around to look back at her, the two spent the next 5 minutes laughing, their cheeks red. Andi heard her phones notifications blowing up, vaguely aware of the way Buffy and Cyrus were probably exploding. But she just put it on silent. </p><p>Amber sat back down on the bed, smiling nervously at Andi. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you want that?&rdquo; She asked Andi. </p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To be together.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi smiled brightly, pulling Amber in for another kiss. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love nothing more.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://green-lemonboys.tumblr.com/post/184971730799/so-i-am-extremely-uninspired-lol\"><b>Send me fic prompts cuz I&rsquo;m uninspired and I&rsquo;ll do it in a few days! </b></a></p>",

Andi looked up at her with a smile on her face, her eyes twinkling. </p><p>\u201cWell, Ambs I think we are missing a movie,\u201d She said, eliciting a laugh from the blonde haired girl who set the bowl down before throwing the blankets at Andi. </p><p>\u201cHaha, good one,\u201d Amber said, plonking herself onto the couch next to Andi, a respectable distance between them. But it still made Andi catch her breath when she realised just how close Amber was. <i>She was fine, cool, totally cool. Not at all freaking out about the fact she was having a movie night sleepover with her crush. Nuh uh. </i></p><p>\u201cSo, what are the options? Horror, mystery, rom com, drama. The world is at our fingertips,\u201d Amber said, picking up her laptop to open Netflix. She began scrolling through the options, landing on \u2018The Book Thief\u2019. Amber turned to Andi with a pleading smile, Andi already vehemently shaking her head. </p><p>\u201cNope, we are not watching that. I refuse to cry today!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Liesel and Rudy and Mama and Papa and Max! They are so good!\u201d Amber whined. </p><p>Andi just shook her head, trying to hide the smile on her face. </p><p>Amber reached out and grabbed Andi\u2019s hand, looking her in the eye. \u201cPlease, Bambi?\u201d She said with a smile. And Andi swore her heart stopped and jumped out of her body with the rate at which it was beating. All she could do was stare back at Amber and silently nod. </p><p>Amber clapped her hands together, and went to connect her laptop to the television, leaving Andi to catch her breath and to hide the growing blush on her cheeks. In hindsight, a sleepover was the worst idea she had ever had. </p><p>The movie started, the lights were down, and a popcorn bowl served as a barrier between Andi and Amber, each cuddled up in their respective blankets. Occasionally, Andi would sneak glances at Amber, munching on popcorn, all her attention seemingly on the movie. She was smiling, a small laugh escaping her every now and then. And Andi couldn\u2019t help but fall for her more and more. </p><p>About halfway through, when the bomb sirens were going off for the first time in the movie, Andi felt something brush against her fingers. Glancing down, she saw Amber\u2019s hand next to hers. Gulping nervously, Andi looked back ahead, trying to focus back on the movie. She snuck a glance at Amber whose eyes were trained forward. But her pinky moved over Andi\u2019s, nervous and hopeful. Andi took a deep breath, an action she was finding difficult, and interlocked her pinky with Amber\u2019s. And she swore she heard a quiet sigh in response. Andi closed her eyes, unable to believe that this was happening. </p><p><i>She was practically holding Amber Kippen\u2019s hand. </i></p><p>That\u2019s how they stayed for the rest of the movie, silent but pinkies interlocked. It made grabbing the popcorn hard, but neither was ready to let go. </p><p>Andi couldn\u2019t explain how exactly she was feeling. She was both soaring and crashing to the ground. On one hand, her hopes were high, maybe Amber felt the same way? But on the other, the supposedly rational side of her told her that this was just Amber being friendly. Friends held hands during movies right? </p><p>After the movie was done, Andi was the first one to move her hand away, grabbing the empty popcorn bowl to take to the kitchen. She told herself that she had to let go. </p><p>But she didn\u2019t see the flash of disappointment across Amber\u2019s face as she walked away. </p><p>*</p><p>\u201cYou know what else we should do?\u201d Amber said, breaking the silence between her and Andi. They were up in Amber\u2019s room after TJ had kicked them out of the living room, saying he needed to watch some nature documentary. Amber had just rolled her eyes, knowing that Cyrus had probably mentioned it that day. Andi would have laughed and made fun of the boys for being oblivious and for TJ not telling Cyrus how he felt, but when she was doing what he was, how could she make fun of him? </p><p>\u201cWhat, Amber?\u201d Andi said, turning into her stomach on the bed. </p><p>Amber picked up a bottle and smirked. \u201cTruth and Truth.\u201d</p><p>Andi rolled her eyes. \u201cWe are two people. How will that work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCap is question, bottom is answer. Whoever each one lands on, will ask and answer.\u201d</p><p>Andi looked between the bottle and Amber, knowing that this was not the best idea if she wanted to keep secrets, but with Amber looking at her like that, she was a goner. </p><p>So started the game of Truth and Truth, a mixture of ridiculous questions such as would Amber wear TJ\u2019s clothes after he had finished playing in for free baby taters (\u201cSorry taters, I don\u2019t wanna die!\u201d She had said with a face of disgust) or whether Andi preferred puppies or kittens (\u201cKittens all the way,\u201d Andi said, Amber gasping in shock). Soon enough, the question landed back on Amber. She looked up at Andi with a smirk. </p><p>\u201cDo you like anyone right now?\u201d</p><p>Andi caught her breath, her face threatening to give her away with the growing blush. But she made herself look up at Amber. </p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. Who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one question,\u201d Andi said, laughing. </p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d Amber hissed comically. Andi spun the bottle, predictably landing with the question side facing her. </p><p>\u201cDo you like someone, Amber?\u201d Andi asked, and for the first time, Amber looked nervous and hesitant. </p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d She whispered, her cheeks pink. <i>She still looked so cute how?!?!? </i></p><p>Andi raised an eyebrow, amused as Amber took a deep breath and spun the bottle again. </p><p>\u201cWhy do you like the person you like?\u201d Andi asked Amber, the question once again coming to her. </p><p>Amber went silent for a minute before answering. \u201cWe didn\u2019t start off on the right foot. But, I realised that they were really nice, better than anyone else I had known. They\u2019re strong, and smart, and kind. Giving me a second chance when I didn\u2019t deserve it. I don\u2019t know what my life would be without them.\u201d</p><p>Andi smiled softly, reaching across to squeeze Amber\u2019s hand. \u201cThey sound amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d Amber whispered, looking down. </p><p>Andi furrowed her eyeborws, confused at the statement. She spun the bottle, her mind still racing. <i>Could Amber have been describing\u2026 No that\u2019s not possible. </i>The question side faced Amber. \u201cWhy do you like the person you like?\u201d She asked Andi. </p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Andi started, looking away for a moment. \u201cWhen I met them, they were not my favourite person. At all. But, they grew on me, and now, they are one of my best friends. I couldn\u2019t imagine not talking to them.\u201d</p><p>Amber looked up at her, a smile ghosting her lips as she spun the bottle again. Landing back on her. </p><p>Andi saw Amber take a deep breath, the tension in the room increasing for some reason. Something was happening, but Andi couldn\u2019t understand what. </p><p>Amber squeezed her eyes shut, turning her head to the ceiling. She looked back down, at Andi. </p><p>\u201cIf I kissed you right now, how would you react?\u201d</p><p>Andi couldn\u2019t hear anything. All that now echoed in her mind was Amber\u2019s question. She had to have imagined that. There was no way she had actually asked that. Oh my god. </p><p><i>Amber liked her too. </i></p><p>Amber took her silence as a rejection, shaking her head and looking away. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I shouldn\u2019t have asked that. I-\u201d</p><p>But she was cut off by Andi leaning forward and cupping her cheeks, pulling her in for a kiss. It was short, but the feeling it gave Andi was something she couldnt forget. She was flying for good now. Nothing could ever bring her down now. As they pulled away, Andi rested her forehead against Amber\u2019s. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how I\u2019d react,\u201d She whispered, giggling. </p><p>\u201cWell, I really enjoyed that,\u201d Amber said, beaming. \u201cCould we do that again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not,\u201d Andi said leaning in again. However, just then, TJ opened the room door. </p><p>\u201cAmber, where\u2019s my- OH MY GOD,\u201d TJ said, yelling when he saw the two girls who jumped apart. \u201cYOU GUYS FINALLY GOT TOGETHER. YES, CYRUS OWES ME MILKSHAKES AND BABY TATERS NOW!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTJ, GET OUT OF MY ROOM!\u201d Amber yelled, getting up to slam the door shut. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you!\u201d TJ yelled before the door closed. Andi couldn\u2019t help but fall off the bed laughing. And when Amber turned around to look back at her, the two spent the next 5 minutes laughing, their cheeks red. Andi heard her phones notifications blowing up, vaguely aware of the way Buffy and Cyrus were probably exploding. But she just put it on silent. </p><p>Amber sat back down on the bed, smiling nervously at Andi. </p><p>\u201cDo you want that?\u201d She asked Andi. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be together.\u201d</p><p>Andi smiled brightly, pulling Amber in for another kiss. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love nothing more.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://green-lemonboys.tumblr.com/post/184971730799/so-i-am-extremely-uninspired-lol\"><b>Send me fic prompts cuz I\u2019m uninspired and I\u2019ll do it in a few days! </b></a></p>",
