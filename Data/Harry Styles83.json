It had been a long walk back to the bar \u2013 leaving her more than enough time to think about the state she had left Harry in.

His stomach felt hot and sick, and for the life of him he could not recall just how he had managed to make it home \u2013 surely he hadn\u2019t driven, he was much too responsible for that. </p><p>Licking his dry, alcohol tinged lips; Harry was struck with a vague recollection of a brunette girl with eyes to match. Much to his own annoyance, he wasn\u2019t left with much time to dwell on it before he was making a beeline for the bathroom; finding himself forced to revisit his liquid content. </p><p>Finishing up with a pained grunt, he shifted to lean his aching head against the coolness of the shower glass. </p><p><i>\u2018What have you done now, Styles?\u2019 </i></p><p>He could only hope he hadn\u2019t been too careless, and that no unflattering pictures of him would turn up in the media. They were always a pain to try and ignore, or explain away on the rare occasion he was successfully confronted. </p><p>With a sickly groan and a swimming head he pulled himself up off the now semi-cool tiles, reaching into the shower cubicle to turn the knobs. Stripping off his sticky clothes from the previous night he stepped under the shower head, trying not to lose himself too much in the comfort washing over him. </p><p>Running his long, nimble fingers through his now soggy curls had him remembering why exactly he didn\u2019t like to drink.

                "content": "<p><h1>Tell Me Come Morning - Part 2</h1><p>Going home for the night left Andrea all sorts of worried. It had been a long walk back to the bar &ndash; leaving her more than enough time to think about the state she had left Harry in. A part of her wondered if she should have stayed, slept on the couch and made sure he was alright through the night, as strange as that may have been. </p><p>However Andrea doubted that either would ever think of the other with much conviction anyway, especially given enough time.</p><p>*</p><p>Waking up had Harry immediately regretting the last twelve hours of his life. His memory was cloudy, not helped at all by the pounding of his skull. His stomach felt hot and sick, and for the life of him he could not recall just how he had managed to make it home &ndash; surely he hadn&rsquo;t driven, he was much too responsible for that. </p><p>Licking his dry, alcohol tinged lips; Harry was struck with a vague recollection of a brunette girl with eyes to match. Much to his own annoyance, he wasn&rsquo;t left with much time to dwell on it before he was making a beeline for the bathroom; finding himself forced to revisit his liquid content. </p><p>Finishing up with a pained grunt, he shifted to lean his aching head against the coolness of the shower glass. </p><p><i>&lsquo;What have you done now, Styles?&rsquo; </i></p><p>He could only hope he hadn&rsquo;t been too careless, and that no unflattering pictures of him would turn up in the media. They were always a pain to try and ignore, or explain away on the rare occasion he was successfully confronted. </p><p>With a sickly groan and a swimming head he pulled himself up off the now semi-cool tiles, reaching into the shower cubicle to turn the knobs. Stripping off his sticky clothes from the previous night he stepped under the shower head, trying not to lose himself too much in the comfort washing over him. </p><p>Running his long, nimble fingers through his now soggy curls had him remembering why exactly he didn&rsquo;t like to drink. While the night may be enjoyable there was absolutely <i>nothing</i> worth boasting about come the morning after. What was so good about a churning stomach and a bunch of memory lapses? </p><p>Letting the shower run until the water started cooling he begrudgingly stepped out, leaving behind a trail of wetness all the way to his bedroom. Rummaging through his drawers had him throwing on the first comfortable outfit he could find &ndash; he wasn&rsquo;t planning on going out anyway, rendering appearance futile.</p><p>*</p><p>His day was going exactly as planned &ndash; curtains drawn, television muted and dozing on the couch &ndash; making the unwanted knock on the door all the more irritating.</p><p>&lsquo;<i>Couldn&rsquo;t people just leave him alone to wallow around in his own self-pity and regrets?&rsquo;</i></p><p>Getting off the couch, with much effort, he slowly made his way to the front door; cautiously opening it to reveal a girl standing there, &ldquo;do I know you?&rdquo; He asked, only having vague recollection of the brown eyes staring at him. </p><p>&ldquo;Told you that you wouldn&rsquo;t remember, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; Andrea smiled.

She hasn\u2019t been waiting outside long, but with the rainy weather that\u2019s loomed the sky over London for the last 24 hours and with the way strong breezes aggressively whip her hair all over the place \u2014 it feels much longer and has her wondering where Harry had gone to\u2026 that is until his all too familiar voice speaks up from her right. \u201cReady to go?\u201d </p><p>With a soft gasp at the sudden presence beside her, Zoe knowingly flutters her glance upwards to look at the source of the noise; seeing her longtime boyfriend er- fianc\u00e9, smiling down at her. The grin that stretches across his mouth is contagious and causes a similar one to slowly make its way onto her lips as well. She hums in response and nods her head before letting out a subtle yawn, allowing Harry to loop their arms together as he leads them towards their awaiting vehicle. </p><p>Five years. It\u2019s been five amazing years since Harry drunkenly admitted to Zoe at a party that despite their frenemy like relationship they had for almost a year, he was quite smitten by her and failed miserably at trying to ask her on a date. Little did he know the feeling was mutual and despite her shutting down his drunken demeanor that night, she would proceed to ask him if he\u2019d like to join her for coffee the morning after; that of which he took her up on and their relationship began to blossom soon after. Five years later and they\u2019re still going strong. </p><p>These two have been through a lot together, and are more than ready for what\u2019s to come. </p><p>With his million-dollar smile and a nod to the valet as he hands the young college aged boy a ruffled bill for retrieving their car, Harry flashes her his signature wink as they continue towards the awaiting SUV. The light rain that clouded the sky for the majority of this typical spring day has now begun down pouring, creating an overall gloomy setting for the remainder of the evening; however, Harry is determined to not let that foil any of his plans. </p><p>With it being their anniversary and all, Harry had gone out of his way to plan a special day for the two of them. It consisted of sleeping in, only to wake up to some serious morning cuddles; followed by the making of breakfast together\u2026 which ultimately ended in a food fight, and eventually some shopping. This was all before the day had faded into the evening; where the two shared a very romantic dinner and are now headed home to share a bottle of wine, with the plans of allowing the remainder of the night go wherever it takes them. </p><p>What made such a simple day so significant for them is that they are simply each other\u2019s person, and there\u2019s no doubt about it. The love that has developed between them is undeniable, and it was even showcased to everyone over these past holidays when Harry surprised Zoe with a ring while knelt down on one knee \u2014 asking for her to be his forever opponent in scrabble and person to be by his side in everything that he did from then on; which, of course, she happily agreed to.</p><p>As he walks her around to the passenger side of the vehicle, he presses a quick kiss to the side of her head before silently opening the door and helping her in.</p><p>Zoe can\u2019t help but feel the familiar swelling of love and admiration she has for this man as she watches him quickly rush back around to the driver\u2019s side of the car so they can begin the drive home; causing her to smile as pleasant thoughts slowly begin filling her mind. These past few years together have been the perfect build up for what\u2019s to come this upcoming autumn when they both agree to be each other\u2019s forever person, and she simply cannot wait to spend the rest of her life with the man who\u2019s sending her another cheeky wink as he climbs into his seat and begins driving off. </p><p>The majority of the ride home is spent in comfortable silence, and neither of them really make a move to change that. Zoe stares out the window at the water pellets that continue hitting the glass and allows her mind to start wandering. Harry notices her slowly getting lost in her thoughts and smiles to himself as he faces forward again to continue observing the road ahead of him; rhythmically tapping his thumbs against the steering wheel as a Led Zeppelin song starts softly playing from the radio. </p><p>He watches the windshield wipers work fast to push away the rain as he notices the lights ahead changing, and begins slowing down. The slight movement from her to his left catches his attention as he comes to a stop at the red light, and looks over to see that she\u2019s shifted into a more comfortable position. She sends him a sleepy smile before reaching her hand towards him to hold onto. </p><p>\u201cThank you for today H,\u201d Zoe speaks up softly as Harry links their hands together and rubs his thumb gently over her knuckles. </p><p>\u201cMy pleasure love,\u201d he responds and sends her a quick glance before looking back towards the road. \u201cM\u2019glad you\u2019re not sick of me yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould never get sick of you. Want to spend the rest of my life with you, yeh twit,\u201d she snaps and causes an eruption of chuckle from him. She stays silent for a moment before shifting again to get a better look at him. Harry can see her nervously chewing on her bottom lip from the corner of his eye and is about to say something, but she beats him to it. \u201cWouldn\u2019t want myself starting a family with anyone else but you either.\u201d</p><p>A not so subtle grin dances over his lips as he glances over at her with raised eyebrows. A family huh? That\u2019s something Harry\u2019s been thinking about a lot lately. The thought of a small bean smiling greatly at him whenever he got home from the studio or whatever he\u2019d done that day that is the perfect mix of him and the woman he loves is absolutely mind blowing to him, but he loves it. He and Zoe have talked about it before \u2014 both agreeing that they would like to start a family together, but not until the time was right. So Harry never pushed for it after that however, the thought alone tends to spark something within him. \u201cGlad the feelings mutual. But there\u2019s no need to pressure ourselves about kids Zo. Whenever you\u2019re ready, you know that I\u2019ll be ready as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I- I\u2019ve actually been thinking of weaning off my birth control and just see what happens after that. I mean, if it takes a little bit that\u2019s fine because we\u2019re only 25 and have our full lives ahead of us&hellip; ugh I don\u2019t know.\u201d </p><p>Harry can\u2019t help but smirk a little at her dramatics and doesn\u2019t let it show because he fully understands where she\u2019s coming from. He gently pulls her hand towards his lips to place a soft peck onto her knuckles as a comforting gesture. \u201cI\u2019m on board with whatever you\u2019re comfortable with love, we\u2019re in this together.\u201d<b><br/></b></p><p>The light turns green and Zoe let\u2019s go of his hand to shift her position again as he begins pulling forward. She let\u2019s what he said sink in and starts thinking of everything she and Harry need to do for this wedding on top of just the thought of having a baby, and how a lot of it will be happening very soon. With a gentle nibble on her bottom lip, she sends him a sideways glance before looking right at him and mumbling a soft \u201cHarry?\u201d</p><p>He hums in response and glances over at her. His eyes meet hers as he waits for her to continue, but they only hold her gaze for a quick second before something catches his attention and he looks to the window; feeling his breath hitch almost immediately. Outside a bright pair of headlights seem to be getting increasingly closer as they head straight through the intersection towards their car from the opposite direction the two of them are traveling. The painful sound of screeching tires echo in his ears and despite how hard he tries; there just isn\u2019t time for Harry to react before the lights become blinding just as the other vehicle crashes into Zoe\u2019s side of the car, and everything goes black. </p><!-- more --><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>A few hours later he slowly comes to his senses alone in a hospital room. His head is pounding and the way his right arm is resting in a sling throws him off a bit, but he couldn\u2019t care less as he begins scrambling out of the hospital bed so he can find out where the hell Zoe is. </p><p>\u201cSir you shouldn\u2019t be standing,\u201d a concerned voice speaks up from the doorway and his gaze moves to meet that of a nurse \u2014 who wastes no time in entering the room in attempts to try to get him to sit back down. </p><p>\u201cZoe,\u201d he mumbles, and the nurse looks at him questionably. \u201cT-they brought me here with a woman. Where is she? Is she ok?\u201d</p><p>The nurses firm features soften at the mention of this before letting out a sigh and glancing away from him. \u201cMiss Clarke is\u2026 awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d He asks desperately and moves around her \u2014 making a quick b-line for the door. </p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t go see her yet. You need to rest,\u201d the nurse pleads and continues trying to stop him, but is unsuccessful as he takes a sharp left and starts heading down the hallway. \u201cShe-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about me. I need to see her.\u201d</p><p>He continues down the hall with purpose, determined to find Zoe if it\u2019s the last thing he does. However, it doesn\u2019t take him long for only a couple doors down from where he\u2019d woken up, her voice can be heard sounding rather panicked. Without any hesitation he rushes towards the commotion\u00a0before coming to a complete stop in the open doorway, instantly feeling his heart drop to the pit of his stomach once he sees her.</p><p>She\u2019s sat up in the hospital bed \u2014 covered in multiple bandages that attempt to conceal the various cuts and marks that litter her skin; the most noticeable being the large piece of gauze that is wrapped around her head which also allows him to take in the other small scratches and black eye that now cover her pretty face. Her gaze meets his as soon as he comes into view, but soon snaps back to the nurse who\u2019s desperately telling her not to move so much as she tries to adjust some of the bandages. </p><p>Harry\u2019s never felt his heart break so much as he watches Zoe stressfully plead with the nurse to just give her some space, and once she closes her eyes out of frustration, shaking her head as the tears start flooding out, he just can\u2019t take anymore. With a deep breath, he takes a few long strides further into the room and gains her attention yet again. The way she looks at him so blankly throws him off a bit, but he tries to not think about it as he shakes his head and starts pleading. \u201cZoe, love, they\u2019re just trying to help you. Please let them.\u201d</p><p>A moment passes, and she continues silently staring at him with an empty gaze. He doesn\u2019t know what else to say, so without any other words he allows his feet to shuffle across the floor until he\u2019s at the side of her bed. With a sad smile, he reaches out to grab hold of your hand so he can rub his thumb over her knuckles like he always does as a gesture to give a sense of comfort to her as well as himself \u00a0but when she flinches away from his touch, it catches him completely off guard. His eyes widen and look at you incredulously as he convinces himself you didn\u2019t mean to move away as if you were scared of him \u2014 \u00a0but when his eyes meet hers and he\u2019s met with the panic alarm that dances across them, he\u2019s still unable to prepare himself for when her scratchy voice asks a heart shattering, and earth rattling question. \u201cW-who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u25c6</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean she doesn\u2019t remember?\u201d Harry questions as he paces in the hallway outside of Zoe\u2019s hospital room, nervously tugging at his curls with his free hand as he does so. The doctor and two male nurses that entered the room out of nowhere just to pull him from it stare at him and wait until he lets out a sigh of defeat, before leaning against the wall and sliding down it until he hits the floor with a thud. </p><p>\u201cMiss Clarke-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZoe, her name is Zoe,\u201d he corrects the doctor as he stares straight ahead of him, not making eye contact with any of the people who watch him. </p><p>\u201cZoe,\u201d the doctor speaks up again as she watches him carefully. \u201cSuffered quite a bit of head trauma in the accident Mr. Styles. It\u2019s a miracle that she\u2019s even awake right now. However, as a result of this, she seems to have developed a type of amnesia. We don\u2019t know the severity of it for she has been rather anxious since she woke up. As of right now, rest will be the best treatment for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what am I supposed to do, just sit here and hope she remembers who I am? Try to convince her I\u2019m not some stranger, that I\u2019m-,\u201d he cuts himself off when the sob he\u2019d been trying so hard to suppress finally escapes. \u201cShe\u2019s got to remember\u2026 she- we\u2019re supposed to get married.\u201d</p><p>The doctor looks down at him sympathetically before looking to the two nurses and nodding, silently dismissing them so she can talk to Harry alone. He still doesn\u2019t make eye contact with her as he lets out numerous shaky breaths and leans his head back against the wall. With caution, the doctor slowly crouches down until she\u2019s eye level with Harry and speaks up again. \u201cYou can help her you know?\u201d</p><p>This catches his attention and he soon snaps his gaze to hers as he lets out another breath. \u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell based off what I\u2019ve seen and know, I think it\u2019s safe to say that a lot of Zoe\u2019s greatest and fondest memories include you in one way or another,\u201d she starts, and Harry raises an eyebrow at her skeptically. \u201cI\u2019ve also picked up on how she doesn\u2019t have any family here in London, when she\u2019s released from the hospital, she\u2019ll have nowhere to go but with you. It may take a little bit to prepare her for that, but when you are both released, use that time to show her about her life with you. The little things, the big things, whatever you think could possibly help her remember even the slightest bit of anything from the past six years of her life, it\u2019ll be a great start to helping get her memory back if that\u2019s something we\u2019re able to do. It\u2019s going to require some time and patience though Harry, do you think you can do that?\u201d</p><p>He lets her words sink in before shutting his eyes and slowly nodding his head. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d she replies and stands up straight again. \u201cNow, she\u2019s not the only one who needs to heal either. You need rest as well, that sprained shoulder isn\u2019t going to heal itself if you don\u2019t let it. Why don\u2019t you head back to your room and a nurse will come check on you shortly? If you have any more questions at all, just ask for Doctor Lang; I\u2019m the doctor looking after the two of you.\u201d With a curt nod and hum in response, Harry slowly stands back up from the ground and shuffles down the hallway; ready to get some rest after the worst day of his life. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u25c6</p><p>The next morning, sunlight shines through the thin curtains that cover the hospital room window; and Harry slowly allows his eyes to flutter open. A subtle throbbing in his head makes itself known as he lets out a groan and jumps a bit when he\u2019s met with a timid presence standing in his doorway. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Zoe mutters and steps backwards, gasping when her shoulder comes in contact with the doorframe. Her face reddens as she steadies herself and starts looking around the room at anything but Harry\u2019s eyes. While struggling to form a sentence out of the words she\u2019s desperately trying to say, Zoe can feel her heart start pounding in her chest and has to take a breath to calm herself down. \u201cI-I didn\u2019t mean to stare, it\u2019s just that the nurses told me you and I know each other somehow so, I thought if I really looked at you, I\u2019d recognize you\u2026 but I don\u2019t remember and I\u2019m trying to, I really am, but I don\u2019t know how and-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey hey hey, it\u2019s ok. It\u2019s ok,\u201d he speaks up quickly but softly as he sees just how flustered she is becoming and moves as fast as his feet let him, so he can be by her side. He instinctively grabs her hands and gives them a little squeeze, but when she just stares back at him with wide eyes; he knows maybe he shouldn\u2019t do such a gesture. With a heavy sigh he lets go of her hands and allows his to fall to his sides awkwardly. He hates this. He wants nothing more than to just pull her against his chest and hug her tightly \u2014 whispering how everything was going to be ok, all while minding the bandages and now scabbed over scratches that still cover her skin. The way she stares back at him without the usual glint of excitement that\u2019s there whenever she sees him breaks his heart, and he slowly has to look away from her as it becomes too much before speaking up again. \u201cI- uhm, m\u2019Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been told. I\u2019m Zoe, which I guess you already know,\u201d she tells him with a slight smile, and he nods in agreement. She shuffles awkwardly on her feet while biting down on her lip nervously and shyly glancing away from him. Slowly, she allows her gaze to fall back on him and although she\u2019s feeling rather nervous about conversing with this stranger, there\u2019s just something about him that feels familiar \u2014 almost as if it\u2019s a giant magnet pulling her towards him. \u201cI just- I feel like I know you, but I\u2019m not sure how&hellip; I\u2019m sorry, the nurses said that we were in this accident together and I hit my head pretty bad and that\u2019s why I can\u2019t remember, but it\u2019s really a lot to take in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he agrees and lets out a soft breath. \u201cWhat exactly do you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember everything up to when I moved to London. I had transferred schools to finish up my last years of college, and I was desperately trying to find an internship with a photographer because that\u2019s all I wanted to do was photography; but I also remember getting into modelling and fashion in order to do that. Dr. Lang told me all of that happened over six and a half years ago, and if I think about it; everything from then until now is just a blur. Then there\u2019s you. There\u2019s something about you that is so familiar, and I recognize your face from somewhere but-.\u201d Her words are cut off when two loud gasps sound from behind her, and she slowly turns around to see two mysterious women stand in the doorway. </p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes widen when he looks from you to his mother Anne and sister Gemma, who both waste no time in barging into the room and engulfing the two of them in hugs. \u201cWe\u2019re so glad you\u2019re both ok,\u201d they say in unison. </p><p>The surprised and panicked look that\u2019s written across Zoe\u2019s face as she awkwardly lets Harry\u2019s mum and sister hug her doesn\u2019t go unnoticed by H, and he can feel his heart wrench at the sight. He steps towards Zoe and her wide gaze instantly snaps to his as it screams volumes to him. With a slight gulp, he speaks up calmly. \u201cZo, this is my mum Anne, and sister Gemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s nice to meet you both,\u201d she replies innocently, which causes Harry to bite down on his bottom lip and close his eyes as he knows this is going to get a rise out of his family. After a quick moment he slowly opens one eye and eventually the other to see Anne and Gemma looking at Zoe oddly. They glance at each other and finally back to Harry, raising their eyebrows in question. He notices Zoe nervously shift from one foot to another out of the corner of his eye, before she timidly\u00a0pushes some stray hair away from her face and decides to speak up again. \u201cUhm, I think I\u2019m going to go back to my room now. The nurses are probably wondering where I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo Zoe, wait,\u201d Harry calls after her, but she\u2019s already disappeared out the door. With a loud sigh as his shoulders slump, he stares at the now empty doorway until Gemma steps into his line of sight.<b><br/></b></p><p>\u201cNice to meet us? What did she mean by nice to meet us, Harry?\u201d</p><p>With another huff, Harry looks between his sister and mum before shaking his head slightly. \u201cZoe hit her head pretty bad in the crash a-and she doesn\u2019t remember me, or anything over the past few years for that matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Anne gasps and looks to her son with tear pricked eyes. \u201cHarry, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Gemma whispers to herself before engulfing her brother into another hug. When she pulls away, she subtly tries to wipe away the tears that have escaped her eyes as well and Harry feels as if he could throw up. \u201cWhat about you, hmm? Are you alright?\u201d</p><p>He sends her a soft smile and nods while gesturing to his body. \u201cPretty banged up, but I\u2019ll live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re ok,\u201d Anne speaks up again as she pulls him in for another hug as well, making sure to not hit his slung up shoulder too much. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a miracle that you and Miss Clarke were able to walk away from that crash,\u201d a voice says from the doorway, and the three all turn to see Dr. Lang standing there. \u201cThe paramedics called to the scene last night didn\u2019t know what they were getting into when they saw how bad the wreckage was, but the two of you both have woken up and been walking faster than any of us could have ever anticipated. Zoe\u2019s head trauma and your sprained shoulder is the worst to come out it all, it\u2019s truly amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill pretty shitty,\u201d he mumbles to himself with a deep breath, but his mother and sister give him a knowing look. \u201cWhat about the person who hit us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man driving the other vehicle received minor injuries,\u201d Dr. Lang continues. \u201cHowever, it was determined that he was indeed over the legal limit of alcohol consumption during the time of the crash and has already been picked up by the police.\u201d</p><p>The thoughts of how this situation could\u2019ve ended worse than it already is creep into Harry\u2019s mind, and he grits his teeth at them. Why them? Why did it have to be the absolute love of his life that couldn\u2019t remember him.\u00a0Not that he\u2019d ever wish this upon anyone, but his heart aches at the thought of him and Zoe. He wants nothing more than to pull her into his arms in the tightest most loving hug he could ever give before the two of them head home and continue on with their lives together, but he can\u2019t. She doesn\u2019t know who he is.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s started crying until he notices all eyes are on him now, and everyone is looking at him with looks sorrow and regret, but he doesn\u2019t want their pity. He wants his fianc\u00e9 back, and he\u2019s determined to help her remember regardless of how long it takes. With a shaky breath and the subtle straightening out of his posture, Harry wipes the tears away and glances around at everyone. \u201cSo what are the next steps?\u201d<b><br/></b></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve done all that we can in regards of taking care of you and Zoe thus far so the two of you can be released from the hospital this evening,\u201d Dr. Lang explains and lets out a sigh. \u201cI have physiotherapist I can recommend in regards of your shoulder, but it should be healed in a couple of weeks. Zoe however, I\u2019m going to need Zoe to come back and see me at least once a week. I\u2019m going to help as much as I can in helping her remember, and he head injury recovery should be tracked. But Harry, there is a big issue in regards of all of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the two of you were brought in last night, we had to run background checks to determine who you both were. In that we saw everything in regards of Zoe\u2019s father and his passing, for all she knows Mr. Styles, Mr. Clarke is still alive and well back home. She needs to be told about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry responds and shakes her head at the doctor. \u201cThat- that was a terrible year of Zoe\u2019s life, we can\u2019t just make her go through that again. It\u2019ll break her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we can\u2019t let her go on assuming her life prior to meeting you is unfazed because it isn\u2019t,\u201d Dr. Lang states firmly and Harry let\u2019s out a sigh of defeat. \u201cAs much as I hate saying something like this, it is the truth \u2014 being faced with such a traumatic experience could very well help her remember.\u201d</p><p>He closes his eyes at the thought and takes another deep breath, feeling his mum rub his uninjured shoulder soothingly, but being too anxious to care. Dr. Lang is a professional and he can\u2019t argue with that, but the thought of Zoe during the time of her father\u2019s death is enough to break him as well \u2014 but if it\u2019s something that possibly help in getting his Zoe back, it\u2019s something he definitely needs to consider. He glances at his mum and sister before looking back to Dr. Lang and nodding his head. \u201cOk. But let me be the one to tell her, please.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u25c6</b></p><p>Later that day after Anne and Gemma had both gone home, and Harry made a call to his manager and close friend Jeff about everything that has happened in the last 24 hours; him and Zoe are finally being released from the hospital and can go home. </p><p>Harry glances down at his phone to see a text from Jeff saying the driver on the way to pick him and Zoe up should be there in about 10 minutes. He goes to respond to the message, but the quiet sound of someone clearing their throat behind him captures his attention instead and he turns to face them. Zoe is standing in the doorway of his hospital room again, but this time she\u2019s looking a bit flustered. He approaches her cautiously, but isn\u2019t prepared for the emotions she\u2019s trying so hard to contain.\u00a0\u201cUh hey Zoe\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently I\u2019m going home with you,\u201d she starts and shakes her head as if trying to comprehend what\u2019s going on. \u201cBecause we live together\u2026 because we\u2019re <i>engaged</i>.\u201d<b><br/></b></p><p>\u201cZo-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the hell did I get engaged?\u201d She cuts him off and begins pacing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, please don\u2019t take this the wrong way but this- I can\u2019t be engaged. Especially to you of all people, that\u2019s insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- I knew I recognized you from somewhere so I asked one of the nurses what your full name was&hellip; You\u2019re Harry Styles. Harry Styles as in one of the five guys that make up one of the biggest boy-bands ever and in some miraculous way, knows me. I can\u2019t do this, oh my god. You\u2019re this major pop star engaged to <i>me</i>. Me? Of all people&hellip; that- I\u2019m going crazy aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoah, hey, it\u2019s alright, there\u2019s no need to get upset,\u201d he pleads with her and moves so he can place his left hand on her shoulder to keep her from pacing. Her stunning blue eyes look at him with panic, but they soften the slightest bit as soon as they meet his green ones. A strand of her light brown hair falls in front of her face and Harry delicately tucks it behind her ear before continuing. \u201cA lot has happened in the last six years Zoe. I was there for the majority of it and if you let me, I\u2019ll gladly tell you all about it. I know it\u2019s hard to even think about right now but I love you more than anything, and if you have any questions, I promise to answer them and maybe it\u2019ll even help you remember. But in order for that to happen \u2014 you need to know that I mean you no harm. We\u2019re in this together. Can you trust me enough to believe that?\u201d</p><p>She continues staring at him for a moment; allowing his words to process in her mind completely before nodding. \u201cI don\u2019t know why because I don\u2019t know you, but yes. I trust you.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s never felt such a wave of relief was over him, and the smile that stretches across his face is enough for the world to know that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s feeling. He doesn\u2019t move from his position so close to her and she makes no indication to move from it either, which has his heart doing a bit of a flip. </p><p>This is where it starts. His mission to get Zoe to remember has commenced and he will do all that he can to make her fall in love with him again. He can\u2019t even stand the thought of this not working out in his favour but he has no choice but to leave that up to fate. With another sigh, he straightens himself out and lets his hand slide off her shoulder. \u201cPerfect. Let\u2019s get you home then, and after a night of rest we can talk about anything you want.\u201d</p>",

She hasn&rsquo;t been waiting outside long, but with the rainy weather that&rsquo;s loomed the sky over London for the last 24 hours and with the way strong breezes aggressively whip her hair all over the place &mdash; it feels much longer and has her wondering where Harry had gone to&hellip; that is until his all too familiar voice speaks up from her right. &ldquo;Ready to go?&rdquo; </p>\n<p>With a soft gasp at the sudden presence beside her, Zoe knowingly flutters her glance upwards to look at the source of the noise; seeing her longtime boyfriend er- fianc&eacute;, smiling down at her. The grin that stretches across his mouth is contagious and causes a similar one to slowly make its way onto her lips as well. She hums in response and nods her head before letting out a subtle yawn, allowing Harry to loop their arms together as he leads them towards their awaiting vehicle. </p>\n<p>Five years. It&rsquo;s been five amazing years since Harry drunkenly admitted to Zoe at a party that despite their frenemy like relationship they had for almost a year, he was quite smitten by her and failed miserably at trying to ask her on a date. Little did he know the feeling was mutual and despite her shutting down his drunken demeanor that night, she would proceed to ask him if he&rsquo;d like to join her for coffee the morning after; that of which he took her up on and their relationship began to blossom soon after. Five years later and they&rsquo;re still going strong. </p>\n<p>These two have been through a lot together, and are more than ready for what&rsquo;s to come. </p>\n<p>With his million-dollar smile and a nod to the valet as he hands the young college aged boy a ruffled bill for retrieving their car, Harry flashes her his signature wink as they continue towards the awaiting SUV. The light rain that clouded the sky for the majority of this typical spring day has now begun down pouring, creating an overall gloomy setting for the remainder of the evening; however, Harry is determined to not let that foil any of his plans. </p>\n<p>With it being their anniversary and all, Harry had gone out of his way to plan a special day for the two of them. It consisted of sleeping in, only to wake up to some serious morning cuddles; followed by the making of breakfast together&hellip; which ultimately ended in a food fight, and eventually some shopping. This was all before the day had faded into the evening; where the two shared a very romantic dinner and are now headed home to share a bottle of wine, with the plans of allowing the remainder of the night go wherever it takes them. </p>\n<p>What made such a simple day so significant for them is that they are simply each other&rsquo;s person, and there&rsquo;s no doubt about it. The love that has developed between them is undeniable, and it was even showcased to everyone over these past holidays when Harry surprised Zoe with a ring while knelt down on one knee &mdash; asking for her to be his forever opponent in scrabble and person to be by his side in everything that he did from then on; which, of course, she happily agreed to.</p>\n<p>As he walks her around to the passenger side of the vehicle, he presses a quick kiss to the side of her head before silently opening the door and helping her in.</p>\n<p>Zoe can&rsquo;t help but feel the familiar swelling of love and admiration she has for this man as she watches him quickly rush back around to the driver&rsquo;s side of the car so they can begin the drive home; causing her to smile as pleasant thoughts slowly begin filling her mind. These past few years together have been the perfect build up for what&rsquo;s to come this upcoming autumn when they both agree to be each other&rsquo;s forever person, and she simply cannot wait to spend the rest of her life with the man who&rsquo;s sending her another cheeky wink as he climbs into his seat and begins driving off. </p>\n<p>The majority of the ride home is spent in comfortable silence, and neither of them really make a move to change that. Zoe stares out the window at the water pellets that continue hitting the glass and allows her mind to start wandering. Harry notices her slowly getting lost in her thoughts and smiles to himself as he faces forward again to continue observing the road ahead of him; rhythmically tapping his thumbs against the steering wheel as a Led Zeppelin song starts softly playing from the radio. </p>\n<p>He watches the windshield wipers work fast to push away the rain as he notices the lights ahead changing, and begins slowing down. The slight movement from her to his left catches his attention as he comes to a stop at the red light, and looks over to see that she&rsquo;s shifted into a more comfortable position. She sends him a sleepy smile before reaching her hand towards him to hold onto. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Thank you for today H,&rdquo; Zoe speaks up softly as Harry links their hands together and rubs his thumb gently over her knuckles. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;My pleasure love,&rdquo; he responds and sends her a quick glance before looking back towards the road. &ldquo;M&rsquo;glad you&rsquo;re not sick of me yet.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Could never get sick of you. Want to spend the rest of my life with you, yeh twit,&rdquo; she snaps and causes an eruption of chuckle from him. She stays silent for a moment before shifting again to get a better look at him. Harry can see her nervously chewing on her bottom lip from the corner of his eye and is about to say something, but she beats him to it. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t want myself starting a family with anyone else but you either.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A not so subtle grin dances over his lips as he glances over at her with raised eyebrows. A family huh? That&rsquo;s something Harry&rsquo;s been thinking about a lot lately. The thought of a small bean smiling greatly at him whenever he got home from the studio or whatever he&rsquo;d done that day that is the perfect mix of him and the woman he loves is absolutely mind blowing to him, but he loves it. He and Zoe have talked about it before &mdash; both agreeing that they would like to start a family together, but not until the time was right. So Harry never pushed for it after that however, the thought alone tends to spark something within him. &ldquo;Glad the feelings mutual. But there&rsquo;s no need to pressure ourselves about kids Zo. Whenever you&rsquo;re ready, you know that I&rsquo;ll be ready as well.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I know. I- I&rsquo;ve actually been thinking of weaning off my birth control and just see what happens after that. I mean, if it takes a little bit that&rsquo;s fine because we&rsquo;re only 25 and have our full lives ahead of us&hellip; ugh I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>Harry can&rsquo;t help but smirk a little at her dramatics and doesn&rsquo;t let it show because he fully understands where she&rsquo;s coming from. He gently pulls her hand towards his lips to place a soft peck onto her knuckles as a comforting gesture. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on board with whatever you&rsquo;re comfortable with love, we&rsquo;re in this together.&rdquo;<b><br></b></p>\n<p>The light turns green and Zoe let&rsquo;s go of his hand to shift her position again as he begins pulling forward. She let&rsquo;s what he said sink in and starts thinking of everything she and Harry need to do for this wedding on top of just the thought of having a baby, and how a lot of it will be happening very soon. With a gentle nibble on her bottom lip, she sends him a sideways glance before looking right at him and mumbling a soft &ldquo;Harry?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He hums in response and glances over at her. His eyes meet hers as he waits for her to continue, but they only hold her gaze for a quick second before something catches his attention and he looks to the window; feeling his breath hitch almost immediately. Outside a bright pair of headlights seem to be getting increasingly closer as they head straight through the intersection towards their car from the opposite direction the two of them are traveling. The painful sound of screeching tires echo in his ears and despite how hard he tries; there just isn&rsquo;t time for Harry to react before the lights become blinding just as the other vehicle crashes into Zoe&rsquo;s side of the car, and everything goes black. </p>\n",

The thought of a small bean smiling greatly at him whenever he got home from the studio or whatever he\u2019d done that day that is the perfect mix of him and the woman he loves is absolutely mind blowing to him, but he loves it. He and Zoe have talked about it before \u2014 both agreeing that they would like to start a family together, but not until the time was right. So Harry never pushed for it after that however, the thought alone tends to spark something within him. \u201cGlad the feelings mutual. But there\u2019s no need to pressure ourselves about kids Zo. Whenever you\u2019re ready, you know that I\u2019ll be ready as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I- I\u2019ve actually been thinking of weaning off my birth control and just see what happens after that. I mean, if it takes a little bit that\u2019s fine because we\u2019re only 25 and have our full lives ahead of us\u2026 ugh I don\u2019t know.\u201d </p><p>Harry can\u2019t help but smirk a little at her dramatics and doesn\u2019t let it show because he fully understands where she\u2019s coming from. He gently pulls her hand towards his lips to place a soft peck onto her knuckles as a comforting gesture. \u201cI\u2019m on board with whatever you\u2019re comfortable with love, we\u2019re in this together.\u201d<b><br></b></p><p>The light turns green and Zoe let\u2019s go of his hand to shift her position again as he begins pulling forward. She let\u2019s what he said sink in and starts thinking of everything she and Harry need to do for this wedding on top of just the thought of having a baby, and how a lot of it will be happening very soon. With a gentle nibble on her bottom lip, she sends him a sideways glance before looking right at him and mumbling a soft \u201cHarry?\u201d</p><p>He hums in response and glances over at her. His eyes meet hers as he waits for her to continue, but they only hold her gaze for a quick second before something catches his attention and he looks to the window; feeling his breath hitch almost immediately. Outside a bright pair of headlights seem to be getting increasingly closer as they head straight through the intersection towards their car from the opposite direction the two of them are traveling. The painful sound of screeching tires echo in his ears and despite how hard he tries; there just isn\u2019t time for Harry to react before the lights become blinding just as the other vehicle crashes into Zoe\u2019s side of the car, and everything goes black. </p>[[MORE]]<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>A few hours later he slowly comes to his senses alone in a hospital room. His head is pounding and the way his right arm is resting in a sling throws him off a bit, but he couldn\u2019t care less as he begins scrambling out of the hospital bed so he can find out where the hell Zoe is. </p><p>\u201cSir you shouldn\u2019t be standing,\u201d a concerned voice speaks up from the doorway and his gaze moves to meet that of a nurse \u2014 who wastes no time in entering the room in attempts to try to get him to sit back down. </p><p>\u201cZoe,\u201d he mumbles, and the nurse looks at him questionably. \u201cT-they brought me here with a woman. Where is she? Is she ok?\u201d</p><p>The nurses firm features soften at the mention of this before letting out a sigh and glancing away from him. \u201cMiss Clarke is\u2026 awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d He asks desperately and moves around her \u2014 making a quick b-line for the door. </p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t go see her yet. You need to rest,\u201d the nurse pleads and continues trying to stop him, but is unsuccessful as he takes a sharp left and starts heading down the hallway. \u201cShe-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about me. I need to see her.\u201d</p><p>He continues down the hall with purpose, determined to find Zoe if it\u2019s the last thing he does. However, it doesn\u2019t take him long for only a couple doors down from where he\u2019d woken up, her voice can be heard sounding rather panicked. Without any hesitation he rushes towards the commotion\u00a0before coming to a complete stop in the open doorway, instantly feeling his heart drop to the pit of his stomach once he sees her.</p><p>She\u2019s sat up in the hospital bed \u2014 covered in multiple bandages that attempt to conceal the various cuts and marks that litter her skin; the most noticeable being the large piece of gauze that is wrapped around her head which also allows him to take in the other small scratches and black eye that now cover her pretty face. Her gaze meets his as soon as he comes into view, but soon snaps back to the nurse who\u2019s desperately telling her not to move so much as she tries to adjust some of the bandages. </p><p>Harry\u2019s never felt his heart break so much as he watches Zoe stressfully plead with the nurse to just give her some space, and once she closes her eyes out of frustration, shaking her head as the tears start flooding out, he just can\u2019t take anymore. With a deep breath, he takes a few long strides further into the room and gains her attention yet again. The way she looks at him so blankly throws him off a bit, but he tries to not think about it as he shakes his head and starts pleading. \u201cZoe, love, they\u2019re just trying to help you. Please let them.\u201d</p><p>A moment passes, and she continues silently staring at him with an empty gaze. He doesn\u2019t know what else to say, so without any other words he allows his feet to shuffle across the floor until he\u2019s at the side of her bed. With a sad smile, he reaches out to grab hold of your hand so he can rub his thumb over her knuckles like he always does as a gesture to give a sense of comfort to her as well as himself \u00a0but when she flinches away from his touch, it catches him completely off guard. His eyes widen and look at you incredulously as he convinces himself you didn\u2019t mean to move away as if you were scared of him \u2014 \u00a0but when his eyes meet hers and he\u2019s met with the panic alarm that dances across them, he\u2019s still unable to prepare himself for when her scratchy voice asks a heart shattering, and earth rattling question. \u201cW-who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u25c6</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean she doesn\u2019t remember?\u201d Harry questions as he paces in the hallway outside of Zoe\u2019s hospital room, nervously tugging at his curls with his free hand as he does so. The doctor and two male nurses that entered the room out of nowhere just to pull him from it stare at him and wait until he lets out a sigh of defeat, before leaning against the wall and sliding down it until he hits the floor with a thud. </p><p>\u201cMiss Clarke-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZoe, her name is Zoe,\u201d he corrects the doctor as he stares straight ahead of him, not making eye contact with any of the people who watch him. </p><p>\u201cZoe,\u201d the doctor speaks up again as she watches him carefully. \u201cSuffered quite a bit of head trauma in the accident Mr. Styles. It\u2019s a miracle that she\u2019s even awake right now. However, as a result of this, she seems to have developed a type of amnesia. We don\u2019t know the severity of it for she has been rather anxious since she woke up. As of right now, rest will be the best treatment for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what am I supposed to do, just sit here and hope she remembers who I am? Try to convince her I\u2019m not some stranger, that I\u2019m-,\u201d he cuts himself off when the sob he\u2019d been trying so hard to suppress finally escapes. \u201cShe\u2019s got to remember\u2026 she- we\u2019re supposed to get married.\u201d</p><p>The doctor looks down at him sympathetically before looking to the two nurses and nodding, silently dismissing them so she can talk to Harry alone. He still doesn\u2019t make eye contact with her as he lets out numerous shaky breaths and leans his head back against the wall. With caution, the doctor slowly crouches down until she\u2019s eye level with Harry and speaks up again. \u201cYou can help her you know?\u201d</p><p>This catches his attention and he soon snaps his gaze to hers as he lets out another breath. \u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell based off what I\u2019ve seen and know, I think it\u2019s safe to say that a lot of Zoe\u2019s greatest and fondest memories include you in one way or another,\u201d she starts, and Harry raises an eyebrow at her skeptically. \u201cI\u2019ve also picked up on how she doesn\u2019t have any family here in London, when she\u2019s released from the hospital, she\u2019ll have nowhere to go but with you. It may take a little bit to prepare her for that, but when you are both released, use that time to show her about her life with you. The little things, the big things, whatever you think could possibly help her remember even the slightest bit of anything from the past six years of her life, it\u2019ll be a great start to helping get her memory back if that\u2019s something we\u2019re able to do. It\u2019s going to require some time and patience though Harry, do you think you can do that?\u201d</p><p>He lets her words sink in before shutting his eyes and slowly nodding his head. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d she replies and stands up straight again. \u201cNow, she\u2019s not the only one who needs to heal either. You need rest as well, that sprained shoulder isn\u2019t going to heal itself if you don\u2019t let it. Why don\u2019t you head back to your room and a nurse will come check on you shortly? If you have any more questions at all, just ask for Doctor Lang; I\u2019m the doctor looking after the two of you.\u201d With a curt nod and hum in response, Harry slowly stands back up from the ground and shuffles down the hallway; ready to get some rest after the worst day of his life. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u25c6</p><p>The next morning, sunlight shines through the thin curtains that cover the hospital room window; and Harry slowly allows his eyes to flutter open. A subtle throbbing in his head makes itself known as he lets out a groan and jumps a bit when he\u2019s met with a timid presence standing in his doorway. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Zoe mutters and steps backwards, gasping when her shoulder comes in contact with the doorframe. Her face reddens as she steadies herself and starts looking around the room at anything but Harry\u2019s eyes. While struggling to form a sentence out of the words she\u2019s desperately trying to say, Zoe can feel her heart start pounding in her chest and has to take a breath to calm herself down. \u201cI-I didn\u2019t mean to stare, it\u2019s just that the nurses told me you and I know each other somehow so, I thought if I really looked at you, I\u2019d recognize you\u2026 but I don\u2019t remember and I\u2019m trying to, I really am, but I don\u2019t know how and-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey hey hey, it\u2019s ok. It\u2019s ok,\u201d he speaks up quickly but softly as he sees just how flustered she is becoming and moves as fast as his feet let him, so he can be by her side. He instinctively grabs her hands and gives them a little squeeze, but when she just stares back at him with wide eyes; he knows maybe he shouldn\u2019t do such a gesture. With a heavy sigh he lets go of her hands and allows his to fall to his sides awkwardly. He hates this. He wants nothing more than to just pull her against his chest and hug her tightly \u2014 whispering how everything was going to be ok, all while minding the bandages and now scabbed over scratches that still cover her skin. The way she stares back at him without the usual glint of excitement that\u2019s there whenever she sees him breaks his heart, and he slowly has to look away from her as it becomes too much before speaking up again. \u201cI- uhm, m\u2019Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been told. I\u2019m Zoe, which I guess you already know,\u201d she tells him with a slight smile, and he nods in agreement. She shuffles awkwardly on her feet while biting down on her lip nervously and shyly glancing away from him. Slowly, she allows her gaze to fall back on him and although she\u2019s feeling rather nervous about conversing with this stranger, there\u2019s just something about him that feels familiar \u2014 almost as if it\u2019s a giant magnet pulling her towards him. \u201cI just- I feel like I know you, but I\u2019m not sure how\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, the nurses said that we were in this accident together and I hit my head pretty bad and that\u2019s why I can\u2019t remember, but it\u2019s really a lot to take in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he agrees and lets out a soft breath. \u201cWhat exactly do you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember everything up to when I moved to London. I had transferred schools to finish up my last years of college, and I was desperately trying to find an internship with a photographer because that\u2019s all I wanted to do was photography; but I also remember getting into modelling and fashion in order to do that. Dr. Lang told me all of that happened over six and a half years ago, and if I think about it; everything from then until now is just a blur. Then there\u2019s you. There\u2019s something about you that is so familiar, and I recognize your face from somewhere but-.\u201d Her words are cut off when two loud gasps sound from behind her, and she slowly turns around to see two mysterious women stand in the doorway. </p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes widen when he looks from you to his mother Anne and sister Gemma, who both waste no time in barging into the room and engulfing the two of them in hugs. \u201cWe\u2019re so glad you\u2019re both ok,\u201d they say in unison. </p><p>The surprised and panicked look that\u2019s written across Zoe\u2019s face as she awkwardly lets Harry\u2019s mum and sister hug her doesn\u2019t go unnoticed by H, and he can feel his heart wrench at the sight. He steps towards Zoe and her wide gaze instantly snaps to his as it screams volumes to him. With a slight gulp, he speaks up calmly. \u201cZo, this is my mum Anne, and sister Gemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s nice to meet you both,\u201d she replies innocently, which causes Harry to bite down on his bottom lip and close his eyes as he knows this is going to get a rise out of his family. After a quick moment he slowly opens one eye and eventually the other to see Anne and Gemma looking at Zoe oddly. They glance at each other and finally back to Harry, raising their eyebrows in question. He notices Zoe nervously shift from one foot to another out of the corner of his eye, before she timidly\u00a0pushes some stray hair away from her face and decides to speak up again. \u201cUhm, I think I\u2019m going to go back to my room now. The nurses are probably wondering where I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo Zoe, wait,\u201d Harry calls after her, but she\u2019s already disappeared out the door. With a loud sigh as his shoulders slump, he stares at the now empty doorway until Gemma steps into his line of sight.<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cNice to meet us? What did she mean by nice to meet us, Harry?\u201d</p><p>With another huff, Harry looks between his sister and mum before shaking his head slightly. \u201cZoe hit her head pretty bad in the crash a-and she doesn\u2019t remember me, or anything over the past few years for that matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Anne gasps and looks to her son with tear pricked eyes. \u201cHarry, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Gemma whispers to herself before engulfing her brother into another hug. When she pulls away, she subtly tries to wipe away the tears that have escaped her eyes as well and Harry feels as if he could throw up. \u201cWhat about you, hmm? Are you alright?\u201d</p><p>He sends her a soft smile and nods while gesturing to his body. \u201cPretty banged up, but I\u2019ll live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re ok,\u201d Anne speaks up again as she pulls him in for another hug as well, making sure to not hit his slung up shoulder too much. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a miracle that you and Miss Clarke were able to walk away from that crash,\u201d a voice says from the doorway, and the three all turn to see Dr. Lang standing there. \u201cThe paramedics called to the scene last night didn\u2019t know what they were getting into when they saw how bad the wreckage was, but the two of you both have woken up and been walking faster than any of us could have ever anticipated. Zoe\u2019s head trauma and your sprained shoulder is the worst to come out it all, it\u2019s truly amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill pretty shitty,\u201d he mumbles to himself with a deep breath, but his mother and sister give him a knowing look. \u201cWhat about the person who hit us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man driving the other vehicle received minor injuries,\u201d Dr. Lang continues. \u201cHowever, it was determined that he was indeed over the legal limit of alcohol consumption during the time of the crash and has already been picked up by the police.\u201d</p><p>The thoughts of how this situation could\u2019ve ended worse than it already is creep into Harry\u2019s mind, and he grits his teeth at them. Why them? Why did it have to be the absolute love of his life that couldn\u2019t remember him.\u00a0Not that he\u2019d ever wish this upon anyone, but his heart aches at the thought of him and Zoe. He wants nothing more than to pull her into his arms in the tightest most loving hug he could ever give before the two of them head home and continue on with their lives together, but he can\u2019t. She doesn\u2019t know who he is.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s started crying until he notices all eyes are on him now, and everyone is looking at him with looks sorrow and regret, but he doesn\u2019t want their pity. He wants his fianc\u00e9 back, and he\u2019s determined to help her remember regardless of how long it takes. With a shaky breath and the subtle straightening out of his posture, Harry wipes the tears away and glances around at everyone. \u201cSo what are the next steps?\u201d<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve done all that we can in regards of taking care of you and Zoe thus far so the two of you can be released from the hospital this evening,\u201d Dr. Lang explains and lets out a sigh. \u201cI have physiotherapist I can recommend in regards of your shoulder, but it should be healed in a couple of weeks. Zoe however, I\u2019m going to need Zoe to come back and see me at least once a week. I\u2019m going to help as much as I can in helping her remember, and he head injury recovery should be tracked. But Harry, there is a big issue in regards of all of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the two of you were brought in last night, we had to run background checks to determine who you both were. In that we saw everything in regards of Zoe\u2019s father and his passing, for all she knows Mr. Styles, Mr. Clarke is still alive and well back home. She needs to be told about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry responds and shakes her head at the doctor. \u201cThat- that was a terrible year of Zoe\u2019s life, we can\u2019t just make her go through that again. It\u2019ll break her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we can\u2019t let her go on assuming her life prior to meeting you is unfazed because it isn\u2019t,\u201d Dr. Lang states firmly and Harry let\u2019s out a sigh of defeat. \u201cAs much as I hate saying something like this, it is the truth \u2014 being faced with such a traumatic experience could very well help her remember.\u201d</p><p>He closes his eyes at the thought and takes another deep breath, feeling his mum rub his uninjured shoulder soothingly, but being too anxious to care. Dr. Lang is a professional and he can\u2019t argue with that, but the thought of Zoe during the time of her father\u2019s death is enough to break him as well \u2014 but if it\u2019s something that possibly help in getting his Zoe back, it\u2019s something he definitely needs to consider. He glances at his mum and sister before looking back to Dr. Lang and nodding his head. \u201cOk. But let me be the one to tell her, please.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u25c6</b></p><p>Later that day after Anne and Gemma had both gone home, and Harry made a call to his manager and close friend Jeff about everything that has happened in the last 24 hours; him and Zoe are finally being released from the hospital and can go home. </p><p>Harry glances down at his phone to see a text from Jeff saying the driver on the way to pick him and Zoe up should be there in about 10 minutes. He goes to respond to the message, but the quiet sound of someone clearing their throat behind him captures his attention instead and he turns to face them. Zoe is standing in the doorway of his hospital room again, but this time she\u2019s looking a bit flustered. He approaches her cautiously, but isn\u2019t prepared for the emotions she\u2019s trying so hard to contain.\u00a0\u201cUh hey Zoe\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently I\u2019m going home with you,\u201d she starts and shakes her head as if trying to comprehend what\u2019s going on. \u201cBecause we live together\u2026 because we\u2019re <i>engaged</i>.\u201d<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cZo-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the hell did I get engaged?\u201d She cuts him off and begins pacing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, please don\u2019t take this the wrong way but this- I can\u2019t be engaged. Especially to you of all people, that\u2019s insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- I knew I recognized you from somewhere so I asked one of the nurses what your full name was\u2026 You\u2019re Harry Styles. Harry Styles as in one of the five guys that make up one of the biggest boy-bands ever and in some miraculous way, knows me. I can\u2019t do this, oh my god. You\u2019re this major pop star engaged to <i>me</i>. Me? Of all people\u2026 that- I\u2019m going crazy aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoah, hey, it\u2019s alright, there\u2019s no need to get upset,\u201d he pleads with her and moves so he can place his left hand on her shoulder to keep her from pacing. Her stunning blue eyes look at him with panic, but they soften the slightest bit as soon as they meet his green ones. A strand of her light brown hair falls in front of her face and Harry delicately tucks it behind her ear before continuing. \u201cA lot has happened in the last six years Zoe. I was there for the majority of it and if you let me, I\u2019ll gladly tell you all about it. I know it\u2019s hard to even think about right now but I love you more than anything, and if you have any questions, I promise to answer them and maybe it\u2019ll even help you remember. But in order for that to happen \u2014 you need to know that I mean you no harm. We\u2019re in this together. Can you trust me enough to believe that?\u201d</p><p>She continues staring at him for a moment; allowing his words to process in her mind completely before nodding. \u201cI don\u2019t know why because I don\u2019t know you, but yes. I trust you.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s never felt such a wave of relief was over him, and the smile that stretches across his face is enough for the world to know that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s feeling. He doesn\u2019t move from his position so close to her and she makes no indication to move from it either, which has his heart doing a bit of a flip. </p><p>This is where it starts. His mission to get Zoe to remember has commenced and he will do all that he can to make her fall in love with him again. He can\u2019t even stand the thought of this not working out in his favour but he has no choice but to leave that up to fate. With another sigh, he straightens himself out and lets his hand slide off her shoulder. \u201cPerfect. Let\u2019s get you home then, and after a night of rest we can talk about anything you want.\u201d</p></p>",

She hasn\u2019t been waiting outside long, but with the rainy weather that\u2019s loomed the sky over London for the last 24 hours and with the way strong breezes aggressively whip her hair all over the place \u2014 it feels much longer and has her wondering where Harry had gone to\u2026 that is until his all too familiar voice speaks up from her right. \u201cReady to go?\u201d </p><p>With a soft gasp at the sudden presence beside her, Zoe knowingly flutters her glance upwards to look at the source of the noise; seeing her longtime boyfriend er- fianc\u00e9, smiling down at her. The grin that stretches across his mouth is contagious and causes a similar one to slowly make its way onto her lips as well. She hums in response and nods her head before letting out a subtle yawn, allowing Harry to loop their arms together as he leads them towards their awaiting vehicle. </p><p>Five years. It\u2019s been five amazing years since Harry drunkenly admitted to Zoe at a party that despite their frenemy like relationship they had for almost a year, he was quite smitten by her and failed miserably at trying to ask her on a date. Little did he know the feeling was mutual and despite her shutting down his drunken demeanor that night, she would proceed to ask him if he\u2019d like to join her for coffee the morning after; that of which he took her up on and their relationship began to blossom soon after. Five years later and they\u2019re still going strong. </p><p>These two have been through a lot together, and are more than ready for what\u2019s to come. </p><p>With his million-dollar smile and a nod to the valet as he hands the young college aged boy a ruffled bill for retrieving their car, Harry flashes her his signature wink as they continue towards the awaiting SUV. The light rain that clouded the sky for the majority of this typical spring day has now begun down pouring, creating an overall gloomy setting for the remainder of the evening; however, Harry is determined to not let that foil any of his plans. </p><p>With it being their anniversary and all, Harry had gone out of his way to plan a special day for the two of them. It consisted of sleeping in, only to wake up to some serious morning cuddles; followed by the making of breakfast together\u2026 which ultimately ended in a food fight, and eventually some shopping. This was all before the day had faded into the evening; where the two shared a very romantic dinner and are now headed home to share a bottle of wine, with the plans of allowing the remainder of the night go wherever it takes them. </p><p>What made such a simple day so significant for them is that they are simply each other\u2019s person, and there\u2019s no doubt about it. The love that has developed between them is undeniable, and it was even showcased to everyone over these past holidays when Harry surprised Zoe with a ring while knelt down on one knee \u2014 asking for her to be his forever opponent in scrabble and person to be by his side in everything that he did from then on; which, of course, she happily agreed to.</p><p>As he walks her around to the passenger side of the vehicle, he presses a quick kiss to the side of her head before silently opening the door and helping her in.</p><p>Zoe can\u2019t help but feel the familiar swelling of love and admiration she has for this man as she watches him quickly rush back around to the driver\u2019s side of the car so they can begin the drive home; causing her to smile as pleasant thoughts slowly begin filling her mind. These past few years together have been the perfect build up for what\u2019s to come this upcoming autumn when they both agree to be each other\u2019s forever person, and she simply cannot wait to spend the rest of her life with the man who\u2019s sending her another cheeky wink as he climbs into his seat and begins driving off. </p><p>The majority of the ride home is spent in comfortable silence, and neither of them really make a move to change that. Zoe stares out the window at the water pellets that continue hitting the glass and allows her mind to start wandering. Harry notices her slowly getting lost in her thoughts and smiles to himself as he faces forward again to continue observing the road ahead of him; rhythmically tapping his thumbs against the steering wheel as a Led Zeppelin song starts softly playing from the radio. </p><p>He watches the windshield wipers work fast to push away the rain as he notices the lights ahead changing, and begins slowing down. The slight movement from her to his left catches his attention as he comes to a stop at the red light, and looks over to see that she\u2019s shifted into a more comfortable position. She sends him a sleepy smile before reaching her hand towards him to hold onto. </p><p>\u201cThank you for today H,\u201d Zoe speaks up softly as Harry links their hands together and rubs his thumb gently over her knuckles. </p><p>\u201cMy pleasure love,\u201d he responds and sends her a quick glance before looking back towards the road. \u201cM\u2019glad you\u2019re not sick of me yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould never get sick of you. Want to spend the rest of my life with you, yeh twit,\u201d she snaps and causes an eruption of chuckle from him. She stays silent for a moment before shifting again to get a better look at him. Harry can see her nervously chewing on her bottom lip from the corner of his eye and is about to say something, but she beats him to it. \u201cWouldn\u2019t want myself starting a family with anyone else but you either.\u201d</p><p>A not so subtle grin dances over his lips as he glances over at her with raised eyebrows. A family huh? That\u2019s something Harry\u2019s been thinking about a lot lately. The thought of a small bean smiling greatly at him whenever he got home from the studio or whatever he\u2019d done that day that is the perfect mix of him and the woman he loves is absolutely mind blowing to him, but he loves it. He and Zoe have talked about it before \u2014 both agreeing that they would like to start a family together, but not until the time was right. So Harry never pushed for it after that however, the thought alone tends to spark something within him. \u201cGlad the feelings mutual. But there\u2019s no need to pressure ourselves about kids Zo. Whenever you\u2019re ready, you know that I\u2019ll be ready as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I- I\u2019ve actually been thinking of weaning off my birth control and just see what happens after that. I mean, if it takes a little bit that\u2019s fine because we\u2019re only 25 and have our full lives ahead of us\u2026 ugh I don\u2019t know.\u201d </p><p>Harry can\u2019t help but smirk a little at her dramatics and doesn\u2019t let it show because he fully understands where she\u2019s coming from. He gently pulls her hand towards his lips to place a soft peck onto her knuckles as a comforting gesture. \u201cI\u2019m on board with whatever you\u2019re comfortable with love, we\u2019re in this together.\u201d<b><br></b></p><p>The light turns green and Zoe let\u2019s go of his hand to shift her position again as he begins pulling forward. She let\u2019s what he said sink in and starts thinking of everything she and Harry need to do for this wedding on top of just the thought of having a baby, and how a lot of it will be happening very soon. With a gentle nibble on her bottom lip, she sends him a sideways glance before looking right at him and mumbling a soft \u201cHarry?\u201d</p><p>He hums in response and glances over at her. His eyes meet hers as he waits for her to continue, but they only hold her gaze for a quick second before something catches his attention and he looks to the window; feeling his breath hitch almost immediately. Outside a bright pair of headlights seem to be getting increasingly closer as they head straight through the intersection towards their car from the opposite direction the two of them are traveling. The painful sound of screeching tires echo in his ears and despite how hard he tries; there just isn\u2019t time for Harry to react before the lights become blinding just as the other vehicle crashes into Zoe\u2019s side of the car, and everything goes black. </p>[[MORE]]<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>A few hours later he slowly comes to his senses alone in a hospital room. His head is pounding and the way his right arm is resting in a sling throws him off a bit, but he couldn\u2019t care less as he begins scrambling out of the hospital bed so he can find out where the hell Zoe is. </p><p>\u201cSir you shouldn\u2019t be standing,\u201d a concerned voice speaks up from the doorway and his gaze moves to meet that of a nurse \u2014 who wastes no time in entering the room in attempts to try to get him to sit back down. </p><p>\u201cZoe,\u201d he mumbles, and the nurse looks at him questionably. \u201cT-they brought me here with a woman. Where is she? Is she ok?\u201d</p><p>The nurses firm features soften at the mention of this before letting out a sigh and glancing away from him. \u201cMiss Clarke is\u2026 awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d He asks desperately and moves around her \u2014 making a quick b-line for the door. </p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t go see her yet. You need to rest,\u201d the nurse pleads and continues trying to stop him, but is unsuccessful as he takes a sharp left and starts heading down the hallway. \u201cShe-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about me. I need to see her.\u201d</p><p>He continues down the hall with purpose, determined to find Zoe if it\u2019s the last thing he does. However, it doesn\u2019t take him long for only a couple doors down from where he\u2019d woken up, her voice can be heard sounding rather panicked. Without any hesitation he rushes towards the commotion\u00a0before coming to a complete stop in the open doorway, instantly feeling his heart drop to the pit of his stomach once he sees her.</p><p>She\u2019s sat up in the hospital bed \u2014 covered in multiple bandages that attempt to conceal the various cuts and marks that litter her skin; the most noticeable being the large piece of gauze that is wrapped around her head which also allows him to take in the other small scratches and black eye that now cover her pretty face. Her gaze meets his as soon as he comes into view, but soon snaps back to the nurse who\u2019s desperately telling her not to move so much as she tries to adjust some of the bandages. </p><p>Harry\u2019s never felt his heart break so much as he watches Zoe stressfully plead with the nurse to just give her some space, and once she closes her eyes out of frustration, shaking her head as the tears start flooding out, he just can\u2019t take anymore. With a deep breath, he takes a few long strides further into the room and gains her attention yet again. The way she looks at him so blankly throws him off a bit, but he tries to not think about it as he shakes his head and starts pleading. \u201cZoe, love, they\u2019re just trying to help you. Please let them.\u201d</p><p>A moment passes, and she continues silently staring at him with an empty gaze. He doesn\u2019t know what else to say, so without any other words he allows his feet to shuffle across the floor until he\u2019s at the side of her bed. With a sad smile, he reaches out to grab hold of your hand so he can rub his thumb over her knuckles like he always does as a gesture to give a sense of comfort to her as well as himself \u00a0but when she flinches away from his touch, it catches him completely off guard. His eyes widen and look at you incredulously as he convinces himself you didn\u2019t mean to move away as if you were scared of him \u2014 \u00a0but when his eyes meet hers and he\u2019s met with the panic alarm that dances across them, he\u2019s still unable to prepare himself for when her scratchy voice asks a heart shattering, and earth rattling question. \u201cW-who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u25c6</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean she doesn\u2019t remember?\u201d Harry questions as he paces in the hallway outside of Zoe\u2019s hospital room, nervously tugging at his curls with his free hand as he does so. The doctor and two male nurses that entered the room out of nowhere just to pull him from it stare at him and wait until he lets out a sigh of defeat, before leaning against the wall and sliding down it until he hits the floor with a thud. </p><p>\u201cMiss Clarke-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZoe, her name is Zoe,\u201d he corrects the doctor as he stares straight ahead of him, not making eye contact with any of the people who watch him. </p><p>\u201cZoe,\u201d the doctor speaks up again as she watches him carefully. \u201cSuffered quite a bit of head trauma in the accident Mr. Styles. It\u2019s a miracle that she\u2019s even awake right now. However, as a result of this, she seems to have developed a type of amnesia. We don\u2019t know the severity of it for she has been rather anxious since she woke up. As of right now, rest will be the best treatment for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what am I supposed to do, just sit here and hope she remembers who I am? Try to convince her I\u2019m not some stranger, that I\u2019m-,\u201d he cuts himself off when the sob he\u2019d been trying so hard to suppress finally escapes. \u201cShe\u2019s got to remember\u2026 she- we\u2019re supposed to get married.\u201d</p><p>The doctor looks down at him sympathetically before looking to the two nurses and nodding, silently dismissing them so she can talk to Harry alone. He still doesn\u2019t make eye contact with her as he lets out numerous shaky breaths and leans his head back against the wall. With caution, the doctor slowly crouches down until she\u2019s eye level with Harry and speaks up again. \u201cYou can help her you know?\u201d</p><p>This catches his attention and he soon snaps his gaze to hers as he lets out another breath. \u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell based off what I\u2019ve seen and know, I think it\u2019s safe to say that a lot of Zoe\u2019s greatest and fondest memories include you in one way or another,\u201d she starts, and Harry raises an eyebrow at her skeptically. \u201cI\u2019ve also picked up on how she doesn\u2019t have any family here in London, when she\u2019s released from the hospital, she\u2019ll have nowhere to go but with you. It may take a little bit to prepare her for that, but when you are both released, use that time to show her about her life with you. The little things, the big things, whatever you think could possibly help her remember even the slightest bit of anything from the past six years of her life, it\u2019ll be a great start to helping get her memory back if that\u2019s something we\u2019re able to do. It\u2019s going to require some time and patience though Harry, do you think you can do that?\u201d</p><p>He lets her words sink in before shutting his eyes and slowly nodding his head. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d she replies and stands up straight again. \u201cNow, she\u2019s not the only one who needs to heal either. You need rest as well, that sprained shoulder isn\u2019t going to heal itself if you don\u2019t let it. Why don\u2019t you head back to your room and a nurse will come check on you shortly? If you have any more questions at all, just ask for Doctor Lang; I\u2019m the doctor looking after the two of you.\u201d With a curt nod and hum in response, Harry slowly stands back up from the ground and shuffles down the hallway; ready to get some rest after the worst day of his life. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u25c6</p><p>The next morning, sunlight shines through the thin curtains that cover the hospital room window; and Harry slowly allows his eyes to flutter open. A subtle throbbing in his head makes itself known as he lets out a groan and jumps a bit when he\u2019s met with a timid presence standing in his doorway. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Zoe mutters and steps backwards, gasping when her shoulder comes in contact with the doorframe. Her face reddens as she steadies herself and starts looking around the room at anything but Harry\u2019s eyes. While struggling to form a sentence out of the words she\u2019s desperately trying to say, Zoe can feel her heart start pounding in her chest and has to take a breath to calm herself down. \u201cI-I didn\u2019t mean to stare, it\u2019s just that the nurses told me you and I know each other somehow so, I thought if I really looked at you, I\u2019d recognize you\u2026 but I don\u2019t remember and I\u2019m trying to, I really am, but I don\u2019t know how and-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey hey hey, it\u2019s ok. It\u2019s ok,\u201d he speaks up quickly but softly as he sees just how flustered she is becoming and moves as fast as his feet let him, so he can be by her side. He instinctively grabs her hands and gives them a little squeeze, but when she just stares back at him with wide eyes; he knows maybe he shouldn\u2019t do such a gesture. With a heavy sigh he lets go of her hands and allows his to fall to his sides awkwardly. He hates this. He wants nothing more than to just pull her against his chest and hug her tightly \u2014 whispering how everything was going to be ok, all while minding the bandages and now scabbed over scratches that still cover her skin. The way she stares back at him without the usual glint of excitement that\u2019s there whenever she sees him breaks his heart, and he slowly has to look away from her as it becomes too much before speaking up again. \u201cI- uhm, m\u2019Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been told. I\u2019m Zoe, which I guess you already know,\u201d she tells him with a slight smile, and he nods in agreement. She shuffles awkwardly on her feet while biting down on her lip nervously and shyly glancing away from him. Slowly, she allows her gaze to fall back on him and although she\u2019s feeling rather nervous about conversing with this stranger, there\u2019s just something about him that feels familiar \u2014 almost as if it\u2019s a giant magnet pulling her towards him. \u201cI just- I feel like I know you, but I\u2019m not sure how\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, the nurses said that we were in this accident together and I hit my head pretty bad and that\u2019s why I can\u2019t remember, but it\u2019s really a lot to take in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he agrees and lets out a soft breath. \u201cWhat exactly do you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember everything up to when I moved to London. I had transferred schools to finish up my last years of college, and I was desperately trying to find an internship with a photographer because that\u2019s all I wanted to do was photography; but I also remember getting into modelling and fashion in order to do that. Dr. Lang told me all of that happened over six and a half years ago, and if I think about it; everything from then until now is just a blur. Then there\u2019s you. There\u2019s something about you that is so familiar, and I recognize your face from somewhere but-.\u201d Her words are cut off when two loud gasps sound from behind her, and she slowly turns around to see two mysterious women stand in the doorway. </p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes widen when he looks from you to his mother Anne and sister Gemma, who both waste no time in barging into the room and engulfing the two of them in hugs. \u201cWe\u2019re so glad you\u2019re both ok,\u201d they say in unison. </p><p>The surprised and panicked look that\u2019s written across Zoe\u2019s face as she awkwardly lets Harry\u2019s mum and sister hug her doesn\u2019t go unnoticed by H, and he can feel his heart wrench at the sight. He steps towards Zoe and her wide gaze instantly snaps to his as it screams volumes to him. With a slight gulp, he speaks up calmly. \u201cZo, this is my mum Anne, and sister Gemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s nice to meet you both,\u201d she replies innocently, which causes Harry to bite down on his bottom lip and close his eyes as he knows this is going to get a rise out of his family. After a quick moment he slowly opens one eye and eventually the other to see Anne and Gemma looking at Zoe oddly. They glance at each other and finally back to Harry, raising their eyebrows in question. He notices Zoe nervously shift from one foot to another out of the corner of his eye, before she timidly\u00a0pushes some stray hair away from her face and decides to speak up again. \u201cUhm, I think I\u2019m going to go back to my room now. The nurses are probably wondering where I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo Zoe, wait,\u201d Harry calls after her, but she\u2019s already disappeared out the door. With a loud sigh as his shoulders slump, he stares at the now empty doorway until Gemma steps into his line of sight.<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cNice to meet us? What did she mean by nice to meet us, Harry?\u201d</p><p>With another huff, Harry looks between his sister and mum before shaking his head slightly. \u201cZoe hit her head pretty bad in the crash a-and she doesn\u2019t remember me, or anything over the past few years for that matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Anne gasps and looks to her son with tear pricked eyes. \u201cHarry, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Gemma whispers to herself before engulfing her brother into another hug. When she pulls away, she subtly tries to wipe away the tears that have escaped her eyes as well and Harry feels as if he could throw up. \u201cWhat about you, hmm? Are you alright?\u201d</p><p>He sends her a soft smile and nods while gesturing to his body. \u201cPretty banged up, but I\u2019ll live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re ok,\u201d Anne speaks up again as she pulls him in for another hug as well, making sure to not hit his slung up shoulder too much. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a miracle that you and Miss Clarke were able to walk away from that crash,\u201d a voice says from the doorway, and the three all turn to see Dr. Lang standing there. \u201cThe paramedics called to the scene last night didn\u2019t know what they were getting into when they saw how bad the wreckage was, but the two of you both have woken up and been walking faster than any of us could have ever anticipated. Zoe\u2019s head trauma and your sprained shoulder is the worst to come out it all, it\u2019s truly amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill pretty shitty,\u201d he mumbles to himself with a deep breath, but his mother and sister give him a knowing look. \u201cWhat about the person who hit us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man driving the other vehicle received minor injuries,\u201d Dr. Lang continues. \u201cHowever, it was determined that he was indeed over the legal limit of alcohol consumption during the time of the crash and has already been picked up by the police.\u201d</p><p>The thoughts of how this situation could\u2019ve ended worse than it already is creep into Harry\u2019s mind, and he grits his teeth at them. Why them? Why did it have to be the absolute love of his life that couldn\u2019t remember him.\u00a0Not that he\u2019d ever wish this upon anyone, but his heart aches at the thought of him and Zoe. He wants nothing more than to pull her into his arms in the tightest most loving hug he could ever give before the two of them head home and continue on with their lives together, but he can\u2019t. She doesn\u2019t know who he is.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s started crying until he notices all eyes are on him now, and everyone is looking at him with looks sorrow and regret, but he doesn\u2019t want their pity. He wants his fianc\u00e9 back, and he\u2019s determined to help her remember regardless of how long it takes. With a shaky breath and the subtle straightening out of his posture, Harry wipes the tears away and glances around at everyone. \u201cSo what are the next steps?\u201d<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve done all that we can in regards of taking care of you and Zoe thus far so the two of you can be released from the hospital this evening,\u201d Dr. Lang explains and lets out a sigh. \u201cI have physiotherapist I can recommend in regards of your shoulder, but it should be healed in a couple of weeks. Zoe however, I\u2019m going to need Zoe to come back and see me at least once a week. I\u2019m going to help as much as I can in helping her remember, and he head injury recovery should be tracked. But Harry, there is a big issue in regards of all of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the two of you were brought in last night, we had to run background checks to determine who you both were. In that we saw everything in regards of Zoe\u2019s father and his passing, for all she knows Mr. Styles, Mr. Clarke is still alive and well back home. She needs to be told about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry responds and shakes her head at the doctor. \u201cThat- that was a terrible year of Zoe\u2019s life, we can\u2019t just make her go through that again. It\u2019ll break her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we can\u2019t let her go on assuming her life prior to meeting you is unfazed because it isn\u2019t,\u201d Dr. Lang states firmly and Harry let\u2019s out a sigh of defeat. \u201cAs much as I hate saying something like this, it is the truth \u2014 being faced with such a traumatic experience could very well help her remember.\u201d</p><p>He closes his eyes at the thought and takes another deep breath, feeling his mum rub his uninjured shoulder soothingly, but being too anxious to care. Dr. Lang is a professional and he can\u2019t argue with that, but the thought of Zoe during the time of her father\u2019s death is enough to break him as well \u2014 but if it\u2019s something that possibly help in getting his Zoe back, it\u2019s something he definitely needs to consider. He glances at his mum and sister before looking back to Dr. Lang and nodding his head. \u201cOk. But let me be the one to tell her, please.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u25c6</b></p><p>Later that day after Anne and Gemma had both gone home, and Harry made a call to his manager and close friend Jeff about everything that has happened in the last 24 hours; him and Zoe are finally being released from the hospital and can go home. </p><p>Harry glances down at his phone to see a text from Jeff saying the driver on the way to pick him and Zoe up should be there in about 10 minutes. He goes to respond to the message, but the quiet sound of someone clearing their throat behind him captures his attention instead and he turns to face them. Zoe is standing in the doorway of his hospital room again, but this time she\u2019s looking a bit flustered. He approaches her cautiously, but isn\u2019t prepared for the emotions she\u2019s trying so hard to contain.\u00a0\u201cUh hey Zoe\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently I\u2019m going home with you,\u201d she starts and shakes her head as if trying to comprehend what\u2019s going on. \u201cBecause we live together\u2026 because we\u2019re <i>engaged</i>.\u201d<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cZo-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the hell did I get engaged?\u201d She cuts him off and begins pacing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, please don\u2019t take this the wrong way but this- I can\u2019t be engaged. Especially to you of all people, that\u2019s insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- I knew I recognized you from somewhere so I asked one of the nurses what your full name was\u2026 You\u2019re Harry Styles. Harry Styles as in one of the five guys that make up one of the biggest boy-bands ever and in some miraculous way, knows me. I can\u2019t do this, oh my god. You\u2019re this major pop star engaged to <i>me</i>. Me? Of all people\u2026 that- I\u2019m going crazy aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoah, hey, it\u2019s alright, there\u2019s no need to get upset,\u201d he pleads with her and moves so he can place his left hand on her shoulder to keep her from pacing. Her stunning blue eyes look at him with panic, but they soften the slightest bit as soon as they meet his green ones. A strand of her light brown hair falls in front of her face and Harry delicately tucks it behind her ear before continuing. \u201cA lot has happened in the last six years Zoe. I was there for the majority of it and if you let me, I\u2019ll gladly tell you all about it. I know it\u2019s hard to even think about right now but I love you more than anything, and if you have any questions, I promise to answer them and maybe it\u2019ll even help you remember. But in order for that to happen \u2014 you need to know that I mean you no harm. We\u2019re in this together. Can you trust me enough to believe that?\u201d</p><p>She continues staring at him for a moment; allowing his words to process in her mind completely before nodding. \u201cI don\u2019t know why because I don\u2019t know you, but yes. I trust you.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s never felt such a wave of relief was over him, and the smile that stretches across his face is enough for the world to know that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s feeling. He doesn\u2019t move from his position so close to her and she makes no indication to move from it either, which has his heart doing a bit of a flip. </p><p>This is where it starts. His mission to get Zoe to remember has commenced and he will do all that he can to make her fall in love with him again. He can\u2019t even stand the thought of this not working out in his favour but he has no choice but to leave that up to fate. With another sigh, he straightens himself out and lets his hand slide off her shoulder. \u201cPerfect. Let\u2019s get you home then, and after a night of rest we can talk about anything you want.\u201d</p></p>",

She hasn&rsquo;t been waiting outside long, but with the rainy weather that&rsquo;s loomed the sky over London for the last 24 hours and with the way strong breezes aggressively whip her hair all over the place &mdash; it feels much longer and has her wondering where Harry had gone to&hellip; that is until his all too familiar voice speaks up from her right. &ldquo;Ready to go?&rdquo; </p><p>With a soft gasp at the sudden presence beside her, Zoe knowingly flutters her glance upwards to look at the source of the noise; seeing her longtime boyfriend er- fianc&eacute;, smiling down at her. The grin that stretches across his mouth is contagious and causes a similar one to slowly make its way onto her lips as well. She hums in response and nods her head before letting out a subtle yawn, allowing Harry to loop their arms together as he leads them towards their awaiting vehicle. </p><p>Five years. It&rsquo;s been five amazing years since Harry drunkenly admitted to Zoe at a party that despite their frenemy like relationship they had for almost a year, he was quite smitten by her and failed miserably at trying to ask her on a date. Little did he know the feeling was mutual and despite her shutting down his drunken demeanor that night, she would proceed to ask him if he&rsquo;d like to join her for coffee the morning after; that of which he took her up on and their relationship began to blossom soon after. Five years later and they&rsquo;re still going strong. </p><p>These two have been through a lot together, and are more than ready for what&rsquo;s to come. </p><p>With his million-dollar smile and a nod to the valet as he hands the young college aged boy a ruffled bill for retrieving their car, Harry flashes her his signature wink as they continue towards the awaiting SUV. The light rain that clouded the sky for the majority of this typical spring day has now begun down pouring, creating an overall gloomy setting for the remainder of the evening; however, Harry is determined to not let that foil any of his plans. </p><p>With it being their anniversary and all, Harry had gone out of his way to plan a special day for the two of them. It consisted of sleeping in, only to wake up to some serious morning cuddles; followed by the making of breakfast together&hellip; which ultimately ended in a food fight, and eventually some shopping. This was all before the day had faded into the evening; where the two shared a very romantic dinner and are now headed home to share a bottle of wine, with the plans of allowing the remainder of the night go wherever it takes them. </p><p>What made such a simple day so significant for them is that they are simply each other&rsquo;s person, and there&rsquo;s no doubt about it. The love that has developed between them is undeniable, and it was even showcased to everyone over these past holidays when Harry surprised Zoe with a ring while knelt down on one knee &mdash; asking for her to be his forever opponent in scrabble and person to be by his side in everything that he did from then on; which, of course, she happily agreed to.</p><p>As he walks her around to the passenger side of the vehicle, he presses a quick kiss to the side of her head before silently opening the door and helping her in.</p><p>Zoe can&rsquo;t help but feel the familiar swelling of love and admiration she has for this man as she watches him quickly rush back around to the driver&rsquo;s side of the car so they can begin the drive home; causing her to smile as pleasant thoughts slowly begin filling her mind. These past few years together have been the perfect build up for what&rsquo;s to come this upcoming autumn when they both agree to be each other&rsquo;s forever person, and she simply cannot wait to spend the rest of her life with the man who&rsquo;s sending her another cheeky wink as he climbs into his seat and begins driving off. </p><p>The majority of the ride home is spent in comfortable silence, and neither of them really make a move to change that. Zoe stares out the window at the water pellets that continue hitting the glass and allows her mind to start wandering. Harry notices her slowly getting lost in her thoughts and smiles to himself as he faces forward again to continue observing the road ahead of him; rhythmically tapping his thumbs against the steering wheel as a Led Zeppelin song starts softly playing from the radio. </p><p>He watches the windshield wipers work fast to push away the rain as he notices the lights ahead changing, and begins slowing down. The slight movement from her to his left catches his attention as he comes to a stop at the red light, and looks over to see that she&rsquo;s shifted into a more comfortable position. She sends him a sleepy smile before reaching her hand towards him to hold onto. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for today H,&rdquo; Zoe speaks up softly as Harry links their hands together and rubs his thumb gently over her knuckles. </p><p>&ldquo;My pleasure love,&rdquo; he responds and sends her a quick glance before looking back towards the road. &ldquo;M&rsquo;glad you&rsquo;re not sick of me yet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Could never get sick of you. Want to spend the rest of my life with you, yeh twit,&rdquo; she snaps and causes an eruption of chuckle from him. She stays silent for a moment before shifting again to get a better look at him. Harry can see her nervously chewing on her bottom lip from the corner of his eye and is about to say something, but she beats him to it. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t want myself starting a family with anyone else but you either.&rdquo;</p><p>A not so subtle grin dances over his lips as he glances over at her with raised eyebrows. A family huh? That&rsquo;s something Harry&rsquo;s been thinking about a lot lately. The thought of a small bean smiling greatly at him whenever he got home from the studio or whatever he&rsquo;d done that day that is the perfect mix of him and the woman he loves is absolutely mind blowing to him, but he loves it. He and Zoe have talked about it before &mdash; both agreeing that they would like to start a family together, but not until the time was right. So Harry never pushed for it after that however, the thought alone tends to spark something within him. &ldquo;Glad the feelings mutual. But there&rsquo;s no need to pressure ourselves about kids Zo. Whenever you&rsquo;re ready, you know that I&rsquo;ll be ready as well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know. I- I&rsquo;ve actually been thinking of weaning off my birth control and just see what happens after that. I mean, if it takes a little bit that&rsquo;s fine because we&rsquo;re only 25 and have our full lives ahead of us&hellip; ugh I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; </p><p>Harry can&rsquo;t help but smirk a little at her dramatics and doesn&rsquo;t let it show because he fully understands where she&rsquo;s coming from. He gently pulls her hand towards his lips to place a soft peck onto her knuckles as a comforting gesture. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on board with whatever you&rsquo;re comfortable with love, we&rsquo;re in this together.&rdquo;<b><br /></b></p><p>The light turns green and Zoe let&rsquo;s go of his hand to shift her position again as he begins pulling forward. She let&rsquo;s what he said sink in and starts thinking of everything she and Harry need to do for this wedding on top of just the thought of having a baby, and how a lot of it will be happening very soon. With a gentle nibble on her bottom lip, she sends him a sideways glance before looking right at him and mumbling a soft &ldquo;Harry?&rdquo;</p><p>He hums in response and glances over at her. His eyes meet hers as he waits for her to continue, but they only hold her gaze for a quick second before something catches his attention and he looks to the window; feeling his breath hitch almost immediately. Outside a bright pair of headlights seem to be getting increasingly closer as they head straight through the intersection towards their car from the opposite direction the two of them are traveling. The painful sound of screeching tires echo in his ears and despite how hard he tries; there just isn&rsquo;t time for Harry to react before the lights become blinding just as the other vehicle crashes into Zoe&rsquo;s side of the car, and everything goes black. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>A few hours later he slowly comes to his senses alone in a hospital room. His head is pounding and the way his right arm is resting in a sling throws him off a bit, but he couldn&rsquo;t care less as he begins scrambling out of the hospital bed so he can find out where the hell Zoe is. </p><p>&ldquo;Sir you shouldn&rsquo;t be standing,&rdquo; a concerned voice speaks up from the doorway and his gaze moves to meet that of a nurse &mdash; who wastes no time in entering the room in attempts to try to get him to sit back down. </p><p>&ldquo;Zoe,&rdquo; he mumbles, and the nurse looks at him questionably. &ldquo;T-they brought me here with a woman. Where is she? Is she ok?&rdquo;</p><p>The nurses firm features soften at the mention of this before letting out a sigh and glancing away from him. &ldquo;Miss Clarke is&hellip; awake.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; He asks desperately and moves around her &mdash; making a quick b-line for the door. </p><p>&ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t go see her yet. You need to rest,&rdquo; the nurse pleads and continues trying to stop him, but is unsuccessful as he takes a sharp left and starts heading down the hallway. &ldquo;She-.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about me. I need to see her.&rdquo;</p><p>He continues down the hall with purpose, determined to find Zoe if it&rsquo;s the last thing he does. However, it doesn&rsquo;t take him long for only a couple doors down from where he&rsquo;d woken up, her voice can be heard sounding rather panicked. Without any hesitation he rushes towards the commotion&nbsp;before coming to a complete stop in the open doorway, instantly feeling his heart drop to the pit of his stomach once he sees her.</p><p>She&rsquo;s sat up in the hospital bed &mdash; covered in multiple bandages that attempt to conceal the various cuts and marks that litter her skin; the most noticeable being the large piece of gauze that is wrapped around her head which also allows him to take in the other small scratches and black eye that now cover her pretty face. Her gaze meets his as soon as he comes into view, but soon snaps back to the nurse who&rsquo;s desperately telling her not to move so much as she tries to adjust some of the bandages. </p><p>Harry&rsquo;s never felt his heart break so much as he watches Zoe stressfully plead with the nurse to just give her some space, and once she closes her eyes out of frustration, shaking her head as the tears start flooding out, he just can&rsquo;t take anymore. With a deep breath, he takes a few long strides further into the room and gains her attention yet again. The way she looks at him so blankly throws him off a bit, but he tries to not think about it as he shakes his head and starts pleading. &ldquo;Zoe, love, they&rsquo;re just trying to help you. Please let them.&rdquo;</p><p>A moment passes, and she continues silently staring at him with an empty gaze. He doesn&rsquo;t know what else to say, so without any other words he allows his feet to shuffle across the floor until he&rsquo;s at the side of her bed. With a sad smile, he reaches out to grab hold of your hand so he can rub his thumb over her knuckles like he always does as a gesture to give a sense of comfort to her as well as himself &nbsp;but when she flinches away from his touch, it catches him completely off guard. His eyes widen and look at you incredulously as he convinces himself you didn&rsquo;t mean to move away as if you were scared of him &mdash; &nbsp;but when his eyes meet hers and he&rsquo;s met with the panic alarm that dances across them, he&rsquo;s still unable to prepare himself for when her scratchy voice asks a heart shattering, and earth rattling question. &ldquo;W-who are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9670;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean she doesn&rsquo;t remember?&rdquo; Harry questions as he paces in the hallway outside of Zoe&rsquo;s hospital room, nervously tugging at his curls with his free hand as he does so. The doctor and two male nurses that entered the room out of nowhere just to pull him from it stare at him and wait until he lets out a sigh of defeat, before leaning against the wall and sliding down it until he hits the floor with a thud. </p><p>&ldquo;Miss Clarke-.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Zoe, her name is Zoe,&rdquo; he corrects the doctor as he stares straight ahead of him, not making eye contact with any of the people who watch him. </p><p>&ldquo;Zoe,&rdquo; the doctor speaks up again as she watches him carefully. &ldquo;Suffered quite a bit of head trauma in the accident Mr. Styles. It&rsquo;s a miracle that she&rsquo;s even awake right now. However, as a result of this, she seems to have developed a type of amnesia. We don&rsquo;t know the severity of it for she has been rather anxious since she woke up. As of right now, rest will be the best treatment for her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what am I supposed to do, just sit here and hope she remembers who I am? Try to convince her I&rsquo;m not some stranger, that I&rsquo;m-,&rdquo; he cuts himself off when the sob he&rsquo;d been trying so hard to suppress finally escapes. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got to remember&hellip; she- we&rsquo;re supposed to get married.&rdquo;</p><p>The doctor looks down at him sympathetically before looking to the two nurses and nodding, silently dismissing them so she can talk to Harry alone. He still doesn&rsquo;t make eye contact with her as he lets out numerous shaky breaths and leans his head back against the wall. With caution, the doctor slowly crouches down until she&rsquo;s eye level with Harry and speaks up again. &ldquo;You can help her you know?&rdquo;</p><p>This catches his attention and he soon snaps his gaze to hers as he lets out another breath. &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well based off what I&rsquo;ve seen and know, I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that a lot of Zoe&rsquo;s greatest and fondest memories include you in one way or another,&rdquo; she starts, and Harry raises an eyebrow at her skeptically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve also picked up on how she doesn&rsquo;t have any family here in London, when she&rsquo;s released from the hospital, she&rsquo;ll have nowhere to go but with you. It may take a little bit to prepare her for that, but when you are both released, use that time to show her about her life with you. The little things, the big things, whatever you think could possibly help her remember even the slightest bit of anything from the past six years of her life, it&rsquo;ll be a great start to helping get her memory back if that&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;re able to do. It&rsquo;s going to require some time and patience though Harry, do you think you can do that?&rdquo;</p><p>He lets her words sink in before shutting his eyes and slowly nodding his head. &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perfect,&rdquo; she replies and stands up straight again. &ldquo;Now, she&rsquo;s not the only one who needs to heal either. You need rest as well, that sprained shoulder isn&rsquo;t going to heal itself if you don&rsquo;t let it. Why don&rsquo;t you head back to your room and a nurse will come check on you shortly? If you have any more questions at all, just ask for Doctor Lang; I&rsquo;m the doctor looking after the two of you.&rdquo; With a curt nod and hum in response, Harry slowly stands back up from the ground and shuffles down the hallway; ready to get some rest after the worst day of his life. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9670;</p><p>The next morning, sunlight shines through the thin curtains that cover the hospital room window; and Harry slowly allows his eyes to flutter open. A subtle throbbing in his head makes itself known as he lets out a groan and jumps a bit when he&rsquo;s met with a timid presence standing in his doorway. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; Zoe mutters and steps backwards, gasping when her shoulder comes in contact with the doorframe. Her face reddens as she steadies herself and starts looking around the room at anything but Harry&rsquo;s eyes. While struggling to form a sentence out of the words she&rsquo;s desperately trying to say, Zoe can feel her heart start pounding in her chest and has to take a breath to calm herself down. &ldquo;I-I didn&rsquo;t mean to stare, it&rsquo;s just that the nurses told me you and I know each other somehow so, I thought if I really looked at you, I&rsquo;d recognize you&hellip; but I don&rsquo;t remember and I&rsquo;m trying to, I really am, but I don&rsquo;t know how and-.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey hey hey, it&rsquo;s ok. It&rsquo;s ok,&rdquo; he speaks up quickly but softly as he sees just how flustered she is becoming and moves as fast as his feet let him, so he can be by her side. He instinctively grabs her hands and gives them a little squeeze, but when she just stares back at him with wide eyes; he knows maybe he shouldn&rsquo;t do such a gesture. With a heavy sigh he lets go of her hands and allows his to fall to his sides awkwardly. He hates this. He wants nothing more than to just pull her against his chest and hug her tightly &mdash; whispering how everything was going to be ok, all while minding the bandages and now scabbed over scratches that still cover her skin. The way she stares back at him without the usual glint of excitement that&rsquo;s there whenever she sees him breaks his heart, and he slowly has to look away from her as it becomes too much before speaking up again. &ldquo;I- uhm, m&rsquo;Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been told. I&rsquo;m Zoe, which I guess you already know,&rdquo; she tells him with a slight smile, and he nods in agreement. She shuffles awkwardly on her feet while biting down on her lip nervously and shyly glancing away from him. Slowly, she allows her gaze to fall back on him and although she&rsquo;s feeling rather nervous about conversing with this stranger, there&rsquo;s just something about him that feels familiar &mdash; almost as if it&rsquo;s a giant magnet pulling her towards him. &ldquo;I just- I feel like I know you, but I&rsquo;m not sure how&hellip; I&rsquo;m sorry, the nurses said that we were in this accident together and I hit my head pretty bad and that&rsquo;s why I can&rsquo;t remember, but it&rsquo;s really a lot to take in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; he agrees and lets out a soft breath. &ldquo;What exactly do you remember?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I remember everything up to when I moved to London. I had transferred schools to finish up my last years of college, and I was desperately trying to find an internship with a photographer because that&rsquo;s all I wanted to do was photography; but I also remember getting into modelling and fashion in order to do that. Dr. Lang told me all of that happened over six and a half years ago, and if I think about it; everything from then until now is just a blur. Then there&rsquo;s you. There&rsquo;s something about you that is so familiar, and I recognize your face from somewhere but-.&rdquo; Her words are cut off when two loud gasps sound from behind her, and she slowly turns around to see two mysterious women stand in the doorway. </p><p>Harry&rsquo;s eyes widen when he looks from you to his mother Anne and sister Gemma, who both waste no time in barging into the room and engulfing the two of them in hugs. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re so glad you&rsquo;re both ok,&rdquo; they say in unison. </p><p>The surprised and panicked look that&rsquo;s written across Zoe&rsquo;s face as she awkwardly lets Harry&rsquo;s mum and sister hug her doesn&rsquo;t go unnoticed by H, and he can feel his heart wrench at the sight. He steps towards Zoe and her wide gaze instantly snaps to his as it screams volumes to him. With a slight gulp, he speaks up calmly. &ldquo;Zo, this is my mum Anne, and sister Gemma.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s nice to meet you both,&rdquo; she replies innocently, which causes Harry to bite down on his bottom lip and close his eyes as he knows this is going to get a rise out of his family. After a quick moment he slowly opens one eye and eventually the other to see Anne and Gemma looking at Zoe oddly. They glance at each other and finally back to Harry, raising their eyebrows in question. He notices Zoe nervously shift from one foot to another out of the corner of his eye, before she timidly&nbsp;pushes some stray hair away from her face and decides to speak up again. &ldquo;Uhm, I think I&rsquo;m going to go back to my room now. The nurses are probably wondering where I am.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No Zoe, wait,&rdquo; Harry calls after her, but she&rsquo;s already disappeared out the door. With a loud sigh as his shoulders slump, he stares at the now empty doorway until Gemma steps into his line of sight.<b><br /></b></p><p>&ldquo;Nice to meet us? What did she mean by nice to meet us, Harry?&rdquo;</p><p>With another huff, Harry looks between his sister and mum before shaking his head slightly. &ldquo;Zoe hit her head pretty bad in the crash a-and she doesn&rsquo;t remember me, or anything over the past few years for that matter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Anne gasps and looks to her son with tear pricked eyes. &ldquo;Harry, I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god,&rdquo; Gemma whispers to herself before engulfing her brother into another hug. When she pulls away, she subtly tries to wipe away the tears that have escaped her eyes as well and Harry feels as if he could throw up. &ldquo;What about you, hmm? Are you alright?&rdquo;</p><p>He sends her a soft smile and nods while gesturing to his body. &ldquo;Pretty banged up, but I&rsquo;ll live.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God, I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re ok,&rdquo; Anne speaks up again as she pulls him in for another hug as well, making sure to not hit his slung up shoulder too much. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a miracle that you and Miss Clarke were able to walk away from that crash,&rdquo; a voice says from the doorway, and the three all turn to see Dr. Lang standing there. &ldquo;The paramedics called to the scene last night didn&rsquo;t know what they were getting into when they saw how bad the wreckage was, but the two of you both have woken up and been walking faster than any of us could have ever anticipated. Zoe&rsquo;s head trauma and your sprained shoulder is the worst to come out it all, it&rsquo;s truly amazing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Still pretty shitty,&rdquo; he mumbles to himself with a deep breath, but his mother and sister give him a knowing look. &ldquo;What about the person who hit us?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The man driving the other vehicle received minor injuries,&rdquo; Dr. Lang continues. &ldquo;However, it was determined that he was indeed over the legal limit of alcohol consumption during the time of the crash and has already been picked up by the police.&rdquo;</p><p>The thoughts of how this situation could&rsquo;ve ended worse than it already is creep into Harry&rsquo;s mind, and he grits his teeth at them. Why them? Why did it have to be the absolute love of his life that couldn&rsquo;t remember him.&nbsp;Not that he&rsquo;d ever wish this upon anyone, but his heart aches at the thought of him and Zoe. He wants nothing more than to pull her into his arms in the tightest most loving hug he could ever give before the two of them head home and continue on with their lives together, but he can&rsquo;t. She doesn&rsquo;t know who he is.</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t realize he&rsquo;s started crying until he notices all eyes are on him now, and everyone is looking at him with looks sorrow and regret, but he doesn&rsquo;t want their pity. He wants his fianc&eacute; back, and he&rsquo;s determined to help her remember regardless of how long it takes. With a shaky breath and the subtle straightening out of his posture, Harry wipes the tears away and glances around at everyone. &ldquo;So what are the next steps?&rdquo;<b><br /></b></p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done all that we can in regards of taking care of you and Zoe thus far so the two of you can be released from the hospital this evening,&rdquo; Dr. Lang explains and lets out a sigh. &ldquo;I have physiotherapist I can recommend in regards of your shoulder, but it should be healed in a couple of weeks. Zoe however, I&rsquo;m going to need Zoe to come back and see me at least once a week. I&rsquo;m going to help as much as I can in helping her remember, and he head injury recovery should be tracked. But Harry, there is a big issue in regards of all of this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When the two of you were brought in last night, we had to run background checks to determine who you both were. In that we saw everything in regards of Zoe&rsquo;s father and his passing, for all she knows Mr. Styles, Mr. Clarke is still alive and well back home. She needs to be told about this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Harry responds and shakes her head at the doctor. &ldquo;That- that was a terrible year of Zoe&rsquo;s life, we can&rsquo;t just make her go through that again. It&rsquo;ll break her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t let her go on assuming her life prior to meeting you is unfazed because it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Dr. Lang states firmly and Harry let&rsquo;s out a sigh of defeat. &ldquo;As much as I hate saying something like this, it is the truth &mdash; being faced with such a traumatic experience could very well help her remember.&rdquo;</p><p>He closes his eyes at the thought and takes another deep breath, feeling his mum rub his uninjured shoulder soothingly, but being too anxious to care. Dr. Lang is a professional and he can&rsquo;t argue with that, but the thought of Zoe during the time of her father&rsquo;s death is enough to break him as well &mdash; but if it&rsquo;s something that possibly help in getting his Zoe back, it&rsquo;s something he definitely needs to consider. He glances at his mum and sister before looking back to Dr. Lang and nodding his head. &ldquo;Ok. But let me be the one to tell her, please.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9670;</b></p><p>Later that day after Anne and Gemma had both gone home, and Harry made a call to his manager and close friend Jeff about everything that has happened in the last 24 hours; him and Zoe are finally being released from the hospital and can go home. </p><p>Harry glances down at his phone to see a text from Jeff saying the driver on the way to pick him and Zoe up should be there in about 10 minutes. He goes to respond to the message, but the quiet sound of someone clearing their throat behind him captures his attention instead and he turns to face them. Zoe is standing in the doorway of his hospital room again, but this time she&rsquo;s looking a bit flustered. He approaches her cautiously, but isn&rsquo;t prepared for the emotions she&rsquo;s trying so hard to contain.&nbsp;&ldquo;Uh hey Zoe&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Apparently I&rsquo;m going home with you,&rdquo; she starts and shakes her head as if trying to comprehend what&rsquo;s going on. &ldquo;Because we live together&hellip; because we&rsquo;re <i>engaged</i>.&rdquo;<b><br /></b></p><p>&ldquo;Zo-.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When the hell did I get engaged?&rdquo; She cuts him off and begins pacing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, please don&rsquo;t take this the wrong way but this- I can&rsquo;t be engaged. Especially to you of all people, that&rsquo;s insane.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I- I knew I recognized you from somewhere so I asked one of the nurses what your full name was&hellip; You&rsquo;re Harry Styles. Harry Styles as in one of the five guys that make up one of the biggest boy-bands ever and in some miraculous way, knows me. I can&rsquo;t do this, oh my god. You&rsquo;re this major pop star engaged to <i>me</i>. Me? Of all people&hellip; that- I&rsquo;m going crazy aren&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Woah, hey, it&rsquo;s alright, there&rsquo;s no need to get upset,&rdquo; he pleads with her and moves so he can place his left hand on her shoulder to keep her from pacing. Her stunning blue eyes look at him with panic, but they soften the slightest bit as soon as they meet his green ones. A strand of her light brown hair falls in front of her face and Harry delicately tucks it behind her ear before continuing. &ldquo;A lot has happened in the last six years Zoe. I was there for the majority of it and if you let me, I&rsquo;ll gladly tell you all about it. I know it&rsquo;s hard to even think about right now but I love you more than anything, and if you have any questions, I promise to answer them and maybe it&rsquo;ll even help you remember. But in order for that to happen &mdash; you need to know that I mean you no harm. We&rsquo;re in this together. Can you trust me enough to believe that?&rdquo;</p><p>She continues staring at him for a moment; allowing his words to process in her mind completely before nodding. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why because I don&rsquo;t know you, but yes. I trust you.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s never felt such a wave of relief was over him, and the smile that stretches across his face is enough for the world to know that&rsquo;s exactly what he&rsquo;s feeling. He doesn&rsquo;t move from his position so close to her and she makes no indication to move from it either, which has his heart doing a bit of a flip. </p><p>This is where it starts. His mission to get Zoe to remember has commenced and he will do all that he can to make her fall in love with him again. He can&rsquo;t even stand the thought of this not working out in his favour but he has no choice but to leave that up to fate. With another sigh, he straightens himself out and lets his hand slide off her shoulder. &ldquo;Perfect. Let&rsquo;s get you home then, and after a night of rest we can talk about anything you want.&rdquo;</p></p>",

She hasn&rsquo;t been waiting outside long, but with the rainy weather that&rsquo;s loomed the sky over London for the last 24 hours and with the way strong breezes aggressively whip her hair all over the place &mdash; it feels much longer and has her wondering where Harry had gone to&hellip; that is until his all too familiar voice speaks up from her right. &ldquo;Ready to go?&rdquo; </p>\n<p>With a soft gasp at the sudden presence beside her, Zoe knowingly flutters her glance upwards to look at the source of the noise; seeing her longtime boyfriend er- fianc&eacute;, smiling down at her. The grin that stretches across his mouth is contagious and causes a similar one to slowly make its way onto her lips as well. She hums in response and nods her head before letting out a subtle yawn, allowing Harry to loop their arms together as he leads them towards their awaiting vehicle. </p>\n<p>Five years. It&rsquo;s been five amazing years since Harry drunkenly admitted to Zoe at a party that despite their frenemy like relationship they had for almost a year, he was quite smitten by her and failed miserably at trying to ask her on a date. Little did he know the feeling was mutual and despite her shutting down his drunken demeanor that night, she would proceed to ask him if he&rsquo;d like to join her for coffee the morning after; that of which he took her up on and their relationship began to blossom soon after. Five years later and they&rsquo;re still going strong. </p>\n<p>These two have been through a lot together, and are more than ready for what&rsquo;s to come. </p>\n<p>With his million-dollar smile and a nod to the valet as he hands the young college aged boy a ruffled bill for retrieving their car, Harry flashes her his signature wink as they continue towards the awaiting SUV. The light rain that clouded the sky for the majority of this typical spring day has now begun down pouring, creating an overall gloomy setting for the remainder of the evening; however, Harry is determined to not let that foil any of his plans. </p>\n<p>With it being their anniversary and all, Harry had gone out of his way to plan a special day for the two of them. It consisted of sleeping in, only to wake up to some serious morning cuddles; followed by the making of breakfast together&hellip; which ultimately ended in a food fight, and eventually some shopping. This was all before the day had faded into the evening; where the two shared a very romantic dinner and are now headed home to share a bottle of wine, with the plans of allowing the remainder of the night go wherever it takes them. </p>\n<p>What made such a simple day so significant for them is that they are simply each other&rsquo;s person, and there&rsquo;s no doubt about it. The love that has developed between them is undeniable, and it was even showcased to everyone over these past holidays when Harry surprised Zoe with a ring while knelt down on one knee &mdash; asking for her to be his forever opponent in scrabble and person to be by his side in everything that he did from then on; which, of course, she happily agreed to.</p>\n<p>As he walks her around to the passenger side of the vehicle, he presses a quick kiss to the side of her head before silently opening the door and helping her in.</p>\n<p>Zoe can&rsquo;t help but feel the familiar swelling of love and admiration she has for this man as she watches him quickly rush back around to the driver&rsquo;s side of the car so they can begin the drive home; causing her to smile as pleasant thoughts slowly begin filling her mind. These past few years together have been the perfect build up for what&rsquo;s to come this upcoming autumn when they both agree to be each other&rsquo;s forever person, and she simply cannot wait to spend the rest of her life with the man who&rsquo;s sending her another cheeky wink as he climbs into his seat and begins driving off. </p>\n<p>The majority of the ride home is spent in comfortable silence, and neither of them really make a move to change that. Zoe stares out the window at the water pellets that continue hitting the glass and allows her mind to start wandering. Harry notices her slowly getting lost in her thoughts and smiles to himself as he faces forward again to continue observing the road ahead of him; rhythmically tapping his thumbs against the steering wheel as a Led Zeppelin song starts softly playing from the radio. </p>\n<p>He watches the windshield wipers work fast to push away the rain as he notices the lights ahead changing, and begins slowing down. The slight movement from her to his left catches his attention as he comes to a stop at the red light, and looks over to see that she&rsquo;s shifted into a more comfortable position. She sends him a sleepy smile before reaching her hand towards him to hold onto. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Thank you for today H,&rdquo; Zoe speaks up softly as Harry links their hands together and rubs his thumb gently over her knuckles. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;My pleasure love,&rdquo; he responds and sends her a quick glance before looking back towards the road. &ldquo;M&rsquo;glad you&rsquo;re not sick of me yet.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Could never get sick of you. Want to spend the rest of my life with you, yeh twit,&rdquo; she snaps and causes an eruption of chuckle from him. She stays silent for a moment before shifting again to get a better look at him. Harry can see her nervously chewing on her bottom lip from the corner of his eye and is about to say something, but she beats him to it. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t want myself starting a family with anyone else but you either.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A not so subtle grin dances over his lips as he glances over at her with raised eyebrows. A family huh? That&rsquo;s something Harry&rsquo;s been thinking about a lot lately. The thought of a small bean smiling greatly at him whenever he got home from the studio or whatever he&rsquo;d done that day that is the perfect mix of him and the woman he loves is absolutely mind blowing to him, but he loves it. He and Zoe have talked about it before &mdash; both agreeing that they would like to start a family together, but not until the time was right. So Harry never pushed for it after that however, the thought alone tends to spark something within him. &ldquo;Glad the feelings mutual. But there&rsquo;s no need to pressure ourselves about kids Zo. Whenever you&rsquo;re ready, you know that I&rsquo;ll be ready as well.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I know. I- I&rsquo;ve actually been thinking of weaning off my birth control and just see what happens after that. I mean, if it takes a little bit that&rsquo;s fine because we&rsquo;re only 25 and have our full lives ahead of us&hellip; ugh I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>Harry can&rsquo;t help but smirk a little at her dramatics and doesn&rsquo;t let it show because he fully understands where she&rsquo;s coming from. He gently pulls her hand towards his lips to place a soft peck onto her knuckles as a comforting gesture. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on board with whatever you&rsquo;re comfortable with love, we&rsquo;re in this together.&rdquo;<b><br /></b></p>\n<p>The light turns green and Zoe let&rsquo;s go of his hand to shift her position again as he begins pulling forward. She let&rsquo;s what he said sink in and starts thinking of everything she and Harry need to do for this wedding on top of just the thought of having a baby, and how a lot of it will be happening very soon. With a gentle nibble on her bottom lip, she sends him a sideways glance before looking right at him and mumbling a soft &ldquo;Harry?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He hums in response and glances over at her. His eyes meet hers as he waits for her to continue, but they only hold her gaze for a quick second before something catches his attention and he looks to the window; feeling his breath hitch almost immediately. Outside a bright pair of headlights seem to be getting increasingly closer as they head straight through the intersection towards their car from the opposite direction the two of them are traveling. The painful sound of screeching tires echo in his ears and despite how hard he tries; there just isn&rsquo;t time for Harry to react before the lights become blinding just as the other vehicle crashes into Zoe&rsquo;s side of the car, and everything goes black. </p>\n</p>",
