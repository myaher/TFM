After a moment, the brief hostility and buster fades, and Beau slouches against the wall, at least as much as she can with the corset clinging to her waist. &ldquo;I just&hellip;I&rsquo;ve never felt comfortable like this. There&rsquo;s a reason why my parents&hellip;didn&rsquo;t&hellip;want me. I can&rsquo;t be <i>this</i>. All girly and proper. It&rsquo;s not me.&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s a moment of silence, and she braces herself for whatever comment Molly is going to make. Then, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve always looked pretty damn good in dresses.&rdquo;</p><p>Her head snaps up. To her surprise, he&rsquo;s genuine, with an understanding smile instead of his usual condescending bullshit. He looks between the two of them, considering. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re about the same size, yeah? Let&rsquo;s switch.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Molly, you don&rsquo;t have to&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I want to. I was lying before, anyways. You look ridiculous in that. Wrong color for you. I&rsquo;d look way better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dick.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Asshole. Now, get to stripping. We&rsquo;ve got a party to crash.&rdquo;</p>",

        "body": "<p>Crfemslash week day 5 prompt: Family. \u00a0Don\u2019t have much to say here, more notes at the end. \u00a0If you like, leave a review, a reblog or a comment please, really makes me feel better as a writer to get feedback of any kind</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d a voice came from behind her. </p><p>Kaylie half smiled without turning around, \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t sneak up on someone as nervous as me like that,\u201d she said as she did her best to fix her hair in the mirror. \u00a0\u00a0Her short hair was easy to manage, but hard to do things with and she wanted to try something special, if only for today.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Scanlan said unworried, \u201cbut it&rsquo;s a father&rsquo;s right to see his little girl on her big dad and tell her how proud of her he is.\u201d</p><p>Four years ago Kaylie would have laughed at the idea of wanting Scanlan, her father, to be proud of her. \u00a0Four years ago he was just some silver tongued asshole who had knocked her mother up and abandoned them. Four years ago the only thing she wanted to do was humiliate and kill him, but they were both better people now. He had helped save the world, had showed her how good of a man and a father he could be, and they both learned that love and forgiveness went a lot farther than the songs and stories made it out to be. \u00a0It had put her on a better path, it had led her to the woman who she loved and loved her, even if Scanlan didn&rsquo;t know it, for that alone she&rsquo;d forgive him for pretty much anything. \u201cThanks dad,\u201d Kaylie said turning around and giving her father a hug, growing up she had never known what it was like to have a father&rsquo;s love, turns out it&rsquo;s pretty alright. \u00a0\u201cI mean it, hearing you say that means more than you know.\u201d \u00a0Before they could break the embrace she heard \u00a0sniffing sound, \u201care you crying old man,\u201d she teased because her eyes definitely were not watering up.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Scanlan said easily, he had learned long ago that lying to the people you cared about led to nothing good and neither did keeping things from them. \u00a0\u201cI&rsquo;m just so happy for you, I know we didn&rsquo;t meet under the best of circumstances Kaylie,\u201d both of them tried very hard to forget what led to him finding out who she was, \u201cbut the fact that I&rsquo;ve had you in my life has made me a better man. \u00a0I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m a good man yet, but I&rsquo;ll never stop trying to be the father you deserve, I promise.\u201d \u00a0Since the battle with Raishan he had never broken a promise to her, and he wasn&rsquo;t going to start now.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting their old man,\u201d Kaylie said her voice dripping with affection. \u00a0\u201cI still can\u2019t believe I\u2019m here though. A few years ago, I was the bastard daughter of a quilter in Kymal who made her living playing flute in a band of rogues and thieves. \u00a0My only goal in life was to track you down and kill you. \u00a0Now I\u2019m here, getting married to a high lady and real noblewoman, I can\u2019t say I understand what she sees in me-,\u201d Kaylie stated to say, but Scanlan cut her off.</p><p>\u201cShe sees someone special and amazing, Kaylie, she sees someone she loves and wants to spend the rest of her life with,\u201d Scanlan assured his daughter. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard to believe how loved you are, I\u2019ve had that problem to, sometimes it\u2019s easier to just run than stay and figure that out,\u201d he said ashamed. \u00a0\u201cBut trust me it\u2019s always worth it to stay, if you\u2019re going to take anything away from me and our time together take that piece of knowledge. \u00a0I didn\u2019t learn it until a few years ago, maybe my life would have been better if I learned it earlier. \u00a0Maybe I would have been a man worthy of being your father earlier. \u00a0But, not more of that nonsense,\u201d Scanlan said offering his little girl hsi arm, \u201cshall we?\u201d </p><p>Smiling, Kaylie took his arm, \u201ccome on old man, let&rsquo;s go meet my woman.\u201d \u00a0With that the two gnomes walked arm and arm down the halls of Whitestone Castle until they reached the great hall. Kynan and his riflemen lined the hall like honor guards and opened the door with a smile. \u00a0They waited five beats until the music started and started their walk down the aisle. \u00a0Dr. Dranzel\u2019s violin softly sung through the air as it was played deftly by the half-orcs massive hands. \u00a0The good doctor was doing his best to hold back tears of pride as he watched his two proteges walk to the altar. \u00a0Esilmere and Kent playing the wedding march along with their boss keeping him in line. \u00a0Zedd sat with Samson in the front row of her guests, just so Kaylie could keep an eye on them. \u00a0</p><p>When she approached the troupe a few months ago to ask them to play at her wedding she made them promise none of their normal trickery shit. \u00a0No panhandling or pickpocketing, no swiping the silverware and plates, just a simple easy gig and they\u2019d be paid more gold then they\u2019d ever get pickpocketing and she wouldn\u2019t remind her soon to be sister in law of what happened in Greyskull. \u00a0She could do things like this as the court bard of Whitestone.</p><p>JB Trickfoot and Grog stood on her side as her bridesmaids while Keyleth and Vex stood opposite of them, they were all smiling at her, Grog was crying, and Kaylie did her best to smile back. \u00a0\u00a0Pike stood at the altar ready to marry her and her bride to be, looking proud and angelic as always. \u00a0It was the longest walk of Kaylie\u2019s life, she didn\u2019t want to bolt but her feet sure did, every instinct screamed to run, despite what she wanted, but she managed to get to the end of the aisle somehow. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m very proud of you,\u201d Scanlan said kissing his daughter on the cheek before taking his place.</p><p>And then Kaylie felt alone up there, even though she had the most powerful people in all of Exandria in her corner. \u00a0But fear wasn\u2019t logical, even surrounded by friends and family, she was terrified and her heart felt like it was exploding. \u00a0It seemed like an eternity until Dr. Dranzel started up the wedding march again, and then she saw her, Cassandra De Rolo the Lady of Whitestone and the love of Kaylie\u2019s life walking side by side with her brother. \u00a0Suddenly, all the nerves were gone and the only thing that mattered was Cassandra. \u00a0She looked beautiful, a traditional long white gown that hugged her frame in a respectable manner, her long white and brown hair tied back in braids. \u00a0Everything just seemed okay for the young Shorthalt now that she was here.</p><p>It felt like it took forever for them to reach the altar, but at the same time it felt like they were there in an instant. \u00a0Percival kissed his sister\u2019s cheek and muttered a, \u201cyou look beautiful Cass,\u201d before giving a nod to Kaylie and taking his place. He didn\u2019t need to give Kaylie a warning, he given her one already when the engagement was first announced, nothing rude or overtly threatening just a warning from a man who had lost everything and was slowly getting back what he had lost and do anything to make sure no one took it away from him again. \u00a0</p><p>Cassandra ascended the dias where Kaylie and brought their hands together, \u201cYou look beautiful Kaylie,\u201d Cassandra said sweetly, she felt no need to pretend to be a stuffy aristocrat, not now, not with her love on their day. \u00a0Kaylie didn\u2019t even hear much of what Pike was saying, Cassandra de Rolo was the only thing that mattered until Pike said, \u201cthe brides have written their own vows, and wish to share them with us. \u00a0Cassandra if you will,\u201d she nodded to the de Rolo so she could start.</p><p>\u201cKay,\u201d Cassandra started, \u201cI\u2019ve been used my whole life, the Briars kept me as a pet, a trophy, and a tool, Vecna used me as a pawn to hurt the people who love me,\u201d she paused, taking her eyes off of Kaylie for just a moment to look at her brother and her sisters before turning back to gaze into Kaylie\u2019s beautiful brown eyes. \u00a0\u201cEven after I became the Lady of Whitestone far too many noblemen and far too few noblewomen sought my hand to gain a foothold in Whitestone because of my position,\u201d she said giving Kaylie\u2019s hands a soft squeeze. \u00a0\u201cAfter that day where Vecna fell and we died and came back, the world was celebrating or mourning and I felt so alone. \u00a0You made a stupid joke that you didn\u2019t mean and I took it too seriously. \u00a0I\u2019ve always had nightmares, ever since Whitestone fell, and after we comforted each other that night and fell asleep in each other\u2019s arms I knew they would come stronger than ever. \u00a0Yet when they came your voice pierced through them and chased them away. \u00a0For the first time in six years since I lost my family, I slept soundly despite what we had gone through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened, but I knew then and there that I wanted to be near you, I wanted to hear you sing, I wanted to know everything about this strange beautiful woman that I had died with, came back beside, and brought my damaged heart to life in ways I never thought possible. \u00a0I almost ruined us, my pride and my fear almost damned up, but I didn\u2019t realize who I was falling in love with. \u00a0You serenaded me every night standing beneath my balcony despite me giving you a room in the palace, when I tried to chase you away by telling you the things I\u2019ve done, and you kissed away my tears and scars. \u00a0I\u2019ve never met someone who was so gentle and understanding Kaylie, despite how much you\u2019re down on yourself you lifted me up. \u00a0You\u2019re the most amazing and caring woman I\u2019ve ever met Kaylie, I don\u2019t know why you seem so down on yourself my love, but I promise I\u2019m going to spend every day of our lives making you realize how wonderful you are,\u201d she said kissing Kaylie\u2019s knuckles while her gnomish bride was struggling not to cry.</p><p>\u201cDammit Cas,\u201d Kaylie said wiping her eyes on her shoulder of her dress, \u201cI should have gone first, now I\u2019m not going to be able to get through this without crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay darling,\u201d Cassandra said with patented De Rolo mixture of sincerity and teasing, \u201cyou\u2019re beautiful when you cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to let you win here,\u201d Kaylie said, recovering herself. \u00a0\u201cCas, I love you,\u201d she said starting to get that bardic tongue of hers to work, \u201cI don\u2019t really know what a girl like you sees in a girl like me, but I\u2019m glad that for once in your life you were stupid and gave me a chance. \u00a0That night in Vasselheim so long ago, we were brought back to life and I made a stupid joke when we learned that fucking lich was locked away forever. \u00a0It\u2019s kind of what my family does when we\u2019re about to break, we make sexual jokes that aren\u2019t funny. \u00a0But somehow that night you came to my room and struck me dumb. \u00a0I mean who wouldn\u2019t, the most beautiful classy woman you\u2019ve ever seen knocks on you door holding a bottle of wine that cost more than I\u2019d ever make in my life, how could I say no when I desperately needed someone to just make me feel alive. \u00a0So after a night, after admittedly really great sex,\u201d there were some groans from her dad and Percy and some in the crowd, but there were a lot of laughs. \u00a0Cass smiled and that was all that mattered, \u201cI kind of expected you to be gone. \u00a0I was used to being left, I was used to being treated like I was nothing, I was a flutist in a band of misfits and you were a noble lady who lived in a castle, what more could you want for me than a night, or a few admittedly fantastic hours. \u00a0But you stayed, you stayed in my arms and I never felt so scared that I\u2019d wake up somewhere awful because it was too good to be true. \u00a0Hell up to maybe five minutes ago, part of me felt everything was just some ridiculous, overly complicated prank because I\u2019m so messed up. \u00a0But then I saw, in that dress walking down the aisle and all those thoughts went away because even if I had powerful enough enemies willing to fuck me over this badly, I know you wouldn\u2019t do that to me. \u00a0Cass, I\u2019m a gnome,

but I know that I want to be your wife wherever we go.\u201d</p><p>Now Cassandra\u2019s eyes were watering waiting to kiss her bride to be, Pike, cleared her throat gently to remind them they were at a wedding ceremony. \u00a0\u201cBy the blessing of Sarenrae,\u201d Pike said and her wings of white light burst from her back. \u201cBy the Light of Pelor,\u201d Pike nodded to Vex who glowed with a bright white light slightly, \u201cby the wit of Iounn,\u201d she nodded to Scanlan whose eyes glowed purple and a third eye appeared on his forehead. \u00a0\u00a0\u201cBy their words of dedication and love to each other there can be no further proof of their love., by the exchanging of the rings, \u201d Pike said nodded to each of them. \u00a0Cassandra first,\u201cRepeat after me, \u2018with this ring, I take you as my wife for the rest of our days.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith this ring I take you as my wife,\u201d Cassandra said placing a band of gold on Kaylie\u2019s finger and giving her gnomish bride a loving smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd now you Kaylie,\u201d Pike turned to her fellow gnome, \u201crepeat after me, \u2018with this ring I take you as my wife for the rest of our days.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith this ring, I take you as my wife for the rest of our days,\u201d Kaylie managed to say without looking away from her wife\u2019s eyes. \u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBy the power vested in me by Whitestone and the Church of Sarenrae, I now pronounce you wife and wife. You may now kiss the bride,\u201d Pike said in a loud proud voice, and Kaylie took the opportunity to dip her wife into the kiss of her life while their friends and family applauded. \u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When they finally broke the kiss, Kaylie and Cassandra just smiled and stared at each other mid dip. \u201cHey,\u201d Kaylie said softly smiling at her wife.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHey, yourself,\u201d Cassandra said giggling. Eventually she was pulled up and they faced their friends and family, leaving down the aisle hand in hand, ready to face what the world sent \u00a0their way together.</p><p>I don\u2019t really know why I love these two together as much as I do, I just really like the idea of them finding each other after Vox Machina killed them by accident. \u00a0I also like how they were both missing family members of the main characters that had a hard past and I could see them getting together. \u00a0Also I forgot about Keeper Yennen and Archi until the story was mostly written, they might have either performed the ceremony or gave Cassandra away, but I think Percy and Pike were kind of the right choice. \u00a0I hope you enjoyed reading this.</p>",

A few years ago, I was the bastard daughter of a quilter in Kymal who made her living playing flute in a band of rogues and thieves. \u00a0My only goal in life was to track you down and kill you. \u00a0Now I\u2019m here, getting married to a high lady and real noblewoman, I can\u2019t say I understand what she sees in me-,\u201d Kaylie stated to say, but Scanlan cut her off.</p><p>\u201cShe sees someone special and amazing, Kaylie, she sees someone she loves and wants to spend the rest of her life with,\u201d Scanlan assured his daughter. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard to believe how loved you are, I\u2019ve had that problem to, sometimes it\u2019s easier to just run than stay and figure that out,\u201d he said ashamed. \u00a0\u201cBut trust me it\u2019s always worth it to stay, if you\u2019re going to take anything away from me and our time together take that piece of knowledge. \u00a0I didn\u2019t learn it until a few years ago, maybe my life would have been better if I learned it earlier. \u00a0Maybe I would have been a man worthy of being your father earlier. \u00a0But, not more of that nonsense,\u201d Scanlan said offering his little girl hsi arm, \u201cshall we?\u201d </p><p>Smiling, Kaylie took his arm, \u201ccome on old man, let\u2019s go meet my woman.\u201d \u00a0With that the two gnomes walked arm and arm down the halls of Whitestone Castle until they reached the great hall. Kynan and his riflemen lined the hall like honor guards and opened the door with a smile. \u00a0They waited five beats until the music started and started their walk down the aisle. \u00a0Dr. Dranzel\u2019s violin softly sung through the air as it was played deftly by the half-orcs massive hands. \u00a0The good doctor was doing his best to hold back tears of pride as he watched his two proteges walk to the altar. \u00a0Esilmere and Kent playing the wedding march along with their boss keeping him in line. \u00a0Zedd sat with Samson in the front row of her guests, just so Kaylie could keep an eye on them. \u00a0</p><p>When she approached the troupe a few months ago to ask them to play at her wedding she made them promise none of their normal trickery shit. \u00a0No panhandling or pickpocketing, no swiping the silverware and plates, just a simple easy gig and they\u2019d be paid more gold then they\u2019d ever get pickpocketing and she wouldn\u2019t remind her soon to be sister in law of what happened in Greyskull. \u00a0She could do things like this as the court bard of Whitestone.</p><p>JB Trickfoot and Grog stood on her side as her bridesmaids while Keyleth and Vex stood opposite of them, they were all smiling at her, Grog was crying, and Kaylie did her best to smile back. \u00a0\u00a0Pike stood at the altar ready to marry her and her bride to be, looking proud and angelic as always. \u00a0It was the longest walk of Kaylie\u2019s life, she didn\u2019t want to bolt but her feet sure did, every instinct screamed to run, despite what she wanted, but she managed to get to the end of the aisle somehow. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m very proud of you,\u201d Scanlan said kissing his daughter on the cheek before taking his place.</p><p>And then Kaylie felt alone up there, even though she had the most powerful people in all of Exandria in her corner. \u00a0But fear wasn\u2019t logical, even surrounded by friends and family, she was terrified and her heart felt like it was exploding. \u00a0It seemed like an eternity until Dr. Dranzel started up the wedding march again, and then she saw her, Cassandra De Rolo the Lady of Whitestone and the love of Kaylie\u2019s life walking side by side with her brother. \u00a0Suddenly, all the nerves were gone and the only thing that mattered was Cassandra. \u00a0She looked beautiful, a traditional long white gown that hugged her frame in a respectable manner, her long white and brown hair tied back in braids. \u00a0Everything just seemed okay for the young Shorthalt now that she was here.</p><p>It felt like it took forever for them to reach the altar, but at the same time it felt like they were there in an instant. \u00a0Percival kissed his sister\u2019s cheek and muttered a, \u201cyou look beautiful Cass,\u201d before giving a nod to Kaylie and taking his place. He didn\u2019t need to give Kaylie a warning, he given her one already when the engagement was first announced, nothing rude or overtly threatening just a warning from a man who had lost everything and was slowly getting back what he had lost and do anything to make sure no one took it away from him again. \u00a0</p><p>Cassandra ascended the dias where Kaylie and brought their hands together, \u201cYou look beautiful Kaylie,\u201d Cassandra said sweetly, she felt no need to pretend to be a stuffy aristocrat, not now, not with her love on their day. \u00a0Kaylie didn\u2019t even hear much of what Pike was saying, Cassandra de Rolo was the only thing that mattered until Pike said, \u201cthe brides have written their own vows, and wish to share them with us. \u00a0Cassandra if you will,\u201d she nodded to the de Rolo so she could start.</p><p>\u201cKay,\u201d Cassandra started, \u201cI\u2019ve been used my whole life, the Briars kept me as a pet, a trophy, and a tool, Vecna used me as a pawn to hurt the people who love me,\u201d she paused, taking her eyes off of Kaylie for just a moment to look at her brother and her sisters before turning back to gaze into Kaylie\u2019s beautiful brown eyes. \u00a0\u201cEven after I became the Lady of Whitestone far too many noblemen and far too few noblewomen sought my hand to gain a foothold in Whitestone because of my position,\u201d she said giving Kaylie\u2019s hands a soft squeeze. \u00a0\u201cAfter that day where Vecna fell and we died and came back, the world was celebrating or mourning and I felt so alone. \u00a0You made a stupid joke that you didn\u2019t mean and I took it too seriously. \u00a0I\u2019ve always had nightmares, ever since Whitestone fell, and after we comforted each other that night and fell asleep in each other\u2019s arms I knew they would come stronger than ever. \u00a0Yet when they came your voice pierced through them and chased them away. \u00a0For the first time in six years since I lost my family, I slept soundly despite what we had gone through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened, but I knew then and there that I wanted to be near you, I wanted to hear you sing, I wanted to know everything about this strange beautiful woman that I had died with, came back beside, and brought my damaged heart to life in ways I never thought possible. \u00a0I almost ruined us, my pride and my fear almost damned up, but I didn\u2019t realize who I was falling in love with. \u00a0You serenaded me every night standing beneath my balcony despite me giving you a room in the palace, when I tried to chase you away by telling you the things I\u2019ve done, and you kissed away my tears and scars. \u00a0I\u2019ve never met someone who was so gentle and understanding Kaylie, despite how much you\u2019re down on yourself you lifted me up. \u00a0You\u2019re the most amazing and caring woman I\u2019ve ever met Kaylie, I don\u2019t know why you seem so down on yourself my love, but I promise I\u2019m going to spend every day of our lives making you realize how wonderful you are,\u201d she said kissing Kaylie\u2019s knuckles while her gnomish bride was struggling not to cry.</p><p>\u201cDammit Cas,\u201d Kaylie said wiping her eyes on her shoulder of her dress, \u201cI should have gone first, now I\u2019m not going to be able to get through this without crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay darling,\u201d Cassandra said with patented De Rolo mixture of sincerity and teasing, \u201cyou\u2019re beautiful when you cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to let you win here,\u201d Kaylie said, recovering herself. \u00a0\u201cCas, I love you,\u201d she said starting to get that bardic tongue of hers to work, \u201cI don\u2019t really know what a girl like you sees in a girl like me, but I\u2019m glad that for once in your life you were stupid and gave me a chance. \u00a0That night in Vasselheim so long ago, we were brought back to life and I made a stupid joke when we learned that fucking lich was locked away forever. \u00a0It\u2019s kind of what my family does when we\u2019re about to break, we make sexual jokes that aren\u2019t funny. \u00a0But somehow that night you came to my room and struck me dumb. \u00a0I mean who wouldn\u2019t, the most beautiful classy woman you\u2019ve ever seen knocks on you door holding a bottle of wine that cost more than I\u2019d ever make in my life, how could I say no when I desperately needed someone to just make me feel alive. \u00a0So after a night, after admittedly really great sex,\u201d there were some groans from her dad and Percy and some in the crowd, but there were a lot of laughs. \u00a0Cass smiled and that was all that mattered, \u201cI kind of expected you to be gone. \u00a0I was used to being left, I was used to being treated like I was nothing, I was a flutist in a band of misfits and you were a noble lady who lived in a castle, what more could you want for me than a night, or a few admittedly fantastic hours. \u00a0But you stayed, you stayed in my arms and I never felt so scared that I\u2019d wake up somewhere awful because it was too good to be true. \u00a0Hell up to maybe five minutes ago, part of me felt everything was just some ridiculous, overly complicated prank because I\u2019m so messed up. \u00a0But then I saw, in that dress walking down the aisle and all those thoughts went away because even if I had powerful enough enemies willing to fuck me over this badly, I know you wouldn\u2019t do that to me. \u00a0Cass, I\u2019m a gnome, I\u2019ve always been short and I always will be, but the way you look at me makes me feel like I\u2019m the tallest person in the room. \u00a0I don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going to go from here, but I know that I want to be your wife wherever we go.\u201d</p><p>Now Cassandra\u2019s eyes were watering waiting to kiss her bride to be, Pike, cleared her throat gently to remind them they were at a wedding ceremony. \u00a0\u201cBy the blessing of Sarenrae,\u201d Pike said and her wings of white light burst from her back. \u201cBy the Light of Pelor,\u201d Pike nodded to Vex who glowed with a bright white light slightly, \u201cby the wit of Iounn,\u201d she nodded to Scanlan whose eyes glowed purple and a third eye appeared on his forehead. \u00a0\u00a0\u201cBy their words of dedication and love to each other there can be no further proof of their love., by the exchanging of the rings, \u201d Pike said nodded to each of them. \u00a0Cassandra first,\u201cRepeat after me, \u2018with

her gnomish bride a loving smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd now you Kaylie,\u201d Pike turned to her fellow gnome, \u201crepeat after me, \u2018with this ring I take you as my wife for the rest of our days.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith this ring, I take you as my wife for the rest of our days,\u201d Kaylie managed to say without looking away from her wife\u2019s eyes. \u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBy the power vested in me by Whitestone and the Church of Sarenrae, I now pronounce you wife and wife.

He had helped save the world, had showed her how good of a man and a father he could be, and they both learned that love and forgiveness went a lot farther than the songs and stories made it out to be. \u00a0It had put her on a better path, it had led her to the woman who she loved and loved her, even if Scanlan didn\u2019t know it, for that alone she\u2019d forgive him for pretty much anything. \u201cThanks dad,\u201d Kaylie said turning around and giving her father a hug, growing up she had never known what it was like to have a father\u2019s love, turns out it\u2019s pretty alright. \u00a0\u201cI mean it, hearing you say that means more than you know.\u201d \u00a0Before they could break the embrace she heard \u00a0sniffing sound, \u201care you crying old man,\u201d she teased because her eyes definitely were not watering up.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Scanlan said easily, he had learned long ago that lying to the people you cared about led to nothing good and neither did keeping things from them. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m just so happy for you, I know we didn\u2019t meet under the best of circumstances Kaylie,\u201d both of them tried very hard to forget what led to him finding out who she was, \u201cbut the fact that I\u2019ve had you in my life has made me a better man. \u00a0I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m a good man yet, but I\u2019ll never stop trying to be the father you deserve, I promise.\u201d \u00a0Since the battle with Raishan he had never broken a promise to her, and he wasn\u2019t going to start now.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting their old man,\u201d Kaylie said her voice dripping with affection. \u00a0\u201cI still can\u2019t believe I\u2019m here though. A few years ago, I was the bastard daughter of a quilter in Kymal who made her living playing flute in a band of rogues and thieves. \u00a0My only goal in life was to track you down and kill you. \u00a0Now I\u2019m here, getting married to a high lady and real noblewoman, I can\u2019t say I understand what she sees in me-,\u201d Kaylie stated to say, but Scanlan cut her off.</p><p>\u201cShe sees someone special and amazing, Kaylie, she sees someone she loves and wants to spend the rest of her life with,\u201d Scanlan assured his daughter. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard to believe how loved you are, I\u2019ve had that problem to, sometimes it\u2019s easier to just run than stay and figure that out,\u201d he said ashamed. \u00a0\u201cBut trust me it\u2019s always worth it to stay, if you\u2019re going to take anything away from me and our time together take that piece of knowledge. \u00a0I didn\u2019t learn it until a few years ago, maybe my life would have been better if I learned it earlier. \u00a0Maybe I would have been a man worthy of being your father earlier. \u00a0But, not more of that nonsense,\u201d Scanlan said offering his little girl hsi arm, \u201cshall we?\u201d </p><p>Smiling, Kaylie took his arm, \u201ccome on old man, let\u2019s go meet my woman.\u201d \u00a0With that the two gnomes walked arm and arm down the halls of Whitestone Castle until they reached the great hall. Kynan and his riflemen lined the hall like honor guards and opened the door with a smile. \u00a0They waited five beats until the music started and started their walk down the aisle. \u00a0Dr. Dranzel\u2019s violin softly sung through the air as it was played deftly by the half-orcs massive hands. \u00a0The good doctor was doing his best to hold back tears of pride as he watched his two proteges walk to the altar. \u00a0Esilmere and Kent playing the wedding march along with their boss keeping him in line. \u00a0Zedd sat with Samson in the front row of her guests, just so Kaylie could keep an eye on them. \u00a0</p><p>When she approached the troupe a few months ago to ask them to play at her wedding she made them promise none of their normal trickery shit. \u00a0No panhandling or pickpocketing, no swiping the silverware and plates, just a simple easy gig and they\u2019d be paid more gold then they\u2019d ever get pickpocketing and she wouldn\u2019t remind her soon to be sister in law of what happened in Greyskull. \u00a0She could do things like this as the court bard of Whitestone.</p><p>JB Trickfoot and Grog stood on her side as her bridesmaids while Keyleth and Vex stood opposite of them, they were all smiling at her, Grog was crying, and Kaylie did her best to smile back. \u00a0\u00a0Pike stood at the altar ready to marry her and her bride to be, looking proud and angelic as always. \u00a0It was the longest walk of Kaylie\u2019s life, she didn\u2019t want to bolt but her feet sure did, every instinct screamed to run, despite what she wanted, but she managed to get to the end of the aisle somehow. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m very proud of you,\u201d Scanlan said kissing his daughter on the cheek before taking his place.</p><p>And then Kaylie felt alone up there, even though she had the most powerful people in all of Exandria in her corner. \u00a0But fear wasn\u2019t logical, even surrounded by friends and family, she was terrified and her heart felt like it was exploding. \u00a0It seemed like an eternity until Dr. Dranzel started up the wedding march again, and then she saw her, Cassandra De Rolo the Lady of Whitestone and the love of Kaylie\u2019s life walking side by side with her brother. \u00a0Suddenly, all the nerves were gone and the only thing that mattered was Cassandra. \u00a0She looked beautiful, a traditional long white gown that hugged her frame in a respectable manner, her long white and brown hair tied back in braids. \u00a0Everything just seemed okay for the young Shorthalt now that she was here.</p><p>It felt like it took forever for them to reach the altar, but at the same time it felt like they were there in an instant. \u00a0Percival kissed his sister\u2019s cheek and muttered a, \u201cyou look beautiful Cass,\u201d before giving a nod to Kaylie and taking his place. He didn\u2019t need to give Kaylie a warning, he given her one already when the engagement was first announced, nothing rude or overtly threatening just a warning from a man who had lost everything and was slowly getting back what he had lost and do anything to make sure no one took it away from him again. \u00a0</p><p>Cassandra ascended the dias where Kaylie and brought their hands together, \u201cYou look beautiful Kaylie,\u201d Cassandra said sweetly, she felt no need to pretend to be a stuffy aristocrat, not now, not with her love on their day. \u00a0Kaylie didn\u2019t even hear much of what Pike was saying, Cassandra de Rolo was the only thing that mattered until Pike said, \u201cthe brides have written their own vows, and wish to share them with us. \u00a0Cassandra if you will,\u201d she nodded to the de Rolo so she could start.</p><p>\u201cKay,\u201d Cassandra started, \u201cI\u2019ve been used my whole life, the Briars kept me as a pet, a trophy, and a tool, Vecna used me as a pawn to hurt the people who love me,\u201d she paused, taking her eyes off of Kaylie for just a moment to look at her brother and her sisters before turning back to gaze into Kaylie\u2019s beautiful brown eyes. \u00a0\u201cEven after I became the Lady of Whitestone far too many noblemen and far too few noblewomen sought my hand to gain a foothold in Whitestone because of my position,\u201d she said giving Kaylie\u2019s hands a soft squeeze. \u00a0\u201cAfter that day where Vecna fell and we died and came back, the world was celebrating or mourning and I felt so alone. \u00a0You made a stupid joke that you didn\u2019t mean and I took it too seriously. \u00a0I\u2019ve always had nightmares, ever since Whitestone fell, and after we comforted each other that night and fell asleep in each other\u2019s arms I knew they would come stronger than ever. \u00a0Yet when they came your voice pierced through them and chased them away. \u00a0For the first time in six years since I lost my family, I slept soundly despite what we had gone through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened, but I knew then and there that I wanted to be near you, I wanted to hear you sing, I wanted to know everything about this strange beautiful woman that I had died with, came back beside, and brought my damaged heart to life in ways I never thought possible. \u00a0I almost ruined us, my pride and my fear almost damned up, but I didn\u2019t realize who I was falling in love with. \u00a0You serenaded me every night standing beneath my balcony despite me giving you a room in the palace, when I tried to chase you away by telling you the things I\u2019ve done, and you kissed away my tears and scars. \u00a0I\u2019ve never met someone who was so gentle and understanding Kaylie, despite how much you\u2019re down on yourself you lifted me up. \u00a0You\u2019re the most amazing and caring woman I\u2019ve ever met Kaylie, I don\u2019t know why you seem so down on yourself my love, but I promise I\u2019m going to spend every day of our lives making you realize how wonderful you are,\u201d she said kissing Kaylie\u2019s knuckles while her gnomish bride was struggling not to cry.</p><p>\u201cDammit Cas,\u201d Kaylie said wiping her eyes on her shoulder of her dress, \u201cI should have gone first, now I\u2019m not going to be able to get through this without crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay darling,\u201d Cassandra said with patented De Rolo mixture of sincerity and teasing, \u201cyou\u2019re beautiful when you cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to let you win here,\u201d Kaylie said, recovering herself. \u00a0\u201cCas, I love you,\u201d she said starting to get that bardic tongue of hers to work, \u201cI don\u2019t really know what a girl like you sees in a girl like me, but I\u2019m glad that for once in your life you were stupid and gave me a chance. \u00a0That night in Vasselheim so long ago, we were brought back to life and I made a stupid joke when we learned that fucking lich was locked away forever. \u00a0It\u2019s kind of what my family does when we\u2019re about to break, we make sexual jokes that aren\u2019t funny. \u00a0But somehow that night you came to my room and struck me dumb. \u00a0I mean who wouldn\u2019t, the most beautiful classy woman you\u2019ve ever seen knocks on you door holding a bottle of wine that cost more than I\u2019d ever make in my life, how could I say no when I desperately needed someone to just make me feel alive. \u00a0So after a night, after admittedly really great sex,\u201d there were some groans from her dad and Percy and some in the crowd, but there were a lot of laughs. \u00a0Cass smiled and that was all that mattered, \u201cI kind of expected you to be gone. \u00a0I was used to being left, I was used to being treated like I was nothing, I was a flutist in a band of misfits and you were a noble lady who lived in a castle, what more could you want for me than a night, or a few admittedly fantastic hours. \u00a0But you stayed, you stayed in my arms and I never felt so scared that I\u2019d wake up somewhere awful because it was too good to be true. \u00a0Hell up to maybe five minutes ago, part of me felt everything was just some ridiculous, overly complicated prank because I\u2019m so messed up. \u00a0But then I saw, in that dress walking down the aisle and all those thoughts went away because even if I had powerful enough enemies willing to fuck me over this badly, I know you wouldn\u2019t do that to me. \u00a0Cass, I\u2019m a gnome, I\u2019ve always been short and I always will be, but the way you look at me makes me feel like I\u2019m the tallest person in the room. \u00a0I don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going to go from here, but I know that I want to be your wife wherever we go.\u201d</p><p>Now Cassandra\u2019s eyes were watering waiting to kiss her bride to be, Pike, cleared her throat gently to remind them they were at a wedding ceremony. \u00a0\u201cBy the blessing of Sarenrae,\u201d Pike said and her wings of white light burst from her back. \u201cBy the Light of Pelor,\u201d Pike nodded to Vex who glowed with a bright white light slightly, \u201cby the wit of Iounn,\u201d she nodded to Scanlan whose eyes glowed purple and a third eye appeared on his forehead. \u00a0\u00a0\u201cBy their words of dedication and love to each other there can be no further proof of their love., by the exchanging of the rings, \u201d Pike said nodded to each of them. \u00a0Cassandra first,\u201cRepeat after me, \u2018with this ring, I take you as my wife for the rest of our days.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith this ring I take you as my wife,\u201d Cassandra said placing a band of gold on Kaylie\u2019s finger and giving her gnomish bride a loving smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd now you Kaylie,\u201d Pike turned to her fellow gnome, \u201crepeat after me, \u2018with this ring I take you as my wife for the rest of our days.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith this ring, I take you as my wife for the rest of our days,\u201d Kaylie managed to say without looking away from her wife\u2019s eyes. \u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBy the power vested in me by Whitestone and the Church of Sarenrae, I now pronounce you wife and wife. You may now kiss the bride,\u201d Pike said in a loud proud voice, and Kaylie took the opportunity to dip her wife into the kiss of her life while their friends and family applauded. \u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When they finally broke the kiss, Kaylie and Cassandra just smiled and stared at each other mid dip. \u201cHey,\u201d Kaylie said softly smiling at her wife.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHey, yourself,\u201d Cassandra said giggling. Eventually she was pulled up and they faced their friends and family, leaving down the aisle hand in hand, ready to face what the world sent \u00a0their way together.</p><p>I don\u2019t really know why I love these two together as much as I do, I just really like the idea of them finding each other after Vox Machina killed them by accident. \u00a0I also like how they were both missing family members of the main characters that had a hard past and I could see them getting together. \u00a0Also I forgot about Keeper Yennen and Archi until the story was mostly written, they might have either performed the ceremony or gave Cassandra away, but I think Percy and Pike were kind of the right choice. \u00a0I hope you enjoyed reading this.</p>",

there were some groans from her dad and Percy and some in the crowd, but there were a lot of laughs. &nbsp;Cass smiled and that was all that mattered, &ldquo;I kind of expected you to be gone. &nbsp;I was used to being left, I was used to being treated like I was nothing, I was a flutist in a band of misfits and you were a noble lady who lived in a castle, what more could you want for me than a night, or a few admittedly fantastic hours. &nbsp;But you stayed, you stayed in my arms and I never felt so scared that I&rsquo;d wake up somewhere awful because it was too good to be true. &nbsp;Hell up to maybe five minutes ago, part of me felt everything was just some ridiculous, overly complicated prank because I&rsquo;m so messed up. &nbsp;But then I saw, in that dress walking down the aisle and all those thoughts went away because even if I had powerful enough enemies willing to fuck me over this badly, I know you wouldn&rsquo;t do that to me. &nbsp;Cass, I&rsquo;m a gnome, I&rsquo;ve always been short and I always will be, but the way you look at me makes me feel like I&rsquo;m the tallest person in the room. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know where we&rsquo;re going to go from here, but I know that I want to be your wife wherever we go.&rdquo;</p><p>Now Cassandra&rsquo;s eyes were watering waiting to kiss her bride to be, Pike, cleared her throat gently to remind them they were at a wedding ceremony. &nbsp;&ldquo;By the blessing of Sarenrae,&rdquo; Pike said and her wings of white light burst from her back. &ldquo;By the Light of Pelor,&rdquo; Pike nodded to Vex who glowed with a bright white light slightly, &ldquo;by the wit of Iounn,&rdquo; she nodded to Scanlan whose eyes glowed purple and a third eye appeared on his forehead. &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;By their words of dedication and love to each other there can be no further proof of their love., by the exchanging of the rings, &rdquo; Pike said nodded to each of them. &nbsp;Cassandra first,&ldquo;Repeat after me, &lsquo;with this ring, I take you as my wife for the rest of our days.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With this ring I take you as my wife,&rdquo; Cassandra said placing a band of gold on Kaylie&rsquo;s finger and giving her gnomish bride a loving smile.</p><p>&ldquo;And now you Kaylie,&rdquo; Pike turned to her fellow gnome, &ldquo;repeat after me, &lsquo;with this ring I take you as my wife for the rest of our days.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With this ring, I take you as my wife for the rest of our days,&rdquo; Kaylie managed to say without looking away from her wife&rsquo;s eyes. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;By the power vested in me by Whitestone and the Church of Sarenrae, I now pronounce you wife and wife. You may now kiss the bride,&rdquo; Pike said in a loud proud voice, and Kaylie took the opportunity to dip her wife into the kiss of her life while their friends and family applauded. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they finally broke the kiss, Kaylie and Cassandra just smiled and stared at each other mid dip. &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Kaylie said softly smiling at her wife.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hey, yourself,&rdquo; Cassandra said giggling. Eventually she was pulled up and they faced their friends and family, leaving down the aisle hand in hand, ready to face what the world sent &nbsp;their way together.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t really know why I love these two together as much as I do, I just really like the idea of them finding each other after Vox Machina killed them by accident. &nbsp;I also like how they were both missing family members of the main characters that had a hard past and I could see them getting together. &nbsp;Also I forgot about Keeper Yennen and Archi until the story was mostly written, they might have either performed the ceremony or gave Cassandra away, but I think Percy and Pike were kind of the right choice. &nbsp;I hope you enjoyed reading this.</p>",

Four years ago the only thing she wanted to do was humiliate and kill him, but they were both better people now. He had helped save the world, had showed her how good of a man and a father he could be, and they both learned that love and forgiveness went a lot farther than the songs and stories made it out to be. &nbsp;It had put her on a better path, it had led her to the woman who she loved and loved her, even if Scanlan didn&rsquo;t know it, for that alone she&rsquo;d forgive him for pretty much anything. &ldquo;Thanks dad,&rdquo; Kaylie said turning around and giving her father a hug, growing up she had never known what it was like to have a father&rsquo;s love, turns out it&rsquo;s pretty alright. &nbsp;&ldquo;I mean it, hearing you say that means more than you know.&rdquo; &nbsp;Before they could break the embrace she heard &nbsp;sniffing sound, &ldquo;are you crying old man,&rdquo; she teased because her eyes definitely were not watering up.</p>\n</p>",
