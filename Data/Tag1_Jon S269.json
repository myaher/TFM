I just feel like Jon and Daenerys are meant for each other and they&rsquo;re at least compatible.  I understand why they want Sansa to be with Jon because he is one of the best male characters.  I want Sansa to have a good, healthy, loving relationship with someone as awesome as Jon but I just don&rsquo;t see it being Jon.  I haven&rsquo;t read the books but I don&rsquo;t see them happening on the show at all.  Season 7 showed us that even though they love each other (as siblings) they don&rsquo;t work well together and that wouldn&rsquo;t make for a very healthy relationship for obvious reasons.</p><p>I also don&rsquo;t see why everyone feels the need to love one awesome womxn and hate on another.  Daenerys is my number one, even though she wasn&rsquo;t in season 1 (I couldn&rsquo;t identify because of her &ldquo;love&rdquo; with Drogo because I was her age while watching and just couldn&rsquo;t understand loving your rapist for any reason), Arya was.  I came to love her during season 2 and Arya became my number 2.  Jon as King of the North made me dislike him in much of season 7 and Sansa took his place at my number 3 and he is now number 4.  I love them all for different reasons and I only have traits I dislike but I don&rsquo;t bash characters over it.  I&rsquo;m not anti Sansa at all, even though she was a brat for most of season 1.</p><p>I feel like the theory of Daenerys becoming the &ldquo;Mad Queen&rdquo; is BS too.  I mean, if she were gonna lose it she would have after being abused by her brother, living a terrible life in exile while constantly running from assassins, being raped by Drogo for so long AND having to deal with all the men and their misogyny.  I wouldn&rsquo;t even call Cersei a mad queen!  She&rsquo;s just fed up with everything and everyone but reacted badly to it.  She didn&rsquo;t have a great life either but that is no excuse for the things she&rsquo;s done!</p><p>I feel that Jonerys is endgame based on everything I&rsquo;ve read online and seen in the show.  I&rsquo;ve read Jonsa theories but I don&rsquo;t see what they do, I guess.  Everything seems related to sibling love rather than romantic love.</p><p>I also don&rsquo;t see why people are grossed out by Jon and Daenerys being realted.  They&rsquo;re in a time and world where 1st cousins marry and reproduce to protect family names due to patriarchal bloodlines (which would have never been a problem if womxn were allowed to keep their names.  Plus, it just makes more sense to trace children through mothers!  You don&rsquo;t need proof to know it&rsquo;s her baby, after all!) so Jon and Daenerys being together shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem.  I&rsquo;m not even grossed out by Cersei and Jaime since they&rsquo;re both consenting!  Even their parents were cousins.</p><p>Another thing is Jon&rsquo;s claim to the throne.  His isn&rsquo;t actually stronger than that of Daenerys.  When Rhaegar was killed, the Mad King named Viserys his heir which means that the line of succession skips over any of Rhaegar&rsquo;s children.  Viserys named Daenerys his heir and he was killed (and rightfully so, even though I felt it was too slow) and Daenerys is still alive so her claim is the strongest.  If she died THEN Jon&rsquo;s would be the strongest and only rightful claim.  But, like I said, Daenerys is still alive.</p><p>Anyways, I hope Jon and Daenerys get married and have a baby (I hope they have a daughter and rid of that patriarchal line of succession). I would rather Jon just be an adviser or whatever rather than being king.  I just want my girl to rule without a man, because she just does her best that way! And I want to see Ghost and Daenerys create a sweet bond!</p><p>And, for a kind of random last thought, I want to try all of the Game of Thrones themed beer.  But, I live in America where there are so many different ages of adulthood!  &ldquo;Legal&rdquo; adult at 18, can&rsquo;t buy tobacco till 19 (in my state at least) and can&rsquo;t buy liquor until 21.  I can&rsquo;t even sign a contract until I&rsquo;m 19 in my state due to the age of majority thing this crazy country has going on!  I&rsquo;m nearly 18 so I&rsquo;m getting somewhere but, that doesn&rsquo;t stop me from fantasizing about moving to London!</p><p>Well, anyways, I&rsquo;ll wrap up my rant now.  Goodnight/day to everyone!</p>",

I love them all for different reasons and I only have traits I dislike but I don\u2019t bash characters over it.  I\u2019m not anti Sansa at all, even though she was a brat for most of season 1.</p><p>I feel like the theory of Daenerys becoming the \u201cMad Queen\u201d is BS too.  I mean, if she were gonna lose it she would have after being abused by her brother, living a terrible life in exile while constantly running from assassins, being raped by Drogo for so long AND having to deal with all the men and their misogyny.  I wouldn\u2019t even call Cersei a mad queen!  She\u2019s just fed up with everything and everyone but reacted badly to it.  She didn\u2019t have a great life either but that is no excuse for the things she\u2019s done!</p><p>I feel that Jonerys is endgame based on everything I\u2019ve read online and seen in the show.  I\u2019ve read Jonsa theories but I don\u2019t see what they do, I guess.  Everything seems related to sibling love rather than romantic love.</p><p>I also don\u2019t see why people are grossed out by Jon and Daenerys being realted.  They\u2019re in a time and world where 1st cousins marry and reproduce to protect family names due to patriarchal bloodlines (which would have never been a problem if womxn were allowed to keep their names.  Plus, it just makes more sense to trace children through mothers!  You don\u2019t need proof to know it\u2019s her baby, after all!) so Jon and Daenerys being together shouldn\u2019t be a problem.  I\u2019m not even grossed out by Cersei and Jaime since they\u2019re both consenting!  Even their parents were cousins.</p><p>Another thing is Jon\u2019s claim to the throne.  His isn\u2019t actually stronger than that of Daenerys.  When Rhaegar was killed, the Mad King named Viserys his heir which means that the line of succession skips over any of Rhaegar\u2019s children.  Viserys named Daenerys his heir and he was killed (and rightfully so, even though I felt it was too slow) and Daenerys is still alive so her claim is the strongest.  If she died THEN Jon\u2019s would be the strongest and only rightful claim.  But, like I said, Daenerys is still alive.</p><p>Anyways, I hope Jon and Daenerys get married and have a baby (I hope they have a daughter and rid of that patriarchal line of succession). I would rather Jon just be an adviser or whatever rather than being king.  I just want my girl to rule without a man, because she just does her best that way! And I want to see Ghost and Daenerys create a sweet bond!</p><p>And, for a kind of random last thought, I want to try all of the Game of Thrones themed beer.  But, I live in America where there are so many different ages of adulthood!  \u201cLegal\u201d adult at 18, can\u2019t buy tobacco till 19 (in my state at least) and can\u2019t buy liquor until 21.  I can\u2019t even sign a contract until I\u2019m 19 in my state due to the age of majority thing this crazy country has going on!  I\u2019m nearly 18 so I\u2019m getting somewhere but, that doesn\u2019t stop me from fantasizing about moving to London!</p><p>Well, anyways, I\u2019ll wrap up my rant now.  Goodnight/day to everyone!</p>",
