Before long, Ella had a mountain of snowballs, and her grin was wider than ever. It would never cease to amaze Cyrus how much she looked like Jonah when she smiled. Although, according to Jonah, she was all Cyrus, especially in the eyes, which he said were \u201cbig brown puppy dog eyes\u201d that he never stood a chance against.</p><p>Either way, she was the best daughter anyone could ever ask for, and an even better partner in The Great Snowball War. The Snowball War was a tradition Cyrus and Jonah had had since high school. Every year, in the middle of February when they were going absolutely stir crazy with cabin fever, they\u2019d go out to the park, and go at it. Some years, their friends would join them, but in more recent years, Ella had joined them. And boy was she a force to be reckoned with. She finished her pile of snowballs in record time, and headed for Jonah, hitting him in rapid fire. Of course, Jonah engaged, stepping away from his tree to fight back against Sergeant Ella. While Jonah was distracted, Cyrus scooped up a pile of the fresh fallen powder into his arms. He tiptoed up behind Jonah, lifted his arms, and dumped the whole pile on his head. </p><p>Jonah jumped nearly a foot in the air. \u201cCyrus! The snow is going down my shirt!\u201d </p><p>Cyrus and Ella giggled and high-fived. \u201cWell done, Sergeant! Enemy defeated!\u201d </p><p>Jonah pouted and crossed his arms. \u201cI\u2019m freezing now, thanks to you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAw, honey,\u201d Cyrus put an arm around his husband. \u201cDo we need to go inside and get you some cocoa?\u201d </p><p>Jonah nodded. \u201cYes, please.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd I thought the seven year old was the baby.\u201d Cyrus rolled his eyes. </p><p>The trio made their way towards the entrance of the park, Cyrus and Jonah holding hands, and Ella running ahead of them. Jonah stopped for a moment, \u00a0and Cyrus was about to ask if something was wrong, when Jonah dropped his hand and shoved him into a nearby snow bank. </p><p>\u201cRevenge!\u201d Jonah shouted, pumping his fist in the air. </p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Cyrus struggled to pull himself out of the slush, to know avail. \u201cI can\u2019t get up. Help?\u201d He reached his hand out towards Jonah. </p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Jonah took Cyrus\u2019s hand. </p><p>\u201cOh, you beautiful, trusting idiot.\u201d Cyrus tightened his grip and yanked Jonah into the snow bank beside him. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you fell for that.\u201d </p><p>Ella giggled. \u201cYou look funny like that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe our seven year old daughter is the only one who survived this snowball fight unscathed,\u201d Jonah laughed. </p><p>\u201cWe had fun, though,\u201d Cyrus offered. </p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Jonah pulled himself out of the snow bank. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think we\u2019re done yet.\u201d He scooped up a handful of snow and pressed into a ball. He tossed it at Ella, hitting her torso. She immediately fell to the ground in dramatic fashion. </p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ve been hit! I\u2019ve been hit!\u201d She called out, her hands clutching her side where the snowball had landed. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jonah pulled Cyrus out of the snow bank. \u201cShe\u2019s definitely your daughter.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus huffed, and tossed some loose snow his husband\u2019s way. </p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Jonah whined, wiping the snow from his cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s just rude.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus shrugged and started forming more snowballs. Eventually, they would stumble back home, cold and wet, to have that hot cocoa. Jonah\u2019s mug would be brimming with mini marshmallows, and Ella would fall asleep on the couch. </p><p>But this war wasn\u2019t over yet. </p>",

I&rsquo;m hoping to start writing them when I go to bed tonight, as a way to stay up to watch Andi Mack! I will hopefully have at least half of them done by this weekend! </p><h1>To everyone else: </h1><p>I will be posting the epilogue of Touch-Starved tonight, and I will be posting another oneshot! Look out for that! </p><p>(Also I have some multi-chapter fics in the works, and those should be posted sooner than you think!)</p></p>",
