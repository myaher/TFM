Kate x</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m leaving you.\u201d</i></p><p>That\u2019s what you\u2019d said to him this morning on your way out of bed. After slow a, meditated, hot, sweaty, tantalising and all round perfect shag, you\u2019d slid from between his arms to sit up, reaching down for the t-shirt on the floor by your feet and pulling over your head. Yeah, his t-shirt.</p><p>He\u2019d frowned but had a slight feeling he knew what you were doing, but he didn\u2019t want it to be true regardless. \u201cYou\u2019re&hellip; leaving me?\u201d</p><p>You\u2019d glanced over your shoulder and nodded, offering nothing but a small \u201cmhmm\u201d before you stood and wandered towards the door.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He\u2019d pushed, a little arsey in his delivery as he sat up with a scowl, scratching the back of his head to further express his confusion.</p><p>You\u2019d stopped in the doorway, pouting for a brief moment before simply shrugging at him. \u201cDunno, just not really feelin\u2019 it today.\u201d Your words were lies, every single one of them categoric bullshit. Winding him up is one of your favourite past times, because when he\u2019s pissed off or upset, that\u2019s when you really get the most out of him, what you need out of him. The sex this morning had been nice&hellip; really fucking nice, it\u2019s just not what you wanted.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean today?!\u201d Harry had screamed after you when you disappeared, stressing repeatedly over your name. When you hadn\u2019t answered he\u2019d followed you, only to find you half dressed for work. \u201cY\u2019cant leave me because you\u2019re fucking <i>bored</i>, pet.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019d ignored him, appearing less bothered than ever before as you moved your way around him and his begging until you were really heading for the door. \u201cIt\u2019s just the way it is, Harry.\u201d You\u2019d shrugged again, resting a gentle hand on his arm as you gazed sympathetically at him, before leaving a single peck to his cheek and heading out the door to your car.</p><p>~</p><p>You sigh as you push your front door open, tossing your keys into the dish on the side and delicately stepping out of your work heels with a light kick to push them aside. You notice the light in the kitchen is on and smirk to yourself, tiptoeing your way towards it. You can hear little noises every few seconds, maybe a knife against a chopping board or a cupboard door being opened and closed.</p><p>You knew Harry wouldn\u2019t have taken your words as gospel earlier that morning, you knew he had more of his wits about him than to believe you\u2019d actually leave him. You just liked your life to be a bit more&hellip; exciting.</p><p>With a brief peek around the door you spot him fingering over a recipe book, concentrating perhaps a little too hard since he probably can\u2019t see.</p><p>\u201cTwo things,\u201d you announce your return and step fully into the room with a light crease between your brows, \u201cyou need to start wearing your glasses otherwise you\u2019ll go cross-eyed.\u201d</p><p>Harry looks up from his reading to scowl at you. \u201cNot really the time for jokes, is it?\u201d He grumbles, turning to full face you with his arms crossed over his chest.</p><p>You ignore his bitter tone and carry on. \u201cOther thing; what the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He silently reaches into his back pocket and smoothly tosses something across the room at you. You manage to catch it, even if the throw was a little wide, and find your spare set of house keys in your palm.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re <i>really</i> gonna break up with me,\u201d He begins, making his way towards you with a dark glint in his eye, \u201cy\u2019need to remember to ask for your keys back.\u201d</p><p>You can\u2019t help the dirty smirk breaking across your face as he reaches you, his hands gripping the side of your face as he forces his lips onto yours. He\u2019s eager and rough, slowly pushing your body backwards as he desperately coaxes your mouth open. Your tongues find one another, tasting and fighting with the other until Harry greedily takes your bottom lip between his teeth and pulling at it, biting harder and harder as he rolls it between his teeth. </p><p>You feel yourself pushed against a wall - you\u2019re not sure which wall because you\u2019re still blindly accepting his brutal attack on your lips - and your hands slip to the button and zip on his jeans. His lips temporarily move to you neck as you work on his jeans, teasing your skin with his teeth and suctioning on it until you\u2019re bruised from his work. </p><p>Once he\u2019s done he takes your waist and turns you so that your front is pressed against the wall. Your breath is suddenly coming heavier, a little groan escaping from you as he pushes you flush against it a little rougher that you\u2019d anticipated.</p><p>Harry takes a grip of your hair in one hand, pulling on it so that your head rolls backwards slightly and exposes your neck. He presses himself flat against you, delicately trailing kisses along your shoulder up to your neck. \u201cIs this what you wanted, baby girl?\u201d</p><p>His grip on your hair is restricting any movement of your head, something you know he\u2019s done so he can <i>hear</i> you. \u201cY-Yes.\u201d You nearly choke  on your words.</p><p>\u201cEh, come on now. You know how it works.\u201d His voice has grown impossibly deep, a hint of underlying threat to his tone that already has you quaking against the wall. \u201cYes <i>what</i>?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cYes, Daddy.\u201d</i></p><p>You know Harry\u2019s grin is wide as he buries his face into your neck, nipping along your shoulder with his teeth and leaving little red marks all along you. His movements are so smooth you barely notice him removing you of your work dress until he\u2019s pushing it over your shoulders, down your arms and crumpling at the floor.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t fancy wearing tights today, hm?\u201d He comments, since your now stood in just your knickers and your bra.</p><p>\u201cWas in a rush.\u201d You pant, your hot breath hitting the wall and brushing back against your face. </p><p>Harry yanks gently on your hair as a reminder, and it does little to help the heat between your thighs. </p><p>\u201cWas in a rush, <i>Daddy</i>.\u201d You emphasise the word in an attempt to get a further rise out of him.</p><p>\u201cNever have been good at following the rules have you, baby?\u201d He growls, biting at the bend of your jaw while he removes the remainder of your underwear and frees his length. \u201cHave you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really, Daddy, no.\u201d Your tone is pressed since his stiff cock is teasing against your cheeks and making you shake with need.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He grunts, holding your shoulder with one hand while the other lines up his cock to your entrance. \u201cAlways have been trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t bear the thought of not having me though, could you?\u201d You tease, because you know it\u2019s going to piss him off that bit more.</p><p>He knees your legs a little wider and slips into you with one quick motion, on hand still on your shoulder as the other grips your waist. \u201cYour mouth is gonna get you in trouble one day, pet.\u201d He warns as he begins fucking into you, adopting a much faster pace than you\u2019d experienced this morning.</p><p>Your hips are repeatedly clashing with the wall as he thrusts into you from behind, your hands fumbling for something to hold onto. His large length is stretching well into you, hitting you in places you\u2019re not so used to with his sloppy fucks. You brave the possible outcome and reach behind you into his hair, the other resting on the hand holding your waist.</p><p>As your fingers tangle and tug on his curls he finds it as motivation to pick up his pace, going in harder and faster than even before. It\u2019s got you whimpering helplessly, barely able to speak. He\u2019s stretching you so much it burns, and there\u2019s a numb pain in your hips from where they\u2019re clashing with the wall. Harry\u2019s mouth is still leaving bruises along your shoulder, and the last thing you\u2019re thinking about is how to cover them up for tomorrow.</p><p>The hand squeezing your waist glides down to your heat, his long middle finger reaching down to circle around your clit. It has you shaking, being overly sensitive in that area, and he has to push you firmly against the wall to keep you steady.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that, baby girl? Is it rough enough for you?\u201d His question is bitter, verging on irritated as he tugs on your ear with his teeth.</p><p>\u201cMhmm.\u201d You just about manage.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that, pet? Didn\u2019t quite hear you&hellip;\u201d he pants between nips of your jaw. He\u2019s struggling to keep his pace now, slowing down just a fraction as he anticipates your reply.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d You choke at him. \u201cFucking hell, Daddy, yes.\u201d</p><p>Your words have him picking it up again, even messier than before to the point he\u2019s working himself up to his orgasm. As he thrusts into you one last heavy and forceful time, he\u2019s got you both crying out through your euphoric highs.</p><p>~</p><p>After a quick clean up Harry had gone back to making dinner while you had a quick shower. For the first time in a while you\u2019re a little sheepish when you return, wearing only a t-shirt (again, his) and a pair of pants.</p><p>When you reappear you find him by the stove, and you wrap your arms around his waist, pressing a kiss against his bare back. \u201cM\u2019sorry.\u201d You mumble against his skin.</p><p>You feel him laugh, and he glances over his shoulder at you with a bemused smile. \u201cWhat are you actually sorry for?\u201d</p><p>You avoid his gaze briefly and then look back to him. \u201cBeing a brat.\u201d</p><p>Harry chuckles and turns in your hold to caress his hands over the sides of your face. \u201cNot gonna change though, is it?\u201d</p><p>You hesitate for a moment, looking anywhere but him before pressing your lips into a hard line and shaking your head. \u201cNo, probably not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Harry giggles, pressing a hard kiss to your forehead. \u201cGood job I like y\u2019then, innit?\u201d</p><p>~~~</p><p>Good morning to meeee \ud83d\ude02</p><p>Tag list: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRQvNGuL791trMASjjacTyQ\">@pxrrishly</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgPyqI5CkEId8g7xFggm2Hg\">@permanentllyharry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM5Wesov-xsjMV0DS3xoxeQ\">@ofpeppermintbay</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb5MZxMvKL3E9V-fzr16asg\">@talesofstyles</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUftrmoCR-gJ36qDkBozOAg\">@abundantlyabundant</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mC46KFufQzMQFQPY1dCvfcA\">@joan-of-disappointment</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m73AsCPI6pl5ydzYNqZA7ig\">@staceystoleyourheart</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYYD0_lJbE8J3m-qWYoZ2Ww\">@hoeforhaz</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlRbiKuRhgrY3E3H8bL5cIg\">@harry12styles94</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNcSwE3yuAMUrJFCByV9VEA\">@belikebebe</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw8YPeV1kp6lQtCreciPNCQ\">@harryismydaddy21</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGFOmVWpQgDRviVbQYGjJ8w\">@meet-me-in-the-harry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5sffYoPzjk56Rs6ZvKn9FQ\">@joycelovedorial</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp_6aoPyziVdi6ZXi6B8LjQ\">@evaolin</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmcxuUK9ZWplnHQCdhUVD1A\">@harrystyles-concepts</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfxkucLlCoWB5Gmly8d8H6Q\">@harryisalittleshit</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6jWlNWmGyQNYnEd6-SS92A\">@newtosaur250</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/myJAa8KxYrK4vh_yQTZ_60g\">@sydneys-life-blog</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZRip2ZNdgboKd6U6cXPvGA\">@flowerrrrrchilddd</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgrGBah2yj4TnFyzYRijzTQ\">@belle-ofthe-sea</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbryUSDk8hHw5rIDbYFA7aQ\">@grace-leigh</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD79q662XJ4yMKN7-cXEIJQ\">@winchesterwife27</a> </p>",

Yeah, his t-shirt.</p><p>He\u2019d frowned but had a slight feeling he knew what you were doing, but he didn\u2019t want it to be true regardless. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 leaving me?\u201d</p><p>You\u2019d glanced over your shoulder and nodded, offering nothing but a small \u201cmhmm\u201d before you stood and wandered towards the door.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He\u2019d pushed, a little arsey in his delivery as he sat up with a scowl, scratching the back of his head to further express his confusion.</p><p>You\u2019d stopped in the doorway, pouting for a brief moment before simply shrugging at him. \u201cDunno, just not really feelin\u2019 it today.\u201d Your words were lies, every single one of them categoric bullshit. Winding him up is one of your favourite past times, because when he\u2019s pissed off or upset, that\u2019s when you really get the most out of him, what you need out of him. The sex this morning had been nice\u2026 really fucking nice, it\u2019s just not what you wanted.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean today?!\u201d Harry had screamed after you when you disappeared, stressing repeatedly over your name. When you hadn\u2019t answered he\u2019d followed you, only to find you half dressed for work. \u201cY\u2019cant leave me because you\u2019re fucking <i>bored</i>, pet.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019d ignored him, appearing less bothered than ever before as you moved your way around him and his begging until you were really heading for the door. \u201cIt\u2019s just the way it is, Harry.\u201d You\u2019d shrugged again, resting a gentle hand on his arm as you gazed sympathetically at him, before leaving a single peck to his cheek and heading out the door to your car.</p><p>~</p><p>You sigh as you push your front door open, tossing your keys into the dish on the side and delicately stepping out of your work heels with a light kick to push them aside. You notice the light in the kitchen is on and smirk to yourself, tiptoeing your way towards it. You can hear little noises every few seconds, maybe a knife against a chopping board or a cupboard door being opened and closed.</p><p>You knew Harry wouldn\u2019t have taken your words as gospel earlier that morning, you knew he had more of his wits about him than to believe you\u2019d actually leave him. You just liked your life to be a bit more\u2026 exciting.</p><p>With a brief peek around the door you spot him fingering over a recipe book, concentrating perhaps a little too hard since he probably can\u2019t see.</p><p>\u201cTwo things,\u201d you announce your return and step fully into the room with a light crease between your brows, \u201cyou need to start wearing your glasses otherwise you\u2019ll go cross-eyed.\u201d</p><p>Harry looks up from his reading to scowl at you. \u201cNot really the time for jokes, is it?\u201d He grumbles, turning to full face you with his arms crossed over his chest.</p><p>You ignore his bitter tone and carry on. \u201cOther thing; what the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He silently reaches into his back pocket and smoothly tosses something across the room at you. You manage to catch it, even if the throw was a little wide, and find your spare set of house keys in your palm.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re <i>really</i> gonna break up with me,\u201d He begins, making his way towards you with a dark glint in his eye, \u201cy\u2019need to remember to ask for your keys back.\u201d</p><p>You can\u2019t help the dirty smirk breaking across your face as he reaches you, his hands gripping the side of your face as he forces his lips onto yours. He\u2019s eager and rough, slowly pushing your body backwards as he desperately coaxes your mouth open. Your tongues find one another, tasting and fighting with the other until Harry greedily takes your bottom lip between his teeth and pulling at it, biting harder and harder as he rolls it between his teeth. </p><p>You feel yourself pushed against a wall - you\u2019re not sure which wall because you\u2019re still blindly accepting his brutal attack on your lips - and your hands slip to the button and zip on his jeans. His lips temporarily move to you neck as you work on his jeans, teasing your skin with his teeth and suctioning on it until you\u2019re bruised from his work. </p><p>Once he\u2019s done he takes your waist and turns you so that your front is pressed against the wall. Your breath is suddenly coming heavier, a little groan escaping from you as he pushes you flush against it a little rougher that you\u2019d anticipated.</p><p>Harry takes a grip of your hair in one hand, pulling on it so that your head rolls backwards slightly and exposes your neck. He presses himself flat against you, delicately trailing kisses along your shoulder up to your neck. \u201cIs this what you wanted, baby girl?\u201d</p><p>His grip on your hair is restricting any movement of your head, something you know he\u2019s done so he can <i>hear</i> you. \u201cY-Yes.\u201d You nearly choke  on your words.</p><p>\u201cEh, come on now. You know how it works.\u201d His voice has grown impossibly deep, a hint of underlying threat to his tone that already has you quaking against the wall. \u201cYes <i>what</i>?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cYes, Daddy.\u201d</i></p><p>You know Harry\u2019s grin is wide as he buries his face into your neck, nipping along your shoulder with his teeth and leaving little red marks all along you. His movements are so smooth you barely notice him removing you of your work dress until he\u2019s pushing it over your shoulders, down your arms and crumpling at the floor.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t fancy wearing tights today, hm?\u201d He comments, since your now stood in just your knickers and your bra.</p><p>\u201cWas in a rush.\u201d You pant, your hot breath hitting the wall and brushing back against your face. </p><p>Harry yanks gently on your hair as a reminder, and it does little to help the heat between your thighs. </p><p>\u201cWas in a rush, <i>Daddy</i>.\u201d You emphasise the word in an attempt to get a further rise out of him.</p><p>\u201cNever have been good at following the rules have you, baby?\u201d He growls, biting at the bend of your jaw while he removes the remainder of your underwear and frees his length. \u201cHave you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really, Daddy, no.\u201d Your tone is pressed since his stiff cock is teasing against your cheeks and making you shake with need.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He grunts, holding your shoulder with one hand while the other lines up his cock to your entrance. \u201cAlways have been trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t bear the thought of not having me though, could you?\u201d You tease, because you know it\u2019s going to piss him off that bit more.</p><p>He knees your legs a little wider and slips into you with one quick motion, on hand still on your shoulder as the other grips your waist. \u201cYour mouth is gonna get you in trouble one day, pet.\u201d He warns as he begins fucking into you, adopting a much faster pace than you\u2019d experienced this morning.</p><p>Your hips are repeatedly clashing with the wall as he thrusts into you from behind, your hands fumbling for something to hold onto. His large length is stretching well into you, hitting you in places you\u2019re not so used to with his sloppy fucks. You brave the possible outcome and reach behind you into his hair, the other resting on the hand holding your waist.</p><p>As your fingers tangle and tug on his curls he finds it as motivation to pick up his pace, going in harder and faster than even before. It\u2019s got you whimpering helplessly, barely able to speak. He\u2019s stretching you so much it burns, and there\u2019s a numb pain in your hips from where they\u2019re clashing with the wall. Harry\u2019s mouth is still leaving bruises along your shoulder, and the last thing you\u2019re thinking about is how to cover them up for tomorrow.</p><p>The hand squeezing your waist glides down to your heat, his long middle finger reaching down to circle around your clit. It has you shaking, being overly sensitive in that area, and he has to push you firmly against the wall to keep you steady.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that, baby girl? Is it rough enough for you?\u201d His question is bitter, verging on irritated as he tugs on your ear with his teeth.</p><p>\u201cMhmm.\u201d You just about manage.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that, pet? Didn\u2019t quite hear you\u2026\u201d he pants between nips of your jaw. He\u2019s struggling to keep his pace now, slowing down just a fraction as he anticipates your reply.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d You choke at him. \u201cFucking hell, Daddy, yes.\u201d</p><p>Your words have him picking it up again, even messier than before to the point he\u2019s working himself up to his orgasm. As he thrusts into you one last heavy and forceful time, he\u2019s got you both crying out through your euphoric highs.</p><p>~</p><p>After a quick clean up Harry had gone back to making dinner while you had a quick shower. For the first time in a while you\u2019re a little sheepish when you return, wearing only a t-shirt (again, his) and a pair of pants.</p><p>When you reappear you find him by the stove, and you wrap your arms around his waist, pressing a kiss against his bare back. \u201cM\u2019sorry.\u201d You mumble against his skin.</p><p>You feel him laugh, and he glances over his shoulder at you with a bemused smile. \u201cWhat are you actually sorry for?\u201d</p><p>You avoid his gaze briefly and then look back to him. \u201cBeing a brat.\u201d</p><p>Harry chuckles and turns in your hold to caress his hands over the sides of your face. \u201cNot gonna change though, is it?\u201d</p><p>You hesitate for a moment, looking anywhere but him before pressing your lips into a hard line and shaking your head. \u201cNo, probably not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Harry giggles, pressing a hard kiss to your forehead. \u201cGood job I like y\u2019then, innit?\u201d</p><p>~~~</p><p>Good morning to meeee \ud83d\ude02</p><p>Tag list: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRQvNGuL791trMASjjacTyQ\">@pxrrishly</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgPyqI5CkEId8g7xFggm2Hg\">@permanentllyharry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM5Wesov-xsjMV0DS3xoxeQ\">@ofpeppermintbay</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb5MZxMvKL3E9V-fzr16asg\">@talesofstyles</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUftrmoCR-gJ36qDkBozOAg\">@abundantlyabundant</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mC46KFufQzMQFQPY1dCvfcA\">@joan-of-disappointment</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m73AsCPI6pl5ydzYNqZA7ig\">@staceystoleyourheart</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYYD0_lJbE8J3m-qWYoZ2Ww\">@hoeforhaz</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlRbiKuRhgrY3E3H8bL5cIg\">@harry12styles94</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNcSwE3yuAMUrJFCByV9VEA\">@belikebebe</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw8YPeV1kp6lQtCreciPNCQ\">@harryismydaddy21</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGFOmVWpQgDRviVbQYGjJ8w\">@meet-me-in-the-harry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5sffYoPzjk56Rs6ZvKn9FQ\">@joycelovedorial</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp_6aoPyziVdi6ZXi6B8LjQ\">@evaolin</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmcxuUK9ZWplnHQCdhUVD1A\">@harrystyles-concepts</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfxkucLlCoWB5Gmly8d8H6Q\">@harryisalittleshit</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6jWlNWmGyQNYnEd6-SS92A\">@newtosaur250</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/myJAa8KxYrK4vh_yQTZ_60g\">@sydneys-life-blog</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZRip2ZNdgboKd6U6cXPvGA\">@flowerrrrrchilddd</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgrGBah2yj4TnFyzYRijzTQ\">@belle-ofthe-sea</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbryUSDk8hHw5rIDbYFA7aQ\">@grace-leigh</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD79q662XJ4yMKN7-cXEIJQ\">@winchesterwife27</a> </p>",

                "content": "<p><i><b>Daddy kink anyone? I hope this alright for you! Again, sorry it took me a while, that&rsquo;s just kinda how it is atm. I&rsquo;d never heard the song before so I don&rsquo;t know if I got the jist, but I&rsquo;d love feedback please!!! Kate x</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving you.&rdquo;</i></p><p>That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;d said to him this morning on your way out of bed. After slow a, meditated, hot, sweaty, tantalising and all round perfect shag, you&rsquo;d slid from between his arms to sit up, reaching down for the t-shirt on the floor by your feet and pulling over your head. Yeah, his t-shirt.</p><p>He&rsquo;d frowned but had a slight feeling he knew what you were doing, but he didn&rsquo;t want it to be true regardless. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re&hellip; leaving me?&rdquo;</p><p>You&rsquo;d glanced over your shoulder and nodded, offering nothing but a small &ldquo;mhmm&rdquo; before you stood and wandered towards the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; He&rsquo;d pushed, a little arsey in his delivery as he sat up with a scowl, scratching the back of his head to further express his confusion.</p><p>You&rsquo;d stopped in the doorway, pouting for a brief moment before simply shrugging at him. &ldquo;Dunno, just not really feelin&rsquo; it today.&rdquo; Your words were lies, every single one of them categoric bullshit. Winding him up is one of your favourite past times, because when he&rsquo;s pissed off or upset, that&rsquo;s when you really get the most out of him, what you need out of him. The sex this morning had been nice&hellip; really fucking nice, it&rsquo;s just not what you wanted.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean today?!&rdquo; Harry had screamed after you when you disappeared, stressing repeatedly over your name. When you hadn&rsquo;t answered he&rsquo;d followed you, only to find you half dressed for work. &ldquo;Y&rsquo;cant leave me because you&rsquo;re fucking <i>bored</i>, pet.&rdquo;</p><p>You&rsquo;d ignored him, appearing less bothered than ever before as you moved your way around him and his begging until you were really heading for the door. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the way it is, Harry.&rdquo; You&rsquo;d shrugged again, resting a gentle hand on his arm as you gazed sympathetically at him, before leaving a single peck to his cheek and heading out the door to your car.</p><p>~</p><p>You sigh as you push your front door open, tossing your keys into the dish on the side and delicately stepping out of your work heels with a light kick to push them aside. You notice the light in the kitchen is on and smirk to yourself, tiptoeing your way towards it. You can hear little noises every few seconds, maybe a knife against a chopping board or a cupboard door being opened and closed.</p><p>You knew Harry wouldn&rsquo;t have taken your words as gospel earlier that morning, you knew he had more of his wits about him than to believe you&rsquo;d actually leave him. You just liked your life to be a bit more&hellip; exciting.</p><p>With a brief peek around the door you spot him fingering over a recipe book, concentrating perhaps a little too hard since he probably can&rsquo;t see.</p><p>&ldquo;Two things,&rdquo; you announce your return and step fully into the room with a light crease between your brows, &ldquo;you need to start wearing your glasses otherwise you&rsquo;ll go cross-eyed.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry looks up from his reading to scowl at you. &ldquo;Not really the time for jokes, is it?&rdquo; He grumbles, turning to full face you with his arms crossed over his chest.</p><p>You ignore his bitter tone and carry on. &ldquo;Other thing; what the hell are you doing here?&rdquo;</p><p>He silently reaches into his back pocket and smoothly tosses something across the room at you. You manage to catch it, even if the throw was a little wide, and find your spare set of house keys in your palm.</p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re <i>really</i> gonna break up with me,&rdquo; He begins, making his way towards you with a dark glint in his eye, &ldquo;y&rsquo;need to remember to ask for your keys back.&rdquo;</p><p>You can&rsquo;t help the dirty smirk breaking across your face as he reaches you, his hands gripping the side of your face as he forces his lips onto yours. He&rsquo;s eager and rough, slowly pushing your body backwards as he desperately coaxes your mouth open. Your tongues find one another, tasting and fighting with the other until Harry greedily takes your bottom lip between his teeth and pulling at it, biting harder and harder as he rolls it between his teeth. </p><p>You feel yourself pushed against a wall - you&rsquo;re not sure which wall because you&rsquo;re still blindly accepting his brutal attack on your lips - and your hands slip to the button and zip on his jeans. His lips temporarily move to you neck as you work on his jeans, teasing your skin with his teeth and suctioning on it until you&rsquo;re bruised from his work. </p><p>Once he&rsquo;s done he takes your waist and turns you so that your front is pressed against the wall. Your breath is suddenly coming heavier, a little groan escaping from you as he pushes you flush against it a little rougher that you&rsquo;d anticipated.</p><p>Harry takes a grip of your hair in one hand, pulling on it so that your head rolls backwards slightly and exposes your neck. He presses himself flat against you, delicately trailing kisses along your shoulder up to your neck. &ldquo;Is this what you wanted, baby girl?&rdquo;</p><p>His grip on your hair is restricting any movement of your head, something you know he&rsquo;s done so he can <i>hear</i> you. &ldquo;Y-Yes.&rdquo; You nearly choke  on your words.</p><p>&ldquo;Eh, come on now. You know how it works.&rdquo; His voice has grown impossibly deep, a hint of underlying threat to his tone that already has you quaking against the wall. &ldquo;Yes <i>what</i>?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes, Daddy.&rdquo;</i></p><p>You know Harry&rsquo;s grin is wide as he buries his face into your neck, nipping along your shoulder with his teeth and leaving little red marks all along you. His movements are so smooth you barely notice him removing you of your work dress until he&rsquo;s pushing it over your shoulders, down your arms and crumpling at the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t fancy wearing tights today, hm?&rdquo; He comments, since your now stood in just your knickers and your bra.</p><p>&ldquo;Was in a rush.&rdquo; You pant, your hot breath hitting the wall and brushing back against your face. </p><p>Harry yanks gently on your hair as a reminder, and it does little to help the heat between your thighs. </p><p>&ldquo;Was in a rush, <i>Daddy</i>.&rdquo; You emphasise the word in an attempt to get a further rise out of him.</p><p>&ldquo;Never have been good at following the rules have you, baby?&rdquo; He growls, biting at the bend of your jaw while he removes the remainder of your underwear and frees his length. &ldquo;Have you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not really, Daddy, no.&rdquo; Your tone is pressed since his stiff cock is teasing against your cheeks and making you shake with need.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He grunts, holding your shoulder with one hand while the other lines up his cock to your entrance. &ldquo;Always have been trouble.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t bear the thought of not having me though, could you?&rdquo; You tease, because you know it&rsquo;s going to piss him off that bit more.</p><p>He knees your legs a little wider and slips into you with one quick motion, on hand still on your shoulder as the other grips your waist. &ldquo;Your mouth is gonna get you in trouble one day, pet.&rdquo; He warns as he begins fucking into you, adopting a much faster pace than you&rsquo;d experienced this morning.</p><p>Your hips are repeatedly clashing with the wall as he thrusts into you from behind, your hands fumbling for something to hold onto. His large length is stretching well into you, hitting you in places you&rsquo;re not so used to with his sloppy fucks. You brave the possible outcome and reach behind you into his hair, the other resting on the hand holding your waist.</p><p>As your fingers tangle and tug on his curls he finds it as motivation to pick up his pace, going in harder and faster than even before. It&rsquo;s got you whimpering helplessly, barely able to speak. He&rsquo;s stretching you so much it burns, and there&rsquo;s a numb pain in your hips from where they&rsquo;re clashing with the wall. Harry&rsquo;s mouth is still leaving bruises along your shoulder, and the last thing you&rsquo;re thinking about is how to cover them up for tomorrow.</p><p>The hand squeezing your waist glides down to your heat, his long middle finger reaching down to circle around your clit. It has you shaking, being overly sensitive in that area, and he has to push you firmly against the wall to keep you steady.</p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that, baby girl? Is it rough enough for you?&rdquo; His question is bitter, verging on irritated as he tugs on your ear with his teeth.</p><p>&ldquo;Mhmm.&rdquo; You just about manage.</p><p>&ldquo;What was that, pet? Didn&rsquo;t quite hear you&hellip;&rdquo; he pants between nips of your jaw. He&rsquo;s struggling to keep his pace now, slowing down just a fraction as he anticipates your reply.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; You choke at him. &ldquo;Fucking hell, Daddy, yes.&rdquo;</p><p>Your words have him picking it up again, even messier than before to the point he&rsquo;s working himself up to his orgasm.
