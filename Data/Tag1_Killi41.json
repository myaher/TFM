        "body": "<p>\u201cWhat are\nyou doing?\u201d</p><p>Eve\u2019s heart\nskipped a beat. At first she thought it was Billie talking, but then she\nrealized Billie would not speak with a Russian accent. It was Villanelle. Talking\nto <i>her.</i></p><p>\u201cAre you going\nto listen all night?\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Well, was\nshe? Going to listen? She hadn\u2019t really thought about how long she was going to\nsit here, but she knew that some part of her wanted to stay awake, wanted to\nhear from her again, wanted to know how she was doing. <i>What</i> she was doing. </p><p>\u201cAre you\nhaving fun in Rome?\u201d</p><p>Yes. Fuck,\nshe was having fun. Because she was working with Villanelle. She had an excuse\nto spend time with her, listen to her, because it was all professional and what\nnot. A justified excuse and an insane desire to protect her. An assassin. </p><p>Then Villanelle\u2026\ngiggled? And her breathing sounded so heavy.</p><p>Eve felt\nher heart beat even faster. It felt so damn intimate. The thought of Villanelle\nmost likely lying in her bed, whispering to her, even though she knew she would\nnot be able to get an answer\u2026 the thought excited Eve to no end. It allowed her\nto enjoy it. Shamelessly. Because she didn\u2019t have to say anything. <i>Couldn\u2019t</i> say anything. And yet here she\nwas, at the receiving end, listening to the woman she desired. </p><p>And Villanelle\nsounded so\u2026 soft? Almost vulnerable. And so fucking, fucking sexy. </p><p>\u201cYou should\nlet yourself go once in a while\u2026\u201d</p><p>Fuck, that\naccent\u2026 it was driving her insane. It sent shivers down her spine\u2026 having Villanelle\u2019s\nvoice literally inside her ear, so close\u2026 it was an intimacy she had never felt\nbefore. </p><p>\u201cI can help\nyou\u2026\u201d</p><p>Oh my god. Eve\nfelt her pulse race. She was sure she had never wanted anyone this hard in her\nlife. </p><p>And how much\nshe wanted her to help her let go\u2026 How much she wanted to finally know what\nwould happen if they dared go down that route.</p><p>Eve heard more\nheavy breathing. Was she\u2026 Was she <i>actually</i>\ndoing <i>that</i>? Was Villanelle touching\nherself right this second? She had told her before that she\u2019d masturbate\nthinking about Eve (often!), and Eve had had that image stuck inside her head ever\nsince, but actually hearing her do it? It was a whole new level.</p><p>Eve felt\nthat throbbing between her legs and she knew she had to do something about it.\nIt was as if all her dirty little fantasies were coming true and Eve knew she\nhad to take her chance. She was this close to just letting her hand slip inside\nher pants when she remembered there was somebody else in the room. Somebody who\nhad made it quite clear that he was attracted to her.</p><p>Motivated\nby Villanelle\u2019s heavy breathing she went over to the bed, straddling him. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk.\u201d</p><p>Eve closed\nher eyes, trying her best to imagine Villanelle beneath her, wishing she would\nbe even more vocal. She was craving the sound of her voice. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all\nI can think of.\u201d \u2013 Oh, thank god. She\u2019d keep talking, wouldn\u2019t she?</p><p>\u201cI think\nabout the smell of your hair. About your skin. It felt so good to touch your\nhand today.
