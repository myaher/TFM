The fact that Cersei confides this to Sansa indicates not only that both women share a very interesting bizarre and dysfunctional yet somehow loving relationship (this really is one of the most amazing relationships in this story) but also foreshadows Sansa questioning once again the laws of succession. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/af31e4376173ed65a40ae9d0d3e86a56/tumblr_inline_peedne7gva1sgp768_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>In a A Storm of Swords &nbsp;we see Sansa for the first time realizing that she, a girl, now actually has &nbsp;a claim to Winterfell. People usually forget that Sansa grew up believing her only option was to marry a high Lord. Being a girl and having 3 brothers never believed she was ever entitled to any holdfast or land since male heirs are always preferred.<br /></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;But he does not know you,&rdquo; Dontos insisted, &ldquo;and he will not love you. Jonquil, Jonquil, open your sweet eyes, these Tyrells care nothing for you. It&rsquo;s your claim they mean to wed.&rdquo;</p><p><b>&ldquo;My claim?&rdquo; She was lost for a moment.</b></p><p>&gt;&ldquo;Sweetling,&rdquo; he told her, &ldquo;you are heir to Winterfell.&rdquo; He grabbed her again, pleading that she must not do this thing, and Sansa wrenched free and left him swaying beneath the heart tree. She had not visited the godswood since.</p><p>But she had not forgotten his words, either. The heir to Winterfell, she would think as she lay abed at night. It&rsquo;s your claim they mean to wed. Sansa had grown up with three brothers. She never thought to have a claim, but with Bran and Rickon dead &hellip; It doesn&rsquo;t matter, there&rsquo;s still Robb, he&rsquo;s a man grown now, and soon he&rsquo;ll wed and have a son. Anyway, Willas Tyrell will have Highgarden, what would he want with Winterfell?</p><p>(Sansa &ndash; ASOS)</p></blockquote><p>_______________________________________________________________</p><p><br /></p><p>In A Feast for Crowns, ser Arys and Arianne discuss the idea of having Myrcella as the heir of the Throne, and not young Tommen. And how the rule should be about order of birth and not gender. </p><blockquote><p>&gt; It was true. Tommen was a good-hearted little man who always tried his best, but the last time Ser Arys saw him he had been weeping on the quay. Myrcella never shed a tear, though it was she who was leaving hearth and home to seal an alliance with her maidenhood. The truth was, the princess was braver than her brother, and brighter and more confident as well. Her wits were quicker, her courtesies more polished. Nothing ever daunted her, not even Joffrey. </p><p>(Arianne - AFFC)</p></blockquote><p>_______________________________________________________________</p><p><br /></p><p>Later on season 7 we have Sansa once again dealing with the fact that girls can inherit lands on front of their younger brothers; Once Bran returned to Winterfell the very first thing Sansa did was to offer him his rightful title of Lord of Winterfell. Now, it was Sansa with the help of Jon Snow that took back the castle and the North for House Stark, yet because of the succession, laws she has to pass the castle back to her little brother. (This isn&rsquo;t a stab on Bran, his storyline was always involved with the magical aspect of the show) but once again puts in the spotlight that girls are passed over boys when it comes to succession and inheritance.<br /></p><p>Which is why I believe this will be one of her first changes as queen in the end of the story. Westeros will follow Dorne&rsquo;s example and succession will now be by the order of birth and not by gender. </p></p>",

First on season 1, when Septa Mordane takes Sansa to the Throne Room and both women discuss the idea of Sansa giving birth to an heir.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Septa Mordane: One day, your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side. And one day before too long you will present your son to the court. All the Lords of Westeros will gather here to see the little prince.</p>\n<p>Sansa: What if I have a girl?</p>\n<p>Septa Mordane: Gods been good, you will have boys and girls and plenty of them.</p>\n<p>Sansa: What if I **<b>only</b>** have girls?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sansa wonders what its going to happen in case she fails to provide a male heir to the Kingdom. This wont be the last time the laws of succession will be present on her storyline. </p>\n</p>",

Their rendition of Melisandre, for example, isn&rsquo;t an intimidating and imposing practitioner of dark and supernatural powers, but rather a seductress who&rsquo;s able to make people obey her only if she rewards them with sex (Stannis, Gendry) or gold (Brotherhood without Banners). One more example would be their rendition of Margaery Tyrell, who was turned from a teenage girl with a perfect facade and somewhat mysterious foundation, into a promiscuous lady willing to do anything \u2013 even have sex with both her brother and her husband simultaneously, as she proposes to the latter in Season 2 \u2013 in order to achieve her personal political ambitions that are literally limitless.</p><p>With that in mind, Sansa Stark never had a chance to be properly adapted in the show created by D&amp;D. Now, the word &lsquo;properly&rsquo; has a rather wide range of possible meanings, and this essay will attempt to examine at least some of them, but, for now, let&rsquo;s say that the most obvious aspect in which TV Sansa was shorthanded is her screen time. In &ldquo;A Clash of Kings&rdquo;, the book that was the basis for the Season 2 of GoT, Sansa&rsquo;s POV chapters, along with Tyrion&rsquo;s, are the only ones that depict what&rsquo;s happening in King&rsquo;s Landing, the capital of The Seven Kingdoms and the center of political power in the story. This goes for the first two thirds of &ldquo;A Storm of Swords&rdquo; as well, e.g. until the moment Sansa escapes from King&rsquo;s Landing. In short, her chapters couldn&rsquo;t help but be of paramount importance in the narrative sense. In the show, however, Sansa&rsquo;s significance is greatly decreased, and not only because the show doesn&rsquo;t follow the &ldquo;POV structure&rdquo; of the novels, but because she&rsquo;s reduced to nothing but a prized captive for the Lannisters.</p><!-- more --><p>Yes, TV Sansa is a minor, and she&rsquo;s played by a minor, named Sophie Turner. Her age, due to the laws that forbid the usage of underage children in explicit sex scenes, prevented D&amp;D from using Sansa in a way they adore. And her age couldn&rsquo;t be drastically changed without drastic consequences on her overall arc which is, in ACOK at least, built around her first period. That&rsquo;s why, for example, D&amp;D couldn&rsquo;t cast Natalie Dormer \u2013 one of their favorite ASOIAF characters, by the way, because they did alter Margaery to suit the actress, instead of the other way around \u2013 in the role of Sansa, because Dormer, while certainly looking younger than she is, could never pass as a minor.</p><p>And that would probably be the only thing that makes Sansa off-limits for Natalie Dormer, or some other actress D&amp;D adore, to play her in D&amp;D&rsquo;s adaptation. Everything else would&rsquo;ve been doable. Had George R. R. Martin not put her first period in the books, Sansa&rsquo;s age, promiscuity, vocabulary, even wardrobe, would&rsquo;ve been changed accordingly to suit D&amp;D&rsquo;s vision of a progressive Westerosi woman, which means the first three would&rsquo;ve been amplified, while the fourth one \u2013 wardrobe \u2013 would definitely be reduced and freed from all the unnecessary parts. She&rsquo;d probably even hook up with some rogue brute at some point; when she&rsquo;d find the time for him, that is; after she&rsquo;s done with Joff, Tyrion, Lancel, and god knows who else, she&rsquo;d certainly figure out cynical killers can occupy her bed just as good as other available men can.</p><p>Speaking of cynical killers \u2013 enter Sandor Clegane. One more character that, alas, couldn&rsquo;t be played by Natalie Dormer, and therefore not of particular interest to D&amp;D. Sandor in the novels is a truly memorable fellow, who slowly but steadily grows in readers&rsquo; eyes as the story progresses. At the beginning, he&rsquo;s nothing more than a merciless brute used only for killing people Lannisters want dead. Very soon, however, a reader finds out there might be some traces of soul under that rough surface. More and more we find out about Sandor, more and more intriguing and understandable he gets. Even \u2013 more likable.</p><p>Now, what makes him likable? The stories Littlefinger tells to Sansa?! Of course not. The stories Sandor himself keeps telling to Sansa are what fleshes him to the extent that was probably impossible to predict at the beginning of the series. Through his conversations with Sansa, we find out every important thing there is to know about him. Later on, when he hangs up with Arya, Sandor is already a fully developed character, whom we aren&rsquo;t discovering any more, but rather following. And he became like that precisely through his exchanges with Sansa.</p><p>The show went the other way, and a pretty odd way, at that. D&amp;D decided it was better for Littlefinger to deliver the story of how Sandor&rsquo;s face got burned, and that decision carries some very serious consequences in regards to characterization. For example, Littlefinger appears as someone who does know the secrets of King&rsquo;s Landing, but, at the same time, as someone who doesn&rsquo;t hesitate to share those secrets with persons he doesn&rsquo;t have any control over. Yes, he warns Sansa not to tell anyone about the story; but, he warns her because, and here comes the funny part \u2013 Sandor is going to kill her.</p><p>Now, why isn&rsquo;t Littlefinger afraid Sandor&rsquo;s going to kill him? After all, isn&rsquo;t that the logical question because it&rsquo;s Littlefinger who offers Sandor&rsquo;s secrets to others? It seems there are only two possible answers: 1) Sandor is not that scary and dangerous as Littlefinger claims, or 2) Sandor is a dangerous fellow, but Littlefinger is the bravest individual alive, because he goes around telling the secrets of people that physically can literally eat him for breakfast; and he isn&rsquo;t shy even, because he doesn&rsquo;t fail to warn Sansa how dangerous is the situation he himself dares so boldly.</p><p>Whatever conclusion a viewer draws from there, something is going to be radically changed from the source material. Quite possibly, in fact, a lot of things are going to be altered. After the said scene, both Littlefinger and Sandor are drastically different than their book origins. And the characters we ended up with in the show, are not nearly as complex and intriguing as their book counterparts. This is especially true for Sandor, who&rsquo;s nothing if not scary and dangerous. He is supposed to frighten the living hell out of everyone who isn&rsquo;t his older brother. If you take that away from Sandor, you&rsquo;re only left with his tender side.</p><p>But, even his tender side was almost entirely removed from the show. This time, not only by Littlefinger, but also by Tyrion: in the throne room, when Joff orders Kingsguards to undress Sansa, Sandor stands there silently. His face exp<b></b>ression suggests he isn&rsquo;t pleased with what he sees, but that&rsquo;s it. He doesn&rsquo;t stand up to his king with firm &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough&rdquo; as in the book. It is therefore on Tyrion exclusively to deny Joffrey the pleasure of torturing the girl whose only crime was that she saw him in a moment of unflattering weakness. As in the books, TV Tyrion enters the room with his sellsword and he defends Sansa from Joff, but the important difference is that in the show it looks like Tyrion is the only one both willing to oppose Joffrey and capable of doing it. In the novel, we can sense that Sandor is ready to do the same thing, only, in his case, it comes with a much bigger risk, which is not without importance.</p><p>So, in this particular case, Sandor was sacrificed for the sake of TV Tyrion. TV Littlefinger, however, wasn&rsquo;t forgotten in that regard, because, once again, he&rsquo;s fed with lines that originally belong to Sandor. In the finale of the second season, it is Littlefinger who tells Sansa to look around and see how much better than her all those liars are. Just as the last time around, this change serves neither Littlefinger nor Sandor: the former&rsquo;s creepy-mentoring side is exposed much earlier than it would be logical, while the latter is robbed of yet another moment in which he shows how much he cares for Sansa and how protective he is toward her.</p><p>Sansa is a case on its own, as far as wrong adaptations are concerned. She&rsquo;s in the league with her mother Catelyn Stark, as two Stark women that were literally butchered in the show. The thing two of them have in common is the nature of their complexity: opposite to other female characters in ASOIAF, like Dany or Arya or Asha or Brienne or Cersei, Cat and Sansa aren&rsquo;t interested in hurting their enemies with their own hands, or, in the case of Dany, with her own dragons (this goes for Cersei, too, even though she&rsquo;s the one ordering the suffering of others, not committing it: her aggression is always personal, as we can sense in the first three novels). And, what&rsquo;s more, Sansa isn&rsquo;t interested in hurting anyone, actually. Cat does have an aggressive side in her; it&rsquo;s female aggression all the way, but aggression it is. Sansa, on the other hand, almost never desires other people to suffer in any way. There&rsquo;s only one noticeable exception: Joffrey. She does think on one or two occasions how nice it would be if Robb put a sword in Joff, and, by extension, she wishes Lannisters are defeated in the war against her family. However, we have to consider the situation she finds herself in at those moments \u2013 imprisoned by the Lannisters and at Joff&rsquo;s 'mercy&rsquo; all the time; small miracle she wishes them ill. I&rsquo;ve never been a girl arrested by the grave enemies of my family, but if I was, I&rsquo;d definitely pray for their most horrible deaths every single night. And, we have to remember that, after Joff&rsquo;s death, she fails to feel happy over it, even though she tries to a little.</p><p>Therefore, it maybe isn&rsquo;t a stretch to say Sansa is probably the one character that is most unlike the author himself. Other major characters, especially POV ones, do resemble Martin at least partially. For males, it&rsquo;s obvious: even though GRRM never fought in a war, nor had any military training whatsoever, men are men; even in our day and age, no male is a complete stranger to war; while depicting all those dramatic battles and duels was quite an achievement (which no personal experience would make any easier, truth be told, because in ASOIAF the combat as a phenomenon is illustrated from any number of angles, each among them presented with an abundance of details), ultimately it was in himself where Martin could find a lot of answers about his male characters, whose position in a society is never independent from their combat prowess or lack of it. Female characters, on the other hand, had to be trickier, just like they always are for male authors \u2013 let&rsquo;s admit it, they are not that good in creating great females, just like women writers usually don&rsquo;t produce male characters that are a match to their female characters nor to the male heroes created by male authors. In our day and age, these &ldquo;gender rules&rdquo; are rarely spoken of, but they continue to exist, due to gender predispositions that are nowhere as strong as in the mind of an individual. There are exceptions, as in good male characters created by women and vice versa, but they are in a clear minority compared to underdeveloped or unrealistic characters whose only &ldquo;fault&rdquo; was that they didn&rsquo;t share the sex with an author. And in that regard, ASOIAF could very well be unparalleled: it is perhaps impossible to find any other story that features nearly as many memorable male and female characters both, as ASOIAF does (truth be told, that fact alone should be enough to inspire analysts and scholars to look at ASOIAF at a different, more demanding light, and not as a genre piece).</p><p>Martin&rsquo;s girls, however, aren&rsquo;t completely unlike the man who came up with them. Most of them are willingly participating in &ldquo;men games&rdquo;, e.g. power-plays and/or wars, which makes for a precious connection to a male mindset of the author. They are thinking and behaving as women (or, in the case of Arya, and Dany to an extent, as girls), but all of them are interacting with something that, in all its glory and misery, can roughly be called &ldquo;a man&rsquo;s world&rdquo;. Some of the most beautifully written chapters in the series are delivered from female POVs \u2013 The Red Wedding and Cersei&rsquo;s &ldquo;Walk of Shame&rdquo; come to mind right away; but, in a thematic sense, those and other female chapters don&rsquo;t differ too much from male POVs.</p><p>Except for Sansa&rsquo;s chapters, which unmistakably belong to something we can roughly call &ldquo;a woman&rsquo;s world&rdquo;. Chapters of both male and female POVs in ASOIAF are often rich with testosterone, but Sansa\u2019s ones are almost entirely driven by estrogen: look no further than her captivity in King&rsquo;s Landing, that actually is, as already said, focused around her first period \u2013 that decision solely should bring a lot of respect for Martin, because he had to know going that road is never easy for a male writer.</p><p>And the funniest thing is, it all fits. Sansa&rsquo;s storyline is distinctive in tone, but not odd. It is a legitimate part of the general plot of ASOIAF. In fact, as her story progresses, Sansa becomes more and more important for The Game, even though she showed no clear inclination to participate in it so far, but at the same time, Martin keeps Sansa away from all those &ldquo;male&rdquo; aspects he decorated other female characters of his saga.</p><p>And on top of everything, we&rsquo;re presented with her love story, a romance with no other than the man who, prior to discovering some delicate feelings for Sansa, could pose for an ideal brute of Westeros. At the beginning of the story, Sandor Clegane could be perceived as the exact opposite of Sansa. As someone who has no business whatsoever in her world, just like she has none in his. But, with some craft wording and master subtlety, Martin succeeds in illustrating the flood of emotions that go both ways in their relationship. Those emotions are never easy, nor appropriate, let alone allowed \u2013 even by Sansa and Sandor themselves! \u2013 but they&rsquo;re hard to be denied.</p><p>The complexity of their multilayered characters, of their respective positions in a society and in an ongoing war, and of their relationship that resists all known clich\u00e9s, represent some of the strongest evidence that ASOIAF is much more than a genre piece. There&rsquo;s a lot in these novels that escapes genre boundaries, but nothing more evidently than SanSan. Stuff like that is not your usual fantasy element, no matter how flattering fantasy can be as a label (Homer, Shakespeare, Tolkien \u2013 to name just a few all-time greats that created unforgettable stories with supernatural aspects in them). Any author who comes up with that kind of love story involving those kind of characters \u2013 and with a legion of other characters, and with no less than four different religions, and with themes of honor, redemption, identity, bravery, equality, ancestry, legacy, freedom, revolution&hellip; \u2013 deserves to be analyzed not as a genre writer.</p><p>Now, one can only imagine what kind of enigma Sansa and Sandor were for Benioff and Weiss. And it pretty much remained unsolved, because, when faced with all the complexity of these two characters, Benioff and Weiss decided to remove it almost entirely, along with their relationship that is reduced to occasional and odd mentioning of 'little bird&rsquo;. TV Sandor was simplified to a one-note brute that goes around TV Westeros and lectures people about the pleasures of killing, a one-note brute he never was in the novels, not even in the beginning of the saga. TV Sansa, on the other hand, was denied her book complexity by shutting down all her layers, one by one. For example, Benioff and Weiss completely removed her decision to go behind her father&rsquo;s back and inform Cersei of his plan. They simply refused to go down that road. They did something similar to Catelyn, whose infamous line to Jon they didn&rsquo;t remove entirely, but did replace it with a much softer one. It is pretty safe to assume that Cat&rsquo;s and Sansa&rsquo;s complexity did bother Benioff and Weiss from the get-go.</p><p>What&rsquo;s also removed from the show is Sansa&rsquo;s agency, primarily represented in the novels by her secret meetings with Dontos, a disgraced knight she herself saved from Joffrey. In the show, we got only the saving scene; it was filmed and executed clumsily, but it was there at least. However, until recently, nobody could be sure Sansa did save Dontos, because the man disappeared afterwards (he was briefly seen as joggling balls in &ldquo;Blackwater&rdquo; episode, in the scene in Cersei&rsquo;s chambers, but he was unrecognizable for the vast majority of audience). It is reported, though, that Dontos will be returning in Season 4, so yes, Sansa did save his life after all. But, even when he returns, Sansa&rsquo;s attempts at escaping will be two seasons younger than they should&rsquo;ve been at that point, and it&rsquo;s hard to see a way D&amp;D can remedy that neglect.</p><p>Show-lovers often defend D&amp;D in regards to Sansa, by saying her personality is a difficult and tricky one for portraying on screen, because even in the books she&rsquo;s introverted. Now, maybe she isn&rsquo;t the most extroverted character ever, but she&rsquo;s pretty far from reclusive, as she does communicate with the outside world a lot at the beginning of the series, before she&rsquo;s imprisoned. And even while in captivity, she can&rsquo;t help but communicate with Sandor and Dontos. What&rsquo;s more, around two of them she is her true self, which provides a wide array of possibilities for a good and informative dialogue that, in an adaptation, could compensate for the lack of inner thoughts. With Dontos, she&rsquo;s open not only because she saved him, but also because he explicitly offers his help (and, truth be told, it is he who enabled her to leave King&rsquo;s Landing eventually, so, even though he wasn&rsquo;t exactly honest with her concerning his motivations, her trust wasn&rsquo;t as misplaced as it may seem at first). And with Sandor, she&rsquo;s open for no particular reason \u2013 other than those subtle, emotional forces, that both of them can&rsquo;t help but follow and eventually become the closest and most intimate beings to each other.</p><p>The way Martin incepted and developed the barely visible, but undeniable romance, between Sansa and Sandor, is nothing short of literary brilliance. With so few words and interactions, he managed so much. The vast majority of readers are aware of restrained attraction they mutually feel, even though they didn&rsquo;t share a single physical aspect of the romantic relationship.</p><p>Martin is indeed a master of subtlety, as evidenced by what looks like the endless amount of carefully hidden clues that point to any number of narrative puzzles, realization of which do make an entire story much richer than if taken at face value. And he&rsquo;s never more subtle than with two romances: Rhaegar/Lyanna and Sandor/Sansa. Now, the respective nature of subtlety of those two romances is rather different. With Rhaegar and Lyanna, a reader is \u2013 through Robert&rsquo;s retelling \u2013 offered a version that is actually the very opposite of what probably happened, and only later a reader can pick up clues here and there, and finally figure out the story of a fatal attraction between the two. But, the clues are presented throughout the text, so much that, even if you don&rsquo;t decipher everything after the first read, at the end of &ldquo;A Game of Thrones&rdquo; \u2013 the first book of the series \u2013 you&rsquo;ll probably sense that Robert&rsquo;s view on events wasn&rsquo;t exactly accurate.</p><p>The story of Sansa and Sandor is a very different one. Their relationship is never as much as addressed, even by themselves. Sandor isn&rsquo;t a POV character, and he&rsquo;s not exactly open to people, so his silence on the matter isn&rsquo;t unexpected. But, Martin didn&rsquo;t address their romance even in Sansa&rsquo;s chapters, which are typically packed with inner thoughts of the POV character. It looks like Martin decided to do it the harder way and make their romance somewhat a mystery even for Sansa, which, in hindsight, does seem to be the most logical way: what teenage girl would be fully aware of a romance that &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo;, and experienced in those dire circumstances?! As a result of that decision, the readers got a completely fascinating depiction of a romance, that can be described as a train you hear from miles away: at first, you can&rsquo;t even tell is it a train or some similar sound, but slowly, with every second, you&rsquo;re more and more certain that your ears didn&rsquo;t trick you, and very soon the train is so loud that it is the only thing you can hear at all. In the novels, a reader may find something strange at first, when Sandor shares the secret of his burned face with Sansa. Some alarm may be turned on deep inside. And it becomes more apparent each time two of them share a page, with a culmination during the Battle of the Blackwater Bay, when Sandor, after he decides to desert the Lannisters, visits Sansa in her room and offers to take her home to Winterfell.</p><p>It might be the only instance in the entire series where Sandor did ask anyone&rsquo;s approval, which does speak volumes about his feelings for Sansa. Considering the manner in which Martin described this romance, Sandor&rsquo;s actions on that day was as good as a confession of his deep attraction to her. Sansa, on the other hand, doesn&rsquo;t have a single moment which could be pointed at as a prime evidence of her undeniable love for The Hound, but this doesn&rsquo;t mean her feelings toward Sandor aren&rsquo;t palpable. It&rsquo;s one more mastery of the writer: through her frequent (and skewed, but in a telling way) memories on the last time she saw Sandor, he was able to show her feelings resonating more and more inside her.</p><p>In the show, Martin was denied a chance to do the same thing, even though he wrote the &ldquo;Blackwater&rdquo; episode in Season 2. Thanks to the already destroyed storyline, and to god knows how many changes, and to D&amp;D&rsquo;s decision to remove from the final cut some scenes Martin referred to with his scenes, the one between Sansa and Sandor near the end of that episode, served more as a greeting to book-fans who like SanSan in the source material, than as a goodbye between two not unlike souls who shared much, and could have shared a lot more, and maybe are going to if they meet again. In that scene, Rory McCann was visibly better than usual as Sandor, and Sophie Turner was as good as usual, but, just like with anything ASOIAF, the scene doesn&rsquo;t have nearly the same impact and importance if taken out of context.</p><p>The exact context of their SanSan is yet to be fully revealed in the books, too. Because of the already mentioned subtlety \u2013 a quality that seems to intimidate showrunners Benioff and Weiss, who, in their turn, do retaliate with their on-screen war on subtlety (just recall what they turned other romances into; for example, the romance between TV Jon &ldquo;Not The Brightest Kid In The Block&rdquo; Snow and TV &ldquo;I Know Everything And Therefore I Can&rsquo;t Stop Talking&rdquo; Ygritte) \u2013 Sansa&rsquo;s and Sandor&rsquo;s love story is by no means an open book. Their romance has its own share of mystery, one of which may be: what inspired those two persons to feel so strongly for each other? Personally, I always thought their mutual attraction isn&rsquo;t only based on a &ldquo;beauty and the beast&rdquo; model. There is that, but in their case it goes deeper. If that was the engine behind his emotions, Sandor had more than enough opportunities to find a beauty for his beast long before Sansa entered his life. With Sansa, I&rsquo;d say their mutual attraction is rooted in their personalities. For example, if you take away Sandor&rsquo;s aggression, he also isn&rsquo;t interested in hurting others. He&rsquo;s naturally talented for violence, and he lives in a society that respects that kind of talent, and that is why he&rsquo;s violent for a living, but at the end of the day, the suffering of others isn&rsquo;t any kind of reward for him. Possibly, because he isn&rsquo;t interested in other people that much. Though, when he is interested in someone, the interest is as strong as they come.</p><p>(We don&rsquo;t know at this point, but it&rsquo;s not a stretch to imagine that his reaction to the news that his hated brother was killed wasn&rsquo;t unlike Sansa&rsquo;s reaction to Joff&rsquo;s death. &ldquo;Am I glad he&rsquo;s dead? Well, not exactly, even though I wanted him killed.&rdquo;)</p><p>Sansa may very well be like that, too. That would be one of the possible explanations of her AGOT actions. Like the rest of the Starks, Sansa is a complex character that has some issues of her own, without which neither she nor the other Starks would be such memorable characters as they obviously are; it is the fact that they are both willing and strong enough to fight those issues, that Starks stand out for. Without going into details (as if I could!), I expect that in the remaining novels Sansa is going to face the reasons that made her go to Cersei that damned night and with the consequences of that action. And whatever comes out of that soul-searching will be inevitably combined with her claim to Winterfell that Littlefinger brought up in AFFC. And that combination is going to elevate Sansa&rsquo;s arc to even bigger and more important levels than so far, even though so far she was the one Stark that was most engaged \u2013 unwittingly, but still \u2013 in the bloody dynastic war for the Iron Throne.</p><p>And she&rsquo;ll have to cross paths with Sandor Clegane, one way or another. Their relationship was so meticulously built up, it simply has to get some sort of a closure. What that closure is going to be is impossible to predict, because we are talking of one George R. R. Martin, a writer who managed to shock us as he pleased more than a few times.</p><p>What is also impossible, is to take anything that did or didn&rsquo;t happen in the show as any indication at what the closer may or may not be. There isn&rsquo;t a storyline in GoT that wasn&rsquo;t drastically changed, and weakened in the process, but Sansa&rsquo;s arc, along with her relationship with Sandor, is among the biggest victims of D&amp;D&rsquo;s inability to adapt.</p><p>Whether you happen to like what Benioff and Weiss put in the show, or don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;d be advised not to recognize any significance in their decisions for further developments in ASOIAF. Just like show-lovers tend to remind everyone else, GoT and ASOIAF are two entirely separate beasts. And book Sansa and book Sandor, along with everything Martin has in his store for them, can be really glad about it.</p>",

Their rendition of Melisandre, for example, isn\u2019t an intimidating and imposing practitioner of dark and supernatural powers, but rather a seductress who\u2019s able to make people obey her only if she rewards them with sex (Stannis, Gendry) or gold (Brotherhood without Banners). One more example would be their rendition of Margaery Tyrell, who was turned from a teenage girl with a perfect facade and somewhat mysterious foundation, into a promiscuous lady willing to do anything \u2013 even have sex with both her brother and her husband simultaneously, as she proposes to the latter in Season 2 \u2013 in order to achieve her personal political ambitions that are literally limitless.</p><p>With that in mind, Sansa Stark never had a chance to be properly adapted in the show created by D&amp;D. Now, the word \u2018properly\u2019 has a rather wide range of possible meanings, and this essay will attempt to examine at least some of them, but, for now, let\u2019s say that the most obvious aspect in which TV Sansa was shorthanded is her screen time. In \u201cA Clash of Kings\u201d, the book that was the basis for the Season 2 of GoT, Sansa\u2019s POV chapters, along with Tyrion\u2019s, are the only ones that depict what\u2019s happening in King\u2019s Landing, the capital of The Seven Kingdoms and the center of political power in the story. This goes for the first two thirds of \u201cA Storm of Swords\u201d as well, e.g. until the moment Sansa escapes from King\u2019s Landing. In short, her chapters couldn\u2019t help but be of paramount importance in the narrative sense. In the show, however, Sansa\u2019s significance is greatly decreased, and not only because the show doesn\u2019t follow the \u201cPOV structure\u201d of the novels, but because she\u2019s reduced to nothing but a prized captive for the Lannisters.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Yes, TV Sansa is a minor, and she\u2019s played by a minor, named Sophie Turner. Her age, due to the laws that forbid the usage of underage children in explicit sex scenes, prevented D&amp;D from using Sansa in a way they adore. And her age couldn\u2019t be drastically changed without drastic consequences on her overall arc which is, in ACOK at least, built around her first period. That\u2019s why, for example, D&amp;D couldn\u2019t cast Natalie Dormer \u2013 one of their favorite ASOIAF characters, by the way, because they did alter Margaery to suit the actress, instead of the other way around \u2013 in the role of Sansa, because Dormer, while certainly looking younger than she is, could never pass as a minor.</p><p>And that would probably be the only thing that makes Sansa off-limits for Natalie Dormer, or some other actress D&amp;D adore, to play her in D&amp;D\u2019s adaptation. Everything else would\u2019ve been doable. Had George R. R. Martin not put her first period in the books, Sansa\u2019s age, promiscuity, vocabulary, even wardrobe, would\u2019ve been changed accordingly to suit D&amp;D\u2019s vision of a progressive Westerosi woman, which means the first three would\u2019ve been amplified, while the fourth one \u2013 wardrobe \u2013 would definitely be reduced and freed from all the unnecessary parts. She\u2019d probably even hook up with some rogue brute at some point; when she\u2019d find the time for him, that is; after she\u2019s done with Joff, Tyrion, Lancel, and god knows who else, she\u2019d certainly figure out cynical killers can occupy her bed just as good as other available men can.</p><p>Speaking of cynical killers \u2013 enter Sandor Clegane. One more character that, alas, couldn\u2019t be played by Natalie Dormer, and therefore not of particular interest to D&amp;D. Sandor in the novels is a truly memorable fellow, who slowly but steadily grows in readers\u2019 eyes as the story progresses. At the beginning, he\u2019s nothing more than a merciless brute used only for killing people Lannisters want dead. Very soon, however, a reader finds out there might be some traces of soul under that rough surface. More and more we find out about Sandor, more and more intriguing and understandable he gets. Even \u2013 more likable.</p><p>Now, what makes him likable? The stories Littlefinger tells to Sansa?! Of course not. The stories Sandor himself keeps telling to Sansa are what fleshes him to the extent that was probably impossible to predict at the beginning of the series. Through his conversations with Sansa, we find out every important thing there is to know about him. Later on, when he hangs up with Arya, Sandor is already a fully developed character, whom we aren\u2019t discovering any more, but rather following. And he became like that precisely through his exchanges with Sansa.</p><p>The show went the other way, and a pretty odd way, at that. D&amp;D decided it was better for Littlefinger to deliver the story of how Sandor\u2019s face got burned, and that decision carries some very serious consequences in regards to characterization. For example, Littlefinger appears as someone who does know the secrets of King\u2019s Landing, but, at the same time, as someone who doesn\u2019t hesitate to share those secrets with persons he doesn\u2019t have any control over. Yes, he warns Sansa not to tell anyone about the story; but, he warns her because, and here comes the funny part \u2013 Sandor is going to kill her.</p><p>Now, why isn\u2019t Littlefinger afraid Sandor\u2019s going to kill him? After all, isn\u2019t that the logical question because it\u2019s Littlefinger who offers Sandor\u2019s secrets to others? It seems there are only two possible answers: 1) Sandor is not that scary and dangerous as Littlefinger claims, or 2) Sandor is a dangerous fellow, but Littlefinger is the bravest individual alive, because he goes around telling the secrets of people that physically can literally eat him for breakfast; and he isn\u2019t shy even, because he doesn\u2019t fail to warn Sansa how dangerous is the situation he himself dares so boldly.</p><p>Whatever conclusion a viewer draws from there, something is going to be radically changed from the source material. Quite possibly, in fact, a lot of things are going to be altered. After the said scene, both Littlefinger and Sandor are drastically different than their book origins. And the characters we ended up with in the show, are not nearly as complex and intriguing as their book counterparts. This is especially true for Sandor, who\u2019s nothing if not scary and dangerous. He is supposed to frighten the living hell out of everyone who isn\u2019t his older brother. If you take that away from Sandor, you\u2019re only left with his tender side.</p><p>But, even his tender side was almost entirely removed from the show. This time, not only by Littlefinger, but also by Tyrion: in the throne room, when Joff orders Kingsguards to undress Sansa, Sandor stands there silently. His face exp<b></b>ression suggests he isn\u2019t pleased with what he sees, but that\u2019s it. He doesn\u2019t stand up to his king with firm \u201cThat\u2019s enough\u201d as in the book. It is therefore on Tyrion exclusively to deny Joffrey the pleasure of torturing the girl whose only crime was that she saw him in a moment of unflattering weakness. As in the books, TV Tyrion enters the room with his sellsword and he defends Sansa from Joff, but the important difference is that in the show it looks like Tyrion is the only one both willing to oppose Joffrey and capable of doing it. In the novel, we can sense that Sandor is ready to do the same thing, only, in his case, it comes with a much bigger risk, which is not without importance.</p><p>So, in this particular case, Sandor was sacrificed for the sake of TV Tyrion. TV Littlefinger, however, wasn\u2019t forgotten in that regard, because, once again, he\u2019s fed with lines that originally belong to Sandor. In the finale of the second season, it is Littlefinger who tells Sansa to look around and see how much better than her all those liars are. Just as the last time around, this change serves neither Littlefinger nor Sandor: the former\u2019s creepy-mentoring side is exposed much earlier than it would be logical, while the latter is robbed of yet another moment in which he shows how much he cares for Sansa and how protective he is toward her.</p><p>Sansa is a case on its own, as far as wrong adaptations are concerned. She\u2019s in the league with her mother Catelyn Stark, as two Stark women that were literally butchered in the show. The thing two of them have in common is the nature of their complexity: opposite to other female characters in ASOIAF, like Dany or Arya or Asha or Brienne or Cersei, Cat and Sansa aren\u2019t interested in hurting their enemies with their own hands, or, in the case of Dany, with her own dragons (this goes for Cersei, too, even though she\u2019s the one ordering the suffering of others, not committing it: her aggression is always personal, as we can sense in the first three novels). And, what\u2019s more, Sansa isn\u2019t interested in hurting anyone, actually. Cat does have an aggressive side in her; it\u2019s female aggression all the way, but aggression it is. Sansa, on the other hand, almost never desires other people to suffer in any way. There\u2019s only one noticeable exception: Joffrey. She does think on one or two occasions how nice it would be if Robb put a sword in Joff, and, by extension, she wishes Lannisters are defeated in the war against her family. However, we have to consider the situation she finds herself in at those moments \u2013 imprisoned by the Lannisters and at Joff\u2019s 'mercy\u2019 all the time; small miracle she wishes them ill. I\u2019ve never been a girl arrested by the grave enemies of my family, but if I was, I\u2019d definitely pray for their most horrible deaths every single night. And, we have to remember that, after Joff\u2019s death, she fails to feel happy over it, even though she tries to a little.</p><p>Therefore, it maybe isn\u2019t a stretch to say Sansa is probably the one character that is most unlike the author himself. Other major characters, especially POV ones, do resemble Martin at least partially. For males, it\u2019s obvious: even though GRRM never fought in a war, nor had any military training whatsoever, men are men; even in our day and age, no male is a complete stranger to war; while depicting all those dramatic battles and duels was quite an achievement (which no personal experience would make any easier, truth be told, because in ASOIAF the combat as a phenomenon is illustrated from any number of angles, each among them presented with an abundance of details), ultimately it was in himself where Martin could find a lot of answers about his male characters, whose position in a society is never independent from their combat prowess or lack of it. Female characters, on the other hand, had to be trickier, just like they always are for male authors \u2013 let\u2019s admit it, they are not that good in creating great females, just like women writers usually don\u2019t produce male characters that are a match to their female characters nor to the male heroes created by male authors. In our day and age, these \u201cgender rules\u201d are rarely spoken of, but they continue to exist, due to gender predispositions that are nowhere as strong as in the mind of an individual. There are exceptions, as in good male characters created by women and vice versa, but they are in a clear minority compared to underdeveloped or unrealistic characters whose only \u201cfault\u201d was that they didn\u2019t share the sex with an author. And in that regard, ASOIAF could very well be unparalleled: it is perhaps impossible to find any other story that features nearly as many memorable male and female characters both, as ASOIAF does (truth be told, that fact alone should be enough to inspire analysts and scholars to look at ASOIAF at a different, more demanding light, and not as a genre piece).</p><p>Martin\u2019s girls, however, aren\u2019t completely unlike the man who came up with them. Most of them are willingly participating in \u201cmen games\u201d, e.g. power-plays and/or wars, which makes for a precious connection to a male mindset of the author. They are thinking and behaving as women (or, in the case of Arya, and Dany to an extent, as girls), but all of them are interacting with something that, in all its glory and misery, can roughly be called \u201ca man\u2019s world\u201d. Some of the most beautifully written chapters in the series are delivered from female POVs \u2013 The Red Wedding and Cersei\u2019s \u201cWalk of Shame\u201d come to mind right away; but, in a thematic sense, those and other female chapters don\u2019t differ too much from male POVs.</p><p>Except for Sansa\u2019s chapters, which unmistakably belong to something we can roughly call \u201ca woman\u2019s world\u201d. Chapters of both male and female POVs in ASOIAF are often rich with testosterone, but Sansa\u2019s ones are almost entirely driven by estrogen: look no further than her captivity in King\u2019s Landing, that actually is, as already said, focused around her first period \u2013 that decision solely should bring a lot of respect for Martin, because he had to know going that road is never easy for a male writer.</p><p>And the funniest thing is, it all fits. Sansa\u2019s storyline is distinctive in tone, but not odd. It is a legitimate part of the general plot of ASOIAF. In fact, as her story progresses, Sansa becomes more and more important for The Game, even though she showed no clear inclination to participate in it so far, but at the same time, Martin keeps Sansa away from all those \u201cmale\u201d aspects he decorated other female characters of his saga.</p><p>And on top of everything, we\u2019re presented with her love story, a romance with no other than the man who, prior to discovering some delicate feelings for Sansa, could pose for an ideal brute of Westeros. At the beginning of the story, Sandor Clegane could be perceived as the exact opposite of Sansa. As someone who has no business whatsoever in her world, just like she has none in his. But, with some craft wording and master subtlety, Martin succeeds in illustrating the flood of emotions that go both ways in their relationship. Those emotions are never easy, nor appropriate, let alone allowed \u2013 even by Sansa and Sandor themselves! \u2013 but they\u2019re hard to be denied.</p><p>The complexity of their multilayered characters, of their respective positions in a society and in an ongoing war, and of their relationship that resists all known clich\u00e9s, represent some of the strongest evidence that ASOIAF is much more than a genre piece. There\u2019s a lot in these novels that escapes genre boundaries, but nothing more evidently than SanSan. Stuff like that is not your usual fantasy element, no matter how flattering fantasy can be as a label (Homer, Shakespeare, Tolkien \u2013 to name just a few all-time greats that created unforgettable stories with supernatural aspects in them). Any author who comes up with that kind of love story involving those kind of characters \u2013 and with a legion of other characters, and with no less than four different religions, and with themes of honor, redemption, identity, bravery, equality, ancestry, legacy, freedom, revolution\u2026 \u2013 deserves to be analyzed not as a genre writer.</p><p>Now, one can only imagine what kind of enigma Sansa and Sandor were for Benioff and Weiss. And it pretty much remained unsolved, because, when faced with all the complexity of these two characters, Benioff and Weiss decided to remove it almost entirely, along with their relationship that is reduced to occasional and odd mentioning of 'little bird\u2019. TV Sandor was simplified to a one-note brute that goes around TV Westeros and lectures people about the pleasures of killing, a one-note brute he never was in the novels, not even in the beginning of the saga. TV Sansa, on the other hand, was denied her book complexity by shutting down all her layers, one by one. For example, Benioff and Weiss completely removed her decision to go behind her father\u2019s back and inform Cersei of his plan. They simply refused to go down that road. They did something similar to Catelyn, whose infamous line to Jon they didn\u2019t remove entirely, but did replace it with a much softer one. It is pretty safe to assume that Cat\u2019s and Sansa\u2019s complexity did bother Benioff and Weiss from the get-go.</p><p>What\u2019s also removed from the show is Sansa\u2019s agency, primarily represented in the novels by her secret meetings with Dontos, a disgraced knight she herself saved from Joffrey. In the show, we got only the saving scene; it was filmed and executed clumsily, but it was there at least. However, until recently, nobody could be sure Sansa did save Dontos, because the man disappeared afterwards (he was briefly seen as joggling balls in \u201cBlackwater\u201d episode, in the scene in Cersei\u2019s chambers, but he was unrecognizable for the vast majority of audience). It is reported, though, that Dontos will be returning in Season 4, so yes, Sansa did save his life after all. But, even when he returns, Sansa\u2019s attempts at escaping will be two seasons younger than they should\u2019ve been at that point, and it\u2019s hard to see a way D&amp;D can remedy that neglect.</p><p>Show-lovers often defend D&amp;D in regards to Sansa, by saying her personality is a difficult and tricky one for portraying on screen, because even in the books she\u2019s introverted. Now, maybe she isn\u2019t the most extroverted character ever, but she\u2019s pretty far from reclusive, as she does communicate with the outside world a lot at the beginning of the series, before she\u2019s imprisoned. And even while in captivity, she can\u2019t help but communicate with Sandor and Dontos. What\u2019s more, around two of them she is her true self, which provides a wide array of possibilities for a good and informative dialogue that, in an adaptation, could compensate for the lack of inner thoughts. With Dontos, she\u2019s open not only because she saved him, but also because he explicitly offers his help (and, truth be told, it is he who enabled her to leave King\u2019s Landing eventually, so, even though he wasn\u2019t exactly honest with her concerning his motivations, her trust wasn\u2019t as misplaced as it may seem at first). And with Sandor, she\u2019s open for no particular reason \u2013 other than those subtle, emotional forces, that both of them can\u2019t help but follow and eventually become the closest and most intimate beings to each other.</p><p>The way Martin incepted and developed the barely visible, but undeniable romance, between Sansa and Sandor, is nothing short of literary brilliance. With so few words and interactions, he managed so much. The vast majority of readers are aware of restrained attraction they mutually feel, even though they didn\u2019t share a single physical aspect of the romantic relationship.</p><p>Martin is indeed a master of subtlety, as evidenced by what looks like the endless amount of carefully hidden clues that point to any number of narrative puzzles, realization of which do make an entire story much richer than if taken at face value. And he\u2019s never more subtle than with two romances: Rhaegar/Lyanna and Sandor/Sansa. Now, the respective nature of subtlety of those two romances is rather different. With Rhaegar and Lyanna, a reader is \u2013 through Robert\u2019s retelling \u2013 offered a version that is actually the very opposite of what probably happened, and only later a reader can pick up clues here and there, and finally figure out the story of a fatal attraction between the two. But, the clues are presented throughout the text, so much that, even if you don\u2019t decipher everything after the first read, at the end of \u201cA Game of Thrones\u201d \u2013 the first book of the series \u2013 you\u2019ll probably sense that Robert\u2019s view on events wasn\u2019t exactly accurate.</p><p>The story of Sansa and Sandor is a very different one. Their relationship is never as much as addressed, even by themselves. Sandor isn\u2019t a POV character, and he\u2019s not exactly open to people, so his silence on the matter isn\u2019t unexpected. But, Martin didn\u2019t address their romance even in Sansa\u2019s chapters, which are typically packed with inner thoughts of the POV character. It looks like Martin decided to do it the harder way and make their romance somewhat a mystery even for Sansa, which, in hindsight, does seem to be the most logical way: what teenage girl would be fully aware of a romance that \u201cinappropriate\u201d, and experienced in those dire circumstances?! As a result of that decision, the readers got a completely fascinating depiction of a romance, that can be described as a train you hear from miles away: at first, you can\u2019t even tell is it a train or some similar sound, but slowly, with every second, you\u2019re more and more certain that your ears didn\u2019t trick you, and very soon the train is so loud that it is the only thing you can hear at all. In the novels, a reader may find something strange at first, when Sandor shares the secret of his burned face with Sansa. Some alarm may be turned on deep inside. And it becomes more apparent each time two of them share a page, with a culmination during the Battle of the Blackwater Bay, when Sandor, after he decides to desert the Lannisters, visits Sansa in her room and offers to take her home to Winterfell.</p><p>It might be the only instance in the entire series where Sandor did ask anyone\u2019s approval, which does speak volumes about his feelings for Sansa. Considering the manner in which Martin described this romance, Sandor\u2019s actions on that day was as good as a confession of his deep attraction to her. Sansa, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t have a single moment which could be pointed at as a prime evidence of her undeniable love for The Hound, but this doesn\u2019t mean her feelings toward Sandor aren\u2019t palpable. It\u2019s one more mastery of the writer: through her frequent (and skewed, but in a telling way) memories on the last time she saw Sandor, he was able to show her feelings resonating more and more inside her.</p><p>In the show, Martin was denied a chance to do the same thing, even though he wrote the \u201cBlackwater\u201d episode in Season 2. Thanks to the already destroyed storyline, and to god knows how many changes, and to D&amp;D\u2019s decision to remove from the final cut some scenes Martin referred to with his scenes, the one between Sansa and Sandor near the end of that episode, served more as a greeting to book-fans who like SanSan in the source material, than as a goodbye between two not unlike souls who shared much, and could have shared a lot more, and maybe are going to if they meet again. In that scene, Rory McCann was visibly better than usual as Sandor, and Sophie Turner was as good as usual, but, just like with anything ASOIAF, the scene doesn\u2019t have nearly the same impact and importance if taken out of context.</p><p>The exact context of their SanSan is yet to be fully revealed in the books, too. Because of the already mentioned subtlety \u2013 a quality that seems to intimidate showrunners Benioff and Weiss, who, in their turn, do retaliate with their on-screen war on subtlety (just recall what they turned other romances into; for example, the romance between TV Jon \u201cNot The Brightest Kid In The Block\u201d Snow and TV \u201cI Know Everything And Therefore I Can\u2019t Stop Talking\u201d Ygritte) \u2013 Sansa\u2019s and Sandor\u2019s love story is by no means an open book. Their romance has its own share of mystery, one of which may be: what inspired those two persons to feel so strongly for each other? Personally, I always thought their mutual attraction isn\u2019t only based on a \u201cbeauty and the beast\u201d model. There is that, but in their case it goes deeper. If that was the engine behind his emotions, Sandor had more than enough opportunities to find a beauty for his beast long before Sansa entered his life. With Sansa, I\u2019d say their mutual attraction is rooted in their personalities. For example, if you take away Sandor\u2019s aggression, he also isn\u2019t interested in hurting others. He\u2019s naturally talented for violence, and he lives in a society that respects that kind of talent, and that is why he\u2019s violent for a living, but at the end of the day, the suffering of others isn\u2019t any kind of reward for him. Possibly, because he isn\u2019t interested in other people that much. Though, when he is interested in someone, the interest is as strong as they come.</p><p>(We don\u2019t know at this point, but it\u2019s not a stretch to imagine that his reaction to the news that his hated brother was killed wasn\u2019t unlike Sansa\u2019s reaction to Joff\u2019s death. \u201cAm I glad he\u2019s dead? Well, not exactly, even though I wanted him killed.\u201d)</p><p>Sansa may very well be like that, too. That would be one of the possible explanations of her AGOT actions. Like the rest of the Starks, Sansa is a complex character that has some issues of her own, without which neither she nor the other Starks would be such memorable characters as they obviously are; it is the fact that they are both willing and strong enough to fight those issues, that Starks stand out for. Without going into details (as if I could!), I expect that in the remaining novels Sansa is going to face the reasons that made her go to Cersei that damned night and with the consequences of that action. And whatever comes out of that soul-searching will be inevitably combined with her claim to Winterfell that Littlefinger brought up in AFFC. And that combination is going to elevate Sansa\u2019s arc to even bigger and more important levels than so far, even though so far she was the one Stark that was most engaged \u2013 unwittingly, but still \u2013 in the bloody dynastic war for the Iron Throne.</p><p>And she\u2019ll have to cross paths with Sandor Clegane, one way or another. Their relationship was so meticulously built up, it simply has to get some sort of a closure. What that closure is going to be is impossible to predict, because we are talking of one George R. R. Martin, a writer who managed to shock us as he pleased more than a few times.</p><p>What is also impossible, is to take anything that did or didn\u2019t happen in the show as any indication at what the closer may or may not be. There isn\u2019t a storyline in GoT that wasn\u2019t drastically changed, and weakened in the process, but Sansa\u2019s arc, along with her relationship with Sandor, is among the biggest victims of D&amp;D\u2019s inability to adapt.</p><p>Whether you happen to like what Benioff and Weiss put in the show, or don\u2019t, you\u2019d be advised not to recognize any significance in their decisions for further developments in ASOIAF. Just like show-lovers tend to remind everyone else, GoT and ASOIAF are two entirely separate beasts. And book Sansa and book Sandor, along with everything Martin has in his store for them, can be really glad about it.</p>",

Their rendition of Melisandre, for example, isn\u2019t an intimidating and imposing practitioner of dark and supernatural powers, but rather a seductress who\u2019s able to make people obey her only if she rewards them with sex (Stannis, Gendry) or gold (Brotherhood without Banners). One more example would be their rendition of Margaery Tyrell, who was turned from a teenage girl with a perfect facade and somewhat mysterious foundation, into a promiscuous lady willing to do anything \u2013 even have sex with both her brother and her husband simultaneously, as she proposes to the latter in Season 2 \u2013 in order to achieve her personal political ambitions that are literally limitless.</p><p>With that in mind, Sansa Stark never had a chance to be properly adapted in the show created by D&amp;D. Now, the word \u2018properly\u2019 has a rather wide range of possible meanings, and this essay will attempt to examine at least some of them, but, for now, let\u2019s say that the most obvious aspect in which TV Sansa was shorthanded is her screen time. In \u201cA Clash of Kings\u201d, the book that was the basis for the Season 2 of GoT, Sansa\u2019s POV chapters, along with Tyrion\u2019s, are the only ones that depict what\u2019s happening in King\u2019s Landing, the capital of The Seven Kingdoms and the center of political power in the story. This goes for the first two thirds of \u201cA Storm of Swords\u201d as well, e.g. until the moment Sansa escapes from King\u2019s Landing. In short, her chapters couldn\u2019t help but be of paramount importance in the narrative sense. In the show, however, Sansa\u2019s significance is greatly decreased, and not only because the show doesn\u2019t follow the \u201cPOV structure\u201d of the novels, but because she\u2019s reduced to nothing but a prized captive for the Lannisters.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Yes, TV Sansa is a minor, and she\u2019s played by a minor, named Sophie Turner. Her age, due to the laws that forbid the usage of underage children in explicit sex scenes, prevented D&amp;D from using Sansa in a way they adore. And her age couldn\u2019t be drastically changed without drastic consequences on her overall arc which is, in ACOK at least, built around her first period. That\u2019s why, for example, D&amp;D couldn\u2019t cast Natalie Dormer \u2013 one of their favorite ASOIAF characters, by the way, because they did alter Margaery to suit the actress, instead of the other way around \u2013 in the role of Sansa, because Dormer, while certainly looking younger than she is, could never pass as a minor.</p><p>And that would probably be the only thing that makes Sansa off-limits for Natalie Dormer, or some other actress D&amp;D adore, to play her in D&amp;D\u2019s adaptation. Everything else would\u2019ve been doable. Had George R. R. Martin not put her first period in the books, Sansa\u2019s age, promiscuity, vocabulary, even wardrobe, would\u2019ve been changed accordingly to suit D&amp;D\u2019s vision of a progressive Westerosi woman, which means the first three would\u2019ve been amplified, while the fourth one \u2013 wardrobe \u2013 would definitely be reduced and freed from all the unnecessary parts. She\u2019d probably even hook up with some rogue brute at some point; when she\u2019d find the time for him, that is; after she\u2019s done with Joff, Tyrion, Lancel, and god knows who else, she\u2019d certainly figure out cynical killers can occupy her bed just as good as other available men can.</p><p>Speaking of cynical killers \u2013 enter Sandor Clegane. One more character that, alas, couldn\u2019t be played by Natalie Dormer, and therefore not of particular interest to D&amp;D. Sandor in the novels is a truly memorable fellow, who slowly but steadily grows in readers\u2019 eyes as the story progresses. At the beginning, he\u2019s nothing more than a merciless brute used only for killing people Lannisters want dead. Very soon, however, a reader finds out there might be some traces of soul under that rough surface. More and more we find out about Sandor, more and more intriguing and understandable he gets. Even \u2013 more likable.</p><p>Now, what makes him likable? The stories Littlefinger tells to Sansa?! Of course not. The stories Sandor himself keeps telling to Sansa are what fleshes him to the extent that was probably impossible to predict at the beginning of the series. Through his conversations with Sansa, we find out every important thing there is to know about him. Later on, when he hangs up with Arya, Sandor is already a fully developed character, whom we aren\u2019t discovering any more, but rather following. And he became like that precisely through his exchanges with Sansa.</p><p>The show went the other way, and a pretty odd way, at that. D&amp;D decided it was better for Littlefinger to deliver the story of how Sandor\u2019s face got burned, and that decision carries some very serious consequences in regards to characterization. For example, Littlefinger appears as someone who does know the secrets of King\u2019s Landing, but, at the same time, as someone who doesn\u2019t hesitate to share those secrets with persons he doesn\u2019t have any control over. Yes, he warns Sansa not to tell anyone about the story; but, he warns her because, and here comes the funny part \u2013 Sandor is going to kill her.</p><p>Now, why isn\u2019t Littlefinger afraid Sandor\u2019s going to kill him? After all, isn\u2019t that the logical question because it\u2019s Littlefinger who offers Sandor\u2019s secrets to others? It seems there are only two possible answers: 1) Sandor is not that scary and dangerous as Littlefinger claims, or 2) Sandor is a dangerous fellow, but Littlefinger is the bravest individual alive, because he goes around telling the secrets of people that physically can literally eat him for breakfast; and he isn\u2019t shy even, because he doesn\u2019t fail to warn Sansa how dangerous is the situation he himself dares so boldly.</p><p>Whatever conclusion a viewer draws from there, something is going to be radically changed from the source material. Quite possibly, in fact, a lot of things are going to be altered. After the said scene, both Littlefinger and Sandor are drastically different than their book origins. And the characters we ended up with in the show, are not nearly as complex and intriguing as their book counterparts. This is especially true for Sandor, who\u2019s nothing if not scary and dangerous. He is supposed to frighten the living hell out of everyone who isn\u2019t his older brother. If you take that away from Sandor, you\u2019re only left with his tender side.</p><p>But, even his tender side was almost entirely removed from the show. This time, not only by Littlefinger, but also by Tyrion: in the throne room, when Joff orders Kingsguards to undress Sansa, Sandor stands there silently. His face exp<b></b>ression suggests he isn\u2019t pleased with what he sees, but that\u2019s it. He doesn\u2019t stand up to his king with firm \u201cThat\u2019s enough\u201d as in the book. It is therefore on Tyrion exclusively to deny Joffrey the pleasure of torturing the girl whose only crime was that she saw him in a moment of unflattering weakness. As in the books, TV Tyrion enters the room with his sellsword and he defends Sansa from Joff, but the important difference is that in the show it looks like Tyrion is the only one both willing to oppose Joffrey and capable of doing it. In the novel, we can sense that Sandor is ready to do the same thing, only, in his case, it comes with a much bigger risk, which is not without importance.</p><p>So, in this particular case, Sandor was sacrificed for the sake of TV Tyrion. TV Littlefinger, however, wasn\u2019t forgotten in that regard, because, once again, he\u2019s fed with lines that originally belong to Sandor. In the finale of the second season, it is Littlefinger who tells Sansa to look around and see how much better than her all those liars are. Just as the last time around, this change serves neither Littlefinger nor Sandor: the former\u2019s creepy-mentoring side is exposed much earlier than it would be logical, while the latter is robbed of yet another moment in which he shows how much he cares for Sansa and how protective he is toward her.</p><p>Sansa is a case on its own, as far as wrong adaptations are concerned. She\u2019s in the league with her mother Catelyn Stark, as two Stark women that were literally butchered in the show. The thing two of them have in common is the nature of their complexity: opposite to other female characters in ASOIAF, like Dany or Arya or Asha or Brienne or Cersei, Cat and Sansa aren\u2019t interested in hurting their enemies with their own hands, or, in the case of Dany, with her own dragons (this goes for Cersei, too, even though she\u2019s the one ordering the suffering of others, not committing it: her aggression is always personal, as we can sense in the first three novels). And, what\u2019s more, Sansa isn\u2019t interested in hurting anyone, actually. Cat does have an aggressive side in her; it\u2019s female aggression all the way, but aggression it is. Sansa, on the other hand, almost never desires other people to suffer in any way. There\u2019s only one noticeable exception: Joffrey. She does think on one or two occasions how nice it would be if Robb put a sword in Joff, and, by extension, she wishes Lannisters are defeated in the war against her family. However, we have to consider the situation she finds herself in at those moments \u2013 imprisoned by the Lannisters and at Joff\u2019s 'mercy\u2019 all the time; small miracle she wishes them ill. I\u2019ve never been a girl arrested by the grave enemies of my family, but if I was, I\u2019d definitely pray for their most horrible deaths every single night. And, we have to remember that, after Joff\u2019s death, she fails to feel happy over it, even though she tries to a little.</p><p>Therefore, it maybe isn\u2019t a stretch to say Sansa is probably the one character that is most unlike the author himself. Other major characters, especially POV ones, do resemble Martin at least partially. For males, it\u2019s obvious: even though GRRM never fought in a war, nor had any military training whatsoever, men are men; even in our day and age, no male is a complete stranger to war; while depicting all those dramatic battles and duels was quite an achievement (which no personal experience would make any easier, truth be told, because in ASOIAF the combat as a phenomenon is illustrated from any number of angles, each among them presented with an abundance of details), ultimately it was in himself where Martin could find a lot of answers about his male characters, whose position in a society is never independent from their combat prowess or lack of it. Female characters, on the other hand, had to be trickier, just like they always are for male authors \u2013 let\u2019s admit it, they are not that good in creating great females, just like women writers usually don\u2019t produce male characters that are a match to their female characters nor to the male heroes created by male authors. In our day and age, these \u201cgender rules\u201d are rarely spoken of, but they continue to exist, due to gender predispositions that are nowhere as strong as in the mind of an individual. There are exceptions, as in good male characters created by women and vice versa, but they are in a clear minority compared to underdeveloped or unrealistic characters whose only \u201cfault\u201d was that they didn\u2019t share the sex with an author. And in that regard, ASOIAF could very well be unparalleled: it is perhaps impossible to find any other story that features nearly as many memorable male and female characters both, as ASOIAF does (truth be told, that fact alone should be enough to inspire analysts and scholars to look at ASOIAF at a different, more demanding light, and not as a genre piece).</p><p>Martin\u2019s girls, however, aren\u2019t completely unlike the man who came up with them. Most of them are willingly participating in \u201cmen games\u201d, e.g. power-plays and/or wars, which makes for a precious connection to a male mindset of the author. They are thinking and behaving as women (or, in the case of Arya, and Dany to an extent, as girls), but all of them are interacting with something that, in all its glory and misery, can roughly be called \u201ca man\u2019s world\u201d. Some of the most beautifully written chapters in the series are delivered from female POVs \u2013 The Red Wedding and Cersei\u2019s \u201cWalk of Shame\u201d come to mind right away; but, in a thematic sense, those and other female chapters don\u2019t differ too much from male POVs.</p><p>Except for Sansa\u2019s chapters, which unmistakably belong to something we can roughly call \u201ca woman\u2019s world\u201d. Chapters of both male and female POVs in ASOIAF are often rich with testosterone, but Sansa\u2019s ones are almost entirely driven by estrogen: look no further than her captivity in King\u2019s Landing, that actually is, as already said, focused around her first period \u2013 that decision solely should bring a lot of respect for Martin, because he had to know going that road is never easy for a male writer.</p><p>And the funniest thing is, it all fits. Sansa\u2019s storyline is distinctive in tone, but not odd. It is a legitimate part of the general plot of ASOIAF. In fact, as her story progresses, Sansa becomes more and more important for The Game, even though she showed no clear inclination to participate in it so far, but at the same time, Martin keeps Sansa away from all those \u201cmale\u201d aspects he decorated other female characters of his saga.</p><p>And on top of everything, we\u2019re presented with her love story, a romance with no other than the man who, prior to discovering some delicate feelings for Sansa, could pose for an ideal brute of Westeros. At the beginning of the story, Sandor Clegane could be perceived as the exact opposite of Sansa. As someone who has no business whatsoever in her world, just like she has none in his. But, with some craft wording and master subtlety, Martin succeeds in illustrating the flood of emotions that go both ways in their relationship. Those emotions are never easy, nor appropriate, let alone allowed \u2013 even by Sansa and Sandor themselves! \u2013 but they\u2019re hard to be denied.</p><p>The complexity of their multilayered characters, of their respective positions in a society and in an ongoing war, and of their relationship that resists all known clich\u00e9s, represent some of the strongest evidence that ASOIAF is much more than a genre piece. There\u2019s a lot in these novels that escapes genre boundaries, but nothing more evidently than SanSan. Stuff like that is not your usual fantasy element, no matter how flattering fantasy can be as a label (Homer, Shakespeare, Tolkien \u2013 to name just a few all-time greats that created unforgettable stories with supernatural aspects in them). Any author who comes up with that kind of love story involving those kind of characters \u2013 and with a legion of other characters, and with no less than four different religions, and with themes of honor, redemption, identity, bravery, equality, ancestry, legacy, freedom, revolution\u2026 \u2013 deserves to be analyzed not as a genre writer.</p><p>Now, one can only imagine what kind of enigma Sansa and Sandor were for Benioff and Weiss. And it pretty much remained unsolved, because, when faced with all the complexity of these two characters, Benioff and Weiss decided to remove it almost entirely, along with their relationship that is reduced to occasional and odd mentioning of 'little bird\u2019. TV Sandor was simplified to a one-note brute that goes around TV Westeros and lectures people about the pleasures of killing, a one-note brute he never was in the novels, not even in the beginning of the saga. TV Sansa, on the other hand, was denied her book complexity by shutting down all her layers, one by one. For example, Benioff and Weiss completely removed her decision to go behind her father\u2019s back and inform Cersei of his plan. They simply refused to go down that road. They did something similar to Catelyn, whose infamous line to Jon they didn\u2019t remove entirely, but did replace it with a much softer one. It is pretty safe to assume that Cat\u2019s and Sansa\u2019s complexity did bother Benioff and Weiss from the get-go.</p><p>What\u2019s also removed from the show is Sansa\u2019s agency, primarily represented in the novels by her secret meetings with Dontos, a disgraced knight she herself saved from Joffrey. In the show, we got only the saving scene; it was filmed and executed clumsily, but it was there at least. However, until recently, nobody could be sure Sansa did save Dontos, because the man disappeared afterwards (he was briefly seen as joggling balls in \u201cBlackwater\u201d episode, in the scene in Cersei\u2019s chambers, but he was unrecognizable for the vast majority of audience). It is reported, though, that Dontos will be returning in Season 4, so yes, Sansa did save his life after all. But, even when he returns, Sansa\u2019s attempts at escaping will be two seasons younger than they should\u2019ve been at that point, and it\u2019s hard to see a way D&amp;D can remedy that neglect.</p><p>Show-lovers often defend D&amp;D in regards to Sansa, by saying her personality is a difficult and tricky one for portraying on screen, because even in the books she\u2019s introverted. Now, maybe she isn\u2019t the most extroverted character ever, but she\u2019s pretty far from reclusive, as she does communicate with the outside world a lot at the beginning of the series, before she\u2019s imprisoned. And even while in captivity, she can\u2019t help but communicate with Sandor and Dontos. What\u2019s more, around two of them she is her true self, which provides a wide array of possibilities for a good and informative dialogue that, in an adaptation, could compensate for the lack of inner thoughts. With Dontos, she\u2019s open not only because she saved him, but also because he explicitly offers his help (and, truth be told, it is he who enabled her to leave King\u2019s Landing eventually, so, even though he wasn\u2019t exactly honest with her concerning his motivations, her trust wasn\u2019t as misplaced as it may seem at first). And with Sandor, she\u2019s open for no particular reason \u2013 other than those subtle, emotional forces, that both of them can\u2019t help but follow and eventually become the closest and most intimate beings to each other.</p><p>The way Martin incepted and developed the barely visible, but undeniable romance, between Sansa and Sandor, is nothing short of literary brilliance. With so few words and interactions, he managed so much. The vast majority of readers are aware of restrained attraction they mutually feel, even though they didn\u2019t share a single physical aspect of the romantic relationship.</p><p>Martin is indeed a master of subtlety, as evidenced by what looks like the endless amount of carefully hidden clues that point to any number of narrative puzzles, realization of which do make an entire story much richer than if taken at face value. And he\u2019s never more subtle than with two romances: Rhaegar/Lyanna and Sandor/Sansa. Now, the respective nature of subtlety of those two romances is rather different. With Rhaegar and Lyanna, a reader is \u2013 through Robert\u2019s retelling \u2013 offered a version that is actually the very opposite of what probably happened, and only later a reader can pick up clues here and there, and finally figure out the story of a fatal attraction between the two. But, the clues are presented throughout the text, so much that, even if you don\u2019t decipher everything after the first read, at the end of \u201cA Game of Thrones\u201d \u2013 the first book of the series \u2013 you\u2019ll probably sense that Robert\u2019s view on events wasn\u2019t exactly accurate.</p><p>The story of Sansa and Sandor is a very different one. Their relationship is never as much as addressed, even by themselves. Sandor isn\u2019t a POV character, and he\u2019s not exactly open to people, so his silence on the matter isn\u2019t unexpected. But, Martin didn\u2019t address their romance even in Sansa\u2019s chapters, which are typically packed with inner thoughts of the POV character. It looks like Martin decided to do it the harder way and make their romance somewhat a mystery even for Sansa, which, in hindsight, does seem to be the most logical way: what teenage girl would be fully aware of a romance that \u201cinappropriate\u201d, and experienced in those dire circumstances?! As a result of that decision, the readers got a completely fascinating depiction of a romance, that can be described as a train you hear from miles away: at first, you can\u2019t even tell is it a train or some similar sound, but slowly, with every second, you\u2019re more and more certain that your ears didn\u2019t trick you, and very soon the train is so loud that it is the only thing you can hear at all. In the novels, a reader may find something strange at first, when Sandor shares the secret of his burned face with Sansa. Some alarm may be turned on deep inside. And it becomes more apparent each time two of them share a page, with a culmination during the Battle of the Blackwater Bay, when Sandor, after he decides to desert the Lannisters, visits Sansa in her room and offers to take her home to Winterfell.</p><p>It might be the only instance in the entire series where Sandor did ask anyone\u2019s approval, which does speak volumes about his feelings for Sansa. Considering the manner in which Martin described this romance, Sandor\u2019s actions on that day was as good as a confession of his deep attraction to her. Sansa, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t have a single moment which could be pointed at as a prime evidence of her undeniable love for The Hound, but this doesn\u2019t mean her feelings toward Sandor aren\u2019t palpable. It\u2019s one more mastery of the writer: through her frequent (and skewed, but in a telling way) memories on the last time she saw Sandor, he was able to show her feelings resonating more and more inside her.</p><p>In the show, Martin was denied a chance to do the same thing, even though he wrote the \u201cBlackwater\u201d episode in Season 2. Thanks to the already destroyed storyline, and to god knows how many changes, and to D&amp;D\u2019s decision to remove from the final cut some scenes Martin referred to with his scenes, the one between Sansa and Sandor near the end of that episode, served more as a greeting to book-fans who like SanSan in the source material, than as a goodbye between two not unlike souls who shared much, and could have shared a lot more, and maybe are going to if they meet again. In that scene, Rory McCann was visibly better than usual as Sandor, and Sophie Turner was as good as usual, but, just like with anything ASOIAF, the scene doesn\u2019t have nearly the same impact and importance if taken out of context.</p><p>The exact context of their SanSan is yet to be fully revealed in the books, too. Because of the already mentioned subtlety \u2013 a quality that seems to intimidate showrunners Benioff and Weiss, who, in their turn, do retaliate with their on-screen war on subtlety (just recall what they turned other romances into; for example, the romance between TV Jon \u201cNot The Brightest Kid In The Block\u201d Snow and TV \u201cI Know Everything And Therefore I Can\u2019t Stop Talking\u201d Ygritte) \u2013 Sansa\u2019s and Sandor\u2019s love story is by no means an open book. Their romance has its own share of mystery, one of which may be: what inspired those two persons to feel so strongly for each other? Personally, I always thought their mutual attraction isn\u2019t only based on a \u201cbeauty and the beast\u201d model. There is that, but in their case it goes deeper. If that was the engine behind his emotions, Sandor had more than enough opportunities to find a beauty for his beast long before Sansa entered his life. With Sansa, I\u2019d say their mutual attraction is rooted in their personalities. For example, if you take away Sandor\u2019s aggression, he also isn\u2019t interested in hurting others. He\u2019s naturally talented for violence, and he lives in a society that respects that kind of talent, and that is why he\u2019s violent for a living, but at the end of the day, the suffering of others isn\u2019t any kind of reward for him. Possibly, because he isn\u2019t interested in other people that much. Though, when he is interested in someone, the interest is as strong as they come.</p><p>(We don\u2019t know at this point, but it\u2019s not a stretch to imagine that his reaction to the news that his hated brother was killed wasn\u2019t unlike Sansa\u2019s reaction to Joff\u2019s death. \u201cAm I glad he\u2019s dead? Well, not exactly, even though I wanted him killed.\u201d)</p><p>Sansa may very well be like that, too. That would be one of the possible explanations of her AGOT actions. Like the rest of the Starks, Sansa is a complex character that has some issues of her own, without which neither she nor the other Starks would be such memorable characters as they obviously are; it is the fact that they are both willing and strong enough to fight those issues, that Starks stand out for. Without going into details (as if I could!), I expect that in the remaining novels Sansa is going to face the reasons that made her go to Cersei that damned night and with the consequences of that action. And whatever comes out of that soul-searching will be inevitably combined with her claim to Winterfell that Littlefinger brought up in AFFC. And that combination is going to elevate Sansa\u2019s arc to even bigger and more important levels than so far, even though so far she was the one Stark that was most engaged \u2013 unwittingly, but still \u2013 in the bloody dynastic war for the Iron Throne.</p><p>And she\u2019ll have to cross paths with Sandor Clegane, one way or another. Their relationship was so meticulously built up, it simply has to get some sort of a closure. What that closure is going to be is impossible to predict, because we are talking of one George R. R. Martin, a writer who managed to shock us as he pleased more than a few times.</p><p>What is also impossible, is to take anything that did or didn\u2019t happen in the show as any indication at what the closer may or may not be. There isn\u2019t a storyline in GoT that wasn\u2019t drastically changed, and weakened in the process, but Sansa\u2019s arc, along with her relationship with Sandor, is among the biggest victims of D&amp;D\u2019s inability to adapt.</p><p>Whether you happen to like what Benioff and Weiss put in the show, or don\u2019t, you\u2019d be advised not to recognize any significance in their decisions for further developments in ASOIAF. Just like show-lovers tend to remind everyone else, GoT and ASOIAF are two entirely separate beasts. And book Sansa and book Sandor, along with everything Martin has in his store for them, can be really glad about it.</p>",
                "content": "<p>Originally posted here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/88073-from-pawn-to-player-rethinking-sansa-xx/&amp;do=findComment&amp;comment=4865409\">https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/88073-from-pawn-to-player-rethinking-sansa-xx/&amp;do=findComment&amp;comment=4865409</a></p><p>When adapting female characters from ASOIAF into the TV show &ldquo;Game of thrones&rdquo;, David Benioff and Dan Weiss aren&rsquo;t unlike Robert Baratheon: if they can&rsquo;t disrobe it, they&rsquo;re bored with it. Their rendition of Melisandre, for example, isn&rsquo;t an intimidating and imposing practitioner of dark and supernatural powers, but rather a seductress who&rsquo;s able to make people obey her only if she rewards them with sex (Stannis, Gendry) or gold (Brotherhood without Banners). One more example would be their rendition of Margaery Tyrell, who was turned from a teenage girl with a perfect facade and somewhat mysterious foundation, into a promiscuous lady willing to do anything &ndash; even have sex with both her brother and her husband simultaneously, as she proposes to the latter in Season 2 &ndash; in order to achieve her personal political ambitions that are literally limitless.</p><p>With that in mind, Sansa Stark never had a chance to be properly adapted in the show created by D&amp;D. Now, the word &lsquo;properly&rsquo; has a rather wide range of possible meanings, and this essay will attempt to examine at least some of them, but, for now, let&rsquo;s say that the most obvious aspect in which TV Sansa was shorthanded is her screen time. In &ldquo;A Clash of Kings&rdquo;, the book that was the basis for the Season 2 of GoT, Sansa&rsquo;s POV chapters, along with Tyrion&rsquo;s, are the only ones that depict what&rsquo;s happening in King&rsquo;s Landing, the capital of The Seven Kingdoms and the center of political power in the story. This goes for the first two thirds of &ldquo;A Storm of Swords&rdquo; as well, e.g. until the moment Sansa escapes from King&rsquo;s Landing. In short, her chapters couldn&rsquo;t help but be of paramount importance in the narrative sense. In the show, however, Sansa&rsquo;s significance is greatly decreased, and not only because the show doesn&rsquo;t follow the &ldquo;POV structure&rdquo; of the novels, but because she&rsquo;s reduced to nothing but a prized captive for the Lannisters.</p><p>Yes, TV Sansa is a minor, and she&rsquo;s played by a minor, named Sophie Turner. Her age, due to the laws that forbid the usage of underage children in explicit sex scenes, prevented D&amp;D from using Sansa in a way they adore. And her age couldn&rsquo;t be drastically changed without drastic consequences on her overall arc which is, in ACOK at least, built around her first period. That&rsquo;s why, for example, D&amp;D couldn&rsquo;t cast Natalie Dormer &ndash; one of their favorite ASOIAF characters, by the way, because they did alter Margaery to suit the actress, instead of the other way around &ndash; in the role of Sansa, because Dormer, while certainly looking younger than she is, could never pass as a minor.</p><p>And that would probably be the only thing that makes Sansa off-limits for Natalie Dormer, or some other actress D&amp;D adore, to play her in D&amp;D&rsquo;s adaptation. Everything else would&rsquo;ve been doable. Had George R. R. Martin not put her first period in the books, Sansa&rsquo;s age, promiscuity, vocabulary, even wardrobe, would&rsquo;ve been changed accordingly to suit D&amp;D&rsquo;s vision of a progressive Westerosi woman, which means the first three would&rsquo;ve been amplified, while the fourth one &ndash; wardrobe &ndash; would definitely be reduced and freed from all the unnecessary parts. She&rsquo;d probably even hook up with some rogue brute at some point; when she&rsquo;d find the time for him, that is; after she&rsquo;s done with Joff, Tyrion, Lancel, and god knows who else, she&rsquo;d certainly figure out cynical killers can occupy her bed just as good as other available men can.</p><p>Speaking of cynical killers &ndash; enter Sandor Clegane. One more character that, alas, couldn&rsquo;t be played by Natalie Dormer, and therefore not of particular interest to D&amp;D. Sandor in the novels is a truly memorable fellow, who slowly but steadily grows in readers&rsquo; eyes as the story progresses. At the beginning, he&rsquo;s nothing more than a merciless brute used only for killing people Lannisters want dead. Very soon, however, a reader finds out there might be some traces of soul under that rough surface. More and more we find out about Sandor, more and more intriguing and understandable he gets. Even &ndash; more likable.</p><p>Now, what makes him likable? The stories Littlefinger tells to Sansa?! Of course not. The stories Sandor himself keeps telling to Sansa are what fleshes him to the extent that was probably impossible to predict at the beginning of the series. Through his conversations with Sansa, we find out every important thing there is to know about him. Later on, when he hangs up with Arya, Sandor is already a fully developed character, whom we aren&rsquo;t discovering any more, but rather following. And he became like that precisely through his exchanges with Sansa.</p><p>The show went the other way, and a pretty odd way, at that. D&amp;D decided it was better for Littlefinger to deliver the story of how Sandor&rsquo;s face got burned, and that decision carries some very serious consequences in regards to characterization. For example, Littlefinger appears as someone who does know the secrets of King&rsquo;s Landing, but, at the same time, as someone who doesn&rsquo;t hesitate to share those secrets with persons he doesn&rsquo;t have any control over. Yes, he warns Sansa not to tell anyone about the story; but, he warns her because, and here comes the funny part &ndash; Sandor is going to kill her.</p><p>Now, why isn&rsquo;t Littlefinger afraid Sandor&rsquo;s going to kill him? After all, isn&rsquo;t that the logical question because it&rsquo;s Littlefinger who offers Sandor&rsquo;s secrets to others? It seems there are only two possible answers: 1) Sandor is not that scary and dangerous as Littlefinger claims, or 2) Sandor is a dangerous fellow, but Littlefinger is the bravest individual alive, because he goes around telling the secrets of people that physically can literally eat him for breakfast; and he isn&rsquo;t shy even, because he doesn&rsquo;t fail to warn Sansa how dangerous is the situation he himself dares so boldly.</p><p>Whatever conclusion a viewer draws from there, something is going to be radically changed from the source material. Quite possibly, in fact, a lot of things are going to be altered. After the said scene, both Littlefinger and Sandor are drastically different than their book origins. And the characters we ended up with in the show, are not nearly as complex and intriguing as their book counterparts. This is especially true for Sandor, who&rsquo;s nothing if not scary and dangerous. He is supposed to frighten the living hell out of everyone who isn&rsquo;t his older brother. If you take that away from Sandor, you&rsquo;re only left with his tender side.</p><p>But, even his tender side was almost entirely removed from the show. This time, not only by Littlefinger, but also by Tyrion: in the throne room, when Joff orders Kingsguards to undress Sansa, Sandor stands there silently. His face exp<b></b>ression suggests he isn&rsquo;t pleased with what he sees, but that&rsquo;s it. He doesn&rsquo;t stand up to his king with firm &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough&rdquo; as in the book. It is therefore on Tyrion exclusively to deny Joffrey the pleasure of torturing the girl whose only crime was that she saw him in a moment of unflattering weakness. As in the books, TV Tyrion enters the room with his sellsword and he defends Sansa from Joff, but the important difference is that in the show it looks like Tyrion is the only one both willing to oppose Joffrey and capable of doing it. In the novel, we can sense that Sandor is ready to do the same thing, only, in his case, it comes with a much bigger risk, which is not without importance.</p><p>So, in this particular case, Sandor was sacrificed for the sake of TV Tyrion. TV Littlefinger, however, wasn&rsquo;t forgotten in that regard, because, once again, he&rsquo;s fed with lines that originally belong to Sandor. In the finale of the second season, it is Littlefinger who tells Sansa to look around and see how much better than her all those liars are. Just as the last time around, this change serves neither Littlefinger nor Sandor: the former&rsquo;s creepy-mentoring side is exposed much earlier than it would be logical, while the latter is robbed of yet another moment in which he shows how much he cares for Sansa and how protective he is toward her.</p><p>Sansa is a case on its own, as far as wrong adaptations are concerned. She&rsquo;s in the league with her mother Catelyn Stark, as two Stark women that were literally butchered in the show. The thing two of them have in common is the nature of their complexity: opposite to other female characters in ASOIAF, like Dany or Arya or Asha or Brienne or Cersei, Cat and Sansa aren&rsquo;t interested in hurting their enemies with their own hands, or, in the case of Dany, with her own dragons (this goes for Cersei, too, even though she&rsquo;s the one ordering the suffering of others, not committing it: her aggression is always personal, as we can sense in the first three novels). And, what&rsquo;s more, Sansa isn&rsquo;t interested in hurting anyone, actually. Cat does have an aggressive side in her; it&rsquo;s female aggression all the way, but aggression it is. Sansa, on the other hand, almost never desires other people to suffer in any way. There&rsquo;s only one noticeable exception: Joffrey. She does think on one or two occasions how nice it would be if Robb put a sword in Joff, and, by extension, she wishes Lannisters are defeated in the war against her family. However, we have to consider the situation she finds herself in at those moments &ndash; imprisoned by the Lannisters and at Joff&rsquo;s 'mercy&rsquo; all the time; small miracle she wishes them ill. I&rsquo;ve never been a girl arrested by the grave enemies of my family, but if I was, I&rsquo;d definitely pray for their most horrible deaths every single night. And, we have to remember that, after Joff&rsquo;s death, she fails to feel happy over it, even though she tries to a little.</p><p>Therefore, it maybe isn&rsquo;t a stretch to say Sansa is probably the one character that is most unlike the author himself. Other major characters, especially POV ones, do resemble Martin at least partially. For males, it&rsquo;s obvious: even though GRRM never fought in a war, nor had any military training whatsoever, men are men; even in our day and age, no male is a complete stranger to war; while depicting all those dramatic battles and duels was quite an achievement (which no personal experience would make any easier, truth be told, because in ASOIAF the combat as a phenomenon is illustrated from any number of angles, each among them presented with an abundance of details), ultimately it was in himself where Martin could find a lot of answers about his male characters, whose position in a society is never independent from their combat prowess or lack of it. Female characters, on the other hand, had to be trickier, just like they always are for male authors &ndash; let&rsquo;s admit it, they are not that good in creating great females, just like women writers usually don&rsquo;t produce male characters that are a match to their female characters nor to the male heroes created by male authors. In our day and age, these &ldquo;gender rules&rdquo; are rarely spoken of, but they continue to exist, due to gender predispositions that are nowhere as strong as in the mind of an individual. There are exceptions, as in good male characters created by women and vice versa, but they are in a clear minority compared to underdeveloped or unrealistic characters whose only &ldquo;fault&rdquo; was that they didn&rsquo;t share the sex with an author. And in that regard, ASOIAF could very well be unparalleled: it is perhaps impossible to find any other story that features nearly as many memorable male and female characters both, as ASOIAF does (truth be told, that fact alone should be enough to inspire analysts and scholars to look at ASOIAF at a different, more demanding light, and not as a genre piece).</p><p>Martin&rsquo;s girls, however, aren&rsquo;t completely unlike the man who came up with them. Most of them are willingly participating in &ldquo;men games&rdquo;, e.g. power-plays and/or wars, which makes for a precious connection to a male mindset of the author. They are thinking and behaving as women (or, in the case of Arya, and Dany to an extent, as girls), but all of them are interacting with something that, in all its glory and misery, can roughly be called &ldquo;a man&rsquo;s world&rdquo;. Some of the most beautifully written chapters in the series are delivered from female POVs &ndash; The Red Wedding and Cersei&rsquo;s &ldquo;Walk of Shame&rdquo; come to mind right away; but, in a thematic sense, those and other female chapters don&rsquo;t differ too much from male POVs.</p><p>Except for Sansa&rsquo;s chapters, which unmistakably belong to something we can roughly call &ldquo;a woman&rsquo;s world&rdquo;. Chapters of both male and female POVs in ASOIAF are often rich with testosterone, but Sansa&rsquo;s ones are almost entirely driven by estrogen: look no further than her captivity in King&rsquo;s Landing, that actually is, as already said, focused around her first period &ndash; that decision solely should bring a lot of respect for Martin, because he had to know going that road is never easy for a male writer.</p><p>And the funniest thing is, it all fits. Sansa&rsquo;s storyline is distinctive in tone, but not odd. It is a legitimate part of the general plot of ASOIAF. In fact, as her story progresses, Sansa becomes more and more important for The Game, even though she showed no clear inclination to participate in it so far, but at the same time, Martin keeps Sansa away from all those &ldquo;male&rdquo; aspects he decorated other female characters of his saga.</p><p>And on top of everything, we&rsquo;re presented with her love story, a romance with no other than the man who, prior to discovering some delicate feelings for Sansa, could pose for an ideal brute of Westeros. At the beginning of the story, Sandor Clegane could be perceived as the exact opposite of Sansa. As someone who has no business whatsoever in her world, just like she has none in his. But, with some craft wording and master subtlety, Martin succeeds in illustrating the flood of emotions that go both ways in their relationship. Those emotions are never easy, nor appropriate, let alone allowed &ndash; even by Sansa and Sandor themselves! &ndash; but they&rsquo;re hard to be denied.</p><p>The complexity of their multilayered characters, of their respective positions in a society and in an ongoing war, and of their relationship that resists all known clich&eacute;s, represent some of the strongest evidence that ASOIAF is much more than a genre piece. There&rsquo;s a lot in these novels that escapes genre boundaries, but nothing more evidently than SanSan. Stuff like that is not your usual fantasy element, no matter how flattering fantasy can be as a label (Homer, Shakespeare, Tolkien &ndash; to name just a few all-time greats that created unforgettable stories with supernatural aspects in them). Any author who comes up with that kind of love story involving those kind of characters &ndash; and with a legion of other characters, and with no less than four different religions, and with themes of honor, redemption, identity, bravery, equality, ancestry, legacy, freedom, revolution&hellip; &ndash; deserves to be analyzed not as a genre writer.</p><p>Now, one can only imagine what kind of enigma Sansa and Sandor were for Benioff and Weiss. And it pretty much remained unsolved, because, when faced with all the complexity of these two characters, Benioff and Weiss decided to remove it almost entirely, along with their relationship that is reduced to occasional and odd mentioning of 'little bird&rsquo;. TV Sandor was simplified to a one-note brute that goes around TV Westeros and lectures people about the pleasures of killing, a one-note brute he never was in the novels, not even in the beginning of the saga. TV Sansa, on the other hand, was denied her book complexity by shutting down all her layers, one by one. For example, Benioff and Weiss completely removed her decision to go behind her father&rsquo;s back and inform Cersei of his plan. They simply refused to go down that road. They did something similar to Catelyn, whose infamous line to Jon they didn&rsquo;t remove entirely, but did replace it with a much softer one. It is pretty safe to assume that Cat&rsquo;s and Sansa&rsquo;s complexity did bother Benioff and Weiss from the get-go.</p><p>What&rsquo;s also removed from the show is Sansa&rsquo;s agency, primarily represented in the novels by her secret meetings with Dontos, a disgraced knight she herself saved from Joffrey. In the show, we got only the saving scene; it was filmed and executed clumsily, but it was there at least. However, until recently, nobody could be sure Sansa did save Dontos, because the man disappeared afterwards (he was briefly seen as joggling balls in &ldquo;Blackwater&rdquo; episode, in the scene in Cersei&rsquo;s chambers, but he was unrecognizable for the vast majority of audience). It is reported, though, that Dontos will be returning in Season 4, so yes, Sansa did save his life after all. But, even when he returns, Sansa&rsquo;s attempts at escaping will be two seasons younger than they should&rsquo;ve been at that point, and it&rsquo;s hard to see a way D&amp;D can remedy that neglect.</p><p>Show-lovers often defend D&amp;D in regards to Sansa, by saying her personality is a difficult and tricky one for portraying on screen, because even in the books she&rsquo;s introverted. Now, maybe she isn&rsquo;t the most extroverted character ever, but she&rsquo;s pretty far from reclusive, as she does communicate with the outside world a lot at the beginning of the series, before she&rsquo;s imprisoned. And even while in captivity, she can&rsquo;t help but communicate with Sandor and Dontos. What&rsquo;s more, around two of them she is her true self, which provides a wide array of possibilities for a good and informative dialogue that, in an adaptation, could compensate for the lack of inner thoughts. With Dontos, she&rsquo;s open not only because she saved him, but also because he explicitly offers his help (and, truth be told, it is he who enabled her to leave King&rsquo;s Landing eventually, so, even though he wasn&rsquo;t exactly honest with her concerning his motivations, her trust wasn&rsquo;t as misplaced as it may seem at first). And with Sandor, she&rsquo;s open for no particular reason &ndash; other than those subtle, emotional forces, that both of them can&rsquo;t help but follow and eventually become the closest and most intimate beings to each other.</p><p>The way Martin incepted and developed the barely visible, but undeniable romance, between Sansa and Sandor, is nothing short of literary brilliance. With so few words and interactions, he managed so much. The vast majority of readers are aware of restrained attraction they mutually feel, even though they didn&rsquo;t share a single physical aspect of the romantic relationship.</p><p>Martin is indeed a master of subtlety, as evidenced by what looks like the endless amount of carefully hidden clues that point to any number of narrative puzzles, realization of which do make an entire story much richer than if taken at face value. And he&rsquo;s never more subtle than with two romances: Rhaegar/Lyanna and Sandor/Sansa. Now, the respective nature of subtlety of those two romances is rather different. With Rhaegar and Lyanna, a reader is &ndash; through Robert&rsquo;s retelling &ndash; offered a version that is actually the very opposite of what probably happened, and only later a reader can pick up clues here and there, and finally figure out the story of a fatal attraction between the two. But, the clues are presented throughout the text, so much that, even if you don&rsquo;t decipher everything after the first read, at the end of &ldquo;A Game of Thrones&rdquo; &ndash; the first book of the series &ndash; you&rsquo;ll probably sense that Robert&rsquo;s view on events wasn&rsquo;t exactly accurate.</p><p>The story of Sansa and Sandor is a very different one. Their relationship is never as much as addressed, even by themselves. Sandor isn&rsquo;t a POV character, and he&rsquo;s not exactly open to people, so his silence on the matter isn&rsquo;t unexpected. But, Martin didn&rsquo;t address their romance even in Sansa&rsquo;s chapters, which are typically packed with inner thoughts of the POV character. It looks like Martin decided to do it the harder way and make their romance somewhat a mystery even for Sansa, which, in hindsight, does seem to be the most logical way: what teenage girl would be fully aware of a romance that &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo;, and experienced in those dire circumstances?! As a result of that decision, the readers got a completely fascinating depiction of a romance, that can be described as a train you hear from miles away: at first, you can&rsquo;t even tell is it a train or some similar sound, but slowly, with every second, you&rsquo;re more and more certain that your ears didn&rsquo;t trick you, and very soon the train is so loud that it is the only thing you can hear at all. In the novels, a reader may find something strange at first, when Sandor shares the secret of his burned face with Sansa. Some alarm may be turned on deep inside. And it becomes more apparent each time two of them share a page, with a culmination during the Battle of the Blackwater Bay, when Sandor, after he decides to desert the Lannisters, visits Sansa in her room and offers to take her home to Winterfell.</p><p>It might be the only instance in the entire series where Sandor did ask anyone&rsquo;s approval, which does speak volumes about his feelings for Sansa. Considering the manner in which Martin described this romance, Sandor&rsquo;s actions on that day was as good as a confession of his deep attraction to her. Sansa, on the other hand, doesn&rsquo;t have a single moment which could be pointed at as a prime evidence of her undeniable love for The Hound, but this doesn&rsquo;t mean her feelings toward Sandor aren&rsquo;t palpable. It&rsquo;s one more mastery of the writer: through her frequent (and skewed, but in a telling way) memories on the last time she saw Sandor, he was able to show her feelings resonating more and more inside her.</p><p>In the show, Martin was denied a chance to do the same thing, even though he wrote the &ldquo;Blackwater&rdquo; episode in Season 2. Thanks to the already destroyed storyline, and to god knows how many changes, and to D&amp;D&rsquo;s decision to remove from the final cut some scenes Martin referred to with his scenes, the one between Sansa and Sandor near the end of that episode, served more as a greeting to book-fans who like SanSan in the source material, than as a goodbye between two not unlike souls who shared much, and could have shared a lot more, and maybe are going to if they meet again. In that scene, Rory McCann was visibly better than usual as Sandor, and Sophie Turner was as good as usual, but, just like with anything ASOIAF, the scene doesn&rsquo;t have nearly the same impact and importance if taken out of context.</p><p>The exact context of their SanSan is yet to be fully revealed in the books, too. Because of the already mentioned subtlety &ndash; a quality that seems to intimidate showrunners Benioff and Weiss, who, in their turn, do retaliate with their on-screen war on subtlety (just recall what they turned other romances into; for example, the romance between TV Jon &ldquo;Not The Brightest Kid In The Block&rdquo; Snow and TV &ldquo;I Know Everything And Therefore I Can&rsquo;t Stop Talking&rdquo; Ygritte) &ndash; Sansa&rsquo;s and Sandor&rsquo;s love story is by no means an open book. Their romance has its own share of mystery, one of which may be: what inspired those two persons to feel so strongly for each other? Personally, I always thought their mutual attraction isn&rsquo;t only based on a &ldquo;beauty and the beast&rdquo; model. There is that, but in their case it goes deeper. If that was the engine behind his emotions, Sandor had more than enough opportunities to find a beauty for his beast long before Sansa entered his life. With Sansa, I&rsquo;d say their mutual attraction is rooted in their personalities. For example, if you take away Sandor&rsquo;s aggression, he also isn&rsquo;t interested in hurting others. He&rsquo;s naturally talented for violence, and he lives in a society that respects that kind of talent, and that is why he&rsquo;s violent for a living, but at the end of the day, the suffering of others isn&rsquo;t any kind of reward for him. Possibly, because he isn&rsquo;t interested in other people that much. Though, when he is interested in someone, the interest is as strong as they come.</p><p>(We don&rsquo;t know at this point, but it&rsquo;s not a stretch to imagine that his reaction to the news that his hated brother was killed wasn&rsquo;t unlike Sansa&rsquo;s reaction to Joff&rsquo;s death. &ldquo;Am I glad he&rsquo;s dead? Well, not exactly, even though I wanted him killed.&rdquo;)</p><p>Sansa may very well be like that, too. That would be one of the possible explanations of her AGOT actions. Like the rest of the Starks, Sansa is a complex character that has some issues of her own, without which neither she nor the other Starks would be such memorable characters as they obviously are; it is the fact that they are both willing and strong enough to fight those issues, that Starks stand out for. Without going into details (as if I could!), I expect that in the remaining novels Sansa is going to face the reasons that made her go to Cersei that damned night and with the consequences of that action. And whatever comes out of that soul-searching will be inevitably combined with her claim to Winterfell that Littlefinger brought up in AFFC. And that combination is going to elevate Sansa&rsquo;s arc to even bigger and more important levels than so far, even though so far she was the one Stark that was most engaged &ndash; unwittingly, but still &ndash; in the bloody dynastic war for the Iron Throne.</p><p>And she&rsquo;ll have to cross paths with Sandor Clegane, one way or another. Their relationship was so meticulously built up, it simply has to get some sort of a closure. What that closure is going to be is impossible to predict, because we are talking of one George R. R. Martin, a writer who managed to shock us as he pleased more than a few times.</p><p>What is also impossible, is to take anything that did or didn&rsquo;t happen in the show as any indication at what the closer may or may not be. There isn&rsquo;t a storyline in GoT that wasn&rsquo;t drastically changed, and weakened in the process, but Sansa&rsquo;s arc, along with her relationship with Sandor, is among the biggest victims of D&amp;D&rsquo;s inability to adapt.</p><p>Whether you happen to like what Benioff and Weiss put in the show, or don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;d be advised not to recognize any significance in their decisions for further developments in ASOIAF. Just like show-lovers tend to remind everyone else, GoT and ASOIAF are two entirely separate beasts. And book Sansa and book Sandor, along with everything Martin has in his store for them, can be really glad about it.</p>",

Their rendition of Melisandre, for example, isn&rsquo;t an intimidating and imposing practitioner of dark and supernatural powers, but rather a seductress who&rsquo;s able to make people obey her only if she rewards them with sex (Stannis, Gendry) or gold (Brotherhood without Banners). One more example would be their rendition of Margaery Tyrell, who was turned from a teenage girl with a perfect facade and somewhat mysterious foundation, into a promiscuous lady willing to do anything &ndash; even have sex with both her brother and her husband simultaneously, as she proposes to the latter in Season 2 &ndash; in order to achieve her personal political ambitions that are literally limitless.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, Sansa Stark never had a chance to be properly adapted in the show created by D&amp;D. Now, the word &lsquo;properly&rsquo; has a rather wide range of possible meanings, and this essay will attempt to examine at least some of them, but, for now, let&rsquo;s say that the most obvious aspect in which TV Sansa was shorthanded is her screen time. In &ldquo;A Clash of Kings&rdquo;, the book that was the basis for the Season 2 of GoT, Sansa&rsquo;s POV chapters, along with Tyrion&rsquo;s, are the only ones that depict what&rsquo;s happening in King&rsquo;s Landing, the capital of The Seven Kingdoms and the center of political power in the story. This goes for the first two thirds of &ldquo;A Storm of Swords&rdquo; as well, e.g. until the moment Sansa escapes from King&rsquo;s Landing. In short, her chapters couldn&rsquo;t help but be of paramount importance in the narrative sense. In the show, however, Sansa&rsquo;s significance is greatly decreased, and not only because the show doesn&rsquo;t follow the &ldquo;POV structure&rdquo; of the novels, but because she&rsquo;s reduced to nothing but a prized captive for the Lannisters.</p>\n</p>",

If there is any connection between the first-day champions of the Tourney of Ashford (none of whom, let\u2019s keep in mind, ended up winning the aborted tourney or naming a queen of love and beauty, much less the fair maid of Ashford) and the main narrative, I think GRRM was probably hunting around for an identity for the eventual Harry, and thought the surname of the dashing tourney champion Ser Humfrey (also with the nice alliteration of name) suited his Vale aristocrat playboy well.\u00a0</p>",

                "content": "<p>That&rsquo;s kind of you to say.</p><p>Fundamentally, it&rsquo;s because I think the theory makes a mountain out of a coincidental molehill and ignores narrative simplicity and clearly established plotting in favor of, well, illogical storytelling.&nbsp;</p><p>First, of course, there&rsquo;s really no reason at all to believe that Sansa would be betrothed to, much less marry, the would-be Aegon VI. <a href=\"http://goodqueenaly.tumblr.com/post/166466116833/lol-a-marriage-between-aegon-and-arianne-would-be\">The upcoming marriage of Arianne and Aegon has been clearly set up by Arianne&rsquo;s two TWOW sample chapters, with clear motivations on both sides for it</a>. On Sansa&rsquo;s side, <a href=\"http://goodqueenaly.tumblr.com/post/174125943168/so-why-does-littlefinger-believe-that-the-knights\">the explicitly stated plan is to have the chivalry of the Vale rally around Sansa&rsquo;s cause at her wedding to Harry</a>; economy of storytelling argues for Sansa getting back home sooner rather than later, and there&rsquo;s simply no narrative gain (and lots of wasted time that the story really doesn&rsquo;t have to waste) to have Sansa go back south again to go back north eventually anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>But even if we were going to suppose that Jon somehow fit in that last slot &hellip; well, again, I think that really misses the point of everything. <a href=\"http://goodqueenaly.tumblr.com/post/177162326248/honestly-if-grrm-hasnt-named-the-princess-why\">Names are important in ASOIAF</a>, but this theory throws out Jon&rsquo;s identity as &ldquo;Jon Snow&rdquo; in favor of identifying Jon only as a Targaryen (<a href=\"http://goodqueenaly.tumblr.com/post/177203569258/do-you-think-well-find-out-that-jon-was-named\">which is something that I recently criticized the show for doing</a>). <a href=\"http://goodqueenaly.tumblr.com/post/147448587828/hi-what-do-you-think-is-the-point-of-the-whole\">I strongly believe that Jon&rsquo;s story <i>is not </i>a Targaryen story</a>, and consequently can&rsquo;t get behind a theory which puts such an emphasis on his Targaryen-ness. (Not to mention that it seems odd that Joffrey gets to be a Baratheon for purposes of the theory because that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s recognized as, and Harry gets to be a Hardyng <a href=\"http://goodqueenaly.tumblr.com/post/166036993488/when-sweetrobin-dies-and-harrold-hardying-becomes\">despite the likelihood of him becoming Harrold Arryn on his ascension</a>, but Jon is slotted in the Targaryen position despite having no recognition to anyone in-universe as a Targaryen.)&nbsp;</p><p>I have no strong feelings toward Sansa&rsquo;s romantic future with anyone, but I certainly would not base any feelings I did have on this theory.
