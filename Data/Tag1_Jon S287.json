A lot of the time with Tyrion, it&rsquo;s professional <i>and</i>\u00a0personal. Obviously, he has feelings for Daenerys. He loves her \u2014 or thinks he does. She\u2019s awe-inspiring. He\u2019s questioning that because he doesn\u2019t have a good track record for falling in love. There\u2019s jealousy wrapped up in there. And he loves Jon Snow, too. They\u2019re the two people he has the most in common with, in a way \u2014 they\u2019re both outsiders in their own families who have refused to follow the path their family has taken, and hopefully for the better. He\u2019s wondering how smart of a move [Jon and Dany getting romantically involved is], because passion and politics don\u2019t mix well. He knows the two of them getting together could be very dangerous.\u201d</p><p>There&rsquo;s a lot to unpack here. First of all:</p><p>1. It&rsquo;s complicated, as are most of Tyrion&rsquo;s relationships with others. Dinklage says that a lot of the time with Tyrion, it&rsquo;s professional <i>and</i> personal. We already know that Tyrion has trouble separating these two areas in his relationships, see his relationships with Bronn and Shae, but also Sansa, whom he is not supposed to empathize with on a personal level because she is a Lannister prisoner, but he does. He has conflicting political and personal loyalties when he is still allied with his family against the Starks, and now he&rsquo;s allied with Dany, working for a regime he actually personally believes in, but he can&rsquo;t shake the deeply learned loyalty to his family, even despite all they did to him, or because he&rsquo;s still hoping for their validation.</p><p>2. He loves Dany, or thinks he does. On a physical level, Dany is beautiful. She&rsquo;s awe-inspiring, has already achieved mythical status - in the books dubbed &quot;the most beautiful woman in the world&rdquo; which has more to do with that mythologizing than her actual appearance - is powerful, has done incredibly things, has woken dragons and freed slaves. Why wouldn&rsquo;t Tyrion love her? On a more personal level, Dany is a champion of the dispossessed, mother to her people. Tyrion is a dwarf without a mother, why <i>wouldn&rsquo;t</i> he love her, this mother of dragons, this breaker of chains? And she&rsquo;s chosen him as her hand, not because of what his name is but because of his own merit. This is the kind of affirmation that Tyrion has longed for, and the scene where she presents him with the hand pin definitely had romantic overtones, as Dany dumped Dario in the exact same scene as she took Tyrion as her Hand. Of course Tyrion is in love with Dany on some level.</p><p>3. However, Tyrion &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t have a good track record for falling in love.&rdquo; His love for Dany is probably something he himself is not sure how to identify. I think with Tyrion, his romantic feelings are gonna be a big mess because saying he doesn&rsquo;t have a good track record is&hellip;putting it mildly. Does he want to have sex with her? Does he want a replacement for the familial love he never got? Does he want affirmation in his skills as an advisor? Does he want her to see him as a hero, the way she now sees Jon, because Jon is big and strong and able bodied and everything Tyrion isn&rsquo;t? Probably all three. Which leads me to.</p><p>4. Jealousy. Which I don&rsquo;t think is necessarily romantic jealousy, but more relating to Tyrion&rsquo;s deep rooted insecurities about himself as a man and a person, due to his specific traumas. I think there is romantic jealousy in there, but like I said, it&rsquo;s all a big mess because Tyrion was never <i>taught</i> how to give or recieve love. The models he has for that are the toxic relationships in his own family, including his family&rsquo;s abuse of him, his father&rsquo;s worship of a dead woman, and his brother and sister&rsquo;s obsessive relationship.</p><p>5. Tyrion ALSO loves Jon Snow. He&rsquo;s probably worried about them both, as Dinklage says, but also: I think Tyrion can&rsquo;t help feeling the kind of jealousy someone in his position might feel, not necessarily a romantic jealousy but one born from the loneliness of his position. Tyrion is a very lonely person and he longs for the kind of connection he sees in people around him. Here are two people he loves getting together, and he&rsquo;s left alone, and jealous not necessarily because he thinks Dany should have chosen <i>him</i>, but because these two people that he cares deeply about have something that he feels is impossible for him to achieve. He thought he found that in both Jon and Dany, as all three of them, as Dinklage pointed out, share the status of being outsiders, of wanting to make the world better than they found it. But now Jon and Dany getting together has changed the dynamic, and it&rsquo;s a bit of a parallel with Jaime and Cersei. No matter how much Jaime loved Tyrion, he was always going to love Cersei more, and Tyrion is left as a third wheel, of sorts. And what does this mean for Jon and Dany and their survival if all of Tyrion&rsquo;s models for romantic love ended in tragedy?</p><p>So yes, I do think there is romantic jealousy in there, but like Dinklage said, it&rsquo;s complicated. And it&rsquo;s not necessarily a new feeling for Tyrion but a symptom of what he&rsquo;s always struggled with.</p>",

I personally believe that Cersei will absolutely make a play for Winterfell. I\u2019m willing to bet money on it! Why you ask? Well because essentially the two smartest players in the game brought up the importance of not ignoring/forgetting Cersei and 100% imply that she will make a play! Sansa and Littlefinger were the only people who were taking the Cersei threat seriously and are not underestimating her at all! </p><p>In the scene above here\u2019s the most important parts of Jon and Sansa\u2019s dialogue:</p><h2>Sansa:\u201d<i>You\u2019ve been so consumed with the enemy in the North you\u2019ve <b>forgotten  </b></i>about<i> the one to the south.\u201d</i></h2><h2>Sansa: \u201c<i>We still have a wall between us and the Night King there\u2019s nothing between us and Cersei.\u201d</i></h2><h2>Jon: \u201cT<i>here\u2019s a thousand miles between us and Cersei.

Everyone who\u2019s ever crossed her she\u2019s found a way to murder!\u201d</i></h2><p>Y\u2019all this entire dialogue is so important! It wasn\u2019t just filler for the show. There\u2019s one important point I want to bring up about this scene. I love that fact that Sansa makes it explicitly clear to Jon that she knows Cersei. She is fully aware of who they\u2019re enemy is and what she\u2019s capable of. Apart from the stories Jon\u2019s heard and the atrocities Cersei has brought upon his family, he doesn\u2019t know shit about Cersei! He hasn\u2019t had firsthand experience of her cruelty and shouldn\u2019t assume that he knows what she\u2019s capable of or whether or not she\u2019s a viable threat because of winter. Honestly that\u2019s silly.</p><p>For some reason this scene makes me think of Olenna\u2019s words to Jaimie here:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"582\" data-orig-width=\"970\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/38082e6f1b0685f82004bbb3016943c4/tumblr_pf1wv1GjlV1v81iri_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"582\" data-orig-width=\"970\"/></figure><p>In this scene Olenna says:</p><h2>\u201c<i>Whatever</i> <i>I imagined necessary for House Tyrell I did, but your sister has done things <b>I wasn\u2019t capabale of imagining. </b>That was my prized mistake a <b>failure of imagination!\u201d</b></i></h2><p>This is the enemy that Jon and Sansa are dealing with. This is what Jon fails to understand. This is a person who is capable of doing things that even some of the smartest game players couldn\u2019t even fathom. Olenna\u2019s words also reminds me of this scene:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"165\" data-orig-width=\"250\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2998f519c016c0cdfaf53a9f890c8d3e/tumblr_pf1wv2ROZx1v81iri_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"165\" data-orig-width=\"250\"/></figure><p>Littlefinger mentions that the northerners are solely focused on the threat beyond the wall.</p><h2>Sansa: \u201c<i>As they should be.\u201d</i></h2><h2>Littlefinger:\u201d<i><b>I know</b> Cersei better than anyone here. <b>If you turn your back on her&hellip;&hellip;\u201d</b></i></h2><p>Y\u2019all, the show is making it perfectly clear that Cersei is a threat that should equally be taken as seriously as the Night King. Make no mistake, Sansa absolutely agrees with Littlefingers assessment of the situation. She\u2019s already ahead of the game which is why she broached this same topic with Jon in the first episode of the season.  But of course, she\u2019s not going to openly agree with Littlefinger and let him know her thoughts. She\u2019s going to continue to do her part to prepare her people for the long night.</p><h2>Anyway back to the meta! </h2><p>After Sansa states that she\u2019s fully aware of how dangerous Cersei is Littlefinger\u2019s response is this:</p><h2>\u201c<i>Fight every battle everywhere always in your <b>mind</b>.

I mean how can it not be! This was the piece of advice Littlefinger gave Sansa after discussing Cersei! Also this definitely makes Olenna\u2019s words come to life. </p><p>Where Olenna failed was that she couldn\u2019t think about the endless <b>POSSIBILITIES</b> that Cersei could see to her families demise. Her imagination wasn\u2019t big enough. Essentially what Littlefinger is telling Sansa here is that she needs to always stretch the boundaries of her imagination. She needs to always think about every possibility certain situations can play out so that she can never be caught off guard.</p><p>Cersei has absolutely no problem in this department. This is the same women who stays up all night thinking about ways she can get her revenge/kill her enemies. Her imagination knows no boundaries and she\u2019s down to do whatever is necessary to accomplish her goals.</p><p>That\u2019s why I believe without a doubt that Cersei is going make a play for Winterfell! Winter or not if she wants to do something she\u2019s going to do it! I can totally see Cersei attacking Winterfell as the Night King is attacking Winterfell, I can see her kidnapping Sansa, I can see her doing a lot of crazy shit! The point is Cersei is not going to sit on the Iron Throne and wait for her enemies to arrive at her doorstep!

Olenna&rsquo;s words also reminds me of this scene:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2998f519c016c0cdfaf53a9f890c8d3e/tumblr_pf1wv2ROZx1v81iri_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Littlefinger mentions that the northerners are solely focused on the threat beyond the wall.</p><h2>Sansa: &ldquo;<i>As they should be.&rdquo;</i></h2><h2>Littlefinger:&rdquo;<i><b>I know</b> Cersei better than anyone here. <b>If you turn your back on her&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</b></i></h2><p>Y&rsquo;all, the show is making it perfectly clear that Cersei is a threat that should equally be taken as seriously as the Night King. Make no mistake, Sansa absolutely agrees with Littlefingers assessment of the situation. She&rsquo;s already ahead of the game which is why she broached this same topic with Jon in the first episode of the season.  But of course, she&rsquo;s not going to openly agree with Littlefinger and let him know her thoughts. She&rsquo;s going to continue to do her part to prepare her people for the long night.</p><h2>Anyway back to the meta! </h2><p>After Sansa states that she&rsquo;s fully aware of how dangerous Cersei is Littlefinger&rsquo;s response is this:</p><h2>&ldquo;<i>Fight every battle everywhere always in your <b>mind</b>. Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend. <b>Every possible series of events is happening all at once; Live that way and nothing  will surprise you! </b>Everything that happens will be something that you&rsquo;ve seen before! &ldquo;</i></h2><p>I think this is foreshadowing of Game of Thrones in general but I also think this is foreshadowing particularly pertaining to Cersei. I mean how can it not be! This was the piece of advice Littlefinger gave Sansa after discussing Cersei! Also this definitely makes Olenna&rsquo;s words come to life. </p><p>Where Olenna failed was that she couldn&rsquo;t think about the endless <b>POSSIBILITIES</b> that Cersei could see to her families demise. Her imagination wasn&rsquo;t big enough. Essentially what Littlefinger is telling Sansa here is that she needs to always stretch the boundaries of her imagination. She needs to always think about every possibility certain situations can play out so that she can never be caught off guard.</p><p>Cersei has absolutely no problem in this department. This is the same women who stays up all night thinking about ways she can get her revenge/kill her enemies. Her imagination knows no boundaries and she&rsquo;s down to do whatever is necessary to accomplish her goals.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why I believe without a doubt that Cersei is going make a play for Winterfell! Winter or not if she wants to do something she&rsquo;s going to do it! I can totally see Cersei attacking Winterfell as the Night King is attacking Winterfell, I can see her kidnapping Sansa, I can see her doing a lot of crazy shit! The point is Cersei is not going to sit on the Iron Throne and wait for her enemies to arrive at her doorstep! She always has a game going on behind the scenes and I fully expect for her to pull out her biggest tricks in the last season.</p></p>",

If he hadn&rsquo;t returned from the dead, there would be absolutely nothing special about him.
