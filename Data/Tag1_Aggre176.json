        "body": "<p>Retsuko, Haida and all from accounting went to an office\nparty. It was the end of the trimester and all work was completed in time. In\nfact, they were celebrating because it was the first time in years, they had\nsuch an uneventful period: all transactions matched the books and not a single\nfile was missing. </p><p>Haida, Retsuko and Fenneko were sitting together. Booze and\ndelicious snacks kept coming and the conversation was fluid and full of\nlaughter. Retsuko and Haida were almost past the awkwardness of Haida\u2019s\nconfession from last year. It has been a long ride for both of them. Haida\ndidn\u2019t want to give up just yet, but he didn\u2019t know exactly how to start again\nthat conversation.</p><p>Retsuko was very confused lately. She turned down Haida\u2019s\nfeelings and was sure she did the right thing. But nowadays she was feeling\nvery restless around him even though there wasn\u2019t a reason to do so. Haida was\nvery respectful of her decision, he was careful not to bring the subject\nanymore. Also, he was still a good friend, Retsuko knew that at first was\ndifficult, but after a while everything went back to normal. And that was starting\nto annoy her a little bit even if she didn\u2019t know why. </p><p>It was almost 2 in the morning. Retsuko was feeling drunk,\nbut she was having a good time. Fenneko and Haida too, they were singing\nkaraoke together and pouring each other drinks. They had this amazing\nfriendship\u2026 she knew that even though Fenneko and Haida weren\u2019t in love or\nanything, they were there for each other and trust each other in a way Retsuko\nand Haida could never be. She was feeling a little lonely but most of all\u2026\njealous. </p><p>Retsuko stood up, a little too sudden. Fenneko and Haida\nnoticed immediately. </p><p>Fenneko: Naa, Retsuko? Are you feeling ok? </p><p>Retsuko: Hi, hi. Don\u2019t worry I\u2019m just\u2026 I just want to go\nto the restroom. </p><p>Fenneko: Want me tagging along? </p><p>Retsuko: No, no. That\u2019s okey. I can do it myself. I\u2019ll be\nright back. </p><p>Retsuko disappeared behind the shoji. Her walking was\nclearly of a drunk person. She even apologized to Komiya when she stepped on\nhis tail. </p><p> Haida was worried\nabout her. His face said more than he wanted to. But he was afraid. Maybe\nRetsuko would feel uncomfortable if he helps her, or maybe he could no longer\nkeep his feelings to himself in his drunken state. \u00a0</p><p>Fenneko: How troublesome you are! Go help Retsuko. </p><p>Haida: Ah! \u2013 his thoughts were suddenly interrupted by Fenneko.\nHe tried to fake a smile and invent an excuse- what are\u2026</p><p>Fenneko: Don\u2019t lie to me Haida, you suck at it anyway.\nRetsuko is drunk and vulnerable. You should help her. It doesn\u2019t mean something\nbad will happen. Just\u2026 be there. </p><p>\u201cFenneko was right\u201d Haida thought. He was still in love with\nher, but that doesn\u2019t mean that Retsuko wasn\u2019t her friend too and he was\nworried something bad happen to her. He decided to wait for her outside the\nrestroom. Make sure she was ok and return to the party. </p><p>Retsuko was inside the restroom. She was feeling more drunk\nthan before. But she decided to stay there a little longer before going out.\nSeeing Haida and Fenneko together made her feel uncomfortable. But more than\nthat\u2026 it made her a little sad. Something was pressuring her heart and she suddenly\nfelt that she wanted to go home. She decided to check her cellphone. She saw a\nmessage from Fenneko but, decided to ignore her. She looked for photos of\nHaida. It was weird. She couldn\u2019t find any recent photos with him, but his\nimage was clear in her head. She suddenly remembered his kind green eyes, his\ncrooked laugh and his thin and tall body. And after a while of looking for a\nphoto she just stopped and closed her eyes. Haida was clear on her mind, every\ndetail of him every spot on his face or his white hands. And a warm familiar\nfeeling came to her heart. </p><p>When Retsuko opened her eyes, she felt like hours had\npassed. She decided to go outside. Maybe people will start to get worried and\nif she wanted to go home, she could do it right now. </p><p>Retsuko step outside the restroom. She was feeling a\nlittle less drunk, but her feelings were a mess. She wanted to get out of there\nbut then\u2026 she saw him. </p><p>Haida was waiting for Retsuko outside. He was leaning in the\nwall with his eyes closed, just trying to keep it together. Maybe he was more\ndrunk than he imagined. He thought: \u201cJust make sure Restuko is okey, get back\nto the party together and then say goodbye\u201d.</p><p>Retsuko saw Haida first. Her heart started to beat so loud. Her\nface was red, but not only because of the booze, she was clearly flustered.\nHaida opened his eyes a bit after. He saw Retsuko and smiled gently. </p><p>Haida: Hey, Retsuko? How are you feeling? \u00a0Do you want to go back?</p><p>Haida then noticed something\u2026 Retsuko was very nervous. Her\neyes avoided him, and her face was red. He wasn\u2019t sure what to believe, he was\nalso drunk after all, maybe it was a misunderstanding. He saw Retsuko getting\ncloser to him. Haida didn\u2019t move at all. He was nervous but just couldn\u2019t say\nanything. </p><p>Finally, Retsuko put herself in front of him and looked Haida\nin the eyes. She knew she was drunk, but at the same time the other feelings\nwere so real. She was jealous about Fenneko back there, she was feeling warm\nand fuzzy when looking at Haida. She took a step closer to him and touched his\nface.</p><p>Haida was having trouble to keep it together. He felt his\nheart was going to explode after Retsuko touched his face. He thought: \u201cMaybe I\nshould stand up, or maybe I should light the mood\u2026\u201d. But then it suddenly hit\nhim. There was no doubt in his mind\u2026Retsuko was looking at him like she was\nabout to\u2026 </p><p>Haida: Re- Retsuko? Are you sure? You\u2019re drunk\u2026</p><p>Retsuko was startled a little by Haida\u2019s question. She just\nwanted some time to figure things out, but it was no longer possible. She liked\nhim\u2026 She wanted to kiss him and Haida knew. But he wasn\u2019t pulling away or\nstopping her. He wanted it too. Haida put his hands around her waist, Retsuko\nfelt a jolt through her body, she closed her eyes, she reached Haida\u2019s face\nwith hers.</p><p>Retsuko whispered: Yes\u2026</p><p>Retsuko nervously kissed him and Haida reciprocated. It was\na gentle kiss\u2026 Haida firmly kept his hands around her waist. He was lost in\ntheir first kiss. It wasn\u2019t how he thought would happen\u2026 but it felt better\nthan he had imagined. Retsuko lips were sweet and small. He felt real happiness\nafter a long time of keeping his feelings at bay. He was relieved, but also\nanxious. How long would it last? \u00a0</p><p>Retsuko was feeling dizzy. Her\nheartbeat was violent, she heard his too. Their lips were intertwined. Her head\nwas spinning in a million of thoughts. Haida\u2019s scent was comforting. She kissed\nscared at first, but then she felt something growing inside of her, like a\nlittle rush. She was sway away by the feeling. </p><p>Haida was almost possessed. He kissed Retsuko\u2019s lips, over and over. He smiled a little and\nkissed her cheeks, too. His eyes were shut, but he no longer needed to pick and\nsee her. His senses were taking all of Retsuko.</p><p>\n\nRetsuko was happy but curious too\u2026 She has never\nbeen in such a kiss before, with a guy she really liked, and it was a \nlittle too\noverwhelming. It was a very weird feeling, but she wanted to lick \nHaida\u2019s lips\u2026 just a little. So, she opened her mouth and did it. <br/></p><p>Haida\n was taken by surprise. He was no longer in control of himself. He stood\n up, cornered Retsuko swiftly to the wall in front of him and lifted her\n up on the little table in the hall. Retsuko\u2019s saw Haida standing in \nfront of her, almost his same height. He took Retsuko\u2019s face in his \nhands and kissed her, but this time, passionately.</p><p>Retsuko no \nlonger cared if someone saw them, their drunken state, or their \ncomplicated relationship. She \u00a0was keeping his pace. She could no longer\n breath, nor she cared. She wanted to embrace the feeling and pulled \nHaida closer. <br/></p><p>After what seemed like an eternity, Haida knew \nhe needed to stop it, right now. This was no longer an awkward little \nkiss they could ignore. They needed to talk right now and he could ruin \neverything by letting his passion take the better of him. He broke their\n long kiss, almost breathless and with his lips hurting. Their feelings \nwere a mess.</p><p>Haida: Wanna get out of here\u2026?</p><p>Retsuko nodded in response.</p><p>END PART 1</p><p>If you want to check the fanart go here: <a href=\"http://faylink.tumblr.com/post/181678173967/aggretsuko-fanart-because-im-a-trash-for-them-3\">http://faylink.tumblr.com/post/181678173967/aggretsuko-fanart-because-im-a-trash-for-them-3</a> <br/></p><p>Thank you so much for reading!<br/></p>",

In\nfact, they were celebrating because it was the first time in years, they had\nsuch an uneventful period: all transactions matched the books and not a single\nfile was missing. </p><p>Haida, Retsuko and Fenneko were sitting together. Booze and\ndelicious snacks kept coming and the conversation was fluid and full of\nlaughter. Retsuko and Haida were almost past the awkwardness of Haida\u2019s\nconfession from last year. It has been a long ride for both of them. Haida\ndidn\u2019t want to give up just yet, but he didn\u2019t know exactly how to start again\nthat conversation.</p><p>Retsuko was very confused lately. She turned down Haida\u2019s\nfeelings and was sure she did the right thing. But nowadays she was feeling\nvery restless around him even though there wasn\u2019t a reason to do so. Haida was\nvery respectful of her decision, he was careful not to bring the subject\nanymore. Also, he was still a good friend, Retsuko knew that at first was\ndifficult, but after a while everything went back to normal. And that was starting\nto annoy her a little bit even if she didn\u2019t know why. </p><p>It was almost 2 in the morning. Retsuko was feeling drunk,\nbut she was having a good time. Fenneko and Haida too, they were singing\nkaraoke together and pouring each other drinks. They had this amazing\nfriendship\u2026 she knew that even though Fenneko and Haida weren\u2019t in love or\nanything, they were there for each other and trust each other in a way Retsuko\nand Haida could never be. She was feeling a little lonely but most of all\u2026\njealous. </p><p>Retsuko stood up, a little too sudden. Fenneko and Haida\nnoticed immediately. </p><p>Fenneko: Naa, Retsuko? Are you feeling ok? </p><p>Retsuko: Hi, hi. Don\u2019t worry I\u2019m just\u2026 I just want to go\nto the restroom. </p><p>Fenneko: Want me tagging along? </p><p>Retsuko: No, no. That\u2019s okey. I can do it myself. I\u2019ll be\nright back. </p><p>Retsuko disappeared behind the shoji. Her walking was\nclearly of a drunk person. She even apologized to Komiya when she stepped on\nhis tail. </p><p> Haida was worried\nabout her. His face said more than he wanted to. But he was afraid. Maybe\nRetsuko would feel uncomfortable if he helps her, or maybe he could no longer\nkeep his feelings to himself in his drunken state. \u00a0</p><p>Fenneko: How troublesome you are! Go help Retsuko. </p><p>Haida: Ah! \u2013 his thoughts were suddenly interrupted by Fenneko.\nHe tried to fake a smile and invent an excuse- what are\u2026</p><p>Fenneko: Don\u2019t lie to me Haida, you suck at it anyway.\nRetsuko is drunk and vulnerable. You should help her. It doesn\u2019t mean something\nbad will happen. Just\u2026 be there. </p><p>\u201cFenneko was right\u201d Haida thought. He was still in love with\nher, but that doesn\u2019t mean that Retsuko wasn\u2019t her friend too and he was\nworried something bad happen to her. He decided to wait for her outside the\nrestroom. Make sure she was ok and return to the party. </p><p>Retsuko was inside the restroom. She was feeling more drunk\nthan before. But she decided to stay there a little longer before going out.\nSeeing Haida and Fenneko together made her feel uncomfortable. But more than\nthat\u2026 it made her a little sad. Something was pressuring her heart and she suddenly\nfelt that she wanted to go home. She decided to check her cellphone. She saw a\nmessage from Fenneko but, decided to ignore her. She looked for photos of\nHaida. It was weird. She couldn\u2019t find any recent photos with him, but his\nimage was clear in her head. She suddenly remembered his kind green eyes, his\ncrooked laugh and his thin and tall body. And after a while of looking for a\nphoto she just stopped and closed her eyes. Haida was clear on her mind, every\ndetail of him every spot on his face or his white hands. And a warm familiar\nfeeling came to her heart. </p><p>When Retsuko opened her eyes, she felt like hours had\npassed. She decided to go outside. Maybe people will start to get worried and\nif she wanted to go home, she could do it right now. </p><p>Retsuko step outside the restroom. She was feeling a\nlittle less drunk, but her feelings were a mess. She wanted to get out of there\nbut then\u2026 she saw him. </p><p>Haida was waiting for Retsuko outside. He was leaning in the\nwall with his eyes closed, just trying to keep it together. Maybe he was more\ndrunk than he imagined. He thought: \u201cJust make sure Restuko is okey, get back\nto the party together and then say goodbye\u201d.</p><p>Retsuko saw Haida first. Her heart started to beat so loud. Her\nface was red, but not only because of the booze, she was clearly flustered.\nHaida opened his eyes a bit after. He saw Retsuko and smiled gently. </p><p>Haida: Hey, Retsuko? How are you feeling? \u00a0Do you want to go back?</p><p>Haida then noticed something\u2026 Retsuko was very nervous. Her\neyes avoided him, and her face was red. He wasn\u2019t sure what to believe, he was\nalso drunk after all, maybe it was a misunderstanding. He saw Retsuko getting\ncloser to him. Haida didn\u2019t move at all. He was nervous but just couldn\u2019t say\nanything. </p><p>Finally, Retsuko put herself in front of him and looked Haida\nin the eyes. She knew she was drunk, but at the same time the other feelings\nwere so real. She was jealous about Fenneko back there, she was feeling warm\nand fuzzy when looking at Haida. She took a step closer to him and touched his\nface.</p><p>Haida was having trouble to keep it together. He felt his\nheart was going to explode after Retsuko touched his face. He thought: \u201cMaybe I\nshould stand up, or maybe I should light the mood\u2026\u201d. But then it suddenly hit\nhim. There was no doubt in his mind\u2026Retsuko was looking at him like she was\nabout to\u2026 </p><p>Haida: Re- Retsuko? Are you sure? You\u2019re drunk\u2026</p><p>Retsuko was startled a little by Haida\u2019s question. She just\nwanted some time to figure things out, but it was no longer possible. She liked\nhim\u2026 She wanted to kiss him and Haida knew. But he wasn\u2019t pulling away or\nstopping her. He wanted it too. Haida put his hands around her waist, Retsuko\nfelt a jolt through her body, she closed her eyes, she reached Haida\u2019s face\nwith hers.</p><p>Retsuko whispered: Yes\u2026</p><p>Retsuko nervously kissed him and Haida reciprocated. It was\na gentle kiss\u2026 Haida firmly kept his hands around her waist. He was lost in\ntheir first kiss. It wasn\u2019t how he thought would happen\u2026 but it felt better\nthan he had imagined. Retsuko lips were sweet and small. He felt real happiness\nafter a long time of keeping his feelings at bay. He was relieved, but also\nanxious. How long would it last? \u00a0</p><p>Retsuko was feeling dizzy. Her\nheartbeat was violent, she heard his too. Their lips were intertwined. Her head\nwas spinning in a million of thoughts. Haida\u2019s scent was comforting. She kissed\nscared at first, but then she felt something growing inside of her, like a\nlittle rush. She was sway away by the feeling. </p><p>Haida was almost possessed. He kissed Retsuko\u2019s lips, over and over. He smiled a little and\nkissed her cheeks, too. His eyes were shut, but he no longer needed to pick and\nsee her. His senses were taking all of Retsuko.</p><p>\n\nRetsuko was happy but curious too\u2026 She has never\nbeen in such a kiss before, with a guy she really liked, and it was a \nlittle too\noverwhelming. It was a very weird feeling, but she wanted to lick \nHaida\u2019s lips\u2026 just a little. So, she opened her mouth and did it. <br></p><p>Haida\n was taken by surprise. He was no longer in control of himself. He stood\n up, cornered Retsuko swiftly to the wall in front of him and lifted her\n up on the little table in the hall. Retsuko\u2019s saw Haida standing in \nfront of her, almost his same height. He took Retsuko\u2019s face in his \nhands and kissed her, but this time, passionately.</p><p>Retsuko no \nlonger cared if someone saw them, their drunken state, or their \ncomplicated relationship. She \u00a0was keeping his pace. She could no longer\n breath, nor she cared. She wanted to embrace the feeling and pulled \nHaida closer. <br></p><p>After what seemed like an eternity, Haida knew \nhe needed to stop it, right now. This was no longer an awkward little \nkiss they could ignore. They needed to talk right now and he could ruin \neverything by letting his passion take the better of him. He broke their\n long kiss, almost breathless and with his lips hurting. Their feelings \nwere a mess.</p><p>Haida: Wanna get out of here\u2026?</p><p>Retsuko nodded in response.</p><p>END PART 1</p><p>If you want to check the fanart go here: <a href=\"http://faylink.tumblr.com/post/181678173967/aggretsuko-fanart-because-im-a-trash-for-them-3\">http://faylink.tumblr.com/post/181678173967/aggretsuko-fanart-because-im-a-trash-for-them-3</a> <br></p><p>Thank you so much for reading!<br></p>",
