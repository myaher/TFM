        "body": "<p>Okay, wow! \nThis movie was unbelievable! \nRemember how we can all pretty much agree that <i>The Last Jedi</i> had moments that kinda fell flat? \u00a0Well, I think I figured out the reason\nwhy. \u00a0It was because they were putting\nall their effort into this movie. \u00a0Now,\njust to warn everyone- because this is a review, I WILL be spoiling the plot of\nthis movie. \u00a0So if you plan on reading\nbeyond this point before you actually go see the movie yourself, then that\u2019s on\nyou.</p><!-- more --><p>The movie opens on some run-down planet called Corellia,\nwhere this giant sentient millipede-like alien called Lady Proxima essentially\nruns the show. \u00a0Because of the corruption\nthat now runs rampant after the formation of the Galactic Empire, a lot of\ncrime syndicates have been able to take root, and Lady Proxima is no\nexception. \u00a0She runs this thieves guild\non Corellia where she basically abducts children and forces them to steal stuff\nfor her in exchange for food and shelter. \nRight away, we are shown that the teenaged Han is one of the young\nthieves under Lady Proxima\u2019s control. \nUnfortunately, the latest mission he was sent on, which involved\ndelivering a cache of coaxium, a highly valued kind of fuel in exchange for\nmoney, didn\u2019t exactly go well and he was forced to run for his life, leaving\nthe money he was supposed to retrieve behind. \nHowever, he did manage to swipe a small vial of coaxium for himself. \u00a0He shows this to his girlfriend, Qi'ra, who\nalso lives under Lady Proxima\u2019s thumb. \nHan states that he plans to trade the vial of coaxium for passage off\nCorellia for the both of them, so they can live in freedom. \u00a0Han also reveals his aspiration to be a top-notch\npilot with his own ship, a goal he plans to achieve once he and Qi\u2019ra escape\nCorellia and Lady Proxima.</p><p>Before Han could put his plan into action,\nhowever Lady Proxima\u2019s goons appear, apprehending Han. \u00a0He\u2019s forcibly taken before Lady Proxima, who\nis not pleased that Han failed his most recent mission by not bringing her the\nmoney he was supposed to pick up. \u00a0As\npunishment for his transgression, she is all set to have him whipped and beaten\nuntil he learns his lesson and starts being completely obedient to her. \u00a0This prompts Qi\u2019ra to try and come to his\ndefense, but Han comes up with a plan on the spot. \u00a0He threatens to blow everyone up with a\nthermal detonator that he just happened to have on him. \u00a0(Which was an obvious callback to that one\nscene in <i>Return of the Jedi</i>. \u00a0You all know the one I mean.) \u00a0Of course, Lady Proxima isn\u2019t stupid and\nrealizes that Han is just holding a rock. \nBut Han just basically shrugs and hurls the rock up at the roof, which\ncreates a large hole that sunlight pours through. \u00a0Lady Proxima, it turns out, does not like the\nlight, as contact with the sunlight will give her an instant sunburn, and thus\nhas no choice but to retreat into her water-filled chamber.</p><p>Taking advantage of the resulting turmoil, Han\ngrabs hold of Qi\u2019ra and the pair attempt to make their getaway, utilizing a\nland speeder Han had commandeered in the first scene of the movie. \u00a0After a whole car chase scene, Han and Qi\u2019ra\nmanage to make it to Corellia\u2019s spaceport, which is filled with people trying\nto make it off the planet by boarding a transport that\u2019s scheduled to leave\nsoon. \u00a0Right away, it\u2019s established that\nthis is a risky place to be, as a lot of the people there are trying to sneak\noff the planet to freedom, with Imperial Guards and Stormtroopers standing at\nthe ready to apprehend people who don\u2019t have the proper documentation. \u00a0At one point, we even see a group of children\nbeing forcibly separated from their parents. \n(Not sure if this was meant to be taken as social commentary with\npolitical subtext, but it was still unsettling to witness.) \u00a0Trying to act casual, Han and Qi\u2019ra get into\nthe ticket agent line, all too aware of the fact that Lady Proxima\u2019s goons are\nsearching the premises for them. \u00a0When\nit\u2019s their turn to present their travel papers to the Imperial Guard on duty,\nHan admits they don\u2019t have any, but manages to bribe the guard with the vial of\ncoaxium, stating that they\u2019ll hand it over to her if they\u2019re allowed through\nthe gates. \u00a0Unable to resist the bribe,\nthe Imperial Guard opens the gate to allow them through. \u00a0But just as the pair are in the process of\nwalking through the gate, Lady Proxima\u2019s goons appear out of nowhere and\napprehend Qi\u2019ra, just as the gates slam shut. \nAs such, she and Han are forcibly separated, and Han can only watch as\nQi\u2019ra is dragged off. \u00a0As she\u2019s taken\naway, Han calls out to her, vowing that he will come back for her as soon as he\ncan.</p><p>However, before he can uphold his promise, Han\nrealizes that he\u2019s going to need a ship of his own. \u00a0In the hopes of earning enough money to\npurchase a ship, he ends up volunteering to join the Empire by enlisting in\nImperial Navy. \u00a0When he goes to the\nrecruitment office, he confesses to the Imperial Recruitment Officer that he\nhas no surname. \u00a0As such, the Recruitment\nOfficer decides to give him the name Han Solo.</p><p>The action then fast-forwards to three years\nlater. \u00a0Han is now serving as an\ninfantryman and is placed among an Imperial squadron fighting on an extremely\nmuddy planet called Mimban. \u00a0It comes out\nthat he was kicked out of the Imperial Flight Academy due to an inability to\nfollow orders without question. \u00a0Now, it\nmight just have been me, but for some reason, the whole battlefront on Mimban\nmade me think of World War One, and the whole trench warfare they utilized. \u00a0Though I\u2019m not sure if that was intentional.</p><p>While he\u2019s on Mimban, Han spots a small group\namong the infantrymen. \u00a0Right away, he is\nable to surmise that they\u2019re actually impostors who infiltrated the infantry in\norder to steal one of the dropships, particularly when one of them doesn\u2019t seem\nto realize that his uniform indicates he\u2019s the highest ranking soldier among\nthem until it\u2019s directly pointed out to him. \nHan ends up confronting them about this, attempting to blackmail them\ninto letting him join them when they make their way off the planet. \u00a0However, the leader of the group, Tobias\nBeckett, ends up having Han arrested for attempted desertion instead, telling\nthe arresting officers that Han is a liar and that they shouldn\u2019t believe a\nword he says. \u00a0Which pretty much takes\ncare of Han\u2019s threats to expose them as impostors.</p><p>The arresting officers sentence Han to be fed\nto the \u2018beast\u2019 they have been keeping imprisoned. \u00a0When Han is tossed into grate covered pit,\nit\u2019s revealed, to nobody\u2019s shock, that the \u2018beast\u2019 is actually Chewbacca. \u00a0Initially, Chewbacca doesn\u2019t hesitate to\nattack Han, possibly embittered by how long the Imperial Army has kept him\nstarved and chained up. \u00a0But he instantly\nrelents when Han reveals that he can speak Wookiee. \u00a0At least, to an extent. \u00a0Han isn\u2019t exactly fluent in Chewbacca\u2019s\nnative language, but he knows enough to convey his plan of escape to Chewbacca. \u00a0Han\u2019s plan involves them staging a fight for\nthe entertainment of the Imperial Officers that are overseeing the proceedings.\nBut instead of punching Han, Chewbacca will be hitting the support beam that is\nholding up the grate covering the opening of the pit. \u00a0The plan ultimately succeeds, enabling Han\nand Chewbacca to climb out. \u00a0But the pair\nare still chained together, which leads to a brief argument of which direction\nthey\u2019ll head off in. In the end, Han convinces Chewbacca to trust him, stating\nthat he has friends that are in the process of leaving Mimban. \u00a0All they have to do is continue their\nalliance long enough reach their shuttle before they leave. \u00a0After that, they\u2019d be free to go their\nseparate ways at any time. \u00a0Chewbacca\nends up agreeing to that plan, and two hurry off to try and catch up to Tobias\nand his team. \u00a0They arrive at the launch\npad just in time to see Tobias\u2019 ship taking off, but when Tobias and his allies\nsee that Han has managed to get away, and is now accompanied by a Wookiee, it\u2019d\ndecided that they will allow the pair to board the ship. \u00a0More specifically, Tobias and the group\u2019s\nAlien member, Rio, (who apparently has a deep appreciation for Wookiees) decide\nit\u2019s a good idea. \u00a0The female of the\ntrio, Val, isn\u2019t exactly on board with admitting a pair of rookies into their\noperation, but she ultimately goes along with it, realizing that she\u2019s\noutvoted.</p><p>Now that Han and Chewbacca have joined Tobias\u2019\nteam, they are informed of their plan to pull off a train heist in order to make\noff with a shipment of that fuel source, coaxium. \u00a0The night before their heist, the group has\nthis whole campfire bonding moment, with Han stating that his ultimate goal is\nstill the same as it was at the start of the movie. \u00a0He wants to earn enough money to buy a ship,\nso he can return to Corellia and save Qi\u2019ra. \nThis scene also serves to inform the audience that, after the rise of\nthe Galactic Empire, the Imperial Forces managed to overthrow Kashyyyk, and a\ngood number of Wookiees were taken prisoner. \nIt\u2019s stated that Chewbacca\u2019s family, or at least his tribe, were among\nthe captured Wookies, so his ultimate goal is to find them and free them. \u00a0Apart from those character development\nmoments, nothing much else happens during this scene. \u00a0But it is indicated that Tobias and Val are\nromantically involved.</p><p>The following morning, Han, Chewbacca, Tobias,\nVal and Rio proceed with their train heist. \nHowever, the robbery is interrupted by the appearance of a band of space\npirates called the Cloud Riders, who are led by an armored figure known as\nEnfys Nest. \u00a0This leads to a whole action\nsequence, in which both groups try to claim the coaxium. \u00a0Due in part to the interference of the Cloud\nRiders, Val and Rio are both killed. \nAnd, when Han, Tobias and Chewbacca try to make off with the spoils, Han\nends up defying Tobias orders and releases the cargo, resulting in it getting\ndestroyed. \u00a0This was because the Cloud\nRiders also had attached tethers to the crate of coaxium, resulting in them\nhaving a tug-of-war of sorts. \u00a0And Han\nrealized that if he didn\u2019t release their hold on the coaxium, then he wouldn\u2019t\nbe able to maneuver their ship around a mountain in time. \u00a0So it was pretty much a choice between the\ncoaxium and their lives. \u00a0Honestly, I\nthink that decision was very much in character for Han. \u00a0Isn\u2019t that what will one day get him into\ntrouble with Jabba?</p><p>On a side note, I have to admit I <i>really</i> liked Rio. \u00a0I thought he was a fun character, especially\nwith his strange love for Wookiees. \u00a0It\nwas a bit like Maz from the new trilogy. \nThe moment he first appeared, I instantly decided that I liked him. \u00a0So it really stinks that he was killed off\nafter such a short amount of screentime. \nShame we couldn\u2019t see more of him.</p><p>In the aftermath of the failed heist, Tobias\nrounds on Han, angrily punching him for losing the coaxium. \u00a0Here, it\u2019s revealed that Tobias and his late\nteammates weren\u2019t actually stealing the coaxium for themselves. \u00a0Instead, they had been hired by Drydon Vos,\nthe leader of a criminal syndicate known as the Crimson Dawn. \u00a0Now that the crate of coaxium is lost, Tobias\nis fearful for his life, as Drydon Vos is not known to be very understanding or\nforgiving. \u00a0And he knows that he won\u2019t be\nable to run, as Drydon Vos would undoubtedly succeed in locating him, no matter\nwhere he might try to hide. \u00a0In the hopes\nof convincing Drydon Vos to give him another chance, Tobias ends up going to\nseek an audience with him on the mob boss\u2019 space yacht. \u00a0But before he leaves, Tobias informs Han and\nChewbacca that this will be their last chance to get out of this mess. \u00a0Because Drydon Vos currently has no idea that\neither of them even exist and will never know they were even involved with this\nif they back out now. \u00a0But Han insists on\nseeing this through to the end, as he knows he can\u2019t pass up on this chance to\nget the money for this job. \u00a0Chewbacca\nalso agrees to stick around. \u00a0Maybe\nbecause he feels that this would eventually help him locate the other Wookiees\nthat were abducted and taken away from Kashyyyk.</p><p>When they arrive at Drydon Vos\u2019 space yacht,\nTobias announces their presence to one of Drydon Vos\u2019 goons. \u00a0While waiting around to be summoned, Tobias\nand Chewbacca head off to get some drinks at the bar while Han decides to make\nhis way to the edge of the crowd to simply look out the window. \u00a0But then, someone approaches him and taps his\nshoulder. \u00a0To Han\u2019s shock and amazement,\nhe sees the person who has joined him at the window is none other than Qi\u2019ra,\nhis girlfriend from Corellia! \u00a0Han is\noverjoyed to see her again, and he immediately starts to apologize for not\ncoming back for her, stating that he really had planned on doing so the moment\nhe\u2019d been able to buy his own ship. \u00a0But\nQi\u2019ra waves away his apology, stating that it\u2019s all in the past and she doesn\u2019t\nresent him for not being able to keep his promise to her, also pointing out\nthat he would have been killed if he hadn\u2019t taken advantage of his chance to\nget off Corellia. \u00a0It turns out that,\nafter she and Han were separated three years ago, Qi\u2019ra somehow became\nentangled into the Crimson Dawn and is essentially bound to Drydon Vos now.</p><p>But the two are not given much of a chance to\ncatch up, because that\u2019s when Tobias returns, announcing their meeting with\nDrydon Vos has been approved. \u00a0Needless\nto say, Drydon Vos is not pleased when he finds out Tobias did not bring the\nshipment of coaxium that he\u2019d requested and is all set to kill him for this,\nunless Tobias can tell him exactly how he plans to make it up to him. \u00a0Tobias therefore offers to locate and steal\nsome coaxium from a different source. \u00a0Of\ncourse, this is easier said than done as coaxium is still super-rare, with the\nEmpire holding a cartel on the market. \nBut Han has an idea- they go right to the source and steal unprocessed\ncoaxium from the mines on the planet Kessel. \nOf course, this is an extremely risky plan, as unprocessed coaxium is\nextremely volatile, and if it\u2019s not processed within a certain time frame, then\nit will explode. \u00a0Once again, however,\nHan has an idea. \u00a0There\u2019s apparently a\nprocessing plant that\u2019s not controlled by the Empire, located on the planet\nSavareen. \u00a0Although this plan is still\nextremely risky, as it would require them to make the infamous Kessel Run in\nless than twenty parsecs. \u00a0And yes, I\nknow that a parsec is a unit of distance and not time. \u00a0But maybe the implication is that the average\nKessel Run spans a distance that\u2019s over twenty parsecs, and to make the journey\nin less than twenty parsects is synonymous with finding a way to travel from\nMaine to California (a trip that should span 3,247 miles) in only 1,000\nmiles. \u00a0But then again, this is just me\ntrying to make sense over a line that was probably only meant to give nerds\nsomething to harp on.</p><p>In any event, Drydon Vos ultimately agrees to\nHan\u2019s plan and, in what I\u2019m guessing was an attempt to make sure that Tobias,\nHan and Chewbacca follow through and don\u2019t just try to run, he has Qi\u2019ra\naccompany them. \u00a0But before they can go\noff to steal the coaxium, they have to locate a suitably fast ship that would\nenable them to make the trip. \nFortunately, Qi\u2019ra knows where to find such a ship. \u00a0She leads the group to this place on a snowy\nplanet called Vandor that kinda looks like a crashed luxury starship that has\nbeen converted into a gambling hall. \nThere, they encounter the smooth-talking Lando Calrissian, who boasts\nthat his ship is the fastest one in existence. \nHe\u2019s accompanied by L3-37, a female Piloting Droid that Lando apparently\nhad custom made to be his co-pilot. While I\u2019m sure some people might disagree\nwith me on this, I say L3 was the best character in this movie. \u00a0Her claim to fame was the fact that she\u2019s a\nfierce advocate for Droid rights. \u00a0When\nwe first meet her, she\u2019s angrily protesting a Droid battle ring that\u2019s being\nheld in the gambling hall, trying to reason with one of the Droids being used\nin the fighting and then getting into an argument with the Droid\u2019s owner. \u00a0 To be honest, I totally see her point in\nregards to her crusade. \u00a0Even though\nDroids are clearly manmade, they are still programed with artificial\nintelligence, and they all seem to have their own personalities. \u00a0It does present an interesting debate over\nwhat it means to be considered \u2018alive.\u2019 \nAnd when you think of it, there does seem to be a prevailing\ndiscrimination towards Droids. \u00a0For\ninstance, it seems like a lot of eateries won\u2019t serve Droids. \u00a0And then there\u2019s Obi-Wan\u2019s comment in <i>Attack of the Clones</i>, in which he more\nor less stated that he didn\u2019t thing Droids were capable of independent\nthought. \u00a0So, it could be argued that\nDroids are largely treated as robot slaves in the Star Wars universe, with each\ntype of Droid being automatically assigned a particular task from the moment\nthey\u2019re activated and never given the opportunity to rise above the task they\nwere issued upon their creation. \u00a0For\ninstance, I don\u2019t recall seeing any Droids serving on the Galactic Senate\nduring the prequel trilogy.</p><p>Anyway, Han approaches Lando, with Tobias,\nChewbacca and Qi\u2019ra watching with the rest of the crowd, to ask him about his\nship. \u00a0Lando states he won it in a game\nof Sabacc, which is basically this world\u2019s equivalent to poker. \u00a0Han kinda chuckles at that, vocally wondering\nwhat kind of man bets his ship in a card game. \nEventually, he asks to be dealt into the game of Sabacc that Lando is\ncurrently playing with a handful of Aliens. \nNow, the build up to this moment is rather strange. \u00a0Because before this scene, we had been given\nno sort of context as to what Han\u2019s gambling skill is like. \u00a0Is he actually really good when it comes to\ngambling? \u00a0Has he ever gambled or played\nSabacc before? \u00a0But I guess he\u2019s quite\ngood, because he manages to stay in the game after everyone else has folded. \u00a0So, in the end, it\u2019s just him against\nLando. \u00a0In the final round, Lando ends up\nwagering his ship, which, of course, ends up being the Millennium Falcon. \u00a0To counter this wager, Han also bets his own\nship. \u00a0Which we know doesn\u2019t actually\nexist. \u00a0However, Lando ends up winning\nthe game because he was cheating by hiding a stash of cards up his sleeve. \u00a0After the game, Lando approaches the group to\nask where he can pick up the ship he supposedly won off of Han. \u00a0Only to be told that it wasn\u2019t there. \u00a0 As a consolation prize, they fill him in on\ntheir plan to steal unprocessed coaxium from the mines on Kessel. \u00a0They tell Lando that if he provides his ship\nfor the heist, then they will give him a cut of the money they\u2019ll get for the\ncoaxium. \u00a0Lando doesn\u2019t seem to be\ncompletely thrilled with this arrangement, but he ultimately agrees to it,\nespecially when he sees Tobias is involved. \nApparently, Tobias had previously brought about the death of somebody\nLando owed a lot of money to, so Lando is grateful towards him for indirectly\nfreeing him from his debt.</p><p>And they\u2019re off to Kessel. \u00a0Along the way, we get a few scenes of the\ncharacters just being characters. \u00a0Qi\u2019ra\nis exploring the Falcon, finding that Lando seems to have a thing for\ncapes. \u00a0She also has a moment with Han\nwhich leads to them passionately making out, only for them to be interrupted by\nTobias, who counsels Han that he\u2019d do well to not trust Qi\u2019ra so much, and that\nit\u2019s best to just expect everyone might betray him. \u00a0Tobias and Chewbacca also play around with\nthat holographic chess board thing (with Chewbacca losing, much to his\nfrustration.) \u00a0And we also get a whole\n\u2018girl talk\u2019 moment with Qi\u2019ra and L3, with L3 observing that Han is still in\nlove with Qi\u2019ra. \u00a0It\u2019s at this point that\nwe\u2019re told that Lando and L3\u2019s relationship is a bit more than just one between\npilot and co-pilot, and it\u2019s heavily implied they have a sexual\nrelationship. \u00a0So I guess Lando is\npansexual? \u00a0Okay, that\u2019s pretty\ninteresting. \u00a0I don\u2019t think we see many\npansexual characters featured in the media, do we?</p><p>Eventually, they reach Kessel and, in order to\ninfiltrate the mine, Qi\u2019ra, Tobias and L3 masquerade as human traffickers and\npresent Han and Chewbacca as new workers for the mine. \u00a0And you might notice that Tobias is wearing\nthe same disguise Lando will eventually wear in the first half of <i>Return of the Jedi</i>. \u00a0Speaking of Lando, he\u2019s apparently hanging\nback on the Millennium Falcon to make another entry in his personal \u2018Lando\nChronicles.\u2019 \u00a0I guess we\u2019re supposed to\nconclude that Lando is a bit full of himself.</p><p>Upon being brought into the mines, Han and\nChewbacca both reveal that their restraints were not locked, and they\nimmediately break free and overpower the two guards bringing them down the mine\nelevator \u00a0(with Chewbacca actually\nripping off somebody\u2019s arms.) \u00a0Meanwhile,\nup in the control room, Qi\u2019ra gets to work on upholding her part of the plan,\nwhich involves her and Tobias taking out the mine foreman and guards so L3\ncould take over the control room\u2019s console, in order to gain access to the\nmine\u2019s security footage and use that to direct Han and Chewbacca to the chamber\nthe coaxium is stored in. \u00a0However, in\nthe process, L3 finds she can\u2019t stand to turn a blind eye to the fact that\nDroids are being used to run the mine, especially when she spots a restraining\nbolt affixed to one of the Astromech Droids. \nShe ends up starting a complete riot by getting the Droids to free one\nother, which leads to all the other mine workers rising up and attempting to\nfight their way to freedom. \u00a0Thankfully,\nthis creates a distraction that makes it possible for Han to locate the coaxium\nvault. \u00a0Amidst the resulting turmoil, Han\nstarts to wheel them out to the Millennium Falcon. \u00a0Chewbacca, on the other hand, briefly went\noff on his own when he spots some Wookiees laboring in the mines because he\nrecognized them as some of the Wookiees that were captured alongside him. \u00a0But he ends up rejoining Han just in time to\nhelp him get the coaxium to the Millennium Falcon, with the other Wookiees\nhelping load the canisters onto the ship. \nAnd, when given the choice between staying with his Wookiee brethren or\nsticking with Han and the others, Chewbacca ultimately chooses the latter. \u00a0Most likely because he\u2019s grown to genuinely\nconsider Han as a friend.</p><p>This whole prison break/coaxium heist quickly\nshifts into a huge gun battle as the mine workers try to escape. \u00a0During the fight, L3 gets gunned down and Lando\nis also hit when he runs out to retrieve her. \nSadly, while Lando only ends up with an injured shoulder, L3 is damaged\nbeyond repair and ends up dying in Lando\u2019s arms.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>With Lando out of commission and L3 gone, Han\nand Chewbacca (who admits to have gained some piloting experience during the\n190 years he\u2019s been alive) are the only ones capable of flying the ship away\nfrom Kessel. \u00a0Unfortunately, their path\nback to Savareen is being blocked by an Imperial brigade, led by a Star\nDestroyer that immediately sends a fleet of TIE Fighters at them. \u00a0It\u2019s speculated that the Imperial patrol had\nheard about the uprising on Kessel and had come to put an end to it. \u00a0While they eventually manage to get rid of\nthe TIE Fighters, through a combination of Tobias manning the ship\u2019s gun and a\nrisky move by Han, they realize they lost a considerable amount of time, as the\ncoaxium is already starting to destabilize. \nIn a desperate attempt at making it to Savareen in time, Han suggests\ntaking a short cut through a cloudy \u2018tunnel\u2019 inside the nebula cloud they\u2019re\ntraveling past. \u00a0At first, everyone feels\nthis is crazy, as entering that cloud tunnel would most likely kill them, as it\ncontains a high number of plasma storms. \nBut Han points out that their current position is no better. \u00a0In order to try and increase their chances at\nmaking through alive, it\u2019s decided to install the memory banks/navigational\narchives of L3 into the Millennium Falcon\u2019s motherboard. \u00a0It was established earlier that L3 was\nprogramed with impeccable navigational skills. \nOnce L3\u2019s programing is fully installed within the Millennium Falcon,\nthey are able to navigate their way through the nebula cloud tunnel, despite\nsome trouble with a Space Kraken and a black hole of some kind. \u00a0They evade the Space Kraken by launching off\nthe Millennium Falcon\u2019s escape pod to create a diversion (which explains why\nthe front of the ship wound up with that recognizable shape.) \u00a0And to escape the black hole, they use a single\ndrop of the coaxium to power the ship\u2019s fusion reactor resulting in the\nMillennium Falcon getting a major speed boost that frees it from the pull of\nthe black hole</p><p>Finally, they manage to make it to\nSavareen. \u00a0And thanks to Han\u2019s plan to\ntravel through the nebula cloud and L3\u2019s memory within the Millennium Falcon,\nthey made the Kessel Run in 12 parsects. \nWhile they\u2019re getting the coaxium processed, and for Drydon Vos to\narrive, Han and Qi\u2019ra have another scene together. \u00a0Han tries to convince Qi\u2019ra to come away with\nhim when this is all over, but Qi\u2019ra tells him that\u2019s not possible due to her\ninvolvement with the Crimson Dawn. \u00a0I\nguess the implication is that the Crimson Dawn is like the Mafia- once you\u2019re\nin it, you\u2019re in it for life. \u00a0She tells\nHan that his feelings for her would change if he had any inking of the things\nshe\u2019s done as part of the Crimson Dawn. \nWhich I guess is meant to imply that she was utilized as their hit\nwoman, tasked with brutally murdering anyone they ordered her to. \u00a0If that\u2019s the case, I can see why Qi\u2019ra\nwouldn\u2019t feel as if she\u2019s worthy of Han anymore, as he displays signs\nthroughout the movie that he has a strong moral compass and would never kill\nsomeone senselessly.</p><p>Anyway, their conversation is interrupted when\nthe Cloud Riders once again appear. \nThey\u2019ve been secretly tailing them throughout the movie. \u00a0At first, Han tries to bluff his way out of\nthe situation, telling Enfys Nest that they have an entire armada on board the Millennium\nFalcon, waiting for his signal to attack them, but that bluff is quickly\ndeflated when Lando, who had slunk back to the Millennium Falcon earlier, flies\noff, leaving Han, Tobias, Chewbacca and Qi\u2019ra stranded. \u00a0But this is when the first twist of the movie\ncomes. \u00a0When Han and company state that\nDrydon Vos is on his way to claim the coaxium, Enfys Nest reveals herself as a\nyoung teenage girl. \u00a0It turns out she and\nher band all were survivors of clans that the Crimson Dawn attacked and\nslaughtered. \u00a0And that the reason why\nthey\u2019ve been attacking and tailing the protagonists is because they knew that\nDrydon Vos would only use the coaxium to lay waste to even more villages, and they\u2019d\nwanted to prevent him from doing so. \u00a0In\nother words, the Cloud Riders were the good guys the whole time.</p><p>Han, upon hearing Enfys Nest\u2019s backstory,\nbegins to feel sympathetic to her and her group. \u00a0As a result, he decides to double cross\nDrydon Vos by giving him vials of fake coaxium while giving the real stuff to\nthe Cloud Riders. \u00a0When he reveals this\nplan to Tobias, the older man decides that he\u2019s not going to stick around as\nthe double cross might go wrong. \u00a0Despite\nhis earlier insistence that it\u2019s pointless to run from Drydon Vos, he states\nhe\u2019s going to risk it now. \u00a0However, this\nturns out to be a lie, as it\u2019s later revealed that he was actually going on\nahead to tip Drydon Vos off about the deception. \u00a0So when Han, Chewbacca and Qi\u2019ra bring the\nchest of fake coaxium to the crime boss, he already knows that he\u2019s being\ndeceived, and has even sent his men to ambush the Cloud Riders before they\ncould leave with the coaxium. \u00a0But then,\nHan reveals he\u2019d already anticipated Tobias\u2019 betrayal. \u00a0And as such, when the goons attack the Cloud\nRiders, they only find empty chests. \nBecause the real coaxium is in the chest Han brought to Drydon Vos.</p><p>And this is when the movie gets to be a bit\ndizzying. \u00a0Because once he finds out that\nthe real coaxium is there, Tobias decides to claim it for his own, drawing a\nblaster on everyone. \u00a0He ends up taking\nChewbacca hostage, forcing him to carry the chest of coaxium for him. \u00a0Admittedly, this doesn\u2019t make much\nsense. \u00a0Chewbacca is a Wookiee. \u00a0One we\u2019d previously seen ripping off\nsomeone\u2019s arms. \u00a0You can\u2019t tell me he\ncouldn\u2019t have easily overpowered Tobias here.</p><p>Regardless, Tobias and Chewbacca leave with the\ncoaxium. \u00a0Once they\u2019re gone, a full-on\nfight breaks out between Han and Drydon Vos, with Han using the blaster he\u2019d\ngotten from Tobias earlier in the film and Drydon Vos wielding these molten\nduel knives. \u00a0After this fight sequence\ngoes on for a little bit, Qi\u2019ra enters the fray, seemingly coming to Drydon\nVos\u2019 defense by pointing some kind of split sword at Han. \u00a0But then, she turns on Drydon Vos, stabbing\nhim clean through.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>After Drydon Vos\u2019 death, Qi\u2019ra urges Han to go\nafter Tobias, telling him to get the coaxium to the Cloud Raiders. \u00a0She refrains from going with him, however,\nstating that she\u2019ll catch up to him later. \nHowever, after Han leaves, Qi\u2019ra reveals she has no intention of\nrejoining him, as she takes Drydon\u2019 Vos\u2019 ring, which I suppose was a symbol of\nhis rank in the Crimson Dawn. \u00a0I guess\nthat, now that he\u2019s dead, Qi\u2019ra is taking over his position. \u00a0However, it\u2019s then revealed that Drydon Vos\nwasn\u2019t the highest ranking member of the Crimson Dawn, because Qi\u2019ra uses the\nring to contact the true leader of the criminal syndicate, giving him a cover\nstory that Drydon Vos was killed by Tobias and that she was the only one who\nsurvived the assault. \u00a0At first, the\nidentity of the Crimson Dawn leader is hidden by the hood he was wearing. \u00a0But when the hood is lowered, the mysterious\nfigure is revealed to be Darth Maul.</p><p>Wait, WHAT?! \nBut\u2026<i>how? \u00a0</i>He\u2019s dead! \u00a0We saw him die in <i>Phantom Menace</i>! \u00a0He got\nsliced in two and then fell down a deep pit. \u00a0 \nHow could <i>anyone</i> have survived\nthat?! \u00a0And before anyone can try to\nargue this by saying it could have been a <i>different</i>\nDathomirian? \u00a0No, it\u2019s not. \u00a0It\u2019s Darth Maul. \u00a0I even checked the end credits, and they\nclearly stated that this was indeed Maul. \nHow in Coruscant did this guy survive getting split in half and falling\ndown a bottomless pit? \u00a0Are they going to\ntry and claim Palpatine survived after the events of <i>Return of the Jedi</i>, too?\u00a0 \u00a0Seriously, first it was Red Skull appearing in <i>Infinity War</i>, and now this!\u00a0 I\u2019d like an explanation for this, please!</p><p>Anyway, Darth Maul orders Qi\u2019ra to meet him on\nhis home planet, where he plans to keep a much closer eye on her. \u00a0Whether or not he knows she wasn\u2019t complelty\nhonest with him is anyone\u2019s guess. \nMeanwhile, Han catches up to Tobias and Chewbacca, confronting the\nformer over the matter of the coaxium. \u00a0(Not\nentirely sure how Han managed to get ahead of them as Tobias had a considerable\nhead start, but oh well.) \u00a0In response,\nTobias starts to reach for his blaster, but then makes the mistake of going off\non this whole spiel about how Han needs to learn a lessson. \u00a0Han, however, doesn\u2019t mess around with\nformalities and fatally shoots Tobias. \nWith his final words, Tobias commends Han for not hesitating to do what\nhe had to, also while lamenting that he never got the chance to pursue his\ndream to be a musician.</p><p>In the aftermath of the adventure, Han and\nChewbacca willingly pass the coaxium over to Enfys Nest, who reveals she plans\nto deliver it to the Rebel Alliance. \u00a0She\nsuggests that Han consider joining the resistance himself, but Han declines,\nstating that it\u2019s highly unlikely that he\u2019ll change his mind on the\nmatter. \u00a0Though those who have seen the\noriginal trilogy already know that he\u2019ll eventually change his tune. \u00a0In gratitude for his help, Enfys Nest gifts\nHan and Chewbacca with a small vial of coaxium.</p><p>Later on, Han and Chewbacca manage to locate\nLando again, this time on some kind of lush jungle planet. \u00a0Needless to say, Han is fully ready to give\nLando a piece of his mind about how he\u2019d stranded them all on Savareen. \u00a0But that\u2019s when he catches a brief glimpse of\nthe card dispenser mechanism affixed to Lando\u2019s wrist. \u00a0Right always, he realizes that Lando had\ncheated in their earlier game of Sabacc. \nDeciding to get one up on him, Han challenges Lando to a rematch,\noffering his vial of coaxium as a starting wager. \u00a0Lando readily accepts, not realizing until\nthe final round of their game that Han manages to swipe the cards he was\nconcealing up his sleeve. \u00a0As a result,\nHan is able to win the Millennium Falcon fair and square, a fact that Lando\nbegrudgingly accepts. \u00a0And so, with their\nnewly won ship, Han and Chewbacca set off, deciding to set a course for\nTatooine, as Tobias had mentioned earlier that there was a big shot gangster\nputting together a crew of smugglers on that particular planet. \u00a0While it\u2019s never specifically stated, I\nsuppose we can only conclude they\u2019re referring to Jabba. \u00a0Which explains how Han and Chewbacca got\ninvolved with him in the first place. \nAnd so, the movie ends with the pair flying off, with the Millennium\nFalcon jumping into light speed.</p><p>All in all, I think this was a really good\norigin story for Han Solo. \u00a0And, dare I\nsay it, I actually enjoyed this movie more than <i>The Last Jedi</i>. \u00a0Not that <i>The Last Jedi </i>was an awful movie, of\ncourse. \u00a0But my attitude after seeing\nthat one was more or less \u2018<i>eh, okay, I\nguess I\u2019ll see you guys again in a few years.</i>\u2019 \u00a0With this movie, on the other hand, I really\nwanted to see what happened next. \u00a0What\nhappened to Qi\u2019ra? \u00a0Is she actually a\nSith Lord training under Darth Maul? \u00a0Did\nshe and Han ever see each other again? \u00a0Obviously,\nsomething happens that enables Han to decide to move on from her, considering\nhe eventually pursues a relationship with Leia. \nWhile Han is sometimes seen as a womanizer by some members of the\nfandom, that reputation always seemed rather undeserved, as he appears to be\nmore of a one-woman man. \u00a0So did Qi\u2019ra\nend up dying at some point between now and <i>A\nNew Hope</i>? \u00a0(I suppose it\u2019s possible\nshe ended up horribly betraying him somehow somewhere down the line, but the\nfact that Han obviously held on to the golden pair of dice that they kept\npassing back and forth throughout the movie makes it seem like he still\nregarded her memory with fondness, so I doubt anything went sour between them.\n) Also, is that all there was to the backstory between Han and Lando\u2019s\nfriendship, or did they cross paths a few more times over the years? \u00a0The movie gave us this open ending that left\nyou with a lot of questions, but not to the point where it felt as if the\nplotpoints were left unresolved. \u00a0It\u2019s\nquite rare to find a movie that can achieve that sort of balance. \u00a0Let\u2019s just say that if they turned this movie\ninto a trilogy as well, you certainly wouldn\u2019t hear me complain.</p><p>As for the actor who portrayed the younger\nversion of Han, I think he did a good job. \nObviously, nobody was going to live up to Harrison Ford. \u00a0But there were moments when I looked at Alden\nEhrenreich and I really thought he looked like a younger version of Han. \u00a0And I thought the way they presented this\nyounger version of him to be quite good. \nSure, the Han of the original trilogy made a clear effort at portraying\nhimself as a scoundrel, but at the same time, it was always evident that he was\na good man at his core. \u00a0At the end of the\nday, he was the one who would ultimately do the right thing, because he can\u2019t\ncompletely turn off his moral compass when he sees people in trouble. \u00a0It\u2019s why he came back at the moment of truth\nduring the battle of the first Death Star. \nI also liked how the movie left it rather vague over whether Chewbacca\nwas searching for his family or just his tribe. \nI\u2019m not entirely sure, but I\u2019m pretty sure that bit was made to appeal\nto both the fans who consider the infamous holiday special to be canon and\nthose who refuse to acknowledge its existence. \n(Oh, don\u2019t worry- I\u2019ll post my review to <i>that one</i> on the 22<sup>nd</sup>.)</p><p>Though, I will admit it was a bit off-putting\nthat the two characters I particularly liked- Rio and L3- were both killed\noff. \u00a0Though, at least we have the\nknowledge that L3 will live on in a sense, which does help soften the\nblow. \u00a0She\u2019s now forever a part of the\nMillennium Falcon\u2019s mainframe. \u00a0Though,\neven if she wasn\u2019t, the untimely deaths of my two favorite characters in this\nparticular instalment of the franchise wasn\u2019t enough to taint my enjoyment of\nthe movie. \u00a0After all, character death\nisn\u2019t a foreign concept in these Star Wars anthology movies.</p><p>On that note, <i>Rouge One</i> will be the subject of next week\u2019s review. \u00a0And then, it\u2019s on to the original trilogy. </p><p><a href=\"http://tomeandflickcorner.tumblr.com/post/173577729578/hello-everyone-its-come-to-my-attention-that\">(Click

movie. \u00a0So if you plan on reading\nbeyond this point before you actually go see the movie yourself, then that\u2019s on\nyou.</p>[[MORE]]<p>The movie opens on some run-down planet called Corellia,\nwhere this giant sentient millipede-like alien called Lady Proxima essentially\nruns the show. \u00a0Because of the corruption\nthat now runs rampant after the formation of the Galactic Empire, a lot of\ncrime syndicates have been able to take root, and Lady Proxima is no\nexception. \u00a0She runs this thieves guild\non Corellia where she basically abducts children and forces them to steal stuff\nfor her in exchange for food and shelter. \nRight away, we are shown that the teenaged Han is one of the young\nthieves under Lady Proxima\u2019s control. \nUnfortunately, the latest mission he was sent on, which involved\ndelivering a cache of coaxium, a highly valued kind of fuel in exchange for\nmoney, didn\u2019t exactly go well and he was forced to run for his life, leaving\nthe money he was supposed to retrieve behind. \nHowever, he did manage to swipe a small vial of coaxium for himself. \u00a0He shows this to his girlfriend, Qi'ra, who\nalso lives under Lady Proxima\u2019s thumb. \nHan states that he plans to trade the vial of coaxium for passage off\nCorellia for the both of them, so they can live in freedom. \u00a0Han also reveals his aspiration to be a top-notch\npilot with his own ship, a goal he plans to achieve once he and Qi\u2019ra escape\nCorellia and Lady Proxima.</p><p>Before Han could put his plan into action,\nhowever Lady Proxima\u2019s goons appear, apprehending Han. \u00a0He\u2019s forcibly taken before Lady Proxima, who\nis not pleased that Han failed his most recent mission by not bringing her the\nmoney he was supposed to pick up. \u00a0As\npunishment for his transgression, she is all set to have him whipped and beaten\nuntil he learns his lesson and starts being completely obedient to her. \u00a0This prompts Qi\u2019ra to try and come to his\ndefense, but Han comes up with a plan on the spot. \u00a0He threatens to blow everyone up with a\nthermal detonator that he just happened to have on him. \u00a0(Which was an obvious callback to that one\nscene in <i>Return of the Jedi</i>. \u00a0You all know the one I mean.) \u00a0Of course, Lady Proxima isn\u2019t stupid and\nrealizes that Han is just holding a rock. \nBut Han just basically shrugs and hurls the rock up at the roof, which\ncreates a large hole that sunlight pours through. \u00a0Lady Proxima, it turns out, does not like the\nlight, as contact with the sunlight will give her an instant sunburn, and thus\nhas no choice but to retreat into her water-filled chamber.</p><p>Taking advantage of the resulting turmoil, Han\ngrabs hold of Qi\u2019ra and the pair attempt to make their getaway, utilizing a\nland speeder Han had commandeered in the first scene of the movie. \u00a0After a whole car chase scene, Han and Qi\u2019ra\nmanage to make it to Corellia\u2019s spaceport, which is filled with people trying\nto make it off the planet by boarding a transport that\u2019s scheduled to leave\nsoon. \u00a0Right away, it\u2019s established that\nthis is a risky place to be, as a lot of the people there are trying to sneak\noff the planet to freedom, with Imperial Guards and Stormtroopers standing at\nthe ready to apprehend people who don\u2019t have the proper documentation. \u00a0At one point, we even see a group of children\nbeing forcibly separated from their parents. \n(Not sure if this was meant to be taken as social commentary with\npolitical subtext, but it was still unsettling to witness.) \u00a0Trying to act casual, Han and Qi\u2019ra get into\nthe ticket agent line, all too aware of the fact that Lady Proxima\u2019s goons are\nsearching the premises for them. \u00a0When\nit\u2019s their turn to present their travel papers to the Imperial Guard on duty,\nHan admits they don\u2019t have any, but manages to bribe the guard with the vial of\ncoaxium, stating that they\u2019ll hand it over to her if they\u2019re allowed through\nthe gates. \u00a0Unable to resist the bribe,\nthe Imperial Guard opens the gate to allow them through. \u00a0But just as the pair are in the process of\nwalking through the gate, Lady Proxima\u2019s goons appear out of nowhere and\napprehend Qi\u2019ra, just as the gates slam shut. \nAs such, she and Han are forcibly separated, and Han can only watch as\nQi\u2019ra is dragged off. \u00a0As she\u2019s taken\naway, Han calls out to her, vowing that he will come back for her as soon as he\ncan.</p><p>However, before he can uphold his promise, Han\nrealizes that he\u2019s going to need a ship of his own. \u00a0In the hopes of earning enough money to\npurchase a ship, he ends up volunteering to join the Empire by enlisting in\nImperial Navy. \u00a0When he goes to the\nrecruitment office, he confesses to the Imperial Recruitment Officer that he\nhas no surname. \u00a0As such, the Recruitment\nOfficer decides to give him the name Han Solo.</p><p>The action then fast-forwards to three years\nlater. \u00a0Han is now serving as an\ninfantryman and is placed among an Imperial squadron fighting on an extremely\nmuddy planet called Mimban. \u00a0It comes out\nthat he was kicked out of the Imperial Flight Academy due to an inability to\nfollow orders without question. \u00a0Now, it\nmight just have been me, but for some reason, the whole battlefront on Mimban\nmade me think of World War One, and the whole trench warfare they utilized. \u00a0Though I\u2019m not sure if that was intentional.</p><p>While he\u2019s on Mimban, Han spots a small group\namong the infantrymen. \u00a0Right away, he is\nable to surmise that they\u2019re actually impostors who infiltrated the infantry in\norder to steal one of the dropships, particularly when one of them doesn\u2019t seem\nto realize that his uniform indicates he\u2019s the highest ranking soldier among\nthem until it\u2019s directly pointed out to him. \nHan ends up confronting them about this, attempting to blackmail them\ninto letting him join them when they make their way off the planet. \u00a0However, the leader of the group, Tobias\nBeckett, ends up having Han arrested for attempted desertion instead, telling\nthe arresting officers that Han is a liar and that they shouldn\u2019t believe a\nword he says. \u00a0Which pretty much takes\ncare of Han\u2019s threats to expose them as impostors.</p><p>The arresting officers sentence Han to be fed\nto the \u2018beast\u2019 they have been keeping imprisoned. \u00a0When Han is tossed into grate covered pit,\nit\u2019s revealed, to nobody\u2019s shock, that the \u2018beast\u2019 is actually Chewbacca. \u00a0Initially, Chewbacca doesn\u2019t hesitate to\nattack Han, possibly embittered by how long the Imperial Army has kept him\nstarved and chained up. \u00a0But he instantly\nrelents when Han reveals that he can speak Wookiee. \u00a0At least, to an extent. \u00a0Han isn\u2019t exactly fluent in Chewbacca\u2019s\nnative language, but he knows enough to convey his plan of escape to Chewbacca. \u00a0Han\u2019s plan involves them staging a fight for\nthe entertainment of the Imperial Officers that are overseeing the proceedings.\nBut instead of punching Han, Chewbacca will be hitting the support beam that is\nholding up the grate covering the opening of the pit. \u00a0The plan ultimately succeeds, enabling Han\nand Chewbacca to climb out. \u00a0But the pair\nare still chained together, which leads to a brief argument of which direction\nthey\u2019ll head off in. In the end, Han convinces Chewbacca to trust him, stating\nthat he has friends that are in the process of leaving Mimban. \u00a0All they have to do is continue their\nalliance long enough reach their shuttle before they leave. \u00a0After that, they\u2019d be free to go their\nseparate ways at any time. \u00a0Chewbacca\nends up agreeing to that plan, and two hurry off to try and catch up to Tobias\nand his team. \u00a0They arrive at the launch\npad just in time to see Tobias\u2019 ship taking off, but when Tobias and his allies\nsee that Han has managed to get away, and is now accompanied by a Wookiee, it\u2019d\ndecided that they will allow the pair to board the ship. \u00a0More specifically, Tobias and the group\u2019s\nAlien member, Rio, (who apparently has a deep appreciation for Wookiees) decide\nit\u2019s a good idea. \u00a0The female of the\ntrio, Val, isn\u2019t exactly on board with admitting a pair of rookies into their\noperation, but she ultimately goes along with it, realizing that she\u2019s\noutvoted.</p><p>Now that Han and Chewbacca have joined Tobias\u2019\nteam, they are informed of their plan to pull off a train heist in order to make\noff with a shipment of that fuel source, coaxium. \u00a0The night before their heist, the group has\nthis whole campfire bonding moment, with Han stating that his ultimate goal is\nstill the same as it was at the start of the movie. \u00a0He wants to earn enough money to buy a ship,\nso he can return to Corellia and save Qi\u2019ra. \nThis scene also serves to inform the audience that, after the rise of\nthe Galactic Empire, the Imperial Forces managed to overthrow Kashyyyk, and a\ngood number of Wookiees were taken prisoner. \nIt\u2019s stated that Chewbacca\u2019s family, or at least his tribe, were among\nthe captured Wookies, so his ultimate goal is to find them and free them. \u00a0Apart from those character development\nmoments, nothing much else happens during this scene. \u00a0But it is indicated that Tobias and Val are\nromantically involved.</p><p>The following morning, Han, Chewbacca, Tobias,\nVal and Rio proceed with their train heist. \nHowever, the robbery is interrupted by the appearance of a band of space\npirates called the Cloud Riders, who are led by an armored figure known as\nEnfys Nest. \u00a0This leads to a whole action\nsequence, in which both groups try to claim the coaxium. \u00a0Due in part to the interference of the Cloud\nRiders, Val and Rio are both killed. \nAnd, when Han, Tobias and Chewbacca try to make off with the spoils, Han\nends up defying Tobias orders and releases the cargo, resulting in it getting\ndestroyed. \u00a0This was because the Cloud\nRiders also had attached tethers to the crate of coaxium, resulting in them\nhaving a tug-of-war of sorts. \u00a0And Han\nrealized that if he didn\u2019t release their hold on the coaxium, then he wouldn\u2019t\nbe able to maneuver their ship around a mountain in time. \u00a0So it was pretty much a choice between the\ncoaxium and their lives. \u00a0Honestly, I\nthink that decision was very much in character for Han. \u00a0Isn\u2019t that what will one day get him into\ntrouble with Jabba?</p><p>On a side note, I have to admit I <i>really</i> liked Rio. \u00a0I thought he was a fun character, especially\nwith his strange love for Wookiees. \u00a0It\nwas a bit like Maz from the new trilogy. \nThe moment he first appeared, I instantly decided that I liked him. \u00a0So it really stinks that he was killed off\nafter such a short amount of screentime. \nShame we couldn\u2019t see more of him.</p><p>In the aftermath of the failed heist, Tobias\nrounds on Han, angrily punching him for losing the coaxium. \u00a0Here, it\u2019s revealed that Tobias and his late\nteammates weren\u2019t actually stealing the coaxium for themselves. \u00a0Instead, they had been hired by Drydon Vos,\nthe leader of a criminal syndicate known as the Crimson Dawn. \u00a0Now that the crate of coaxium is lost, Tobias\nis fearful for his life, as Drydon Vos is not known to be very understanding or\nforgiving. \u00a0And he knows that he won\u2019t be\nable to run, as Drydon Vos would undoubtedly succeed in locating him, no matter\nwhere he might try to hide. \u00a0In the hopes\nof convincing Drydon Vos to give him another chance, Tobias ends up going to\nseek an audience with him on the mob boss\u2019 space yacht. \u00a0But before he leaves, Tobias informs Han and\nChewbacca that this will be their last chance to get out of this mess. \u00a0Because Drydon Vos currently has no idea that\neither of them even exist and will never know they were even involved with this\nif they back out now. \u00a0But Han insists on\nseeing this through to the end, as he knows he can\u2019t pass up on this chance to\nget the money for this job. \u00a0Chewbacca\nalso agrees to stick around. \u00a0Maybe\nbecause he feels that this would eventually help him locate the other Wookiees\nthat were abducted and taken away from Kashyyyk.</p><p>When they arrive at Drydon Vos\u2019 space yacht,\nTobias announces their presence to one of Drydon Vos\u2019 goons. \u00a0While waiting around to be summoned, Tobias\nand Chewbacca head off to get some drinks at the bar while Han decides to make\nhis way to the edge of the crowd to simply look out the window. \u00a0But then, someone approaches him and taps his\nshoulder. \u00a0To Han\u2019s shock and amazement,\nhe sees the person who has joined him at the window is none other than Qi\u2019ra,\nhis girlfriend from Corellia! \u00a0Han is\noverjoyed to see her again, and he immediately starts to apologize for not\ncoming back for her, stating that he really had planned on doing so the moment\nhe\u2019d been able to buy his own ship. \u00a0But\nQi\u2019ra waves away his apology, stating that it\u2019s all in the past and she doesn\u2019t\nresent him for not being able to keep his promise to her, also pointing out\nthat he would have been killed if he hadn\u2019t taken advantage of his chance to\nget off Corellia. \u00a0It turns out that,\nafter she and Han were separated three years ago, Qi\u2019ra somehow became\nentangled into the Crimson Dawn and is essentially bound to Drydon Vos now.</p><p>But the two are not given much of a chance to\ncatch up, because that\u2019s when Tobias returns, announcing their meeting with\nDrydon Vos has been approved. \u00a0Needless\nto say, Drydon Vos is not pleased when he finds out Tobias did not bring the\nshipment of coaxium that he\u2019d requested and is all set to kill him for this,\nunless Tobias can tell him exactly how he plans to make it up to him. \u00a0Tobias therefore offers to locate and steal\nsome coaxium from a different source. \u00a0Of\ncourse, this is easier said than done as coaxium is still super-rare, with the\nEmpire holding a cartel on the market. \nBut Han has an idea- they go right to the source and steal unprocessed\ncoaxium from the mines on the planet Kessel. \nOf course, this is an extremely risky plan, as unprocessed coaxium is\nextremely volatile, and if it\u2019s not processed within a certain time frame, then\nit will explode. \u00a0Once again, however,\nHan has an idea. \u00a0There\u2019s apparently a\nprocessing plant that\u2019s not controlled by the Empire, located on the planet\nSavareen. \u00a0Although this plan is still\nextremely risky, as it would require them to make the infamous Kessel Run in\nless than twenty parsecs. \u00a0And yes, I\nknow that a parsec is a unit of distance and not time. \u00a0But maybe the implication is that the average\nKessel Run spans a distance that\u2019s over twenty parsecs, and to make the journey\nin less than twenty parsects is synonymous with finding a way to travel from\nMaine to California (a trip that should span 3,247 miles) in only 1,000\nmiles. \u00a0But then again, this is just me\ntrying to make sense over a line that was probably only meant to give nerds\nsomething to harp on.</p><p>In any event, Drydon Vos ultimately agrees to\nHan\u2019s plan and, in what I\u2019m guessing was an attempt to make sure that Tobias,\nHan and Chewbacca follow through and don\u2019t just try to run, he has Qi\u2019ra\naccompany them. \u00a0But before they can go\noff to steal the coaxium, they have to locate a suitably fast ship that would\nenable them to make the trip. \nFortunately, Qi\u2019ra knows where to find such a ship. \u00a0She leads the group to this place on a snowy\nplanet called Vandor that kinda looks like a crashed luxury starship that has\nbeen converted into a gambling hall. \nThere, they encounter the smooth-talking Lando Calrissian, who boasts\nthat his ship is the fastest one in existence. \nHe\u2019s accompanied by L3-37, a female Piloting Droid that Lando apparently\nhad custom made to be his co-pilot. While I\u2019m sure some people might disagree\nwith me on this, I say L3 was the best character in this movie. \u00a0Her claim to fame was the fact that she\u2019s a\nfierce advocate for Droid rights. \u00a0When\nwe first meet her, she\u2019s angrily protesting a Droid battle ring that\u2019s being\nheld in the gambling hall, trying to reason with one of the Droids being used\nin the fighting and then getting into an argument with the Droid\u2019s owner. \u00a0 To be honest, I totally see her point in\nregards to her crusade. \u00a0Even though\nDroids are clearly manmade, they are still programed with artificial\nintelligence, and they all seem to have their own personalities. \u00a0It does present an interesting debate over\nwhat it means to be considered \u2018alive.\u2019 \nAnd when you think of it, there does seem to be a prevailing\ndiscrimination towards Droids. \u00a0For\ninstance, it seems like a lot of eateries won\u2019t serve Droids. \u00a0And then there\u2019s Obi-Wan\u2019s comment in <i>Attack of the Clones</i>, in which he more\nor less stated that he didn\u2019t thing Droids were capable of independent\nthought. \u00a0So, it could be argued that\nDroids are largely treated as robot slaves in the Star Wars universe, with each\ntype of Droid being automatically assigned a particular task from the moment\nthey\u2019re activated and never given the opportunity to rise above the task they\nwere issued upon their creation. \u00a0For\ninstance, I don\u2019t recall seeing any Droids serving on the Galactic Senate\nduring the prequel trilogy.</p><p>Anyway, Han approaches Lando, with Tobias,\nChewbacca and Qi\u2019ra watching with the rest of the crowd, to ask him about his\nship. \u00a0Lando states he won it in a game\nof Sabacc, which is basically this world\u2019s equivalent to poker. \u00a0Han kinda chuckles at that, vocally wondering\nwhat kind of man bets his ship in a card game. \nEventually, he asks to be dealt into the game of Sabacc that Lando is\ncurrently playing with a handful of Aliens. \nNow, the build up to this moment is rather strange. \u00a0Because before this scene, we had been given\nno sort of context as to what Han\u2019s gambling skill is like. \u00a0Is he actually really good when it comes to\ngambling? \u00a0Has he ever gambled or played\nSabacc before? \u00a0But I guess he\u2019s quite\ngood, because he manages to stay in the game after everyone else has folded. \u00a0So, in the end, it\u2019s just him against\nLando. \u00a0In the final round, Lando ends up\nwagering his ship, which, of course, ends up being the Millennium Falcon. \u00a0To counter this wager, Han also bets his own\nship. \u00a0Which we know doesn\u2019t actually\nexist. \u00a0However, Lando ends up winning\nthe game because he was cheating by hiding a stash of cards up his sleeve. \u00a0After the game, Lando approaches the group to\nask where he can pick up the ship he supposedly won off of Han. \u00a0Only to be told that it wasn\u2019t there. \u00a0 As a consolation prize, they fill him in on\ntheir plan to steal unprocessed coaxium from the mines on Kessel. \u00a0They tell Lando that if he provides his ship\nfor the heist, then they will give him a cut of the money they\u2019ll get for the\ncoaxium. \u00a0Lando doesn\u2019t seem to be\ncompletely thrilled with this arrangement, but he ultimately agrees to it,\nespecially when he sees Tobias is involved. \nApparently, Tobias had previously brought about the death of somebody\nLando owed a lot of money to, so Lando is grateful towards him for indirectly\nfreeing him from his debt.</p><p>And they\u2019re off to Kessel. \u00a0Along the way, we get a few scenes of the\ncharacters just being characters. \u00a0Qi\u2019ra\nis exploring the Falcon, finding that Lando seems to have a thing for\ncapes. \u00a0She also has a moment with Han\nwhich leads to them passionately making out, only for them to be interrupted by\nTobias, who counsels Han that he\u2019d do well to not trust Qi\u2019ra so much, and that\nit\u2019s best to just expect everyone might betray him. \u00a0Tobias and Chewbacca also play around with\nthat holographic chess board thing (with Chewbacca losing, much to his\nfrustration.) \u00a0And we also get a whole\n\u2018girl talk\u2019 moment with Qi\u2019ra and L3, with L3 observing that Han is still in\nlove with Qi\u2019ra. \u00a0It\u2019s at this point that\nwe\u2019re told that Lando and L3\u2019s relationship is a bit more than just one between\npilot and co-pilot, and it\u2019s heavily implied they have a sexual\nrelationship. \u00a0So I guess Lando is\npansexual? \u00a0Okay, that\u2019s pretty\ninteresting. \u00a0I don\u2019t think we see many\npansexual characters featured in the media, do we?</p><p>Eventually, they reach Kessel and, in order to\ninfiltrate the mine, Qi\u2019ra, Tobias and L3 masquerade as human traffickers and\npresent Han and Chewbacca as new workers for the mine. \u00a0And you might notice that Tobias is wearing\nthe same disguise Lando will eventually wear in the first half of <i>Return of the Jedi</i>. \u00a0Speaking of Lando, he\u2019s apparently hanging\nback on the Millennium Falcon to make another entry in his personal \u2018Lando\nChronicles.\u2019 \u00a0I guess we\u2019re supposed to\nconclude that Lando is a bit full of himself.</p><p>Upon being brought into the mines, Han and\nChewbacca both reveal that their restraints were not locked, and they\nimmediately break free and overpower the two guards bringing them down the mine\nelevator \u00a0(with Chewbacca actually\nripping off somebody\u2019s arms.) \u00a0Meanwhile,\nup in the control room, Qi\u2019ra gets to work on upholding her part of the plan,\nwhich involves her and Tobias taking out the mine foreman and guards so L3\ncould take over the control room\u2019s console, in order to gain access to the\nmine\u2019s security footage and use that to direct Han and Chewbacca to the chamber\nthe coaxium is stored in. \u00a0However, in\nthe process, L3 finds she can\u2019t stand to turn a blind eye to the fact that\nDroids are being used to run the mine, especially when she spots a restraining\nbolt affixed to one of the Astromech Droids. \nShe ends up starting a complete riot by getting the Droids to free one\nother, which leads to all the other mine workers rising up and attempting to\nfight their way to freedom. \u00a0Thankfully,\nthis creates a distraction that makes it possible for Han to locate the coaxium\nvault. \u00a0Amidst the resulting turmoil, Han\nstarts to wheel them out to the Millennium Falcon. \u00a0Chewbacca, on the other hand, briefly went\noff on his own when he spots some Wookiees laboring in the mines because he\nrecognized them as some of the Wookiees that were captured alongside him. \u00a0But he ends up rejoining Han just in time to\nhelp him get the coaxium to the Millennium Falcon, with the other Wookiees\nhelping load the canisters onto the ship. \nAnd, when given the choice between staying with his Wookiee brethren or\nsticking with Han and the others, Chewbacca ultimately chooses the latter. \u00a0Most likely because he\u2019s grown to genuinely\nconsider Han as a friend.</p><p>This whole prison break/coaxium heist quickly\nshifts into a huge gun battle as the mine workers try to escape. \u00a0During the fight, L3 gets gunned down and Lando\nis also hit when he runs out to retrieve her. \nSadly, while Lando only ends up with an injured shoulder, L3 is damaged\nbeyond repair and ends up dying in Lando\u2019s arms.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>With Lando out of commission and L3 gone, Han\nand Chewbacca (who admits to have gained some piloting experience during the\n190 years he\u2019s been alive) are the only ones capable of flying the ship away\nfrom Kessel. \u00a0Unfortunately, their path\nback to Savareen is being blocked by an Imperial brigade, led by a Star\nDestroyer that immediately sends a fleet of TIE Fighters at them. \u00a0It\u2019s speculated that the Imperial patrol had\nheard about the uprising on Kessel and had come to put an end to it. \u00a0While they eventually manage to get rid of\nthe TIE Fighters, through a combination of Tobias manning the ship\u2019s gun and a\nrisky move by Han, they realize they lost a considerable amount of time, as the\ncoaxium is already starting to destabilize. \nIn a desperate attempt at making it to Savareen in time, Han suggests\ntaking a short cut through a cloudy \u2018tunnel\u2019 inside the nebula cloud they\u2019re\ntraveling past. \u00a0At first, everyone feels\nthis is crazy, as entering that cloud tunnel would most likely kill them, as it\ncontains a high number of plasma storms. \nBut Han points out that their current position is no better. \u00a0In order to try and increase their chances at\nmaking through alive, it\u2019s decided to install the memory banks/navigational\narchives of L3 into the Millennium Falcon\u2019s motherboard. \u00a0It was established earlier that L3 was\nprogramed with impeccable navigational skills. \nOnce L3\u2019s programing is fully installed within the Millennium Falcon,\nthey are able to navigate their way through the nebula cloud tunnel, despite\nsome trouble with a Space Kraken and a black hole of some kind. \u00a0They evade the Space Kraken by launching off\nthe Millennium Falcon\u2019s escape pod to create a diversion (which explains why\nthe front of the ship wound up with that recognizable shape.) \u00a0And to escape the black hole, they use a single\ndrop of the coaxium to power the ship\u2019s fusion reactor resulting in the\nMillennium Falcon getting a major speed boost that frees it from the pull of\nthe black hole</p><p>Finally, they manage to make it to\nSavareen. \u00a0And thanks to Han\u2019s plan to\ntravel through the nebula cloud and L3\u2019s memory within the Millennium Falcon,\nthey made the Kessel Run in 12 parsects. \nWhile they\u2019re getting the coaxium processed, and for Drydon Vos to\narrive, Han and Qi\u2019ra have another scene together. \u00a0Han tries to convince Qi\u2019ra to come away with\nhim when this is all over, but Qi\u2019ra tells him that\u2019s not possible due to her\ninvolvement with the Crimson Dawn. \u00a0I\nguess the implication is that the Crimson Dawn is like the Mafia- once you\u2019re\nin it, you\u2019re in it for life. \u00a0She tells\nHan that his feelings for her would change if he had any inking of the things\nshe\u2019s done as part of the Crimson Dawn. \nWhich I guess is meant to imply that she was utilized as their hit\nwoman, tasked with brutally murdering anyone they ordered her to. \u00a0If that\u2019s the case, I can see why Qi\u2019ra\nwouldn\u2019t feel as if she\u2019s worthy of Han anymore, as he displays signs\nthroughout the movie that he has a strong moral compass and would never kill\nsomeone senselessly.</p><p>Anyway, their conversation is interrupted when\nthe Cloud Riders once again appear. \nThey\u2019ve been secretly tailing them throughout the movie. \u00a0At first, Han tries to bluff his way out of\nthe situation, telling Enfys Nest that they have an entire armada on board the Millennium\nFalcon, waiting for his signal to attack them, but that bluff is quickly\ndeflated when Lando, who had slunk back to the Millennium Falcon earlier, flies\noff, leaving Han, Tobias, Chewbacca and Qi\u2019ra stranded. \u00a0But this is when the first twist of the movie\ncomes. \u00a0When Han and company state that\nDrydon Vos is on his way to claim the coaxium, Enfys Nest reveals herself as a\nyoung teenage girl. \u00a0It turns out she and\nher band all were survivors of clans that the Crimson Dawn attacked and\nslaughtered. \u00a0And that the reason why\nthey\u2019ve been attacking and tailing the protagonists is because they knew that\nDrydon Vos would only use the coaxium to lay waste to even more villages, and they\u2019d\nwanted to prevent him from doing so. \u00a0In\nother words, the Cloud Riders were the good guys the whole time.</p><p>Han, upon hearing Enfys Nest\u2019s backstory,\nbegins to feel sympathetic to her and her group. \u00a0As a result, he decides to double cross\nDrydon Vos by giving him vials of fake coaxium while giving the real stuff to\nthe Cloud Riders. \u00a0When he reveals this\nplan to Tobias, the older man decides that he\u2019s not going to stick around as\nthe double cross might go wrong. \u00a0Despite\nhis earlier insistence that it\u2019s pointless to run from Drydon Vos, he states\nhe\u2019s going to risk it now. \u00a0However, this\nturns out to be a lie, as it\u2019s later revealed that he was actually going on\nahead to tip Drydon Vos off about the deception. \u00a0So when Han, Chewbacca and Qi\u2019ra bring the\nchest of fake coaxium to the crime boss, he already knows that he\u2019s being\ndeceived, and has even sent his men to ambush the Cloud Riders before they\ncould leave with the coaxium. \u00a0But then,\nHan reveals he\u2019d already anticipated Tobias\u2019 betrayal. \u00a0And as such, when the goons attack the Cloud\nRiders, they only find empty chests. \nBecause the real coaxium is in the chest Han brought to Drydon Vos.</p><p>And this is when the movie gets to be a bit\ndizzying. \u00a0Because once he finds out that\nthe real coaxium is there, Tobias decides to claim it for his own, drawing a\nblaster on everyone. \u00a0He ends up taking\nChewbacca hostage, forcing him to carry the chest of coaxium for him. \u00a0Admittedly, this doesn\u2019t make much\nsense. \u00a0Chewbacca is a Wookiee. \u00a0One we\u2019d previously seen ripping off\nsomeone\u2019s arms. \u00a0You can\u2019t tell me he\ncouldn\u2019t have easily overpowered Tobias here.</p><p>Regardless, Tobias and Chewbacca leave with the\ncoaxium. \u00a0Once they\u2019re gone, a full-on\nfight breaks out between Han and Drydon Vos, with Han using the blaster he\u2019d\ngotten from Tobias earlier in the film and Drydon Vos wielding these molten\nduel knives. \u00a0After this fight sequence\ngoes on for a little bit, Qi\u2019ra enters the fray, seemingly coming to Drydon\nVos\u2019 defense by pointing some kind of split sword at Han. \u00a0But then, she turns on Drydon Vos, stabbing\nhim clean through.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>After Drydon Vos\u2019 death, Qi\u2019ra urges Han to go\nafter Tobias, telling him to get the coaxium to the Cloud Raiders. \u00a0She refrains from going with him, however,\nstating that she\u2019ll catch up to him later. \nHowever, after Han leaves, Qi\u2019ra reveals she has no intention of\nrejoining him, as she takes Drydon\u2019 Vos\u2019 ring, which I suppose was a symbol of\nhis rank in the Crimson Dawn. \u00a0I guess\nthat, now that he\u2019s dead, Qi\u2019ra is taking over his position. \u00a0However, it\u2019s then revealed that Drydon Vos\nwasn\u2019t the highest ranking member of the Crimson Dawn, because Qi\u2019ra uses the\nring to contact the true leader of the criminal syndicate, giving him a cover\nstory that Drydon Vos was killed by Tobias and that she was the only one who\nsurvived the assault. \u00a0At first, the\nidentity of the Crimson Dawn leader is hidden by the hood he was wearing. \u00a0But when the hood is lowered, the mysterious\nfigure is revealed to be Darth Maul.</p><p>Wait, WHAT?! \nBut\u2026<i>how? \u00a0</i>He\u2019s dead! \u00a0We saw him die in <i>Phantom Menace</i>! \u00a0He got\nsliced in two and then fell down a deep pit. \u00a0 \nHow could <i>anyone</i> have survived\nthat?! \u00a0And before anyone can try to\nargue this by saying it could have been a <i>different</i>\nDathomirian? \u00a0No, it\u2019s not. \u00a0It\u2019s Darth Maul. \u00a0I even checked the end credits, and they\nclearly stated that this was indeed Maul. \nHow in Coruscant did this guy survive getting split in half and falling\ndown a bottomless pit? \u00a0Are they going to\ntry and claim Palpatine survived after the events of <i>Return of the Jedi</i>, too?\u00a0 \u00a0Seriously, first it was Red Skull appearing in <i>Infinity War</i>, and now this!\u00a0 I\u2019d like an explanation for this, please!</p><p>Anyway, Darth Maul orders Qi\u2019ra to meet him on\nhis home planet, where he plans to keep a much closer eye on her. \u00a0Whether or not he knows she wasn\u2019t complelty\nhonest with him is anyone\u2019s guess. \nMeanwhile, Han catches up to Tobias and Chewbacca, confronting the\nformer over the matter of the coaxium. \u00a0(Not\nentirely sure how Han managed to get ahead of them as Tobias had a considerable\nhead start, but oh well.) \u00a0In response,\nTobias starts to reach for his blaster, but then makes the mistake of going off\non this whole spiel about how Han needs to learn a lessson. \u00a0Han, however, doesn\u2019t mess around with\nformalities and fatally shoots Tobias. \nWith his final words, Tobias commends Han for not hesitating to do what\nhe had to, also while lamenting that he never got the chance to pursue his\ndream to be a musician.</p><p>In the aftermath of the adventure, Han and\nChewbacca willingly pass the coaxium over to Enfys Nest, who reveals she plans\nto deliver it to the Rebel Alliance. \u00a0She\nsuggests that Han consider joining the resistance himself, but Han declines,\nstating that it\u2019s highly unlikely that he\u2019ll change his mind on the\nmatter. \u00a0Though those who have seen the\noriginal trilogy already know that he\u2019ll eventually change his tune. \u00a0In gratitude for his help, Enfys Nest gifts\nHan and Chewbacca with a small vial of coaxium.</p><p>Later on, Han and Chewbacca manage to locate\nLando again, this time on some kind of lush jungle planet. \u00a0Needless to say, Han is fully ready to give\nLando a piece of his mind about how he\u2019d stranded them all on Savareen. \u00a0But that\u2019s when he catches a brief glimpse of\nthe card dispenser mechanism affixed to Lando\u2019s wrist. \u00a0Right always, he realizes that Lando had\ncheated in their earlier game of Sabacc. \nDeciding to get one up on him, Han challenges Lando to a rematch,\noffering his vial of coaxium as a starting wager. \u00a0Lando readily accepts, not realizing until\nthe final round of their game that Han manages to swipe the cards he was\nconcealing up his sleeve. \u00a0As a result,\nHan is able to win the Millennium Falcon fair and square, a fact that Lando\nbegrudgingly accepts. \u00a0And so, with their\nnewly won ship, Han and Chewbacca set off, deciding to set a course for\nTatooine, as Tobias had mentioned earlier that there was a big shot gangster\nputting together a crew of smugglers on that particular planet. \u00a0While it\u2019s never specifically stated, I\nsuppose we can only conclude they\u2019re referring to Jabba. \u00a0Which explains how Han and Chewbacca got\ninvolved with him in the first place. \nAnd so, the movie ends with the pair flying off, with the Millennium\nFalcon jumping into light speed.</p><p>All in all, I think this was a really good\norigin story for Han Solo. \u00a0And, dare I\nsay it, I actually enjoyed this movie more than <i>The Last Jedi</i>. \u00a0Not that <i>The Last Jedi </i>was an awful movie, of\ncourse. \u00a0But my attitude after seeing\nthat one was more or less \u2018<i>eh, okay, I\nguess I\u2019ll see you guys again in a few years.</i>\u2019 \u00a0With this movie, on the other hand, I really\nwanted to see what happened next. \u00a0What\nhappened to Qi\u2019ra? \u00a0Is she actually a\nSith Lord training under Darth Maul? \u00a0Did\nshe and Han ever see each other again? \u00a0Obviously,\nsomething happens that enables Han to decide to move on from her, considering\nhe eventually pursues a relationship with Leia. \nWhile Han is sometimes seen as a womanizer by some members of the\nfandom, that reputation always seemed rather undeserved, as he appears to be\nmore of a one-woman man. \u00a0So did Qi\u2019ra\nend up dying at some point between now and <i>A\nNew Hope</i>? \u00a0(I suppose it\u2019s possible\nshe ended up horribly betraying him somehow somewhere down the line, but the\nfact that Han obviously held on to the golden pair of dice that they kept\npassing back and forth throughout the movie makes it seem like he still\nregarded her memory with fondness, so I doubt anything went sour between them.\n) Also, is that all there was to the backstory between Han and Lando\u2019s\nfriendship, or did they cross paths a few more times over the years? \u00a0The movie gave us this open ending that left\nyou with a lot of questions, but not to the point where it felt as if the\nplotpoints were left unresolved. \u00a0It\u2019s\nquite rare to find a movie that can achieve that sort of balance. \u00a0Let\u2019s just say that if they turned this movie\ninto a trilogy as well, you certainly wouldn\u2019t hear me complain.</p><p>As for the actor who portrayed the younger\nversion of Han, I think he did a good job. \nObviously, nobody was going to live up to Harrison Ford. \u00a0But there were moments when I looked at Alden\nEhrenreich and I really thought he looked like a younger version of Han. \u00a0And I thought the way they presented this\nyounger version of him to be quite good. \nSure, the Han of the original trilogy made a clear effort at portraying\nhimself as a scoundrel, but at the same time, it was always evident that he was\na good man at his core. \u00a0At the end of the\nday, he was the one who would ultimately do the right thing, because he can\u2019t\ncompletely turn off his moral compass when he sees people in trouble. \u00a0It\u2019s why he came back at the moment of truth\nduring the battle of the first Death Star. \nI also liked how the movie left it rather vague over whether Chewbacca\nwas searching for his family or just his tribe. \nI\u2019m not entirely sure, but I\u2019m pretty sure that bit was made to appeal\nto both the fans who consider the infamous holiday special to be canon and\nthose who refuse to acknowledge its existence. \n(Oh, don\u2019t worry- I\u2019ll post my review to <i>that one</i> on the 22<sup>nd</sup>.)</p><p>Though, I will admit it was a bit off-putting\nthat the two characters I particularly liked- Rio and L3- were both killed\noff. \u00a0Though, at least we have the\nknowledge that L3 will live on in a sense, which does help soften the\nblow. \u00a0She\u2019s now forever a part of the\nMillennium Falcon\u2019s mainframe. \u00a0Though,\neven if she wasn\u2019t, the untimely deaths of my two favorite characters in this\nparticular instalment of the franchise wasn\u2019t enough to taint my enjoyment of\nthe movie. \u00a0After all, character death\nisn\u2019t a foreign concept in these Star Wars anthology movies.</p><p>On that note, <i>Rouge One</i> will be the subject of next week\u2019s review. \u00a0And then, it\u2019s on to the original trilogy. </p><p><a href=\"http://tomeandflickcorner.tumblr.com/post/173577729578/hello-everyone-its-come-to-my-attention-that\">(Click

I figured out the reason\nwhy. \u00a0It was because they were putting\nall their effort into this movie. \u00a0Now,\njust to warn everyone- because this is a review, I WILL be spoiling the plot of\nthis movie. \u00a0So if you plan on reading\nbeyond this point before you actually go see the movie yourself, then that\u2019s on\nyou.</p>[[MORE]]<p>The movie opens on some run-down planet called Corellia,\nwhere this giant sentient millipede-like alien called Lady Proxima essentially\nruns the show. \u00a0Because of the corruption\nthat now runs rampant after the formation of the Galactic Empire, a lot of\ncrime syndicates have been able to take root, and Lady Proxima is no\nexception. \u00a0She runs this thieves guild\non Corellia where she basically abducts children and forces them to steal stuff\nfor her in exchange for food and shelter. \nRight away, we are shown that the teenaged Han is one of the young\nthieves under Lady Proxima\u2019s control. \nUnfortunately, the latest mission he was sent on, which involved\ndelivering a cache of coaxium, a highly valued kind of fuel in exchange for\nmoney, didn\u2019t exactly go well and he was forced to run for his life, leaving\nthe money he was supposed to retrieve behind. \nHowever, he did manage to swipe a small vial of coaxium for himself. \u00a0He shows this to his girlfriend, Qi'ra, who\nalso lives under Lady Proxima\u2019s thumb. \nHan states that he plans to trade the vial of coaxium for passage off\nCorellia for the both of them, so they can live in freedom. \u00a0Han also reveals his aspiration to be a top-notch\npilot with his own ship, a goal he plans to achieve once he and Qi\u2019ra escape\nCorellia and Lady Proxima.</p><p>Before Han could put his plan into action,\nhowever Lady Proxima\u2019s goons appear, apprehending Han. \u00a0He\u2019s forcibly taken before Lady Proxima, who\nis not pleased that Han failed his most recent mission by not bringing her the\nmoney he was supposed to pick up. \u00a0As\npunishment for his transgression, she is all set to have him whipped and beaten\nuntil he learns his lesson and starts being completely obedient to her. \u00a0This prompts Qi\u2019ra to try and come to his\ndefense, but Han comes up with a plan on the spot. \u00a0He threatens to blow everyone up with a\nthermal detonator that he just happened to have on him. \u00a0(Which was an obvious callback to that one\nscene in <i>Return of the Jedi</i>. \u00a0You all know the one I mean.) \u00a0Of course, Lady Proxima isn\u2019t stupid and\nrealizes that Han is just holding a rock. \nBut Han just basically shrugs and hurls the rock up at the roof, which\ncreates a large hole that sunlight pours through. \u00a0Lady Proxima, it turns out, does not like the\nlight, as contact with the sunlight will give her an instant sunburn, and thus\nhas no choice but to retreat into her water-filled chamber.</p><p>Taking advantage of the resulting turmoil, Han\ngrabs hold of Qi\u2019ra and the pair attempt to make their getaway, utilizing a\nland speeder Han had commandeered in the first scene of the movie. \u00a0After a whole car chase scene, Han and Qi\u2019ra\nmanage to make it to Corellia\u2019s spaceport, which is filled with people trying\nto make it off the planet by boarding a transport that\u2019s scheduled to leave\nsoon. \u00a0Right away, it\u2019s established that\nthis is a risky place to be, as a lot of the people there are trying to sneak\noff the planet to freedom, with Imperial Guards and Stormtroopers standing at\nthe ready to apprehend people who don\u2019t have the proper documentation. \u00a0At one point, we even see a group of children\nbeing forcibly separated from their parents. \n(Not sure if this was meant to be taken as social commentary with\npolitical subtext, but it was still unsettling to witness.) \u00a0Trying to act casual, Han and Qi\u2019ra get into\nthe ticket agent line, all too aware of the fact that Lady Proxima\u2019s goons are\nsearching the premises for them. \u00a0When\nit\u2019s their turn to present their travel papers to the Imperial Guard on duty,\nHan admits they don\u2019t have any, but manages to bribe the guard with the vial of\ncoaxium, stating that they\u2019ll hand it over to her if they\u2019re allowed through\nthe gates. \u00a0Unable to resist the bribe,\nthe Imperial Guard opens the gate to allow them through. \u00a0But just as the pair are in the process of\nwalking through the gate, Lady Proxima\u2019s goons appear out of nowhere and\napprehend Qi\u2019ra, just as the gates slam shut. \nAs such, she and Han are forcibly separated, and Han can only watch as\nQi\u2019ra is dragged off. \u00a0As she\u2019s taken\naway, Han calls out to her, vowing that he will come back for her as soon as he\ncan.</p><p>However, before he can uphold his promise, Han\nrealizes that he\u2019s going to need a ship of his own. \u00a0In the hopes of earning enough money to\npurchase a ship, he ends up volunteering to join the Empire by enlisting in\nImperial Navy. \u00a0When he goes to the\nrecruitment office, he confesses to the Imperial Recruitment Officer that he\nhas no surname. \u00a0As such, the Recruitment\nOfficer decides to give him the name Han Solo.</p><p>The action then fast-forwards to three years\nlater. \u00a0Han is now serving as an\ninfantryman and is placed among an Imperial squadron fighting on an extremely\nmuddy planet called Mimban. \u00a0It comes out\nthat he was kicked out of the Imperial Flight Academy due to an inability to\nfollow orders without question. \u00a0Now, it\nmight just have been me, but for some reason, the whole battlefront on Mimban\nmade me think of World War One, and the whole trench warfare they utilized. \u00a0Though I\u2019m not sure if that was intentional.</p><p>While he\u2019s on Mimban, Han spots a small group\namong the infantrymen. \u00a0Right away, he is\nable to surmise that they\u2019re actually impostors who infiltrated the infantry in\norder to steal one of the dropships, particularly when one of them doesn\u2019t seem\nto realize that his uniform indicates he\u2019s the highest ranking soldier among\nthem until it\u2019s directly pointed out to him. \nHan ends up confronting them about this, attempting to blackmail them\ninto letting him join them when they make their way off the planet. \u00a0However, the leader of the group, Tobias\nBeckett, ends up having Han arrested for attempted desertion instead, telling\nthe arresting officers that Han is a liar and that they shouldn\u2019t believe a\nword he says. \u00a0Which pretty much takes\ncare of Han\u2019s threats to expose them as impostors.</p><p>The arresting officers sentence Han to be fed\nto the \u2018beast\u2019 they have been keeping imprisoned. \u00a0When Han is tossed into grate covered pit,\nit\u2019s revealed, to nobody\u2019s shock, that the \u2018beast\u2019 is actually Chewbacca. \u00a0Initially, Chewbacca doesn\u2019t hesitate to\nattack Han, possibly embittered by how long the Imperial Army has kept him\nstarved and chained up. \u00a0But he instantly\nrelents when Han reveals that he can speak Wookiee. \u00a0At least, to an extent. \u00a0Han isn\u2019t exactly fluent in Chewbacca\u2019s\nnative language, but he knows enough to convey his plan of escape to Chewbacca. \u00a0Han\u2019s plan involves them staging a fight for\nthe entertainment of the Imperial Officers that are overseeing the proceedings.\nBut instead of punching Han, Chewbacca will be hitting the support beam that is\nholding up the grate covering the opening of the pit. \u00a0The plan ultimately succeeds, enabling Han\nand Chewbacca to climb out. \u00a0But the pair\nare still chained together, which leads to a brief argument of which direction\nthey\u2019ll head off in. In the end, Han convinces Chewbacca to trust him, stating\nthat he has friends that are in the process of leaving Mimban. \u00a0All they have to do is continue their\nalliance long enough reach their shuttle before they leave. \u00a0After that, they\u2019d be free to go their\nseparate ways at any time. \u00a0Chewbacca\nends up agreeing to that plan, and two hurry off to try and catch up to Tobias\nand his team. \u00a0They arrive at the launch\npad just in time to see Tobias\u2019 ship taking off, but when Tobias and his allies\nsee that Han has managed to get away, and is now accompanied by a Wookiee, it\u2019d\ndecided that they will allow the pair to board the ship. \u00a0More specifically, Tobias and the group\u2019s\nAlien member, Rio, (who apparently has a deep appreciation for Wookiees) decide\nit\u2019s a good idea. \u00a0The female of the\ntrio, Val, isn\u2019t exactly on board with admitting a pair of rookies into their\noperation, but she ultimately goes along with it, realizing that she\u2019s\noutvoted.</p><p>Now that Han and Chewbacca have joined Tobias\u2019\nteam, they are informed of their plan to pull off a train heist in order to make\noff with a shipment of that fuel source, coaxium. \u00a0The night before their heist, the group has\nthis whole campfire bonding moment, with Han stating that his ultimate goal is\nstill the same as it was at the start of the movie. \u00a0He wants to earn enough money to buy a ship,\nso he can return to Corellia and save Qi\u2019ra. \nThis scene also serves to inform the audience that, after the rise of\nthe Galactic Empire, the Imperial Forces managed to overthrow Kashyyyk, and a\ngood number of Wookiees were taken prisoner. \nIt\u2019s stated that Chewbacca\u2019s family, or at least his tribe, were among\nthe captured Wookies, so his ultimate goal is to find them and free them. \u00a0Apart from those character development\nmoments, nothing much else happens during this scene. \u00a0But it is indicated that Tobias and Val are\nromantically involved.</p><p>The following morning, Han, Chewbacca, Tobias,\nVal and Rio proceed with their train heist. \nHowever, the robbery is interrupted by the appearance of a band of space\npirates called the Cloud Riders, who are led by an armored figure known as\nEnfys Nest. \u00a0This leads to a whole action\nsequence, in which both groups try to claim the coaxium. \u00a0Due in part to the interference of the Cloud\nRiders, Val and Rio are both killed. \nAnd, when Han, Tobias and Chewbacca try to make off with the spoils, Han\nends up defying Tobias orders and releases the cargo, resulting in it getting\ndestroyed. \u00a0This was because the Cloud\nRiders also had attached tethers to the crate of coaxium, resulting in them\nhaving a tug-of-war of sorts. \u00a0And Han\nrealized that if he didn\u2019t release their hold on the coaxium, then he wouldn\u2019t\nbe able to maneuver their ship around a mountain in time. \u00a0So it was pretty much a choice between the\ncoaxium and their lives. \u00a0Honestly, I\nthink that decision was very much in character for Han. \u00a0Isn\u2019t that what will one day get him into\ntrouble with Jabba?</p><p>On a side note, I have to admit I <i>really</i> liked Rio. \u00a0I thought he was a fun character, especially\nwith his strange love for Wookiees. \u00a0It\nwas a bit like Maz from the new trilogy. \nThe moment he first appeared, I instantly decided that I liked him. \u00a0So it really stinks that he was killed off\nafter such a short amount of screentime. \nShame we couldn\u2019t see more of him.</p><p>In the aftermath of the failed heist, Tobias\nrounds on Han, angrily punching him for losing the coaxium. \u00a0Here, it\u2019s revealed that Tobias and his late\nteammates weren\u2019t actually stealing the coaxium for themselves. \u00a0Instead, they had been hired by Drydon Vos,\nthe leader of a criminal syndicate known as the Crimson Dawn. \u00a0Now that the crate of coaxium is lost, Tobias\nis fearful for his life, as Drydon Vos is not known to be very understanding or\nforgiving. \u00a0And he knows that he won\u2019t be\nable to run, as Drydon Vos would undoubtedly succeed in locating him, no matter\nwhere he might try to hide. \u00a0In the hopes\nof convincing Drydon Vos to give him another chance, Tobias ends up going to\nseek an audience with him on the mob boss\u2019 space yacht. \u00a0But before he leaves, Tobias informs Han and\nChewbacca that this will be their last chance to get out of this mess. \u00a0Because Drydon Vos currently has no idea that\neither of them even exist and will never know they were even involved with this\nif they back out now. \u00a0But Han insists on\nseeing this through to the end, as he knows he can\u2019t pass up on this chance to\nget the money for this job. \u00a0Chewbacca\nalso agrees to stick around. \u00a0Maybe\nbecause he feels that this would eventually help him locate the other Wookiees\nthat were abducted and taken away from Kashyyyk.</p><p>When they arrive at Drydon Vos\u2019 space yacht,\nTobias announces their presence to one of Drydon Vos\u2019 goons. \u00a0While waiting around to be summoned, Tobias\nand Chewbacca head off to get some drinks at the bar while Han decides to make\nhis way to the edge of the crowd to simply look out the window. \u00a0But then, someone approaches him and taps his\nshoulder. \u00a0To Han\u2019s shock and amazement,\nhe sees the person who has joined him at the window is none other than Qi\u2019ra,\nhis girlfriend from Corellia! \u00a0Han is\noverjoyed to see her again, and he immediately starts to apologize for not\ncoming back for her, stating that he really had planned on doing so the moment\nhe\u2019d been able to buy his own ship. \u00a0But\nQi\u2019ra waves away his apology, stating that it\u2019s all in the past and she doesn\u2019t\nresent him for not being able to keep his promise to her, also pointing out\nthat he would have been killed if he hadn\u2019t taken advantage of his chance to\nget off Corellia. \u00a0It turns out that,\nafter she and Han were separated three years ago, Qi\u2019ra somehow became\nentangled into the Crimson Dawn and is essentially bound to Drydon Vos now.</p><p>But the two are not given much of a chance to\ncatch up, because that\u2019s when Tobias returns, announcing their meeting with\nDrydon Vos has been approved. \u00a0Needless\nto say, Drydon Vos is not pleased when he finds out Tobias did not bring the\nshipment of coaxium that he\u2019d requested and is all set to kill him for this,\nunless Tobias can tell him exactly how he plans to make it up to him. \u00a0Tobias therefore offers to locate and steal\nsome coaxium from a different source. \u00a0Of\ncourse, this is easier said than done as coaxium is still super-rare, with the\nEmpire holding a cartel on the market. \nBut Han has an idea- they go right to the source and steal unprocessed\ncoaxium from the mines on the planet Kessel. \nOf course, this is an extremely risky plan, as unprocessed coaxium is\nextremely volatile, and if it\u2019s not processed within a certain time frame, then\nit will explode. \u00a0Once again, however,\nHan has an idea. \u00a0There\u2019s apparently a\nprocessing plant that\u2019s not controlled by the Empire, located on the planet\nSavareen. \u00a0Although this plan is still\nextremely risky, as it would require them to make the infamous Kessel Run in\nless than twenty parsecs. \u00a0And yes, I\nknow that a parsec is a unit of distance and not time. \u00a0But maybe the implication is that the average\nKessel Run spans a distance that\u2019s over twenty parsecs, and to make the journey\nin less than twenty parsects is synonymous with finding a way to travel from\nMaine to California (a trip that should span 3,247 miles) in only 1,000\nmiles. \u00a0But then again, this is just me\ntrying to make sense over a line that was probably only meant to give nerds\nsomething to harp on.</p><p>In any event, Drydon Vos ultimately agrees to\nHan\u2019s plan and, in what I\u2019m guessing was an attempt to make sure that Tobias,\nHan and Chewbacca follow through and don\u2019t just try to run, he has Qi\u2019ra\naccompany them. \u00a0But before they can go\noff to steal the coaxium, they have to locate a suitably fast ship that would\nenable them to make the trip. \nFortunately, Qi\u2019ra knows where to find such a ship. \u00a0She leads the group to this place on a snowy\nplanet called Vandor that kinda looks like a crashed luxury starship that has\nbeen converted into a gambling hall. \nThere, they encounter the smooth-talking Lando Calrissian, who boasts\nthat his ship is the fastest one in existence. \nHe\u2019s accompanied by L3-37, a female Piloting Droid that Lando apparently\nhad custom made to be his co-pilot. While I\u2019m sure some people might disagree\nwith me on this, I say L3 was the best character in this movie. \u00a0Her claim to fame was the fact that she\u2019s a\nfierce advocate for Droid rights. \u00a0When\nwe first meet her, she\u2019s angrily protesting a Droid battle ring that\u2019s being\nheld in the gambling hall, trying to reason with one of the Droids being used\nin the fighting and then getting into an argument with the Droid\u2019s owner. \u00a0 To be honest, I totally see her point in\nregards to her crusade. \u00a0Even though\nDroids are clearly manmade, they are still programed with artificial\nintelligence, and they all seem to have their own personalities. \u00a0It does present an interesting debate over\nwhat it means to be considered \u2018alive.\u2019 \nAnd when you think of it, there does seem to be a prevailing\ndiscrimination towards Droids. \u00a0For\ninstance, it seems like a lot of eateries won\u2019t serve Droids. \u00a0And then there\u2019s Obi-Wan\u2019s comment in <i>Attack of the Clones</i>, in which he more\nor less stated that he didn\u2019t thing Droids were capable of independent\nthought. \u00a0So, it could be argued that\nDroids are largely treated as robot slaves in the Star Wars universe, with each\ntype of Droid being automatically assigned a particular task from the moment\nthey\u2019re activated and never given the opportunity to rise above the task they\nwere issued upon their creation. \u00a0For\ninstance, I don\u2019t recall seeing any Droids serving on the Galactic Senate\nduring the prequel trilogy.</p><p>Anyway, Han approaches Lando, with Tobias,\nChewbacca and Qi\u2019ra watching with the rest of the crowd, to ask him about his\nship. \u00a0Lando states he won it in a game\nof Sabacc, which is basically this world\u2019s equivalent to poker. \u00a0Han kinda chuckles at that, vocally wondering\nwhat kind of man bets his ship in a card game. \nEventually, he asks to be dealt into the game of Sabacc that Lando is\ncurrently playing with a handful of Aliens. \nNow, the build up to this moment is rather strange. \u00a0Because before this scene, we had been given\nno sort of context as to what Han\u2019s gambling skill is like. \u00a0Is he actually really good when it comes to\ngambling? \u00a0Has he ever gambled or played\nSabacc before? \u00a0But I guess he\u2019s quite\ngood, because he manages to stay in the game after everyone else has folded. \u00a0So, in the end, it\u2019s just him against\nLando. \u00a0In the final round, Lando ends up\nwagering his ship, which, of course, ends up being the Millennium Falcon. \u00a0To counter this wager, Han also bets his own\nship. \u00a0Which we know doesn\u2019t actually\nexist. \u00a0However, Lando ends up winning\nthe game because he was cheating by hiding a stash of cards up his sleeve. \u00a0After the game, Lando approaches the group to\nask where he can pick up the ship he supposedly won off of Han. \u00a0Only to be told that it wasn\u2019t there. \u00a0 As a consolation prize, they fill him in on\ntheir plan to steal unprocessed coaxium from the mines on Kessel. \u00a0They tell Lando that if he provides his ship\nfor the heist, then they will give him a cut of the money they\u2019ll get for the\ncoaxium. \u00a0Lando doesn\u2019t seem to be\ncompletely thrilled with this arrangement, but he ultimately agrees to it,\nespecially when he sees Tobias is involved. \nApparently, Tobias had previously brought about the death of somebody\nLando owed a lot of money to, so Lando is grateful towards him for indirectly\nfreeing him from his debt.</p><p>And they\u2019re off to Kessel. \u00a0Along the way, we get a few scenes of the\ncharacters just being characters. \u00a0Qi\u2019ra\nis exploring the Falcon, finding that Lando seems to have a thing for\ncapes. \u00a0She also has a moment with Han\nwhich leads to them passionately making out, only for them to be interrupted by\nTobias, who counsels Han that he\u2019d do well to not trust Qi\u2019ra so much, and that\nit\u2019s best to just expect everyone might betray him. \u00a0Tobias and Chewbacca also play around with\nthat holographic chess board thing (with Chewbacca losing, much to his\nfrustration.) \u00a0And we also get a whole\n\u2018girl talk\u2019 moment with Qi\u2019ra and L3, with L3 observing that Han is still in\nlove with Qi\u2019ra. \u00a0It\u2019s at this point that\nwe\u2019re told that Lando and L3\u2019s relationship is a bit more than just one between\npilot and co-pilot, and it\u2019s heavily implied they have a sexual\nrelationship. \u00a0So I guess Lando is\npansexual? \u00a0Okay, that\u2019s pretty\ninteresting. \u00a0I don\u2019t think we see many\npansexual characters featured in the media, do we?</p><p>Eventually, they reach Kessel and, in order to\ninfiltrate the mine, Qi\u2019ra, Tobias and L3 masquerade as human traffickers and\npresent Han and Chewbacca as new workers for the mine. \u00a0And you might notice that Tobias is wearing\nthe same disguise Lando will eventually wear in the first half of <i>Return of the Jedi</i>. \u00a0Speaking of Lando, he\u2019s apparently hanging\nback on the Millennium Falcon to make another entry in his personal \u2018Lando\nChronicles.\u2019 \u00a0I guess we\u2019re supposed to\nconclude that Lando is a bit full of himself.</p><p>Upon being brought into the mines, Han and\nChewbacca both reveal that their restraints were not locked, and they\nimmediately break free and overpower the two guards bringing them down the mine\nelevator \u00a0(with Chewbacca actually\nripping off somebody\u2019s arms.) \u00a0Meanwhile,\nup in the control room, Qi\u2019ra gets to work on upholding her part of the plan,\nwhich involves her and Tobias taking out the mine foreman and guards so L3\ncould take over the control room\u2019s console, in order to gain access to the\nmine\u2019s security footage and use that to direct Han and Chewbacca to the chamber\nthe coaxium is stored in. \u00a0However, in\nthe process, L3 finds she can\u2019t stand to turn a blind eye to the fact that\nDroids are being used to run the mine, especially when she spots a restraining\nbolt affixed to one of the Astromech Droids. \nShe ends up starting a complete riot by getting the Droids to free one\nother, which leads to all the other mine workers rising up and attempting to\nfight their way to freedom. \u00a0Thankfully,\nthis creates a distraction that makes it possible for Han to locate the coaxium\nvault. \u00a0Amidst the resulting turmoil, Han\nstarts to wheel them out to the Millennium Falcon. \u00a0Chewbacca, on the other hand, briefly went\noff on his own when he spots some Wookiees laboring in the mines because he\nrecognized them as some of the Wookiees that were captured alongside him. \u00a0But he ends up rejoining Han just in time to\nhelp him get the coaxium to the Millennium Falcon, with the other Wookiees\nhelping load the canisters onto the ship. \nAnd, when given the choice between staying with his Wookiee brethren or\nsticking with Han and the others, Chewbacca ultimately chooses the latter. \u00a0Most likely because he\u2019s grown to genuinely\nconsider Han as a friend.</p><p>This whole prison break/coaxium heist quickly\nshifts into a huge gun battle as the mine workers try to escape. \u00a0During the fight, L3 gets gunned down and Lando\nis also hit when he runs out to retrieve her. \nSadly, while Lando only ends up with an injured shoulder, L3 is damaged\nbeyond repair and ends up dying in Lando\u2019s arms.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>With Lando out of commission and L3 gone, Han\nand Chewbacca (who admits to have gained some piloting experience during the\n190 years he\u2019s been alive) are the only ones capable of flying the ship away\nfrom Kessel. \u00a0Unfortunately, their path\nback to Savareen is being blocked by an Imperial brigade, led by a Star\nDestroyer that immediately sends a fleet of TIE Fighters at them. \u00a0It\u2019s speculated that the Imperial patrol had\nheard about the uprising on Kessel and had come to put an end to it. \u00a0While they eventually manage to get rid of\nthe TIE Fighters, through a combination of Tobias manning the ship\u2019s gun and a\nrisky move by Han, they realize they lost a considerable amount of time, as the\ncoaxium is already starting to destabilize. \nIn a desperate attempt at making it to Savareen in time, Han suggests\ntaking a short cut through a cloudy \u2018tunnel\u2019 inside the nebula cloud they\u2019re\ntraveling past. \u00a0At first, everyone feels\nthis is crazy, as entering that cloud tunnel would most likely kill them, as it\ncontains a high number of plasma storms. \nBut Han points out that their current position is no better. \u00a0In order to try and increase their chances at\nmaking through alive, it\u2019s decided to install the memory banks/navigational\narchives of L3 into the Millennium Falcon\u2019s motherboard. \u00a0It was established earlier that L3 was\nprogramed with impeccable navigational skills. \nOnce L3\u2019s programing is fully installed within the Millennium Falcon,\nthey are able to navigate their way through the nebula cloud tunnel, despite\nsome trouble with a Space Kraken and a black hole of some kind. \u00a0They evade the Space Kraken by launching off\nthe Millennium Falcon\u2019s escape pod to create a diversion (which explains why\nthe front of the ship wound up with that recognizable shape.) \u00a0And to escape the black hole, they use a single\ndrop of the coaxium to power the ship\u2019s fusion reactor resulting in the\nMillennium Falcon getting a major speed boost that frees it from the pull of\nthe black hole</p><p>Finally, they manage to make it to\nSavareen. \u00a0And thanks to Han\u2019s plan to\ntravel through the nebula cloud and L3\u2019s memory within the Millennium Falcon,\nthey made the Kessel Run in 12 parsects. \nWhile they\u2019re getting the coaxium processed, and for Drydon Vos to\narrive, Han and Qi\u2019ra have another scene together. \u00a0Han tries to convince Qi\u2019ra to come away with\nhim when this is all over, but Qi\u2019ra tells him that\u2019s not possible due to her\ninvolvement with the Crimson Dawn. \u00a0I\nguess the implication is that the Crimson Dawn is like the Mafia- once you\u2019re\nin it, you\u2019re in it for life. \u00a0She tells\nHan that his feelings for her would change if he had any inking of the things\nshe\u2019s done as part of the Crimson Dawn. \nWhich I guess is meant to imply that she was utilized as their hit\nwoman, tasked with brutally murdering anyone they ordered her to. \u00a0If that\u2019s the case, I can see why Qi\u2019ra\nwouldn\u2019t feel as if she\u2019s worthy of Han anymore, as he displays signs\nthroughout the movie that he has a strong moral compass and would never kill\nsomeone senselessly.</p><p>Anyway, their conversation is interrupted when\nthe Cloud Riders once again appear. \nThey\u2019ve been secretly tailing them throughout the movie. \u00a0At first, Han tries to bluff his way out of\nthe situation, telling Enfys Nest that they have an entire armada on board the Millennium\nFalcon, waiting for his signal to attack them, but that bluff is quickly\ndeflated when Lando, who had slunk back to the Millennium Falcon earlier, flies\noff, leaving Han, Tobias, Chewbacca and Qi\u2019ra stranded. \u00a0But this is when the first twist of the movie\ncomes. \u00a0When Han and company state that\nDrydon Vos is on his way to claim the coaxium, Enfys Nest reveals herself as a\nyoung teenage girl. \u00a0It turns out she and\nher band all were survivors of clans that the Crimson Dawn attacked and\nslaughtered. \u00a0And that the reason why\nthey\u2019ve been attacking and tailing the protagonists is because they knew that\nDrydon Vos would only use the coaxium to lay waste to even more villages, and they\u2019d\nwanted to prevent him from doing so. \u00a0In\nother words, the Cloud Riders were the good guys the whole time.</p><p>Han, upon hearing Enfys Nest\u2019s backstory,\nbegins to feel sympathetic to her and her group. \u00a0As a result, he decides to double cross\nDrydon Vos by giving him vials of fake coaxium while giving the real stuff to\nthe Cloud Riders. \u00a0When he reveals this\nplan to Tobias, the older man decides that he\u2019s not going to stick around as\nthe double cross might go wrong. \u00a0Despite\nhis earlier insistence that it\u2019s pointless to run from Drydon Vos, he states\nhe\u2019s going to risk it now. \u00a0However, this\nturns out to be a lie, as it\u2019s later revealed that he was actually going on\nahead to tip Drydon Vos off about the deception. \u00a0So when Han, Chewbacca and Qi\u2019ra bring the\nchest of fake coaxium to the crime boss, he already knows that he\u2019s being\ndeceived, and has even sent his men to ambush the Cloud Riders before they\ncould leave with the coaxium. \u00a0But then,\nHan reveals he\u2019d already anticipated Tobias\u2019 betrayal. \u00a0And as such, when the goons attack the Cloud\nRiders, they only find empty chests. \nBecause the real coaxium is in the chest Han brought to Drydon Vos.</p><p>And this is when the movie gets to be a bit\ndizzying. \u00a0Because once he finds out that\nthe real coaxium is there, Tobias decides to claim it for his own, drawing a\nblaster on everyone. \u00a0He ends up taking\nChewbacca hostage, forcing him to carry the chest of coaxium for him. \u00a0Admittedly, this doesn\u2019t make much\nsense. \u00a0Chewbacca is a Wookiee. \u00a0One we\u2019d previously seen ripping off\nsomeone\u2019s arms. \u00a0You can\u2019t tell me he\ncouldn\u2019t have easily overpowered Tobias here.</p><p>Regardless, Tobias and Chewbacca leave with the\ncoaxium. \u00a0Once they\u2019re gone, a full-on\nfight breaks out between Han and Drydon Vos, with Han using the blaster he\u2019d\ngotten from Tobias earlier in the film and Drydon Vos wielding these molten\nduel knives. \u00a0After this fight sequence\ngoes on for a little bit, Qi\u2019ra enters the fray, seemingly coming to Drydon\nVos\u2019 defense by pointing some kind of split sword at Han. \u00a0But then, she turns on Drydon Vos, stabbing\nhim clean through.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>After Drydon Vos\u2019 death, Qi\u2019ra urges Han to go\nafter Tobias, telling him to get the coaxium to the Cloud Raiders. \u00a0She refrains from going with him, however,\nstating that she\u2019ll catch up to him later. \nHowever, after Han leaves, Qi\u2019ra reveals she has no intention of\nrejoining him, as she takes Drydon\u2019 Vos\u2019 ring, which I suppose was a symbol of\nhis rank in the Crimson Dawn. \u00a0I guess\nthat, now that he\u2019s dead, Qi\u2019ra is taking over his position. \u00a0However, it\u2019s then revealed that Drydon Vos\nwasn\u2019t the highest ranking member of the Crimson Dawn, because Qi\u2019ra uses the\nring to contact the true leader of the criminal syndicate, giving him a cover\nstory that Drydon Vos was killed by Tobias and that she was the only one who\nsurvived the assault. \u00a0At first, the\nidentity of the Crimson Dawn leader is hidden by the hood he was wearing. \u00a0But when the hood is lowered, the mysterious\nfigure is revealed to be Darth Maul.</p><p>Wait, WHAT?! \nBut\u2026<i>how? \u00a0</i>He\u2019s dead! \u00a0We saw him die in <i>Phantom Menace</i>! \u00a0He got\nsliced in two and then fell down a deep pit. \u00a0 \nHow could <i>anyone</i> have survived\nthat?! \u00a0And before anyone can try to\nargue this by saying it could have been a <i>different</i>\nDathomirian? \u00a0No, it\u2019s not. \u00a0It\u2019s Darth Maul. \u00a0I even checked the end credits, and they\nclearly stated that this was indeed Maul. \nHow in Coruscant did this guy survive getting split in half and falling\ndown a bottomless pit? \u00a0Are they going to\ntry and claim Palpatine survived after the events of <i>Return of the Jedi</i>, too?\u00a0 \u00a0Seriously, first it was Red Skull appearing in <i>Infinity War</i>, and now this!\u00a0 I\u2019d like an explanation for this, please!</p><p>Anyway, Darth Maul orders Qi\u2019ra to meet him on\nhis home planet, where he plans to keep a much closer eye on her. \u00a0Whether or not he knows she wasn\u2019t complelty\nhonest with him is anyone\u2019s guess. \nMeanwhile, Han catches up to Tobias and Chewbacca, confronting the\nformer over the matter of the coaxium. \u00a0(Not\nentirely sure how Han managed to get ahead of them as Tobias had a considerable\nhead start, but oh well.) \u00a0In response,\nTobias starts to reach for his blaster, but then makes the mistake of going off\non this whole spiel about how Han needs to learn a lessson. \u00a0Han, however, doesn\u2019t mess around with\nformalities and fatally shoots Tobias. \nWith his final words, Tobias commends Han for not hesitating to do what\nhe had to, also while lamenting that he never got the chance to pursue his\ndream to be a musician.</p><p>In the aftermath of the adventure, Han and\nChewbacca willingly pass the coaxium over to Enfys Nest, who reveals she plans\nto deliver it to the Rebel Alliance. \u00a0She\nsuggests that Han consider joining the resistance himself, but Han declines,\nstating that it\u2019s highly unlikely that he\u2019ll change his mind on the\nmatter. \u00a0Though those who have seen the\noriginal trilogy already know that he\u2019ll eventually change his tune. \u00a0In gratitude for his help, Enfys Nest gifts\nHan and Chewbacca with a small vial of coaxium.</p><p>Later on, Han and Chewbacca manage to locate\nLando again, this time on some kind of lush jungle planet. \u00a0Needless to say, Han is fully ready to give\nLando a piece of his mind about how he\u2019d stranded them all on Savareen. \u00a0But that\u2019s when he catches a brief glimpse of\nthe card dispenser mechanism affixed to Lando\u2019s wrist. \u00a0Right always, he realizes that Lando had\ncheated in their earlier game of Sabacc. \nDeciding to get one up on him, Han challenges Lando to a rematch,\noffering his vial of coaxium as a starting wager. \u00a0Lando readily accepts, not realizing until\nthe final round of their game that Han manages to swipe the cards he was\nconcealing up his sleeve. \u00a0As a result,\nHan is able to win the Millennium Falcon fair and square, a fact that Lando\nbegrudgingly accepts. \u00a0And so, with their\nnewly won ship, Han and Chewbacca set off, deciding to set a course for\nTatooine, as Tobias had mentioned earlier that there was a big shot gangster\nputting together a crew of smugglers on that particular planet. \u00a0While it\u2019s never specifically stated, I\nsuppose we can only conclude they\u2019re referring to Jabba. \u00a0Which explains how Han and Chewbacca got\ninvolved with him in the first place. \nAnd so, the movie ends with the pair flying off, with the Millennium\nFalcon jumping into light speed.</p><p>All in all, I think this was a really good\norigin story for Han Solo. \u00a0And, dare I\nsay it, I actually enjoyed this movie more than <i>The Last Jedi</i>. \u00a0Not that <i>The Last Jedi </i>was an awful movie, of\ncourse. \u00a0But my attitude after seeing\nthat one was more or less \u2018<i>eh, okay, I\nguess I\u2019ll see you guys again in a few years.</i>\u2019 \u00a0With this movie, on the other hand, I really\nwanted to see what happened next. \u00a0What\nhappened to Qi\u2019ra? \u00a0Is she actually a\nSith Lord training under Darth Maul? \u00a0Did\nshe and Han ever see each other again? \u00a0Obviously,\nsomething happens that enables Han to decide to move on from her, considering\nhe eventually pursues a relationship with Leia. \nWhile Han is sometimes seen as a womanizer by some members of the\nfandom, that reputation always seemed rather undeserved, as he appears to be\nmore of a one-woman man. \u00a0So did Qi\u2019ra\nend up dying at some point between now and <i>A\nNew Hope</i>? \u00a0(I suppose it\u2019s possible\nshe ended up horribly betraying him somehow somewhere down the line, but the\nfact that Han obviously held on to the golden pair of dice that they kept\npassing back and forth throughout the movie makes it seem like he still\nregarded her memory with fondness, so I doubt anything went sour between them.\n) Also, is that all there was to the backstory between Han and Lando\u2019s\nfriendship, or did they cross paths a few more times over the years? \u00a0The movie gave us this open ending that left\nyou with a lot of questions, but not to the point where it felt as if the\nplotpoints were left unresolved. \u00a0It\u2019s\nquite rare to find a movie that can achieve that sort of balance. \u00a0Let\u2019s just say that if they turned this movie\ninto a trilogy as well, you certainly wouldn\u2019t hear me complain.</p><p>As for the actor who portrayed the younger\nversion of Han, I think he did a good job. \nObviously, nobody was going to live up to Harrison Ford. \u00a0But there were moments when I looked at Alden\nEhrenreich and I really thought he looked like a younger version of Han. \u00a0And I thought the way they presented this\nyounger version of him to be quite good. \nSure, the Han of the original trilogy made a clear effort at portraying\nhimself as a scoundrel, but at the same time, it was always evident that he was\na good man at his core. \u00a0At the end of the\nday, he was the one who would ultimately do the right thing, because he can\u2019t\ncompletely turn off his moral compass when he sees people in trouble. \u00a0It\u2019s why he came back at the moment of truth\nduring the battle of the first Death Star. \nI also liked how the movie left it rather vague over whether Chewbacca\nwas searching for his family or just his tribe. \nI\u2019m not entirely sure, but I\u2019m pretty sure that bit was made to appeal\nto both the fans who consider the infamous holiday special to be canon and\nthose who refuse to acknowledge its existence. \n(Oh, don\u2019t worry- I\u2019ll post my review to <i>that one</i> on the 22<sup>nd</sup>.)</p><p>Though, I will admit it was a bit off-putting\nthat the two characters I particularly liked- Rio and L3- were both killed\noff. \u00a0Though, at least we have the\nknowledge that L3 will live on in a sense, which does help soften the\nblow. \u00a0She\u2019s now forever a part of the\nMillennium Falcon\u2019s mainframe. \u00a0Though,\neven if she wasn\u2019t, the untimely deaths of my two favorite characters in this\nparticular instalment of the franchise wasn\u2019t enough to taint my enjoyment of\nthe movie. \u00a0After all, character death\nisn\u2019t a foreign concept in these Star Wars anthology movies.</p><p>On that note, <i>Rouge One</i> will be the subject of next week\u2019s review. \u00a0And then, it\u2019s on to the original trilogy. </p><p><a href=\"http://tomeandflickcorner.tumblr.com/post/173577729578/hello-everyone-its-come-to-my-attention-that\">(Click

                "content": "<p>Okay, wow! \nThis movie was unbelievable! \nRemember how we can all pretty much agree that <i>The Last Jedi</i> had moments that kinda fell flat? &nbsp;Well, I think I figured out the reason\nwhy. &nbsp;It was because they were putting\nall their effort into this movie. &nbsp;Now,\njust to warn everyone- because this is a review, I WILL be spoiling the plot of\nthis movie. &nbsp;So if you plan on reading\nbeyond this point before you actually go see the movie yourself, then that&rsquo;s on\nyou.</p><p>The movie opens on some run-down planet called Corellia,\nwhere this giant sentient millipede-like alien called Lady Proxima essentially\nruns the show. &nbsp;Because of the corruption\nthat now runs rampant after the formation of the Galactic Empire, a lot of\ncrime syndicates have been able to take root, and Lady Proxima is no\nexception. &nbsp;She runs this thieves guild\non Corellia where she basically abducts children and forces them to steal stuff\nfor her in exchange for food and shelter. \nRight away, we are shown that the teenaged Han is one of the young\nthieves under Lady Proxima&rsquo;s control. \nUnfortunately, the latest mission he was sent on, which involved\ndelivering a cache of coaxium, a highly valued kind of fuel in exchange for\nmoney, didn&rsquo;t exactly go well and he was forced to run for his life, leaving\nthe money he was supposed to retrieve behind. \nHowever, he did manage to swipe a small vial of coaxium for himself. &nbsp;He shows this to his girlfriend, Qi'ra, who\nalso lives under Lady Proxima&rsquo;s thumb. \nHan states that he plans to trade the vial of coaxium for passage off\nCorellia for the both of them, so they can live in freedom. &nbsp;Han also reveals his aspiration to be a top-notch\npilot with his own ship, a goal he plans to achieve once he and Qi&rsquo;ra escape\nCorellia and Lady Proxima.</p><p>Before Han could put his plan into action,\nhowever Lady Proxima&rsquo;s goons appear, apprehending Han. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s forcibly taken before Lady Proxima, who\nis not pleased that Han failed his most recent mission by not bringing her the\nmoney he was supposed to pick up. &nbsp;As\npunishment for his transgression, she is all set to have him whipped and beaten\nuntil he learns his lesson and starts being completely obedient to her. &nbsp;This prompts Qi&rsquo;ra to try and come to his\ndefense, but Han comes up with a plan on the spot. &nbsp;He threatens to blow everyone up with a\nthermal detonator that he just happened to have on him. &nbsp;(Which was an obvious callback to that one\nscene in <i>Return of the Jedi</i>. &nbsp;You all know the one I mean.) &nbsp;Of course, Lady Proxima isn&rsquo;t stupid and\nrealizes that Han is just holding a rock. \nBut Han just basically shrugs and hurls the rock up at the roof, which\ncreates a large hole that sunlight pours through. &nbsp;Lady Proxima, it turns out, does not like the\nlight, as contact with the sunlight will give her an instant sunburn, and thus\nhas no choice but to retreat into her water-filled chamber.</p><p>Taking advantage of the resulting turmoil, Han\ngrabs hold of Qi&rsquo;ra and the pair attempt to make their getaway, utilizing a\nland speeder Han had commandeered in the first scene of the movie. &nbsp;After a whole car chase scene, Han and Qi&rsquo;ra\nmanage to make it to Corellia&rsquo;s spaceport, which is filled with people trying\nto make it off the planet by boarding a transport that&rsquo;s scheduled to leave\nsoon. &nbsp;Right away, it&rsquo;s established that\nthis is a risky place to be, as a lot of the people there are trying to sneak\noff the planet to freedom, with Imperial Guards and Stormtroopers standing at\nthe ready to apprehend people who don&rsquo;t have the proper documentation. &nbsp;At one point, we even see a group of children\nbeing forcibly separated from their parents. \n(Not sure if this was meant to be taken as social commentary with\npolitical subtext, but it was still unsettling to witness.) &nbsp;Trying to act casual, Han and Qi&rsquo;ra get into\nthe ticket agent line, all too aware of the fact that Lady Proxima&rsquo;s goons are\nsearching the premises for them. &nbsp;When\nit&rsquo;s their turn to present their travel papers to the Imperial Guard on duty,\nHan admits they don&rsquo;t have any, but manages to bribe the guard with the vial of\ncoaxium, stating that they&rsquo;ll hand it over to her if they&rsquo;re allowed through\nthe gates. &nbsp;Unable to resist the bribe,\nthe Imperial Guard opens the gate to allow them through. &nbsp;But just as the pair are in the process of\nwalking through the gate, Lady Proxima&rsquo;s goons appear out of nowhere and\napprehend Qi&rsquo;ra, just as the gates slam shut. \nAs such, she and Han are forcibly separated, and Han can only watch as\nQi&rsquo;ra is dragged off. &nbsp;As she&rsquo;s taken\naway, Han calls out to her, vowing that he will come back for her as soon as he\ncan.</p><p>However, before he can uphold his promise, Han\nrealizes that he&rsquo;s going to need a ship of his own. &nbsp;In the hopes of earning enough money to\npurchase a ship, he ends up volunteering to join the Empire by enlisting in\nImperial Navy. &nbsp;When he goes to the\nrecruitment office, he confesses to the Imperial Recruitment Officer that he\nhas no surname. &nbsp;As such, the Recruitment\nOfficer decides to give him the name Han Solo.</p><p>The action then fast-forwards to three years\nlater. &nbsp;Han is now serving as an\ninfantryman and is placed among an Imperial squadron fighting on an extremely\nmuddy planet called Mimban. &nbsp;It comes out\nthat he was kicked out of the Imperial Flight Academy due to an inability to\nfollow orders without question. &nbsp;Now, it\nmight just have been me, but for some reason, the whole battlefront on Mimban\nmade me think of World War One, and the whole trench warfare they utilized. &nbsp;Though I&rsquo;m not sure if that was intentional.</p><p>While he&rsquo;s on Mimban, Han spots a small group\namong the infantrymen. &nbsp;Right away, he is\nable to surmise that they&rsquo;re actually impostors who infiltrated the infantry in\norder to steal one of the dropships, particularly when one of them doesn&rsquo;t seem\nto realize that his uniform indicates he&rsquo;s the highest ranking soldier among\nthem until it&rsquo;s directly pointed out to him. \nHan ends up confronting them about this, attempting to blackmail them\ninto letting him join them when they make their way off the planet. &nbsp;However, the leader of the group, Tobias\nBeckett, ends up having Han arrested for attempted desertion instead, telling\nthe arresting officers that Han is a liar and that they shouldn&rsquo;t believe a\nword he says. &nbsp;Which pretty much takes\ncare of Han&rsquo;s threats to expose them as impostors.</p><p>The arresting officers sentence Han to be fed\nto the &lsquo;beast&rsquo; they have been keeping imprisoned. &nbsp;When Han is tossed into grate covered pit,\nit&rsquo;s revealed, to nobody&rsquo;s shock, that the &lsquo;beast&rsquo; is actually Chewbacca. &nbsp;Initially, Chewbacca doesn&rsquo;t hesitate to\nattack Han, possibly embittered by how long the Imperial Army has kept him\nstarved and chained up. &nbsp;But he instantly\nrelents when Han reveals that he can speak Wookiee. &nbsp;At least, to an extent. &nbsp;Han isn&rsquo;t exactly fluent in Chewbacca&rsquo;s\nnative language, but he knows enough to convey his plan of escape to Chewbacca. &nbsp;Han&rsquo;s plan involves them staging a fight for\nthe entertainment of the Imperial Officers that are overseeing the proceedings.\nBut instead of punching Han, Chewbacca will be hitting the support beam that is\nholding up the grate covering the opening of the pit. &nbsp;The plan ultimately succeeds, enabling Han\nand Chewbacca to climb out. &nbsp;But the pair\nare still chained together, which leads to a brief argument of which direction\nthey&rsquo;ll head off in. In the end, Han convinces Chewbacca to trust him, stating\nthat he has friends that are in the process of leaving Mimban. &nbsp;All they have to do is continue their\nalliance long enough reach their shuttle before they leave. &nbsp;After that, they&rsquo;d be free to go their\nseparate ways at any time. &nbsp;Chewbacca\nends up agreeing to that plan, and two hurry off to try and catch up to Tobias\nand his team. &nbsp;They arrive at the launch\npad just in time to see Tobias&rsquo; ship taking off, but when Tobias and his allies\nsee that Han has managed to get away, and is now accompanied by a Wookiee, it&rsquo;d\ndecided that they will allow the pair to board the ship. &nbsp;More specifically, Tobias and the group&rsquo;s\nAlien member, Rio, (who apparently has a deep appreciation for Wookiees) decide\nit&rsquo;s a good idea. &nbsp;The female of the\ntrio, Val, isn&rsquo;t exactly on board with admitting a pair of rookies into their\noperation, but she ultimately goes along with it, realizing that she&rsquo;s\noutvoted.</p><p>Now that Han and Chewbacca have joined Tobias&rsquo;\nteam, they are informed of their plan to pull off a train heist in order to make\noff with a shipment of that fuel source, coaxium. &nbsp;The night before their heist, the group has\nthis whole campfire bonding moment, with Han stating that his ultimate goal is\nstill the same as it was at the start of the movie. &nbsp;He wants to earn enough money to buy a ship,\nso he can return to Corellia and save Qi&rsquo;ra. \nThis scene also serves to inform the audience that, after the rise of\nthe Galactic Empire, the Imperial Forces managed to overthrow Kashyyyk, and a\ngood number of Wookiees were taken prisoner. \nIt&rsquo;s stated that Chewbacca&rsquo;s family, or at least his tribe, were among\nthe captured Wookies, so his ultimate goal is to find them and free them. &nbsp;Apart from those character development\nmoments, nothing much else happens during this scene. &nbsp;But it is indicated that Tobias and Val are\nromantically involved.</p><p>The following morning, Han, Chewbacca, Tobias,\nVal and Rio proceed with their train heist. \nHowever, the robbery is interrupted by the appearance of a band of space\npirates called the Cloud Riders, who are led by an armored figure known as\nEnfys Nest. &nbsp;This leads to a whole action\nsequence, in which both groups try to claim the coaxium. &nbsp;Due in part to the interference of the Cloud\nRiders, Val and Rio are both killed. \nAnd, when Han, Tobias and Chewbacca try to make off with the spoils, Han\nends up defying Tobias orders and releases the cargo, resulting in it getting\ndestroyed. &nbsp;This was because the Cloud\nRiders also had attached tethers to the crate of coaxium, resulting in them\nhaving a tug-of-war of sorts. &nbsp;And Han\nrealized that if he didn&rsquo;t release their hold on the coaxium, then he wouldn&rsquo;t\nbe able to maneuver their ship around a mountain in time. &nbsp;So it was pretty much a choice between the\ncoaxium and their lives. &nbsp;Honestly, I\nthink that decision was very much in character for Han. &nbsp;Isn&rsquo;t that what will one day get him into\ntrouble with Jabba?</p><p>On a side note, I have to admit I <i>really</i> liked Rio. &nbsp;I thought he was a fun character, especially\nwith his strange love for Wookiees. &nbsp;It\nwas a bit like Maz from the new trilogy. \nThe moment he first appeared, I instantly decided that I liked him. &nbsp;So it really stinks that he was killed off\nafter such a short amount of screentime. \nShame we couldn&rsquo;t see more of him.</p><p>In the aftermath of the failed heist, Tobias\nrounds on Han, angrily punching him for losing the coaxium. &nbsp;Here, it&rsquo;s revealed that Tobias and his late\nteammates weren&rsquo;t actually stealing the coaxium for themselves. &nbsp;Instead, they had been hired by Drydon Vos,\nthe leader of a criminal syndicate known as the Crimson Dawn. &nbsp;Now that the crate of coaxium is lost, Tobias\nis fearful for his life, as Drydon Vos is not known to be very understanding or\nforgiving. &nbsp;And he knows that he won&rsquo;t be\nable to run, as Drydon Vos would undoubtedly succeed in locating him, no matter\nwhere he might try to hide. &nbsp;In the hopes\nof convincing Drydon Vos to give him another chance, Tobias ends up going to\nseek an audience with him on the mob boss&rsquo; space yacht. &nbsp;But before he leaves, Tobias informs Han and\nChewbacca that this will be their last chance to get out of this mess. &nbsp;Because Drydon Vos currently has no idea that\neither of them even exist and will never know they were even involved with this\nif they back out now. &nbsp;But Han insists on\nseeing this through to the end, as he knows he can&rsquo;t pass up on this chance to\nget the money for this job. &nbsp;Chewbacca\nalso agrees to stick around. &nbsp;Maybe\nbecause he feels that this would eventually help him locate the other Wookiees\nthat were abducted and taken away from Kashyyyk.</p><p>When they arrive at Drydon Vos&rsquo; space yacht,\nTobias announces their presence to one of Drydon Vos&rsquo; goons. &nbsp;While waiting around to be summoned, Tobias\nand Chewbacca head off to get some drinks at the bar while Han decides to make\nhis way to the edge of the crowd to simply look out the window. &nbsp;But then, someone approaches him and taps his\nshoulder. &nbsp;To Han&rsquo;s shock and amazement,\nhe sees the person who has joined him at the window is none other than Qi&rsquo;ra,\nhis girlfriend from Corellia! &nbsp;Han is\noverjoyed to see her again, and he immediately starts to apologize for not\ncoming back for her, stating that he really had planned on doing so the moment\nhe&rsquo;d been able to buy his own ship. &nbsp;But\nQi&rsquo;ra waves away his apology, stating that it&rsquo;s all in the past and she doesn&rsquo;t\nresent him for not being able to keep his promise to her, also pointing out\nthat he would have been killed if he hadn&rsquo;t taken advantage of his chance to\nget off Corellia. &nbsp;It turns out that,\nafter she and Han were separated three years ago, Qi&rsquo;ra somehow became\nentangled into the Crimson Dawn and is essentially bound to Drydon Vos now.</p><p>But the two are not given much of a chance to\ncatch up, because that&rsquo;s when Tobias returns, announcing their meeting with\nDrydon Vos has been approved. &nbsp;Needless\nto say, Drydon Vos is not pleased when he finds out Tobias did not bring the\nshipment of coaxium that he&rsquo;d requested and is all set to kill him for this,\nunless Tobias can tell him exactly how he plans to make it up to him. &nbsp;Tobias therefore offers to locate and steal\nsome coaxium from a different source. &nbsp;Of\ncourse, this is easier said than done as coaxium is still super-rare, with the\nEmpire holding a cartel on the market. \nBut Han has an idea- they go right to the source and steal unprocessed\ncoaxium from the mines on the planet Kessel. \nOf course, this is an extremely risky plan, as unprocessed coaxium is\nextremely volatile, and if it&rsquo;s not processed within a certain time frame, then\nit will explode. &nbsp;Once again, however,\nHan has an idea. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s apparently a\nprocessing plant that&rsquo;s not controlled by the Empire, located on the planet\nSavareen. &nbsp;Although this plan is still\nextremely risky, as it would require them to make the infamous Kessel Run in\nless than twenty parsecs. &nbsp;And yes, I\nknow that a parsec is a unit of distance and not time. &nbsp;But maybe the implication is that the average\nKessel Run spans a distance that&rsquo;s over twenty parsecs, and to make the journey\nin less than twenty parsects is synonymous with finding a way to travel from\nMaine to California (a trip that should span 3,247 miles) in only 1,000\nmiles. &nbsp;But then again, this is just me\ntrying to make sense over a line that was probably only meant to give nerds\nsomething to harp on.</p><p>In any event, Drydon Vos ultimately agrees to\nHan&rsquo;s plan and, in what I&rsquo;m guessing was an attempt to make sure that Tobias,\nHan and Chewbacca follow through and don&rsquo;t just try to run, he has Qi&rsquo;ra\naccompany them. &nbsp;But before they can go\noff to steal the coaxium, they have to locate a suitably fast ship that would\nenable them to make the trip. \nFortunately, Qi&rsquo;ra knows where to find such a ship. &nbsp;She leads the group to this place on a snowy\nplanet called Vandor that kinda looks like a crashed luxury starship that has\nbeen converted into a gambling hall. \nThere, they encounter the smooth-talking Lando Calrissian, who boasts\nthat his ship is the fastest one in existence. \nHe&rsquo;s accompanied by L3-37, a female Piloting Droid that Lando apparently\nhad custom made to be his co-pilot. While I&rsquo;m sure some people might disagree\nwith me on this, I say L3 was the best character in this movie. &nbsp;Her claim to fame was the fact that she&rsquo;s a\nfierce advocate for Droid rights. &nbsp;When\nwe first meet her, she&rsquo;s angrily protesting a Droid battle ring that&rsquo;s being\nheld in the gambling hall, trying to reason with one of the Droids being used\nin the fighting and then getting into an argument with the Droid&rsquo;s owner. &nbsp; To be honest, I totally see her point in\nregards to her crusade. &nbsp;Even though\nDroids are clearly manmade, they are still programed with artificial\nintelligence, and they all seem to have their own personalities. &nbsp;It does present an interesting debate over\nwhat it means to be considered &lsquo;alive.&rsquo; \nAnd when you think of it, there does seem to be a prevailing\ndiscrimination towards Droids. &nbsp;For\ninstance, it seems like a lot of eateries won&rsquo;t serve Droids. &nbsp;And then there&rsquo;s Obi-Wan&rsquo;s comment in <i>Attack of the Clones</i>, in which he more\nor less stated that he didn&rsquo;t thing Droids were capable of independent\nthought. &nbsp;So, it could be argued that\nDroids are largely treated as robot slaves in the Star Wars universe, with each\ntype of Droid being automatically assigned a particular task from the moment\nthey&rsquo;re activated and never given the opportunity to rise above the task they\nwere issued upon their creation. &nbsp;For\ninstance, I don&rsquo;t recall seeing any Droids serving on the Galactic Senate\nduring the prequel trilogy.</p><p>Anyway, Han approaches Lando, with Tobias,\nChewbacca and Qi&rsquo;ra watching with the rest of the crowd, to ask him about his\nship. &nbsp;Lando states he won it in a game\nof Sabacc, which is basically this world&rsquo;s equivalent to poker. &nbsp;Han kinda chuckles at that, vocally wondering\nwhat kind of man bets his ship in a card game. \nEventually, he asks to be dealt into the game of Sabacc that Lando is\ncurrently playing with a handful of Aliens. \nNow, the build up to this moment is rather strange. &nbsp;Because before this scene, we had been given\nno sort of context as to what Han&rsquo;s gambling skill is like. &nbsp;Is he actually really good when it comes to\ngambling? &nbsp;Has he ever gambled or played\nSabacc before? &nbsp;But I guess he&rsquo;s quite\ngood, because he manages to stay in the game after everyone else has folded. &nbsp;So, in the end, it&rsquo;s just him against\nLando. &nbsp;In the final round, Lando ends up\nwagering his ship, which, of course, ends up being the Millennium Falcon. &nbsp;To counter this wager, Han also bets his own\nship. &nbsp;Which we know doesn&rsquo;t actually\nexist. &nbsp;However, Lando ends up winning\nthe game because he was cheating by hiding a stash of cards up his sleeve. &nbsp;After the game, Lando approaches the group to\nask where he can pick up the ship he supposedly won off of Han. &nbsp;Only to be told that it wasn&rsquo;t there. &nbsp; As a consolation prize, they fill him in on\ntheir plan to steal unprocessed coaxium from the mines on Kessel. &nbsp;They tell Lando that if he provides his ship\nfor the heist, then they will give him a cut of the money they&rsquo;ll get for the\ncoaxium. &nbsp;Lando doesn&rsquo;t seem to be\ncompletely thrilled with this arrangement, but he ultimately agrees to it,\nespecially when he sees Tobias is involved. \nApparently, Tobias had previously brought about the death of somebody\nLando owed a lot of money to, so Lando is grateful towards him for indirectly\nfreeing him from his debt.</p><p>And they&rsquo;re off to Kessel. &nbsp;Along the way, we get a few scenes of the\ncharacters just being characters. &nbsp;Qi&rsquo;ra\nis exploring the Falcon, finding that Lando seems to have a thing for\ncapes. &nbsp;She also has a moment with Han\nwhich leads to them passionately making out, only for them to be interrupted by\nTobias, who counsels Han that he&rsquo;d do well to not trust Qi&rsquo;ra so much, and that\nit&rsquo;s best to just expect everyone might betray him. &nbsp;Tobias and Chewbacca also play around with\nthat holographic chess board thing (with Chewbacca losing, much to his\nfrustration.) &nbsp;And we also get a whole\n&lsquo;girl talk&rsquo; moment with Qi&rsquo;ra and L3, with L3 observing that Han is still in\nlove with Qi&rsquo;ra. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s at this point that\nwe&rsquo;re told that Lando and L3&rsquo;s relationship is a bit more than just one between\npilot and co-pilot, and it&rsquo;s heavily implied they have a sexual\nrelationship. &nbsp;So I guess Lando is\npansexual? &nbsp;Okay, that&rsquo;s pretty\ninteresting. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think we see many\npansexual characters featured in the media, do we?</p><p>Eventually, they reach Kessel and, in order to\ninfiltrate the mine, Qi&rsquo;ra, Tobias and L3 masquerade as human traffickers and\npresent Han and Chewbacca as new workers for the mine. &nbsp;And you might notice that Tobias is wearing\nthe same disguise Lando will eventually wear in the first half of <i>Return of the Jedi</i>. &nbsp;Speaking of Lando, he&rsquo;s apparently hanging\nback on the Millennium Falcon to make another entry in his personal &lsquo;Lando\nChronicles.&rsquo; &nbsp;I guess we&rsquo;re supposed to\nconclude that Lando is a bit full of himself.</p><p>Upon being brought into the mines, Han and\nChewbacca both reveal that their restraints were not locked, and they\nimmediately break free and overpower the two guards bringing them down the mine\nelevator &nbsp;(with Chewbacca actually\nripping off somebody&rsquo;s arms.) &nbsp;Meanwhile,\nup in the control room, Qi&rsquo;ra gets to work on upholding her part of the plan,\nwhich involves her and Tobias taking out the mine foreman and guards so L3\ncould take over the control room&rsquo;s console, in order to gain access to the\nmine&rsquo;s security footage and use that to direct Han and Chewbacca to the chamber\nthe coaxium is stored in. &nbsp;However, in\nthe process, L3 finds she can&rsquo;t stand to turn a blind eye to the fact that\nDroids are being used to run the mine, especially when she spots a restraining\nbolt affixed to one of the Astromech Droids. \nShe ends up starting a complete riot by getting the Droids to free one\nother, which leads to all the other mine workers rising up and attempting to\nfight their way to freedom. &nbsp;Thankfully,\nthis creates a distraction that makes it possible for Han to locate the coaxium\nvault. &nbsp;Amidst the resulting turmoil, Han\nstarts to wheel them out to the Millennium Falcon. &nbsp;Chewbacca, on the other hand, briefly went\noff on his own when he spots some Wookiees laboring in the mines because he\nrecognized them as some of the Wookiees that were captured alongside him. &nbsp;But he ends up rejoining Han just in time to\nhelp him get the coaxium to the Millennium Falcon, with the other Wookiees\nhelping load the canisters onto the ship. \nAnd, when given the choice between staying with his Wookiee brethren or\nsticking with Han and the others, Chewbacca ultimately chooses the latter. &nbsp;Most likely because he&rsquo;s grown to genuinely\nconsider Han as a friend.</p><p>This whole prison break/coaxium heist quickly\nshifts into a huge gun battle as the mine workers try to escape. &nbsp;During the fight, L3 gets gunned down and Lando\nis also hit when he runs out to retrieve her. \nSadly, while Lando only ends up with an injured shoulder, L3 is damaged\nbeyond repair and ends up dying in Lando&rsquo;s arms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>With Lando out of commission and L3 gone, Han\nand Chewbacca (who admits to have gained some piloting experience during the\n190 years he&rsquo;s been alive) are the only ones capable of flying the ship away\nfrom Kessel. &nbsp;Unfortunately, their path\nback to Savareen is being blocked by an Imperial brigade, led by a Star\nDestroyer that immediately sends a fleet of TIE Fighters at them. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s speculated that the Imperial patrol had\nheard about the uprising on Kessel and had come to put an end to it. &nbsp;While they eventually manage to get rid of\nthe TIE Fighters, through a combination of Tobias manning the ship&rsquo;s gun and a\nrisky move by Han, they realize they lost a considerable amount of time, as the\ncoaxium is already starting to destabilize. \nIn a desperate attempt at making it to Savareen in time, Han suggests\ntaking a short cut through a cloudy &lsquo;tunnel&rsquo; inside the nebula cloud they&rsquo;re\ntraveling past. &nbsp;At first, everyone feels\nthis is crazy, as entering that cloud tunnel would most likely kill them, as it\ncontains a high number of plasma storms. \nBut Han points out that their current position is no better. &nbsp;In order to try and increase their chances at\nmaking through alive, it&rsquo;s decided to install the memory banks/navigational\narchives of L3 into the Millennium Falcon&rsquo;s motherboard. &nbsp;It was established earlier that L3 was\nprogramed with impeccable navigational skills. \nOnce L3&rsquo;s programing is fully installed within the Millennium Falcon,\nthey are able to navigate their way through the nebula cloud tunnel, despite\nsome trouble with a Space Kraken and a black hole of some kind. &nbsp;They evade the Space Kraken by launching off\nthe Millennium Falcon&rsquo;s escape pod to create a diversion (which explains why\nthe front of the ship wound up with that recognizable shape.) &nbsp;And to escape the black hole, they use a single\ndrop of the coaxium to power the ship&rsquo;s fusion reactor resulting in the\nMillennium Falcon getting a major speed boost that frees it from the pull of\nthe black hole</p><p>Finally, they manage to make it to\nSavareen. &nbsp;And thanks to Han&rsquo;s plan to\ntravel through the nebula cloud and L3&rsquo;s memory within the Millennium Falcon,\nthey made the Kessel Run in 12 parsects. \nWhile they&rsquo;re getting the coaxium processed, and for Drydon Vos to\narrive, Han and Qi&rsquo;ra have another scene together. &nbsp;Han tries to convince Qi&rsquo;ra to come away with\nhim when this is all over, but Qi&rsquo;ra tells him that&rsquo;s not possible due to her\ninvolvement with the Crimson Dawn. &nbsp;I\nguess the implication is that the Crimson Dawn is like the Mafia- once you&rsquo;re\nin it, you&rsquo;re in it for life. &nbsp;She tells\nHan that his feelings for her would change if he had any inking of the things\nshe&rsquo;s done as part of the Crimson Dawn. \nWhich I guess is meant to imply that she was utilized as their hit\nwoman, tasked with brutally murdering anyone they ordered her to. &nbsp;If that&rsquo;s the case, I can see why Qi&rsquo;ra\nwouldn&rsquo;t feel as if she&rsquo;s worthy of Han anymore, as he displays signs\nthroughout the movie that he has a strong moral compass and would never kill\nsomeone senselessly.</p><p>Anyway, their conversation is interrupted when\nthe Cloud Riders once again appear. \nThey&rsquo;ve been secretly tailing them throughout the movie. &nbsp;At first, Han tries to bluff his way out of\nthe situation, telling Enfys Nest that they have an entire armada on board the Millennium\nFalcon, waiting for his signal to attack them, but that bluff is quickly\ndeflated when Lando, who had slunk back to the Millennium Falcon earlier, flies\noff, leaving Han, Tobias, Chewbacca and Qi&rsquo;ra stranded. &nbsp;But this is when the first twist of the movie\ncomes. &nbsp;When Han and company state that\nDrydon Vos is on his way to claim the coaxium, Enfys Nest reveals herself as a\nyoung teenage girl. &nbsp;It turns out she and\nher band all were survivors of clans that the Crimson Dawn attacked and\nslaughtered. &nbsp;And that the reason why\nthey&rsquo;ve been attacking and tailing the protagonists is because they knew that\nDrydon Vos would only use the coaxium to lay waste to even more villages, and they&rsquo;d\nwanted to prevent him from doing so. &nbsp;In\nother words, the Cloud Riders were the good guys the whole time.</p><p>Han, upon hearing Enfys Nest&rsquo;s backstory,\nbegins to feel sympathetic to her and her group. &nbsp;As a result, he decides to double cross\nDrydon Vos by giving him vials of fake coaxium while giving the real stuff to\nthe Cloud Riders. &nbsp;When he reveals this\nplan to Tobias, the older man decides that he&rsquo;s not going to stick around as\nthe double cross might go wrong. &nbsp;Despite\nhis earlier insistence that it&rsquo;s pointless to run from Drydon Vos, he states\nhe&rsquo;s going to risk it now. &nbsp;However, this\nturns out to be a lie, as it&rsquo;s later revealed that he was actually going on\nahead to tip Drydon Vos off about the deception. &nbsp;So when Han, Chewbacca and Qi&rsquo;ra bring the\nchest of fake coaxium to the crime boss, he already knows that he&rsquo;s being\ndeceived, and has even sent his men to ambush the Cloud Riders before they\ncould leave with the coaxium. &nbsp;But then,\nHan reveals he&rsquo;d already anticipated Tobias&rsquo; betrayal. &nbsp;And as such, when the goons attack the Cloud\nRiders, they only find empty chests. \nBecause the real coaxium is in the chest Han brought to Drydon Vos.</p><p>And this is when the movie gets to be a bit\ndizzying. &nbsp;Because once he finds out that\nthe real coaxium is there, Tobias decides to claim it for his own, drawing a\nblaster on everyone. &nbsp;He ends up taking\nChewbacca hostage, forcing him to carry the chest of coaxium for him. &nbsp;Admittedly, this doesn&rsquo;t make much\nsense. &nbsp;Chewbacca is a Wookiee. &nbsp;One we&rsquo;d previously seen ripping off\nsomeone&rsquo;s arms. &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t tell me he\ncouldn&rsquo;t have easily overpowered Tobias here.</p><p>Regardless, Tobias and Chewbacca leave with the\ncoaxium. &nbsp;Once they&rsquo;re gone, a full-on\nfight breaks out between Han and Drydon Vos, with Han using the blaster he&rsquo;d\ngotten from Tobias earlier in the film and Drydon Vos wielding these molten\nduel knives. &nbsp;After this fight sequence\ngoes on for a little bit, Qi&rsquo;ra enters the fray, seemingly coming to Drydon\nVos&rsquo; defense by pointing some kind of split sword at Han. &nbsp;But then, she turns on Drydon Vos, stabbing\nhim clean through.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>After Drydon Vos&rsquo; death, Qi&rsquo;ra urges Han to go\nafter Tobias, telling him to get the coaxium to the Cloud Raiders. &nbsp;She refrains from going with him, however,\nstating that she&rsquo;ll catch up to him later. \nHowever, after Han leaves, Qi&rsquo;ra reveals she has no intention of\nrejoining him, as she takes Drydon&rsquo; Vos&rsquo; ring, which I suppose was a symbol of\nhis rank in the Crimson Dawn. &nbsp;I guess\nthat, now that he&rsquo;s dead, Qi&rsquo;ra is taking over his position. &nbsp;However, it&rsquo;s then revealed that Drydon Vos\nwasn&rsquo;t the highest ranking member of the Crimson Dawn, because Qi&rsquo;ra uses the\nring to contact the true leader of the criminal syndicate, giving him a cover\nstory that Drydon Vos was killed by Tobias and that she was the only one who\nsurvived the assault. &nbsp;At first, the\nidentity of the Crimson Dawn leader is hidden by the hood he was wearing. &nbsp;But when the hood is lowered, the mysterious\nfigure is revealed to be Darth Maul.</p><p>Wait, WHAT?! \nBut&hellip;<i>how? &nbsp;</i>He&rsquo;s dead! &nbsp;We saw him die in <i>Phantom Menace</i>! &nbsp;He got\nsliced in two and then fell down a deep pit. &nbsp; \nHow could <i>anyone</i> have survived\nthat?! &nbsp;And before anyone can try to\nargue this by saying it could have been a <i>different</i>\nDathomirian? &nbsp;No, it&rsquo;s not. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s Darth Maul. &nbsp;I even checked the end credits, and they\nclearly stated that this was indeed Maul. \nHow in Coruscant did this guy survive getting split in half and falling\ndown a bottomless pit? &nbsp;Are they going to\ntry and claim Palpatine survived after the events of <i>Return of the Jedi</i>, too?&nbsp; &nbsp;Seriously, first it was Red Skull appearing in <i>Infinity War</i>, and now this!&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like an explanation for this, please!</p><p>Anyway, Darth Maul orders Qi&rsquo;ra to meet him on\nhis home planet, where he plans to keep a much closer eye on her. &nbsp;Whether or not he knows she wasn&rsquo;t complelty\nhonest with him is anyone&rsquo;s guess. \nMeanwhile, Han catches up to Tobias and Chewbacca, confronting the\nformer over the matter of the coaxium. &nbsp;(Not\nentirely sure how Han managed to get ahead of them as Tobias had a considerable\nhead start, but oh well.) &nbsp;In response,\nTobias starts to reach for his blaster, but then makes the mistake of going off\non this whole spiel about how Han needs to learn a lessson. &nbsp;Han, however, doesn&rsquo;t mess around with\nformalities and fatally shoots Tobias. \nWith his final words, Tobias commends Han for not hesitating to do what\nhe had to, also while lamenting that he never got the chance to pursue his\ndream to be a musician.</p><p>In the aftermath of the adventure, Han and\nChewbacca willingly pass the coaxium over to Enfys Nest, who reveals she plans\nto deliver it to the Rebel Alliance. &nbsp;She\nsuggests that Han consider joining the resistance himself, but Han declines,\nstating that it&rsquo;s highly unlikely that he&rsquo;ll change his mind on the\nmatter. &nbsp;Though those who have seen the\noriginal trilogy already know that he&rsquo;ll eventually change his tune. &nbsp;In gratitude for his help, Enfys Nest gifts\nHan and Chewbacca with a small vial of coaxium.</p><p>Later on, Han and Chewbacca manage to locate\nLando again, this time on some kind of lush jungle planet. &nbsp;Needless to say, Han is fully ready to give\nLando a piece of his mind about how he&rsquo;d stranded them all on Savareen. &nbsp;But that&rsquo;s when he catches a brief glimpse of\nthe card dispenser mechanism affixed to Lando&rsquo;s wrist. &nbsp;Right always, he realizes that Lando had\ncheated in their earlier game of Sabacc. \nDeciding to get one up on him, Han challenges Lando to a rematch,\noffering his vial of coaxium as a starting wager. &nbsp;Lando readily accepts, not realizing until\nthe final round of their game that Han manages to swipe the cards he was\nconcealing up his sleeve. &nbsp;As a result,\nHan is able to win the Millennium Falcon fair and square, a fact that Lando\nbegrudgingly accepts. &nbsp;And so, with their\nnewly won ship, Han and Chewbacca set off, deciding to set a course for\nTatooine, as Tobias had mentioned earlier that there was a big shot gangster\nputting together a crew of smugglers on that particular planet. &nbsp;While it&rsquo;s never specifically stated, I\nsuppose we can only conclude they&rsquo;re referring to Jabba. &nbsp;Which explains how Han and Chewbacca got\ninvolved with him in the first place. \nAnd so, the movie ends with the pair flying off, with the Millennium\nFalcon jumping into light speed.</p><p>All in all, I think this was a really good\norigin story for Han Solo. &nbsp;And, dare I\nsay it, I actually enjoyed this movie more than <i>The Last Jedi</i>. &nbsp;Not that <i>The Last Jedi </i>was an awful movie, of\ncourse. &nbsp;But my attitude after seeing\nthat one was more or less &lsquo;<i>eh, okay, I\nguess I&rsquo;ll see you guys again in a few years.</i>&rsquo; &nbsp;With this movie, on the other hand, I really\nwanted to see what happened next. &nbsp;What\nhappened to Qi&rsquo;ra? &nbsp;Is she actually a\nSith Lord training under Darth Maul? &nbsp;Did\nshe and Han ever see each other again? &nbsp;Obviously,\nsomething happens that enables Han to decide to move on from her, considering\nhe eventually pursues a relationship with Leia. \nWhile Han is sometimes seen as a womanizer by some members of the\nfandom, that reputation always seemed rather undeserved, as he appears to be\nmore of a one-woman man. &nbsp;So did Qi&rsquo;ra\nend up dying at some point between now and <i>A\nNew Hope</i>? &nbsp;(I suppose it&rsquo;s possible\nshe ended up horribly betraying him somehow somewhere down the line, but the\nfact that Han obviously held on to the golden pair of dice that they kept\npassing back and forth throughout the movie makes it seem like he still\nregarded her memory with fondness, so I doubt anything went sour between them.\n) Also, is that all there was to the backstory between Han and Lando&rsquo;s\nfriendship, or did they cross paths a few more times over the years? &nbsp;The movie gave us this open ending that left\nyou with a lot of questions, but not to the point where it felt as if the\nplotpoints were left unresolved. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s\nquite rare to find a movie that can achieve that sort of balance. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s just say that if they turned this movie\ninto a trilogy as well, you certainly wouldn&rsquo;t hear me complain.</p><p>As for the actor who portrayed the younger\nversion of Han, I think he did a good job. \nObviously, nobody was going to live up to Harrison Ford. &nbsp;But there were moments when I looked at Alden\nEhrenreich and I really thought he looked like a younger version of Han. &nbsp;And I thought the way they presented this\nyounger version of him to be quite good. \nSure, the Han of the original trilogy made a clear effort at portraying\nhimself as a scoundrel, but at the same time, it was always evident that he was\na good man at his core. &nbsp;At the end of the\nday, he was the one who would ultimately do the right thing, because he can&rsquo;t\ncompletely turn off his moral compass when he sees people in trouble. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s why he came back at the moment of truth\nduring the battle of the first Death Star. \nI also liked how the movie left it rather vague over whether Chewbacca\nwas searching for his family or just his tribe. \nI&rsquo;m not entirely sure, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure that bit was made to appeal\nto both the fans who consider the infamous holiday special to be canon and\nthose who refuse to acknowledge its existence. \n(Oh, don&rsquo;t worry- I&rsquo;ll post my review to <i>that one</i> on the 22<sup>nd</sup>.)</p><p>Though, I will admit it was a bit off-putting\nthat the two characters I particularly liked- Rio and L3- were both killed\noff. &nbsp;Though, at least we have the\nknowledge that L3 will live on in a sense, which does help soften the\nblow. &nbsp;She&rsquo;s now forever a part of the\nMillennium Falcon&rsquo;s mainframe. &nbsp;Though,\neven if she wasn&rsquo;t, the untimely deaths of my two favorite characters in this\nparticular instalment of the franchise wasn&rsquo;t enough to taint my enjoyment of\nthe movie. &nbsp;After all, character death\nisn&rsquo;t a foreign concept in these Star Wars anthology movies.</p><p>On that note, <i>Rouge One</i> will be the subject of next week&rsquo;s review. &nbsp;And then, it&rsquo;s on to the original trilogy. </p><p><a href=\"http://tomeandflickcorner.tumblr.com/post/173577729578/hello-everyone-its-come-to-my-attention-that\">(Click here to go back to the directory)</a></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>Okay, wow! \nThis movie was unbelievable! \nRemember how we can all pretty much agree that <i>The Last Jedi</i> had moments that kinda fell flat? &nbsp;Well, I think I figured out the reason\nwhy. &nbsp;It was because they were putting\nall their effort into this movie. &nbsp;Now,\njust to warn everyone- because this is a review, I WILL be spoiling the plot of\nthis movie. &nbsp;So if you plan on reading\nbeyond this point before you actually go see the movie yourself, then that&rsquo;s on\nyou.</p>",
