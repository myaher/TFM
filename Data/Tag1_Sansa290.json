But, I want you  to know that I am your friend, and I only want what&rsquo;s best for you.&rdquo;</p><p>Petyr leaned himself further back, until the bed gave way to his  additional weight with a serious of creaks and groans. Petyr ignored  them, he simply laid his hand close to my own and continued, &ldquo;At this  very moment, the Queen is offering a lordship for the price of your  head. Your husband is rotting away in some prison cell awaiting his  execution. But you, my dear, are sailing away from harm&rsquo;s way undetected  by Lannister spies, but that all could change if I let you freely walk  around my ship alone, so you must understand the reason I am keeping you  locked away in this room.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F14898626%2Fchapters%2F34506386&amp;t=ZWI3YWRiYzZmODFiMDg3MzFlM2Y2NmVjZDQ3YjVlNmEwYWJjYmU2Nyw3NmM4YTY2NWI5MzM2ZjU0ZDE5OWFmNzlmNmM5Y2I1ODQ3MjI0NzI0\"><i>The Strange Tales of Doctor Strange</i></a></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9a036c4435493843e8d24932ea0cc8c7/tumblr_pewcqzf1yH1vok76f_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/></figure><p><i>This is a bad idea,</i> I thought, as I ducked into an alleyway and began to jog down the length of it. <i>I\u2019m such a stupid girl, and I never learn.</i></p><p>There was nothing on me, no purse, no phone, only a skimpy sky-blue dress that would undoubtedly attract unwanted attention.

The body  was still there, Lord Baelish\u2019s pale figure was laid out upon the  table. His neck was severed; his eyes were shut. He smelt of death and  decay. The priest laid a hand on the dead man\u2019s chest, trailing his  fingers down the silver scar that once cut the man in two.

I  was so high up on this eminence, it was enough for me to see the  rolling hills and the tree tops of the forbidden forest.</p><p><i>I\u2019m home,</i>  I thought, as I watched the trees sway in the soft willowing wind. \u00a0The  wind carried voices as well, hundreds of cries could be heard as  children continued to flow out of the train station. In a matter of  hours, a few hundred first-year students would take their first few  steps up the mountainous terrain which would inevitably lead to  Hogwarts.</p><p>I heard a cry of phoenix above my head, it flashed  through the gunmetal sky like a bright comet of fire. There was magic  here, it could be felt everywhere. Perhaps, that\u2019s why I\u2019m so happy to  be back home, or that\u2019s what I tried to convince myself as I skipped  down the last set of stairs.</p><p>Hogwarts had been closed for over a  year; it was for our own safety, or at least that is what the Headmaster  had claimed when he sent out a letter to all the students. But I knew  the true reason why no student could trespass these large stony walls  until now. There was a danger which lurked in the shadows, it slithers  through the walls, griped at our throats when we weren\u2019t looking. </p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F13601565%2Fchapters%2F31224447&amp;t=ZGNlZGVjNTZjNWNkMjQ3NWY4MDZhMTA0MWM4NTZhZmI2ODc2OWY2ZSxiNWZmZTViOWUxNDY0N2VkZGE1OGNjODczYzVmNWI2OThkY2VjYmYx\"><i>The Mockingbird\u2019s Song</i></a></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b0631d75c658cd543bac4b3983280098/tumblr_pewcr9mvrO1vok76f_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"></figure><p>The sound of heavy footfalls outside my door released me from my  cheerless solitude. A key pierced through the golden lock and then  erupted, before my door swung open to allow a shadow to slip through. In  the candlelight, Lord Baelish\u2019s tired, forlorn face was revealed; deep  lines etched beneath his grey-green eyes as he stared back at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you, sweetling,\u201d he whispered, as he sat down  at the edge of my bed.

But, I want you  to know that I am your friend, and I only want what\u2019s best for you.\u201d</p><p>Petyr leaned himself further back, until the bed gave way to his  additional weight with a serious of creaks and groans. Petyr ignored  them, he simply laid his hand close to my own and continued, \u201cAt this  very moment, the Queen is offering a lordship for the price of your  head. Your husband is rotting away in some prison cell awaiting his  execution. But you, my dear, are sailing away from harm\u2019s way undetected  by Lannister spies, but that all could change if I let you freely walk  around my ship alone, so you must understand the reason I am keeping you  locked away in this room.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F14898626%2Fchapters%2F34506386&amp;t=ZWI3YWRiYzZmODFiMDg3MzFlM2Y2NmVjZDQ3YjVlNmEwYWJjYmU2Nyw3NmM4YTY2NWI5MzM2ZjU0ZDE5OWFmNzlmNmM5Y2I1ODQ3MjI0NzI0\"><i>The Strange Tales of Doctor Strange</i></a></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9a036c4435493843e8d24932ea0cc8c7/tumblr_pewcqzf1yH1vok76f_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"></figure><p><i>This is a bad idea,</i> I thought, as I ducked into an alleyway and began to jog down the length of it. <i>I\u2019m such a stupid girl, and I never learn.</i></p><p>There was nothing on me, no purse, no phone, only a skimpy sky-blue dress that would undoubtedly attract unwanted attention.

In a matter of  hours, a few hundred first-year students would take their first few  steps up the mountainous terrain which would inevitably lead to  Hogwarts.</p><p>I heard a cry of phoenix above my head, it flashed  through the gunmetal sky like a bright comet of fire. There was magic  here, it could be felt everywhere. Perhaps, that\u2019s why I\u2019m so happy to  be back home, or that\u2019s what I tried to convince myself as I skipped  down the last set of stairs.</p><p>Hogwarts had been closed for over a  year; it was for our own safety, or at least that is what the Headmaster  had claimed when he sent out a letter to all the students. But I knew  the true reason why no student could trespass these large stony walls  until now. There was a danger which lurked in the shadows, it slithers  through the walls, griped at our throats when we weren\u2019t looking. </p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F13601565%2Fchapters%2F31224447&amp;t=ZGNlZGVjNTZjNWNkMjQ3NWY4MDZhMTA0MWM4NTZhZmI2ODc2OWY2ZSxiNWZmZTViOWUxNDY0N2VkZGE1OGNjODczYzVmNWI2OThkY2VjYmYx\"><i>The Mockingbird\u2019s Song</i></a></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b0631d75c658cd543bac4b3983280098/tumblr_pewcr9mvrO1vok76f_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"></figure><p>The sound of heavy footfalls outside my door released me from my  cheerless solitude. A key pierced through the golden lock and then  erupted, before my door swung open to allow a shadow to slip through. In  the candlelight, Lord Baelish\u2019s tired, forlorn face was revealed; deep  lines etched beneath his grey-green eyes as he stared back at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you, sweetling,\u201d he whispered, as he sat down  at the edge of my bed.

Petyr ignored  them, he simply laid his hand close to my own and continued, \u201cAt this  very moment, the Queen is offering a lordship for the price of your  head. Your husband is rotting away in some prison cell awaiting his  execution. But you, my dear, are sailing away from harm\u2019s way undetected  by Lannister spies, but that all could change if I let you freely walk  around my ship alone, so you must understand the reason I am keeping you  locked away in this room.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F14898626%2Fchapters%2F34506386&amp;t=ZWI3YWRiYzZmODFiMDg3MzFlM2Y2NmVjZDQ3YjVlNmEwYWJjYmU2Nyw3NmM4YTY2NWI5MzM2ZjU0ZDE5OWFmNzlmNmM5Y2I1ODQ3MjI0NzI0\"><i>The Strange Tales of Doctor Strange</i></a></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9a036c4435493843e8d24932ea0cc8c7/tumblr_pewcqzf1yH1vok76f_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"></figure><p><i>This is a bad idea,</i> I thought, as I ducked into an alleyway and began to jog down the length of it. <i>I\u2019m such a stupid girl, and I never learn.</i></p><p>There was nothing on me, no purse, no phone, only a skimpy sky-blue dress that would undoubtedly attract unwanted attention.

She offered me a sheepish grin, before she  wandered throughout the room in search of a seat.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one  here,\u201d I remarked, while pointing out an empty chair in front of me. She  was so nervous, the poor thing, she almost tip-toed towards her seat;  her cheeks were flushed a crimson red, an amusing shade that nearly  rivaled her bright auburn hair. Her pale blue eyes were unwilling to  look into my own. <i>Was she ashamed or just scared to lock her eyes with mine, </i> I wondered. I\u2019ll probably never know the answer to that question, for she had  every intention to stare down at her impeccably white shoes until I  looked away from her.</p><p><b>Patterns: </b>I tend to open up a chapter with dialogue or the character\u2019s inner thoughts.

This new Petyr- this man  who threw on a tarnished leather jacket while talking to Mariam was so  very different from the man I loved. He brushed his curly bangs away  from his face, half squinting at Mariam after he made a harmless joke.  She laughed at him, covering her mouth as he leaned into her ear to  whisper something sinful.</p><p>&ldquo;Petyr!&rdquo; she cried out and swatted him away like an irritating fly.</p><p>He  bit down on his bottom lip, smirking at her with narrowed eyes. She  shoved him away playfully and looked down the hall to see me  approaching. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she mouthed, and Petyr caught her shocked expression  and his earnest gaze soon followed. His eyebrows raised in surprise, the  lines around his face smoothed over as he stared at me with a pleased  expression.</p><p><i>Its not him,</i> I reminded myself, after he shoved his hands deep into his jeans pockets. <i>He&rsquo;s too young for one thing, and too&hellip;</i></p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F13768119&amp;t=NjQzMzJkY2UwMmJkMjk1OWM3ZTE4MjU5Nzg4M2QzYzcxNjE3YjNhYixjYzc2MTVmMWE1NjE1N2IxYTg5NGI4OTQ0YTUyNThkMDNiNmNjZTU2\"><i>Proven Wrong</i></a></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/673baabe8f354a49191f0cde19c9643e/tumblr_pewcqx1Ufr1vok76f_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>I wandered around the edges of the castle, letting my fingers slide  against the slick wet bricks that was still damp from the morning rain. I  was so high up on this eminence, it was enough for me to see the  rolling hills and the tree tops of the forbidden forest.</p><p><i>I&rsquo;m home,</i>  I thought, as I watched the trees sway in the soft willowing wind. &nbsp;The  wind carried voices as well, hundreds of cries could be heard as  children continued to flow out of the train station. In a matter of  hours, a few hundred first-year students would take their first few  steps up the mountainous terrain which would inevitably lead to  Hogwarts.</p><p>I heard a cry of phoenix above my head, it flashed  through the gunmetal sky like a bright comet of fire. There was magic  here, it could be felt everywhere. Perhaps, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so happy to  be back home, or that&rsquo;s what I tried to convince myself as I skipped  down the last set of stairs.</p><p>Hogwarts had been closed for over a  year; it was for our own safety, or at least that is what the Headmaster  had claimed when he sent out a letter to all the students. But I knew  the true reason why no student could trespass these large stony walls  until now. There was a danger which lurked in the shadows, it slithers  through the walls, griped at our throats when we weren&rsquo;t looking. </p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F13601565%2Fchapters%2F31224447&amp;t=ZGNlZGVjNTZjNWNkMjQ3NWY4MDZhMTA0MWM4NTZhZmI2ODc2OWY2ZSxiNWZmZTViOWUxNDY0N2VkZGE1OGNjODczYzVmNWI2OThkY2VjYmYx\"><i>The Mockingbird&rsquo;s Song</i></a></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b0631d75c658cd543bac4b3983280098/tumblr_pewcr9mvrO1vok76f_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The sound of heavy footfalls outside my door released me from my  cheerless solitude. A key pierced through the golden lock and then  erupted, before my door swung open to allow a shadow to slip through. In  the candlelight, Lord Baelish&rsquo;s tired, forlorn face was revealed; deep  lines etched beneath his grey-green eyes as he stared back at me.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to hurt you, sweetling,&rdquo; he whispered, as he sat down  at the edge of my bed. His fingers ran through my disheveled sheets, as  he murmured, &ldquo;I imagine you are growing quite lonely by now. Locked away  in your room for days&hellip; without a soul to speak too. But, I want you  to know that I am your friend, and I only want what&rsquo;s best for you.&rdquo;</p><p>Petyr leaned himself further back, until the bed gave way to his  additional weight with a serious of creaks and groans. Petyr ignored  them, he simply laid his hand close to my own and continued, &ldquo;At this  very moment, the Queen is offering a lordship for the price of your  head. Your husband is rotting away in some prison cell awaiting his  execution. But you, my dear, are sailing away from harm&rsquo;s way undetected  by Lannister spies, but that all could change if I let you freely walk  around my ship alone, so you must understand the reason I am keeping you  locked away in this room.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F14898626%2Fchapters%2F34506386&amp;t=ZWI3YWRiYzZmODFiMDg3MzFlM2Y2NmVjZDQ3YjVlNmEwYWJjYmU2Nyw3NmM4YTY2NWI5MzM2ZjU0ZDE5OWFmNzlmNmM5Y2I1ODQ3MjI0NzI0\"><i>The Strange Tales of Doctor Strange</i></a></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9a036c4435493843e8d24932ea0cc8c7/tumblr_pewcqzf1yH1vok76f_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>This is a bad idea,</i> I thought, as I ducked into an alleyway and began to jog down the length of it. <i>I&rsquo;m such a stupid girl, and I never learn.</i></p><p>There was nothing on me, no purse, no phone, only a skimpy sky-blue dress that would undoubtedly attract unwanted attention. I&rsquo;m almost there,  I told myself, as I picked up the pace despite the towering heels I was  in. The cold air rushed past me, the streets of New York was unusually  quiet tonight. A bad sign, I rather be lost in a rush of commotion than  be lost in this dark alley looking for the bar that I left not to long  ago.</p><p><i>I think its here,</i> I thought, and turned the corner into a busy street where people were coming and going as they please. <i>A typical Friday night,</i> I thought, and jay-crossed across the street to the lit-up tavern across the road. <i>The Temple </i>was illuminated with red letters, and the black and gold doors were silently entreating me to open it. <i>Here goes nothing,</i> I thought, and swung open the door to walk in.</p><p>A  few people looked over the brim of their cup to ogle at me, a  red-headed girl in a strapless dress was an unusual sight, even in New  York.

I should have never been called in to  teach, but here I am standing in front of a classroom with nothing but  my wits to sustain me.</p><p>&ldquo;Economics!&rdquo; I exclaimed, a thrill rang  through my voice as I uttered the word. &ldquo;It is the foundation of our  society, the building block for all businesses. To understand it, is to  succeed- not only in your professional life, but in your personal one as  well.&rdquo;</p><p>A loud boom resounded throughout the room as a student let  the door slam behind her. She offered me a sheepish grin, before she  wandered throughout the room in search of a seat.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one  here,&rdquo; I remarked, while pointing out an empty chair in front of me. She  was so nervous, the poor thing, she almost tip-toed towards her seat;  her cheeks were flushed a crimson red, an amusing shade that nearly  rivaled her bright auburn hair. Her pale blue eyes were unwilling to  look into my own. <i>Was she ashamed or just scared to lock her eyes with mine, </i> I wondered. I&rsquo;ll probably never know the answer to that question, for she had  every intention to stare down at her impeccably white shoes until I  looked away from her.</p><p><b>Patterns: </b>I tend to open up a chapter with dialogue or the character&rsquo;s inner thoughts. I also ease my way into the storyline, before I put in the real drama and angst. I guess this is the smooth, flat part of the rollercoaster ride before I take you on a ride.

Best believe Sansa Stark, the character who is religiously underrated, will rise in season 8 and those who slept on her will be shocked! </p>",
