The targaryens were overthrown, Robert Baratheon was the king and his legitimate kids would be the rightful heir to the throne. But Robert doesn&rsquo;t have any. Therefore there is no rightful heir to the throne(I guess Cersei&rsquo;s kids would be the rightful heir at this time actually). It does not work like that. Jon can fight for the throne back, but he is not the rightful heir. At all. In any way because it doesnt work that way. </p><p>Jon doesnt have more claim to the throne over Daenerys because as I said, the Targaryens are not on the throne. If Daenerys wants the throne, she has claim to it. Jon cant order Daenerys to stop going after the throne because he wants it or because hes Rheagers son and feels that he because of that hes the only one who should be on the throne. That&rsquo;s stupid and makes zero sense. Daenerys cant feel threatened because Jon has no claim to that throne. At all. It just makes me annoyed that people keep saying that and the show is trying to  build that up when it doesn&rsquo;t work that way. Like honestly, if Robert knew Jon was Rheagers son and ned convinced Robert to keep Jon alive, would Jon be on the throne, or would Robert still be the king.</p><p>Theres no true heir. Unless the show Is that cliche, and let&rsquo;s be honest, Jon and Daenerys are the most cliche characters in the entire show, then Jon is only being claimed as the true heir because of a cliche</p><p>On top of that, can people stop claiming that Jon has some sort of ownership of Daenerys&rsquo;s dragons. She is their mother. Jon snow is someone they just met. They will not betray her for Jon snow. (I mean, I guess they would because I don&rsquo;t know how dragons loyalty works in this world)</p>",
