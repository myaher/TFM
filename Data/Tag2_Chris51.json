your screams waking up not only you and Chris, but\nDodger as he fled from the room each night. \nYour voice was hoarse, throat soar from the screams. \u00a0</p><p>You didn\u2019t want to forget what happened with your mother,\nyou just wanted to be able to sleep without being plagued with those memories\neach time you closed your eyes. \u00a0</p><p>As much as he didn\u2019t want to leave you for too long, he had\nno choice as it pertained to a business meeting for an upcoming film he had\nbeen dreaming about directing. \u00a0You\nassured him time and time again that you would be fine for the day by yourself. \u00a0It was a Saturday morning that he left, and\nwouldn\u2019t be home until late afternoon or even early evening. \u00a0</p><p>By 10 a.m that morning, you gave up on trying to get any\nsleep and instead went to sit on the couch in the living room. \u00a0You were exhausted from all the therapy\nappointments and getting maybe two hours of sleep a night; it was draining on\nyour mind and body. \u00a0The medications they\nalso gave you were making you feel somewhat of a zombie, but you knew it would\ntake weeks to get the right doses for you and for you to start feeling yourself\nagain. \u00a0</p><p>Spending the day staring blankly at the television, not even\nbothering to pay attention to what was on the screen is what you had done. \u00a0You felt numb and broken all over again; the\nmemories invading your mind like a plague, never letting you forget. \u00a0You just wanted a little piece of quiet; it\nwas all you asked for but never received. \nGuilt rippled through you and you didn\u2019t think you could handle any\nmore.</p><p>You remembered how this had already happened to you; how you\nalready overcame this struggle once in your lifetime. \u00a0It never occurred to you how hard it could be\nto go through the same exact thing a second time. \u00a0Your heart was heavy just thinking about it\nand it broke you. \u00a0You didn\u2019t want\nthis. \u00a0You just wanted it to end; to stop\nthe misery. \u00a0</p><p>Checking your phone, you saw there were missed texts from\nChris. \u00a0</p><p><b>3 P.M</b></p><p><b>Chris: Hey\nsweetheart, just checking in with you. \u00a0I\nmiss you. \u00a0</b></p><p><b>4:30 P.M</b></p><p><b>Chris: I love you\nErica</b></p><p><b>5:15 P.M</b></p><p><b>Chris: The meeting is\ntaking longer than I thought. \u00a0I\u2019m so\nsorry sweetheart. \u00a0I\u2019ll call you as soon\nas I leave. \u00a0I can pick up some dinner if\nyou\u2019d like. \u00a0Let me know</b></p><p>More guilt seeped into your body and you were overcome with\ntears spilling from your cheek. \u00a0Dodger\nsat by your feet, whimpering at your sadness. \nChris didn\u2019t deserve the mess that you had become. \u00a0He deserved someone happy; someone he could\nshare his joy with. \u00a0Even though he said\nthere was nothing you could do for him to leave you, you just didn\u2019t think you\nwere strong enough to go through this a second time. \u00a0</p><p>You decided to give him a text, not wanting to worry him to\nthe point where he would leave his meeting early and ruin such a great\nopportunity. \u00a0</p><p><b>Erica: Just sitting\nhere with Dodger and watching some tv. \u00a0I\u2019ll\nsee you when you get home. \u00a0</b></p><p>Grabbing a bottle of vodka from the cabinet, you went into\nthe bedroom and pulled out a box of photos from a box hidden in the\ncloset. \u00a0It had been there since when you\nmoved in with Chris; but had been forgotten until your memories found their way\nto you again. \u00a0</p><p>Opening the bottle of vodka, you took a giant swig and\nplanted your ass on the floor. \u00a0Lifting\nthe lid off the box, you began to sift through the photos; your heart clenching\nwith each pass of your eyes over the glossy memories. \u00a0 Pictures of your mother and you; pictures of\nyou and Sebastian during happier times; and pictures of you and Chris. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cGaahhhh!\u201d you screamed, throwing the box against the wall\nas you began to chug more of the vodka. \nOne of the pictures landed face up, sitting just at your feet. \u00a0It was a picture of you and your mother; the\nlast picture that was ever taken of the two of you. \u00a0You were spending the weekend with her; it\nwas a mere few weeks before you found out you were pregnant. \u00a0\u201cWHY???\u201d your anguish scream ripped through\nyour throat as your tears cascaded down your face. \u00a0Tears mixed with the alcohol began to blur\nyour vision as you got up on shaky legs and made your way into the master\nbathroom. \u00a0</p><p>Looking at yourself in the mirror you could see a younger\nversion of your mother making everything hurt that much more. \u00a0Turning around you went to the large tub and\nturned the water on; not even bother if it was hot or cold. \u00a0Your cell phone began to ring and you saw it\nwas Chris; indicating he must finally be done with his meeting. \u00a0As your finger hovered over the green button\nto answer, you decided you couldn\u2019t talk to him. \u00a0Not like this. </p><p>Putting the phone down you opened the cabinet under the\nsink, finding what you were looking for. \nIt was in a black sleek case. \u00a0Chris\nhad received it as a gift from Scott for Christmas. \u00a0Opening it, you took out the straight razor\nthat was meant for trimming up his beard; just like they did at the barbers\nback in the day. \u00a0</p><p>Stopping the water, you grabbed your phone and the straight razor,\nsetting it on the stool next to the tub. \nTaking a few more large chugs of vodka, you submerged yourself into the\nbath, fully clothed as water splashed onto the tiled floor. \u00a0The water was slightly warm but your body\nfelt chilled thinking about what was to come. \n \u00a0</p><p>Taking a deep breath, you decided to call Sebastian before\nanything happened. \u00a0Pulling up his name,\nyou pressed send and began to hear the ringing. \nWithout eating all day and the copious amounts of alcohol in your\nsystem, you could barely keep yourself upright in the tub; your body constantly\nsliding down further into the deep tub. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey Erica,\u201d Sebastian\u2019s cheery voice greeted you, only\nmaking you cry harder. \u00a0\u201cHey hey hey\u2026what\u2019s\nwrong sweetie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026can\u2019t\u2026do\u2026.this\u2026anymore,\u201d you wailed between labored breaths. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cErica,\u201d Sebastian called your name, but you could barely\nhear him through your consistent crying. \n\u201cERICA,\u201d he yelled this time. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt hurts\u2026it hurts SO much Sebby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Chris Erica? \nTell me where he is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt\u2026at a meeting. \nDunno when he will he be\u2019re,\u201d your words slurred heavily. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHave you been drinking? \nErica you know you can\u2019t drink with the medications you are on. \u00a0Where are you right now?\u201d \u00a0Sebastian\u2019s voice was laced with worry. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIn tha tub. \u00a0Hard to\u2026.,\u201d\nyour words cut off as your head slipped the water. \u00a0As you emerged from the water you gasped for\nbreath. \u00a0Luckily your phone was\nwaterproof. </p><p>\u201cERICA!!! \nERICA!!! \u00a0ARE YOU ALRIGHT?,\u201d you\nheard Seb yelling. \u00a0</p><p>You coughed up water before replying. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m\u2026.i\u2019m just ready for it ta end. \u00a0End it all!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMargarita call police to Chris\u2019 house and then call him,\u201d Sebastian\nsaid to his girlfriend. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWill you do me a favor Sebby?\u201d your voice began to quiver\nat the thought of what was about to happen. \n\u201cWill you-will you tell Chris I love him?\u201d \u00a0You ended the call, throwing your phone onto\nthe floor as it shattered into pieces. \u00a0</p><p>~~~</p><p>Out of nowhere, Chris felt a sense of dread wash over his\nbody as he drove down the freeway, just wanting to get back to the house with\nyou. \u00a0His meeting went way too long and\nhe hadn\u2019t heard from you except for that one text. \u00a0His phone began to ring and he saw Margarita\u2019s\nname pop up. \u00a0Confused, he answered\nit. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris where are you?\u201d her voice was frantic. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way home. \nI\u2019ll be there in about five minutes. \nWhy? \u00a0What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>She took a ragged breath before answering. \u00a0\u201cErica called Sebastian. \u00a0Sounds like she\u2019s drunk and she\u2019s in the tub\nand she keeps saying she wants it all to end.\u201d</p><p>Chris\u2019 mind went into overdrive; his eyes growing wide as he\nstepped his foot harder on the gas. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI called the police to get to your house before I called\nyou. \u00a0I don\u2019t know if they will be there\nbefore you or not. \u00a0Chris-it doesn\u2019t\nsound good.\u201d \u00a0Margarita began to cry, not\nwanting to lose her best friend. \u00a0</p><p>Fear seeped through Chris\u2019 bones as he swerved in and out of\nthe lanes, not caring how many traffic laws he was breaking. \u00a0He needed to get to you before you did\nanything more reckless than you already had. \n</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost there Margie,\u201d Chris responded. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh god.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? \u00a0What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2026she just told Sebastian to tell you that she loved you\nbefore the line went dead.\u201d</p><p>~~~</p><p>Picking up the straight razor, you gripped it in your\ntrembling hands. \u00a0The water was becoming\ncolder, your body shivering. \u00a0You faintly\nheard a crashing sound downstairs, footsteps on the stairs as you placed the\nblade along your left wrist. \u00a0Tears stung\nyour eyes as you pressed the razor hard onto your skin and pulled down, right\nalong the vein. \u00a0Bright red blood immediately\nseeped from your delicate skin, dropping into the water as you continued to\npush down hard. \u00a0</p><p>The door to the bathroom swung open. \u00a0\u201cERICA NO!\u201d Chris yelled. \u00a0He was at your side in three quick strides,\nforcing the razor out of your hand. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cLET ME DO THIS!\u201d you screamed, thrashing around the pink\nstained tub. \u00a0Chris pulled you from the\ncold water and held a towel to your bleeding wrist. \u00a0You began to struggle in his grip, wanting to\ndie, to end this suffering life, but he wasn\u2019t budging. \u00a0\u201cLET ME GO! \nJUST LET ME DIE!!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that Erica,\u201d Chris cried quietly as he held you\nclose to him; your body trembling. \u00a0Your\nlips began to turn blue; your breathing ragged. \nChris looked down and saw that the towel was doing nothing to stop the\nbleeding from your wrist. \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t do this\nto me-please,\u201d Chris pleaded; his own tears flowing from his eyes at the\nthought of losing you. \u00a0\u201cStay with me\nErica. \u00a0Please stay with me baby. \u00a0I can\u2019t-I can\u2019t lose you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPOLICE! \u00a0WHERE ARE\nYOU AT?\u201d Chris heard the police officers yell from downstairs. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cUPSTAIRS MASTER BATHROOM. \nHURRY!\u201d came Chris\u2019 plea of demand. \n\u201cJust hold on baby. \u00a0Hold on for\nme please.\u201d \u00a0Your body went limp in his\narms as everything faded to black. \u00a0</p><p>~~~</p><p><b>One Month Later</b></p><p>\u201cYour heart stopped Erica. \nDo you think you\u2019re ready to go back to everything?\u201d \u00a0Dr. Lee asked as she sat across from you in\nthe large office. \u00a0</p><p>Looking around the room, you took your time to reflect on\nthe last four weeks you spent here. \u00a0It\nwas an inpatient mental health facility near Los Angeles. \u00a0Being here, away from everything and with the\nhelp of staff and nurses at all times, you really came around with their\nhelp. \u00a0Dr. Lee was right; your heart did\nstop the night you tried to take your life. \nAnd now that you look back on that night, you couldn\u2019t believe you did\nthat to Chris; to everybody who loved you. \n</p><p>During your stay at the facility, they managed to quickly\nget you on an appropriate dosing of medications that not only made you stop\nfeeling like a zombie, but made you feel better all around. \u00a0For the first time since you regained your\nmemories, you were happy. \u00a0</p><p>Giving Dr. Lee a smile, you nodded your head. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve never been more ready.\u201d</p><p>After your last session with Dr. Lee, you walked down the\nhalls of the treatment facility for the last time and into your room. \u00a0Standing there surprising you was Chris. \u00a0He was holding a bouquet of flowers; a bright\nsmile on his face. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cCongratulations beautiful,\u201d he beamed. \u00a0You ran to him, jumping into his open arms as\nyou wrapped your legs around his thighs. \nNuzzling your face into his neck, you reveled at his smell. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d you breathed into his neck before giving him\na chaste kiss on his pulse point. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI missed you too Erica. \nSo much-you have no idea.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I was stuck in here for your birthday,\u201d you\nfrowned at the thought. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey now. \u00a0My birthday\nmeans nothing to me if you aren\u2019t happy alright?\u201d \u00a0You gave him a nod into his neck. \u00a0\u201cAre you ready to go home?\u201d</p><p>Pulling away from him, you placed a tender kiss to his\nlips. \u00a0Chris pulled you closer to his\nfirm body with one arm, as his free hand threaded through your hair. \u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>The car ride back to the house was quiet, but not\nawkward. \u00a0Chris held your hand the entire\ntime as you let your head rest out of the window; missing the feeling of wind\non your face. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re ready for this babe?\u201d \u00a0Chris asked as he squeezed your hand.</p><p>\u201cLike I told Dr. Lee earlier, I\u2019ve never been more ready\nChris. \u00a0My medications are adjusted and\nwith all the extracurricular classes they let us choose from, I now have so\nmany hobbies that I enjoy and it also helps me ease my mind and be at\npeace. \u00a0I haven\u2019t felt this good-this\nhappy in months.\u201d</p><p>Chris smiled at your words, picking up your hand in his and\nkissing your knuckles. \u00a0\u201cBy the way. \u00a0Robert is throwing a big fourth of July\nbash. \u00a0I was wondering if you would be up\nto going to that?\u201d \u00a0The 4<sup>th</sup> of\nJuly was still two weeks away, giving you plenty of time to adjust to life\nagain. \u00a0Giving him a smile, you\nnodded. \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe neighbors must be throwing a party,\u201d you chuckled as\nyou saw all the cars lined in the neighborhood. \n</p><p>Chris helped with your bags out of the car and held onto\nyour hand tightly as you walked through the door from the garage. \u00a0Dodger came running up to you, jumping onto\nyour laugh. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDodger!!! \u00a0Oh boy I\nmissed you so much! \u00a0Yes, who\u2019s a good\nboy? \u00a0Ooohhh,\u201d you cooed as you let him\nslobber kisses all over your face. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOk bubba that\u2019s enough. \nOff my girl,\u201d Chris chuckled as he helped you back to your feet. \u00a0</p><p>The two of you turned the corner of the kitchen and you were\nfrozen in place at the sight in front of you. \n</p><p>\u201cWelcome back Erica!\u201d everyone cheered and clapped for\nyou. \u00a0</p><p>Standing in front of you was Sebastian and Margarita, along\nwith Chris\u2019 mom, Shana, Carly and Scott. \nImmediately you burst into tears at the sight of all your loved ones.</p><p>Everyone took their turns hugging you and you felt so much\nlove and warmth spread through you. \u00a0If\nyou had any doubts before about being able to get through things, this moment\ntook those doubts away. \u00a0</p><p>Turns out Chris had been planning this since his birthday\nbecause he knew how sad you were that you couldn\u2019t be with him for it. \u00a0There was a strict rule about no visitors at\nthe treatment facility if you were only doing a four week program. \u00a0But you were at least still able to talk to\nhim each and every day on the phone which made it a little better. \u00a0</p><p>Lisa and Chris\u2019 sister made quick work of bringing all the\nfood out from their hiding place in the pantry. \nThe food smelled amazing and your mouth was watering at finally being\nable to have a good home cooked meal again. \n</p><p>After dinner was eaten, everyone moved to the backyard and\nenjoyed the last few hours before the sun dipped below the horizon. \u00a0It was without a doubt an absolute perfect\nday so far. \u00a0</p><p>You saw Chris motion to his mother and she disappeared into\nthe house. \u00a0A curious expression was on\nyour face as you talked to Margie, but you let it go. \u00a0</p><p>A few minutes later, there were flutes of champagne being\nbrought around. \u00a0Graciously, you took one\nin your hand. \u00a0The new medications they\nput you on wouldn\u2019t do any damage if you drank on them; as long as you drank occasionally\nand not on a daily basis. </p><p>Taking a sip, you crinkled your nose as the bubbles\ntickled. \u00a0Your brows furrowed as Chris\ntook your glass and set it down on the small table next to you; along with his glass. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cErica, do you remember the fight we had the day of your\naccident?\u201d \u00a0It wasn\u2019t hard to remember\nyour memories anymore as the scene flooded into your mind. \u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cFor the hundredth time,\nI am NOT cheating on you Erica!\u201d Chris roared, throwing his hands up in the air\nas his frustration and anger glowed on his face. \u00a0</i></p><p><i>This is the same fight\nthe two of you have been having all month and it was starting to take its toll\non you. \u00a0Each day, he spent less and less\ntime with you and instead headed out with friends;

Chris standing next to you with his arm around your back, holding you close\nto him in encouragement. \u00a0You tried to be\nstrong but you couldn\u2019t help the quivering of your chin. \u00a0Taking a deep breath, you spoke. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t have anyone to walk me down the\naisle. \u00a0And you both mean the absolute\nworld to me. \u00a0I was hoping the two of you\nwould do the honors?\u201d</p><p>They both had glossy eyes, trying to hold back their own\ntears as they both reached for you in a tight hug. \u00a0You felt comforted and cherished in their\narms. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI would be honored,\u201d Robert responded. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you would ask me that,\u201d Sebastian\nreplied. \u00a0 </p><p>After the three of you hugged it out and had your tearful\nmoment, Chris placed his hand around your shoulders and you made your way into\nthe festivities. \u00a0</p><p>Robert pulled out all the stops. \u00a0There was a large slip \u2018n\u2019 slide down the\nhill, a red, white and blue bouncy castle and the largest spread of catered\nbarbeque you had ever witnessed in your life. \n</p><p>You and Chris got congratulations throughout the rest of the\nafternoon and well into the evening as you mingled with everyone. \u00a0Scarlet pulled you aside for girl talk with\nMargie as they wanted details about the wedding. \u00a0Naturally, you asked them to be your\nbridesmaids during the conversation. \nThey both squealed in delight, going over ideas for you for the\nwedding. \u00a0At least you would have a lot\nof help planning the wedding. \u00a0</p><p>As dusk began to fall, Chris pulled you into his arms on a\nblanket on the ground. \u00a0Your back was\nsettled against his chest as he held you close to him; the two of you looking\nup to the sky as the fireworks show started. </p><p>Chris brushed your hair away from your ear and you felt his\nbreath on your delicate skin, making you shiver under his touch. \u00a0\u201cI love you so much Erica,\u201d he breathed into\nyour ear. \u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t wait until I get to\ncall you my wife.\u201d</p><p>~~~</p><p><b>One Year Later</b></p><p>After months of planning for the biggest day of your life,\nit was finally hear. \u00a0You had a crew of\npeople helping you get ready for your marriage with Chris and your heart was\nfluttering with excitement and nerves. \u00a0</p><p>The wedding was taking place in Northern California at a\nwinery. \u00a0The moment you and Chris visited\nlast fall to check out the venue, you fell in love with it just as much as he\ndid. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t going to be that large of\na wedding, only about 150 people total, which when you think of it, with Chris\nbeing a famous actor, it could have been much more. \u00a0While you had no family here, you knew\neveryone that was going to be in attendance and they all opened their arms to\nyou as part of the family. \u00a0</p><p>After you hair and makeup were done, you got into your\ndress. \u00a0Everyone filed out of the room,\ngiving you a minute to yourself before you heard a knock on the door. \u00a0Lisa popped her head in and stared at you in\nawe. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou look so beautiful sweetheart,\u201d she said as she removed\na tear that slid down her cheek. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh Lisa don\u2019t cry!\u201d you said with a smile as you went to\nhug her. \u00a0She held you close to her, and\njust like in Chris\u2019 arms, you felt warmth and love from her. \u00a0She considered you a daughter the moment she\nmet you; always telling you that you and Chris were destined to be\ntogether. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know that this must be a difficult time for you\nErica. \u00a0A big day like this and you don\u2019t\nhave the most important woman here with you right now.\u201d \u00a0As she spoke, you nodded your head, willing\nthe tears to not ruin your makeup. \u00a0\u201cAnd\nI just wanted you to know that I love you just as much as I love my own\nchildren. \u00a0You make my Chris so happy and\nI\u2019m so blessed that you are going to be a part of this family forever.\u201d \u00a0You wrapped your arms around her, clinging\nfor life as her words touched your heart. \nWhen she pulled away from you, she grabbed something from her\npurse. \u00a0\u201cI wanted to give you this so you\ncould wear it. \u00a0I had it made special for\ntoday.\u201d</p><p>She placed a small white box in your palms and you carefully\nopened it. \u00a0When you saw what it was, you\ngasped; Lisa immediately balling up tissues under your eyes to catch your\ntears. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful,\u201d you whispered. \u00a0It was a button about the size of a quarter,\nwith your mother\u2019s picture on it. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI was thinking we could pin it to the inside of your dress,\nright next to your heart. \u00a0That way she\nwill be nice and close to you today.\u201d \nNodding your head, you held the tissues up to your eyes as she carefully\npinned the button to the inside of your dress. \nYou don\u2019t know why, but you instantly felt better, like a weight lifted\noff your shoulder. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThey are ready,\u201d Scarlet said from the doorway, standing\nwith Margarita by her side. \u00a0\u201cDo you want\nme to bring in Robert and Sebastian?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Lisa quickly helped to make sure your makeup wasn\u2019t ruined\nand gave your arms a gentle squeeze. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, bring them in,\u201d you spoke softly. \u00a0You looked down at your dress, smiling. \u00a0The dress itself was extremely simple. \u00a0It was white satin with thick straps like a\ntank top. \u00a0At the waist, there was a\nbeaded diamond belt cinching your waist and then it flared out lightly from\nthere; nowhere near a ball gown flare. \nYou tried those types of dresses on and weren\u2019t comfortable at all in\nthem; they were so heavy to move around in. \n</p><p>There was a nother knock on\nthe door and you looked up to see Robert and Sebastian looking rather dapper in\ntheir navy blue tuxes. \u00a0Their eyes were\nglossy as they took everything in. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not crying, you\u2019re\ncrying,\u201d he turned and spoke to Sebastian as he sniffled his nose. \u00a0His remark caused you to giggle and you did a\ntwirl for them. \u00a0Robert was the frist to\ngreet you, taking your hands in his. \u00a0\u201cYou\nmake an absolutley stunning bride Erica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you Robert. \u00a0You don\u2019t look too shabby yourself.\u201d \u00a0He laughed before giving you a kiss on the\ncheek. \u00a0</p><p>Sebastian was next to greet\nyou and he didn\u2019t waste any time putting his arms around your waist and giving\nyou a hug. \u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t get over how\nbeautiful you look right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey now, I\u2019ll only be second\nbest when it finally comes to your ass marrying Margarita.\u201d \u00a0That got a laugh out of both men in the room. \u00a0\u201cAnd the best part?\u201d you spoke with a\ngleaming smile. \u00a0You placed your hands\ninside the pockets. \u00a0\u201cIt has POCKETS!\u201d</p><p>The music began to start and\nRobert handed you your boquet of flowers. \nTrailing behind them, you made your way outside the double doors. \u00a0Robert and Sebastian stood on either side of\nyou, both giving you warm smiles as you placed one arm around each of\nthem. \u00a0The three of you walked down the\ncobble sidewalk before stopping. \u00a0All you\nhad to do was turn left around the building and there Chris would be, waiting\nfor you. \u00a0</p><p>Looking up at the sky, it was\nthe perfect day for an outside wedding. \u00a0\u201cReady?\u201d\nRobert whispered to you. \u00a0Giving him a\nnod, the three of you turned the corner as everyone stood up. \u00a0</p><p>Your eyes instantly landed on\nChris. \u00a0He had never looked more handsome\nthan in this exact moment. \u00a0Slowly, the\nthree of you made your way up the aisle; your eyes never leaving Chris\u2019. \u00a0His mouth parted slightly as he got a better\nlook at you, and then you saw him wipe away a tear. \u00a0Your heart hammered in your chest, just\nwanting to be there next to him. \u00a0</p><p>Chris walked down the two\nsteps to greet you, taking your hand in his and helped you up the steps. \u00a0\u201cYou look so beautiful Erica,\u201d he whispered\nto you, making you blush. \u00a0</p><p>During the wedding, your eyes\nand Chris\u2019 stayed glued to each-other\u2019s. \nYou felt safe with your hands in his; heart full of love. \u00a0</p><p>It was time for your vows,\nand you both decided to speak from the heart instead of the basic vows that\nmany people do at weddings. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cErica, from the moment I\nmeant you, I knew you were special, even though you weren\u2019t mine-yet.\u201d \u00a0There was a chorus of giggles from the\naudience as your eyes peered over at Sebastian\u2019s. \u00a0He was smiling and shaking his head. \u00a0\u201cThroughout the time I got to know you, you\nbecame such a close friend to me and I knew one way or another, you would\nalways be a part of my life and I was happy with that. \u00a0But then one horrific accident happened and\nsomehow you ended up with me. \u00a0And then\nanother accident happened earlier this year and I thought I was going to lose\nyou. \u00a0I thought you would wake up one day\nand think \u2018what the hell am I doing with this doofus\u2019\u201d. \u00a0Another chorus of laughter erupted. \u00a0\u201cBut here you are, still with me. \u00a0And when you agreed to marry me, it was the\nhappiest moment of my life, until now. \u00a0I\nlove you so much Erica and I can\u2019t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.\u201d</p><p>You grabbed the tissue you\nhad been holding, knowing you would need it as you wiped away the tears from\nyour cheeks; not even caring anymore if your makeup was ruined. \u00a0Chris\u2019 words made you heart clench with love\nand all you wanted to do was pull him into a searing kiss, but you knew you had\nto wait. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cChris,\u201d you began to speak\nwith a shaky voice. \u00a0\u201cFate has a funny\nway of playing things out. \u00a0Over the\ncourse of the last few years, I didn\u2019t imagine how this would be endgame.\u201d \u00a0Naturally, those who were there that were a\npart of the Avengers movies snickered at your little comment. \u00a0\u201cBut I couldn\u2019t be more happier. \u00a0You have fought for me, time and time again\nduring the hardest parts of our relationship. \nIn fact, you had to do it twice. \nAnd that shows me how much dedication you have between us. \u00a0It shows that you are someone I can lean on\nand trust with my whole heart, knowing you would do anything for me. \u00a0I am proud to stand next to you today, and to\nbecome your wife.\u201d</p><p>Dodger came up to Chris, his\ncolor holding the boxes with your wedding bands in them. \u00a0The rings were placed on your respected\nfingers; smiles all around. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou may now kiss the bride,\u201d\nthe officiant stated. \u00a0</p><p>Chris\u2019 large warm hands\ncupped your cheeks, pulling you to him as he placed his lips on yours. \u00a0Your knees grew weak as you held onto his\narms, never wanting the kiss to end. \nChris pulled away, glancing lovingly into your eyes. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cEveryone, please\ncongratulate Mr. and Mrs. Chris Evans!\u201d the officiant said. \u00a0Margarita handed you your flowers and you\ngripped Chris\u2019 hand as the two of you walked down the aisle together as a\nmarried couple. \u00a0 </p><p style=\"\">Tag List:\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-vGAp5DFUjh-DJa10UdTfA\">@iamthemaskhewears</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-7P3-Sw9RWpGbn5Hx4MI5Q\">@janeyboo</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEFp2lYEPZfxUNkza9hN0Eg\">@trees-and-ink</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJzc50uJqSdLUFXRqSsJB-w\">@nina-bok</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfOj3-VofGUNqc0Iq304JQg\">@geektastic84</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miCK4X7M_2IwmUOnWC6AgXw\">@sarahp879</a> @our-daily-struggle <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXVZGDoySbGQ8Vh_yGF0EcQ\">@nomadicpixel</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMSzB-aY4LfrOBw8cJbeg0g\">@trishevans</a> @be-amazing <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLlHP8S74U3XruLxmsh6tBQ\">@wipplog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muhbhDwz85jaQCL2vvjSymw\">@ashann7</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6vBdmdRGtZWn7vJIREsBOw\">@have-aheart</a>@agambleaway <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPOeZGo5lyCuxR2g6yDdf9Q\">@lizzyclifford13-blog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVwtmzLzpnPVt4qXt9asVOQ\">@lovingquotes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9nHaXHEK2rAR_IE_wt-3Yg\">@titty-teetee</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBb4kX5ZjREpJq2bNqumg4g\">@ajosieface</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7mk2fSXnX5BBSZUlB54H1w\">@ffcsave</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2sGOmRlq8MwFleb1fFMs7Q\">@dottirose</a> @things-i-like-1982 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVHhgkZlxfFmUXjFdQBGwKg\">@sirod-30</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myIG1dSI2kcFSS0i64oU60Q\">@skyewardolicitycloisdelena91</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx92Ca0bmTX9IHcJIKCwOQ\">@patzammit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maRk-wkBYlRixBAo8hWCkjg\">@brastrangled</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGv8r6fJX_2qORMc07jo2VQ\">@miss-cap21</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-B6U87jynWLd9naB5G_dEw\">@pumbibaby</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwBVtWXJkPYvhG69w0u49VQ\">@marvelouslyme96</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcRxn7YLseanjYhB44PCesg\">@kanupps06</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moH2485CD_OzLSWhAudQMjA\">@the-real-kellymonster</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYVvyPBlJuKY24WaTnPPnhQ\">@zohoffman</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPJVwxDeaQzxOgOZH4jTZ3w\">@princess-evans-addict</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLEN1bSPv7F2jO2qK-XqfvQ\">@white-chocolate-mocha-fan</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUq3sPk9lcgG_jXUp6RsRIQ\">@remember-that-one-blog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9gP0gKLqbIcrjDz0T37bBg\">@sincerelyfan</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0E2wFcz7-jjpygcaO4nuSw\">@projectxhappiness</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhvcg66HgRTM7-gI4qWvFvQ\">@libbitinasdeath</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfGDFCWQwdHP6h2bfQLKLqA\">@hispeculiartreasure</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mc2Kb_Y38BjoHk-FIWY7Rlg\">@guera31</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtaWaN_ighiYYScW7vLIC9w\">@ssweet-empowerment</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvRHJPQOLxmyZlKUa6rlO2A\">@sfreeborn</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpmGAEwKsOKtyIgI-c5Ttqg\">@jjlevin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq3cy1j5dCpdq9OpT4x3Ukw\">@badassbaker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5QSam4Ife2TKINrNYibWHA\">@sophiealiice</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEhQ4uSLqpJMdVWi_i75QzA\">@supernatural-girl97</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbMjLzeZOiw097UfkLMIxIw\">@coffeebooksandfandom</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmToUcLU1n388gzQ38anXog\">@esoltis280</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXFYeI57g9SMd7qt-SB_oAg\">@poerebel</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mifWDZ6NIu_ob1sV8Fw0dWQ\">@laochbaineann</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvoHONrlb9zzqCPyqVY9YZA\">@crushed-pink-petals</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbzINLfv17mQRDzuIowmuaA\">@thisismysecrethappyplace</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfBS0BI2T_apEQcN2Elg4vg\">@mrs-captain-evans</a></p>",

your screams waking up not only you and Chris, but\nDodger as he fled from the room each night. \nYour voice was hoarse, throat soar from the screams. \u00a0</p><p>You didn\u2019t want to forget what happened with your mother,\nyou just wanted to be able to sleep without being plagued with those memories\neach time you closed your eyes. \u00a0</p><p>As much as he didn\u2019t want to leave you for too long, he had\nno choice as it pertained to a business meeting for an upcoming film he had\nbeen dreaming about directing. \u00a0You\nassured him time and time again that you would be fine for the day by yourself. \u00a0It was a Saturday morning that he left, and\nwouldn\u2019t be home until late afternoon or even early evening. \u00a0</p><p>By 10 a.m that morning, you gave up on trying to get any\nsleep and instead went to sit on the couch in the living room. \u00a0You were exhausted from all the therapy\nappointments and getting maybe two hours of sleep a night; it was draining on\nyour mind and body. \u00a0The medications they\nalso gave you were making you feel somewhat of a zombie, but you knew it would\ntake weeks to get the right doses for you and for you to start feeling yourself\nagain. \u00a0</p><p>Spending the day staring blankly at the television, not even\nbothering to pay attention to what was on the screen is what you had done. \u00a0You felt numb and broken all over again; the\nmemories invading your mind like a plague, never letting you forget. \u00a0You just wanted a little piece of quiet; it\nwas all you asked for but never received. \nGuilt rippled through you and you didn\u2019t think you could handle any\nmore.</p><p>You remembered how this had already happened to you; how you\nalready overcame this struggle once in your lifetime. \u00a0It never occurred to you how hard it could be\nto go through the same exact thing a second time. \u00a0Your heart was heavy just thinking about it\nand it broke you. \u00a0You didn\u2019t want\nthis. \u00a0You just wanted it to end; to stop\nthe misery. \u00a0</p><p>Checking your phone, you saw there were missed texts from\nChris. \u00a0</p><p><b>3 P.M</b></p><p><b>Chris: Hey\nsweetheart, just checking in with you. \u00a0I\nmiss you. \u00a0</b></p><p><b>4:30 P.M</b></p><p><b>Chris: I love you\nErica</b></p><p><b>5:15 P.M</b></p><p><b>Chris: The meeting is\ntaking longer than I thought. \u00a0I\u2019m so\nsorry sweetheart. \u00a0I\u2019ll call you as soon\nas I leave. \u00a0I can pick up some dinner if\nyou\u2019d like. \u00a0Let me know</b></p><p>More guilt seeped into your body and you were overcome with\ntears spilling from your cheek. \u00a0Dodger\nsat by your feet, whimpering at your sadness. \nChris didn\u2019t deserve the mess that you had become. \u00a0He deserved someone happy; someone he could\nshare his joy with. \u00a0Even though he said\nthere was nothing you could do for him to leave you, you just didn\u2019t think you\nwere strong enough to go through this a second time. \u00a0</p><p>You decided to give him a text, not wanting to worry him to\nthe point where he would leave his meeting early and ruin such a great\nopportunity. \u00a0</p><p><b>Erica: Just sitting\nhere with Dodger and watching some tv. \u00a0I\u2019ll\nsee you when you get home. \u00a0</b></p><p>Grabbing a bottle of vodka from the cabinet, you went into\nthe bedroom and pulled out a box of photos from a box hidden in the\ncloset. \u00a0It had been there since when you\nmoved in with Chris; but had been forgotten until your memories found their way\nto you again. \u00a0</p><p>Opening the bottle of vodka, you took a giant swig and\nplanted your ass on the floor. \u00a0Lifting\nthe lid off the box, you began to sift through the photos; your heart clenching\nwith each pass of your eyes over the glossy memories. \u00a0 Pictures of your mother and you; pictures of\nyou and Sebastian during happier times; and pictures of you and Chris. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cGaahhhh!\u201d you screamed, throwing the box against the wall\nas you began to chug more of the vodka. \nOne of the pictures landed face up, sitting just at your feet. \u00a0It was a picture of you and your mother; the\nlast picture that was ever taken of the two of you. \u00a0You were spending the weekend with her; it\nwas a mere few weeks before you found out you were pregnant. \u00a0\u201cWHY???\u201d your anguish scream ripped through\nyour throat as your tears cascaded down your face. \u00a0Tears mixed with the alcohol began to blur\nyour vision as you got up on shaky legs and made your way into the master\nbathroom. \u00a0</p><p>Looking at yourself in the mirror you could see a younger\nversion of your mother making everything hurt that much more. \u00a0Turning around you went to the large tub and\nturned the water on; not even bother if it was hot or cold. \u00a0Your cell phone began to ring and you saw it\nwas Chris; indicating he must finally be done with his meeting. \u00a0As your finger hovered over the green button\nto answer, you decided you couldn\u2019t talk to him. \u00a0Not like this. </p><p>Putting the phone down you opened the cabinet under the\nsink, finding what you were looking for. \nIt was in a black sleek case. \u00a0Chris\nhad received it as a gift from Scott for Christmas. \u00a0Opening it, you took out the straight razor\nthat was meant for trimming up his beard; just like they did at the barbers\nback in the day. \u00a0</p><p>Stopping the water, you grabbed your phone and the straight razor,\nsetting it on the stool next to the tub. \nTaking a few more large chugs of vodka, you submerged yourself into the\nbath, fully clothed as water splashed onto the tiled floor. \u00a0The water was slightly warm but your body\nfelt chilled thinking about what was to come. \n \u00a0</p><p>Taking a deep breath, you decided to call Sebastian before\nanything happened. \u00a0Pulling up his name,\nyou pressed send and began to hear the ringing. \nWithout eating all day and the copious amounts of alcohol in your\nsystem, you could barely keep yourself upright in the tub; your body constantly\nsliding down further into the deep tub. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey Erica,\u201d Sebastian\u2019s cheery voice greeted you, only\nmaking you cry harder. \u00a0\u201cHey hey hey\u2026what\u2019s\nwrong sweetie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026can\u2019t\u2026do\u2026.this\u2026anymore,\u201d you wailed between labored breaths. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cErica,\u201d Sebastian called your name, but you could barely\nhear him through your consistent crying. \n\u201cERICA,\u201d he yelled this time. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt hurts\u2026it hurts SO much Sebby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Chris Erica? \nTell me where he is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt\u2026at a meeting. \nDunno when he will he be\u2019re,\u201d your words slurred heavily. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHave you been drinking? \nErica you know you can\u2019t drink with the medications you are on. \u00a0Where are you right now?\u201d \u00a0Sebastian\u2019s voice was laced with worry. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIn tha tub. \u00a0Hard to\u2026.,\u201d\nyour words cut off as your head slipped the water. \u00a0As you emerged from the water you gasped for\nbreath. \u00a0Luckily your phone was\nwaterproof. </p><p>\u201cERICA!!! \nERICA!!! \u00a0ARE YOU ALRIGHT?,\u201d you\nheard Seb yelling. \u00a0</p><p>You coughed up water before replying. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m\u2026.i\u2019m just ready for it ta end. \u00a0End it all!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMargarita call police to Chris\u2019 house and then call him,\u201d Sebastian\nsaid to his girlfriend. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWill you do me a favor Sebby?\u201d your voice began to quiver\nat the thought of what was about to happen. \n\u201cWill you-will you tell Chris I love him?\u201d \u00a0You ended the call, throwing your phone onto\nthe floor as it shattered into pieces. \u00a0</p><p>~~~</p><p>Out of nowhere, Chris felt a sense of dread wash over his\nbody as he drove down the freeway, just wanting to get back to the house with\nyou. \u00a0His meeting went way too long and\nhe hadn\u2019t heard from you except for that one text. \u00a0His phone began to ring and he saw Margarita\u2019s\nname pop up. \u00a0Confused, he answered\nit. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris where are you?\u201d her voice was frantic. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way home. \nI\u2019ll be there in about five minutes. \nWhy? \u00a0What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>She took a ragged breath before answering. \u00a0\u201cErica called Sebastian. \u00a0Sounds like she\u2019s drunk and she\u2019s in the tub\nand she keeps saying she wants it all to end.\u201d</p><p>Chris\u2019 mind went into overdrive; his eyes growing wide as he\nstepped his foot harder on the gas. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI called the police to get to your house before I called\nyou. \u00a0I don\u2019t know if they will be there\nbefore you or not. \u00a0Chris-it doesn\u2019t\nsound good.\u201d \u00a0Margarita began to cry, not\nwanting to lose her best friend. \u00a0</p><p>Fear seeped through Chris\u2019 bones as he swerved in and out of\nthe lanes, not caring how many traffic laws he was breaking. \u00a0He needed to get to you before you did\nanything more reckless than you already had. \n</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost there Margie,\u201d Chris responded. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh god.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? \u00a0What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2026she just told Sebastian to tell you that she loved you\nbefore the line went dead.\u201d</p><p>~~~</p><p>Picking up the straight razor, you gripped it in your\ntrembling hands. \u00a0The water was becoming\ncolder, your body shivering. \u00a0You faintly\nheard a crashing sound downstairs, footsteps on the stairs as you placed the\nblade along your left wrist. \u00a0Tears stung\nyour eyes as you pressed the razor hard onto your skin and pulled down, right\nalong the vein. \u00a0Bright red blood immediately\nseeped from your delicate skin, dropping into the water as you continued to\npush down hard. \u00a0</p><p>The door to the bathroom swung open. \u00a0\u201cERICA NO!\u201d Chris yelled. \u00a0He was at your side in three quick strides,\nforcing the razor out of your hand. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cLET ME DO THIS!\u201d you screamed, thrashing around the pink\nstained tub. \u00a0Chris pulled you from the\ncold water and held a towel to your bleeding wrist. \u00a0You began to struggle in his grip, wanting to\ndie, to end this suffering life, but he wasn\u2019t budging. \u00a0\u201cLET ME GO! \nJUST LET ME DIE!!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that Erica,\u201d Chris cried quietly as he held you\nclose to him; your body trembling. \u00a0Your\nlips began to turn blue; your breathing ragged. \nChris looked down and saw that the towel was doing nothing to stop the\nbleeding from your wrist. \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t do this\nto me-please,\u201d Chris pleaded; his own tears flowing from his eyes at the\nthought of losing you. \u00a0\u201cStay with me\nErica. \u00a0Please stay with me baby. \u00a0I can\u2019t-I can\u2019t lose you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPOLICE! \u00a0WHERE ARE\nYOU AT?\u201d Chris heard the police officers yell from downstairs. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cUPSTAIRS MASTER BATHROOM. \nHURRY!\u201d came Chris\u2019 plea of demand. \n\u201cJust hold on baby. \u00a0Hold on for\nme please.\u201d \u00a0Your body went limp in his\narms as everything faded to black. \u00a0</p><p>~~~</p><p><b>One Month Later</b></p><p>\u201cYour heart stopped Erica. \nDo you think you\u2019re ready to go back to everything?\u201d \u00a0Dr. Lee asked as she sat across from you in\nthe large office. \u00a0</p><p>Looking around the room, you took your time to reflect on\nthe last four weeks you spent here. \u00a0It\nwas an inpatient mental health facility near Los Angeles. \u00a0Being here, away from everything and with the\nhelp of staff and nurses at all times, you really came around with their\nhelp. \u00a0Dr. Lee was right; your heart did\nstop the night you tried to take your life. \nAnd now that you look back on that night, you couldn\u2019t believe you did\nthat to Chris; to everybody who loved you. \n</p><p>During your stay at the facility, they managed to quickly\nget you on an appropriate dosing of medications that not only made you stop\nfeeling like a zombie, but made you feel better all around. \u00a0For the first time since you regained your\nmemories, you were happy. \u00a0</p><p>Giving Dr. Lee a smile, you nodded your head. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve never been more ready.\u201d</p><p>After your last session with Dr. Lee, you walked down the\nhalls of the treatment facility for the last time and into your room. \u00a0Standing there surprising you was Chris. \u00a0He was holding a bouquet of flowers; a bright\nsmile on his face. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cCongratulations beautiful,\u201d he beamed. \u00a0You ran to him, jumping into his open arms as\nyou wrapped your legs around his thighs. \nNuzzling your face into his neck, you reveled at his smell. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d you breathed into his neck before giving him\na chaste kiss on his pulse point. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI missed you too Erica. \nSo much-you have no idea.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I was stuck in here for your birthday,\u201d you\nfrowned at the thought. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey now. \u00a0My birthday\nmeans nothing to me if you aren\u2019t happy alright?\u201d \u00a0You gave him a nod into his neck. \u00a0\u201cAre you ready to go home?\u201d</p><p>Pulling away from him, you placed a tender kiss to his\nlips. \u00a0Chris pulled you closer to his\nfirm body with one arm, as his free hand threaded through your hair. \u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>The car ride back to the house was quiet, but not\nawkward. \u00a0Chris held your hand the entire\ntime as you let your head rest out of the window; missing the feeling of wind\non your face. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re ready for this babe?\u201d \u00a0Chris asked as he squeezed your hand.</p><p>\u201cLike I told Dr. Lee earlier, I\u2019ve never been more ready\nChris. \u00a0My medications are adjusted and\nwith all the extracurricular classes they let us choose from, I now have so\nmany hobbies that I enjoy and it also helps me ease my mind and be at\npeace. \u00a0I haven\u2019t felt this good-this\nhappy in months.\u201d</p><p>Chris smiled at your words, picking up your hand in his and\nkissing your knuckles. \u00a0\u201cBy the way. \u00a0Robert is throwing a big fourth of July\nbash. \u00a0I was wondering if you would be up\nto going to that?\u201d \u00a0The 4<sup>th</sup> of\nJuly was still two weeks away, giving you plenty of time to adjust to life\nagain. \u00a0Giving him a smile, you\nnodded. \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe neighbors must be throwing a party,\u201d you chuckled as\nyou saw all the cars lined in the neighborhood. \n</p><p>Chris helped with your bags out of the car and held onto\nyour hand tightly as you walked through the door from the garage. \u00a0Dodger came running up to you, jumping onto\nyour laugh. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDodger!!! \u00a0Oh boy I\nmissed you so much! \u00a0Yes, who\u2019s a good\nboy? \u00a0Ooohhh,\u201d you cooed as you let him\nslobber kisses all over your face. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOk bubba that\u2019s enough. \nOff my girl,\u201d Chris chuckled as he helped you back to your feet. \u00a0</p><p>The two of you turned the corner of the kitchen and you were\nfrozen in place at the sight in front of you. \n</p><p>\u201cWelcome back Erica!\u201d everyone cheered and clapped for\nyou. \u00a0</p><p>Standing in front of you was Sebastian and Margarita, along\nwith Chris\u2019 mom, Shana, Carly and Scott. \nImmediately you burst into tears at the sight of all your loved ones.</p><p>Everyone took their turns hugging you and you felt so much\nlove and warmth spread through you. \u00a0If\nyou had any doubts before about being able to get through things, this moment\ntook those doubts away. \u00a0</p><p>Turns out Chris had been planning this since his birthday\nbecause he knew how sad you were that you couldn\u2019t be with him for it. \u00a0There was a strict rule about no visitors at\nthe treatment facility if you were only doing a four week program. \u00a0But you were at least still able to talk to\nhim each and every day on the phone which made it a little better. \u00a0</p><p>Lisa and Chris\u2019 sister made quick work of bringing all the\nfood out from their hiding place in the pantry. \nThe food smelled amazing and your mouth was watering at finally being\nable to have a good home cooked meal again. \n</p><p>After dinner was eaten, everyone moved to the backyard and\nenjoyed the last few hours before the sun dipped below the horizon. \u00a0It was without a doubt an absolute perfect\nday so far. \u00a0</p><p>You saw Chris motion to his mother and she disappeared into\nthe house. \u00a0A curious expression was on\nyour face as you talked to Margie, but you let it go. \u00a0</p><p>A few minutes later, there were flutes of champagne being\nbrought around. \u00a0Graciously, you took one\nin your hand. \u00a0The new medications they\nput you on wouldn\u2019t do any damage if you drank on them; as long as you drank occasionally\nand not on a daily basis. </p><p>Taking a sip, you crinkled your nose as the bubbles\ntickled. \u00a0Your brows furrowed as Chris\ntook your glass and set it down on the small table next to you; along with his glass. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cErica, do you remember the fight we had the day of your\naccident?\u201d \u00a0It wasn\u2019t hard to remember\nyour memories anymore as the scene flooded into your mind. \u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cFor the hundredth time,\nI am NOT cheating on you Erica!\u201d Chris roared, throwing his hands up in the air\nas his frustration and anger glowed on his face. \u00a0</i></p><p><i>This is the same fight\nthe two of you have been having all month and it was starting to take its toll\non you. \u00a0Each day, he spent less and less\ntime with you and instead headed out with friends;

Lisa immediately balling up tissues under your eyes to catch your\ntears. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful,\u201d you whispered. \u00a0It was a button about the size of a quarter,\nwith your mother\u2019s picture on it. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI was thinking we could pin it to the inside of your dress,\nright next to your heart. \u00a0That way she\nwill be nice and close to you today.\u201d \nNodding your head, you held the tissues up to your eyes as she carefully\npinned the button to the inside of your dress. \nYou don\u2019t know why, but you instantly felt better, like a weight lifted\noff your shoulder. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThey are ready,\u201d Scarlet said from the doorway, standing\nwith Margarita by her side. \u00a0\u201cDo you want\nme to bring in Robert and Sebastian?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Lisa quickly helped to make sure your makeup wasn\u2019t ruined\nand gave your arms a gentle squeeze. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, bring them in,\u201d you spoke softly. \u00a0You looked down at your dress, smiling. \u00a0The dress itself was extremely simple. \u00a0It was white satin with thick straps like a\ntank top. \u00a0At the waist, there was a\nbeaded diamond belt cinching your waist and then it flared out lightly from\nthere; nowhere near a ball gown flare. \nYou tried those types of dresses on and weren\u2019t comfortable at all in\nthem; they were so heavy to move around in. \n</p><p>There was a nother knock on\nthe door and you looked up to see Robert and Sebastian looking rather dapper in\ntheir navy blue tuxes. \u00a0Their eyes were\nglossy as they took everything in. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not crying, you\u2019re\ncrying,\u201d he turned and spoke to Sebastian as he sniffled his nose. \u00a0His remark caused you to giggle and you did a\ntwirl for them. \u00a0Robert was the frist to\ngreet you, taking your hands in his. \u00a0\u201cYou\nmake an absolutley stunning bride Erica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you Robert. \u00a0You don\u2019t look too shabby yourself.\u201d \u00a0He laughed before giving you a kiss on the\ncheek. \u00a0</p><p>Sebastian was next to greet\nyou and he didn\u2019t waste any time putting his arms around your waist and giving\nyou a hug. \u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t get over how\nbeautiful you look right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey now, I\u2019ll only be second\nbest when it finally comes to your ass marrying Margarita.\u201d \u00a0That got a laugh out of both men in the room. \u00a0\u201cAnd the best part?\u201d you spoke with a\ngleaming smile. \u00a0You placed your hands\ninside the pockets. \u00a0\u201cIt has POCKETS!\u201d</p><p>The music began to start and\nRobert handed you your boquet of flowers. \nTrailing behind them, you made your way outside the double doors. \u00a0Robert and Sebastian stood on either side of\nyou, both giving you warm smiles as you placed one arm around each of\nthem. \u00a0The three of you walked down the\ncobble sidewalk before stopping. \u00a0All you\nhad to do was turn left around the building and there Chris would be, waiting\nfor you. \u00a0</p><p>Looking up at the sky, it was\nthe perfect day for an outside wedding. \u00a0\u201cReady?\u201d\nRobert whispered to you. \u00a0Giving him a\nnod, the three of you turned the corner as everyone stood up. \u00a0</p><p>Your eyes instantly landed on\nChris. \u00a0He had never looked more handsome\nthan in this exact moment. \u00a0Slowly, the\nthree of you made your way up the aisle; your eyes never leaving Chris\u2019. \u00a0His mouth parted slightly as he got a better\nlook at you, and then you saw him wipe away a tear. \u00a0Your heart hammered in your chest, just\nwanting to be there next to him. \u00a0</p><p>Chris walked down the two\nsteps to greet you, taking your hand in his and helped you up the steps. \u00a0\u201cYou look so beautiful Erica,\u201d he whispered\nto you, making you blush. \u00a0</p><p>During the wedding, your eyes\nand Chris\u2019 stayed glued to each-other\u2019s. \nYou felt safe with your hands in his; heart full of love. \u00a0</p><p>It was time for your vows,\nand you both decided to speak from the heart instead of the basic vows that\nmany people do at weddings. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cErica, from the moment I\nmeant you, I knew you were special, even though you weren\u2019t mine-yet.\u201d \u00a0There was a chorus of giggles from the\naudience as your eyes peered over at Sebastian\u2019s. \u00a0He was smiling and shaking his head. \u00a0\u201cThroughout the time I got to know you, you\nbecame such a close friend to me and I knew one way or another, you would\nalways be a part of my life and I was happy with that. \u00a0But then one horrific accident happened and\nsomehow you ended up with me. \u00a0And then\nanother accident happened earlier this year and I thought I was going to lose\nyou. \u00a0I thought you would wake up one day\nand think \u2018what the hell am I doing with this doofus\u2019\u201d. \u00a0Another chorus of laughter erupted. \u00a0\u201cBut here you are, still with me. \u00a0And when you agreed to marry me, it was the\nhappiest moment of my life, until now. \u00a0I\nlove you so much Erica and I can\u2019t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.\u201d</p><p>You grabbed the tissue you\nhad been holding, knowing you would need it as you wiped away the tears from\nyour cheeks; not even caring anymore if your makeup was ruined. \u00a0Chris\u2019 words made you heart clench with love\nand all you wanted to do was pull him into a searing kiss, but you knew you had\nto wait. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cChris,\u201d you began to speak\nwith a shaky voice. \u00a0\u201cFate has a funny\nway of playing things out. \u00a0Over the\ncourse of the last few years, I didn\u2019t imagine how this would be endgame.\u201d \u00a0Naturally, those who were there that were a\npart of the Avengers movies snickered at your little comment. \u00a0\u201cBut I couldn\u2019t be more happier. \u00a0You have fought for me, time and time again\nduring the hardest parts of our relationship. \nIn fact, you had to do it twice. \nAnd that shows me how much dedication you have between us. \u00a0It shows that you are someone I can lean on\nand trust with my whole heart, knowing you would do anything for me. \u00a0I am proud to stand next to you today, and to\nbecome your wife.\u201d</p><p>Dodger came up to Chris, his\ncolor holding the boxes with your wedding bands in them. \u00a0The rings were placed on your respected\nfingers; smiles all around. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou may now kiss the bride,\u201d\nthe officiant stated. \u00a0</p><p>Chris\u2019 large warm hands\ncupped your cheeks, pulling you to him as he placed his lips on yours. \u00a0Your knees grew weak as you held onto his\narms, never wanting the kiss to end. \nChris pulled away, glancing lovingly into your eyes. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cEveryone, please\ncongratulate Mr. and Mrs. Chris Evans!\u201d the officiant said. \u00a0Margarita handed you your flowers and you\ngripped Chris\u2019 hand as the two of you walked down the aisle together as a\nmarried couple. \u00a0 </p><p style=\"\">Tag List:\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-vGAp5DFUjh-DJa10UdTfA\">@iamthemaskhewears</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-7P3-Sw9RWpGbn5Hx4MI5Q\">@janeyboo</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEFp2lYEPZfxUNkza9hN0Eg\">@trees-and-ink</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJzc50uJqSdLUFXRqSsJB-w\">@nina-bok</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfOj3-VofGUNqc0Iq304JQg\">@geektastic84</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miCK4X7M_2IwmUOnWC6AgXw\">@sarahp879</a> @our-daily-struggle <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXVZGDoySbGQ8Vh_yGF0EcQ\">@nomadicpixel</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMSzB-aY4LfrOBw8cJbeg0g\">@trishevans</a> @be-amazing <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLlHP8S74U3XruLxmsh6tBQ\">@wipplog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muhbhDwz85jaQCL2vvjSymw\">@ashann7</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6vBdmdRGtZWn7vJIREsBOw\">@have-aheart</a>@agambleaway <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPOeZGo5lyCuxR2g6yDdf9Q\">@lizzyclifford13-blog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVwtmzLzpnPVt4qXt9asVOQ\">@lovingquotes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9nHaXHEK2rAR_IE_wt-3Yg\">@titty-teetee</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBb4kX5ZjREpJq2bNqumg4g\">@ajosieface</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7mk2fSXnX5BBSZUlB54H1w\">@ffcsave</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2sGOmRlq8MwFleb1fFMs7Q\">@dottirose</a> @things-i-like-1982 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVHhgkZlxfFmUXjFdQBGwKg\">@sirod-30</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myIG1dSI2kcFSS0i64oU60Q\">@skyewardolicitycloisdelena91</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx92Ca0bmTX9IHcJIKCwOQ\">@patzammit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maRk-wkBYlRixBAo8hWCkjg\">@brastrangled</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGv8r6fJX_2qORMc07jo2VQ\">@miss-cap21</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-B6U87jynWLd9naB5G_dEw\">@pumbibaby</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwBVtWXJkPYvhG69w0u49VQ\">@marvelouslyme96</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcRxn7YLseanjYhB44PCesg\">@kanupps06</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moH2485CD_OzLSWhAudQMjA\">@the-real-kellymonster</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYVvyPBlJuKY24WaTnPPnhQ\">@zohoffman</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPJVwxDeaQzxOgOZH4jTZ3w\">@princess-evans-addict</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLEN1bSPv7F2jO2qK-XqfvQ\">@white-chocolate-mocha-fan</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUq3sPk9lcgG_jXUp6RsRIQ\">@remember-that-one-blog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9gP0gKLqbIcrjDz0T37bBg\">@sincerelyfan</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0E2wFcz7-jjpygcaO4nuSw\">@projectxhappiness</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhvcg66HgRTM7-gI4qWvFvQ\">@libbitinasdeath</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfGDFCWQwdHP6h2bfQLKLqA\">@hispeculiartreasure</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mc2Kb_Y38BjoHk-FIWY7Rlg\">@guera31</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtaWaN_ighiYYScW7vLIC9w\">@ssweet-empowerment</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvRHJPQOLxmyZlKUa6rlO2A\">@sfreeborn</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpmGAEwKsOKtyIgI-c5Ttqg\">@jjlevin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq3cy1j5dCpdq9OpT4x3Ukw\">@badassbaker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5QSam4Ife2TKINrNYibWHA\">@sophiealiice</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEhQ4uSLqpJMdVWi_i75QzA\">@supernatural-girl97</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbMjLzeZOiw097UfkLMIxIw\">@coffeebooksandfandom</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmToUcLU1n388gzQ38anXog\">@esoltis280</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXFYeI57g9SMd7qt-SB_oAg\">@poerebel</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mifWDZ6NIu_ob1sV8Fw0dWQ\">@laochbaineann</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvoHONrlb9zzqCPyqVY9YZA\">@crushed-pink-petals</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbzINLfv17mQRDzuIowmuaA\">@thisismysecrethappyplace</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfBS0BI2T_apEQcN2Elg4vg\">@mrs-captain-evans</a></p></p>",

your screams waking up not only you and Chris, but\nDodger as he fled from the room each night. \nYour voice was hoarse, throat soar from the screams. \u00a0</p><p>You didn\u2019t want to forget what happened with your mother,\nyou just wanted to be able to sleep without being plagued with those memories\neach time you closed your eyes. \u00a0</p><p>As much as he didn\u2019t want to leave you for too long, he had\nno choice as it pertained to a business meeting for an upcoming film he had\nbeen dreaming about directing. \u00a0You\nassured him time and time again that you would be fine for the day by yourself. \u00a0It was a Saturday morning that he left, and\nwouldn\u2019t be home until late afternoon or even early evening. \u00a0</p><p>By 10 a.m that morning, you gave up on trying to get any\nsleep and instead went to sit on the couch in the living room. \u00a0You were exhausted from all the therapy\nappointments and getting maybe two hours of sleep a night; it was draining on\nyour mind and body. \u00a0The medications they\nalso gave you were making you feel somewhat of a zombie, but you knew it would\ntake weeks to get the right doses for you and for you to start feeling yourself\nagain. \u00a0</p><p>Spending the day staring blankly at the television, not even\nbothering to pay attention to what was on the screen is what you had done. \u00a0You felt numb and broken all over again; the\nmemories invading your mind like a plague, never letting you forget. \u00a0You just wanted a little piece of quiet; it\nwas all you asked for but never received. \nGuilt rippled through you and you didn\u2019t think you could handle any\nmore.</p><p>You remembered how this had already happened to you; how you\nalready overcame this struggle once in your lifetime. \u00a0It never occurred to you how hard it could be\nto go through the same exact thing a second time. \u00a0Your heart was heavy just thinking about it\nand it broke you. \u00a0You didn\u2019t want\nthis. \u00a0You just wanted it to end; to stop\nthe misery. \u00a0</p><p>Checking your phone, you saw there were missed texts from\nChris. \u00a0</p><p><b>3 P.M</b></p><p><b>Chris: Hey\nsweetheart, just checking in with you. \u00a0I\nmiss you. \u00a0</b></p><p><b>4:30 P.M</b></p><p><b>Chris: I love you\nErica</b></p><p><b>5:15 P.M</b></p><p><b>Chris: The meeting is\ntaking longer than I thought. \u00a0I\u2019m so\nsorry sweetheart. \u00a0I\u2019ll call you as soon\nas I leave. \u00a0I can pick up some dinner if\nyou\u2019d like. \u00a0Let me know</b></p><p>More guilt seeped into your body and you were overcome with\ntears spilling from your cheek. \u00a0Dodger\nsat by your feet, whimpering at your sadness. \nChris didn\u2019t deserve the mess that you had become. \u00a0He deserved someone happy; someone he could\nshare his joy with. \u00a0Even though he said\nthere was nothing you could do for him to leave you, you just didn\u2019t think you\nwere strong enough to go through this a second time. \u00a0</p><p>You decided to give him a text, not wanting to worry him to\nthe point where he would leave his meeting early and ruin such a great\nopportunity. \u00a0</p><p><b>Erica: Just sitting\nhere with Dodger and watching some tv. \u00a0I\u2019ll\nsee you when you get home. \u00a0</b></p><p>Grabbing a bottle of vodka from the cabinet, you went into\nthe bedroom and pulled out a box of photos from a box hidden in the\ncloset. \u00a0It had been there since when you\nmoved in with Chris; but had been forgotten until your memories found their way\nto you again. \u00a0</p><p>Opening the bottle of vodka, you took a giant swig and\nplanted your ass on the floor. \u00a0Lifting\nthe lid off the box, you began to sift through the photos; your heart clenching\nwith each pass of your eyes over the glossy memories. \u00a0 Pictures of your mother and you; pictures of\nyou and Sebastian during happier times; and pictures of you and Chris. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cGaahhhh!\u201d you screamed, throwing the box against the wall\nas you began to chug more of the vodka. \nOne of the pictures landed face up, sitting just at your feet. \u00a0It was a picture of you and your mother; the\nlast picture that was ever taken of the two of you. \u00a0You were spending the weekend with her; it\nwas a mere few weeks before you found out you were pregnant. \u00a0\u201cWHY???\u201d your anguish scream ripped through\nyour throat as your tears cascaded down your face. \u00a0Tears mixed with the alcohol began to blur\nyour vision as you got up on shaky legs and made your way into the master\nbathroom. \u00a0</p><p>Looking at yourself in the mirror you could see a younger\nversion of your mother making everything hurt that much more. \u00a0Turning around you went to the large tub and\nturned the water on; not even bother if it was hot or cold. \u00a0Your cell phone began to ring and you saw it\nwas Chris; indicating he must finally be done with his meeting. \u00a0As your finger hovered over the green button\nto answer, you decided you couldn\u2019t talk to him. \u00a0Not like this. </p><p>Putting the phone down you opened the cabinet under the\nsink, finding what you were looking for. \nIt was in a black sleek case. \u00a0Chris\nhad received it as a gift from Scott for Christmas. \u00a0Opening it, you took out the straight razor\nthat was meant for trimming up his beard; just like they did at the barbers\nback in the day. \u00a0</p><p>Stopping the water, you grabbed your phone and the straight razor,\nsetting it on the stool next to the tub. \nTaking a few more large chugs of vodka, you submerged yourself into the\nbath, fully clothed as water splashed onto the tiled floor. \u00a0The water was slightly warm but your body\nfelt chilled thinking about what was to come. \n \u00a0</p><p>Taking a deep breath, you decided to call Sebastian before\nanything happened. \u00a0Pulling up his name,\nyou pressed send and began to hear the ringing. \nWithout eating all day and the copious amounts of alcohol in your\nsystem, you could barely keep yourself upright in the tub; your body constantly\nsliding down further into the deep tub. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey Erica,\u201d Sebastian\u2019s cheery voice greeted you, only\nmaking you cry harder. \u00a0\u201cHey hey hey\u2026what\u2019s\nwrong sweetie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026can\u2019t\u2026do\u2026.this\u2026anymore,\u201d you wailed between labored breaths. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cErica,\u201d Sebastian called your name, but you could barely\nhear him through your consistent crying. \n\u201cERICA,\u201d he yelled this time. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt hurts\u2026it hurts SO much Sebby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Chris Erica? \nTell me where he is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt\u2026at a meeting. \nDunno when he will he be\u2019re,\u201d your words slurred heavily. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHave you been drinking? \nErica you know you can\u2019t drink with the medications you are on. \u00a0Where are you right now?\u201d \u00a0Sebastian\u2019s voice was laced with worry. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIn tha tub. \u00a0Hard to\u2026.,\u201d\nyour words cut off as your head slipped the water. \u00a0As you emerged from the water you gasped for\nbreath. \u00a0Luckily your phone was\nwaterproof. </p><p>\u201cERICA!!! \nERICA!!! \u00a0ARE YOU ALRIGHT?,\u201d you\nheard Seb yelling. \u00a0</p><p>You coughed up water before replying. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m\u2026.i\u2019m just ready for it ta end. \u00a0End it all!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMargarita call police to Chris\u2019 house and then call him,\u201d Sebastian\nsaid to his girlfriend. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWill you do me a favor Sebby?\u201d your voice began to quiver\nat the thought of what was about to happen. \n\u201cWill you-will you tell Chris I love him?\u201d \u00a0You ended the call, throwing your phone onto\nthe floor as it shattered into pieces. \u00a0</p><p>~~~</p><p>Out of nowhere, Chris felt a sense of dread wash over his\nbody as he drove down the freeway, just wanting to get back to the house with\nyou. \u00a0His meeting went way too long and\nhe hadn\u2019t heard from you except for that one text. \u00a0His phone began to ring and he saw Margarita\u2019s\nname pop up. \u00a0Confused, he answered\nit. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris where are you?\u201d her voice was frantic. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way home. \nI\u2019ll be there in about five minutes. \nWhy? \u00a0What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>She took a ragged breath before answering. \u00a0\u201cErica called Sebastian. \u00a0Sounds like she\u2019s drunk and she\u2019s in the tub\nand she keeps saying she wants it all to end.\u201d</p><p>Chris\u2019 mind went into overdrive; his eyes growing wide as he\nstepped his foot harder on the gas. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI called the police to get to your house before I called\nyou. \u00a0I don\u2019t know if they will be there\nbefore you or not. \u00a0Chris-it doesn\u2019t\nsound good.\u201d \u00a0Margarita began to cry, not\nwanting to lose her best friend. \u00a0</p><p>Fear seeped through Chris\u2019 bones as he swerved in and out of\nthe lanes, not caring how many traffic laws he was breaking. \u00a0He needed to get to you before you did\nanything more reckless than you already had. \n</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost there Margie,\u201d Chris responded. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh god.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? \u00a0What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2026she just told Sebastian to tell you that she loved you\nbefore the line went dead.\u201d</p><p>~~~</p><p>Picking up the straight razor, you gripped it in your\ntrembling hands. \u00a0The water was becoming\ncolder, your body shivering. \u00a0You faintly\nheard a crashing sound downstairs, footsteps on the stairs as you placed the\nblade along your left wrist. \u00a0Tears stung\nyour eyes as you pressed the razor hard onto your skin and pulled down, right\nalong the vein. \u00a0Bright red blood immediately\nseeped from your delicate skin, dropping into the water as you continued to\npush down hard. \u00a0</p><p>The door to the bathroom swung open. \u00a0\u201cERICA NO!\u201d Chris yelled. \u00a0He was at your side in three quick strides,\nforcing the razor out of your hand. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cLET ME DO THIS!\u201d you screamed, thrashing around the pink\nstained tub. \u00a0Chris pulled you from the\ncold water and held a towel to your bleeding wrist. \u00a0You began to struggle in his grip, wanting to\ndie, to end this suffering life, but he wasn\u2019t budging. \u00a0\u201cLET ME GO! \nJUST LET ME DIE!!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that Erica,\u201d Chris cried quietly as he held you\nclose to him; your body trembling. \u00a0Your\nlips began to turn blue; your breathing ragged. \nChris looked down and saw that the towel was doing nothing to stop the\nbleeding from your wrist. \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t do this\nto me-please,\u201d Chris pleaded; his own tears flowing from his eyes at the\nthought of losing you. \u00a0\u201cStay with me\nErica. \u00a0Please stay with me baby. \u00a0I can\u2019t-I can\u2019t lose you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPOLICE! \u00a0WHERE ARE\nYOU AT?\u201d Chris heard the police officers yell from downstairs. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cUPSTAIRS MASTER BATHROOM. \nHURRY!\u201d came Chris\u2019 plea of demand. \n\u201cJust hold on baby. \u00a0Hold on for\nme please.\u201d \u00a0Your body went limp in his\narms as everything faded to black. \u00a0</p><p>~~~</p><p><b>One Month Later</b></p><p>\u201cYour heart stopped Erica. \nDo you think you\u2019re ready to go back to everything?\u201d \u00a0Dr. Lee asked as she sat across from you in\nthe large office. \u00a0</p><p>Looking around the room, you took your time to reflect on\nthe last four weeks you spent here. \u00a0It\nwas an inpatient mental health facility near Los Angeles. \u00a0Being here, away from everything and with the\nhelp of staff and nurses at all times, you really came around with their\nhelp. \u00a0Dr. Lee was right; your heart did\nstop the night you tried to take your life. \nAnd now that you look back on that night, you couldn\u2019t believe you did\nthat to Chris; to everybody who loved you. \n</p><p>During your stay at the facility, they managed to quickly\nget you on an appropriate dosing of medications that not only made you stop\nfeeling like a zombie, but made you feel better all around. \u00a0For the first time since you regained your\nmemories, you were happy. \u00a0</p><p>Giving Dr. Lee a smile, you nodded your head. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve never been more ready.\u201d</p><p>After your last session with Dr. Lee, you walked down the\nhalls of the treatment facility for the last time and into your room. \u00a0Standing there surprising you was Chris. \u00a0He was holding a bouquet of flowers; a bright\nsmile on his face. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cCongratulations beautiful,\u201d he beamed. \u00a0You ran to him, jumping into his open arms as\nyou wrapped your legs around his thighs. \nNuzzling your face into his neck, you reveled at his smell. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d you breathed into his neck before giving him\na chaste kiss on his pulse point. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI missed you too Erica. \nSo much-you have no idea.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I was stuck in here for your birthday,\u201d you\nfrowned at the thought. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey now. \u00a0My birthday\nmeans nothing to me if you aren\u2019t happy alright?\u201d \u00a0You gave him a nod into his neck. \u00a0\u201cAre you ready to go home?\u201d</p><p>Pulling away from him, you placed a tender kiss to his\nlips. \u00a0Chris pulled you closer to his\nfirm body with one arm, as his free hand threaded through your hair. \u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>The car ride back to the house was quiet, but not\nawkward. \u00a0Chris held your hand the entire\ntime as you let your head rest out of the window; missing the feeling of wind\non your face. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re ready for this babe?\u201d \u00a0Chris asked as he squeezed your hand.</p><p>\u201cLike I told Dr. Lee earlier, I\u2019ve never been more ready\nChris. \u00a0My medications are adjusted and\nwith all the extracurricular classes they let us choose from, I now have so\nmany hobbies that I enjoy and it also helps me ease my mind and be at\npeace. \u00a0I haven\u2019t felt this good-this\nhappy in months.\u201d</p><p>Chris smiled at your words, picking up your hand in his and\nkissing your knuckles. \u00a0\u201cBy the way. \u00a0Robert is throwing a big fourth of July\nbash. \u00a0I was wondering if you would be up\nto going to that?\u201d \u00a0The 4<sup>th</sup> of\nJuly was still two weeks away, giving you plenty of time to adjust to life\nagain. \u00a0Giving him a smile, you\nnodded. \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe neighbors must be throwing a party,\u201d you chuckled as\nyou saw all the cars lined in the neighborhood. \n</p><p>Chris helped with your bags out of the car and held onto\nyour hand tightly as you walked through the door from the garage. \u00a0Dodger came running up to you, jumping onto\nyour laugh. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDodger!!! \u00a0Oh boy I\nmissed you so much! \u00a0Yes, who\u2019s a good\nboy? \u00a0Ooohhh,\u201d you cooed as you let him\nslobber kisses all over your face. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOk bubba that\u2019s enough. \nOff my girl,\u201d Chris chuckled as he helped you back to your feet. \u00a0</p><p>The two of you turned the corner of the kitchen and you were\nfrozen in place at the sight in front of you. \n</p><p>\u201cWelcome back Erica!\u201d everyone cheered and clapped for\nyou. \u00a0</p><p>Standing in front of you was Sebastian and Margarita, along\nwith Chris\u2019 mom, Shana, Carly and Scott. \nImmediately you burst into tears at the sight of all your loved ones.</p><p>Everyone took their turns hugging you and you felt so much\nlove and warmth spread through you. \u00a0If\nyou had any doubts before about being able to get through things, this moment\ntook those doubts away. \u00a0</p><p>Turns out Chris had been planning this since his birthday\nbecause he knew how sad you were that you couldn\u2019t be with him for it. \u00a0There was a strict rule about no visitors at\nthe treatment facility if you were only doing a four week program. \u00a0But you were at least still able to talk to\nhim each and every day on the phone which made it a little better. \u00a0</p><p>Lisa and Chris\u2019 sister made quick work of bringing all the\nfood out from their hiding place in the pantry. \nThe food smelled amazing and your mouth was watering at finally being\nable to have a good home cooked meal again. \n</p><p>After dinner was eaten, everyone moved to the backyard and\nenjoyed the last few hours before the sun dipped below the horizon. \u00a0It was without a doubt an absolute perfect\nday so far. \u00a0</p><p>You saw Chris motion to his mother and she disappeared into\nthe house. \u00a0A curious expression was on\nyour face as you talked to Margie, but you let it go. \u00a0</p><p>A few minutes later, there were flutes of champagne being\nbrought around. \u00a0Graciously, you took one\nin your hand. \u00a0The new medications they\nput you on wouldn\u2019t do any damage if you drank on them; as long as you drank occasionally\nand not on a daily basis. </p><p>Taking a sip, you crinkled your nose as the bubbles\ntickled. \u00a0Your brows furrowed as Chris\ntook your glass and set it down on the small table next to you; along with his glass. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cErica, do you remember the fight we had the day of your\naccident?\u201d \u00a0It wasn\u2019t hard to remember\nyour memories anymore as the scene flooded into your mind. \u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cFor the hundredth time,\nI am NOT cheating on you Erica!\u201d Chris roared, throwing his hands up in the air\nas his frustration and anger glowed on his face. \u00a0</i></p><p><i>This is the same fight\nthe two of you have been having all month and it was starting to take its toll\non you. \u00a0Each day, he spent less and less\ntime with you and instead headed out with friends;

always telling you that you and Chris were destined to be\ntogether. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know that this must be a difficult time for you\nErica. \u00a0A big day like this and you don\u2019t\nhave the most important woman here with you right now.\u201d \u00a0As she spoke, you nodded your head, willing\nthe tears to not ruin your makeup. \u00a0\u201cAnd\nI just wanted you to know that I love you just as much as I love my own\nchildren. \u00a0You make my Chris so happy and\nI\u2019m so blessed that you are going to be a part of this family forever.\u201d \u00a0You wrapped your arms around her, clinging\nfor life as her words touched your heart. \nWhen she pulled away from you, she grabbed something from her\npurse. \u00a0\u201cI wanted to give you this so you\ncould wear it. \u00a0I had it made special for\ntoday.\u201d</p><p>She placed a small white box in your palms and you carefully\nopened it. \u00a0When you saw what it was, you\ngasped; Lisa immediately balling up tissues under your eyes to catch your\ntears. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful,\u201d you whispered. \u00a0It was a button about the size of a quarter,\nwith your mother\u2019s picture on it. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI was thinking we could pin it to the inside of your dress,\nright next to your heart. \u00a0That way she\nwill be nice and close to you today.\u201d \nNodding your head, you held the tissues up to your eyes as she carefully\npinned the button to the inside of your dress. \nYou don\u2019t know why, but you instantly felt better, like a weight lifted\noff your shoulder. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThey are ready,\u201d Scarlet said from the doorway, standing\nwith Margarita by her side. \u00a0\u201cDo you want\nme to bring in Robert and Sebastian?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Lisa quickly helped to make sure your makeup wasn\u2019t ruined\nand gave your arms a gentle squeeze. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, bring them in,\u201d you spoke softly. \u00a0You looked down at your dress, smiling. \u00a0The dress itself was extremely simple. \u00a0It was white satin with thick straps like a\ntank top. \u00a0At the waist, there was a\nbeaded diamond belt cinching your waist and then it flared out lightly from\nthere; nowhere near a ball gown flare. \nYou tried those types of dresses on and weren\u2019t comfortable at all in\nthem; they were so heavy to move around in. \n</p><p>There was a nother knock on\nthe door and you looked up to see Robert and Sebastian looking rather dapper in\ntheir navy blue tuxes. \u00a0Their eyes were\nglossy as they took everything in. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not crying, you\u2019re\ncrying,\u201d he turned and spoke to Sebastian as he sniffled his nose. \u00a0His remark caused you to giggle and you did a\ntwirl for them. \u00a0Robert was the frist to\ngreet you, taking your hands in his. \u00a0\u201cYou\nmake an absolutley stunning bride Erica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you Robert. \u00a0You don\u2019t look too shabby yourself.\u201d \u00a0He laughed before giving you a kiss on the\ncheek. \u00a0</p><p>Sebastian was next to greet\nyou and he didn\u2019t waste any time putting his arms around your waist and giving\nyou a hug. \u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t get over how\nbeautiful you look right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey now, I\u2019ll only be second\nbest when it finally comes to your ass marrying Margarita.\u201d \u00a0That got a laugh out of both men in the room. \u00a0\u201cAnd the best part?\u201d you spoke with a\ngleaming smile. \u00a0You placed your hands\ninside the pockets. \u00a0\u201cIt has POCKETS!\u201d</p><p>The music began to start and\nRobert handed you your boquet of flowers. \nTrailing behind them, you made your way outside the double doors. \u00a0Robert and Sebastian stood on either side of\nyou, both giving you warm smiles as you placed one arm around each of\nthem. \u00a0The three of you walked down the\ncobble sidewalk before stopping. \u00a0All you\nhad to do was turn left around the building and there Chris would be, waiting\nfor you. \u00a0</p><p>Looking up at the sky, it was\nthe perfect day for an outside wedding. \u00a0\u201cReady?\u201d\nRobert whispered to you. \u00a0Giving him a\nnod, the three of you turned the corner as everyone stood up. \u00a0</p><p>Your eyes instantly landed on\nChris. \u00a0He had never looked more handsome\nthan in this exact moment. \u00a0Slowly, the\nthree of you made your way up the aisle; your eyes never leaving Chris\u2019. \u00a0His mouth parted slightly as he got a better\nlook at you, and then you saw him wipe away a tear. \u00a0Your heart hammered in your chest, just\nwanting to be there next to him. \u00a0</p><p>Chris walked down the two\nsteps to greet you, taking your hand in his and helped you up the steps. \u00a0\u201cYou look so beautiful Erica,\u201d he whispered\nto you, making you blush. \u00a0</p><p>During the wedding, your eyes\nand Chris\u2019 stayed glued to each-other\u2019s. \nYou felt safe with your hands in his; heart full of love. \u00a0</p><p>It was time for your vows,\nand you both decided to speak from the heart instead of the basic vows that\nmany people do at weddings. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cErica, from the moment I\nmeant you, I knew you were special, even though you weren\u2019t mine-yet.\u201d \u00a0There was a chorus of giggles from the\naudience as your eyes peered over at Sebastian\u2019s. \u00a0He was smiling and shaking his head. \u00a0\u201cThroughout the time I got to know you, you\nbecame such a close friend to me and I knew one way or another, you would\nalways be a part of my life and I was happy with that. \u00a0But then one horrific accident happened and\nsomehow you ended up with me. \u00a0And then\nanother accident happened earlier this year and I thought I was going to lose\nyou. \u00a0I thought you would wake up one day\nand think \u2018what the hell am I doing with this doofus\u2019\u201d. \u00a0Another chorus of laughter erupted. \u00a0\u201cBut here you are, still with me. \u00a0And when you agreed to marry me, it was the\nhappiest moment of my life, until now. \u00a0I\nlove you so much Erica and I can\u2019t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.\u201d</p><p>You grabbed the tissue you\nhad been holding, knowing you would need it as you wiped away the tears from\nyour cheeks; not even caring anymore if your makeup was ruined. \u00a0Chris\u2019 words made you heart clench with love\nand all you wanted to do was pull him into a searing kiss, but you knew you had\nto wait. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cChris,\u201d you began to speak\nwith a shaky voice. \u00a0\u201cFate has a funny\nway of playing things out. \u00a0Over the\ncourse of the last few years, I didn\u2019t imagine how this would be endgame.\u201d \u00a0Naturally, those who were there that were a\npart of the Avengers movies snickered at your little comment. \u00a0\u201cBut I couldn\u2019t be more happier. \u00a0You have fought for me, time and time again\nduring the hardest parts of our relationship. \nIn fact, you had to do it twice. \nAnd that shows me how much dedication you have between us. \u00a0It shows that you are someone I can lean on\nand trust with my whole heart, knowing you would do anything for me. \u00a0I am proud to stand next to you today, and to\nbecome your wife.\u201d</p><p>Dodger came up to Chris, his\ncolor holding the boxes with your wedding bands in them. \u00a0The rings were placed on your respected\nfingers; smiles all around. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou may now kiss the bride,\u201d\nthe officiant stated. \u00a0</p><p>Chris\u2019 large warm hands\ncupped your cheeks, pulling you to him as he placed his lips on yours. \u00a0Your knees grew weak as you held onto his\narms, never wanting the kiss to end. \nChris pulled away, glancing lovingly into your eyes. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cEveryone, please\ncongratulate Mr. and Mrs. Chris Evans!\u201d the officiant said. \u00a0Margarita handed you your flowers and you\ngripped Chris\u2019 hand as the two of you walked down the aisle together as a\nmarried couple. \u00a0 </p><p style=\"\">Tag List:\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-vGAp5DFUjh-DJa10UdTfA\">@iamthemaskhewears</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-7P3-Sw9RWpGbn5Hx4MI5Q\">@janeyboo</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEFp2lYEPZfxUNkza9hN0Eg\">@trees-and-ink</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJzc50uJqSdLUFXRqSsJB-w\">@nina-bok</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfOj3-VofGUNqc0Iq304JQg\">@geektastic84</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miCK4X7M_2IwmUOnWC6AgXw\">@sarahp879</a> @our-daily-struggle <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXVZGDoySbGQ8Vh_yGF0EcQ\">@nomadicpixel</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMSzB-aY4LfrOBw8cJbeg0g\">@trishevans</a> @be-amazing <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLlHP8S74U3XruLxmsh6tBQ\">@wipplog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muhbhDwz85jaQCL2vvjSymw\">@ashann7</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6vBdmdRGtZWn7vJIREsBOw\">@have-aheart</a>@agambleaway <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPOeZGo5lyCuxR2g6yDdf9Q\">@lizzyclifford13-blog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVwtmzLzpnPVt4qXt9asVOQ\">@lovingquotes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9nHaXHEK2rAR_IE_wt-3Yg\">@titty-teetee</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBb4kX5ZjREpJq2bNqumg4g\">@ajosieface</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7mk2fSXnX5BBSZUlB54H1w\">@ffcsave</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2sGOmRlq8MwFleb1fFMs7Q\">@dottirose</a> @things-i-like-1982 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVHhgkZlxfFmUXjFdQBGwKg\">@sirod-30</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myIG1dSI2kcFSS0i64oU60Q\">@skyewardolicitycloisdelena91</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx92Ca0bmTX9IHcJIKCwOQ\">@patzammit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maRk-wkBYlRixBAo8hWCkjg\">@brastrangled</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGv8r6fJX_2qORMc07jo2VQ\">@miss-cap21</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-B6U87jynWLd9naB5G_dEw\">@pumbibaby</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwBVtWXJkPYvhG69w0u49VQ\">@marvelouslyme96</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcRxn7YLseanjYhB44PCesg\">@kanupps06</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moH2485CD_OzLSWhAudQMjA\">@the-real-kellymonster</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYVvyPBlJuKY24WaTnPPnhQ\">@zohoffman</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPJVwxDeaQzxOgOZH4jTZ3w\">@princess-evans-addict</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLEN1bSPv7F2jO2qK-XqfvQ\">@white-chocolate-mocha-fan</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUq3sPk9lcgG_jXUp6RsRIQ\">@remember-that-one-blog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9gP0gKLqbIcrjDz0T37bBg\">@sincerelyfan</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0E2wFcz7-jjpygcaO4nuSw\">@projectxhappiness</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhvcg66HgRTM7-gI4qWvFvQ\">@libbitinasdeath</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfGDFCWQwdHP6h2bfQLKLqA\">@hispeculiartreasure</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mc2Kb_Y38BjoHk-FIWY7Rlg\">@guera31</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtaWaN_ighiYYScW7vLIC9w\">@ssweet-empowerment</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvRHJPQOLxmyZlKUa6rlO2A\">@sfreeborn</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpmGAEwKsOKtyIgI-c5Ttqg\">@jjlevin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq3cy1j5dCpdq9OpT4x3Ukw\">@badassbaker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5QSam4Ife2TKINrNYibWHA\">@sophiealiice</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEhQ4uSLqpJMdVWi_i75QzA\">@supernatural-girl97</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbMjLzeZOiw097UfkLMIxIw\">@coffeebooksandfandom</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmToUcLU1n388gzQ38anXog\">@esoltis280</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXFYeI57g9SMd7qt-SB_oAg\">@poerebel</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mifWDZ6NIu_ob1sV8Fw0dWQ\">@laochbaineann</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvoHONrlb9zzqCPyqVY9YZA\">@crushed-pink-petals</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbzINLfv17mQRDzuIowmuaA\">@thisismysecrethappyplace</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfBS0BI2T_apEQcN2Elg4vg\">@mrs-captain-evans</a></p></p>",

My spell check decided to stop working!</b></p><p>The next month was a struggle and many times you were sure\nthings would end between you and Chris permanently. &nbsp;After the talk between you and Chris at the\nhotel room in New York, you decided to let him in once again to help you. &nbsp;</p><p>You both flew back to Los Angeles the next day and got right\nback to work. &nbsp;Upping your appointments\nwith your psychiatrist to twice a week, along with a seeing a counselor\nweekly. &nbsp;But those appointments didn&rsquo;t\nstop the nightmares from happening. &nbsp;</p><p>It was a near nightly battle with your mind trying to get\nsome half decent sleep; your screams waking up not only you and Chris, but\nDodger as he fled from the room each night. \nYour voice was hoarse, throat soar from the screams. &nbsp;</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t want to forget what happened with your mother,\nyou just wanted to be able to sleep without being plagued with those memories\neach time you closed your eyes. &nbsp;</p><p>As much as he didn&rsquo;t want to leave you for too long, he had\nno choice as it pertained to a business meeting for an upcoming film he had\nbeen dreaming about directing. &nbsp;You\nassured him time and time again that you would be fine for the day by yourself. &nbsp;It was a Saturday morning that he left, and\nwouldn&rsquo;t be home until late afternoon or even early evening. &nbsp;</p><p>By 10 a.m that morning, you gave up on trying to get any\nsleep and instead went to sit on the couch in the living room. &nbsp;You were exhausted from all the therapy\nappointments and getting maybe two hours of sleep a night; it was draining on\nyour mind and body. &nbsp;The medications they\nalso gave you were making you feel somewhat of a zombie, but you knew it would\ntake weeks to get the right doses for you and for you to start feeling yourself\nagain. &nbsp;</p><p>Spending the day staring blankly at the television, not even\nbothering to pay attention to what was on the screen is what you had done. &nbsp;You felt numb and broken all over again; the\nmemories invading your mind like a plague, never letting you forget. &nbsp;You just wanted a little piece of quiet; it\nwas all you asked for but never received. \nGuilt rippled through you and you didn&rsquo;t think you could handle any\nmore.</p><p>You remembered how this had already happened to you; how you\nalready overcame this struggle once in your lifetime. &nbsp;It never occurred to you how hard it could be\nto go through the same exact thing a second time. &nbsp;Your heart was heavy just thinking about it\nand it broke you. &nbsp;You didn&rsquo;t want\nthis. &nbsp;You just wanted it to end; to stop\nthe misery. &nbsp;</p><p>Checking your phone, you saw there were missed texts from\nChris. &nbsp;</p><p><b>3 P.M</b></p><p><b>Chris: Hey\nsweetheart, just checking in with you. &nbsp;I\nmiss you. &nbsp;</b></p><p><b>4:30 P.M</b></p><p><b>Chris: I love you\nErica</b></p><p><b>5:15 P.M</b></p><p><b>Chris: The meeting is\ntaking longer than I thought. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m so\nsorry sweetheart. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll call you as soon\nas I leave. &nbsp;I can pick up some dinner if\nyou&rsquo;d like. &nbsp;Let me know</b></p><p>More guilt seeped into your body and you were overcome with\ntears spilling from your cheek. &nbsp;Dodger\nsat by your feet, whimpering at your sadness. \nChris didn&rsquo;t deserve the mess that you had become. &nbsp;He deserved someone happy; someone he could\nshare his joy with. &nbsp;Even though he said\nthere was nothing you could do for him to leave you, you just didn&rsquo;t think you\nwere strong enough to go through this a second time. &nbsp;</p><p>You decided to give him a text, not wanting to worry him to\nthe point where he would leave his meeting early and ruin such a great\nopportunity. &nbsp;</p><p><b>Erica: Just sitting\nhere with Dodger and watching some tv. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll\nsee you when you get home. &nbsp;</b></p><p>Grabbing a bottle of vodka from the cabinet, you went into\nthe bedroom and pulled out a box of photos from a box hidden in the\ncloset. &nbsp;It had been there since when you\nmoved in with Chris; but had been forgotten until your memories found their way\nto you again. &nbsp;</p><p>Opening the bottle of vodka, you took a giant swig and\nplanted your ass on the floor. &nbsp;Lifting\nthe lid off the box, you began to sift through the photos; your heart clenching\nwith each pass of your eyes over the glossy memories. &nbsp; Pictures of your mother and you; pictures of\nyou and Sebastian during happier times; and pictures of you and Chris. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Gaahhhh!&rdquo; you screamed, throwing the box against the wall\nas you began to chug more of the vodka. \nOne of the pictures landed face up, sitting just at your feet. &nbsp;It was a picture of you and your mother; the\nlast picture that was ever taken of the two of you. &nbsp;You were spending the weekend with her; it\nwas a mere few weeks before you found out you were pregnant. &nbsp;&ldquo;WHY???&rdquo; your anguish scream ripped through\nyour throat as your tears cascaded down your face. &nbsp;Tears mixed with the alcohol began to blur\nyour vision as you got up on shaky legs and made your way into the master\nbathroom. &nbsp;</p><p>Looking at yourself in the mirror you could see a younger\nversion of your mother making everything hurt that much more. &nbsp;Turning around you went to the large tub and\nturned the water on; not even bother if it was hot or cold. &nbsp;Your cell phone began to ring and you saw it\nwas Chris; indicating he must finally be done with his meeting. &nbsp;As your finger hovered over the green button\nto answer, you decided you couldn&rsquo;t talk to him. &nbsp;Not like this. </p><p>Putting the phone down you opened the cabinet under the\nsink, finding what you were looking for. \nIt was in a black sleek case. &nbsp;Chris\nhad received it as a gift from Scott for Christmas. &nbsp;Opening it, you took out the straight razor\nthat was meant for trimming up his beard; just like they did at the barbers\nback in the day. &nbsp;</p><p>Stopping the water, you grabbed your phone and the straight razor,\nsetting it on the stool next to the tub. \nTaking a few more large chugs of vodka, you submerged yourself into the\nbath, fully clothed as water splashed onto the tiled floor. &nbsp;The water was slightly warm but your body\nfelt chilled thinking about what was to come. \n &nbsp;</p><p>Taking a deep breath, you decided to call Sebastian before\nanything happened. &nbsp;Pulling up his name,\nyou pressed send and began to hear the ringing. \nWithout eating all day and the copious amounts of alcohol in your\nsystem, you could barely keep yourself upright in the tub; your body constantly\nsliding down further into the deep tub. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Erica,&rdquo; Sebastian&rsquo;s cheery voice greeted you, only\nmaking you cry harder. &nbsp;&ldquo;Hey hey hey&hellip;what&rsquo;s\nwrong sweetie?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;can&rsquo;t&hellip;do&hellip;.this&hellip;anymore,&rdquo; you wailed between labored breaths. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Erica,&rdquo; Sebastian called your name, but you could barely\nhear him through your consistent crying. \n&ldquo;ERICA,&rdquo; he yelled this time. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It hurts&hellip;it hurts SO much Sebby.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Chris Erica? \nTell me where he is?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;At&hellip;at a meeting. \nDunno when he will he be&rsquo;re,&rdquo; your words slurred heavily. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you been drinking? \nErica you know you can&rsquo;t drink with the medications you are on. &nbsp;Where are you right now?&rdquo; &nbsp;Sebastian&rsquo;s voice was laced with worry. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;In tha tub. &nbsp;Hard to&hellip;.,&rdquo;\nyour words cut off as your head slipped the water. &nbsp;As you emerged from the water you gasped for\nbreath. &nbsp;Luckily your phone was\nwaterproof. </p><p>&ldquo;ERICA!!! \nERICA!!! &nbsp;ARE YOU ALRIGHT?,&rdquo; you\nheard Seb yelling. &nbsp;</p><p>You coughed up water before replying. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip;.i&rsquo;m just ready for it ta end. &nbsp;End it all!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Margarita call police to Chris&rsquo; house and then call him,&rdquo; Sebastian\nsaid to his girlfriend. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Will you do me a favor Sebby?&rdquo; your voice began to quiver\nat the thought of what was about to happen. \n&ldquo;Will you-will you tell Chris I love him?&rdquo; &nbsp;You ended the call, throwing your phone onto\nthe floor as it shattered into pieces. &nbsp;</p><p>~~~</p><p>Out of nowhere, Chris felt a sense of dread wash over his\nbody as he drove down the freeway, just wanting to get back to the house with\nyou. &nbsp;His meeting went way too long and\nhe hadn&rsquo;t heard from you except for that one text. &nbsp;His phone began to ring and he saw Margarita&rsquo;s\nname pop up. &nbsp;Confused, he answered\nit. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Chris where are you?&rdquo; her voice was frantic. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my way home. \nI&rsquo;ll be there in about five minutes. \nWhy? &nbsp;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p><p>She took a ragged breath before answering. &nbsp;&ldquo;Erica called Sebastian. &nbsp;Sounds like she&rsquo;s drunk and she&rsquo;s in the tub\nand she keeps saying she wants it all to end.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris&rsquo; mind went into overdrive; his eyes growing wide as he\nstepped his foot harder on the gas. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I called the police to get to your house before I called\nyou. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know if they will be there\nbefore you or not. &nbsp;Chris-it doesn&rsquo;t\nsound good.&rdquo; &nbsp;Margarita began to cry, not\nwanting to lose her best friend. &nbsp;</p><p>Fear seeped through Chris&rsquo; bones as he swerved in and out of\nthe lanes, not caring how many traffic laws he was breaking. &nbsp;He needed to get to you before you did\nanything more reckless than you already had. \n</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost there Margie,&rdquo; Chris responded. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh god.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? &nbsp;What happened?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&hellip;she just told Sebastian to tell you that she loved you\nbefore the line went dead.&rdquo;</p><p>~~~</p><p>Picking up the straight razor, you gripped it in your\ntrembling hands. &nbsp;The water was becoming\ncolder, your body shivering. &nbsp;You faintly\nheard a crashing sound downstairs, footsteps on the stairs as you placed the\nblade along your left wrist. &nbsp;Tears stung\nyour eyes as you pressed the razor hard onto your skin and pulled down, right\nalong the vein. &nbsp;Bright red blood immediately\nseeped from your delicate skin, dropping into the water as you continued to\npush down hard. &nbsp;</p><p>The door to the bathroom swung open. &nbsp;&ldquo;ERICA NO!&rdquo; Chris yelled. &nbsp;He was at your side in three quick strides,\nforcing the razor out of your hand. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;LET ME DO THIS!&rdquo; you screamed, thrashing around the pink\nstained tub. &nbsp;Chris pulled you from the\ncold water and held a towel to your bleeding wrist. &nbsp;You began to struggle in his grip, wanting to\ndie, to end this suffering life, but he wasn&rsquo;t budging. &nbsp;&ldquo;LET ME GO! \nJUST LET ME DIE!!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that Erica,&rdquo; Chris cried quietly as he held you\nclose to him; your body trembling. &nbsp;Your\nlips began to turn blue; your breathing ragged. \nChris looked down and saw that the towel was doing nothing to stop the\nbleeding from your wrist. &nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do this\nto me-please,&rdquo; Chris pleaded; his own tears flowing from his eyes at the\nthought of losing you. &nbsp;&ldquo;Stay with me\nErica. &nbsp;Please stay with me baby. &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t-I can&rsquo;t lose you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;POLICE! &nbsp;WHERE ARE\nYOU AT?&rdquo; Chris heard the police officers yell from downstairs. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;UPSTAIRS MASTER BATHROOM. \nHURRY!&rdquo; came Chris&rsquo; plea of demand. \n&ldquo;Just hold on baby. &nbsp;Hold on for\nme please.&rdquo; &nbsp;Your body went limp in his\narms as everything faded to black. &nbsp;</p><p>~~~</p><p><b>One Month Later</b></p><p>&ldquo;Your heart stopped Erica. \nDo you think you&rsquo;re ready to go back to everything?&rdquo; &nbsp;Dr. Lee asked as she sat across from you in\nthe large office. &nbsp;</p><p>Looking around the room, you took your time to reflect on\nthe last four weeks you spent here. &nbsp;It\nwas an inpatient mental health facility near Los Angeles. &nbsp;Being here, away from everything and with the\nhelp of staff and nurses at all times, you really came around with their\nhelp. &nbsp;Dr. Lee was right; your heart did\nstop the night you tried to take your life. \nAnd now that you look back on that night, you couldn&rsquo;t believe you did\nthat to Chris; to everybody who loved you. \n</p><p>During your stay at the facility, they managed to quickly\nget you on an appropriate dosing of medications that not only made you stop\nfeeling like a zombie, but made you feel better all around. &nbsp;For the first time since you regained your\nmemories, you were happy. &nbsp;</p><p>Giving Dr. Lee a smile, you nodded your head. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been more ready.&rdquo;</p><p>After your last session with Dr. Lee, you walked down the\nhalls of the treatment facility for the last time and into your room. &nbsp;Standing there surprising you was Chris. &nbsp;He was holding a bouquet of flowers; a bright\nsmile on his face. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Congratulations beautiful,&rdquo; he beamed. &nbsp;You ran to him, jumping into his open arms as\nyou wrapped your legs around his thighs. \nNuzzling your face into his neck, you reveled at his smell. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I missed you,&rdquo; you breathed into his neck before giving him\na chaste kiss on his pulse point. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I missed you too Erica. \nSo much-you have no idea.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I was stuck in here for your birthday,&rdquo; you\nfrowned at the thought. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey now. &nbsp;My birthday\nmeans nothing to me if you aren&rsquo;t happy alright?&rdquo; &nbsp;You gave him a nod into his neck. &nbsp;&ldquo;Are you ready to go home?&rdquo;</p><p>Pulling away from him, you placed a tender kiss to his\nlips. &nbsp;Chris pulled you closer to his\nfirm body with one arm, as his free hand threaded through your hair. &nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go home.&rdquo;</p><p>The car ride back to the house was quiet, but not\nawkward. &nbsp;Chris held your hand the entire\ntime as you let your head rest out of the window; missing the feeling of wind\non your face. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure you&rsquo;re ready for this babe?&rdquo; &nbsp;Chris asked as he squeezed your hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Like I told Dr. Lee earlier, I&rsquo;ve never been more ready\nChris. &nbsp;My medications are adjusted and\nwith all the extracurricular classes they let us choose from, I now have so\nmany hobbies that I enjoy and it also helps me ease my mind and be at\npeace. &nbsp;I haven&rsquo;t felt this good-this\nhappy in months.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris smiled at your words, picking up your hand in his and\nkissing your knuckles. &nbsp;&ldquo;By the way. &nbsp;Robert is throwing a big fourth of July\nbash. &nbsp;I was wondering if you would be up\nto going to that?&rdquo; &nbsp;The 4<sup>th</sup> of\nJuly was still two weeks away, giving you plenty of time to adjust to life\nagain. &nbsp;Giving him a smile, you\nnodded. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The neighbors must be throwing a party,&rdquo; you chuckled as\nyou saw all the cars lined in the neighborhood. \n</p><p>Chris helped with your bags out of the car and held onto\nyour hand tightly as you walked through the door from the garage. &nbsp;Dodger came running up to you, jumping onto\nyour laugh. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Dodger!!! &nbsp;Oh boy I\nmissed you so much! &nbsp;Yes, who&rsquo;s a good\nboy? &nbsp;Ooohhh,&rdquo; you cooed as you let him\nslobber kisses all over your face. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok bubba that&rsquo;s enough. \nOff my girl,&rdquo; Chris chuckled as he helped you back to your feet. &nbsp;</p><p>The two of you turned the corner of the kitchen and you were\nfrozen in place at the sight in front of you. \n</p><p>&ldquo;Welcome back Erica!&rdquo; everyone cheered and clapped for\nyou. &nbsp;</p><p>Standing in front of you was Sebastian and Margarita, along\nwith Chris&rsquo; mom, Shana, Carly and Scott. \nImmediately you burst into tears at the sight of all your loved ones.</p><p>Everyone took their turns hugging you and you felt so much\nlove and warmth spread through you. &nbsp;If\nyou had any doubts before about being able to get through things, this moment\ntook those doubts away. &nbsp;</p><p>Turns out Chris had been planning this since his birthday\nbecause he knew how sad you were that you couldn&rsquo;t be with him for it. &nbsp;There was a strict rule about no visitors at\nthe treatment facility if you were only doing a four week program. &nbsp;But you were at least still able to talk to\nhim each and every day on the phone which made it a little better. &nbsp;</p><p>Lisa and Chris&rsquo; sister made quick work of bringing all the\nfood out from their hiding place in the pantry. \nThe food smelled amazing and your mouth was watering at finally being\nable to have a good home cooked meal again. \n</p><p>After dinner was eaten, everyone moved to the backyard and\nenjoyed the last few hours before the sun dipped below the horizon. &nbsp;It was without a doubt an absolute perfect\nday so far. &nbsp;</p><p>You saw Chris motion to his mother and she disappeared into\nthe house. &nbsp;A curious expression was on\nyour face as you talked to Margie, but you let it go. &nbsp;</p><p>A few minutes later, there were flutes of champagne being\nbrought around. &nbsp;Graciously, you took one\nin your hand. &nbsp;The new medications they\nput you on wouldn&rsquo;t do any damage if you drank on them; as long as you drank occasionally\nand not on a daily basis. </p><p>Taking a sip, you crinkled your nose as the bubbles\ntickled. &nbsp;Your brows furrowed as Chris\ntook your glass and set it down on the small table next to you; along with his glass. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Erica, do you remember the fight we had the day of your\naccident?&rdquo; &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t hard to remember\nyour memories anymore as the scene flooded into your mind. &nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;For the hundredth time,\nI am NOT cheating on you Erica!&rdquo; Chris roared, throwing his hands up in the air\nas his frustration and anger glowed on his face. &nbsp;</i></p><p><i>This is the same fight\nthe two of you have been having all month and it was starting to take its toll\non you. &nbsp;Each day, he spent less and less\ntime with you and instead headed out with friends; and you had no idea where he\nwas half the time. &nbsp;He was being\nsecretive it felt like, distant and it worried you to no end. </i></p><p>You nodded your head at him as he grasped your hands with\nhis large warm ones. &nbsp;&ldquo;Erica, I didn&rsquo;t\nintend for you to ever think I was cheating on you. &nbsp;I would never do that to you. &nbsp;I love you too damn much. &nbsp;You mean the absolute world to me and I\ncouldn&rsquo;t imagine my life without you.&rdquo; \nHe leaned down and placed a soft kiss to your lips. &nbsp;Your body warmed at his sweet embrace,\nwondering what he was up to. &nbsp;&ldquo;The reason\nwhy I was away so often was because I was planning something pretty special.&rdquo; &nbsp;It was that moment that he got down on one\nknee, your mouth opening with a gasp. &nbsp;&ldquo;Erica,\nsince the moment you walked into my life I have felt complete. &nbsp;I hate being away from you, for any amount of\ntime. &nbsp;You are my life now. &nbsp;Will you do the honor of marrying me?&rdquo; &nbsp;He pulled out a small black velvet box from\nhis pocket and opened it, showing off the most dazzling and beautiful ring you\nhad ever seen. &nbsp;</p><p>Tears blurred your vision in the happiest of ways as you nodded\nyour head. &nbsp;&ldquo;YES! &nbsp;Of course I will!&rdquo;</p><p>Chris graced you with the most perfect smile as he placed\nthe ring on your ring finger; cheers erupted from all around you. &nbsp;</p><p>~~~</p><p><b>Two Weeks Later</b></p><p>You were on your way to Robert&rsquo;s house for his big Fourth of\nJuly bash. &nbsp;Deciding to be festive, you\nwore a plain white t-shirt with a pair of denim shorts that had the American\nflag on the back pockets. &nbsp;You also wore\na festive headband that had two spring coils with blue and red tinsel to show\noff for fireworks. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Happy Birthday Steve Rogers,&rdquo; you joked giving your fianc&eacute; a\nsmile as he drove the car. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Very cute,&rdquo; he chuckled next to you. &nbsp;</p><p>Chris pulled up into the driveway, smirking at the fact that\nRobert had valet at the part. &nbsp;He reached\nfor his phone and sent what looked like a quick text. &nbsp;You each made your way out of the car as the\nvalet took over and gave Chris a number. \nHe held your hand tightly as you two made your way to the backyard where\nthe party was. &nbsp;You held up your left\nhand, admiring your engagement glistening in the bright sun. &nbsp;&ldquo;I still can&rsquo;t get over how pretty it is\nChris,&rdquo; you gushed. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Only the best for my girl,&rdquo; he responded as he leaned down\nto give you a kiss. &nbsp;</p><p>The two of you turned the corner of the expanse house only\nto yet again, freeze in your spot. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;CONGRATULATIONS!!!&rdquo; came a chorus of cheers along with a\nlarge banner that said &ldquo;Congrats Chris and Erica&rdquo;. &nbsp;You were stunned as to what was going\non. &nbsp;</p><p>Robert quickly made his way to you, pulling you into a bear\nhug. &nbsp;&ldquo;Robert,&rdquo; you chuckled as he set\nyou down. &nbsp;&ldquo;What-what is going on here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I already had this party planned for the 4<sup>th</sup>,\nbut when I heard of the engagement-I mean. \nCome on. &nbsp;Do you really think I\nwouldn&rsquo;t have pulled something out for the Star Spangled Man with a Plan on his\nbirthday when I heard he got engaged? \nHappy Birthday Cap. &nbsp;What are you\nnow, 101?&rdquo; &nbsp;Robert gave Chris a wink\nbefore they hugged it out. &nbsp;&ldquo;And congrats\nby the way. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s time someone put this\nman into place.&rdquo; &nbsp;You blushed at his\nwords but your smile was evident. &nbsp;</p><p>Robert placed his hand around your shoulders and moved you\ntowards the crowd; you gripped Chris&rsquo; hand before you could lose him in the\nthrong of people. &nbsp;Everybody was there,\nand you meant everybody. &nbsp;Jeremy Renner,\nScartlet Johansson, Sebastian, Margie, Gwenyth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Anthony\nMackie and even Tom Holland. &nbsp;Hell, the\ndamn Russo brothers were even there. \nLooking around, there had to have been at least 100 people gathered\naround the expanse backyard. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Robert,&rdquo; you slightly growled but he only hugged you\ntighter. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t want to\nhear that from you.&rdquo; &nbsp;That made you\ngiggle. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy for you Erica. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve gone to hell and back-literally. &nbsp;You deserve to be happy and I know Chris\nmakes you that way. &nbsp;I only ask to be\nmade the godfather to your first born.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;ROBERT!&rdquo; you chuckled. \n</p><p>&ldquo;Or your second born. \nDoesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; he responded with a shrug. &nbsp;</p><p>You shook your head but then remembered you wanted to ask\nhim something. &nbsp;You ran the idea by Chris\nand he couldn&rsquo;t have been more on board. \nWalking through the crowd you spotted Sebastian and grabbed his hand,\nmaking him walk with you. &nbsp;Once you got\nto Robert, you faced the two of them. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I need a favor to ask the both of you.&rdquo; &nbsp;You looked between the two men in front of\nyou; Chris standing next to you with his arm around your back, holding you close\nto him in encouragement. &nbsp;You tried to be\nstrong but you couldn&rsquo;t help the quivering of your chin. &nbsp;Taking a deep breath, you spoke. &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have anyone to walk me down the\naisle. &nbsp;And you both mean the absolute\nworld to me. &nbsp;I was hoping the two of you\nwould do the honors?&rdquo;</p><p>They both had glossy eyes, trying to hold back their own\ntears as they both reached for you in a tight hug. &nbsp;You felt comforted and cherished in their\narms. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I would be honored,&rdquo; Robert responded. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I was hoping you would ask me that,&rdquo; Sebastian\nreplied. &nbsp; </p><p>After the three of you hugged it out and had your tearful\nmoment, Chris placed his hand around your shoulders and you made your way into\nthe festivities. &nbsp;</p><p>Robert pulled out all the stops. &nbsp;There was a large slip &lsquo;n&rsquo; slide down the\nhill, a red, white and blue bouncy castle and the largest spread of catered\nbarbeque you had ever witnessed in your life. \n</p><p>You and Chris got congratulations throughout the rest of the\nafternoon and well into the evening as you mingled with everyone. &nbsp;Scarlet pulled you aside for girl talk with\nMargie as they wanted details about the wedding. &nbsp;Naturally, you asked them to be your\nbridesmaids during the conversation. \nThey both squealed in delight, going over ideas for you for the\nwedding. &nbsp;At least you would have a lot\nof help planning the wedding. &nbsp;</p><p>As dusk began to fall, Chris pulled you into his arms on a\nblanket on the ground. &nbsp;Your back was\nsettled against his chest as he held you close to him; the two of you looking\nup to the sky as the fireworks show started. </p><p>Chris brushed your hair away from your ear and you felt his\nbreath on your delicate skin, making you shiver under his touch. &nbsp;&ldquo;I love you so much Erica,&rdquo; he breathed into\nyour ear. &nbsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait until I get to\ncall you my wife.&rdquo;</p><p>~~~</p><p><b>One Year Later</b></p><p>After months of planning for the biggest day of your life,\nit was finally hear. &nbsp;You had a crew of\npeople helping you get ready for your marriage with Chris and your heart was\nfluttering with excitement and nerves. &nbsp;</p><p>The wedding was taking place in Northern California at a\nwinery. &nbsp;The moment you and Chris visited\nlast fall to check out the venue, you fell in love with it just as much as he\ndid. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t going to be that large of\na wedding, only about 150 people total, which when you think of it, with Chris\nbeing a famous actor, it could have been much more. &nbsp;While you had no family here, you knew\neveryone that was going to be in attendance and they all opened their arms to\nyou as part of the family. &nbsp;</p><p>After you hair and makeup were done, you got into your\ndress. &nbsp;Everyone filed out of the room,\ngiving you a minute to yourself before you heard a knock on the door. &nbsp;Lisa popped her head in and stared at you in\nawe. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You look so beautiful sweetheart,&rdquo; she said as she removed\na tear that slid down her cheek. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh Lisa don&rsquo;t cry!&rdquo; you said with a smile as you went to\nhug her. &nbsp;She held you close to her, and\njust like in Chris&rsquo; arms, you felt warmth and love from her. &nbsp;She considered you a daughter the moment she\nmet you; always telling you that you and Chris were destined to be\ntogether. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I know that this must be a difficult time for you\nErica. &nbsp;A big day like this and you don&rsquo;t\nhave the most important woman here with you right now.&rdquo; &nbsp;As she spoke, you nodded your head, willing\nthe tears to not ruin your makeup. &nbsp;&ldquo;And\nI just wanted you to know that I love you just as much as I love my own\nchildren. &nbsp;You make my Chris so happy and\nI&rsquo;m so blessed that you are going to be a part of this family forever.&rdquo; &nbsp;You wrapped your arms around her, clinging\nfor life as her words touched your heart. \nWhen she pulled away from you, she grabbed something from her\npurse. &nbsp;&ldquo;I wanted to give you this so you\ncould wear it. &nbsp;I had it made special for\ntoday.&rdquo;</p><p>She placed a small white box in your palms and you carefully\nopened it. &nbsp;When you saw what it was, you\ngasped; Lisa immediately balling up tissues under your eyes to catch your\ntears. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so beautiful,&rdquo; you whispered. &nbsp;It was a button about the size of a quarter,\nwith your mother&rsquo;s picture on it. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I was thinking we could pin it to the inside of your dress,\nright next to your heart. &nbsp;That way she\nwill be nice and close to you today.&rdquo; \nNodding your head, you held the tissues up to your eyes as she carefully\npinned the button to the inside of your dress. \nYou don&rsquo;t know why, but you instantly felt better, like a weight lifted\noff your shoulder. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;They are ready,&rdquo; Scarlet said from the doorway, standing\nwith Margarita by her side. &nbsp;&ldquo;Do you want\nme to bring in Robert and Sebastian?&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>Lisa quickly helped to make sure your makeup wasn&rsquo;t ruined\nand gave your arms a gentle squeeze. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, bring them in,&rdquo; you spoke softly. &nbsp;You looked down at your dress, smiling. &nbsp;The dress itself was extremely simple. &nbsp;It was white satin with thick straps like a\ntank top. &nbsp;At the waist, there was a\nbeaded diamond belt cinching your waist and then it flared out lightly from\nthere; nowhere near a ball gown flare. \nYou tried those types of dresses on and weren&rsquo;t comfortable at all in\nthem; they were so heavy to move around in. \n</p><p>There was a nother knock on\nthe door and you looked up to see Robert and Sebastian looking rather dapper in\ntheir navy blue tuxes. &nbsp;Their eyes were\nglossy as they took everything in. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not crying, you&rsquo;re\ncrying,&rdquo; he turned and spoke to Sebastian as he sniffled his nose. &nbsp;His remark caused you to giggle and you did a\ntwirl for them. &nbsp;Robert was the frist to\ngreet you, taking your hands in his. &nbsp;&ldquo;You\nmake an absolutley stunning bride Erica.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you Robert. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t look too shabby yourself.&rdquo; &nbsp;He laughed before giving you a kiss on the\ncheek. &nbsp;</p><p>Sebastian was next to greet\nyou and he didn&rsquo;t waste any time putting his arms around your waist and giving\nyou a hug. &nbsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get over how\nbeautiful you look right now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey now, I&rsquo;ll only be second\nbest when it finally comes to your ass marrying Margarita.&rdquo; &nbsp;That got a laugh out of both men in the room. &nbsp;&ldquo;And the best part?&rdquo; you spoke with a\ngleaming smile. &nbsp;You placed your hands\ninside the pockets. &nbsp;&ldquo;It has POCKETS!&rdquo;</p><p>The music began to start and\nRobert handed you your boquet of flowers. \nTrailing behind them, you made your way outside the double doors. &nbsp;Robert and Sebastian stood on either side of\nyou, both giving you warm smiles as you placed one arm around each of\nthem. &nbsp;The three of you walked down the\ncobble sidewalk before stopping. &nbsp;All you\nhad to do was turn left around the building and there Chris would be, waiting\nfor you. &nbsp;</p><p>Looking up at the sky, it was\nthe perfect day for an outside wedding. &nbsp;&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo;\nRobert whispered to you. &nbsp;Giving him a\nnod, the three of you turned the corner as everyone stood up. &nbsp;</p><p>Your eyes instantly landed on\nChris. &nbsp;He had never looked more handsome\nthan in this exact moment. &nbsp;Slowly, the\nthree of you made your way up the aisle; your eyes never leaving Chris&rsquo;. &nbsp;His mouth parted slightly as he got a better\nlook at you, and then you saw him wipe away a tear. &nbsp;Your heart hammered in your chest, just\nwanting to be there next to him. &nbsp;</p><p>Chris walked down the two\nsteps to greet you, taking your hand in his and helped you up the steps. &nbsp;&ldquo;You look so beautiful Erica,&rdquo; he whispered\nto you, making you blush. &nbsp;</p><p>During the wedding, your eyes\nand Chris&rsquo; stayed glued to each-other&rsquo;s. \nYou felt safe with your hands in his; heart full of love. &nbsp;</p><p>It was time for your vows,\nand you both decided to speak from the heart instead of the basic vows that\nmany people do at weddings. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Erica, from the moment I\nmeant you, I knew you were special, even though you weren&rsquo;t mine-yet.&rdquo; &nbsp;There was a chorus of giggles from the\naudience as your eyes peered over at Sebastian&rsquo;s. &nbsp;He was smiling and shaking his head. &nbsp;&ldquo;Throughout the time I got to know you, you\nbecame such a close friend to me and I knew one way or another, you would\nalways be a part of my life and I was happy with that. &nbsp;But then one horrific accident happened and\nsomehow you ended up with me. &nbsp;And then\nanother accident happened earlier this year and I thought I was going to lose\nyou. &nbsp;I thought you would wake up one day\nand think &lsquo;what the hell am I doing with this doofus&rsquo;&rdquo;. &nbsp;Another chorus of laughter erupted. &nbsp;&ldquo;But here you are, still with me. &nbsp;And when you agreed to marry me, it was the\nhappiest moment of my life, until now. &nbsp;I\nlove you so much Erica and I can&rsquo;t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.&rdquo;</p><p>You grabbed the tissue you\nhad been holding, knowing you would need it as you wiped away the tears from\nyour cheeks; not even caring anymore if your makeup was ruined. &nbsp;Chris&rsquo; words made you heart clench with love\nand all you wanted to do was pull him into a searing kiss, but you knew you had\nto wait. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Chris,&rdquo; you began to speak\nwith a shaky voice. &nbsp;&ldquo;Fate has a funny\nway of playing things out. &nbsp;Over the\ncourse of the last few years, I didn&rsquo;t imagine how this would be endgame.&rdquo; &nbsp;Naturally, those who were there that were a\npart of the Avengers movies snickered at your little comment. &nbsp;&ldquo;But I couldn&rsquo;t be more happier. &nbsp;You have fought for me, time and time again\nduring the hardest parts of our relationship. \nIn fact, you had to do it twice. \nAnd that shows me how much dedication you have between us. &nbsp;It shows that you are someone I can lean on\nand trust with my whole heart, knowing you would do anything for me. &nbsp;I am proud to stand next to you today, and to\nbecome your wife.&rdquo;</p><p>Dodger came up to Chris, his\ncolor holding the boxes with your wedding bands in them. &nbsp;The rings were placed on your respected\nfingers; smiles all around. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You may now kiss the bride,&rdquo;\nthe officiant stated. &nbsp;</p><p>Chris&rsquo; large warm hands\ncupped your cheeks, pulling you to him as he placed his lips on yours. &nbsp;Your knees grew weak as you held onto his\narms, never wanting the kiss to end. \nChris pulled away, glancing lovingly into your eyes. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone, please\ncongratulate Mr. and Mrs. Chris Evans!&rdquo; the officiant said. &nbsp;Margarita handed you your flowers and you\ngripped Chris&rsquo; hand as the two of you walked down the aisle together as a\nmarried couple. &nbsp; </p><p>Tag List:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-vGAp5DFUjh-DJa10UdTfA\">@iamthemaskhewears</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-7P3-Sw9RWpGbn5Hx4MI5Q\">@janeyboo</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEFp2lYEPZfxUNkza9hN0Eg\">@trees-and-ink</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJzc50uJqSdLUFXRqSsJB-w\">@nina-bok</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfOj3-VofGUNqc0Iq304JQg\">@geektastic84</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miCK4X7M_2IwmUOnWC6AgXw\">@sarahp879</a> @our-daily-struggle <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXVZGDoySbGQ8Vh_yGF0EcQ\">@nomadicpixel</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMSzB-aY4LfrOBw8cJbeg0g\">@trishevans</a> @be-amazing <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLlHP8S74U3XruLxmsh6tBQ\">@wipplog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muhbhDwz85jaQCL2vvjSymw\">@ashann7</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6vBdmdRGtZWn7vJIREsBOw\">@have-aheart</a>@agambleaway <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPOeZGo5lyCuxR2g6yDdf9Q\">@lizzyclifford13-blog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVwtmzLzpnPVt4qXt9asVOQ\">@lovingquotes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9nHaXHEK2rAR_IE_wt-3Yg\">@titty-teetee</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBb4kX5ZjREpJq2bNqumg4g\">@ajosieface</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7mk2fSXnX5BBSZUlB54H1w\">@ffcsave</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2sGOmRlq8MwFleb1fFMs7Q\">@dottirose</a> @things-i-like-1982 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVHhgkZlxfFmUXjFdQBGwKg\">@sirod-30</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myIG1dSI2kcFSS0i64oU60Q\">@skyewardolicitycloisdelena91</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx92Ca0bmTX9IHcJIKCwOQ\">@patzammit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maRk-wkBYlRixBAo8hWCkjg\">@brastrangled</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGv8r6fJX_2qORMc07jo2VQ\">@miss-cap21</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-B6U87jynWLd9naB5G_dEw\">@pumbibaby</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwBVtWXJkPYvhG69w0u49VQ\">@marvelouslyme96</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcRxn7YLseanjYhB44PCesg\">@kanupps06</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moH2485CD_OzLSWhAudQMjA\">@the-real-kellymonster</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYVvyPBlJuKY24WaTnPPnhQ\">@zohoffman</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPJVwxDeaQzxOgOZH4jTZ3w\">@princess-evans-addict</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLEN1bSPv7F2jO2qK-XqfvQ\">@white-chocolate-mocha-fan</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUq3sPk9lcgG_jXUp6RsRIQ\">@remember-that-one-blog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9gP0gKLqbIcrjDz0T37bBg\">@sincerelyfan</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0E2wFcz7-jjpygcaO4nuSw\">@projectxhappiness</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhvcg66HgRTM7-gI4qWvFvQ\">@libbitinasdeath</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfGDFCWQwdHP6h2bfQLKLqA\">@hispeculiartreasure</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mc2Kb_Y38BjoHk-FIWY7Rlg\">@guera31</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtaWaN_ighiYYScW7vLIC9w\">@ssweet-empowerment</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvRHJPQOLxmyZlKUa6rlO2A\">@sfreeborn</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpmGAEwKsOKtyIgI-c5Ttqg\">@jjlevin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq3cy1j5dCpdq9OpT4x3Ukw\">@badassbaker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5QSam4Ife2TKINrNYibWHA\">@sophiealiice</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEhQ4uSLqpJMdVWi_i75QzA\">@supernatural-girl97</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbMjLzeZOiw097UfkLMIxIw\">@coffeebooksandfandom</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmToUcLU1n388gzQ38anXog\">@esoltis280</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXFYeI57g9SMd7qt-SB_oAg\">@poerebel</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mifWDZ6NIu_ob1sV8Fw0dWQ\">@laochbaineann</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvoHONrlb9zzqCPyqVY9YZA\">@crushed-pink-petals</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbzINLfv17mQRDzuIowmuaA\">@thisismysecrethappyplace</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfBS0BI2T_apEQcN2Elg4vg\">@mrs-captain-evans</a></p></p>",

boyfriend Chris, you go for a drive and get into a\nterrible accident. \u00a0Upon waking up in the\nhospital, you find both Sebastian and Chris sitting there. \u00a0The only problem? \u00a0You have no recent memories and you think you\nare still dating Sebastian.</p><!-- more --><p>You startled awake the following morning. \u00a0Unaware if it was a nightmare, or the cars\nhonking that woke you up, you looked over to see Chris fast asleep next to\nyou. \u00a0Looking down you saw that you were\nstill completely naked as you soon remembered the events that transpired the\nday before. \u00a0</p><p>Lifting the covers off your nude body, you made your way\ninto the bathroom. \u00a0Turning on the light\nyou had to cast your gaze downwards from the brightness. \u00a0Once you relieved yourself of your morning\nduties, you decided to take a shower. \u00a0</p><p>The hot water did wonders on your stressed out body and you\nsoon found yourself dozing off, standing under the nozzle. \u00a0It had been a long and tiring last couple of\ndays ever since you regained your memories. \nYou were unsure if you could make it through these memories; you barely\nsurvived the first time around. \u00a0Your\nlips pressed tightly together and your chin dipped to your chest. \u00a0Without a doubt you were disappointed, both\nin Chris, and with yourself. \u00a0</p><p>It was such an angry emotion to feel, how Chris never told\nyou what happened to your mother. \u00a0But\nyou were also disappointed in yourself for even remotely thinking about how you\nmissed your relationship with Sebastian. \n</p><p>You began to get light headed from all the heat in the\nshower, and not eating anything for over 24 hours. \u00a0Turning the shower off, you opened the door\nand felt an immediate burst of cold air. \nWith your body covered in goosebumps you quickly grabbed the large\nfluffy towel robe that hung on the door. \nWrapping yourself in it, you felt yourself smile at the comfort you\nfelt. \u00a0</p><p>Taking your hand, you wiped off the mist from the mirror and\ntook a good look at yourself. \u00a0Your hair\nhung heavily around your shoulders from the weight of the water; you looked\ntired. \u00a0With a deep sigh you walked to\nthe door and opened it. \u00a0</p><p>There, you saw Chris sitting, now fully clothed in pajama\npants and a black t-shirt, sitting on the bed. \n\u201cYou\u2019re up,\u201d you uttered softly. \u00a0</p><p>He scratched the back of his head as he responded. \u00a0\u201cYeah, I ahh\u2026.I heard you get up to go to the\nbathroom and decided to order us some breakfast. \u00a0It will be here any minute.\u201d</p><p>There was a fluttering in your stomach and you weren\u2019t sure\nif it was from the affection of Chris ordering you breakfast, or nerves from\nthe conversation you knew the two of you were going to have. \u00a0</p><p>It felt as if there was a bit uncertainty in the air, but\nthat was washed away as Chris patted the spot on the bed next to him. \u00a0Shuffling your feet over, you sat down beside\nhim. \u00a0He placed a hand to your back and\nrubbed up and down; soothing your anxiety. \n</p><p>There was a knock on the door and Chris got up to answer\nit. \u00a0Sure enough, it was your breakfast\nand your stomach chose that moment to begin to rumble. \u00a0</p><p>Getting up from the bed you made your way to the small table\nand made yourself comfortable. \u00a0You heard\nChris say a quick \u2018thank you\u2019 to the person who brought the food up and before\nyou knew it, he was wheeling the small cart over to the table. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSmells delicious,\u201d you said, your mouth beginning to\nwater. \u00a0Chris lifted the lids off the\nplates and your eyes grew wide at the sight of all the food. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI figured I would order a bit of everything. \u00a0I wasn\u2019t sure what you were in the mood for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is perfect Chris. \nThank you,\u201d you said while giving him a warm smile. \u00a0</p><p>You began to dish your plate full of scrambled eggs, bacon,\nwaffles and toast while Chris dished his own plate. \u00a0Breakfast was, for the most part, a silent\naffair. \u00a0The two of you too busy eating\nto discuss the events of the last few days. \n</p><p>As you soon became full from breakfast, you pushed your\nplate to the side and took a sip of your orange juice. \u00a0Chris continued to eat and you anxiously\nbounced your leg up and down underneath the table. \u00a0He didn\u2019t seem to notice your anxiousness and\nyou were grateful for that. \u00a0</p><p>Before long, Chris was also finished with his food. \u00a0He wiped his mouth before sitting back in a\nrelaxed position in his chair. \u00a0You\nlooked into his baby blue eyes and your heart began to pound in your chest\nerratically. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Chris began to speak, \u201chow are you doing\u2026with\nregaining your memories and all.\u201d \nLetting out a deep sigh, you turned your gaze to your hands resting in\nyour lap. \u00a0Not even knowing what to say,\nyou gave him a shrug. \u00a0\u201cCome on babe, talk\nto me.\u201d</p><p>You felt your chin begin to quiver and that was all it took\nfor Chris to get up from his chair and make his way over to you. \u00a0He bent down on his knees in front of you,\nturning your body so you were facing him as he gripped you into his arms. \u00a0</p><p>He let you cry into him and you were appreciative. \u00a0The anguish and uncertainty you were feeling\nsoon washed away as Chris kept his tight hold on you. \u00a0You were now feeling nothing but sympathy;\nfor the man you loved so dearly; for everything you had put him through. \u00a0</p><p>Chris put so much of his life on hold to help you get back\non

in.\u201d \nChris brushed the tears from under your eyes with his thumbs. \u00a0He was gentle, just what you needed. \u00a0</p><p>Shaking your head, you tore your gaze from him and down to\nthe floor.

didn\u2019t want to put him\nthrough all this trouble for a second time; it just wasn\u2019t fair to him. \u00a0</p><p>Chris leaned back on his heels as you fought to not look at\nhis gaze. \u00a0You could feel his eyes\npenetrating your soul but you were too terrified to look at him. \u00a0He didn\u2019t say anything. \u00a0The only noise was the hum of the air\nconditioning. \u00a0Although, you thought your\nheart was beating so fast, that Chris would possibly be able to hear it. \u00a0</p><p>You felt a soft grip on your knees as you made the sacrifice\nto look up and right into Chris\u2019

to each cut as another tear\nrolled down your cheek. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cChris,\u201d your voice echoed his as you sniffled back your\ntears. \u00a0</p><p>As his lips stopped with their gentle touch

everything in his power to help you out. \u00a0But for some damn reason you wouldn\u2019t listen\nto him,\u201d he said as you winced at the memory. \n\u201cThen you broke up with him and there I

work.\u201d</p><p>By now your tears were cascaded down your cheeks like a\nwaterfall, but Chris was there to catch them with his thumbs. \u00a0Your heart was pounding in your chest with\nhow delicate

and you think you\nare still dating Sebastian.</p>[[MORE]]<p>You startled awake the following morning. \u00a0Unaware if it was a nightmare, or the cars\nhonking that woke you up, you looked over to see Chris fast asleep next to\nyou. \u00a0Looking down you saw that you were\nstill completely naked as you soon remembered the events that transpired the\nday before. \u00a0</p><p>Lifting the covers off your nude body, you made your way\ninto the bathroom. \u00a0Turning on the light\nyou had to cast your gaze downwards from the brightness. \u00a0Once you relieved yourself of your morning\nduties, you decided to take a shower. \u00a0</p><p>The hot water did wonders on your stressed out body and you\nsoon found yourself dozing off, standing under the nozzle. \u00a0It had been a long and tiring last couple of\ndays ever since you regained your memories. \nYou were unsure if you could make it through these memories; you barely\nsurvived the first time around. \u00a0Your\nlips pressed tightly together and your chin dipped to your chest. \u00a0Without a doubt you were disappointed, both\nin Chris, and with yourself. \u00a0</p><p>It was such an angry emotion to feel, how Chris never told\nyou what happened to your mother. \u00a0But\nyou were also disappointed in yourself for even remotely thinking about how you\nmissed your relationship with Sebastian. \n</p><p>You began to get light headed from all the heat in the\nshower, and not eating anything for over 24 hours. \u00a0Turning the shower off, you opened the door\nand felt an immediate burst of cold air. \nWith your body covered in goosebumps you quickly grabbed the large\nfluffy towel robe that hung on the door. \nWrapping yourself in it, you felt yourself smile at the comfort you\nfelt. \u00a0</p><p>Taking your hand, you wiped off the mist from the mirror and\ntook a good look at yourself. \u00a0Your hair\nhung heavily around your shoulders from the weight of the water; you looked\ntired. \u00a0With a deep sigh you walked to\nthe door and opened it. \u00a0</p><p>There, you saw Chris sitting, now fully clothed in pajama\npants and a black t-shirt, sitting on the bed. \n\u201cYou\u2019re up,\u201d you uttered softly. \u00a0</p><p>He scratched the back of his head as he responded. \u00a0\u201cYeah, I ahh\u2026.I heard you get up to go to the\nbathroom and decided to order us some breakfast. \u00a0It will be here any minute.\u201d</p><p>There was a fluttering in your stomach and you weren\u2019t sure\nif it was from the affection of Chris ordering you breakfast, or nerves from\nthe conversation you knew the two of you were going to have. \u00a0</p><p>It felt as if there was a bit uncertainty in the air, but\nthat was washed away as Chris patted the spot on the bed next to him. \u00a0Shuffling your feet over, you sat down beside\nhim. \u00a0He placed a hand to your back and\nrubbed up and down; soothing your anxiety. \n</p><p>There was a knock on the door and Chris got up to answer\nit. \u00a0Sure enough, it was your breakfast\nand your stomach chose that moment to begin to rumble. \u00a0</p><p>Getting up from the bed you made your way to the small table\nand made yourself comfortable. \u00a0You heard\nChris say a quick \u2018thank you\u2019 to the person who brought the food up and before\nyou knew it, he was wheeling the small cart over to the table. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSmells delicious,\u201d you said, your mouth beginning to\nwater. \u00a0Chris lifted the lids off the\nplates and your eyes grew wide at the sight of all the food. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI figured I would order a bit of everything. \u00a0I wasn\u2019t sure what you were in the mood for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is perfect Chris. \nThank you,\u201d you said while giving him a warm smile. \u00a0</p><p>You began to dish your plate full of scrambled eggs, bacon,\nwaffles and toast while Chris dished his own plate. \u00a0Breakfast was, for the most part, a silent\naffair. \u00a0The two of you too busy eating\nto discuss the events of the last few days. \n</p><p>As you soon became full from breakfast, you pushed your\nplate to the side and took a sip of your orange juice. \u00a0Chris continued to eat and you anxiously\nbounced your leg up and down underneath the table. \u00a0He didn\u2019t seem to notice your anxiousness and\nyou were grateful for that. \u00a0</p><p>Before long, Chris was also finished with his food. \u00a0He wiped his mouth before sitting back in a\nrelaxed position in his chair. \u00a0You\nlooked into his baby blue eyes and your heart began to pound in your chest\nerratically. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Chris began to speak, \u201chow are you doing\u2026with\nregaining your memories and all.\u201d \nLetting out a deep sigh, you turned your gaze to your hands resting in\nyour lap. \u00a0Not even knowing what to say,\nyou gave him a shrug. \u00a0\u201cCome on babe, talk\nto me.\u201d</p><p>You felt your chin begin to quiver and that was all it took\nfor Chris to get up from his chair and make his way over to you. \u00a0He bent down on his knees in front of you,\nturning your body so you were facing him as he gripped you into his arms. \u00a0</p><p>He let you cry into him and you were appreciative. \u00a0The anguish and uncertainty you were feeling\nsoon washed away as Chris kept his tight hold on you. \u00a0You were now feeling nothing but sympathy;\nfor the man you loved so dearly; for everything you had put him through. \u00a0</p><p>Chris put so much of his life on hold to help you get back\non

you go for a drive and get into a\nterrible accident. \u00a0Upon waking up in the\nhospital, you find both Sebastian and Chris sitting there. \u00a0The only problem? \u00a0You have no recent memories and you think you\nare still dating Sebastian.</p>[[MORE]]<p>You startled awake the following morning. \u00a0Unaware if it was a nightmare, or the cars\nhonking that woke you up, you looked over to see Chris fast asleep next to\nyou. \u00a0Looking down you saw that you were\nstill completely naked as you soon remembered the events that transpired the\nday before. \u00a0</p><p>Lifting the covers off your nude body, you made your way\ninto the bathroom. \u00a0Turning on the light\nyou had to cast your gaze downwards from the brightness. \u00a0Once you relieved yourself of your morning\nduties, you decided to take a shower. \u00a0</p><p>The hot water did wonders on your stressed out body and you\nsoon found yourself dozing off, standing under the nozzle. \u00a0It had been a long and tiring last couple of\ndays ever since you regained your memories. \nYou were unsure if you could make it through these memories; you barely\nsurvived the first time around. \u00a0Your\nlips pressed tightly together and your chin dipped to your chest. \u00a0Without a doubt you were disappointed, both\nin Chris, and with yourself. \u00a0</p><p>It was such an angry emotion to feel, how Chris never told\nyou what happened to your mother. \u00a0But\nyou were also disappointed in yourself for even remotely thinking about how you\nmissed your relationship with Sebastian. \n</p><p>You began to get light headed from all the heat in the\nshower, and not eating anything for over 24 hours. \u00a0Turning the shower off, you opened the door\nand felt an immediate burst of cold air. \nWith your body covered in goosebumps you quickly grabbed the large\nfluffy towel robe that hung on the door. \nWrapping yourself in it, you felt yourself smile at the comfort you\nfelt. \u00a0</p><p>Taking your hand, you wiped off the mist from the mirror and\ntook a good look at yourself. \u00a0Your hair\nhung heavily around your shoulders from the weight of the water; you looked\ntired. \u00a0With a deep sigh you walked to\nthe door and opened it. \u00a0</p><p>There, you saw Chris sitting, now fully clothed in pajama\npants and a black t-shirt, sitting on the bed. \n\u201cYou\u2019re up,\u201d you uttered softly. \u00a0</p><p>He scratched the back of his head as he responded. \u00a0\u201cYeah, I ahh\u2026.I heard you get up to go to the\nbathroom and decided to order us some breakfast. \u00a0It will be here any minute.\u201d</p><p>There was a fluttering in your stomach and you weren\u2019t sure\nif it was from the affection of Chris ordering you breakfast, or nerves from\nthe conversation you knew the two of you were going to have. \u00a0</p><p>It felt as if there was a bit uncertainty in the air, but\nthat was washed away as Chris patted the spot on the bed next to him. \u00a0Shuffling your feet over, you sat down beside\nhim. \u00a0He placed a hand to your back and\nrubbed up and down; soothing your anxiety. \n</p><p>There was a knock on the door and Chris got up to answer\nit. \u00a0Sure enough, it was your breakfast\nand your stomach chose that moment to begin to rumble. \u00a0</p><p>Getting up from the bed you made your way to the small table\nand made yourself comfortable. \u00a0You heard\nChris say a quick \u2018thank you\u2019 to the person who brought the food up and before\nyou knew it, he was wheeling the small cart over to the table. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSmells delicious,\u201d you said, your mouth beginning to\nwater. \u00a0Chris lifted the lids off the\nplates and your eyes grew wide at the sight of all the food. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI figured I would order a bit of everything. \u00a0I wasn\u2019t sure what you were in the mood for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is perfect Chris. \nThank you,\u201d you said while giving him a warm smile. \u00a0</p><p>You began to dish your plate full of scrambled eggs, bacon,\nwaffles and toast while Chris dished his own plate. \u00a0Breakfast was, for the most part, a silent\naffair. \u00a0The two of you too busy eating\nto discuss the events of the last few days. \n</p><p>As you soon became full from breakfast, you pushed your\nplate to the side and took a sip of your orange juice. \u00a0Chris continued to eat and you anxiously\nbounced your leg up and down underneath the table. \u00a0He didn\u2019t seem to notice your anxiousness and\nyou were grateful for that. \u00a0</p><p>Before long, Chris was also finished with his food. \u00a0He wiped his mouth before sitting back in a\nrelaxed position in his chair. \u00a0You\nlooked into his baby blue eyes and your heart began to pound in your chest\nerratically. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Chris began to speak, \u201chow are you doing\u2026with\nregaining your memories and all.\u201d \nLetting out a deep sigh, you turned your gaze to your hands resting in\nyour lap. \u00a0Not even knowing what to say,\nyou gave him a shrug. \u00a0\u201cCome on babe, talk\nto me.\u201d</p><p>You felt your chin begin to quiver and that was all it took\nfor Chris to get up from his chair and make his way over to you. \u00a0He bent down on his knees in front of you,\nturning your body so you were facing him as he gripped you into his arms. \u00a0</p><p>He let you cry into him and you were appreciative. \u00a0The anguish and uncertainty you were feeling\nsoon washed away as Chris kept his tight hold on you. \u00a0You were now feeling nothing but sympathy;\nfor the man you loved so dearly; for everything you had put him through. \u00a0</p><p>Chris put so much of his life on hold to help you get back\non track after your mothers\u2019 death, your miscarriage, suicide attempt, and\nleaving Sebastian, that you couldn\u2019t comprehend if he even wanted to go through\nall that again with you. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d his soothing voice broke through your thoughts; you\ndidn\u2019t even realize he had pulled apart from you. \u00a0\u201cErica, talk to me sweetheart. \u00a0Let me in.\u201d \nChris brushed the tears from under your eyes with his thumbs. \u00a0He was gentle, just what you needed. \u00a0</p><p>Shaking your head, you tore your gaze from him and down to\nthe floor. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t want you to have to\ngo through all of this again with me Chris. \nYou deserve better. \u00a0You deserve\nto live your life\u2026and\u2026and not have to deal with me and this mess.\u201d \u00a0It felt as if someone was squeezing your\nheart as you spoke those words to Chris. \nYou clearly didn\u2019t want to break up with him; you loved him, so\nmuch. \u00a0But you didn\u2019t want to put him\nthrough all this trouble for a second time; it just wasn\u2019t fair to him. \u00a0</p><p>Chris leaned back on his heels as you fought to not look at\nhis gaze. \u00a0You could feel his eyes\npenetrating your soul but you were too terrified to look at him. \u00a0He didn\u2019t say anything. \u00a0The only noise was the hum of the air\nconditioning. \u00a0Although, you thought your\nheart was beating so fast, that Chris would possibly be able to hear it. \u00a0</p><p>You felt a soft grip on your knees as you made the sacrifice\nto look up and right into Chris\u2019 blue eyes. \nAll the air left your lungs as you saw the tender way he was gazing at you. \u00a0\u201cErica,\u201d his voice was nearly a whisper as he\nspoke. \u00a0He gently tugged the left sleeve\nof the robe up your arm and you winced at what you saw. \u00a0The small crescent shape cuts on your wrist\nmade by your own nails just the other day. \nChris leaned down, peppering soft kisses to each cut as another tear\nrolled down your cheek. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cChris,\u201d your voice echoed his as you sniffled back your\ntears. \u00a0</p><p>As his lips stopped with their gentle touch against your\nwrist, his eyes met yours. \u00a0You instantly\ngot lost in the ocean blue of them; your heart fluttering at a rapid pace. \u00a0\u201cErica,\u201d Chris softly said your name yet\nagain as his thumbs caressed your cheeks, wiping your tears away. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t want you to have to worry about any\nof that alright? \u00a0When this first happened\nto you, Sebastian tried everything in his power to help you out. \u00a0But for some damn reason you wouldn\u2019t listen\nto him,\u201d he said as you winced at the memory. \n\u201cThen you broke up with him and there I was\u2026.to help pick up the\npieces. \u00a0I honestly don\u2019t know what I did\nany different than him, but you listened to me. \nWe worked through your problems together Erica, and we made it work.\u201d</p><p>By now your tears were cascaded down your cheeks like a\nwaterfall, but Chris was there to catch them with his thumbs. \u00a0Your heart was pounding in your chest with\nhow delicate he was treating you in this moment. \u00a0\u201cBut Chris,\u2026..\u201d you started to say but he cut\nyou off. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n\u201cNo Erica, please listen to me. \u00a0Nothing you say is going to change my mind\nbaby. \u00a0Nothing you say is going to make\nme walk away from this relationship. \u00a0I\nlove you.\u201d \u00a0At those three little words,\nyour heart nearly stopped. \u00a0It was the\nfirst time since you had regained your memories those words were spoken. \u00a0\u201cI love you so much Erica and I will do\nanything to help you through this again. \nIf that means I don\u2019t do a film for two years, then so be it. \u00a0If it means I don\u2019t work another day for the\nrest of my life, then I will do that too. \nYou are the most important person to me in my entire life, and I will\nhelp you through this again, no matter what it takes.\u201d \u00a0\n\n\n\n</p><p style=\"\">Tag List:\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-vGAp5DFUjh-DJa10UdTfA\">@iamthemaskhewears</a>

you looked\ntired. &nbsp;With a deep sigh you walked to\nthe door and opened it. &nbsp;</p><p>There, you saw Chris sitting, now fully clothed in pajama\npants and a black t-shirt, sitting on the bed. \n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re up,&rdquo; you uttered softly. &nbsp;</p><p>He scratched the back of his head as he responded. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, I ahh&hellip;.I heard you get up to go to the\nbathroom and decided to order us some breakfast. &nbsp;It will be here any minute.&rdquo;</p><p>There was a fluttering in your stomach and you weren&rsquo;t sure\nif it was from the affection of Chris ordering you breakfast, or nerves from\nthe conversation you knew the two of you were going to have. &nbsp;</p><p>It felt as if there was a bit uncertainty in the air, but\nthat was washed away as Chris patted the spot on the bed next to him. &nbsp;Shuffling your feet over, you sat down beside\nhim. &nbsp;He placed a hand to your back and\nrubbed up and down; soothing your anxiety. \n</p><p>There was a knock on the door and Chris got up to answer\nit. &nbsp;Sure enough, it was your breakfast\nand your stomach chose that moment to begin to rumble. &nbsp;</p><p>Getting up from the bed you made your way to the small table\nand made yourself comfortable. &nbsp;You heard\nChris say a quick &lsquo;thank you&rsquo; to the person who brought the food up and before\nyou knew it, he was wheeling the small cart over to the table. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Smells delicious,&rdquo; you said, your mouth beginning to\nwater. &nbsp;Chris lifted the lids off the\nplates and your eyes grew wide at the sight of all the food. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I figured I would order a bit of everything. &nbsp;I wasn&rsquo;t sure what you were in the mood for.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This is perfect Chris. \nThank you,&rdquo; you said while giving him a warm smile. &nbsp;</p><p>You began to dish your plate full of scrambled eggs, bacon,\nwaffles and toast while Chris dished his own plate. &nbsp;Breakfast was, for the most part, a silent\naffair. &nbsp;The two of you too busy eating\nto discuss the events of the last few days. \n</p><p>As you soon became full from breakfast, you pushed your\nplate to the side and took a sip of your orange juice. &nbsp;Chris continued to eat and you anxiously\nbounced your leg up and down underneath the table. &nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t seem to notice your anxiousness and\nyou were grateful for that. &nbsp;</p><p>Before long, Chris was also finished with his food. &nbsp;He wiped his mouth before sitting back in a\nrelaxed position in his chair. &nbsp;You\nlooked into his baby blue eyes and your heart began to pound in your chest\nerratically. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Chris began to speak, &ldquo;how are you doing&hellip;with\nregaining your memories and all.&rdquo; \nLetting out a deep sigh, you turned your gaze to your hands resting in\nyour lap. &nbsp;Not even knowing what to say,\nyou gave him a shrug. &nbsp;&ldquo;Come on babe, talk\nto me.&rdquo;</p><p>You felt your chin begin to quiver and that was all it took\nfor Chris to get up from his chair and make his way over to you. &nbsp;He bent down on his knees in front of you,\nturning your body so you were facing him as he gripped you into his arms. &nbsp;</p><p>He let you cry into him and you were appreciative. &nbsp;The anguish and uncertainty you were feeling\nsoon washed away as Chris kept his tight hold on you. &nbsp;You were now feeling nothing but sympathy;\nfor the man you loved so dearly; for everything you had put him through. &nbsp;</p><p>Chris put so much of his life on hold to help you get back\non track after your mothers&rsquo; death, your miscarriage, suicide attempt, and\nleaving Sebastian, that you couldn&rsquo;t comprehend if he even wanted to go through\nall that again with you. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; his soothing voice broke through your thoughts; you\ndidn&rsquo;t even realize he had pulled apart from you. &nbsp;&ldquo;Erica, talk to me sweetheart. &nbsp;Let me in.&rdquo; \nChris brushed the tears from under your eyes with his thumbs. &nbsp;He was gentle, just what you needed. &nbsp;</p><p>Shaking your head, you tore your gaze from him and down to\nthe floor. &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to have to\ngo through all of this again with me Chris. \nYou deserve better. &nbsp;You deserve\nto live your life&hellip;and&hellip;and not have to deal with me and this mess.&rdquo; &nbsp;It felt as if someone was squeezing your\nheart as you spoke those words to Chris. \nYou clearly didn&rsquo;t want to break up with him; you loved him, so\nmuch. &nbsp;But you didn&rsquo;t want to put him\nthrough all this trouble for a second time; it just wasn&rsquo;t fair to him. &nbsp;</p><p>Chris leaned back on his heels as you fought to not look at\nhis gaze. &nbsp;You could feel his eyes\npenetrating your soul but you were too terrified to look at him. &nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t say anything. &nbsp;The only noise was the hum of the air\nconditioning. &nbsp;Although, you thought your\nheart was beating so fast, that Chris would possibly be able to hear it. &nbsp;</p><p>You felt a soft grip on your knees as you made the sacrifice\nto look up and right into Chris&rsquo; blue eyes. \nAll the air left your lungs as you saw the tender way he was gazing at you. &nbsp;&ldquo;Erica,&rdquo; his voice was nearly a whisper as he\nspoke. &nbsp;He gently tugged the left sleeve\nof the robe up your arm and you winced at what you saw. &nbsp;The small crescent shape cuts on your wrist\nmade by your own nails just the other day. \nChris leaned down, peppering soft kisses to each cut as another tear\nrolled down your cheek. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Chris,&rdquo; your voice echoed his as you sniffled back your\ntears. &nbsp;</p><p>As his lips stopped with their gentle touch against your\nwrist, his eyes met yours. &nbsp;You instantly\ngot lost in the ocean blue of them; your heart fluttering at a rapid pace. &nbsp;&ldquo;Erica,&rdquo; Chris softly said your name yet\nagain as his thumbs caressed your cheeks, wiping your tears away. &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to have to worry about any\nof that alright? &nbsp;When this first happened\nto you, Sebastian tried everything in his power to help you out. &nbsp;But for some damn reason you wouldn&rsquo;t listen\nto him,&rdquo; he said as you winced at the memory. \n&ldquo;Then you broke up with him and there I was&hellip;.to help pick up the\npieces. &nbsp;I honestly don&rsquo;t know what I did\nany different than him, but you listened to me. \nWe worked through your problems together Erica, and we made it work.&rdquo;</p><p>By now your tears were cascaded down your cheeks like a\nwaterfall, but Chris was there to catch them with his thumbs. &nbsp;Your heart was pounding in your chest with\nhow delicate he was treating you in this moment. &nbsp;&ldquo;But Chris,&hellip;..&rdquo; you started to say but he cut\nyou off. &nbsp;</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;No Erica, please listen to me. &nbsp;Nothing you say is going to change my mind\nbaby. &nbsp;Nothing you say is going to make\nme walk away from this relationship. &nbsp;I\nlove you.&rdquo; &nbsp;At those three little words,\nyour heart nearly stopped. &nbsp;It was the\nfirst time since you had regained your memories those words were spoken. &nbsp;&ldquo;I love you so much Erica and I will do\nanything to help you through this again. \nIf that means I don&rsquo;t do a film for two years, then so be it. &nbsp;If it means I don&rsquo;t work another day for the\nrest of my life, then I will do that too. \nYou are the most important person to me in my entire life, and I will\nhelp you through this again, no matter what it takes.&rdquo;

But there\u2019s been a rumor passed along that you two are past that. That you\u2019ve become involved in an\u2026 another way.\u201d </p><p>You don\u2019t answer him this time. He\u2019s only heard rumors, but who told him those rumors? And who started those rumors? Was it your guy\u2019s class after that awful, awkward moment on Tuesday, or had someone seen you two? </p><p>\u201cLook, if anything has happened between you two, I don\u2019t blame you. Chris is a loveable, caring, handsome man. But if you two have a physical or romantic relationship, I need to know. I can\u2019t protect either of your positions here if I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking you myself. I need you to tell me what\u2019s going on between you two.\u201d</p><p>You weigh your options for a moment, dropping your focus to the edge of your notebook, picking at the frayed edge of it. If someone saw you two, there\u2019s no use in lying. Keeping your job by being honest makes sense, and that way neither of you get hurt. But the precedent for TAs and professors having public relationships was almost nonexistent. And normally in these situations, one of you had to lose your job. </p><p>\u201cAnd if I have this wrong, tell me (Y/N),\u201d Robert continues. \u201cIf Chris has pressured you, or forced himself on you, this is a safe space. I can help you. I\u2019d really like it if you\u2019d let me help you.\u201d</p><p>You take a deep breath and settle on your path. A life without Chris doesn\u2019t feel like it would be a life at all. You have to protect both of you. </p><p>\u201cNo no, Robert. Nothing like that has happened. Chris is nothing but a gentleman.\u201d You look up at him and visibly see his relief. \u201cBut I, I\u2019ve flirted with him a couple times. I knew it was wrong. He\u2019s such a nice guy and spending so much time around him has made me like him a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s completely understandable,\u201d he nods. Good. He\u2019s buying it.</p><p>\u201cChris never really responded to me. He\u2019s never compromised his professional position. I was the one who fucked up, and I\u2019m so sorry I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Flirtation, although unprofessional, is not against school rules. And coming clean to me means you know that you can\u2019t go any further.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fully aware. I\u2019d hoped that no one would find out since it hasn\u2019t affected our working relationship at all, but that was naive of me. I understand if you have to pull me from his class.\u201d</p><p>\u201c(Y/N),\u201d Robert sighs, \u201cif I had to pull every teacher or grad student that flirted with each other from classes in this department, most of the English faculty wouldn\u2019t have jobs.\u201d The comforting smirk he gives you helps your heart rate slow. \u201cAs long as nothing else transpires after this conversation, you\u2019ve done absolutely nothing wrong.\u201d</p><p>Your heart rate stops beating in your ears, but you can\u2019t stop your mind from reeling. If only Robert actually knew how many wrongs you two had committed.</p><p>You nod as he lets out a deep sigh and leans back into his chair. \u201cGood,\u201d he gives you an easy grin. \u201cNow back to how we\u2019re getting your story published.\u201d</p><hr><p>You leave Robert\u2019s office 20 minutes later, a list of edit suggestions and recommended publications in your bag. And your head is a mess.</p><p>No matter how easy it had been to convince Robert that there was nothing going on between you and Chris, it still clawed at the back of your mind. He\u2019d said it was a rumor, but who passes rumors onto Department Chairs? We certainly didn\u2019t share any students with Robert. Chris and I worked with mostly first or second year students, and Robert almost exclusively taught higher level capstone classes or graduate level seminars.</p><p>So then he must have heard it from inside the department. Another TA? Elizabeth had been drunk that night, but she may have remembered what she\u2019d seen. But you knew that didn\u2019t feel right in your gut. She\u2019d pretty much encouraged the affair, she wouldn\u2019t rat.</p><p>Or could it be another professor? The chances were higher that they\u2019d seen you with him at the office. </p><p>But something else nagged at you. Your intuition told you that whoever it was, they were closer to one of you than just a coworker.</p><p>As you step out the front doors and onto the tall stairs, the gray sky nearly blinds you in its fluorescence. Your fingers remain knotted tightly around your bag as you squint to see the cement.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)!\u201d a voice calls, friendly and familiar from somewhere close by.</p><p>It\u2019s Sebastian in a dark blue blazer, and his somehow brighter than the sky blue eyes are intently watching you. </p><p>\u201cSebastian,\u201d you smirk, and try not to get caught on the way his scruff softens his face.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you walking?\u201d he asks, his pace falling in line with yours.</p><p>\u201cTo my car, my day\u2019s over,\u201d you say as he continues down the sidewalk with you.</p><p>\u201cGood, I\u2019ll walk with you,\u201d he grins. \u201cSo how has your writing been going? I know Robert never stops gushing about how excited he is to have you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going, but barely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour first year of grad can be difficult, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019re doing great.\u201d You try not to stare at Sebastian in the late overcast afternoon, the soft yet stark lighting making his eyes seem crystal-like. His scruff makes him even more handsome, giving him a slight edge to his charming playboy grin. \u201cChris has been pretty helpful, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than I expected.\u201d If only he knew how helpful he actually was.</p><p>His eyes watch you as a sly smile turns his charm into cockiness, \u201cYour extracurricular time together must be quite beneficial?\u201d</p><p>You stop in your tracks. Does he now?</p><p>Your mind immediately flashing to the exchange you two had in the hallway that day after you and Chris fucked in the supply closet? The way he winked.</p><p>He knew.</p><p>Sebastian keeps walking for another couple steps before he realizes you\u2019re not with him, \u201c(Y/N)?\u201d</p><p>You grab his arm and yank him off the sidewalk. The closest building to your path is made of old grey stones, and has a corner that juts out to cover an emergency exit. You push Sebastian against the wall, your eyes blazing. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d </p><p>Sebastian raises his hands defensively, but his eyes are playful. \u201cAh, I\u2019m not saying anything!\u201d A shit eating grin tells you he\u2019s lying.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Chris has been pretty unavailable in recent weekends. And I\u2019ve read a few of his new pages. They\u2019re quite good.\u201d </p><p>You glare at him. None of that confirms that you two are together. None of that proves anything at all. Did you just blow this with your paranoia?</p><p>\u201cCut the bullshit,\u201d you whisper as you poke him in the chest, hoping he was just playing games with you.</p><p>He drops his hands and sighs, \u201cHe always writes better when he\u2019s happy between a set of thighs.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy do you think I\u2019m the one sleeping with him?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBecause I know Chris, I know how he looked at you at the Department party. All those puppy eyes and the badly concealed jealousy when I flirted with you. It was clear he wasn\u2019t going to let me anywhere near you because he wasn\u2019t giving up on you two.\u201d</p><p>You step back, your eyes closing in concentration. Had Chris really been set on being with you all that time ago? And had Sebastian really been as interested as Elizabeth had guessed? While there was something nice about the idea that Chris knew how he felt about you even then, it didn\u2019t stop that anger from boiling inside you at Sebastian\u2019s statement that Chris wouldn\u2019t let him get close to you.</p><p>\u201cI-, I\u2019m not something either of you could lay claim to. Only I decide who gets to be with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey- hey, I get it. You\u2019re in charge of your own body, I just meant that Chris tried to squash my interest in you. It might have just been him looking out for you then. But I think it\u2019s clear now that he\u2019s not just hung up on the sex. He actually likes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he likes me. But our relationship is private. It\u2019s no one\u2019s business but our own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d he nods, his hands sinking into his pockets, his shoulders hunching up. \u201cAnd he\u2019s my best friend, I\u2019m not trying to violate his personal life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you didn\u2019t tell Robert about us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, Robert knows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s a no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, God no,\u201d he shook his head immediately, his dark hair bouncing, \u201cI would never. Have you told Chris?\u201d</p><p>We shuffled back to the sidewalk together, adding another foot of space between us, now that I\u2019d just thrown him against a wall.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. And Robert doesn\u2019t really know anything. He called it a \u2018rumor\u2019, and I talked him out of thinking the rumor was anything serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRumor feels like something Robert would use when talking about students.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might be right.\u201d</p><p>We reach the parking lot as he turns around to look at me. He cocks his head to the side, a smug smirk wrinkling up his nose.</p><p>\u201cI usually am.\u201d</p><hr><p>2 missed calls from (Y/N) pop up on Chris\u2019s phone as he pushes out from his desk, his laptop folded in his hands. No messages appear. </p><p>His stomach growls, encouraging him to finish packing his things to go. He\u2019ll call you back on his way home. </p><p>He tucks his things into his bag and throws it over his shoulder before he flicks off the lights. The lock engages behind him as he hesitantly slips his phone into his pocket. The rest of the office doors are closed, and only a crack of light bleeds out from under one the doors opposite Chris\u2019s own office. </p><p>Letitia, the grad student that teaches freshman Composition with Elizabeth, has that office. Chris thought he\u2019d only spoken with her once at the faculty dinner last year. And he was pretty sure she hadn\u2019t been in attendance this year. But he\u2019d been dealing with enough shit in his own life, he might have missed her.</p><p>He moved towards the department entrance, his mind already wondering why you\u2019d been calling him. And if it was important, you\u2019d text him or leave a message, right?</p><p>Chris\u2019s feet bounce down the wooden stairs, the creaks of age bidding him a good night. As he makes it to the front door, he notices a figure leaning on the stones outside the door.</p><p>He pushes through carefully to find Robert on the other side, his phone pressed to his ear. The setting sun had just barely managed to escape the dense clouds for the evening, turning his cream colored shirt into a soft peach shade.</p><p>\u201cSusan, all of that sounds lovely, but we actually have to get on a plane to get there-\u201d the moment Robert notices Chris his voice lowers. \u201cI\u2019ll be home soon, we\u2019ll figure it out then.\u201d Chris gives him a sympathetic smirk and continues down the concrete stairs.</p><p>Footfall follows him as Robert calls out, \u201cHey Chris.\u201d</p><p>He stops at the bottom steps, looking over his shoulder, \u201cRobert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk while we walk.\u201d</p><p>Once their steps fall in line, the men head down the sidewalk. The rest of the campus is quiet around them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going out of town for Thanksgiving, right?\u201d Chris asks Robert, thinking about the phone conversation he\u2019d just heard.</p><p>\u201cYes, Illinois,\u201d Robert pauses as he watches Chris, his eyes narrowing. \u201cAnd what are you and Jennifer doing for the holiday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh uh, nothing this year.\u201d Chris\u2019s cheeks show a slight tint of red. \u201cI thought you knew-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I was just hoping that you two had worked it out already.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, we haven\u2019t. And I don\u2019t know if we will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to spend the holiday with (Y/N)?\u201d</p><p>Chris\u2019s breath catches in his throat, panic seizing his heart. He tries to pretend this isn\u2019t happening, \u201cNo. Why would you ask that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, there\u2019s just been some rumors about you two going around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat rumors?\u201d Chris\u2019s heels scuff against the cement as he slows down.</p><p>\u201cYou know, that you two are physically involved,\u201d the look Robert gives him is completely suspicious.</p><p>\u201cWe-, we\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what she said when I asked her.\u201d Chris\u2019s feet nearly stop. (Y/N)\u2019s calls had to be about this. \u201cShe told me it was just a misplaced flirtation on her part and that nothing more was happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d Chris says, but his face almost betrays him. His eyes look distant, hurt, as he tries to hold Robert\u2019s gaze, his hands tucked in his pockets. Robert\u2019s wariness disappears as he watches him, replaced with a deeper concern, whether it\u2019s for Chris or (Y/N) is unclear. \u201cWe get along really well, and have grown closer than I have to any other TA. But nothing\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>Chris drops his gaze to ground, remembering how he told (Y/N) that he\u2019s resign if her job ever was ever on the line. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy you two like each other. I think it\u2019s been a beneficial time for both of you,\u201d Robert answers. \u201cAnd if your relationship becomes more, that\u2019s fine in the future, when she\u2019s not your TA. If you\u2019re not her teacher or her supervisor, I can protect you two. But this isn\u2019t the time for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that Robert,\u201d Chris nods. The men step into the parking lot. </p><p>\u201cGood, because I\u2019m choosing to believe you two right now. But I know you Chris, I know you\u2019re going through some shit right now. But sleeping with your TA isn\u2019t going to fix your marriage, or your pain. And (Y/N) doesn\u2019t deserve that either.\u201d </p><p>Robert unlocks his car as Chris opens his front door, watching Robert walk away. </p><p>Robert turns on his heels, walking backwards, and adds, \u201cBut if somehow the board finds out that something has happened, and this isn\u2019t just a rumor I can talk them out of. I\u2019m not going to protect you, or your job.\u201d</p><p>As Robert disappears into his vehicle, Chris sinks down into his front seat, his keys hanging in his hand. He was right, (Y/N) deserved better than being treated like a secret affair. Which is why he was trying to get a divorce. But Jennifer was still being resistant. She wanted to meet in person to discuss the divorce papers. She wanted to see him this weekend to talk. And (Y/N) didn\u2019t deserve to have to wait around for him to be fully available either.</p><p>Sure, classes would end in a month, but how long with the divorce proceedings go on if Jennifer fought? Would she drag (Y/N) up to the school board? Or in court? No matter how much he loves you, he knows this isn\u2019t the relationship you deserve.</p><p>Chris finally made himself move, sitting in his car wouldn\u2019t fix any of his problems. </p><p>On his way home, (Y/N) called again. He let it ring.</p><hr><p>Chris calls you back around 10 pm. Much later than you expected. </p><p>You answer the phone immediately, \u201cChris, hi-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d Your heart drops. You reach out for the wall, your body needing support. His voice is clear and serious, and it feels heavy, like his words are breaking as they hit your skin. \u201cRobert talk-\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you know?\u201d you cut him off. </p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Your fear eases, no longer squeezing your chest.</p><p>\u201cI told him nothing has happened. We should be okay.\u201d You want to be relieved, but your mind won\u2019t let yourself feel that yet.</p><p>\u201cI know. But Robert knows me. He knows I care about you, hell, he practically confirmed that he knows about us. But he\u2019s giving us the benefit of the doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good Chris. We\u2019ll be okay.\u201d You shut your eyes, praying this was the end of this conversation. You\u2019d be more careful moving forward. And once the semester was over and Jennifer signed the papers, you two could be open.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great that he\u2019s not going to report anything, but we can\u2019t keep sneaking around. Not while you\u2019re my TA. Now that he knows, he\u2019ll be keeping an eye on us.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay, so we\u2019ll just see each other at our apartments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, (Y/N). We need to slow down. Put some distance between us.\u201d</p><p>You grow quiet. You\u2019re on the ground now, somehow. You feel like you\u2019re not even in your body. Your heart isn\u2019t in your body anymore either. It\u2019s lying on the floor in front of you, bleeding out on your carpet. Your eyes grow hot as water builds behind your lids.</p><p>\u201cBut I-\u201d your voice cracks, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, but that doesn\u2019t change our situation. We have to cool off for a while. It\u2019ll be safer that way. Less rumors, less at stake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris.\u201d It comes out as a whimper. Less at stake. Less at stake for yours jobs maybe, but not for your sanity. How would you see him in class, in the office, and not look at him like he was your entire heart? How could you pretend that you were just friends?</p><p>He whispers, \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Your tears run hot against your cheeks. They pelt your chest, burning like alcohol on an open wound.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight,\u201d he manages. The line disconnects. </p><p>You\u2019re left on your floor, your phone in your hands, and your heart broken in front of you.</p><hr><p>Tags: <b><a></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPmxnZde-fg7tw7ky6gmUaA\">@goosedanvers</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms2iAaiOXeITB14P7u2itnQ\">@irishdancr24</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBV4Dh6Sy_nPwLintx3PRHQ\">@lostboyinneverland</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXil-zH28iNClTS9UNyaAzA\">@suz-123</a></b>\u00a0<b>@</b><strike>funlizzie02</strike><b>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_YBoTKnxLeikp-LyTINIQA\">@void-imaginations</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mk6cJg51wMHUsdSFwRHhXjg\">@cryingovershipsthatneversailed</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHN056I_D8ekQ8kZ7Y4zCVQ\">@breezykpop</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGAnchA7bVQWLX-zuK7xlEA\">@jcc04220</a></b>\u00a0<b><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbe29vW7LW2QdFTGx-XIrJg\">@nys30</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJlGLy5YJ1B6-QjvG9BJWwA\">@jonsnowisnotdeadthough</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mc2Kb_Y38BjoHk-FIWY7Rlg\">@guera31</a></b>\u00a0<b>@</b><strike>wickedcitywitch</strike><b>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m84X-u_yvvO8lY_MkNSRnjw\">@thelondondreamer5</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx92Ca0bmTX9IHcJIKCwOQ\">@patzammit</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvFEAzWXUrcNrMxyFoephgw\">@talannalew</a>\u00a0 <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5QwZUs380DEO8Ypngrzz2g\">@lilypalmer1987</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/msBuzj-ERhp_ZtEJjnOuhOA\">@supperunnatural20</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIraWWEgQJERO-bKhOux7iA\">@evanstanfanatic</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5yUTtKOlluGmCPdwFcoZKA\">@lucinapomona</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mz072gPtKVYwpIUB7wPNRcg\">@r5rocks101</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mL_C0ZJJB5Fn24BzDlsD47Q\">@dolphinpink310</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhvdBDnM3eWuNSTqMFUZaaQ\">@bojabee</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRwckLALJgD_Tk-PtM1IMDA\">@youtheheckisbucky</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbgCK4NETm23uYtIEABN6-A\">@thefridgeismybestie</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtaWaN_ighiYYScW7vLIC9w\">@ssweet-empowerment</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5QSam4Ife2TKINrNYibWHA\">@sophiealiice</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOzGcSgnu5XxsbPZ6LOxzUg\">@lostxsea</a></b></p>",

Clearly, he\u2019s not sure how to address this situation. And the panic shooting through your whole body tries to throw you into admitting. Luckily, your logic takes over as you clutch your notebook tightly between your fingers and put on an earnest face.</p><p>\u201cI mean, yes. We\u2019ve become friends over the semester. We\u2019ve spent time outside of class together. He\u2019s helped me with my writing.\u201d And a lot more but you can\u2019t say that. Not until you know exactly what Robert knows.</p><p>\u201cA friendly relationship, even a mentor/mentoree relationship is absolutely fine. But there\u2019s been a rumor passed along that you two are past that. That you\u2019ve become involved in an\u2026 another way.\u201d </p><p>You don\u2019t answer him this time. He\u2019s only heard rumors, but who told him those rumors? And who started those rumors? Was it your guy\u2019s class after that awful, awkward moment on Tuesday, or had someone seen you two? </p><p>\u201cLook, if anything has happened between you two, I don\u2019t blame you. Chris is a loveable, caring, handsome man. But if you two have a physical or romantic relationship, I need to know. I can\u2019t protect either of your positions here if I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking you myself. I need you to tell me what\u2019s going on between you two.\u201d</p><p>You weigh your options for a moment, dropping your focus to the edge of your notebook, picking at the frayed edge of it. If someone saw you two, there\u2019s no use in lying. Keeping your job by being honest makes sense, and that way neither of you get hurt. But the precedent for TAs and professors having public relationships was almost nonexistent. And normally in these situations, one of you had to lose your job. </p><p>\u201cAnd if I have this wrong, tell me (Y/N),\u201d Robert continues. \u201cIf Chris has pressured you, or forced himself on you, this is a safe space. I can help you. I\u2019d really like it if you\u2019d let me help you.\u201d</p><p>You take a deep breath and settle on your path. A life without Chris doesn\u2019t feel like it would be a life at all. You have to protect both of you. </p><p>\u201cNo no, Robert. Nothing like that has happened. Chris is nothing but a gentleman.\u201d You look up at him and visibly see his relief. \u201cBut I, I\u2019ve flirted with him a couple times. I knew it was wrong. He\u2019s such a nice guy and spending so much time around him has made me like him a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s completely understandable,\u201d he nods. Good. He\u2019s buying it.</p><p>\u201cChris never really responded to me. He\u2019s never compromised his professional position. I was the one who fucked up, and I\u2019m so sorry I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Flirtation, although unprofessional, is not against school rules. And coming clean to me means you know that you can\u2019t go any further.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fully aware. I\u2019d hoped that no one would find out since it hasn\u2019t affected our working relationship at all, but that was naive of me. I understand if you have to pull me from his class.\u201d</p><p>\u201c(Y/N),\u201d Robert sighs, \u201cif I had to pull every teacher or grad student that flirted with each other from classes in this department, most of the English faculty wouldn\u2019t have jobs.\u201d The comforting smirk he gives you helps your heart rate slow. \u201cAs long as nothing else transpires after this conversation, you\u2019ve done absolutely nothing wrong.\u201d</p><p>Your heart rate stops beating in your ears, but you can\u2019t stop your mind from reeling. If only Robert actually knew how many wrongs you two had committed.</p><p>You nod as he lets out a deep sigh and leans back into his chair. \u201cGood,\u201d he gives you an easy grin. \u201cNow back to how we\u2019re getting your story published.\u201d</p><hr><p>You leave Robert\u2019s office 20 minutes later, a list of edit suggestions and recommended publications in your bag. And your head is a mess.</p><p>No matter how easy it had been to convince Robert that there was nothing going on between you and Chris, it still clawed at the back of your mind. He\u2019d said it was a rumor, but who passes rumors onto Department Chairs? We certainly didn\u2019t share any students with Robert. Chris and I worked with mostly first or second year students, and Robert almost exclusively taught higher level capstone classes or graduate level seminars.</p><p>So then he must have heard it from inside the department. Another TA? Elizabeth had been drunk that night, but she may have remembered what she\u2019d seen. But you knew that didn\u2019t feel right in your gut. She\u2019d pretty much encouraged the affair, she wouldn\u2019t rat.</p><p>Or could it be another professor? The chances were higher that they\u2019d seen you with him at the office. </p><p>But something else nagged at you. Your intuition told you that whoever it was, they were closer to one of you than just a coworker.</p><p>As you step out the front doors and onto the tall stairs, the gray sky nearly blinds you in its fluorescence. Your fingers remain knotted tightly around your bag as you squint to see the cement.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)!\u201d a voice calls, friendly and familiar from somewhere close by.</p><p>It\u2019s Sebastian in a dark blue blazer, and his somehow brighter than the sky blue eyes are intently watching you. </p><p>\u201cSebastian,\u201d you smirk, and try not to get caught on the way his scruff softens his face.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you walking?\u201d he asks, his pace falling in line with yours.</p><p>\u201cTo my car, my day\u2019s over,\u201d you say as he continues down the sidewalk with you.</p><p>\u201cGood, I\u2019ll walk with you,\u201d he grins. \u201cSo how has your writing been going? I know Robert never stops gushing about how excited he is to have you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going, but barely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour first year of grad can be difficult, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019re doing great.\u201d You try not to stare at Sebastian in the late overcast afternoon, the soft yet stark lighting making his eyes seem crystal-like. His scruff makes him even more handsome, giving him a slight edge to his charming playboy grin. \u201cChris has been pretty helpful, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than I expected.\u201d If only he knew how helpful he actually was.</p><p>His eyes watch you as a sly smile turns his charm into cockiness, \u201cYour extracurricular time together must be quite beneficial?\u201d</p><p>You stop in your tracks. Does he now?</p><p>Your mind immediately flashing to the exchange you two had in the hallway that day after you and Chris fucked in the supply closet? The way he winked.</p><p>He knew.</p><p>Sebastian keeps walking for another couple steps before he realizes you\u2019re not with him, \u201c(Y/N)?\u201d</p><p>You grab his arm and yank him off the sidewalk. The closest building to your path is made of old grey stones, and has a corner that juts out to cover an emergency exit. You push Sebastian against the wall, your eyes blazing. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d </p><p>Sebastian raises his hands defensively, but his eyes are playful. \u201cAh, I\u2019m not saying anything!\u201d A shit eating grin tells you he\u2019s lying.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Chris has been pretty unavailable in recent weekends. And I\u2019ve read a few of his new pages. They\u2019re quite good.\u201d </p><p>You glare at him. None of that confirms that you two are together. None of that proves anything at all. Did you just blow this with your paranoia?</p><p>\u201cCut the bullshit,\u201d you whisper as you poke him in the chest, hoping he was just playing games with you.</p><p>He drops his hands and sighs, \u201cHe always writes better when he\u2019s happy between a set of thighs.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy do you think I\u2019m the one sleeping with him?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBecause I know Chris, I know how he looked at you at the Department party. All those puppy eyes and the badly concealed jealousy when I flirted with you. It was clear he wasn\u2019t going to let me anywhere near you because he wasn\u2019t giving up on you two.\u201d</p><p>You step back, your eyes closing in concentration. Had Chris really been set on being with you all that time ago? And had Sebastian really been as interested as Elizabeth had guessed? While there was something nice about the idea that Chris knew how he felt about you even then, it didn\u2019t stop that anger from boiling inside you at Sebastian\u2019s statement that Chris wouldn\u2019t let him get close to you.</p><p>\u201cI-, I\u2019m not something either of you could lay claim to. Only I decide who gets to be with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey- hey, I get it. You\u2019re in charge of your own body, I just meant that Chris tried to squash my interest in you. It might have just been him looking out for you then. But I think it\u2019s clear now that he\u2019s not just hung up on the sex. He actually likes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he likes me. But our relationship is private. It\u2019s no one\u2019s business but our own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d he nods, his hands sinking into his pockets, his shoulders hunching up. \u201cAnd he\u2019s my best friend, I\u2019m not trying to violate his personal life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you didn\u2019t tell Robert about us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, Robert knows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s a no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, God no,\u201d he shook his head immediately, his dark hair bouncing, \u201cI would never. Have you told Chris?\u201d</p><p>We shuffled back to the sidewalk together, adding another foot of space between us, now that I\u2019d just thrown him against a wall.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. And Robert doesn\u2019t really know anything. He called it a \u2018rumor\u2019, and I talked him out of thinking the rumor was anything serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRumor feels like something Robert would use when talking about students.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might be right.\u201d</p><p>We reach the parking lot as he turns around to look at me. He cocks his head to the side, a smug smirk wrinkling up his nose.</p><p>\u201cI usually am.\u201d</p><hr><p>2 missed calls from (Y/N) pop up on Chris\u2019s phone as he pushes out from his desk, his laptop folded in his hands. No messages appear. </p><p>His stomach growls, encouraging him to finish packing his things to go. He\u2019ll call you back on his way home. </p><p>He tucks his things into his bag and throws it over his shoulder before he flicks off the lights. The lock engages behind him as he hesitantly slips his phone into his pocket. The rest of the office doors are closed, and only a crack of light bleeds out from under one the doors opposite Chris\u2019s own office. </p><p>Letitia, the grad student that teaches freshman Composition with Elizabeth, has that office. Chris thought he\u2019d only spoken with her once at the faculty dinner last year. And he was pretty sure she hadn\u2019t been in attendance this year. But he\u2019d been dealing with enough shit in his own life, he might have missed her.</p><p>He moved towards the department entrance, his mind already wondering why you\u2019d been calling him. And if it was important, you\u2019d text him or leave a message, right?</p><p>Chris\u2019s feet bounce down the wooden stairs, the creaks of age bidding him a good night. As he makes it to the front door, he notices a figure leaning on the stones outside the door.</p><p>He pushes through carefully to find Robert on the other side, his phone pressed to his ear. The setting sun had just barely managed to escape the dense clouds for the evening, turning his cream colored shirt into a soft peach shade.</p><p>\u201cSusan, all of that sounds lovely, but we actually have to get on a plane to get there-\u201d the moment Robert notices Chris his voice lowers. \u201cI\u2019ll be home soon, we\u2019ll figure it out then.\u201d Chris gives him a sympathetic smirk and continues down the concrete stairs.</p><p>Footfall follows him as Robert calls out, \u201cHey Chris.\u201d</p><p>He stops at the bottom steps, looking over his shoulder, \u201cRobert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk while we walk.\u201d</p><p>Once their steps fall in line, the men head down the sidewalk. The rest of the campus is quiet around them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going out of town for Thanksgiving, right?\u201d Chris asks Robert, thinking about the phone conversation he\u2019d just heard.</p><p>\u201cYes, Illinois,\u201d Robert pauses as he watches Chris, his eyes narrowing. \u201cAnd what are you and Jennifer doing for the holiday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh uh, nothing this year.\u201d Chris\u2019s cheeks show a slight tint of red. \u201cI thought you knew-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I was just hoping that you two had worked it out already.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, we haven\u2019t. And I don\u2019t know if we will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to spend the holiday with (Y/N)?\u201d</p><p>Chris\u2019s breath catches in his throat, panic seizing his heart. He tries to pretend this isn\u2019t happening, \u201cNo. Why would you ask that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, there\u2019s just been some rumors about you two going around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat rumors?\u201d Chris\u2019s heels scuff against the cement as he slows down.</p><p>\u201cYou know, that you two are physically involved,\u201d the look Robert gives him is completely suspicious.</p><p>\u201cWe-, we\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what she said when I asked her.\u201d Chris\u2019s feet nearly stop. (Y/N)\u2019s calls had to be about this. \u201cShe told me it was just a misplaced flirtation on her part and that nothing more was happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d Chris says, but his face almost betrays him. His eyes look distant, hurt, as he tries to hold Robert\u2019s gaze, his hands tucked in his pockets. Robert\u2019s wariness disappears as he watches him, replaced with a deeper concern, whether it\u2019s for Chris or (Y/N) is unclear. \u201cWe get along really well, and have grown closer than I have to any other TA. But nothing\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>Chris drops his gaze to ground, remembering how he told (Y/N) that he\u2019s resign if her job ever was ever on the line. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy you two like each other. I think it\u2019s been a beneficial time for both of you,\u201d Robert answers. \u201cAnd if your relationship becomes more, that\u2019s fine in the future, when she\u2019s not your TA. If you\u2019re not her teacher or her supervisor, I can protect you two. But this isn\u2019t the time for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that Robert,\u201d Chris nods. The men step into the parking lot. </p><p>\u201cGood, because I\u2019m choosing to believe you two right now. But I know you Chris, I know you\u2019re going through some shit right now. But sleeping with your TA isn\u2019t going to fix your marriage, or your pain. And (Y/N) doesn\u2019t deserve that either.\u201d </p><p>Robert unlocks his car as Chris opens his front door, watching Robert walk away. </p><p>Robert turns on his heels, walking backwards, and adds, \u201cBut if somehow the board finds out that something has happened, and this isn\u2019t just a rumor I can talk them out of. I\u2019m not going to protect you, or your job.\u201d</p><p>As Robert disappears into his vehicle, Chris sinks down into his front seat, his keys hanging in his hand. He was right, (Y/N) deserved better than being treated like a secret affair. Which is why he was trying to get a divorce. But Jennifer was still being resistant. She wanted to meet in person to discuss the divorce papers. She wanted to see him this weekend to talk. And (Y/N) didn\u2019t deserve to have to wait around for him to be fully available either.</p><p>Sure, classes would end in a month, but how long with the divorce proceedings go on if Jennifer fought? Would she drag (Y/N) up to the school board? Or in court? No matter how much he loves you, he knows this isn\u2019t the relationship you deserve.</p><p>Chris finally made himself move, sitting in his car wouldn\u2019t fix any of his problems. </p><p>On his way home, (Y/N) called again. He let it ring.</p><hr><p>Chris calls you back around 10 pm. Much later than you expected. </p><p>You answer the phone immediately, \u201cChris, hi-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d Your heart drops. You reach out for the wall, your body needing support. His voice is clear and serious, and it feels heavy, like his words are breaking as they hit your skin. \u201cRobert talk-\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you know?\u201d you cut him off. </p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Your fear eases, no longer squeezing your chest.</p><p>\u201cI told him nothing has happened. We should be okay.\u201d You want to be relieved, but your mind won\u2019t let yourself feel that yet.</p><p>\u201cI know. But Robert knows me. He knows I care about you, hell, he practically confirmed that he knows about us. But he\u2019s giving us the benefit of the doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good Chris. We\u2019ll be okay.\u201d You shut your eyes, praying this was the end of this conversation. You\u2019d be more careful moving forward. And once the semester was over and Jennifer signed the papers, you two could be open.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great that he\u2019s not going to report anything, but we can\u2019t keep sneaking around. Not while you\u2019re my TA. Now that he knows, he\u2019ll be keeping an eye on us.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay, so we\u2019ll just see each other at our apartments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, (Y/N). We need to slow down. Put some distance between us.\u201d</p><p>You grow quiet. You\u2019re on the ground now, somehow. You feel like you\u2019re not even in your body. Your heart isn\u2019t in your body anymore either. It\u2019s lying on the floor in front of you, bleeding out on your carpet. Your eyes grow hot as water builds behind your lids.</p><p>\u201cBut I-\u201d your voice cracks, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, but that doesn\u2019t change our situation. We have to cool off for a while. It\u2019ll be safer that way. Less rumors, less at stake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris.\u201d It comes out as a whimper. Less at stake. Less at stake for yours jobs maybe, but not for your sanity. How would you see him in class, in the office, and not look at him like he was your entire heart?

Clearly, he\u2019s not sure how to address this situation. And the panic shooting through your whole body tries to throw you into admitting. Luckily, your logic takes over as you clutch your notebook tightly between your fingers and put on an earnest face.</p><p>\u201cI mean, yes. We\u2019ve become friends over the semester. We\u2019ve spent time outside of class together. He\u2019s helped me with my writing.\u201d And a lot more but you can\u2019t say that. Not until you know exactly what Robert knows.</p><p>\u201cA friendly relationship, even a mentor/mentoree relationship is absolutely fine. But there\u2019s been a rumor passed along that you two are past that. That you\u2019ve become involved in an\u2026 another way.\u201d </p><p>You don\u2019t answer him this time. He\u2019s only heard rumors, but who told him those rumors? And who started those rumors? Was it your guy\u2019s class after that awful, awkward moment on Tuesday, or had someone seen you two? </p><p>\u201cLook, if anything has happened between you two, I don\u2019t blame you. Chris is a loveable, caring, handsome man. But if you two have a physical or romantic relationship, I need to know. I can\u2019t protect either of your positions here if I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking you myself. I need you to tell me what\u2019s going on between you two.\u201d</p><p>You weigh your options for a moment, dropping your focus to the edge of your notebook, picking at the frayed edge of it. If someone saw you two, there\u2019s no use in lying. Keeping your job by being honest makes sense, and that way neither of you get hurt. But the precedent for TAs and professors having public relationships was almost nonexistent. And normally in these situations, one of you had to lose your job. </p><p>\u201cAnd if I have this wrong, tell me (Y/N),\u201d Robert continues. \u201cIf Chris has pressured you, or forced himself on you, this is a safe space. I can help you. I\u2019d really like it if you\u2019d let me help you.\u201d</p><p>You take a deep breath and settle on your path. A life without Chris doesn\u2019t feel like it would be a life at all. You have to protect both of you. </p><p>\u201cNo no, Robert. Nothing like that has happened. Chris is nothing but a gentleman.\u201d You look up at him and visibly see his relief. \u201cBut I, I\u2019ve flirted with him a couple times. I knew it was wrong. He\u2019s such a nice guy and spending so much time around him has made me like him a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s completely understandable,\u201d he nods. Good. He\u2019s buying it.</p><p>\u201cChris never really responded to me. He\u2019s never compromised his professional position. I was the one who fucked up, and I\u2019m so sorry I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Flirtation, although unprofessional, is not against school rules. And coming clean to me means you know that you can\u2019t go any further.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fully aware. I\u2019d hoped that no one would find out since it hasn\u2019t affected our working relationship at all, but that was naive of me. I understand if you have to pull me from his class.\u201d</p><p>\u201c(Y/N),\u201d Robert sighs, \u201cif I had to pull every teacher or grad student that flirted with each other from classes in this department, most of the English faculty wouldn\u2019t have jobs.\u201d The comforting smirk he gives you helps your heart rate slow. \u201cAs long as nothing else transpires after this conversation, you\u2019ve done absolutely nothing wrong.\u201d</p><p>Your heart rate stops beating in your ears, but you can\u2019t stop your mind from reeling. If only Robert actually knew how many wrongs you two had committed.</p><p>You nod as he lets out a deep sigh and leans back into his chair. \u201cGood,\u201d he gives you an easy grin. \u201cNow back to how we\u2019re getting your story published.\u201d</p><hr><p>You leave Robert\u2019s office 20 minutes later, a list of edit suggestions and recommended publications in your bag. And your head is a mess.</p><p>No matter how easy it had been to convince Robert that there was nothing going on between you and Chris, it still clawed at the back of your mind. He\u2019d said it was a rumor, but who passes rumors onto Department Chairs? We certainly didn\u2019t share any students with Robert. Chris and I worked with mostly first or second year students, and Robert almost exclusively taught higher level capstone classes or graduate level seminars.</p><p>So then he must have heard it from inside the department. Another TA? Elizabeth had been drunk that night, but she may have remembered what she\u2019d seen. But you knew that didn\u2019t feel right in your gut. She\u2019d pretty much encouraged the affair, she wouldn\u2019t rat.</p><p>Or could it be another professor? The chances were higher that they\u2019d seen you with him at the office. </p><p>But something else nagged at you. Your intuition told you that whoever it was, they were closer to one of you than just a coworker.</p><p>As you step out the front doors and onto the tall stairs, the gray sky nearly blinds you in its fluorescence. Your fingers remain knotted tightly around your bag as you squint to see the cement.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)!\u201d a voice calls, friendly and familiar from somewhere close by.</p><p>It\u2019s Sebastian in a dark blue blazer, and his somehow brighter than the sky blue eyes are intently watching you. </p><p>\u201cSebastian,\u201d you smirk, and try not to get caught on the way his scruff softens his face.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you walking?\u201d he asks, his pace falling in line with yours.</p><p>\u201cTo my car, my day\u2019s over,\u201d you say as he continues down the sidewalk with you.</p><p>\u201cGood, I\u2019ll walk with you,\u201d he grins. \u201cSo how has your writing been going? I know Robert never stops gushing about how excited he is to have you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going, but barely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour first year of grad can be difficult, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019re doing great.\u201d You try not to stare at Sebastian in the late overcast afternoon, the soft yet stark lighting making his eyes seem crystal-like. His scruff makes him even more handsome, giving him a slight edge to his charming playboy grin. \u201cChris has been pretty helpful, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than I expected.\u201d If only he knew how helpful he actually was.</p><p>His eyes watch you as a sly smile turns his charm into cockiness, \u201cYour extracurricular time together must be quite beneficial?\u201d</p><p>You stop in your tracks. Does he now?</p><p>Your mind immediately flashing to the exchange you two had in the hallway that day after you and Chris fucked in the supply closet? The way he winked.</p><p>He knew.</p><p>Sebastian keeps walking for another couple steps before he realizes you\u2019re not with him, \u201c(Y/N)?\u201d</p><p>You grab his arm and yank him off the sidewalk. The closest building to your path is made of old grey stones, and has a corner that juts out to cover an emergency exit. You push Sebastian against the wall, your eyes blazing. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d </p><p>Sebastian raises his hands defensively, but his eyes are playful. \u201cAh, I\u2019m not saying anything!\u201d A shit eating grin tells you he\u2019s lying.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Chris has been pretty unavailable in recent weekends. And I\u2019ve read a few of his new pages. They\u2019re quite good.\u201d </p><p>You glare at him. None of that confirms that you two are together. None of that proves anything at all. Did you just blow this with your paranoia?</p><p>\u201cCut the bullshit,\u201d you whisper as you poke him in the chest, hoping he was just playing games with you.</p><p>He drops his hands and sighs, \u201cHe always writes better when he\u2019s happy between a set of thighs.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy do you think I\u2019m the one sleeping with him?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBecause I know Chris, I know how he looked at you at the Department party. All those puppy eyes and the badly concealed jealousy when I flirted with you. It was clear he wasn\u2019t going to let me anywhere near you because he wasn\u2019t giving up on you two.\u201d</p><p>You step back, your eyes closing in concentration. Had Chris really been set on being with you all that time ago? And had Sebastian really been as interested as Elizabeth had guessed? While there was something nice about the idea that Chris knew how he felt about you even then, it didn\u2019t stop that anger from boiling inside you at Sebastian\u2019s statement that Chris wouldn\u2019t let him get close to you.</p><p>\u201cI-, I\u2019m not something either of you could lay claim to. Only I decide who gets to be with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey- hey, I get it. You\u2019re in charge of your own body, I just meant that Chris tried to squash my interest in you. It might have just been him looking out for you then. But I think it\u2019s clear now that he\u2019s not just hung up on the sex. He actually likes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he likes me. But our relationship is private. It\u2019s no one\u2019s business but our own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d he nods, his hands sinking into his pockets, his shoulders hunching up. \u201cAnd he\u2019s my best friend, I\u2019m not trying to violate his personal life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you didn\u2019t tell Robert about us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, Robert knows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s a no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, God no,\u201d he shook his head immediately, his dark hair bouncing, \u201cI would never. Have you told Chris?\u201d</p><p>We shuffled back to the sidewalk together, adding another foot of space between us, now that I\u2019d just thrown him against a wall.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. And Robert doesn\u2019t really know anything. He called it a \u2018rumor\u2019, and I talked him out of thinking the rumor was anything serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRumor feels like something Robert would use when talking about students.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might be right.\u201d</p><p>We reach the parking lot as he turns around to look at me. He cocks his head to the side, a smug smirk wrinkling up his nose.</p><p>\u201cI usually am.\u201d</p><hr><p>2 missed calls from (Y/N) pop up on Chris\u2019s phone as he pushes out from his desk, his laptop folded in his hands. No messages appear. </p><p>His stomach growls, encouraging him to finish packing his things to go. He\u2019ll call you back on his way home. </p><p>He tucks his things into his bag and throws it over his shoulder before he flicks off the lights. The lock engages behind him as he hesitantly slips his phone into his pocket. The rest of the office doors are closed, and only a crack of light bleeds out from under one the doors opposite Chris\u2019s own office. </p><p>Letitia, the grad student that teaches freshman Composition with Elizabeth, has that office. Chris thought he\u2019d only spoken with her once at the faculty dinner last year. And he was pretty sure she hadn\u2019t been in attendance this year. But he\u2019d been dealing with enough shit in his own life, he might have missed her.</p><p>He moved towards the department entrance, his mind already wondering why you\u2019d been calling him. And if it was important, you\u2019d text him or leave a message, right?</p><p>Chris\u2019s feet bounce down the wooden stairs, the creaks of age bidding him a good night. As he makes it to the front door, he notices a figure leaning on the stones outside the door.</p><p>He pushes through carefully to find Robert on the other side, his phone pressed to his ear. The setting sun had just barely managed to escape the dense clouds for the evening, turning his cream colored shirt into a soft peach shade.</p><p>\u201cSusan, all of that sounds lovely, but we actually have to get on a plane to get there-\u201d the moment Robert notices Chris his voice lowers. \u201cI\u2019ll be home soon, we\u2019ll figure it out then.\u201d Chris gives him a sympathetic smirk and continues down the concrete stairs.</p><p>Footfall follows him as Robert calls out, \u201cHey Chris.\u201d</p><p>He stops at the bottom steps, looking over his shoulder, \u201cRobert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk while we walk.\u201d</p><p>Once their steps fall in line, the men head down the sidewalk. The rest of the campus is quiet around them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going out of town for Thanksgiving, right?\u201d Chris asks Robert, thinking about the phone conversation he\u2019d just heard.</p><p>\u201cYes, Illinois,\u201d Robert pauses as he watches Chris, his eyes narrowing. \u201cAnd what are you and Jennifer doing for the holiday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh uh, nothing this year.\u201d Chris\u2019s cheeks show a slight tint of red. \u201cI thought you knew-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I was just hoping that you two had worked it out already.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, we haven\u2019t. And I don\u2019t know if we will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to spend the holiday with (Y/N)?\u201d</p><p>Chris\u2019s breath catches in his throat, panic seizing his heart. He tries to pretend this isn\u2019t happening, \u201cNo. Why would you ask that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, there\u2019s just been some rumors about you two going around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat rumors?\u201d Chris\u2019s heels scuff against the cement as he slows down.</p><p>\u201cYou know, that you two are physically involved,\u201d the look Robert gives him is completely suspicious.</p><p>\u201cWe-, we\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what she said when I asked her.\u201d Chris\u2019s feet nearly stop. (Y/N)\u2019s calls had to be about this. \u201cShe told me it was just a misplaced flirtation on her part and that nothing more was happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d Chris says, but his face almost betrays him. His eyes look distant, hurt, as he tries to hold Robert\u2019s gaze, his hands tucked in his pockets. Robert\u2019s wariness disappears as he watches him, replaced with a deeper concern, whether it\u2019s for Chris or (Y/N) is unclear. \u201cWe get along really well, and have grown closer than I have to any other TA. But nothing\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>Chris drops his gaze to ground, remembering how he told (Y/N) that he\u2019s resign if her job ever was ever on the line. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy you two like each other. I think it\u2019s been a beneficial time for both of you,\u201d Robert answers. \u201cAnd if your relationship becomes more, that\u2019s fine in the future, when she\u2019s not your TA. If you\u2019re not her teacher or her supervisor, I can protect you two. But this isn\u2019t the time for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that Robert,\u201d Chris nods. The men step into the parking lot. </p><p>\u201cGood, because I\u2019m choosing to believe you two right now. But I know you Chris, I know you\u2019re going through some shit right now. But sleeping with your TA isn\u2019t going to fix your marriage, or your pain. And (Y/N) doesn\u2019t deserve that either.\u201d </p><p>Robert unlocks his car as Chris opens his front door, watching Robert walk away. </p><p>Robert turns on his heels, walking backwards, and adds, \u201cBut if somehow the board finds out that something has happened, and this isn\u2019t just a rumor I can talk them out of. I\u2019m not going to protect you, or your job.\u201d</p><p>As Robert disappears into his vehicle, Chris sinks down into his front seat, his keys hanging in his hand. He was right, (Y/N) deserved better than being treated like a secret affair. Which is why he was trying to get a divorce. But Jennifer was still being resistant. She wanted to meet in person to discuss the divorce papers. She wanted to see him this weekend to talk. And (Y/N) didn\u2019t deserve to have to wait around for him to be fully available either.</p><p>Sure, classes would end in a month, but how long with the divorce proceedings go on if Jennifer fought? Would she drag (Y/N) up to the school board? Or in court? No matter how much he loves you, he knows this isn\u2019t the relationship you deserve.</p><p>Chris finally made himself move, sitting in his car wouldn\u2019t fix any of his problems. </p><p>On his way home, (Y/N) called again. He let it ring.</p><hr><p>Chris calls you back around 10 pm. Much later than you expected. </p><p>You answer the phone immediately, \u201cChris, hi-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d Your heart drops. You reach out for the wall, your body needing support. His voice is clear and serious, and it feels heavy, like his words are breaking as they hit your skin. \u201cRobert talk-\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you know?\u201d you cut him off. </p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Your fear eases, no longer squeezing your chest.</p><p>\u201cI told him nothing has happened. We should be okay.\u201d You want to be relieved, but your mind won\u2019t let yourself feel that yet.</p><p>\u201cI know. But Robert knows me. He knows I care about you, hell, he practically confirmed that he knows about us. But he\u2019s giving us the benefit of the doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good Chris. We\u2019ll be okay.\u201d You shut your eyes, praying this was the end of this conversation. You\u2019d be more careful moving forward. And once the semester was over and Jennifer signed the papers, you two could be open.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great that he\u2019s not going to report anything, but we can\u2019t keep sneaking around. Not while you\u2019re my TA. Now that he knows, he\u2019ll be keeping an eye on us.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay, so we\u2019ll just see each other at our apartments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, (Y/N). We need to slow down. Put some distance between us.\u201d</p><p>You grow quiet. You\u2019re on the ground now, somehow. You feel like you\u2019re not even in your body. Your heart isn\u2019t in your body anymore either. It\u2019s lying on the floor in front of you, bleeding out on your carpet. Your eyes grow hot as water builds behind your lids.</p><p>\u201cBut I-\u201d your voice cracks, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, but that doesn\u2019t change our situation. We have to cool off for a while. It\u2019ll be safer that way. Less rumors, less at stake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris.\u201d It comes out as a whimper. Less at stake. Less at stake for yours jobs maybe, but not for your sanity. How would you see him in class, in the office, and not look at him like he was your entire heart? How could you pretend that you were just friends?</p><p>He whispers, \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Your tears run hot against your cheeks. They pelt your chest, burning like alcohol on an open wound.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight,\u201d he manages. The line disconnects. </p><p>You\u2019re left on your floor, your phone in your hands, and your heart broken in front of you.</p><hr><p>Tags: <b><a></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPmxnZde-fg7tw7ky6gmUaA\">@goosedanvers</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms2iAaiOXeITB14P7u2itnQ\">@irishdancr24</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBV4Dh6Sy_nPwLintx3PRHQ\">@lostboyinneverland</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXil-zH28iNClTS9UNyaAzA\">@suz-123</a></b>\u00a0<b>@</b><strike>funlizzie02</strike><b>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_YBoTKnxLeikp-LyTINIQA\">@void-imaginations</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mk6cJg51wMHUsdSFwRHhXjg\">@cryingovershipsthatneversailed</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHN056I_D8ekQ8kZ7Y4zCVQ\">@breezykpop</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGAnchA7bVQWLX-zuK7xlEA\">@jcc04220</a></b>\u00a0<b><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbe29vW7LW2QdFTGx-XIrJg\">@nys30</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJlGLy5YJ1B6-QjvG9BJWwA\">@jonsnowisnotdeadthough</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mc2Kb_Y38BjoHk-FIWY7Rlg\">@guera31</a></b>\u00a0<b>@</b><strike>wickedcitywitch</strike><b>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m84X-u_yvvO8lY_MkNSRnjw\">@thelondondreamer5</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx92Ca0bmTX9IHcJIKCwOQ\">@patzammit</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvFEAzWXUrcNrMxyFoephgw\">@talannalew</a>\u00a0 <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5QwZUs380DEO8Ypngrzz2g\">@lilypalmer1987</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/msBuzj-ERhp_ZtEJjnOuhOA\">@supperunnatural20</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIraWWEgQJERO-bKhOux7iA\">@evanstanfanatic</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5yUTtKOlluGmCPdwFcoZKA\">@lucinapomona</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mz072gPtKVYwpIUB7wPNRcg\">@r5rocks101</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mL_C0ZJJB5Fn24BzDlsD47Q\">@dolphinpink310</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhvdBDnM3eWuNSTqMFUZaaQ\">@bojabee</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRwckLALJgD_Tk-PtM1IMDA\">@youtheheckisbucky</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbgCK4NETm23uYtIEABN6-A\">@thefridgeismybestie</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtaWaN_ighiYYScW7vLIC9w\">@ssweet-empowerment</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5QSam4Ife2TKINrNYibWHA\">@sophiealiice</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOzGcSgnu5XxsbPZ6LOxzUg\">@lostxsea</a></b></p>",

Clearly, he&rsquo;s not sure how to address this situation. And the panic shooting through your whole body tries to throw you into admitting. Luckily, your logic takes over as you clutch your notebook tightly between your fingers and put on an earnest face.</p><p>&ldquo;I mean, yes. We&rsquo;ve become friends over the semester. We&rsquo;ve spent time outside of class together. He&rsquo;s helped me with my writing.&rdquo; And a lot more but you can&rsquo;t say that. Not until you know exactly what Robert knows.</p><p>&ldquo;A friendly relationship, even a mentor/mentoree relationship is absolutely fine. But there&rsquo;s been a rumor passed along that you two are past that. That you&rsquo;ve become involved in an&hellip; another way.&rdquo; </p><p>You don&rsquo;t answer him this time. He&rsquo;s only heard rumors, but who told him those rumors? And who started those rumors? Was it your guy&rsquo;s class after that awful, awkward moment on Tuesday, or had someone seen you two? </p><p>&ldquo;Look, if anything has happened between you two, I don&rsquo;t blame you. Chris is a loveable, caring, handsome man. But if you two have a physical or romantic relationship, I need to know. I can&rsquo;t protect either of your positions here if I don&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m asking you myself. I need you to tell me what&rsquo;s going on between you two.&rdquo;</p><p>You weigh your options for a moment, dropping your focus to the edge of your notebook, picking at the frayed edge of it. If someone saw you two, there&rsquo;s no use in lying. Keeping your job by being honest makes sense, and that way neither of you get hurt. But the precedent for TAs and professors having public relationships was almost nonexistent. And normally in these situations, one of you had to lose your job. </p><p>&ldquo;And if I have this wrong, tell me (Y/N),&rdquo; Robert continues. &ldquo;If Chris has pressured you, or forced himself on you, this is a safe space. I can help you. I&rsquo;d really like it if you&rsquo;d let me help you.&rdquo;</p><p>You take a deep breath and settle on your path. A life without Chris doesn&rsquo;t feel like it would be a life at all. You have to protect both of you. </p><p>&ldquo;No no, Robert. Nothing like that has happened. Chris is nothing but a gentleman.&rdquo; You look up at him and visibly see his relief. &ldquo;But I, I&rsquo;ve flirted with him a couple times. I knew it was wrong. He&rsquo;s such a nice guy and spending so much time around him has made me like him a lot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s completely understandable,&rdquo; he nods. Good. He&rsquo;s buying it.</p><p>&ldquo;Chris never really responded to me. He&rsquo;s never compromised his professional position. I was the one who fucked up, and I&rsquo;m so sorry I did.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. Flirtation, although unprofessional, is not against school rules. And coming clean to me means you know that you can&rsquo;t go any further.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fully aware. I&rsquo;d hoped that no one would find out since it hasn&rsquo;t affected our working relationship at all, but that was naive of me. I understand if you have to pull me from his class.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N),&rdquo; Robert sighs, &ldquo;if I had to pull every teacher or grad student that flirted with each other from classes in this department, most of the English faculty wouldn&rsquo;t have jobs.&rdquo; The comforting smirk he gives you helps your heart rate slow. &ldquo;As long as nothing else transpires after this conversation, you&rsquo;ve done absolutely nothing wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>Your heart rate stops beating in your ears, but you can&rsquo;t stop your mind from reeling. If only Robert actually knew how many wrongs you two had committed.</p><p>You nod as he lets out a deep sigh and leans back into his chair. &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he gives you an easy grin. &ldquo;Now back to how we&rsquo;re getting your story published.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>You leave Robert&rsquo;s office 20 minutes later, a list of edit suggestions and recommended publications in your bag. And your head is a mess.</p><p>No matter how easy it had been to convince Robert that there was nothing going on between you and Chris, it still clawed at the back of your mind. He&rsquo;d said it was a rumor, but who passes rumors onto Department Chairs? We certainly didn&rsquo;t share any students with Robert. Chris and I worked with mostly first or second year students, and Robert almost exclusively taught higher level capstone classes or graduate level seminars.</p><p>So then he must have heard it from inside the department. Another TA? Elizabeth had been drunk that night, but she may have remembered what she&rsquo;d seen. But you knew that didn&rsquo;t feel right in your gut. She&rsquo;d pretty much encouraged the affair, she wouldn&rsquo;t rat.</p><p>Or could it be another professor? The chances were higher that they&rsquo;d seen you with him at the office. </p><p>But something else nagged at you. Your intuition told you that whoever it was, they were closer to one of you than just a coworker.</p><p>As you step out the front doors and onto the tall stairs, the gray sky nearly blinds you in its fluorescence. Your fingers remain knotted tightly around your bag as you squint to see the cement.</p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N)!&rdquo; a voice calls, friendly and familiar from somewhere close by.</p><p>It&rsquo;s Sebastian in a dark blue blazer, and his somehow brighter than the sky blue eyes are intently watching you. </p><p>&ldquo;Sebastian,&rdquo; you smirk, and try not to get caught on the way his scruff softens his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you walking?&rdquo; he asks, his pace falling in line with yours.</p><p>&ldquo;To my car, my day&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; you say as he continues down the sidewalk with you.</p><p>&ldquo;Good, I&rsquo;ll walk with you,&rdquo; he grins. &ldquo;So how has your writing been going? I know Robert never stops gushing about how excited he is to have you here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going, but barely.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your first year of grad can be difficult, but I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re doing great.&rdquo; You try not to stare at Sebastian in the late overcast afternoon, the soft yet stark lighting making his eyes seem crystal-like. His scruff makes him even more handsome, giving him a slight edge to his charming playboy grin. &ldquo;Chris has been pretty helpful, hasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;More than I expected.&rdquo; If only he knew how helpful he actually was.</p><p>His eyes watch you as a sly smile turns his charm into cockiness, &ldquo;Your extracurricular time together must be quite beneficial?&rdquo;</p><p>You stop in your tracks. Does he now?</p><p>Your mind immediately flashing to the exchange you two had in the hallway that day after you and Chris fucked in the supply closet? The way he winked.</p><p>He knew.</p><p>Sebastian keeps walking for another couple steps before he realizes you&rsquo;re not with him, &ldquo;(Y/N)?&rdquo;</p><p>You grab his arm and yank him off the sidewalk. The closest building to your path is made of old grey stones, and has a corner that juts out to cover an emergency exit. You push Sebastian against the wall, your eyes blazing. </p><p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; </p><p>Sebastian raises his hands defensively, but his eyes are playful. &ldquo;Ah, I&rsquo;m not saying anything!&rdquo; A shit eating grin tells you he&rsquo;s lying.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know Chris has been pretty unavailable in recent weekends. And I&rsquo;ve read a few of his new pages. They&rsquo;re quite good.&rdquo; </p><p>You glare at him. None of that confirms that you two are together. None of that proves anything at all. Did you just blow this with your paranoia?</p><p>&ldquo;Cut the bullshit,&rdquo; you whisper as you poke him in the chest, hoping he was just playing games with you.</p><p>He drops his hands and sighs, &ldquo;He always writes better when he&rsquo;s happy between a set of thighs.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Why do you think I&rsquo;m the one sleeping with him?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Because I know Chris, I know how he looked at you at the Department party. All those puppy eyes and the badly concealed jealousy when I flirted with you. It was clear he wasn&rsquo;t going to let me anywhere near you because he wasn&rsquo;t giving up on you two.&rdquo;</p><p>You step back, your eyes closing in concentration. Had Chris really been set on being with you all that time ago? And had Sebastian really been as interested as Elizabeth had guessed? While there was something nice about the idea that Chris knew how he felt about you even then, it didn&rsquo;t stop that anger from boiling inside you at Sebastian&rsquo;s statement that Chris wouldn&rsquo;t let him get close to you.</p><p>&ldquo;I-, I&rsquo;m not something either of you could lay claim to. Only I decide who gets to be with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey- hey, I get it. You&rsquo;re in charge of your own body, I just meant that Chris tried to squash my interest in you. It might have just been him looking out for you then. But I think it&rsquo;s clear now that he&rsquo;s not just hung up on the sex. He actually likes you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know he likes me. But our relationship is private. It&rsquo;s no one&rsquo;s business but our own.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; he nods, his hands sinking into his pockets, his shoulders hunching up. &ldquo;And he&rsquo;s my best friend, I&rsquo;m not trying to violate his personal life.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you didn&rsquo;t tell Robert about us?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shit, Robert knows?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s a no?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, God no,&rdquo; he shook his head immediately, his dark hair bouncing, &ldquo;I would never. Have you told Chris?&rdquo;</p><p>We shuffled back to the sidewalk together, adding another foot of space between us, now that I&rsquo;d just thrown him against a wall.</p><p>&ldquo;Not yet. And Robert doesn&rsquo;t really know anything. He called it a &lsquo;rumor&rsquo;, and I talked him out of thinking the rumor was anything serious.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Rumor feels like something Robert would use when talking about students.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You might be right.&rdquo;</p><p>We reach the parking lot as he turns around to look at me. He cocks his head to the side, a smug smirk wrinkling up his nose.</p><p>&ldquo;I usually am.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>2 missed calls from (Y/N) pop up on Chris&rsquo;s phone as he pushes out from his desk, his laptop folded in his hands. No messages appear. </p><p>His stomach growls, encouraging him to finish packing his things to go. He&rsquo;ll call you back on his way home. </p><p>He tucks his things into his bag and throws it over his shoulder before he flicks off the lights. The lock engages behind him as he hesitantly slips his phone into his pocket. The rest of the office doors are closed, and only a crack of light bleeds out from under one the doors opposite Chris&rsquo;s own office. </p><p>Letitia, the grad student that teaches freshman Composition with Elizabeth, has that office. Chris thought he&rsquo;d only spoken with her once at the faculty dinner last year. And he was pretty sure she hadn&rsquo;t been in attendance this year. But he&rsquo;d been dealing with enough shit in his own life, he might have missed her.</p><p>He moved towards the department entrance, his mind already wondering why you&rsquo;d been calling him. And if it was important, you&rsquo;d text him or leave a message, right?</p><p>Chris&rsquo;s feet bounce down the wooden stairs, the creaks of age bidding him a good night. As he makes it to the front door, he notices a figure leaning on the stones outside the door.</p><p>He pushes through carefully to find Robert on the other side, his phone pressed to his ear. The setting sun had just barely managed to escape the dense clouds for the evening, turning his cream colored shirt into a soft peach shade.</p><p>&ldquo;Susan, all of that sounds lovely, but we actually have to get on a plane to get there-&rdquo; the moment Robert notices Chris his voice lowers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be home soon, we&rsquo;ll figure it out then.&rdquo; Chris gives him a sympathetic smirk and continues down the concrete stairs.</p><p>Footfall follows him as Robert calls out, &ldquo;Hey Chris.&rdquo;</p><p>He stops at the bottom steps, looking over his shoulder, &ldquo;Robert.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk while we walk.&rdquo;</p><p>Once their steps fall in line, the men head down the sidewalk. The rest of the campus is quiet around them.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going out of town for Thanksgiving, right?&rdquo; Chris asks Robert, thinking about the phone conversation he&rsquo;d just heard.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Illinois,&rdquo; Robert pauses as he watches Chris, his eyes narrowing. &ldquo;And what are you and Jennifer doing for the holiday?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh uh, nothing this year.&rdquo; Chris&rsquo;s cheeks show a slight tint of red. &ldquo;I thought you knew-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do. I was just hoping that you two had worked it out already.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No, we haven&rsquo;t. And I don&rsquo;t know if we will.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you going to spend the holiday with (Y/N)?&rdquo;</p><p>Chris&rsquo;s breath catches in his throat, panic seizing his heart. He tries to pretend this isn&rsquo;t happening, &ldquo;No. Why would you ask that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s just been some rumors about you two going around.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What rumors?&rdquo; Chris&rsquo;s heels scuff against the cement as he slows down.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, that you two are physically involved,&rdquo; the look Robert gives him is completely suspicious.</p><p>&ldquo;We-, we&rsquo;re not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what she said when I asked her.&rdquo; Chris&rsquo;s feet nearly stop. (Y/N)&rsquo;s calls had to be about this. &ldquo;She told me it was just a misplaced flirtation on her part and that nothing more was happening.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Chris says, but his face almost betrays him. His eyes look distant, hurt, as he tries to hold Robert&rsquo;s gaze, his hands tucked in his pockets. Robert&rsquo;s wariness disappears as he watches him, replaced with a deeper concern, whether it&rsquo;s for Chris or (Y/N) is unclear. &ldquo;We get along really well, and have grown closer than I have to any other TA. But nothing&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris drops his gaze to ground, remembering how he told (Y/N) that he&rsquo;s resign if her job ever was ever on the line. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy you two like each other. I think it&rsquo;s been a beneficial time for both of you,&rdquo; Robert answers. &ldquo;And if your relationship becomes more, that&rsquo;s fine in the future, when she&rsquo;s not your TA. If you&rsquo;re not her teacher or her supervisor, I can protect you two. But this isn&rsquo;t the time for it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I understand that Robert,&rdquo; Chris nods. The men step into the parking lot. </p><p>&ldquo;Good, because I&rsquo;m choosing to believe you two right now. But I know you Chris, I know you&rsquo;re going through some shit right now. But sleeping with your TA isn&rsquo;t going to fix your marriage, or your pain. And (Y/N) doesn&rsquo;t deserve that either.&rdquo; </p><p>Robert unlocks his car as Chris opens his front door, watching Robert walk away. </p><p>Robert turns on his heels, walking backwards, and adds, &ldquo;But if somehow the board finds out that something has happened, and this isn&rsquo;t just a rumor I can talk them out of. I&rsquo;m not going to protect you, or your job.&rdquo;</p><p>As Robert disappears into his vehicle, Chris sinks down into his front seat, his keys hanging in his hand. He was right, (Y/N) deserved better than being treated like a secret affair. Which is why he was trying to get a divorce. But Jennifer was still being resistant. She wanted to meet in person to discuss the divorce papers. She wanted to see him this weekend to talk. And (Y/N) didn&rsquo;t deserve to have to wait around for him to be fully available either.</p><p>Sure, classes would end in a month, but how long with the divorce proceedings go on if Jennifer fought? Would she drag (Y/N) up to the school board? Or in court? No matter how much he loves you, he knows this isn&rsquo;t the relationship you deserve.</p><p>Chris finally made himself move, sitting in his car wouldn&rsquo;t fix any of his problems. </p><p>On his way home, (Y/N) called again. He let it ring.</p><hr /><p>Chris calls you back around 10 pm. Much later than you expected. </p><p>You answer the phone immediately, &ldquo;Chris, hi-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We need to talk.&rdquo; Your heart drops. You reach out for the wall, your body needing support. His voice is clear and serious, and it feels heavy, like his words are breaking as they hit your skin. &ldquo;Robert talk-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you know?&rdquo; you cut him off. </p><p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo; Your fear eases, no longer squeezing your chest.</p><p>&ldquo;I told him nothing has happened. We should be okay.&rdquo; You want to be relieved, but your mind won&rsquo;t let yourself feel that yet.</p><p>&ldquo;I know. But Robert knows me. He knows I care about you, hell, he practically confirmed that he knows about us. But he&rsquo;s giving us the benefit of the doubt.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good Chris. We&rsquo;ll be okay.&rdquo; You shut your eyes, praying this was the end of this conversation. You&rsquo;d be more careful moving forward. And once the semester was over and Jennifer signed the papers, you two could be open.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great that he&rsquo;s not going to report anything, but we can&rsquo;t keep sneaking around. Not while you&rsquo;re my TA. Now that he knows, he&rsquo;ll be keeping an eye on us.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, so we&rsquo;ll just see each other at our apartments.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, (Y/N). We need to slow down. Put some distance between us.&rdquo;</p><p>You grow quiet. You&rsquo;re on the ground now, somehow. You feel like you&rsquo;re not even in your body. Your heart isn&rsquo;t in your body anymore either. It&rsquo;s lying on the floor in front of you, bleeding out on your carpet. Your eyes grow hot as water builds behind your lids.</p><p>&ldquo;But I-&rdquo; your voice cracks, &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too, but that doesn&rsquo;t change our situation. We have to cool off for a while. It&rsquo;ll be safer that way. Less rumors, less at stake.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Chris.&rdquo; It comes out as a whimper. Less at stake. Less at stake for yours jobs maybe, but not for your sanity. How would you see him in class, in the office, and not look at him like he was your entire heart? How could you pretend that you were just friends?</p><p>He whispers, &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><p>Your tears run hot against your cheeks. They pelt your chest, burning like alcohol on an open wound.</p><p>&ldquo;Goodnight,&rdquo; he manages. The line disconnects. </p><p>You&rsquo;re left on your floor, your phone in your hands, and your heart broken in front of you.</p><hr /><p>Tags: <b><a></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPmxnZde-fg7tw7ky6gmUaA\">@goosedanvers</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms2iAaiOXeITB14P7u2itnQ\">@irishdancr24</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBV4Dh6Sy_nPwLintx3PRHQ\">@lostboyinneverland</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXil-zH28iNClTS9UNyaAzA\">@suz-123</a></b>&nbsp;<b>@</b><strike>funlizzie02</strike><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_YBoTKnxLeikp-LyTINIQA\">@void-imaginations</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mk6cJg51wMHUsdSFwRHhXjg\">@cryingovershipsthatneversailed</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHN056I_D8ekQ8kZ7Y4zCVQ\">@breezykpop</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGAnchA7bVQWLX-zuK7xlEA\">@jcc04220</a></b>&nbsp;<b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbe29vW7LW2QdFTGx-XIrJg\">@nys30</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJlGLy5YJ1B6-QjvG9BJWwA\">@jonsnowisnotdeadthough</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mc2Kb_Y38BjoHk-FIWY7Rlg\">@guera31</a></b>&nbsp;<b>@</b><strike>wickedcitywitch</strike><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m84X-u_yvvO8lY_MkNSRnjw\">@thelondondreamer5</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx92Ca0bmTX9IHcJIKCwOQ\">@patzammit</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvFEAzWXUrcNrMxyFoephgw\">@talannalew</a>&nbsp; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5QwZUs380DEO8Ypngrzz2g\">@lilypalmer1987</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msBuzj-ERhp_ZtEJjnOuhOA\">@supperunnatural20</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIraWWEgQJERO-bKhOux7iA\">@evanstanfanatic</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5yUTtKOlluGmCPdwFcoZKA\">@lucinapomona</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mz072gPtKVYwpIUB7wPNRcg\">@r5rocks101</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mL_C0ZJJB5Fn24BzDlsD47Q\">@dolphinpink310</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhvdBDnM3eWuNSTqMFUZaaQ\">@bojabee</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRwckLALJgD_Tk-PtM1IMDA\">@youtheheckisbucky</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbgCK4NETm23uYtIEABN6-A\">@thefridgeismybestie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtaWaN_ighiYYScW7vLIC9w\">@ssweet-empowerment</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5QSam4Ife2TKINrNYibWHA\">@sophiealiice</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOzGcSgnu5XxsbPZ6LOxzUg\">@lostxsea</a></b></p>",

Obviously you wanted Steve to be the first to know and then you both would decide on when to tell everyone else.&nbsp; You hyped yourself up, excited to start this new chapter with the man you loved.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />After searching all over the place for him, you found him in the gym, the first place you probably should have checked.&nbsp; You waited a few minutes to get his attention and just watched him at work.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t until he noticed you were standing there that you remembered what you had come to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey, is everything alright?&rdquo;&nbsp; He asked, stopping what he was doing and walked over to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, sorry.&nbsp; I just got distracted watching you.&rdquo;&nbsp; You chuckled lightly before giving him a peck on the lips.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I actually wanted to tell you something.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Nerves started to kick in again and everything you had rehearsed in your head had disappeared.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ok, what is it?&rdquo;&nbsp; His cheerful demeanor made you smile.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe you should sit down.. or you could stand, I don&rsquo;t really know how this works.&rdquo;&nbsp; You rambled, scolding yourself to just tell him.&nbsp; He gave a quizzical look and sat down.&nbsp; You paced for a few seconds as you tried to gather your thoughts.&nbsp; Maybe you should just blurt it out, coming up with some long speech might seem to dramatic.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you sure everything&rsquo;s ok?&rdquo;&nbsp; He chuckled slightly, reaching up to grab your hand.&nbsp; You squeezed it gently and gave a nod.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; I just wanted to tell you that&hellip; I&rsquo;m.. pregnant.&rdquo;&nbsp; There.&nbsp; You told him.&nbsp; It was forward and to the point, but he was looking at you like you had spoken in tongues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You raised your brows and waited for his reaction, any kind of reaction to let you know that he heard you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re pregnant? Are you sure?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Um, yes? I&rsquo;m fairly certain,&rdquo; you were worried now.&nbsp; This wasn&rsquo;t going the way you had hoped.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I mean, I took at least three tests to make sure and they were all positive.&nbsp; Are you&hellip; upset that I&rsquo;m pregnant?&nbsp; Because we have options.&nbsp; I mean, there&rsquo;s adoption, but that&rsquo;s going to take 9 months, and I&rsquo;m not for abortion or anything, but I could go away until the baby comes and it&rsquo;ll be like it didn&rsquo;t happen-&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No! God, no..&rdquo;&nbsp; He stood up and wrapped his arms around you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m not upset at all, this is great news, I just didn&rsquo;t think I <i>could</i>,&nbsp; you know? With the serum and everything, and you know, being frozen and all that&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp; he stopped and hugged you tightly before looking at you again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But it happened, I can&rsquo;t tell you how happy that makes me.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You weren&rsquo;t sure how to process this whole interaction, it was a bit of an awkward exchange.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t exactly what you had in mind, but he was happy about it, so that made you happy.&nbsp; You smiled and let out a sigh of relief.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So we&rsquo;re gonna do this?&rdquo;&nbsp; You asked him, wanting to double check.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, of course!&rdquo;&nbsp; He got excited and gave you another hug.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Does anyone else know?&rdquo;&nbsp; You shook your head.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I wanted you to be the first.&nbsp; I only found out yesterday.&rdquo;&nbsp; You gripped tightly to his shirt before pulling away from him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be the best father.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m excited that we get to share this together, start a new chapter of our lives. We&rsquo;ll have a little mini Rogers running around, can you imagine?&rdquo;&nbsp; You mused, giving him a kiss.&nbsp; He laughed at the thought.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a great adventure.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",
