She wished somehow they could come to the Wall before Winterfell,\n so Jon might muss up her hair and call her &ldquo;little sister.&rdquo; She&rsquo;d tell \nhim, &ldquo;I missed you,&rdquo; and he&rsquo;d say it too at the very same moment, the \nway they always used to say things together. She would have liked that. \nShe would have liked that better than anything. </i><br /></p><p>\nHe missed his true brothers: [&hellip;] Robb, his rival and best friend and constant companion. [&hellip;]<i> And Arya &hellip; he missed her even more than Robb,\n skinny little thing that she was, all scraped knees and tangled hair \nand torn clothes, so fierce and willful. Arya never seemed to fit, no \nmore than he had &hellip; yet she could always make Jon smile. He would give anything to be with her now, to muss up her hair once more and watch her make a face, to hear her finish a sentence with him. \n\n</i><br /></p><p>\n<i>Maybe I should go to the Wall instead of Riverrun. Jon wouldn&rsquo;t care who I killed or whether I brushed my hair</i></p><p><i>\nHer home was gone, her parents dead, and all her brothers slain but Jon Snow on the Wall. That was where she had wanted to go.\n\n<br /></i></p><p><i>\n</i>Arya stared at [the children] with resentment, remembering the times \nshe&rsquo;d played at hoops with Bran and Jon and their baby brother Rickon.<i> \n[&hellip;] She would have given anything if Jon had been here to call her &ldquo;little sister&rdquo; and muss her hair. \n\n<br /></i></p><p><i>\n[Jon] remembered suddenly how he used to muss Arya&rsquo;s hair. His little stick of a sister. He wondered how she was faring. It made him a little sad to think that he might never muss her hair again.\n\n<br /></i></p><p><i>\n</i>Alone, [Arya] slid through the shadow of the Tower of Ghosts.<i> She \nwalked fast, to keep ahead of her fear, and it felt as though Syrio \nForel walked beside her, and Yoren, and Jaqen H&rsquo;ghar, and Jon Snow.\n\n<br /></i></p><p><i>Arya missed Jon most of all. </i>Just saying his name made her sad. <br /></p><p>She wondered if [Jon] would still call her &ldquo;little sister.&rdquo; <i>I&rsquo;m not so little anymore. He&rsquo;d have to call me something else</i>. <br /></p><p>\n\n[&hellip;] <i>She missed Jon Snow the most of all her brothers.</i></p><p>\nShe had never cared if she was pretty, even when she was stupid Arya Stark. Only her father had ever called her that. <i>Him, and Jon Snow, sometimes</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>\n<i>What do you know of my heart, priestess? What do you know of my sister?</i>\n\n<br /></p><p><i>\nJon Snow sank to one knee in the snow. <i>Gods of my fathers, protect these men. And Arya too, my little sister, wherever she might be. I pray you, let Mance find her and bring her safe to me.</i>\n\n<br /></i></p><p><i>Bring her home, Mance. I saved your son from Melisandre, and now I am about to save four thousand of your free folk. You owe me this one little girl.</i> <br /></p><p>\n\n<i>The girl smiled in a way that reminded Jon so much of his little sister that it almost broke his heart.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is just a quarter of all the times Jon and Arya spend time thinking of each other over 5 books. There&rsquo;s a reason for why Jon and Arya have the best relationship in ASoIaF - just pure, unconditional love. <br /></p><p>It completely baffles me that, after reading the books, there are still people who think that the next season of GOT is going to be all about Jon and Sansa&rsquo;s great romantic repressed love. Like really? When the show has saved the best reunion for last? When the books have been leading to this moment from the very beginning? When Jon and Arya are going to be in the same place again after 23 years, 5 books and 7 seasons? <br /></p><blockquote><p>Suddenly [Arya] looked like she was going to cry. &ldquo;I wish you were coming with us.&rdquo;</p><p><b>&ldquo;<i>Different\n roads sometimes lead to the same castle. </i>Who knows?&rdquo; He was feeling \nbetter now. He was not going to let himself be sad. </b></p></blockquote></p>",
