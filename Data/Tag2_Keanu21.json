            "description": "In addition to the pain and the exhaustion, he recalled how waiting on the cross between takes became tedious. To fight the boredom, he listened to music on headphones. One particular song called \"Above All\" (Like a Rose ...) by Michael W. Smith helped him through his most difficult moments.\n\n\"It arrived when I was confused and angry. I didn't think I could go on. The song described how Jesus was rejected and alone. That thought took me to a place \u2014 it opened an interior door that held me while on the cross,\" an emotional Caviezel explained. \"The experience of feeling rejected and alone as all those around me laughed while drinking their hot coffees, oblivious to what was occurring. Jesus must have felt like this \u2014 forsaken, rejected, alone, and despised. It helped me pray in a very deep way \u2014 to pray without words, to pray from the heart. The discomfort, the loneliness, the split shoulder, the raw flesh all forced me into the arms of God because I had nowhere else to go for a performance I knew I was unable to create.\"\nJim Caviezel, Shamelessly Catholic",

Today was one of the rare days you got to get off of work early. You began your walk home and started thinking of all the things you wanted to do today. Your thoughts were interrupted by a soft whine at your feet, you stopped and glanced down. Your heart melted, a sweet grey pit bull nuzzled at your feet, you kneeled down and held your hand out to him before softly stroking him. &ldquo;What are you doing out here little guy?&rdquo; You said softly, the dog almost seemed to comprehend your question as he trotted back from where you came, pausing to see if you followed. </p><p>You sighed, realizing none of the items on your mental to-do list would be checked this evening as you followed this dog. I mean, you couldn&rsquo;t just leave that lil cutie all alone! Nothing could&rsquo;ve prepared you for what would come next, you gasped as you turned the corner into a dark, damp alleyway and saw a beaten and bloody man sprawled on the concrete. The pit bull whined again and gently licked at the man&rsquo;s face. </p><p>You sprang into action, kneeling down beside the man. He was unconscious, his long dark hair was damp and clung to his face that was littered with small cuts and bruises. Even on deaths door he had a beautiful face. You moved down his body, applying pressure to the still bleeding wounds on his abdomen and shoulder. He was still breathing, although it was becoming more ragged as time went on. You thought for a moment, your apartment only a few blocks from where you were now, and foot traffic was light at the moment. Whether it be through pure willpower, or adrenaline, or a combination of both, you had managed to half-carry half-drag the much larger man to your apartment. Holding his muscular arms over your shoulders, you tried to ignore the looks from pedestrians as you heaved the man into the elevator and slammed the buttons as soon as the pup was clear of the doors. The dog sat and smiled up at you, tongue poking out a bit. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re one loyal pup, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; You whispered, sighing as the elevator doors opened and you managed to get the man into your home and onto your bed. The pit bull following John&rsquo;s form and laying at his feet. </p><p>You swiftly and carefully grabbed all of your supplies, a few first aid kits and some sutures for some clearly needed stitches. You began to strip him of his clothes, your eyes widened as you took off his suit jacket and bullet shells rained down onto your hardwood floor. You shrugged it off, more focused on making sure this handsome stranger didn&rsquo;t die in your bed. You set his various guns and knives on your bedside counter. You couldn&rsquo;t help but take a quick second to admire his physique as you striped him of his blood stained dress shirt and tie. He was incredibly strong, but his chest was littered with scars of different ages and bruises all over. You focused your attention on the gaping wound in his side, you gently cleaned around it with a wet cloth, and took a deep breath before applying a disinfectant, knowing it would be painful. You looked up at his face, it contorted in pain and his eyes flashed open for a moment, before closing them again. </p><p>His eyes were brown, they were so warm and chocolatey, you wondered how someone with eyes so kind got himself into this predicament as you began to prep your needle. You took a moment to steady yourself as you began to stitch him up as gently and precisely as you could. He didn&rsquo;t react to the needle piercing his skin so you assume he must&rsquo;ve faded out again. After you finished stitching up and cleaning up his major wounds you let out a breath you didn&rsquo;t realize you were holding. You began to gently wipe some of the sweat and dirt from his face, your body leaning over his. After you were content with your treatment of him, you began rummaging through your closet to try to find some clothes that weren&rsquo;t covered in blood that would fit this tall man. You eventually found some sweatpants from an old ex and an oversized tee shirt. After that you started to run a bath, he was kind of filthy, and you could only do so much with a rag. Just as you got the temperature right you heard a shift on your bed and you whipped around. </p><p>John came to, confused and a first on high alert until he felt the presence of his dog at his feet. He looked around, looking down at his now stitched up and torso and the room he was in. You had a desk with medical textbooks piled up, your laptop next to it. He looked down and saw he had stained your blue bedsheets with his blood, he let out a small sigh as he began to slowly lift his head. He heard water running, and soon saw you peek out from behind the bathroom door. Your cheeks were flushed, hands still had a bit of his blood on them around your nails. Your hair thrown into a low pony tail. How did someone so cute and small manage to get him here? John couldn&rsquo;t help but let the hint of a smile tug at his lips. His eyes met yours, &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; He said simply.</p><p>His voice sent shudders down your spine, it was almost like a growl, so gravelly but yet so sweet. The flush on your face grew redder as you looked at him. You looked to the sleeping pit bull at his feet. &ldquo;You should really be thanking your pup, he led me right to you.&rdquo; You replied, your voice still soft as you approached him. &ldquo;I uh, ran you a bath, I thought it might help with the&hellip;&rdquo; You trailed off as you stared at his various wounds, &ldquo;aches and pains.&rdquo; You finished. Looking up into his brown eyes, you held out your hand, not sure if he wanted help to the bathroom. He seemed to be on the quieter side, as he wordlessly took your hand and with some effort got out of your bed and into the bathroom. </p><p>After getting him situated, you helped him take off his shoes. &ldquo;My name is (Y/N), by the way.&rdquo; You said as you swiftly unlaced his dress shoe. </p><p>He began to undo his belt, &ldquo;John.&rdquo; He said, tossing his belt to the ground. You blushed, unable to resist the dirty thoughts that crossed your mind as he threw his belt.</p><p>You smiled, &ldquo;John.&rdquo; You repeated, finally being able to put a name to this gorgeous face. You stood up, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll leave you to it, John. Just holler if you need anything.&rdquo; You said before leaving the bathroom to give him some privacy. </p><p>You walked into your kitchen, the pit bull following behind you. You smiled and gave him a pat, rummaging around to find him something to eat, you set out a bowl of kibble and some water. You sighed softly, propping yourself up on your kitchen counter. John, that was his name. Even when he was beat to shit he was gorgeous, his beard perfectly framed his face, and his physique was nothing to scoff at. You tried to not think about it as you began to throw together a quick meal for you and John, but you couldn&rsquo;t help it. After all, it&rsquo;s not everyday something like this happens. Why me? You wondered, why did this dog pick you out of everyone on the street? You were glad it was you, you didn&rsquo;t know if everyone was as equipped to handle situations like this, most people would&rsquo;ve just called the cops and been done with it. But you knew he wouldn&rsquo;t have lasted long out there, whoever hurt him was probably still out there. </p><p>Your thoughts were interrupted by the sound of raining water and shuffling as John entered the room, his hair was combed down, dripping with sparse beads of water and his arms glistened slightly under the overhead lighting. He gingerly sat down at the table as you slid a plate and a glass of water towards him, along with a bottle of painkillers. </p><p>John gratefully took them, downing a handful. He turned to face you, eyes staring calming into yours. &ldquo;Why did you help me, (Y/N)?&rdquo; He inquired, his voice smooth and steady. </p><p>You fiddled with your fork, &ldquo;Well, I&hellip; I couldn&rsquo;t just leave you there, you looked like you were on deaths door. I don&rsquo;t even know how you&rsquo;re already up and moving.&rdquo; You said, looking back up at him. &ldquo;I want to help people, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m trying to finish med school.&rdquo; You continued, watching as John mulled over your words. </p><p>He took a sip of water, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to find kind people in this world.&rdquo; He said, he seemed to stare past you as if he was remembering something&hellip; someone. You reminded him so much of Helen, you didn&rsquo;t hesitate to help him when he was in need. You were kind and gentle, and your smile was adorable. He looked down at his plate, he couldn&rsquo;t afford to get attached. He was back in the game, and there was no looking back now. </p><p>He abruptly stood up, &ldquo;John? What are you doing?&rdquo; You inquired, getting up shortly after him and following him back into your bedroom.</p><p>John sighed, turning around to face you. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stay here, (Y/N).&rdquo; He dragged his hand thorough his freshly washed hair, &ldquo;The people who did this to me won&rsquo;t stop until I&rsquo;m dead or I kill them first. The longer I&rsquo;m here the more you&rsquo;re in danger.&rdquo; He explained, beginning to gather his things. </p><p>Your heart dropped, you didn&rsquo;t want him to leave. You felt the need to protect him, you didn&rsquo;t want to see him get hurt again. You continued to walk closely behind him, &ldquo;John, you can&rsquo;t leave, you&rsquo;re still injured and I can-&rdquo;</p><p>He cut you off, &ldquo;I really do appreciate your help, but I have to go.&rdquo; He said, his voice a bit harsher this time.</p><p>You grabbed his arm and pulled him to face you, you laid a hand on his face, his beard hair tickling your skin. &ldquo;John&hellip;&rdquo; your voice was barely above a whisper, &ldquo;Please be careful.&rdquo; You said, your stomach doing flips as you worried about him. </p><p>He suddenly look your face in his hands, his rough hands gently stroking your skin, he pulled you into a kiss. Your eyes widened, then fluttered shut as you melted into John&rsquo;s strong arms, continuing to stroke his beard. He held one hand on your head and one on your hips. He pulled away, leaving both of you breathless. His eyes were dark and lustful, but he knew he couldn&rsquo;t stay. &ldquo;I will.&rdquo; He said, before turning and leaving you.</p><p>You stood for a moment, catching your breath. Something told you you&rsquo;d cross paths with this dark, mysterious man again. You couldn&rsquo;t wait for the next time he&rsquo;d come through those bedroom doors, hopefully this time with less life threatening stab wounds.</p><p><a href=\"https://iwoulddieforkeanureeves.tumblr.com/post/185449671369/it-had-been-about-a-week-since-you-had-seen-john\">https://iwoulddieforkeanureeves.tumblr.com/post/185449671369/it-had-been-about-a-week-since-you-had-seen-john</a></p><p data-npf=\"{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://iwoulddieforkeanureeves.tumblr.com/post/185449671369/it-had-been-about-a-week-since-you-had-seen-john&quot;,&quot;display_url&quot;:&quot;https://iwoulddieforkeanureeves.tumblr.com/post/185449671369/it-had-been-about-a-week-since-you-had-seen-john&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;A Fateful Meeting (Part 2)&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;It had been about a week since you had seen John, but you couldn't get the image of him out of your head.

Today was one of the rare days you got to get off of work early. You began your walk home and started thinking of all the things you wanted to do today. Your thoughts were interrupted by a soft whine at your feet, you stopped and glanced down. Your heart melted, a sweet grey pit bull nuzzled at your feet, you kneeled down and held your hand out to him before softly stroking him. \u201cWhat are you doing out here little guy?\u201d You said softly, the dog almost seemed to comprehend your question as he trotted back from where you came, pausing to see if you followed. </p><p>You sighed, realizing none of the items on your mental to-do list would be checked this evening as you followed this dog. I mean, you couldn\u2019t just leave that lil cutie all alone! Nothing could\u2019ve prepared you for what would come next, you gasped as you turned the corner into a dark, damp alleyway and saw a beaten and bloody man sprawled on the concrete. The pit bull whined again and gently licked at the man\u2019s face. </p><p>You sprang into action, kneeling down beside the man. He was unconscious, his long dark hair was damp and clung to his face that was littered with small cuts and bruises. Even on deaths door he had a beautiful face. You moved down his body, applying pressure to the still bleeding wounds on his abdomen and shoulder. He was still breathing, although it was becoming more ragged as time went on. You thought for a moment, your apartment only a few blocks from where you were now, and foot traffic was light at the moment. Whether it be through pure willpower, or adrenaline, or a combination of both, you had managed to half-carry half-drag the much larger man to your apartment. Holding his muscular arms over your shoulders, you tried to ignore the looks from pedestrians as you heaved the man into the elevator and slammed the buttons as soon as the pup was clear of the doors. The dog sat and smiled up at you, tongue poking out a bit. \u201cYou\u2019re one loyal pup, aren\u2019t you?\u201d You whispered, sighing as the elevator doors opened and you managed to get the man into your home and onto your bed. The pit bull following John\u2019s form and laying at his feet. </p><p>You swiftly and carefully grabbed all of your supplies, a few first aid kits and some sutures for some clearly needed stitches. You began to strip him of his clothes, your eyes widened as you took off his suit jacket and bullet shells rained down onto your hardwood floor. You shrugged it off, more focused on making sure this handsome stranger didn\u2019t die in your bed. You set his various guns and knives on your bedside counter. You couldn\u2019t help but take a quick second to admire his physique as you striped him of his blood stained dress shirt and tie. He was incredibly strong, but his chest was littered with scars of different ages and bruises all over. You focused your attention on the gaping wound in his side, you gently cleaned around it with a wet cloth, and took a deep breath before applying a disinfectant, knowing it would be painful. You looked up at his face, it contorted in pain and his eyes flashed open for a moment, before closing them again. </p><p>His eyes were brown, they were so warm and chocolatey, you wondered how someone with eyes so kind got himself into this predicament as you began to prep your needle. You took a moment to steady yourself as you began to stitch him up as gently and precisely as you could. He didn\u2019t react to the needle piercing his skin so you assume he must\u2019ve faded out again. After you finished stitching up and cleaning up his major wounds you let out a breath you didn\u2019t realize you were holding. You began to gently wipe some of the sweat and dirt from his face, your body leaning over his. After you were content with your treatment of him, you began rummaging through your closet to try to find some clothes that weren\u2019t covered in blood that would fit this tall man. You eventually found some sweatpants from an old ex and an oversized tee shirt. After that you started to run a bath, he was kind of filthy, and you could only do so much with a rag. Just as you got the temperature right you heard a shift on your bed and you whipped around. </p><p>John came to, confused and a first on high alert until he felt the presence of his dog at his feet. He looked around, looking down at his now stitched up and torso and the room he was in. You had a desk with medical textbooks piled up, your laptop next to it. He looked down and saw he had stained your blue bedsheets with his blood, he let out a small sigh as he began to slowly lift his head. He heard water running, and soon saw you peek out from behind the bathroom door. Your cheeks were flushed, hands still had a bit of his blood on them around your nails. Your hair thrown into a low pony tail. How did someone so cute and small manage to get him here? John couldn\u2019t help but let the hint of a smile tug at his lips.

You took a moment to steady yourself as you began to stitch him up as gently and precisely as you could. He didn\u2019t react to the needle piercing his skin so you assume he must\u2019ve faded out again. After you finished stitching up and cleaning up his major wounds you let out a breath you didn\u2019t realize you were holding. You began to gently wipe some of the sweat and dirt from his face, your body leaning over his. After you were content with your treatment of him, you began rummaging through your closet to try to find some clothes that weren\u2019t covered in blood that would fit this tall man. You eventually found some sweatpants from an old ex and an oversized tee shirt. After that you started to run a bath, he was kind of filthy, and you could only do so much with a rag. Just as you got the temperature right you heard a shift on your bed and you whipped around. </p><p>John came to, confused and a first on high alert until he felt the presence of his dog at his feet. He looked around, looking down at his now stitched up and torso and the room he was in. You had a desk with medical textbooks piled up, your laptop next to it. He looked down and saw he had stained your blue bedsheets with his blood, he let out a small sigh as he began to slowly lift his head. He heard water running, and soon saw you peek out from behind the bathroom door. Your cheeks were flushed, hands still had a bit of his blood on them around your nails. Your hair thrown into a low pony tail. How did someone so cute and small manage to get him here? John couldn\u2019t help but let the hint of a smile tug at his lips. His eyes met yours, \u201cThank you.\u201d He said simply.</p><p>His voice sent shudders down your spine, it was almost like a growl, so gravelly but yet so sweet. The flush on your face grew redder as you looked at him. You looked to the sleeping pit bull at his feet. \u201cYou should really be thanking your pup, he led me right to you.\u201d You replied, your voice still soft as you approached him. \u201cI uh, ran you a bath, I thought it might help with the\u2026\u201d You trailed off as you stared at his various wounds, \u201caches and pains.\u201d You finished. Looking up into his brown eyes, you held out your hand, not sure if he wanted help to the bathroom. He seemed to be on the quieter side, as he wordlessly took your hand and with some effort got out of your bed and into the bathroom. </p><p>After getting him situated, you helped him take off his shoes. \u201cMy name is (Y/N), by the way.\u201d You said as you swiftly unlaced his dress shoe. </p><p>He began to undo his belt, \u201cJohn.\u201d He said, tossing his belt to the ground. You blushed, unable to resist the dirty thoughts that crossed your mind as he threw his belt.</p><p>You smiled, \u201cJohn.\u201d You repeated, finally being able to put a name to this gorgeous face. You stood up, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll leave you to it, John. Just holler if you need anything.\u201d You said before leaving the bathroom to give him some privacy. </p><p>You walked into your kitchen, the pit bull following behind you. You smiled and gave him a pat, rummaging around to find him something to eat, you set out a bowl of kibble and some water. You sighed softly, propping yourself up on your kitchen counter. John, that was his name. Even when he was beat to shit he was gorgeous, his beard perfectly framed his face, and his physique was nothing to scoff at. You tried to not think about it as you began to throw together a quick meal for you and John, but you couldn\u2019t help it. After all, it\u2019s not everyday something like this happens. Why me? You wondered, why did this dog pick you out of everyone on the street? You were glad it was you, you didn\u2019t know if everyone was as equipped to handle situations like this, most people would\u2019ve just called the cops and been done with it. But you knew he wouldn\u2019t have lasted long out there, whoever hurt him was probably still out there. </p><p>Your thoughts were interrupted by the sound of raining water and shuffling as John entered the room, his hair was combed down, dripping with sparse beads of water and his arms glistened slightly under the overhead lighting. He gingerly sat down at the table as you slid a plate and a glass of water towards him, along with a bottle of painkillers. </p><p>John gratefully took them, downing a handful. He turned to face you, eyes staring calming into yours. \u201cWhy did you help me, (Y/N)?\u201d He inquired, his voice smooth and steady. </p><p>You fiddled with your fork, \u201cWell, I\u2026 I couldn\u2019t just leave you there, you looked like you were on deaths door. I don\u2019t even know how you\u2019re already up and moving.\u201d You said, looking back up at him. \u201cI want to help people, that\u2019s why I\u2019m trying to finish med school.\u201d You continued, watching as John mulled over your words. </p><p>He took a sip of water, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find kind people in this world.\u201d He said, he seemed to stare past you as if he was remembering something\u2026 someone. You reminded him so much of Helen, you didn\u2019t hesitate to help him when he was in need. You were kind and gentle, and your smile was adorable. He looked down at his plate, he couldn\u2019t afford to get attached. He was back in the game, and there was no looking back now. </p><p>He abruptly stood up, \u201cJohn? What are you doing?\u201d You inquired, getting up shortly after him and following him back into your bedroom.</p><p>John sighed, turning around to face you. \u201cI can\u2019t stay here, (Y/N).\u201d He dragged his hand thorough his freshly washed hair, \u201cThe people who did this to me won\u2019t stop until I\u2019m dead or I kill them first. The longer I\u2019m here the more you\u2019re in danger.\u201d He explained, beginning to gather his things. </p><p>Your heart dropped, you didn\u2019t want him to leave. You felt the need to protect him, you didn\u2019t want to see him get hurt again. You continued to walk closely behind him, \u201cJohn, you can\u2019t leave, you\u2019re still injured and I can-\u201d</p><p>He cut you off, \u201cI really do appreciate your help, but I have to go.\u201d He said, his voice a bit harsher this time.</p><p>You grabbed his arm and pulled him to face you, you laid a hand on his face, his beard hair tickling your skin. \u201cJohn\u2026\u201d your voice was barely above a whisper, \u201cPlease be careful.\u201d You said, your stomach doing flips as you worried about him. </p><p>He suddenly look your face in his hands, his rough hands gently stroking your skin, he pulled you into a kiss. Your eyes widened, then fluttered shut as you melted into John\u2019s strong arms, continuing to stroke his beard. He held one hand on your head and one on your hips. He pulled away, leaving both of you breathless. His eyes were dark and lustful, but he knew he couldn\u2019t stay. \u201cI will.\u201d He said, before turning and leaving you.</p><p>You stood for a moment, catching your breath. Something told you you\u2019d cross paths with this dark, mysterious man again. You couldn\u2019t wait for the next time he\u2019d come through those bedroom doors, hopefully this time with less life threatening stab wounds.</p><p><a href=\"https://iwoulddieforkeanureeves.tumblr.com/post/185449671369/it-had-been-about-a-week-since-you-had-seen-john\">https://iwoulddieforkeanureeves.tumblr.com/post/185449671369/it-had-been-about-a-week-since-you-had-seen-john</a></p><p data-npf=\"{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://iwoulddieforkeanureeves.tumblr.com/post/185449671369/it-had-been-about-a-week-since-you-had-seen-john&quot;,&quot;display_url&quot;:&quot;https://iwoulddieforkeanureeves.tumblr.com/post/185449671369/it-had-been-about-a-week-since-you-had-seen-john&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;A Fateful Meeting (Part 2)&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;It had been about a week since you had seen John, but you couldn't get the image of him out of your head.

Today was one of the rare days you got to get off of work early. You began your walk home and started thinking of all the things you wanted to do today. Your thoughts were interrupted by a soft whine at your feet, you stopped and glanced down. Your heart melted, a sweet grey pit bull nuzzled at your feet, you kneeled down and held your hand out to him before softly stroking him. &ldquo;What are you doing out here little guy?&rdquo; You said softly, the dog almost seemed to comprehend your question as he trotted back from where you came, pausing to see if you followed. </p><p>You sighed, realizing none of the items on your mental to-do list would be checked this evening as you followed this dog. I mean, you couldn&rsquo;t just leave that lil cutie all alone! Nothing could&rsquo;ve prepared you for what would come next, you gasped as you turned the corner into a dark, damp alleyway and saw a beaten and bloody man sprawled on the concrete. The pit bull whined again and gently licked at the man&rsquo;s face. </p><p>You sprang into action, kneeling down beside the man. He was unconscious, his long dark hair was damp and clung to his face that was littered with small cuts and bruises. Even on deaths door he had a beautiful face. You moved down his body, applying pressure to the still bleeding wounds on his abdomen and shoulder. He was still breathing, although it was becoming more ragged as time went on. You thought for a moment, your apartment only a few blocks from where you were now, and foot traffic was light at the moment. Whether it be through pure willpower, or adrenaline, or a combination of both, you had managed to half-carry half-drag the much larger man to your apartment. Holding his muscular arms over your shoulders, you tried to ignore the looks from pedestrians as you heaved the man into the elevator and slammed the buttons as soon as the pup was clear of the doors. The dog sat and smiled up at you, tongue poking out a bit. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re one loyal pup, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; You whispered, sighing as the elevator doors opened and you managed to get the man into your home and onto your bed. The pit bull following John&rsquo;s form and laying at his feet. </p><p>You swiftly and carefully grabbed all of your supplies, a few first aid kits and some sutures for some clearly needed stitches. You began to strip him of his clothes, your eyes widened as you took off his suit jacket and bullet shells rained down onto your hardwood floor. You shrugged it off, more focused on making sure this handsome stranger didn&rsquo;t die in your bed. You set his various guns and knives on your bedside counter. You couldn&rsquo;t help but take a quick second to admire his physique as you striped him of his blood stained dress shirt and tie. He was incredibly strong, but his chest was littered with scars of different ages and bruises all over. You focused your attention on the gaping wound in his side, you gently cleaned around it with a wet cloth, and took a deep breath before applying a disinfectant, knowing it would be painful. You looked up at his face, it contorted in pain and his eyes flashed open for a moment, before closing them again. </p><p>His eyes were brown, they were so warm and chocolatey, you wondered how someone with eyes so kind got himself into this predicament as you began to prep your needle.

What makes no sense to me is how he got blinded when that wire was oressed to his cheek and not his eyes. But aight. Niobi was where it\u2019s at in this film. Maximum badassery.
