Last week took a lot out of me and I\u2019m happy to say I think I\u2019m finally on the other side of whatever bug hit our house. And, in even better news, the rest of the family seems healthy as well. I\u2019m hoping all of you out there are staying germ-free and strong during cold and flu season this year. It seems to be a pretty rough one!</p>\n<h4>Saturday</h4>\n<p>Since our family was all healthy and back to normal energy levels on Saturday, we were thankfully able to make the most of my father-in-law\u2019s visit! He arrived in town on Thursday afternoon and will be staying with us through tomorrow and we\u2019re all grateful he made the trip up to see us. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Saturday\u2019s weather was pretty dreary so we limited our adventures to mostly indoor activities. We spent a decent amount of time around the house catering a bit to the boy\u2019s naps since rest seems to be key for fighting off sickness. Our main plans for the day centered around dinner when we hosted our friend Ben and his family at our house for a rainy evening feast! Earlier in the day, we took the boys out to Whole Foods to stock up on some food for dinner and Ryder had his first experience in a car cart which pretty much blew his mind! \u00a0</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_8214.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-85034\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_8214-865x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"545\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_8214-865x1024.jpg 865w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_8214-253x300.jpg 253w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_8214-768x909.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_8214.jpg 1125w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\"/></a></p>\n<p>I wasn\u2019t sure if he was big enough for it, but once he was buckled in, there was no prying that steering wheel out of his grabby little baby hands.

Last week took a lot out of me and I\u2019m happy to say I think I\u2019m finally on the other side of whatever bug hit our house. And, in even better news, the rest of the family seems healthy as well. I\u2019m hoping all of you out there are staying germ-free and strong during cold and flu season this year. It seems to be a pretty rough one!</p>\n<h4>Saturday</h4>\n<p>Since our family was all healthy and back to normal energy levels on Saturday, we were thankfully able to make the most of my father-in-law\u2019s visit! He arrived in town on Thursday afternoon and will be staying with us through tomorrow and we\u2019re all grateful he made the trip up to see us. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Saturday\u2019s weather was pretty dreary so we limited our adventures to mostly indoor activities. We spent a decent amount of time around the house catering a bit to the boy\u2019s naps since rest seems to be key for fighting off sickness. Our main plans for the day centered around dinner when we hosted our friend Ben and his family at our house for a rainy evening feast!
