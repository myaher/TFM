I just don\u2019t want him to worry about me or anything, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Peter.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, he gathers his suit and mask from where he\u2019d shoved them under the bed the night they got back and <i>(Tony sent a suit to his apartment found the ashes in the kitchen)</i> found out what had happened to the world. It\u2019s still got his blood smeared on it from the fight on Titan, he knows, blended in and hidden in the red fabric.</p><p>He dresses normally except for the mask, leaving the rest of the suit behind, and makes his way out the window.</p><p>From the rooftops, in the day, things don\u2019t look so different. Traffic is thinner, but he can pretend. He can pretend he doesn\u2019t see the damaged buildings where the helicopters crashed, or the spots where buildings stood before they burned to the ground.</p><p>He can pretend.</p><p>He can pretend, and so he does. He pretends all the way the way to the roof of Ned\u2019s apartment building, at which point the illusion falls apart when he realizes if he goes down there, he\u2019s going to have to <i>talk</i> to Ned, and Ned doesn\u2019t know that they\u2019re pretending, does he? He\u2019s going to want to <i>talk</i> about things, and he\u2019ll look at Peter all sympathetically because that\u2019s what people <i>do</i> when they know that whatever fate you were supposed to have is gone and destroyed.</p><p>He goes in a different direction.</p><p>Ten minutes later, he\u2019s tapping on a different window.</p><p>Inside, MJ looks up from the sketchbook on her lap, staring at him through the glass. He gives her a tiny wave.</p><p>She gets up and opens the window, her expression unreadable.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says.</p><p>She turns and walks back to her bed, flinging herself down onto it without looking at him. \u201cYou could have texted.\u201d</p><p>He slips through the open window, landing lightly on the carpet. He hovers in place, not sure if she wants him to shut the window behind him. \u201cYeah, sorry about that. Coming here was kind of snap decision, I wasn\u2019t even sure you\u2019d be here, or if you\u2019d stayed at Harvard, or what\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean <i>now</i>,\u201d she snaps in a brittle voice, and he knows her well enough to hear the hurt in it and <i>oh</i> -</p><p><i>God</i>, he\u2019s a selfish asshole.</p><p>\u201cMJ, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he blurts out. \u201cI should have called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you should have,\u201d she says, sketching so forcefully he can hear the paper tearing beneath the lead.</p><p>He shoves his hands into his hoodie pocket, twisting his fingers together where they\u2019re hidden. \u201cI checked the databases to make sure you were okay. I didn\u2019t just forget about you or anything. I just -\u201d he presses down on his fingers until the bones threaten to snap. The pain grounds him, a little. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just you. If that helps. I haven\u2019t really talked to Ned either. Or&hellip;anyone.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t look up, but her hand stops gouging marks into her sketchbook. \u201cI know. He texted me. That\u2019s how I found out you were alive.\u201d Another ten seconds pass before she huffs a sigh, and pats the bed in front of her. He folds himself onto it gratefully, wrapping his arms around his knees.</p><p>His voice comes out muffled against the back of his legs. \u201cJust \u2018cause you\u2019re alive doesn\u2019t mean you&rsquo;re okay. I should\u2019ve called or texted or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s&hellip;fine,\u201d she mutters. \u201cI mean, no, it\u2019s not fine, you were being a shitty friend, but I\u2019ll give you a shitty friend pass. You only get one.\u201d</p><p>He smiles tentatively at her over his knees, and receives an eyeroll in return. It\u2019s a step.</p><p>\u201cNed said&hellip;your aunt?\u201d she asks bluntly, though he can tell she\u2019s trying to be more delicate than usual.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He swallows heavily.</p><p>She bites her lip hard. \u201cMy mom.\u201d</p><p>Peter lets out a shaky breath, and doesn\u2019t say he\u2019s sorry. They both know. \u201cThat sucks.\u201d</p><p>She just nods in response.</p><p>Carefully, he crawls up to join her at the head of the bed. Giving her plenty of time to kick him off if she doesn\u2019t want him to, he puts his head on her shoulder. A few seconds later, she rests her head against his in return. He closes his eyes, and doesn\u2019t let himself think about anything except the warmth of her pressed against his side. The sound of her heartbeat is more comforting than he could have imagined.</p><p>They sit like that for a long time.</p><p>He moves first, shifting his arm so the sleeve rides up and the scar-like spiral becomes visible. He knows she sees it, the way she sees everything, but she doesn\u2019t say anything. Doesn\u2019t react at all, except to take his hand, squeezing it tight enough to hurt, and it\u2019s deeply reassuring.</p><p>Her own pale butterfly on the back of her hand is easy to see. He doesn\u2019t know what color it used to be. It went pale when she was only two.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever loved her more than he does in that moment.</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna see what I drew?\u201d she says at last, and he doesn\u2019t comment on the fact that her voice sounds hoarse.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he croaks, and she doesn\u2019t mention it either.</p><p>She flips back several pages in her sketchbook. \u201cLook. Wolf-fish.\u201d</p><p>He studies the strange, furry, slightly nightmarish creature with interest. \u201cHuh. So does that make it a mermaid or a werewolf? Werefish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerwolf. It\u2019s not a mermaid because there\u2019s no maid part, and it can\u2019t be a were-anything because it doesn\u2019t change into anything else,\u201d she murmurs matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t the fur slow it down a lot? It doesn\u2019t look very hydrodynamic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s almost extinct. It\u2019s basically the koala of the sea in terms of stupid evolutionary design.\u201d</p><p>He laughs for the first time in weeks.</p><p>They end up coming up with designs for merdogs, mercats, merbirds (which don\u2019t make any sense but look cool), and merhorses (they have one and a half terrible sketches of those before they remember seahorses exist), with her sketching and him giving input that she only ignores about forty percent of the time, which means she\u2019s being nice.</p><p>She kicks him out at nearly sunset. \u201cMy dad will be home soon. He doesn\u2019t spend much time at home&hellip;lately, but he\u2019s been big on us eating dinner together, so\u2026\u201d she shrugs.</p><p>She says it so casually he knows it\u2019s anything but. \u201cHey,\u201d he bumps her gently with his shoulder. \u201cIf you wanna text or call me, I promise I\u2019ll answer now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you better. You used up your one shitty friend card,\u201d she mutters. A moment later she bumps him back. \u201cThat goes for you too, asshole. Also you better come visit again soon. I\u2019m pretty sure school\u2019s gonna be closed for awhile and I don\u2019t have anything better to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I promise,\u201d he says sincerely. \u201cYou can come to the tower too, if you want to just\u2026 get out of here for a bit. There\u2019s a big TV.\u201d He thinks about Aunt May\u2019s apartment that he hasn\u2019t been back to yet, can\u2019t even picture the empty space that now exists there. He understands completely the haunted look that passes across MJ\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that might be cool,\u201d she says. She hesitates for a moment, and then flings her arms around him, squeezing him so tight he can barely breathe. He returns the favor, careful not to break her ribs with his strength. She pulls back at last, scrubbing furiously at her eyes. \u201cSee you soon, bug-nerd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDraw me something cool,\u201d he says, grinning as he pulls his mask on so she can\u2019t see his own glistening eyes.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I always do,\u201d she snorts. She waves goodbye to him through the open window as he climbs down the fire escape. She waits until he reaches the bottom before she shoots him a big grin, flips him off, and slams the window shut.</p><p>He swings away feeling significantly lighter than he did when he woke up that morning. He doesn\u2019t go back to the tower, though. Not yet.</p><p>First, he has one more stop to make.</p><p>He knocks on the door this time, stowing the mask away in his pocket. The door opens a crack, a chain keeping it from opening all the way. The eye that peeks out widens, and the door immediately slams shut again. The chain rattles, and Ned flings the door open again in seconds. \u201cPeter!\u201d</p><p>He offers his best friend a weak smile. \u201cHey, Ned -\u201d is all he gets out before he\u2019s being nearly crushed by another person for the second time that night.</p><p>\u201cWow, so many hugs lately, it\u2019s gotta be the end of the world,\u201d he says into Ned\u2019s shoulder, and then instantly hates himself.</p><p>Ned quickly pulls back to examine him, scanning Peter like he\u2019s expecting him to be injured. Peter rolls his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Ned, I\u2019ve just been a jackass.\u201d He looks him in the eye. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry for ignoring you for like two weeks,\u201d he says awkwardly. \u201cDo you still want to build that Enterprise?\u201d</p><p>Ned grins at him. There\u2019s still concern there, of course there is, but there\u2019s so much relief Peter feels even more guilty for avoiding him. \u201cDude, of course! C\u2019mon,\u201d he waves an arm, inviting him in, and shuts the door behind him. \u201cDad\u2019s at work, they have all the engineers working overtime, with the electrical grid and all that, and my aunt kind of, well, you know, so my mom\u2019s been staying at her place to help my uncle with the kids,\u201d he explains, and then frowns, face twisting in distress. \u201cI heard about Aunt May,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d</p><p>Peter flinches slightly, unable to hide a wince. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna talk about it?\u201d Ned asks uncertainly, and Peter sees his eyes flick to his covered wrist.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cI just want to play with some Legos, if that\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>Ned nods quickly, eyes lighting up. \u201cIt\u2019s up in my room.\u201d</p><p>They hurry up the stairs, and ten minutes later they\u2019re sitting on the floor, surrounded by tiny pieces, and it\u2019s so goddamn familiar and comfortable Peter might just cry.</p><p>They work in companionable silence, only speaking occasionally to see if something is coming together right or to ask the other to pass a piece.</p><p>Out of the blue, Ned stops, and looks at him. \u201cYou know I\u2019ve got your back, right? Like, always?\u201d he asks solemnly.</p><p>Peter blinks at him in shock, then swallows, and nods. \u201cYou know I\u2019ve got yours too, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that you can always talk to me if you want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah man, I know. You\u2019re my guy in the chair, right?\u201d Peter grins shakily, kicking him lightly in the shin.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Always,\u201d Ned beams back at him. \u201cHey, pass me that piece - yeah, the one by your hand.\u201d</p><p>Peter hands it to him, and there\u2019s a warmth in his chest that, for the moment at least, feels a little bit like everything is going to be okay.</p>",

Wolf-fish.\u201d</p><p>He studies the strange, furry, slightly nightmarish creature with interest. \u201cHuh. So does that make it a mermaid or a werewolf? Werefish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerwolf. It\u2019s not a mermaid because there\u2019s no maid part, and it can\u2019t be a were-anything because it doesn\u2019t change into anything else,\u201d she murmurs matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t the fur slow it down a lot? It doesn\u2019t look very hydrodynamic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s almost extinct. It\u2019s basically the koala of the sea in terms of stupid evolutionary design.\u201d</p><p>He laughs for the first time in weeks.</p><p>They end up coming up with designs for merdogs, mercats, merbirds (which don\u2019t make any sense but look cool), and merhorses (they have one and a half terrible sketches of those before they remember seahorses exist), with her sketching and him giving input that she only ignores about forty percent of the time, which means she\u2019s being nice.</p><p>She kicks him out at nearly sunset. \u201cMy dad will be home soon. He doesn\u2019t spend much time at home\u2026lately, but he\u2019s been big on us eating dinner together, so\u2026\u201d she shrugs.</p><p>She says it so casually he knows it\u2019s anything but. \u201cHey,\u201d he bumps her gently with his shoulder. \u201cIf you wanna text or call me, I promise I\u2019ll answer now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you better. You used up your one shitty friend card,\u201d she mutters. A moment later she bumps him back. \u201cThat goes for you too, asshole. Also you better come visit again soon. I\u2019m pretty sure school\u2019s gonna be closed for awhile and I don\u2019t have anything better to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I promise,\u201d he says sincerely. \u201cYou can come to the tower too, if you want to just\u2026 get out of here for a bit. There\u2019s a big TV.\u201d He thinks about Aunt May\u2019s apartment that he hasn\u2019t been back to yet, can\u2019t even picture the empty space that now exists there. He understands completely the haunted look that passes across MJ\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that might be cool,\u201d she says. She hesitates for a moment, and then flings her arms around him, squeezing him so tight he can barely breathe. He returns the favor, careful not to break her ribs with his strength. She pulls back at last, scrubbing furiously at her eyes. \u201cSee you soon, bug-nerd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDraw me something cool,\u201d he says, grinning as he pulls his mask on so she can\u2019t see his own glistening eyes.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I always do,\u201d she snorts. She waves goodbye to him through the open window as he climbs down the fire escape. She waits until he reaches the bottom before she shoots him a big grin, flips him off, and slams the window shut.</p><p>He swings away feeling significantly lighter than he did when he woke up that morning. He doesn\u2019t go back to the tower, though. Not yet.</p><p>First, he has one more stop to make.</p><p>He knocks on the door this time, stowing the mask away in his pocket. The door opens a crack, a chain keeping it from opening all the way. The eye that peeks out widens, and the door immediately slams shut again. The chain rattles, and Ned flings the door open again in seconds. \u201cPeter!\u201d</p><p>He offers his best friend a weak smile. \u201cHey, Ned -\u201d is all he gets out before he\u2019s being nearly crushed by another person for the second time that night.</p><p>\u201cWow, so many hugs lately, it\u2019s gotta be the end of the world,\u201d he says into Ned\u2019s shoulder, and then instantly hates himself.</p><p>Ned quickly pulls back to examine him, scanning Peter like he\u2019s expecting him to be injured. Peter rolls his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Ned, I\u2019ve just been a jackass.\u201d He looks him in the eye. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry for ignoring you for like two weeks,\u201d he says awkwardly. \u201cDo you still want to build that Enterprise?\u201d</p><p>Ned grins at him. There\u2019s still concern there, of course there is, but there\u2019s so much relief Peter feels even more guilty for avoiding him. \u201cDude, of course! C\u2019mon,\u201d he waves an arm, inviting him in, and shuts the door behind him. \u201cDad\u2019s at work, they have all the engineers working overtime, with the electrical grid and all that, and my aunt kind of, well, you know, so my mom\u2019s been staying at her place to help my uncle with the kids,\u201d he explains, and then frowns, face twisting in distress. \u201cI heard about Aunt May,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d</p><p>Peter flinches slightly, unable to hide a wince. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna talk about it?\u201d Ned asks uncertainly, and Peter sees his eyes flick to his covered wrist.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cI just want to play with some Legos, if that\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>Ned nods quickly, eyes lighting up. \u201cIt\u2019s up in my room.\u201d</p><p>They hurry up the stairs, and ten minutes later they\u2019re sitting on the floor, surrounded by tiny pieces, and it\u2019s so goddamn familiar and comfortable Peter might just cry.</p><p>They work in companionable silence, only speaking occasionally to see if something is coming together right or to ask the other to pass a piece.</p><p>Out of the blue, Ned stops, and looks at him. \u201cYou know I\u2019ve got your back, right? Like, always?\u201d he asks solemnly.</p><p>Peter blinks at him in shock, then swallows, and nods. \u201cYou know I\u2019ve got yours too, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that you can always talk to me if you want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah man, I know. You\u2019re my guy in the chair, right?\u201d Peter grins shakily, kicking him lightly in the shin.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Always,\u201d Ned beams back at him. \u201cHey, pass me that piece - yeah, the one by your hand.\u201d</p><p>Peter hands it to him, and there\u2019s a warmth in his chest that, for the moment at least, feels a little bit like everything is going to be okay.</p>",

Thanos wins, and suddenly half the people in the universe are gone, just like that.What happens to the half that\u2019s left?</p><p><b>Words:</b> 2155</p><hr><p>On the fourteenth day, exactly two weeks after what\u2019s come to simply be called The Event, Peter tries to estimate exactly how long he can avoid Ned without being a bad friend.</p><p>As if on cue, his phone buzzes on the nightstand, and he suppresses a groan.</p><p><i>hey peter!! hope ur ok!! dad got me that Lego Enterprise we were looking at! i think mom and him are just really happy we all made it, they\u2019d probs get me a pony if i really wanted it tbh. anywys i havent opened it yet in case u wanted to come over and help me build it!! :D</i></p><p>So far, Ned has texted him every single day since the Event, and so far Peter hasn\u2019t said a word back since the third night.</p><p>Yeah, okay, so whatever the acceptable length of time spent avoiding his best friend is, he\u2019s definitely way past it.</p>[[MORE]]<p>He raises the phone to text back, and immediately falters.</p><p>What the fuck is he supposed to say?</p><p>He spends the next ten minutes staring at the blank text bar on his screen.</p><p><i>Maybe I\u2019ll just text him back tomorrow</i>, he thinks, and nearly puts his phone back down on the desk, ready to roll back over and go back to sleep, even though it\u2019s almost ten in the morning.</p><p>Then, he thinks about what Pepper said to him on the elevator.</p><p>\u201cHey Friday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I leave the tower, can you just\u2026not tell Mr. Stark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he inquires about your location, Peter, I will have to tell him. But no, I am not required to alert him if you leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, good. I just don\u2019t want him to worry about me or anything, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Peter.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, he gathers his suit and mask from where he\u2019d shoved them under the bed the night they got back and <i>(Tony sent a suit to his apartment found the ashes in the kitchen)</i> found out what had happened to the world. It\u2019s still got his blood smeared on it from the fight on Titan, he knows, blended in and hidden in the red fabric.</p><p>He dresses normally except for the mask, leaving the rest of the suit behind, and makes his way out the window.</p><p>From the rooftops, in the day, things don\u2019t look so different. Traffic is thinner, but he can pretend. He can pretend he doesn\u2019t see the damaged buildings where the helicopters crashed, or the spots where buildings stood before they burned to the ground.</p><p>He can pretend.</p><p>He can pretend, and so he does. He pretends all the way the way to the roof of Ned\u2019s apartment building, at which point the illusion falls apart when he realizes if he goes down there, he\u2019s going to have to <i>talk</i> to Ned, and Ned doesn\u2019t know that they\u2019re pretending, does he? He\u2019s going to want to <i>talk</i> about things, and he\u2019ll look at Peter all sympathetically because that\u2019s what people <i>do</i> when they know that whatever fate you were supposed to have is gone and destroyed.</p><p>He goes in a different direction.</p><p>Ten minutes later, he\u2019s tapping on a different window.</p><p>Inside, MJ looks up from the sketchbook on her lap, staring at him through the glass. He gives her a tiny wave.</p><p>She gets up and opens the window, her expression unreadable.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says.</p><p>She turns and walks back to her bed, flinging herself down onto it without looking at him. \u201cYou could have texted.\u201d</p><p>He slips through the open window, landing lightly on the carpet. He hovers in place, not sure if she wants him to shut the window behind him. \u201cYeah, sorry about that. Coming here was kind of snap decision, I wasn\u2019t even sure you\u2019d be here, or if you\u2019d stayed at Harvard, or what\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean <i>now</i>,\u201d she snaps in a brittle voice, and he knows her well enough to hear the hurt in it and <i>oh</i> -</p><p><i>God</i>, he\u2019s a selfish asshole.</p><p>\u201cMJ, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he blurts out. \u201cI should have called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you should have,\u201d she says, sketching so forcefully he can hear the paper tearing beneath the lead.</p><p>He shoves his hands into his hoodie pocket, twisting his fingers together where they\u2019re hidden. \u201cI checked the databases to make sure you were okay. I didn\u2019t just forget about you or anything. I just -\u201d he presses down on his fingers until the bones threaten to snap. The pain grounds him, a little. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just you. If that helps. I haven\u2019t really talked to Ned either. Or\u2026anyone.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t look up, but her hand stops gouging marks into her sketchbook. \u201cI know. He texted me. That\u2019s how I found out you were alive.\u201d Another ten seconds pass before she huffs a sigh, and pats the bed in front of her. He folds himself onto it gratefully, wrapping his arms around his knees.</p><p>His voice comes out muffled against the back of his legs. \u201cJust \u2018cause you\u2019re alive doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re okay. I should\u2019ve called or texted or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026fine,\u201d she mutters. \u201cI mean, no, it\u2019s not fine, you were being a shitty friend, but I\u2019ll give you a shitty friend pass. You only get one.\u201d</p><p>He smiles tentatively at her over his knees, and receives an eyeroll in return. It\u2019s a step.</p><p>\u201cNed said\u2026your aunt?\u201d she asks bluntly, though he can tell she\u2019s trying to be more delicate than usual.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He swallows heavily.</p><p>She bites her lip hard. \u201cMy mom.\u201d</p><p>Peter lets out a shaky breath, and doesn\u2019t say he\u2019s sorry. They both know. \u201cThat sucks.\u201d</p><p>She just nods in response.</p><p>Carefully, he crawls up to join her at the head of the bed. Giving her plenty of time to kick him off if she doesn\u2019t want him to, he puts his head on her shoulder. A few seconds later, she rests her head against his in return. He closes his eyes, and doesn\u2019t let himself think about anything except the warmth of her pressed against his side. The sound of her heartbeat is more comforting than he could have imagined.</p><p>They sit like that for a long time.</p><p>He moves first, shifting his arm so the sleeve rides up and the scar-like spiral becomes visible. He knows she sees it, the way she sees everything, but she doesn\u2019t say anything. Doesn\u2019t react at all, except to take his hand, squeezing it tight enough to hurt, and it\u2019s deeply reassuring.</p><p>Her own pale butterfly on the back of her hand is easy to see. He doesn\u2019t know what color it used to be. It went pale when she was only two.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever loved her more than he does in that moment.</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna see what I drew?\u201d she says at last, and he doesn\u2019t comment on the fact that her voice sounds hoarse.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he croaks, and she doesn\u2019t mention it either.</p><p>She flips back several pages in her sketchbook. \u201cLook. Wolf-fish.\u201d</p><p>He studies the strange, furry, slightly nightmarish creature with interest. \u201cHuh. So does that make it a mermaid or a werewolf? Werefish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerwolf. It\u2019s not a mermaid because there\u2019s no maid part, and it can\u2019t be a were-anything because it doesn\u2019t change into anything else,\u201d she murmurs matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t the fur slow it down a lot? It doesn\u2019t look very hydrodynamic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s almost extinct. It\u2019s basically the koala of the sea in terms of stupid evolutionary design.\u201d</p><p>He laughs for the first time in weeks.</p><p>They end up coming up with designs for merdogs, mercats, merbirds (which don\u2019t make any sense but look cool), and merhorses (they have one and a half terrible sketches of those before they remember seahorses exist), with her sketching and him giving input that she only ignores about forty percent of the time, which means she\u2019s being nice.</p><p>She kicks him out at nearly sunset. \u201cMy dad will be home soon. He doesn\u2019t spend much time at home\u2026lately, but he\u2019s been big on us eating dinner together, so\u2026\u201d she shrugs.</p><p>She says it so casually he knows it\u2019s anything but. \u201cHey,\u201d he bumps her gently with his shoulder. \u201cIf you wanna text or call me, I promise I\u2019ll answer now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you better.

Like, always?\u201d he asks solemnly.</p><p>Peter blinks at him in shock, then swallows, and nods. \u201cYou know I\u2019ve got yours too, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that you can always talk to me if you want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah man, I know. You\u2019re my guy in the chair, right?\u201d Peter grins shakily, kicking him lightly in the shin.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Always,\u201d Ned beams back at him. \u201cHey, pass me that piece - yeah, the one by your hand.\u201d</p><p>Peter hands it to him, and there\u2019s a warmth in his chest that, for the moment at least, feels a little bit like everything is going to be okay.</p>",

But no, I am not required to alert him if you leave.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, good. I just don&rsquo;t want him to worry about me or anything, you know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>Reluctantly, he gathers his suit and mask from where he&rsquo;d shoved them under the bed the night they got back and <i>(Tony sent a suit to his apartment found the ashes in the kitchen)</i> found out what had happened to the world. It&rsquo;s still got his blood smeared on it from the fight on Titan, he knows, blended in and hidden in the red fabric.</p><p>He dresses normally except for the mask, leaving the rest of the suit behind, and makes his way out the window.</p><p>From the rooftops, in the day, things don&rsquo;t look so different. Traffic is thinner, but he can pretend. He can pretend he doesn&rsquo;t see the damaged buildings where the helicopters crashed, or the spots where buildings stood before they burned to the ground.</p><p>He can pretend.</p><p>He can pretend, and so he does. He pretends all the way the way to the roof of Ned&rsquo;s apartment building, at which point the illusion falls apart when he realizes if he goes down there, he&rsquo;s going to have to <i>talk</i> to Ned, and Ned doesn&rsquo;t know that they&rsquo;re pretending, does he? He&rsquo;s going to want to <i>talk</i> about things, and he&rsquo;ll look at Peter all sympathetically because that&rsquo;s what people <i>do</i> when they know that whatever fate you were supposed to have is gone and destroyed.</p><p>He goes in a different direction.</p><p>Ten minutes later, he&rsquo;s tapping on a different window.</p><p>Inside, MJ looks up from the sketchbook on her lap, staring at him through the glass. He gives her a tiny wave.</p><p>She gets up and opens the window, her expression unreadable.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>She turns and walks back to her bed, flinging herself down onto it without looking at him. &ldquo;You could have texted.&rdquo;</p><p>He slips through the open window, landing lightly on the carpet. He hovers in place, not sure if she wants him to shut the window behind him. &ldquo;Yeah, sorry about that. Coming here was kind of snap decision, I wasn&rsquo;t even sure you&rsquo;d be here, or if you&rsquo;d stayed at Harvard, or what&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean <i>now</i>,&rdquo; she snaps in a brittle voice, and he knows her well enough to hear the hurt in it and <i>oh</i> -</p><p><i>God</i>, he&rsquo;s a selfish asshole.</p><p>&ldquo;MJ, I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; he blurts out. &ldquo;I should have called.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, you should have,&rdquo; she says, sketching so forcefully he can hear the paper tearing beneath the lead.</p><p>He shoves his hands into his hoodie pocket, twisting his fingers together where they&rsquo;re hidden. &ldquo;I checked the databases to make sure you were okay. I didn&rsquo;t just forget about you or anything. I just -&rdquo; he presses down on his fingers until the bones threaten to snap. The pain grounds him, a little. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t just you. If that helps. I haven&rsquo;t really talked to Ned either. Or&hellip;anyone.&rdquo;</p><p>She doesn&rsquo;t look up, but her hand stops gouging marks into her sketchbook. &ldquo;I know. He texted me. That&rsquo;s how I found out you were alive.&rdquo; Another ten seconds pass before she huffs a sigh, and pats the bed in front of her. He folds himself onto it gratefully, wrapping his arms around his knees.</p><p>His voice comes out muffled against the back of his legs. &ldquo;Just &lsquo;cause you&rsquo;re alive doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re okay. I should&rsquo;ve called or texted or something.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip;fine,&rdquo; she mutters. &ldquo;I mean, no, it&rsquo;s not fine, you were being a shitty friend, but I&rsquo;ll give you a shitty friend pass. You only get one.&rdquo;</p><p>He smiles tentatively at her over his knees, and receives an eyeroll in return. It&rsquo;s a step.</p><p>&ldquo;Ned said&hellip;your aunt?&rdquo; she asks bluntly, though he can tell she&rsquo;s trying to be more delicate than usual.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; He swallows heavily.</p><p>She bites her lip hard. &ldquo;My mom.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter lets out a shaky breath, and doesn&rsquo;t say he&rsquo;s sorry. They both know. &ldquo;That sucks.&rdquo;</p><p>She just nods in response.</p><p>Carefully, he crawls up to join her at the head of the bed. Giving her plenty of time to kick him off if she doesn&rsquo;t want him to, he puts his head on her shoulder. A few seconds later, she rests her head against his in return. He closes his eyes, and doesn&rsquo;t let himself think about anything except the warmth of her pressed against his side. The sound of her heartbeat is more comforting than he could have imagined.</p><p>They sit like that for a long time.</p><p>He moves first, shifting his arm so the sleeve rides up and the scar-like spiral becomes visible. He knows she sees it, the way she sees everything, but she doesn&rsquo;t say anything. Doesn&rsquo;t react at all, except to take his hand, squeezing it tight enough to hurt, and it&rsquo;s deeply reassuring.</p><p>Her own pale butterfly on the back of her hand is easy to see. He doesn&rsquo;t know what color it used to be. It went pale when she was only two.</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s ever loved her more than he does in that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you wanna see what I drew?&rdquo; she says at last, and he doesn&rsquo;t comment on the fact that her voice sounds hoarse.</p><p>&ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; he croaks, and she doesn&rsquo;t mention it either.</p><p>She flips back several pages in her sketchbook. &ldquo;Look. Wolf-fish.&rdquo;</p><p>He studies the strange, furry, slightly nightmarish creature with interest. &ldquo;Huh. So does that make it a mermaid or a werewolf? Werefish?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Merwolf. It&rsquo;s not a mermaid because there&rsquo;s no maid part, and it can&rsquo;t be a were-anything because it doesn&rsquo;t change into anything else,&rdquo; she murmurs matter-of-factly.</p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t the fur slow it down a lot? It doesn&rsquo;t look very hydrodynamic.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. It&rsquo;s almost extinct. It&rsquo;s basically the koala of the sea in terms of stupid evolutionary design.&rdquo;</p><p>He laughs for the first time in weeks.</p><p>They end up coming up with designs for merdogs, mercats, merbirds (which don&rsquo;t make any sense but look cool), and merhorses (they have one and a half terrible sketches of those before they remember seahorses exist), with her sketching and him giving input that she only ignores about forty percent of the time, which means she&rsquo;s being nice.</p><p>She kicks him out at nearly sunset. &ldquo;My dad will be home soon. He doesn&rsquo;t spend much time at home&hellip;lately, but he&rsquo;s been big on us eating dinner together, so&hellip;&rdquo; she shrugs.</p><p>She says it so casually he knows it&rsquo;s anything but. &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he bumps her gently with his shoulder. &ldquo;If you wanna text or call me, I promise I&rsquo;ll answer now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, you better. You used up your one shitty friend card,&rdquo; she mutters. A moment later she bumps him back. &ldquo;That goes for you too, asshole. Also you better come visit again soon. I&rsquo;m pretty sure school&rsquo;s gonna be closed for awhile and I don&rsquo;t have anything better to do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I promise,&rdquo; he says sincerely. &ldquo;You can come to the tower too, if you want to just&hellip; get out of here for a bit. There&rsquo;s a big TV.&rdquo; He thinks about Aunt May&rsquo;s apartment that he hasn&rsquo;t been back to yet, can&rsquo;t even picture the empty space that now exists there. He understands completely the haunted look that passes across MJ&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that might be cool,&rdquo; she says. She hesitates for a moment, and then flings her arms around him, squeezing him so tight he can barely breathe. He returns the favor, careful not to break her ribs with his strength. She pulls back at last, scrubbing furiously at her eyes. &ldquo;See you soon, bug-nerd.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Draw me something cool,&rdquo; he says, grinning as he pulls his mask on so she can&rsquo;t see his own glistening eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I always do,&rdquo; she snorts. She waves goodbye to him through the open window as he climbs down the fire escape. She waits until he reaches the bottom before she shoots him a big grin, flips him off, and slams the window shut.</p><p>He swings away feeling significantly lighter than he did when he woke up that morning. He doesn&rsquo;t go back to the tower, though. Not yet.</p><p>First, he has one more stop to make.</p><p>He knocks on the door this time, stowing the mask away in his pocket. The door opens a crack, a chain keeping it from opening all the way. The eye that peeks out widens, and the door immediately slams shut again. The chain rattles, and Ned flings the door open again in seconds. &ldquo;Peter!&rdquo;</p><p>He offers his best friend a weak smile. &ldquo;Hey, Ned -&rdquo; is all he gets out before he&rsquo;s being nearly crushed by another person for the second time that night.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow, so many hugs lately, it&rsquo;s gotta be the end of the world,&rdquo; he says into Ned&rsquo;s shoulder, and then instantly hates himself.</p><p>Ned quickly pulls back to examine him, scanning Peter like he&rsquo;s expecting him to be injured. Peter rolls his eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, Ned, I&rsquo;ve just been a jackass.&rdquo; He looks him in the eye. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry for ignoring you for like two weeks,&rdquo; he says awkwardly. &ldquo;Do you still want to build that Enterprise?&rdquo;</p><p>Ned grins at him. There&rsquo;s still concern there, of course there is, but there&rsquo;s so much relief Peter feels even more guilty for avoiding him. &ldquo;Dude, of course! C&rsquo;mon,&rdquo; he waves an arm, inviting him in, and shuts the door behind him. &ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s at work, they have all the engineers working overtime, with the electrical grid and all that, and my aunt kind of, well, you know, so my mom&rsquo;s been staying at her place to help my uncle with the kids,&rdquo; he explains, and then frowns, face twisting in distress. &ldquo;I heard about Aunt May,&rdquo; he says quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter flinches slightly, unable to hide a wince. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you wanna talk about it?&rdquo; Ned asks uncertainly, and Peter sees his eyes flick to his covered wrist.</p><p>&ldquo;Not really,&rdquo; he says firmly. &ldquo;I just want to play with some Legos, if that&rsquo;s cool.&rdquo;</p><p>Ned nods quickly, eyes lighting up. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s up in my room.&rdquo;</p><p>They hurry up the stairs, and ten minutes later they&rsquo;re sitting on the floor, surrounded by tiny pieces, and it&rsquo;s so goddamn familiar and comfortable Peter might just cry.</p><p>They work in companionable silence, only speaking occasionally to see if something is coming together right or to ask the other to pass a piece.</p><p>Out of the blue, Ned stops, and looks at him. &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;ve got your back, right?

Barely anything works, almost everything is broken and it looks like a hospital room. I'd love to move but this damn thing has eaten my entire credit score. I work as much as I can for it and I'm still knee deep in overdraft. I have those money problems so the bank's way of solving it is to keep charging me. Gotta pay that council tax though to help out the town, even though the town doesn't seem to want to help it's self, and really I could just use the help instead. I could of course get a more skilled and highly paid job, sad thing is according to the employers, I'm so perfect for the job role which is why they wish me luck, but they found someone with more experience. Lucky for me I can renew my tenancy at this flat, for \u00a3264.",
