I was itching to write cute scenarios, <i>gah</i>.

I threw the worn blanket on the field and dropped the picnic basket. As if that was his cue, Dodger casually walked over and sat on the edge of the blanket. I turned around and crouched down to Emily\u2019s level.</p><p>\u201cOkay, what did we promise?\u201d I asked.<br/></p><p>Her brilliant blue eyes stared back at me. \u201cNo cookies after eight.\u201d<br/></p><p>I tried so hard to not smile. She had her father\u2019s humor. \u201cEmily Lisa Evans,\u201d I said back sternly, narrowing my eyebrows.<br/></p><p>\u201cI know, mommy. I won\u2019t go off too far.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou promised,\u201d I sighed. \u201cI\u2019m going to tattle on you if you break your promise.\u201d<br/></p><p>After Emily hastily nodded in understanding, I watched as she ran across the sand leaving tiny footprints behind her. Her soft blonde hair blew freely in the salty breeze. She went about six steps before turning around to wave at me with her little hand. I waved back with a smile.<br/></p><p>Emily plopped down on the sand close to the water and Dodger got up from his seat and ran over to her. He sat next to her protectively as she dug her hands in the sand.<br/></p><p>\u201cGood boy,\u201d I whispered.\u00a0</p><p>I turned around and sat down on the blanket. I took off the towel I had wrapped around my shoulder and placed it next to the basket. I felt the warmth against my bare shoulders and back. Adjusting my bikini top, I reached around for the phone I stuck in the basket.</p><p>I had one text message from him.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>I\u2019ll see you soon.</b></p><p><br/></p><p>I put the phone down and looked over at Emily who already had a pile of sand half of her sitting height. Dodger was just lying on the sand watching her. Occasionally, she would take some of the sand and place it on top of Dodger\u2019s paw giggling. Dodger watched her unimpressed.</p><p>It was moments like this that helped me forget about everything else going on in the world. The moments that made me wonder if I had been a superhero in my past life and I was enjoying all the good karma I built up now.<br/></p><p><i>Emily, Dodger, and Chris. I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better daughter, dog, and husband.</i><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWe did well.\u201d<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>I immediately turned at the sound of his familiar voice. Chris was wearing simple khaki shorts with a tight-fitting white t-shirt. He knew I loved the way the fabric tugged over his broad shoulders and chest. In his right hand, he was carrying a small ice box. Smiling, I immediately got up from my seat and ran over. I jumped into his arms wrapping my arms around his neck. His familiar scent of home greeted me and his beard tickled my face.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he whispered into my ear. I heard a small thud as the icebox dropped from his hand to the soft sandy surface. His arms wrapped around my waist and lifted my feet off the floor. He held my body close to him.<br/></p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d I said back and I felt his head burrow in my neck. His warm breath passed through my skin and my heart started to thump in my ears. How badly I wanted to just claw through his shirt right here.<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Y/N</i>,\u201d he said as he slowly placed me down. His crystal blue eyes looked even clearer and bluer in the direct sunlight shining down his face. As he leaned in for a kiss, I heard Emily\u2019s cheerful voice.<br/></p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d<br/></p><p>Keeping one arm around my waist, he easily picked up Emily with other arm and pulled her into a family hug. Emily\u2019s arms barely wrapped around Chris\u2019 neck. The sand from her hands brushed up against his porcelain skin.<br/></p><p>\u201cHey princess,\u201d he laughed as he kissed her forehead.<br/></p><p>\u201cMommy never told me that you were coming!\u201d She exclaimed. Dodger barked and circled around us wagging his tail.<br/></p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d he said after a short pause. \u201cI wanted to surprise <i>you</i>.\u201d<br/></p><p>Emily grinned and rested her head on his shoulders. I softly pat her back like she was our newborn baby again. This moment took me right back to the hospital when Chris held our girl for the first time. I was speechless when I first saw Emily, but I sobbed the first time I saw Chris hold her tiny fragile body in his arms. We stayed like that until Emily lifted her head and looked up at Chris.<br/></p><p>\u201cAre you going to help me build my castle?\u201d She asked.<br/></p><p>He had a permanent smile on his face whenever he looked at her. \u201cOf course, princess. But, can you give me 10 minutes with the queen first?\u201d He nudged in my direction.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Emily nodded granting him permission and Chris set her back down. Dodger was sitting by Chris patiently with his tail wagging, lifting the sand off the ground. Chris gave him a scratch on his head. \u201cHey, Bubba.\u201d<br/></p><p>When Emily ran off again and Dodger followed after her. When she was back at the pile of sand she was gathering, he pulled me closer to him with the same arm already around my waist and kissed my forehead with a series of pecks, one after another.<br/></p><p>\u201cYour queen?\u201d I jokingly laughed at his adorableness as his beard tickled my forehead with each peck. Eventually, when he stopped I wrapped my arms around his waist. \u201cDoes that make you my king?\u201d<br/></p><p>He grinned proudly. \u201cYes, my queen.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI thought of you more like a knight in shining armor kind of deal.\u201d<br/></p><p>His eyebrows furrowed. \u201cThat\u2019s our Dodger, <i>Y/N</i>.\u201d<br/></p><p>I contemplated it for a second and nodded giving in. \u201cFine. But, I honestly thought the secret love story between the queen and the knight would be more <i>sexually charged</i>.\u201d<br/></p><p>He laughed out loud. \u201cDamn, is that what you\u2019ve been up to when your king is not around?\u201d<br/></p><p>I shrugged and in one fluid motion, Chris swept me off my feet effortlessly. He had one arm holding my back and the other behind my knees as he walked us over to the blanket. After softly placing me down, he walked back to grab his small ice box.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d I asked.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you if you pledge your allegiance back to me,\u201d he joked.<br/></p><p>I lifted my right hand up and held it in the air. Then, I placed it over my heart and bowed my head. \u201cMy king.\u201d<br/></p><p>When I didn\u2019t hear a response, I looked up and peeked to find out that Chris had his back turned against me.<br/></p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this, Chris!\u201d I shouted and I heard him chuckle.<br/></p><p>\u201cHold on.\u201d<br/></p><p>When he turned back around he had his two hands together as if he was holding something fragile. I glanced down to find a baby turtle in his hands. It was barely the size of my fingernail.<br/></p><p>\u201cOh my gosh,\u201d I whispered trying to stay quiet as possible. I was scared of blowing it away with an exhale.<br/></p><p>\u201cThe little guy was out by the asphalt. I don\u2019t think he realized that he was heading in the wrong direction.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat do we do with it?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThe lifeguard suggested that I should either place back in the waters or take it home. I was going to ask Emily what she wanted to do.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said back as I leaned in closer to his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s so tiny, Look at its little feet.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t realize how close I leaned in until I looked away and saw Chris\u2019 face inches away from mine. \u201cJust a second,\u201d he said. He moved fast as he placed the turtle back. When he turned back to me, he immediately grabbed me without any hesitation. He leaned in and our lips touched. Our kiss started out cute like a quick \u201cmiss you\u201d text and very quickly progressed to our tongues begging for each other.</p><p>When our lips pulled apart, our forehead remained touching. Our staggered breathing clashed with each other as I held back the urge to pin him down on this blanket. When I closed my eyes, I felt his head move. His lips grazed against mine.</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d he cooed in his deep voice. \u201cI want you so bad right now, <i>Y/N</i>\u201d</p><p>I moved my hands on top of his chest. I felt his warmth against my hands as I playfully tugged at his shirt. \u201cI want you even more,\u201d I whispered back.</p><p>He leaned closer, placed a hand on my back for support and lowered me down until my back touched the floor. He quickly adjusted his body on top of mine, digging each knee by my hips. His palms were by my shoulders holding himself up from crushing me. I lifted my hands and caressed his face, feeling his scruffy beard. His blue eyes matched the picture-perfect blue sky backdrop behind him.</p><p>I grabbed the collar of his t-shirt and tugged it down closer to me. Our lips slow danced together, each one taking turns leading the dance. I felt his fingers trace my collarbone.</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d Emily called out.</p><p>Chris reluctantly pulled away and turned to face in her direction. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m coming!\u2019</p><p>I giggled when he turned back to me. \u201cTo be fair, you know she sat there and counted 10 minutes. She counted to thirty the other day.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows in surprise. \u201cShe\u2019s got your brains,\u201d he said defeatedly. He got up first and reached out a hand and helped me up.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not done. Don\u2019t leave me hanging,\u201d I replied and he grinned.</p><p>\u201cSo, I was thinking,\u201d he said as he took a step on the sand. \u201cHow about another son&hellip; a little Chris since we already have a little <i>Y/N</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris\u2026 you can\u2019t just say things like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I was serious about a big family when we were getting married. One could be the president, one could be an athlete, one could be a doctor\u2026\u201d His voice faded as he walked further away.</p><p>I sighed as I got up and ran over to him. Before I passed him, I stopped to look over. \u201cPresident, athlete, and doctor that\u2019s it. I\u2019m maxing out at three kids.\u201d</p><p>I heard his laughter as he caught up in two full steps and lifted me off the floor with one arm.</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p>",

Our kiss started out cute like a quick \u201cmiss you\u201d text and very quickly progressed to our tongues begging for each other.</p><p>When our lips pulled apart, our forehead remained touching. Our staggered breathing clashed with each other as I held back the urge to pin him down on this blanket. When I closed my eyes, I felt his head move. His lips grazed against mine.</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d he cooed in his deep voice. \u201cI want you so bad right now, <i>Y/N</i>\u201d</p><p>I moved my hands on top of his chest. I felt his warmth against my hands as I playfully tugged at his shirt. \u201cI want you even more,\u201d I whispered back.</p><p>He leaned closer, placed a hand on my back for support and lowered me down until my back touched the floor. He quickly adjusted his body on top of mine, digging each knee by my hips. His palms were by my shoulders holding himself up from crushing me. I lifted my hands and caressed his face, feeling his scruffy beard. His blue eyes matched the picture-perfect blue sky backdrop behind him.</p><p>I grabbed the collar of his t-shirt and tugged it down closer to me. Our lips slow danced together, each one taking turns leading the dance. I felt his fingers trace my collarbone.</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d Emily called out.</p><p>Chris reluctantly pulled away and turned to face in her direction. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m coming!\u2019</p><p>I giggled when he turned back to me. \u201cTo be fair, you know she sat there and counted 10 minutes. She counted to thirty the other day.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows in surprise. \u201cShe\u2019s got your brains,\u201d he said defeatedly. He got up first and reached out a hand and helped me up.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not done. Don\u2019t leave me hanging,\u201d I replied and he grinned.</p><p>\u201cSo, I was thinking,\u201d he said as he took a step on the sand. \u201cHow about another son\u2026 a little Chris since we already have a little <i>Y/N</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris\u2026 you can\u2019t just say things like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I was serious about a big family when we were getting married. One could be the president, one could be an athlete, one could be a doctor\u2026\u201d His voice faded as he walked further away.</p><p>I sighed as I got up and ran over to him. Before I passed him, I stopped to look over. \u201cPresident, athlete, and doctor that\u2019s it. I\u2019m maxing out at three kids.\u201d</p><p>I heard his laughter as he caught up in two full steps and lifted me off the floor with one arm.</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p>",

I threw the worn blanket on the field and dropped the picnic basket. As if that was his cue, Dodger casually walked over and sat on the edge of the blanket. I turned around and crouched down to Emily\u2019s level.</p><p>\u201cOkay, what did we promise?\u201d I asked.<br></p><p>Her brilliant blue eyes stared back at me. \u201cNo cookies after eight.\u201d<br></p><p>I tried so hard to not smile. She had her father\u2019s humor. \u201cEmily Lisa Evans,\u201d I said back sternly, narrowing my eyebrows.<br></p><p>\u201cI know, mommy. I won\u2019t go off too far.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou promised,\u201d I sighed. \u201cI\u2019m going to tattle on you if you break your promise.\u201d<br></p><p>After Emily hastily nodded in understanding, I watched as she ran across the sand leaving tiny footprints behind her. Her soft blonde hair blew freely in the salty breeze. She went about six steps before turning around to wave at me with her little hand. I waved back with a smile.<br></p><p>Emily plopped down on the sand close to the water and Dodger got up from his seat and ran over to her. He sat next to her protectively as she dug her hands in the sand.<br></p><p>\u201cGood boy,\u201d I whispered.\u00a0</p><p>I turned around and sat down on the blanket. I took off the towel I had wrapped around my shoulder and placed it next to the basket. I felt the warmth against my bare shoulders and back. Adjusting my bikini top, I reached around for the phone I stuck in the basket.</p><p>I had one text message from him.<br></p><p><br></p><p><b>I\u2019ll see you soon.</b></p><p><br></p><p>I put the phone down and looked over at Emily who already had a pile of sand half of her sitting height. Dodger was just lying on the sand watching her. Occasionally, she would take some of the sand and place it on top of Dodger\u2019s paw giggling. Dodger watched her unimpressed.</p><p>It was moments like this that helped me forget about everything else going on in the world. The moments that made me wonder if I had been a superhero in my past life and I was enjoying all the good karma I built up now.<br></p><p><i>Emily, Dodger, and Chris. I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better daughter, dog, and husband.</i><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWe did well.\u201d<br></p><p><br></p><p>I immediately turned at the sound of his familiar voice. Chris was wearing simple khaki shorts with a tight-fitting white t-shirt. He knew I loved the way the fabric tugged over his broad shoulders and chest. In his right hand, he was carrying a small ice box. Smiling, I immediately got up from my seat and ran over. I jumped into his arms wrapping my arms around his neck. His familiar scent of home greeted me and his beard tickled my face.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he whispered into my ear. I heard a small thud as the icebox dropped from his hand to the soft sandy surface. His arms wrapped around my waist and lifted my feet off the floor. He held my body close to him.<br></p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d I said back and I felt his head burrow in my neck. His warm breath passed through my skin and my heart started to thump in my ears. How badly I wanted to just claw through his shirt right here.<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Y/N</i>,\u201d he said as he slowly placed me down. His crystal blue eyes looked even clearer and bluer in the direct sunlight shining down his face. As he leaned in for a kiss, I heard Emily\u2019s cheerful voice.<br></p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d<br></p><p>Keeping one arm around my waist, he easily picked up Emily with other arm and pulled her into a family hug. Emily\u2019s arms barely wrapped around Chris\u2019 neck. The sand from her hands brushed up against his porcelain skin.<br></p><p>\u201cHey princess,\u201d he laughed as he kissed her forehead.<br></p><p>\u201cMommy never told me that you were coming!\u201d She exclaimed. Dodger barked and circled around us wagging his tail.<br></p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d he said after a short pause. \u201cI wanted to surprise <i>you</i>.\u201d<br></p><p>Emily grinned and rested her head on his shoulders. I softly pat her back like she was our newborn baby again. This moment took me right back to the hospital when Chris held our girl for the first time. I was speechless when I first saw Emily, but I sobbed the first time I saw Chris hold her tiny fragile body in his arms. We stayed like that until Emily lifted her head and looked up at Chris.<br></p><p>\u201cAre you going to help me build my castle?\u201d She asked.<br></p><p>He had a permanent smile on his face whenever he looked at her. \u201cOf course, princess. But, can you give me 10 minutes with the queen first?\u201d He nudged in my direction.\u00a0<br></p><p>Emily nodded granting him permission and Chris set her back down. Dodger was sitting by Chris patiently with his tail wagging, lifting the sand off the ground. Chris gave him a scratch on his head. \u201cHey, Bubba.\u201d<br></p><p>When Emily ran off again and Dodger followed after her. When she was back at the pile of sand she was gathering, he pulled me closer to him with the same arm already around my waist and kissed my forehead with a series of pecks, one after another.<br></p><p>\u201cYour queen?\u201d I jokingly laughed at his adorableness as his beard tickled my forehead with each peck. Eventually, when he stopped I wrapped my arms around his waist. \u201cDoes that make you my king?\u201d<br></p><p>He grinned proudly. \u201cYes, my queen.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI thought of you more like a knight in shining armor kind of deal.\u201d<br></p><p>His eyebrows furrowed. \u201cThat\u2019s our Dodger, <i>Y/N</i>.\u201d<br></p><p>I contemplated it for a second and nodded giving in. \u201cFine. But, I honestly thought the secret love story between the queen and the knight would be more <i>sexually charged</i>.\u201d<br></p><p>He laughed out loud. \u201cDamn, is that what you\u2019ve been up to when your king is not around?\u201d<br></p><p>I shrugged and in one fluid motion, Chris swept me off my feet effortlessly. He had one arm holding my back and the other behind my knees as he walked us over to the blanket. After softly placing me down, he walked back to grab his small ice box.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d I asked.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you if you pledge your allegiance back to me,\u201d he joked.<br></p><p>I lifted my right hand up and held it in the air. Then, I placed it over my heart and bowed my head. \u201cMy king.\u201d<br></p><p>When I didn\u2019t hear a response, I looked up and peeked to find out that Chris had his back turned against me.<br></p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this, Chris!\u201d I shouted and I heard him chuckle.<br></p><p>\u201cHold on.\u201d<br></p><p>When he turned back around he had his two hands together as if he was holding something fragile. I glanced down to find a baby turtle in his hands. It was barely the size of my fingernail.<br></p><p>\u201cOh my gosh,\u201d I whispered trying to stay quiet as possible. I was scared of blowing it away with an exhale.<br></p><p>\u201cThe little guy was out by the asphalt. I don\u2019t think he realized that he was heading in the wrong direction.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat do we do with it?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThe lifeguard suggested that I should either place back in the waters or take it home. I was going to ask Emily what she wanted to do.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said back as I leaned in closer to his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s so tiny, Look at its little feet.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t realize how close I leaned in until I looked away and saw Chris\u2019 face inches away from mine. \u201cJust a second,\u201d he said.

Then, I placed it over my heart and bowed my head. &ldquo;My king.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>When I didn&rsquo;t hear a response, I looked up and peeked to find out that Chris had his back turned against me.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe this, Chris!&rdquo; I shouted and I heard him chuckle.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hold on.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>When he turned back around he had his two hands together as if he was holding something fragile. I glanced down to find a baby turtle in his hands. It was barely the size of my fingernail.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh my gosh,&rdquo; I whispered trying to stay quiet as possible. I was scared of blowing it away with an exhale.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;The little guy was out by the asphalt. I don&rsquo;t think he realized that he was heading in the wrong direction.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What do we do with it?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;The lifeguard suggested that I should either place back in the waters or take it home. I was going to ask Emily what she wanted to do.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; I said back as I leaned in closer to his hands. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so tiny, Look at its little feet.&rdquo;</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t realize how close I leaned in until I looked away and saw Chris&rsquo; face inches away from mine. &ldquo;Just a second,&rdquo; he said. He moved fast as he placed the turtle back. When he turned back to me, he immediately grabbed me without any hesitation. He leaned in and our lips touched. Our kiss started out cute like a quick &ldquo;miss you&rdquo; text and very quickly progressed to our tongues begging for each other.</p><p>When our lips pulled apart, our forehead remained touching. Our staggered breathing clashed with each other as I held back the urge to pin him down on this blanket. When I closed my eyes, I felt his head move. His lips grazed against mine.</p><p>&ldquo;Baby,&rdquo; he cooed in his deep voice. &ldquo;I want you so bad right now, <i>Y/N</i>&rdquo;</p><p>I moved my hands on top of his chest. I felt his warmth against my hands as I playfully tugged at his shirt. &ldquo;I want you even more,&rdquo; I whispered back.</p><p>He leaned closer, placed a hand on my back for support and lowered me down until my back touched the floor. He quickly adjusted his body on top of mine, digging each knee by my hips. His palms were by my shoulders holding himself up from crushing me. I lifted my hands and caressed his face, feeling his scruffy beard. His blue eyes matched the picture-perfect blue sky backdrop behind him.</p><p>I grabbed the collar of his t-shirt and tugged it down closer to me. Our lips slow danced together, each one taking turns leading the dance. I felt his fingers trace my collarbone.</p><p>&ldquo;Daddy!&rdquo; Emily called out.</p><p>Chris reluctantly pulled away and turned to face in her direction. &ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;m coming!&rsquo;</p><p>I giggled when he turned back to me. &ldquo;To be fair, you know she sat there and counted 10 minutes. She counted to thirty the other day.&rdquo;</p><p>He raised his eyebrows in surprise. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got your brains,&rdquo; he said defeatedly. He got up first and reached out a hand and helped me up.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not done. Don&rsquo;t leave me hanging,&rdquo; I replied and he grinned.</p><p>&ldquo;So, I was thinking,&rdquo; he said as he took a step on the sand. &ldquo;How about another son&hellip; a little Chris since we already have a little <i>Y/N</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Chris&hellip; you can&rsquo;t just say things like that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know, I was serious about a big family when we were getting married. One could be the president, one could be an athlete, one could be a doctor&hellip;&rdquo; His voice faded as he walked further away.</p><p>I sighed as I got up and ran over to him. Before I passed him, I stopped to look over. &ldquo;President, athlete, and doctor that&rsquo;s it. I&rsquo;m maxing out at three kids.&rdquo;</p><p>I heard his laughter as he caught up in two full steps and lifted me off the floor with one arm.</p><p>&ldquo;Deal.&rdquo;</p>",

Beginner\u2019s work at its best. </p><p>Hesitatingly, you sat in your dad\u2019s car parked on the yard. There was still the possibility for you to drive away unnoticed by anyone and forget about this stupid idea. You should\u2019ve stood by your word and not drive here instead to keep an eye on your Aunt\u2019s movie star, yet you had no argument to deny the fact that he was intriguing you. Just as much as the fact that he was another one of those pretty Hollywood guys made you furious. And you had no idea which part overweighted the other. </p><p>To do your father the favor, you told yourself that you need to keep your promise and keep helping your granny like you had planned it for the summer and the bonus was only that you would have your fun with teasing a movie star around. </p><p>Still keeping your eyes on him, you watched him standing slightly anxious in front of the chicken coop as if he wasn\u2019t sure if he should just enter it or if he will hunted down by a dozen of chickens. Your mouth twitched and you hated it. Why was this amusing to you? </p><p><i>A celebrity hunted down by angry chickens</i>, yeah, that would be a title story. </p><p>You sighed, knowing that you didn\u2019t have to kiss ass, but also didn\u2019t have to be an asshole to him. Maybe he could use a little help from you to not completely be a failure. Telling yourself this over and over again, you hopped out of the truck, closing the car door with a slam as you walked straight over to him. </p><p>Chris looked away from the coop straight to your direction, still standing there, not sure what he should actually do. \u201cI thought you wanted to leave,\u201c he said with a nod to you. </p><p><i>Don\u2019t push it</i>. </p><p>\u201cI did,\u201c you replied, stepping closer, \u201cand I actually had no desire to come back as long as you were here.\u201c </p><p>He put his free hand on his heart, crutching pretendedly, saying, \u201cOuch, that hurt.\u201c </p><p>You rolled your eyes. His sarcasm was the only thing hurting here, but maybe you deserved that one. You glanced over to the coop. \u201cYou do know the chickens won\u2019t eat you, do you? You\u2019d be a little too much for them.\u201c </p><p>Chris shrugged. \u201cI know that, but they are still scary.\u201c </p><p>You snorted, taking the bucket from him that he was immediately willing to let go off. At least, he was being honest. \u201cChickens? Scary? No, they\u2019re not. Here, I\u2019ll show you. The ones from Granny are actually very quiet and old, so don\u2019t worry.\u201c </p><p>Before opening the fence gate to the coop, you took a short glance at him. He was this tall-standing guy with the sun-kissed Cali skin, a handsome face and some real muscles, yet he was scared of some chickens? This could potentially turn into some fun then. </p><p>Opening the short gate, you hold it open for Chris to follow you. He closed the gate behind you two without having you even ask him to do so. It didn\u2019t go unnoticed by you, however, you chose not to say anything. It wasn\u2019t worth it to praise him for these little simple things. </p><p>\u201cThey can go in and out of the coop as they choose to because my dad fenced it completely around, but they usually come outside in the mornings after they laid their eggs. It\u2019s fairly easy to get the eggs without getting your hands picked all over.\u201c you explained as you opened the large door to the coop itself. </p><p>You looked around quickly, checking where eggs were laying and then you gathered them together in one swift movement, having Chris watch you do it. \u201cYou check the little nets as I like to call them and then you carefully collect them.\u201c you said, handing him the small, filled basket. </p><p>With a grin on your lips, you added, \u201cThere you go.\u201c </p><p>Chris starred wordlessly at the basket, taking it out of your hand. His gaze went up from the basket meeting your eyes. \u201cWhat made you come back?\u201c </p><p>His question struck you like thunder\u2014quick but powerful. This simple question would\u2019ve sounded simple out of anyone else\u2019s mouth, but he made those words sound like you had been gone for a long time without any hope of ever returning, and it was breaking his heart to see you back. Reminding yourself that he was an actor who should easily awoke feelings like this, which instantly made you not be impressed by it anymore. </p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t let my aunt\u2019s favorite client fail at simple tasks like this. Imagine what it would do to his ego.\u201c you replied, trying to sound carelessly, but failing embarrassingly at it. You were no actress, you had no idea how to overplay a situation like this and not make it awkward. </p><p>Chris\u2019s mouth twitched to a smile. \u201cGuess you can be nice after all, even with the sass.\u201c </p><p>\u201cGuess you don\u2019t know me at all,\u201c</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll have some time to change that.\u201c </p><p>And as simple as that, he walked out of the coop, leaving you speechlessly behind. You wanted to curse yourself for feeling anything from this faked meanings. This was the damned magic of actors, they were able to make anything sound so beautiful that you were left wondering how beautiful his lies must sound like. </p><p>You followed him back to your grandma\u2019s house, stepping inside it without announcing yourself, walking past Max to pet him quickly before going to the dining room where you grandma had just finished everything for the breakfast. </p><p>\u201cY/N, my dear. I thought you didn\u2019t want to come back.\u201c she said playfully surprised, obviously teasing you with a big grin on her face. Chris sat next to her at the table and to your dismiss, he sat right on your favorite spot where you had sat all your life. </p><p><i>That was an argument more to hate him. </i></p><p>Ignoring your Granny\u2019s words, you grabbed a plate set and sat down opposite to him, smiling falsely at him as your eyes met. Your grandma chuckled into her glass of orange juice, overplaying the situation with asking Chris about the chickens. </p><p>\u201cIt went good,\u201c he answered, catching your now angry looking gaze. \u201cY/N was lovely enough to help me out. Admittedly, I was a tiny bit scared of the chickens.\u201c </p><p>Your grandma laughed lovingly. \u201cThat happens to the best, don\u2019t worry. Y/N used to be scared too when she was little. She hated going to the coop.\u201c </p><p><i>How dare she?</i></p><p>Chris was still not breaking your stare off, instead he raised an eyebrow. \u201cOh, did she? Well, she was a brave one today.\u201c </p><p>Looking away from him over to your grandma, she smiled at you with her typical smile that your heart give in and forget any anger. She grabbed your free hand, rubbing her thumb over the back of it. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here to stay. I wanted to show Chris the town but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to drive the truck just yet again. Will you be so kind?\u201c </p><p>There it was again, the part where you struggled. Christopher Evans was probably going to be the reason why you will feel the need to rip your hair out by the end of the week, and still be a darling in your grandma\u2019s eyes, which was why you were doing her this favor. </p><p>\u201cAlright Superstar, ready to see the bright side of this town?\u201c you said with a grin. </p><p>You had never seen him more confused before.</p><p>\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 </p><p>Panic was written all over his face. If he had believed that the roads you took after you had picked him up from the landing place were rough and broken down, he hadn\u2019t seen most roads around here. The country never put their money toward towns like this, which truly needed it to repair simple things like the streets or update the cell service. Living in this small town was like living two decades behind, but you were so used to it that you didn\u2019t mind it when your friends from college couldn\u2019t reach you over the summer. It was freeing in some way. </p><p>Perhaps that was the exact reason why Aunt Susan had sent Chris here. This was undeniably a good place to get away from toxic places or people. </p><p>You didn\u2019t have to play his babysitter. He was fifteen years older than you, he should be able to do simple tasks but time altered differently around here. In fact, you were the true adult here, instead of him.</p><p>Parking your granny\u2019s old truck in the small parking lot close-by the market, you got out of the car, telling Chris, \u201cCome on,\u201c </p><p>The market in the town was every single day. Farmers around here sold their fresh vegetables and fruits and bringing the people together. All in all, the community in this town was great, where everyone kind of looked after one another, however which also meant that there were all sorts of rumors and talks between the neighbors.</p><p>The general age around here wasn\u2019t truly the age of Hollywood, or the ones who kept with the glamorous lives of people like Chris. Most people in this town had no clue who Chris was, and now you were walking around with for them, this tall, handsome stranger. You were already seeing the wildfire spread of rumors. </p><p>Granny was right when it came to your little dates with Brandon, you weren\u2019t really into him and especially this summer, you couldn\u2019t handle to be around him. Your dates over the past summers had been all sorts of friendly fun, however, this summer everything seemed different. He was eager, and probably believing that the two of you would end up marrying each other. </p><p>He would definitely hear about you walking around with Chris. It was silly but if you were already doomed to hang out with Chris, why not cause for some drama? </p><p>\u201cWelcome to our humble little town. The market is great, it\u2019s every day and everything\u2019s fresh. Granny likes to come here most days, so you might go with her the other days. Our town is small, we only have a population of three thousand. Unlike Los Angeles.\u201c you explained, walking ahead while he kept up with you with big steps. The market was in the middle of the small pedestrian zone in the middle of the town. </p><p>\u201cI see,\u201c he mumbled, looking over the filled market. </p><p>You grinned. Everyone came around for the market in the mornings to get the best vegetables for dinner. You gave him a moment to oversee it, before you nudged his side and nodded to the mass of locals. \u201cLook, I know you don\u2019t want to be here, and I don\u2019t want you to be here either, but let\u2019s get it over with and find something for Granny to cook for tonight.\u201c</p><p>Chris sighed, yet he followed you closely. Perhaps he knew that he didn\u2019t really have another choice. </p><p>\u201cDid you grew up in Los Angeles?\u201c you questioned him out of nowhere as you looked around the different stands. You knew he didn\u2019t. His birthplace and hometown came immediately up as you had googled his name the night before, but he didn\u2019t need to know that. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201c he replied. \u201cI grew up in Boston, Massachusetts.\u201c </p><p>\u201cA Massachusetts guy, I see.\u201c </p><p>\u201cWhat about you? Did you grew up here?\u201c </p><p>You stopped at a stand, hesitating for a moment but then you answered his question truthfully, \u201cI wasn\u2019t born here, but my dad came back here with me when I was two. So technically, I grew up here.\u201c </p><p>You greeted Gray, the owner of the stand, who made the usual order of your Granny ready as you handed his wife the money. Before you were able to take the filled plastic bag, Chris came forward taking it, leaving you a little stunned. The bright smile of Gary\u2019s wife made it clear to you that you miserably failed to hide it. She looked with wonder from you over to Chris, who noticed it much later and continued to make it even worse as he interrupted the stare with Gary\u2019s wife to look down to you. </p><p><i>Little drama, yes. Wedding bells ringing drama, hell no!</i></p><p>Barely trying to hide your reddened cheeks, you said goodbye quickly, turning on your heels to walk away. After being far enough away from Gary\u2019s stand, you dared to shoot another question. \u201cDid you always wanted to become an actor?\u201c </p><p>\u201cLooking back, I think it always has been only acting for me. I\u2019m sure I wanted to be a firefighter at some point in my life, but I can\u2019t imagine doing another job than acting now.\u201c </p><p>\u201cI could never imagine myself acting,\u201c you mumbled more to yourself than admitting it to him, but your luck was a son of a bitch. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t knock it till you try it, I\u2019d say.\u201c</p><p>You shook your head. \u201cNo, never in my life.\u201c </p><p>Catching him nodding in your direction, you raised a brow. \u201cThen tell me, what are you doing with your life?\u201c </p><p>This wasn\u2019t the way you wanted this conversation to go. Actually, you didn\u2019t even want to exchange any information about your life with him, but you dumbass had started such conversation that is based on exchanging, and now you had to deal with it. \u201cI\u2019m studying psychology at the University of Tennessee,\u201c you said, stopping in the middle of the market. </p><p>Chris eyed you for a moment, stopping too. \u201cYou study psychology? Why?\u201c </p><p>You shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know, it seemed fitting for me.\u201c </p><p>That was a bland lie. The wish to study psychology had struck you very early in your life, however, this part of your life story you\u2019d never tell him, not even if he wasn\u2019t a Hollywood douche that you had only known for a day. You had no idea if he was buying your lie, or simply having the feeling not to dig any deeper, but you were glad he chose to say nothing.</p><p>You stopped asking him any questions and instead, the two of you walked silently over the market as you placed the orders and Chris taking one bag after the other. Walking back to your Granny\u2019s truck, a wave of misery overcame you. Somehow you were angry at Chris for asking what you were studying. In fact, you were behaving like an asshole, although it wasn\u2019t his fault. You had started the conversation and it naturally went there. It was your own fault. </p><p>You pulled out the keys for the truck out of your pockets as you looked over to the truck. Your luck truly had left you today. Leaning against it was no other than Brandon. </p><p>\u201cOh fuck,\u201c you let out. </p><p>You didn\u2019t care if Brandon was a nice guy or not, you truly didn\u2019t want to speak to him right now. No matter if it was about dating this summer again or the battery of the truck. The misery inside you was yelling at the top of its lungs, trying to prove to yourself that you wanted to be alone. </p><p>Chris\u2019s confused gaze moved from you to Brandon. Suddenly, his hand reached out, grabbing your wrist, making you look at him as you both stopped. A bitter shiver ran down your spine because you knew that Brandon was watching you standing there. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201c Chris asked quietly enough that Brandon couldn\u2019t possibly hear a word. </p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201c you said, but this time Chris was taking this as an answer enough. \u201cIt\u2019s just this guy that I used to go out with when I\u2019m around. He\u2019s not a bad guy, I just\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou just don\u2019t fancy him?\u201c </p><p>You sighed, looking away. \u201cYes, kind of. I just want to go\u2014\u201c </p><p>You cut yourself off as you felt Chris let go of your wrist. A sudden swift movement brought you closer to him. His hands touched your cheek lightly as he brushed your hair behind your ear. The smile on his lips lightened his entire face up, and in this breath of a moment, he looked irresistible. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see how good you can act,\u201c he said, taking your hand in his, finger intwining. </p><p>Your head was spinning. His smile was addicting, and you couldn\u2019t help but smile back at him. You were short of breath, your heart was racing against your thoughts, but instead of having the feeling that you were about to die, you felt more alive than ever before. </p><p>Chris turned back to the truck, still holding your hand while you walked toward it. Brandon\u2019s gaze was burning on your skin, yet nothing changed from the overwhelming confidence you felt out of nowhere. </p><p>\u201cHey Brandon, what\u2019s up?\u201c you said, almost not being able to get out the words.</p><p>Brandon pushed himself away from your Granny\u2019s truck, and you expected him to say something along the lines about the battery, but he was fixed at Chris, who kept up his friendly smile, offering Brandon his hand the next second. </p><p>\u201cHey man, I\u2019m Chris.\u201c he introduced himself so bluntly that you immediately stiffed next to him. </p><p>Although he looked as struck as you probably did, Brandon shook his head, followed by a quiet greeting. Chris must have noticed your struggle as his hips nudged yours subtly, almost as if he was reminding you that you were on cue. </p><p>Loosing up a little, you pressed your lips to a smile, making it visible for Brandon that you were waiting. \u201cI just\u2014I just wanted to ask about the,\u201c he stuttered, pointing to the truck, \u201cum, the battery. Does your Granny want me to order her a new one?\u201c </p><p><i>That was totally not what he actually wanted to talk about. </i></p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019d great. The truck won\u2019t take her anywhere if she doesn\u2019t get it changed soon.\u201c </p><p>You couldn\u2019t even believe yourself. The tone of your voice suddenly had changed to a way too positive sounding one, almost squeaking, the way models always talked like. </p><p>Brandon nodded, still seeming not to wrap his head around seeing you with a guy like Chris, before he walked off without saying another word. Your entire body relaxed from the tension, however, you didn\u2019t feel a bit better. </p><p>\u201cGive me the keys, I\u2019ll drive.\u201c Chris said. No, he more likely demanded, but you weren\u2019t in the mood to put up a fight with him. As well as you gave up the chance of teasing him that he didn\u2019t even know the way back to your Granny\u2019s house. You just let it be and handed over the keys to him, climbing onto the passenger seat the second later. </p><p>In your head, you tried to rewinded the last minutes, trying to find the moment where Chris started acting. From his notice that something was wrong over to his quick response to play something in front of Brandon to scare him away\u2014you were thankful for that. You couldn\u2019t have one of those conversations with Brandon right now, but this action left you more confused than you were before. </p><p>You didn\u2019t like Hollywood guys like Chris, and in these last few minutes, he had reminded you why exactly. </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><a href=\"https://oneshots-heaven.tumblr.com/post/178829793713/time-out-for-a-movie-star\" target=\"_blank\">&lt;&lt; Last Part</a> \u2013\u2013 Next Part &gt;&gt;</p>",

Beginner\u2019s work at its best. </p><p>Hesitatingly, you sat in your dad\u2019s car parked on the yard. There was still the possibility for you to drive away unnoticed by anyone and forget about this stupid idea. You should\u2019ve stood by your word and not drive here instead to keep an eye on your Aunt\u2019s movie star, yet you had no argument to deny the fact that he was intriguing you. Just as much as the fact that he was another one of those pretty Hollywood guys made you furious. And you had no idea which part overweighted the other. </p><p>To do your father the favor, you told yourself that you need to keep your promise and keep helping your granny like you had planned it for the summer and the bonus was only that you would have your fun with teasing a movie star around. </p><p>Still keeping your eyes on him, you watched him standing slightly anxious in front of the chicken coop as if he wasn\u2019t sure if he should just enter it or if he will hunted down by a dozen of chickens. Your mouth twitched and you hated it. Why was this amusing to you? </p><p><i>A celebrity hunted down by angry chickens</i>, yeah, that would be a title story. </p><p>You sighed, knowing that you didn\u2019t have to kiss ass, but also didn\u2019t have to be an asshole to him. Maybe he could use a little help from you to not completely be a failure. Telling yourself this over and over again, you hopped out of the truck, closing the car door with a slam as you walked straight over to him. </p><p>Chris looked away from the coop straight to your direction, still standing there, not sure what he should actually do. \u201cI thought you wanted to leave,\u201c he said with a nod to you. </p><p><i>Don\u2019t push it</i>. </p><p>\u201cI did,\u201c you replied, stepping closer, \u201cand I actually had no desire to come back as long as you were here.\u201c </p><p>He put his free hand on his heart, crutching pretendedly, saying, \u201cOuch, that hurt.\u201c </p><p>You rolled your eyes. His sarcasm was the only thing hurting here, but maybe you deserved that one. You glanced over to the coop. \u201cYou do know the chickens won\u2019t eat you, do you? You\u2019d be a little too much for them.\u201c </p><p>Chris shrugged. \u201cI know that, but they are still scary.\u201c </p><p>You snorted, taking the bucket from him that he was immediately willing to let go off. At least, he was being honest. \u201cChickens? Scary? No, they\u2019re not. Here, I\u2019ll show you. The ones from Granny are actually very quiet and old, so don\u2019t worry.\u201c </p><p>Before opening the fence gate to the coop, you took a short glance at him. He was this tall-standing guy with the sun-kissed Cali skin, a handsome face and some real muscles, yet he was scared of some chickens? This could potentially turn into some fun then. </p><p>Opening the short gate, you hold it open for Chris to follow you. He closed the gate behind you two without having you even ask him to do so. It didn\u2019t go unnoticed by you, however, you chose not to say anything. It wasn\u2019t worth it to praise him for these little simple things. </p><p>\u201cThey can go in and out of the coop as they choose to because my dad fenced it completely around, but they usually come outside in the mornings after they laid their eggs. It\u2019s fairly easy to get the eggs without getting your hands picked all over.\u201c you explained as you opened the large door to the coop itself. </p><p>You looked around quickly, checking where eggs were laying and then you gathered them together in one swift movement, having Chris watch you do it. \u201cYou check the little nets as I like to call them and then you carefully collect them.\u201c you said, handing him the small, filled basket. </p><p>With a grin on your lips, you added, \u201cThere you go.\u201c </p><p>Chris starred wordlessly at the basket, taking it out of your hand. His gaze went up from the basket meeting your eyes. \u201cWhat made you come back?\u201c </p><p>His question struck you like thunder\u2014quick but powerful. This simple question would\u2019ve sounded simple out of anyone else\u2019s mouth, but he made those words sound like you had been gone for a long time without any hope of ever returning, and it was breaking his heart to see you back. Reminding yourself that he was an actor who should easily awoke feelings like this, which instantly made you not be impressed by it anymore. </p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t let my aunt\u2019s favorite client fail at simple tasks like this. Imagine what it would do to his ego.\u201c you replied, trying to sound carelessly, but failing embarrassingly at it. You were no actress, you had no idea how to overplay a situation like this and not make it awkward. </p><p>Chris\u2019s mouth twitched to a smile. \u201cGuess you can be nice after all, even with the sass.\u201c </p><p>\u201cGuess you don\u2019t know me at all,\u201c</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll have some time to change that.\u201c </p><p>And as simple as that, he walked out of the coop, leaving you speechlessly behind. You wanted to curse yourself for feeling anything from this faked meanings. This was the damned magic of actors, they were able to make anything sound so beautiful that you were left wondering how beautiful his lies must sound like. </p><p>You followed him back to your grandma\u2019s house, stepping inside it without announcing yourself, walking past Max to pet him quickly before going to the dining room where you grandma had just finished everything for the breakfast. </p><p>\u201cY/N, my dear. I thought you didn\u2019t want to come back.\u201c she said playfully surprised, obviously teasing you with a big grin on her face. Chris sat next to her at the table and to your dismiss, he sat right on your favorite spot where you had sat all your life. </p><p><i>That was an argument more to hate him. </i></p><p>Ignoring your Granny\u2019s words, you grabbed a plate set and sat down opposite to him, smiling falsely at him as your eyes met. Your grandma chuckled into her glass of orange juice, overplaying the situation with asking Chris about the chickens. </p><p>\u201cIt went good,\u201c he answered, catching your now angry looking gaze. \u201cY/N was lovely enough to help me out. Admittedly, I was a tiny bit scared of the chickens.\u201c </p><p>Your grandma laughed lovingly. \u201cThat happens to the best, don\u2019t worry. Y/N used to be scared too when she was little. She hated going to the coop.\u201c </p><p><i>How dare she?</i></p><p>Chris was still not breaking your stare off, instead he raised an eyebrow. \u201cOh, did she? Well, she was a brave one today.\u201c </p><p>Looking away from him over to your grandma, she smiled at you with her typical smile that your heart give in and forget any anger. She grabbed your free hand, rubbing her thumb over the back of it. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here to stay. I wanted to show Chris the town but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to drive the truck just yet again. Will you be so kind?\u201c </p><p>There it was again, the part where you struggled. Christopher Evans was probably going to be the reason why you will feel the need to rip your hair out by the end of the week, and still be a darling in your grandma\u2019s eyes, which was why you were doing her this favor. </p><p>\u201cAlright Superstar, ready to see the bright side of this town?\u201c you said with a grin. </p><p>You had never seen him more confused before.</p><p>\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 </p><p>Panic was written all over his face. If he had believed that the roads you took after you had picked him up from the landing place were rough and broken down, he hadn\u2019t seen most roads around here. The country never put their money toward towns like this, which truly needed it to repair simple things like the streets or update the cell service. Living in this small town was like living two decades behind, but you were so used to it that you didn\u2019t mind it when your friends from college couldn\u2019t reach you over the summer. It was freeing in some way. </p><p>Perhaps that was the exact reason why Aunt Susan had sent Chris here. This was undeniably a good place to get away from toxic places or people. </p><p>You didn\u2019t have to play his babysitter. He was fifteen years older than you, he should be able to do simple tasks but time altered differently around here. In fact, you were the true adult here, instead of him.</p><p>Parking your granny\u2019s old truck in the small parking lot close-by the market, you got out of the car, telling Chris, \u201cCome on,\u201c </p><p>The market in the town was every single day. Farmers around here sold their fresh vegetables and fruits and bringing the people together. All in all, the community in this town was great, where everyone kind of looked after one another, however which also meant that there were all sorts of rumors and talks between the neighbors.</p><p>The general age around here wasn\u2019t truly the age of Hollywood, or the ones who kept with the glamorous lives of people like Chris. Most people in this town had no clue who Chris was, and now you were walking around with for them, this tall, handsome stranger. You were already seeing the wildfire spread of rumors. </p><p>Granny was right when it came to your little dates with Brandon, you weren\u2019t really into him and especially this summer, you couldn\u2019t handle to be around him. Your dates over the past summers had been all sorts of friendly fun, however, this summer everything seemed different. He was eager, and probably believing that the two of you would end up marrying each other. </p><p>He would definitely hear about you walking around with Chris. It was silly but if you were already doomed to hang out with Chris, why not cause for some drama? </p><p>\u201cWelcome to our humble little town. The market is great, it\u2019s every day and everything\u2019s fresh. Granny likes to come here most days, so you might go with her the other days. Our town is small, we only have a population of three thousand. Unlike Los Angeles.\u201c you explained, walking ahead while he kept up with you with big steps. The market was in the middle of the small pedestrian zone in the middle of the town. </p><p>\u201cI see,\u201c he mumbled, looking over the filled market. </p><p>You grinned. Everyone came around for the market in the mornings to get the best vegetables for dinner. You gave him a moment to oversee it, before you nudged his side and nodded to the mass of locals. \u201cLook, I know you don\u2019t want to be here, and I don\u2019t want you to be here either, but let\u2019s get it over with and find something for Granny to cook for tonight.\u201c</p><p>Chris sighed, yet he followed you closely. Perhaps he knew that he didn\u2019t really have another choice. </p><p>\u201cDid you grew up in Los Angeles?\u201c you questioned him out of nowhere as you looked around the different stands. You knew he didn\u2019t. His birthplace and hometown came immediately up as you had googled his name the night before, but he didn\u2019t need to know that. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201c he replied. \u201cI grew up in Boston, Massachusetts.\u201c </p><p>\u201cA Massachusetts guy, I see.\u201c </p><p>\u201cWhat about you? Did you grew up here?\u201c </p><p>You stopped at a stand, hesitating for a moment but then you answered his question truthfully, \u201cI wasn\u2019t born here, but my dad came back here with me when I was two. So technically, I grew up here.\u201c </p><p>You greeted Gray, the owner of the stand, who made the usual order of your Granny ready as you handed his wife the money. Before you were able to take the filled plastic bag, Chris came forward taking it, leaving you a little stunned. The bright smile of Gary\u2019s wife made it clear to you that you miserably failed to hide it. She looked with wonder from you over to Chris, who noticed it much later and continued to make it even worse as he interrupted the stare with Gary\u2019s wife to look down to you. </p><p><i>Little drama, yes. Wedding bells ringing drama, hell no!</i></p><p>Barely trying to hide your reddened cheeks, you said goodbye quickly, turning on your heels to walk away. After being far enough away from Gary\u2019s stand, you dared to shoot another question. \u201cDid you always wanted to become an actor?\u201c </p><p>\u201cLooking back, I think it always has been only acting for me. I\u2019m sure I wanted to be a firefighter at some point in my life, but I can\u2019t imagine doing another job than acting now.\u201c </p><p>\u201cI could never imagine myself acting,\u201c you mumbled more to yourself than admitting it to him, but your luck was a son of a bitch. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t knock it till you try it, I\u2019d say.\u201c</p><p>You shook your head. \u201cNo, never in my life.\u201c </p><p>Catching him nodding in your direction, you raised a brow. \u201cThen tell me, what are you doing with your life?\u201c </p><p>This wasn\u2019t the way you wanted this conversation to go. Actually, you didn\u2019t even want to exchange any information about your life with him, but you dumbass had started such conversation that is based on exchanging, and now you had to deal with it. \u201cI\u2019m studying psychology at the University of Tennessee,\u201c you said, stopping in the middle of the market. </p><p>Chris eyed you for a moment, stopping too. \u201cYou study psychology? Why?\u201c </p><p>You shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know, it seemed fitting for me.\u201c </p><p>That was a bland lie. The wish to study psychology had struck you very early in your life, however, this part of your life story you\u2019d never tell him, not even if he wasn\u2019t a Hollywood douche that you had only known for a day. You had no idea if he was buying your lie, or simply having the feeling not to dig any deeper, but you were glad he chose to say nothing.</p><p>You stopped asking him any questions and instead, the two of you walked silently over the market as you placed the orders and Chris taking one bag after the other.

In fact, you were behaving like an asshole, although it wasn\u2019t his fault. You had started the conversation and it naturally went there. It was your own fault. </p><p>You pulled out the keys for the truck out of your pockets as you looked over to the truck. Your luck truly had left you today. Leaning against it was no other than Brandon. </p><p>\u201cOh fuck,\u201c you let out. </p><p>You didn\u2019t care if Brandon was a nice guy or not, you truly didn\u2019t want to speak to him right now. No matter if it was about dating this summer again or the battery of the truck. The misery inside you was yelling at the top of its lungs, trying to prove to yourself that you wanted to be alone. </p><p>Chris\u2019s confused gaze moved from you to Brandon. Suddenly, his hand reached out, grabbing your wrist, making you look at him as you both stopped. A bitter shiver ran down your spine because you knew that Brandon was watching you standing there. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201c Chris asked quietly enough that Brandon couldn\u2019t possibly hear a word. </p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201c you said, but this time Chris was taking this as an answer enough. \u201cIt\u2019s just this guy that I used to go out with when I\u2019m around. He\u2019s not a bad guy, I just\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou just don\u2019t fancy him?\u201c </p><p>You sighed, looking away. \u201cYes, kind of. I just want to go\u2014\u201c </p><p>You cut yourself off as you felt Chris let go of your wrist. A sudden swift movement brought you closer to him. His hands touched your cheek lightly as he brushed your hair behind your ear. The smile on his lips lightened his entire face up, and in this breath of a moment, he looked irresistible. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see how good you can act,\u201c he said, taking your hand in his, finger intwining. </p><p>Your head was spinning. His smile was addicting, and you couldn\u2019t help but smile back at him. You were short of breath, your heart was racing against your thoughts, but instead of having the feeling that you were about to die, you felt more alive than ever before. </p><p>Chris turned back to the truck, still holding your hand while you walked toward it. Brandon\u2019s gaze was burning on your skin, yet nothing changed from the overwhelming confidence you felt out of nowhere. </p><p>\u201cHey Brandon, what\u2019s up?\u201c you said, almost not being able to get out the words.</p><p>Brandon pushed himself away from your Granny\u2019s truck, and you expected him to say something along the lines about the battery, but he was fixed at Chris, who kept up his friendly smile, offering Brandon his hand the next second. </p><p>\u201cHey man, I\u2019m Chris.\u201c he introduced himself so bluntly that you immediately stiffed next to him. </p><p>Although he looked as struck as you probably did, Brandon shook his head, followed by a quiet greeting. Chris must have noticed your struggle as his hips nudged yours subtly, almost as if he was reminding you that you were on cue. </p><p>Loosing up a little, you pressed your lips to a smile, making it visible for Brandon that you were waiting. \u201cI just\u2014I just wanted to ask about the,\u201c he stuttered, pointing to the truck, \u201cum, the battery. Does your Granny want me to order her a new one?\u201c </p><p><i>That was totally not what he actually wanted to talk about. </i></p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019d great. The truck won\u2019t take her anywhere if she doesn\u2019t get it changed soon.\u201c </p><p>You couldn\u2019t even believe yourself. The tone of your voice suddenly had changed to a way too positive sounding one, almost squeaking, the way models always talked like. </p><p>Brandon nodded, still seeming not to wrap his head around seeing you with a guy like Chris, before he walked off without saying another word. Your entire body relaxed from the tension, however, you didn\u2019t feel a bit better. </p><p>\u201cGive me the keys, I\u2019ll drive.\u201c Chris said. No, he more likely demanded, but you weren\u2019t in the mood to put up a fight with him. As well as you gave up the chance of teasing him that he didn\u2019t even know the way back to your Granny\u2019s house. You just let it be and handed over the keys to him, climbing onto the passenger seat the second later. </p><p>In your head, you tried to rewinded the last minutes, trying to find the moment where Chris started acting. From his notice that something was wrong over to his quick response to play something in front of Brandon to scare him away\u2014you were thankful for that. You couldn\u2019t have one of those conversations with Brandon right now, but this action left you more confused than you were before. </p><p>You didn\u2019t like Hollywood guys like Chris, and in these last few minutes, he had reminded you why exactly. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://oneshots-heaven.tumblr.com/post/178829793713/time-out-for-a-movie-star\" target=\"_blank\">&lt;&lt; Last Part</a> \u2013\u2013 Next Part &gt;&gt;</p></p>",

Beginner\u2019s work at its best. </p><p>Hesitatingly, you sat in your dad\u2019s car parked on the yard. There was still the possibility for you to drive away unnoticed by anyone and forget about this stupid idea. You should\u2019ve stood by your word and not drive here instead to keep an eye on your Aunt\u2019s movie star, yet you had no argument to deny the fact that he was intriguing you. Just as much as the fact that he was another one of those pretty Hollywood guys made you furious. And you had no idea which part overweighted the other. </p><p>To do your father the favor, you told yourself that you need to keep your promise and keep helping your granny like you had planned it for the summer and the bonus was only that you would have your fun with teasing a movie star around. </p><p>Still keeping your eyes on him, you watched him standing slightly anxious in front of the chicken coop as if he wasn\u2019t sure if he should just enter it or if he will hunted down by a dozen of chickens. Your mouth twitched and you hated it. Why was this amusing to you? </p><p><i>A celebrity hunted down by angry chickens</i>, yeah, that would be a title story. </p><p>You sighed, knowing that you didn\u2019t have to kiss ass, but also didn\u2019t have to be an asshole to him. Maybe he could use a little help from you to not completely be a failure. Telling yourself this over and over again, you hopped out of the truck, closing the car door with a slam as you walked straight over to him. </p><p>Chris looked away from the coop straight to your direction, still standing there, not sure what he should actually do. \u201cI thought you wanted to leave,\u201c he said with a nod to you. </p><p><i>Don\u2019t push it</i>. </p><p>\u201cI did,\u201c you replied, stepping closer, \u201cand I actually had no desire to come back as long as you were here.\u201c </p><p>He put his free hand on his heart, crutching pretendedly, saying, \u201cOuch, that hurt.\u201c </p><p>You rolled your eyes. His sarcasm was the only thing hurting here, but maybe you deserved that one. You glanced over to the coop. \u201cYou do know the chickens won\u2019t eat you, do you? You\u2019d be a little too much for them.\u201c </p><p>Chris shrugged. \u201cI know that, but they are still scary.\u201c </p><p>You snorted, taking the bucket from him that he was immediately willing to let go off. At least, he was being honest. \u201cChickens? Scary? No, they\u2019re not. Here, I\u2019ll show you. The ones from Granny are actually very quiet and old, so don\u2019t worry.\u201c </p><p>Before opening the fence gate to the coop, you took a short glance at him. He was this tall-standing guy with the sun-kissed Cali skin, a handsome face and some real muscles, yet he was scared of some chickens? This could potentially turn into some fun then. </p><p>Opening the short gate, you hold it open for Chris to follow you. He closed the gate behind you two without having you even ask him to do so. It didn\u2019t go unnoticed by you, however, you chose not to say anything. It wasn\u2019t worth it to praise him for these little simple things. </p><p>\u201cThey can go in and out of the coop as they choose to because my dad fenced it completely around, but they usually come outside in the mornings after they laid their eggs. It\u2019s fairly easy to get the eggs without getting your hands picked all over.\u201c you explained as you opened the large door to the coop itself. </p><p>You looked around quickly, checking where eggs were laying and then you gathered them together in one swift movement, having Chris watch you do it. \u201cYou check the little nets as I like to call them and then you carefully collect them.\u201c you said, handing him the small, filled basket. </p><p>With a grin on your lips, you added, \u201cThere you go.\u201c </p><p>Chris starred wordlessly at the basket, taking it out of your hand. His gaze went up from the basket meeting your eyes. \u201cWhat made you come back?\u201c </p><p>His question struck you like thunder\u2014quick but powerful. This simple question would\u2019ve sounded simple out of anyone else\u2019s mouth, but he made those words sound like you had been gone for a long time without any hope of ever returning, and it was breaking his heart to see you back. Reminding yourself that he was an actor who should easily awoke feelings like this, which instantly made you not be impressed by it anymore. </p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t let my aunt\u2019s favorite client fail at simple tasks like this. Imagine what it would do to his ego.\u201c you replied, trying to sound carelessly, but failing embarrassingly at it. You were no actress, you had no idea how to overplay a situation like this and not make it awkward. </p><p>Chris\u2019s mouth twitched to a smile. \u201cGuess you can be nice after all, even with the sass.\u201c </p><p>\u201cGuess you don\u2019t know me at all,\u201c</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll have some time to change that.\u201c </p><p>And as simple as that, he walked out of the coop, leaving you speechlessly behind. You wanted to curse yourself for feeling anything from this faked meanings. This was the damned magic of actors, they were able to make anything sound so beautiful that you were left wondering how beautiful his lies must sound like. </p><p>You followed him back to your grandma\u2019s house, stepping inside it without announcing yourself, walking past Max to pet him quickly before going to the dining room where you grandma had just finished everything for the breakfast. </p><p>\u201cY/N, my dear. I thought you didn\u2019t want to come back.\u201c she said playfully surprised, obviously teasing you with a big grin on her face. Chris sat next to her at the table and to your dismiss, he sat right on your favorite spot where you had sat all your life. </p><p><i>That was an argument more to hate him. </i></p><p>Ignoring your Granny\u2019s words, you grabbed a plate set and sat down opposite to him, smiling falsely at him as your eyes met. Your grandma chuckled into her glass of orange juice, overplaying the situation with asking Chris about the chickens. </p><p>\u201cIt went good,\u201c he answered, catching your now angry looking gaze. \u201cY/N was lovely enough to help me out. Admittedly, I was a tiny bit scared of the chickens.\u201c </p><p>Your grandma laughed lovingly. \u201cThat happens to the best, don\u2019t worry. Y/N used to be scared too when she was little. She hated going to the coop.\u201c </p><p><i>How dare she?</i></p><p>Chris was still not breaking your stare off, instead he raised an eyebrow. \u201cOh, did she? Well, she was a brave one today.\u201c </p><p>Looking away from him over to your grandma, she smiled at you with her typical smile that your heart give in and forget any anger. She grabbed your free hand, rubbing her thumb over the back of it. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here to stay. I wanted to show Chris the town but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to drive the truck just yet again. Will you be so kind?\u201c </p><p>There it was again, the part where you struggled. Christopher Evans was probably going to be the reason why you will feel the need to rip your hair out by the end of the week, and still be a darling in your grandma\u2019s eyes, which was why you were doing her this favor. </p><p>\u201cAlright Superstar, ready to see the bright side of this town?\u201c you said with a grin. </p><p>You had never seen him more confused before.</p><p>\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 </p><p>Panic was written all over his face. If he had believed that the roads you took after you had picked him up from the landing place were rough and broken down, he hadn\u2019t seen most roads around here. The country never put their money toward towns like this, which truly needed it to repair simple things like the streets or update the cell service. Living in this small town was like living two decades behind, but you were so used to it that you didn\u2019t mind it when your friends from college couldn\u2019t reach you over the summer. It was freeing in some way. </p><p>Perhaps that was the exact reason why Aunt Susan had sent Chris here. This was undeniably a good place to get away from toxic places or people. </p><p>You didn\u2019t have to play his babysitter. He was fifteen years older than you, he should be able to do simple tasks but time altered differently around here. In fact, you were the true adult here, instead of him.</p><p>Parking your granny\u2019s old truck in the small parking lot close-by the market, you got out of the car, telling Chris, \u201cCome on,\u201c </p><p>The market in the town was every single day. Farmers around here sold their fresh vegetables and fruits and bringing the people together. All in all, the community in this town was great, where everyone kind of looked after one another, however which also meant that there were all sorts of rumors and talks between the neighbors.</p><p>The general age around here wasn\u2019t truly the age of Hollywood, or the ones who kept with the glamorous lives of people like Chris. Most people in this town had no clue who Chris was, and now you were walking around with for them, this tall, handsome stranger. You were already seeing the wildfire spread of rumors. </p><p>Granny was right when it came to your little dates with Brandon, you weren\u2019t really into him and especially this summer, you couldn\u2019t handle to be around him. Your dates over the past summers had been all sorts of friendly fun, however, this summer everything seemed different. He was eager, and probably believing that the two of you would end up marrying each other. </p><p>He would definitely hear about you walking around with Chris. It was silly but if you were already doomed to hang out with Chris, why not cause for some drama? </p><p>\u201cWelcome to our humble little town. The market is great, it\u2019s every day and everything\u2019s fresh. Granny likes to come here most days, so you might go with her the other days. Our town is small, we only have a population of three thousand. Unlike Los Angeles.\u201c you explained, walking ahead while he kept up with you with big steps. The market was in the middle of the small pedestrian zone in the middle of the town. </p><p>\u201cI see,\u201c he mumbled, looking over the filled market. </p><p>You grinned. Everyone came around for the market in the mornings to get the best vegetables for dinner. You gave him a moment to oversee it, before you nudged his side and nodded to the mass of locals. \u201cLook, I know you don\u2019t want to be here, and I don\u2019t want you to be here either, but let\u2019s get it over with and find something for Granny to cook for tonight.\u201c</p><p>Chris sighed, yet he followed you closely. Perhaps he knew that he didn\u2019t really have another choice. </p><p>\u201cDid you grew up in Los Angeles?\u201c you questioned him out of nowhere as you looked around the different stands. You knew he didn\u2019t. His birthplace and hometown came immediately up as you had googled his name the night before, but he didn\u2019t need to know that. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201c he replied. \u201cI grew up in Boston, Massachusetts.\u201c </p><p>\u201cA Massachusetts guy, I see.\u201c </p><p>\u201cWhat about you? Did you grew up here?\u201c </p><p>You stopped at a stand, hesitating for a moment but then you answered his question truthfully, \u201cI wasn\u2019t born here, but my dad came back here with me when I was two. So technically, I grew up here.\u201c </p><p>You greeted Gray, the owner of the stand, who made the usual order of your Granny ready as you handed his wife the money. Before you were able to take the filled plastic bag, Chris came forward taking it, leaving you a little stunned. The bright smile of Gary\u2019s wife made it clear to you that you miserably failed to hide it. She looked with wonder from you over to Chris, who noticed it much later and continued to make it even worse as he interrupted the stare with Gary\u2019s wife to look down to you. </p><p><i>Little drama, yes. Wedding bells ringing drama, hell no!</i></p><p>Barely trying to hide your reddened cheeks, you said goodbye quickly, turning on your heels to walk away. After being far enough away from Gary\u2019s stand, you dared to shoot another question. \u201cDid you always wanted to become an actor?\u201c </p><p>\u201cLooking back, I think it always has been only acting for me. I\u2019m sure I wanted to be a firefighter at some point in my life, but I can\u2019t imagine doing another job than acting now.\u201c </p><p>\u201cI could never imagine myself acting,\u201c you mumbled more to yourself than admitting it to him, but your luck was a son of a bitch. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t knock it till you try it, I\u2019d say.\u201c</p><p>You shook your head. \u201cNo, never in my life.\u201c </p><p>Catching him nodding in your direction, you raised a brow. \u201cThen tell me, what are you doing with your life?\u201c </p><p>This wasn\u2019t the way you wanted this conversation to go. Actually, you didn\u2019t even want to exchange any information about your life with him, but you dumbass had started such conversation that is based on exchanging, and now you had to deal with it. \u201cI\u2019m studying psychology at the University of Tennessee,\u201c you said, stopping in the middle of the market. </p><p>Chris eyed you for a moment, stopping too. \u201cYou study psychology? Why?\u201c </p><p>You shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know, it seemed fitting for me.\u201c </p><p>That was a bland lie. The wish to study psychology had struck you very early in your life, however, this part of your life story you\u2019d never tell him, not even if he wasn\u2019t a Hollywood douche that you had only known for a day. You had no idea if he was buying your lie, or simply having the feeling not to dig any deeper, but you were glad he chose to say nothing.</p><p>You stopped asking him any questions and instead, the two of you walked silently over the market as you placed the orders and Chris taking one bag after the other. Walking back to your Granny\u2019s truck, a wave of misery overcame you. Somehow you were angry at Chris for asking what you were studying. In fact, you were behaving like an asshole, although it wasn\u2019t his fault. You had started the conversation and it naturally went there. It was your own fault. </p><p>You pulled out the keys for the truck out of your pockets as you looked over to the truck. Your luck truly had left you today. Leaning against it was no other than Brandon. </p><p>\u201cOh fuck,\u201c you let out. </p><p>You didn\u2019t care if Brandon was a nice guy or not, you truly didn\u2019t want to speak to him right now. No matter if it was about dating this summer again or the battery of the truck. The misery inside you was yelling at the top of its lungs, trying to prove to yourself that you wanted to be alone. </p><p>Chris\u2019s confused gaze moved from you to Brandon. Suddenly, his hand reached out, grabbing your wrist, making you look at him as you both stopped. A bitter shiver ran down your spine because you knew that Brandon was watching you standing there. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201c Chris asked quietly enough that Brandon couldn\u2019t possibly hear a word. </p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201c you said, but this time Chris was taking this as an answer enough. \u201cIt\u2019s just this guy that I used to go out with when I\u2019m around. He\u2019s not a bad guy, I just\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou just don\u2019t fancy him?\u201c </p><p>You sighed, looking away. \u201cYes, kind of. I just want to go\u2014\u201c </p><p>You cut yourself off as you felt Chris let go of your wrist. A sudden swift movement brought you closer to him. His hands touched your cheek lightly as he brushed your hair behind your ear. The smile on his lips lightened his entire face up, and in this breath of a moment, he looked irresistible. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see how good you can act,\u201c he said, taking your hand in his, finger intwining. </p><p>Your head was spinning. His smile was addicting, and you couldn\u2019t help but smile back at him. You were short of breath, your heart was racing against your thoughts, but instead of having the feeling that you were about to die, you felt more alive than ever before. </p><p>Chris turned back to the truck, still holding your hand while you walked toward it. Brandon\u2019s gaze was burning on your skin, yet nothing changed from the overwhelming confidence you felt out of nowhere. </p><p>\u201cHey Brandon, what\u2019s up?\u201c you said, almost not being able to get out the words.</p><p>Brandon pushed himself away from your Granny\u2019s truck, and you expected him to say something along the lines about the battery, but he was fixed at Chris, who kept up his friendly smile, offering Brandon his hand the next second. </p><p>\u201cHey man, I\u2019m Chris.\u201c he introduced himself so bluntly that you immediately stiffed next to him. </p><p>Although he looked as struck as you probably did, Brandon shook his head, followed by a quiet greeting. Chris must have noticed your struggle as his hips nudged yours subtly, almost as if he was reminding you that you were on cue. </p><p>Loosing up a little, you pressed your lips to a smile, making it visible for Brandon that you were waiting. \u201cI just\u2014I just wanted to ask about the,\u201c he stuttered, pointing to the truck, \u201cum, the battery.

No, he more likely demanded, but you weren\u2019t in the mood to put up a fight with him. As well as you gave up the chance of teasing him that he didn\u2019t even know the way back to your Granny\u2019s house. You just let it be and handed over the keys to him, climbing onto the passenger seat the second later. </p><p>In your head, you tried to rewinded the last minutes, trying to find the moment where Chris started acting. From his notice that something was wrong over to his quick response to play something in front of Brandon to scare him away\u2014you were thankful for that. You couldn\u2019t have one of those conversations with Brandon right now, but this action left you more confused than you were before. </p><p>You didn\u2019t like Hollywood guys like Chris, and in these last few minutes, he had reminded you why exactly. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://oneshots-heaven.tumblr.com/post/178829793713/time-out-for-a-movie-star\" target=\"_blank\">&lt;&lt; Last Part</a> \u2013\u2013 Next Part &gt;&gt;</p></p>",

Beginner&rsquo;s work at its best. </p><p>Hesitatingly, you sat in your dad&rsquo;s car parked on the yard. There was still the possibility for you to drive away unnoticed by anyone and forget about this stupid idea. You should&rsquo;ve stood by your word and not drive here instead to keep an eye on your Aunt&rsquo;s movie star, yet you had no argument to deny the fact that he was intriguing you. Just as much as the fact that he was another one of those pretty Hollywood guys made you furious. And you had no idea which part overweighted the other. </p><p>To do your father the favor, you told yourself that you need to keep your promise and keep helping your granny like you had planned it for the summer and the bonus was only that you would have your fun with teasing a movie star around. </p><p>Still keeping your eyes on him, you watched him standing slightly anxious in front of the chicken coop as if he wasn&rsquo;t sure if he should just enter it or if he will hunted down by a dozen of chickens. Your mouth twitched and you hated it. Why was this amusing to you? </p><p><i>A celebrity hunted down by angry chickens</i>, yeah, that would be a title story. </p><p>You sighed, knowing that you didn&rsquo;t have to kiss ass, but also didn&rsquo;t have to be an asshole to him. Maybe he could use a little help from you to not completely be a failure. Telling yourself this over and over again, you hopped out of the truck, closing the car door with a slam as you walked straight over to him. </p><p>Chris looked away from the coop straight to your direction, still standing there, not sure what he should actually do. &ldquo;I thought you wanted to leave,&ldquo; he said with a nod to you. </p><p><i>Don&rsquo;t push it</i>. </p><p>&ldquo;I did,&ldquo; you replied, stepping closer, &ldquo;and I actually had no desire to come back as long as you were here.&ldquo; </p><p>He put his free hand on his heart, crutching pretendedly, saying, &ldquo;Ouch, that hurt.&ldquo; </p><p>You rolled your eyes. His sarcasm was the only thing hurting here, but maybe you deserved that one. You glanced over to the coop. &ldquo;You do know the chickens won&rsquo;t eat you, do you? You&rsquo;d be a little too much for them.&ldquo; </p><p>Chris shrugged. &ldquo;I know that, but they are still scary.&ldquo; </p><p>You snorted, taking the bucket from him that he was immediately willing to let go off. At least, he was being honest. &ldquo;Chickens? Scary? No, they&rsquo;re not. Here, I&rsquo;ll show you. The ones from Granny are actually very quiet and old, so don&rsquo;t worry.&ldquo; </p><p>Before opening the fence gate to the coop, you took a short glance at him. He was this tall-standing guy with the sun-kissed Cali skin, a handsome face and some real muscles, yet he was scared of some chickens? This could potentially turn into some fun then. </p><p>Opening the short gate, you hold it open for Chris to follow you. He closed the gate behind you two without having you even ask him to do so. It didn&rsquo;t go unnoticed by you, however, you chose not to say anything. It wasn&rsquo;t worth it to praise him for these little simple things. </p><p>&ldquo;They can go in and out of the coop as they choose to because my dad fenced it completely around, but they usually come outside in the mornings after they laid their eggs. It&rsquo;s fairly easy to get the eggs without getting your hands picked all over.&ldquo; you explained as you opened the large door to the coop itself. </p><p>You looked around quickly, checking where eggs were laying and then you gathered them together in one swift movement, having Chris watch you do it. &ldquo;You check the little nets as I like to call them and then you carefully collect them.&ldquo; you said, handing him the small, filled basket. </p><p>With a grin on your lips, you added, &ldquo;There you go.&ldquo; </p><p>Chris starred wordlessly at the basket, taking it out of your hand. His gaze went up from the basket meeting your eyes. &ldquo;What made you come back?&ldquo; </p><p>His question struck you like thunder&mdash;quick but powerful. This simple question would&rsquo;ve sounded simple out of anyone else&rsquo;s mouth, but he made those words sound like you had been gone for a long time without any hope of ever returning, and it was breaking his heart to see you back. Reminding yourself that he was an actor who should easily awoke feelings like this, which instantly made you not be impressed by it anymore. </p><p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t let my aunt&rsquo;s favorite client fail at simple tasks like this. Imagine what it would do to his ego.&ldquo; you replied, trying to sound carelessly, but failing embarrassingly at it. You were no actress, you had no idea how to overplay a situation like this and not make it awkward. </p><p>Chris&rsquo;s mouth twitched to a smile. &ldquo;Guess you can be nice after all, even with the sass.&ldquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Guess you don&rsquo;t know me at all,&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll have some time to change that.&ldquo; </p><p>And as simple as that, he walked out of the coop, leaving you speechlessly behind. You wanted to curse yourself for feeling anything from this faked meanings. This was the damned magic of actors, they were able to make anything sound so beautiful that you were left wondering how beautiful his lies must sound like. </p><p>You followed him back to your grandma&rsquo;s house, stepping inside it without announcing yourself, walking past Max to pet him quickly before going to the dining room where you grandma had just finished everything for the breakfast. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, my dear. I thought you didn&rsquo;t want to come back.&ldquo; she said playfully surprised, obviously teasing you with a big grin on her face. Chris sat next to her at the table and to your dismiss, he sat right on your favorite spot where you had sat all your life. </p><p><i>That was an argument more to hate him. </i></p><p>Ignoring your Granny&rsquo;s words, you grabbed a plate set and sat down opposite to him, smiling falsely at him as your eyes met. Your grandma chuckled into her glass of orange juice, overplaying the situation with asking Chris about the chickens. </p><p>&ldquo;It went good,&ldquo; he answered, catching your now angry looking gaze. &ldquo;Y/N was lovely enough to help me out. Admittedly, I was a tiny bit scared of the chickens.&ldquo; </p><p>Your grandma laughed lovingly. &ldquo;That happens to the best, don&rsquo;t worry. Y/N used to be scared too when she was little. She hated going to the coop.&ldquo; </p><p><i>How dare she?</i></p><p>Chris was still not breaking your stare off, instead he raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;Oh, did she? Well, she was a brave one today.&ldquo; </p><p>Looking away from him over to your grandma, she smiled at you with her typical smile that your heart give in and forget any anger. She grabbed your free hand, rubbing her thumb over the back of it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re here to stay. I wanted to show Chris the town but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m ready to drive the truck just yet again. Will you be so kind?&ldquo; </p><p>There it was again, the part where you struggled. Christopher Evans was probably going to be the reason why you will feel the need to rip your hair out by the end of the week, and still be a darling in your grandma&rsquo;s eyes, which was why you were doing her this favor. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright Superstar, ready to see the bright side of this town?&ldquo; you said with a grin. </p><p>You had never seen him more confused before.</p><p>&mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; </p><p>Panic was written all over his face. If he had believed that the roads you took after you had picked him up from the landing place were rough and broken down, he hadn&rsquo;t seen most roads around here. The country never put their money toward towns like this, which truly needed it to repair simple things like the streets or update the cell service. Living in this small town was like living two decades behind, but you were so used to it that you didn&rsquo;t mind it when your friends from college couldn&rsquo;t reach you over the summer. It was freeing in some way. </p><p>Perhaps that was the exact reason why Aunt Susan had sent Chris here. This was undeniably a good place to get away from toxic places or people. </p><p>You didn&rsquo;t have to play his babysitter. He was fifteen years older than you, he should be able to do simple tasks but time altered differently around here. In fact, you were the true adult here, instead of him.</p><p>Parking your granny&rsquo;s old truck in the small parking lot close-by the market, you got out of the car, telling Chris, &ldquo;Come on,&ldquo; </p><p>The market in the town was every single day. Farmers around here sold their fresh vegetables and fruits and bringing the people together. All in all, the community in this town was great, where everyone kind of looked after one another, however which also meant that there were all sorts of rumors and talks between the neighbors.</p><p>The general age around here wasn&rsquo;t truly the age of Hollywood, or the ones who kept with the glamorous lives of people like Chris. Most people in this town had no clue who Chris was, and now you were walking around with for them, this tall, handsome stranger. You were already seeing the wildfire spread of rumors. </p><p>Granny was right when it came to your little dates with Brandon, you weren&rsquo;t really into him and especially this summer, you couldn&rsquo;t handle to be around him. Your dates over the past summers had been all sorts of friendly fun, however, this summer everything seemed different. He was eager, and probably believing that the two of you would end up marrying each other. </p><p>He would definitely hear about you walking around with Chris. It was silly but if you were already doomed to hang out with Chris, why not cause for some drama? </p><p>&ldquo;Welcome to our humble little town. The market is great, it&rsquo;s every day and everything&rsquo;s fresh. Granny likes to come here most days, so you might go with her the other days. Our town is small, we only have a population of three thousand. Unlike Los Angeles.&ldquo; you explained, walking ahead while he kept up with you with big steps. The market was in the middle of the small pedestrian zone in the middle of the town. </p><p>&ldquo;I see,&ldquo; he mumbled, looking over the filled market. </p><p>You grinned. Everyone came around for the market in the mornings to get the best vegetables for dinner. You gave him a moment to oversee it, before you nudged his side and nodded to the mass of locals. &ldquo;Look, I know you don&rsquo;t want to be here, and I don&rsquo;t want you to be here either, but let&rsquo;s get it over with and find something for Granny to cook for tonight.&ldquo;</p><p>Chris sighed, yet he followed you closely. Perhaps he knew that he didn&rsquo;t really have another choice. </p><p>&ldquo;Did you grew up in Los Angeles?&ldquo; you questioned him out of nowhere as you looked around the different stands. You knew he didn&rsquo;t. His birthplace and hometown came immediately up as you had googled his name the night before, but he didn&rsquo;t need to know that. </p><p>&ldquo;No,&ldquo; he replied. &ldquo;I grew up in Boston, Massachusetts.&ldquo; </p><p>&ldquo;A Massachusetts guy, I see.&ldquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What about you? Did you grew up here?&ldquo; </p><p>You stopped at a stand, hesitating for a moment but then you answered his question truthfully, &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t born here, but my dad came back here with me when I was two. So technically, I grew up here.&ldquo; </p><p>You greeted Gray, the owner of the stand, who made the usual order of your Granny ready as you handed his wife the money. Before you were able to take the filled plastic bag, Chris came forward taking it, leaving you a little stunned. The bright smile of Gary&rsquo;s wife made it clear to you that you miserably failed to hide it. She looked with wonder from you over to Chris, who noticed it much later and continued to make it even worse as he interrupted the stare with Gary&rsquo;s wife to look down to you. </p><p><i>Little drama, yes. Wedding bells ringing drama, hell no!</i></p><p>Barely trying to hide your reddened cheeks, you said goodbye quickly, turning on your heels to walk away. After being far enough away from Gary&rsquo;s stand, you dared to shoot another question. &ldquo;Did you always wanted to become an actor?&ldquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Looking back, I think it always has been only acting for me. I&rsquo;m sure I wanted to be a firefighter at some point in my life, but I can&rsquo;t imagine doing another job than acting now.&ldquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I could never imagine myself acting,&ldquo; you mumbled more to yourself than admitting it to him, but your luck was a son of a bitch. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t knock it till you try it, I&rsquo;d say.&ldquo;</p><p>You shook your head. &ldquo;No, never in my life.&ldquo; </p><p>Catching him nodding in your direction, you raised a brow. &ldquo;Then tell me, what are you doing with your life?&ldquo; </p><p>This wasn&rsquo;t the way you wanted this conversation to go. Actually, you didn&rsquo;t even want to exchange any information about your life with him, but you dumbass had started such conversation that is based on exchanging, and now you had to deal with it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m studying psychology at the University of Tennessee,&ldquo; you said, stopping in the middle of the market. </p><p>Chris eyed you for a moment, stopping too. &ldquo;You study psychology? Why?&ldquo; </p><p>You shrugged. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, it seemed fitting for me.&ldquo; </p><p>That was a bland lie. The wish to study psychology had struck you very early in your life, however, this part of your life story you&rsquo;d never tell him, not even if he wasn&rsquo;t a Hollywood douche that you had only known for a day. You had no idea if he was buying your lie, or simply having the feeling not to dig any deeper, but you were glad he chose to say nothing.</p><p>You stopped asking him any questions and instead, the two of you walked silently over the market as you placed the orders and Chris taking one bag after the other. Walking back to your Granny&rsquo;s truck, a wave of misery overcame you. Somehow you were angry at Chris for asking what you were studying. In fact, you were behaving like an asshole, although it wasn&rsquo;t his fault. You had started the conversation and it naturally went there. It was your own fault. </p><p>You pulled out the keys for the truck out of your pockets as you looked over to the truck. Your luck truly had left you today. Leaning against it was no other than Brandon. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh fuck,&ldquo; you let out. </p><p>You didn&rsquo;t care if Brandon was a nice guy or not, you truly didn&rsquo;t want to speak to him right now. No matter if it was about dating this summer again or the battery of the truck. The misery inside you was yelling at the top of its lungs, trying to prove to yourself that you wanted to be alone. </p><p>Chris&rsquo;s confused gaze moved from you to Brandon. Suddenly, his hand reached out, grabbing your wrist, making you look at him as you both stopped. A bitter shiver ran down your spine because you knew that Brandon was watching you standing there. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&ldquo; Chris asked quietly enough that Brandon couldn&rsquo;t possibly hear a word. </p><p>&ldquo;Nothing,&ldquo; you said, but this time Chris was taking this as an answer enough. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just this guy that I used to go out with when I&rsquo;m around. He&rsquo;s not a bad guy, I just&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You just don&rsquo;t fancy him?&ldquo; </p><p>You sighed, looking away. &ldquo;Yes, kind of. I just want to go&mdash;&ldquo; </p><p>You cut yourself off as you felt Chris let go of your wrist. A sudden swift movement brought you closer to him. His hands touched your cheek lightly as he brushed your hair behind your ear. The smile on his lips lightened his entire face up, and in this breath of a moment, he looked irresistible. </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see how good you can act,&ldquo; he said, taking your hand in his, finger intwining. </p><p>Your head was spinning. His smile was addicting, and you couldn&rsquo;t help but smile back at him. You were short of breath, your heart was racing against your thoughts, but instead of having the feeling that you were about to die, you felt more alive than ever before. </p><p>Chris turned back to the truck, still holding your hand while you walked toward it. Brandon&rsquo;s gaze was burning on your skin, yet nothing changed from the overwhelming confidence you felt out of nowhere. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey Brandon, what&rsquo;s up?&ldquo; you said, almost not being able to get out the words.</p><p>Brandon pushed himself away from your Granny&rsquo;s truck, and you expected him to say something along the lines about the battery, but he was fixed at Chris, who kept up his friendly smile, offering Brandon his hand the next second. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey man, I&rsquo;m Chris.&ldquo; he introduced himself so bluntly that you immediately stiffed next to him. </p><p>Although he looked as struck as you probably did, Brandon shook his head, followed by a quiet greeting. Chris must have noticed your struggle as his hips nudged yours subtly, almost as if he was reminding you that you were on cue. </p><p>Loosing up a little, you pressed your lips to a smile, making it visible for Brandon that you were waiting. &ldquo;I just&mdash;I just wanted to ask about the,&ldquo; he stuttered, pointing to the truck, &ldquo;um, the battery. Does your Granny want me to order her a new one?&ldquo; </p><p><i>That was totally not what he actually wanted to talk about. </i></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;d great. The truck won&rsquo;t take her anywhere if she doesn&rsquo;t get it changed soon.&ldquo; </p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t even believe yourself. The tone of your voice suddenly had changed to a way too positive sounding one, almost squeaking, the way models always talked like. </p><p>Brandon nodded, still seeming not to wrap his head around seeing you with a guy like Chris, before he walked off without saying another word. Your entire body relaxed from the tension, however, you didn&rsquo;t feel a bit better. </p><p>&ldquo;Give me the keys, I&rsquo;ll drive.&ldquo; Chris said. No, he more likely demanded, but you weren&rsquo;t in the mood to put up a fight with him. As well as you gave up the chance of teasing him that he didn&rsquo;t even know the way back to your Granny&rsquo;s house. You just let it be and handed over the keys to him, climbing onto the passenger seat the second later. </p><p>In your head, you tried to rewinded the last minutes, trying to find the moment where Chris started acting.
