The characters are all great, not particularly deep, but they don\u2019t have to be. And Anne Hathaway steals the show. However, there\u2019s a glaring problem with this movie, and it\u2019s the fact that everything seems ridiculously easy for them, taking away any sense of tension. There\u2019s a lot of points where things should cause significant problems but&hellip;don\u2019t. So if you stop asking questions and just go with it, it\u2019s a good time. <b>7/10</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-width=\"300\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"simonjadis:p1HExuVCwKCYyLaMZGk9Rw:Zhyp7v2bFRg6C\" style=\"\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b7d78d91286593e03db9e0a7cbc352dd/tumblr_pe3bk8dZGl1rxftfko1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-width=\"300\"/></figure><p><br/></p><p><b>Boku no Hero Academia- Two Heroes</b>: It\u2019s the BNHA version of Die Hard. Seriously, All Might and a bunch of other heroes and citizens are taken hostage by villains in a skyscraper, and the most popular characters from the UA class have to save them. And it\u2019s good. Just like the show. I\u2019ve never gotten hyped up for this series as much as everyone else seems to, but it\u2019s enjoyable and the movie has more of the good action and fun characters! I did feel like it went on a little long, and I wish we had gotten more of the characters doing stuff on the island instead of mainly just the villain plot. I think it\u2019s because it reminded me a lot of the vacation arc in Assassination Classroom. But whatever, it\u2019s still fun and worth watching. <b>7/10</b></p><p><b>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</b>: Awkward magizoologist Newt Scamander accidentally releases a bunch of magical creatures into 1920s New York and must round them all up with the help of lovable muggle/no-maj Jacob Kowalski. And there\u2019s some horror movie type stuff going on with a creepy kid and Grindelwald in disguise. It\u2019s the spin-off/prequel to Harry Potter that we all know and&hellip;love? I know some people resent this movie just for existing, but I like it. I like the creatures. I like going to new places in the wizarding world. I like Newt. I like Tina. I LOVE Queenie and Jacob, both separately and together. The plot is a little&hellip;stretched, but I don\u2019t mind that much. And no one had the good sense to keep Colin Farrell as Grindelwald. However, I haven\u2019t seen the second movie yet, so I should probably have my Harry Potter super fan card revoked. I honestly think that this could have been a fine stand alone movie or maybe a duology, where the second movie focuses on the backstory between Dumbledore and Grindelwald, and Grindelwald\u2019s rise to power. I certainly don\u2019t need five movies of this though, and I think everyone would rather see a prequel of Harry Potter\u2019s parents in the marauders era instead. Oh well, I still like this movie for what it is. I just don\u2019t need five of them. <b>7.5/10</b></p><p><b>How to Train Your Dragon 2</b>: Five years after the viking village of Berk has accepted dragons instead of fighting them, a mysterious villain with a dragon army wants to&hellip;idk take over the world or something, so naturally it\u2019s up to a wiry 20 year old Hiccup to stop the seemingly inevitable war. I love this movie, both as a sequel and a solid story in a trilogy. It has its issues, mainly the fact that it glorifies/glosses over absentee parents and its final act seems like it was hastily rewritten as a merchandising opportunity&hellip;but dang other than that I can\u2019t really say anything bad about it. I\u2019m even one of the few people who like the side characters. The time jump feels natural, and I liked seeing everything come together after watching the TV series. It also of course has great music, stunning animation, and a lot of heart and effort put into every minute. I alsothink this sequel has an interesting message about how different people view peace and war and whether or not people are capable of change. So yeah, this is one of those series that I think has something for everyone. <b>9/10</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"350\" data-orig-width=\"268\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"lasscess:EXBA1HuB9lt1gZwHiO6Llw:ZzNGya2Yx0nMX\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/40b7ff1ce2ce48502074ae7d6f72381b/tumblr_paeid3SoOj1x6q9iwo4_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"350\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure><p><br/></p><p><b>The Lego Movie 2- The Second Part</b>: Five years after the first Lego movie ends with \u201caliens\u201d invading, the Lego universe has become a post-apocalyptic society where everything is not awesome. And after another invasion, all the important characters except Emmet get kidnapped, and he has to save everyone from an&hellip;evil(?) queen. But really it\u2019s a story about getting along and seeing things from other people\u2019s perspectives. It\u2019s fun, and it has incredibly creative music (and please for the sake of all that is good, watch the credits song). But there are times when I wished it wouldn\u2019t lean so heavily on the&hellip;fourth wall breaking from the first movie. I felt like I would have completely understood what must be happening outside the Lego world to drive the plot, and then they would just cut to the human characters to explain everything. But it\u2019s still a great time and hilarious as expected. <b>8/10</b></p><h2><b>Books!</b></h2><p><b>(To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before) P.S I Still Love You</b> by Jenny Han: The second book in the To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before trilogy. It serves to give you a glimpse into Lara Jean and Peter\u2019s life as a couple. It\u2019s like a sweet slice of life anime where some notable things occur, like the hot tub video plot that was in the movie happens AND JOHN AMBROSE MCCLAREN SHOWS UP..but there\u2019s no real plot. And that\u2019s fine! This was a super fun read, just like the first one, and John Mcclaren is amazing. There\u2019s really only one major problem I have with this book, and it\u2019s Gen\u2019s and Lara Jean\u2019s relationship. Throughout the book LJ knows something bad is happening with Gen\u2019s family. We know that Peter is still Gen\u2019s friend and promised her he wouldn\u2019t say anything, which is justifiable as something friends do! I wish we could have seen Peter trying to convince Gen to apologize or explain the situation to LJ, but it is what it is. However, we also know Gen did something truly terrible in posting the hot tub video, and literally nothing going on in her personal life or her past justifies her being a life ruining bitch just because she feels bad. So what I really wanted to see was LJ marching up to her and saying \u201cI know you\u2019re going through something, but you ruined my fucking life for no apparent reason, so I demand an apology and an explanation\u201d like the boss she is. And, as anyone who watched the movie knows, Gen tries to be the martyr and gain sympathy by placing the blame on LJ because of something that happened in FREAKING MIDDLE SCHOOL! \u00a0I cannot stress enough how out of line Gen\u2019s character is, and no amount of hastily garnered sympathy or backstory reveals will make her better. But yeah other than that, it was very enjoyable. And if Lara Jean doesn\u2019t want John Ambrose Mcclaren, then I\u2019ll take him. <b>8/10</b></p><p><b>King of Scars </b>by Leigh Bardugo: It\u2019s the start of a new series in Bardugo\u2019s \u201cGrishaverse\u201d. And yes you absolutely need to read both the Grisha Trilogy and the Six of Crows duology to read this. KoS centers around the now King Nikolai Lanstov who has been possessed by a monster created by the Darkling. Also Ravka is once again on the brink of war, Nikolai must think about getting married, and there\u2019s a cult that wants the Darkling to made a saint. But actually, this book is split into three different stories: one following Nikolai and Zoya trying to get rid of the monster, one following Nina on a secret mission in Fjerda, and one following what&rsquo;s happening in Ravka while Nikolai is away. So basically, one part Nina being a badass, one part eldritch horror story, and one part The Prince and The Pauper. And it was pretty good&hellip;except for the fact that I understood almost none of Nikolai and Zoya\u2019s story after the second half of the book. I wasn\u2019t into the&hellip;saint business because it seemed so out of place for this series. I also feel like she missed out on some great characters meeting each other. Oh well, it\u2019s still a great study in world building and character interactions, the ending is buck wild, and Nina continues to be a bisexual disaster&hellip;so it\u2019s worth it. <b>8/10</b></p><p><b>The Magician\u2019s Nephew</b> by C.S. Lewis: Several decades before the Pevensies stepped through the wardrobe, young Digory Kirke (aka the Professor) and Polly Plummer are roped into a traumatizing adventure of their own. Only instead of saving Narnia, they accidentally release a younger but just as intimidating Jadis from her own dying world into London, and in an attempt to get her out of Earth, end up letting her loose in the newly created Narnia. This is probably the book with the most similarities to TLTWATW, with a truly terrifying villain, a winding but whimsical plot, and a lot of humor. Digory and Polly are the most well written children so far. They are both hilarious great characters in their own ways, and I love seeing them fight and make up like actual kids who are friends. While Digory has to go through his own redemption arc similarly to Edmund, Polly is always there as the voice of the audience telling him to not be a dumbass. Not to mention whenever he tries to get away with saying something sexist, she\u2019s shuts him down like a badass. And there\u2019s also a London cabby who literally tells Aslan that he\u2019ll be king of Narnia if his awesome wife gets to come too&hellip;and there\u2019s a horse named Strawberry that turns into a Pegasus. So what\u2019s not to like? People may complain about all the religious metaphors and creationism, but come on lighten up. At least it\u2019s not horribly racist, and you\u2019ll long for the simple biblical similarities when you\u2019re faced with the layers of religious offense in The Last Battle. <b>9/10</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"151\" data-orig-width=\"268\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"aregelle-archive:2qbknijgDCjbPXAWJu28JQ:ZOkubm2WubXZj\" style=\"\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/991cf0058c8e7a4d4d0d54a5614e6dbd/tumblr_p6uq8wuJoH1tkmh04o1_r1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"151\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure><p><br/></p><p><b>The Last Battle</b> by C.S. Lewis (mild spoilers): The final book in the Chronicles of Narnia series, in which the world ends because a talking ape convinces a donkey to dress up as Aslan to trick all the Narnians into giving them stuff. There\u2019s a lot more to this plot, but those are the basics. There is a TON of stuff to unpack in this epic conclusion, and this isn\u2019t even the half of it. </p><p>This book seems like the Last Jedi for this series, in that some people are incredibly moved by it and are very happy with the conclusion our main characters have been given, and some people think it\u2019s a pile of crap. I think there is good in this book. But, putting aside my good feelings for a second, THE LAST BATTLE IS ONE OF THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLY RACIST THINGS I\u2019VE EVER READ&hellip;voluntarily anyway. Seriously, if you thought The Horse and His Boy was bad, you ain&rsquo;t seen nothing yet. There are many layers of why this particular plot in the series is so offensive I could write essays on why this book should be thrown out the window. Not to mention the Susan problem. So I&rsquo;ll say, that even though there were good things in this book, it doesn&rsquo;t excuse&hellip;everything else. Also Eustace isn\u2019t as snarky in this one&hellip;I miss my sarcastic sass boy.</p><p>HOWEVER, unlike some people, I think it was exactly the conclusion that the series has been leading up to since the beginning. I think the plot of an imposter Aslan and the effect it would have on Narnians is cool. And much like the book of Revelation, the end of the world is weird, confusing, and dark as fuck considering this is a children\u2019s book. He invokes an amazing sense of fear and sadness, considering we just saw the birth of Narnia in the last book. And I am one of the people who loved the last few pages. It was an interesting take on heaven, theology, and the questions of \u201cis Aslan also Tash? Is one religion better? Are all gods the same?\u201d are dealt with very well considering that was one of the most problematic aspects of the book. I love literally all the characters you can think of reuniting in the end&hellip;except for Susan. I will say, Susan no longer being a friend of Narnia was led up to throughout the other books, and I think what Polly says about her wanting to be grown up rings true&hellip;in a sense. What we really need is a new series for Susan where she becomes a friend of Narnia again and gets her happy ending, rather than just \u201coh look makeup, guess I can\u2019t be in Narnia anymore.\u201d AND YET Lewis finally abandoned the idea of \u201cgirls shouldn\u2019t be fighting\u201d and made Jill a super secret ninja spy/badass archer warrior woman. So&hellip;I can\u2019t even say it\u2019s as sexist as the other books. There\u2019s also a male talking unicorn who is best friends with the current king&hellip;and it kind of seems like they have a thing for each other&hellip;so there\u2019s that.</p><p>Some people are angry that it is so religiously based and the allegories are so in your face, but at this point if you&rsquo;re reading the Chronicles of Narnia and are upset that there&rsquo;s religion in it, I don&rsquo;t know what to tell you. Truthfully, I thought he did the allegory for the church controlling the population very well, and the idea judgement based on whether you actively hate Aslan instead of being about how you\u2019re either a good or bad person was so cool and different. But honestly, I just don&rsquo;t know what to feel. I&rsquo;m happy for the characters in the end&hellip;I liked the overall idea of this final book&hellip;but man it can be super uncomfortable to the point that I don\u2019t even want to rate it. </p><h2><b>TV Shows!</b></h2><p><b>Kitten Rescuers</b>: Why yes, it is the incredibly wholesome British TV show about the RSPCA going around and rescuing cats from bizarre and/or dangerous situations, like being stuck up chimneys or drain pipes. And yes, it is the purest thing you will ever watch, even with My Roommate is a Cat in the running as the best cat themed show of the year. I don\u2019t care if it seems like a big commercial for the RSPCA sometimes, I just want to see some cute kittens get their happy endings. My only complaint is that there\u2019s only 8 episodes on Netflix, and I\u2019m desperate for more. <b>100 adorable feline friends/10</b></p><p><b>Re: Zero Starting Life in Another World</b>: You know, the anime everyone lost their shit over in 2016? The isekai where the main protagonist keeps re-spawning every time he dies in the fantasy world he is magically transported to and does nothing but suffer? But hey it has those two twin maids with the pink and blue hair in it so it\u2019s all fine? That one. The English dub finally released the second half of the show, so I finished it. AND YES THE DUB IS ACTUALLY GOOD! And the show is fine too. But I feel like I sort of&hellip;lost the gist of why everything was happening in those last 12 episodes. However, there was a lot to like about this series overall, and yes Rem truly is best girl.

Lewis (mild spoilers): The final book in the Chronicles of Narnia series, in which the world ends because a talking ape convinces a donkey to dress up as Aslan to trick all the Narnians into giving them stuff. There\u2019s a lot more to this plot, but those are the basics. There is a TON of stuff to unpack in this epic conclusion, and this isn\u2019t even the half of it. </p><p>This book seems like the Last Jedi for this series, in that some people are incredibly moved by it and are very happy with the conclusion our main characters have been given, and some people think it\u2019s a pile of crap. I think there is good in this book. But, putting aside my good feelings for a second, THE LAST BATTLE IS ONE OF THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLY RACIST THINGS I\u2019VE EVER READ\u2026voluntarily anyway. Seriously, if you thought The Horse and His Boy was bad, you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet. There are many layers of why this particular plot in the series is so offensive I could write essays on why this book should be thrown out the window. Not to mention the Susan problem. So I\u2019ll say, that even though there were good things in this book, it doesn\u2019t excuse\u2026everything else. Also Eustace isn\u2019t as snarky in this one\u2026I miss my sarcastic sass boy.</p><p>HOWEVER, unlike some people, I think it was exactly the conclusion that the series has been leading up to since the beginning. I think the plot of an imposter Aslan and the effect it would have on Narnians is cool. And much like the book of Revelation, the end of the world is weird, confusing, and dark as fuck considering this is a children\u2019s book. He invokes an amazing sense of fear and sadness, considering we just saw the birth of Narnia in the last book. And I am one of the people who loved the last few pages. It was an interesting take on heaven, theology, and the questions of \u201cis Aslan also Tash? Is one religion better? Are all gods the same?\u201d are dealt with very well considering that was one of the most problematic aspects of the book. I love literally all the characters you can think of reuniting in the end\u2026except for Susan. I will say, Susan no longer being a friend of Narnia was led up to throughout the other books, and I think what Polly says about her wanting to be grown up rings true\u2026in a sense. What we really need is a new series for Susan where she becomes a friend of Narnia again and gets her happy ending, rather than just \u201coh look makeup, guess I can\u2019t be in Narnia anymore.\u201d AND YET Lewis finally abandoned the idea of \u201cgirls shouldn\u2019t be fighting\u201d and made Jill a super secret ninja spy/badass archer warrior woman. So\u2026I can\u2019t even say it\u2019s as sexist as the other books. There\u2019s also a male talking unicorn who is best friends with the current king\u2026and it kind of seems like they have a thing for each other\u2026so there\u2019s that.</p><p>Some people are angry that it is so religiously based and the allegories are so in your face, but at this point if you\u2019re reading the Chronicles of Narnia and are upset that there\u2019s religion in it, I don\u2019t know what to tell you. Truthfully, I thought he did the allegory for the church controlling the population very well, and the idea judgement based on whether you actively hate Aslan instead of being about how you\u2019re either a good or bad person was so cool and different. But honestly, I just don\u2019t know what to feel. I\u2019m happy for the characters in the end\u2026I liked the overall idea of this final book\u2026but man it can be super uncomfortable to the point that I don\u2019t even want to rate it. </p><h2><b>TV Shows!</b></h2><p><b>Kitten Rescuers</b>: Why yes, it is the incredibly wholesome British TV show about the RSPCA going around and rescuing cats from bizarre and/or dangerous situations, like being stuck up chimneys or drain pipes.

And it\u2019s almost been a year!</p><h2><b>Movies!</b></h2><p><b>Ocean\u2019s 8</b>: Sandra Bullock assembles a team of ladies to steal a super fancy diamond necklace. As someone who has never seen an Ocean\u2019s movie before, I thought this was fun. I like heists, and I LOVE jewel heists. The characters are all great, not particularly deep, but they don\u2019t have to be. And Anne Hathaway steals the show. However, there\u2019s a glaring problem with this movie, and it\u2019s the fact that everything seems ridiculously easy for them, taking away any sense of tension. There\u2019s a lot of points where things should cause significant problems but\u2026don\u2019t. So if you stop asking questions and just go with it, it\u2019s a good time. <b>7/10</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-width=\"300\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"simonjadis:p1HExuVCwKCYyLaMZGk9Rw:Zhyp7v2bFRg6C\" style=\"\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b7d78d91286593e03db9e0a7cbc352dd/tumblr_pe3bk8dZGl1rxftfko1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-width=\"300\"></figure><p><br></p><p><b>Boku no Hero Academia- Two Heroes</b>: It\u2019s the BNHA version of Die Hard. Seriously, All Might and a bunch of other heroes and citizens are taken hostage by villains in a skyscraper, and the most popular characters from the UA class have to save them. And it\u2019s good. Just like the show. I\u2019ve never gotten hyped up for this series as much as everyone else seems to, but it\u2019s enjoyable and the movie has more of the good action and fun characters! I did feel like it went on a little long, and I wish we had gotten more of the characters doing stuff on the island instead of mainly just the villain plot. I think it\u2019s because it reminded me a lot of the vacation arc in Assassination Classroom. But whatever, it\u2019s still fun and worth watching. <b>7/10</b></p><p><b>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</b>: Awkward magizoologist Newt Scamander accidentally releases a bunch of magical creatures into 1920s New York and must round them all up with the help of lovable muggle/no-maj Jacob Kowalski. And there\u2019s some horror movie type stuff going on with a creepy kid and Grindelwald in disguise. It\u2019s the spin-off/prequel to Harry Potter that we all know and\u2026love? I know some people resent this movie just for existing, but I like it. I like the creatures. I like going to new places in the wizarding world. I like Newt. I like Tina. I LOVE Queenie and Jacob, both separately and together. The plot is a little\u2026stretched, but I don\u2019t mind that much. And no one had the good sense to keep Colin Farrell as Grindelwald. However, I haven\u2019t seen the second movie yet, so I should probably have my Harry Potter super fan card revoked. I honestly think that this could have been a fine stand alone movie or maybe a duology, where the second movie focuses on the backstory between Dumbledore and Grindelwald, and Grindelwald\u2019s rise to power. I certainly don\u2019t need five movies of this though, and I think everyone would rather see a prequel of Harry Potter\u2019s parents in the marauders era instead. Oh well, I still like this movie for what it is. I just don\u2019t need five of them. <b>7.5/10</b></p><p><b>How to Train Your Dragon 2</b>: Five years after the viking village of Berk has accepted dragons instead of fighting them, a mysterious villain with a dragon army wants to\u2026idk take over the world or something, so naturally it\u2019s up to a wiry 20 year old Hiccup to stop the seemingly inevitable war. I love this movie, both as a sequel and a solid story in a trilogy. It has its issues, mainly the fact that it glorifies/glosses over absentee parents and its final act seems like it was hastily rewritten as a merchandising opportunity\u2026but dang other than that I can\u2019t really say anything bad about it. I\u2019m even one of the few people who like the side characters. The time jump feels natural, and I liked seeing everything come together after watching the TV series. It also of course has great music, stunning animation, and a lot of heart and effort put into every minute. I alsothink this sequel has an interesting message about how different people view peace and war and whether or not people are capable of change. So yeah, this is one of those series that I think has something for everyone. <b>9/10</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"350\" data-orig-width=\"268\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"lasscess:EXBA1HuB9lt1gZwHiO6Llw:ZzNGya2Yx0nMX\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/40b7ff1ce2ce48502074ae7d6f72381b/tumblr_paeid3SoOj1x6q9iwo4_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"350\" data-orig-width=\"268\"></figure><p><br></p><p><b>The Lego Movie 2- The Second Part</b>: Five years after the first Lego movie ends with \u201caliens\u201d invading, the Lego universe has become a post-apocalyptic society where everything is not awesome. And after another invasion, all the important characters except Emmet get kidnapped, and he has to save everyone from an\u2026evil(?) queen. But really it\u2019s a story about getting along and seeing things from other people\u2019s perspectives. It\u2019s fun, and it has incredibly creative music (and please for the sake of all that is good, watch the credits song). But there are times when I wished it wouldn\u2019t lean so heavily on the\u2026fourth wall breaking from the first movie. I felt like I would have completely understood what must be happening outside the Lego world to drive the plot, and then they would just cut to the human characters to explain everything. But it\u2019s still a great time and hilarious as expected. <b>8/10</b></p><h2><b>Books!</b></h2><p><b>(To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before) P.S I Still Love You</b> by Jenny Han: The second book in the To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before trilogy. It serves to give you a glimpse into Lara Jean and Peter\u2019s life as a couple. It\u2019s like a sweet slice of life anime where some notable things occur, like the hot tub video plot that was in the movie happens AND JOHN AMBROSE MCCLAREN SHOWS UP..but there\u2019s no real plot. And that\u2019s fine! This was a super fun read, just like the first one, and John Mcclaren is amazing. There\u2019s really only one major problem I have with this book, and it\u2019s Gen\u2019s and Lara Jean\u2019s relationship. Throughout the book LJ knows something bad is happening with Gen\u2019s family. We know that Peter is still Gen\u2019s friend and promised her he wouldn\u2019t say anything, which is justifiable as something friends do! I wish we could have seen Peter trying to convince Gen to apologize or explain the situation to LJ, but it is what it is. However, we also know Gen did something truly terrible in posting the hot tub video, and literally nothing going on in her personal life or her past justifies her being a life ruining bitch just because she feels bad. So what I really wanted to see was LJ marching up to her and saying \u201cI know you\u2019re going through something, but you ruined my fucking life for no apparent reason, so I demand an apology and an explanation\u201d like the boss she is. And, as anyone who watched the movie knows, Gen tries to be the martyr and gain sympathy by placing the blame on LJ because of something that happened in FREAKING MIDDLE SCHOOL! \u00a0I cannot stress enough how out of line Gen\u2019s character is, and no amount of hastily garnered sympathy or backstory reveals will make her better. But yeah other than that, it was very enjoyable. And if Lara Jean doesn\u2019t want John Ambrose Mcclaren, then I\u2019ll take him. <b>8/10</b></p><p><b>King of Scars </b>by Leigh Bardugo: It\u2019s the start of a new series in Bardugo\u2019s \u201cGrishaverse\u201d. And yes you absolutely need to read both the Grisha Trilogy and the Six of Crows duology to read this. KoS centers around the now King Nikolai Lanstov who has been possessed by a monster created by the Darkling. Also Ravka is once again on the brink of war, Nikolai must think about getting married, and there\u2019s a cult that wants the Darkling to made a saint. But actually, this book is split into three different stories: one following Nikolai and Zoya trying to get rid of the monster, one following Nina on a secret mission in Fjerda, and one following what\u2019s happening in Ravka while Nikolai is away. So basically, one part Nina being a badass, one part eldritch horror story, and one part The Prince and The Pauper. And it was pretty good\u2026except for the fact that I understood almost none of Nikolai and Zoya\u2019s story after the second half of the book. I wasn\u2019t into the\u2026saint business because it seemed so out of place for this series. I also feel like she missed out on some great characters meeting each other. Oh well, it\u2019s still a great study in world building and character interactions, the ending is buck wild, and Nina continues to be a bisexual disaster\u2026so it\u2019s worth it. <b>8/10</b></p><p><b>The Magician\u2019s Nephew</b> by C.S. Lewis: Several decades before the Pevensies stepped through the wardrobe, young Digory Kirke (aka the Professor) and Polly Plummer are roped into a traumatizing adventure of their own. Only instead of saving Narnia, they accidentally release a younger but just as intimidating Jadis from her own dying world into London, and in an attempt to get her out of Earth, end up letting her loose in the newly created Narnia. This is probably the book with the most similarities to TLTWATW, with a truly terrifying villain, a winding but whimsical plot, and a lot of humor. Digory and Polly are the most well written children so far. They are both hilarious great characters in their own ways, and I love seeing them fight and make up like actual kids who are friends. While Digory has to go through his own redemption arc similarly to Edmund, Polly is always there as the voice of the audience telling him to not be a dumbass. Not to mention whenever he tries to get away with saying something sexist, she\u2019s shuts him down like a badass. And there\u2019s also a London cabby who literally tells Aslan that he\u2019ll be king of Narnia if his awesome wife gets to come too\u2026and there\u2019s a horse named Strawberry that turns into a Pegasus. So what\u2019s not to like? People may complain about all the religious metaphors and creationism, but come on lighten up.

I was just more invested in the first half of the series.<b> 8/10</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"lilium:4l98nAozmrfgu54hI6nNeA:ZcXfMy2HhcOtQ\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f4c803e19901d62b771d7c4f940ec930/tumblr_okf273krD51qbvovho1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p><br></p><h2><b>Honorable Mentions</b></h2><p>I watched <b>Christopher Robin</b> again\u2026and I still love it.</p><p>I read the first volume of the <b>Tsurune </b>light novel.

                "content": "<p>Hello and welcome to &ldquo;see how I wasted my time&rdquo; the post where I keep track of all the media I consume in a month. If you&rsquo;re new here, this is mainly just my excuse to shout into the void about my feelings on things I&rsquo;ve watched or read in a month. And it&rsquo;s almost been a year!</p><h2><b>Movies!</b></h2><p><b>Ocean&rsquo;s 8</b>: Sandra Bullock assembles a team of ladies to steal a super fancy diamond necklace. As someone who has never seen an Ocean&rsquo;s movie before, I thought this was fun. I like heists, and I LOVE jewel heists. The characters are all great, not particularly deep, but they don&rsquo;t have to be. And Anne Hathaway steals the show. However, there&rsquo;s a glaring problem with this movie, and it&rsquo;s the fact that everything seems ridiculously easy for them, taking away any sense of tension. There&rsquo;s a lot of points where things should cause significant problems but&hellip;don&rsquo;t. So if you stop asking questions and just go with it, it&rsquo;s a good time. <b>7/10</b></p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><br /></p><p><b>Boku no Hero Academia- Two Heroes</b>: It&rsquo;s the BNHA version of Die Hard. Seriously, All Might and a bunch of other heroes and citizens are taken hostage by villains in a skyscraper, and the most popular characters from the UA class have to save them. And it&rsquo;s good. Just like the show. I&rsquo;ve never gotten hyped up for this series as much as everyone else seems to, but it&rsquo;s enjoyable and the movie has more of the good action and fun characters! I did feel like it went on a little long, and I wish we had gotten more of the characters doing stuff on the island instead of mainly just the villain plot. I think it&rsquo;s because it reminded me a lot of the vacation arc in Assassination Classroom. But whatever, it&rsquo;s still fun and worth watching. <b>7/10</b></p><p><b>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</b>: Awkward magizoologist Newt Scamander accidentally releases a bunch of magical creatures into 1920s New York and must round them all up with the help of lovable muggle/no-maj Jacob Kowalski. And there&rsquo;s some horror movie type stuff going on with a creepy kid and Grindelwald in disguise. It&rsquo;s the spin-off/prequel to Harry Potter that we all know and&hellip;love? I know some people resent this movie just for existing, but I like it. I like the creatures. I like going to new places in the wizarding world. I like Newt. I like Tina. I LOVE Queenie and Jacob, both separately and together. The plot is a little&hellip;stretched, but I don&rsquo;t mind that much. And no one had the good sense to keep Colin Farrell as Grindelwald. However, I haven&rsquo;t seen the second movie yet, so I should probably have my Harry Potter super fan card revoked. I honestly think that this could have been a fine stand alone movie or maybe a duology, where the second movie focuses on the backstory between Dumbledore and Grindelwald, and Grindelwald&rsquo;s rise to power. I certainly don&rsquo;t need five movies of this though, and I think everyone would rather see a prequel of Harry Potter&rsquo;s parents in the marauders era instead. Oh well, I still like this movie for what it is. I just don&rsquo;t need five of them. <b>7.5/10</b></p><p><b>How to Train Your Dragon 2</b>: Five years after the viking village of Berk has accepted dragons instead of fighting them, a mysterious villain with a dragon army wants to&hellip;idk take over the world or something, so naturally it&rsquo;s up to a wiry 20 year old Hiccup to stop the seemingly inevitable war. I love this movie, both as a sequel and a solid story in a trilogy. It has its issues, mainly the fact that it glorifies/glosses over absentee parents and its final act seems like it was hastily rewritten as a merchandising opportunity&hellip;but dang other than that I can&rsquo;t really say anything bad about it. I&rsquo;m even one of the few people who like the side characters. The time jump feels natural, and I liked seeing everything come together after watching the TV series. It also of course has great music, stunning animation, and a lot of heart and effort put into every minute. I alsothink this sequel has an interesting message about how different people view peace and war and whether or not people are capable of change. So yeah, this is one of those series that I think has something for everyone. <b>9/10</b></p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"1\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><br /></p><p><b>The Lego Movie 2- The Second Part</b>: Five years after the first Lego movie ends with &ldquo;aliens&rdquo; invading, the Lego universe has become a post-apocalyptic society where everything is not awesome. And after another invasion, all the important characters except Emmet get kidnapped, and he has to save everyone from an&hellip;evil(?) queen. But really it&rsquo;s a story about getting along and seeing things from other people&rsquo;s perspectives. It&rsquo;s fun, and it has incredibly creative music (and please for the sake of all that is good, watch the credits song). But there are times when I wished it wouldn&rsquo;t lean so heavily on the&hellip;fourth wall breaking from the first movie. I felt like I would have completely understood what must be happening outside the Lego world to drive the plot, and then they would just cut to the human characters to explain everything. But it&rsquo;s still a great time and hilarious as expected. <b>8/10</b></p><h2><b>Books!</b></h2><p><b>(To All the Boys I&rsquo;ve Loved Before) P.S I Still Love You</b> by Jenny Han: The second book in the To All the Boys I&rsquo;ve Loved Before trilogy. It serves to give you a glimpse into Lara Jean and Peter&rsquo;s life as a couple. It&rsquo;s like a sweet slice of life anime where some notable things occur, like the hot tub video plot that was in the movie happens AND JOHN AMBROSE MCCLAREN SHOWS UP..but there&rsquo;s no real plot. And that&rsquo;s fine! This was a super fun read, just like the first one, and John Mcclaren is amazing. There&rsquo;s really only one major problem I have with this book, and it&rsquo;s Gen&rsquo;s and Lara Jean&rsquo;s relationship. Throughout the book LJ knows something bad is happening with Gen&rsquo;s family. We know that Peter is still Gen&rsquo;s friend and promised her he wouldn&rsquo;t say anything, which is justifiable as something friends do! I wish we could have seen Peter trying to convince Gen to apologize or explain the situation to LJ, but it is what it is. However, we also know Gen did something truly terrible in posting the hot tub video, and literally nothing going on in her personal life or her past justifies her being a life ruining bitch just because she feels bad. So what I really wanted to see was LJ marching up to her and saying &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re going through something, but you ruined my fucking life for no apparent reason, so I demand an apology and an explanation&rdquo; like the boss she is. And, as anyone who watched the movie knows, Gen tries to be the martyr and gain sympathy by placing the blame on LJ because of something that happened in FREAKING MIDDLE SCHOOL! &nbsp;I cannot stress enough how out of line Gen&rsquo;s character is, and no amount of hastily garnered sympathy or backstory reveals will make her better. But yeah other than that, it was very enjoyable. And if Lara Jean doesn&rsquo;t want John Ambrose Mcclaren, then I&rsquo;ll take him. <b>8/10</b></p><p><b>King of Scars </b>by Leigh Bardugo: It&rsquo;s the start of a new series in Bardugo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Grishaverse&rdquo;. And yes you absolutely need to read both the Grisha Trilogy and the Six of Crows duology to read this. KoS centers around the now King Nikolai Lanstov who has been possessed by a monster created by the Darkling. Also Ravka is once again on the brink of war, Nikolai must think about getting married, and there&rsquo;s a cult that wants the Darkling to made a saint. But actually, this book is split into three different stories: one following Nikolai and Zoya trying to get rid of the monster, one following Nina on a secret mission in Fjerda, and one following what&rsquo;s happening in Ravka while Nikolai is away. So basically, one part Nina being a badass, one part eldritch horror story, and one part The Prince and The Pauper. And it was pretty good&hellip;except for the fact that I understood almost none of Nikolai and Zoya&rsquo;s story after the second half of the book. I wasn&rsquo;t into the&hellip;saint business because it seemed so out of place for this series. I also feel like she missed out on some great characters meeting each other. Oh well, it&rsquo;s still a great study in world building and character interactions, the ending is buck wild, and Nina continues to be a bisexual disaster&hellip;so it&rsquo;s worth it. <b>8/10</b></p><p><b>The Magician&rsquo;s Nephew</b> by C.S. Lewis: Several decades before the Pevensies stepped through the wardrobe, young Digory Kirke (aka the Professor) and Polly Plummer are roped into a traumatizing adventure of their own. Only instead of saving Narnia, they accidentally release a younger but just as intimidating Jadis from her own dying world into London, and in an attempt to get her out of Earth, end up letting her loose in the newly created Narnia. This is probably the book with the most similarities to TLTWATW, with a truly terrifying villain, a winding but whimsical plot, and a lot of humor. Digory and Polly are the most well written children so far. They are both hilarious great characters in their own ways, and I love seeing them fight and make up like actual kids who are friends. While Digory has to go through his own redemption arc similarly to Edmund, Polly is always there as the voice of the audience telling him to not be a dumbass. Not to mention whenever he tries to get away with saying something sexist, she&rsquo;s shuts him down like a badass. And there&rsquo;s also a London cabby who literally tells Aslan that he&rsquo;ll be king of Narnia if his awesome wife gets to come too&hellip;and there&rsquo;s a horse named Strawberry that turns into a Pegasus. So what&rsquo;s not to like? People may complain about all the religious metaphors and creationism, but come on lighten up. At least it&rsquo;s not horribly racist, and you&rsquo;ll long for the simple biblical similarities when you&rsquo;re faced with the layers of religious offense in The Last Battle. <b>9/10</b></p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"2\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><br /></p><p><b>The Last Battle</b> by C.S. Lewis (mild spoilers): The final book in the Chronicles of Narnia series, in which the world ends because a talking ape convinces a donkey to dress up as Aslan to trick all the Narnians into giving them stuff. There&rsquo;s a lot more to this plot, but those are the basics. There is a TON of stuff to unpack in this epic conclusion, and this isn&rsquo;t even the half of it. </p><p>This book seems like the Last Jedi for this series, in that some people are incredibly moved by it and are very happy with the conclusion our main characters have been given, and some people think it&rsquo;s a pile of crap. I think there is good in this book. But, putting aside my good feelings for a second, THE LAST BATTLE IS ONE OF THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLY RACIST THINGS I&rsquo;VE EVER READ&hellip;voluntarily anyway. Seriously, if you thought The Horse and His Boy was bad, you ain&rsquo;t seen nothing yet. There are many layers of why this particular plot in the series is so offensive I could write essays on why this book should be thrown out the window. Not to mention the Susan problem. So I&rsquo;ll say, that even though there were good things in this book, it doesn&rsquo;t excuse&hellip;everything else. Also Eustace isn&rsquo;t as snarky in this one&hellip;I miss my sarcastic sass boy.</p><p>HOWEVER, unlike some people, I think it was exactly the conclusion that the series has been leading up to since the beginning. I think the plot of an imposter Aslan and the effect it would have on Narnians is cool. And much like the book of Revelation, the end of the world is weird, confusing, and dark as fuck considering this is a children&rsquo;s book. He invokes an amazing sense of fear and sadness, considering we just saw the birth of Narnia in the last book. And I am one of the people who loved the last few pages. It was an interesting take on heaven, theology, and the questions of &ldquo;is Aslan also Tash? Is one religion better? Are all gods the same?&rdquo; are dealt with very well considering that was one of the most problematic aspects of the book. I love literally all the characters you can think of reuniting in the end&hellip;except for Susan. I will say, Susan no longer being a friend of Narnia was led up to throughout the other books, and I think what Polly says about her wanting to be grown up rings true&hellip;in a sense. What we really need is a new series for Susan where she becomes a friend of Narnia again and gets her happy ending, rather than just &ldquo;oh look makeup, guess I can&rsquo;t be in Narnia anymore.&rdquo; AND YET Lewis finally abandoned the idea of &ldquo;girls shouldn&rsquo;t be fighting&rdquo; and made Jill a super secret ninja spy/badass archer warrior woman. So&hellip;I can&rsquo;t even say it&rsquo;s as sexist as the other books. There&rsquo;s also a male talking unicorn who is best friends with the current king&hellip;and it kind of seems like they have a thing for each other&hellip;so there&rsquo;s that.</p><p>Some people are angry that it is so religiously based and the allegories are so in your face, but at this point if you&rsquo;re reading the Chronicles of Narnia and are upset that there&rsquo;s religion in it, I don&rsquo;t know what to tell you. Truthfully, I thought he did the allegory for the church controlling the population very well, and the idea judgement based on whether you actively hate Aslan instead of being about how you&rsquo;re either a good or bad person was so cool and different. But honestly, I just don&rsquo;t know what to feel. I&rsquo;m happy for the characters in the end&hellip;I liked the overall idea of this final book&hellip;but man it can be super uncomfortable to the point that I don&rsquo;t even want to rate it. </p><h2><b>TV Shows!</b></h2><p><b>Kitten Rescuers</b>: Why yes, it is the incredibly wholesome British TV show about the RSPCA going around and rescuing cats from bizarre and/or dangerous situations, like being stuck up chimneys or drain pipes. And yes, it is the purest thing you will ever watch, even with My Roommate is a Cat in the running as the best cat themed show of the year. I don&rsquo;t care if it seems like a big commercial for the RSPCA sometimes, I just want to see some cute kittens get their happy endings. My only complaint is that there&rsquo;s only 8 episodes on Netflix, and I&rsquo;m desperate for more. <b>100 adorable feline friends/10</b></p><p><b>Re: Zero Starting Life in Another World</b>: You know, the anime everyone lost their shit over in 2016? The isekai where the main protagonist keeps re-spawning every time he dies in the fantasy world he is magically transported to and does nothing but suffer? But hey it has those two twin maids with the pink and blue hair in it so it&rsquo;s all fine? That one. The English dub finally released the second half of the show, so I finished it.
