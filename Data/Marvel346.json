Steve snatches his phone from his\npocket hitting redial. No answer.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; Steve swallows.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Nope. Nope. I call smoke.&rdquo; Sam sighs. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re three hours from home. He smoked\nus.&rdquo; Sam almost sounded panicked.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Buck call Nat, send her over to check the house.&rdquo; Steve demands. Standing up\nand heading out of the bakery.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Peter you better drive fast.&rdquo; Buck grumbles as they all head for the truck\nabandoning their positions.</p><p><br />\n&ldquo;Nat says the house is locked up and her car is gone.&rdquo; Buck sighs from the back\nseat.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No. She wouldn&rsquo;t go without answering her phone. She knows.&rdquo; Steve shakes his\nhead. He grabs his phone from the cup holder, dialing quickly. &ldquo;Tony.&rdquo; Steve\nglances out the window.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What can I do for you Rogers?&rdquo; Tony chuckles.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&rsquo;s not answering her phone.&rdquo; He swallows the bile in the back of his\nthroat.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wanda isn&rsquo;t either.&rdquo; Sam sucks in a deep breathe.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Same for Wanda. The girls were supposed to be shopping with Ari today. Can&rsquo;t\nget a hold of them.&rdquo; He explains. &ldquo;Do me a favor, track their phones?&rdquo; His jaw\nclenching.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;On it. I&rsquo;ll call back with the locations.&rdquo; Tony was suddenly serious.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; Steve jabs end, shifting in his seat. &ldquo;Can you\nspeed it up?&rdquo; He looks over at Peter.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Steve, I&rsquo;m doing Ninety on the high way. I go any faster and I won&rsquo;t be able\nto weave in and out of traffic.&rdquo; Peter tips his head briefly.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; Steve nods. <br /></p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Brad.&rdquo; You shake, squeezing your crying daughter.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going for a trip.&rdquo; Brad points the gun at you.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay. There is no need for that.&rdquo; Your voice shakes.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Your right, if you just weren&rsquo;t a lying whore.&rdquo; He growls. &ldquo;Move now!&rdquo; He\nsnaps.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I need the diaper bag.&rdquo; You shake as you point to the bag next to the door\nwhere Wanda lies unmoving. Brad snatches it up, before he points the gun at\nyour side and shoves you out the front door. </p><p>&ldquo;Put her in the car.&rdquo; He demands. You nod, putting Ari in\nher seat as she screams and cries. You hand her Jr. Theo&rsquo;s replacement, she\nclings on weeping into it.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay baby. We&rsquo;re fine.&rdquo; You brush her hair back from her face. Your voice\nshakes and sound unsure, doing nothing to calm her.</p><p>&ldquo;Climb in.&rdquo; He waves the gun at you. Brad shoves two\novernight bags into the back with Ari before he slams the door shut.</p><p>&ldquo;You point that thing at her and I&rsquo;ll kill you myself.&rdquo; You\nwarn him as you scoot across the seat into the passenger seat.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You sure you won&rsquo;t have your little biker fuck buddy do it for you?&rdquo; He\nchuckles, getting in behind the wheel. He starts your truck, backing out.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You harm a hair on my child&rsquo;s head and I won&rsquo;t need Steve. You&rsquo;ll find out\nwhat mommy rage really is.&rdquo; You sneer at him.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a balls bitch Y/N.&rdquo; He chuckles.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dead bitch Brad.&rdquo; You smirk at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Actually, you&rsquo;ll be the dead bitch if your little boyfriend\nand his gang of fuck boys don&rsquo;t give up the code.&rdquo; His lips curl up.</p><p>&ldquo;Pathetic little man, you failed to realize you couldn&rsquo;t get\ninto the safe you stole. Boy, you&rsquo;re a smart cookie.&rdquo; You smirk. His hand\nlashes out and slams into your face, your head hits the window. Ari screams\nlouder, crying out Momma, over and over.</p><p>&ldquo;SHUT UP!&rdquo; Brad&rsquo;s voice fills the car, as he shouts.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; You reach back grabbing Ari&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; You try to\ncomfort her.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It will be when you get a hold of that fucker.&rdquo; Brad growls.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You speak like that to my daughter and I&rsquo;ll crash this fucking car.&rdquo; You hiss\nat him.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t dare.&rdquo; Brad glances at you.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s strapped in, top of the line car seat. I&rsquo;ll wreck this bitch. Try me.&rdquo;\nYou growl low enough just for him to hear. He swallows, gripping the wheel\nharder. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought.&rdquo; You settle back into your seat, trying to\nthink of a way to get out of this without getting Ari hurt. Your heartaches for\nWanda, oh god she couldn&rsquo;t die, she just couldn&rsquo;t. <br /></p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wanda&rsquo;s phone is pinging at your house Steve.&rdquo; Tony sighs.\n&ldquo;Y/N&rsquo;s is, well that&rsquo;s a different story.&rdquo; He clears his throat.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Where is she Tony?!&rdquo; Steve slams his hand down on the dash.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s heading back where you were.&rdquo; He admits softly.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Fuck.&rdquo; Steve&rsquo;s stomach drops. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey, hey!!!&rdquo; Buck&rsquo;s yelling as they slow on the street of the house.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Peter slams on the breaks.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;THAT&rsquo;S THE TRUCK!&rdquo; Buck shouts jumping out of the truck. Steve&rsquo;s head whips\naround, spotting Brad&rsquo;s red truck. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cold!&rdquo; Buck kicks the tire. Steve&rsquo;s\nphone hits the floor boards, as he stumbles out of the truck, running towards\nthe house. His keys in hand, Y/N&rsquo;s car gone, he throws the door open, in the\ndark he can see the shadow of the body on the floor. His hand hits the light\nswitch and he drops to his knees, gathering her up in his arms.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wanda. Come on, wake up doll. Wake up for me.&rdquo; He pats her cheeks. &ldquo;WANDA WAKE\nUP!&rdquo; He shouts. Sam&rsquo;s stumbling up the steps of the porch, dropping to his\nknees next to Steve.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Move morons!&rdquo; Luke scoops her up in his arms moving towards the couch, he tips\nher head, feeling for a pulse before he puts his ear to her chest. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah, four houses in from the corner. She&rsquo;s not\nresponsive.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s yelling into his phone. Steve jumps up running up the\nstairs, throwing open their bedroom door, checking the bathroom. He pauses for\na moment, something on the bathroom counter that caught his attention. He holds\nthe box in his hands, nodding before he sets it back down heading out of the\nroom again and storming down the stairs.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ari&rsquo;s gone too. This fuck has my daughter and my girl.&rdquo; Steve looks around. &ldquo;Sam\nstay with Wanda. Someone call Barton. I&rsquo;m putting this fuck down.&rdquo; He lays down\nhis authority. The guys nod, heading for the door.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Call us when you know she&rsquo;s okay!&rdquo; Buck yells back at Sam as the ambulance\nrolls up.</p><p>&ldquo;In the living room.&rdquo; Peter directs them before they jump\ninto the truck and peel out.</p><hr /><p><b>AU Summer Tag List:</b> (Open still)<br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNANElQcUwUdgY1_eeY0rpg\">@shliic</a> &nbsp;

        "body": "<p>The following contains Overwatch, Marvel comics, Boruto, and RWBY, and none of it makes any sense.</p><p>So, it starts off with Overwatch, right?</p><p>So some people are escorting a payload, and it\u2019s on\nJunkertown, and you have to remember that these are the real characters in this\ndream, not people playing a game. Zenyatta\u2019s there, and he\u2019s on the payload,\nbut his team is being held up at the corner right after the big health pack in\nthe shed at the start. But then Zenyatta does Transcendence, and they\u2019re able\nto push. So Zenyatta is sitting on the payload, but Widowmaker is on the enemy\nteam, and about to line him up and kill him. That\u2019s when Tracer gets on the\npayload with Zenyatta, and starts running and jumping around him so Widow can\u2019t\nline up the shot (instead of just like telling Zenyatta about Widow and having\nhim move, but hey whatever), because she can just recall if she gets shot. So\nright when the payload gets to the first checkpoint, it stops being Junkertown,\nand now it\u2019s like some floor in a hotel, and it\u2019s got a red carpet (not a rug\nlike \u201cthe red carpet\u201d is, but an actual full on red carpeting) and there were\nthree elevators. The payload was in front of one elevator, and Widow was still\ntrying to shoot Zenyatta (from where? I don\u2019t know, it wasn\u2019t specified).</p><p>And this is where it gets weird.</p><!-- more --><p>Flying out in the middle of the night around the building\nwhere the payload is, is the Sam Wilson version of Captain America (which was\nsomething I didn\u2019t realize until I woke up and was able to properly ID this\nweird red white and blue guy who was flying around), who is on his way to meet\nup with Boruto Uzumaki and Sarada Uchiha, and it\u2019s important to note that I\u2019VE\nNEVER WATCHED OR READ BORUTO A DAY IN MY LIFE. I didn\u2019t even watch the movie,\nand I\u2019ve seen sporadic clips here and there. But yeah, he\u2019s got a picture of\nSarada and she\u2019s got some weird sigil on her forehead that was apparently\nwords, because my brain tried to interpret them, and Sam called her whatever\nthat sigil was supposed to say, and he said it clear as day. As a matter of\nfact, I only know Boruto was involved in this because my brain told me he was,\nbecause BORUTO NEVER SHOWS UP OR IS EVEN MENTIONED IN THIS DREAM. So anyway, he\u2019s\nflying around the building where the payload is, right? Just coincidentally.\nBut then someone on comm-unit contacts him and explains the situation with\nWidowmaker. So he lands on the building, and immediately enacts some security\nprotocols that shield the building in some way, and that takes care of Widow I\nguess. And he\u2019s talking to the protocols and says something like \u201cLet me know\nif any unauthorized persona gets inside the building.\u201d So he\u2019s already put\nprotocols in place but he goes inside anyway.</p><p>BUT HE GOES INSIDE BY CUTTING THROUGH THE WINDOW WITH A LASER\nHE MOST CERTAINLY DOESN\u2019T HAVE. And then the alarms go off, and he\u2019s like \u201cI\ndidn\u2019t mean if it was me.\u201d And the alarms turn off.</p><p>Remember when I said it would get weird? Well, Zenyatta is\ngone. And then the elevator in front of the payload, which is still there,\nopens up, and some Avenger who does not exist anywhere in canon shows up, and\nthen over on the payload is Tracer, and she shows relief when this Avenger\nshows up, because apparently Tracer\u2019s in the Avengers now \u2013 and did I forget to\nmention I favor DC over Marvel? Why I was dreaming about the Avengers, I don\u2019t\nknow. Anyway, it turns out Tracer got comfortable too early, because this\nAvenger had gone rogue, and started attacking them. Pretty soon both she and\nthis nondescript Avenger both completely disappear, and from the elevators\nbehind the payload come a whole bunch of these guys with guns, so Sam has to go\nquietly, but they\u2019re lobbing racial and homosexual slurs at him, which doesn\u2019t\nmake sense because Sam isn\u2019t gay, but maybe this is a holdover from the fact\nthat Tracer is, and she existed within this dream at some point. So Sam\nsurrenders, right? But then outside the building, Magneto\u2019s floating and he\nsees the whole thing going on, and he\u2019s like \u201cOh no. I can\u2019t let this happen.\u201d\n(Because if you weren\u2019t aware, he\u2019s been a good guy for a while in the comics, at\nleast last time I checked)</p><p>So he comes into the building, and I have no idea what\nhappens next, because all of a sudden, we\u2019re transported to Sarada Uchiha and\nKakashi Hatake, and Sarada doesn\u2019t have that sigil from earlier, so I guess we\u2019re\njust not gonna talk about that. And just to give a bit of an update if you\ndropped off during Naruto, or otherwise haven\u2019t seen recent material, but both\nof Kakashi\u2019s eyes work just fine now, so he doesn\u2019t have to constantly cover a\nSharingan eye.</p><p>But he and Sarada are in like some military base, and it\u2019s\nsnowing, and they seem to be behind enemy lines, and they haven\u2019t been\ndiscovered, but they can\u2019t wait for Captain America any longer. So they realize\nthey\u2019re gonna have to be real sneaky about this, so Kakashi comes to the\nconclusion that he needs to cover his eye like he did back in the day in order\nto accomplish this, so he pulls his headband down, and for a moment he\u2019s having\na problem remembering which direction his hair is supposed to be pointing over\nthe headband, even though it\u2019s pointing in the same direction as it always has\nbeen. So they start sneaking out, but they get caught almost immediately. But\nthen they manage to lose the people who caught them because they saw some girl\nswinging in circles on a street lamp, and decided to do the same thing with a\nlamp that was nearby, but Sarada disguised herself as a red bag of food (which\nI believe included out-of-the-packaging pizza rolls and pretzels) and Kakashi\ndisguised himself as like a twelve year old boy and tied the Sarada bag of food\nto his ankle before he started swinging around the pole. Then some soldiers\ntold them to get down and they threw the \u201cbag of food\u201d into a wheelbarrow with\nother actual bags of food, and Kakashi was told he had to help push the\nwheelbarrow through a tunnel on some train tracks (I assume in order to get the\nsupplies to some allies who needed them), and no I don\u2019t know why they accepted\nthis weird little boy and just told him to do some work. Not sure what happened\nto that little girl, but hey. So while Kakashi and the soldiers are pushing the\nwheelbarrow, and one of them makes a White Rose joke about the red food bag and\nthe snow, which is so loose a connection, but hey, and if you\u2019re not sure what\nthat is, let me explain that it\u2019s a pairing in the series RWBY (which is weird\nbecause I don\u2019t ship White Rose). But the important thing here is that since\nthey made that joke, it\u2019s rather clear that RWBY is a fictional series here,\nright? That they\u2019re not real people? That\u2019s fair to assume.</p><p>So anyway, we cut to a little bit later with no closure on\nwhat was going on, but still with Kakashi and Sarada, and we see that they\u2019re\nbeing led around by someone who\u2019s on their side, and of course that person is\nan older version of Ruby Rose, the protagonist of RWBY. And that\u2019s it. It ended\nthere. Not sure what happened to Zenyatta, Widowmaker, Tracer, Captain America,\nthe unnamed Avenger, Magneto, those guys in black, Boruto, the little girl\nswinging on the pole, or those soldiers, but apparently Ruby\u2019s working with\nKakashi and Sarada to do something, and I have no idea what.</p>",

Why I was dreaming about the Avengers, I don\u2019t\nknow. Anyway, it turns out Tracer got comfortable too early, because this\nAvenger had gone rogue, and started attacking them. Pretty soon both she and\nthis nondescript Avenger both completely disappear, and from the elevators\nbehind the payload come a whole bunch of these guys with guns, so Sam has to go\nquietly, but they\u2019re lobbing racial and homosexual slurs at him, which doesn\u2019t\nmake sense because Sam isn\u2019t gay, but maybe this is a holdover from the fact\nthat Tracer is, and she existed within this dream at some point. So Sam\nsurrenders, right? But then outside the building, Magneto\u2019s floating and he\nsees the whole thing going on, and he\u2019s like \u201cOh no. I can\u2019t let this happen.\u201d\n(Because if you weren\u2019t aware, he\u2019s been a good guy for a while in the comics, at\nleast last time I checked)</p><p>So he comes into the building, and I have no idea what\nhappens next, because all of a sudden, we\u2019re transported to Sarada Uchiha and\nKakashi Hatake, and Sarada doesn\u2019t have that sigil from earlier, so I guess we\u2019re\njust not gonna talk about that. And just to give a bit of an update if you\ndropped off during Naruto, or otherwise haven\u2019t seen recent material, but both\nof Kakashi\u2019s eyes work just fine now, so he doesn\u2019t have to constantly cover a\nSharingan eye.</p><p>But he and Sarada are in like some military base, and it\u2019s\nsnowing, and they seem to be behind enemy lines, and they haven\u2019t been\ndiscovered, but they can\u2019t wait for Captain America any longer. So they realize\nthey\u2019re gonna have to be real sneaky about this, so Kakashi comes to the\nconclusion that he needs to cover his eye like he did back in the day in order\nto accomplish this, so he pulls his headband down, and for a moment he\u2019s having\na problem remembering which direction his hair is supposed to be pointing over\nthe headband, even though it\u2019s pointing in the same direction as it always has\nbeen. So they start sneaking out, but they get caught almost immediately. But\nthen they manage to lose the people who caught them because they saw some girl\nswinging in circles on a street lamp, and decided to do the same thing with a\nlamp that was nearby, but Sarada disguised herself as a red bag of food (which\nI believe included out-of-the-packaging pizza rolls and pretzels) and Kakashi\ndisguised himself as like a twelve year old boy and tied the Sarada bag of food\nto his ankle before he started swinging around the pole. Then some soldiers\ntold them to get down and they threw the \u201cbag of food\u201d into a wheelbarrow with\nother actual bags of food, and Kakashi was told he had to help push the\nwheelbarrow through a tunnel on some train tracks (I assume in order to get the\nsupplies to some allies who needed them), and no I don\u2019t know why they accepted\nthis weird little boy and just told him to do some work. Not sure what happened\nto that little girl, but hey. So while Kakashi and the soldiers are pushing the\nwheelbarrow, and one of them makes a White Rose joke about the red food bag and\nthe snow, which is so loose a connection, but hey, and if you\u2019re not sure what\nthat is, let me explain that it\u2019s a pairing in the series RWBY (which is weird\nbecause I don\u2019t ship White Rose). But the important thing here is that since\nthey made that joke, it\u2019s rather clear that RWBY is a fictional series here,\nright? That they\u2019re not real people? That\u2019s fair to assume.</p><p>So anyway, we cut to a little bit later with no closure on\nwhat was going on, but still with Kakashi and Sarada, and we see that they\u2019re\nbeing led around by someone who\u2019s on their side, and of course that person is\nan older version of Ruby Rose, the protagonist of RWBY. And that\u2019s it. It ended\nthere. Not sure what happened to Zenyatta, Widowmaker, Tracer, Captain America,\nthe unnamed Avenger, Magneto, those guys in black, Boruto, the little girl\nswinging on the pole, or those soldiers, but apparently Ruby\u2019s working with\nKakashi and Sarada to do something, and I have no idea what.</p>",

So\nright when the payload gets to the first checkpoint, it stops being Junkertown,\nand now it\u2019s like some floor in a hotel, and it\u2019s got a red carpet (not a rug\nlike \u201cthe red carpet\u201d is, but an actual full on red carpeting) and there were\nthree elevators.
