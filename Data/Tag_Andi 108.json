But if they\u2019re gonna go that route, I think it would be better from a storytelling perspective to show Cyrus not automatically accept it, and to show Cyrus <i>demand </i>the sincere and sentimental apology he deserves. It would really complete the overlapping character development and relationship development between TJ and Cyrus. Because it would be TJ essentially giving Cyrus that final push to stand up for himself and demand what he deserves. And at the same time it would be Cyrus giving TJ that final push to be vulnerable and open and honest. And it would ultimately result in them getting together as well. So like\u2026 it would be a very good way to wrap up their story.\u00a0</p><p>If I gotta sit through another cringey rap, I want it to at least be handled in a way where Cyrus is just as disappointed by it as I will be ok lmao.

We have seen a lot of Disney Channel\u2019s shows make it to that point without having to become too inappropriate for Disney Channel, and I think there would still be ways to do that for Andi Mack if they wanted to. And I think it would be smart of Disney Channel to do something like that, because they aren\u2019t making series that have lasting impact anymore like Boy Meets World or That\u2019s So Raven, which lead them to be able to do the spin-offs they have been doing recently. None of their original shows in the past few years have lasted long enough or made a big enough impression on audiences to still be relevant in 10 years - <i>except </i>for Andi Mack tbh. It\u2019s the only thing they\u2019ve got with potential to be timeless. </p><p>I think it would have a better chance of being successful if they moved it over to Disney+ as we all know, but it would still be a Disney show. I\u2019m not sure if anyone would actually be <i>interested</i> in the show lasting that long, but from a storytelling perspective I think it would be possible. </p><p>If they decide to renew the series, I think there would be a chance of it being moved to Disney+ but that\u2019s just because it seems like such an obvious choice to me. I have no idea what is actually going on behind the scenes at Disney so I can\u2019t really know the likelihood of that lol.</p>",
