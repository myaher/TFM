I know for sure <i>I </i>didn&rsquo;t organise it \u2013 wasn&rsquo;t there an age limit on that? My mum was in her fifties now, come on&hellip; \u2013 but somebody had. One of my mum&rsquo;s friend&rsquo;s daughters, I think. </p><!-- more --><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All I knew was that Brie and I had to make an appearance, so here we were. In some stinky bar with a group of women I only knew half of and didn&rsquo;t care for any of them. They were the kind of people I saw at an event for my mum or something. They weren&rsquo;t bad people, just not my cup of tea. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Girls! You made it!&ldquo; Madison, my mum&rsquo;s friend&rsquo;s daughter screamed with delight, dragging Brie and I to some chairs. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Had no choice&hellip;,&rdquo; I mumbled to which Brie nudged me and smiled at Madison. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Of course! It&rsquo;s a special night for Y/M/N,&ldquo; Brie said, looking to my mum, who was smiling. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I appreciate this, girls, thank you,&rdquo; my mum said, looking between us all. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not as young as I used to be, so I apologise if I leave early.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Madison laughed and wrapped an arm around my mum&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll start off easy, Y/M/N.&rdquo; Madison looked between us all with mischievous eyes. &ldquo;Shots for everyone!&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everyone cheered, even Naomi who didn&rsquo;t seem as annoying as usual. Brie laughed and I forced a small smile, feeling a little out of place. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A waiter came to the table, setting down a tray of shot glasses filled with god knew what. Everybody was loud and excited and eventually drinking, and I felt uncomfortable. I was never one for drinking and bars and parties, so this wasn&rsquo;t fun for me like it was for everyone else. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next hour was just me watching everyone else get progressively drunker and it was quite amusing to be the only sober one. Even my mum was out of it which was definitely a sight. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;&hellip;Isaac treats me well and I can&rsquo;t wait to be his wife,&ldquo; she slurred, a grin on her lips. Everybody listened intently as she continued. &quot;He&rsquo;s not too bad in bed either, ladies.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I choked on my water and everybody laughed. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;This is my cue to leave and be anywhere else but here,&ldquo; I announced, standing up and heading to the bar, hearing their laughter from behind me. That was <i>way </i>too much information for me to deal with. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I took at a seat at the bar and asked the bartender for a sprite, which he gave me pretty quickly. I felt a presence behind me and somebody&rsquo;s hand on my back soon enough. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Hey, you all good?&rdquo; It was Brie and she took a seat beside me, a drink in hand and a smile on her lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Yeah, just needed to get away from all of <i>that,</i>&ldquo; I said, nodding in my mum&rsquo;s direction. &quot;How about you? You seem to be enjoying yourself.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie nodded, sipping her drink. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fun, I gotta admit. I thought I&rsquo;d be uncomfortable at first, but it&rsquo;s alright. And a drink doesn&rsquo;t hurt, does it?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I laughed as she clinked her glass with mine. She was a little tipsy and it was definitely a sight to see. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You can go back,&ldquo; I said, smiling knowingly at her. &quot;I don&rsquo;t need a babysitter.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;You sure?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I nodded, slurping my sprite from my straw. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure. I got my drink and I&rsquo;m not hearing about my mum&rsquo;s sex life. All is right with the world.&rdquo; She laughed and I nodded her way. &ldquo;Go have some fun. You deserve it after this week.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She grinned and jumped off her stool. &ldquo;Thanks, Y/N,&rdquo; she said, giving me a haste kiss on the cheek which took me by surprise. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She disappeared from my side and I was left reminded by the thought of her lips against my own. I glanced over my shoulder and saw her having fun with the other girls. I cracked a small smile, glad at least <i>she </i>was enjoying herself. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Another hour in and my mum had gone back to her room, tired and almost out of it. Majority of the girls were drunk by now, either flirting with whoever happened to walk by or daring to try the karaoke machine with a drink in their hand. Seeing someone fall of the stage was definitely the highlight of my evening. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I wanted to leave of course, but I didn&rsquo;t because Brie was having way too much fun. I think she&rsquo;d even befriended one of the girls which was nice to see. I wanted to make sure she&rsquo;d get back to our room safe, so I stayed for as long as she would, busying myself with a book I&rsquo;d snuck along with me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was sat on a chair in the least busy part of the bar, by a coffee table with my glass of water on it, untouched, when I heard Brie yell my name. I looked up and was immediately sat on by the drunk blonde, forcing me to drop my book and catch her to sit her up straight. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Brie, what are you doing?&ldquo; I asked, smiling with amusement at the giggling girl. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I missed you,&rdquo; she admitted, resting her head in my neck. I could see she had yet another drink in her hand and the alcohol was strong on her breath. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Brie, you should maybe wrap it up for the night,&ldquo; I suggested, taking the glass from her hand and putting it on the coffee table. I grabbed my glass of water and said, &quot;Here, drink this.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She pushed it away, grinning. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to! I want to tell you something.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You&rsquo;ll thank me in the morning, Brie, c'mon,&ldquo; I said, forcing her to hold it. &quot;You finish that glass and I&rsquo;ll listen to what you want to say. Fair?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She sighed. &ldquo;Fair.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I watched as she downed the water before she set the glass on the coffee table clumsily, almost falling off my lap. She laughed as she got comfortable before laying on my chest, hugging me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;So what did you want to tell me, Brie?&ldquo; I asked her, an amused smile on my face. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She wasn&rsquo;t laughing anymore, but a smile was on her lips. &quot;I should have asked you out.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I raised my eyebrows. &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She sat up straight and looked me dead in the eyes, still smiling. &ldquo;When we first met. Our fake dating story. Of how we met. The story was that I asked you out after I moved in. I should have. I wanted to. Really wanted to, not just for this fake date.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was surprised as I asked, &ldquo;You wanted to ask me out?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She rested a hand on my shoulder and nodded. &ldquo;I had a crush on you when we first met and I was planning on asking you out. I just couldn&rsquo;t do it. I was too scared because we became good friends and I didn&rsquo;t want to ruin it. I was stupid. I should have asked you out.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My mouth went dry as I blinked. &ldquo;Erm&hellip; I&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Would you have said yes?&ldquo; she asked, not breaking our gaze. Her smile faded. &quot;If I had asked you. Pretend we just met and I asked you out. Would you have said yes?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I breathed out, feeling intimidated under her confident stare. &ldquo;I\u2013&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Brie, c'mon!&ldquo; Madison yelled from the stage. &quot;It&rsquo;s our turn for karaoke!&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie turned around, momentarily distracted and laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming!&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I felt my heart racing as she turned to face me again, a smile on her lips again, as if she forgot what she asked me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I want to kiss you so bad,&ldquo; she admitted, leaning close. &quot;Ever since you kissed me the other day.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Brie, you&rsquo;re drunk,&ldquo; I said, not wanting her to do anything whilst she wasn&rsquo;t thinking straight. But damn, I really wanted to kiss her, too.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She moved closer, her eyes dark and unreadable. &quot;I know. I would never say all this sober, would I?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She leaned forward and kissed me on the cheek before jumping off my lap and running to Madison, as if nothing just happened. I released a breath I&rsquo;d been holding and ran a hand through my hair. Brie has feelings for me, all this time, and I&rsquo;d completely missed it&hellip; </p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Come on, just put this on and then you&rsquo;re done,&ldquo; I said to Brie, struggling to pull her pyjama shirt over her head. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her giggles filled the dark hotel room as she laid back on the bed, wearing her pyjama pants (which took me a long time to get her into) and her bra. She smiled up at the ceiling, though God knew what she was thinking. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Shirt then bed, Brie, c'mon,&rdquo; I insisted for the umpteenth time. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her eyes flickered to me, a smile still gracing her lips. She finally sat up and I pulled her shirt over her head, helping her get her arms through. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Finally,&ldquo; I sighed, smiling to myself. &quot;Now bed time. You&rsquo;re gonna need all the rest you can get.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Because the wedding is tomorrow!&ldquo; she pointed out, a grin on her lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Exactly,&rdquo; I agreed, leading her under the covers before getting in beside her. &ldquo;Now lets get some sleep.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I yawned and turned around, my back facing Brie. Truth be told, I was still surprised at what Brie told me earlier this evening. She had liked me this whole time and I guess it kind of explained a lot&hellip; Admittedly, I&rsquo;d liked her, too, when we first met. I mean, she was this beautiful, radiant, well-spoken woman I was about to move in with, but I couldn&rsquo;t exactly do anything, could I? We became friends and I guess I suppressed my feelings for so long and tried to dismiss them as pure admiration&hellip; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Up was down and left was right at the moment, so all I could do was wait until tomorrow and see if Brie remembered. If she didn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;d have to see if I had the guts to bring it up.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Woah, Brie, what are you doing?&ldquo; </p><p>I froze, lifting my arm up as I felt Brie spoon me from behind, snuggling her head into my shoulder. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She sighed out, her breath tickling my neck. &quot;You&rsquo;re comfy&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Brie&hellip;&ldquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Night, Y/N&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sighed, still a little unsure with what to do, but also revelling in how comfortable she was. Finally, exhaustion making most of the decision, I rested my hand on top of hers and closed my eyes, trying to fall asleep. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All would be revealed in the morning, I guess. </p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I ended up waking up earlier than Brie the following morning, so I escaped from her hold and jumped in the shower, feeling unsure of what the day would hold.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When I finished showering, I got into some shorts and a tee before deeming it late enough to open the curtains. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie groaned under the covers and raised her hand to block out the sun that poured into the room. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;m hungry, get up,&ldquo; I said, already heading to the phone to order room service. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Go downstairs and eat,&rdquo; she mumbled tiredly, still half asleep. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;And risk looking like a loner? No thank you. Now c'mon. Get up so we can eat.&ldquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She groaned with annoyance as I scanned the breakfast menu beside our bed. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You&rsquo;re so lucky the wedding is in the evening,&rdquo; I pointed out, not looking up. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna have the worst hangover today.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She groaned again, louder this time, making me chuckle. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I think I&rsquo;m gonna get some boiled eggs and toast,&ldquo; I said aloud, before glancing to Brie. &quot;You want pancakes?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She didn&rsquo;t respond, but simply raised her thumb in the air, making me laugh again. I ordered some food to our room as Brie peeled herself out of bed and headed to the bathroom. I heard the shower running, so busied myself by making the bed and finding some painkillers to help ease Brie&rsquo;s head for when she came out. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Admittedly, I grew nervous of what she would say when she did come out \u2013 would she remember what she said last night? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The food arriving was the perfect distraction that I gladly accepted. I thanked the room service waiter and just on time, Brie walked out the bathroom with wet hair and wearing a bathrobe. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Medicine and water is there,&ldquo; I said, nodding to the dresser by the bathroom door. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Thank you,&rdquo; she mumbled, downing the water in a few gulps along with her tablets. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Got you pancakes with syrup and some scrambled eggs,&ldquo; I said, taking a seat at the table. &quot;You doing okay?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She took a seat beside me and nodded, digging straight into the food, making me smile with amusement. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;What happened last night?&ldquo; she finally spoke, furrowing her eyebrows. &quot;The last thing I remember is watching someone fall off the stage at karaoke.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I pursed my lips. &ldquo;Yeah, after that you drank a lot. You seemed like you were having fun.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She nodded, before glancing at me with a worried look. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say or do anything stupid, did I?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I paused, stuck on whether or not I should tell her what she said. I wanted to, but maybe this was a sign? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Oh, god, what did I do?&ldquo; she realised, facepalming. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Nothing, don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; I reassured. &ldquo;You conked out pretty quickly when I brought you back here.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She sighed with relief and continued to eat her food. I tried to do the same, but I couldn&rsquo;t take my eyes off her. Had I done the right thing in not bringing it up? Because if I had, things could change between us, in a good way&hellip; isn&rsquo;t that what I wanted? What she wanted? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Do I have something on my face?&ldquo; she asked, pulling me from my thoughts. &quot;You&rsquo;re staring.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She began to wipe at her mouth with a napkin adorably, making me smile.

I know for sure <i>I </i>didn\u2019t organise it \u2013 wasn\u2019t there an age limit on that? My mum was in her fifties now, come on\u2026 \u2013 but somebody had. One of my mum\u2019s friend\u2019s daughters, I think. </p>[[MORE]]<p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All I knew was that Brie and I had to make an appearance, so here we were. In some stinky bar with a group of women I only knew half of and didn\u2019t care for any of them. They were the kind of people I saw at an event for my mum or something. They weren\u2019t bad people, just not my cup of tea. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Girls! You made it!\u201c Madison, my mum\u2019s friend\u2019s daughter screamed with delight, dragging Brie and I to some chairs. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Had no choice\u2026,\u201d I mumbled to which Brie nudged me and smiled at Madison. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course! It\u2019s a special night for Y/M/N,\u201c Brie said, looking to my mum, who was smiling. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I appreciate this, girls, thank you,\u201d my mum said, looking between us all. \u201cI\u2019m not as young as I used to be, so I apologise if I leave early.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Madison laughed and wrapped an arm around my mum\u2019s shoulders. \u201cWe\u2019ll start off easy, Y/M/N.\u201d Madison looked between us all with mischievous eyes. \u201cShots for everyone!\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everyone cheered, even Naomi who didn\u2019t seem as annoying as usual. Brie laughed and I forced a small smile, feeling a little out of place. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A waiter came to the table, setting down a tray of shot glasses filled with god knew what. Everybody was loud and excited and eventually drinking, and I felt uncomfortable. I was never one for drinking and bars and parties, so this wasn\u2019t fun for me like it was for everyone else. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next hour was just me watching everyone else get progressively drunker and it was quite amusing to be the only sober one. Even my mum was out of it which was definitely a sight. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"\u2026Isaac treats me well and I can\u2019t wait to be his wife,\u201c she slurred, a grin on her lips. Everybody listened intently as she continued. \"He\u2019s not too bad in bed either, ladies.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I choked on my water and everybody laughed. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This is my cue to leave and be anywhere else but here,\u201c I announced, standing up and heading to the bar, hearing their laughter from behind me. That was <i>way </i>too much information for me to deal with. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I took at a seat at the bar and asked the bartender for a sprite, which he gave me pretty quickly. I felt a presence behind me and somebody\u2019s hand on my back soon enough. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, you all good?\u201d It was Brie and she took a seat beside me, a drink in hand and a smile on her lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, just needed to get away from all of <i>that,</i>\u201c I said, nodding in my mum\u2019s direction. \"How about you? You seem to be enjoying yourself.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie nodded, sipping her drink. \u201cIt\u2019s fun, I gotta admit. I thought I\u2019d be uncomfortable at first, but it\u2019s alright. And a drink doesn\u2019t hurt, does it?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I laughed as she clinked her glass with mine. She was a little tipsy and it was definitely a sight to see. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You can go back,\u201c I said, smiling knowingly at her. \"I don\u2019t need a babysitter.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou sure?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I nodded, slurping my sprite from my straw. \u201cI\u2019m sure. I got my drink and I\u2019m not hearing about my mum\u2019s sex life. All is right with the world.\u201d She laughed and I nodded her way. \u201cGo have some fun. You deserve it after this week.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She grinned and jumped off her stool. \u201cThanks, Y/N,\u201d she said, giving me a haste kiss on the cheek which took me by surprise. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She disappeared from my side and I was left reminded by the thought of her lips against my own. I glanced over my shoulder and saw her having fun with the other girls. I cracked a small smile, glad at least <i>she </i>was enjoying herself. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Another hour in and my mum had gone back to her room, tired and almost out of it. Majority of the girls were drunk by now, either flirting with whoever happened to walk by or daring to try the karaoke machine with a drink in their hand. Seeing someone fall of the stage was definitely the highlight of my evening. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I wanted to leave of course, but I didn\u2019t because Brie was having way too much fun. I think she\u2019d even befriended one of the girls which was nice to see. I wanted to make sure she\u2019d get back to our room safe, so I stayed for as long as she would, busying myself with a book I\u2019d snuck along with me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was sat on a chair in the least busy part of the bar, by a coffee table with my glass of water on it, untouched, when I heard Brie yell my name. I looked up and was immediately sat on by the drunk blonde, forcing me to drop my book and catch her to sit her up straight. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Brie, what are you doing?\u201c I asked, smiling with amusement at the giggling girl. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I missed you,\u201d she admitted, resting her head in my neck. I could see she had yet another drink in her hand and the alcohol was strong on her breath. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Brie, you should maybe wrap it up for the night,\u201c I suggested, taking the glass from her hand and putting it on the coffee table. I grabbed my glass of water and said, \"Here, drink this.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She pushed it away, grinning. \u201cI don\u2019t want to! I want to tell you something.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You\u2019ll thank me in the morning, Brie, c'mon,\u201c I said, forcing her to hold it. \"You finish that glass and I\u2019ll listen to what you want to say. Fair?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She sighed. \u201cFair.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I watched as she downed the water before she set the glass on the coffee table clumsily, almost falling off my lap. She laughed as she got comfortable before laying on my chest, hugging me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So what did you want to tell me, Brie?\u201c I asked her, an amused smile on my face. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She wasn\u2019t laughing anymore, but a smile was on her lips. \"I should have asked you out.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I raised my eyebrows. \u201cHuh?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She sat up straight and looked me dead in the eyes, still smiling. \u201cWhen we first met. Our fake dating story. Of how we met. The story was that I asked you out after I moved in. I should have. I wanted to. Really wanted to, not just for this fake date.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was surprised as I asked, \u201cYou wanted to ask me out?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She rested a hand on my shoulder and nodded. \u201cI had a crush on you when we first met and I was planning on asking you out. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I was too scared because we became good friends and I didn\u2019t want to ruin it. I was stupid. I should have asked you out.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My mouth went dry as I blinked. \u201cErm\u2026 I\u2026\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Would you have said yes?\u201c she asked, not breaking our gaze. Her smile faded. \"If I had asked you. Pretend we just met and I asked you out. Would you have said yes?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I breathed out, feeling intimidated under her confident stare. \u201cI\u2013\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Brie, c'mon!\u201c Madison yelled from the stage. \"It\u2019s our turn for karaoke!\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie turned around, momentarily distracted and laughed. \u201cI\u2019m coming!\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I felt my heart racing as she turned to face me again, a smile on her lips again, as if she forgot what she asked me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I want to kiss you so bad,\u201c she admitted, leaning close. \"Ever since you kissed me the other day.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Brie, you\u2019re drunk,\u201c I said, not wanting her to do anything whilst she wasn\u2019t thinking straight. But damn, I really wanted to kiss her, too.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She moved closer, her eyes dark and unreadable. \"I know. I would never say all this sober, would I?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She leaned forward and kissed me on the cheek before jumping off my lap and running to Madison, as if nothing just happened. I released a breath I\u2019d been holding and ran a hand through my hair. Brie has feelings for me, all this time, and I\u2019d completely missed it\u2026 </p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Come on, just put this on and then you\u2019re done,\u201c I said to Brie, struggling to pull her pyjama shirt over her head. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her giggles filled the dark hotel room as she laid back on the bed, wearing her pyjama pants (which took me a long time to get her into) and her bra. She smiled up at the ceiling, though God knew what she was thinking. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Shirt then bed, Brie, c'mon,\u201d I insisted for the umpteenth time. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her eyes flickered to me, a smile still gracing her lips. She finally sat up and I pulled her shirt over her head, helping her get her arms through. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Finally,\u201c I sighed, smiling to myself. \"Now bed time. You\u2019re gonna need all the rest you can get.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Because the wedding is tomorrow!\u201c she pointed out, a grin on her lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Exactly,\u201d I agreed, leading her under the covers before getting in beside her. \u201cNow lets get some sleep.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I yawned and turned around, my back facing Brie. Truth be told, I was still surprised at what Brie told me earlier this evening. She had liked me this whole time and I guess it kind of explained a lot\u2026 Admittedly, I\u2019d liked her, too, when we first met. I mean, she was this beautiful, radiant, well-spoken woman I was about to move in with, but I couldn\u2019t exactly do anything, could I? We became friends and I guess I suppressed my feelings for so long and tried to dismiss them as pure admiration\u2026 </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Up was down and left was right at the moment, so all I could do was wait until tomorrow and see if Brie remembered. If she didn\u2019t, I\u2019d have to see if I had the guts to bring it up.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Woah, Brie, what are you doing?\u201c </p><p>I froze, lifting my arm up as I felt Brie spoon me from behind, snuggling her head into my shoulder. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She sighed out, her breath tickling my neck. \"You\u2019re comfy\u2026\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Brie\u2026\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Night, Y/N\u2026\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sighed, still a little unsure with what to do, but also revelling in how comfortable she was. Finally, exhaustion making most of the decision, I rested my hand on top of hers and closed my eyes, trying to fall asleep. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All would be revealed in the morning, I guess. </p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I ended up waking up earlier than Brie the following morning, so I escaped from her hold and jumped in the shower, feeling unsure of what the day would hold.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When I finished showering, I got into some shorts and a tee before deeming it late enough to open the curtains. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie groaned under the covers and raised her hand to block out the sun that poured into the room. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019m hungry, get up,\u201c I said, already heading to the phone to order room service. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Go downstairs and eat,\u201d she mumbled tiredly, still half asleep. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And risk looking like a loner? No thank you. Now c'mon. Get up so we can eat.\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She groaned with annoyance as I scanned the breakfast menu beside our bed. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You\u2019re so lucky the wedding is in the evening,\u201d I pointed out, not looking up. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have the worst hangover today.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She groaned again, louder this time, making me chuckle. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I think I\u2019m gonna get some boiled eggs and toast,\u201c I said aloud, before glancing to Brie. \"You want pancakes?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She didn\u2019t respond, but simply raised her thumb in the air, making me laugh again. I ordered some food to our room as Brie peeled herself out of bed and headed to the bathroom. I heard the shower running, so busied myself by making the bed and finding some painkillers to help ease Brie\u2019s head for when she came out. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Admittedly, I grew nervous of what she would say when she did come out \u2013 would she remember what she said last night? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The food arriving was the perfect distraction that I gladly accepted. I thanked the room service waiter and just on time, Brie walked out the bathroom with wet hair and wearing a bathrobe. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Medicine and water is there,\u201c I said, nodding to the dresser by the bathroom door. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thank you,\u201d she mumbled, downing the water in a few gulps along with her tablets. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Got you pancakes with syrup and some scrambled eggs,\u201c I said, taking a seat at the table. \"You doing okay?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She took a seat beside me and nodded, digging straight into the food, making me smile with amusement. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What happened last night?\u201c she finally spoke, furrowing her eyebrows. \"The last thing I remember is watching someone fall off the stage at karaoke.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I pursed my lips. \u201cYeah, after that you drank a lot. You seemed like you were having fun.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She nodded, before glancing at me with a worried look. \u201cI didn\u2019t say or do anything stupid, did I?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I paused, stuck on whether or not I should tell her what she said. I wanted to, but maybe this was a sign? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, god, what did I do?\u201c she realised, facepalming. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nothing, don\u2019t worry,\u201d I reassured. \u201cYou conked out pretty quickly when I brought you back here.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She sighed with relief and continued to eat her food. I tried to do the same, but I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off her. Had I done the right thing in not bringing it up? Because if I had, things could change between us, in a good way\u2026 isn\u2019t that what I wanted? What she wanted? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do I have something on my face?\u201c she asked, pulling me from my thoughts. \"You\u2019re staring.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She began to wipe at her mouth with a napkin adorably, making me smile. I shook my head. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re good. I was just thinking.\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She shrugged and went back to eating, too tired to argue. I found myself chewing on my lip, wondering what if\u2026</p>",

I know for sure <i>I </i>didn\u2019t organise it \u2013 wasn\u2019t there an age limit on that? My mum was in her fifties now, come on\u2026 \u2013 but somebody had. One of my mum\u2019s friend\u2019s daughters, I think. </p>[[MORE]]<p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All I knew was that Brie and I had to make an appearance, so here we were. In some stinky bar with a group of women I only knew half of and didn\u2019t care for any of them. They were the kind of people I saw at an event for my mum or something. They weren\u2019t bad people, just not my cup of tea. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Girls! You made it!\u201c Madison, my mum\u2019s friend\u2019s daughter screamed with delight, dragging Brie and I to some chairs. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Had no choice\u2026,\u201d I mumbled to which Brie nudged me and smiled at Madison. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course! It\u2019s a special night for Y/M/N,\u201c Brie said, looking to my mum, who was smiling. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I appreciate this, girls, thank you,\u201d my mum said, looking between us all. \u201cI\u2019m not as young as I used to be, so I apologise if I leave early.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Madison laughed and wrapped an arm around my mum\u2019s shoulders. \u201cWe\u2019ll start off easy, Y/M/N.\u201d Madison looked between us all with mischievous eyes. \u201cShots for everyone!\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everyone cheered, even Naomi who didn\u2019t seem as annoying as usual. Brie laughed and I forced a small smile, feeling a little out of place. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A waiter came to the table, setting down a tray of shot glasses filled with god knew what. Everybody was loud and excited and eventually drinking, and I felt uncomfortable. I was never one for drinking and bars and parties, so this wasn\u2019t fun for me like it was for everyone else. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next hour was just me watching everyone else get progressively drunker and it was quite amusing to be the only sober one. Even my mum was out of it which was definitely a sight. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"\u2026Isaac treats me well and I can\u2019t wait to be his wife,\u201c she slurred, a grin on her lips. Everybody listened intently as she continued. \"He\u2019s not too bad in bed either, ladies.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I choked on my water and everybody laughed. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This is my cue to leave and be anywhere else but here,\u201c I announced, standing up and heading to the bar, hearing their laughter from behind me. That was <i>way </i>too much information for me to deal with. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I took at a seat at the bar and asked the bartender for a sprite, which he gave me pretty quickly. I felt a presence behind me and somebody\u2019s hand on my back soon enough. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, you all good?\u201d It was Brie and she took a seat beside me, a drink in hand and a smile on her lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, just needed to get away from all of <i>that,</i>\u201c I said, nodding in my mum\u2019s direction. \"How about you? You seem to be enjoying yourself.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie nodded, sipping her drink. \u201cIt\u2019s fun, I gotta admit. I thought I\u2019d be uncomfortable at first, but it\u2019s alright. And a drink doesn\u2019t hurt, does it?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I laughed as she clinked her glass with mine. She was a little tipsy and it was definitely a sight to see. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You can go back,\u201c I said, smiling knowingly at her. \"I don\u2019t need a babysitter.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou sure?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I nodded, slurping my sprite from my straw. \u201cI\u2019m sure. I got my drink and I\u2019m not hearing about my mum\u2019s sex life. All is right with the world.\u201d She laughed and I nodded her way. \u201cGo have some fun. You deserve it after this week.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She grinned and jumped off her stool. \u201cThanks, Y/N,\u201d she said, giving me a haste kiss on the cheek which took me by surprise. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She disappeared from my side and I was left reminded by the thought of her lips against my own. I glanced over my shoulder and saw her having fun with the other girls. I cracked a small smile, glad at least <i>she </i>was enjoying herself. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Another hour in and my mum had gone back to her room, tired and almost out of it. Majority of the girls were drunk by now, either flirting with whoever happened to walk by or daring to try the karaoke machine with a drink in their hand. Seeing someone fall of the stage was definitely the highlight of my evening. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I wanted to leave of course, but I didn\u2019t because Brie was having way too much fun. I think she\u2019d even befriended one of the girls which was nice to see. I wanted to make sure she\u2019d get back to our room safe, so I stayed for as long as she would, busying myself with a book I\u2019d snuck along with me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was sat on a chair in the least busy part of the bar, by a coffee table with my glass of water on it, untouched, when I heard Brie yell my name. I looked up and was immediately sat on by the drunk blonde, forcing me to drop my book and catch her to sit her up straight. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Brie, what are you doing?\u201c I asked, smiling with amusement at the giggling girl. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I missed you,\u201d she admitted, resting her head in my neck. I could see she had yet another drink in her hand and the alcohol was strong on her breath. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Brie, you should maybe wrap it up for the night,\u201c I suggested, taking the glass from her hand and putting it on the coffee table. I grabbed my glass of water and said, \"Here, drink this.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She pushed it away, grinning. \u201cI don\u2019t want to! I want to tell you something.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You\u2019ll thank me in the morning, Brie, c'mon,\u201c I said, forcing her to hold it. \"You finish that glass and I\u2019ll listen to what you want to say. Fair?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She sighed. \u201cFair.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I watched as she downed the water before she set the glass on the coffee table clumsily, almost falling off my lap. She laughed as she got comfortable before laying on my chest, hugging me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So what did you want to tell me, Brie?\u201c I asked her, an amused smile on my face. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She wasn\u2019t laughing anymore, but a smile was on her lips. \"I should have asked you out.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I raised my eyebrows. \u201cHuh?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She sat up straight and looked me dead in the eyes, still smiling. \u201cWhen we first met. Our fake dating story. Of how we met. The story was that I asked you out after I moved in. I should have. I wanted to. Really wanted to, not just for this fake date.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was surprised as I asked, \u201cYou wanted to ask me out?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She rested a hand on my shoulder and nodded. \u201cI had a crush on you when we first met and I was planning on asking you out. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I was too scared because we became good friends and I didn\u2019t want to ruin it. I was stupid. I should have asked you out.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My mouth went dry as I blinked. \u201cErm\u2026 I\u2026\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Would you have said yes?\u201c she asked, not breaking our gaze. Her smile faded. \"If I had asked you. Pretend we just met and I asked you out. Would you have said yes?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I breathed out, feeling intimidated under her confident stare. \u201cI\u2013\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Brie, c'mon!\u201c Madison yelled from the stage. \"It\u2019s our turn for karaoke!\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie turned around, momentarily distracted and laughed. \u201cI\u2019m coming!\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I felt my heart racing as she turned to face me again, a smile on her lips again, as if she forgot what she asked me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I want to kiss you so bad,\u201c she admitted, leaning close. \"Ever since you kissed me the other day.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Brie, you\u2019re drunk,\u201c I said, not wanting her to do anything whilst she wasn\u2019t thinking straight. But damn, I really wanted to kiss her, too.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She moved closer, her eyes dark and unreadable. \"I know. I would never say all this sober, would I?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She leaned forward and kissed me on the cheek before jumping off my lap and running to Madison, as if nothing just happened. I released a breath I\u2019d been holding and ran a hand through my hair. Brie has feelings for me, all this time, and I\u2019d completely missed it\u2026 </p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Come on, just put this on and then you\u2019re done,\u201c I said to Brie, struggling to pull her pyjama shirt over her head. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her giggles filled the dark hotel room as she laid back on the bed, wearing her pyjama pants (which took me a long time to get her into) and her bra. She smiled up at the ceiling, though God knew what she was thinking. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Shirt then bed, Brie, c'mon,\u201d I insisted for the umpteenth time. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her eyes flickered to me, a smile still gracing her lips. She finally sat up and I pulled her shirt over her head, helping her get her arms through. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Finally,\u201c I sighed, smiling to myself. \"Now bed time. You\u2019re gonna need all the rest you can get.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Because the wedding is tomorrow!\u201c she pointed out, a grin on her lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Exactly,\u201d I agreed, leading her under the covers before getting in beside her. \u201cNow lets get some sleep.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I yawned and turned around, my back facing Brie. Truth be told, I was still surprised at what Brie told me earlier this evening. She had liked me this whole time and I guess it kind of explained a lot\u2026 Admittedly, I\u2019d liked her, too, when we first met. I mean, she was this beautiful, radiant, well-spoken woman I was about to move in with, but I couldn\u2019t exactly do anything, could I? We became friends and I guess I suppressed my feelings for so long and tried to dismiss them as pure admiration\u2026 </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Up was down and left was right at the moment, so all I could do was wait until tomorrow and see if Brie remembered. If she didn\u2019t, I\u2019d have to see if I had the guts to bring it up.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Woah, Brie, what are you doing?\u201c </p><p>I froze, lifting my arm up as I felt Brie spoon me from behind, snuggling her head into my shoulder. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She sighed out, her breath tickling my neck. \"You\u2019re comfy\u2026\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Brie\u2026\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Night, Y/N\u2026\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sighed, still a little unsure with what to do, but also revelling in how comfortable she was. Finally, exhaustion making most of the decision, I rested my hand on top of hers and closed my eyes, trying to fall asleep. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All would be revealed in the morning, I guess. </p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I ended up waking up earlier than Brie the following morning, so I escaped from her hold and jumped in the shower, feeling unsure of what the day would hold.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When I finished showering, I got into some shorts and a tee before deeming it late enough to open the curtains. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie groaned under the covers and raised her hand to block out the sun that poured into the room. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019m hungry, get up,\u201c I said, already heading to the phone to order room service. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Go downstairs and eat,\u201d she mumbled tiredly, still half asleep. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And risk looking like a loner? No thank you. Now c'mon. Get up so we can eat.\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She groaned with annoyance as I scanned the breakfast menu beside our bed. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You\u2019re so lucky the wedding is in the evening,\u201d I pointed out, not looking up. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have the worst hangover today.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She groaned again, louder this time, making me chuckle. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I think I\u2019m gonna get some boiled eggs and toast,\u201c I said aloud, before glancing to Brie. \"You want pancakes?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She didn\u2019t respond, but simply raised her thumb in the air, making me laugh again. I ordered some food to our room as Brie peeled herself out of bed and headed to the bathroom. I heard the shower running, so busied myself by making the bed and finding some painkillers to help ease Brie\u2019s head for when she came out. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Admittedly, I grew nervous of what she would say when she did come out \u2013 would she remember what she said last night? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The food arriving was the perfect distraction that I gladly accepted. I thanked the room service waiter and just on time, Brie walked out the bathroom with wet hair and wearing a bathrobe. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Medicine and water is there,\u201c I said, nodding to the dresser by the bathroom door. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thank you,\u201d she mumbled, downing the water in a few gulps along with her tablets. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Got you pancakes with syrup and some scrambled eggs,\u201c I said, taking a seat at the table. \"You doing okay?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She took a seat beside me and nodded, digging straight into the food, making me smile with amusement. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What happened last night?\u201c she finally spoke, furrowing her eyebrows. \"The last thing I remember is watching someone fall off the stage at karaoke.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I pursed my lips. \u201cYeah, after that you drank a lot. You seemed like you were having fun.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She nodded, before glancing at me with a worried look. \u201cI didn\u2019t say or do anything stupid, did I?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I paused, stuck on whether or not I should tell her what she said. I wanted to, but maybe this was a sign? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, god, what did I do?\u201c she realised, facepalming. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nothing, don\u2019t worry,\u201d I reassured. \u201cYou conked out pretty quickly when I brought you back here.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She sighed with relief and continued to eat her food. I tried to do the same, but I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off her. Had I done the right thing in not bringing it up? Because if I had, things could change between us, in a good way\u2026 isn\u2019t that what I wanted? What she wanted? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do I have something on my face?\u201c she asked, pulling me from my thoughts. \"You\u2019re staring.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She began to wipe at her mouth with a napkin adorably, making me smile. I shook my head. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re good. I was just thinking.\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She shrugged and went back to eating, too tired to argue. I found myself chewing on my lip, wondering what if\u2026</p>",

I know for sure <i>I </i>didn&rsquo;t organise it &ndash; wasn&rsquo;t there an age limit on that? My mum was in her fifties now, come on&hellip; &ndash; but somebody had. One of my mum&rsquo;s friend&rsquo;s daughters, I think. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All I knew was that Brie and I had to make an appearance, so here we were. In some stinky bar with a group of women I only knew half of and didn&rsquo;t care for any of them. They were the kind of people I saw at an event for my mum or something. They weren&rsquo;t bad people, just not my cup of tea. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Girls! You made it!&ldquo; Madison, my mum&rsquo;s friend&rsquo;s daughter screamed with delight, dragging Brie and I to some chairs. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Had no choice&hellip;,&rdquo; I mumbled to which Brie nudged me and smiled at Madison. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Of course! It&rsquo;s a special night for Y/M/N,&ldquo; Brie said, looking to my mum, who was smiling. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I appreciate this, girls, thank you,&rdquo; my mum said, looking between us all. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not as young as I used to be, so I apologise if I leave early.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Madison laughed and wrapped an arm around my mum&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll start off easy, Y/M/N.&rdquo; Madison looked between us all with mischievous eyes. &ldquo;Shots for everyone!&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Everyone cheered, even Naomi who didn&rsquo;t seem as annoying as usual. Brie laughed and I forced a small smile, feeling a little out of place. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A waiter came to the table, setting down a tray of shot glasses filled with god knew what. Everybody was loud and excited and eventually drinking, and I felt uncomfortable. I was never one for drinking and bars and parties, so this wasn&rsquo;t fun for me like it was for everyone else. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The next hour was just me watching everyone else get progressively drunker and it was quite amusing to be the only sober one. Even my mum was out of it which was definitely a sight. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"&hellip;Isaac treats me well and I can&rsquo;t wait to be his wife,&ldquo; she slurred, a grin on her lips. Everybody listened intently as she continued. \"He&rsquo;s not too bad in bed either, ladies.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I choked on my water and everybody laughed. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"This is my cue to leave and be anywhere else but here,&ldquo; I announced, standing up and heading to the bar, hearing their laughter from behind me. That was <i>way </i>too much information for me to deal with. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I took at a seat at the bar and asked the bartender for a sprite, which he gave me pretty quickly. I felt a presence behind me and somebody&rsquo;s hand on my back soon enough. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Hey, you all good?&rdquo; It was Brie and she took a seat beside me, a drink in hand and a smile on her lips. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Yeah, just needed to get away from all of <i>that,</i>&ldquo; I said, nodding in my mum&rsquo;s direction. \"How about you? You seem to be enjoying yourself.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brie nodded, sipping her drink. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fun, I gotta admit. I thought I&rsquo;d be uncomfortable at first, but it&rsquo;s alright. And a drink doesn&rsquo;t hurt, does it?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I laughed as she clinked her glass with mine. She was a little tipsy and it was definitely a sight to see. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You can go back,&ldquo; I said, smiling knowingly at her. \"I don&rsquo;t need a babysitter.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;You sure?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I nodded, slurping my sprite from my straw. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure. I got my drink and I&rsquo;m not hearing about my mum&rsquo;s sex life. All is right with the world.&rdquo; She laughed and I nodded her way. &ldquo;Go have some fun. You deserve it after this week.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She grinned and jumped off her stool. &ldquo;Thanks, Y/N,&rdquo; she said, giving me a haste kiss on the cheek which took me by surprise. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She disappeared from my side and I was left reminded by the thought of her lips against my own. I glanced over my shoulder and saw her having fun with the other girls. I cracked a small smile, glad at least <i>she </i>was enjoying herself. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another hour in and my mum had gone back to her room, tired and almost out of it. Majority of the girls were drunk by now, either flirting with whoever happened to walk by or daring to try the karaoke machine with a drink in their hand. Seeing someone fall of the stage was definitely the highlight of my evening. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wanted to leave of course, but I didn&rsquo;t because Brie was having way too much fun. I think she&rsquo;d even befriended one of the girls which was nice to see. I wanted to make sure she&rsquo;d get back to our room safe, so I stayed for as long as she would, busying myself with a book I&rsquo;d snuck along with me. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was sat on a chair in the least busy part of the bar, by a coffee table with my glass of water on it, untouched, when I heard Brie yell my name. I looked up and was immediately sat on by the drunk blonde, forcing me to drop my book and catch her to sit her up straight. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Brie, what are you doing?&ldquo; I asked, smiling with amusement at the giggling girl. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I missed you,&rdquo; she admitted, resting her head in my neck. I could see she had yet another drink in her hand and the alcohol was strong on her breath. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Brie, you should maybe wrap it up for the night,&ldquo; I suggested, taking the glass from her hand and putting it on the coffee table. I grabbed my glass of water and said, \"Here, drink this.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She pushed it away, grinning. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to! I want to tell you something.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You&rsquo;ll thank me in the morning, Brie, c'mon,&ldquo; I said, forcing her to hold it. \"You finish that glass and I&rsquo;ll listen to what you want to say. Fair?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She sighed. &ldquo;Fair.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I watched as she downed the water before she set the glass on the coffee table clumsily, almost falling off my lap. She laughed as she got comfortable before laying on my chest, hugging me. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"So what did you want to tell me, Brie?&ldquo; I asked her, an amused smile on my face. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She wasn&rsquo;t laughing anymore, but a smile was on her lips. \"I should have asked you out.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I raised my eyebrows. &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She sat up straight and looked me dead in the eyes, still smiling. &ldquo;When we first met. Our fake dating story. Of how we met. The story was that I asked you out after I moved in. I should have. I wanted to. Really wanted to, not just for this fake date.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was surprised as I asked, &ldquo;You wanted to ask me out?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She rested a hand on my shoulder and nodded. &ldquo;I had a crush on you when we first met and I was planning on asking you out. I just couldn&rsquo;t do it. I was too scared because we became good friends and I didn&rsquo;t want to ruin it. I was stupid. I should have asked you out.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My mouth went dry as I blinked. &ldquo;Erm&hellip; I&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Would you have said yes?&ldquo; she asked, not breaking our gaze. Her smile faded. \"If I had asked you. Pretend we just met and I asked you out. Would you have said yes?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I breathed out, feeling intimidated under her confident stare. &ldquo;I&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Brie, c'mon!&ldquo; Madison yelled from the stage. \"It&rsquo;s our turn for karaoke!&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brie turned around, momentarily distracted and laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming!&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I felt my heart racing as she turned to face me again, a smile on her lips again, as if she forgot what she asked me. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I want to kiss you so bad,&ldquo; she admitted, leaning close. \"Ever since you kissed me the other day.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Brie, you&rsquo;re drunk,&ldquo; I said, not wanting her to do anything whilst she wasn&rsquo;t thinking straight. But damn, I really wanted to kiss her, too.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She moved closer, her eyes dark and unreadable. \"I know. I would never say all this sober, would I?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She leaned forward and kissed me on the cheek before jumping off my lap and running to Madison, as if nothing just happened. I released a breath I&rsquo;d been holding and ran a hand through my hair. Brie has feelings for me, all this time, and I&rsquo;d completely missed it&hellip; </p><p>***</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Come on, just put this on and then you&rsquo;re done,&ldquo; I said to Brie, struggling to pull her pyjama shirt over her head. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her giggles filled the dark hotel room as she laid back on the bed, wearing her pyjama pants (which took me a long time to get her into) and her bra. She smiled up at the ceiling, though God knew what she was thinking. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Shirt then bed, Brie, c'mon,&rdquo; I insisted for the umpteenth time. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her eyes flickered to me, a smile still gracing her lips. She finally sat up and I pulled her shirt over her head, helping her get her arms through. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Finally,&ldquo; I sighed, smiling to myself. \"Now bed time. You&rsquo;re gonna need all the rest you can get.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Because the wedding is tomorrow!&ldquo; she pointed out, a grin on her lips. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Exactly,&rdquo; I agreed, leading her under the covers before getting in beside her. &ldquo;Now lets get some sleep.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I yawned and turned around, my back facing Brie. Truth be told, I was still surprised at what Brie told me earlier this evening. She had liked me this whole time and I guess it kind of explained a lot&hellip; Admittedly, I&rsquo;d liked her, too, when we first met. I mean, she was this beautiful, radiant, well-spoken woman I was about to move in with, but I couldn&rsquo;t exactly do anything, could I? We became friends and I guess I suppressed my feelings for so long and tried to dismiss them as pure admiration&hellip; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Up was down and left was right at the moment, so all I could do was wait until tomorrow and see if Brie remembered. If she didn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;d have to see if I had the guts to bring it up.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Woah, Brie, what are you doing?&ldquo; </p><p>I froze, lifting my arm up as I felt Brie spoon me from behind, snuggling her head into my shoulder. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She sighed out, her breath tickling my neck. \"You&rsquo;re comfy&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Brie&hellip;&ldquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Night, Y/N&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I sighed, still a little unsure with what to do, but also revelling in how comfortable she was. Finally, exhaustion making most of the decision, I rested my hand on top of hers and closed my eyes, trying to fall asleep. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All would be revealed in the morning, I guess. </p><p>***</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I ended up waking up earlier than Brie the following morning, so I escaped from her hold and jumped in the shower, feeling unsure of what the day would hold.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I finished showering, I got into some shorts and a tee before deeming it late enough to open the curtains. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brie groaned under the covers and raised her hand to block out the sun that poured into the room. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I&rsquo;m hungry, get up,&ldquo; I said, already heading to the phone to order room service. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Go downstairs and eat,&rdquo; she mumbled tiredly, still half asleep. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"And risk looking like a loner? No thank you. Now c'mon. Get up so we can eat.&ldquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She groaned with annoyance as I scanned the breakfast menu beside our bed. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You&rsquo;re so lucky the wedding is in the evening,&rdquo; I pointed out, not looking up. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna have the worst hangover today.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She groaned again, louder this time, making me chuckle. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I think I&rsquo;m gonna get some boiled eggs and toast,&ldquo; I said aloud, before glancing to Brie. \"You want pancakes?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She didn&rsquo;t respond, but simply raised her thumb in the air, making me laugh again. I ordered some food to our room as Brie peeled herself out of bed and headed to the bathroom.

I shook my head. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re good.
