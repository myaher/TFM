But it didn\u2019t matter, even now at this moment, as you were walking back to your apartment, people were giving you stares and they were whispering. Not that it wasn\u2019t a normal thing for people to look at you. You were an idol so you usually got a lot of attention every time you went out. That was why most of the time you stayed indoors or if you decided to leave the safety of your own house you always made sure there was someone who would accompany you. It could be one of your band members or a bodyguard. Sometimes you would ask your manager if he had some free time to tag along with you. He didn\u2019t like it if you would leave without any supervision.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Anything could happen and if you were closed in by a big group of people, there was a chance you wouldn\u2019t be able to handle them on your own. Yet, even though you were used to it this amount of attention was different and you knew it. That was why you couldn\u2019t seem to get home fast enough. You wanted to get away from these people who glanced at you all the time as you walked past them, looking as if they wanted to scream at you or throw their hats at your head. You wanted to lock yourself in your apartment where you knew you were safe and where you knew that no one would judge you or make things up about you. Where you\u2019d be alone and in peace. There was no way you could deny that you loved your job.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>You were a performer, the lead vocalist of your band and you were popular. You lived for music, it was your biggest love and passion. In most cases you loved your fans, but at this moment you felt a little betrayed.\u00a0Every day and night you gave them your all as you wrote lyrics for them, to created your music and to meet them all over the world and then they\u2019d make up lies about you. All the gossips and fake information that was spread all over social media and the internet. A few months ago the first scandal popped up, yet that one had been different. You hadn\u2019t really minded about it, hadn\u2019t had the right to feel bad about it because it had all been true. You had known that you wouldn\u2019t have been able to hide it forever. It had been the scandal involving you and Kim Taehyung of BTS, pronouncing that the two of you were dating.\u00a0</p><p>You had been caught on a date together and they had spotted you on the airport wearing the same bracelet and the same sweater. Both of them you had gotten from them and back then you had been innocent enough to think it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal if you\u2019d actually wear them. You\u2019d thought that there was no way people would be able to link the two of you together. Especially not since you would never wear it on the same day and the sweater looked like a very normal black pullover. There were thousands of people who wore those things. But the two of you being seen together, out and spending your free time together. You hadn\u2019t been able to work your way around that one. Eventually you had both given in and your companies had also confirmed that the two of you were dating.\u00a0</p><p>Yet, they both supported you and thought that your private relationships were your own doing. In the beginning fans had been furious, since you were both really popular in Korea.\u00a0But after some time they had accepted it and they had moved on. Still, even today there were some of them who would try to find ways to break you and Taehyung apart, and this was surely one of them.\u00a0In your pocket your phone beeped so you quickly grabbed it to check who it was. surprisingly enough it was your mother, who lived a whole end away from you. At the other side of the country to be precise, which caused that the two of you barely got the chance to see each other. These were one of those moments you missed her like crazy. You were craving for one of her hugs. You quickly opened the message and bit your lip when you read it. \u2018Baby, what\u2019s going on there? Did you and Tae broke up?\u2019 She asked and you hated it that you had to explain this once again, you had been explaining all day long.\u00a0</p><p>It was the only thing you\u2019d been doing since the moment you had woken up this morning. Your mother had always loved your boyfriend and she was very supportive of your relationship with him. She was proud that he was so talented and good looking and already looking forward to having your grandchildren. She could be a little bit fast passed sometimes. \u2018No, we\u2019re still together.\u2019 You typed as a reply and hoped that she wouldn\u2019t ask any further questions, but since she was your mother and she worried about you, she did. \u2018Then what\u2019s is all of this about?\u2019 She asked and you had always known that your mother was cool enough to check about you on the internet and about everything that was going on. She liked staying up to date with your career and everything involving your life. Yes, you had been caught up in another scandal. But unlike the last one, this one surely wasn\u2019t true.\u00a0</p><p>It was all over the internet, saying that you were cheating on Taehyung with some other guy. All lies, one of those that made you feel sick. The thing was that you would never cheat on anyone, knowing that going through something like that was one of the worst things that could happen to a person. You hadn\u2019t forgotten the way you had felt when your ex had betrayed you with someone else. You would never do that to anyone. Besides all of that you still loved your boyfriend to death, there was no one else you had eyes for but him. But someone had found a picture from you and a boy hugging each other in the middle of the mall and then a few pics of you getting coffee together. Did you know the guy? Yes, of course you did. You still hadn\u2019t passed the irrational point where you would go hugging strangers in the middle of the streets.\u00a0</p><p>But were you cheating on Taehyung with him? God no. The pictures didn\u2019t even indicate those things. They didn\u2019t tell anything, just two people meeting each other. But you knew how people could be, judging you with the first thoughts that popped up inside of their heads. In the end he was just an old friend from high school you had run into while you were shopping and since you hadn\u2019t wanted to be rude you had said yes when he had offered you to get some coffee. The only thing you had been trying to do was being nice to someone and now you had all of this going on. You were so sick and tired of your every single move being tracked and analyzed. You couldn\u2019t look at anyone, smile at a person, talk to someone, without others thinking you were madly in love with them and they had made you pregnant.\u00a0</p><p>Maybe it would be best if you\u2019d just lock yourself up in your house and make sure you had no contact with anyone but your boyfriend and your members, but even then they\u2019d be able to make something up.\u00a0There was always something, there was no way escaping it. It was upsetting that everyone seemed to be thinking you were capable of breaking someone\u2019s heart like that and you could possibly be such a terrible girlfriend. Your members said you just had to wait for it to blow over and that it would be forgotten soon enough, surely after you and Taehyung were spotted together in public once again. So that they could all see everything was fine and the rumors were fake. But you hated the fact that people had accused you from this in the first place. Did you look like a cheater to others? Upset and hurt by the situation you walked even faster and finally your apartment block popped up into view.\u00a0</p><p>Just a few more steps, you were almost there and then this nightmare would be over for today. Once you\u2019d be inside you wouldn\u2019t put a single step out of the door tonight. Your plan was to simply curl up on the couch, drowning in anger and self pity. Suddenly your plans were boycotted as two girls stopped in front of you and blocked your way, making you hold in your steps and look up. You were wearing a mask and your hear was falling over your face, still you knew it wouldn\u2019t help you to go somewhere unnoticed, people would always attempt to recognize you.\u00a0They both seemed to be around your age, one slightly taller than the other. But the expressions on their faces told you all you had to know. They weren\u2019t here to ask for a picture on an autograph. And if if they had, you weren\u2019t in the mood to give them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy did you cheat on Taehyung-oppa?\u201d One of them asked, the venom and hatred dripping for her voice as she spoke. It actually felt as if someone was slapping you straight in the face. You couldn\u2019t keep the pained look off your face as you stared at her. Just like everyone else she believed the rumors, and who were you to judge her for it? She was one of the many. But god did it hurt you when others didn\u2019t pick your side in these kind of situations. Where were your fans? The ones who had your back no matter what? The ones who knew you well enough to be sure that you would never do such thing? By now your managers had told you how to deal with these types of girls, the ones who weren\u2019t afraid to make contact with you on the streets. There were always a few different types of fans.\u00a0</p><p>The ones who respected your privacy and left you alone, those who would follow you but who wouldn\u2019t speak to you and those who would just straight out come forward and would point out what they wanted. You bowed your head slightly and then wanted to walk past them, hoping that this way you\u2019d be able to end this confrontation. But one of them grabbed your arm and pulled you back, making it impossible for you to continue your way. Your eyes widened as you finally looked them in the eye and your glances locked. They didn\u2019t just look angry, but furious and murderous. \u201cWhy did you do it? Isn\u2019t he good enough for you?\u201d She asked as if you were someone who had betrayed them and had scattered their hearts into thousands of pieces.\u00a0</p><p>You could hear the threatening tone inside of her voice, which made your muscles tense, prepared for whatever reaction you had to come forward with. You had never been attacked by fans before, but you had heard about it that there other stars who had.\u00a0You weren\u2019t afraid to stand up for yourself if you had to, but you surely didn\u2019t want to make a seen either. The last thing you needed at this point was to sent any more attention your way. You were trying to stay out of the media, not to make things even more complicated. \u201cI did\u2019t cheat on him, I never would. Now please let me go.\u201d Trying not to make it sound as if you were scared of them. You gave your arm a soft pull, hoping they would get the message and they would let this slide. They looked at each other as if they had no idea what to do with your words, discussing this without anything being said.\u00a0</p><p>To your surprise she let go of your arm and you were finally able walk away. it was only then that you noticed your heart had been stammering inside of your chest, prepared for what could have happened. You had no idea if they believed you or if they\u2019d believe the pictures, but you knew the truth and that was the most important thing. As fast as you could without making a fool out of yourself and making it seem as if you were running you walked towards your apartment. You let out a relieved sigh as you saw your door come in sight. Finally, you were home, you had survived your way back and now you just wanted this horrible day to end. You had heard enough lies for today and you were tired of people accusing you of something you hadn\u2019t done, you were sick of people doubting your loyalty and love for Teahyung.\u00a0</p><p>Grabbed your keys out of your bag, you opened the door, taking in the smell that reeked like home. It caused a sudden feeling of safety to settle down on top of you and for the first time today the tension inside of your shoulders disappeared. For the first time in hours you were able to catch your breath without having the feeling that everyone was staring at you. You kicked off your shoes and threw your stuff down on top the table, too tired to clean up your mess. It had been a long and exhausting day which had never seemed to end, but here you were, you had made it. While taking off your jacket your eyes glued onto the boy that was sitting on your couch, his laptop on his lap and a deep frown on his forehead. He hadn\u2019t greeted you when you had come in and panic started to overflow you.\u00a0</p><p>He surely must have heard about what had happened by now. This entire situation involved him as much as it did you. People were talking about his girlfriend, and not in a very good way. What if he believed the rumors as well, what if he thought you really cheated on him? \u201cTaehyung?\u201d You said in a high pitched voice and walked over to him, stopping a few steps in front of him so you could study his expression. His eyebrows rose as he heard your voice and he looked up from his screen so his eyes met yours. Relief washed over you when he shot you that adorable smile of his and put his laptop to the side before he patted his lap, motioning for you to sit down.\u00a0You let go of the breath you didn\u2019t know you\u2019d been holding.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey babe, I didn\u2019t hear you come in.\u201d He said as an apology of not greeting you. Slightly dazed you took place on his soft legs. All the recent events were still swirling around in your head, causing your reactions to be slow. He hummed in content as he felt your weight sink down on top of his legs and wrapped his arms around you middle. He nuzzled his nose into your hair and you could barely handle it that he pretended as if nothing was wrong. You had no idea how to react to his lovingly gestures and suddenly you started doubting if he even knew about your scandal at all. Yet, all his members used twitter, they had an account on Instagram and they had access to mobile data and wifi. It wasn\u2019t possible for him not to know.\u00a0</p><p>For a moment it remained silent inside of the apartment as you just sat there with him hugging you. You kept on going over things in your head, wondering about how you should bring up the topic. Actually you were so done talking about it today, but if there was one person you had to discuss this with than it was him. \u201cDid you hear?\u201d You asked eventually and couldn\u2019t even look at his face when he brought it to your level and stared at you. \u201cI did.\u201d He stated in a low voice and you were afraid you had just made him angry, that you had reminded him of it. \u201cBut\u00a0I also know it\u2019s not true.\u201d He quickly added and your eyes drew to his, your body relaxing visibly. He knew you would never do such a thing, Taehyung trusted you. He smiled when he saw your relieved expression and brushed your hair out of your face, linking it behind your ear.</p><p>\u201cOh come on, I\u2019ve dated you long enough to know that there\u2019s one thing you\u2019d never do. And I know that if you wouldn\u2019t want me anymore that you\u2019d just dump me and be honest about it instead of sneaking around behind my back with someone else. That\u2019s not your style.\u201d He said and pecked your nose, trying to get the look of disbelieve off your face that you were giving him right now. Was he seriously joking about this right now? You\u2019d thought that you would be angry because he seemed so careless about all of this. But to be honest, it was very refreshing to hear someone talking about it in such a way. He was bringing to words what you had wanted to scream from the rooftops all day long. You had always thought that Taehyung knew you better than you knew yourself, but this was indescribable.\u00a0</p><p>Did he not even doubt you when people confronted him with this in the morning? \u201cThat\u2019s true, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever not want you anymore so I guess you shouldn\u2019t wait for that.\u201d You said as you combed your fingers through his, he contently leaned into your touch. \u201cGood.\u201d He muttered as an answer before taking your head in his hands and pressing his lips on yours.\u00a0The kiss started off sweet and lovingly, like all of his kisses were. Innocent and breathtaking. But soon his mouth turned more hungry and rougher against yours, and the change in his ways made you gasp slightly. He pulled you up from the couch and stumbled backwards with you for a little, making you look like two lost penguins. Yet, he didn\u2019t break the kiss even once.</p><p>Then he placed his hands under your butt and as you got the hint you wrapped your arms around his neck before jumping up and placing your legs around his waist. His teeth bit down on your bottom lip gently which caused you to moan softly, giving him the opportunity to slip his tongue into your mouth. He explored your mouth for a few seconds and you felt your back hit the wall as he held you in place, his hands slipping up and down your body as you held onto him. Then his lips left yours and they began to trail down, leaving open mouth kisses as he went down your jaw and reached your neck. You tangled your hands in his hair as you felt him sucking on your sweat spot and holding your hips, pressing you against him.\u00a0\u201cW-what are you doing?\u201d You knew how breathless you sounded, but you couldn\u2019t help it.\u00a0</p><p>Taehyung chuckled against your skin which made a shiver run down your spine and he bit down once more, making you tilt your head even further. \u201cI want everyone to see that you\u2019re mine, so I guess I should mark you.\u201d He said and then his head came up and he looked you in the eye. \u201cYou are mine ____________, I\u2019ll simply making sure you don\u2019t forget.\u201d He said as he leaned his forehead against yours and breathed heavily, a blush covering his cheeks. He was still holding you up and gently placed his hands underneath your thighs, making sure you wouldn\u2019t slip away. \u201cI would never forget.\u201d You whispered and his dark eyes locked with yours, so you could no longer look away. \u201cI love you Tae.\u201d You confessed and he smiled at you, pecking your lips before putting you down and pulling you in for a tight hug. \u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://yourdreamscenarios.tumblr.com/post/177692218575/bts-masterlist\">BTS Masterlist</a></p>",

There was no way you could deny that you loved your job.\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>You were a performer, the lead vocalist of your band and you were popular. You lived for music, it was your biggest love and passion. In most cases you loved your fans, but at this moment you felt a little betrayed.\u00a0Every day and night you gave them your all as you wrote lyrics for them, to created your music and to meet them all over the world and then they\u2019d make up lies about you. All the gossips and fake information that was spread all over social media and the internet. A few months ago the first scandal popped up, yet that one had been different. You hadn\u2019t really minded about it, hadn\u2019t had the right to feel bad about it because it had all been true. You had known that you wouldn\u2019t have been able to hide it forever. It had been the scandal involving you and Kim Taehyung of BTS, pronouncing that the two of you were dating.\u00a0</p><p>You had been caught on a date together and they had spotted you on the airport wearing the same bracelet and the same sweater. Both of them you had gotten from them and back then you had been innocent enough to think it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal if you\u2019d actually wear them. You\u2019d thought that there was no way people would be able to link the two of you together. Especially not since you would never wear it on the same day and the sweater looked like a very normal black pullover. There were thousands of people who wore those things. But the two of you being seen together, out and spending your free time together. You hadn\u2019t been able to work your way around that one. Eventually you had both given in and your companies had also confirmed that the two of you were dating.\u00a0</p><p>Yet, they both supported you and thought that your private relationships were your own doing. In the beginning fans had been furious, since you were both really popular in Korea.\u00a0But after some time they had accepted it and they had moved on. Still, even today there were some of them who would try to find ways to break you and Taehyung apart, and this was surely one of them.\u00a0In your pocket your phone beeped so you quickly grabbed it to check who it was. surprisingly enough it was your mother, who lived a whole end away from you. At the other side of the country to be precise, which caused that the two of you barely got the chance to see each other. These were one of those moments you missed her like crazy. You were craving for one of her hugs. You quickly opened the message and bit your lip when you read it. \u2018Baby, what\u2019s going on there?

What if he believed the rumors as well, what if he thought you really cheated on him? \u201cTaehyung?\u201d You said in a high pitched voice and walked over to him, stopping a few steps in front of him so you could study his expression. His eyebrows rose as he heard your voice and he looked up from his screen so his eyes met yours. Relief washed over you when he shot you that adorable smile of his and put his laptop to the side before he patted his lap, motioning for you to sit down.\u00a0You let go of the breath you didn\u2019t know you\u2019d been holding.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey babe, I didn\u2019t hear you come in.\u201d He said as an apology of not greeting you. Slightly dazed you took place on his soft legs. All the recent events were still swirling around in your head, causing your reactions to be slow. He hummed in content as he felt your weight sink down on top of his legs and wrapped his arms around you middle. He nuzzled his nose into your hair and you could barely handle it that he pretended as if nothing was wrong. You had no idea how to react to his lovingly gestures and suddenly you started doubting if he even knew about your scandal at all. Yet, all his members used twitter, they had an account on Instagram and they had access to mobile data and wifi. It wasn\u2019t possible for him not to know.\u00a0</p><p>For a moment it remained silent inside of the apartment as you just sat there with him hugging you. You kept on going over things in your head, wondering about how you should bring up the topic. Actually you were so done talking about it today, but if there was one person you had to discuss this with than it was him. \u201cDid you hear?\u201d You asked eventually and couldn\u2019t even look at his face when he brought it to your level and stared at you. \u201cI did.\u201d He stated in a low voice and you were afraid you had just made him angry, that you had reminded him of it. \u201cBut\u00a0I also know it\u2019s not true.\u201d He quickly added and your eyes drew to his, your body relaxing visibly. He knew you would never do such a thing, Taehyung trusted you. He smiled when he saw your relieved expression and brushed your hair out of your face, linking it behind your ear.</p><p>\u201cOh come on, I\u2019ve dated you long enough to know that there\u2019s one thing you\u2019d never do. And I know that if you wouldn\u2019t want me anymore that you\u2019d just dump me and be honest about it instead of sneaking around behind my back with someone else. That\u2019s not your style.\u201d He said and pecked your nose, trying to get the look of disbelieve off your face that you were giving him right now. Was he seriously joking about this right now? You\u2019d thought that you would be angry because he seemed so careless about all of this. But to be honest, it was very refreshing to hear someone talking about it in such a way. He was bringing to words what you had wanted to scream from the rooftops all day long. You had always thought that Taehyung knew you better than you knew yourself, but this was indescribable.\u00a0</p><p>Did he not even doubt you when people confronted him with this in the morning? \u201cThat\u2019s true, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever not want you anymore so I guess you shouldn\u2019t wait for that.\u201d You said as you combed your fingers through his, he contently leaned into your touch. \u201cGood.\u201d He muttered as an answer before taking your head in his hands and pressing his lips on yours.\u00a0The kiss started off sweet and lovingly, like all of his kisses were. Innocent and breathtaking. But soon his mouth turned more hungry and rougher against yours, and the change in his ways made you gasp slightly. He pulled you up from the couch and stumbled backwards with you for a little, making you look like two lost penguins. Yet, he didn\u2019t break the kiss even once.</p><p>Then he placed his hands under your butt and as you got the hint you wrapped your arms around his neck before jumping up and placing your legs around his waist. His teeth bit down on your bottom lip gently which caused you to moan softly, giving him the opportunity to slip his tongue into your mouth. He explored your mouth for a few seconds and you felt your back hit the wall as he held you in place, his hands slipping up and down your body as you held onto him. Then his lips left yours and they began to trail down, leaving open mouth kisses as he went down your jaw and reached your neck. You tangled your hands in his hair as you felt him sucking on your sweat spot and holding your hips, pressing you against him.\u00a0\u201cW-what are you doing?\u201d You knew how breathless you sounded, but you couldn\u2019t help it.\u00a0</p><p>Taehyung chuckled against your skin which made a shiver run down your spine and he bit down once more, making you tilt your head even further. \u201cI want everyone to see that you\u2019re mine, so I guess I should mark you.\u201d He said and then his head came up and he looked you in the eye. \u201cYou are mine ____________, I\u2019ll simply making sure you don\u2019t forget.\u201d He said as he leaned his forehead against yours and breathed heavily, a blush covering his cheeks. He was still holding you up and gently placed his hands underneath your thighs, making sure you wouldn\u2019t slip away. \u201cI would never forget.\u201d You whispered and his dark eyes locked with yours, so you could no longer look away. \u201cI love you Tae.\u201d You confessed and he smiled at you, pecking your lips before putting you down and pulling you in for a tight hug. \u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://yourdreamscenarios.tumblr.com/post/177692218575/bts-masterlist\">BTS Masterlist</a></p>",

But it didn\u2019t matter, even now at this moment, as you were walking back to your apartment, people were giving you stares and they were whispering. Not that it wasn\u2019t a normal thing for people to look at you. You were an idol so you usually got a lot of attention every time you went out. That was why most of the time you stayed indoors or if you decided to leave the safety of your own house you always made sure there was someone who would accompany you. It could be one of your band members or a bodyguard. Sometimes you would ask your manager if he had some free time to tag along with you. He didn\u2019t like it if you would leave without any supervision.\u00a0<br></p><p>Anything could happen and if you were closed in by a big group of people, there was a chance you wouldn\u2019t be able to handle them on your own. Yet, even though you were used to it this amount of attention was different and you knew it. That was why you couldn\u2019t seem to get home fast enough. You wanted to get away from these people who glanced at you all the time as you walked past them, looking as if they wanted to scream at you or throw their hats at your head. You wanted to lock yourself in your apartment where you knew you were safe and where you knew that no one would judge you or make things up about you. Where you\u2019d be alone and in peace. There was no way you could deny that you loved your job.\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>You were a performer, the lead vocalist of your band and you were popular. You lived for music, it was your biggest love and passion. In most cases you loved your fans, but at this moment you felt a little betrayed.\u00a0Every day and night you gave them your all as you wrote lyrics for them, to created your music and to meet them all over the world and then they\u2019d make up lies about you. All the gossips and fake information that was spread all over social media and the internet. A few months ago the first scandal popped up, yet that one had been different. You hadn\u2019t really minded about it, hadn\u2019t had the right to feel bad about it because it had all been true. You had known that you wouldn\u2019t have been able to hide it forever. It had been the scandal involving you and Kim Taehyung of BTS, pronouncing that the two of you were dating.\u00a0</p><p>You had been caught on a date together and they had spotted you on the airport wearing the same bracelet and the same sweater. Both of them you had gotten from them and back then you had been innocent enough to think it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal if you\u2019d actually wear them. You\u2019d thought that there was no way people would be able to link the two of you together. Especially not since you would never wear it on the same day and the sweater looked like a very normal black pullover. There were thousands of people who wore those things. But the two of you being seen together, out and spending your free time together. You hadn\u2019t been able to work your way around that one. Eventually you had both given in and your companies had also confirmed that the two of you were dating.\u00a0</p><p>Yet, they both supported you and thought that your private relationships were your own doing. In the beginning fans had been furious, since you were both really popular in Korea.\u00a0But after some time they had accepted it and they had moved on. Still, even today there were some of them who would try to find ways to break you and Taehyung apart, and this was surely one of them.\u00a0In your pocket your phone beeped so you quickly grabbed it to check who it was. surprisingly enough it was your mother, who lived a whole end away from you. At the other side of the country to be precise, which caused that the two of you barely got the chance to see each other. These were one of those moments you missed her like crazy. You were craving for one of her hugs. You quickly opened the message and bit your lip when you read it. \u2018Baby, what\u2019s going on there? Did you and Tae broke up?\u2019 She asked and you hated it that you had to explain this once again, you had been explaining all day long.\u00a0</p><p>It was the only thing you\u2019d been doing since the moment you had woken up this morning. Your mother had always loved your boyfriend and she was very supportive of your relationship with him. She was proud that he was so talented and good looking and already looking forward to having your grandchildren. She could be a little bit fast passed sometimes. \u2018No, we\u2019re still together.\u2019 You typed as a reply and hoped that she wouldn\u2019t ask any further questions, but since she was your mother and she worried about you, she did. \u2018Then what\u2019s is all of this about?\u2019 She asked and you had always known that your mother was cool enough to check about you on the internet and about everything that was going on. She liked staying up to date with your career and everything involving your life. Yes, you had been caught up in another scandal. But unlike the last one, this one surely wasn\u2019t true.\u00a0</p><p>It was all over the internet, saying that you were cheating on Taehyung with some other guy. All lies, one of those that made you feel sick. The thing was that you would never cheat on anyone, knowing that going through something like that was one of the worst things that could happen to a person. You hadn\u2019t forgotten the way you had felt when your ex had betrayed you with someone else. You would never do that to anyone. Besides all of that you still loved your boyfriend to death, there was no one else you had eyes for but him. But someone had found a picture from you and a boy hugging each other in the middle of the mall and then a few pics of you getting coffee together. Did you know the guy? Yes, of course you did. You still hadn\u2019t passed the irrational point where you would go hugging strangers in the middle of the streets.\u00a0</p><p>But were you cheating on Taehyung with him? God no. The pictures didn\u2019t even indicate those things. They didn\u2019t tell anything, just two people meeting each other. But you knew how people could be, judging you with the first thoughts that popped up inside of their heads. In the end he was just an old friend from high school you had run into while you were shopping and since you hadn\u2019t wanted to be rude you had said yes when he had offered you to get some coffee. The only thing you had been trying to do was being nice to someone and now you had all of this going on. You were so sick and tired of your every single move being tracked and analyzed. You couldn\u2019t look at anyone, smile at a person, talk to someone, without others thinking you were madly in love with them and they had made you pregnant.\u00a0</p><p>Maybe it would be best if you\u2019d just lock yourself up in your house and make sure you had no contact with anyone but your boyfriend and your members, but even then they\u2019d be able to make something up.\u00a0There was always something, there was no way escaping it. It was upsetting that everyone seemed to be thinking you were capable of breaking someone\u2019s heart like that and you could possibly be such a terrible girlfriend. Your members said you just had to wait for it to blow over and that it would be forgotten soon enough, surely after you and Taehyung were spotted together in public once again. So that they could all see everything was fine and the rumors were fake. But you hated the fact that people had accused you from this in the first place. Did you look like a cheater to others? Upset and hurt by the situation you walked even faster and finally your apartment block popped up into view.\u00a0</p><p>Just a few more steps, you were almost there and then this nightmare would be over for today. Once you\u2019d be inside you wouldn\u2019t put a single step out of the door tonight. Your plan was to simply curl up on the couch, drowning in anger and self pity. Suddenly your plans were boycotted as two girls stopped in front of you and blocked your way, making you hold in your steps and look up. You were wearing a mask and your hear was falling over your face, still you knew it wouldn\u2019t help you to go somewhere unnoticed, people would always attempt to recognize you.\u00a0They both seemed to be around your age, one slightly taller than the other. But the expressions on their faces told you all you had to know. They weren\u2019t here to ask for a picture on an autograph. And if if they had, you weren\u2019t in the mood to give them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy did you cheat on Taehyung-oppa?\u201d One of them asked, the venom and hatred dripping for her voice as she spoke. It actually felt as if someone was slapping you straight in the face. You couldn\u2019t keep the pained look off your face as you stared at her. Just like everyone else she believed the rumors, and who were you to judge her for it? She was one of the many. But god did it hurt you when others didn\u2019t pick your side in these kind of situations. Where were your fans? The ones who had your back no matter what? The ones who knew you well enough to be sure that you would never do such thing? By now your managers had told you how to deal with these types of girls, the ones who weren\u2019t afraid to make contact with you on the streets. There were always a few different types of fans.\u00a0</p><p>The ones who respected your privacy and left you alone, those who would follow you but who wouldn\u2019t speak to you and those who would just straight out come forward and would point out what they wanted. You bowed your head slightly and then wanted to walk past them, hoping that this way you\u2019d be able to end this confrontation. But one of them grabbed your arm and pulled you back, making it impossible for you to continue your way. Your eyes widened as you finally looked them in the eye and your glances locked. They didn\u2019t just look angry, but furious and murderous. \u201cWhy did you do it? Isn\u2019t he good enough for you?\u201d She asked as if you were someone who had betrayed them and had scattered their hearts into thousands of pieces.\u00a0</p><p>You could hear the threatening tone inside of her voice, which made your muscles tense, prepared for whatever reaction you had to come forward with. You had never been attacked by fans before, but you had heard about it that there other stars who had.\u00a0You weren\u2019t afraid to stand up for yourself if you had to, but you surely didn\u2019t want to make a seen either. The last thing you needed at this point was to sent any more attention your way. You were trying to stay out of the media, not to make things even more complicated. \u201cI did\u2019t cheat on him, I never would. Now please let me go.\u201d Trying not to make it sound as if you were scared of them. You gave your arm a soft pull, hoping they would get the message and they would let this slide. They looked at each other as if they had no idea what to do with your words, discussing this without anything being said.\u00a0</p><p>To your surprise she let go of your arm and you were finally able walk away. it was only then that you noticed your heart had been stammering inside of your chest, prepared for what could have happened. You had no idea if they believed you or if they\u2019d believe the pictures, but you knew the truth and that was the most important thing. As fast as you could without making a fool out of yourself and making it seem as if you were running you walked towards your apartment. You let out a relieved sigh as you saw your door come in sight. Finally, you were home, you had survived your way back and now you just wanted this horrible day to end. You had heard enough lies for today and you were tired of people accusing you of something you hadn\u2019t done, you were sick of people doubting your loyalty and love for Teahyung.\u00a0</p><p>Grabbed your keys out of your bag, you opened the door, taking in the smell that reeked like home. It caused a sudden feeling of safety to settle down on top of you and for the first time today the tension inside of your shoulders disappeared. For the first time in hours you were able to catch your breath without having the feeling that everyone was staring at you. You kicked off your shoes and threw your stuff down on top the table, too tired to clean up your mess. It had been a long and exhausting day which had never seemed to end, but here you were, you had made it. While taking off your jacket your eyes glued onto the boy that was sitting on your couch, his laptop on his lap and a deep frown on his forehead. He hadn\u2019t greeted you when you had come in and panic started to overflow you.\u00a0</p><p>He surely must have heard about what had happened by now. This entire situation involved him as much as it did you. People were talking about his girlfriend, and not in a very good way. What if he believed the rumors as well, what if he thought you really cheated on him? \u201cTaehyung?\u201d You said in a high pitched voice and walked over to him, stopping a few steps in front of him so you could study his expression. His eyebrows rose as he heard your voice and he looked up from his screen so his eyes met yours. Relief washed over you when he shot you that adorable smile of his and put his laptop to the side before he patted his lap, motioning for you to sit down.\u00a0You let go of the breath you didn\u2019t know you\u2019d been holding.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey babe, I didn\u2019t hear you come in.\u201d He said as an apology of not greeting you. Slightly dazed you took place on his soft legs. All the recent events were still swirling around in your head, causing your reactions to be slow. He hummed in content as he felt your weight sink down on top of his legs and wrapped his arms around you middle. He nuzzled his nose into your hair and you could barely handle it that he pretended as if nothing was wrong. You had no idea how to react to his lovingly gestures and suddenly you started doubting if he even knew about your scandal at all. Yet, all his members used twitter, they had an account on Instagram and they had access to mobile data and wifi. It wasn\u2019t possible for him not to know.\u00a0</p><p>For a moment it remained silent inside of the apartment as you just sat there with him hugging you. You kept on going over things in your head, wondering about how you should bring up the topic. Actually you were so done talking about it today, but if there was one person you had to discuss this with than it was him. \u201cDid you hear?\u201d You asked eventually and couldn\u2019t even look at his face when he brought it to your level and stared at you. \u201cI did.\u201d He stated in a low voice and you were afraid you had just made him angry, that you had reminded him of it. \u201cBut\u00a0I also know it\u2019s not true.\u201d He quickly added and your eyes drew to his, your body relaxing visibly. He knew you would never do such a thing, Taehyung trusted you. He smiled when he saw your relieved expression and brushed your hair out of your face, linking it behind your ear.</p><p>\u201cOh come on, I\u2019ve dated you long enough to know that there\u2019s one thing you\u2019d never do. And I know that if you wouldn\u2019t want me anymore that you\u2019d just dump me and be honest about it instead of sneaking around behind my back with someone else. That\u2019s not your style.\u201d He said and pecked your nose, trying to get the look of disbelieve off your face that you were giving him right now. Was he seriously joking about this right now? You\u2019d thought that you would be angry because he seemed so careless about all of this. But to be honest, it was very refreshing to hear someone talking about it in such a way.

Innocent and breathtaking. But soon his mouth turned more hungry and rougher against yours, and the change in his ways made you gasp slightly. He pulled you up from the couch and stumbled backwards with you for a little, making you look like two lost penguins. Yet, he didn\u2019t break the kiss even once.</p><p>Then he placed his hands under your butt and as you got the hint you wrapped your arms around his neck before jumping up and placing your legs around his waist. His teeth bit down on your bottom lip gently which caused you to moan softly, giving him the opportunity to slip his tongue into your mouth. He explored your mouth for a few seconds and you felt your back hit the wall as he held you in place, his hands slipping up and down your body as you held onto him. Then his lips left yours and they began to trail down, leaving open mouth kisses as he went down your jaw and reached your neck.

But it didn&rsquo;t matter, even now at this moment, as you were walking back to your apartment, people were giving you stares and they were whispering. Not that it wasn&rsquo;t a normal thing for people to look at you. You were an idol so you usually got a lot of attention every time you went out. That was why most of the time you stayed indoors or if you decided to leave the safety of your own house you always made sure there was someone who would accompany you. It could be one of your band members or a bodyguard. Sometimes you would ask your manager if he had some free time to tag along with you. He didn&rsquo;t like it if you would leave without any supervision.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Anything could happen and if you were closed in by a big group of people, there was a chance you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to handle them on your own. Yet, even though you were used to it this amount of attention was different and you knew it. That was why you couldn&rsquo;t seem to get home fast enough. You wanted to get away from these people who glanced at you all the time as you walked past them, looking as if they wanted to scream at you or throw their hats at your head. You wanted to lock yourself in your apartment where you knew you were safe and where you knew that no one would judge you or make things up about you. Where you&rsquo;d be alone and in peace. There was no way you could deny that you loved your job.&nbsp;</p><p>You were a performer, the lead vocalist of your band and you were popular. You lived for music, it was your biggest love and passion. In most cases you loved your fans, but at this moment you felt a little betrayed.&nbsp;Every day and night you gave them your all as you wrote lyrics for them, to created your music and to meet them all over the world and then they&rsquo;d make up lies about you. All the gossips and fake information that was spread all over social media and the internet. A few months ago the first scandal popped up, yet that one had been different. You hadn&rsquo;t really minded about it, hadn&rsquo;t had the right to feel bad about it because it had all been true. You had known that you wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to hide it forever. It had been the scandal involving you and Kim Taehyung of BTS, pronouncing that the two of you were dating.&nbsp;</p><p>You had been caught on a date together and they had spotted you on the airport wearing the same bracelet and the same sweater. Both of them you had gotten from them and back then you had been innocent enough to think it wouldn&rsquo;t be a big deal if you&rsquo;d actually wear them. You&rsquo;d thought that there was no way people would be able to link the two of you together. Especially not since you would never wear it on the same day and the sweater looked like a very normal black pullover. There were thousands of people who wore those things. But the two of you being seen together, out and spending your free time together. You hadn&rsquo;t been able to work your way around that one. Eventually you had both given in and your companies had also confirmed that the two of you were dating.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, they both supported you and thought that your private relationships were your own doing. In the beginning fans had been furious, since you were both really popular in Korea.&nbsp;But after some time they had accepted it and they had moved on. Still, even today there were some of them who would try to find ways to break you and Taehyung apart, and this was surely one of them.&nbsp;In your pocket your phone beeped so you quickly grabbed it to check who it was. surprisingly enough it was your mother, who lived a whole end away from you. At the other side of the country to be precise, which caused that the two of you barely got the chance to see each other. These were one of those moments you missed her like crazy. You were craving for one of her hugs. You quickly opened the message and bit your lip when you read it. &lsquo;Baby, what&rsquo;s going on there? Did you and Tae broke up?&rsquo; She asked and you hated it that you had to explain this once again, you had been explaining all day long.&nbsp;</p><p>It was the only thing you&rsquo;d been doing since the moment you had woken up this morning. Your mother had always loved your boyfriend and she was very supportive of your relationship with him. She was proud that he was so talented and good looking and already looking forward to having your grandchildren. She could be a little bit fast passed sometimes. &lsquo;No, we&rsquo;re still together.&rsquo; You typed as a reply and hoped that she wouldn&rsquo;t ask any further questions, but since she was your mother and she worried about you, she did. &lsquo;Then what&rsquo;s is all of this about?&rsquo; She asked and you had always known that your mother was cool enough to check about you on the internet and about everything that was going on. She liked staying up to date with your career and everything involving your life. Yes, you had been caught up in another scandal. But unlike the last one, this one surely wasn&rsquo;t true.&nbsp;</p><p>It was all over the internet, saying that you were cheating on Taehyung with some other guy. All lies, one of those that made you feel sick. The thing was that you would never cheat on anyone, knowing that going through something like that was one of the worst things that could happen to a person. You hadn&rsquo;t forgotten the way you had felt when your ex had betrayed you with someone else. You would never do that to anyone. Besides all of that you still loved your boyfriend to death, there was no one else you had eyes for but him. But someone had found a picture from you and a boy hugging each other in the middle of the mall and then a few pics of you getting coffee together. Did you know the guy? Yes, of course you did. You still hadn&rsquo;t passed the irrational point where you would go hugging strangers in the middle of the streets.&nbsp;</p><p>But were you cheating on Taehyung with him? God no. The pictures didn&rsquo;t even indicate those things. They didn&rsquo;t tell anything, just two people meeting each other. But you knew how people could be, judging you with the first thoughts that popped up inside of their heads. In the end he was just an old friend from high school you had run into while you were shopping and since you hadn&rsquo;t wanted to be rude you had said yes when he had offered you to get some coffee. The only thing you had been trying to do was being nice to someone and now you had all of this going on. You were so sick and tired of your every single move being tracked and analyzed. You couldn&rsquo;t look at anyone, smile at a person, talk to someone, without others thinking you were madly in love with them and they had made you pregnant.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe it would be best if you&rsquo;d just lock yourself up in your house and make sure you had no contact with anyone but your boyfriend and your members, but even then they&rsquo;d be able to make something up.&nbsp;There was always something, there was no way escaping it. It was upsetting that everyone seemed to be thinking you were capable of breaking someone&rsquo;s heart like that and you could possibly be such a terrible girlfriend. Your members said you just had to wait for it to blow over and that it would be forgotten soon enough, surely after you and Taehyung were spotted together in public once again. So that they could all see everything was fine and the rumors were fake. But you hated the fact that people had accused you from this in the first place. Did you look like a cheater to others? Upset and hurt by the situation you walked even faster and finally your apartment block popped up into view.&nbsp;</p><p>Just a few more steps, you were almost there and then this nightmare would be over for today. Once you&rsquo;d be inside you wouldn&rsquo;t put a single step out of the door tonight. Your plan was to simply curl up on the couch, drowning in anger and self pity. Suddenly your plans were boycotted as two girls stopped in front of you and blocked your way, making you hold in your steps and look up. You were wearing a mask and your hear was falling over your face, still you knew it wouldn&rsquo;t help you to go somewhere unnoticed, people would always attempt to recognize you.&nbsp;They both seemed to be around your age, one slightly taller than the other. But the expressions on their faces told you all you had to know. They weren&rsquo;t here to ask for a picture on an autograph. And if if they had, you weren&rsquo;t in the mood to give them.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you cheat on Taehyung-oppa?&rdquo; One of them asked, the venom and hatred dripping for her voice as she spoke. It actually felt as if someone was slapping you straight in the face. You couldn&rsquo;t keep the pained look off your face as you stared at her. Just like everyone else she believed the rumors, and who were you to judge her for it? She was one of the many. But god did it hurt you when others didn&rsquo;t pick your side in these kind of situations. Where were your fans? The ones who had your back no matter what? The ones who knew you well enough to be sure that you would never do such thing? By now your managers had told you how to deal with these types of girls, the ones who weren&rsquo;t afraid to make contact with you on the streets. There were always a few different types of fans.&nbsp;</p><p>The ones who respected your privacy and left you alone, those who would follow you but who wouldn&rsquo;t speak to you and those who would just straight out come forward and would point out what they wanted. You bowed your head slightly and then wanted to walk past them, hoping that this way you&rsquo;d be able to end this confrontation. But one of them grabbed your arm and pulled you back, making it impossible for you to continue your way. Your eyes widened as you finally looked them in the eye and your glances locked. They didn&rsquo;t just look angry, but furious and murderous. &ldquo;Why did you do it? Isn&rsquo;t he good enough for you?&rdquo; She asked as if you were someone who had betrayed them and had scattered their hearts into thousands of pieces.&nbsp;</p><p>You could hear the threatening tone inside of her voice, which made your muscles tense, prepared for whatever reaction you had to come forward with. You had never been attacked by fans before, but you had heard about it that there other stars who had.&nbsp;You weren&rsquo;t afraid to stand up for yourself if you had to, but you surely didn&rsquo;t want to make a seen either. The last thing you needed at this point was to sent any more attention your way. You were trying to stay out of the media, not to make things even more complicated. &ldquo;I did&rsquo;t cheat on him, I never would. Now please let me go.&rdquo; Trying not to make it sound as if you were scared of them. You gave your arm a soft pull, hoping they would get the message and they would let this slide. They looked at each other as if they had no idea what to do with your words, discussing this without anything being said.&nbsp;</p><p>To your surprise she let go of your arm and you were finally able walk away. it was only then that you noticed your heart had been stammering inside of your chest, prepared for what could have happened. You had no idea if they believed you or if they&rsquo;d believe the pictures, but you knew the truth and that was the most important thing. As fast as you could without making a fool out of yourself and making it seem as if you were running you walked towards your apartment. You let out a relieved sigh as you saw your door come in sight. Finally, you were home, you had survived your way back and now you just wanted this horrible day to end. You had heard enough lies for today and you were tired of people accusing you of something you hadn&rsquo;t done, you were sick of people doubting your loyalty and love for Teahyung.&nbsp;</p><p>Grabbed your keys out of your bag, you opened the door, taking in the smell that reeked like home. It caused a sudden feeling of safety to settle down on top of you and for the first time today the tension inside of your shoulders disappeared. For the first time in hours you were able to catch your breath without having the feeling that everyone was staring at you. You kicked off your shoes and threw your stuff down on top the table, too tired to clean up your mess. It had been a long and exhausting day which had never seemed to end, but here you were, you had made it. While taking off your jacket your eyes glued onto the boy that was sitting on your couch, his laptop on his lap and a deep frown on his forehead. He hadn&rsquo;t greeted you when you had come in and panic started to overflow you.&nbsp;</p><p>He surely must have heard about what had happened by now. This entire situation involved him as much as it did you. People were talking about his girlfriend, and not in a very good way. What if he believed the rumors as well, what if he thought you really cheated on him? &ldquo;Taehyung?&rdquo; You said in a high pitched voice and walked over to him, stopping a few steps in front of him so you could study his expression. His eyebrows rose as he heard your voice and he looked up from his screen so his eyes met yours. Relief washed over you when he shot you that adorable smile of his and put his laptop to the side before he patted his lap, motioning for you to sit down.&nbsp;You let go of the breath you didn&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;d been holding.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey babe, I didn&rsquo;t hear you come in.&rdquo; He said as an apology of not greeting you. Slightly dazed you took place on his soft legs. All the recent events were still swirling around in your head, causing your reactions to be slow. He hummed in content as he felt your weight sink down on top of his legs and wrapped his arms around you middle. He nuzzled his nose into your hair and you could barely handle it that he pretended as if nothing was wrong. You had no idea how to react to his lovingly gestures and suddenly you started doubting if he even knew about your scandal at all. Yet, all his members used twitter, they had an account on Instagram and they had access to mobile data and wifi. It wasn&rsquo;t possible for him not to know.&nbsp;</p><p>For a moment it remained silent inside of the apartment as you just sat there with him hugging you. You kept on going over things in your head, wondering about how you should bring up the topic. Actually you were so done talking about it today, but if there was one person you had to discuss this with than it was him. &ldquo;Did you hear?&rdquo; You asked eventually and couldn&rsquo;t even look at his face when he brought it to your level and stared at you. &ldquo;I did.&rdquo; He stated in a low voice and you were afraid you had just made him angry, that you had reminded him of it. &ldquo;But&nbsp;I also know it&rsquo;s not true.&rdquo; He quickly added and your eyes drew to his, your body relaxing visibly. He knew you would never do such a thing, Taehyung trusted you. He smiled when he saw your relieved expression and brushed your hair out of your face, linking it behind your ear.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh come on, I&rsquo;ve dated you long enough to know that there&rsquo;s one thing you&rsquo;d never do. And I know that if you wouldn&rsquo;t want me anymore that you&rsquo;d just dump me and be honest about it instead of sneaking around behind my back with someone else. That&rsquo;s not your style.&rdquo; He said and pecked your nose, trying to get the look of disbelieve off your face that you were giving him right now. Was he seriously joking about this right now? You&rsquo;d thought that you would be angry because he seemed so careless about all of this. But to be honest, it was very refreshing to hear someone talking about it in such a way. He was bringing to words what you had wanted to scream from the rooftops all day long. You had always thought that Taehyung knew you better than you knew yourself, but this was indescribable.&nbsp;</p><p>Did he not even doubt you when people confronted him with this in the morning? &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever not want you anymore so I guess you shouldn&rsquo;t wait for that.&rdquo; You said as you combed your fingers through his, he contently leaned into your touch. &ldquo;Good.&rdquo; He muttered as an answer before taking your head in his hands and pressing his lips on yours.&nbsp;The kiss started off sweet and lovingly, like all of his kisses were. Innocent and breathtaking. But soon his mouth turned more hungry and rougher against yours, and the change in his ways made you gasp slightly. He pulled you up from the couch and stumbled backwards with you for a little, making you look like two lost penguins. Yet, he didn&rsquo;t break the kiss even once.</p><p>Then he placed his hands under your butt and as you got the hint you wrapped your arms around his neck before jumping up and placing your legs around his waist. His teeth bit down on your bottom lip gently which caused you to moan softly, giving him the opportunity to slip his tongue into your mouth. He explored your mouth for a few seconds and you felt your back hit the wall as he held you in place, his hands slipping up and down your body as you held onto him. Then his lips left yours and they began to trail down, leaving open mouth kisses as he went down your jaw and reached your neck. You tangled your hands in his hair as you felt him sucking on your sweat spot and holding your hips, pressing you against him.&nbsp;&ldquo;W-what are you doing?&rdquo; You knew how breathless you sounded, but you couldn&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp;</p><p>Taehyung chuckled against your skin which made a shiver run down your spine and he bit down once more, making you tilt your head even further. &ldquo;I want everyone to see that you&rsquo;re mine, so I guess I should mark you.&rdquo; He said and then his head came up and he looked you in the eye. &ldquo;You are mine ____________, I&rsquo;ll simply making sure you don&rsquo;t forget.&rdquo; He said as he leaned his forehead against yours and breathed heavily, a blush covering his cheeks. He was still holding you up and gently placed his hands underneath your thighs, making sure you wouldn&rsquo;t slip away. &ldquo;I would never forget.&rdquo; You whispered and his dark eyes locked with yours, so you could no longer look away. &ldquo;I love you Tae.&rdquo; You confessed and he smiled at you, pecking your lips before putting you down and pulling you in for a tight hug. &ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://yourdreamscenarios.tumblr.com/post/177692218575/bts-masterlist\">BTS Masterlist</a></p>",

It was quite late in the morning, but he didn\u2019t mind. It was his day off after all. Instead of climbing out of the bed, he turned on his other side and closed his eyes again. He didn\u2019t plan to sleep, he just wanted some time to lay there, doing nothing. As his body woke up with him, he noticed a peculiar feeling and the need to tuck his feet under the blanket which slipped away as he turned. It was never this cold in the morning. He was used to sleeping with the window open, inviting in the brisk night air which then always turns to the welcoming warm morning breeze. But something was wrong. He pushed himself up to the window by the feet of his bed. As the blanket moved with him, he felt the cold hit his back and arms. The sunrays blinded him for a few seconds as he leaned out to look at the city of Omelas.</p><p>Around that time, his friend was already up and running. He too noticed the strange temperature, but he was sure it was just him. He came to work at the festival like every year. And like every year he stood at the gates of the festival grounds, waiting for the people to come in. But the streets were empty. The streets that were usually full of people, were now only occupied by the cold wind chasing leaves along the roads.</p><p>After a few hours, with nobody turning up to the festival, he decided to go home. His journey home was quite long, and he didn\u2019t mind that most of the time, but now, with the cold air embracing him on every step it seemed infinite.</p><p>He made his way along the city wall, hugging his body to withstand the cold. He saw the city gate in front of him. He always had to pass through here, never giving a second thought to the scenery outside the walls. He was happy here, why should he leave?</p><p>But today he hesitated. He stood in the middle of the gaping hole, the cold wind running past him through the gate. The sun-kissed plain outside seemed inviting, but far away. He noticed a figure sitting in the corner. A young man, no older than 23 was curled up against the massive wood, his eyes soundly closed. He seemed to be bothered by the wind only slightly, as he was probably used to the draft coming through the gate.</p><p>\u201cHey! Seokjin!\u201d someone called.</p><p>He turned around to see his friend, still in his pyjamas, his only shield from the cold being the bathrobe flailing behind him, only his left foot bearing a slipper.</p><p>\u201cHave you gone mad?! Going out like this in this weather?! Seriously Hoseok, I can\u2019t believe-\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at yourself before you start bashing my pyjamas,\u201d said Hoseok in between pants and gasps for air.</p><p>He was right, Jin\u2019s body was covered by a mere short sleeved t-shirt and shorts. Not the best attire today.</p><p>The cold wind blew from the heart of the city once again, reminding the two of its presence.</p><p>\u201cWe should get out of here. Come over, my place is closer,\u201d said Seokjin and led the way to his door.</p><p>Once inside, Jin dashed across the apartment to close all the windows.</p><p>Hoseok dusted off his right foot before stepping into the apartment and took off his remaining slipper.</p><p>\u201cDo you want some tea?\u201d called Seokjin from the kitchen as Hoseok made his way from the hall.</p><p>\u201cCould I ask for a coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because it\u2019s you,\u201d Jin replied, reaching for the coffee in the overhead cabinet.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you running around like that anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw you at the gate, I thought you were going to walk away,\u201d Hoseok admitted and sat down at the kitchen table.</p><p>\u201cMe? Walking- Oh please Hoseok, You think I\u2019d go out there?\u201d Seokjin laughed and poured the boiling water into the two prepared cups.</p><p>\u201cIt sure looked like it. The way you stood there\u2026\u201d Hoseok trailed off and took the cup Seokjin handed to him.</p><p>\u201cOh, believe me, I have no intention of leaving anytime soon. Where would I go? What is there outside of Omelas that makes them go?\u201d Seokjin debated</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s more about what\u2019s inside that makes then leave,\u201d said Hoseok, taking a sip of the coffee in his hands. He flinched away, repulsed by the boiling hot beverage that burned his lips.</p><p>\u201cYou mean the child, don\u2019t you?\u201d Seokjin questioned, his tone turning serious.</p><p>Hoseok shrugged. \u201cI mean, you\u2019ve never even seen it, how do you know what it feels like to see it suffer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t either,\u201d Jin objected.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one that looked like he was joining that guy who\u2019s camping by the gate,\u201d Hoseok snapped back.</p><p>\u201cYou really think he\u2019s leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he did, but now he\u2019s second-guessing,\u201d replied Hoseok and blew into the black liquid in his cup to cool it down.</p><p>Someone knocked on the door frantically. Jin put his cup onto the counter and went to open the door. Behind them, was a postman gasping for air. He shoved newspaper into Seokjin\u2019s hands and ran off.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d asked Hoseok when Jin came back unfolding the newspaper as he went.</p><p>Jin felt his hands shiver. The blood in his veins turned into lead and the papers fell out of his hands. He ran to the window.</p><p>Hoseok curiously reached for the newspaper.</p><p>As he turned it to the title page, he felt freezing air climb up his back.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"5795\" data-orig-height=\"4097\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/48208e99da6d110136bb829433765ad8/tumblr_inline_pfq6vx2RMq1tamcsr_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5795\" data-orig-height=\"4097\"/></figure><p>\n\n<b><a href=\"https://shesushathcometh.tumblr.com/post/177586355486/masterlist\"></a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"https://shesushathcometh.tumblr.com/post/177586355486/masterlist\">Masterlist</a> / <a href=\"https://shesushathcometh.tumblr.com/post/178601779691/until-the-spring-comes-again-omelasbts-au-part\">Next Part</a></b>\n\n</p><p><b>A/N:</b> Welcome to the next series!

It was quite late in the morning, but he didn\u2019t mind. It was his day off after all. Instead of climbing out of the bed, he turned on his other side and closed his eyes again. He didn\u2019t plan to sleep, he just wanted some time to lay there, doing nothing. As his body woke up with him, he noticed a peculiar feeling and the need to tuck his feet under the blanket which slipped away as he turned. It was never this cold in the morning. He was used to sleeping with the window open, inviting in the brisk night air which then always turns to the welcoming warm morning breeze. But something was wrong. He pushed himself up to the window by the feet of his bed. As the blanket moved with him, he felt the cold hit his back and arms. The sunrays blinded him for a few seconds as he leaned out to look at the city of Omelas.</p><p>Around that time, his friend was already up and running. He too noticed the strange temperature, but he was sure it was just him. He came to work at the festival like every year. And like every year he stood at the gates of the festival grounds, waiting for the people to come in. But the streets were empty. The streets that were usually full of people, were now only occupied by the cold wind chasing leaves along the roads.</p><p>After a few hours, with nobody turning up to the festival, he decided to go home. His journey home was quite long, and he didn\u2019t mind that most of the time, but now, with the cold air embracing him on every step it seemed infinite.</p><p>He made his way along the city wall, hugging his body to withstand the cold. He saw the city gate in front of him. He always had to pass through here, never giving a second thought to the scenery outside the walls. He was happy here, why should he leave?</p><p>But today he hesitated. He stood in the middle of the gaping hole, the cold wind running past him through the gate. The sun-kissed plain outside seemed inviting, but far away. He noticed a figure sitting in the corner. A young man, no older than 23 was curled up against the massive wood, his eyes soundly closed. He seemed to be bothered by the wind only slightly, as he was probably used to the draft coming through the gate.</p><p>\u201cHey! Seokjin!\u201d someone called.</p><p>He turned around to see his friend, still in his pyjamas, his only shield from the cold being the bathrobe flailing behind him, only his left foot bearing a slipper.</p><p>\u201cHave you gone mad?!

Hay gente que odia a SHINee por seguir sin Jonghyung.</p><p>Los insultos no son una broma. Es quiz\u00e1 mi lado amargado de la vida, pero muchos de esos memes que s\u00f3lo \u201ctratan de hacer re\u00edr\u201d a otros a costa de los dem\u00e1s, son en realidad ofensivos, denigrantes. No comprendo c\u00f3mo no se dan cuenta, porque si otra persona repitiera sus palabras exactas, pero dirigidas a su propio grupo, se ofender\u00edan. \u00bfEntonces? \u00bfEs realmente la intenci\u00f3n agredir? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9? \u00bfPara dejar claro que no siguen a las masas? \u00bfPara ser diferentes? Si quieren ser diferentes dejen de agredir a otros, que eso lo hacen todos.</p>",
