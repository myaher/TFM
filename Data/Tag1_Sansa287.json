You Bet Your Ass She Will! </h1><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"211\" data-orig-width=\"245\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/25a9fdb018c581b0980f3a3129049596/tumblr_pf1wv0Wufe1v81iri_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"211\" data-orig-width=\"245\"/></figure><p>I briefly discussed this yesterday with @puresummermagic and it\u2019s been a topic I\u2019ve been thinking about for awhile. I personally believe that Cersei will absolutely make a play for Winterfell. I\u2019m willing to bet money on it! Why you ask? Well because essentially the two smartest players in the game brought up the importance of not ignoring/forgetting Cersei and 100% imply that she will make a play! Sansa and Littlefinger were the only people who were taking the Cersei threat seriously and are not underestimating her at all! </p><p>In the scene above here\u2019s the most important parts of Jon and Sansa\u2019s dialogue:</p><h2>Sansa:\u201d<i>You\u2019ve been so consumed with the enemy in the North you\u2019ve <b>forgotten  </b></i>about<i> the one to the south.\u201d</i></h2><h2>Sansa: \u201c<i>We still have a wall between us and the Night King there\u2019s nothing between us and Cersei.\u201d</i></h2><h2>Jon: \u201cT<i>here\u2019s a thousand miles between us and Cersei. Winter is here the Lannister\u2019s are a southern army. They\u2019ll <b>NEVER</b> range this far North.\u201d</i></h2><h2>Sansa: \u201c<i>You\u2019re the military man but <b>I KNOW HER. </b>If your her enemy, <b>She\u2019ll Never Stop </b>until she\u2019s destroyed you. Everyone who\u2019s ever crossed her she\u2019s found a way to murder!\u201d</i></h2><p>Y\u2019all this entire dialogue is so important! It wasn\u2019t just filler for the show. There\u2019s one important point I want to bring up about this scene. I love that fact that Sansa makes it explicitly clear to Jon that she knows Cersei. She is fully aware of who they\u2019re enemy is and what she\u2019s capable of. Apart from the stories Jon\u2019s heard and the atrocities Cersei has brought upon his family, he doesn\u2019t know shit about Cersei! He hasn\u2019t had firsthand experience of her cruelty and shouldn\u2019t assume that he knows what she\u2019s capable of or whether or not she\u2019s a viable threat because of winter. Honestly that\u2019s silly.</p><p>For some reason this scene makes me think of Olenna\u2019s words to Jaimie here:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"582\" data-orig-width=\"970\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/38082e6f1b0685f82004bbb3016943c4/tumblr_pf1wv1GjlV1v81iri_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"582\" data-orig-width=\"970\"/></figure><p>In this scene Olenna says:</p><h2>\u201c<i>Whatever</i> <i>I imagined necessary for House Tyrell I did, but your sister has done things <b>I wasn\u2019t capabale of imagining. </b>That was my prized mistake a <b>failure of imagination!\u201d</b></i></h2><p>This is the enemy that Jon and Sansa are dealing with. This is what Jon fails to understand. This is a person who is capable of doing things that even some of the smartest game players couldn\u2019t even fathom. Olenna\u2019s words also reminds me of this scene:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"165\" data-orig-width=\"250\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2998f519c016c0cdfaf53a9f890c8d3e/tumblr_pf1wv2ROZx1v81iri_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"165\" data-orig-width=\"250\"/></figure><p>Littlefinger mentions that the northerners are solely focused on the threat beyond the wall.</p><h2>Sansa: \u201c<i>As they should be.\u201d</i></h2><h2>Littlefinger:\u201d<i><b>I know</b> Cersei better than anyone here. <b>If you turn your back on her&hellip;&hellip;\u201d</b></i></h2><p>Y\u2019all, the show is making it perfectly clear that Cersei is a threat that should equally be taken as seriously as the Night King. Make no mistake, Sansa absolutely agrees with Littlefingers assessment of the situation. She\u2019s already ahead of the game which is why she broached this same topic with Jon in the first episode of the season.  But of course, she\u2019s not going to openly agree with Littlefinger and let him know her thoughts. She\u2019s going to continue to do her part to prepare her people for the long night.</p><h2>Anyway back to the meta! </h2><p>After Sansa states that she\u2019s fully aware of how dangerous Cersei is Littlefinger\u2019s response is this:</p><h2>\u201c<i>Fight every battle everywhere always in your <b>mind</b>. Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend. <b>Every possible series of events is happening all at once; Live that way and nothing  will surprise you! </b>Everything that happens will be something that you\u2019ve seen before! \u201c</i></h2><p>I think this is foreshadowing of Game of Thrones in general but I also think this is foreshadowing particularly pertaining to Cersei. I mean how can it not be! This was the piece of advice Littlefinger gave Sansa after discussing Cersei! Also this definitely makes Olenna\u2019s words come to life. </p><p>Where Olenna failed was that she couldn\u2019t think about the endless <b>POSSIBILITIES</b> that Cersei could see to her families demise. Her imagination wasn\u2019t big enough. Essentially what Littlefinger is telling Sansa here is that she needs to always stretch the boundaries of her imagination. She needs to always think about every possibility certain situations can play out so that she can never be caught off guard.</p><p>Cersei has absolutely no problem in this department. This is the same women who stays up all night thinking about ways she can get her revenge/kill her enemies. Her imagination knows no boundaries and she\u2019s down to do whatever is necessary to accomplish her goals.</p><p>That\u2019s why I believe without a doubt that Cersei is going make a play for Winterfell! Winter or not if she wants to do something she\u2019s going to do it! I can totally see Cersei attacking Winterfell as the Night King is attacking Winterfell, I can see her kidnapping Sansa, I can see her doing a lot of crazy shit! The point is Cersei is not going to sit on the Iron Throne and wait for her enemies to arrive at her doorstep! She always has a game going on behind the scenes and I fully expect for her to pull out her biggest tricks in the last season.</p>",

I personally believe that Cersei will absolutely make a play for Winterfell. I\u2019m willing to bet money on it! Why you ask? Well because essentially the two smartest players in the game brought up the importance of not ignoring/forgetting Cersei and 100% imply that she will make a play! Sansa and Littlefinger were the only people who were taking the Cersei threat seriously and are not underestimating her at all! </p><p>In the scene above here\u2019s the most important parts of Jon and Sansa\u2019s dialogue:</p><h2>Sansa:\u201d<i>You\u2019ve been so consumed with the enemy in the North you\u2019ve <b>forgotten  </b></i>about<i> the one to the south.\u201d</i></h2><h2>Sansa: \u201c<i>We still have a wall between us and the Night King there\u2019s nothing between us and Cersei.\u201d</i></h2><h2>Jon: \u201cT<i>here\u2019s a thousand miles between us and Cersei.

There\u2019s one important point I want to bring up about this scene. I love that fact that Sansa makes it explicitly clear to Jon that she knows Cersei. She is fully aware of who they\u2019re enemy is and what she\u2019s capable of. Apart from the stories Jon\u2019s heard and the atrocities Cersei has brought upon his family, he doesn\u2019t know shit about Cersei!
