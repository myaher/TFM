With or without a man. So she recruits one of the Avengers for assistance. But how exactly will that pan out for them? (Part 9 of my series - Chasing Time)</p><p>The next day you had notice that some of the tension between you and Steve had finally subsided. You were relieved that he was finally able to be alone with you in the same room without the two of you feeling anxious, and were happy to have your friend back.</p><p>When he came into the living room you were relaxing on the couch with your feet propped up on a pillow. Recently you\u2019d found yourself bingeing Once Upon A Time on Netflix; <i>which was exactly what you were doing now.</i></p><p>To your surprise, he\u2019d popped some popcorn, handed you a bowl, and plopped down on the other couch. \u201cExtra butter, no salt,\u201d he chimed in, tossing a handful into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a real Prince Charming,\u201d you laughed, referencing the show as you nibbled on it and continued to watch.</p><p>Without warning a shooting pain ran through your back, and you felt a sudden pressure in your lower abdomen begin to release. Sitting up on the couch brought no relief, and you thought you were going to pass out between the clear liquid that you\u2019d noticed on the floor and the amount of sheer pain you were in.</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Steve gasped, leaping from the couch to help you stand up.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, I can\u2019t; it hurts too much,\u201d you cried, clenching your teeth to keep yourself from screaming.</p><p>\u201cFriday, call Tony,\u201d he panicked, sifting you into his arms as he carried you to the lab. He was hoping that Tony would be able to keep his promise to you of showing up in ten minutes or less.</p><p>Laying you down on the hospital bed that Tony had installed months ago for this exact occasion, you felt some of the pain begin to subside at the feeling of lying on your back. Sitting up had been a bad decision due to the pain, and you doubted you had the strength to do it again anyways.</p><p>Just then Tony Stark himself came busting through the door in his full Iron Man suit, and you\u2019d never been so relieved to see him.</p><p>\u201cCapsicle, out,\u201d he demanded, pointing his thumb at the door, as he got everything ready for the delivery as quickly as he could.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying,\u201d Steve argued, standing his ground.</p><p>\u201cThen suit up,\u201d Tony said, throwing him a blue disposable gown to slip on over his regular clothes. They\u2019d both put on a pair of gloves as well before Tony went to inspect the situation.</p><p>\u201cNuh-uh, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Steve stopped him, refusing to let him check on the baby.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t exactly the time for subtlety, Rogers. Either I help her, or you do it yourself,\u201d he shot back, noticing how red Steve\u2019s face got. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d Tony said, flatly, before urging you to push.</p><p>The amount of pain you were in made you want to scream at the top of your lungs. It felt like every bone inside your body was breaking, and you\u2019d silently regretted ever getting yourself into this situation. You\u2019d be damned to ever consider doing it again.</p><p>It went on for hours. The loud sobbing, pushing over and over again until you felt like you just couldn\u2019t do it anymore. It was pure agony, but Tony and Steve were doing their best to help you through it. When Natasha finally got there with Clint and Banner, Steve stepped out to tell them how you were doing.</p><p>You were shaking as Tony promised you that this would be the last one, and you felt almost all of the pain release and subside. He lifted the baby into your arms and let him rest against your heaving chest as you tried to catch your breath.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations; what\u2019s his name?\u201d Tony asked, relishing in the moment.</p><p>\u201cChristopher Grant,\u201d you explained pressing your cheek, gently, to your son\u2019s forehead. There was no hiding the tears that had welled up in your eyes. He may have been small, and underweight, but he was still the perfect baby.</p><p>Tony stepped out to talk to the others, and Steve came back in. His breath caught in his throat, and his eyes grew damp at the sight of you holding his baby boy. There wasn\u2019t a doubt in his mind that you were going to be an amazing mother. </p><p>Coming closer he began to notice the uncanny resemblance that the child had to him. The: dirty blonde hair, full lips, larger nose, and bright blue eyes, were all tell tale signs that he was the father. This baby was the spitting image of his daddy, and he couldn\u2019t be more proud.</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna hold him?\u201d The question hung in the air after you\u2019d asked it, but, soon enough, he came a little closer and held out his arms. He swayed back and forth, rubbing the pad of his thumb across his son\u2019s cheek and feeling something wash over him that he had never felt before. It felt like peace; like no matter what happened from here on out he would always be happy.</p><p>\u201cHe looks just like you,\u201d you smiled, feeling your cheeks start to burn.</p><p>Your calm surrounding had been short lived, though, as everyone came barging into the room yelling their congratulations.</p><p>\u201cAw! No fair! I wanted to be the first one to hold him!\u201d Natasha whimpered, starting to pout like a child who didn\u2019t get their way.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re making him the godfather? I mean, Steve wouldn\u2019t know what to do with a kid even if he had one,\u201d Banner said and you choked out a laugh in response.</p><p>\u201cNatasha, you\u2019re the godmother, and Tony&hellip;\u201d you bit down on your lip, hoping he would say yes. \u201cWould you consider being Christopher\u2019s godfather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d never ask,\u201d Tony smirked, placing his hand over where his heart should be as he pretended to get flustered.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, cause that\u2019s gonna turn out great,\u201d Clint quipped sarcastically as he let out a small laugh, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cOn the bright side, that kid is gonna get some pretty damn good presents,\u201d Banner said, weighing the idea in his head.</p><p>\u201cRight, <i>about that</i>, Natasha, I hope you don\u2019t mind? That sailor outfit you\u2019re going to get him on his first birthday? <i>Yeah</i>, I\u2019m gonna have <i>no</i> trouble beating that when I give him his first suit.\u201d Tony chimed in, taking the opportunity to one up his friend.</p><p>\u201cThat better be a suit and tie, and not some kind of mini iron thing that I have to worry about?\u201d You shot back, joining in on this newfound family feud.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you figure that one out for yourself,\u201d Tony mumbled, knowing everyone could hear him perfectly well.</p><p>\u201cGreat, so if this kid is even <i>half</i> as cocky as you, he\u2019ll <i>still</i> be twice as cocky as the average person.\u201d Nat said, continuing to banter with him.</p><p>\u201cAwesome is a blessing, not a curse, sweet heart. Some of us are born with greatness, and the others just end up as Captain America fans,\u201d Tony explained, taking a shot at Steve.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Tony, not everyone\u2019s equipped to being a super soldier,\u201d you defended him with a sly smile.</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9,\u201d Tony commended, enjoying where this conversation had gone.</p><p>One by one they all passed Christopher around the room until it was finally time for everyone to go. Tony said you\u2019d needed your rest, and he hadn\u2019t been lying. It was Steve who still didn\u2019t want to leave you, though.

With or without a man. So she recruits one of the Avengers for assistance. But how exactly will that pan out for them? (Part 9 of my series - Chasing Time)</p><p>The next day you had notice that some of the tension between you and Steve had finally subsided. You were relieved that he was finally able to be alone with you in the same room without the two of you feeling anxious, and were happy to have your friend back.</p><p>When he came into the living room you were relaxing on the couch with your feet propped up on a pillow. Recently you\u2019d found yourself bingeing Once Upon A Time on Netflix; <i>which was exactly what you were doing now.</i></p><p>To your surprise, he\u2019d popped some popcorn, handed you a bowl, and plopped down on the other couch. \u201cExtra butter, no salt,\u201d he chimed in, tossing a handful into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a real Prince Charming,\u201d you laughed, referencing the show as you nibbled on it and continued to watch.</p><p>Without warning a shooting pain ran through your back, and you felt a sudden pressure in your lower abdomen begin to release. Sitting up on the couch brought no relief, and you thought you were going to pass out between the clear liquid that you\u2019d noticed on the floor and the amount of sheer pain you were in.</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Steve gasped, leaping from the couch to help you stand up.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, I can\u2019t; it hurts too much,\u201d you cried, clenching your teeth to keep yourself from screaming.</p><p>\u201cFriday, call Tony,\u201d he panicked, sifting you into his arms as he carried you to the lab. He was hoping that Tony would be able to keep his promise to you of showing up in ten minutes or less.</p><p>Laying you down on the hospital bed that Tony had installed months ago for this exact occasion, you felt some of the pain begin to subside at the feeling of lying on your back. Sitting up had been a bad decision due to the pain, and you doubted you had the strength to do it again anyways.</p><p>Just then Tony Stark himself came busting through the door in his full Iron Man suit, and you\u2019d never been so relieved to see him.</p><p>\u201cCapsicle, out,\u201d he demanded, pointing his thumb at the door, as he got everything ready for the delivery as quickly as he could.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying,\u201d Steve argued, standing his ground.</p><p>\u201cThen suit up,\u201d Tony said, throwing him a blue disposable gown to slip on over his regular clothes. They\u2019d both put on a pair of gloves as well before Tony went to inspect the situation.</p><p>\u201cNuh-uh, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Steve stopped him, refusing to let him check on the baby.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t exactly the time for subtlety, Rogers. Either I help her, or you do it yourself,\u201d he shot back, noticing how red Steve\u2019s face got. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d Tony said, flatly, before urging you to push.</p><p>The amount of pain you were in made you want to scream at the top of your lungs. It felt like every bone inside your body was breaking, and you\u2019d silently regretted ever getting yourself into this situation. You\u2019d be damned to ever consider doing it again.</p><p>It went on for hours. The loud sobbing, pushing over and over again until you felt like you just couldn\u2019t do it anymore. It was pure agony, but Tony and Steve were doing their best to help you through it. When Natasha finally got there with Clint and Banner, Steve stepped out to tell them how you were doing.</p><p>You were shaking as Tony promised you that this would be the last one, and you felt almost all of the pain release and subside. He lifted the baby into your arms and let him rest against your heaving chest as you tried to catch your breath.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations; what\u2019s his name?\u201d Tony asked, relishing in the moment.</p><p>\u201cChristopher Grant,\u201d you explained pressing your cheek, gently, to your son\u2019s forehead. There was no hiding the tears that had welled up in your eyes. He may have been small, and underweight, but he was still the perfect baby.</p><p>Tony stepped out to talk to the others, and Steve came back in. His breath caught in his throat, and his eyes grew damp at the sight of you holding his baby boy. There wasn\u2019t a doubt in his mind that you were going to be an amazing mother. </p><p>Coming closer he began to notice the uncanny resemblance that the child had to him. The: dirty blonde hair, full lips, larger nose, and bright blue eyes, were all tell tale signs that he was the father. This baby was the spitting image of his daddy, and he couldn\u2019t be more proud.</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna hold him?\u201d The question hung in the air after you\u2019d asked it, but, soon enough, he came a little closer and held out his arms. He swayed back and forth, rubbing the pad of his thumb across his son\u2019s cheek and feeling something wash over him that he had never felt before. It felt like peace; like no matter what happened from here on out he would always be happy.</p><p>\u201cHe looks just like you,\u201d you smiled, feeling your cheeks start to burn.</p><p>Your calm surrounding had been short lived, though, as everyone came barging into the room yelling their congratulations.</p><p>\u201cAw! No fair! I wanted to be the first one to hold him!\u201d Natasha whimpered, starting to pout like a child who didn\u2019t get their way.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re making him the godfather? I mean, Steve wouldn\u2019t know what to do with a kid even if he had one,\u201d Banner said and you choked out a laugh in response.</p><p>\u201cNatasha, you\u2019re the godmother, and Tony\u2026\u201d you bit down on your lip, hoping he would say yes. \u201cWould you consider being Christopher\u2019s godfather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d never ask,\u201d Tony smirked, placing his hand over where his heart should be as he pretended to get flustered.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, cause that\u2019s gonna turn out great,\u201d Clint quipped sarcastically as he let out a small laugh, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cOn the bright side, that kid is gonna get some pretty damn good presents,\u201d Banner said, weighing the idea in his head.</p><p>\u201cRight, <i>about that</i>, Natasha, I hope you don\u2019t mind? That sailor outfit you\u2019re going to get him on his first birthday? <i>Yeah</i>, I\u2019m gonna have <i>no</i> trouble beating that when I give him his first suit.\u201d Tony chimed in, taking the opportunity to one up his friend.</p><p>\u201cThat better be a suit and tie, and not some kind of mini iron thing that I have to worry about?\u201d You shot back, joining in on this newfound family feud.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you figure that one out for yourself,\u201d Tony mumbled, knowing everyone could hear him perfectly well.</p><p>\u201cGreat, so if this kid is even <i>half</i> as cocky as you, he\u2019ll <i>still</i> be twice as cocky as the average person.\u201d Nat said, continuing to banter with him.</p><p>\u201cAwesome is a blessing, not a curse, sweet heart. Some of us are born with greatness, and the others just end up as Captain America fans,\u201d Tony explained, taking a shot at Steve.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Tony, not everyone\u2019s equipped to being a super soldier,\u201d you defended him with a sly smile.</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9,\u201d Tony commended, enjoying where this conversation had gone.</p><p>One by one they all passed Christopher around the room until it was finally time for everyone to go. Tony said you\u2019d needed your rest, and he hadn\u2019t been lying. It was Steve who still didn\u2019t want to leave you, though. As tired as he was from all of this, he still wanted to spend these moments by your side. His adrenaline had kicked in before, but now he was completely exhausted. So he sat down again on the floor outside the lab, leaned his back against the wall and drifted off to sleep.

That sailor outfit you\u2019re going to get him on his first birthday? <i>Yeah</i>, I\u2019m gonna have <i>no</i> trouble beating that when I give him his first suit.\u201d Tony chimed in, taking the opportunity to one up his friend.</p><p>\u201cThat better be a suit and tie, and not some kind of mini iron thing that I have to worry about?\u201d You shot back, joining in on this newfound family feud.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you figure that one out for yourself,\u201d Tony mumbled, knowing everyone could hear him perfectly well.</p><p>\u201cGreat, so if this kid is even <i>half</i> as cocky as you, he\u2019ll <i>still</i> be twice as cocky as the average person.\u201d Nat said, continuing to banter with him.</p><p>\u201cAwesome is a blessing, not a curse, sweet heart. Some of us are born with greatness, and the others just end up as Captain America fans,\u201d Tony explained, taking a shot at Steve.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Tony, not everyone\u2019s equipped to being a super soldier,\u201d you defended him with a sly smile.</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9,\u201d Tony commended, enjoying where this conversation had gone.</p><p>One by one they all passed Christopher around the room until it was finally time for everyone to go. Tony said you\u2019d needed your rest, and he hadn\u2019t been lying. It was Steve who still didn\u2019t want to leave you, though. As tired as he was from all of this, he still wanted to spend these moments by your side. His adrenaline had kicked in before, but now he was completely exhausted. So he sat down again on the floor outside the lab, leaned his back against the wall and drifted off to sleep. Still fighting his inner battle of where his heart truly belonged.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlEkSWZ9dJTn4Y9JxAWNX-Q\">@carebaredanvers</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLol1OcHL2rmi9B4PNj0NWQ\">@torntaltos</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnFX0pXMCKg_8GMvIKMEqoQ\">@homecomlng</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCKGyB8y0bJM6lTdhbDcNdg\">@bluediamondsevie</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCbV1cF2DMP4gAqwGA6V2YA\">@vesta-ro</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUfRsJskiU5727kZKnV69JQ\">@iron-sass</a> </p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJCXAvjcj-IB6BeTMyutDPw\">@marcelaverzani</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqDJV0UCKPPlt8Aq244Kkrg\">@mrspeacem1nusone</a> </p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRi3VskABqbEWy2Qc7OV5qA\">@myles-production</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m99kO19qGoDHJzEGvk31yEA\">@stevieboyharrington</a> </p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMzaT0sFrRGUXJrSSGvgMLg\">@mariemrose</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKo2lAlByHUc3lSEAKHnWKw\">@ncrediblelove</a> </p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mF6Ch3_J55WVnFGxzweGfBQ\">@captain-seriously-don-t</a> @xchrisxevansx <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXeese0H3qAL8DvIHbxZ1bw\">@marvelouspottering</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfRbuer0Ao1vzY__PT3YSVg\">@stat89posts</a> </p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgGkp1B8w_TH9LJhDDXXW7A\">@denzmallows</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6tvLQ4mYmjimndXXdKoO5w\">@imafangirlofeverything</a> </p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxvEGvtLloe7leiTGiV4zhg\">@humandasaster</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYOo_hessZvLRbEoIENnpuA\">@sgtevanstan</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8OoxCRbaxMWM13-uIm0QXw\">@americasarse</a> </p></p>",

With or without a man. So she recruits one of the Avengers for assistance. But how exactly will that pan out for them? (Part 9 of my series - Chasing Time)</p><p>The next day you had notice that some of the tension between you and Steve had finally subsided. You were relieved that he was finally able to be alone with you in the same room without the two of you feeling anxious, and were happy to have your friend back.</p><p>When he came into the living room you were relaxing on the couch with your feet propped up on a pillow. Recently you&rsquo;d found yourself bingeing Once Upon A Time on Netflix; <i>which was exactly what you were doing now.</i></p><p>To your surprise, he&rsquo;d popped some popcorn, handed you a bowl, and plopped down on the other couch. &ldquo;Extra butter, no salt,&rdquo; he chimed in, tossing a handful into his mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a real Prince Charming,&rdquo; you laughed, referencing the show as you nibbled on it and continued to watch.</p><p>Without warning a shooting pain ran through your back, and you felt a sudden pressure in your lower abdomen begin to release. Sitting up on the couch brought no relief, and you thought you were going to pass out between the clear liquid that you&rsquo;d noticed on the floor and the amount of sheer pain you were in.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; Steve gasped, leaping from the couch to help you stand up.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t; it hurts too much,&rdquo; you cried, clenching your teeth to keep yourself from screaming.</p><p>&ldquo;Friday, call Tony,&rdquo; he panicked, sifting you into his arms as he carried you to the lab. He was hoping that Tony would be able to keep his promise to you of showing up in ten minutes or less.</p><p>Laying you down on the hospital bed that Tony had installed months ago for this exact occasion, you felt some of the pain begin to subside at the feeling of lying on your back. Sitting up had been a bad decision due to the pain, and you doubted you had the strength to do it again anyways.</p><p>Just then Tony Stark himself came busting through the door in his full Iron Man suit, and you&rsquo;d never been so relieved to see him.</p><p>&ldquo;Capsicle, out,&rdquo; he demanded, pointing his thumb at the door, as he got everything ready for the delivery as quickly as he could.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m staying,&rdquo; Steve argued, standing his ground.</p><p>&ldquo;Then suit up,&rdquo; Tony said, throwing him a blue disposable gown to slip on over his regular clothes. They&rsquo;d both put on a pair of gloves as well before Tony went to inspect the situation.</p><p>&ldquo;Nuh-uh, I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; Steve stopped him, refusing to let him check on the baby.</p><p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t exactly the time for subtlety, Rogers. Either I help her, or you do it yourself,&rdquo; he shot back, noticing how red Steve&rsquo;s face got. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought.&rdquo; Tony said, flatly, before urging you to push.</p><p>The amount of pain you were in made you want to scream at the top of your lungs. It felt like every bone inside your body was breaking, and you&rsquo;d silently regretted ever getting yourself into this situation. You&rsquo;d be damned to ever consider doing it again.</p><p>It went on for hours. The loud sobbing, pushing over and over again until you felt like you just couldn&rsquo;t do it anymore. It was pure agony, but Tony and Steve were doing their best to help you through it. When Natasha finally got there with Clint and Banner, Steve stepped out to tell them how you were doing.</p><p>You were shaking as Tony promised you that this would be the last one, and you felt almost all of the pain release and subside. He lifted the baby into your arms and let him rest against your heaving chest as you tried to catch your breath.</p><p>&ldquo;Congratulations; what&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo; Tony asked, relishing in the moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Christopher Grant,&rdquo; you explained pressing your cheek, gently, to your son&rsquo;s forehead. There was no hiding the tears that had welled up in your eyes. He may have been small, and underweight, but he was still the perfect baby.</p><p>Tony stepped out to talk to the others, and Steve came back in. His breath caught in his throat, and his eyes grew damp at the sight of you holding his baby boy. There wasn&rsquo;t a doubt in his mind that you were going to be an amazing mother. </p><p>Coming closer he began to notice the uncanny resemblance that the child had to him. The: dirty blonde hair, full lips, larger nose, and bright blue eyes, were all tell tale signs that he was the father. This baby was the spitting image of his daddy, and he couldn&rsquo;t be more proud.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you wanna hold him?&rdquo; The question hung in the air after you&rsquo;d asked it, but, soon enough, he came a little closer and held out his arms. He swayed back and forth, rubbing the pad of his thumb across his son&rsquo;s cheek and feeling something wash over him that he had never felt before. It felt like peace; like no matter what happened from here on out he would always be happy.</p><p>&ldquo;He looks just like you,&rdquo; you smiled, feeling your cheeks start to burn.</p><p>Your calm surrounding had been short lived, though, as everyone came barging into the room yelling their congratulations.</p><p>&ldquo;Aw! No fair! I wanted to be the first one to hold him!&rdquo; Natasha whimpered, starting to pout like a child who didn&rsquo;t get their way.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;re making him the godfather? I mean, Steve wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do with a kid even if he had one,&rdquo; Banner said and you choked out a laugh in response.</p><p>&ldquo;Natasha, you&rsquo;re the godmother, and Tony&hellip;&rdquo; you bit down on your lip, hoping he would say yes. &ldquo;Would you consider being Christopher&rsquo;s godfather?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d never ask,&rdquo; Tony smirked, placing his hand over where his heart should be as he pretended to get flustered.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah, cause that&rsquo;s gonna turn out great,&rdquo; Clint quipped sarcastically as he let out a small laugh, shaking his head.</p><p>&ldquo;On the bright side, that kid is gonna get some pretty damn good presents,&rdquo; Banner said, weighing the idea in his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Right, <i>about that</i>, Natasha, I hope you don&rsquo;t mind?

It really is Sebastian.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s looking down at his shoes, so I can\u2019t get a good look at his face; his hair\u2019s a mess from what little I can see.</p><p>Stumbling back a step, I clear my throat; I have no idea what to do.\u00a0</p><p>I haven\u2019t thought about Sebastian in a long time. Last time I saw him, he broke my heart all over again.</p><p>\u201cEr.. Y/n\u2019s not home right now. Please leave a message,\u201d I say out of panic, instantly face-palming myself.<br/></p><p>An all too familiar chuckle sounds from behind the door. I can hear him place his hand on the door.\u00a0\u201cY/n,\u201d he begins.\u00a0\u201cI need to talk to you. Don\u2019t make me stand out here and say it all. Let me in, let me say what I need to say, and if you still want me gone after that, I\u2019ll leave.\u201d His voice weavers as he speaks through the door.</p><p>I take a deep breath, reaching for the door handle. Part of me doesn\u2019t want to listen to him, to ask him to leave without letting him say anything. But the other part of me opens the door. Sebastian looks up, his eyes red and puffy from crying, yet filled with hope.</p><p>I keep a straight face as I look him in the eye.\u00a0\u201cWhat do you want, Sebastian,\u201d I say.\u00a0\u201cAre you here to break my heart a third time over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d a pained expression plays across his face.\u00a0\u201cNo, no. The opposite actually. Please, just &ndash; can I come in? I need to talk to you.\u201d<br/></p><p>I step back from the door, take a deep breath, and sigh.\u00a0\u201cNo,\u201d I say weakly, reaching for the door again. I go to slam it shut, but it just bounces back open. Confused, I look down at the floor. His foot is in the way of the door closing. He pushes the door all the way open again.</p><p>\u201cNice try, doll,\u201d he says. He takes a step in, and out of fear, I step aside. He walks into the apartment and looks around.\u00a0\u201cNice place you\u2019ve got here; how do you afford it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew job,\u201d I say simply.\u00a0\u201cWhy the hell are you here, Sebastian? Why aren\u2019t you with your wife?\u201d I decide to act like I didn\u2019t just read the title of that article.</p><p>\u201cShe left me,\u201d he looks down at the ground again, having lost his cockiness.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOh, you poor thing,\u201d I say sarcastically.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not going to be your backup plan, Sebastian. I\u2019ll just fall for you again, and you\u2019ll rip my heart out <i>again.\u201d</i><br/></p><p>\u201cY/n, just let me explain myself, please,\u201d he pleads.\u00a0<br/></p><p>I remain silent with my arms crossed over my chest.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe left me because I was comparing her&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cTo?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou. She realized before I did that I\u2019m not over you, that my reason to leave you was stupid.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou mean when you said\u00a0\u2018<i>I\u2019m not in love with you anymore, Y/n. I\u2019m sorry\u2019?\u201d </i>I began to raise my voice. I didn\u2019t notice I was crying until a hot tear hit my chest.\u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t just come in here and expect me to let you back into my life!\u00a0\u2018<i>I don\u2019t love you and I never want to see your face again.\u2019 </i>Remember when you said that? You broke me, Sebastian. <i>Twice</i>. It was a game to you.\u201d The tears kept flowing.\u00a0\u201cYou broke up with me because you wanted to play your game with someone new.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI broke up with you because you\u2019re too good for me, Y/n. You deserve better than me.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOh, so you thought your new toy was better than me, but she wasn\u2019t actually. I\u2019m the only person who really knows you, Sebastian. That\u2019s a bullshit reason to leave someone.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>At this point, I was sobbing. I try to turn around, so he doesn\u2019t see me like this, but he grabs my shoulders and holds me in place.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Calm down,\u201d he says softly.<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me to calm down after all you\u2019ve done!\u201d I yell in his face.\u00a0\u201cYou have no right.\u201d I try to wiggle out of his arms, but his grasp is too strong.<br/></p><p>\u201cI love you, Y/n.\u201d he exclaims.\u00a0\u201cI always have, and I always will.\u201d<br/></p><p>Before I know what happens, he\u2019s leaning in, but stops at the sound of a sharp smack. My hand burns. Sebastian grabs his now red cheek, letting go of my shoulders astounded by my action. I was astounded by myself.\u00a0</p><p>His focus moves from my face to somewhere behind me, and his eyes go wide.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cChris?\u201d he murmurs, hurt taking over his soft features.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d I hear from behind me.\u00a0<br/></p><p>I spin around. My boyfriend, Chris, who happens to be Sebastian\u2019s friend, is standing there shocked. His expression is full of confusion. I can feel my cheeks burn red as I notice, he\u2019s only wearing his boxers, and his hair is wet. Chris had just gotten back from the gym not too long ago, and we had planned a movie night in, so he showered once he came back to our shared apartment.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Chris\u2019 voice is stern, protective.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Sebastian says, and out of the corner of my eye, I can see him adjust his posture to stand up straighter.\u00a0<br/></p><p>I\u2019m left speechless, frozen in place</p><p>Chris walks with few long strides until he is standing between Sebastian and I.\u00a0\u201cIf you ever touch my girlfriend again, I will hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian hesitates a moment.\u00a0\u201cHow long?\u201d He asks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean <i>how long</i>?\u201d Chris asks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been dating?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cA year,\u201d I squeak from my position cowering behind Chris.\u00a0\u201cThat night you told me you never wanted to see me again, I was walking home, sobbing, Sebastian. That really hurt me. Chris found me walking home. He showed me what it\u2019s like to really be loved.\u201d<br/></p><p>Sebastian scoffs.\u00a0\u201cI showed you love, Y/n.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy leaving me because you don\u2019t? That\u2019s a real great way to show it.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI loved you first, and I want you back.\u201d Sebastian is looking around Chris and at me.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou should leave now,\u201d Chris says, turning Sebastian towards the door.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cShe belongs with me, Chris!\u201d Sebastian yells, turning back towards Chris and shoving him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Chris pulls his hand back, then connects it with Sebastian\u2019s jaw.\u00a0</p><p>Sebastian falls to the ground, grasping his jaw. He stumbles back wards and to his feet. He shakes his head, a tear falling from his eye. Sniffling, he opens the door and storms out.\u00a0</p><p>Chris turns around, facing me. He looks at me with eyes full of hurt. His head lowers as he shoves past me, our shoulders colliding.\u00a0</p><p>I let out a sob as the bedroom door slams shut and fall to the floor. I may have just lost the one who really loves you because Sebastian thinks he can play these games.\u00a0</p><p>I have to try and talk to Chris about this. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll definitely lose him, but there\u2019s a chance I won\u2019t if I talk to him. I stand up from the floor, collecting myself and heading into the bedroom. I carefully open the door, trying not to make much sound.\u00a0</p><p>Chris is pulling his pants on and a shirt over his head. He sits on the edge of the bed\u00a0 when he notices I\u2019ve entered the room. He looks me dead in the eyes, then looks back down, putting on his shoes. His eyes were moist and full of hurt.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cChris?\u201d I almost whisper.\u00a0<br/></p><p>He says nothing as he laces up his last shoe.</p><p>\u201cChris, baby, please. Talk to me.\u201d<br/></p><p>He stands up from the bed and walks towards the door behind me. He stops in front of me and looks me in the eyes once more. There was something more in his, something other than hurt, but I couldn\u2019t quite put my finger on it. He reaches his hand up and cups my face, wiping a tear away with his thumb.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going out,\u201d he gulps, his voice almost monotone.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t wait up.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d<br/></p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything else as he pushes past me. The sobs come back, raking through my body.\u00a0\u201cChris?!\u201d I cry.\u00a0</p><p>In response I hear the front door open, but it doesn\u2019t close immediately. I fall to the floor again, against the side of the bed, looking out the open bedroom door, and sob. I can\u2019t lose Chris.\u00a0</p><p>After a moment, the front door slams so hard that it rattles the apartment. I take deep breaths, trying to calm down, telling myself that everything will be okay. But as I do, the thought of it never being okay won\u2019t leave my mind. The sobs won\u2019t stop.\u00a0</p><p>I stand from the floor once more, crawling onto the bed. I grab Chris\u2019 pillow off his side of the bed and hug it, inhaling the familiar scent that I love so much.\u00a0</p><p>After who knows how long, my eyes are heavy and dried out\u00a0from crying, and I have no motivation to move. I let my eyes fall shut and I fall asleep, on top of the covers and still in my clothes.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>The front door slams shut for the third time tonight, making me jump out of my not-so-peaceful slumber. I had been so upset from the nights previous events that I didn\u2019t dream at all, or at least not one that I could remember.\u00a0</p><p>I look over in the bed next to me; Chris wasn\u2019t there. That must be him coming home now. Realizing that I was still cuddling his pillow, I throw it back on his side of the bed and roll over, pretending to be asleep.\u00a0</p><p>The bedroom door opens and faint light floods the room. I expect to feel the bed shift next to me, but it doesn\u2019t. There\u2019s a rustling sound, some footsteps, and then the bedroom door closing. Rolling over to Chris\u2019 side, I see he\u2019s taken his pillow and a throw blanket from the basket by the bed. He must be sleeping on the couch.\u00a0</p><p>I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve done wrong. I denied Sebastian didn\u2019t I? Was Chris just jealous? I begin to cry again. I can\u2019t seem to stop crying tonight. I don\u2019t try to hide the sounds of the sobs; Chris should know what his silent treatment is doing to me.\u00a0</p><p>An idea hits me, one that may fix this whole thing. I grab my phone from the bedside table. It\u2019s 2:24 AM and the brightness of the screen momentarily blinds me. I go to my text messages and create a new chat with Sebastian.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018<i>Meet me at the coffee house. 6:30 AM.\u2019</i>\u00a0<br/></p><p>Sending the text, I realize he may be asleep, he may not wake up until later.\u00a0</p><p>But then my phone dings.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018<i>It\u2019s a date\u2019</i></p><p>I roll my eyes and type out the last message I\u2019m willing to send.</p><p>\u2018<i>No it\u2019s not\u2019</i><br/></p><p>I put the phone back down on the night stand and roll onto my back. I want to cry some more, but nothing comes out. Instead I just stare at the ceiling until I fall back asleep.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>I jolt awake at the loud blaring of the alarm on my phone. My head is pounding from the headache. I groan and throw my feet over the edge of the bed, rubbing my head. Remembering what I texted Sebastian last night, I roll my eyes at myself. It\u2019s never safe for me to have social interactions when I\u2019m half asleep.\u00a0</p><p>The only motivation that pulls me from the bed is the headache I have. I walk into the bathroom and take some Aspirin before getting ready for work.</p><p>Looking in the mirror one last time, I smooth out my jeans and pull on my sneakers. I take a deep breath before leaving the bedroom, seeing Chris still asleep on the couch. I hold back the tears that threaten my eyes, not wanting to wake him, or ruin my makeup. Quickly, I grab my packed lunch from the fridge and my bag from the hook by the door. I look over my shoulder before I leave, and decide to quietly say goodbye to Chris for the day. I put my things down by the door and walk over to the couch.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I say, kissing his forehead and holding back the tears again.<br/></p><p>He stirs on the couch and groans. I rush out the door, closing it softly, and make my way towards the coffee shop.</p><p>By the time I get to the doors, I\u2019m already 10 minutes late. I enter the shop and look around. Sebastian is already seated at a table in the back corner. I order my drink and wait for my name to be called before heading over the the table.</p><p>\u201cY/n,\u201d the barista calls my name.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Out of the corner of my eye, I see Sebastian lift his head from looking down at his phone. I thank the barista and head over to the table.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have long,\u201d I muttered, pulling out the chair and sitting.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cY/n, I -\u201d Sebastian begins but I cut him off before he can continue.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cSebastian,\u201d I say, looking into his steel blue eyes. They\u2019re still bloodshot and puffy, and dark bags have appeared under his eyes.\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t let you talk, I\u2019m sorry. Anything you say, you\u2019ll just be trying to real me back in. I can\u2019t let you back into my life. I was perfectly happy before yesterday. I hadn\u2019t thought about you in a very long time.\u00a0You said you left me because I deserve better than you, and you\u2019re right. I know I may be what you want right now, but I won\u2019t let you continue to break me. Chris makes me happy; he really loves me. He trusts me. He\u2019s always there for me and encouraging me. I can\u2019t be with you, Sebastian. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>With having said what I need to say, I stand up from the chair. I look at Sebastian one last time, and I can tell that I broke his heart. But I can\u2019t think about what he needs in a relationship or in life. I tried to help and support him  years ago, and he broke me. I have to think about what\u2019s right for me, right now, and that\u2019s Chris. I turn around, fighting back more tears and begin to talk out of the coffee shop. A chair scrapes against the floor and a strong hand grabs my wrists.\u00a0</p><p>I stop, but I don\u2019t turn around.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/n, please,\u201d Sebastian croaks.\u00a0\u201cPlease, give me another shot.\u201d<br/></p><p>I don\u2019t say anything, but instead pull my wrist from his grip and walk out.</p><p><br/></p><p>Part 2? where the reader and chris make up? don\u2019t want to leave you hanging there but this is long enough as it is.</p>",

Its me, Sebastian.\u201d\n\n<br></p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cUhhh\u2026\u201d I stand on my toes to come eye level with the door\u2019s peep whole. It really is Sebastian.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s looking down at his shoes, so I can\u2019t get a good look at his face; his hair\u2019s a mess from what little I can see.</p><p>Stumbling back a step, I clear my throat; I have no idea what to do.\u00a0</p><p>I haven\u2019t thought about Sebastian in a long time. Last time I saw him, he broke my heart all over again.</p><p>\u201cEr.. Y/n\u2019s not home right now. Please leave a message,\u201d I say out of panic, instantly face-palming myself.<br></p><p>An all too familiar chuckle sounds from behind the door. I can hear him place his hand on the door.\u00a0\u201cY/n,\u201d he begins.\u00a0\u201cI need to talk to you. Don\u2019t make me stand out here and say it all. Let me in, let me say what I need to say, and if you still want me gone after that, I\u2019ll leave.\u201d His voice weavers as he speaks through the door.</p><p>I take a deep breath, reaching for the door handle. Part of me doesn\u2019t want to listen to him, to ask him to leave without letting him say anything. But the other part of me opens the door. Sebastian looks up, his eyes red and puffy from crying, yet filled with hope.</p><p>I keep a straight face as I look him in the eye.\u00a0\u201cWhat do you want, Sebastian,\u201d I say.\u00a0\u201cAre you here to break my heart a third time over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d a pained expression plays across his face.\u00a0\u201cNo, no. The opposite actually. Please, just \u2013 can I come in? I need to talk to you.\u201d<br></p><p>I step back from the door, take a deep breath, and sigh.\u00a0\u201cNo,\u201d I say weakly, reaching for the door again. I go to slam it shut, but it just bounces back open. Confused, I look down at the floor. His foot is in the way of the door closing. He pushes the door all the way open again.</p><p>\u201cNice try, doll,\u201d he says. He takes a step in, and out of fear, I step aside. He walks into the apartment and looks around.\u00a0\u201cNice place you\u2019ve got here; how do you afford it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew job,\u201d I say simply.\u00a0\u201cWhy the hell are you here, Sebastian? Why aren\u2019t you with your wife?\u201d I decide to act like I didn\u2019t just read the title of that article.</p><p>\u201cShe left me,\u201d he looks down at the ground again, having lost his cockiness.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh, you poor thing,\u201d I say sarcastically.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not going to be your backup plan, Sebastian. I\u2019ll just fall for you again, and you\u2019ll rip my heart out <i>again.\u201d</i><br></p><p>\u201cY/n, just let me explain myself, please,\u201d he pleads.\u00a0<br></p><p>I remain silent with my arms crossed over my chest.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe left me because I was comparing her\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cTo?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou. She realized before I did that I\u2019m not over you, that my reason to leave you was stupid.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou mean when you said\u00a0\u2018<i>I\u2019m not in love with you anymore, Y/n. I\u2019m sorry\u2019?\u201d </i>I began to raise my voice. I didn\u2019t notice I was crying until a hot tear hit my chest.\u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t just come in here and expect me to let you back into my life!\u00a0\u2018<i>I don\u2019t love you and I never want to see your face again.\u2019 </i>Remember when you said that? You broke me, Sebastian. <i>Twice</i>. It was a game to you.\u201d The tears kept flowing.\u00a0\u201cYou broke up with me because you wanted to play your game with someone new.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI broke up with you because you\u2019re too good for me, Y/n. You deserve better than me.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh, so you thought your new toy was better than me, but she wasn\u2019t actually. I\u2019m the only person who really knows you, Sebastian. That\u2019s a bullshit reason to leave someone.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>At this point, I was sobbing. I try to turn around, so he doesn\u2019t see me like this, but he grabs my shoulders and holds me in place.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d he says softly.<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me to calm down after all you\u2019ve done!\u201d I yell in his face.\u00a0\u201cYou have no right.\u201d I try to wiggle out of his arms, but his grasp is too strong.<br></p><p>\u201cI love you, Y/n.\u201d he exclaims.\u00a0\u201cI always have, and I always will.\u201d<br></p><p>Before I know what happens, he\u2019s leaning in, but stops at the sound of a sharp smack. My hand burns. Sebastian grabs his now red cheek, letting go of my shoulders astounded by my action. I was astounded by myself.\u00a0</p><p>His focus moves from my face to somewhere behind me, and his eyes go wide.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cChris?\u201d he murmurs, hurt taking over his soft features.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d I hear from behind me.\u00a0<br></p><p>I spin around. My boyfriend, Chris, who happens to be Sebastian\u2019s friend, is standing there shocked. His expression is full of confusion. I can feel my cheeks burn red as I notice, he\u2019s only wearing his boxers, and his hair is wet. Chris had just gotten back from the gym not too long ago, and we had planned a movie night in, so he showered once he came back to our shared apartment.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Chris\u2019 voice is stern, protective.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Sebastian says, and out of the corner of my eye, I can see him adjust his posture to stand up straighter.\u00a0<br></p><p>I\u2019m left speechless, frozen in place</p><p>Chris walks with few long strides until he is standing between Sebastian and I.\u00a0\u201cIf you ever touch my girlfriend again, I will hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian hesitates a moment.\u00a0\u201cHow long?\u201d He asks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean <i>how long</i>?\u201d Chris asks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been dating?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cA year,\u201d I squeak from my position cowering behind Chris.\u00a0\u201cThat night you told me you never wanted to see me again, I was walking home, sobbing, Sebastian. That really hurt me. Chris found me walking home. He showed me what it\u2019s like to really be loved.\u201d<br></p><p>Sebastian scoffs.\u00a0\u201cI showed you love, Y/n.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy leaving me because you don\u2019t? That\u2019s a real great way to show it.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI loved you first, and I want you back.\u201d Sebastian is looking around Chris and at me.<br></p><p>\u201cYou should leave now,\u201d Chris says, turning Sebastian towards the door.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cShe belongs with me, Chris!\u201d Sebastian yells, turning back towards Chris and shoving him.\u00a0<br></p><p>Chris pulls his hand back, then connects it with Sebastian\u2019s jaw.\u00a0</p><p>Sebastian falls to the ground, grasping his jaw. He stumbles back wards and to his feet. He shakes his head, a tear falling from his eye. Sniffling, he opens the door and storms out.\u00a0</p><p>Chris turns around, facing me. He looks at me with eyes full of hurt. His head lowers as he shoves past me, our shoulders colliding.\u00a0</p><p>I let out a sob as the bedroom door slams shut and fall to the floor. I may have just lost the one who really loves you because Sebastian thinks he can play these games.\u00a0</p><p>I have to try and talk to Chris about this. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll definitely lose him, but there\u2019s a chance I won\u2019t if I talk to him. I stand up from the floor, collecting myself and heading into the bedroom. I carefully open the door, trying not to make much sound.\u00a0</p><p>Chris is pulling his pants on and a shirt over his head. He sits on the edge of the bed\u00a0 when he notices I\u2019ve entered the room. He looks me dead in the eyes, then looks back down, putting on his shoes. His eyes were moist and full of hurt.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cChris?\u201d I almost whisper.\u00a0<br></p><p>He says nothing as he laces up his last shoe.</p><p>\u201cChris, baby, please. Talk to me.\u201d<br></p><p>He stands up from the bed and walks towards the door behind me. He stops in front of me and looks me in the eyes once more. There was something more in his, something other than hurt, but I couldn\u2019t quite put my finger on it. He reaches his hand up and cups my face, wiping a tear away with his thumb.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going out,\u201d he gulps, his voice almost monotone.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t wait up.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d<br></p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything else as he pushes past me. The sobs come back, raking through my body.\u00a0\u201cChris?!\u201d I cry.\u00a0</p><p>In response I hear the front door open, but it doesn\u2019t close immediately. I fall to the floor again, against the side of the bed, looking out the open bedroom door, and sob. I can\u2019t lose Chris.\u00a0</p><p>After a moment, the front door slams so hard that it rattles the apartment. I take deep breaths, trying to calm down, telling myself that everything will be okay.

I look at Sebastian one last time, and I can tell that I broke his heart. But I can\u2019t think about what he needs in a relationship or in life. I tried to help and support him  years ago, and he broke me. I have to think about what\u2019s right for me, right now, and that\u2019s Chris. I turn around, fighting back more tears and begin to talk out of the coffee shop. A chair scrapes against the floor and a strong hand grabs my wrists.\u00a0</p><p>I stop, but I don\u2019t turn around.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/n, please,\u201d Sebastian croaks.\u00a0\u201cPlease, give me another shot.\u201d<br></p><p>I don\u2019t say anything, but instead pull my wrist from his grip and walk out.</p><p><br></p><p>Part 2? where the reader and chris make up? don\u2019t want to leave you hanging there but this is long enough as it is.</p></p>",

It really is Sebastian.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s looking down at his shoes, so I can\u2019t get a good look at his face; his hair\u2019s a mess from what little I can see.</p><p>Stumbling back a step, I clear my throat; I have no idea what to do.\u00a0</p><p>I haven\u2019t thought about Sebastian in a long time. Last time I saw him, he broke my heart all over again.</p><p>\u201cEr.. Y/n\u2019s not home right now. Please leave a message,\u201d I say out of panic, instantly face-palming myself.<br></p><p>An all too familiar chuckle sounds from behind the door. I can hear him place his hand on the door.\u00a0\u201cY/n,\u201d he begins.\u00a0\u201cI need to talk to you. Don\u2019t make me stand out here and say it all. Let me in, let me say what I need to say, and if you still want me gone after that, I\u2019ll leave.\u201d His voice weavers as he speaks through the door.</p><p>I take a deep breath, reaching for the door handle. Part of me doesn\u2019t want to listen to him, to ask him to leave without letting him say anything. But the other part of me opens the door. Sebastian looks up, his eyes red and puffy from crying, yet filled with hope.</p><p>I keep a straight face as I look him in the eye.\u00a0\u201cWhat do you want, Sebastian,\u201d I say.\u00a0\u201cAre you here to break my heart a third time over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d a pained expression plays across his face.\u00a0\u201cNo, no. The opposite actually. Please, just \u2013 can I come in? I need to talk to you.\u201d<br></p><p>I step back from the door, take a deep breath, and sigh.\u00a0\u201cNo,\u201d I say weakly, reaching for the door again. I go to slam it shut, but it just bounces back open. Confused, I look down at the floor. His foot is in the way of the door closing. He pushes the door all the way open again.</p><p>\u201cNice try, doll,\u201d he says. He takes a step in, and out of fear, I step aside. He walks into the apartment and looks around.\u00a0\u201cNice place you\u2019ve got here; how do you afford it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew job,\u201d I say simply.\u00a0\u201cWhy the hell are you here, Sebastian? Why aren\u2019t you with your wife?\u201d I decide to act like I didn\u2019t just read the title of that article.</p><p>\u201cShe left me,\u201d he looks down at the ground again, having lost his cockiness.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh, you poor thing,\u201d I say sarcastically.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not going to be your backup plan, Sebastian. I\u2019ll just fall for you again, and you\u2019ll rip my heart out <i>again.\u201d</i><br></p><p>\u201cY/n, just let me explain myself, please,\u201d he pleads.\u00a0<br></p><p>I remain silent with my arms crossed over my chest.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe left me because I was comparing her\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cTo?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou. She realized before I did that I\u2019m not over you, that my reason to leave you was stupid.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou mean when you said\u00a0\u2018<i>I\u2019m not in love with you anymore, Y/n. I\u2019m sorry\u2019?\u201d </i>I began to raise my voice. I didn\u2019t notice I was crying until a hot tear hit my chest.\u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t just come in here and expect me to let you back into my life!\u00a0\u2018<i>I don\u2019t love you and I never want to see your face again.\u2019 </i>Remember when you said that? You broke me, Sebastian. <i>Twice</i>. It was a game to you.\u201d The tears kept flowing.\u00a0\u201cYou broke up with me because you wanted to play your game with someone new.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI broke up with you because you\u2019re too good for me, Y/n. You deserve better than me.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh, so you thought your new toy was better than me, but she wasn\u2019t actually. I\u2019m the only person who really knows you, Sebastian. That\u2019s a bullshit reason to leave someone.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>At this point, I was sobbing. I try to turn around, so he doesn\u2019t see me like this, but he grabs my shoulders and holds me in place.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d he says softly.<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me to calm down after all you\u2019ve done!\u201d I yell in his face.\u00a0\u201cYou have no right.\u201d I try to wiggle out of his arms, but his grasp is too strong.<br></p><p>\u201cI love you, Y/n.\u201d he exclaims.\u00a0\u201cI always have, and I always will.\u201d<br></p><p>Before I know what happens, he\u2019s leaning in, but stops at the sound of a sharp smack. My hand burns. Sebastian grabs his now red cheek, letting go of my shoulders astounded by my action. I was astounded by myself.\u00a0</p><p>His focus moves from my face to somewhere behind me, and his eyes go wide.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cChris?\u201d he murmurs, hurt taking over his soft features.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d I hear from behind me.\u00a0<br></p><p>I spin around. My boyfriend, Chris, who happens to be Sebastian\u2019s friend, is standing there shocked. His expression is full of confusion. I can feel my cheeks burn red as I notice, he\u2019s only wearing his boxers, and his hair is wet. Chris had just gotten back from the gym not too long ago, and we had planned a movie night in, so he showered once he came back to our shared apartment.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Chris\u2019 voice is stern, protective.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Sebastian says, and out of the corner of my eye, I can see him adjust his posture to stand up straighter.\u00a0<br></p><p>I\u2019m left speechless, frozen in place</p><p>Chris walks with few long strides until he is standing between Sebastian and I.\u00a0\u201cIf you ever touch my girlfriend again, I will hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian hesitates a moment.\u00a0\u201cHow long?\u201d He asks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean <i>how long</i>?\u201d Chris asks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been dating?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cA year,\u201d I squeak from my position cowering behind Chris.\u00a0\u201cThat night you told me you never wanted to see me again, I was walking home, sobbing, Sebastian. That really hurt me. Chris found me walking home. He showed me what it\u2019s like to really be loved.\u201d<br></p><p>Sebastian scoffs.\u00a0\u201cI showed you love, Y/n.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy leaving me because you don\u2019t? That\u2019s a real great way to show it.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI loved you first, and I want you back.\u201d Sebastian is looking around Chris and at me.<br></p><p>\u201cYou should leave now,\u201d Chris says, turning Sebastian towards the door.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cShe belongs with me, Chris!\u201d Sebastian yells, turning back towards Chris and shoving him.\u00a0<br></p><p>Chris pulls his hand back, then connects it with Sebastian\u2019s jaw.\u00a0</p><p>Sebastian falls to the ground, grasping his jaw. He stumbles back wards and to his feet. He shakes his head, a tear falling from his eye. Sniffling, he opens the door and storms out.\u00a0</p><p>Chris turns around, facing me. He looks at me with eyes full of hurt. His head lowers as he shoves past me, our shoulders colliding.\u00a0</p><p>I let out a sob as the bedroom door slams shut and fall to the floor. I may have just lost the one who really loves you because Sebastian thinks he can play these games.\u00a0</p><p>I have to try and talk to Chris about this. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll definitely lose him, but there\u2019s a chance I won\u2019t if I talk to him. I stand up from the floor, collecting myself and heading into the bedroom. I carefully open the door, trying not to make much sound.\u00a0</p><p>Chris is pulling his pants on and a shirt over his head. He sits on the edge of the bed\u00a0 when he notices I\u2019ve entered the room. He looks me dead in the eyes, then looks back down, putting on his shoes. His eyes were moist and full of hurt.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cChris?\u201d I almost whisper.\u00a0<br></p><p>He says nothing as he laces up his last shoe.</p><p>\u201cChris, baby, please. Talk to me.\u201d<br></p><p>He stands up from the bed and walks towards the door behind me. He stops in front of me and looks me in the eyes once more. There was something more in his, something other than hurt, but I couldn\u2019t quite put my finger on it. He reaches his hand up and cups my face, wiping a tear away with his thumb.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going out,\u201d he gulps, his voice almost monotone.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t wait up.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d<br></p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything else as he pushes past me. The sobs come back, raking through my body.\u00a0\u201cChris?!\u201d I cry.\u00a0</p><p>In response I hear the front door open, but it doesn\u2019t close immediately. I fall to the floor again, against the side of the bed, looking out the open bedroom door, and sob. I can\u2019t lose Chris.\u00a0</p><p>After a moment, the front door slams so hard that it rattles the apartment. I take deep breaths, trying to calm down, telling myself that everything will be okay. But as I do, the thought of it never being okay won\u2019t leave my mind. The sobs won\u2019t stop.\u00a0</p><p>I stand from the floor once more, crawling onto the bed. I grab Chris\u2019 pillow off his side of the bed and hug it, inhaling the familiar scent that I love so much.\u00a0</p><p>After who knows how long, my eyes are heavy and dried out\u00a0from crying, and I have no motivation to move. I let my eyes fall shut and I fall asleep, on top of the covers and still in my clothes.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>The front door slams shut for the third time tonight, making me jump out of my not-so-peaceful slumber. I had been so upset from the nights previous events that I didn\u2019t dream at all, or at least not one that I could remember.\u00a0</p><p>I look over in the bed next to me; Chris wasn\u2019t there. That must be him coming home now. Realizing that I was still cuddling his pillow, I throw it back on his side of the bed and roll over, pretending to be asleep.\u00a0</p><p>The bedroom door opens and faint light floods the room. I expect to feel the bed shift next to me, but it doesn\u2019t. There\u2019s a rustling sound, some footsteps, and then the bedroom door closing. Rolling over to Chris\u2019 side, I see he\u2019s taken his pillow and a throw blanket from the basket by the bed. He must be sleeping on the couch.\u00a0</p><p>I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve done wrong. I denied Sebastian didn\u2019t I? Was Chris just jealous? I begin to cry again. I can\u2019t seem to stop crying tonight. I don\u2019t try to hide the sounds of the sobs; Chris should know what his silent treatment is doing to me.\u00a0</p><p>An idea hits me, one that may fix this whole thing. I grab my phone from the bedside table. It\u2019s 2:24 AM and the brightness of the screen momentarily blinds me. I go to my text messages and create a new chat with Sebastian.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018<i>Meet me at the coffee house. 6:30 AM.\u2019</i>\u00a0<br></p><p>Sending the text, I realize he may be asleep, he may not wake up until later.\u00a0</p><p>But then my phone dings.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018<i>It\u2019s a date\u2019</i></p><p>I roll my eyes and type out the last message I\u2019m willing to send.</p><p>\u2018<i>No it\u2019s not\u2019</i><br></p><p>I put the phone back down on the night stand and roll onto my back. I want to cry some more, but nothing comes out. Instead I just stare at the ceiling until I fall back asleep.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>I jolt awake at the loud blaring of the alarm on my phone. My head is pounding from the headache. I groan and throw my feet over the edge of the bed, rubbing my head. Remembering what I texted Sebastian last night, I roll my eyes at myself. It\u2019s never safe for me to have social interactions when I\u2019m half asleep.\u00a0</p><p>The only motivation that pulls me from the bed is the headache I have. I walk into the bathroom and take some Aspirin before getting ready for work.</p><p>Looking in the mirror one last time, I smooth out my jeans and pull on my sneakers. I take a deep breath before leaving the bedroom, seeing Chris still asleep on the couch. I hold back the tears that threaten my eyes, not wanting to wake him, or ruin my makeup. Quickly, I grab my packed lunch from the fridge and my bag from the hook by the door. I look over my shoulder before I leave, and decide to quietly say goodbye to Chris for the day. I put my things down by the door and walk over to the couch.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I say, kissing his forehead and holding back the tears again.<br></p><p>He stirs on the couch and groans. I rush out the door, closing it softly, and make my way towards the coffee shop.</p><p>By the time I get to the doors, I\u2019m already 10 minutes late. I enter the shop and look around. Sebastian is already seated at a table in the back corner. I order my drink and wait for my name to be called before heading over the the table.</p><p>\u201cY/n,\u201d the barista calls my name.\u00a0<br></p><p>Out of the corner of my eye, I see Sebastian lift his head from looking down at his phone. I thank the barista and head over to the table.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have long,\u201d I muttered, pulling out the chair and sitting.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cY/n, I -\u201d Sebastian begins but I cut him off before he can continue.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSebastian,\u201d I say, looking into his steel blue eyes. They\u2019re still bloodshot and puffy, and dark bags have appeared under his eyes.\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t let you talk, I\u2019m sorry. Anything you say, you\u2019ll just be trying to real me back in. I can\u2019t let you back into my life. I was perfectly happy before yesterday. I hadn\u2019t thought about you in a very long time.\u00a0You said you left me because I deserve better than you, and you\u2019re right. I know I may be what you want right now, but I won\u2019t let you continue to break me. Chris makes me happy; he really loves me. He trusts me. He\u2019s always there for me and encouraging me. I can\u2019t be with you, Sebastian. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>With having said what I need to say, I stand up from the chair. I look at Sebastian one last time, and I can tell that I broke his heart. But I can\u2019t think about what he needs in a relationship or in life. I tried to help and support him  years ago, and he broke me. I have to think about what\u2019s right for me, right now, and that\u2019s Chris. I turn around, fighting back more tears and begin to talk out of the coffee shop. A chair scrapes against the floor and a strong hand grabs my wrists.\u00a0</p><p>I stop, but I don\u2019t turn around.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/n, please,\u201d Sebastian croaks.\u00a0\u201cPlease, give me another shot.\u201d<br></p><p>I don\u2019t say anything, but instead pull my wrist from his grip and walk out.</p><p><br></p><p>Part 2? where the reader and chris make up? don\u2019t want to leave you hanging there but this is long enough as it is.</p></p>",

Why aren&rsquo;t you with your wife?&rdquo; I decide to act like I didn&rsquo;t just read the title of that article.</p><p>&ldquo;She left me,&rdquo; he looks down at the ground again, having lost his cockiness.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you poor thing,&rdquo; I say sarcastically.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to be your backup plan, Sebastian. I&rsquo;ll just fall for you again, and you&rsquo;ll rip my heart out <i>again.&rdquo;</i><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Y/n, just let me explain myself, please,&rdquo; he pleads.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>I remain silent with my arms crossed over my chest.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;She left me because I was comparing her&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;To?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You. She realized before I did that I&rsquo;m not over you, that my reason to leave you was stupid.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You mean when you said&nbsp;&lsquo;<i>I&rsquo;m not in love with you anymore, Y/n. I&rsquo;m sorry&rsquo;?&rdquo; </i>I began to raise my voice. I didn&rsquo;t notice I was crying until a hot tear hit my chest.&nbsp;&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just come in here and expect me to let you back into my life!&nbsp;&lsquo;<i>I don&rsquo;t love you and I never want to see your face again.&rsquo; </i>Remember when you said that? You broke me, Sebastian. <i>Twice</i>. It was a game to you.&rdquo; The tears kept flowing.&nbsp;&ldquo;You broke up with me because you wanted to play your game with someone new.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I broke up with you because you&rsquo;re too good for me, Y/n. You deserve better than me.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, so you thought your new toy was better than me, but she wasn&rsquo;t actually. I&rsquo;m the only person who really knows you, Sebastian. That&rsquo;s a bullshit reason to leave someone.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, I was sobbing. I try to turn around, so he doesn&rsquo;t see me like this, but he grabs my shoulders and holds me in place.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Calm down,&rdquo; he says softly.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me to calm down after all you&rsquo;ve done!&rdquo; I yell in his face.&nbsp;&ldquo;You have no right.&rdquo; I try to wiggle out of his arms, but his grasp is too strong.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I love you, Y/n.&rdquo; he exclaims.&nbsp;&ldquo;I always have, and I always will.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Before I know what happens, he&rsquo;s leaning in, but stops at the sound of a sharp smack. My hand burns. Sebastian grabs his now red cheek, letting go of my shoulders astounded by my action. I was astounded by myself.&nbsp;</p><p>His focus moves from my face to somewhere behind me, and his eyes go wide.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Chris?&rdquo; he murmurs, hurt taking over his soft features.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo; I hear from behind me.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>I spin around. My boyfriend, Chris, who happens to be Sebastian&rsquo;s friend, is standing there shocked. His expression is full of confusion. I can feel my cheeks burn red as I notice, he&rsquo;s only wearing his boxers, and his hair is wet. Chris had just gotten back from the gym not too long ago, and we had planned a movie night in, so he showered once he came back to our shared apartment.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo; Chris&rsquo; voice is stern, protective.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Sebastian says, and out of the corner of my eye, I can see him adjust his posture to stand up straighter.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>I&rsquo;m left speechless, frozen in place</p><p>Chris walks with few long strides until he is standing between Sebastian and I.&nbsp;&ldquo;If you ever touch my girlfriend again, I will hurt you.&rdquo;</p><p>Sebastian hesitates a moment.&nbsp;&ldquo;How long?&rdquo; He asks.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean <i>how long</i>?&rdquo; Chris asks.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;How long have you been dating?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;A year,&rdquo; I squeak from my position cowering behind Chris.&nbsp;&ldquo;That night you told me you never wanted to see me again, I was walking home, sobbing, Sebastian. That really hurt me. Chris found me walking home. He showed me what it&rsquo;s like to really be loved.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Sebastian scoffs.&nbsp;&ldquo;I showed you love, Y/n.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By leaving me because you don&rsquo;t? That&rsquo;s a real great way to show it.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I loved you first, and I want you back.&rdquo; Sebastian is looking around Chris and at me.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You should leave now,&rdquo; Chris says, turning Sebastian towards the door.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She belongs with me, Chris!&rdquo; Sebastian yells, turning back towards Chris and shoving him.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Chris pulls his hand back, then connects it with Sebastian&rsquo;s jaw.&nbsp;</p><p>Sebastian falls to the ground, grasping his jaw. He stumbles back wards and to his feet. He shakes his head, a tear falling from his eye. Sniffling, he opens the door and storms out.&nbsp;</p><p>Chris turns around, facing me. He looks at me with eyes full of hurt. His head lowers as he shoves past me, our shoulders colliding.&nbsp;</p><p>I let out a sob as the bedroom door slams shut and fall to the floor. I may have just lost the one who really loves you because Sebastian thinks he can play these games.&nbsp;</p><p>I have to try and talk to Chris about this. If I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll definitely lose him, but there&rsquo;s a chance I won&rsquo;t if I talk to him. I stand up from the floor, collecting myself and heading into the bedroom. I carefully open the door, trying not to make much sound.&nbsp;</p><p>Chris is pulling his pants on and a shirt over his head. He sits on the edge of the bed&nbsp; when he notices I&rsquo;ve entered the room. He looks me dead in the eyes, then looks back down, putting on his shoes. His eyes were moist and full of hurt.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Chris?&rdquo; I almost whisper.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He says nothing as he laces up his last shoe.</p><p>&ldquo;Chris, baby, please. Talk to me.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He stands up from the bed and walks towards the door behind me. He stops in front of me and looks me in the eyes once more. There was something more in his, something other than hurt, but I couldn&rsquo;t quite put my finger on it. He reaches his hand up and cups my face, wiping a tear away with his thumb.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out,&rdquo; he gulps, his voice almost monotone.&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wait up.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t say anything else as he pushes past me. The sobs come back, raking through my body.&nbsp;&ldquo;Chris?!&rdquo; I cry.&nbsp;</p><p>In response I hear the front door open, but it doesn&rsquo;t close immediately. I fall to the floor again, against the side of the bed, looking out the open bedroom door, and sob. I can&rsquo;t lose Chris.&nbsp;</p><p>After a moment, the front door slams so hard that it rattles the apartment. I take deep breaths, trying to calm down, telling myself that everything will be okay. But as I do, the thought of it never being okay won&rsquo;t leave my mind. The sobs won&rsquo;t stop.&nbsp;</p><p>I stand from the floor once more, crawling onto the bed. I grab Chris&rsquo; pillow off his side of the bed and hug it, inhaling the familiar scent that I love so much.&nbsp;</p><p>After who knows how long, my eyes are heavy and dried out&nbsp;from crying, and I have no motivation to move. I let my eyes fall shut and I fall asleep, on top of the covers and still in my clothes.&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>The front door slams shut for the third time tonight, making me jump out of my not-so-peaceful slumber. I had been so upset from the nights previous events that I didn&rsquo;t dream at all, or at least not one that I could remember.&nbsp;</p><p>I look over in the bed next to me; Chris wasn&rsquo;t there. That must be him coming home now. Realizing that I was still cuddling his pillow, I throw it back on his side of the bed and roll over, pretending to be asleep.&nbsp;</p><p>The bedroom door opens and faint light floods the room. I expect to feel the bed shift next to me, but it doesn&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s a rustling sound, some footsteps, and then the bedroom door closing. Rolling over to Chris&rsquo; side, I see he&rsquo;s taken his pillow and a throw blanket from the basket by the bed. He must be sleeping on the couch.&nbsp;</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ve done wrong. I denied Sebastian didn&rsquo;t I? Was Chris just jealous? I begin to cry again. I can&rsquo;t seem to stop crying tonight. I don&rsquo;t try to hide the sounds of the sobs; Chris should know what his silent treatment is doing to me.&nbsp;</p><p>An idea hits me, one that may fix this whole thing. I grab my phone from the bedside table. It&rsquo;s 2:24 AM and the brightness of the screen momentarily blinds me. I go to my text messages and create a new chat with Sebastian.&nbsp;</p><p>&lsquo;<i>Meet me at the coffee house. 6:30 AM.&rsquo;</i>&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Sending the text, I realize he may be asleep, he may not wake up until later.&nbsp;</p><p>But then my phone dings.&nbsp;</p><p>&lsquo;<i>It&rsquo;s a date&rsquo;</i></p><p>I roll my eyes and type out the last message I&rsquo;m willing to send.</p><p>&lsquo;<i>No it&rsquo;s not&rsquo;</i><br /></p><p>I put the phone back down on the night stand and roll onto my back. I want to cry some more, but nothing comes out. Instead I just stare at the ceiling until I fall back asleep.&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>I jolt awake at the loud blaring of the alarm on my phone. My head is pounding from the headache. I groan and throw my feet over the edge of the bed, rubbing my head. Remembering what I texted Sebastian last night, I roll my eyes at myself. It&rsquo;s never safe for me to have social interactions when I&rsquo;m half asleep.&nbsp;</p><p>The only motivation that pulls me from the bed is the headache I have. I walk into the bathroom and take some Aspirin before getting ready for work.</p><p>Looking in the mirror one last time, I smooth out my jeans and pull on my sneakers. I take a deep breath before leaving the bedroom, seeing Chris still asleep on the couch. I hold back the tears that threaten my eyes, not wanting to wake him, or ruin my makeup. Quickly, I grab my packed lunch from the fridge and my bag from the hook by the door. I look over my shoulder before I leave, and decide to quietly say goodbye to Chris for the day. I put my things down by the door and walk over to the couch.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; I say, kissing his forehead and holding back the tears again.<br /></p><p>He stirs on the couch and groans. I rush out the door, closing it softly, and make my way towards the coffee shop.</p><p>By the time I get to the doors, I&rsquo;m already 10 minutes late. I enter the shop and look around. Sebastian is already seated at a table in the back corner. I order my drink and wait for my name to be called before heading over the the table.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n,&rdquo; the barista calls my name.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Out of the corner of my eye, I see Sebastian lift his head from looking down at his phone. I thank the barista and head over to the table.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have long,&rdquo; I muttered, pulling out the chair and sitting.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Y/n, I -&rdquo; Sebastian begins but I cut him off before he can continue.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sebastian,&rdquo; I say, looking into his steel blue eyes. They&rsquo;re still bloodshot and puffy, and dark bags have appeared under his eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t let you talk, I&rsquo;m sorry. Anything you say, you&rsquo;ll just be trying to real me back in. I can&rsquo;t let you back into my life. I was perfectly happy before yesterday. I hadn&rsquo;t thought about you in a very long time.&nbsp;You said you left me because I deserve better than you, and you&rsquo;re right. I know I may be what you want right now, but I won&rsquo;t let you continue to break me. Chris makes me happy; he really loves me. He trusts me. He&rsquo;s always there for me and encouraging me. I can&rsquo;t be with you, Sebastian. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>With having said what I need to say, I stand up from the chair. I look at Sebastian one last time, and I can tell that I broke his heart. But I can&rsquo;t think about what he needs in a relationship or in life. I tried to help and support him  years ago, and he broke me. I have to think about what&rsquo;s right for me, right now, and that&rsquo;s Chris. I turn around, fighting back more tears and begin to talk out of the coffee shop. A chair scrapes against the floor and a strong hand grabs my wrists.&nbsp;</p><p>I stop, but I don&rsquo;t turn around.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n, please,&rdquo; Sebastian croaks.&nbsp;&ldquo;Please, give me another shot.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>I don&rsquo;t say anything, but instead pull my wrist from his grip and walk out.</p><p><br /></p><p>Part 2? where the reader and chris make up? don&rsquo;t want to leave you hanging there but this is long enough as it is.</p></p>",
