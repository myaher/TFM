Evenly spaced, one after the other, the shovel heavy in his grasp, under his foot. Ostensibly, he was planting rosemary, but his hands had been shaking when he\u2019d gone to move the first plant out of its pot and he\u2019d mangled the poor thing rather terribly. A miracle had put it back together again, but he thought it might be better just to keep digging and not put the others through the same fate. There was nothing to say planting <i>couldn\u2019t </i>be done in this order, and the only one liable to know enough about gardening to criticize him was Crowley, and she, well. She was a bit preoccupied.</p><p>The garden usually managed itself quite nicely, without Aziraphale putting in nearly this much effort (or any effort at all). There hadn\u2019t even been potted rosemary to plant ten minutes ago. But he was digging, because he needed something to do with himself.</p><p>Aziraphale was not an expert on toddlers, but he knew they had tantrums all the time. That they screamed and fussed and the slightest offense could seem earth-shattering.

And Crowley worked so closely with him. Warlock loved her, Aziraphale was sure of that, but if today had been any indication, well, that might not be enough.</p><p>A thought settled in Aziraphale\u2019s chest, hard and dense and cold like a bullet.\u00a0</p><p>But then, Warlock was only three, and he was a good boy. He\u2019d been making excellent progress. And Crowley was resourceful.

Time for a change, perhaps.</p><p>He wanted to talk to Crowley.</p><p>Instead he picked up a potted plant and ran his fingers through its thin leaves. The plant wasn\u2019t blooming yet, but it smelled fresh and strong and Aziraphale stood there a moment, breathing deeply.</p><p>Then, as gently as he could, he knelt on the ground and began delicately transferring it into the ground.

At least one of them was trembling. Aziraphale pressed his face to Crowley\u2019s hair.</p><p>They stood like that for nearly ten minutes before Crowley stepped aside and coughed.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d she asked. \u201cI saw you. I mean, I saw <i>you.</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d said Aziraphale. He\u2019d almost forgotten that, in the moment, he\u2019d manifested just a bit of an ethereal form. Just in case. And he might have extended himself towards Warlock and Crowley. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know, really,\u201c he said, and that was true. \u201cTrying to keep the two of us safe, I should think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything. He was upset. He had every right to be upset!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but Crowley\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t need to finish the thought.\u00a0</p><p>Crowley let out a strangled noise that was neither agreement or disagreement. She folded her arms tightly across her chest and looked away. After a moment, she snapped \u201cwhatever happens when he gets his powers, we\u2019re <i>not </i>going to hurt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was never part of the plan,\u201d said Aziraphale, promising nothing. He looked down at his hands and thought the last of the of the dirt off them. \u201cRemoving one antichrist from the equation would only lead to a new one in short order, and we\u2019d have no sway over that one at all.\u201d They\u2019d been through all this before, but it was reassuring to say it again. As he spoke, the bullet-like thought sank down into his chest until he could barely feel it anymore.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cAnd even <i>you\u2019d </i>get in trouble for something like that,\u201d Crowley said.</p><p>\u201cOh, undoubtedly,\u201d Aziraphale agreed, as though that would be his main concern if\u2026 Well of course it should be. \u201cBesides,\u201d he sniffed, \u201cI hardly think it would be possible for <i>me</i> to do anything to the boy. Or either of us, once he\u2019s got his powers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d said Crowley, and she sagged a bit with relief that made Aziraphale feel both reassured and vaguely guilty.</p><p>They stood in silence, Crowley still hugging her body, Aziraphale worrying the cuffs of his sleeves.</p><p><br/>\n\u201cYou might want to have a word with him,\u201d Crowley said quietly. \u201cAbout hate and stuff. That\u2019s right up your alley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly. As soon as he\u2019s up from his nap. And Crowley?\u201d He hesitated. \u201cDo be careful, would you?\u201d</p><p>Crowley gave him a weak smile. \u201cI\u2019m a demon, Aziraphale. Remember?\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale shook his head. It wasn\u2019t really an answer but, well, he knew Crowley and she knew how to survive. That would have to be enough.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d Aziraphale said, and Crowley did, leaning into his chest. \u201cWe\u2019re all right,\u201d he said, holding her close. Crowley gave a deep sigh and closed her eyes. She was cool but solid, and her stiff spine relaxed under his hands. \u201cNothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept your shrubs,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cScraggly bunch, the lot of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ought to finish planting them all,\u201d Aziraphale said. He did not let go.</p><p>\u201cLeave them,\u201d said Crowley. \u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>With more certainty than he\u2019d felt about anything all day, Aziraphale pressed his face to Crowley\u2019s head and whispered, \u201cof course, my dear.\u201d</p>",

She still looked pale and shaken.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cA nap ought to sort him out,\u201d Crowley said with a sort of pinched levity. \u201cNothing to worry about.\u201d She looked over the yard. \u201cDoing some actual work for once, I see.\u201d If it was supposed to be a biting comment, it lost all intention halfway through when her voice just barely wavered.</p><p>\u201cOh, my dear,\u201d Aziraphale said, and he stepped forward and wrapped her in his arms. At least one of them was trembling. Aziraphale pressed his face to Crowley\u2019s hair.</p><p>They stood like that for nearly ten minutes before Crowley stepped aside and coughed.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d she asked. \u201cI saw you. I mean, I saw <i>you.</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d said Aziraphale. He\u2019d almost forgotten that, in the moment, he\u2019d manifested just a bit of an ethereal form. Just in case. And he might have extended himself towards Warlock and Crowley. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know, really,\u201c he said, and that was true. \u201cTrying to keep the two of us safe, I should think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything. He was upset. He had every right to be upset!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but Crowley\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t need to finish the thought.\u00a0</p><p>Crowley let out a strangled noise that was neither agreement or disagreement. She folded her arms tightly across her chest and looked away. After a moment, she snapped \u201cwhatever happens when he gets his powers, we\u2019re <i>not </i>going to hurt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was never part of the plan,\u201d said Aziraphale, promising nothing. He looked down at his hands and thought the last of the of the dirt off them. \u201cRemoving one antichrist from the equation would only lead to a new one in short order, and we\u2019d have no sway over that one at all.\u201d They\u2019d been through all this before, but it was reassuring to say it again. As he spoke, the bullet-like thought sank down into his chest until he could barely feel it anymore.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cAnd even <i>you\u2019d </i>get in trouble for something like that,\u201d Crowley said.</p><p>\u201cOh, undoubtedly,\u201d Aziraphale agreed, as though that would be his main concern if\u2026 Well of course it should be. \u201cBesides,\u201d he sniffed, \u201cI hardly think it would be possible for <i>me</i> to do anything to the boy. Or either of us, once he\u2019s got his powers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d said Crowley, and she sagged a bit with relief that made Aziraphale feel both reassured and vaguely guilty.</p><p>They stood in silence, Crowley still hugging her body, Aziraphale worrying the cuffs of his sleeves.</p><p><br>\n\u201cYou might want to have a word with him,\u201d Crowley said quietly. \u201cAbout hate and stuff. That\u2019s right up your alley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly. As soon as he\u2019s up from his nap. And Crowley?\u201d He hesitated. \u201cDo be careful, would you?\u201d</p><p>Crowley gave him a weak smile. \u201cI\u2019m a demon, Aziraphale. Remember?\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale shook his head. It wasn\u2019t really an answer but, well, he knew Crowley and she knew how to survive. That would have to be enough.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d Aziraphale said, and Crowley did, leaning into his chest. \u201cWe\u2019re all right,\u201d he said, holding her close. Crowley gave a deep sigh and closed her eyes. She was cool but solid, and her stiff spine relaxed under his hands. \u201cNothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept your shrubs,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cScraggly bunch, the lot of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ought to finish planting them all,\u201d Aziraphale said. He did not let go.</p><p>\u201cLeave them,\u201d said Crowley. \u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>With more certainty than he\u2019d felt about anything all day, Aziraphale pressed his face to Crowley\u2019s head and whispered, \u201cof course, my dear.\u201d</p></p>",

Lol More plot coming in and a few things I didn&rsquo;t plan on but decided to roll with. Enjoy!</p><p>###</p><p><i>Strapped down to something that you don&rsquo;t understand</i></p><p><i>Don&rsquo;t know what you were getting yourself into</i></p><p><i>You should have known</i></p><p><i>Secretly I think you knew</i></p><p><i>BANKS, \u201cBeggin For Thread\u201d</i></p><p>***</p><p><i>It doesn&rsquo;t </i>look<i> like an abandoned asylum.</i></p><p><i>And our home didn&rsquo;t look like a split-level fixer-upper by the time I finished with it, did it?</i></p><p>Bela had taken Hecate and I back to Crowley&rsquo;s domain within moments of appearing at my house. Hecate was alert and attentive, taking in our new surroundings without leaving my side; I was more and more aware of my connection with Crowley now we were once again in proximity. The heat in my blood left me feeling feverish, I had that tip-of-the-tongue feeling when memories refuse to place themselves or even take shape, and my sense of him was much calmer than earlier, pacified&hellip;<i>slaked</i>.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d I asked Bela, trying to form the words with a throat dry with nerves.</p><p>\u201cNot here,\u201d she replied unhelpfully. \u201cMatters of state, you understand. He&rsquo;ll be along when it suits him.\u201d</p><p>Hecate briefly touched her hand to my shoulder, asking, \u201cAre you his spokesman, or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr something,\u201d she answered.</p><p><i>Well. Good to know she&rsquo;s so straightforward.</i></p><!-- more --><p><i>She works for Crowley,</i> I reasoned. <i>Can&rsquo;t expect anything less</i>.</p><p>Bela moved through the room like she was at ease, leaving Hecate and I standing while she draped her jacket over the back of an armchair and seated herself. She sat staring at us for a minute or two, a haughty smile on her face while we stared back, and eventually she said, \u201cMight as well get comfortable. I don&rsquo;t know how long it will be.\u201d</p><p>Hecate steered me with a touch to the sofa, sitting down and taking me with her. I didn&rsquo;t miss the concerned look she gave me, and I replied, <i>I&rsquo;m fine.</i></p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I said to Bela, \u201che sent you to fetch me back, and I can&rsquo;t decide if that&rsquo;s classified as grunt work or high priority.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI think he gave you the job because it&rsquo;s either very important or not important at all. Which makes you either one or the other as well.\u201d</p><p>Her smirk never wavered. \u201cAnd by extension, <i>you&rsquo;re</i> either one or the other. Trying to figure out which?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying to figure out who he&rsquo;s got keeping eyes on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon&rsquo;t you trust me, your Highness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Crowley?\u201d</p><p>Hecate sat up a little straighter, and I knew we were on the same page.</p><p>Bela shrugged carelessly. \u201cCrowley doesn&rsquo;t trust anybody. He knows them. He knows who will turn on him, who will suck up to gain favor, who will follow orders\u2026 You get the idea. He doesn&rsquo;t <i>need</i> to trust if he understands the game pieces, how they move, and how to play them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, are you a pawn, a rook, or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m whatever he needs, whenever he needs it.\u201d</p><p><i>A queen, then? </i>I asked Hecate.</p><p><i>That sounds like the implication, </i>she answered. <i>A wild card, at the absolute least.</i></p><p><i>We&rsquo;ll have to keep an eye on her.</i></p><p><i>Agreed</i>.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like he trusts you, after all,\u201d I went on.</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;ve proved myself,\u201d she replied. \u201cHe knows I won&rsquo;t cross him unless there&rsquo;s enough in it for me, and he&rsquo;s made sure it would take a steep price.\u201d</p><p><i>She&rsquo;s important enough to buy,</i> Hecate remarked. <i>But is she important enough to share valuable information with?</i></p><p>\u201cSo, because you&rsquo;ve proved yourself, you get assigned to bring the queen back to the castle.\u201d</p><p>Just when I thought she couldn&rsquo;t look any more superior, she raised the bar. \u201cI&rsquo;m not stupid enough to let it get out that a witch-in-training scammed her way out of a deal and onto the throne,\u201d she replied smoothly. \u201cI&rsquo;m not about to destabilize him any further when it&rsquo;s no secret his rule is in jeopardy. Not if I can help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe&rsquo;s made it worth your loyalty to help keep him in power?\u201d</p><p>She leaned back into the chair, her eyes hardening. \u201cI understand you&rsquo;re new here, <i>your Highness,</i> and you might not have picked up a brochure at the welcoming center, so I&rsquo;ll try to clue you in. Hell is a mess. Earth missed the apocalypse but we had a coup. <i>Everyone</i> thought Lucifer would win his final showdown, but Crowley was moving against him long before then, and as soon as Lucifer was eliminated, Crowley stepped up. He had a new vision for Hell and he made it happen, putting an end to a lot of the old ways. And most recently, a Knight of Hell stood to challenge him, promising a return to the golden age and then some.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how many enemies he has? How many want him dead and out of the picture? What do you think will happen to those loyal to him if he falls? What do you think will happen to <i>you?</i> If Crowley isn&rsquo;t worth my loyalty, he&rsquo;s certainly worth my self-preservation, and if you&rsquo;re as clever as you believe you are, you&rsquo;ll come around to that line of thinking.\u201d</p><p><i>Well</i>, Hecate concluded, <i>she&rsquo;s</i> definitely <i>Crowley&rsquo;s</i>.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t respond to either of them, shifting uncomfortably where I sat. I was so <i>hot!</i> I rested my palm against my forehead and my skin was scorching to the touch. Was this the demon blood, or his fire affinity?</p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;ll get used to it.\u201d</p><p>I gave a start at the sound of his voice and beside me, Hecate did the same. Crowley stood just a few feet away, closing the distance to where we sat. Bela moved to stand as he approached, but he motioned for her to keep her seat and regarded me. His expression was neutral, and I couldn&rsquo;t sense anything from him beyond that pacified feeling. He didn&rsquo;t repeat himself, but the quirk of his eyebrow as I continued to fidget with the heat in my flesh was clue enough to guess what he was talking about.</p><p>Maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t have been surprised <i>he</i> could guess my disturbance.</p><p>\u201cBela, sweetheart,\u201d he said, walking between us and settling into a vacant chair, \u201cI see you&rsquo;ve met Endora.\u201d</p><p>She turned to me with a spark of amusement in her eyes. \u201cEndora?\u201d she repeated, laughter coloring her voice. \u201cWhere&rsquo;s Samantha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving an emotional heart-to-heart with Squirrel, last I checked,\u201d Crowley replied. He turned his eyes on Hecate, sitting next to me and taking in every word spoken. \u201cAnd this must be the familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHecate,\u201d I said, his dismissive tone already rubbing me the wrong way.</p><p>He gave me an ironic look. \u201cReally? A witch&rsquo;s companion named <i>Hecate?</i> You couldn&rsquo;t come up with something original?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn&rsquo;t name me,\u201d Katie corrected him.</p><p>\u201cShe&rsquo;s not my pet,\u201d I added, \u201cand everything you have against me has nothing to do with her, so don&rsquo;t be an ass.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. \u201cIs this your first edict as queen?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m serious,\u201d I told him. \u201cShe&rsquo;s not a second class citizen, and anyone that tries to treat her that way will answer to me.\u201d</p><p>He stared at me for a long moment and I stared back, refusing to be intimidated. He could punish, torture, do whatever he wanted to me, but if he thought I would let him disrespect Katie, he thought wrong.</p><p>I only identified the flash of approval I felt for what it was by the smile he gave me. \u201cMake a note of it, Bela,\u201d he said. \u201cHecate is to be afforded the utmost respect by order of the Queen. Anyone in violation of that command is hers to deal with.\u201d</p><p>Bela gave a brief nod. \u201cOf course, your Majesty.\u201d</p><p><i>They&rsquo;re laughing at you</i>, Hecate said in a small voice.</p><p><i>I don&rsquo;t care,</i> I replied firmly. <i>He can leave you out of his problem with me.</i></p><p>\u201cAs for your cover,\u201d he went on, \u201cthat will take some consideration. One mistake, and we&rsquo;re all screwed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;re actually going along with this spy thing?\u201d Bela questioned.</p><p>\u201cShe bargained for the job, love. Begging on hands and knees, she wanted it so bad.\u201d</p><p>I glared at him, ignoring Bela&rsquo;s smug look and the traitorous stirring in my body at his words. He looked at me like he knew exactly what he was doing to me and went on, \u201cShe drove such a good bargain, and I daresay she enjoyed our negotiations even more than I did. She was certainly satisfied with my terms.\u201d</p><p>Hecate chose tactful silence and I kept glaring. He didn&rsquo;t look away, that arrogant light in his eyes unwavering. My insides burned with humiliation and hunger; his voice alone would be enough to get me going, but the innuendos calling back everything he did to me the night before were another level of torment. That he talked of it openly was mortifying&hellip;and turning me on more than I would have preferred under the circumstances. And he <i>knew</i>, the petty bastard.</p><p>A slight smirk, and he continued, \u201cI don&rsquo;t like the idea of you running amok, so Bela here will keep an eye on you as much as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that a good cover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;re going to be her pet.\u201d He snapped his fingers and something tightened around my neck. Startled, I lifted my hands and groped at it, feeling supple leather and a steel buckle beneath my fingers.</p><p>A collar. The son of a bitch put <i>a collar</i> on me.</p><p>\u201cMistress Bela likes witches,\u201d he said. \u201cShe enjoyed scamming her fair share back in the day, and now she has one at her beck and call. How does that sound, Bela, darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;re too generous, your Majesty,\u201d she replied, winking at me.</p><p>\u201cGenerous?\u201d I said, outraged. \u201cAre you insane?\u201d I fumbled at the buckle but the leather fused together where it overlapped, fastened securely.</p><p>\u201cThat collar doesn&rsquo;t come off until I say so,\u201d Crowley said, \u201cand as long as you&rsquo;re wearing it, you&rsquo;ll do exactly as your new mistress says. Understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m not doing this!\u201d I drew on my magic to cut through the leather and felt a ripple of heat at the edges of my power, and before I could make the cut my hand froze in place. His power holding me was hot and my cut palm burned in echo, but when I focused my awareness on the magic, the separate lines were woven together, building off each other even as they clashed.</p><p>\u201cThink about it, Broomhilda,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou won&rsquo;t survive court on your own, much less Hell. This keeps you close enough to my circle to keep you untouchable but far enough away that no one will suspect you. You can cooperate, or I can put some spellwork into that collar to keep you obedient whether you like it or not. Your choice, love.\u201d</p><p>I stopped fighting his grip despite the anger still simmering in my veins. Hecate rested her hand on my arm, tentative, and said, <i>It&hellip;it makes sense, Missy. I know you don&rsquo;t like it, but I think you should go along with it.</i></p><p><i>You want me to debase and degrade myself?</i> I asked.</p><p><i>I want you to do whatever keeps you safest of your own free will, rather than be a complete puppet.</i></p><p>The collar was by no means tight, but I felt as if it was choking me. I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to agree to this. The deal for my power was to claim autonomy, not to hand it away down the line.</p><p>Crowley honed in on me, leaning toward me in his chair, with his elbows on his knees and his fingers laced together. \u201cWe had a deal, Endora,\u201d he said, his voice low and firm. \u201cYou hold up your end, or I hold up mine. Take it or leave it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seems defiant, your Majesty,\u201d Bela remarked. \u201cI&rsquo;m not sure I appreciate that in my pets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don&rsquo;t worry,\u201d he assured her, \u201cshe&rsquo;ll come around.\u201d He leaned back again and waved his fingers, watching me expectantly.</p><p>I had a moment to wonder what he was doing before there was a rush of sensation at my clit, something teasing and stroking with a precision bordering on deliberation. Almost immediately, my spine bowed and my hips bucked into it, and I clutched at the arm of the sofa as a moan burst from me unchecked.</p><p>Hecate&rsquo;s eyes widened in alarm and she tightened her grip on my arm. \u201cAre you okay, Missy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Missy, is it?\u201d Bela asked. She seemed unfazed, watching me squirm without a trace of emotion. \u201cI&rsquo;ll have to remember that one.\u201d</p><p>I couldn&rsquo;t answer, my eyes locked with Crowley&rsquo;s as the sensation intensified. I had no control, my body writhing and every sound growing harder and harder to hold back. He didn&rsquo;t look away, staring like a cat intent on a mouse while my pleasure rose higher with alarming momentum.</p><p>Hecate paused as she slowly understood what was happening, then glanced from me to Crowley and back again, looking awkward. She had never been comfortable with the idea of sex, or sexuality as a whole, finding it personally disturbing. Her bonding with a deviant like me seemed like a cruel trick of fate, and I tried to shield her from it as much as possible. I never allowed my graphic thoughts or memories anywhere near her and spared her details of my exploits, and we each respected each other&rsquo;s needs while seeing to our own.</p><p>Crowley had no such reservations.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I said, gasping; the sensation escalated almost to its peak and halted, keeping me at the point of near-climax. I reached for Hecate&rsquo;s hand, seeing the revulsion in her eyes and trying to reassure her. Her body tensed and she nearly flinched away from me, hands moving to cover her ears and drown me out. <i>I&rsquo;m sorry,</i> she said, frightened and upset, <i>I&rsquo;m sorry, I can't\u2026</i> She turned away and ducked her head, humming to herself so she couldn&rsquo;t hear me.</p><p>I was nearly out of my mind with it, unable to sit still, unable to come, hurting for my familiar and cursing Crowley. It was a perfect torture, having seen what a shameless, pleading mess I devolved to the night before, and it wouldn&rsquo;t harm him as well like this morning. But it was seeing Katie so wretched that struck the real blow. </p><p>I threw my head back and cried out again, and he shuddered where he sat, something in his gaze shifting. I was wound tight enough to snap, digging my nails into my palms until the skin broke, and he clenched a fist, his jaw tightening and an intense look in his eyes. It was agony, feeling so much yet never allowed release, an agony he mirrored, and neither of the others saw it. </p><p>\u201cCrowley,\u201d I pleaded, \u201cstop\u2026\u201d I couldn&rsquo;t handle any more, and the closer I got to unraveling, the clearer it was he was close behind. \u201cCrowley, please!\u201d I nearly screamed.</p><p>He waved his hand again; everything stopped but the tension in my body didn&rsquo;t abate. He sat rigid and unmoving, on the same edge as I was. \u201cLast chance, pet,\u201d he said, a rough tremor in his voice giving him away, \u201care you going to be a good girl for Mistress Bela?\u201d</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t letting <i>me</i> off the hook, then. He bruised my pride, humiliated me, and distressed my familiar, but he wasn&rsquo;t about to embarrass himself. I wanted to defy him out of spite, but for Hecate&rsquo;s sake I yielded. \u201cYes,\u201d I replied, hoping he could feel the seething ire coiling in my chest.</p><p>He narrowed his eyes; yes, he could, and in retaliation he pressed, \u201cYes, what?\u201d</p><p>Hecate hesitated, slowly reaching towards me to clutch my hand in hers. <i>I&rsquo;m sorry, Mistress\u2026</i></p><p>Taking a deep breath, I unclenched my jaw and said, \u201cI&rsquo;ll be good for Mistress Bela.\u201d</p><p>Bela smiled and while I felt Crowley&rsquo;s mild triumph, his expression didn&rsquo;t change. \u201cI&rsquo;ll expect you to behave for her, in addition to playing your part and keeping an eye on the court. If she tells me you&rsquo;re being difficult, consider today an idea of your punishment. If she says you&rsquo;re being a good pet&hellip;you know how I reward those who make me happy.\u201d</p><p>Hecate squirmed and I apologized, <i>I didn&rsquo;t know it would be like this, Katie.</i></p><p><i>It&rsquo;s fine, Missy,</i> she replied. </p><p><i>No, it&rsquo;s not.</i> \u201cHecate is sensitive to certain factors,\u201d I said. \u201cShe finds certain acts distasteful, and I expose her to those factors as little as possible to keep from upsetting her. Doing so on purpose is uncalled for and <i>highly</i> disrespectful.\u201d I paused a beat for emphasis, then added a snide, \u201cYour Majesty.\u201d</p><p><i>If you&rsquo;re going to fuck me, don&rsquo;t you dare do it in front of her.</i> The words went unspoken, but no one missed them. I had no idea if I had enough leverage to keep pushing, but it was clear enough that when it came to my familiar, I was ready to fight. I read a measure of respect in Bela&rsquo;s eyes, but all Crowley said was, \u201cBehave yourself, and we won&rsquo;t have to worry about that, will we?\u201d</p><p><i>I don&rsquo;t like this, Missy,</i> Hecate said. <i>You&rsquo;ve made yourself too vulnerable for my sake. He&rsquo;ll use me against you.</i></p><p><i>You were willing to risk yourself for me, Katie, </i>I replied. <i>I won&rsquo;t do any less for you.</i></p><p><i>And he knows that now. I&rsquo;ll be his leverage to get what he wants from you.</i></p><p>There was a cold feeling in my stomach as the truth of her words sank in. I didn&rsquo;t regret standing up for her, but Crowley would have no problem threatening her to force my cooperation. She was never afraid for herself, but I knew the thought of what he could make me do to keep her safe would torment her.</p><p>He still looked at me like he expected further resistance, if not now then later. And if he tried to harm Hecate, he <i>should</i> expect it. I had gotten the best of him once and doubtless he would try to keep it from happening a second time&hellip;but if I could do it once, then I could do it again. I was bound and collared, not broken. </p><p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be easy, but that didn&rsquo;t scare me. I had always preferred high stakes.</p><p>###</p><p>Tagging: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7oqEXOtRpkDhNq-fdhRYKA\">@flames-bring-a-ton-of-ash</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKJSQKWDbQH5l1JZW64FKww\">@rckyfrk</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moYGcX4XCTZAvCoJ0S6w6xw\">@loveforfilm</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moFXmc6XvPiB1RgXTA1JujQ\">@lostgirl14480</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5TqgC0JFsZpbRt96Wn5oNg\">@alahmorah</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6mGCc1B_HYeWxDxOe4xiTg\">@chamberofsloths</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCNKbeDIf_xeVGKW4UQsdWA\">@frenchhedonism</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlPh6SD7ldaHcKaTG207Wrw\">@gingersnap3344</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNyc84TaeXXm8KMC5hme3uQ\">@letsby</a></p><p>Likes are cool, reblogs are better!

Lol More plot coming in and a few things I didn\u2019t plan on but decided to roll with. Enjoy!</p><p>###</p><p><i>Strapped down to something that you don\u2019t understand</i></p><p><i>Don\u2019t know what you were getting yourself into</i></p><p><i>You should have known</i></p><p><i>Secretly I think you knew</i></p><p><i>BANKS, \u201cBeggin For Thread\u201d</i></p><p>***</p><p><i>It doesn\u2019t </i>look<i> like an abandoned asylum.</i></p><p><i>And our home didn\u2019t look like a split-level fixer-upper by the time I finished with it, did it?</i></p><p>Bela had taken Hecate and I back to Crowley\u2019s domain within moments of appearing at my house. Hecate was alert and attentive, taking in our new surroundings without leaving my side; I was more and more aware of my connection with Crowley now we were once again in proximity. The heat in my blood left me feeling feverish, I had that tip-of-the-tongue feeling when memories refuse to place themselves or even take shape, and my sense of him was much calmer than earlier, pacified\u2026<i>slaked</i>.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d I asked Bela, trying to form the words with a throat dry with nerves.</p><p>\u201cNot here,\u201d she replied unhelpfully. \u201cMatters of state, you understand. He\u2019ll be along when it suits him.\u201d</p><p>Hecate briefly touched her hand to my shoulder, asking, \u201cAre you his spokesman, or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr something,\u201d she answered.</p><p><i>Well. Good to know she\u2019s so straightforward.</i></p>[[MORE]]<p><i>She works for Crowley,</i> I reasoned. <i>Can\u2019t expect anything less</i>.</p><p>Bela moved through the room like she was at ease, leaving Hecate and I standing while she draped her jacket over the back of an armchair and seated herself. She sat staring at us for a minute or two, a haughty smile on her face while we stared back, and eventually she said, \u201cMight as well get comfortable. I don\u2019t know how long it will be.\u201d</p><p>Hecate steered me with a touch to the sofa, sitting down and taking me with her. I didn\u2019t miss the concerned look she gave me, and I replied, <i>I\u2019m fine.</i></p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I said to Bela, \u201che sent you to fetch me back, and I can\u2019t decide if that\u2019s classified as grunt work or high priority.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI think he gave you the job because it\u2019s either very important or not important at all. Which makes you either one or the other as well.\u201d</p><p>Her smirk never wavered. \u201cAnd by extension, <i>you\u2019re</i> either one or the other. Trying to figure out which?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying to figure out who he\u2019s got keeping eyes on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you trust me, your Highness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Crowley?\u201d</p><p>Hecate sat up a little straighter, and I knew we were on the same page.</p><p>Bela shrugged carelessly. \u201cCrowley doesn\u2019t trust anybody. He knows them. He knows who will turn on him, who will suck up to gain favor, who will follow orders\u2026 You get the idea. He doesn\u2019t <i>need</i> to trust if he understands the game pieces, how they move, and how to play them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, are you a pawn, a rook, or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m whatever he needs, whenever he needs it.\u201d</p><p><i>A queen, then? </i>I asked Hecate.</p><p><i>That sounds like the implication, </i>she answered. <i>A wild card, at the absolute least.</i></p><p><i>We\u2019ll have to keep an eye on her.</i></p><p><i>Agreed</i>.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like he trusts you, after all,\u201d I went on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve proved myself,\u201d she replied. \u201cHe knows I won\u2019t cross him unless there\u2019s enough in it for me, and he\u2019s made sure it would take a steep price.\u201d</p><p><i>She\u2019s important enough to buy,</i> Hecate remarked. <i>But is she important enough to share valuable information with?</i></p><p>\u201cSo, because you\u2019ve proved yourself, you get assigned to bring the queen back to the castle.\u201d</p><p>Just when I thought she couldn\u2019t look any more superior, she raised the bar. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid enough to let it get out that a witch-in-training scammed her way out of a deal and onto the throne,\u201d she replied smoothly. \u201cI\u2019m not about to destabilize him any further when it\u2019s no secret his rule is in jeopardy. Not if I can help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s made it worth your loyalty to help keep him in power?\u201d</p><p>She leaned back into the chair, her eyes hardening. \u201cI understand you\u2019re new here, <i>your Highness,</i> and you might not have picked up a brochure at the welcoming center, so I\u2019ll try to clue you in. Hell is a mess. Earth missed the apocalypse but we had a coup. <i>Everyone</i> thought Lucifer would win his final showdown, but Crowley was moving against him long before then, and as soon as Lucifer was eliminated, Crowley stepped up. He had a new vision for Hell and he made it happen, putting an end to a lot of the old ways. And most recently, a Knight of Hell stood to challenge him, promising a return to the golden age and then some.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how many enemies he has? How many want him dead and out of the picture? What do you think will happen to those loyal to him if he falls? What do you think will happen to <i>you?</i> If Crowley isn\u2019t worth my loyalty, he\u2019s certainly worth my self-preservation, and if you\u2019re as clever as you believe you are, you\u2019ll come around to that line of thinking.\u201d</p><p><i>Well</i>, Hecate concluded, <i>she\u2019s</i> definitely <i>Crowley\u2019s</i>.</p><p>I didn\u2019t respond to either of them, shifting uncomfortably where I sat. I was so <i>hot!</i> I rested my palm against my forehead and my skin was scorching to the touch. Was this the demon blood, or his fire affinity?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d</p><p>I gave a start at the sound of his voice and beside me, Hecate did the same. Crowley stood just a few feet away, closing the distance to where we sat. Bela moved to stand as he approached, but he motioned for her to keep her seat and regarded me. His expression was neutral, and I couldn\u2019t sense anything from him beyond that pacified feeling. He didn\u2019t repeat himself, but the quirk of his eyebrow as I continued to fidget with the heat in my flesh was clue enough to guess what he was talking about.</p><p>Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised <i>he</i> could guess my disturbance.</p><p>\u201cBela, sweetheart,\u201d he said, walking between us and settling into a vacant chair, \u201cI see you\u2019ve met Endora.\u201d</p><p>She turned to me with a spark of amusement in her eyes. \u201cEndora?\u201d she repeated, laughter coloring her voice. \u201cWhere\u2019s Samantha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving an emotional heart-to-heart with Squirrel, last I checked,\u201d Crowley replied. He turned his eyes on Hecate, sitting next to me and taking in every word spoken. \u201cAnd this must be the familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHecate,\u201d I said, his dismissive tone already rubbing me the wrong way.</p><p>He gave me an ironic look. \u201cReally? A witch\u2019s companion named <i>Hecate?</i> You couldn\u2019t come up with something original?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t name me,\u201d Katie corrected him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not my pet,\u201d I added, \u201cand everything you have against me has nothing to do with her, so don\u2019t be an ass.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. \u201cIs this your first edict as queen?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d I told him. \u201cShe\u2019s not a second class citizen, and anyone that tries to treat her that way will answer to me.\u201d</p><p>He stared at me for a long moment and I stared back, refusing to be intimidated. He could punish, torture, do whatever he wanted to me, but if he thought I would let him disrespect Katie, he thought wrong.</p><p>I only identified the flash of approval I felt for what it was by the smile he gave me. \u201cMake a note of it, Bela,\u201d he said. \u201cHecate is to be afforded the utmost respect by order of the Queen. Anyone in violation of that command is hers to deal with.\u201d</p><p>Bela gave a brief nod. \u201cOf course, your Majesty.\u201d</p><p><i>They\u2019re laughing at you</i>, Hecate said in a small voice.</p><p><i>I don\u2019t care,</i> I replied firmly. <i>He can leave you out of his problem with me.</i></p><p>\u201cAs for your cover,\u201d he went on, \u201cthat will take some consideration. One mistake, and we\u2019re all screwed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re actually going along with this spy thing?\u201d Bela questioned.</p><p>\u201cShe bargained for the job, love. Begging on hands and knees, she wanted it so bad.\u201d</p><p>I glared at him, ignoring Bela\u2019s smug look and the traitorous stirring in my body at his words. He looked at me like he knew exactly what he was doing to me and went on, \u201cShe drove such a good bargain, and I daresay she enjoyed our negotiations even more than I did. She was certainly satisfied with my terms.\u201d</p><p>Hecate chose tactful silence and I kept glaring. He didn\u2019t look away, that arrogant light in his eyes unwavering. My insides burned with humiliation and hunger; his voice alone would be enough to get me going, but the innuendos calling back everything he did to me the night before were another level of torment. That he talked of it openly was mortifying\u2026and turning me on more than I would have preferred under the circumstances. And he <i>knew</i>, the petty bastard.</p><p>A slight smirk, and he continued, \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of you running amok, so Bela here will keep an eye on you as much as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that a good cover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be her pet.\u201d He snapped his fingers and something tightened around my neck. Startled, I lifted my hands and groped at it, feeling supple leather and a steel buckle beneath my fingers.</p><p>A collar. The son of a bitch put <i>a collar</i> on me.</p><p>\u201cMistress Bela likes witches,\u201d he said. \u201cShe enjoyed scamming her fair share back in the day, and now she has one at her beck and call. How does that sound, Bela, darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too generous, your Majesty,\u201d she replied, winking at me.</p><p>\u201cGenerous?\u201d I said, outraged. \u201cAre you insane?\u201d I fumbled at the buckle but the leather fused together where it overlapped, fastened securely.</p><p>\u201cThat collar doesn\u2019t come off until I say so,\u201d Crowley said, \u201cand as long as you\u2019re wearing it, you\u2019ll do exactly as your new mistress says. Understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing this!\u201d I drew on my magic to cut through the leather and felt a ripple of heat at the edges of my power, and before I could make the cut my hand froze in place. His power holding me was hot and my cut palm burned in echo, but when I focused my awareness on the magic, the separate lines were woven together, building off each other even as they clashed.</p><p>\u201cThink about it, Broomhilda,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou won\u2019t survive court on your own, much less Hell. This keeps you close enough to my circle to keep you untouchable but far enough away that no one will suspect you. You can cooperate, or I can put some spellwork into that collar to keep you obedient whether you like it or not. Your choice, love.\u201d</p><p>I stopped fighting his grip despite the anger still simmering in my veins. Hecate rested her hand on my arm, tentative, and said, <i>It\u2026it makes sense, Missy. I know you don\u2019t like it, but I think you should go along with it.</i></p><p><i>You want me to debase and degrade myself?</i> I asked.</p><p><i>I want you to do whatever keeps you safest of your own free will, rather than be a complete puppet.</i></p><p>The collar was by no means tight, but I felt as if it was choking me. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to agree to this. The deal for my power was to claim autonomy, not to hand it away down the line.</p><p>Crowley honed in on me, leaning toward me in his chair, with his elbows on his knees and his fingers laced together. \u201cWe had a deal, Endora,\u201d he said, his voice low and firm. \u201cYou hold up your end, or I hold up mine. Take it or leave it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seems defiant, your Majesty,\u201d Bela remarked. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I appreciate that in my pets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry,\u201d he assured her, \u201cshe\u2019ll come around.\u201d He leaned back again and waved his fingers, watching me expectantly.</p><p>I had a moment to wonder what he was doing before there was a rush of sensation at my clit, something teasing and stroking with a precision bordering on deliberation. Almost immediately, my spine bowed and my hips bucked into it, and I clutched at the arm of the sofa as a moan burst from me unchecked.</p><p>Hecate\u2019s eyes widened in alarm and she tightened her grip on my arm. \u201cAre you okay, Missy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Missy, is it?\u201d Bela asked. She seemed unfazed, watching me squirm without a trace of emotion. \u201cI\u2019ll have to remember that one.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t answer, my eyes locked with Crowley\u2019s as the sensation intensified. I had no control, my body writhing and every sound growing harder and harder to hold back. He didn\u2019t look away, staring like a cat intent on a mouse while my pleasure rose higher with alarming momentum.</p><p>Hecate paused as she slowly understood what was happening, then glanced from me to Crowley and back again, looking awkward. She had never been comfortable with the idea of sex, or sexuality as a whole, finding it personally disturbing. Her bonding with a deviant like me seemed like a cruel trick of fate, and I tried to shield her from it as much as possible. I never allowed my graphic thoughts or memories anywhere near her and spared her details of my exploits, and we each respected each other\u2019s needs while seeing to our own.</p><p>Crowley had no such reservations.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I said, gasping; the sensation escalated almost to its peak and halted, keeping me at the point of near-climax. I reached for Hecate\u2019s hand, seeing the revulsion in her eyes and trying to reassure her. Her body tensed and she nearly flinched away from me, hands moving to cover her ears and drown me out. <i>I\u2019m sorry,</i> she said, frightened and upset, <i>I\u2019m sorry, I can't\u2026</i> She turned away and ducked her head, humming to herself so she couldn\u2019t hear me.</p><p>I was nearly out of my mind with it, unable to sit still, unable to come, hurting for my familiar and cursing Crowley. It was a perfect torture, having seen what a shameless, pleading mess I devolved to the night before, and it wouldn\u2019t harm him as well like this morning. But it was seeing Katie so wretched that struck the real blow. </p><p>I threw my head back and cried out again, and he shuddered where he sat, something in his gaze shifting. I was wound tight enough to snap, digging my nails into my palms until the skin broke, and he clenched a fist, his jaw tightening and an intense look in his eyes. It was agony, feeling so much yet never allowed release, an agony he mirrored, and neither of the others saw it. </p><p>\u201cCrowley,\u201d I pleaded, \u201cstop\u2026\u201d I couldn\u2019t handle any more, and the closer I got to unraveling, the clearer it was he was close behind. \u201cCrowley, please!\u201d I nearly screamed.</p><p>He waved his hand again; everything stopped but the tension in my body didn\u2019t abate. He sat rigid and unmoving, on the same edge as I was. \u201cLast chance, pet,\u201d he said, a rough tremor in his voice giving him away, \u201care you going to be a good girl for Mistress Bela?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t letting <i>me</i> off the hook, then. He bruised my pride, humiliated me, and distressed my familiar, but he wasn\u2019t about to embarrass himself. I wanted to defy him out of spite, but for Hecate\u2019s sake I yielded. \u201cYes,\u201d I replied, hoping he could feel the seething ire coiling in my chest.</p><p>He narrowed his eyes; yes, he could, and in retaliation he pressed, \u201cYes, what?\u201d</p><p>Hecate hesitated, slowly reaching towards me to clutch my hand in hers. <i>I\u2019m sorry, Mistress\u2026</i></p><p>Taking a deep breath, I unclenched my jaw and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be good for Mistress Bela.\u201d</p><p>Bela smiled and while I felt Crowley\u2019s mild triumph, his expression didn\u2019t change. \u201cI\u2019ll expect you to behave for her, in addition to playing your part and keeping an eye on the court. If she tells me you\u2019re being difficult, consider today an idea of your punishment. If she says you\u2019re being a good pet\u2026you know how I reward those who make me happy.\u201d</p><p>Hecate squirmed and I apologized, <i>I didn\u2019t know it would be like this, Katie.</i></p><p><i>It\u2019s fine, Missy,</i> she replied. </p><p><i>No, it\u2019s not.</i> \u201cHecate is sensitive to certain factors,\u201d I said. \u201cShe finds certain acts distasteful, and I expose her to those factors as little as possible to keep from upsetting her. Doing so on purpose is uncalled for and <i>highly</i> disrespectful.\u201d I paused a beat for emphasis, then added a snide, \u201cYour Majesty.\u201d</p><p><i>If you\u2019re going to fuck me, don\u2019t you dare do it in front of her.</i> The words went unspoken, but no one missed them. I had no idea if I had enough leverage to keep pushing, but it was clear enough that when it came to my familiar, I was ready to fight. I read a measure of respect in Bela\u2019s eyes, but all Crowley said was, \u201cBehave yourself, and we won\u2019t have to worry about that, will we?\u201d</p><p><i>I don\u2019t like this, Missy,</i> Hecate said. <i>You\u2019ve made yourself too vulnerable for my sake. He\u2019ll use me against you.</i></p><p><i>You were willing to risk yourself for me, Katie, </i>I replied. <i>I won\u2019t do any less for you.</i></p><p><i>And he knows that now. I\u2019ll be his leverage to get what he wants from you.</i></p><p>There was a cold feeling in my stomach as the truth of her words sank in. I didn\u2019t regret standing up for her, but Crowley would have no problem threatening her to force my cooperation. She was never afraid for herself, but I knew the thought of what he could make me do to keep her safe would torment her.</p><p>He still looked at me like he expected further resistance, if not now then later. And if he tried to harm Hecate, he <i>should</i> expect it. I had gotten the best of him once and doubtless he would try to keep it from happening a second time\u2026but if I could do it once, then I could do it again. I was bound and collared, not broken. </p><p>It wouldn\u2019t be easy, but that didn\u2019t scare me. I had always preferred high stakes.</p><p>###</p><p>Tagging: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7oqEXOtRpkDhNq-fdhRYKA\">@flames-bring-a-ton-of-ash</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKJSQKWDbQH5l1JZW64FKww\">@rckyfrk</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moYGcX4XCTZAvCoJ0S6w6xw\">@loveforfilm</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moFXmc6XvPiB1RgXTA1JujQ\">@lostgirl14480</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5TqgC0JFsZpbRt96Wn5oNg\">@alahmorah</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6mGCc1B_HYeWxDxOe4xiTg\">@chamberofsloths</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCNKbeDIf_xeVGKW4UQsdWA\">@frenchhedonism</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlPh6SD7ldaHcKaTG207Wrw\">@gingersnap3344</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNyc84TaeXXm8KMC5hme3uQ\">@letsby</a></p><p>Likes are cool, reblogs are better!

Hecate was alert and attentive, taking in our new surroundings without leaving my side; I was more and more aware of my connection with Crowley now we were once again in proximity. The heat in my blood left me feeling feverish, I had that tip-of-the-tongue feeling when memories refuse to place themselves or even take shape, and my sense of him was much calmer than earlier, pacified\u2026<i>slaked</i>.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d I asked Bela, trying to form the words with a throat dry with nerves.</p><p>\u201cNot here,\u201d she replied unhelpfully. \u201cMatters of state, you understand. He\u2019ll be along when it suits him.\u201d</p><p>Hecate briefly touched her hand to my shoulder, asking, \u201cAre you his spokesman, or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr something,\u201d she answered.</p><p><i>Well. Good to know she\u2019s so straightforward.</i></p>[[MORE]]<p><i>She works for Crowley,</i> I reasoned. <i>Can\u2019t expect anything less</i>.</p><p>Bela moved through the room like she was at ease, leaving Hecate and I standing while she draped her jacket over the back of an armchair and seated herself. She sat staring at us for a minute or two, a haughty smile on her face while we stared back, and eventually she said, \u201cMight as well get comfortable. I don\u2019t know how long it will be.\u201d</p><p>Hecate steered me with a touch to the sofa, sitting down and taking me with her. I didn\u2019t miss the concerned look she gave me, and I replied, <i>I\u2019m fine.</i></p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I said to Bela, \u201che sent you to fetch me back, and I can\u2019t decide if that\u2019s classified as grunt work or high priority.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI think he gave you the job because it\u2019s either very important or not important at all. Which makes you either one or the other as well.\u201d</p><p>Her smirk never wavered. \u201cAnd by extension, <i>you\u2019re</i> either one or the other. Trying to figure out which?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying to figure out who he\u2019s got keeping eyes on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you trust me, your Highness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Crowley?\u201d</p><p>Hecate sat up a little straighter, and I knew we were on the same page.</p><p>Bela shrugged carelessly. \u201cCrowley doesn\u2019t trust anybody. He knows them. He knows who will turn on him, who will suck up to gain favor, who will follow orders\u2026 You get the idea. He doesn\u2019t <i>need</i> to trust if he understands the game pieces, how they move, and how to play them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, are you a pawn, a rook, or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m whatever he needs, whenever he needs it.\u201d</p><p><i>A queen, then? </i>I asked Hecate.</p><p><i>That sounds like the implication, </i>she answered. <i>A wild card, at the absolute least.</i></p><p><i>We\u2019ll have to keep an eye on her.</i></p><p><i>Agreed</i>.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like he trusts you, after all,\u201d I went on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve proved myself,\u201d she replied. \u201cHe knows I won\u2019t cross him unless there\u2019s enough in it for me, and he\u2019s made sure it would take a steep price.\u201d</p><p><i>She\u2019s important enough to buy,</i> Hecate remarked. <i>But is she important enough to share valuable information with?</i></p><p>\u201cSo, because you\u2019ve proved yourself, you get assigned to bring the queen back to the castle.\u201d</p><p>Just when I thought she couldn\u2019t look any more superior, she raised the bar. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid enough to let it get out that a witch-in-training scammed her way out of a deal and onto the throne,\u201d she replied smoothly. \u201cI\u2019m not about to destabilize him any further when it\u2019s no secret his rule is in jeopardy. Not if I can help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s made it worth your loyalty to help keep him in power?\u201d</p><p>She leaned back into the chair, her eyes hardening. \u201cI understand you\u2019re new here, <i>your Highness,</i> and you might not have picked up a brochure at the welcoming center, so I\u2019ll try to clue you in. Hell is a mess. Earth missed the apocalypse but we had a coup. <i>Everyone</i> thought Lucifer would win his final showdown, but Crowley was moving against him long before then, and as soon as Lucifer was eliminated, Crowley stepped up. He had a new vision for Hell and he made it happen, putting an end to a lot of the old ways. And most recently, a Knight of Hell stood to challenge him, promising a return to the golden age and then some.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how many enemies he has? How many want him dead and out of the picture? What do you think will happen to those loyal to him if he falls? What do you think will happen to <i>you?</i> If Crowley isn\u2019t worth my loyalty, he\u2019s certainly worth my self-preservation, and if you\u2019re as clever as you believe you are, you\u2019ll come around to that line of thinking.\u201d</p><p><i>Well</i>, Hecate concluded, <i>she\u2019s</i> definitely <i>Crowley\u2019s</i>.</p><p>I didn\u2019t respond to either of them, shifting uncomfortably where I sat. I was so <i>hot!</i> I rested my palm against my forehead and my skin was scorching to the touch. Was this the demon blood, or his fire affinity?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d</p><p>I gave a start at the sound of his voice and beside me, Hecate did the same. Crowley stood just a few feet away, closing the distance to where we sat. Bela moved to stand as he approached, but he motioned for her to keep her seat and regarded me. His expression was neutral, and I couldn\u2019t sense anything from him beyond that pacified feeling. He didn\u2019t repeat himself, but the quirk of his eyebrow as I continued to fidget with the heat in my flesh was clue enough to guess what he was talking about.</p><p>Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised <i>he</i> could guess my disturbance.</p><p>\u201cBela, sweetheart,\u201d he said, walking between us and settling into a vacant chair, \u201cI see you\u2019ve met Endora.\u201d</p><p>She turned to me with a spark of amusement in her eyes. \u201cEndora?\u201d she repeated, laughter coloring her voice. \u201cWhere\u2019s Samantha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving an emotional heart-to-heart with Squirrel, last I checked,\u201d Crowley replied. He turned his eyes on Hecate, sitting next to me and taking in every word spoken. \u201cAnd this must be the familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHecate,\u201d I said, his dismissive tone already rubbing me the wrong way.</p><p>He gave me an ironic look. \u201cReally? A witch\u2019s companion named <i>Hecate?</i> You couldn\u2019t come up with something original?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t name me,\u201d Katie corrected him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not my pet,\u201d I added, \u201cand everything you have against me has nothing to do with her, so don\u2019t be an ass.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. \u201cIs this your first edict as queen?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d I told him. \u201cShe\u2019s not a second class citizen, and anyone that tries to treat her that way will answer to me.\u201d</p><p>He stared at me for a long moment and I stared back, refusing to be intimidated. He could punish, torture, do whatever he wanted to me, but if he thought I would let him disrespect Katie, he thought wrong.</p><p>I only identified the flash of approval I felt for what it was by the smile he gave me. \u201cMake a note of it, Bela,\u201d he said. \u201cHecate is to be afforded the utmost respect by order of the Queen. Anyone in violation of that command is hers to deal with.\u201d</p><p>Bela gave a brief nod. \u201cOf course, your Majesty.\u201d</p><p><i>They\u2019re laughing at you</i>, Hecate said in a small voice.</p><p><i>I don\u2019t care,</i> I replied firmly. <i>He can leave you out of his problem with me.</i></p><p>\u201cAs for your cover,\u201d he went on, \u201cthat will take some consideration. One mistake, and we\u2019re all screwed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re actually going along with this spy thing?\u201d Bela questioned.</p><p>\u201cShe bargained for the job, love. Begging on hands and knees, she wanted it so bad.\u201d</p><p>I glared at him, ignoring Bela\u2019s smug look and the traitorous stirring in my body at his words. He looked at me like he knew exactly what he was doing to me and went on, \u201cShe drove such a good bargain, and I daresay she enjoyed our negotiations even more than I did. She was certainly satisfied with my terms.\u201d</p><p>Hecate chose tactful silence and I kept glaring. He didn\u2019t look away, that arrogant light in his eyes unwavering. My insides burned with humiliation and hunger; his voice alone would be enough to get me going, but the innuendos calling back everything he did to me the night before were another level of torment. That he talked of it openly was mortifying\u2026and turning me on more than I would have preferred under the circumstances. And he <i>knew</i>, the petty bastard.</p><p>A slight smirk, and he continued, \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of you running amok, so Bela here will keep an eye on you as much as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that a good cover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be her pet.\u201d He snapped his fingers and something tightened around my neck. Startled, I lifted my hands and groped at it, feeling supple leather and a steel buckle beneath my fingers.</p><p>A collar. The son of a bitch put <i>a collar</i> on me.</p><p>\u201cMistress Bela likes witches,\u201d he said. \u201cShe enjoyed scamming her fair share back in the day, and now she has one at her beck and call. How does that sound, Bela, darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too generous, your Majesty,\u201d she replied, winking at me.</p><p>\u201cGenerous?\u201d I said, outraged. \u201cAre you insane?\u201d I fumbled at the buckle but the leather fused together where it overlapped, fastened securely.</p><p>\u201cThat collar doesn\u2019t come off until I say so,\u201d Crowley said, \u201cand as long as you\u2019re wearing it, you\u2019ll do exactly as your new mistress says. Understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing this!\u201d I drew on my magic to cut through the leather and felt a ripple of heat at the edges of my power, and before I could make the cut my hand froze in place. His power holding me was hot and my cut palm burned in echo, but when I focused my awareness on the magic, the separate lines were woven together, building off each other even as they clashed.</p><p>\u201cThink about it, Broomhilda,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou won\u2019t survive court on your own, much less Hell. This keeps you close enough to my circle to keep you untouchable but far enough away that no one will suspect you. You can cooperate, or I can put some spellwork into that collar to keep you obedient whether you like it or not. Your choice, love.\u201d</p><p>I stopped fighting his grip despite the anger still simmering in my veins. Hecate rested her hand on my arm, tentative, and said, <i>It\u2026it makes sense, Missy. I know you don\u2019t like it, but I think you should go along with it.</i></p><p><i>You want me to debase and degrade myself?</i> I asked.</p><p><i>I want you to do whatever keeps you safest of your own free will, rather than be a complete puppet.</i></p><p>The collar was by no means tight, but I felt as if it was choking me. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to agree to this. The deal for my power was to claim autonomy, not to hand it away down the line.</p><p>Crowley honed in on me, leaning toward me in his chair, with his elbows on his knees and his fingers laced together. \u201cWe had a deal, Endora,\u201d he said, his voice low and firm. \u201cYou hold up your end, or I hold up mine. Take it or leave it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seems defiant, your Majesty,\u201d Bela remarked. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I appreciate that in my pets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry,\u201d he assured her, \u201cshe\u2019ll come around.\u201d He leaned back again and waved his fingers, watching me expectantly.</p><p>I had a moment to wonder what he was doing before there was a rush of sensation at my clit, something teasing and stroking with a precision bordering on deliberation. Almost immediately, my spine bowed and my hips bucked into it, and I clutched at the arm of the sofa as a moan burst from me unchecked.</p><p>Hecate\u2019s eyes widened in alarm and she tightened her grip on my arm. \u201cAre you okay, Missy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Missy, is it?\u201d Bela asked. She seemed unfazed, watching me squirm without a trace of emotion. \u201cI\u2019ll have to remember that one.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t answer, my eyes locked with Crowley\u2019s as the sensation intensified. I had no control, my body writhing and every sound growing harder and harder to hold back. He didn\u2019t look away, staring like a cat intent on a mouse while my pleasure rose higher with alarming momentum.</p><p>Hecate paused as she slowly understood what was happening, then glanced from me to Crowley and back again, looking awkward. She had never been comfortable with the idea of sex, or sexuality as a whole, finding it personally disturbing. Her bonding with a deviant like me seemed like a cruel trick of fate, and I tried to shield her from it as much as possible. I never allowed my graphic thoughts or memories anywhere near her and spared her details of my exploits, and we each respected each other\u2019s needs while seeing to our own.</p><p>Crowley had no such reservations.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I said, gasping; the sensation escalated almost to its peak and halted, keeping me at the point of near-climax. I reached for Hecate\u2019s hand, seeing the revulsion in her eyes and trying to reassure her. Her body tensed and she nearly flinched away from me, hands moving to cover her ears and drown me out. <i>I\u2019m sorry,</i> she said, frightened and upset, <i>I\u2019m sorry, I can't\u2026</i> She turned away and ducked her head, humming to herself so she couldn\u2019t hear me.</p><p>I was nearly out of my mind with it, unable to sit still, unable to come, hurting for my familiar and cursing Crowley. It was a perfect torture, having seen what a shameless, pleading mess I devolved to the night before, and it wouldn\u2019t harm him as well like this morning. But it was seeing Katie so wretched that struck the real blow. </p><p>I threw my head back and cried out again, and he shuddered where he sat, something in his gaze shifting. I was wound tight enough to snap, digging my nails into my palms until the skin broke, and he clenched a fist, his jaw tightening and an intense look in his eyes. It was agony, feeling so much yet never allowed release, an agony he mirrored, and neither of the others saw it. </p><p>\u201cCrowley,\u201d I pleaded, \u201cstop\u2026\u201d I couldn\u2019t handle any more, and the closer I got to unraveling, the clearer it was he was close behind. \u201cCrowley, please!\u201d I nearly screamed.</p><p>He waved his hand again; everything stopped but the tension in my body didn\u2019t abate. He sat rigid and unmoving, on the same edge as I was. \u201cLast chance, pet,\u201d he said, a rough tremor in his voice giving him away, \u201care you going to be a good girl for Mistress Bela?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t letting <i>me</i> off the hook, then. He bruised my pride, humiliated me, and distressed my familiar, but he wasn\u2019t about to embarrass himself. I wanted to defy him out of spite, but for Hecate\u2019s sake I yielded. \u201cYes,\u201d I replied, hoping he could feel the seething ire coiling in my chest.</p><p>He narrowed his eyes; yes, he could, and in retaliation he pressed, \u201cYes, what?\u201d</p><p>Hecate hesitated, slowly reaching towards me to clutch my hand in hers. <i>I\u2019m sorry, Mistress\u2026</i></p><p>Taking a deep breath, I unclenched my jaw and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be good for Mistress Bela.\u201d</p><p>Bela smiled and while I felt Crowley\u2019s mild triumph, his expression didn\u2019t change. \u201cI\u2019ll expect you to behave for her, in addition to playing your part and keeping an eye on the court. If she tells me you\u2019re being difficult, consider today an idea of your punishment. If she says you\u2019re being a good pet\u2026you know how I reward those who make me happy.\u201d</p><p>Hecate squirmed and I apologized, <i>I didn\u2019t know it would be like this, Katie.</i></p><p><i>It\u2019s fine, Missy,</i> she replied. </p><p><i>No, it\u2019s not.</i> \u201cHecate is sensitive to certain factors,\u201d I said. \u201cShe finds certain acts distasteful, and I expose her to those factors as little as possible to keep from upsetting her. Doing so on purpose is uncalled for and <i>highly</i> disrespectful.\u201d I paused a beat for emphasis, then added a snide, \u201cYour Majesty.\u201d</p><p><i>If you\u2019re going to fuck me, don\u2019t you dare do it in front of her.</i> The words went unspoken, but no one missed them. I had no idea if I had enough leverage to keep pushing, but it was clear enough that when it came to my familiar, I was ready to fight. I read a measure of respect in Bela\u2019s eyes, but all Crowley said was, \u201cBehave yourself, and we won\u2019t have to worry about that, will we?\u201d</p><p><i>I don\u2019t like this, Missy,</i> Hecate said. <i>You\u2019ve made yourself too vulnerable for my sake. He\u2019ll use me against you.</i></p><p><i>You were willing to risk yourself for me, Katie, </i>I replied. <i>I won\u2019t do any less for you.</i></p><p><i>And he knows that now. I\u2019ll be his leverage to get what he wants from you.</i></p><p>There was a cold feeling in my stomach as the truth of her words sank in. I didn\u2019t regret standing up for her, but Crowley would have no problem threatening her to force my cooperation. She was never afraid for herself, but I knew the thought of what he could make me do to keep her safe would torment her.</p><p>He still looked at me like he expected further resistance, if not now then later. And if he tried to harm Hecate, he <i>should</i> expect it. I had gotten the best of him once and doubtless he would try to keep it from happening a second time\u2026but if I could do it once, then I could do it again. I was bound and collared, not broken. </p><p>It wouldn\u2019t be easy, but that didn\u2019t scare me. I had always preferred high stakes.</p><p>###</p><p>Tagging: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7oqEXOtRpkDhNq-fdhRYKA\">@flames-bring-a-ton-of-ash</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKJSQKWDbQH5l1JZW64FKww\">@rckyfrk</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moYGcX4XCTZAvCoJ0S6w6xw\">@loveforfilm</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moFXmc6XvPiB1RgXTA1JujQ\">@lostgirl14480</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5TqgC0JFsZpbRt96Wn5oNg\">@alahmorah</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6mGCc1B_HYeWxDxOe4xiTg\">@chamberofsloths</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCNKbeDIf_xeVGKW4UQsdWA\">@frenchhedonism</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlPh6SD7ldaHcKaTG207Wrw\">@gingersnap3344</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNyc84TaeXXm8KMC5hme3uQ\">@letsby</a></p><p>Likes are cool, reblogs are better!

Trying to figure out which?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Trying to figure out who he&rsquo;s got keeping eyes on me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you trust me, your Highness?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Does Crowley?&rdquo;</p><p>Hecate sat up a little straighter, and I knew we were on the same page.</p><p>Bela shrugged carelessly. &ldquo;Crowley doesn&rsquo;t trust anybody. He knows them. He knows who will turn on him, who will suck up to gain favor, who will follow orders&hellip; You get the idea. He doesn&rsquo;t <i>need</i> to trust if he understands the game pieces, how they move, and how to play them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So, are you a pawn, a rook, or what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m whatever he needs, whenever he needs it.&rdquo;</p><p><i>A queen, then? </i>I asked Hecate.</p><p><i>That sounds like the implication, </i>she answered. <i>A wild card, at the absolute least.</i></p><p><i>We&rsquo;ll have to keep an eye on her.</i></p><p><i>Agreed</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;It sounds like he trusts you, after all,&rdquo; I went on.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve proved myself,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;He knows I won&rsquo;t cross him unless there&rsquo;s enough in it for me, and he&rsquo;s made sure it would take a steep price.&rdquo;</p><p><i>She&rsquo;s important enough to buy,</i> Hecate remarked. <i>But is she important enough to share valuable information with?</i></p><p>&ldquo;So, because you&rsquo;ve proved yourself, you get assigned to bring the queen back to the castle.&rdquo;</p><p>Just when I thought she couldn&rsquo;t look any more superior, she raised the bar. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not stupid enough to let it get out that a witch-in-training scammed her way out of a deal and onto the throne,&rdquo; she replied smoothly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not about to destabilize him any further when it&rsquo;s no secret his rule is in jeopardy. Not if I can help it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s made it worth your loyalty to help keep him in power?&rdquo;</p><p>She leaned back into the chair, her eyes hardening. &ldquo;I understand you&rsquo;re new here, <i>your Highness,</i> and you might not have picked up a brochure at the welcoming center, so I&rsquo;ll try to clue you in. Hell is a mess. Earth missed the apocalypse but we had a coup. <i>Everyone</i> thought Lucifer would win his final showdown, but Crowley was moving against him long before then, and as soon as Lucifer was eliminated, Crowley stepped up. He had a new vision for Hell and he made it happen, putting an end to a lot of the old ways. And most recently, a Knight of Hell stood to challenge him, promising a return to the golden age and then some.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you have any idea how many enemies he has? How many want him dead and out of the picture? What do you think will happen to those loyal to him if he falls? What do you think will happen to <i>you?</i> If Crowley isn&rsquo;t worth my loyalty, he&rsquo;s certainly worth my self-preservation, and if you&rsquo;re as clever as you believe you are, you&rsquo;ll come around to that line of thinking.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Well</i>, Hecate concluded, <i>she&rsquo;s</i> definitely <i>Crowley&rsquo;s</i>.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t respond to either of them, shifting uncomfortably where I sat. I was so <i>hot!</i> I rested my palm against my forehead and my skin was scorching to the touch. Was this the demon blood, or his fire affinity?</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get used to it.&rdquo;</p><p>I gave a start at the sound of his voice and beside me, Hecate did the same. Crowley stood just a few feet away, closing the distance to where we sat. Bela moved to stand as he approached, but he motioned for her to keep her seat and regarded me. His expression was neutral, and I couldn&rsquo;t sense anything from him beyond that pacified feeling. He didn&rsquo;t repeat himself, but the quirk of his eyebrow as I continued to fidget with the heat in my flesh was clue enough to guess what he was talking about.</p><p>Maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t have been surprised <i>he</i> could guess my disturbance.</p><p>&ldquo;Bela, sweetheart,&rdquo; he said, walking between us and settling into a vacant chair, &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;ve met Endora.&rdquo;</p><p>She turned to me with a spark of amusement in her eyes. &ldquo;Endora?&rdquo; she repeated, laughter coloring her voice. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Samantha?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Having an emotional heart-to-heart with Squirrel, last I checked,&rdquo; Crowley replied. He turned his eyes on Hecate, sitting next to me and taking in every word spoken. &ldquo;And this must be the familiar.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hecate,&rdquo; I said, his dismissive tone already rubbing me the wrong way.</p><p>He gave me an ironic look. &ldquo;Really? A witch&rsquo;s companion named <i>Hecate?</i> You couldn&rsquo;t come up with something original?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t name me,&rdquo; Katie corrected him.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not my pet,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;and everything you have against me has nothing to do with her, so don&rsquo;t be an ass.&rdquo;</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. &ldquo;Is this your first edict as queen?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not a second class citizen, and anyone that tries to treat her that way will answer to me.&rdquo;</p><p>He stared at me for a long moment and I stared back, refusing to be intimidated. He could punish, torture, do whatever he wanted to me, but if he thought I would let him disrespect Katie, he thought wrong.</p><p>I only identified the flash of approval I felt for what it was by the smile he gave me. &ldquo;Make a note of it, Bela,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Hecate is to be afforded the utmost respect by order of the Queen. Anyone in violation of that command is hers to deal with.&rdquo;</p><p>Bela gave a brief nod. &ldquo;Of course, your Majesty.&rdquo;</p><p><i>They&rsquo;re laughing at you</i>, Hecate said in a small voice.</p><p><i>I don&rsquo;t care,</i> I replied firmly. <i>He can leave you out of his problem with me.</i></p><p>&ldquo;As for your cover,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that will take some consideration. One mistake, and we&rsquo;re all screwed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re actually going along with this spy thing?&rdquo; Bela questioned.</p><p>&ldquo;She bargained for the job, love. Begging on hands and knees, she wanted it so bad.&rdquo;</p><p>I glared at him, ignoring Bela&rsquo;s smug look and the traitorous stirring in my body at his words. He looked at me like he knew exactly what he was doing to me and went on, &ldquo;She drove such a good bargain, and I daresay she enjoyed our negotiations even more than I did. She was certainly satisfied with my terms.&rdquo;</p><p>Hecate chose tactful silence and I kept glaring. He didn&rsquo;t look away, that arrogant light in his eyes unwavering. My insides burned with humiliation and hunger; his voice alone would be enough to get me going, but the innuendos calling back everything he did to me the night before were another level of torment. That he talked of it openly was mortifying&hellip;and turning me on more than I would have preferred under the circumstances. And he <i>knew</i>, the petty bastard.</p><p>A slight smirk, and he continued, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the idea of you running amok, so Bela here will keep an eye on you as much as possible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How is that a good cover?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be her pet.&rdquo; He snapped his fingers and something tightened around my neck. Startled, I lifted my hands and groped at it, feeling supple leather and a steel buckle beneath my fingers.</p><p>A collar. The son of a bitch put <i>a collar</i> on me.</p><p>&ldquo;Mistress Bela likes witches,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She enjoyed scamming her fair share back in the day, and now she has one at her beck and call. How does that sound, Bela, darling?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too generous, your Majesty,&rdquo; she replied, winking at me.</p><p>&ldquo;Generous?&rdquo; I said, outraged. &ldquo;Are you insane?&rdquo; I fumbled at the buckle but the leather fused together where it overlapped, fastened securely.</p><p>&ldquo;That collar doesn&rsquo;t come off until I say so,&rdquo; Crowley said, &ldquo;and as long as you&rsquo;re wearing it, you&rsquo;ll do exactly as your new mistress says. Understood?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not doing this!&rdquo; I drew on my magic to cut through the leather and felt a ripple of heat at the edges of my power, and before I could make the cut my hand froze in place. His power holding me was hot and my cut palm burned in echo, but when I focused my awareness on the magic, the separate lines were woven together, building off each other even as they clashed.</p><p>&ldquo;Think about it, Broomhilda,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t survive court on your own, much less Hell. This keeps you close enough to my circle to keep you untouchable but far enough away that no one will suspect you. You can cooperate, or I can put some spellwork into that collar to keep you obedient whether you like it or not. Your choice, love.&rdquo;</p><p>I stopped fighting his grip despite the anger still simmering in my veins. Hecate rested her hand on my arm, tentative, and said, <i>It&hellip;it makes sense, Missy. I know you don&rsquo;t like it, but I think you should go along with it.</i></p><p><i>You want me to debase and degrade myself?</i> I asked.</p><p><i>I want you to do whatever keeps you safest of your own free will, rather than be a complete puppet.</i></p><p>The collar was by no means tight, but I felt as if it was choking me. I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to agree to this. The deal for my power was to claim autonomy, not to hand it away down the line.</p><p>Crowley honed in on me, leaning toward me in his chair, with his elbows on his knees and his fingers laced together. &ldquo;We had a deal, Endora,&rdquo; he said, his voice low and firm. &ldquo;You hold up your end, or I hold up mine. Take it or leave it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She seems defiant, your Majesty,&rdquo; Bela remarked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure I appreciate that in my pets.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; he assured her, &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll come around.&rdquo; He leaned back again and waved his fingers, watching me expectantly.</p><p>I had a moment to wonder what he was doing before there was a rush of sensation at my clit, something teasing and stroking with a precision bordering on deliberation. Almost immediately, my spine bowed and my hips bucked into it, and I clutched at the arm of the sofa as a moan burst from me unchecked.</p><p>Hecate&rsquo;s eyes widened in alarm and she tightened her grip on my arm. &ldquo;Are you okay, Missy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Missy, is it?&rdquo; Bela asked. She seemed unfazed, watching me squirm without a trace of emotion. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to remember that one.&rdquo;</p><p>I couldn&rsquo;t answer, my eyes locked with Crowley&rsquo;s as the sensation intensified. I had no control, my body writhing and every sound growing harder and harder to hold back. He didn&rsquo;t look away, staring like a cat intent on a mouse while my pleasure rose higher with alarming momentum.</p><p>Hecate paused as she slowly understood what was happening, then glanced from me to Crowley and back again, looking awkward. She had never been comfortable with the idea of sex, or sexuality as a whole, finding it personally disturbing. Her bonding with a deviant like me seemed like a cruel trick of fate, and I tried to shield her from it as much as possible. I never allowed my graphic thoughts or memories anywhere near her and spared her details of my exploits, and we each respected each other&rsquo;s needs while seeing to our own.</p><p>Crowley had no such reservations.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; I said, gasping; the sensation escalated almost to its peak and halted, keeping me at the point of near-climax. I reached for Hecate&rsquo;s hand, seeing the revulsion in her eyes and trying to reassure her. Her body tensed and she nearly flinched away from me, hands moving to cover her ears and drown me out. <i>I&rsquo;m sorry,</i> she said, frightened and upset, <i>I&rsquo;m sorry, I can't&hellip;</i> She turned away and ducked her head, humming to herself so she couldn&rsquo;t hear me.</p><p>I was nearly out of my mind with it, unable to sit still, unable to come, hurting for my familiar and cursing Crowley. It was a perfect torture, having seen what a shameless, pleading mess I devolved to the night before, and it wouldn&rsquo;t harm him as well like this morning. But it was seeing Katie so wretched that struck the real blow. </p><p>I threw my head back and cried out again, and he shuddered where he sat, something in his gaze shifting. I was wound tight enough to snap, digging my nails into my palms until the skin broke, and he clenched a fist, his jaw tightening and an intense look in his eyes. It was agony, feeling so much yet never allowed release, an agony he mirrored, and neither of the others saw it. </p><p>&ldquo;Crowley,&rdquo; I pleaded, &ldquo;stop&hellip;&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t handle any more, and the closer I got to unraveling, the clearer it was he was close behind. &ldquo;Crowley, please!&rdquo; I nearly screamed.</p><p>He waved his hand again; everything stopped but the tension in my body didn&rsquo;t abate. He sat rigid and unmoving, on the same edge as I was. &ldquo;Last chance, pet,&rdquo; he said, a rough tremor in his voice giving him away, &ldquo;are you going to be a good girl for Mistress Bela?&rdquo;</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t letting <i>me</i> off the hook, then. He bruised my pride, humiliated me, and distressed my familiar, but he wasn&rsquo;t about to embarrass himself. I wanted to defy him out of spite, but for Hecate&rsquo;s sake I yielded. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied, hoping he could feel the seething ire coiling in my chest.</p><p>He narrowed his eyes; yes, he could, and in retaliation he pressed, &ldquo;Yes, what?&rdquo;</p><p>Hecate hesitated, slowly reaching towards me to clutch my hand in hers. <i>I&rsquo;m sorry, Mistress&hellip;</i></p><p>Taking a deep breath, I unclenched my jaw and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be good for Mistress Bela.&rdquo;</p><p>Bela smiled and while I felt Crowley&rsquo;s mild triumph, his expression didn&rsquo;t change. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll expect you to behave for her, in addition to playing your part and keeping an eye on the court. If she tells me you&rsquo;re being difficult, consider today an idea of your punishment. If she says you&rsquo;re being a good pet&hellip;you know how I reward those who make me happy.&rdquo;</p><p>Hecate squirmed and I apologized, <i>I didn&rsquo;t know it would be like this, Katie.</i></p><p><i>It&rsquo;s fine, Missy,</i> she replied. </p><p><i>No, it&rsquo;s not.</i> &ldquo;Hecate is sensitive to certain factors,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;She finds certain acts distasteful, and I expose her to those factors as little as possible to keep from upsetting her. Doing so on purpose is uncalled for and <i>highly</i> disrespectful.&rdquo; I paused a beat for emphasis, then added a snide, &ldquo;Your Majesty.&rdquo;</p><p><i>If you&rsquo;re going to fuck me, don&rsquo;t you dare do it in front of her.</i> The words went unspoken, but no one missed them. I had no idea if I had enough leverage to keep pushing, but it was clear enough that when it came to my familiar, I was ready to fight. I read a measure of respect in Bela&rsquo;s eyes, but all Crowley said was, &ldquo;Behave yourself, and we won&rsquo;t have to worry about that, will we?&rdquo;</p><p><i>I don&rsquo;t like this, Missy,</i> Hecate said. <i>You&rsquo;ve made yourself too vulnerable for my sake. He&rsquo;ll use me against you.</i></p><p><i>You were willing to risk yourself for me, Katie, </i>I replied. <i>I won&rsquo;t do any less for you.</i></p><p><i>And he knows that now. I&rsquo;ll be his leverage to get what he wants from you.</i></p><p>There was a cold feeling in my stomach as the truth of her words sank in. I didn&rsquo;t regret standing up for her, but Crowley would have no problem threatening her to force my cooperation. She was never afraid for herself, but I knew the thought of what he could make me do to keep her safe would torment her.</p><p>He still looked at me like he expected further resistance, if not now then later. And if he tried to harm Hecate, he <i>should</i> expect it. I had gotten the best of him once and doubtless he would try to keep it from happening a second time&hellip;but if I could do it once, then I could do it again. I was bound and collared, not broken. </p><p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be easy, but that didn&rsquo;t scare me. I had always preferred high stakes.</p><p>###</p><p>Tagging: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7oqEXOtRpkDhNq-fdhRYKA\">@flames-bring-a-ton-of-ash</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKJSQKWDbQH5l1JZW64FKww\">@rckyfrk</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moYGcX4XCTZAvCoJ0S6w6xw\">@loveforfilm</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moFXmc6XvPiB1RgXTA1JujQ\">@lostgirl14480</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5TqgC0JFsZpbRt96Wn5oNg\">@alahmorah</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6mGCc1B_HYeWxDxOe4xiTg\">@chamberofsloths</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCNKbeDIf_xeVGKW4UQsdWA\">@frenchhedonism</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlPh6SD7ldaHcKaTG207Wrw\">@gingersnap3344</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNyc84TaeXXm8KMC5hme3uQ\">@letsby</a></p><p>Likes are cool, reblogs are better!
