        "answer": "<p>It\u2019s pretty bullshit, yeah. <a href=\"http://asoiafuniversity.tumblr.com/post/180014312529/thenightsmellsofjasmine-starks-never-have-a\">The North is\u2026 not exactly spectacular re gender roles and women\u2019s rights.</a> There is <i>some</i> good, mind you. <a href=\"http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/post/26164947056/rcarlisle-seriously-like-for-real\">The Mormont ladies are warrior women</a>, but they pretty much have to be, due to their harsh climate and fear of raids from the ironborn. Possibly some of the mountain clans and far north houses (e.g. Umber) may raise their women similar to wildling spearwives, due to the fact they\u2019re basically the same ethnicity and culture as the wildlings, and also to defend themselves from being kidnapped by wildling <i>men</i>. And we know that the Starks\u2019 great-grandmother, Arya Flint of the mountain clans, is the reason why Bran was so good at climbing per Old Nan.<br/></p><p>But in general? No, it\u2019s not progressive at all. <a href=\"https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Various_questions_concerning_Tywin_Oberyn_Gregor_the_North_and_Sansa\">House Stark has never had a ruling Lady of Winterfell or Queen in the North in all its 8000 years of existence</a>. And there\u2019s two examples we know for certain where that was <i>deliberately</i> removed as a possibility:</p><ul><li>the possibly legendary Brandon Stark \u201cthe Daughterless\u201d, whose only child, the \u201cBlue Rose of Winterfell\u201d, was kidnapped by the wildling Bael the Bard (but they supposedly fell in love), and her <i>son</i> became the next Lord Stark</li><li>the situations of Serena and Sansa Stark, daughters and only children of the eldest son of Cregan Stark\u2026 and after he died, it seems likely <a href=\"http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/post/123716008763/i-know-i-sent-you-an-ask-just-a-couple-of-hours\">they were forcefully married to their half-uncles so that they could steal the inheritance from them</a>, with other inheritance problems following afterwards.<br/></li></ul><p>Though, to be fair, there have been other ruling ladies in a few other Northern houses (currently Jonelle Cerwyn and Lyessa Flint at least), and Winterfell women have served as the equivalent of regents at some points. <a href=\"http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/post/173573650673/hi-im-writing-a-thesis-on-the-women-of-asoiaf\">Ned intended Catelyn to rule Winterfell while he was in King\u2019s Landing</a>, that she would train Robb to rule and make him part of <i>her</i> councils (but unfortunately Bran\u2019s accident kept her from doing so). And apparently there\u2019s a story regarding \u201cthe She-Wolves of Winterfell\u201d, a group of fierce Stark ladies (wives, widows, mothers, and grandmothers), who may have ruled Winterfell during a time when Lord Beron Stark was dying of wounds taken while fighting the ironborn. (GRRM intended for this unfinished Dunk &amp; Egg story to be part of the <i>Dangerous Women</i> anthology, but unfortunately he couldn\u2019t finish it in time and they used an excerpt from his <i>Fire &amp; Blood</i> writings instead.) <br/></p><p>And there are certainly fierce northern ladies, who aren\u2019t warriors like the Mormonts, but do their best to defend their rights for the dignity of their house and their loyalty to House Stark, such as Alys Karstark and Wylla Manderly. Alys fled to the Wall to prevent an unwanted marriage from her scheming uncles (who were planning on selling out her older brother to the Lannisters and Stannis to the Boltons); and Wylla bravely defended Robb\u2019s memory and the Manderly history of loyalty, despite her supposedly Lannister/Bolton-loyal grandfather and her Frey betrothed.

And there&rsquo;s two examples we know for certain where that was <i>deliberately</i> removed as a possibility:</p><ul><li>the possibly legendary Brandon Stark &ldquo;the Daughterless&rdquo;, whose only child, the &ldquo;Blue Rose of Winterfell&rdquo;, was kidnapped by the wildling Bael the Bard (but they supposedly fell in love), and her <i>son</i> became the next Lord Stark</li><li>the situations of Serena and Sansa Stark, daughters and only children of the eldest son of Cregan Stark&hellip; and after he died, it seems likely <a href=\"http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/post/123716008763/i-know-i-sent-you-an-ask-just-a-couple-of-hours\">they were forcefully married to their half-uncles so that they could steal the inheritance from them</a>, with other inheritance problems following afterwards.<br /></li></ul><p>Though, to be fair, there have been other ruling ladies in a few other Northern houses (currently Jonelle Cerwyn and Lyessa Flint at least), and Winterfell women have served as the equivalent of regents at some points. <a href=\"http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/post/173573650673/hi-im-writing-a-thesis-on-the-women-of-asoiaf\">Ned intended Catelyn to rule Winterfell while he was in King&rsquo;s Landing</a>, that she would train Robb to rule and make him part of <i>her</i> councils (but unfortunately Bran&rsquo;s accident kept her from doing so). And apparently there&rsquo;s a story regarding &ldquo;the She-Wolves of Winterfell&rdquo;, a group of fierce Stark ladies (wives, widows, mothers, and grandmothers), who may have ruled Winterfell during a time when Lord Beron Stark was dying of wounds taken while fighting the ironborn. (GRRM intended for this unfinished Dunk &amp; Egg story to be part of the <i>Dangerous Women</i> anthology, but unfortunately he couldn&rsquo;t finish it in time and they used an excerpt from his <i>Fire &amp; Blood</i> writings instead.) <br /></p><p>And there are certainly fierce northern ladies, who aren&rsquo;t warriors like the Mormonts, but do their best to defend their rights for the dignity of their house and their loyalty to House Stark, such as Alys Karstark and Wylla Manderly. Alys fled to the Wall to prevent an unwanted marriage from her scheming uncles (who were planning on selling out her older brother to the Lannisters and Stannis to the Boltons); and Wylla bravely defended Robb&rsquo;s memory and the Manderly history of loyalty, despite her supposedly Lannister/Bolton-loyal grandfather and her Frey betrothed. (She didn&rsquo;t know her grandfather had secret plans to deal with the Freys and Boltons, but had a honest and fierce reaction regardless; also note her older sister Wynafryd, who was told the plans, but had to pretend to go along with everything including pretending to be happy about her own upcoming Frey marriage.) And of course there&rsquo;s Lyanna Stark, who at 14 defended her father&rsquo;s bannerman, young Howland Reed, from being assaulted by asshole bigots, and <a href=\"http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/post/64662945112/ive-been-reading-your-asoiaf-theories-for-hours\">acted in disguise as a mystery knight to further chastise them</a>.<br /></p><p>However&hellip; when it comes down to it, and specifically regarding the recent generations of House Stark, let me give you these quotes:</p><blockquote><p><small><b>Q:</b> How closely does Westeros resemble the real Middle Ages in terms \nof social customs and gender roles? For example, would highborn ladies \nhave been expected to bathe guests and know how to make cheese, etc.? \nSansa&rsquo;s education and training seemed rather impractical - did the fault\n lie with her parents or were all young ladies raised like that?</small></p><p><small><b>GRRM:</b> Sansa\n is more than just a young lady. &nbsp;She&rsquo;s the daughter, not just of a \nnoble, but of one of the most powerful nobles in Westeros. &nbsp;The great \nhouses stand far above the lesser nobles, as the lesser nobles do above \nthe smallfolk. She would not make cheese, no. But Arya might think it would be fun.</small></p><p><small>&ndash;<a href=\"http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/post/30902364063/other-grrm-responses-in-that-forum-that-i-find\">source</a></small></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><small>&ldquo;Lyanna might have carried a sword, <b>if my lord father had allowed it</b>.&rdquo; <br />&ndash;Ned Stark, AGOT, Arya II</small><br /></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><small>[Bran&rsquo;s weirwood vision of the past, of Lyanna and Benjen:] \nNow two children danced across the godswood, hooting at one another as \nthey dueled with broken branches. The girl was the older and taller of \nthe two. <i>Arya! </i>Bran thought eagerly, as he watched her leap up onto a \nrock and cut at the boy. But that couldn&rsquo;t be right. If the girl was \nArya, the boy was Bran himself, and he had never worn his hair so long. \n<i>And Arya never beat me playing swords, the way that girl is beating him.</i>\n She slashed the boy across his thigh, so hard that his leg went out \nfrom under him and he fell into the pool and began to splash and shout. \n&ldquo;You be quiet, stupid,&rdquo; the girl said, tossing her own branch aside. \n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just water. Do you want Old Nan to hear and <b>run</b> <b>tell</b> <b>Father</b>?&rdquo; &ndash;ADWD, Bran III</small><br /></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><small>&ldquo;[I]t is past time that Arya learned the ways of a southron court. In a few years she will be of an age to marry too.&rdquo; &ndash;Ned Stark, AGOT, Catelyn II</small><br /></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n<small>&ldquo;[Bran] was going to be a knight,&rdquo; Arya was saying now. &ldquo;A knight of the Kingsguard. Can he still be a knight?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Ned said. He saw no use in lying to her. &ldquo;Yet someday he may\n be the lord of a great holdfast and sit on the king&rsquo;s council. He might\n raise castles like Brandon the Builder, or sail a ship across the \nSunset Sea, or enter your mother&rsquo;s Faith and become the High Septon.&rdquo;\n <i>But he will never run beside his wolf again</i>, he thought with a sadness \ntoo deep for words, <i>or lie with a woman, or hold his own son in his arms</i>.<br />Arya cocked her head to one side. &ldquo;Can I be a king&rsquo;s councillor and build castles and become the High Septon?&rdquo;<br /> &ldquo;You,&rdquo; Ned said, kissing her lightly on the brow, &ldquo;will marry a king and rule his castle, and <b>your sons</b> will be knights and princes and lords and, yes, perhaps even a High Septon.&rdquo;</small></p><p><small>&ndash;AGOT, Eddard V</small><br /></p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/post/173573650673/hi-im-writing-a-thesis-on-the-women-of-asoiaf\">It&rsquo;s not Catelyn with the restrictive views of gender roles</a>. It&rsquo;s the men of House Stark. I hope that helps!</p>",

(What they did to Bran is blasphemy, my boy didn\u2019t deserve that.) </p><p>I\u2019m pretty much just watching because hey, new material and a lot of curiosity since I\u2019ve dedicated almost a decade of my life to this.
