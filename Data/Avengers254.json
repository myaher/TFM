He and\nthe other Avengers were crouched behind a van in the middle of the city. (Y/N) and\nSteve had gone ahead, to try and get her closer to Bucky so she could read his\nmind and figure out his plan. Now, she was back with news. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m positive. He plans to take down that building there,\u201d\nshe pointed across the street to a high-rise office block, \u201cin twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe best get into position,\u201d Clint said. He motioned for Nat\nto join him, Bruce following close behind, looking more skittish than usual.\nClint was going to wait on the building opposite, in the hope that he could get\na clear shot if Bucky went straight for the entrance. Nat and Bruce would hide\nout in the lobby of the building, for the first round of attack. They just had\nto hope that the big, green guy was in the mood for fighting. </p><!-- more --><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be on the second floor, with Vision and Wanda,\u201d Tony\ngestured to himself and Thor. \u201cReindeer Games, you stay here for now. We\u2019ll\ncall you if we need you.\u201d Much to Loki\u2019s disgust, Tony handed him a walky-talky.\n</p><p>\u201cI must admit, I\u2019m not a fan of being treated like a child,\u201d\nhe huffed. </p><p>\u201cYou try and take over the world and this is what you get.\nIt\u2019s either be back-up or being locked in a padded cell. Your choice,\u201d Tony\nreplied. </p><p>\u201cSteve and I will stand by the door. Hopefully we can get\nBucky to listen to him,\u201d (Y/N) squeezed Steve\u2019s hand as she spoke. </p><p>Tony grimaced at the thought of his daughter being in a\nbattle, but he had been outvoted. The only choice now was to fight. \u201cLet\u2019s move\nout kids.\u201d</p><p>The Avengers took their positions, with Loki lounging on a\nbench, sulking. He pretended to be completely disinterested in the situation,\nbut secretly he was hurt at being told to sit out. </p><p>The supposed battle seemed to happen ridiculously fast.\nClint saw Bucky coming a mile off and whistled to alert the others. Cap and (Y/N)\nbraced themselves for an attack, but it never came. Bucky appeared in front of\nthem for a split second, enough to catch Steve\u2019s eye, before vanishing into seemingly\nthin air. Clint didn\u2019t get a clean enough shot and one of his flaming arrows\nwhooshed past (Y/N)\u2019s ear. She ducked as it exploded into the window of the\nbuilding. Bucky must have still been close, as she caught a glimpse into his\nmind. </p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d she muttered. She turned to Steve, her face\nwashed-out, \u201cWe need to get everyone out of the building. It was a trap.\u201d</p><p>Steve barely had time to comprehend her words before the\nfirst explosion went off on the third floor. Glass flew in all directions and\nlittered the street. Steve grabbed (Y/N) and pulled her close to him,\nprotecting her head with his arms. Hulk came charging through the lobby, Nat in\nhand. Steve released his grip on (Y/N) long enough for her to realise she couldn\u2019t\nread her dad\u2019s mind. Without thinking, she rushed inside, screaming out to him.\n\u201cDad! Dad, where are you?\u201d She made a beeline for the nearest staircase, but\njust as she reached the foot, the next bomb went off. The stairwell crumbled\nunder the impact of the blast. (Y/N)\u2019s yells became shriller, as desperation\nset in. her voice was joined by Steve\u2019s, trying to find her amongst the\nsettling dust. Her voice grew hoarse and she could barely manage to call out\nanymore. That was when a red light illuminated what was left of the room. Vision\nappeared, with Wanda close behind. In his arms was a lifeless Tony. His face\nwas cut and bleeding. His armour was dented and scraped. Upon seeing this,\n(Y/N) lost all sense of reality. She broke into uncontrollable sobs, reaching\nher arms out to her father. Vision shook his head, \u201cWe need to get him to a hospital,\nnow.\u201d </p><p>Steve took (Y/N)\u2019s arm and pulled her back outside. \u201cWe\u2019ll\ntake you home and call Pepper,\u201d he said, as soothingly as he possibly could.\n(Y/N) had no fight left in her, so let herself be led away. She didn\u2019t even\nnotice when Thor appeared from the wreckage and when Loki immediately joined\nhis brother\u2019s side. The car journey back to the Avengers facility was silent.\n(Y/N)\u2019s eyes had glazed over. No one dared speak. Vision and Wanda were probably\nalready at the hospital. The only sound was Steve, speaking in hushed tones on\nthe phone to Pepper, \u201cYes, they\u2019ve taken him to the hospital\u2026 I think she\u2019s just\nin shock\u2026 We\u2019ll get her home safe, I promise\u2026 Okay\u2026 See you soon.\u201d </p><p>It wasn\u2019t until (Y/N) was being tucked into her bed, a wet\nflannel wiping away the dust from her face, that she decided to speak. Her words\nwere croaky, \u201cIt\u2019s my fault. It\u2019s all my fault.\u201d</p><p>Steve placed the flannel down and pulled his girlfriend to\nhis chest, \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. You weren\u2019t to know. You were just trying to\nhelp. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>(Y/N) shook her head, clutching at his shirt. \u201cI hurt dad\nand I proved him right. I\u2019m not ready for battle. I\u2019ve ruined everything. He\ncould have\u2026 He could have\u2026\u201d she didn\u2019t finish her sentence, as her voice was\ntaken over by shaky sobs. \u201cPleas go,\u201d she managed, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you\ntoo.\u201d</p><p>Steve shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere. I want to\ntake care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Steve,\u201d she looked up at him, her eyes watery and\nbloodshot, \u201cI need to be alone.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and stood from the bed. \u201cFine, but I\u2019ll be back in\nan hour to check on you.\u201d</p><p>(Y/N) didn\u2019t reply. She led down and pulled the covers over\nher head, hoping they would shield her from the hate she must be getting from\nthe other Avengers and the embarrassment she felt. They had put their trust in\nher and she had failed. She heard the door click, signalling Steve\u2019s exit. (Y/N)\nwaiting a few moments before moving. She needed to get out and clear her head. She\ncouldn\u2019t be around people who had to be so ashamed of her. So, she took a walk.</p><p>There weren\u2019t many places to go around the Avengers\nfacility, as it was in a secluded part of the country. The only place she found\nsolitude was the woods about a mile away. (Y/N) pulled on one of Steve\u2019s\nhoodies, some jogging bottoms and combat boots and made her way out. It wasn\u2019t as\ncold as she\u2019d expected, just brisk.

He and\nthe other Avengers were crouched behind a van in the middle of the city. (Y/N) and\nSteve had gone ahead, to try and get her closer to Bucky so she could read his\nmind and figure out his plan. Now, she was back with news. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m positive. He plans to take down that building there,&rdquo;\nshe pointed across the street to a high-rise office block, &ldquo;in twenty minutes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We best get into position,&rdquo; Clint said. He motioned for Nat\nto join him, Bruce following close behind, looking more skittish than usual.\nClint was going to wait on the building opposite, in the hope that he could get\na clear shot if Bucky went straight for the entrance. Nat and Bruce would hide\nout in the lobby of the building, for the first round of attack. They just had\nto hope that the big, green guy was in the mood for fighting. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be on the second floor, with Vision and Wanda,&rdquo; Tony\ngestured to himself and Thor. &ldquo;Reindeer Games, you stay here for now. We&rsquo;ll\ncall you if we need you.&rdquo; Much to Loki&rsquo;s disgust, Tony handed him a walky-talky.\n</p><p>&ldquo;I must admit, I&rsquo;m not a fan of being treated like a child,&rdquo;\nhe huffed. </p><p>&ldquo;You try and take over the world and this is what you get.\nIt&rsquo;s either be back-up or being locked in a padded cell. Your choice,&rdquo; Tony\nreplied. </p><p>&ldquo;Steve and I will stand by the door. Hopefully we can get\nBucky to listen to him,&rdquo; (Y/N) squeezed Steve&rsquo;s hand as she spoke. </p><p>Tony grimaced at the thought of his daughter being in a\nbattle, but he had been outvoted. The only choice now was to fight. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s move\nout kids.&rdquo;</p><p>The Avengers took their positions, with Loki lounging on a\nbench, sulking. He pretended to be completely disinterested in the situation,\nbut secretly he was hurt at being told to sit out. </p><p>The supposed battle seemed to happen ridiculously fast.\nClint saw Bucky coming a mile off and whistled to alert the others. Cap and (Y/N)\nbraced themselves for an attack, but it never came. Bucky appeared in front of\nthem for a split second, enough to catch Steve&rsquo;s eye, before vanishing into seemingly\nthin air. Clint didn&rsquo;t get a clean enough shot and one of his flaming arrows\nwhooshed past (Y/N)&rsquo;s ear. She ducked as it exploded into the window of the\nbuilding. Bucky must have still been close, as she caught a glimpse into his\nmind. </p><p>&ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; she muttered. She turned to Steve, her face\nwashed-out, &ldquo;We need to get everyone out of the building. It was a trap.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve barely had time to comprehend her words before the\nfirst explosion went off on the third floor. Glass flew in all directions and\nlittered the street. Steve grabbed (Y/N) and pulled her close to him,\nprotecting her head with his arms. Hulk came charging through the lobby, Nat in\nhand. Steve released his grip on (Y/N) long enough for her to realise she couldn&rsquo;t\nread her dad&rsquo;s mind. Without thinking, she rushed inside, screaming out to him.\n&ldquo;Dad! Dad, where are you?&rdquo; She made a beeline for the nearest staircase, but\njust as she reached the foot, the next bomb went off. The stairwell crumbled\nunder the impact of the blast. (Y/N)&rsquo;s yells became shriller, as desperation\nset in. her voice was joined by Steve&rsquo;s, trying to find her amongst the\nsettling dust. Her voice grew hoarse and she could barely manage to call out\nanymore. That was when a red light illuminated what was left of the room. Vision\nappeared, with Wanda close behind. In his arms was a lifeless Tony. His face\nwas cut and bleeding. His armour was dented and scraped. Upon seeing this,\n(Y/N) lost all sense of reality. She broke into uncontrollable sobs, reaching\nher arms out to her father. Vision shook his head, &ldquo;We need to get him to a hospital,\nnow.&rdquo; </p><p>Steve took (Y/N)&rsquo;s arm and pulled her back outside. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll\ntake you home and call Pepper,&rdquo; he said, as soothingly as he possibly could.\n(Y/N) had no fight left in her, so let herself be led away. She didn&rsquo;t even\nnotice when Thor appeared from the wreckage and when Loki immediately joined\nhis brother&rsquo;s side. The car journey back to the Avengers facility was silent.\n(Y/N)&rsquo;s eyes had glazed over. No one dared speak. Vision and Wanda were probably\nalready at the hospital. The only sound was Steve, speaking in hushed tones on\nthe phone to Pepper, &ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;ve taken him to the hospital&hellip; I think she&rsquo;s just\nin shock&hellip; We&rsquo;ll get her home safe, I promise&hellip; Okay&hellip; See you soon.&rdquo; </p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t until (Y/N) was being tucked into her bed, a wet\nflannel wiping away the dust from her face, that she decided to speak. Her words\nwere croaky, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my fault. It&rsquo;s all my fault.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve placed the flannel down and pulled his girlfriend to\nhis chest, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault. You weren&rsquo;t to know. You were just trying to\nhelp. I&rsquo;m proud of you.&rdquo;</p><p>(Y/N) shook her head, clutching at his shirt. &ldquo;I hurt dad\nand I proved him right. I&rsquo;m not ready for battle. I&rsquo;ve ruined everything. He\ncould have&hellip; He could have&hellip;&rdquo; she didn&rsquo;t finish her sentence, as her voice was\ntaken over by shaky sobs. &ldquo;Pleas go,&rdquo; she managed, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hurt you\ntoo.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve shook his head, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going anywhere. I want to\ntake care of you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please, Steve,&rdquo; she looked up at him, her eyes watery and\nbloodshot, &ldquo;I need to be alone.&rdquo;</p><p>He sighed and stood from the bed. &ldquo;Fine, but I&rsquo;ll be back in\nan hour to check on you.&rdquo;</p><p>(Y/N) didn&rsquo;t reply. She led down and pulled the covers over\nher head, hoping they would shield her from the hate she must be getting from\nthe other Avengers and the embarrassment she felt. They had put their trust in\nher and she had failed. She heard the door click, signalling Steve&rsquo;s exit. (Y/N)\nwaiting a few moments before moving. She needed to get out and clear her head. She\ncouldn&rsquo;t be around people who had to be so ashamed of her. So, she took a walk.</p><p>There weren&rsquo;t many places to go around the Avengers\nfacility, as it was in a secluded part of the country. The only place she found\nsolitude was the woods about a mile away. (Y/N) pulled on one of Steve&rsquo;s\nhoodies, some jogging bottoms and combat boots and made her way out. It wasn&rsquo;t as\ncold as she&rsquo;d expected, just brisk. She was so wrapped up in her own thoughts,\nthat she didn&rsquo;t think to read those of anyone who might be following her. </p><p>Bucky watched the girl from behind a tree.
