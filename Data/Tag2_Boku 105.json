He&rsquo;s about to shout your name again but no sound comes out of his mouth as you step foot into the room, exiting your bathroom in only your underwear. </p><p><br /></p><p>Bakugou stumbles backwards, his blush turning 10 times darker.</p><p>You gasp as you notice him, putting a hand on your chest. &ldquo;Bakugou! Why are you- Oh I totally forgot the time I&rsquo;m so sorry!&rdquo; You say but Bakugou&rsquo;s tongue feels tied.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;ll see you downstairs.&rdquo; He manages to choke out after staring at you for a solid minute. You give a him an innocent smile. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright, I&rsquo;ll be done in a minute. You aren&rsquo;t a pervert like Mineta.&rdquo; You chuckle. </p><p>Bakugou shakes his head in shame as he is looking at you exactly like Mineta would. </p><p><br /></p><p>The thing he doesn&rsquo;t know though is that a warmth is spreading through your body and cheeks as his presence is affecting you as well. </p><p><br /></p><p><b>Midoriya Izuku </b></p><p>Midoriya&rsquo;s heart beats fast as he stands in front of your dorm room, his hand half raised for a knock. He&rsquo;s been crushing on you pretty hard and tonight he decided to try to spend some time with you. </p><p>He clutches the book under one of his arms tightly, wanting to show the hero catalog to you. </p><p>Midoriya gets so excited that he forgets to knock, opening your door without warning.</p><p><br /></p><p>Midoriya&rsquo;s heart feels like it&rsquo;s going to give out as he sees you standing in the middle of your room, only covered by your underwear. </p><p>You gasp loudly and put up a shirt in front of your chest, turning to face him. Your concerned facial expression drops as you see who it is, showing him a small smile. &ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s you Deku. I thought you were Mineta for a moment.&rdquo; You say and Midoriya quickly moves back towards the door. &ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m sorry! Goodnight!&rdquo; He says. He freezes in surprise however when he hears you laugh. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine silly! Like I said, you aren&rsquo;t Mineta, so it&rsquo;s all good.&rdquo; You say but Midoriya can&rsquo;t help but turn beet red as he faces you again. </p><p>&ldquo;What do you have there?&rdquo; You ask, pointing at his book.</p><p>&ldquo;A-Ah it&rsquo;s the newest hero catalog.&rdquo; Midoriya explains, a proud look appearing on his face. Your cheeks heat up and your heart skips a bit at how cute this is to you. &ldquo;No way! That&rsquo;s awesome!&rdquo; You say, only making the sparkles in Midoriya&rsquo;s eyes brighter.</p>",

        "body": "<p><b>Previously on BnHA:</b>\nMy formerly-adopted-but-now-I\u2019m-not-so-sure adult son Hawks went out for lunch\nwith everyone\u2019s favorite scary man and #1 trash dad (with trash not being used\nin the endearing way), Endeavor! They stopped a grown man from flashing his coworkers,\nsaved the world\u2019s dumbest dog from certain death, and signed some autographs. Eventually\nthey actually sat down to eat, and Hawks explained that he\u2019d been\nquietly investigating rumors of Noumu sightings across the country, but had yet\nto find any proof. He said that rumors like that tend to spread when society is\nfearful, and he wants Endeavor to become a number one hero that people can\ndepend on, so that he and the other heroes can relax. At this exact moment, a\nfucking Noumu appeared out of nowhere and flew through their fucking window.\nObviously this is <i>not</i> a coincidence\nand can\u2019t possibly be, but I have yet to piece together exactly what\u2019s going\non. But anyways, now Endeavor is fighting this Noumu. Oh and I forgot to\nmention that it\u2019s the talking Noumu with the Kurogiri face. So yeah, still\nwanting to know what\u2019s up with that.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA: </b>We catch up with Todoroki\u2019s mom and two of his older siblings, Natsuo and Fuyumi. This being the Todorokis, it isn\u2019t too long before the conversation gets melodramatic, with Natsu bringing up Endeavor\u2019s recent #1 hero ranking. He\u2019s not the biggest fan of his dad for obvious reasons! But in what I don\u2019t doubt is one of the most controversial scenes Horikoshi has ever written, an oddly calm Rei says that although she doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in Endeavor\u2019s heart, she believes that he is trying to face his demons. So then we cut to Endeavor facing something of a literal demon. He tries to blast Talking Noumu with some fire blasts, and in response the Noumu whips him through an entire level of the building. Like he basically turns Endeavor into a human axe, with this fucking skyscraper being the tree. So that\u2019s fun. Meanwhile Hawks keeps his cool and reveals his quirk, which gives him full telepathic control of all the feathers on his body and he can shoot them out to save people and shit. So he evacuates everyone using those, and meanwhile Endeavor tries to figure out how he\u2019s gonna take this Noumu down.</p><p><br/></p><p>\n\n(As always, all comments not marked with an ETA are my unspoiled reactions from my first readthrough of this chapter.

Fuyumi is a little bit older. makes me wonder how\nold the Other Brother is</li><li>(ETA: upon reflection, the fact that Fuyumi is three and a half years older than Natsuo makes me think that this is not a coincidence, and Endeavor basically went and made a new kid every time the previous kid\u2019s quirk manifested until he got the desired result. so Touya is probably 3-4 years older than Fuyumi if this is the case)</li><li>also Rei, lovely to see you doing well. and to see your\nother kids visiting at long last. or did they already visit you and Shouto\nwas the only one putting it off for so many years. well either way</li><li>also it\u2019s supposedly December now, I think, so I\u2019m surprised\nthings are only just now starting to cool down. but then I remembered that\nTokyo is quite a bit warmer than where I live, so fair enough. I just googled\nthe average temperature for December and it seems pretty comfortable, with the\nhighs averaging in the mid-50s (Fahrenheit)</li><li>anyway! Fuyumi is complaining that Natsu is never around\nanymore and he has a Secret Girlfriend, probably</li><li>wow these brothers sure aren\u2019t much alike huh</li></ul><p><br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"506\" data-orig-height=\"343\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c6057eecbd515226295608e6f52832de/tumblr_inline_pofe825fPi1r1uxj5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"506\" data-orig-height=\"343\"/></figure><p><br/></p><ul><li>Natsu doesn\u2019t seem to have a trace of red anywhere. probably\npure mom as far as quirk is concerned. although he does bear a physical\nresemblance to his dad, aside from the hair color and the fact that he actually\nsmiles and has facial expressions</li><li>so if anything that\u2019s another point in favor of the \u201cDabi is\na Todoroki\u201d theory. because we\u2019ve got two mostly ice kids, so story-wise it\nwould make sense if the third (and presumably oldest?) kid was a fire kid</li><li>Natsu says their mom is looking very good</li><li>awwww!</li></ul><p><br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"841\" data-orig-height=\"313\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3ac60b27615685ccd0d436e4ef90e7ea/tumblr_inline_pofed6M0p31r1uxj5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"841\" data-orig-height=\"313\"/></figure><p><br/></p><ul><li>I want to read Shouto\u2019s letters so bad. they\u2019re\nprobably comedy gold. like reading a letter written by Data from TNG. \u201cDear\nMother.

They stopped a grown man from flashing his coworkers,\nsaved the world\u2019s dumbest dog from certain death, and signed some autographs. Eventually\nthey actually sat down to eat, and Hawks explained that he\u2019d been\nquietly investigating rumors of Noumu sightings across the country, but had yet\nto find any proof. He said that rumors like that tend to spread when society is\nfearful, and he wants Endeavor to become a number one hero that people can\ndepend on, so that he and the other heroes can relax. At this exact moment, a\nfucking Noumu appeared out of nowhere and flew through their fucking window.\nObviously this is <i>not</i> a coincidence\nand can\u2019t possibly be, but I have yet to piece together exactly what\u2019s going\non. But anyways, now Endeavor is fighting this Noumu. Oh and I forgot to\nmention that it\u2019s the talking Noumu with the Kurogiri face. So yeah, still\nwanting to know what\u2019s up with that.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA: </b>We catch up with Todoroki\u2019s mom and two of his older siblings, Natsuo and Fuyumi. This being the Todorokis, it isn\u2019t too long before the conversation gets melodramatic, with Natsu bringing up Endeavor\u2019s recent #1 hero ranking. He\u2019s not the biggest fan of his dad for obvious reasons! But in what I don\u2019t doubt is one of the most controversial scenes Horikoshi has ever written, an oddly calm Rei says that although she doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in Endeavor\u2019s heart, she believes that he is trying to face his demons. So then we cut to Endeavor facing something of a literal demon. He tries to blast Talking Noumu with some fire blasts, and in response the Noumu whips him through an entire level of the building. Like he basically turns Endeavor into a human axe, with this fucking skyscraper being the tree. So that\u2019s fun. Meanwhile Hawks keeps his cool and reveals his quirk, which gives him full telepathic control of all the feathers on his body and he can shoot them out to save people and shit. So he evacuates everyone using those, and meanwhile Endeavor tries to figure out how he\u2019s gonna take this Noumu down.</p><p><br></p><p>\n\n(As always, all comments not marked with an ETA are my unspoiled reactions from my first readthrough of this chapter.

                "content": "<p><p><b>Previously on BnHA:</b>\nMy formerly-adopted-but-now-I&rsquo;m-not-so-sure adult son Hawks went out for lunch\nwith everyone&rsquo;s favorite scary man and #1 trash dad (with trash not being used\nin the endearing way), Endeavor! They stopped a grown man from flashing his coworkers,\nsaved the world&rsquo;s dumbest dog from certain death, and signed some autographs. Eventually\nthey actually sat down to eat, and Hawks explained that he&rsquo;d been\nquietly investigating rumors of Noumu sightings across the country, but had yet\nto find any proof. He said that rumors like that tend to spread when society is\nfearful, and he wants Endeavor to become a number one hero that people can\ndepend on, so that he and the other heroes can relax. At this exact moment, a\nfucking Noumu appeared out of nowhere and flew through their fucking window.\nObviously this is <i>not</i> a coincidence\nand can&rsquo;t possibly be, but I have yet to piece together exactly what&rsquo;s going\non. But anyways, now Endeavor is fighting this Noumu. Oh and I forgot to\nmention that it&rsquo;s the talking Noumu with the Kurogiri face. So yeah, still\nwanting to know what&rsquo;s up with that.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA: </b>We catch up with Todoroki&rsquo;s mom and two of his older siblings, Natsuo and Fuyumi. This being the Todorokis, it isn&rsquo;t too long before the conversation gets melodramatic, with Natsu bringing up Endeavor&rsquo;s recent #1 hero ranking. He&rsquo;s not the biggest fan of his dad for obvious reasons! But in what I don&rsquo;t doubt is one of the most controversial scenes Horikoshi has ever written, an oddly calm Rei says that although she doesn&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on in Endeavor&rsquo;s heart, she believes that he is trying to face his demons. So then we cut to Endeavor facing something of a literal demon. He tries to blast Talking Noumu with some fire blasts, and in response the Noumu whips him through an entire level of the building. Like he basically turns Endeavor into a human axe, with this fucking skyscraper being the tree. So that&rsquo;s fun. Meanwhile Hawks keeps his cool and reveals his quirk, which gives him full telepathic control of all the feathers on his body and he can shoot them out to save people and shit. So he evacuates everyone using those, and meanwhile Endeavor tries to figure out how he&rsquo;s gonna take this Noumu down.</p><p><br /></p><p>\n\n(As always, all comments not marked with an ETA are my unspoiled reactions from my first readthrough of this chapter.

                "content_abstract": "<p>\n\n<p><b>Previously on BnHA:</b>\nMy formerly-adopted-but-now-I&rsquo;m-not-so-sure adult son Hawks went out for lunch\nwith everyone&rsquo;s favorite scary man and #1 trash dad (with trash not being used\nin the endearing way), Endeavor! They stopped a grown man from flashing his coworkers,\nsaved the world&rsquo;s dumbest dog from certain death, and signed some autographs. Eventually\nthey actually sat down to eat, and Hawks explained that he&rsquo;d been\nquietly investigating rumors of Noumu sightings across the country, but had yet\nto find any proof. He said that rumors like that tend to spread when society is\nfearful, and he wants Endeavor to become a number one hero that people can\ndepend on, so that he and the other heroes can relax. At this exact moment, a\nfucking Noumu appeared out of nowhere and flew through their fucking window.\nObviously this is <i>not</i> a coincidence\nand can&rsquo;t possibly be, but I have yet to piece together exactly what&rsquo;s going\non. But anyways, now Endeavor is fighting this Noumu. Oh and I forgot to\nmention that it&rsquo;s the talking Noumu with the Kurogiri face. So yeah, still\nwanting to know what&rsquo;s up with that.</p>\n<p><b>Today on BnHA: </b>We catch up with Todoroki&rsquo;s mom and two of his older siblings, Natsuo and Fuyumi. This being the Todorokis, it isn&rsquo;t too long before the conversation gets melodramatic, with Natsu bringing up Endeavor&rsquo;s recent #1 hero ranking. He&rsquo;s not the biggest fan of his dad for obvious reasons! But in what I don&rsquo;t doubt is one of the most controversial scenes Horikoshi has ever written, an oddly calm Rei says that although she doesn&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on in Endeavor&rsquo;s heart, she believes that he is trying to face his demons. So then we cut to Endeavor facing something of a literal demon. He tries to blast Talking Noumu with some fire blasts, and in response the Noumu whips him through an entire level of the building. Like he basically turns Endeavor into a human axe, with this fucking skyscraper being the tree. So that&rsquo;s fun. Meanwhile Hawks keeps his cool and reveals his quirk, which gives him full telepathic control of all the feathers on his body and he can shoot them out to save people and shit. So he evacuates everyone using those, and meanwhile Endeavor tries to figure out how he&rsquo;s gonna take this Noumu down.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>\n\n(As always, all comments not marked with an ETA are my unspoiled reactions from my first readthrough of this chapter. I&rsquo;ve read up through chapter 209 now, so any ETAs will reflect that.)<br /></p>\n</p>",
