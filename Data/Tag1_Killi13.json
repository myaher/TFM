It was probably for the best; classes had started in a flurry and Eve found herself more overwhelmed than ever. She desperately needed to focus and not find herself distracted by thoughts of the enchanting woman who was certain to somewhere in Eve\u2019s same building, if she looked hard enough.</p><!-- more --><p>And it worked. Eve only found her head jerking to the side every time she saw blonde hair for the first couple days of classes. After that, she began to relax and assume that she and Oksana were on different schedules. If Oksana wasn\u2019t going to seek her out, Eve certainly wasn\u2019t going to go looking for her. She didn\u2019t have any reason to. It wasn\u2019t like they\u2019d made any plans to see each other again, other than the vague \u201csee you around campus\u201d.</p><p>Oksana had said she\u2019d had fun, but she could have just been being nice. The whole night was probably just her being nice. Any spark Eve thought she had felt between them was certainly just in her head. Oksana was clearly the type of person who exuded a certain flirtatious charm in all of her day to day interactions. Eve was no one special and Eve could accept that. Mostly. She\u2019d just met the woman after all, it wasn\u2019t like she was in love with her.</p><p>On the Friday morning at the end of the first week of classes, Eve was getting coffee at the little cart outside of the main psychology building. Normally she just got an easy cup of whatever they had on hand and a bit of cream, but it had been a long week so she sprung for some espresso and steamed milk and was fiddling on her phone while she waited for it to be made when she felt a tap on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHey there!\u201d</p><p>That voice. She\u2019d already recognize it anywhere, not that that was all that significant or anything given that Russian accent. She turned around to see Oksana standing behind her, her loose hair dancing around her face in the slight breeze. She looked as elegant as ever, once again in a nicely tailored suit, more fitted this time, a classy gray with thin pinstripes and three quarter length sleeves that showed off her slim wrists.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Eve paused, unsure what else to say. \u201cAren\u2019t you cold? You don\u2019t have a coat.\u201d Fall had started to set in over the past few weeks and Eve tugged her own coat around her.</p><p>Oksana shrugged and shoved her hands in her pockets. \u201cNot really. I just ran down from my office to grab a coffee, didn\u2019t want to bother putting it on.\u201d</p><p>Eve nodded, at a loss for words again. She really was a stimulating conversationalist. Her eyes kept slipping down to follow the lines of Oksana\u2019s suit, the way they dipped in at her waist and hugged her thighs. She quickly glanced away, hoping Oksana hadn\u2019t noticed. If she had, she was at least polite enough to pretend otherwise.</p><p>The man at the cart called out, \u201cMiss, I have your coffee.\u201d As much as Eve had wanted a chance to see Oksana again - no matter how much she might deny it - she was somewhat grateful to have the awkwardness on her part abated. She turned to grab the coffee and pull some change out of her wallet. Oksana put a hand over hers, stopping her from handing over the money.</p><p>\u201cLet me,\u201d To the man she said, \u201cCan you make me another of whatever she got?\u201d Flustered, Eve muttered some sort of argument but Oksana just shook her head and wrapped Eve\u2019s fingers around her bills and shoved her hand back in her pocket. \u201cI insist.\u201d</p><p>Eve gave up the argument, it didn\u2019t cost very much anyway and part of her hoped that it might give her a chance to pay Oksana back at a later date. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, doing her best to smile like a normal person.</p><p>Oksana did a much better job at looking like she was actually enjoying the moment. \u201cLike I said, my pleasure.\u201d She paused for a moment, looking like she was trying to decide whether or not to say something else. Then she bumped her hip against Eve\u2019s with a grin and said, \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again, I kind of thought you\u2019d disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Eve stared down at the coffee in her hands, unable to handle Oksana\u2019s focused gaze, \u201cActually, I kind of wondered the same thing. I guess it\u2019s a big campus after all.\u201d She dared a glance at Oksana and the woman genuinely looked happy to be seeing her.</p><p>\u201cIt would seem so.\u201d Oksana took her coffee, overpaid the man, and told him to keep the change. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, studying Eve, \u201cI presume with both have responsibilities to attend to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably true,\u201d Eve said. She did, as much as she wished otherwise.</p><p>\u201cI do hope to see you around, I mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be good.\u201d She sounded so awkward.</p><p>Oksana smiled, briefly rested a hand lightly on Eve\u2019s wrist, then headed back into the building.</p><p>Eve sighed and looked up at the sky. She realized after a moment that the man at the coffee cart was giving her a knowing look and she groaned and hurried away into the building herself.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>It was later that same day, in the middle of her last afternoon lecture, when Eve suddenly noticed the familiar figure sitting in the back of her class. She immediately stuttered to a halt in the middle of her sentence. Noticing where she was looking, Oksana grinned and waved. \u201cKeep talking,\u201d she mouthed.</p><p>Eve\u2019s eyes trailed back down to her lecture notes, searching for her place. \u201cRight, as I was saying voire dire is a pretrial process in which lawyers from both sides are allowed to ask questions of the jurors in an attempt to eliminate anyone who might be biased.\u201d She glanced back up at Oksana. She had a strange grin on her face, and her fingers were tapping a rapid line on the desk. Eve quickly looked back down at her notes. \u201cA process known as scientific jury selection is often used to help select the type of jurors who would be most easily persuaded to a particular side. Larger law offices in big cases are most well-known for doing this and often hire psychologists trained in this area to help with those evaluations.\u201d</p><p>It suddenly dawned on Eve that Oksana had told her she had previously worked as exactly that kind of psychologist. She suddenly felt very uncomfortable and could feel Oksana\u2019s eyes on her. She\u2019d had something else to add but it was lost in her head and she finally gave up and met Oksana\u2019s gaze. She raised her eyebrows when Eve looked at her and for a second it seemed like her gaze was cold, almost critical even. Then she relaxed, feigned a silent laugh, and gestured for Eve to continue. Eve did, but she cut out a few things and moved onto the next topic as quickly as possible.</p><p>At the end of the class, Oksana hung in the back of the classroom leaning against the wall, her arms crossed over her chest, watching Eve with a bemused expression that suggested she had a lot to say to Eve - or mock her for. Eve made a show of slowly packing up her things and once the last of the students had trickled out, Oksana came to join her at the front of the class.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re talking about me.\u201d</p><p>Eve flushed. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about you, I\u2019m teaching my class,\u201d she said, unnecessarily rearranging her bag, \u201cI actually forgot that was your line of work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m joking, Eve. I heard you were teaching the law and psych class. I was jealous, I\u2019d told Carolyn I wanted that class, but she said she\u2019d already handed it off. I might get it next term.\u201d</p><p>That surprised Eve. \u201cReally? You wanted this class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, why wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just would have thought Dr. Martens would have given it to you if you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, she does like you. And if you worked for MI6 I\u2019m sure you have plenty to talk about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would seem you do, too.\u201d</p><p>Oksana\u2019s face twitched and she side-stepped the conversation. \u201cWell, they wouldn\u2019t hire us if we didn\u2019t have experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d There was a slightly tense silence between the two of them. Oksana was the first to break it.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s why I came to watch your class. I\u2019d wanted to come by anyways, I was already curious how you lectured, but once I knew what you were teaching I was especially interested. I\u2019m sorry if I made you uncomfortable. You&rsquo;re a good lecturer.\u201d</p><p>Oksana was fiddling with the bracelet on her wrist; she was actually the one who looked uncomfortable. \u201cIt\u2019s totally fine, I was just surprised to see you.\u201d That seemed to relieve, Oksana, who let go of the bracelet and smiled at Eve, swagger and confidence returning.</p><p>\u201cGood. Anyway, I also came by because I wanted to ask if you\u2019d like to grab a drink tonight. Celebrate the end of the first week and all that. And we had fun last time, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? You\u2019ll come out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Eve did her best to sound calm and relaxed but in reality her heart was racing.</p><p>It was entirely unclear from Oksana\u2019s demeanor and the way she had phrased the question what exactly she meant by \u201cgrab a drink\u201d. Eve was still unsure what Oksana was even looking for. She had called Eve hot that night at the bar, but only after Eve had said the same to her, and she\u2019d spent the rest of the evening calling them friends. She was friendly. That was clear. Eve shouldn\u2019t assume it was anything more than that. They were both new to the university and they could probably both use new - platonic - relationships. Eve was fine with that.</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Oksana chirped, then she paused, suddenly much calmer, and the way she looked at Eve was almost soft. She reached out and brushed at a loose strand of hair that had slipped out of Eve\u2019s ponytail. \u201cYou know, you should really wear your hair down. I think it would look nice. Do that tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&hellip;okay.\u201d Eve stuttered, caught off guard by the contact and sudden change in Oksana. Then, just as quickly, she was wild and vibrant again, clasping her hands together and spinning.</p><p>\u201cFantastic, it\u2019ll be fun! Do you have somewhere in mind?\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for an answer. \u201cGive me your number, I\u2019ll text you, we\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d Eve dug a piece of paper out of her bag, scribbled the number down and handed it over to Oksana. She glanced it over before shoving it in her pocket. \u201cWonderful!\u201d She patted Eve\u2019s cheek and practically skipped from the room, leaving a dazed Eve to stare after her.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Eve tried to dress up for the bar. She put on a pair of jeans she knew she looked really good in and changed her shirt three or four times. Eventually, she just said \u201cfuck it\u201d and settled on a silky red blouse and a nice pair of heels that she never wore. She wore her hair down.</p><p>If Oksana\u2019s reaction was anything to go by, Eve had chosen the right outfit. \u201cYou like nice,\u201d she told her, as she grabbed her hand and pulled her from the mass of people at the door towards a booth in the corner. \u201cYou should dress up more.\u201d</p><p>They must have made quite a pair because Oksana happened to be wearing red herself - bright red shorts in her case and a high necked white top. She\u2019d gone an extra step, though, and donned blood red lipstick to match, something Eve would never have dreamed of doing. It looked incredible on Oksana, adding to her already intimidating style, not that that was a bad thing.</p><p>\u201cYou wore your hair down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Eve stared at her feet and shifted from one to the other.</p><p>\u201cI told you it\u2019d look nice.\u201d Before Eve knew what was happening, Oksana\u2019s hands were in her hair, running through it, and sweeping it off to the side. \u201cThere, now you look perfect.\u201d</p><p>Eve stumbled over the first syllable or two but eventually managed a \u201cthank you\u201d.</p><p>\u201cI should be thanking you for the gorgeous company.\u201d Fortunately, Eve was saved from having to respond to that because Oksana nudged her into the booth and said, \u201cHold down this table, I\u2019ll get us drinks. What do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh&hellip;whiskey sour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing!\u201d Oksana disappeared into the crowd and Eve rubbed at her temples.</p><p>She returned surprisingly quickly - no doubt having charmed the bartender once again - and slid into her side of the booth, crossed her legs under her, and grabbed some peanuts from the bowl on the table. \u201cSo tell me how your first week has been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know, craziness,\u201d Eve said reaching for her drink.</p><p>\u201cI know. I remembered that I don\u2019t really like kids. I mean, I know they&rsquo;re not technically kids, but&hellip;kids.\u201d</p><p>Eve laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s a little late for that realization.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a bit. I\u2019m not regretting anything, though, I like it here. It\u2019s pretty. And the people are fun. Some of them.\u201d She shot Eve a look. Eve hid her reaction with the rim of her glass.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to make me dance on a table again tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think we can have a more relaxed evening. Unless you want to?\u201d Okasana waggled her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou enjoyed that, don\u2019t lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.

It was probably for the best; classes had started in a flurry and Eve found herself more overwhelmed than ever. She desperately needed to focus and not find herself distracted by thoughts of the enchanting woman who was certain to somewhere in Eve\u2019s same building, if she looked hard enough.</p>[[MORE]]<p>And it worked. Eve only found her head jerking to the side every time she saw blonde hair for the first couple days of classes. After that, she began to relax and assume that she and Oksana were on different schedules. If Oksana wasn\u2019t going to seek her out, Eve certainly wasn\u2019t going to go looking for her. She didn\u2019t have any reason to. It wasn\u2019t like they\u2019d made any plans to see each other again, other than the vague \u201csee you around campus\u201d.</p><p>Oksana had said she\u2019d had fun, but she could have just been being nice. The whole night was probably just her being nice. Any spark Eve thought she had felt between them was certainly just in her head. Oksana was clearly the type of person who exuded a certain flirtatious charm in all of her day to day interactions. Eve was no one special and Eve could accept that. Mostly. She\u2019d just met the woman after all, it wasn\u2019t like she was in love with her.</p><p>On the Friday morning at the end of the first week of classes, Eve was getting coffee at the little cart outside of the main psychology building. Normally she just got an easy cup of whatever they had on hand and a bit of cream, but it had been a long week so she sprung for some espresso and steamed milk and was fiddling on her phone while she waited for it to be made when she felt a tap on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHey there!\u201d</p><p>That voice. She\u2019d already recognize it anywhere, not that that was all that significant or anything given that Russian accent. She turned around to see Oksana standing behind her, her loose hair dancing around her face in the slight breeze. She looked as elegant as ever, once again in a nicely tailored suit, more fitted this time, a classy gray with thin pinstripes and three quarter length sleeves that showed off her slim wrists.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Eve paused, unsure what else to say. \u201cAren\u2019t you cold? You don\u2019t have a coat.\u201d Fall had started to set in over the past few weeks and Eve tugged her own coat around her.</p><p>Oksana shrugged and shoved her hands in her pockets. \u201cNot really. I just ran down from my office to grab a coffee, didn\u2019t want to bother putting it on.\u201d</p><p>Eve nodded, at a loss for words again. She really was a stimulating conversationalist. Her eyes kept slipping down to follow the lines of Oksana\u2019s suit, the way they dipped in at her waist and hugged her thighs. She quickly glanced away, hoping Oksana hadn\u2019t noticed. If she had, she was at least polite enough to pretend otherwise.</p><p>The man at the cart called out, \u201cMiss, I have your coffee.\u201d As much as Eve had wanted a chance to see Oksana again - no matter how much she might deny it - she was somewhat grateful to have the awkwardness on her part abated. She turned to grab the coffee and pull some change out of her wallet. Oksana put a hand over hers, stopping her from handing over the money.</p><p>\u201cLet me,\u201d To the man she said, \u201cCan you make me another of whatever she got?\u201d Flustered, Eve muttered some sort of argument but Oksana just shook her head and wrapped Eve\u2019s fingers around her bills and shoved her hand back in her pocket. \u201cI insist.\u201d</p><p>Eve gave up the argument, it didn\u2019t cost very much anyway and part of her hoped that it might give her a chance to pay Oksana back at a later date. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, doing her best to smile like a normal person.</p><p>Oksana did a much better job at looking like she was actually enjoying the moment. \u201cLike I said, my pleasure.\u201d She paused for a moment, looking like she was trying to decide whether or not to say something else. Then she bumped her hip against Eve\u2019s with a grin and said, \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again, I kind of thought you\u2019d disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Eve stared down at the coffee in her hands, unable to handle Oksana\u2019s focused gaze, \u201cActually, I kind of wondered the same thing. I guess it\u2019s a big campus after all.\u201d She dared a glance at Oksana and the woman genuinely looked happy to be seeing her.</p><p>\u201cIt would seem so.\u201d Oksana took her coffee, overpaid the man, and told him to keep the change. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, studying Eve, \u201cI presume with both have responsibilities to attend to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably true,\u201d Eve said. She did, as much as she wished otherwise.</p><p>\u201cI do hope to see you around, I mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be good.\u201d She sounded so awkward.</p><p>Oksana smiled, briefly rested a hand lightly on Eve\u2019s wrist, then headed back into the building.</p><p>Eve sighed and looked up at the sky. She realized after a moment that the man at the coffee cart was giving her a knowing look and she groaned and hurried away into the building herself.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>It was later that same day, in the middle of her last afternoon lecture, when Eve suddenly noticed the familiar figure sitting in the back of her class. She immediately stuttered to a halt in the middle of her sentence. Noticing where she was looking, Oksana grinned and waved. \u201cKeep talking,\u201d she mouthed.</p><p>Eve\u2019s eyes trailed back down to her lecture notes, searching for her place. \u201cRight, as I was saying voire dire is a pretrial process in which lawyers from both sides are allowed to ask questions of the jurors in an attempt to eliminate anyone who might be biased.\u201d She glanced back up at Oksana. She had a strange grin on her face, and her fingers were tapping a rapid line on the desk. Eve quickly looked back down at her notes. \u201cA process known as scientific jury selection is often used to help select the type of jurors who would be most easily persuaded to a particular side. Larger law offices in big cases are most well-known for doing this and often hire psychologists trained in this area to help with those evaluations.\u201d</p><p>It suddenly dawned on Eve that Oksana had told her she had previously worked as exactly that kind of psychologist. She suddenly felt very uncomfortable and could feel Oksana\u2019s eyes on her. She\u2019d had something else to add but it was lost in her head and she finally gave up and met Oksana\u2019s gaze. She raised her eyebrows when Eve looked at her and for a second it seemed like her gaze was cold, almost critical even. Then she relaxed, feigned a silent laugh, and gestured for Eve to continue. Eve did, but she cut out a few things and moved onto the next topic as quickly as possible.</p><p>At the end of the class, Oksana hung in the back of the classroom leaning against the wall, her arms crossed over her chest, watching Eve with a bemused expression that suggested she had a lot to say to Eve - or mock her for. Eve made a show of slowly packing up her things and once the last of the students had trickled out, Oksana came to join her at the front of the class.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re talking about me.\u201d</p><p>Eve flushed. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about you, I\u2019m teaching my class,\u201d she said, unnecessarily rearranging her bag, \u201cI actually forgot that was your line of work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m joking, Eve. I heard you were teaching the law and psych class. I was jealous, I\u2019d told Carolyn I wanted that class, but she said she\u2019d already handed it off. I might get it next term.\u201d</p><p>That surprised Eve. \u201cReally? You wanted this class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, why wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just would have thought Dr. Martens would have given it to you if you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, she does like you. And if you worked for MI6 I\u2019m sure you have plenty to talk about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would seem you do, too.\u201d</p><p>Oksana\u2019s face twitched and she side-stepped the conversation. \u201cWell, they wouldn\u2019t hire us if we didn\u2019t have experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d There was a slightly tense silence between the two of them. Oksana was the first to break it.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s why I came to watch your class. I\u2019d wanted to come by anyways, I was already curious how you lectured, but once I knew what you were teaching I was especially interested. I\u2019m sorry if I made you uncomfortable. You\u2019re a good lecturer.\u201d</p><p>Oksana was fiddling with the bracelet on her wrist; she was actually the one who looked uncomfortable. \u201cIt\u2019s totally fine, I was just surprised to see you.\u201d That seemed to relieve, Oksana, who let go of the bracelet and smiled at Eve, swagger and confidence returning.</p><p>\u201cGood. Anyway, I also came by because I wanted to ask if you\u2019d like to grab a drink tonight. Celebrate the end of the first week and all that. And we had fun last time, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? You\u2019ll come out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Eve did her best to sound calm and relaxed but in reality her heart was racing.</p><p>It was entirely unclear from Oksana\u2019s demeanor and the way she had phrased the question what exactly she meant by \u201cgrab a drink\u201d. Eve was still unsure what Oksana was even looking for. She had called Eve hot that night at the bar, but only after Eve had said the same to her, and she\u2019d spent the rest of the evening calling them friends. She was friendly. That was clear. Eve shouldn\u2019t assume it was anything more than that. They were both new to the university and they could probably both use new - platonic - relationships. Eve was fine with that.</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Oksana chirped, then she paused, suddenly much calmer, and the way she looked at Eve was almost soft. She reached out and brushed at a loose strand of hair that had slipped out of Eve\u2019s ponytail. \u201cYou know, you should really wear your hair down. I think it would look nice. Do that tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026okay.\u201d Eve stuttered, caught off guard by the contact and sudden change in Oksana. Then, just as quickly, she was wild and vibrant again, clasping her hands together and spinning.</p><p>\u201cFantastic, it\u2019ll be fun! Do you have somewhere in mind?\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for an answer. \u201cGive me your number, I\u2019ll text you, we\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d Eve dug a piece of paper out of her bag, scribbled the number down and handed it over to Oksana. She glanced it over before shoving it in her pocket. \u201cWonderful!\u201d She patted Eve\u2019s cheek and practically skipped from the room, leaving a dazed Eve to stare after her.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Eve tried to dress up for the bar. She put on a pair of jeans she knew she looked really good in and changed her shirt three or four times. Eventually, she just said \u201cfuck it\u201d and settled on a silky red blouse and a nice pair of heels that she never wore. She wore her hair down.</p><p>If Oksana\u2019s reaction was anything to go by, Eve had chosen the right outfit. \u201cYou like nice,\u201d she told her, as she grabbed her hand and pulled her from the mass of people at the door towards a booth in the corner. \u201cYou should dress up more.\u201d</p><p>They must have made quite a pair because Oksana happened to be wearing red herself - bright red shorts in her case and a high necked white top. She\u2019d gone an extra step, though, and donned blood red lipstick to match, something Eve would never have dreamed of doing. It looked incredible on Oksana, adding to her already intimidating style, not that that was a bad thing.</p><p>\u201cYou wore your hair down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Eve stared at her feet and shifted from one to the other.</p><p>\u201cI told you it\u2019d look nice.\u201d Before Eve knew what was happening, Oksana\u2019s hands were in her hair, running through it, and sweeping it off to the side. \u201cThere, now you look perfect.\u201d</p><p>Eve stumbled over the first syllable or two but eventually managed a \u201cthank you\u201d.</p><p>\u201cI should be thanking you for the gorgeous company.\u201d Fortunately, Eve was saved from having to respond to that because Oksana nudged her into the booth and said, \u201cHold down this table, I\u2019ll get us drinks. What do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026whiskey sour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing!\u201d Oksana disappeared into the crowd and Eve rubbed at her temples.</p><p>She returned surprisingly quickly - no doubt having charmed the bartender once again - and slid into her side of the booth, crossed her legs under her, and grabbed some peanuts from the bowl on the table. \u201cSo tell me how your first week has been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know, craziness,\u201d Eve said reaching for her drink.</p><p>\u201cI know. I remembered that I don\u2019t really like kids. I mean, I know they\u2019re not technically kids, but\u2026kids.\u201d</p><p>Eve laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s a little late for that realization.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a bit. I\u2019m not regretting anything, though, I like it here. It\u2019s pretty. And the people are fun. Some of them.\u201d She shot Eve a look. Eve hid her reaction with the rim of her glass.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to make me dance on a table again tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think we can have a more relaxed evening. Unless you want to?\u201d Okasana waggled her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou enjoyed that, don\u2019t lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem like the type of person who gets wild much. You should. It helps you relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you find it relaxing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Oksana looked genuinely confused and Eve wasn\u2019t entirely sure how to explain.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026people stare. I don\u2019t want to make a fool of myself. We were up there and then I suddenly realized how ridiculous it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it was fun. You said you had fun. So who cares if people look. Let them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like the attention,\u201d Eve said. That probably should have been abundantly clear a while ago, but somehow it only fully sank it Eve at that moment.</p><p>Oksana shrugged, \u201cSure. There\u2019s nothing wrong with liking attention, Eve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost people don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, no, most people just don\u2019t like to admit that they like attention.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t wrong. \u201cMaybe, if it\u2019s positive. People don\u2019t like being judged.\u201d</p><p>Oksana smirked. \u201cSome people like any kind of attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd are you one of those people?\u201d</p><p>Oksana gave a noncommittal shrug, but her smile was an obvious answer. \u201cWho can say, Eve, who can say. Besides,\u201d she said, leaning across the table to look Eve in the eye, \u201cno one was judging us the other night. Two hot ladies dancing together on a table? People like that.\u201d She winked at Eve and downed the last of her drink.</p>",

She\u2019d just met the woman after all, it wasn\u2019t like she was in love with her.</p><p>On the Friday morning at the end of the first week of classes, Eve was getting coffee at the little cart outside of the main psychology building. Normally she just got an easy cup of whatever they had on hand and a bit of cream, but it had been a long week so she sprung for some espresso and steamed milk and was fiddling on her phone while she waited for it to be made when she felt a tap on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHey there!\u201d</p><p>That voice. She\u2019d already recognize it anywhere, not that that was all that significant or anything given that Russian accent. She turned around to see Oksana standing behind her, her loose hair dancing around her face in the slight breeze. She looked as elegant as ever, once again in a nicely tailored suit, more fitted this time, a classy gray with thin pinstripes and three quarter length sleeves that showed off her slim wrists.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Eve paused, unsure what else to say. \u201cAren\u2019t you cold? You don\u2019t have a coat.\u201d Fall had started to set in over the past few weeks and Eve tugged her own coat around her.</p><p>Oksana shrugged and shoved her hands in her pockets. \u201cNot really. I just ran down from my office to grab a coffee, didn\u2019t want to bother putting it on.\u201d</p><p>Eve nodded, at a loss for words again. She really was a stimulating conversationalist. Her eyes kept slipping down to follow the lines of Oksana\u2019s suit, the way they dipped in at her waist and hugged her thighs. She quickly glanced away, hoping Oksana hadn\u2019t noticed. If she had, she was at least polite enough to pretend otherwise.</p><p>The man at the cart called out, \u201cMiss, I have your coffee.\u201d As much as Eve had wanted a chance to see Oksana again - no matter how much she might deny it - she was somewhat grateful to have the awkwardness on her part abated. She turned to grab the coffee and pull some change out of her wallet. Oksana put a hand over hers, stopping her from handing over the money.</p><p>\u201cLet me,\u201d To the man she said, \u201cCan you make me another of whatever she got?\u201d Flustered, Eve muttered some sort of argument but Oksana just shook her head and wrapped Eve\u2019s fingers around her bills and shoved her hand back in her pocket. \u201cI insist.\u201d</p><p>Eve gave up the argument, it didn\u2019t cost very much anyway and part of her hoped that it might give her a chance to pay Oksana back at a later date. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, doing her best to smile like a normal person.</p><p>Oksana did a much better job at looking like she was actually enjoying the moment. \u201cLike I said, my pleasure.\u201d She paused for a moment, looking like she was trying to decide whether or not to say something else. Then she bumped her hip against Eve\u2019s with a grin and said, \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again, I kind of thought you\u2019d disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Eve stared down at the coffee in her hands, unable to handle Oksana\u2019s focused gaze, \u201cActually, I kind of wondered the same thing. I guess it\u2019s a big campus after all.\u201d She dared a glance at Oksana and the woman genuinely looked happy to be seeing her.</p><p>\u201cIt would seem so.\u201d Oksana took her coffee, overpaid the man, and told him to keep the change. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, studying Eve, \u201cI presume with both have responsibilities to attend to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably true,\u201d Eve said. She did, as much as she wished otherwise.</p><p>\u201cI do hope to see you around, I mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be good.\u201d She sounded so awkward.</p><p>Oksana smiled, briefly rested a hand lightly on Eve\u2019s wrist, then headed back into the building.</p><p>Eve sighed and looked up at the sky. She realized after a moment that the man at the coffee cart was giving her a knowing look and she groaned and hurried away into the building herself.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>It was later that same day, in the middle of her last afternoon lecture, when Eve suddenly noticed the familiar figure sitting in the back of her class. She immediately stuttered to a halt in the middle of her sentence. Noticing where she was looking, Oksana grinned and waved. \u201cKeep talking,\u201d she mouthed.</p><p>Eve\u2019s eyes trailed back down to her lecture notes, searching for her place. \u201cRight, as I was saying voire dire is a pretrial process in which lawyers from both sides are allowed to ask questions of the jurors in an attempt to eliminate anyone who might be biased.\u201d She glanced back up at Oksana. She had a strange grin on her face, and her fingers were tapping a rapid line on the desk. Eve quickly looked back down at her notes. \u201cA process known as scientific jury selection is often used to help select the type of jurors who would be most easily persuaded to a particular side. Larger law offices in big cases are most well-known for doing this and often hire psychologists trained in this area to help with those evaluations.\u201d</p><p>It suddenly dawned on Eve that Oksana had told her she had previously worked as exactly that kind of psychologist. She suddenly felt very uncomfortable and could feel Oksana\u2019s eyes on her. She\u2019d had something else to add but it was lost in her head and she finally gave up and met Oksana\u2019s gaze. She raised her eyebrows when Eve looked at her and for a second it seemed like her gaze was cold, almost critical even. Then she relaxed, feigned a silent laugh, and gestured for Eve to continue. Eve did, but she cut out a few things and moved onto the next topic as quickly as possible.</p><p>At the end of the class, Oksana hung in the back of the classroom leaning against the wall, her arms crossed over her chest, watching Eve with a bemused expression that suggested she had a lot to say to Eve - or mock her for. Eve made a show of slowly packing up her things and once the last of the students had trickled out, Oksana came to join her at the front of the class.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re talking about me.\u201d</p><p>Eve flushed. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about you, I\u2019m teaching my class,\u201d she said, unnecessarily rearranging her bag, \u201cI actually forgot that was your line of work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m joking, Eve. I heard you were teaching the law and psych class. I was jealous, I\u2019d told Carolyn I wanted that class, but she said she\u2019d already handed it off. I might get it next term.\u201d</p><p>That surprised Eve. \u201cReally? You wanted this class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, why wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just would have thought Dr. Martens would have given it to you if you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, she does like you. And if you worked for MI6 I\u2019m sure you have plenty to talk about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would seem you do, too.\u201d</p><p>Oksana\u2019s face twitched and she side-stepped the conversation. \u201cWell, they wouldn\u2019t hire us if we didn\u2019t have experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d There was a slightly tense silence between the two of them. Oksana was the first to break it.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s why I came to watch your class. I\u2019d wanted to come by anyways, I was already curious how you lectured, but once I knew what you were teaching I was especially interested. I\u2019m sorry if I made you uncomfortable. You\u2019re a good lecturer.\u201d</p><p>Oksana was fiddling with the bracelet on her wrist; she was actually the one who looked uncomfortable. \u201cIt\u2019s totally fine, I was just surprised to see you.\u201d That seemed to relieve, Oksana, who let go of the bracelet and smiled at Eve, swagger and confidence returning.</p><p>\u201cGood. Anyway, I also came by because I wanted to ask if you\u2019d like to grab a drink tonight. Celebrate the end of the first week and all that. And we had fun last time, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? You\u2019ll come out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Eve did her best to sound calm and relaxed but in reality her heart was racing.</p><p>It was entirely unclear from Oksana\u2019s demeanor and the way she had phrased the question what exactly she meant by \u201cgrab a drink\u201d. Eve was still unsure what Oksana was even looking for. She had called Eve hot that night at the bar, but only after Eve had said the same to her, and she\u2019d spent the rest of the evening calling them friends. She was friendly. That was clear. Eve shouldn\u2019t assume it was anything more than that. They were both new to the university and they could probably both use new - platonic - relationships. Eve was fine with that.</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Oksana chirped, then she paused, suddenly much calmer, and the way she looked at Eve was almost soft. She reached out and brushed at a loose strand of hair that had slipped out of Eve\u2019s ponytail. \u201cYou know, you should really wear your hair down. I think it would look nice. Do that tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026okay.\u201d Eve stuttered, caught off guard by the contact and sudden change in Oksana. Then, just as quickly, she was wild and vibrant again, clasping her hands together and spinning.</p><p>\u201cFantastic, it\u2019ll be fun! Do you have somewhere in mind?\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for an answer. \u201cGive me your number, I\u2019ll text you, we\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d Eve dug a piece of paper out of her bag, scribbled the number down and handed it over to Oksana. She glanced it over before shoving it in her pocket. \u201cWonderful!\u201d She patted Eve\u2019s cheek and practically skipped from the room, leaving a dazed Eve to stare after her.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Eve tried to dress up for the bar. She put on a pair of jeans she knew she looked really good in and changed her shirt three or four times. Eventually, she just said \u201cfuck it\u201d and settled on a silky red blouse and a nice pair of heels that she never wore. She wore her hair down.</p><p>If Oksana\u2019s reaction was anything to go by, Eve had chosen the right outfit. \u201cYou like nice,\u201d she told her, as she grabbed her hand and pulled her from the mass of people at the door towards a booth in the corner. \u201cYou should dress up more.\u201d</p><p>They must have made quite a pair because Oksana happened to be wearing red herself - bright red shorts in her case and a high necked white top. She\u2019d gone an extra step, though, and donned blood red lipstick to match, something Eve would never have dreamed of doing. It looked incredible on Oksana, adding to her already intimidating style, not that that was a bad thing.</p><p>\u201cYou wore your hair down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Eve stared at her feet and shifted from one to the other.</p><p>\u201cI told you it\u2019d look nice.\u201d Before Eve knew what was happening, Oksana\u2019s hands were in her hair, running through it, and sweeping it off to the side. \u201cThere, now you look perfect.\u201d</p><p>Eve stumbled over the first syllable or two but eventually managed a \u201cthank you\u201d.</p><p>\u201cI should be thanking you for the gorgeous company.\u201d Fortunately, Eve was saved from having to respond to that because Oksana nudged her into the booth and said, \u201cHold down this table, I\u2019ll get us drinks. What do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026whiskey sour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing!\u201d Oksana disappeared into the crowd and Eve rubbed at her temples.</p><p>She returned surprisingly quickly - no doubt having charmed the bartender once again - and slid into her side of the booth, crossed her legs under her, and grabbed some peanuts from the bowl on the table. \u201cSo tell me how your first week has been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know, craziness,\u201d Eve said reaching for her drink.</p><p>\u201cI know. I remembered that I don\u2019t really like kids. I mean, I know they\u2019re not technically kids, but\u2026kids.\u201d</p><p>Eve laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s a little late for that realization.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a bit. I\u2019m not regretting anything, though, I like it here. It\u2019s pretty. And the people are fun. Some of them.\u201d She shot Eve a look. Eve hid her reaction with the rim of her glass.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to make me dance on a table again tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think we can have a more relaxed evening. Unless you want to?\u201d Okasana waggled her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou enjoyed that, don\u2019t lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem like the type of person who gets wild much. You should. It helps you relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you find it relaxing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Oksana looked genuinely confused and Eve wasn\u2019t entirely sure how to explain.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026people stare. I don\u2019t want to make a fool of myself. We were up there and then I suddenly realized how ridiculous it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it was fun. You said you had fun. So who cares if people look. Let them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like the attention,\u201d Eve said. That probably should have been abundantly clear a while ago, but somehow it only fully sank it Eve at that moment.</p><p>Oksana shrugged, \u201cSure. There\u2019s nothing wrong with liking attention, Eve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost people don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, no, most people just don\u2019t like to admit that they like attention.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t wrong. \u201cMaybe, if it\u2019s positive. People don\u2019t like being judged.\u201d</p><p>Oksana smirked. \u201cSome people like any kind of attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd are you one of those people?\u201d</p><p>Oksana gave a noncommittal shrug, but her smile was an obvious answer. \u201cWho can say, Eve, who can say. Besides,\u201d she said, leaning across the table to look Eve in the eye, \u201cno one was judging us the other night. Two hot ladies dancing together on a table? People like that.\u201d She winked at Eve and downed the last of her drink.</p>",

It was probably for the best; classes had started in a flurry and Eve found herself more overwhelmed than ever. She desperately needed to focus and not find herself distracted by thoughts of the enchanting woman who was certain to somewhere in Eve&rsquo;s same building, if she looked hard enough.</p><p>And it worked. Eve only found her head jerking to the side every time she saw blonde hair for the first couple days of classes. After that, she began to relax and assume that she and Oksana were on different schedules. If Oksana wasn&rsquo;t going to seek her out, Eve certainly wasn&rsquo;t going to go looking for her. She didn&rsquo;t have any reason to. It wasn&rsquo;t like they&rsquo;d made any plans to see each other again, other than the vague &ldquo;see you around campus&rdquo;.</p><p>Oksana had said she&rsquo;d had fun, but she could have just been being nice. The whole night was probably just her being nice. Any spark Eve thought she had felt between them was certainly just in her head. Oksana was clearly the type of person who exuded a certain flirtatious charm in all of her day to day interactions. Eve was no one special and Eve could accept that. Mostly.

It looked incredible on Oksana, adding to her already intimidating style, not that that was a bad thing.</p><p>&ldquo;You wore your hair down.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Eve stared at her feet and shifted from one to the other.</p><p>&ldquo;I told you it&rsquo;d look nice.&rdquo; Before Eve knew what was happening, Oksana&rsquo;s hands were in her hair, running through it, and sweeping it off to the side. &ldquo;There, now you look perfect.&rdquo;</p><p>Eve stumbled over the first syllable or two but eventually managed a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;I should be thanking you for the gorgeous company.&rdquo; Fortunately, Eve was saved from having to respond to that because Oksana nudged her into the booth and said, &ldquo;Hold down this table, I&rsquo;ll get us drinks. What do you want?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip;whiskey sour?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure thing!&rdquo; Oksana disappeared into the crowd and Eve rubbed at her temples.</p><p>She returned surprisingly quickly - no doubt having charmed the bartender once again - and slid into her side of the booth, crossed her legs under her, and grabbed some peanuts from the bowl on the table. &ldquo;So tell me how your first week has been.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you know, craziness,&rdquo; Eve said reaching for her drink.</p><p>&ldquo;I know. I remembered that I don&rsquo;t really like kids. I mean, I know they&rsquo;re not technically kids, but&hellip;kids.&rdquo;</p><p>Eve laughed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little late for that realization.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just a bit. I&rsquo;m not regretting anything, though, I like it here. It&rsquo;s pretty. And the people are fun. Some of them.&rdquo; She shot Eve a look. Eve hid her reaction with the rim of her glass.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you going to make me dance on a table again tonight?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I think we can have a more relaxed evening. Unless you want to?&rdquo; Okasana waggled her eyebrows.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You enjoyed that, don&rsquo;t lie.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine. I did.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem like the type of person who gets wild much. You should. It helps you relax.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe you find it relaxing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, not really.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Oksana looked genuinely confused and Eve wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure how to explain.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;people stare. I don&rsquo;t want to make a fool of myself. We were up there and then I suddenly realized how ridiculous it was.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But it was fun. You said you had fun. So who cares if people look. Let them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You like the attention,&rdquo; Eve said. That probably should have been abundantly clear a while ago, but somehow it only fully sank it Eve at that moment.</p><p>Oksana shrugged, &ldquo;Sure. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with liking attention, Eve.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Most people don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm, no, most people just don&rsquo;t like to admit that they like attention.&rdquo;</p><p>She wasn&rsquo;t wrong. &ldquo;Maybe, if it&rsquo;s positive. People don&rsquo;t like being judged.&rdquo;</p><p>Oksana smirked. &ldquo;Some people like any kind of attention.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And are you one of those people?&rdquo;</p><p>Oksana gave a noncommittal shrug, but her smile was an obvious answer. &ldquo;Who can say, Eve, who can say. Besides,&rdquo; she said, leaning across the table to look Eve in the eye, &ldquo;no one was judging us the other night. Two hot ladies dancing together on a table? People like that.&rdquo; She winked at Eve and downed the last of her drink.</p>",

Eve know exactly who it was, they had unfinished business.<b><br/></b></p><p>She pulled the covers up to her chin and closed her eyes. She could smell Villanelle before she felt the weight on her bed. The assassin wasn\u2019t trying to be sneaky. Villanelle wanted Eve to know she was there.</p><p>\u201cDid you miss me?\u201d Villanelle\u2019s warm breath against her ear sent a long shiver down Eve\u2019s spine. </p><!-- more --><p>Eve stifled a gasp as she nodded slowly. She wasn\u2019t in a position to lie nor did she feel the need. That\u2019s when she felt the sharp end of a knife pressing into her side. </p><p>\u201cShould we continue our lesson before we were so rudely interrupted?\u201d Villanelle\u2019s voice was low, but not soft. There was an edge to it that made the hair on the back of Eve\u2019s neck stand on end. She could smell the vodka on Villanelle\u2019s breath as she waited for Eve\u2019s reply. </p><p>Eve tried to get words out, but her throat was painfully dry. She nodded once again and felt the point move slowly up her body. Villanelle rested the blade between two ribs. </p><p>\u201cI could find a vital organ and they would have no chance of saving you. It would be slow, quick, excruciatingly painful, or you could already be dead and not even know it.\u201d </p><p>Villanelle moved so she was in Eve\u2019s line of sight and smiled down at her. \u201cI\u2019m that good, Eve.\u201d </p><p>Eve knew her mouth was hanging open as she looked back up at the blonde. Villanelle was in complete control and that was how she liked it. The blade of the knife made a soft noise as Villanelle moved it up to rest against the sensitive skin of Eve\u2019s throat. </p><p>\u201cShould I kill you, Eve?\u201d Villanelle asked, her large, expressive eyes looking down at Eve expectantly. Eve knew she was genuinely asking, this was a game she had been playing for years. The pleasure she got from it clearly visible in her wild expression. </p><p>Eve shook her head. \u201cNo, you\u2019d miss me too much.\u201d</p><p>It hurt to speak, her throat pulling at each word as she forced it out. </p><p>Villanelle made a clicking noise with her tongue. \u201cYou think so highly of yourself. You don\u2019t think I\u2019ll do it?\u201d </p><p>Villanelle moved like a shadow in the dark room, pinning Eve to the bed. Villanelle positioned her legs on either side of Eve\u2019s hips, putting a good amount of her weight on top of Eve. </p><p>\u201cNo, I know you would. I just think you\u2019d miss me. You\u2019d miss this.\u201d Eve lifted her hips, creating just the right amount of friction between their bodies. She watched Villanelle\u2019s eyes rolled back at the sensation. </p><p>Villanelle looked back at Eve and even in the dark room she could see an intensity in her gaze that wasn\u2019t there before. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play games,\u201d Villanelle warned, pressing the knife a little harder against Eve\u2019s neck. </p><p>Eve kept Villanelle\u2019s gaze and once again lifted her hips to meet Villanelle. She did it three more times without saying a word. The third time she earned a loud groan from Villanelle, the pressure of the knife getting a little tighter. Eve tried to deny that the fear and danger was turning her on, but she felt herself becoming wet at the thought of it. </p><p>Eve\u2019s hands moved up to touch Villanelle\u2019s stomach, continuing to lift her hips off the bed. Villanelle\u2019s eyes shot open. </p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She threw the knife toward the edge of the bed and grabbed Eve\u2019s wrists. Villanelle pinned Eve\u2019s arms above her head and bent down to hover just centimeters from her face. \u201cWe do this my way.\u201d </p><p>Eve\u2019s heart jumped in her chest. They were so close now. The teasing and foreplay was no longer enough. They both needed each other and had come to their breaking point. </p><p>Villanelle gave Eve a series of quick pecks on the lips, the grip she had on Eve\u2019s wrists tightening after each one. </p><p>Eve felt the pain and pleasure mingle together in the pit of her stomach and begin to fill her with warmth. </p><p>Villanelle\u2019s lips began to linger, the kisses growing deeper and more passionate. Villanelle released Eve\u2019s wrists and reached down to pull at the long shirt she had worn to bed. Villanelle pulled it over Eve\u2019s head and threw it off the bed. </p><p>\u201cBe still.\u201d Villanelle instructed, her body moving beneath the covers. </p><p>Eve felt her breath catch, her arms still above her head. Eve remembered the hundreds of times she had pictured this moment, Villanelle taking her and throwing her into the waves of pleasure. </p><p>Eve\u2019s felt Villanelle leaving a heated trail of kisses along her body as she moved lower. </p><p>Villanelle\u2019s mouth hovered over Eve\u2019s center. It was maddening how much Eve wanted to feel Villanelle. She had never experienced anything like the sensations coursing through her body. It was amazing and also terribly frightening. </p><p>Villanelle\u2019s mouth went to work without warning. Eve\u2019s back arched off the bed. Villanelle\u2019s left hand moved to rest on Eve\u2019s stomach while the right slowly slipped between her legs. Eve felt a long finger join Villanelle\u2019s mouth in the slow rhythm. After a few moments another finger began the increasingly fast pace. Each time Eve thought she had reached the peak, but Villanelle kept taking her further than she\u2019d ever been before. </p><p>Eve closed her eyes and saw colors bursting against her eyelids. Her own hands moved below the covers and tangled in Villanelle\u2019s soft hair. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so close,\u201d Eve groaned, her fingers tightening in Villanelle\u2019s hair. She felt Villanelle\u2019s mouth move to suck on her clit. That was all she needed. Eve had found her point of no return. Her entire body tensed, each muscle filled with enough electricity to power a city. Her lungs felt like they were on fire as she screamed Villanelle\u2019s name into the empty room. </p><p>\u201cEve? Eve?\u201d </p><p>Eve shot up in bed, her dark hair matted to her forehead. She could feel the thin shirt she was wearing was covered in sweat. \u00a0</p><p>Eve\u2019s chest heaved, she could still feel the electricity moving through her limbs as she looked around the room and found Nico looking at her concerned. </p><p>\u201cEverything alright? You were groaning pretty loudly.\u201d </p><p>Eve took a deep breath, she could still smell the sweet vodka in her nostrils. </p><p>Yeah,\u201d Eve lied. \u201cBad dream.\u201d</p><p>Eve got up and walked to the bathroom, striping off her soaked shirt. </p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d Niko called after her. </p><p>Eve grabbed a towel and turned back to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.

Villanelle was in complete control and that was how she liked it. The blade of the knife made a soft noise as Villanelle moved it up to rest against the sensitive skin of Eve&rsquo;s throat. </p><p>&ldquo;Should I kill you, Eve?&rdquo; Villanelle asked, her large, expressive eyes looking down at Eve expectantly. Eve knew she was genuinely asking, this was a game she had been playing for years. The pleasure she got from it clearly visible in her wild expression. </p><p>Eve shook her head. &ldquo;No, you&rsquo;d miss me too much.&rdquo;</p><p>It hurt to speak, her throat pulling at each word as she forced it out. </p><p>Villanelle made a clicking noise with her tongue. &ldquo;You think so highly of yourself. You don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll do it?&rdquo; </p><p>Villanelle moved like a shadow in the dark room, pinning Eve to the bed. Villanelle positioned her legs on either side of Eve&rsquo;s hips, putting a good amount of her weight on top of Eve. </p><p>&ldquo;No, I know you would. I just think you&rsquo;d miss me. You&rsquo;d miss this.&rdquo; Eve lifted her hips, creating just the right amount of friction between their bodies. She watched Villanelle&rsquo;s eyes rolled back at the sensation. </p><p>Villanelle looked back at Eve and even in the dark room she could see an intensity in her gaze that wasn&rsquo;t there before. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play games,&rdquo; Villanelle warned, pressing the knife a little harder against Eve&rsquo;s neck. </p><p>Eve kept Villanelle&rsquo;s gaze and once again lifted her hips to meet Villanelle. She did it three more times without saying a word. The third time she earned a loud groan from Villanelle, the pressure of the knife getting a little tighter. Eve tried to deny that the fear and danger was turning her on, but she felt herself becoming wet at the thought of it. </p><p>Eve&rsquo;s hands moved up to touch Villanelle&rsquo;s stomach, continuing to lift her hips off the bed. Villanelle&rsquo;s eyes shot open. </p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; She threw the knife toward the edge of the bed and grabbed Eve&rsquo;s wrists. Villanelle pinned Eve&rsquo;s arms above her head and bent down to hover just centimeters from her face. &ldquo;We do this my way.&rdquo; </p><p>Eve&rsquo;s heart jumped in her chest. They were so close now. The teasing and foreplay was no longer enough. They both needed each other and had come to their breaking point. </p><p>Villanelle gave Eve a series of quick pecks on the lips, the grip she had on Eve&rsquo;s wrists tightening after each one. </p><p>Eve felt the pain and pleasure mingle together in the pit of her stomach and begin to fill her with warmth. </p><p>Villanelle&rsquo;s lips began to linger, the kisses growing deeper and more passionate. Villanelle released Eve&rsquo;s wrists and reached down to pull at the long shirt she had worn to bed. Villanelle pulled it over Eve&rsquo;s head and threw it off the bed. </p><p>&ldquo;Be still.&rdquo; Villanelle instructed, her body moving beneath the covers. </p><p>Eve felt her breath catch, her arms still above her head. Eve remembered the hundreds of times she had pictured this moment, Villanelle taking her and throwing her into the waves of pleasure. </p><p>Eve&rsquo;s felt Villanelle leaving a heated trail of kisses along her body as she moved lower. </p><p>Villanelle&rsquo;s mouth hovered over Eve&rsquo;s center. It was maddening how much Eve wanted to feel Villanelle. She had never experienced anything like the sensations coursing through her body. It was amazing and also terribly frightening. </p><p>Villanelle&rsquo;s mouth went to work without warning. Eve&rsquo;s back arched off the bed. Villanelle&rsquo;s left hand moved to rest on Eve&rsquo;s stomach while the right slowly slipped between her legs. Eve felt a long finger join Villanelle&rsquo;s mouth in the slow rhythm. After a few moments another finger began the increasingly fast pace. Each time Eve thought she had reached the peak, but Villanelle kept taking her further than she&rsquo;d ever been before. </p><p>Eve closed her eyes and saw colors bursting against her eyelids. Her own hands moved below the covers and tangled in Villanelle&rsquo;s soft hair. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so close,&rdquo; Eve groaned, her fingers tightening in Villanelle&rsquo;s hair. She felt Villanelle&rsquo;s mouth move to suck on her clit. That was all she needed. Eve had found her point of no return. Her entire body tensed, each muscle filled with enough electricity to power a city. Her lungs felt like they were on fire as she screamed Villanelle&rsquo;s name into the empty room. </p><p>&ldquo;Eve? Eve?&rdquo; </p><p>Eve shot up in bed, her dark hair matted to her forehead. She could feel the thin shirt she was wearing was covered in sweat. &nbsp;</p><p>Eve&rsquo;s chest heaved, she could still feel the electricity moving through her limbs as she looked around the room and found Nico looking at her concerned. </p><p>&ldquo;Everything alright? You were groaning pretty loudly.&rdquo; </p><p>Eve took a deep breath, she could still smell the sweet vodka in her nostrils. </p><p>Yeah,&rdquo; Eve lied. &ldquo;Bad dream.&rdquo;</p><p>Eve got up and walked to the bathroom, striping off her soaked shirt. </p><p>&ldquo;You sure you&rsquo;re okay?&rdquo; Niko called after her. </p><p>Eve grabbed a towel and turned back to him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. Go back to bed I&rsquo;m going to shower.&rdquo; </p><p>Eve closed the bathroom door and smirked as she walked to the shower. She could still remember every touch.</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>Eve heard her bedroom door open, the dim light from the hallway cast eerie shadows on the walls. It wasn&rsquo;t Nico, he wasn&rsquo;t due home for another two days. Eve know exactly who it was, they had unfinished business.<b><br /></b></p>\n<p>She pulled the covers up to her chin and closed her eyes. She could smell Villanelle before she felt the weight on her bed. The assassin wasn&rsquo;t trying to be sneaky. Villanelle wanted Eve to know she was there.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Did you miss me?&rdquo; Villanelle&rsquo;s warm breath against her ear sent a long shiver down Eve&rsquo;s spine. </p>\n</p>",
