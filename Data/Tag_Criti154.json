Makes sense! Also a horrible self-fulfilling prophecy considering it\u2019s probably his birth name. Bren is generally considered to be a derivative of the name Brendan (and its variations), coming from the old Welsh word for\u00a0\u201cprince.\u201d So, for Bren, we have\u00a0\u201cfire\u201d and\u00a0\u201cprince.\u201d I don\u2019t think Caleb was necessarily lying about/concealing his heritage and that he\u2019s actually a prince (although how cool would that be), but this definitely lines up with his ties to the real power in Rexxentrum</p><p><b>Aldric</b>: a germanic name. From the roots for\u00a0\u201cold\u201d and\u00a0\u201cruler/power.\u201d I\u2019ve also seen it as\u00a0\u201cwise ruler.\u201d</p><p><b>Ermendrud</b>: again, germanic, coming from the words for\u00a0\u201cwhole/universal\u201d and \u201cstrength.\u201d</p><p>So we have Bren Aldric Ermendrud, darling of the empire, a powerful and volatile young wizard. Someone whose name means strength, control, and destruction.</p><p>Let\u2019s move on to the Caleb of the Mighty Nein: <b>Caleb Widogast</b></p><p><b>Caleb</b>: generally considered to come from the Hebrew word for\u00a0\u201cdog,\u201d which spawned a lot of fun werewolf theories early on in the campaign. Alternate etymology theories connect it to the Hebrew words for\u00a0\u201cwhole/all of\u201d and\u00a0\u201cheart.\u201d The name is generally connected to ideas of faithfulness and loyalty. Straight from behindthename.com:\u00a0\u201cIn the Old Testament this is the name of one of the twelve spies sent by Moses into Canaan. Of the Israelites who left Egypt with Moses, Caleb and Joshua were the only ones who lived to see the Promised Land.\u201d\n\n</p><p><b>Widogast</b>: from the words for\u00a0\u201cwood\u201d and\u00a0\u201cstranger/guest.\u201d According to nordicnames.de the root\u00a0\u201cvid\u201d is\u00a0\u201cin names probably a kenning for man,\u201d so we may be able to extrapolate a bit here and consider Widogast to roughly mean\u00a0\u201c[masculine] stranger/guest.\u201d I personally prefer this interpretation, my main reason being that\u00a0\u201cwood\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily fit into the rest of the meaning of his name. There are also the obvious auditory connections to\u00a0\u201cwidow\u201d and\u00a0\u201cghast/ghost,\u201d of which widow comes from words meaning\u00a0\u201cbereft/void\u201d and\u00a0\u201cghast/ghost\u201d comes from either\u00a0\u201cinspiring fear\u201d or\u00a0\u201cfrightened.\u201d\u00a0Both of these words have connotations of loss and grief. The literal meaning of the Old English <i>gast</i>\u00a0is\u00a0\u201cbreath; good or bad spirit, angel, demon; person, man, human being\u201d (from etymonline.com) and is also used biblically to mean \u201csoul/spirit.\u201d</p><p>Here we have Caleb Widogast: A man who has lost everything. A stranger, unknown to himself and others, running scared, but one who eventually becomes fiercely loyal to his friends and is willing to sacrifice himself and go it alone to protect them.</p><p>Just from the names alone we can see how vastly different Caleb is from Bren. He\u2019s gone from confident, powerful Empire mage to a stranger in his own body, but a loyal friend (who, in my opinion, loves his friends with his whole heart).\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s so incredible to me just how much thought went into both of these names and I have to take my hat off to Liam for his absurd amount of dedication to meaning and symbolism.</p><p>Also, for what it\u2019s worth, Phillip means\u00a0\u201cfriend of horses.\u201d</p>",
