She didn\u2019t know if it was because the temperature in her room was just how she liked it, or if it was due to the time she had spent with Gendry the night before. It was odd hearing about his past. It felt like they were traveling on the King\u2019s Road again. The level of danger was certainly the same as when they were traveling to the wall, different only in technicality. </p><p>The dull winter sun was shining through the frosted window in her bedchamber, dimly lighting the warm stone walls. She moved to add a few more sticks to the hearth in the corner, attempting to make it just a little warmer. Arya heard a faint knock on her door and beckoned for whoever knocked to enter. She was in her shift and a heavy cloak to block the frigid temperatures from crawling up her skin. </p><p>She was surprised to see her sister walk through her door with Lady Brienne in tow. It was late in the morning and Arya was sure her sister had more important matters at hand. Even with Jon returned home, Sansa had continued her duties as Lady of Winterfell. She was naturally good at it. Knowing when to rule and what justice was right. It was something Arya would never match, no matter how hard she tried. After being together for all these years during the Great War, the sisters learned that they were two sides of the same coin, opposite but ever the same. </p><p>\u201cHeavens Arya,\u201d Sansa started, \u201cI thought something was wrong. You never sleep this late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI surprised myself. I woke expecting it to be early morning, instead half the day had already wasted away.\u201d Arya turned and smiled at Brienne, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I missed our sparring session this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Lady it is no problem. We can fight on the marrow.\u201d Brienne offered kindly and excused herself, moving to stand outside the entryway. Sansa took a step toward her sister and crowded around the fire, adjusting the long sleeves of her warm winter gown.</p><p>\u201cOh, and Arya,\u201d the younger sister turned toward her elder sibling allowing her all of her attention, not sparing a glance as her sister moved toward the door. \u201cNext time, tell Gendry to be a bit more stealthy when he leaves.\u201d</p><p>Arya stood there gawking as her sister closed the door with a smirk. Her fire-red hair the lasting thing Arya saw before the door fully shut. Gendry had been seen by someone upon leaving her chambers. She did not care what all the other lords and ladies thought, but she knew her sister and Jon would not like the crude words that spilled from their lips. She turned and saw a dress laid out for her on her bed. Something her sister had sewn, no doubt. Surprisingly enough it had not been long since Arya had been in a dress. Womanly customs was something Arya had grown more accustom to during her time in Bravos. She grew to like gowns, though she would never admit it. The Bravosi fashion trends lends itself to flowing dresses, often with no underlying structure, unlike the thick fabrics of the north that limit movement. She could easily fight in a silk Bravosi style dress. Arya approached the thick woolen dress slowly and ran her hands across the fabric. It looked similar to the one Sansa was wearing. Dark grey with grey and white fur. Arya put the gown on, sliding a pair of britches on underneath for comfort, or if she needed to fight her bare arse wouldn\u2019t be shown to the world. Her hair was hanging loosely by her shoulders, so she pinned part of it back out of her face and moved to look at herself in the mirror. She looked every bit a lady. Arya knew that if her parents could see her now, they would be proud of the young lady she has become. </p><p>With those thoughts pushed aside, Arya gathered her cloak and needle and made her way outside into the frosty air. She saw Maester Kerwin wheeling Bran into the Godswood and decided that she would go find Gendry in the forge instead of her original plan. As she crossed the yard she took note of how the remaining lords and ladies looked at her. She was no longer the rowdy wolf-girl they remembered from her childhood, but one of the most feared warriors in all of Westeros. She was treated with the respect she deserved, her and her sister both. Between the Dragon Queen, Brienne of Tarth, Meera Reed, and herself they were reshaping the role women played in their society. Gone were the days of subjecting to the whim of every man and lord, or hiding in the castle with your sewing needles. The day had come when women could make their own decisions. They could be warriors, they could man the wall, hells, they could rule the Seven Kingdoms. </p><p>As she approached the forge Arya began to feel uneasy. She knew she had no reason to feel such a way. Nothing had truly changed last night. They were still the same. She was Arya Stark and he was Gendry Waters. Well, he would be Gendry Baratheon soon enough. Would things change then? Or would all remain the same? </p><p>Taking a deep breath she pulled open the heavy wooden door and stepped inside debatably the warmest building in all of Winterfell. She weaved her way through the many working blacksmiths till she got to the back where she knew Gendry would be. Since he first stepped foot in Winterfell before the Great War, Gendry had spent most of his time in the smithy. So much that he had taken over as their resident blacksmith and claimed the head position for himself. Now, much to Jon\u2019s dismay, Gendry lived in the forge in the small bedchamber tucked in the back of the building. Jon thought because Gendry was soon to be legitimized he no longer had to live as a bastard blacksmith, but Gendry was just as content as he always had been. Arya imagined a change in surname would do nothing to change his true character. </p><p>\u201cArry?\u201d Her friend said as he pulled her from her thoughts. His hammering ceasing while he looked upon her. His eyes drifting from her hair down to her toes, not skipping over an inch of her body. \u201cThis is&hellip; different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can wear a dress Gendry. It\u2019s not going to kill me, much to the beliefs of my younger self.\u201d Arya said with a grin on her face. She moved to sit on the stool opposite the hearth. Gendry continued to track her with his eyes his hammer now hanging by his side. \u201cSeven hells Gendry! What are you staring at?\u201d</p><p>Gendry had the decency to blush. \u201cYou look like a proper lady is all. I haven\u2019t seen you in a dress in quite some time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, I suppose you haven\u2019t. It hasn\u2019t been long since I\u2019ve worn a gown though.\u201d \u00a0Gendry\u2019s eyes widened as Arya rolled her\u2019s. She prepared to go in depth on her time in the wonderful city of Bravos. \u201cI wore them quite frequently while I was in Bravos. Especially during their holidays. Many women wore gowns of sheer fabric and the best way to fly under their nose while I was training to be a faceless man was to blend in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me, that you wore sheer flowing dresses, and that you didn\u2019t mind?\u201d Arya nodded.</p><p>\u201cThe sheer fabric was nice in the painful hot temperatures. They weren\u2019t completely sheer. Only the top half, it was mainly to appease the lingering stares of the men.\u201d Gendry looked at her with his mouth hanging open. \u201cI still have one packed away, incase I ever found myself going back to Bravos I would have something to wear. I was never planning on coming north. My plan was to go to King\u2019s Landing and finally kill Cersei. Now look, it turns out that I\u2019ll still get to do what I came here to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see Bravos someday.\u201d Gendry said calmly. He set his hammer down and moved to stand in front of her. He sat on the round gently and smiled. \u201cTell me more about how the Bravosi celebrated the holidays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just want to hear more about the women in their sheer dresses.\u201d Arya said teasingly. Gendry\u2019s skin flushed and he bowed his head, only looking up at her with a coy smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want to hear more about Bravosi women and their sheer gowns. I want to hear about you in the sheer gowns.\u201d Arya swore she\u2019d never seen his eyes go that wide before. \u201cThat-that\u2019s not what I meant! I want to hear about you and how you celebrated while you were in Bravos. That\u2019s all, I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.\u201d</p><p>Arya could do nothing but laugh to herself at the way her friend\u2019s face went beet-red at the innuendo of his words. She thought she even saw beads of sweat begin to form on his brow. \u201cIs that so?\u201d Arya said teasingly, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you all about it.\u201d</p><p>Gendry gulped, but nodded his head. Arya began by telling him the history of the Unmasking. \u201cSince the creation of the city the people of Bravos wanted to remember just how different Bravos was and celebrate not just the city but the Many Faced God. The Unmasking is celebration that lasts ten days and for those ten days each and every person in Bravos is masked. Every day is filled with feasting and debauchery. Every woman is in gowns and every man tailored. No one can tell you status and it is the only time of year where everyone can freely love because there is no societal rules telling them they can\u2019t be with someone else. Then when the tenth day rolls around the titan of Bravos roars and everyone removes their masks together, soaking in the final moments of that year\u2019s freedom. For the citizen of Bravos it is the only time of year where they feel equal to the faceless men and the Many Faced God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like something out of a fairytale.\u201d Gendry said when she finished, \u2018it sounds like what I\u2019d hoped for since we left King\u2019s Landing.\u201d</p><p>Arya looked at Gendry and in that moment she knew everything had changed. \u201cSince we left King\u2019s Landing?\u201d Gendry paled and put his head in his hands, realizing what he said. \u201cYou stupid! I told you years ago that I could be your family!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never could have been truly, and you know it. Your family would never have approved.\u201d He looked at her with that same look he did while they were traveling with the Brotherhood. </p><p>\u201cWhy do you think I am making such a big deal about you getting legitimized?\u201d Arya and Gendry\u2019s heads snapped to the new figure in the door. There Jon stood leaning against the wooden frame. \u201cEver since I saw you two rekindling your friendship I knew something else was there. Daenerys was the one that pointed out to me what it was, but once she did I could see it. You two suffered so much together when you were growing up, it was impossible for something not to form. In order to rebuild after the war we are going to need all the help we can get to rebuild every region. Daenerys and I want people we trust wholeheartedly to help us rule the Seven Kingdoms. We would want nothing more than for you two to rule of the Stormlands together.\u201d</p><p>Arya was looking at her brother in shock as was Gendry. Arya was about to say something when Gendry got up and walked out the door. Arya called after him and jumped up to follow him.</p><p>\u201cGendry!\u201d She bellowed as she held the hem of her dress to run after him. As she rounded the corner she watched him stalk into the Godswood. When she finally caught up with him she saw him with his head pressed against a tree. \u201cGods, of all days you made me chase you in a dress?\u201d</p><p>Gendry turned to look at her and pulled at his hair. With each step he took toward her he took two steps back. Arya was getting sick of this game he was playing with himself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He finally whispered, lifting his eyes to meet her own. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be forced to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said I was being forced?\u201d Arya took a step forward, only a foot between her and Gendry now.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t you. You don\u2019t want marry a man and help him run a castle. You want to be a knight.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I be both?\u201d Gendry looked at her confused. \u201cWhen I was younger I loathed the idea of marrying and ruling a castle and dealing with an incompetent husband mostly because it was what Sansa wanted with all her heart. It never helped that Sansa was instinctively a proper lady and I had to work for it everyday. As I grew older and spent time in Bravos I learned how to be a fighter and all that comes with it. I missed my family most of all, I would have given anything to go back to being forced to act a lady if it meant I got to see my family again. Now that I have them back and I fought in battle, I don\u2019t see much horror in starting a family of my own. You saw all the men and women who died on the battlefield. It is no secret that if the remaining men and women don\u2019t wed and have children the Seven Kingdoms will face the consequences. As a Stark of Winterfell it is no surprise that I will play a large part in rebuilding after all the realm has suffered at the \u00a0hands of the Night King, and now you\u2019re going to be responsible for reviving House Baratheon. Gendry you are all that is left of your house. You\u2019re my best friend and I can\u2019t imagine any other man I would rather marry. I know you\u2019re going to respect me, never take Needle out of my hand, and you will never force anything on me, yourself included. Does the thought of marrying me disgust you so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGods Arya, no!\u201d Gendry threw his hands up in the air. \u201cThis is all just so much for me, that\u2019s all. A few years ago I was a no-name bastard from King\u2019s Landing on his way to the Wall to take the black. Now here I stand in front of Arya Stark, a lady of one of the most noble houses in the Seven Kingdoms, and I have been propositioned from the King of the North to marry her. I\u2019m expected to take over as head of House Baratheon simply because I have the blood of a man I never met. I don\u2019t know how to run a castle.</p><p>\u201cTrust me Arry. There is nothing more I have ever wanted than to marry you and have you at my side. I\u2019ve loved you for quite some time now, ever since you trusted me enough to reveal your identity while we were on the King\u2019s road. I\u2019m just overwhelmed is all. My life has changed so much in so few years.\u201d</p><p>Arya closed the distance and wrapped her arms around him in a tight embrace. Gendry buried his face in her neck and took a deep breath. Arya pulled away and looked at him, really looked at him, and stood on her toes before pressing her lips to his. Gendry wasted in time in kissing her back. Their lips slanting together perfectly. Arya had to admit she liked the way the rough hair of his beard scraped against her soft skin. When they parted to breathe Arya offered a small smile and whispered, \u201cI think I\u2019ve loved you for quite some time too.\u201d</p>",

She didn\u2019t know if it was because the temperature in her room was just how she liked it, or if it was due to the time she had spent with Gendry the night before. It was odd hearing about his past. It felt like they were traveling on the King\u2019s Road again. The level of danger was certainly the same as when they were traveling to the wall, different only in technicality. </p><p>The dull winter sun was shining through the frosted window in her bedchamber, dimly lighting the warm stone walls. She moved to add a few more sticks to the hearth in the corner, attempting to make it just a little warmer. Arya heard a faint knock on her door and beckoned for whoever knocked to enter. She was in her shift and a heavy cloak to block the frigid temperatures from crawling up her skin. </p><p>She was surprised to see her sister walk through her door with Lady Brienne in tow. It was late in the morning and Arya was sure her sister had more important matters at hand. Even with Jon returned home, Sansa had continued her duties as Lady of Winterfell. She was naturally good at it. Knowing when to rule and what justice was right. It was something Arya would never match, no matter how hard she tried. After being together for all these years during the Great War, the sisters learned that they were two sides of the same coin, opposite but ever the same. </p><p>\u201cHeavens Arya,\u201d Sansa started, \u201cI thought something was wrong. You never sleep this late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI surprised myself. I woke expecting it to be early morning, instead half the day had already wasted away.\u201d Arya turned and smiled at Brienne, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I missed our sparring session this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Lady it is no problem. We can fight on the marrow.\u201d Brienne offered kindly and excused herself, moving to stand outside the entryway. Sansa took a step toward her sister and crowded around the fire, adjusting the long sleeves of her warm winter gown.</p><p>\u201cOh, and Arya,\u201d the younger sister turned toward her elder sibling allowing her all of her attention, not sparing a glance as her sister moved toward the door. \u201cNext time, tell Gendry to be a bit more stealthy when he leaves.\u201d</p><p>Arya stood there gawking as her sister closed the door with a smirk. Her fire-red hair the lasting thing Arya saw before the door fully shut. Gendry had been seen by someone upon leaving her chambers. She did not care what all the other lords and ladies thought, but she knew her sister and Jon would not like the crude words that spilled from their lips. She turned and saw a dress laid out for her on her bed. Something her sister had sewn, no doubt. Surprisingly enough it had not been long since Arya had been in a dress. Womanly customs was something Arya had grown more accustom to during her time in Bravos. She grew to like gowns, though she would never admit it. The Bravosi fashion trends lends itself to flowing dresses, often with no underlying structure, unlike the thick fabrics of the north that limit movement. She could easily fight in a silk Bravosi style dress. Arya approached the thick woolen dress slowly and ran her hands across the fabric. It looked similar to the one Sansa was wearing. Dark grey with grey and white fur. Arya put the gown on, sliding a pair of britches on underneath for comfort, or if she needed to fight her bare arse wouldn\u2019t be shown to the world. Her hair was hanging loosely by her shoulders, so she pinned part of it back out of her face and moved to look at herself in the mirror. She looked every bit a lady. Arya knew that if her parents could see her now, they would be proud of the young lady she has become. </p><p>With those thoughts pushed aside, Arya gathered her cloak and needle and made her way outside into the frosty air. She saw Maester Kerwin wheeling Bran into the Godswood and decided that she would go find Gendry in the forge instead of her original plan. As she crossed the yard she took note of how the remaining lords and ladies looked at her. She was no longer the rowdy wolf-girl they remembered from her childhood, but one of the most feared warriors in all of Westeros. She was treated with the respect she deserved, her and her sister both. Between the Dragon Queen, Brienne of Tarth, Meera Reed, and herself they were reshaping the role women played in their society. Gone were the days of subjecting to the whim of every man and lord, or hiding in the castle with your sewing needles. The day had come when women could make their own decisions. They could be warriors, they could man the wall, hells, they could rule the Seven Kingdoms. </p><p>As she approached the forge Arya began to feel uneasy. She knew she had no reason to feel such a way. Nothing had truly changed last night. They were still the same. She was Arya Stark and he was Gendry Waters. Well, he would be Gendry Baratheon soon enough. Would things change then? Or would all remain the same? </p><p>Taking a deep breath she pulled open the heavy wooden door and stepped inside debatably the warmest building in all of Winterfell. She weaved her way through the many working blacksmiths till she got to the back where she knew Gendry would be. Since he first stepped foot in Winterfell before the Great War, Gendry had spent most of his time in the smithy. So much that he had taken over as their resident blacksmith and claimed the head position for himself. Now, much to Jon\u2019s dismay, Gendry lived in the forge in the small bedchamber tucked in the back of the building. Jon thought because Gendry was soon to be legitimized he no longer had to live as a bastard blacksmith, but Gendry was just as content as he always had been. Arya imagined a change in surname would do nothing to change his true character. </p><p>\u201cArry?\u201d Her friend said as he pulled her from her thoughts. His hammering ceasing while he looked upon her. His eyes drifting from her hair down to her toes, not skipping over an inch of her body. \u201cThis is\u2026 different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can wear a dress Gendry. It\u2019s not going to kill me, much to the beliefs of my younger self.\u201d Arya said with a grin on her face. She moved to sit on the stool opposite the hearth. Gendry continued to track her with his eyes his hammer now hanging by his side. \u201cSeven hells Gendry! What are you staring at?\u201d</p><p>Gendry had the decency to blush. \u201cYou look like a proper lady is all. I haven\u2019t seen you in a dress in quite some time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, I suppose you haven\u2019t. It hasn\u2019t been long since I\u2019ve worn a gown though.\u201d \u00a0Gendry\u2019s eyes widened as Arya rolled her\u2019s. She prepared to go in depth on her time in the wonderful city of Bravos. \u201cI wore them quite frequently while I was in Bravos. Especially during their holidays. Many women wore gowns of sheer fabric and the best way to fly under their nose while I was training to be a faceless man was to blend in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me, that you wore sheer flowing dresses, and that you didn\u2019t mind?\u201d Arya nodded.</p><p>\u201cThe sheer fabric was nice in the painful hot temperatures. They weren\u2019t completely sheer. Only the top half, it was mainly to appease the lingering stares of the men.\u201d Gendry looked at her with his mouth hanging open. \u201cI still have one packed away, incase I ever found myself going back to Bravos I would have something to wear. I was never planning on coming north. My plan was to go to King\u2019s Landing and finally kill Cersei. Now look, it turns out that I\u2019ll still get to do what I came here to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see Bravos someday.\u201d Gendry said calmly.

If you haven\u2019t read that one, read it before you continue with this story. <b><a href=\"https://denbeyondthewall.tumblr.com/post/181491599303/day-four-gendry-tells-arya-about-the-holidays-in\">You can find it here</a></b>. </i></p>[[MORE]]<p>Arya woke up feeling more relaxed than she had in years. She didn\u2019t know if it was because the temperature in her room was just how she liked it, or if it was due to the time she had spent with Gendry the night before. It was odd hearing about his past. It felt like they were traveling on the King\u2019s Road again. The level of danger was certainly the same as when they were traveling to the wall, different only in technicality. </p><p>The dull winter sun was shining through the frosted window in her bedchamber, dimly lighting the warm stone walls. She moved to add a few more sticks to the hearth in the corner, attempting to make it just a little warmer. Arya heard a faint knock on her door and beckoned for whoever knocked to enter. She was in her shift and a heavy cloak to block the frigid temperatures from crawling up her skin. </p><p>She was surprised to see her sister walk through her door with Lady Brienne in tow. It was late in the morning and Arya was sure her sister had more important matters at hand. Even with Jon returned home, Sansa had continued her duties as Lady of Winterfell. She was naturally good at it. Knowing when to rule and what justice was right. It was something Arya would never match, no matter how hard she tried. After being together for all these years during the Great War, the sisters learned that they were two sides of the same coin, opposite but ever the same. </p><p>\u201cHeavens Arya,\u201d Sansa started, \u201cI thought something was wrong. You never sleep this late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI surprised myself. I woke expecting it to be early morning, instead half the day had already wasted away.\u201d Arya turned and smiled at Brienne, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I missed our sparring session this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Lady it is no problem. We can fight on the marrow.\u201d Brienne offered kindly and excused herself, moving to stand outside the entryway. Sansa took a step toward her sister and crowded around the fire, adjusting the long sleeves of her warm winter gown.</p><p>\u201cOh, and Arya,\u201d the younger sister turned toward her elder sibling allowing her all of her attention, not sparing a glance as her sister moved toward the door. \u201cNext time, tell Gendry to be a bit more stealthy when he leaves.\u201d</p><p>Arya stood there gawking as her sister closed the door with a smirk. Her fire-red hair the lasting thing Arya saw before the door fully shut. Gendry had been seen by someone upon leaving her chambers. She did not care what all the other lords and ladies thought, but she knew her sister and Jon would not like the crude words that spilled from their lips. She turned and saw a dress laid out for her on her bed. Something her sister had sewn, no doubt. Surprisingly enough it had not been long since Arya had been in a dress. Womanly customs was something Arya had grown more accustom to during her time in Bravos. She grew to like gowns, though she would never admit it. The Bravosi fashion trends lends itself to flowing dresses, often with no underlying structure, unlike the thick fabrics of the north that limit movement. She could easily fight in a silk Bravosi style dress. Arya approached the thick woolen dress slowly and ran her hands across the fabric. It looked similar to the one Sansa was wearing. Dark grey with grey and white fur. Arya put the gown on, sliding a pair of britches on underneath for comfort, or if she needed to fight her bare arse wouldn\u2019t be shown to the world. Her hair was hanging loosely by her shoulders, so she pinned part of it back out of her face and moved to look at herself in the mirror. She looked every bit a lady. Arya knew that if her parents could see her now, they would be proud of the young lady she has become. </p><p>With those thoughts pushed aside, Arya gathered her cloak and needle and made her way outside into the frosty air. She saw Maester Kerwin wheeling Bran into the Godswood and decided that she would go find Gendry in the forge instead of her original plan. As she crossed the yard she took note of how the remaining lords and ladies looked at her. She was no longer the rowdy wolf-girl they remembered from her childhood, but one of the most feared warriors in all of Westeros. She was treated with the respect she deserved, her and her sister both. Between the Dragon Queen, Brienne of Tarth, Meera Reed, and herself they were reshaping the role women played in their society. Gone were the days of subjecting to the whim of every man and lord, or hiding in the castle with your sewing needles. The day had come when women could make their own decisions. They could be warriors, they could man the wall, hells, they could rule the Seven Kingdoms. </p><p>As she approached the forge Arya began to feel uneasy. She knew she had no reason to feel such a way. Nothing had truly changed last night. They were still the same. She was Arya Stark and he was Gendry Waters. Well, he would be Gendry Baratheon soon enough. Would things change then? Or would all remain the same? </p><p>Taking a deep breath she pulled open the heavy wooden door and stepped inside debatably the warmest building in all of Winterfell. She weaved her way through the many working blacksmiths till she got to the back where she knew Gendry would be. Since he first stepped foot in Winterfell before the Great War, Gendry had spent most of his time in the smithy. So much that he had taken over as their resident blacksmith and claimed the head position for himself. Now, much to Jon\u2019s dismay, Gendry lived in the forge in the small bedchamber tucked in the back of the building. Jon thought because Gendry was soon to be legitimized he no longer had to live as a bastard blacksmith, but Gendry was just as content as he always had been. Arya imagined a change in surname would do nothing to change his true character. </p><p>\u201cArry?\u201d Her friend said as he pulled her from her thoughts. His hammering ceasing while he looked upon her. His eyes drifting from her hair down to her toes, not skipping over an inch of her body. \u201cThis is\u2026 different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can wear a dress Gendry. It\u2019s not going to kill me, much to the beliefs of my younger self.\u201d Arya said with a grin on her face. She moved to sit on the stool opposite the hearth. Gendry continued to track her with his eyes his hammer now hanging by his side. \u201cSeven hells Gendry! What are you staring at?\u201d</p><p>Gendry had the decency to blush. \u201cYou look like a proper lady is all. I haven\u2019t seen you in a dress in quite some time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, I suppose you haven\u2019t. It hasn\u2019t been long since I\u2019ve worn a gown though.\u201d \u00a0Gendry\u2019s eyes widened as Arya rolled her\u2019s. She prepared to go in depth on her time in the wonderful city of Bravos. \u201cI wore them quite frequently while I was in Bravos. Especially during their holidays. Many women wore gowns of sheer fabric and the best way to fly under their nose while I was training to be a faceless man was to blend in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me, that you wore sheer flowing dresses, and that you didn\u2019t mind?\u201d Arya nodded.</p><p>\u201cThe sheer fabric was nice in the painful hot temperatures. They weren\u2019t completely sheer. Only the top half, it was mainly to appease the lingering stares of the men.\u201d Gendry looked at her with his mouth hanging open. \u201cI still have one packed away, incase I ever found myself going back to Bravos I would have something to wear. I was never planning on coming north. My plan was to go to King\u2019s Landing and finally kill Cersei. Now look, it turns out that I\u2019ll still get to do what I came here to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see Bravos someday.\u201d Gendry said calmly. He set his hammer down and moved to stand in front of her. He sat on the round gently and smiled. \u201cTell me more about how the Bravosi celebrated the holidays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just want to hear more about the women in their sheer dresses.\u201d Arya said teasingly. Gendry\u2019s skin flushed and he bowed his head, only looking up at her with a coy smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want to hear more about Bravosi women and their sheer gowns. I want to hear about you in the sheer gowns.\u201d Arya swore she\u2019d never seen his eyes go that wide before. \u201cThat-that\u2019s not what I meant! I want to hear about you and how you celebrated while you were in Bravos. That\u2019s all, I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.\u201d</p><p>Arya could do nothing but laugh to herself at the way her friend\u2019s face went beet-red at the innuendo of his words. She thought she even saw beads of sweat begin to form on his brow. \u201cIs that so?\u201d Arya said teasingly, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you all about it.\u201d</p><p>Gendry gulped, but nodded his head. Arya began by telling him the history of the Unmasking. \u201cSince the creation of the city the people of Bravos wanted to remember just how different Bravos was and celebrate not just the city but the Many Faced God. The Unmasking is celebration that lasts ten days and for those ten days each and every person in Bravos is masked. Every day is filled with feasting and debauchery. Every woman is in gowns and every man tailored. No one can tell you status and it is the only time of year where everyone can freely love because there is no societal rules telling them they can\u2019t be with someone else. Then when the tenth day rolls around the titan of Bravos roars and everyone removes their masks together, soaking in the final moments of that year\u2019s freedom. For the citizen of Bravos it is the only time of year where they feel equal to the faceless men and the Many Faced God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like something out of a fairytale.\u201d Gendry said when she finished, \u2018it sounds like what I\u2019d hoped for since we left King\u2019s Landing.\u201d</p><p>Arya looked at Gendry and in that moment she knew everything had changed. \u201cSince we left King\u2019s Landing?\u201d Gendry paled and put his head in his hands, realizing what he said. \u201cYou stupid! I told you years ago that I could be your family!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never could have been truly, and you know it. Your family would never have approved.\u201d He looked at her with that same look he did while they were traveling with the Brotherhood. </p><p>\u201cWhy do you think I am making such a big deal about you getting legitimized?\u201d Arya and Gendry\u2019s heads snapped to the new figure in the door. There Jon stood leaning against the wooden frame. \u201cEver since I saw you two rekindling your friendship I knew something else was there. Daenerys was the one that pointed out to me what it was, but once she did I could see it. You two suffered so much together when you were growing up, it was impossible for something not to form. In order to rebuild after the war we are going to need all the help we can get to rebuild every region. Daenerys and I want people we trust wholeheartedly to help us rule the Seven Kingdoms. We would want nothing more than for you two to rule of the Stormlands together.\u201d</p><p>Arya was looking at her brother in shock as was Gendry. Arya was about to say something when Gendry got up and walked out the door. Arya called after him and jumped up to follow him.</p><p>\u201cGendry!\u201d She bellowed as she held the hem of her dress to run after him. As she rounded the corner she watched him stalk into the Godswood. When she finally caught up with him she saw him with his head pressed against a tree. \u201cGods, of all days you made me chase you in a dress?\u201d</p><p>Gendry turned to look at her and pulled at his hair. With each step he took toward her he took two steps back. Arya was getting sick of this game he was playing with himself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He finally whispered, lifting his eyes to meet her own. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be forced to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said I was being forced?\u201d Arya took a step forward, only a foot between her and Gendry now.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t you. You don\u2019t want marry a man and help him run a castle. You want to be a knight.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I be both?\u201d Gendry looked at her confused. \u201cWhen I was younger I loathed the idea of marrying and ruling a castle and dealing with an incompetent husband mostly because it was what Sansa wanted with all her heart. It never helped that Sansa was instinctively a proper lady and I had to work for it everyday. As I grew older and spent time in Bravos I learned how to be a fighter and all that comes with it. I missed my family most of all, I would have given anything to go back to being forced to act a lady if it meant I got to see my family again. Now that I have them back and I fought in battle, I don\u2019t see much horror in starting a family of my own. You saw all the men and women who died on the battlefield. It is no secret that if the remaining men and women don\u2019t wed and have children the Seven Kingdoms will face the consequences. As a Stark of Winterfell it is no surprise that I will play a large part in rebuilding after all the realm has suffered at the \u00a0hands of the Night King, and now you\u2019re going to be responsible for reviving House Baratheon. Gendry you are all that is left of your house. You\u2019re my best friend and I can\u2019t imagine any other man I would rather marry. I know you\u2019re going to respect me, never take Needle out of my hand, and you will never force anything on me, yourself included. Does the thought of marrying me disgust you so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGods Arya, no!\u201d Gendry threw his hands up in the air. \u201cThis is all just so much for me, that\u2019s all. A few years ago I was a no-name bastard from King\u2019s Landing on his way to the Wall to take the black. Now here I stand in front of Arya Stark, a lady of one of the most noble houses in the Seven Kingdoms, and I have been propositioned from the King of the North to marry her. I\u2019m expected to take over as head of House Baratheon simply because I have the blood of a man I never met. I don\u2019t know how to run a castle.</p><p>\u201cTrust me Arry. There is nothing more I have ever wanted than to marry you and have you at my side. I\u2019ve loved you for quite some time now, ever since you trusted me enough to reveal your identity while we were on the King\u2019s road. I\u2019m just overwhelmed is all. My life has changed so much in so few years.\u201d</p><p>Arya closed the distance and wrapped her arms around him in a tight embrace. Gendry buried his face in her neck and took a deep breath. Arya pulled away and looked at him, really looked at him, and stood on her toes before pressing her lips to his. Gendry wasted in time in kissing her back. Their lips slanting together perfectly. Arya had to admit she liked the way the rough hair of his beard scraped against her soft skin. When they parted to breathe Arya offered a small smile and whispered, \u201cI think I\u2019ve loved you for quite some time too.\u201d</p></p>",

It never helped that Sansa was instinctively a proper lady and I had to work for it everyday. As I grew older and spent time in Bravos I learned how to be a fighter and all that comes with it. I missed my family most of all, I would have given anything to go back to being forced to act a lady if it meant I got to see my family again. Now that I have them back and I fought in battle, I don&rsquo;t see much horror in starting a family of my own. You saw all the men and women who died on the battlefield. It is no secret that if the remaining men and women don&rsquo;t wed and have children the Seven Kingdoms will face the consequences. As a Stark of Winterfell it is no surprise that I will play a large part in rebuilding after all the realm has suffered at the &nbsp;hands of the Night King, and now you&rsquo;re going to be responsible for reviving House Baratheon. Gendry you are all that is left of your house. You&rsquo;re my best friend and I can&rsquo;t imagine any other man I would rather marry. I know you&rsquo;re going to respect me, never take Needle out of my hand, and you will never force anything on me, yourself included. Does the thought of marrying me disgust you so much?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Gods Arya, no!&rdquo; Gendry threw his hands up in the air. &ldquo;This is all just so much for me, that&rsquo;s all. A few years ago I was a no-name bastard from King&rsquo;s Landing on his way to the Wall to take the black. Now here I stand in front of Arya Stark, a lady of one of the most noble houses in the Seven Kingdoms, and I have been propositioned from the King of the North to marry her. I&rsquo;m expected to take over as head of House Baratheon simply because I have the blood of a man I never met. I don&rsquo;t know how to run a castle.</p><p>&ldquo;Trust me Arry. There is nothing more I have ever wanted than to marry you and have you at my side. I&rsquo;ve loved you for quite some time now, ever since you trusted me enough to reveal your identity while we were on the King&rsquo;s road. I&rsquo;m just overwhelmed is all. My life has changed so much in so few years.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya closed the distance and wrapped her arms around him in a tight embrace. Gendry buried his face in her neck and took a deep breath. Arya pulled away and looked at him, really looked at him, and stood on her toes before pressing her lips to his. Gendry wasted in time in kissing her back. Their lips slanting together perfectly. Arya had to admit she liked the way the rough hair of his beard scraped against her soft skin. When they parted to breathe Arya offered a small smile and whispered, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve loved you for quite some time too.&rdquo;</p></p>",
