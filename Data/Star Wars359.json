All around him, the light of the Force burns through the gloom, an iridescent alarm urging him onwards. The crystals wail with colour. Only once before has he heard them shriek with such sorrow, and it is a cry he had hoped to never hear again. Somewhere, a world is screaming; perhaps somewhere far beyond his imagination, above the mesa and the sky. Down in the depths, in the kyber-splattered rivers that glow and tremble beneath NiJedha, the Force is here, and so the world that it mourns for is in these caverns, this water, and the darkness that Baze feels carving open with light.<br/></p><p>He darts through the tunnels, pushing against the drag of the current. Unlike Baze\u2019s course to the surface, the flow is the river is lethargic, as unhurried as the desert that surrounds the city, a red ocean crawling into the horizon. Within minutes of being awoken by the kyber, Baze reaches the vast pool in the Keeper\u2019s Cave, so as the Guardians entitle it. It\u2019s the single cavern from the Temple that the Guardians can access; the other is submerged, only allowing passage into the holy grounds for Baze. The Keeper\u2019s Cave is one of the largest beneath NiJedha, stretching infinitely beyond the soft bubbles of light from the lanterns. A gate seals the mouth of the cave from the desert outside; Baze has only ever glimpsed the sun-baked land and the path that climbs up the cliff-face to the Temple. The gate remains shut at nearly all times, opening only twice on a daily basis - once, in the morning, to allow a Guardian inside, and once again a short while later, to let them out once their duties are done.</p><p>Baze seldom speaks to the Guardians, and less so to the acolytes when they come seeking a kyber crystal. There was a time when he knew all those who settled in NiJedha, knew their names and their faces, and how their eyes caught the light of the kyber from the water. But that was before the Temple itself, and that was many years ago.</p><p>He surfaces into the cavern, just so that his eyes and ears glide above the water-line. Instantly, the emptiness of the cave muffles the wailing in Baze\u2019s ears. Without a sound, he swims to the bank and rests a hand upon the rocks, propping himself up to see deeper into the cave. He doesn\u2019t know what he expects: a Guardian, an acolyte, or even a stranger with eyes filled with greed. But he sees none of these things. The lanterns burn, the darkness stretches, and the gates remain shut. If something has occurred in the city above, then the Keeper\u2019s Cave is undisturbed. The air looms and shadows cling to the walls, waiting to be free.</p><p>Baze submerges into the screaming. This time, he makes for the spring in the Temple grounds. Here, late morning sunlight spills into the water, beckoning him to the surface. The shards of kyber that tangle in his plaits glint in the orange light, seeming to set his hair alight. The tunnel up to the surface narrows as it rises, opening out into the holy pool. The Guardians tiled the edge of the small pool some years ago, and years before that, they planted a sapling which now stands as a mighty uneti tree, its branches extending high over the water. Behind the uneti tree, the Old Shadows wall separates the Temple from the cliff-face. Should Baze swim to the far edge of the holy pool, he could see the stairway that leads down to the Keeper\u2019s Cave below. He often does.</p><p>Today, the Temple of the Whills burns.</p><p>Acolytes flee down the Temple steps, many of them children. Thick, black smoke chases them into the courtyard and pours up into the sky. Flames thrash around the doorways and windows like a monster licking the air. A Guardian tumbles out of the Temple, his red-lined robes bleeding onto the stone. Streaks of orange-white light burst around him. By the time Baze understands what he is seeing, one of the blaster bolts gouges through the Guardian\u2019 chest and explodes into the fizzle of light on the ground. The Guardian crumples. The children closest scream. Two figures armoured in white march out of the Temple. Stormtroopers. The Empire has come, just as Chirrut predicted. One of the Stormtroopers prods the dead Guardian with their blaster. The other begins down the steps towards the acolytes, their voice crackling like the bolts from their gun.</p><p>Helplessness burns in Baze&rsquo;s chest. He dares not consider the fate of the other Guardians, of the few he could call his friends. Throwing himself forward, he digs his fingers under a tile and yanks it loose. His eyes are accustomed to the dark of the caves, but the bone-white Stormtrooper is an easy target against the scorched walls of the Temple. Knowing he only has one shot before somebody notices him, Baze throws the tile as hard as he can. Water sloshes around him, spilling out of the pool. The tile clunks against the white helmet like the gates to the Keeper\u2019s Cave slamming shut for the night, and the Stormtrooper drops like a stone. The other one startles, gun swinging from the acolytes to Baze. There\u2019s an electronic cry of what the hell? as Baze scrabbles for another tile; he rips it free, dirt and cement scattering into the pool, and then he screams as a blaster bolt tears open the side of his face. Plasma energy sears through his skin and hair and hits the water behind him. The cold currents swallow the bolt with a hiss, but Baze doesn\u2019t notice as he lurches back underwater, blinded by pain and blood. Another bolt crashes into the water; he feels the heat of it boil away his breath. Terror disorientates him, but his body pushes him down - down into the darkness and the kyber-studded chill of the caves.</p><p>Baze doesn\u2019t know for how long he swims, for how often he circles the rivers, and how deep he descends underground. The wound on his face bleeds until it is all he can smell. Hours may pass, days. His heart pounds until it is all he can hear, for even the crystals cry until they cry no more. Only then, when the kyber strung around Baze\u2019s waist dims and the Force ceases its terrible shrieking, does he hear another sound.</p><p>Baze, whispers the water, carrying the voice through the gloom. Again and again it calls to him, words rippling down the river and worry washing through his hair. The kyber in the tunnels ring with the sound; gently, so unlike their lament from before. He knows this sound, he realises, surfacing to hear the voice echo down the tunnels. He swims towards it gladly, unafraid of what he will find.</p><p>Artificial light floods the Keeper\u2019s Cave. Baze squints as he emerges, catching sight of a blur of red and black at the shore of the lake. Beyond this, he can see nothing in the harsh, artificial light as his eyes adjust. Yet, Baze knows there is nothing to fear. He reaches up, water gushing down his arm and trickling back into the lake, and lays a hand on the bank beside his closest friend.</p><p>Chirrut\u2019s head twitches towards the sound, crow\u2019s feet wrinkling around his eyes. He smiles, only for a moment, but it\u2019s long enough for Baze to smile in return, a breath of relief escaping his chest in a rush.</p><p>\u201cI am glad you are well, my friend,\u201d Chirrut says, but there are ashes in his hair and holes burnt through his clothes, and when he speaks, the bruises across his nose and cheek draw attention to his lip, split in two, and the heavy weight of his frown. Someone or something has struck him repeatedly, and Baze can guess as to what.</p><p>\u201cThe Temple?\u201d Baze croaks, moving his hand to rest on Chirrut\u2019s knee. The touch of another is still a peculiar sensation to Baze, but for Chirrut, he&rsquo;ll endure almost anything.</p><p>\u201cBurned,\u201d Chirrut says, as though Baze should have expected nothing else. \u201cThe Empire have ransacked what remains.\u201d</p><p>This seems to bother Chirrut far more than it bothers Baze - rightly so. Still, Baze tries not to think about the implications of that as he considers Chirrut\u2019s bruised knuckles and the staff he grips tight. \u201cYou&rsquo;re hurt.\u201d</p><p>Chirrut cracks a familiar, disarming smile. \u201cSo are you. I\u2019Jeni saw what you did. She feared you&rsquo;d been killed. I did, too. Truly, I expected all of the kyber in here to be gone.\u201d</p><p>Baze glances past Chirrut, considering the huge flood lights and the wires that coil across the length of the cave. A pair of Stormtroopers lie unconscious or dead some feet away, their weapons kicked out of reach. Chirrut\u2019s staff is lethal - and so is his ego.</p><p>\u201cYou could not have fought them all,\u201d Baze remarks, glad there were so few. Next time, Chirrut won\u2019t be so lucky. There will be a squadron, perhaps two, rotating the patrol over night and day. If the Empire have come for the kyber, then the Keeper\u2019s Cave is where they will find it. It is only a matter of time.</p><p>\u201cI would have,\u201d Chirrut argues, stubborn to the last. \u201cThe kyber -\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll protect the kyber. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m here for. You protect yourself.\u201d</p><p>It is a futile plea. Chirrut seldom weighs the consequences of his actions. Even when he does, the possibility of pain is never enough to deter him. They both know this. So it comes as no surprise when Chirrut juts his chin out, daring Baze to rethink his logic. Blood drips down his neck, but he wears his bruises proudly.</p><p>Baze sighs and shakes his head. Water ripples with his breath, a tiny wave of frustration diminishing against the shore. The kyber shards captured in his crown glint in the burning flood lights, water and fire twinkling. Wishing he had done more to stop the Stormtroopers won\u2019t change the past, but regret swirls in his chest. Years have the Guardians trusted him to guard the kyber, and all Baze had done was hide.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019Jeni said a blaster bolt caught your neck,\u201d Chirrut says, swinging the conversation around. He pulls the satchel from off his shoulder and rummages around for a large tin. The medpac is a hazardous creation and a familiar sight, tailored for Chirrut\u2019s misadventures. Chirrut reaches for the saline solution and stack of cleaning pads, feeling each item with care. Then he lays them aside and unrolls a small cloth, gesturing for Baze\u2019s hands.</p><p>Baze sighs again, but this time the sound is fond. The tips of his ears burn as Chirrut bundles one hand and then the other into the cloth, gently dabbing them dry. Tending to Chirrut\u2019s wounds is a practiced routine, but in all the time they have known each other, never has Baze needed the medpac. Chirrut is unused to patching people up. Considering they barely have a set of decent eyes between them, Baze can only hope the gash on his face won\u2019t require stitches.</p><p>\u201cHow do you look?\u201d Chirrut asks, holding up a small mirror in front of Baze\u2019s face. The corners are chipped and the glass will never be clean, but the scruffy, kyber-tangled reflection would be the same scruffy, kyber-tangled reflection were the mirror a pristine new. \u201cAs ghastly as ever?\u201d</p><p>Baze would quip back at the teasing were he not boggling at the glass. The wound from the blaster is a crescent around his temple and cheek. Blotches of coppery, black burns stretch back to his ear. Lines like lightning scatter across his jaw and neck, remnants of the white-hot plasma crackling over his shoulder. But it\u2019s the shagged, half-shorn end to his hair that Baze reaches for, his hand shaking, fingertips grasping air. The plait that used to tumble to his collar is gone, leaving him lopsided and rubbing the singed strands of his hair.</p><p>Chirrut misinterprets the silence, saying, \u201cYou know I tease.\u201d His expression twists into apology, but as usual, there is a tinge of confusion to it. Rarely, does Chirrut understand what he\u2019s to be sorry for. He speaks without forethought, his tongue as sharp as his will is iron. He experiences a harsh world and it has hardened him, and Baze will not fault him for that. No, Baze will only fault himself for his softness, for the bend of his spine and his malleable heart.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Baze says - for he does, even if Chirrut\u2019s words pain him. Staring at his reflection fails to make himself look any less ridiculous, so he busies himself with preparing the saline solution instead. Unlike Chirrut, he has already begun to heal. With careful, dabbing motions, he cleans up the dead skin on his neck and blistering around his eye. Whenever Chirrut is injured, Baze insists upon dressing the wound. But as the gauze will prove ineffective underwater, he will have to make do with a scar.</p><p>After patching himself up, Baze snags another antiseptic pad from the stack. \u201cGive me your hands.\u201d</p><p>Chirrut lays a hand in Baze\u2019s palm, but still he argues. \u201cI can\u2019t linger, the \u2018troopers will wake. I must return to the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Baze doesn\u2019t hurry, not even as the Stormtroopers\u2019 comms crackle and their metal-plated limbs clang together. They are stirring slowly, dazed by Chirrut\u2019s quarterstaff. Baze dabs the wipe over Chirrut\u2019s knuckles. \u201cWhat do you need from me?\u201d</p><p>Chirrut is quiet for a long moment, which is unlike him. He uses silence to his advantage, as a weapon, but never before against Baze. But when Baze looks up, so close that he may as well be in his Chirrut\u2019s lap, Chirrut isn\u2019t angry.</p><p>\u201cCome when I call,\u201d Chirrut replies, taking the medical supplies. He shoves everything back into the satchel and collects his staff; one of the Stormtroopers vocalises their confusion. \u201cWe may need use of your caves - the children -\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse whatever you need.\u201d</p><p>\n\nChirrut nods; gratitude is another emotion he struggles to express. Baze sinks back into the lake until only above his eyes is visible - his eyes, the scar, and the tips of his fingers clinging onto the bank. Nothing more is said between them, but the thunk of Chirrut\u2019s staff against a helmet and the <i>fluwhoop</i> of water swallowing Baze once again say enough.\u00a0</p>",

All around him, the light of the Force burns through the gloom, an iridescent alarm urging him onwards. The crystals wail with colour. Only once before has he heard them shriek with such sorrow, and it is a cry he had hoped to never hear again. Somewhere, a world is screaming; perhaps somewhere far beyond his imagination, above the mesa and the sky. Down in the depths, in the kyber-splattered rivers that glow and tremble beneath NiJedha, the Force is here, and so the world that it mourns for is in these caverns, this water, and the darkness that Baze feels carving open with light.<br></p><p>He darts through the tunnels, pushing against the drag of the current. Unlike Baze\u2019s course to the surface, the flow is the river is lethargic, as unhurried as the desert that surrounds the city, a red ocean crawling into the horizon. Within minutes of being awoken by the kyber, Baze reaches the vast pool in the Keeper\u2019s Cave, so as the Guardians entitle it. It\u2019s the single cavern from the Temple that the Guardians can access; the other is submerged, only allowing passage into the holy grounds for Baze. The Keeper\u2019s Cave is one of the largest beneath NiJedha, stretching infinitely beyond the soft bubbles of light from the lanterns. A gate seals the mouth of the cave from the desert outside; Baze has only ever glimpsed the sun-baked land and the path that climbs up the cliff-face to the Temple. The gate remains shut at nearly all times, opening only twice on a daily basis - once, in the morning, to allow a Guardian inside, and once again a short while later, to let them out once their duties are done.</p><p>Baze seldom speaks to the Guardians, and less so to the acolytes when they come seeking a kyber crystal. There was a time when he knew all those who settled in NiJedha, knew their names and their faces, and how their eyes caught the light of the kyber from the water. But that was before the Temple itself, and that was many years ago.</p><p>He surfaces into the cavern, just so that his eyes and ears glide above the water-line. Instantly, the emptiness of the cave muffles the wailing in Baze\u2019s ears. Without a sound, he swims to the bank and rests a hand upon the rocks, propping himself up to see deeper into the cave. He doesn\u2019t know what he expects: a Guardian, an acolyte, or even a stranger with eyes filled with greed. But he sees none of these things. The lanterns burn, the darkness stretches, and the gates remain shut. If something has occurred in the city above, then the Keeper\u2019s Cave is undisturbed. The air looms and shadows cling to the walls, waiting to be free.</p><p>Baze submerges into the screaming. This time, he makes for the spring in the Temple grounds. Here, late morning sunlight spills into the water, beckoning him to the surface. The shards of kyber that tangle in his plaits glint in the orange light, seeming to set his hair alight. The tunnel up to the surface narrows as it rises, opening out into the holy pool. The Guardians tiled the edge of the small pool some years ago, and years before that, they planted a sapling which now stands as a mighty uneti tree, its branches extending high over the water. Behind the uneti tree, the Old Shadows wall separates the Temple from the cliff-face. Should Baze swim to the far edge of the holy pool, he could see the stairway that leads down to the Keeper\u2019s Cave below. He often does.</p><p>Today, the Temple of the Whills burns.</p><p>Acolytes flee down the Temple steps, many of them children. Thick, black smoke chases them into the courtyard and pours up into the sky. Flames thrash around the doorways and windows like a monster licking the air. A Guardian tumbles out of the Temple, his red-lined robes bleeding onto the stone. Streaks of orange-white light burst around him. By the time Baze understands what he is seeing, one of the blaster bolts gouges through the Guardian\u2019 chest and explodes into the fizzle of light on the ground. The Guardian crumples. The children closest scream. Two figures armoured in white march out of the Temple. Stormtroopers. The Empire has come, just as Chirrut predicted. One of the Stormtroopers prods the dead Guardian with their blaster. The other begins down the steps towards the acolytes, their voice crackling like the bolts from their gun.</p><p>Helplessness burns in Baze\u2019s chest. He dares not consider the fate of the other Guardians, of the few he could call his friends. Throwing himself forward, he digs his fingers under a tile and yanks it loose. His eyes are accustomed to the dark of the caves, but the bone-white Stormtrooper is an easy target against the scorched walls of the Temple. Knowing he only has one shot before somebody notices him, Baze throws the tile as hard as he can. Water sloshes around him, spilling out of the pool. The tile clunks against the white helmet like the gates to the Keeper\u2019s Cave slamming shut for the night, and the Stormtrooper drops like a stone. The other one startles, gun swinging from the acolytes to Baze. There\u2019s an electronic cry of what the hell? as Baze scrabbles for another tile; he rips it free, dirt and cement scattering into the pool, and then he screams as a blaster bolt tears open the side of his face. Plasma energy sears through his skin and hair and hits the water behind him. The cold currents swallow the bolt with a hiss, but Baze doesn\u2019t notice as he lurches back underwater, blinded by pain and blood. Another bolt crashes into the water; he feels the heat of it boil away his breath. Terror disorientates him, but his body pushes him down - down into the darkness and the kyber-studded chill of the caves.</p><p>Baze doesn\u2019t know for how long he swims, for how often he circles the rivers, and how deep he descends underground. The wound on his face bleeds until it is all he can smell. Hours may pass, days. His heart pounds until it is all he can hear, for even the crystals cry until they cry no more. Only then, when the kyber strung around Baze\u2019s waist dims and the Force ceases its terrible shrieking, does he hear another sound.</p><p>Baze, whispers the water, carrying the voice through the gloom. Again and again it calls to him, words rippling down the river and worry washing through his hair. The kyber in the tunnels ring with the sound; gently, so unlike their lament from before. He knows this sound, he realises, surfacing to hear the voice echo down the tunnels. He swims towards it gladly, unafraid of what he will find.</p><p>Artificial light floods the Keeper\u2019s Cave. Baze squints as he emerges, catching sight of a blur of red and black at the shore of the lake. Beyond this, he can see nothing in the harsh, artificial light as his eyes adjust. Yet, Baze knows there is nothing to fear. He reaches up, water gushing down his arm and trickling back into the lake, and lays a hand on the bank beside his closest friend.</p><p>Chirrut\u2019s head twitches towards the sound, crow\u2019s feet wrinkling around his eyes. He smiles, only for a moment, but it\u2019s long enough for Baze to smile in return, a breath of relief escaping his chest in a rush.</p><p>\u201cI am glad you are well, my friend,\u201d Chirrut says, but there are ashes in his hair and holes burnt through his clothes, and when he speaks, the bruises across his nose and cheek draw attention to his lip, split in two, and the heavy weight of his frown. Someone or something has struck him repeatedly, and Baze can guess as to what.</p><p>\u201cThe Temple?\u201d Baze croaks, moving his hand to rest on Chirrut\u2019s knee. The touch of another is still a peculiar sensation to Baze, but for Chirrut, he\u2019ll endure almost anything.</p><p>\u201cBurned,\u201d Chirrut says, as though Baze should have expected nothing else. \u201cThe Empire have ransacked what remains.\u201d</p><p>This seems to bother Chirrut far more than it bothers Baze - rightly so. Still, Baze tries not to think about the implications of that as he considers Chirrut\u2019s bruised knuckles and the staff he grips tight. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt.\u201d</p><p>Chirrut cracks a familiar, disarming smile. \u201cSo are you.

It is only a matter of time.</p><p>\u201cI would have,\u201d Chirrut argues, stubborn to the last. \u201cThe kyber -\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll protect the kyber. That\u2019s what I\u2019m here for.

All around him, the light of the Force burns through the gloom, an iridescent alarm urging him onwards. The crystals wail with colour. Only once before has he heard them shriek with such sorrow, and it is a cry he had hoped to never hear again. Somewhere, a world is screaming; perhaps somewhere far beyond his imagination, above the mesa and the sky. Down in the depths, in the kyber-splattered rivers that glow and tremble beneath NiJedha, the Force is here, and so the world that it mourns for is in these caverns, this water, and the darkness that Baze feels carving open with light.<br></p><p>He darts through the tunnels, pushing against the drag of the current. Unlike Baze\u2019s course to the surface, the flow is the river is lethargic, as unhurried as the desert that surrounds the city, a red ocean crawling into the horizon. Within minutes of being awoken by the kyber, Baze reaches the vast pool in the Keeper\u2019s Cave, so as the Guardians entitle it. It\u2019s the single cavern from the Temple that the Guardians can access; the other is submerged, only allowing passage into the holy grounds for Baze. The Keeper\u2019s Cave is one of the largest beneath NiJedha, stretching infinitely beyond the soft bubbles of light from the lanterns. A gate seals the mouth of the cave from the desert outside; Baze has only ever glimpsed the sun-baked land and the path that climbs up the cliff-face to the Temple. The gate remains shut at nearly all times, opening only twice on a daily basis - once, in the morning, to allow a Guardian inside, and once again a short while later, to let them out once their duties are done.</p><p>Baze seldom speaks to the Guardians, and less so to the acolytes when they come seeking a kyber crystal. There was a time when he knew all those who settled in NiJedha, knew their names and their faces, and how their eyes caught the light of the kyber from the water. But that was before the Temple itself, and that was many years ago.</p><p>He surfaces into the cavern, just so that his eyes and ears glide above the water-line. Instantly, the emptiness of the cave muffles the wailing in Baze\u2019s ears. Without a sound, he swims to the bank and rests a hand upon the rocks, propping himself up to see deeper into the cave. He doesn\u2019t know what he expects: a Guardian, an acolyte, or even a stranger with eyes filled with greed. But he sees none of these things. The lanterns burn, the darkness stretches, and the gates remain shut. If something has occurred in the city above, then the Keeper\u2019s Cave is undisturbed. The air looms and shadows cling to the walls, waiting to be free.</p><p>Baze submerges into the screaming. This time, he makes for the spring in the Temple grounds. Here, late morning sunlight spills into the water, beckoning him to the surface. The shards of kyber that tangle in his plaits glint in the orange light, seeming to set his hair alight. The tunnel up to the surface narrows as it rises, opening out into the holy pool. The Guardians tiled the edge of the small pool some years ago, and years before that, they planted a sapling which now stands as a mighty uneti tree, its branches extending high over the water. Behind the uneti tree, the Old Shadows wall separates the Temple from the cliff-face. Should Baze swim to the far edge of the holy pool, he could see the stairway that leads down to the Keeper\u2019s Cave below. He often does.</p><p>Today, the Temple of the Whills burns.</p><p>Acolytes flee down the Temple steps, many of them children. Thick, black smoke chases them into the courtyard and pours up into the sky. Flames thrash around the doorways and windows like a monster licking the air. A Guardian tumbles out of the Temple, his red-lined robes bleeding onto the stone. Streaks of orange-white light burst around him. By the time Baze understands what he is seeing, one of the blaster bolts gouges through the Guardian\u2019 chest and explodes into the fizzle of light on the ground. The Guardian crumples. The children closest scream. Two figures armoured in white march out of the Temple. Stormtroopers. The Empire has come, just as Chirrut predicted. One of the Stormtroopers prods the dead Guardian with their blaster. The other begins down the steps towards the acolytes, their voice crackling like the bolts from their gun.</p><p>Helplessness burns in Baze\u2019s chest. He dares not consider the fate of the other Guardians, of the few he could call his friends. Throwing himself forward, he digs his fingers under a tile and yanks it loose. His eyes are accustomed to the dark of the caves, but the bone-white Stormtrooper is an easy target against the scorched walls of the Temple. Knowing he only has one shot before somebody notices him, Baze throws the tile as hard as he can. Water sloshes around him, spilling out of the pool. The tile clunks against the white helmet like the gates to the Keeper\u2019s Cave slamming shut for the night, and the Stormtrooper drops like a stone. The other one startles, gun swinging from the acolytes to Baze. There\u2019s an electronic cry of what the hell? as Baze scrabbles for another tile; he rips it free, dirt and cement scattering into the pool, and then he screams as a blaster bolt tears open the side of his face. Plasma energy sears through his skin and hair and hits the water behind him. The cold currents swallow the bolt with a hiss, but Baze doesn\u2019t notice as he lurches back underwater, blinded by pain and blood. Another bolt crashes into the water; he feels the heat of it boil away his breath. Terror disorientates him, but his body pushes him down - down into the darkness and the kyber-studded chill of the caves.</p><p>Baze doesn\u2019t know for how long he swims, for how often he circles the rivers, and how deep he descends underground. The wound on his face bleeds until it is all he can smell. Hours may pass, days. His heart pounds until it is all he can hear, for even the crystals cry until they cry no more. Only then, when the kyber strung around Baze\u2019s waist dims and the Force ceases its terrible shrieking, does he hear another sound.</p><p>Baze, whispers the water, carrying the voice through the gloom. Again and again it calls to him, words rippling down the river and worry washing through his hair. The kyber in the tunnels ring with the sound; gently, so unlike their lament from before. He knows this sound, he realises, surfacing to hear the voice echo down the tunnels. He swims towards it gladly, unafraid of what he will find.</p><p>Artificial light floods the Keeper\u2019s Cave. Baze squints as he emerges, catching sight of a blur of red and black at the shore of the lake. Beyond this, he can see nothing in the harsh, artificial light as his eyes adjust. Yet, Baze knows there is nothing to fear. He reaches up, water gushing down his arm and trickling back into the lake, and lays a hand on the bank beside his closest friend.</p><p>Chirrut\u2019s head twitches towards the sound, crow\u2019s feet wrinkling around his eyes. He smiles, only for a moment, but it\u2019s long enough for Baze to smile in return, a breath of relief escaping his chest in a rush.</p><p>\u201cI am glad you are well, my friend,\u201d Chirrut says, but there are ashes in his hair and holes burnt through his clothes, and when he speaks, the bruises across his nose and cheek draw attention to his lip, split in two, and the heavy weight of his frown. Someone or something has struck him repeatedly, and Baze can guess as to what.</p><p>\u201cThe Temple?\u201d Baze croaks, moving his hand to rest on Chirrut\u2019s knee. The touch of another is still a peculiar sensation to Baze, but for Chirrut, he\u2019ll endure almost anything.</p><p>\u201cBurned,\u201d Chirrut says, as though Baze should have expected nothing else. \u201cThe Empire have ransacked what remains.\u201d</p><p>This seems to bother Chirrut far more than it bothers Baze - rightly so. Still, Baze tries not to think about the implications of that as he considers Chirrut\u2019s bruised knuckles and the staff he grips tight. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt.\u201d</p><p>Chirrut cracks a familiar, disarming smile. \u201cSo are you. I\u2019Jeni saw what you did. She feared you\u2019d been killed. I did, too. Truly, I expected all of the kyber in here to be gone.\u201d</p><p>Baze glances past Chirrut, considering the huge flood lights and the wires that coil across the length of the cave. A pair of Stormtroopers lie unconscious or dead some feet away, their weapons kicked out of reach. Chirrut\u2019s staff is lethal - and so is his ego.</p><p>\u201cYou could not have fought them all,\u201d Baze remarks, glad there were so few. Next time, Chirrut won\u2019t be so lucky. There will be a squadron, perhaps two, rotating the patrol over night and day. If the Empire have come for the kyber, then the Keeper\u2019s Cave is where they will find it. It is only a matter of time.</p><p>\u201cI would have,\u201d Chirrut argues, stubborn to the last. \u201cThe kyber -\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll protect the kyber. That\u2019s what I\u2019m here for. You protect yourself.\u201d</p><p>It is a futile plea. Chirrut seldom weighs the consequences of his actions. Even when he does, the possibility of pain is never enough to deter him. They both know this. So it comes as no surprise when Chirrut juts his chin out, daring Baze to rethink his logic. Blood drips down his neck, but he wears his bruises proudly.</p><p>Baze sighs and shakes his head. Water ripples with his breath, a tiny wave of frustration diminishing against the shore. The kyber shards captured in his crown glint in the burning flood lights, water and fire twinkling. Wishing he had done more to stop the Stormtroopers won\u2019t change the past, but regret swirls in his chest. Years have the Guardians trusted him to guard the kyber, and all Baze had done was hide.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019Jeni said a blaster bolt caught your neck,\u201d Chirrut says, swinging the conversation around. He pulls the satchel from off his shoulder and rummages around for a large tin. The medpac is a hazardous creation and a familiar sight, tailored for Chirrut\u2019s misadventures. Chirrut reaches for the saline solution and stack of cleaning pads, feeling each item with care. Then he lays them aside and unrolls a small cloth, gesturing for Baze\u2019s hands.</p><p>Baze sighs again, but this time the sound is fond. The tips of his ears burn as Chirrut bundles one hand and then the other into the cloth, gently dabbing them dry. Tending to Chirrut\u2019s wounds is a practiced routine, but in all the time they have known each other, never has Baze needed the medpac. Chirrut is unused to patching people up. Considering they barely have a set of decent eyes between them, Baze can only hope the gash on his face won\u2019t require stitches.</p><p>\u201cHow do you look?\u201d Chirrut asks, holding up a small mirror in front of Baze\u2019s face. The corners are chipped and the glass will never be clean, but the scruffy, kyber-tangled reflection would be the same scruffy, kyber-tangled reflection were the mirror a pristine new. \u201cAs ghastly as ever?\u201d</p><p>Baze would quip back at the teasing were he not boggling at the glass. The wound from the blaster is a crescent around his temple and cheek. Blotches of coppery, black burns stretch back to his ear. Lines like lightning scatter across his jaw and neck, remnants of the white-hot plasma crackling over his shoulder. But it\u2019s the shagged, half-shorn end to his hair that Baze reaches for, his hand shaking, fingertips grasping air. The plait that used to tumble to his collar is gone, leaving him lopsided and rubbing the singed strands of his hair.</p><p>Chirrut misinterprets the silence, saying, \u201cYou know I tease.\u201d His expression twists into apology, but as usual, there is a tinge of confusion to it. Rarely, does Chirrut understand what he\u2019s to be sorry for. He speaks without forethought, his tongue as sharp as his will is iron. He experiences a harsh world and it has hardened him, and Baze will not fault him for that. No, Baze will only fault himself for his softness, for the bend of his spine and his malleable heart.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Baze says - for he does, even if Chirrut\u2019s words pain him. Staring at his reflection fails to make himself look any less ridiculous, so he busies himself with preparing the saline solution instead. Unlike Chirrut, he has already begun to heal. With careful, dabbing motions, he cleans up the dead skin on his neck and blistering around his eye. Whenever Chirrut is injured, Baze insists upon dressing the wound. But as the gauze will prove ineffective underwater, he will have to make do with a scar.</p><p>After patching himself up, Baze snags another antiseptic pad from the stack. \u201cGive me your hands.\u201d</p><p>Chirrut lays a hand in Baze\u2019s palm, but still he argues. \u201cI can\u2019t linger, the \u2018troopers will wake. I must return to the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Baze doesn\u2019t hurry, not even as the Stormtroopers\u2019 comms crackle and their metal-plated limbs clang together. They are stirring slowly, dazed by Chirrut\u2019s quarterstaff. Baze dabs the wipe over Chirrut\u2019s knuckles. \u201cWhat do you need from me?\u201d</p><p>Chirrut is quiet for a long moment, which is unlike him. He uses silence to his advantage, as a weapon, but never before against Baze. But when Baze looks up, so close that he may as well be in his Chirrut\u2019s lap, Chirrut isn\u2019t angry.</p><p>\u201cCome when I call,\u201d Chirrut replies, taking the medical supplies. He shoves everything back into the satchel and collects his staff; one of the Stormtroopers vocalises their confusion. \u201cWe may need use of your caves - the children -\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse whatever you need.\u201d</p><p>\n\nChirrut nods; gratitude is another emotion he struggles to express. Baze sinks back into the lake until only above his eyes is visible - his eyes, the scar, and the tips of his fingers clinging onto the bank. Nothing more is said between them, but the thunk of Chirrut\u2019s staff against a helmet and the <i>fluwhoop</i> of water swallowing Baze once again say enough.\u00a0</p>",
