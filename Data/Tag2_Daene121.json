        "question": "Will Dany love Jon more than the throne? She loves him and he loves her. Many ants think she will love the throne most. Thats how hey get their evil Dany theories to work. However, most people would be willing to give up on an ambition if the price was grievous harm to a loved one. Everyone hates Stannis for doing the reverse. Which way will Dany go? She wants the throne but she doesn't really 'love' the throne does she?",
        "answer": "<p>Dany will absolutely love Jon more than the throne because Dany doesn\u2019t\u00a0\u201clove\u201d the throne at all. I would argue that Dany is only seeking the throne out of a sense of duty and responsibility both to her birthright/family name and the common people. She has been raised on the belief that what Robert\u2019s Rebellion did to her family is a great injustice, one that she must right in order to redeem her family name. Even once she learns that her father was an evil man and that his death was perhaps justified, she still believes (and I would agree) that the fates of the rest of her family were an injustice/murder. She similarly believes that the common people are suffering and oppressed under the current system (which they are) and seeks to liberate them by\u00a0\u201cbreaking the wheel.\u201d So her quest for the throne has nothing to do with personal desires or gratification and everything to do with what she believes is right.\u00a0</p><p>We can see this both in her character and choices\u2013both book and show versions\u2013and in the things Dany thinks about in the books. Across the books, the word \u201cthrone\u201d is mentioned in her POV chapters a total of 46 times. This includes Viserys\u2019s dialogue about this subject, of course, as well as any time anyone else has mentioned this to her. But\u00a0\u201ccommon people,\u201d\u00a0\u201cmy people,\u201d and\u00a0\u201cyour people\u201d (when others talk to her about her people) are mentioned 72 times. Most tellingly,\u00a0\u201chome\u201d is mentioned 68 times, and \u201clove\u201d a whopping 128 times. Dany is not after the throne out of some misguided plan for power, wealth, or glory. She never thinks about any of these things. She\u2019s more interested in helping others and possessing the power to do that consistently.\u00a0</p><p>Even Tyrion knew that Dany cared more about family than power. He said as much to F!Aegon:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI told you, I know our little queen. Let her hear that her brother Rhaegar\u2019s murdered son is still alive, that this brave boy has raised the dragon standard of her forebears in Westeros once more, that he is fighting a desperate war to avenge his father and reclaim the Iron Throne for House Targaryen, hard-pressed on every side \u2026 and she will fly to your side fast as wind and water can carry her. You are the last of her line, and this Mother of Dragons, this breaker of Chains, is above all a rescuer. The girl who drowned the slaver cities in blood rather than leave strangers to their chains can scarcely abandon her own brother\u2019s son in his hour of peril. And when she reaches Westeros and meets you for the first time, you will meet as equals, man and woman, not queen and supplicant. How can she help but <b>love </b>you then, I ask you?\u201d \u2013Tyrion VI ADWD</p></blockquote><p>There\u2019s no F!Aegon in the show, but Jon is <i>actually</i>\u00a0Rhaegar\u2019s son, a man fighting a desperate war who Dany has met in Westeros, eventually (in my opinion) come to respect as an equal, and <i>loved</i>\u00a0as a man, just as Tyrion predicted. I don\u2019t think Dany will care more about her claim than about Jon himself.</p><p>Even in the show, Dany has twice now (both in the HOTU vision and when she lands at Dragonstone) <i>walked right by</i>\u00a0the throne instead of touching it, called instead to a higher purpose. I think this literal action is also symbolic of her evolving priorities.\u00a0</p><p>Further, we can see that she desires a family and love far more than she does a throne. Even Daario, whom she admits to herself doesn\u2019t really love her, but more the <i>idea</i>\u00a0of her as queen, is enough to make her question her entire journey.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI would give up my crown if he asked it of me, Dany thought \u2026 but he had not asked it, and never would. Daario might whisper words of love when the two of them were as one, but she knew it was the dragon queen he loved.\u201c \u2013Daenerys VII ADWD\u00a0<br/></p></blockquote><p>If she would have given up her throne for <i>Daario</i>, can you imagine how much more willing she would be for Jon?</p><p>What she wants more than anything is the safety and freedom of her people, but as far as her <i>presonal</i>\u00a0goals are concerned? What she wants <i>most</i>\u00a0is a family and someone who genuinely loves her. Remember, she has literally <i>never had this with anyone</i>. Her mother died birthing her, leaving Viserys as her only family, and we all know the reality of <i>that</i>\u00a0relationship. Dany has been, for all intents and purpose, alone for her entire life. For Jon to love her, really love her, and want a family and a simple life with her, would be <i>much</i>\u00a0more important to her than any throne. Her own\u00a0\u201cdream\u201d is for something like that:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cIn her dream they were man and wife, simple folk who lived a simple life in a tall stone house with a red door. In her dream he had been kissing her all over\u2013her mouth, her neck, her breasts.\u201d \u2013Daenerys II ADWD<br/></p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s worth noting that Jon has similar dreams:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWhen the dreams took him, he found himself back home once more, splashing in the hot pools beneath a huge white weirdwood that had his father\u2019s face. Ygritte was with him, laughing at him, shedding her skins until she was naked as her name day, trying to kiss him.\u201d \u2013Jon VI ASOS<br/></p></blockquote><p>They both dream of a simple life where they are loved and happy, home at last.</p><p>So no. Dany won\u2019t love the throne more than Jon. And if they both live until the end, I really do believe that their happiest endgame wouldn\u2019t be ruling at all. Like I\u2019ve said before, I\u2019m ok with and would be happy with an endgame of Jon and Dany as king and queen of the 7K, but I think it\u2019s equally likely that after saving the world and instituting a new system of government they might flee to find a semblance of the life they\u2019ve always dreamed of, together :)</p>",

                "content": "<p>Dany will absolutely love Jon more than the throne because Dany doesn&rsquo;t&nbsp;&ldquo;love&rdquo; the throne at all. I would argue that Dany is only seeking the throne out of a sense of duty and responsibility both to her birthright/family name and the common people. She has been raised on the belief that what Robert&rsquo;s Rebellion did to her family is a great injustice, one that she must right in order to redeem her family name. Even once she learns that her father was an evil man and that his death was perhaps justified, she still believes (and I would agree) that the fates of the rest of her family were an injustice/murder. She similarly believes that the common people are suffering and oppressed under the current system (which they are) and seeks to liberate them by&nbsp;&ldquo;breaking the wheel.&rdquo; So her quest for the throne has nothing to do with personal desires or gratification and everything to do with what she believes is right.&nbsp;</p><p>We can see this both in her character and choices&ndash;both book and show versions&ndash;and in the things Dany thinks about in the books. Across the books, the word &ldquo;throne&rdquo; is mentioned in her POV chapters a total of 46 times. This includes Viserys&rsquo;s dialogue about this subject, of course, as well as any time anyone else has mentioned this to her. But&nbsp;&ldquo;common people,&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;my people,&rdquo; and&nbsp;&ldquo;your people&rdquo; (when others talk to her about her people) are mentioned 72 times. Most tellingly,&nbsp;&ldquo;home&rdquo; is mentioned 68 times, and &ldquo;love&rdquo; a whopping 128 times. Dany is not after the throne out of some misguided plan for power, wealth, or glory. She never thinks about any of these things. She&rsquo;s more interested in helping others and possessing the power to do that consistently.&nbsp;</p><p>Even Tyrion knew that Dany cared more about family than power. He said as much to F!Aegon:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I told you, I know our little queen. Let her hear that her brother Rhaegar&rsquo;s murdered son is still alive, that this brave boy has raised the dragon standard of her forebears in Westeros once more, that he is fighting a desperate war to avenge his father and reclaim the Iron Throne for House Targaryen, hard-pressed on every side &hellip; and she will fly to your side fast as wind and water can carry her. You are the last of her line, and this Mother of Dragons, this breaker of Chains, is above all a rescuer. The girl who drowned the slaver cities in blood rather than leave strangers to their chains can scarcely abandon her own brother&rsquo;s son in his hour of peril. And when she reaches Westeros and meets you for the first time, you will meet as equals, man and woman, not queen and supplicant. How can she help but <b>love </b>you then, I ask you?&rdquo; &ndash;Tyrion VI ADWD</p></blockquote><p>There&rsquo;s no F!Aegon in the show, but Jon is <i>actually</i>&nbsp;Rhaegar&rsquo;s son, a man fighting a desperate war who Dany has met in Westeros, eventually (in my opinion) come to respect as an equal, and <i>loved</i>&nbsp;as a man, just as Tyrion predicted. I don&rsquo;t think Dany will care more about her claim than about Jon himself.</p><p>Even in the show, Dany has twice now (both in the HOTU vision and when she lands at Dragonstone) <i>walked right by</i>&nbsp;the throne instead of touching it, called instead to a higher purpose. I think this literal action is also symbolic of her evolving priorities.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, we can see that she desires a family and love far more than she does a throne. Even Daario, whom she admits to herself doesn&rsquo;t really love her, but more the <i>idea</i>&nbsp;of her as queen, is enough to make her question her entire journey.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I would give up my crown if he asked it of me, Dany thought &hellip; but he had not asked it, and never would. Daario might whisper words of love when the two of them were as one, but she knew it was the dragon queen he loved.&ldquo; &ndash;Daenerys VII ADWD&nbsp;<br /></p></blockquote><p>If she would have given up her throne for <i>Daario</i>, can you imagine how much more willing she would be for Jon?</p><p>What she wants more than anything is the safety and freedom of her people, but as far as her <i>presonal</i>&nbsp;goals are concerned?
