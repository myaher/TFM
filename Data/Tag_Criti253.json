There\u2019s really no reason for anyone to have any reason to knock him out, truss him up, and toss him in the back of a cart. Probably a case of mistaken identity, nothing serious.</p><p>He begins to take it a little more seriously when they manhandle him down into a cellar-network of tunnels, past doors and cells and various offshoots, and he starts getting the feeling that these guys might be <i>organised</i>. That there might be <i>more</i> of them. That this, perhaps, might not be a mistake.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says, mildly, as they drag him into the middle of a large, dirty-damp room and shove him to the ground. He narrowly misses biting his tongue, and his teeth click together unpleasantly. \u201c<i>Hey</i>, there\u2019s no need for that, really. I dunno why you\u2019ve brought me here, but I\u2019m thinking that maybe you\u2019ve got the wrong person? Or you\u2019re kinda confused, really, \u2018cos I\u2019m just saying-\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cShut the fuck up, <i>cleric</i>,\u201d snaps one of them, and then there\u2019s hands digging into the sides of his jaw, prying his teeth apart so another man can shove a length of sackcloth between them. The musty taste of it fills his mouth, rubs raw at the corners of his soft, sensitive lips as they tie it in a tight knot at the back of his skull. \u201cNone of that magic shit here, or we\u2019ll make you wish you were never born.\u201d </p><p>When Caduceus bites absently down on the fabric, though, intending to grind the fabric to rags between his broad molars, it\u2019s not rough sackcloth he feels against his tongue and soft palate \u2013 instead, it\u2019s the sharp bite of a hundred tiny points, digging their way into the tender flesh of his mouth and <i>ripping</i>. He cries out, belatedly, confused, as the taste of copper-salt fills his mouth. There must be strings of barbed wire laced through the middle of the fabric, he realises, even as he whimpers confusion and pain at the tearing in his tongue and lips and cheeks.</p><p>One of the thugs flips him over onto his front with a toe, grinds his face into the worn stone floor with a heavy boot on the back of his neck. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I fuckin\u2019 thought,\u201d the guy mutters. \u201cNot so goddamn big and scary without your friends and your spells, huh? You\u2019re pretty fuckin\u2019 skinny for a cow, actually. Probably didn\u2019t even need the two of us, I coulda taken you down on my own.\u201d</p><p>Caduceus <i>groans</i>, unable to articulate properly with a tongue full of wire and barbs ripping into the sensitive sides of his mouth. He wants to say <i>hey man, what\u2019s your problem</i> and <i>I think you\u2019ve got the wrong person, I don\u2019t know you</i>, but instead he can feel the short, soft hairs of the fur around his lips clumping sticky and wet with bloodied saliva. His tongue is throbbing in time to his heartbeat, and every time he tries to swallow the coppery spit welling up in his mouth the barbs just get driven deeper, lodging more firmly into the soft, wet, vulnerable places of his mouth.</p><p>He\u2019s distracted enough by the metal-and-salt of it that he hardly notices when the other man straddles his back, knees either side of his chest and a sudden weight on his shoulder blades. \u201cKeep that foot on his neck,\u201d the man warns, and Caduceus feels a hand grab at his ear, ragged nails biting into the thin, blood-hot skin of it. \u201cHe\u2019s not gonna like this.\u201d</p><p>It happens before he can react, before he can protest or buck or twist away from the weight on top of him. There\u2019s a hand on his ear, cold metal against his ear, a <i>click</i> \u2013 and then pain, sharp and throbbing and wet, and he\u2019s moaning low, unsteady, helpless as they thread more cold metal through the newly-punched circle in his body.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d says one of them \u2013 he\u2019s unsure which, vision still hazy with the pain-shock of being tagged.
