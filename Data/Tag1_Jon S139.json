Or the fact that he&rsquo;d brought this Daenerys Stormborn, the supposed last Targaryen with him from Dragonstone in hopes the North would unite behind her in an effort to take down the Night King. Perhaps even the fact that this smirking Targaryen woman had suddenly lost her place as rightful heir to the Iron Throne there Winterfell&rsquo;s Great Hall, when Bran had revealed Jon&rsquo;s true parentage. That fact alone- Jon being the true heir- was hard to believe. She and Jon had not yet been given the chance to speak on any of these matters together, but her hope was they might later that day. It seemed now that things had become a whirlwind of activity- prepping for war on both fronts, as well as everyone coming to terms with all they&rsquo;d been told the night before. </p><p>From where she stood in her chamber, Sansa looked out into Winterfell&rsquo;s courtyard, seeing Tyrion and Jon down there with Ser Davos in their company, all looking solemn faced as they spoke. Around them was a flurry of activity as her people made ready Winterfell for the hundreds, if not thousands, of soldiers Daenerys had brought with her. Sansa knew there wasn&rsquo;t enough food to feed her own people let alone a massive foreign army. Had Jon even thought of this? Had Daenerys? As a ruler, her first priority should have been the health and happiness of those who served her, but she&rsquo;d brought them here without so much as a wagon of grain. If something wasn&rsquo;t done and soon, the entire North would starve. </p><p>&ldquo;My lady?&rdquo;</p><p>So lost in her own thoughts, she&rsquo;d not heard the knocking on her chamber door. Turning at the sound of her chamberlain&rsquo;s voice, she nodded, indicating for him to speak. &ldquo;A man on horseback approaches the gates. They say it might be a Lannister.&rdquo; A Lannister? Sansa thought as she brushed past the man, strolling out into the corridor past her guards and down towards the Great Hall. She pushed open the double doors that led out into the courtyard, heading towards the gates where already Jon and the others had begun to gather. </p><p>&ldquo;What should we do?&rdquo; One guard spoke, looking uncertainly between Jon and Sansa, as if uncertain as to ask permission of. But it was Jon that gestured towards Sansa, as if telling her to make the decision. Her blue eyes met his dark and she could not help but to offer him the smallest of smiles. Sansa faced the guard and gave a single nod of her head, wordlessly giving her permission to open the gates of Winterfell to their newest arrival. </p><p>&ldquo;Open the gates!&rdquo;</p><p>The gates opened wide and sure enough, to every one of them standing there&rsquo;s shock, it was Jaimie Lannister there on horseback. His gaze swiveled from face to face, focusing for a long moment on Tyrion&rsquo;s, as shocked to see him there as Tyrion was to see him. But then they all sidestepped, making space for the golden haired man to pass through the gates, the guards closing them behind him. Jaime slid from his horse a moment later, coming to stand before their small group, looking weary from his travels. But a smile transformed his features and he offered a low bow to Sansa, ever the courtier she recalled from her days at Kings Landing. She blinked, uncertain as to how to take this, but allowed him the chance to greet her and the others as he saw fit. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re asking yourself why I&rsquo;ve come here,&rdquo; Jaime said then, looking directly at her, moved by the piercing blue eyes that stared back at him. This was not the same young girl that he&rsquo;d seen and known at Kings Landing. </p><p>&ldquo;I will have someone show you to a room, eat something and get warm,&rdquo; Sansa replied, gesturing for a man to come forward. &ldquo;Then we shall talk.&rdquo; She offered this once gleaming soldier a smile, knowing he had to be hungry and cold. &ldquo;Take him to Rickon&rsquo;s old chamber,&rdquo; she instructed the guard that had appeared at her side, knowing those were one of the only remaining open chambers of Winterfell. It felt more like an inn than a noble house these days. Jaime gave her another bow before bidding her and the others goodbye, following after the guard towards the doors. &ldquo;Stable his horse,&rdquo; she spoke to another man, who immediately sprung into action at her command. When he too had gone, she finally turned to face the others, noting the somber looks on all of their faces. &ldquo;Would he truly deflect from Cersei?&rdquo; She rounded on Tyrion, the only one there who would know the truth of Jaime&rsquo;s intent. </p><p>&ldquo;If he has&hellip; Then that means the worst for us.&rdquo; Tyrion replied, his eyes finding hers. Sansa nodded, knowing the truth of the woman as well as him. If Jaime had left Cersei&rsquo;s side, then it meant he no longer agreed with her thoughts and actions. If Jaime had come to them, then it meant Cersei was about to make a move of her own. </p><p>&ldquo;We shall hear him out.&rdquo; Sansa decided, turning then to Jon who was already looking right at her. &ldquo;Ser Davos, you shall join us.&rdquo; She smiled when the older man offered her his elbow to take, which she did, allowing him to guide her back inside, Jon following after them. Tyrion remained there in the courtyard a moment longer before deciding he needed to speak to his brother before returning to Daenerys. He cast one last glance towards the little group that walked back towards Winterfell, knowing exactly why he had come here: he&rsquo;d come to pledge himself to Sansa Stark.</p><p>[ x x x ] \u00a0</p><p>When they&rsquo;d gathered in the Great Hall an hour later, it was as she&rsquo;d said it would be; Jon was seated at her side, with Ser Davos behind them. Brienne stood outside the main doors, guarding the room from anyone&rsquo;s entry. Jaime came through said doors just a moment after they had settled into their chairs, coming to stand before the long table, looking quite refreshed compared to how he&rsquo;d looked upon arrival. &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; Sansa greeted when he&rsquo;d righted himself from his bow, her blue eyes seeking out his. He&rsquo;d shed the clothing he had been wearing when he arrived, instead dressed in clothes Sansa had provided for him, looking quite out of sorts with his golden blonde hair and dark, Northen clothing. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all eager to hear you&rsquo;re reasoning for coming to Winterfell. Your loyalty to your sister is well known and with her sitting upon the Iron Throne, I&rsquo;m surprised to see you standing in my hall.&rdquo; </p><p>Sansa spoke like an experienced lord, taking Jaime by surprise. It was as they said then, she was born to rule the North&hellip; And perhaps more than that. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to pledge my life to you.&rdquo; He spoke simply, raising his hands in a gesture of fealty. \u00a0&quot;I know it is said you have already a pledged shield to protect you, but allow me to become your pledged sword.&ldquo; It was then that he unsheathed his sword- beside her, Jon started, as if he meant to unsheath his own- but then Jaime dropped to his knees before them all. &quot;Lady Sansa, I will shield your back and keep your counsel and give my life for yours if need be.&rdquo; He raised his sword up, offering it to her as he spoke. Sansa recalled when Brienne had spoken these very same words to her, back when she&rsquo;d been alone and scared, back when she had thought her life was truly over. &ldquo;I swear it by the old gods and the new.&rdquo; </p><p>Everyone in the room was quiet as Jaime finished speaking, waiting for what Sansa was going to say. These were not words spoken lightly, oaths were not sworn without meaning. Sansa had lived in King&rsquo;s Landing long enough to know Jaime was not a man who took oaths lightly, he swore by his honor both in battle and a royal court. &ldquo;There are many here who would tell me not to trust you.&rdquo; She spoke honestly, shifting in her chair as she focused on Jaime&rsquo;s deep set eyes. &ldquo;I have learned that trust does not come so easily. I have been taught that by your own flesh and blood.&rdquo; She went on, not bothering to hide the truth that everyone knew, that Joffrey and the other children had been his with Cersei, that he called Cersei lover when he should have called her sister. But, all the same, Sansa felt something different about this Jaime Lannister. Rising up from her chair, she came around to stand before him there on his knees and gave a small, single nod. &ldquo;And I vow\u2026 that you shall always have a place by my heart and meat and mead at my table.&rdquo; Behind her, she heard Jon&rsquo;s intake of breath, knowing her choice had surprised him. But something just told her that Jaime was telling the truth, that he spoke to her from the bottom of his heart. &ldquo;And I pledge to ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor. I swear it by the old gods and the new. Arise.&rdquo; Jaime stood then, sheathing his sword again by his side, his gaze meeting hers. &ldquo;Our oath is sworn and the first thing I must ask of you is to tell us what has brought you here. What has turned you against your own blood? Your own sister?&rdquo; She returned to her place beside Jon, their shoulders brushing as she took to her seat, his hand finding hers beneath the table. </p><p>Jaime opened his mouth and began to speak, weaving tales of Cersei&rsquo;s growing madness, of her distrust in even him. And then he began to tell them of her plot with Euron Greyjoy to dishonor the long standing truce between the Iron Throne and House Stark and Targaryen. &ldquo;You are in grave danger, I fear.&rdquo; Jaime spoke earnestly, his gaze flicking from Sansa to Jon, who clearly held a protective claim to the young woman at his side. &ldquo;Cersei will have you killed if it means furthering her own plans.&rdquo; At this Sansa could not help but to laugh, having known this for years now. &ldquo;And I worry about this other queen you now house here in Winterfell.&rdquo; Sansa sobered then, leaning forward as if to hear him more clearly. &ldquo;The moment the war with the White Walkers is finished, she&rsquo;ll burn you alive if you do not submit to her will.&rdquo; Jon and Sansa exchanged a quick glance before she gestured for him to speak on. &ldquo;I am surprised you house her at all, after what she did to your own friend&rsquo;s family, my lord.&rdquo; It was Jon he was speaking to now, capturing Jon&rsquo;s attention in a way he hadn&rsquo;t yet. </p><p>&ldquo;What do you speak of?&rdquo; Jon asked, speaking up for the first time since their meeting had begun. He knew Daenerys had left on Drogon back at Dragonstone and had faced off with the Lannister army. He&rsquo;d never asked for details on the event as it&rsquo;d not mattered to him back then&hellip; But now, he was curious. </p><p>Ah, so they didn&rsquo;t know&hellip; Now Jaime understood. For a moment he thought perhaps he should not speak of it, should not set to course this one thing that could change everything. Jaime was not a stupid man and he knew the dragons were the only way to stop the Night King and his army of White Walkers. Him revealing the truth of what had happened to the Tarly men could change the tide of the war and not in a good way. But, he knew that if it were him, he&rsquo;d want to know the truth of the queen he served and worked beside. Had he not just left his own queen, his own lover, all because he didn&rsquo;t believe in what she stood for any longer? And so he opened his mouth and he said the words. &ldquo;She burned Randyll and Dickon Tarly alive at the Battle of Goldroad when they refused to bend at the knee.&rdquo; He did not mention the wagons of grain she had burned as well, food for the winter that would have fed the soldiers she coerced by fear into her keep. </p><p>It was Jon that reacted first, pushing back from the table as if he meant to rise up, but Sansa took him by the arm, her simple touch keeping him there at her side. &ldquo;Thank you for your honesty, Ser Jaime.&rdquo; Sansa was the first to speak, turning back to face him with those piercing blue eyes of hers. &ldquo;I imagine you are tired from your journey, please rest. A servant will be by with something for you to eat beyond bread and butter.&rdquo; She spoke as a true leader would, though he could see she was spooked by all he had revealed of Daenerys Targaryen. Jaime finally nodded, knowing he was dismissed by his new mistress, and so he bowed before her and then turned, slipping from the room past Brienne of Tarth.</p><p>For several long moments, neither of them spoke. Ser Davos stood behind them still yet, but found it was not his moment to speak. In truth, he was recalling his own experience with someone he cared for being burned alive, his precious little princess stolen from this world far too soon. &ldquo;Jon&hellip;&rdquo; Finally she spoke softly, her hand still yet clinging to his arm, her voice directing his gaze towards her face. His dark eyes were wild, manic, as they met her own, his mouth pursed in a tight frown as he fought to retain control. &ldquo;Come&hellip;&rdquo; She said quietly, rising to her feet, drawing him up with her. Jon did not speak as she slipped her arm through his and gently tugged him towards the door, sparing Davos only one glance over a shoulder. </p><p>She knew not what she could do for him in this moment, but she would do all she could. And then&hellip; She would do her part as Lady of Winterfell. These crimes would not go unpunished, queen or not, Daenerys would answer for what she had done to innocent men. Sansa swore it. </p>",

Or the fact that he\u2019d brought this Daenerys Stormborn, the supposed last Targaryen with him from Dragonstone in hopes the North would unite behind her in an effort to take down the Night King. Perhaps even the fact that this smirking Targaryen woman had suddenly lost her place as rightful heir to the Iron Throne there Winterfell\u2019s Great Hall, when Bran had revealed Jon\u2019s true parentage. That fact alone- Jon being the true heir- was hard to believe. She and Jon had not yet been given the chance to speak on any of these matters together, but her hope was they might later that day. It seemed now that things had become a whirlwind of activity- prepping for war on both fronts, as well as everyone coming to terms with all they\u2019d been told the night before. </p><p>From where she stood in her chamber, Sansa looked out into Winterfell\u2019s courtyard, seeing Tyrion and Jon down there with Ser Davos in their company, all looking solemn faced as they spoke. Around them was a flurry of activity as her people made ready Winterfell for the hundreds, if not thousands, of soldiers Daenerys had brought with her. Sansa knew there wasn\u2019t enough food to feed her own people let alone a massive foreign army. Had Jon even thought of this? Had Daenerys? As a ruler, her first priority should have been the health and happiness of those who served her, but she\u2019d brought them here without so much as a wagon of grain. If something wasn\u2019t done and soon, the entire North would starve. </p><p>\u201cMy lady?\u201d</p><p>So lost in her own thoughts, she\u2019d not heard the knocking on her chamber door. Turning at the sound of her chamberlain\u2019s voice, she nodded, indicating for him to speak. \u201cA man on horseback approaches the gates. They say it might be a Lannister.\u201d A Lannister? Sansa thought as she brushed past the man, strolling out into the corridor past her guards and down towards the Great Hall. She pushed open the double doors that led out into the courtyard, heading towards the gates where already Jon and the others had begun to gather. </p><p>\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d One guard spoke, looking uncertainly between Jon and Sansa, as if uncertain as to ask permission of. But it was Jon that gestured towards Sansa, as if telling her to make the decision. Her blue eyes met his dark and she could not help but to offer him the smallest of smiles. Sansa faced the guard and gave a single nod of her head, wordlessly giving her permission to open the gates of Winterfell to their newest arrival. </p><p>\u201cOpen the gates!\u201d</p><p>The gates opened wide and sure enough, to every one of them standing there\u2019s shock, it was Jaimie Lannister there on horseback. His gaze swiveled from face to face, focusing for a long moment on Tyrion\u2019s, as shocked to see him there as Tyrion was to see him. But then they all sidestepped, making space for the golden haired man to pass through the gates, the guards closing them behind him. Jaime slid from his horse a moment later, coming to stand before their small group, looking weary from his travels. But a smile transformed his features and he offered a low bow to Sansa, ever the courtier she recalled from her days at Kings Landing. She blinked, uncertain as to how to take this, but allowed him the chance to greet her and the others as he saw fit. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re asking yourself why I\u2019ve come here,\u201d Jaime said then, looking directly at her, moved by the piercing blue eyes that stared back at him. This was not the same young girl that he\u2019d seen and known at Kings Landing. </p><p>\u201cI will have someone show you to a room, eat something and get warm,\u201d Sansa replied, gesturing for a man to come forward. \u201cThen we shall talk.\u201d She offered this once gleaming soldier a smile, knowing he had to be hungry and cold. \u201cTake him to Rickon\u2019s old chamber,\u201d she instructed the guard that had appeared at her side, knowing those were one of the only remaining open chambers of Winterfell. It felt more like an inn than a noble house these days. Jaime gave her another bow before bidding her and the others goodbye, following after the guard towards the doors. \u201cStable his horse,\u201d she spoke to another man, who immediately sprung into action at her command. When he too had gone, she finally turned to face the others, noting the somber looks on all of their faces. \u201cWould he truly deflect from Cersei?\u201d She rounded on Tyrion, the only one there who would know the truth of Jaime\u2019s intent. </p><p>\u201cIf he has\u2026 Then that means the worst for us.\u201d Tyrion replied, his eyes finding hers. Sansa nodded, knowing the truth of the woman as well as him. If Jaime had left Cersei\u2019s side, then it meant he no longer agreed with her thoughts and actions. If Jaime had come to them, then it meant Cersei was about to make a move of her own. </p><p>\u201cWe shall hear him out.\u201d Sansa decided, turning then to Jon who was already looking right at her. \u201cSer Davos, you shall join us.\u201d She smiled when the older man offered her his elbow to take, which she did, allowing him to guide her back inside, Jon following after them. Tyrion remained there in the courtyard a moment longer before deciding he needed to speak to his brother before returning to Daenerys. He cast one last glance towards the little group that walked back towards Winterfell, knowing exactly why he had come here: he\u2019d come to pledge himself to Sansa Stark.</p><p>[ x x x ] \u00a0</p><p>When they\u2019d gathered in the Great Hall an hour later, it was as she\u2019d said it would be; Jon was seated at her side, with Ser Davos behind them. Brienne stood outside the main doors, guarding the room from anyone\u2019s entry. Jaime came through said doors just a moment after they had settled into their chairs, coming to stand before the long table, looking quite refreshed compared to how he\u2019d looked upon arrival. \u201cMy lord,\u201d Sansa greeted when he\u2019d righted himself from his bow, her blue eyes seeking out his. He\u2019d shed the clothing he had been wearing when he arrived, instead dressed in clothes Sansa had provided for him, looking quite out of sorts with his golden blonde hair and dark, Northen clothing. \u201cWe\u2019re all eager to hear you\u2019re reasoning for coming to Winterfell. Your loyalty to your sister is well known and with her sitting upon the Iron Throne, I\u2019m surprised to see you standing in my hall.\u201d </p><p>Sansa spoke like an experienced lord, taking Jaime by surprise. It was as they said then, she was born to rule the North\u2026 And perhaps more than that. \u201cI\u2019ve come to pledge my life to you.\u201d He spoke simply, raising his hands in a gesture of fealty. \u00a0\"I know it is said you have already a pledged shield to protect you, but allow me to become your pledged sword.\u201c It was then that he unsheathed his sword- beside her, Jon started, as if he meant to unsheath his own- but then Jaime dropped to his knees before them all. \"Lady Sansa, I will shield your back and keep your counsel and give my life for yours if need be.\u201d He raised his sword up, offering it to her as he spoke. Sansa recalled when Brienne had spoken these very same words to her, back when she\u2019d been alone and scared, back when she had thought her life was truly over. \u201cI swear it by the old gods and the new.\u201d </p><p>Everyone in the room was quiet as Jaime finished speaking, waiting for what Sansa was going to say. These were not words spoken lightly, oaths were not sworn without meaning. Sansa had lived in King\u2019s Landing long enough to know Jaime was not a man who took oaths lightly, he swore by his honor both in battle and a royal court. \u201cThere are many here who would tell me not to trust you.\u201d She spoke honestly, shifting in her chair as she focused on Jaime\u2019s deep set eyes. \u201cI have learned that trust does not come so easily. I have been taught that by your own flesh and blood.\u201d She went on, not bothering to hide the truth that everyone knew, that Joffrey and the other children had been his with Cersei, that he called Cersei lover when he should have called her sister. But, all the same, Sansa felt something different about this Jaime Lannister. Rising up from her chair, she came around to stand before him there on his knees and gave a small, single nod. \u201cAnd I vow\u2026 that you shall always have a place by my heart and meat and mead at my table.\u201d Behind her, she heard Jon\u2019s intake of breath, knowing her choice had surprised him. But something just told her that Jaime was telling the truth, that he spoke to her from the bottom of his heart. \u201cAnd I pledge to ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor. I swear it by the old gods and the new. Arise.\u201d Jaime stood then, sheathing his sword again by his side, his gaze meeting hers. \u201cOur oath is sworn and the first thing I must ask of you is to tell us what has brought you here. What has turned you against your own blood? Your own sister?\u201d She returned to her place beside Jon, their shoulders brushing as she took to her seat, his hand finding hers beneath the table. </p><p>Jaime opened his mouth and began to speak, weaving tales of Cersei\u2019s growing madness, of her distrust in even him. And then he began to tell them of her plot with Euron Greyjoy to dishonor the long standing truce between the Iron Throne and House Stark and Targaryen. \u201cYou are in grave danger, I fear.\u201d Jaime spoke earnestly, his gaze flicking from Sansa to Jon, who clearly held a protective claim to the young woman at his side. \u201cCersei will have you killed if it means furthering her own plans.\u201d At this Sansa could not help but to laugh, having known this for years now. \u201cAnd I worry about this other queen you now house here in Winterfell.\u201d Sansa sobered then, leaning forward as if to hear him more clearly. \u201cThe moment the war with the White Walkers is finished, she\u2019ll burn you alive if you do not submit to her will.\u201d Jon and Sansa exchanged a quick glance before she gestured for him to speak on. \u201cI am surprised you house her at all, after what she did to your own friend\u2019s family, my lord.\u201d It was Jon he was speaking to now, capturing Jon\u2019s attention in a way he hadn\u2019t yet. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you speak of?\u201d Jon asked, speaking up for the first time since their meeting had begun. He knew Daenerys had left on Drogon back at Dragonstone and had faced off with the Lannister army. He\u2019d never asked for details on the event as it\u2019d not mattered to him back then\u2026 But now, he was curious. </p><p>Ah, so they didn\u2019t know\u2026 Now Jaime understood. For a moment he thought perhaps he should not speak of it, should not set to course this one thing that could change everything. Jaime was not a stupid man and he knew the dragons were the only way to stop the Night King and his army of White Walkers. Him revealing the truth of what had happened to the Tarly men could change the tide of the war and not in a good way. But, he knew that if it were him, he\u2019d want to know the truth of the queen he served and worked beside. Had he not just left his own queen, his own lover, all because he didn\u2019t believe in what she stood for any longer? And so he opened his mouth and he said the words. \u201cShe burned Randyll and Dickon Tarly alive at the Battle of Goldroad when they refused to bend at the knee.\u201d He did not mention the wagons of grain she had burned as well, food for the winter that would have fed the soldiers she coerced by fear into her keep. </p><p>It was Jon that reacted first, pushing back from the table as if he meant to rise up, but Sansa took him by the arm, her simple touch keeping him there at her side. \u201cThank you for your honesty, Ser Jaime.\u201d Sansa was the first to speak, turning back to face him with those piercing blue eyes of hers. \u201cI imagine you are tired from your journey, please rest. A servant will be by with something for you to eat beyond bread and butter.\u201d She spoke as a true leader would, though he could see she was spooked by all he had revealed of Daenerys Targaryen. Jaime finally nodded, knowing he was dismissed by his new mistress, and so he bowed before her and then turned, slipping from the room past Brienne of Tarth.</p><p>For several long moments, neither of them spoke. Ser Davos stood behind them still yet, but found it was not his moment to speak. In truth, he was recalling his own experience with someone he cared for being burned alive, his precious little princess stolen from this world far too soon. \u201cJon\u2026\u201d Finally she spoke softly, her hand still yet clinging to his arm, her voice directing his gaze towards her face. His dark eyes were wild, manic, as they met her own, his mouth pursed in a tight frown as he fought to retain control. \u201cCome\u2026\u201d She said quietly, rising to her feet, drawing him up with her. Jon did not speak as she slipped her arm through his and gently tugged him towards the door, sparing Davos only one glance over a shoulder. </p><p>She knew not what she could do for him in this moment, but she would do all she could. And then\u2026 She would do her part as Lady of Winterfell. These crimes would not go unpunished, queen or not, Daenerys would answer for what she had done to innocent men. Sansa swore it. </p>",

A servant will be by with something for you to eat beyond bread and butter.&rdquo; She spoke as a true leader would, though he could see she was spooked by all he had revealed of Daenerys Targaryen. Jaime finally nodded, knowing he was dismissed by his new mistress, and so he bowed before her and then turned, slipping from the room past Brienne of Tarth.</p><p>For several long moments, neither of them spoke. Ser Davos stood behind them still yet, but found it was not his moment to speak. In truth, he was recalling his own experience with someone he cared for being burned alive, his precious little princess stolen from this world far too soon. &ldquo;Jon&hellip;&rdquo; Finally she spoke softly, her hand still yet clinging to his arm, her voice directing his gaze towards her face. His dark eyes were wild, manic, as they met her own, his mouth pursed in a tight frown as he fought to retain control. &ldquo;Come&hellip;&rdquo; She said quietly, rising to her feet, drawing him up with her. Jon did not speak as she slipped her arm through his and gently tugged him towards the door, sparing Davos only one glance over a shoulder. </p><p>She knew not what she could do for him in this moment, but she would do all she could. And then&hellip; She would do her part as Lady of Winterfell. These crimes would not go unpunished, queen or not, Daenerys would answer for what she had done to innocent men. Sansa swore it. </p>",

I am writing a story (post adwd) where I have reimagined Bran as the next Garth Greenhand & a king of spring over the next 3ER as per showcanon, and thanks to your meta I am more confident with my divergences. Can you write about the connections, if any, you believe exists b/w jon and the winds? I intend to treat him as storm god reborn who will oppose the next drowned god euron. or am I too crazy for not keeping him as ice or fire?",
        "answer": "<p>Hi there!</p><p>Thanks for the compliment! <br/></p><p>Now as to your question: Firstly, I want to say that you just write the fic how you want it to be! I myself like fics that are somewhat canonbent or would be believable in canon, and that is what I write most of the time, except some AU really catches my imagination. So, I can relly understand that you want to stay close to canon, but it is not a necessity, nor does your story lose value if you play with the motives of ASOIAF. <br/></p><p>So, now we have got that out of the way\u2026</p><p>I do think that Bloodraven/3eyed raven might be a much more sinister figure than the wise old wizard he is in the show. I\u2019ve discussed this mostly with <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mToi2Gb5I2BdvTUkmqqh-wg\">@lady-in-a-song</a> and we think he has his own agenda, which might be immortality for himself, maybe in Jon\u2019s body, because Bloodraven might want to inhabit the body of a young Targ. In the books Bran will probably have to cut himself lose from Bloodraven.</p><p>Now, Bran as a new Garth Greenhand is an excellent idea I think, because Bran is the person who has the best connection to the Children of the Forest. And the \u201cking of spring\u201d is of course a very powerful theme. It does tie in with Bran the Builder as a figure of renewal and hope. And of course Bran\u2019s direwolf is called Summer. So, the hints are there and maybe even stronger than you yourself have suspected.<br/></p><p>Now, to Jon: Many say that Jon is \u201cice and fire\u201d, but I must admit that I tend not to interprete the title of the books as something that pertains to Jon alone. I rather think that Jon stands in the middle between ice and fire in a negotiating or balancing position. When we first meet Jon in Bran\u2019s PoV he negotiates for the lives of the direwolf pups and we see him negotiating many, many times in the books. I think this is what he is destined to be, to stand between the extremes and defend humanity from both sides.</p><p>In ASOIAF we have many religions and only the Ironborn and the Rh\u2019llor cult are have a manichaen dualism. Neither the Old Gods nor the Seven have a great big Bad. Rh\u2019llor has the Great Other as an antagonist, and the drowned God and the Storm God. To me Rh\u2019llor (eternal summer) and the Great Other (eternal winter) have always evoked the imagery of scales. Tip too much in one direction and it will spiral out of balance. I think the solution will be to get the balance between ice and fire and an even scale. I guess at the end the seasons will be normal. Iirc GRRM has said that the reason for the long winters is magical.</p><p>Now, I must admit that I have not thought much about the other dualistic religion for the simple reason that I am not that much a fan of the Ironborn. I loved how GRRM portrayed the kingsmoot, because election of a king is something that is usually not used in fantasy, but is an integral part of German medieval history. So, I really devoured that chapter, but otherwise I simply have not pondered much into it. To me the Drowned God and the Storm God seem to be the embodiment of sea and storm, the two natural forces that shap a seafarer nations\u2019 fate. So, although they are just two, it\u2019s not necessarily an antagonistic duo. Sea and storm are both dangerous for ships, and both are necessary, because without water and wind no ship would move. I guess, it is natural, that the Ironborn tend to worship the Drowned God, because they have mastered the knack of reanimation after drowning, and their Storm God is the embodiment only of the bad and dangerous manifestation of wind. So, although the Ironborn worship the Drowned God in a machinaen system, the system per se is not manichaen. Wind and water are elements of change, and change is needed to move things forward. <br/></p><p>So, if Jon is a linchpin for change (something which would be very easy to establish) he has some characteristics of wind. My interpretation would be that wind and water are more like\u00a0 Yin and Yang (from the very shady knowledge I have of these), that is only antagonistic in part and mostly working together (if not collaborating) for change. And that Euron is set up as a big badie might tie into that. I could picture it as Euron misusing the changing forces of water and Jon as the instigator of change, so more a confrontation not set up by the elements/magical forces they represent, but rather by the way they \u2018use\u2019 them, if you understand what I\u2019m trying to say.<br/></p><p>I do think though that in general in ASOIAF \u2018storm\u2019 is not positive. A while ago I looked at Da\u20acnerys and storm imagery (<a href=\"https://fedonciadale.tumblr.com/post/177699464785/a-storm-that-hits\">here</a>). But it might be (and should be, if you ask me) completely different for wind. <br/></p><p>Thanks for the ask!<br/></p>",

I myself like fics that are somewhat canonbent or would be believable in canon, and that is what I write most of the time, except some AU really catches my imagination. So, I can relly understand that you want to stay close to canon, but it is not a necessity, nor does your story lose value if you play with the motives of ASOIAF. <br></p><p>So, now we have got that out of the way\u2026</p><p>I do think that Bloodraven/3eyed raven might be a much more sinister figure than the wise old wizard he is in the show. I\u2019ve discussed this mostly with <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mToi2Gb5I2BdvTUkmqqh-wg\">@lady-in-a-song</a> and we think he has his own agenda, which might be immortality for himself, maybe in Jon\u2019s body, because Bloodraven might want to inhabit the body of a young Targ. In the books Bran will probably have to cut himself lose from Bloodraven.</p><p>Now, Bran as a new Garth Greenhand is an excellent idea I think, because Bran is the person who has the best connection to the Children of the Forest. And the \u201cking of spring\u201d is of course a very powerful theme. It does tie in with Bran the Builder as a figure of renewal and hope. And of course Bran\u2019s direwolf is called Summer. So, the hints are there and maybe even stronger than you yourself have suspected.<br></p><p>Now, to Jon: Many say that Jon is \u201cice and fire\u201d, but I must admit that I tend not to interprete the title of the books as something that pertains to Jon alone. I rather think that Jon stands in the middle between ice and fire in a negotiating or balancing position. When we first meet Jon in Bran\u2019s PoV he negotiates for the lives of the direwolf pups and we see him negotiating many, many times in the books. I think this is what he is destined to be, to stand between the extremes and defend humanity from both sides.</p><p>In ASOIAF we have many religions and only the Ironborn and the Rh\u2019llor cult are have a manichaen dualism. Neither the Old Gods nor the Seven have a great big Bad. Rh\u2019llor has the Great Other as an antagonist, and the drowned God and the Storm God. To me Rh\u2019llor (eternal summer) and the Great Other (eternal winter) have always evoked the imagery of scales. Tip too much in one direction and it will spiral out of balance. I think the solution will be to get the balance between ice and fire and an even scale. I guess at the end the seasons will be normal. Iirc GRRM has said that the reason for the long winters is magical.</p><p>Now, I must admit that I have not thought much about the other dualistic religion for the simple reason that I am not that much a fan of the Ironborn. I loved how GRRM portrayed the kingsmoot, because election of a king is something that is usually not used in fantasy, but is an integral part of German medieval history. So, I really devoured that chapter, but otherwise I simply have not pondered much into it. To me the Drowned God and the Storm God seem to be the embodiment of sea and storm, the two natural forces that shap a seafarer nations\u2019 fate. So, although they are just two, it\u2019s not necessarily an antagonistic duo. Sea and storm are both dangerous for ships, and both are necessary, because without water and wind no ship would move. I guess, it is natural, that the Ironborn tend to worship the Drowned God, because they have mastered the knack of reanimation after drowning, and their Storm God is the embodiment only of the bad and dangerous manifestation of wind. So, although the Ironborn worship the Drowned God in a machinaen system, the system per se is not manichaen. Wind and water are elements of change, and change is needed to move things forward. <br></p><p>So, if Jon is a linchpin for change (something which would be very easy to establish) he has some characteristics of wind. My interpretation would be that wind and water are more like\u00a0 Yin and Yang (from the very shady knowledge I have of these), that is only antagonistic in part and mostly working together (if not collaborating) for change. And that Euron is set up as a big badie might tie into that. I could picture it as Euron misusing the changing forces of water and Jon as the instigator of change, so more a confrontation not set up by the elements/magical forces they represent, but rather by the way they \u2018use\u2019 them, if you understand what I\u2019m trying to say.<br></p><p>I do think though that in general in ASOIAF \u2018storm\u2019 is not positive. A while ago I looked at Da\u20acnerys and storm imagery (<a href=\"https://fedonciadale.tumblr.com/post/177699464785/a-storm-that-hits\">here</a>). But it might be (and should be, if you ask me) completely different for wind. <br></p><p>Thanks for the ask!<br></p>",
