But made me also realize that I should have left earlier but I was so in love with him and believed he could change that I stayed. We had so much in common and he knew me so well but the fact that he constantly would go through my shit without my knowledge was not ok. He would go through my phone, my FaceBook and my email when I was napping in the same room or in the other room in bed early so I could rest for work. I never went through any of his stuff cuz I trusted him but he never trusted me from the get go and it got worse then better then worse then better again then it ended. </p><p>He said we could stay friends and I thought we could be. Until he texted me saying he \u201caccidentally\u201d went on my FB account without my knowledge and went through my fucking messages. He called me the toxic one and said he was done with me and I proceeded to have a mental breakdown at work at 11-12 in the goddamn morning. I was so mad and upset that my insides were shaking and so was I.</p><p>I kept questioning why I dealt with this for over two years and it\u2019s cuz I saw the good in him and wanted to give him a chance to change and when I thought we were good and he was changing he was still the same. Every time I was on my phone gaming or talking to a friend or reading on tumblr he\u2019d think I\u2019m cheating on him. All. The. Time. I did end up cheating and when it happened I had a mental breakdown because of what I did. I was disgusted in myself and eventually I told him what happened and everything went to shit.</p><p>I told my best friends wife what happened (who also cheated on her husband) and said that a relationship should be based on forgiveness and rebuilding. I was hoping that one day we could move past everything and be happy but every time he looked at me he kept thinking I was still cheating when I wasn\u2019t. </p><p>I know I made a huge mistake and I admit I did but I never shoved him being an abusive drunk in his face like he did when we fought. He threw my mistakes and the past in my face every time.</p><p>I felt guilty after we broke up when I started talking to one of my ex\u2019s who actually did change. He did a whole 180 with his life and actually showed me that he wasn\u2019t the person he was in high school. He is actually acting and will be auditioning to be an extra in Captain Marvel and does modeling as well and makes money. My ex could barely hold a job for a few months without quitting but ya know when I quit working at McDonalds cuz the job was toxic he shit on me.</p><p>My work rn only has a certain number of hours to give out to everyone and I was only working on weekends and he said they were giving me shit hours cuz I called out twice cuz I fucking threw up and was super sick one other time and he said it was my fault when it wasn\u2019t. That\u2019s not how my damn job worked. They just didn\u2019t have enough hours to give out cuz it was a slow month. Now hours for me are picking up be he still kept saying I had crap hours cuz I was unrealiable. </p><p>He\u2019d also ask me for money and I\u2019d cave in and give it to him. He guilt tripped me for years since we kept buying fast food and going out and stuff and using his money that he felt that now that I was working and making money that I owed him and I should pay for everything including giving him money for pot and other drugs. He\u2019d bug me until I caved and I got so upset because he ended up picking both my checking and savings accs clean to where I had like idk maybe 3-4 dollars in each. </p><p>I never improved as a person when I was with him for 2 years but maybe now that I am free I can finally focus on myself and have fun. </p><p>To anyone that\u2019s been in a toxic relationship, had gotten out of it and has found a better man I am proud of you! It\u2019s not easy to get out of a toxic relationship when you become dependent on that person and fear that if you leave them you will be alone. Just remember that you have family and friends who will be there to support you no matter what you do.</p><p>Thank you for listening to my rant-ish. </p>",

Now hours for me are picking up be he still kept saying I had crap hours cuz I was unrealiable. </p><p>He\u2019d also ask me for money and I\u2019d cave in and give it to him. He guilt tripped me for years since we kept buying fast food and going out and stuff and using his money that he felt that now that I was working and making money that I owed him and I should pay for everything including giving him money for pot and other drugs. He\u2019d bug me until I caved and I got so upset because he ended up picking both my checking and savings accs clean to where I had like idk maybe 3-4 dollars in each. </p><p>I never improved as a person when I was with him for 2 years but maybe now that I am free I can finally focus on myself and have fun. </p><p>To anyone that\u2019s been in a toxic relationship, had gotten out of it and has found a better man I am proud of you! It\u2019s not easy to get out of a toxic relationship when you become dependent on that person and fear that if you leave them you will be alone. Just remember that you have family and friends who will be there to support you no matter what you do.</p><p>Thank you for listening to my rant-ish. </p>",

But made me also realize that I should have left earlier but I was so in love with him and believed he could change that I stayed. We had so much in common and he knew me so well but the fact that he constantly would go through my shit without my knowledge was not ok. He would go through my phone, my FaceBook and my email when I was napping in the same room or in the other room in bed early so I could rest for work. I never went through any of his stuff cuz I trusted him but he never trusted me from the get go and it got worse then better then worse then better again then it ended. </p><p>He said we could stay friends and I thought we could be. Until he texted me saying he \u201caccidentally\u201d went on my FB account without my knowledge and went through my fucking messages. He called me the toxic one and said he was done with me and I proceeded to have a mental breakdown at work at 11-12 in the goddamn morning. I was so mad and upset that my insides were shaking and so was I.</p><p>I kept questioning why I dealt with this for over two years and it\u2019s cuz I saw the good in him and wanted to give him a chance to change and when I thought we were good and he was changing he was still the same. Every time I was on my phone gaming or talking to a friend or reading on tumblr he\u2019d think I\u2019m cheating on him. All. The. Time. I did end up cheating and when it happened I had a mental breakdown because of what I did. I was disgusted in myself and eventually I told him what happened and everything went to shit.</p><p>I told my best friends wife what happened (who also cheated on her husband) and said that a relationship should be based on forgiveness and rebuilding. I was hoping that one day we could move past everything and be happy but every time he looked at me he kept thinking I was still cheating when I wasn\u2019t. </p><p>I know I made a huge mistake and I admit I did but I never shoved him being an abusive drunk in his face like he did when we fought. He threw my mistakes and the past in my face every time.</p><p>I felt guilty after we broke up when I started talking to one of my ex\u2019s who actually did change. He did a whole 180 with his life and actually showed me that he wasn\u2019t the person he was in high school. He is actually acting and will be auditioning to be an extra in Captain Marvel and does modeling as well and makes money. My ex could barely hold a job for a few months without quitting but ya know when I quit working at McDonalds cuz the job was toxic he shit on me.</p><p>My work rn only has a certain number of hours to give out to everyone and I was only working on weekends and he said they were giving me shit hours cuz I called out twice cuz I fucking threw up and was super sick one other time and he said it was my fault when it wasn\u2019t. That\u2019s not how my damn job worked. They just didn\u2019t have enough hours to give out cuz it was a slow month. Now hours for me are picking up be he still kept saying I had crap hours cuz I was unrealiable. </p><p>He\u2019d also ask me for money and I\u2019d cave in and give it to him.

He\u2019d bug me until I caved and I got so upset because he ended up picking both my checking and savings accs clean to where I had like idk maybe 3-4 dollars in each. </p><p>I never improved as a person when I was with him for 2 years but maybe now that I am free I can finally focus on myself and have fun. </p><p>To anyone that\u2019s been in a toxic relationship, had gotten out of it and has found a better man I am proud of you!
