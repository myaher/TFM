Carol learns R likes her so she goes out her way to tease the living hell out of them. Though, she isn\u2019t the one who gets the last laugh. </p><p>Warnings: cursing </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>I don\u2019t own these Marvel characters. </p><p>Both of them knew they liked each other very deeply. It only got worse when Carol moves in as an Avenger. Yet both of their natures by heart made it so that both of them wouldn\u2019t directly tell each other. Rather, the teasing games were born. </p><p>Carol started it actually. She was the first to find out Y/N\u2019s fondness towards her. It was actually a minor slip up on their part which made it the whole world better. </p><p>They were both on a mission actually. Nothing to blow up, more of takeover. Something that Carol wasn\u2019t entirely used to as spy industry wasn\u2019t her thing. But she insisted to Fury that she would be the one deployed by Y/N\u2019s side. </p><p>\u201cSo, you have any interests at all?\u201d She asks Y/N as they stroll down the boardwalk on their last day on mission. Their job done but legally they couldn\u2019t leave until the next morning. </p><p>Y/N raises an eyebrow. \u201cCarol we literally have the same conversation about this everyday.\u201d They say. </p><p>\u201cDo we now?\u201d She teases. \u201cI can\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t.\u201d They mumble quietly. </p><p>She smiles widely as they continue to walk down. \u201cSo&hellip;you see anyone pretty?\u201d She asks. </p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Y/N asks taken aback. </p><p>\u201cOh you heard me right.\u201d She Says patting them. </p><p>\u201cCap quit messing with me.\u201d Y/N Says back. </p><p>She laughs gently tapping their shoulder. \u201cOh so is that a yes?\u201d </p><p>\u201cShut up Danvers.\u201d They say back. </p><p>\u201cAm I pretty?\u201d That\u2019s when their face feels the blood rushing up to their cheeks. \u201cAdmit it I am.\u201d</p><p>Y/N rolls his eyes trying to hide the flustered look on their face. \u201cShut up.\u201d They repeat. She smiles triumphantly. She has this one in the bag and she wasn\u2019t planning on stopping anytime soon. </p><p>They didn\u2019t know, neither did they bother examining how she was with them other than really really good friends. Though, Y/N realized certain things with her that escalated more than normal since the incident. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cY/N claims they\u2018re the best at fighting!\u201d Sam Says aloud. </p><p>Y/N turns their head confused. \u201cWhat?\u201d Y/N asks baffled as they were both simply playing around with the weapons at the shooting range. </p><p>\u201cReally Y/N?\u201d </p><p>Y/N turns their head to see Carol with a quirked eyebrow. Y/N shakes their head. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything!\u201d They say. </p><p>Sam rolls his eyes. \u201cYeah! He says he great at fighting!\u201d He Says. \u201cBetter than you Danvers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything!\u201d Y/N fights back. </p><p>Carol then grabs Y/N by the arm before tossing them to the floor mat. To no surprise Y/N lands on both of their feet. By then Sam had walked away. Y/N tries walking off the mat only to be stopped as Carol steps both feet inside. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t challenge anyone or say anything!\u201d Y/N complains. </p><p>\u201cAre you backing away because you\u2019re scared you\u2019ll get beaten up by me?\u201d She mocks. </p><p>\u201cActually you will beat me up.\u201d Y/N admits. \u201cCan I leave now?\u201d</p><p>Y/N walks forward only to sense a throw coming from behind their head. They dodge it only to slide their legs under the mat causing Carol to fall on her back. </p><p>\u201cAre we done here?\u201d They asks. </p><p>She smirks before pulling herself up. She throws a punch at them and they dodges it swiftly despite it being at full blast. Y/N takes her arm and tosses her sideways. She tries using her own force to throw Y/N down, simply put they manages to stay on their feet. </p><p>\u201cWow, your quite the fighter.\u201d She Says a little frustrated. </p><p>Y/N keeps their guard up. Y/N returns the favor to sender. They do a jackknife dodging a combo attack from her. She bounces her fists together before rushing towards them. </p><p>Y/N falls under her using the same tactic as first before grabbing her on the mat. They hold her dominantly on the mat. </p><p>\u201cAre we done now?\u201d Y/N asks now slightly annoyed. </p><p>She laughs before smirking mischievously. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you give me a kiss and we\u2019ll be done?\u201d</p><p>Y/N looks at her stunned. \u201cWhat?\u201d They ask as their cheeks turned red. </p><p>Seizing her opportunity, she rolls over pulling Y/N down. Next thing Y/N knows, their back is to the mat and she was smiling triumphantly. She holds them down. \u201cSee, look who\u2019s the better fighter.\u201d </p><p>Y/N sighs heavily rolling their eyes. She gently placed a kiss to their cheek before getting off of them. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d She Says before walking away. Y/N sits there stunned even more with their cheeks red. What the hell just happened. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Three days later, the incident became lost to Y/N\u2019s memory unless provoked. On the very same hour it happened they forced themself to erase it from their mind unless needed. </p><p>That day Y/N was simply minding their own business in their Avengers office. They were actually working on some files that were due next month that they wanted out of the way. Might as well considering they were the only one in the Avengers facility at the time. As they did, a loud boom hits their ears. </p><p>It causes Y/N to jump immediately out to the boom. What the hell was happening. When they takes a step outside, they see the sight of a giant hole from the top of the Avengers facility. Before Y/N could question anything, they see a familiar blonde getting up from under the rubble. </p><p>\u201cCarol what the hell?\u201d Y/N asks. </p><p>She turns her head smiling as she steps through. \u201cOh I was just testing my flight. Came into fast.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFRIDAY, start repair.\u201d Y/N Says over the AI. It wasn\u2019t until they hear machines but their eyes still glued to Carol. \u201cWhy would you need to test flight in a closed field?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was bored.\u201d She Says with a charming smile. </p><p>They shake their head. \u201cTony is going to kill you.\u201d They say.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She says proudly. </p><p>\u201cAnd you destroyed half my shit.\u201d Y/N adds. </p><p>She nods. \u201cI know. But I know you aren\u2019t going to be mad.\u201d She then flies up in front of them. </p><p>\u201cDanvers, you literally bore a hole through the lobby which destroyed almost everything. My machine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve not had it there.\u201d She replies. </p><p>\u201cWhat the&hellip;\u201d Y/N motions towards the rubble. \u201cYou better clean this up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I will, you\u2019ll help me.\u201d </p><p>Y/N shakes their head. \u201cNo.\u201d He Says sternly. </p><p>She pouts stepping a little closer to them. \u201cPlease?\u201d She begs. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a giant ass mess.\u201d Y/N remarks backing away slightly. </p><p>She then pauses for a moment. Y/N thinks they won attempting to leave. That is until they feel her grab their hand before pulling them towards her sealing any air between them. </p><p>\u201cY/N&hellip;.\u201d she teases slightly. She wraps her arms around their frame. Y/N tries not to break or fluster under her grasp. </p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Y/N says trying make her let go but she remains firm. </p><p>She pulls a little closer holding them. Her arms really tightly around them. She tilts her head smiling mischievously. She leans her head a little closer to them. \u201cCome on babe, help me out.\u201d</p><p>She goes closer until it forces Y/N to nod. \u201cFine.\u201d They say giving in. She smiles before letting go and pointing towards the mess. </p><p>\u201cThank you very much.\u201d</p><p>At this point, she\u2019s done at least three different tries to tease them. How she loved teasing them. She knew they had a weakness in the department and it made her ever more happy knowing that Y/N likes her, a lot. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>The team took it to a Tony Party at the ball. Everyone was partying and drinking the night away. As they were, it had just so happened Tony had invited a group of models. Despite practically half the guests being married and what not. </p><p>Though because Sam and Bucky were there they had the slight idea of doing something mischievous. The whole facility at this point done with the flirting between the thunder couple. </p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ladies talk to Y/N over there. They\u2019re a great story teller.\u201d Says Sam. </p><p>\u201cAre they now?\u201d One of them say. \u201cI thought them and the Captain were dating?\u201d</p><p>Bucky shakes his head. \u201cNot yet.\u201d He mutters under his breath. Yet Sam continues as if it was a solid no.</p><p>The ladies sway their hips towards Y/N anyway. They stop in front of them with bright smiles as Y/N laughs nervously noticing the sudden company. </p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d They say with a soft smile. </p><p>Though that wasn\u2019t the point. They chatted away as they casually hit their arm flirtatiously. Even causing their face to blush a shade of red. </p><p>Little did they know, there was a certain Captain sitting across the Gala who was witnessing what was happening. She watches with her eyes glaring red and her fingers starting to glow a little. It was from that moment of watching Y/N casually talking to them, she realized she may have fallen harder than Y/N did. </p><p>\u201cDanvers chill. What\u2019s up?\u201d </p><p>Carol doesn\u2019t turn knowing it was Wanda anyway. Wanda raises an eyebrow before she turns to see Y/N amongst a crowd of Tony\u2019s models which causes her to laugh. </p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She Says. \u201cA jealous Danvers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d She Says back as her phone in her hand was crushed to bits as she watches Y/N talk away. </p><p>\u201cBefore you blow up and force Tony to call the fire department, I\u2019ll create a diversion.\u201d She Says. </p><p>Carol doesn\u2019t turn her head or nod to agreement. It takes less than thirty seconds before she sees the models walk away from Y/N like nothing. Y/N was about to go and follow before they feel something grab them by the arm practically dragging them. </p><p>Y/N doesn\u2019t have enough time to register before a familiar blast is heard and next thing they knew they were up in the sky. There was one person who could be doing this and they knew very damn well, Carol. </p><p>She flies them to Y/N\u2019s place practically picking the lock to their balcony. She places Y/N down, shutting the doors and staring intently and angrily at them. Confusion strikes them completely. </p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Y/N asks confused. </p><p>She glares at them. \u201cDon\u2019t you what the hell me!\u201d She Says angrily. </p><p>\u201cWhat? I was just socializing. Why did you take us out of the party?\u201d Y/N asks bewildered. She doesn\u2019t reply but simply continues glaring. \u201cSeriously what has gotten into you?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes stare harshly at their\u2019s as her hands were still glowing. Though noting from the situation they calm down a little. Y/N doesn\u2019t break a smile from their face neither do they turn to glare at her even harsher. Rather they relaxes. </p><p>\u201cYou have something you\u2019d like to explain?\u201d Y/N replies. </p><p>Her fists clench harshly. \u201cActually I do.\u201d She spits. \u201cWhat the hell were you thinking? You\u2019re going to let yourself be submerged into a crowd of women and calmly that socializing? Like over the moon you aren\u2019t even like that. I thought you knew&hellip;.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re jealous.\u201d Y/N Says cutting into her words. She stops talking looking at them with wide eyes as her cheeks begin into turn a bright shade of red. </p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She Says back trying to remain coy. </p><p>\u201cCarol Danvers is jealous.\u201d They repeat. </p><p>\u201cAm not!\u201d She yells. </p><p>\u201cAre too.\u201d They retort. </p><p>Y/N narrows their eyes at her as her own fists begin clenching. She tries fighting back the more blood that was rushing to her cheeks. She tries remaining the glare on them. </p><p>\u201cYou literally have no other reason as to why you would bring me back here without a lame excuse.\u201d They say firmly. </p><p>\u201cListen here Y/L/N.\u201d She says pointing at their chest. \u201cI don\u2019t get jealous towards anyone or anything. It\u2019s not wort my time trying to feel jealous over nothing. Your antics. You\u2019re acting like your something. Who do you think I am?\u201d</p><p>A smirk suddenly breaks out on their face. Y/N couldn\u2019t help but not hold back a reply. \u201cA jealous hot mess,\u201d They remark. </p><p>She pushes them harshly. \u201cAsshole!\u201d</p><p>Y/N rolls their eyes. \u201cDidn\u2019t know you were this hot when you\u2019re jealous.\u201d Y/N chides with an even more mischievously charming smirk. \u201cLike Jesus&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Their words were suddenly it off as they feels their back against their own door frame. \u201cShut up.\u201d She says harshly. </p><p>\u201cMake me.\u201d They challenge. </p><p>With no missed beat Y/N feels lips hit their\u2019s. It wasn\u2019t sudden, they expected the breaking point. Y/N feels the fire in her kisses as the small kiss became feverish for the both of them. Both clashing with each other. </p><p>Y/N smiles at their own victory. This whole entire time she messed with them, they manage to get the last laugh. They feel her own fingernails stuck in their skin. Like she was marking them in a way through the passion. </p><p>Both pull away in release for air. A chuckle makes out on both of them. She looks at Y/N hungrily. \u201cAre we going back to the party?\u201d Y/N asks. </p><p>She pulls them close. \u201cHell no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this mean I win our tease war?\u201d They ask. </p><p>\u201cI won more times.\u201d She speaks back. \u201cNow shut up.\u201d</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'><b>Have a nice day/night!

Carol learns R likes her so she goes out her way to tease the living hell out of them. Though, she isn\u2019t the one who gets the last laugh. </p><p>Warnings: cursing </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>I don\u2019t own these Marvel characters. </p><p>Both of them knew they liked each other very deeply. It only got worse when Carol moves in as an Avenger. Yet both of their natures by heart made it so that both of them wouldn\u2019t directly tell each other. Rather, the teasing games were born. </p><p>Carol started it actually. She was the first to find out Y/N\u2019s fondness towards her. It was actually a minor slip up on their part which made it the whole world better. </p><p>They were both on a mission actually. Nothing to blow up, more of takeover. Something that Carol wasn\u2019t entirely used to as spy industry wasn\u2019t her thing. But she insisted to Fury that she would be the one deployed by Y/N\u2019s side. </p><p>\u201cSo, you have any interests at all?\u201d She asks Y/N as they stroll down the boardwalk on their last day on mission. Their job done but legally they couldn\u2019t leave until the next morning. </p><p>Y/N raises an eyebrow. \u201cCarol we literally have the same conversation about this everyday.\u201d They say. </p><p>\u201cDo we now?\u201d She teases. \u201cI can\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t.\u201d They mumble quietly. </p><p>She smiles widely as they continue to walk down. \u201cSo\u2026you see anyone pretty?\u201d She asks. </p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Y/N asks taken aback. </p><p>\u201cOh you heard me right.\u201d She Says patting them. </p><p>\u201cCap quit messing with me.\u201d Y/N Says back. </p><p>She laughs gently tapping their shoulder. \u201cOh so is that a yes?\u201d </p><p>\u201cShut up Danvers.\u201d They say back. </p><p>\u201cAm I pretty?\u201d That\u2019s when their face feels the blood rushing up to their cheeks. \u201cAdmit it I am.\u201d</p><p>Y/N rolls his eyes trying to hide the flustered look on their face. \u201cShut up.\u201d They repeat. She smiles triumphantly. She has this one in the bag and she wasn\u2019t planning on stopping anytime soon. </p><p>They didn\u2019t know, neither did they bother examining how she was with them other than really really good friends. Though, Y/N realized certain things with her that escalated more than normal since the incident. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cY/N claims they\u2018re the best at fighting!\u201d Sam Says aloud. </p><p>Y/N turns their head confused. \u201cWhat?\u201d Y/N asks baffled as they were both simply playing around with the weapons at the shooting range. </p><p>\u201cReally Y/N?\u201d </p><p>Y/N turns their head to see Carol with a quirked eyebrow. Y/N shakes their head. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything!\u201d They say. </p><p>Sam rolls his eyes. \u201cYeah! He says he great at fighting!\u201d He Says. \u201cBetter than you Danvers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything!\u201d Y/N fights back. </p><p>Carol then grabs Y/N by the arm before tossing them to the floor mat. To no surprise Y/N lands on both of their feet. By then Sam had walked away. Y/N tries walking off the mat only to be stopped as Carol steps both feet inside. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t challenge anyone or say anything!\u201d Y/N complains. </p><p>\u201cAre you backing away because you\u2019re scared you\u2019ll get beaten up by me?\u201d She mocks. </p><p>\u201cActually you will beat me up.\u201d Y/N admits. \u201cCan I leave now?\u201d</p><p>Y/N walks forward only to sense a throw coming from behind their head. They dodge it only to slide their legs under the mat causing Carol to fall on her back. </p><p>\u201cAre we done here?\u201d They asks. </p><p>She smirks before pulling herself up. She throws a punch at them and they dodges it swiftly despite it being at full blast. Y/N takes her arm and tosses her sideways.

It only got worse when Carol moves in as an Avenger. Yet both of their natures by heart made it so that both of them wouldn\u2019t directly tell each other. Rather, the teasing games were born. </p><p>Carol started it actually. She was the first to find out Y/N\u2019s fondness towards her. It was actually a minor slip up on their part which made it the whole world better. </p><p>They were both on a mission actually. Nothing to blow up, more of takeover. Something that Carol wasn\u2019t entirely used to as spy industry wasn\u2019t her thing. But she insisted to Fury that she would be the one deployed by Y/N\u2019s side. </p><p>\u201cSo, you have any interests at all?\u201d She asks Y/N as they stroll down the boardwalk on their last day on mission. Their job done but legally they couldn\u2019t leave until the next morning. </p><p>Y/N raises an eyebrow. \u201cCarol we literally have the same conversation about this everyday.\u201d They say. </p><p>\u201cDo we now?\u201d She teases. \u201cI can\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t.\u201d They mumble quietly. </p><p>She smiles widely as they continue to walk down. \u201cSo\u2026you see anyone pretty?\u201d She asks. </p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Y/N asks taken aback. </p><p>\u201cOh you heard me right.\u201d She Says patting them. </p><p>\u201cCap quit messing with me.\u201d Y/N Says back. </p><p>She laughs gently tapping their shoulder. \u201cOh so is that a yes?\u201d </p><p>\u201cShut up Danvers.\u201d They say back. </p><p>\u201cAm I pretty?\u201d That\u2019s when their face feels the blood rushing up to their cheeks. \u201cAdmit it I am.\u201d</p><p>Y/N rolls his eyes trying to hide the flustered look on their face. \u201cShut up.\u201d They repeat. She smiles triumphantly. She has this one in the bag and she wasn\u2019t planning on stopping anytime soon. </p><p>They didn\u2019t know, neither did they bother examining how she was with them other than really really good friends. Though, Y/N realized certain things with her that escalated more than normal since the incident. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cY/N claims they\u2018re the best at fighting!\u201d Sam Says aloud. </p><p>Y/N turns their head confused. \u201cWhat?\u201d Y/N asks baffled as they were both simply playing around with the weapons at the shooting range. </p><p>\u201cReally Y/N?\u201d </p><p>Y/N turns their head to see Carol with a quirked eyebrow. Y/N shakes their head. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything!\u201d They say. </p><p>Sam rolls his eyes. \u201cYeah! He says he great at fighting!\u201d He Says. \u201cBetter than you Danvers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything!\u201d Y/N fights back. </p><p>Carol then grabs Y/N by the arm before tossing them to the floor mat. To no surprise Y/N lands on both of their feet. By then Sam had walked away. Y/N tries walking off the mat only to be stopped as Carol steps both feet inside. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t challenge anyone or say anything!\u201d Y/N complains. </p><p>\u201cAre you backing away because you\u2019re scared you\u2019ll get beaten up by me?\u201d She mocks. </p><p>\u201cActually you will beat me up.\u201d Y/N admits. \u201cCan I leave now?\u201d</p><p>Y/N walks forward only to sense a throw coming from behind their head. They dodge it only to slide their legs under the mat causing Carol to fall on her back. </p><p>\u201cAre we done here?\u201d They asks. </p><p>She smirks before pulling herself up. She throws a punch at them and they dodges it swiftly despite it being at full blast. Y/N takes her arm and tosses her sideways. She tries using her own force to throw Y/N down, simply put they manages to stay on their feet. </p><p>\u201cWow, your quite the fighter.\u201d She Says a little frustrated. </p><p>Y/N keeps their guard up. Y/N returns the favor to sender. They do a jackknife dodging a combo attack from her. She bounces her fists together before rushing towards them. </p><p>Y/N falls under her using the same tactic as first before grabbing her on the mat. They hold her dominantly on the mat. </p><p>\u201cAre we done now?\u201d Y/N asks now slightly annoyed. </p><p>She laughs before smirking mischievously. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you give me a kiss and we\u2019ll be done?\u201d</p><p>Y/N looks at her stunned. \u201cWhat?\u201d They ask as their cheeks turned red. </p><p>Seizing her opportunity, she rolls over pulling Y/N down. Next thing Y/N knows, their back is to the mat and she was smiling triumphantly. She holds them down. \u201cSee, look who\u2019s the better fighter.\u201d </p><p>Y/N sighs heavily rolling their eyes. She gently placed a kiss to their cheek before getting off of them. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d She Says before walking away. Y/N sits there stunned even more with their cheeks red. What the hell just happened. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Three days later, the incident became lost to Y/N\u2019s memory unless provoked. On the very same hour it happened they forced themself to erase it from their mind unless needed. </p><p>That day Y/N was simply minding their own business in their Avengers office. They were actually working on some files that were due next month that they wanted out of the way. Might as well considering they were the only one in the Avengers facility at the time. As they did, a loud boom hits their ears. </p><p>It causes Y/N to jump immediately out to the boom. What the hell was happening. When they takes a step outside, they see the sight of a giant hole from the top of the Avengers facility. Before Y/N could question anything, they see a familiar blonde getting up from under the rubble. </p><p>\u201cCarol what the hell?\u201d Y/N asks. </p><p>She turns her head smiling as she steps through. \u201cOh I was just testing my flight. Came into fast.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFRIDAY, start repair.\u201d Y/N Says over the AI. It wasn\u2019t until they hear machines but their eyes still glued to Carol. \u201cWhy would you need to test flight in a closed field?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was bored.\u201d She Says with a charming smile. </p><p>They shake their head. \u201cTony is going to kill you.\u201d They say.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She says proudly. </p><p>\u201cAnd you destroyed half my shit.\u201d Y/N adds. </p><p>She nods. \u201cI know. But I know you aren\u2019t going to be mad.\u201d She then flies up in front of them. </p><p>\u201cDanvers, you literally bore a hole through the lobby which destroyed almost everything. My machine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve not had it there.\u201d She replies. </p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d Y/N motions towards the rubble. \u201cYou better clean this up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I will, you\u2019ll help me.\u201d </p><p>Y/N shakes their head. \u201cNo.\u201d He Says sternly. </p><p>She pouts stepping a little closer to them. \u201cPlease?\u201d She begs. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a giant ass mess.\u201d Y/N remarks backing away slightly. </p><p>She then pauses for a moment. Y/N thinks they won attempting to leave. That is until they feel her grab their hand before pulling them towards her sealing any air between them. </p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026.\u201d she teases slightly. She wraps her arms around their frame. Y/N tries not to break or fluster under her grasp. </p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Y/N says trying make her let go but she remains firm. </p><p>She pulls a little closer holding them. Her arms really tightly around them. She tilts her head smiling mischievously. She leans her head a little closer to them. \u201cCome on babe, help me out.\u201d</p><p>She goes closer until it forces Y/N to nod. \u201cFine.\u201d They say giving in. She smiles before letting go and pointing towards the mess. </p><p>\u201cThank you very much.\u201d</p><p>At this point, she\u2019s done at least three different tries to tease them. How she loved teasing them. She knew they had a weakness in the department and it made her ever more happy knowing that Y/N likes her, a lot. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>The team took it to a Tony Party at the ball. Everyone was partying and drinking the night away. As they were, it had just so happened Tony had invited a group of models. Despite practically half the guests being married and what not. </p><p>Though because Sam and Bucky were there they had the slight idea of doing something mischievous. The whole facility at this point done with the flirting between the thunder couple. </p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ladies talk to Y/N over there. They\u2019re a great story teller.\u201d Says Sam. </p><p>\u201cAre they now?\u201d One of them say. \u201cI thought them and the Captain were dating?\u201d</p><p>Bucky shakes his head. \u201cNot yet.\u201d He mutters under his breath. Yet Sam continues as if it was a solid no.</p><p>The ladies sway their hips towards Y/N anyway. They stop in front of them with bright smiles as Y/N laughs nervously noticing the sudden company. </p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d They say with a soft smile. </p><p>Though that wasn\u2019t the point. They chatted away as they casually hit their arm flirtatiously. Even causing their face to blush a shade of red. </p><p>Little did they know, there was a certain Captain sitting across the Gala who was witnessing what was happening. She watches with her eyes glaring red and her fingers starting to glow a little. It was from that moment of watching Y/N casually talking to them, she realized she may have fallen harder than Y/N did. </p><p>\u201cDanvers chill. What\u2019s up?\u201d </p><p>Carol doesn\u2019t turn knowing it was Wanda anyway. Wanda raises an eyebrow before she turns to see Y/N amongst a crowd of Tony\u2019s models which causes her to laugh. </p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She Says. \u201cA jealous Danvers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d She Says back as her phone in her hand was crushed to bits as she watches Y/N talk away. </p><p>\u201cBefore you blow up and force Tony to call the fire department, I\u2019ll create a diversion.\u201d She Says. </p><p>Carol doesn\u2019t turn her head or nod to agreement. It takes less than thirty seconds before she sees the models walk away from Y/N like nothing. Y/N was about to go and follow before they feel something grab them by the arm practically dragging them. </p><p>Y/N doesn\u2019t have enough time to register before a familiar blast is heard and next thing they knew they were up in the sky. There was one person who could be doing this and they knew very damn well, Carol. </p><p>She flies them to Y/N\u2019s place practically picking the lock to their balcony. She places Y/N down, shutting the doors and staring intently and angrily at them. Confusion strikes them completely. </p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Y/N asks confused. </p><p>She glares at them. \u201cDon\u2019t you what the hell me!\u201d She Says angrily. </p><p>\u201cWhat? I was just socializing. Why did you take us out of the party?\u201d Y/N asks bewildered. She doesn\u2019t reply but simply continues glaring. \u201cSeriously what has gotten into you?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes stare harshly at their\u2019s as her hands were still glowing. Though noting from the situation they calm down a little. Y/N doesn\u2019t break a smile from their face neither do they turn to glare at her even harsher. Rather they relaxes. </p><p>\u201cYou have something you\u2019d like to explain?\u201d Y/N replies. </p><p>Her fists clench harshly. \u201cActually I do.\u201d She spits. \u201cWhat the hell were you thinking? You\u2019re going to let yourself be submerged into a crowd of women and calmly that socializing? Like over the moon you aren\u2019t even like that. I thought you knew\u2026.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re jealous.\u201d Y/N Says cutting into her words. She stops talking looking at them with wide eyes as her cheeks begin into turn a bright shade of red. </p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She Says back trying to remain coy. </p><p>\u201cCarol Danvers is jealous.\u201d They repeat. </p><p>\u201cAm not!\u201d She yells. </p><p>\u201cAre too.\u201d They retort. </p><p>Y/N narrows their eyes at her as her own fists begin clenching. She tries fighting back the more blood that was rushing to her cheeks. She tries remaining the glare on them. </p><p>\u201cYou literally have no other reason as to why you would bring me back here without a lame excuse.\u201d They say firmly. </p><p>\u201cListen here Y/L/N.\u201d She says pointing at their chest. \u201cI don\u2019t get jealous towards anyone or anything. It\u2019s not wort my time trying to feel jealous over nothing. Your antics. You\u2019re acting like your something. Who do you think I am?\u201d</p><p>A smirk suddenly breaks out on their face. Y/N couldn\u2019t help but not hold back a reply. \u201cA jealous hot mess,\u201d They remark. </p><p>She pushes them harshly. \u201cAsshole!\u201d</p><p>Y/N rolls their eyes. \u201cDidn\u2019t know you were this hot when you\u2019re jealous.\u201d Y/N chides with an even more mischievously charming smirk. \u201cLike Jesus\u2026\u201d</p><p>Their words were suddenly it off as they feels their back against their own door frame. \u201cShut up.\u201d She says harshly. </p><p>\u201cMake me.\u201d They challenge. </p><p>With no missed beat Y/N feels lips hit their\u2019s.

Y/N tries walking off the mat only to be stopped as Carol steps both feet inside. </p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t challenge anyone or say anything!&rdquo; Y/N complains. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you backing away because you&rsquo;re scared you&rsquo;ll get beaten up by me?&rdquo; She mocks. </p><p>&ldquo;Actually you will beat me up.&rdquo; Y/N admits. &ldquo;Can I leave now?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N walks forward only to sense a throw coming from behind their head. They dodge it only to slide their legs under the mat causing Carol to fall on her back. </p><p>&ldquo;Are we done here?&rdquo; They asks. </p><p>She smirks before pulling herself up. She throws a punch at them and they dodges it swiftly despite it being at full blast. Y/N takes her arm and tosses her sideways. She tries using her own force to throw Y/N down, simply put they manages to stay on their feet. </p><p>&ldquo;Wow, your quite the fighter.&rdquo; She Says a little frustrated. </p><p>Y/N keeps their guard up. Y/N returns the favor to sender. They do a jackknife dodging a combo attack from her. She bounces her fists together before rushing towards them. </p><p>Y/N falls under her using the same tactic as first before grabbing her on the mat. They hold her dominantly on the mat. </p><p>&ldquo;Are we done now?&rdquo; Y/N asks now slightly annoyed. </p><p>She laughs before smirking mischievously. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you give me a kiss and we&rsquo;ll be done?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N looks at her stunned. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; They ask as their cheeks turned red. </p><p>Seizing her opportunity, she rolls over pulling Y/N down. Next thing Y/N knows, their back is to the mat and she was smiling triumphantly. She holds them down. &ldquo;See, look who&rsquo;s the better fighter.&rdquo; </p><p>Y/N sighs heavily rolling their eyes. She gently placed a kiss to their cheek before getting off of them. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you later.&rdquo; She Says before walking away. Y/N sits there stunned even more with their cheeks red. What the hell just happened. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Three days later, the incident became lost to Y/N&rsquo;s memory unless provoked. On the very same hour it happened they forced themself to erase it from their mind unless needed. </p><p>That day Y/N was simply minding their own business in their Avengers office. They were actually working on some files that were due next month that they wanted out of the way. Might as well considering they were the only one in the Avengers facility at the time. As they did, a loud boom hits their ears. </p><p>It causes Y/N to jump immediately out to the boom. What the hell was happening. When they takes a step outside, they see the sight of a giant hole from the top of the Avengers facility. Before Y/N could question anything, they see a familiar blonde getting up from under the rubble. </p><p>&ldquo;Carol what the hell?&rdquo; Y/N asks. </p><p>She turns her head smiling as she steps through. &ldquo;Oh I was just testing my flight. Came into fast.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;FRIDAY, start repair.&rdquo; Y/N Says over the AI. It wasn&rsquo;t until they hear machines but their eyes still glued to Carol. &ldquo;Why would you need to test flight in a closed field?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I was bored.&rdquo; She Says with a charming smile. </p><p>They shake their head. &ldquo;Tony is going to kill you.&rdquo; They say.</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; She says proudly. </p><p>&ldquo;And you destroyed half my shit.&rdquo; Y/N adds. </p><p>She nods. &ldquo;I know. But I know you aren&rsquo;t going to be mad.&rdquo; She then flies up in front of them. </p><p>&ldquo;Danvers, you literally bore a hole through the lobby which destroyed almost everything. My machine!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You should&rsquo;ve not had it there.&rdquo; She replies. </p><p>&ldquo;What the&hellip;&rdquo; Y/N motions towards the rubble. &ldquo;You better clean this up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I will, you&rsquo;ll help me.&rdquo; </p><p>Y/N shakes their head. &ldquo;No.&rdquo; He Says sternly. </p><p>She pouts stepping a little closer to them. &ldquo;Please?&rdquo; She begs. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a giant ass mess.&rdquo; Y/N remarks backing away slightly. </p><p>She then pauses for a moment. Y/N thinks they won attempting to leave. That is until they feel her grab their hand before pulling them towards her sealing any air between them. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&hellip;.&rdquo; she teases slightly. She wraps her arms around their frame. Y/N tries not to break or fluster under her grasp. </p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Y/N says trying make her let go but she remains firm. </p><p>She pulls a little closer holding them. Her arms really tightly around them. She tilts her head smiling mischievously. She leans her head a little closer to them. &ldquo;Come on babe, help me out.&rdquo;</p><p>She goes closer until it forces Y/N to nod. &ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; They say giving in. She smiles before letting go and pointing towards the mess. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you very much.&rdquo;</p><p>At this point, she&rsquo;s done at least three different tries to tease them. How she loved teasing them. She knew they had a weakness in the department and it made her ever more happy knowing that Y/N likes her, a lot. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>The team took it to a Tony Party at the ball. Everyone was partying and drinking the night away. As they were, it had just so happened Tony had invited a group of models. Despite practically half the guests being married and what not. </p><p>Though because Sam and Bucky were there they had the slight idea of doing something mischievous. The whole facility at this point done with the flirting between the thunder couple. </p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ladies talk to Y/N over there. They&rsquo;re a great story teller.&rdquo; Says Sam. </p><p>&ldquo;Are they now?&rdquo; One of them say. &ldquo;I thought them and the Captain were dating?&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky shakes his head. &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo; He mutters under his breath. Yet Sam continues as if it was a solid no.</p><p>The ladies sway their hips towards Y/N anyway. They stop in front of them with bright smiles as Y/N laughs nervously noticing the sudden company. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N.&rdquo; They say with a soft smile. </p><p>Though that wasn&rsquo;t the point. They chatted away as they casually hit their arm flirtatiously. Even causing their face to blush a shade of red. </p><p>Little did they know, there was a certain Captain sitting across the Gala who was witnessing what was happening. She watches with her eyes glaring red and her fingers starting to glow a little. It was from that moment of watching Y/N casually talking to them, she realized she may have fallen harder than Y/N did. </p><p>&ldquo;Danvers chill. What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; </p><p>Carol doesn&rsquo;t turn knowing it was Wanda anyway. Wanda raises an eyebrow before she turns to see Y/N amongst a crowd of Tony&rsquo;s models which causes her to laugh. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; She Says. &ldquo;A jealous Danvers?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up.&rdquo; She Says back as her phone in her hand was crushed to bits as she watches Y/N talk away. </p><p>&ldquo;Before you blow up and force Tony to call the fire department, I&rsquo;ll create a diversion.&rdquo; She Says. </p><p>Carol doesn&rsquo;t turn her head or nod to agreement. It takes less than thirty seconds before she sees the models walk away from Y/N like nothing. Y/N was about to go and follow before they feel something grab them by the arm practically dragging them. </p><p>Y/N doesn&rsquo;t have enough time to register before a familiar blast is heard and next thing they knew they were up in the sky. There was one person who could be doing this and they knew very damn well, Carol. </p><p>She flies them to Y/N&rsquo;s place practically picking the lock to their balcony. She places Y/N down, shutting the doors and staring intently and angrily at them. Confusion strikes them completely. </p><p>&ldquo;What the hell?&rdquo; Y/N asks confused. </p><p>She glares at them. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you what the hell me!&rdquo; She Says angrily. </p><p>&ldquo;What? I was just socializing. Why did you take us out of the party?&rdquo; Y/N asks bewildered. She doesn&rsquo;t reply but simply continues glaring. &ldquo;Seriously what has gotten into you?&rdquo;</p><p>Her eyes stare harshly at their&rsquo;s as her hands were still glowing. Though noting from the situation they calm down a little. Y/N doesn&rsquo;t break a smile from their face neither do they turn to glare at her even harsher. Rather they relaxes. </p><p>&ldquo;You have something you&rsquo;d like to explain?&rdquo; Y/N replies. </p><p>Her fists clench harshly. &ldquo;Actually I do.&rdquo; She spits. &ldquo;What the hell were you thinking? You&rsquo;re going to let yourself be submerged into a crowd of women and calmly that socializing? Like over the moon you aren&rsquo;t even like that. I thought you knew&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re jealous.&rdquo; Y/N Says cutting into her words. She stops talking looking at them with wide eyes as her cheeks begin into turn a bright shade of red. </p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; She Says back trying to remain coy. </p><p>&ldquo;Carol Danvers is jealous.&rdquo; They repeat. </p><p>&ldquo;Am not!&rdquo; She yells. </p><p>&ldquo;Are too.&rdquo; They retort. </p><p>Y/N narrows their eyes at her as her own fists begin clenching. She tries fighting back the more blood that was rushing to her cheeks. She tries remaining the glare on them. </p><p>&ldquo;You literally have no other reason as to why you would bring me back here without a lame excuse.&rdquo; They say firmly. </p><p>&ldquo;Listen here Y/L/N.&rdquo; She says pointing at their chest. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get jealous towards anyone or anything. It&rsquo;s not wort my time trying to feel jealous over nothing. Your antics. You&rsquo;re acting like your something. Who do you think I am?&rdquo;</p><p>A smirk suddenly breaks out on their face. Y/N couldn&rsquo;t help but not hold back a reply. &ldquo;A jealous hot mess,&rdquo; They remark. </p><p>She pushes them harshly. &ldquo;Asshole!&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N rolls their eyes. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know you were this hot when you&rsquo;re jealous.&rdquo; Y/N chides with an even more mischievously charming smirk. &ldquo;Like Jesus&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Their words were suddenly it off as they feels their back against their own door frame. &ldquo;Shut up.&rdquo; She says harshly. </p><p>&ldquo;Make me.&rdquo; They challenge. </p><p>With no missed beat Y/N feels lips hit their&rsquo;s. It wasn&rsquo;t sudden, they expected the breaking point. Y/N feels the fire in her kisses as the small kiss became feverish for the both of them. Both clashing with each other. </p><p>Y/N smiles at their own victory. This whole entire time she messed with them, they manage to get the last laugh. They feel her own fingernails stuck in their skin. Like she was marking them in a way through the passion. </p><p>Both pull away in release for air. A chuckle makes out on both of them. She looks at Y/N hungrily. &ldquo;Are we going back to the party?&rdquo; Y/N asks. </p><p>She pulls them close. &ldquo;Hell no.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Does this mean I win our tease war?&rdquo; They ask. </p><p>&ldquo;I won more times.&rdquo; She speaks back. &ldquo;Now shut up.&rdquo;</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\"><b>Have a nice day/night!
